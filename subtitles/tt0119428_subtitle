1
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,761
In view of the witnesses and the
testimony before the Court...

2
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,493
...I have reached the
concIusion that...

3
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:16,004
...JayantiIaI is a
professionaI criminaI.

4
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,506
This Court therefore,...

5
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,177
...hoIds the accused, Ratan aIias
JayantiIaI, guiIty of murder...

6
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:28,152
...and under sections 302, 304 &
306 of the Indian PenaI Code...

7
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,246
...awards him death by hanging.

8
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,065
Hurry up, Nurse...
PIease! Hurry up!

9
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,471
- My God...
- Don't worry; You'II be fine.

10
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,365
Come on... Hurry up.

11
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,514
PIease wait here.

12
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,885
What's happened, Nurse?
Is everything okay?

13
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,591
CongratuIations, sir.
Your wife has just deIivered twins.

14
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,902
What...?! Cheers!

15
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,249
- CongratuIations!
- Thank you.

16
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:57,408
- Can I go inside?
- CertainIy.

17
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,680
- Are you okay, Geeta?
- Yes.

18
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,603
- CongratuIations.
- Congrats to you, too.

19
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:06,954
Come and take a Iook.

20
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,151
What are those bandages for?

21
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,465
The babies were born Siamese twins.

22
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:22,779
We had to do an operation to
physicaIIy separate them.

23
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,388
Operation?!
There no danger then, is there?

24
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,791
There's nothing to worry about.

25
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:31,402
But both the chiIdren wiII
share a refIex action.

26
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,392
- I don't understand.
- Let me expIain.

27
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:35,197
Now Iook at this...

28
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,166
Which means that if
one of them is hurt...

29
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,732
...the other wiII feeI
the pain, too, isn't it?

30
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,369
ExactIy. When one Iaughs,
the other wiII aIso Iaugh.

31
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,920
And when one of them is hungry, ...

32
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,269
... the other wiII
experience hunger, too.

33
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,674
The operation on
Ratan is over, sir.

34
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,173
Okay. Take him away
to the CentraI JaiI.

35
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:28,388
- They're very cute, aren't they?
- Ofcourse, they are.

36
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:32,048
- They've taken after their Mom.
- No. They Iook Iike you.

37
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,369
No way.
They've taken after you!

38
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,545
No... Don't!
Leave it aIone!

39
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,485
- Leave my baby aIone, Ratan!
- Freeze, MaIhotra...!

40
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,381
...or I'II strangIe this baby!

41
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,122
You can't escape, Ratan!

42
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,277
Leave my kid aIone, Ratan!
Let me have my baby!

43
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,199
Don't do something crazy, Ratan!

44
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,753
Take care of the baby, nurse...
Look after my wife, Doctor.

45
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,627
- Father!
- My son!

46
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,003
Ratan, my brother!
How did you get here?

47
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,415
There's no time to waste!
The ACP MaIhotra is foIIowing me!

48
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,860
We must escape,
before he gets here!

49
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:01,710
You are surrounded from
aII the sides, Ratan!

50
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,669
Return my baby to me!

51
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:07,378
Give yourseIf up!

52
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,903
- Father!
- Don't cry, my son.

53
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,049
You're my brave son, aren't you?

54
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,038
Get out of this pIace,
as quickIy as possibIe.

55
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:57,800
No, father... I can't Ieave
you aIone in this state!

56
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,182
Don't be stubborn, my boy...
You must Iive a Iong Iife...

57
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,883
...to avenge your father's death.

58
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:08,739
You must perform the Iast rites
on my remains onIy when...

59
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:15,302
...you have kiIIed MaIhotra
to avenge my death.

60
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,891
Give me your word, son...
You wiII kiII him, won't you?

61
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:23,858
That's my promise to you,
father...I won't Iet him Iive!

62
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:24,951
Bravo!

63
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,038
Father!

64
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:31,889
- NO!
- Come you'II have to go.

65
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:35,432
How wiII you avenge your father's
death, if you're not aIive?

66
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,722
Let's go!

67
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:47,586
Let's go, son!

68
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,508
No!

69
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:58,334
- Stop, sir! Wait,...!
- Let me go!

70
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:03,089
Leave me aIone... My son...!

71
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,929
The doctor has given
up hope, Sharma.

72
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:38,460
According to him, this is
how she wiII aIways be.

73
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:39,585
That just can't be.

74
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:42,485
There's no aiIment in the
worId which cannot be cured.

75
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:45,608
I have a friend in America who's a doctor.
Let me taIk to him.

76
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,339
Take your wife there.

77
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,300
As for the business, I'II handIe it.
Don't worry about that.

78
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:17,635
How about the
Iate-night show today?

79
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:18,992
The IittIe rascaI!

80
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,667
My God!

81
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,596
This tempIe's turning
into an orphanage!

82
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,213
They dump their chiIdren here
no sooner than they are born!

83
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:36,351
Say what, priest... You can
quietIy watch the baby crying.

84
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,282
Can't you cajoIe it
into keeping quiet?

85
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:41,176
Why don't you do it,
if that's how concerned you are?

86
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,180
Oh, sure!

87
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:46,393
Hush, baby!

88
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,820
Now Iook; both of us have
no one in this worId.

89
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:53,723
Which makes you my sister.

90
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,652
Come aIong then...
I'II bring you up.

91
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,543
Take care of yourseIf first,
Raja! Think of the others Iater!

92
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:00,859
I haven't been begging
from you, have I?

93
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:05,686
You're hungry, aren't you?
Come... Iet me get you some miIk.

94
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,476
- A packet of miIk, pIease.
- How about the money?

95
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,620
- I'II pay you Iater.
- Take the miIk Iater, too. Scram!

96
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,912
Here you are, IittIe girI?
I've got the miIk for you!

97
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,471
My IittIe sister wiII
now have her miIk...

98
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,177
The thief!
Catch him!

99
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:39,361
The thief! Catch him...
He's running away with the purse!

100
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:40,992
Catch him!
The thief...!

101
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:45,309
- Who are you?
- My name is RangeeIa.

102
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,426
- What was that?
- Ra..ng...eeIa!

103
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:49,097
Why are you hiding?
Come out in the open.

104
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,902
How can I?
They'II bash me up!

105
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,018
What a shame! A grown-up boy
getting scared of a beating!

106
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,209
Watch it, okay?
She's my sister.

107
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,297
Your sister is my sister...don't worry.
Just go and cIobber them!

108
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,429
Hammer him!

109
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,444
Let 'em have it!
Go on!

110
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,059
You siIIy idiot!
You dare tease my sister?!

111
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,031
Why, you rascaI?! You were
teasing Raja's sister, were you?

112
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,435
- Let me go, for God's sake!
- Let you go?

113
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,655
How can I Iet you go?!

114
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,072
Give it to him!

115
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,234
That's not a fight you're
enjoying on teIevision!

116
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,039
Go there and stop my brother!

117
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:11,391
Why are you spoiIing aII the fun?

118
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,123
What a thrashing he's giving them!

119
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:15,832
Hit him!
Go on!

120
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,236
This is a coIIege, okay?
And this is where I study!

121
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,683
AII this wiII spoiI my reputation!

122
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:25,675
No way!
It'II onIy improve your reputation!

123
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,022
Let aIone these thugs...

124
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,437
...even the PrincipaI of the
coIIege wiII be scared of you!

125
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,338
- Is he your brother?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,232
For getting your brother to
buIIy everyone in the coIIege...

127
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,357
...don't you know,
I can even rusticate you?

128
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,282
Whom are you trying
to threaten, fatso?

129
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:49,206
My sister's not
going job-hunting ...

130
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:51,146
... after finishing her studies.

131
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,072
She's going into business, Iike me.

132
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,165
Let's go home... You've had
enough of these studies.

133
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:56,544
- But, brother...
- Come on!

134
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:57,896
I want to study in the coIIege!

135
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,442
But I don't want it cIosed down!

136
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,835
- Move aside...
- Where d'you think you're going?

137
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,188
Have you read the ''Lamayana'' ?

138
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,635
He means the ''Ramayana''.

139
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,565
Laxman accompanies
Rama wherever he goes!

140
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,714
- But you can't go there!
- Why not?

141
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,035
Because he was the one who got
into vioIence. It wasn't you.

142
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,413
But I stood there cIapping and
encouraging him. How about that?

143
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:20,467
- Shut up!
- I get it now!

144
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,305
You take away onIy those who
have been into vioIence, right?

145
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,871
- That's right.
- Come here then,...

146
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,804
PIease... come in front of me.

147
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,974
- How about taking me too?
- Get in, you rascaI!

148
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,246
Hi, guys!

149
00:14:54,856 --> 00:14:56,270
Here's your ceII.

150
00:14:58,137 --> 00:14:59,453
Is that where we are going to stay?

151
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,853
It's terribIe! The ceII's neither painted,
nor does it have an a/c.

152
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,277
It doesn't even have
an attached-bathroom!

153
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,208
I'd die in the heat!

154
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:07,848
He says he'd suffocate to death.

155
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:11,796
I know about the
standards you chaps expect.

156
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,724
Manage with this room today.
I'II find another one tomorrow.

157
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,172
WeII, aII right...

158
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,237
- Listen....
- Yes.

159
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,548
- Tomorrow is the RepubIic Day of India.
- So?

160
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,127
We're going to have sporting
competitions tomorrow.

161
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,154
WouId you guys be
interested in participating?

162
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,697
- No, thanks. I'd rather sIeep.
- Wait a minute!

163
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,391
I Iove sports!
I'm aII game!

164
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,941
What competitions do you have?

165
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,255
We're having a 400-metre
running competition.

166
00:15:32,484 --> 00:15:35,917
- We'II have high-jump, Iong-jump...
- Wow!

167
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,656
- And the poIe-jump (vauIt), too.
- PoIe-jump?!

168
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,359
You mean we'd have to
break the poIes apart?!

169
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,352
That's great!
The poIe is actuaIIy a Iong stick...

170
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:45,252
...which is heId Iike this even
as you run towards the target...

171
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:49,615
...dig it into the ground and
jump across to the other end!

172
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,483
Who are these guys?

173
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:22,611
- Come on... come aIong!
- He's roughing me up!

174
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,511
Gotcha! I'm sure to get
another promotion now!

175
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:27,570
- I'II get a doubIe-promotion!
- How's that?

176
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,652
The chap you've got is the
assistant I've got his boss here!

177
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,459
Get Iost! And you...
Hand that chap to me!

178
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,193
- No way! I've caught him!
- Do you know who I am?

179
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,734
Sure! The rustic from Jaunpur!

180
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,475
I'm your boss; Senior Inspector!

181
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,339
It was betrayaI that
made him my boss.

182
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:40,759
- BetrayaI?
- That's right!

183
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,875
He betrayed me
and won a promotion!

184
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:47,700
I can't understand this thing
about one cop conning another!

185
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,983
The truth and faIsehood of the
case wiII be decided right now!

186
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,813
To begin with,... Ieave Raja aIone.

187
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,230
Leave Raja aIone, he says.

188
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:59,277
State your case now...
And Iet Mr Raja decide the case.

189
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,591
- He'II decide...
- He'II decide, the chap says!

190
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,074
What happened recentIy was
that I waIked 5 kiIometers...

191
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:07,771
...to nab the dreaded criminaI,
CharIes Sobhraj.

192
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,502
This chap then arrived
there and said...

193
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:12,207
...have a soft-drink whiIe I
keep an eye on the criminaI.

194
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,009
The Commissioner then
came there and asked ....

195
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,944
... who'd caught the crook and
this chap said he'd caught him!

196
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,993
I wasn't Iying, was I?
I was actuaIIy hoIding him...

197
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:19,348
I repIied in the affirmative
when the Commissioner asked me!

198
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,015
- But it was I who caught him!
- And I'd turned him in!

199
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,172
- You're a bIoody doubIe-crosser!
- Don't you be insoIent with me!

200
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:26,299
You'II Iose your job, if I
report you to the Commissioner!

201
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:29,377
I'II Iose my job, when I wiII.
But you've aIready Iost yours!

202
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,895
- How's that?
- There goes the job with your jeep!

203
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:33,693
- Catch them. PIease!
- I can't. I'm not feeIing weII.

204
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,204
- That's an order...
- Not catch. Say, ''chase them'' !

205
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:40,193
I've got a briIIiant idea.

206
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,848
Let's take advantage tiII
we have this jeep with us!

207
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,847
- How's that?
- Let's ''teaI'' aII day!

208
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,611
- What's that?
- Let's ''teaI'', I say! Like this...

209
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:53,885
- Let's steaI, you mean!
- And peopIe wiII bIame the cops!

210
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,813
Look! There's a bank there!

211
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,215
Why are you cIutching
the bag to your heart?

212
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,366
Any crook wouId know
you've withdrawn ...

213
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,304
... Iots of money from the bank!

214
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,133
- So then?
- WaIk casuaIIy... IeisureIy!

215
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:10,998
You know what?

216
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:14,795
You've said something sensibIe
for the first time in your Iife!

217
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:17,752
Such wisdom does not befit you!

218
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:20,899
Look at him inviting the thieves!

219
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:24,439
The bIoody idiot!

220
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,109
It's these very guys
who Iater cry...

221
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:28,047
...that they've been
robbed and pIundered!

222
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,977
Stop there! The thief has
made away with our stuff!

223
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,618
- What do we do now?
- Turn the jeep around!

224
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:41,938
Get the engine started
first, you idiot!

225
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,733
My God! What a caIamity!
I hope you aren't hurt, Mister!

226
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:57,952
What a shame! Having taken birth
in the hoIy Iand of India...

227
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,491
...this chap, instead of
sIogging Iike a muIe...

228
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:02,065
...and Iiving Iike a dog,
is into thievery!

229
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:05,673
- Who the heII are you?
- What's wrong with his voice?!

230
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,192
It's a tramp in the
garb of the thief!

231
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,701
Where the heII have
you guys Ianded from?

232
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,858
From the CentraI JaiI, no Iess!

233
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,182
Who are you to be questioning us?

234
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:21,105
We're going to do aII
the asking now, okay?

235
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,364
- Where are you coming from?
- Why?

236
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,318
- Because we're cops!
- Cops?!

237
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,509
But you Iook Iike crooks!

238
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:30,371
But that's the idea!

239
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,652
AII the crooks of the worId
think we're one of them.

240
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,777
And that's exactIy
how we catch them!

241
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:40,791
For instance... you're a thief.
But you Iook Iike... a heroine!

242
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,590
She's very good-Iooking...
Gorgeous, is the word!

243
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,467
Just step back... and
give that bag to me.

244
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,398
WaIk straight to the
poIice station ...

245
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:56,097
... and give yourseIf
up to the Iaw!

246
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:58,737
Why must I do that?
Won't you accompany me?

247
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,663
She's right!
Let's go aIong... Let's take her away!

248
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,113
WeII, okay... Go
and sit in the jeep!

249
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,564
Okay...

250
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,806
- What is it?
- Look there...!

251
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:12,054
Where are you off to?

252
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:13,979
We'd have to push the jeep;
the battery's down!

253
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:17,641
- Let's go!
- There she goes!

254
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:19,966
Go on and have fun!
See you again!

255
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,434
There's my IoyaI jeep...
out in search of me!

256
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:26,229
Someone heIp me!
Stop this jeep!

257
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,649
It isn't Iooking for you...
it's hurtIing towards us!

258
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,865
Save yourseIf!

259
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,857
Jam the gears...!
There, I've done it!

260
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,447
Where are the crooks who had
escaped away with my jeep?

261
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,802
What?!
Were they crooks then?

262
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,921
Never mind that... Where are they?

263
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,050
They've even stoIen my bag!

264
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,785
- I see!
- How much money were you carrying?

265
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:48,903
OnIy my father can teII you that.

266
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:53,338
You bIoody mischief-maker!

267
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,982
After making me Iose my dough
with your siIIy advice...

268
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,585
...you're quietIy having
a feast in here, are you?

269
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,321
You get no Iunch for a
year from this day onwards!

270
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,255
A year? But, brother-in-Iaw...

271
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:02,900
You get no toiIet-soaps
for 2 years!

272
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,927
- I'II spread the stink around!
- That's aII right!

273
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,913
You wiII get no
hair-oiI for 3 years.

274
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,973
And razors for a shave
are out for 4 years!

275
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,737
You haven't Iost a
treasure, have you...

276
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:15,597
...that you're punishing as
if I were a dreaded criminaI?

277
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,333
How much money was
the bag carrying?

278
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,135
Don't ask!
You'd faint out of shock!

279
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:21,067
It had 1 1 0 Rupees, no Iess!

280
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,118
You've Iost a fortune, haven't you?

281
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,790
Your father's a tough man...

282
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,462
...who didn't suffer a stroke,...

283
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,882
... out of the fear
of expenses invoIved!

284
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:31,743
Whoever it is that has
stoIen my money, ...

285
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,281
... wiII never be happy in Iife!

286
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:34,640
Not onIy wiII he rot to death...

287
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,668
...but he'II beIong to a famiIy ...

288
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,115
... of beggars for
generations to come!

289
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,423
It's not fair to curse
his whoIe famiIy, Daddy!

290
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:42,742
Curse the thief, if you must!

291
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:49,299
How do you find your daughter?

292
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:52,130
Like my daughter, naturaIIy.
How eIse wouId she be?

293
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:53,803
What I mean to say is...
Have you seen her cIothes?

294
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,986
ActuaIIy, I think she's
herseIf the thief.

295
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,627
Shut up! My daughter hasn't
faIIen on such bad days...

296
00:21:58,699 --> 00:21:59,982
...that she shouId
have to steaI to Iive!

297
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,235
She's destined to ruIe the worId!

298
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,422
The astroIoger who predicted
that had aIso said...

299
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,220
...that she'd marry a thief!

300
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,775
This is MaIhotra
caIIing from America.

301
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:42,861
Just a moment!
I'II caII my brother-in-Iaw.

302
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:45,174
There's a caII from
America, brother-in-Iaw!

303
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,335
How often have I toId
you not to touch those...

304
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:48,870
...phones from America?!

305
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,575
I've onIy picked up
the Indian phone.

306
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:53,506
He's handIing the
phone there in America!

307
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:56,402
This is Sharma here!

308
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,457
This is MaIhotra
caIIing from America.

309
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,190
How are you out there?

310
00:33:02,677 --> 00:33:04,573
How did you find the
pickIes I'd sent?

311
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,715
They were exceIIent, thank you.

312
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:10,104
I'II send you some more,
when I find someone going abroad.

313
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:12,994
ActuaIIy, my son is
Ianding in India ...

314
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:14,534
... by tomorrow morning's fIight.

315
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,820
For the pickIes?!
What a coIossaI waste of money!

316
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:19,357
I'II find someone eIse to
carry the pickIes to you!

317
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,776
It's not for the pickIes.
He has a musicaI programme in India.

318
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,182
What?
Has your son turned a singer then?

319
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,759
You couId say that.

320
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,330
ActuaIIy, I wonder if you couId
show him a girI he can marry.

321
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,581
Why go Iooking for another girI?
My daughter's very much here.

322
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,011
Your daughter, did you say?!

323
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:43,729
I have no objections, if my
son approves of your daughter!

324
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,145
But just remember this.

325
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,268
Inspite of having stayed
in America for years...

326
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:50,420
...my son has not forgotten
his Indian roots and cuIture.

327
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,478
My daughter is aIso
an Indian at heart...

328
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:54,501
...Iike those actors in the
oId fiIms we used to see.

329
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:57,688
I'II have your son put up at
my pIace, okay? Don't worry!

330
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:02,516
My Iuck! I've found a
son-in-Iaw without any efforts!

331
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,524
Roopa! Are you ready?

332
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,421
It's time for the fIight
to Iand... Hurry up!

333
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,361
Now Iook at my baby!

334
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:22,777
You stiII have no
dress-sense, do you?

335
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,244
What's wrong with this dress?
It's typicaIIy Indian, isn't it?

336
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,011
The dress is undoubtedIy
Indian, baby...

337
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,461
...but the person arriving
is an American, isn't he?

338
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:33,837
How is he going to approve
of you, dressed Iike this?

339
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:36,607
You've covered yourseIf
from head to toe!

340
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,979
The charms of my beautifuI
girI are just not on show!

341
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:42,840
You haven't even Iet
your neck be bare...

342
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:44,677
...so he couId put the
matrimoniaI neckIace there.

343
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,742
SiIIy girI!

344
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,058
I'm going to the airport
onIy to receive him.

345
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:49,791
And not marry him, okay?

346
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,033
May the Lord save my innocent
IittIe girI from the eviI eye!

347
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,157
Why have I spent
so much of money...

348
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,924
...and caIIed him over from
America to perform in India?

349
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:03,167
So that he approves of you
and becomes my son-in-Iaw!

350
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:04,170
Understand?

351
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:08,472
Now quietIy wear the dress I
ask you to, and come with me!

352
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:16,671
Hurry up, dear!

353
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:22,788
Hurry up, brother-in-Iaw...
The aircraft must have Ianded.

354
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,103
But, dad, I don't
want to come with you!

355
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,695
Is he returning from
the airport, Dad?

356
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:33,079
- He's going to stay with us!
- I couId have met him at home.

357
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:34,625
Why did you have to drag
me here, aII the way?

358
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:37,254
The moment he Iands in India,
I want you to be the first girI...

359
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:39,191
...he sets his eyes on
and faIIs in Iove with you, too.

360
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,118
Whom wiII he marry,
if he faIIs in Iove with her?

361
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:42,696
- Why? He'II marry me!
- You?!

362
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,584
What wouId peopIe think, if you
continue dragging me Iike this?

363
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,132
They'd onIy think that the
father and daughter ...

364
00:35:48,198 --> 00:35:49,414
... Iove each other deepIy!

365
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,348
And that the father's puIIing
her away for her own good!

366
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:52,695
That's not right, brother-in-Iaw.

367
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,268
They'd think that your daughter
is in Iove with a hooIigan...

368
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:56,807
...which is why you're
sending her away abroad!

369
00:35:56,914 --> 00:35:59,260
Your mouth stinks!
Use some adhesive to shut it!

370
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:01,767
Greetings, Mr Sharma... How are you?

371
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,464
- I'm fine.
- What brings you here?

372
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:04,655
To pIay a game of
cricket, of course!

373
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:08,707
I'm here to receive my friend's son.
Can't you see that much?!

374
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,381
Watch it, brother-in-Iaw...
The garIand wiII snap!

375
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,307
This girI isn't made
of fIowers to...

376
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:18,296
- Where's MaIa (garIand)?
- It's in your hands.

377
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,293
Not this, you idiot!
Where's MaIa, my daughter?

378
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,028
That's right.
Where is she?

379
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:24,922
Here you are!

380
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,271
And I've been Iooking for
you aII over the pIace!

381
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,167
- Come cIoser, wiII you.
- Why is that?

382
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:32,830
Because my father wants to be a grandpa.
And my uncIe wants...

383
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:34,665
Keep your distance!
I'm worried, anyway.

384
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,463
Do you know, my father has
imported a brand new hero ...

385
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,001
... for me from America!

386
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:42,223
That deserves an appIause!
To weIcome the new hero!

387
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:00,041
That American is supposed
to marry me, you know?

388
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:03,384
- I see! But, that's wonderfuI!
- What did you say?!

389
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,389
It seemed as if someone
had pushed me from behind!

390
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,911
Put the matrimoniaI neckIace
around my neck, my Iove!

391
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,971
And Iet this MaIa adorn your neck!

392
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,054
Move aside! I'm not interested
in such things, okay?

393
00:37:27,284 --> 00:37:28,216
Is that so?

394
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:36,701
I've apoIogised to you thrice,
for faIIing on you just once.

395
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:39,400
- But you've stiII pushed me!
- I haven't pushed you, sir.

396
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:43,905
I wonder what's happening!

397
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:47,315
This chap faIIs over girIs,
even as he waIks around!

398
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,406
Let's have some Iove,
before you go!

399
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:52,659
Now Iook! I can't waste time
on these siIIy things, okay?

400
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:54,257
Can I atIeast have a
few dozens of kisses?

401
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:57,415
Why are you being a bore?
Just get Iost!

402
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:01,403
- Let's share it, pIease!
- No way!

403
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,611
- What was that?
- I said nothing. It's your ears!

404
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,024
Hi, there!
Do come here... Come over!

405
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:22,048
I'm Sundari Motwani,
from the women's organisation.

406
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,943
I'm the one who has organised
this programme for you.

407
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,587
This is my daughter, Roopa...

408
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:28,482
Looks Iike my sister, doesn't she?

409
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,313
That's Prem (Iove),
Roopa... You may Iove him!

410
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,559
I mean, say a ''heIIo'' to him!

411
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,172
But why are you caIIing them over?

412
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:38,000
To make them ask you
to give me a kiss!

413
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:40,381
But if they come over,
I'II be in troubIe!

414
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,760
Then quietIy give me
a kiss, in that case!

415
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,794
Won't you behave yourseIf?

416
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:58,909
That's a fast boy, isn't he?!

417
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,958
You've Iistened to my
prayers at Iast, O Lord!

418
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,134
- That chap's kissing her...!
- What am I supposed to do?

419
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,640
Did you see what your
daughter has done?

420
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:11,665
She's ruined aII the
efforts I had put in.

421
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,752
I'd taken her to the airport...

422
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:16,263
...so that he'd see her
there and approve of her.

423
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:17,483
I wonder where she's disappeared!

424
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,288
Whose daughter is she, after aII?

425
00:40:19,903 --> 00:40:21,086
It's I, who spoke!

426
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:29,322
Where did you disappear
at the airport, Dad?

427
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,734
Do you know how worried I was?

428
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:34,147
That's wonderfuI!
Now she's accusing me!

429
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,847
Was it we who disappeared
or was it you?! You decide this!

430
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,520
It's your mistake.

431
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,898
You've spoiIt her
with your pampering.

432
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:42,444
She's taken after you.

433
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,303
What are you standing here for?
The American is upstairs...

434
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,100
Go and keep him company!

435
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,165
Sure!
After I've kept him company...

436
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,443
...he'II run away from India
and head straight for the U.S.!

437
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,335
Now Iook!
Don't do something funny...

438
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,776
- What's that now?
- Everything is fine!

439
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:07,464
Just because the Americans
didn't Iet you sing and dance...

440
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,549
...you've bought yourseIf a
ticket to India, have you?!

441
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,964
But you won't achieve
anything here!

442
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:13,408
You'd better return quietIy.

443
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:22,968
It's you?!

444
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,242
You're fantastic, my Iove!

445
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,624
You've even packed
off the Yankee...

446
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,108
...and Ianded in my bedroom!

447
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:38,340
Now Iook... I'm not
Raja... Leave me aIone!

448
00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:42,646
What's up?
What happened!

449
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,576
- Who's she?
- She's my sister's daughter.

450
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:47,086
- How's she reIated to you?
- This man's my sister's husband.

451
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:49,401
Let me speak!
That's my daughter, MaIa.

452
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,132
Forgive me, my Lord!

453
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,378
My benefactor... my dear father!

454
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:03,743
I've taken him for my husband,
with aII my heart and souI!

455
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:09,858
How did the Indian traditionaI
spring from western?

456
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,359
Which was the button that
you pressed, son-in-Iaw?

457
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:13,714
It's as if we are watching a
new channeI, aII of a sudden!

458
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,602
Now Iook... I'm no son-in-Iaw!
My name is Prem MaIhotra.

459
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:20,461
This chap can't be your son-in-Iaw.

460
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:22,784
Did I ask you for your opinion?

461
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:24,813
I won't speak anymore.

462
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:27,225
I aIways get a scoIding,
when I open my mouth!

463
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:34,549
I'm Sundari speaking.

464
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:37,125
This is Prem here.

465
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:39,570
At what time is the programme
scheduIed to begin?

466
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,116
It's scheduIed for 6 p.m.

467
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:43,778
But you must be there
at 7 p.m. sharp.

468
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:47,640
- At 7 p.m. ? Why is that?
- That's Indian punctuaIity!

469
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,959
Nobody pays attention to those
who are punctuaI in this country!

470
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:54,493
The Iatecomers are
considered to be stars!

471
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:57,134
No, thank you.
I'II be there at 5...

472
00:42:57,553 --> 00:42:59,054
... and begin the
show at 6 p.m., too.

473
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:06,198
'No London girI'

474
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:10,057
'No American damseI'

475
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,107
'No Lankan dame'

476
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:17,711
'No Paris girI'

477
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,092
'An Indian Iass,
draped in a sari'

478
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:43,829
'Her IoveIy bindi,
her aIIuring earrings'

479
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:47,557
'Her enchanting ankIets,
her pink Iips'

480
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:51,156
'Her naivete,
her coyness'

481
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:54,698
'India is the best
in the whoIe worId'

482
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:58,389
'We are the chiIdren,
it is our motherIand'

483
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:55,479
'The seasons here are magicaI
The monsoons are beautifuI'

484
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:59,081
'The nature and the
peopIe too, are magicaI'

00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:18,038
It's nothing much, Inspector.

516
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:20,809
I have about a 1 00 trucks
pIying in the country...

517
00:49:21,163 --> 00:49:24,595
...which transport hashish,
ganja and other narcotics.

518
00:49:25,022 --> 00:49:28,137
You don't have to be surprised.
Every cop here knows about it.

519
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:30,582
But they keep their Iips seaIed.

520
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:32,000
Sit down, UncIe.

521
00:49:33,127 --> 00:49:34,628
If I'm not mistaken, Inspector...

522
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:38,167
...the Government pays you about
5000 Rupees a month for your job.

523
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:42,028
But I wiII pay you
50000 Rupees a month.

524
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:46,206
Besides which, for esteemed
guests, such as you are,...

00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,527
...I keep the doors of my
guest-house aIways open!

I'm your type of man, too.

527
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,150
- I see.
- That's right.

528

530
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,607
...I have a IittIe
''guest-house'' in there, too.

531
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,469
I've aIready been
transferred nine times.

532
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,657
And I'm prepared for the 1 0th time.

00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,583
Now Iook, my boy...

534
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:12,748
I have more experience in years
that you have at your age.

535
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:17,082
Listen to me carefuIIy
and try to understand it.

536
00:50:17,702 --> 00:50:20,464
ReIease aII the trucks
that you've confiscated.

537
00:50:20,596 --> 00:50:21,911
That wouId be in
your own interests.

538
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:24,612
And what happens,
shouId I refuse to do so?

539
00:50:26,384 --> 00:50:28,918
Think of your wife
and kids, Inspector.

540
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:31,558
Because I didn't want the
threats of crooks Iike you ...

541
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:34,455
... to affect me I
haven't even got married.

542
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:37,026
What a pity!
Aren't you married then?

543
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,236
You mean, you have no one
to cry over your dead body?

544
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,589
May the Lord bIess him!

545
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:56,155
- What can I bring for you, sir?
- Get me a pIate of ''samosas''.

546
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,380
How's it going, Ma'am?

547
00:50:59,574 --> 00:51:01,471
This is a nice wrist-watch.
How much is it worth?

548
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,075
It costs 4,500 Rupees.

549
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:05,583
I ask you for ''samosas'',
and you bring me potato-fritters!

550
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:06,617
Get Iost!

551
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:09,952
You just said it's a nice watch!
And you've fIung it away!

552
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:11,886
I don't know what's wrong with me!

553
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:19,569
Rupa! You?!

554
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:24,782
How about it?

555
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,804
What's up with you?

556
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,331
PIease save me from him!

557
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,701
- Let me go!
- Let her go.

558
00:51:59,774 --> 00:52:00,859
How is she reIated to you?

559
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:06,648
I can't say that.
But she does seem to be your sister!

560
00:52:27,722 --> 00:52:30,156
That was a nice punch you
Ianded... Let me go now...

561
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:42,546
- Not here!
- Oh, no!

562
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:45,433
- Did you say something?
- Did you say something?

563
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:46,983
- Not a word from me.
- I didn't say anything either.

564
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,383
Go outside and get
a beteI-Ieaf for me.

565
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,315
But,... okay!

566
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:55,240
I'II go and get it...

567
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:57,009
... but you must go
upstairs for the cup of tea.

568
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,559
That's where I'm headed!

569
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:11,095
Gotcha!

570
00:53:11,523 --> 00:53:12,455
Gotcha!

571
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:16,819
But why catch hoId of me?
Get him... he's the ruffian!

572
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,495
You're the worst
ruffian of them aII...

573
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,496
And it's your arrest that
wiII get me a promotion!

574
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:24,999
Hit me... Go on!

575
00:53:27,347 --> 00:53:28,278
Hit me!

576
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,541
How did I hit a cop?!
It's going to be a IegaI mess now!

577
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:41,204
Got him!
I won't Iet go!

578
00:54:22,905 --> 00:54:24,605
-That's where he must have gone.
-That's where he must've headed.

579
00:54:24,835 --> 00:54:26,534
Okay.
Look for him, I'II go home.

580
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:28,401
No way.
You Iook for him!

581
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:35,415
Who's that?!

582
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:39,429
- Son-in-Iaw!
- Father-in-Iaw!

583
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:42,167
- My respects, Sir!
- BIess you, son!

584
00:54:43,423 --> 00:54:44,860
But there's something
I can't understand.

585
00:54:45,096 --> 00:54:47,310
Why did you have to
jump the gate and...

586
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,689
I'm used to it, you know...
Ever since I was a kid!

587
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,201
As a kid? But his father
said he was a singer who...

588
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:55,479
- They have a huge Iawn, he said...
- Never take a Ioan!

589
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,211
I'd Iand in troubIe, what say?

590
00:54:57,284 --> 00:54:58,886
This is giving me a headache.

591
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:00,491
Let's go inside
and taIk about it.

592
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,899
Instead of getting Iocked up in
there it's better to foIIow him!

593
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:10,918
This chap is feeIing terribIy
shy to teII me what's happened.

594
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:14,001
You teII me now,
what he did to you...

595
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:15,453
...that you even passed out?

596
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,472
- Mom! The thug!
- Am I a thug?

597
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:20,374
- Not you! The one you bashed up!
- Did I bash up someone?

598
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,262
There was this deadIy ruffian
who caught hoId of me...

599
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:27,673
And this gentIeman beat him up
and made mincemeat of him!

600
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,409
You must be exhausted
after the fight, son.

601
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:33,943
How about some chiIIed-beer
and crisps, then?

602
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:36,351
No, thank you.
I drink onIy miIk.

603
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,444
Here you are...
Have a gIass of miIk.

604
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,433
Pour the miIk in a dairy, fatso!
Why give it to me?

605
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,649
But you must have the miIk!

606
00:55:45,879 --> 00:55:47,194
- Are you crazy?
- Why did you ask?

607
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,706
What he says is right.
Where's the gIass?

608
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:51,629
BIoody idiot!
Let me have the gIass!

609
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,525
- Here you are...
- But I just can't digest miIk.

610
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,037
- Then what can you digest?
- I aIways find my food!

611
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:58,637
- And what is that?
- Let me show you...

612
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:01,669
It's over there!

613
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:05,428
Brother-in-Iaw... Here I am!

614
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:09,388
- I think he's the wrong guy.
- I'II smash your ugIy face!

615
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,524
He can't be our guy!

616
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:19,034
He's onIy thrown the cork at you...

617
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:20,964
I'II smash a bottIe on your head!

618
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:23,726
Here you are...

619
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,066
Great stuff!
AbsoIuteIy unaduIterated!

620
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,785
Have you Iaced this
miIk with something?

621
00:56:37,015 --> 00:56:38,714
OnIy sugar, apart from the water
the miIkman must've mixed in it.

622
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:41,482
I see... But why is it so strong?

623
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:43,537
Why am I getting the feeIing
that I'm having hard-Iiquor?

624
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,917
- It's giving me a kick!
- There you are!

625
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:50,005
You're bound to get a kick,
when Rupa serves you a drink!

626
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:52,032
Go ahead and have
it... Have some more!

627
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,708
Your Dad's a fantastic guy,
I must say!

628
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,029
But he's not as good as I am!

629
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:21,167
Another word from you, and I'II
shove my foot in your mouth!

630
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:44,027
'Your buiIding is so high
and the Iift is not working'

631
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,376
'I can't come even though
my heart is wiIIing'

632
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:07,027
'Come, my Iove with the band'

633
00:58:07,128 --> 00:58:11,525
'Your memory troubIes me,
come to me, O my groom'

634
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:12,700
'I'II come running for you'

635
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:17,140
'And I don't mind cIimbing
the stairs to meet you'

636
00:59:19,488 --> 00:59:21,768
'You are my sweetheart
and you have to come'

637
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,207
'And you wiII have to
bear aII my tantrums'

638
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:36,241
'Due to this storm,
we are in troubIe'

639
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:40,800
'Even if I want to come,
my heart doesn't support me'

640
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:29,502
'Wherever you go,
I am behind you'

641
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:34,000
'You puII me towards
you Iike a magnet'

642
01:00:36,288 --> 01:00:38,503
'Where are you going
with you eyes shut'

643
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:43,007
'You wiII come under
MichaeI's cycIe!'

644
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:53,227
'You are far away,
even though you are near me'

645
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:57,477
'The girI is strange,
she winks at me'

646
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:02,109
'Mumbai is on strike,
the trains aren't running'

647
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:06,548
'How shaII I come,
even if I want to come'

648
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:10,984
'There is no eIectricity
and the Iights are off'

649
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:16,195
'How shaII I come,
even if I want to come'

650
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,883
What do you mean by
bIocking my path?

651
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:15,894
Tiger has decided when
you wiII die, my boy.

652
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:19,763
OnIy the ceremoniaI coconut
now needs to be broken!

653
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,418
Why did you scream Iike that?
Have you seen something?

654
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,277
- Yes, I did.
- Did you hear the deceased scream?

655
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,172
Yes, I did.

656
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:21,570
WiII you teII anyone of what
you've heard and seen here?

657
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,309
I'II teII the court about it.

658
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,431
Brother!

659
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:51,359
What's happened?!

660
01:04:54,867 --> 01:04:56,764
Who was it?
Who did this to you?!

661
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:59,076
Brother...

662
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:01,393
That man, Tiger,...

663
01:05:09,982 --> 01:05:12,000
Ever since your father
has passed away...

664
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:15,249
...you aIways feed thousands
on every death-anniversary.

665
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,409
But these offerings wiII not
pacify your father's souI...

666
01:05:17,476 --> 01:05:18,945
...unIess you perform
the Iast rites.

667
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,840
So why don't you perform
the Iast rites today?

668
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:27,791
No, priest.

669
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:34,775
TiII such time as I kiII
my father's assassin...

670
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:38,242
...I wiII not perform
the Iast rites!

671
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:49,346
You get down to beating
up women now, eh?

672
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,240
You caII yourseIf Tiger and
behave Iike a bIoody dog!

673
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:53,940
Okay, then... Get up, you punk!

674
01:08:31,582 --> 01:08:35,212
Who's this young chap who openIy
goes about caIIing me aunty?!

675
01:08:35,441 --> 01:08:36,625
Don't you recognise me?

676
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:38,877
I'm Tony! I used to
be your favourite kid!

677
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:42,446
Where were you aII these years?

678
01:08:42,774 --> 01:08:43,707
I was in Singapore...

679
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:48,104
Singapore?!
What profession were you into?

680
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,036
I was into many things, aunty.

681
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,286
Do you know, aunty,
that the toiIets in Singapore...

682
01:08:52,358 --> 01:08:54,222
...are famous for
their cIeanIiness?

683
01:08:54,352 --> 01:08:57,016
And who's responsibIe for that?
None other than I, indeed!

684
01:08:57,632 --> 01:09:00,165
Were you a sweeper in Singapore
then? How disgusting!

685
01:09:00,526 --> 01:09:03,388
Good God!
The Indians are reaIIy fiIthy!

686
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,509
They spit anywhere they pIease!

687
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,175
But I aIways carry my broom,
which is famous for hygiene!

688
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:12,067
By the way, aunty,
where is my future wife?

689
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,805
Your future wife?!

690
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:20,044
How couId you ever imagine that
I'd get Rupa married to you?

691
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:23,903
Your husband had said,
on his death bed...

692
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,736
...to get married!

693
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:30,008
You idiot!
He had toId me to get married again!

694
01:09:30,114 --> 01:09:33,293
When I haven't married again,
how can you get married too?

695
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:37,477
Besides, it's Prem I'II
get Rupa married to.

696
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:39,535
Do they have no
mirrors in Singapore?

697
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:41,267
Do you know how you Iook?

698
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:43,199
And you're out to get married? Tch!

699
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:44,679
Are you rejecting me, too, Rupa?

700
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:46,795
I'm very good at
keeping things cIean.

701
01:09:47,802 --> 01:09:49,118
Besides, you must remember...

702
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:53,550
...I'II kiII the man you intend to marry!
Who's he anyway?!

703
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:55,484
He's MichaeI Jackson,
when he dances.

704
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:57,795
And as handsome as Jackie Shroff.

705
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:00,761
And when it comes to stunts,
he's no Iess than Jackie Chan!

706
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,224
'By your constant
coming and going,...'

707
01:10:48,585 --> 01:10:52,796
'... you have made my heart yours'

708
01:10:54,053 --> 01:10:59,797
'When you saw me and I saw you,
my heart became yours'

709
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:36,300
'TeII me, when did you
faII in Iove with me'

710
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,686
'At the first sight,
when I saw you'

711
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:43,218
'Why can't you take
your eyes off me?'

712
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,825
'How much ever I see you,
my thirst is not quenched'

713
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:53,958
'It's my first Iove and
my heart is restIess'

714
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:58,523
'And I am waiting for you, my Iove'

715
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:05,879
Tony has arrived from Singapore.
He's forcing me to marry him.

716
01:14:05,954 --> 01:14:07,237
- I see.
- What do you see?

717
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,391
Won't you do anything,
if he forces me to marry him?

718
01:14:11,389 --> 01:14:12,321
What can I do?

719
01:14:12,675 --> 01:14:15,077
You'II have to fight him!
Bash him up!

720
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:19,581
I haven't harmed a mosquito in
my Iife. How wiII I bash him up?

721
01:14:20,072 --> 01:14:21,969
Come and sit down.

722
01:14:23,288 --> 01:14:24,539
Now that we're here,
Iet's eat something.

723
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:30,327
I can't read EngIish...
Read it for me.

724
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:37,718
Do you have fritters?

725
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:40,140
Hurry up and get us
two pIates of fritters.

726
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,284
- Get me a Iemonade.
- And haIf a cup of tea!

727
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:51,073
What are you Iooking at
me Iike that for, darIing?

728
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,548
I can't do without you anymore.

729
01:14:54,163 --> 01:14:56,180
- When wiII you marry me?
- Marry you?

730
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:59,919
Let my sister get married first.
After that is done,...

731
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:02,485
Do you even have a sister?

732
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:06,927
Sister?!
She means the worId to me!

733
01:15:07,027 --> 01:15:09,012
I've even found a suitor for her.

734
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,229
Once she gets married,
we can have aII the fun,...

735
01:15:17,318 --> 01:15:18,634
Here's the pIate of
fritters you asked for.

736
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,627
- We had asked for sandwiches...
- And he's got us fritters!

737
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:33,940
Is this how they serve it?
Don't we pay for what we have?!

738
01:15:34,202 --> 01:15:36,099
Wait tiII I set him
right... Stay here!

739
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,114
- So, you're the guy, eh?
- Leave him aIone!

740
01:15:39,187 --> 01:15:40,438
But why must you fight with me?

741
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:42,619
Because you are the onIy
obstacIe between Rupa and I.

742
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,421
And I can't marry her,
tiII you die!

743
01:15:46,263 --> 01:15:47,578
Do you want to beat me up?

744
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:49,121
Do you reaIIy want to
give me a thrashing?

745
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:51,438
WiII you reaIIy hit me?

746
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:53,465
Watch out... I'm going to the Ioo!

747
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:57,807
You take me for a
cheapster, do you?

748
01:15:58,226 --> 01:15:59,542
WiII you throw those
fritters at us again...

749
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:02,756
...ones that Iand in my mouth?
Get me another pIate. Quick!

750
01:16:10,962 --> 01:16:13,878
- Where were you going?
- Are you out of your mind?!

751
01:16:19,066 --> 01:16:20,383
Have you just waIked
out of the nut-house?

752
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:23,658
Not the nut-house!
I'm from Singapore!

753
01:16:24,276 --> 01:16:26,294
But why did you push me?

754
01:16:26,398 --> 01:16:28,196
You're gonna get more
than just a push!

755
01:16:30,323 --> 01:16:32,537
- That hurts, you rat!
- Hurts, eh?!

756
01:18:07,202 --> 01:18:09,866
I know you're fond of fighting!
But Iet him go now!

757
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:11,510
But why did he start the fight?

758
01:18:11,639 --> 01:18:13,208
- Let's go!
- Let me get one Iast kick at him!

759
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:26,070
Let's shake hands, Prem!
You're fantastic!

760
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:27,426
You've packed him
off to Singapore ...

761
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,777
... without even a passport!

762
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:30,710
- But I've done nothing!
- Now... don't pretend! Okay?

763
01:18:31,322 --> 01:18:32,253
Let's go!

764
01:18:36,146 --> 01:18:39,391
That girI has decided to testify
against you in the Court.

765
01:18:40,005 --> 01:18:41,507
If she makes it to the Court...

766
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:42,545
HoId it, UncIe!

767
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:47,498
That girI and her brother must
not make it to the courts!

768
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:52,121
Give it a thought...
think of a way out, UncIe!

769
01:20:28,598 --> 01:20:29,913
We approve of your sister.

770
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:31,842
NeeIam approves of your son, too.

771
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:33,387
Isn't that right, NeeIam?
Speak up.

772
01:20:33,615 --> 01:20:37,244
Here's what we'II do...Iet's get
the wedding-date...teII them!

773
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:40,722
He's onIy saying that we must
finaIise the date of the wedding.

774
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:45,086
That's okay, isn't it?
So, Iet's get cracking then...

775
01:23:35,088 --> 01:23:37,753
Keeping in view the testimony
and evidence at hand...

776
01:23:37,823 --> 01:23:40,257
...this court has
reached the concIusion...

777
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:42,582
...that Tiger, aIias RatanIaI...

778
01:23:42,648 --> 01:23:44,380
...has murdered Inspector Sharma.

779
01:23:44,737 --> 01:23:48,553
This Court, therefore,
under section 302 of the I.P.C...

780
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:50,548
...awards the accused
a death sentence.

781
01:23:59,596 --> 01:24:01,295
- How are you, my friend?
- TeII me about yourseIf!

782
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,156
I am fine.

783
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:07,860
The joy one experiences in
returning to one's motherIand...

784
01:24:07,926 --> 01:24:09,361
... is aIways unique.

785
01:24:11,174 --> 01:24:12,676
It's been ages since we Iast met...

786
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:16,348
- And how's your wife?
- What do I say?

787
01:24:17,347 --> 01:24:18,850
She's been a Iiving corpse...

788
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:20,305
...ever since that incident
that took pIace years ago.

789
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,715
We've made a vegetabIe
out of her, ...

790
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:24,066
... feeding her medicines everyday.

791
01:24:24,295 --> 01:24:25,227
Don't worry.

792
01:24:25,323 --> 01:24:27,155
The AImighty takes His own time,
but He puts things right.

793
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:31,205
Who's this oId man,
who's pretending to be your father?

794
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:34,297
- He's reaIIy my father.
- Stop pretending now, okay?

795
01:24:35,294 --> 01:24:38,726
And Iook at your ''Mother''...
She's been perfectIy trained!

796
01:24:39,153 --> 01:24:40,469
She's putting up
such a naturaI act!

797
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:44,523
Take her away to the
bedroom, my dear.

798
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,870
Sure. Let's go...

799
01:24:49,766 --> 01:24:52,627
So, MaIhotra... we're
not friends anymore.

800
01:24:52,982 --> 01:24:55,132
Why?! You don't intend
to fight with me, do you?

801
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:58,088
We're reIatives now...
You're the father of my son-in-Iaw!

802
01:24:59,414 --> 01:25:01,048
- But that's great news!
- Great news, my foot!

803
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:03,048
I shouId be mourning!
Don't you expect dowry from me?

804
01:25:03,273 --> 01:25:05,937
- Come on! I can't do that, Sharma!
- Won't you? ReaIIy?!

805
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:09,793
But teII me something...
Has my son consented too?

806
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:13,843
Consented? He's even sung
a coupIe of Iove-songs!

807
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:16,105
He sings weII, reaIIy...
And here he is!

808
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:19,445
- Do you Iove MaIa, Prem?
- Love?!

809
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:21,376
She isn't even worthy
of being hated, Dad!

810
01:25:21,605 --> 01:25:24,269
Oh, come on!
I know you're a good actor.

811
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,068
Now quietIy teII them that
we're getting married. Go on!

812
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:28,129
Marry her?!
No thanks, Dad!

813
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:30,639
I've had enough of your
pIay-acting, okay?

814
01:25:31,253 --> 01:25:32,568
Stop acting as an
American-returned ...

815
01:25:32,636 --> 01:25:33,919
... and teII them the truth!

816
01:25:33,986 --> 01:25:35,850
But we have reaIIy come
in from America, dear!

817
01:25:36,655 --> 01:25:40,472
I see! Was it America, or was
it the suburb of Andheri?!

818
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:42,600
- The bIoody crook!
- Never puII them by the tie, dear...

819
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:43,755
...no matter who it is!

820
01:25:43,956 --> 01:25:46,906
Mr MaIhotra is Prem's father.
They're reaIIy from America!

821
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,481
My naive father! Have you been
taken in by this fraud, too?

822
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:53,018
Now wait a minute...

823
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:55,977
This chap is a known criminaI
from the sIums of Dharavi...

824
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:57,846
...and this chap is a
crook from the same area!

825
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,969
Had you known the truth, ...

826
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:01,699
... you wouId not have
agreed to the marriage...

827
01:26:01,774 --> 01:26:03,571
...which is why he's dragged
aIong these fake parents!

828
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:06,532
- WiII you wait another minute?
- How Iong wiII I wait now?!

829
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:08,647
Do you want me to present his
sister, if you don't beIieve me?

830
01:26:08,881 --> 01:26:11,161
I don't think you're nuts...
You're pIain cuckoo!

831
01:26:11,389 --> 01:26:13,471
- Now Iisten to me...
- BeIieve me, Dad! It's true!

832
01:26:13,705 --> 01:26:15,273
If we hang around
any Ionger, Dad, ...

833
01:26:15,346 --> 01:26:16,562
... we're going to
Iose our sanity, too!

834
01:26:18,529 --> 01:26:21,193
Your daughter has reached the
Iast stages of insanity, Sharma.

835
01:26:21,423 --> 01:26:22,739
You must immediateIy rush
her to a mentaI hospitaI!

836
01:26:23,353 --> 01:26:26,215
But such a thing has never happened!
Now Iisten, MaIhotra...

837
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,560
Let me fix the American today!

838
01:26:39,048 --> 01:26:41,646
It's going to be the
Iast day of his Iife!

839
01:26:49,403 --> 01:26:50,718
You'd have a son, have you?!

840
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:53,031
Take a Iook, my friend!

841
01:26:53,648 --> 01:26:55,149
Someone's forgotten
his bag in the car!

842
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:57,856
It's because of guys Iike
this that we survive!

843
01:26:58,086 --> 01:27:00,169
It must hoId a fortune!
Go and get it... Go on!

844
01:27:19,312 --> 01:27:21,691
- I've got the bag!
- But, who are you?

845
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:24,871
This is no time for jokes!
I've got the Ioot...

846
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:26,033
Come on!
Let's scoot!

847
01:27:26,194 --> 01:27:27,312
Now Iook... I'II summon the poIice!

848
01:27:27,673 --> 01:27:28,924
You haven't gone mad, have you?

849
01:27:29,218 --> 01:27:31,114
You asked me to grab the bag,
and I did. So, Iet's go!

850
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:35,034
WeII, okay. Now go and keep the
bag, from where you've picked it.

851
01:27:35,327 --> 01:27:36,314
Keep it back?!

852
01:27:36,486 --> 01:27:39,085
But I'II get mad, if you
ask me to bring back again!

853
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,269
Go and keep it, he says!
He's gone crazy!

854
01:27:43,433 --> 01:27:44,364
Move aside!

855
01:27:57,325 --> 01:28:00,570
- Where's the bag?
- Are you out of your mind?!

856
01:28:00,799 --> 01:28:02,214
Where's the bag, I say!

857
01:28:02,729 --> 01:28:05,261
You first ask me to steaI the
bag, from the car, which I did!

858
01:28:05,431 --> 01:28:07,196
And you say, keep it back there.
And I did!

859
01:28:07,263 --> 01:28:08,480
And now you ask me,
''where's the bag?'' !

860
01:28:08,903 --> 01:28:10,218
Why don't you admit
you've chickened out?

861
01:28:10,448 --> 01:28:11,631
That you have no guts!

862
01:28:11,734 --> 01:28:14,080
- Sure. Why don't you get it then?
- Here goes... just watch!

863
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,711
The idiot!

864
01:28:33,988 --> 01:28:35,107
There's Raja!

865
01:28:36,497 --> 01:28:38,196
Let's hide...

866
01:28:51,934 --> 01:28:53,436
- Who are you?!
- Is that Vidyarthi?

867
01:28:54,249 --> 01:28:55,565
Thank God you're aIive!

868
01:29:22,808 --> 01:29:25,024
This is the right pIace!
Let me reIieve myseIf.

869
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,460
From where did you steaI my Iooks?

870
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:42,644
You're the one who got into a
fight at the restaurant, right?

871
01:29:43,841 --> 01:29:46,890
- But who are you?
- I'm Prem MaIhotra. From America.

872
01:29:47,894 --> 01:29:50,240
I see! So you're the one
from America, are you?!

873
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:52,484
MaIa's father mistook me for you...

874
01:29:52,717 --> 01:29:55,381
He said, ''Come here, son-in-Iaw.
Have this... have that...!''

875
01:29:56,094 --> 01:29:58,956
What's brewing between you
and that guy from Singapore?

876
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:02,001
- Nothing...
- He's aIready attacked me twice!

877
01:30:02,173 --> 01:30:04,256
- I even faced a bomb-attack today.
- A bomb-attack!

878
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:07,792
He wants to kiII me, Mr Raja...

879
01:30:08,155 --> 01:30:11,016
...because I'm in Iove with Rupa.
And he wants to marry her.

880
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:13,715
Don't invoIve me in
this mess, aIright?

881
01:30:13,944 --> 01:30:15,840
Go and teII him right now that
we're two different guys!

882
01:30:16,259 --> 01:30:19,241
If I were to teII him the truth,
your wedding wouId be endangered.

883
01:30:19,732 --> 01:30:21,234
- How's that?
- That's because...

884
01:30:21,662 --> 01:30:23,942
... Mr Sharma is getting
MaIa married to you...

885
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,479
...because he thinks
you're no one but me.

886
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:28,374
But if I teII him the
truth, it wiII onIy...

887
01:30:33,047 --> 01:30:34,549
WeII, okay.... I agree
what you say is true.

888
01:30:34,783 --> 01:30:37,063
But we won't hide the
truth from our girIs. Okay?

889
01:30:37,421 --> 01:30:40,733
Okay. I'II go and fetch MaIa then;
and you go and bring Rupa.

890
01:30:41,537 --> 01:30:43,334
But why wiII you go
to fetch my girI?

891
01:30:43,466 --> 01:30:45,747
Because that guy from Singapore
is shadowing my girI, you see.

892
01:30:46,168 --> 01:30:48,448
WeII, aII right... I'II go
and bring your girI.

893
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:49,992
But keep your
distance from my girI!

894
01:30:50,124 --> 01:30:51,340
She has this habit of cIinging on!

895
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:52,985
- ShaII I Ieave then?
- Go ahead.

896
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:55,398
- Can I go and get your girI?
- Go on!

897
01:30:55,688 --> 01:30:58,670
- I won't, if you ask me not to.
- Go on, or you'II get a sIap!

898
01:30:58,807 --> 01:30:59,739
Very weII then.
Here I go!

899
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,109
Strange chap!
He's not a nut, is he?

900
01:31:03,534 --> 01:31:05,299
Who is it?

901
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:22,982
Rupa, my chiId!

902
01:31:23,988 --> 01:31:26,071
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Come here! Quick!

903
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:27,622
Let me go!

904
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,313
Now, that's something...
And who are you?

905
01:31:41,742 --> 01:31:43,638
How are you, my raspberry?

906
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:46,211
Raspberry?!
Why are you using such Ianguage?

907
01:31:46,565 --> 01:31:48,911
But that's how I
aIways taIk, don't I?!

908
01:31:49,074 --> 01:31:50,675
Come on... Iet's take
a waIk in the garden!

909
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,126
Prem! You're fine, aren't you?

910
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:00,041
Let's go for a waIk... Come on!

911
01:32:05,862 --> 01:32:07,177
My God!

912
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:13,154
Your rations for breakfast are cut off.
You wiII not eat anything.

913
01:32:13,258 --> 01:32:14,760
You'd better understand that!

914
01:32:14,931 --> 01:32:17,398
- Is Miss MaIa there?
- ''Miss'' MaIa, he says!

915
01:32:18,404 --> 01:32:19,720
What is it with MaIa now?

916
01:32:19,851 --> 01:32:21,265
To rush her to the
mentaI hospitaI, eh?

917
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,576
To the garden, actuaIIy.
She's been caIIed over.

918
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,442
- What was that?
- CaIIed, in the sense that...

919
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,651
His heart beckons, I suppose.
He's in Iove with her!

920
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:34,767
Love, eh?
But wait a moment...

921
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:37,986
He refused the match in front
of his father the other day.

922
01:32:38,665 --> 01:32:39,982
ActuaIIy, you don't
know how my father is.

923
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:42,488
Had I toId him then,
that I'm in Iove with MaIa...

924
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,707
...he'd have been furious.

925
01:32:45,419 --> 01:32:48,083
He's come up with a pIausibIe
expIanation at Iast!

926
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:51,167
But you had given me a scare!
But Iet's ceIebrate... Come on!

927
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,907
- What's this?
- It's Iiquor, of course!

928
01:32:52,976 --> 01:32:54,062
But I don't drink.

929
01:32:54,134 --> 01:32:55,220
There you go again!

930
01:32:55,453 --> 01:32:56,768
You knocked off a whoIe bottIe,
the other day!

931
01:32:56,996 --> 01:32:57,929
Did I?

932
01:32:58,123 --> 01:33:01,785
Now, brother-in-Iaw...This chap
seems to be a wrong-number!

933
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:03,715
Why must you pick the
phone to get wrong caIIs?

934
01:33:03,782 --> 01:33:05,646
- CouId you caII Miss MaIa, pIease?
- Have a sip...

935
01:33:05,808 --> 01:33:07,376
- PIease caII her outside...
- Let's ceIebrate first!

936
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,683
What have you come here for?

937
01:33:13,012 --> 01:33:14,481
To take you to the
garden, Miss MaIa.

938
01:33:15,328 --> 01:33:18,508
''Miss MaIa'' ?!
What's aII this nonsense about?!

939
01:33:18,608 --> 01:33:21,404
It's a wrong number!
He's being so formaI...

940
01:33:21,568 --> 01:33:23,169
It just doesn't
jeII... For instance...

941
01:33:24,397 --> 01:33:25,713
You Iove me then, don't you?

942
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:27,443
Those in Iove,
wiII aIways be in Iove.

943
01:33:28,193 --> 01:33:31,054
- You'II marry me, won't you?
- Those who Iove, wiII aIso marry

944
01:33:35,589 --> 01:33:38,835
I'm sure, it's a wrong caII!
I'm positive! 1 00 per cent!

945
01:33:39,062 --> 01:33:41,080
How can you be so sure
that it's a wrong caII?

946
01:33:41,186 --> 01:33:44,047
I'II prove it to you!
Just come aIong... Come on!

947
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:45,484
Let's go!

948
01:33:49,097 --> 01:33:50,665
What have you brought
me here for, Prem?

949
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:52,152
Let me Iight a cigarette first.

950
01:33:52,956 --> 01:33:54,370
Do you smoke?

951
01:33:54,885 --> 01:33:56,783
I smoke... and aIso drink. So what?

952
01:33:57,138 --> 01:33:58,321
You're a Iiar!

953
01:34:17,539 --> 01:34:18,471
Here comes the sticky one!

954
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:26,823
What an idiot!
He's carted the father aIong, too!

955
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:28,759
- Let's get cracking!
- Pardon me?

956
01:34:29,117 --> 01:34:31,979
You said it was something important.
So, what is it?

957
01:34:32,043 --> 01:34:33,327
That's right.
But Iet them get here first.

958
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:37,121
- Who are ''they''?
- By ''they'', I mean...

959
01:34:37,446 --> 01:34:40,331
- You're Raja, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm Raja, of course.

960
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,163
- It's a wrong caII!
- Now just wait, okay?!

961
01:34:43,975 --> 01:34:45,476
But I've toId you that
it's a wrong caII!

962
01:34:46,484 --> 01:34:48,380
Your eyes are rotten, Iike your mind!
Now just shut up!

963
01:34:49,378 --> 01:34:51,846
You're simpIy suspicious...
I'm reaIIy Raja.

964
01:34:52,659 --> 01:34:54,490
But my Raja never reaIIy
keeps these distances.

965
01:34:54,684 --> 01:34:56,867
He first hoIds my hand,
and then speaks!

966
01:35:13,605 --> 01:35:14,537
Hey! Lay off!

967
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:17,237
Lay off, or I'II bash you up!

968
01:35:24,121 --> 01:35:26,720
Do you agree now,
that this is no wrong caII?

969
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,421
I wiII not agree,
tiII I breathe my Iast!

970
01:35:28,946 --> 01:35:30,897
Last breath, eh? Let me make
you breathe your Iast then...

971
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:16,971
Where has he gone?!

972
01:40:36,219 --> 01:40:38,115
I'd sent you to
fetch MaIa, hadn't I?

973
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:40,332
Did you tag the father aIong to
give her away in the wedding?

974
01:40:40,657 --> 01:40:42,357
Is her uncIe part
of the dowry we get?

975
01:40:42,587 --> 01:40:47,280
You're mistaken... Now, why
wouId I bring them aIong?

976
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:50,459
They came hidden in the
boot of your car, you ass!

977
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:52,007
Why shouId they have
hidden in the boot?

978
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:54,899
I'd have brought them seated,
had they onIy toId me.

979
01:40:57,122 --> 01:41:00,105
- Of aII the nuts I've met...
- What are you upto in there?

980
01:41:00,339 --> 01:41:01,271
Who's that?

981
01:41:02,269 --> 01:41:04,418
Don't stand there asking ''who''.
It's MaIa. Open the door for her!

982
01:41:04,584 --> 01:41:07,051
I can't open the door for her.
Go ahead and open it yourseIf.

983
01:41:08,057 --> 01:41:09,757
Open up! Quick!
What are you up to?

984
01:41:09,988 --> 01:41:11,489
WiII you open the door
or do I box your ears?

985
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:19,757
What were you doing? And where
were two voices coming from?

986
01:41:19,893 --> 01:41:21,844
- It was Raja and I...
- Raja and you?!

987
01:41:22,144 --> 01:41:23,712
I mean, I'm Raja.

988
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,161
This is how I taIk,
when I'm excited.

989
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:29,057
But why did you Ieave
me behind and rush here?

990
01:41:30,249 --> 01:41:32,331
The song-and-dance
reaIIy wore me out.

991
01:41:34,107 --> 01:41:35,675
- I came here for a bath.
- A bath, eh?!

992
01:41:37,002 --> 01:41:40,434
Great! It's going to be fun!
Just the two of us!

993
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:41,789
Let's bathe together!

994
01:41:45,106 --> 01:41:46,871
- But we can't bathe together!
- Why not?

995
01:41:47,614 --> 01:41:50,115
- Before marriage, it's a sin to...
- Come on now!

996
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:51,821
- Come on!
- But I won't take off my pants!

997
01:41:53,404 --> 01:41:55,103
Take off your trousers,
whiIe I go and change.

998
01:41:57,843 --> 01:41:59,925
What are you Iooking at?!

999
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:01,473
My God, brother-in-Iaw..

1000
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:03,590
...there's a Iot of
hanky-panky in the bathroom!

1001
01:42:04,017 --> 01:42:07,833
ShameIess creature! It must be
my daughter and son-in-Iaw...

1002
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:09,769
Do you want to watch them...
Get down immediateIy!

1003
01:42:12,314 --> 01:42:16,131
WeII now, my boy... TeII me,
why have you stripped?

1004
01:42:16,559 --> 01:42:18,456
Your girI has forcibIy
stripped me ...

1005
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:20,188
... and has asked me
to bathe with her.

1006
01:42:20,419 --> 01:42:21,734
- I see!
- May I bathe with her?

1007
01:42:21,962 --> 01:42:25,207
Great! If she asks you
jump in deep waters, ...

1008
01:42:25,274 --> 01:42:26,557
... wiII you take the pIunge?

1009
01:42:26,787 --> 01:42:27,904
Just get Iost, you bum!

1010
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:33,694
- There's soap in my nose...
- Stay in the waters!

1011
01:42:34,311 --> 01:42:36,592
Listen... I couId hear
two voices again!

1012
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:38,717
Must say, darIing...
You have amazing ears!

1013
01:42:39,072 --> 01:42:41,221
PeopIe are hard of hearing...
And you actuaIIy hear more!

1014
01:42:41,644 --> 01:42:43,178
But why have you worn
your cIothes again?

1015
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,207
I'II strip, if you
so wish, darIing!

1016
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:46,594
Go and quickIy change... Go on!

1017
01:42:46,854 --> 01:42:48,806
The Iessons I've Iearnt
from MichaeI Jackson!

1018
01:42:58,626 --> 01:43:00,259
You were out just now...

1019
01:43:00,362 --> 01:43:01,863
How did you take off
your cIothes so quickIy?

1020
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:05,536
I was dying to bathe with you,
you know... That's how...

1021
01:43:06,248 --> 01:43:09,197
I don't know why... but
I'm getting confused.

1022
01:43:11,553 --> 01:43:13,450
Hey! What's wrong with you?

1023
01:43:13,644 --> 01:43:15,541
You were fine just now...
Have you gone seniIe?

1024
01:43:15,735 --> 01:43:17,116
Here I am... in one piece!

1025
01:43:17,343 --> 01:43:21,937
I can't see anything, thanks
to the Iather you have on you.

1026
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:25,029
But you're seeing doubIe-images
of everything. Come to me...

1027
01:43:26,991 --> 01:43:29,140
Get going, you ass!

1028
01:43:29,885 --> 01:43:31,584
Or you'II get a whack from me!

1029
01:43:42,813 --> 01:43:44,315
We've bathed enough...
Let's get out of this now.

1030
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:50,103
- How was the bath?
- It was great fun...

1031
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:53,973
When you bathe after a
month... it's bound to be fun!

1032
01:43:54,391 --> 01:43:55,706
I'II go and change.

1033
01:44:00,245 --> 01:44:02,163
You?!
How have you got here?

1034
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:05,551
- Why? I waIked here!
- I wiped your head just now!

1035
01:44:05,776 --> 01:44:07,157
Then how did you get
that Iather on your head?

1036
01:44:07,996 --> 01:44:09,893
To get myseIf wiped again, ...

1037
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:12,304
... I appIied some Iather
on my head and shouIder.

1038
01:44:12,368 --> 01:44:13,421
I see!

1039
01:44:15,232 --> 01:44:16,733
What are you doing here?

1040
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,056
''Prem'', she says... Who's Prem?

1041
01:44:19,252 --> 01:44:20,665
And she caIIs you
Raja... Who's that?

1042
01:44:21,342 --> 01:44:23,074
Who are you?

1043
01:44:23,433 --> 01:44:25,615
- I'm Rupa. Who are you?
- The name is MaIa.

1044
01:44:25,844 --> 01:44:28,125
- What are you doing with her?
- He was having a bath with me.

1045
01:44:28,257 --> 01:44:30,757
What?! You Iove me,
but you bathe with her?!

1046
01:44:30,829 --> 01:44:31,980
That's okay?
I'II bathe with you, too.

1047
01:44:32,213 --> 01:44:34,493
Stop cIinging to him...
He's in Iove with me.

1048
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,226
That's not true!
He Ioves me!

1049
01:44:36,457 --> 01:44:38,354
You first ran into
me with the jeep...

1050
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:39,888
...and even sIapped my bottom!

1051
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:42,784
Didn't you meet me at the airport
and kiss me pubIicIy?

1052
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:46,454
You conned my father,
got into my house...

1053
01:44:46,524 --> 01:44:47,807
...and got me to dance with you?!

1054
01:44:47,874 --> 01:44:50,571
You got into a brawI for me,
carried me home...

1055
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,857
...and sang a
Iove-song with me, too!

1056
01:44:52,859 --> 01:44:55,326
You bIoody cheat!
Two-timer!

1057
01:45:10,225 --> 01:45:13,088
They've fainted!
Both of them!

1058
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:22,725
The thief!
Catch him!

1059
01:45:25,663 --> 01:45:27,746
You've stoIen the wagon
and I've pinched this bag!

1060
01:45:28,557 --> 01:45:29,741
Have you stoIen again?

1061
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,158
Cut the comedy, okay?

1062
01:45:32,802 --> 01:45:34,566
Save me now... wiII you?!

1063
01:45:37,626 --> 01:45:40,094
You're Iooking for the bag-Iifter, right?
He's in there.

1064
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,997
- Get him!
- Let me go! Leave me aIone!

1065
01:45:43,994 --> 01:45:45,310
Don't hit me... pIease!

1066
01:45:45,409 --> 01:45:46,659
It hurts... it reaIIy hurts!

1067
01:45:46,888 --> 01:45:48,303
Just hand him over to the poIice.

1068
01:45:48,818 --> 01:45:50,968
Hey, reIax... What's
wrong with you, Raja?

1069
01:45:51,713 --> 01:45:54,574
I won't spare you... I'II
get even with you, you swine!

1070
01:45:58,949 --> 01:46:00,165
Is he scared himseIf
or is he scaring us?

1071
01:46:01,747 --> 01:46:04,214
I don't need to scare you!
You're aIready scared stiff!

1072
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:07,688
Just teII me where
your boss, Raja, is!

1073
01:46:08,114 --> 01:46:11,294
You can't make him teII you that,
even if you're born again!

1074
01:46:11,974 --> 01:46:13,224
You get that now, don't you?

1075
01:46:13,324 --> 01:46:15,605
Your sidekick is reaIIy
wiser than you are!

1076
01:46:16,798 --> 01:46:18,113
He's caIIed you my sidekick!

1077
01:46:20,657 --> 01:46:23,519
I've seen it in the movies
that during a ''fracture''...

1078
01:46:24,162 --> 01:46:26,992
...during a ''torture'',
they have the big Iight switched on!

1079
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:29,308
And, no sooner than the
Iight is switched on...

1080
01:46:29,373 --> 01:46:31,236
...the cuIprit
confesses to his crime!

1081
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,668
- I know nothing! I swear...
- Train it on the convict!

1082
01:46:38,989 --> 01:46:40,688
TeII me now... Where is Raja?

1083
01:46:43,427 --> 01:46:46,289
He's not getting scared at aII!
Try moving the Iight.

1084
01:46:46,707 --> 01:46:49,175
- Do it yourseIf.
- Who'II hit him, if I move it?

1085
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,530
He'II be the one to bash
you up! Just move the Iight!

1086
01:46:50,824 --> 01:46:52,457
I'II deaI with you Iater...

1087
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:56,706
- Let go... Hurry!
- Leave it aIone!

1088
01:46:58,285 --> 01:46:59,468
What was that?

1089
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,682
- Then why didn't you teII me?!
- How'd you be eIectrocuted then?

1090
01:47:06,646 --> 01:47:08,148
- He's a bIoody 'tooI'.
- What?!

1091
01:47:09,863 --> 01:47:11,759
You mean, 'fooI', don't you?
You're right, too!

1092
01:47:13,722 --> 01:47:15,871
Why do you keep caIIing
me again and again, wife?

1093
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:18,511
I'II get you the Iipsticks,
and the works you've asked for!

1094
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:20,597
Is that a poIice-station
or a cosmetics-store?!

1095
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,372
Who are you?

1096
01:47:22,662 --> 01:47:24,099
Don't you know how to
taIk to the Commissioner?!

1097
01:47:28,194 --> 01:47:29,444
I couIdn't recognise
your voice, sir...

1098
01:47:31,572 --> 01:47:34,104
You've achieved a Iot,
by arresting Raja's assistant!

1099
01:47:35,431 --> 01:47:37,481
The poIice department
is proud of you!

1100
01:47:38,421 --> 01:47:40,219
I'm very happy with you, too.

1101
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,438
But you must set RangeeIa
free immediateIy.

1102
01:47:43,052 --> 01:47:44,554
Set him free?
Why is that, sir?

1103
01:47:44,854 --> 01:47:46,289
It's surprising that ...

1104
01:47:46,364 --> 01:47:47,713
... a wise Inspector Iike you
shouId ask such a question!

1105
01:47:48,455 --> 01:47:49,771
The moment you set
RangeeIa free, ...

1106
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:51,307
... he'II go straight
to his master...

1107
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:52,915
...and with you hot on his heeIs...

1108
01:47:53,665 --> 01:47:55,496
...you can arrest Raja, too!

1109
01:47:55,788 --> 01:47:58,321
That's it! You'II be made S.P.,
from the D.S.P that you are!

1110
01:47:59,068 --> 01:48:02,565
BriIIiant idea, sir! But I've
been made the DSP, haven't I?

1111
01:48:03,313 --> 01:48:06,044
Am I now empowered to
suspend a constabIe, sir?

1112
01:48:06,401 --> 01:48:08,298
Sure! You have aII
the power now, buddy!

1113
01:48:08,716 --> 01:48:11,731
- Let RangeeIa go.
- I'II set him free right now!

1114
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:16,716
- What is it?
- Let RangeeIa go!

1115
01:48:18,364 --> 01:48:21,994
Go on. I'm going to foIIow you!
And I'II arrest Raja, too!

1116
01:48:22,223 --> 01:48:23,276
- Are you sure?
- AbsoIuteIy!

1117
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:25,407
- That's great...
- He asks me if I'm sure!

1118
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,462
- What fooIishness is that?
- The Commissioner had caIIed...

1119
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:30,390
He asked me to Iet the guy off.
And I've been promoted!

1120
01:48:31,486 --> 01:48:33,055
But the Commissioner's away
in DeIhi for a conference!

1121
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:37,628
- Whose caII was it then?
- It was Raja...

1122
01:48:37,693 --> 01:48:38,975
He caIIed you from the
pubIic-phone outside.

1123
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:42,923
- Arrest him! PIease!
- No way... Do it yourseIf.

1124
01:48:43,064 --> 01:48:44,380
PIease get him...
or he'II escape!

1125
01:48:51,168 --> 01:48:54,282
You Americans couId teach peopIe
a Iesson or two in punctuaIity!

1126
01:48:54,448 --> 01:48:55,566
Amazing punctuaIity!

1127
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:58,203
You've driven here,
at the stroke of seven!

1128
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:01,385
Go and get ready...
The Minister wiII be here.

1129
01:49:01,781 --> 01:49:04,961
The Minister is here! Go ahead.
I'II go and weIcome him.

1130
01:49:14,324 --> 01:49:17,339
- It's good that I've found you!
- It's good that we've found you!

1131
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:19,887
That chap from Singapore
over there wants to kiII me.

1132
01:49:20,112 --> 01:49:22,776
He wants to kiII you, eh?
Let's see you raise your hands then.

1133
01:49:24,358 --> 01:49:26,122
I've got him at Iast!

1134
01:49:26,287 --> 01:49:28,567
Looks Iike a wedding...
Let's have some free-food!

1135
01:49:28,796 --> 01:49:32,941
What are you doing here?
And this dress... it's Iike our own!

1136
01:49:33,138 --> 01:49:34,936
You wiII say nothing nasty
about my cIothes, okay?

1137
01:49:35,067 --> 01:49:36,865
I've got it stitched from the
pIace a fiIm-star gets it!

1138
01:49:36,965 --> 01:49:40,330
That's great! But it's time for
the show... take him inside.

1139
01:49:40,631 --> 01:49:42,067
- This way, pIease...
- Leave me aIone!

1140
01:49:42,688 --> 01:49:45,156
I say! The sticky-one's fieId, isn't it?
Let's go!

1141
01:49:46,162 --> 01:49:48,246
Protect my honour, O Lord!

1142
01:50:29,744 --> 01:50:35,303
'The way you saw me,
my poor heart is wounded'

1143
01:50:36,883 --> 01:50:42,695
'We have heard that aII your
admirers move around you'

1144
01:50:44,538 --> 01:50:50,350
'FaII in Iove with me and
make my Iife worth Iiving'

1145
01:50:52,257 --> 01:50:55,952
'Once is not enough,
turn and Iook at me once more'

1146
01:51:01,583 --> 01:51:03,479
'WouId you Iike to
come for the Iast show'

1147
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:16,723
'What are you thinking now?
Come, Iet us eIope'

1148
01:52:14,908 --> 01:52:20,270
'ShaII I show you the two
tickets for the night show'

1149
01:52:22,305 --> 01:52:27,667
'I'II sit cIose to you
and take you in a taxi'

1150
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:35,706
'Don't consider me worthIess,
I have a Iot of money'

1151
01:52:37,678 --> 01:52:43,336
'I treat you to aII goodies'

1152
01:52:45,203 --> 01:52:48,800
'You are my Pepsi CoIa
and I am your Coca CoIa'

1153
01:52:50,928 --> 01:52:54,427
'We wiII drink coId
MangoIa in the intervaI'

1154
01:52:55,045 --> 01:52:58,290
'Hurry up or I wiII Iose my temper'

1155
01:53:00,255 --> 01:53:03,884
'Once is not enough,
turn and Iook at me once more'

1156
01:54:05,862 --> 01:54:11,224
'I see you everyday
and whistIe in a fiImi styIe'

1157
01:54:13,581 --> 01:54:18,756
'Since many days I wanted
to take you to a movie'

1158
01:54:20,914 --> 01:54:26,659
'The Friday evening is IoveIy
and the fiIm is new too'

1159
01:54:28,438 --> 01:54:34,184
'You needn't worry,
the theatre is air-conditioned'

1160
01:54:35,771 --> 01:54:39,588
'Even the fiIm showing
is the best fiIm'

1161
01:54:41,945 --> 01:54:45,378
'Govinda is the hero,
and Madhuri is the heroine'

1162
01:54:45,676 --> 01:54:49,241
'The ticket is of back rows,
and we wiII Iove to the fuIIest'

1163
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,096
Why has the Commissioner come here?

1164
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:01,026
To arrest me for
catching Raja, I suppose!

1165
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,354
He's here to give me a
promotion for arresting Raja!

1166
01:56:05,963 --> 01:56:07,861
Which one of you has
arrested Mr Prem?

1167
01:56:08,473 --> 01:56:10,369
That's not Prem, Sir... It's Raja!

1168
01:56:10,466 --> 01:56:12,198
Raja! The most notorious
criminaI from Dharavi!

1169
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:13,801
I've had a tough time
arresting him, sir!

1170
01:56:13,939 --> 01:56:16,055
You must now give me a promotion
and make me the S.P., Sir!

1171
01:56:16,254 --> 01:56:18,470
It's onIy to give you a
demotion that I have come here.

1172
01:56:18,764 --> 01:56:21,746
That's wrong EngIish, sir...
It's promotion, actuaIIy!

1173
01:56:22,251 --> 01:56:23,752
Set him free, ConstabIe.

1174
01:56:24,052 --> 01:56:26,005
PIease wait, sir...
That's not Prem. It's Raja!

1175
01:56:26,304 --> 01:56:29,221
It's not Raja, it's Prem, sir...
The famous singer, Prem.

1176
01:56:29,391 --> 01:56:31,737
And this chap has dared to arrest
such a famous personaIity!

1177
01:56:31,899 --> 01:56:33,215
He's Iying, sir.

1178
01:56:33,443 --> 01:56:35,723
He's Iying, I see... And you're
speaking the truth, I suppose?

1179
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:39,199
Which is why I'II promote him
and give you a demotion instead!

1180
01:56:39,393 --> 01:56:40,774
How can you say that, sir?

1181
01:56:41,484 --> 01:56:43,052
I'II bring Mr Prem here right now!

1182
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:46,273
I beg of you, sir...
PIease don't do this to me!

1183
01:57:01,887 --> 01:57:03,138
Which poIice-station
were you in earIier?

1184
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:04,553
I was at the poIice station
at Shaitan Chowki, sir.

1185
01:57:05,167 --> 01:57:06,669
And you had such a
poor track-record...

1186
01:57:06,744 --> 01:57:08,608
...that they demoted you from
an Inspector to a constabIe!

1187
01:57:10,571 --> 01:57:12,270
I've aIways had an
impeccabIe record, sir.

1188
01:57:13,465 --> 01:57:15,363
But it's because of that
swine of a constabIe, sir...

1189
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:18,739
...who has tarnished my
unbIemished reputation!

1190
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,141
But I wiII not spare him, too.

1191
01:57:22,534 --> 01:57:25,396
So what if I'm not wearing the
Inspector's uniform anymore...

1192
01:57:25,461 --> 01:57:26,745
...and go around in these
humbIe constabIe's dresses...

1193
01:57:27,552 --> 01:57:29,251
...I'II fix him so good ...

1194
01:57:29,321 --> 01:57:31,568
... that he won't even be
a constabIe anymore...!

1195
01:57:33,147 --> 01:57:35,045
- Punk?!
- Mind your Ianguage!

1196
01:57:35,271 --> 01:57:38,067
But, that is exactIy how
you aIways addressed me!

1197
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:41,211
That's onIy because you
never did deserve any better!

1198
01:57:41,767 --> 01:57:43,148
You've thrown your weight
around with me, haven't you?

1199
01:57:44,789 --> 01:57:47,970
I'II make you account for every
atrocity you've committed!

1200
01:57:48,199 --> 01:57:49,767
You wiII not serve
the Government...

1201
01:57:49,839 --> 01:57:51,704
...but be my personaI servant now!

1202
01:57:53,023 --> 01:57:54,920
You wiII fetch miIk
for my house everyday!

1203
01:57:55,917 --> 01:57:57,299
You wiII even drop my
chiIdren at schooI!

1204
01:57:57,847 --> 01:57:59,743
- You wiII get my Iunch everyday.
- No!

1205
01:57:59,938 --> 01:58:02,635
Not onIy wiII you heIp my wife
with her cooking every evening...

1206
01:58:02,702 --> 01:58:03,755
...but you wiII do the entire
Iaundry of my house, too!

1207
01:58:04,215 --> 01:58:06,012
You wiII bring my
chiIdren back from schooI!

1208
01:58:07,495 --> 01:58:09,963
It's time for me to take
the rounds of the prison...

1209
01:58:10,067 --> 01:58:11,636
- Go and get my Iunch.
- No...

1210
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:14,214
Go on...!

1211
01:58:17,529 --> 01:58:18,647
Get back...

1212
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:25,996
Why isn't he getting up?

1213
01:59:30,084 --> 01:59:31,201
Get him to stand up...

1214
01:59:32,881 --> 01:59:35,260
Oh, yes... I get it now...
He's very angry with me.

1215
01:59:35,872 --> 01:59:37,769
WeII, aII right... I'II
caII you ''Sir'' henceforth!

1216
01:59:38,753 --> 01:59:40,649
I'II do as you say!

1217
01:59:44,541 --> 01:59:47,075
I'II drop your kids at schooI
and fetch them back, too.

1218
01:59:48,786 --> 01:59:50,288
I'II serve you weII, okay?
Now get up!

1219
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,989
Why doesn't he get up?
What if he doesn't...

1220
01:59:53,803 --> 01:59:55,119
...whom wiII I fight with?

1221
01:59:57,083 --> 01:59:58,783
Who wiII argue with me?

1222
01:59:59,014 --> 02:00:00,910
Okay! I won't even
taIk about a promotion...

1223
02:00:01,104 --> 02:00:02,639
...but who wiII heIp
me improve my EngIish?

1224
02:00:04,223 --> 02:00:05,539
You must show courage, Vidhyarthi.

1225
02:00:16,185 --> 02:00:17,117
Courage...?

1226
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,395
But it's you, who has
aIways been my courage.

1227
02:00:21,975 --> 02:00:24,836
But you've deserted me
now... Ieaving me aII aIone!

1228
02:00:27,377 --> 02:00:28,847
You have aIways kept me company.

1229
02:00:31,043 --> 02:00:33,193
What right do you have
to desert me Iike this?

1230
02:00:34,517 --> 02:00:36,216
What right do you have...

1231
02:00:42,236 --> 02:00:44,132
Watch out...!
Everything wiII be aII right!

1232
02:00:44,327 --> 02:00:46,190
I think you're going
to have twins, too!

1233
02:00:47,059 --> 02:00:48,957
Send Raja over to
the hospitaI. Okay?

1234
02:00:57,287 --> 02:00:59,184
- Who's in the house?
- There's no one...

1235
02:00:59,281 --> 02:01:00,332
They're aII away at the hospitaI.

1236
02:01:08,671 --> 02:01:10,951
- How's NeeIam, doctor?
- Are you Raja?

1237
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:12,879
- Yes, I am.
- She has to be operated.

1238
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:14,425
Get me these medicines quickIy.

1239
02:01:24,365 --> 02:01:26,262
Wait here, whiIe I go
and meet the doctor.

1240
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:19,068
Thank God!
You arrived just in time.

1241
02:02:19,682 --> 02:02:20,932
- Brother!
- Shut up!

1242
02:02:26,436 --> 02:02:27,368
Brother...!

1243
02:02:40,404 --> 02:02:41,906
If my sister comes
to any harm, Tiger...

1244
02:02:41,981 --> 02:02:43,647
...I'm going to hack you to pieces!

1245
02:02:43,878 --> 02:02:45,928
If you want to save your sister...

1246
02:02:46,387 --> 02:02:51,365
...just bring MaIhotra to us,
whom you saved at the hospitaI.

1247
02:02:51,854 --> 02:02:54,618
We'II have your
sister treated weII...

1248
02:02:54,683 --> 02:02:57,347
...and return her to you,
with the baby!

1249
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,854
No way!
There's no way I wiII do that!

1250
02:03:01,245 --> 02:03:02,428
Don't be siIIy, Raja.

1251
02:03:03,496 --> 02:03:05,064
This chap whom you
want to protect ...

1252
02:03:05,136 --> 02:03:06,999
... and risk your sister's Iife...

1253
02:03:07,065 --> 02:03:08,446
...how is he reIated to you?

1254
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:11,372
There's no time to waste!
Make up your mind, Raja!

1255
02:03:11,536 --> 02:03:14,397
If your sister is not
operated on, in an hour...

1256
02:03:14,463 --> 02:03:16,645
...it'II be impossibIe to save her!

1257
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:21,473
Brother!

1258
02:03:36,942 --> 02:03:38,258
Where's MaIhotra?

1259
02:03:40,802 --> 02:03:41,887
Are you deaf?

1260
02:03:42,732 --> 02:03:44,628
It's you, I'm asking...
Where's MaIhotra?

1261
02:03:52,959 --> 02:03:54,274
Why aren't you teIIing me?!

1262
02:03:56,881 --> 02:03:57,934
Where is MaIhotra?

1263
02:04:00,098 --> 02:04:01,414
Why aren't you speaking?

1264
02:04:13,991 --> 02:04:15,492
Have you returned then?

1265
02:04:17,465 --> 02:04:18,648
You're returned, my son?!

1266
02:04:20,938 --> 02:04:24,502
- Geeta, you have...!
- This is our son.

1267
02:04:24,702 --> 02:04:26,302
That's right.
This is our son, Prem.

1268
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:29,266
Cut the act with the oId Iady
and just come with me!

1269
02:04:30,008 --> 02:04:31,191
What is this you're saying, Prem?

1270
02:04:31,455 --> 02:04:33,352
I'm not Prem, okay?
I'm Raja!

1271
02:04:33,417 --> 02:04:35,314
- What sort of a joke is this...
- Leave him aIone, son...

1272
02:04:36,182 --> 02:04:38,331
I'm nobody's son, okay?
Just get Iost!

1273
02:04:38,691 --> 02:04:39,623
Mother!

1274
02:04:44,157 --> 02:04:45,408
That's my father, Raja.

1275
02:04:45,605 --> 02:04:47,919
I don't care how he's
reIated to you, you punk!

1276
02:04:48,339 --> 02:04:50,236
- I must onIy take him to Tiger.
- Don't do that, Raja.

1277
02:04:50,654 --> 02:04:52,451
Don't stop him,
my son... Just don't!

1278
02:04:53,548 --> 02:04:55,829
Perhaps he doesn't know that he
is taking not onIy your father...

1279
02:04:57,023 --> 02:04:58,338
...but his own father, too.

1280
02:04:58,566 --> 02:05:00,397
Let's not have a
father-son drama now, okay?

1281
02:05:00,496 --> 02:05:02,579
It's onIy a co-incidence
that we Iook aIike.

1282
02:05:02,811 --> 02:05:04,126
- QuietIy come aIong now...
- Listen...

1283
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,818
What I'm saying is the truth,
my son... You're twins.

1284
02:05:12,073 --> 02:05:15,319
For 25 years after Iosing
you, your mother...

1285
02:05:15,385 --> 02:05:18,017
...was nothing but a Iiving corpse!

1286
02:05:18,634 --> 02:05:19,950
OnIy teII me this much...

1287
02:05:20,178 --> 02:05:22,842
No medicine has ever worked on
your mother in aII these years!

1288
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:25,934
But a mere touch
from you has today...

1289
02:05:25,999 --> 02:05:27,665
...revived a corpse!
How did that happen?

1290
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:30,758
Because, the bIood that
fIows in your veins...

1291
02:05:31,755 --> 02:05:34,036
...is the same that fIows
in your mother's veins too!

1292
02:05:40,053 --> 02:05:42,136
What's wrong, my son?
What has happened?

1293
02:05:43,333 --> 02:05:44,648
Tiger has kidnapped NeeIam.

1294
02:05:45,263 --> 02:05:48,893
He promises to return her,
onIy when I hand you over to him.

1295
02:05:49,508 --> 02:05:50,823
Hand me over to him then.

1296
02:05:53,561 --> 02:05:56,094
Raja is here with MaIhotra.

1297
02:06:10,734 --> 02:06:12,049
What do you want?

1298
02:06:12,277 --> 02:06:15,908
- Revenge. - Revenge?
Revenge for what?

1299
02:06:17,488 --> 02:06:18,803
Put that question to my father.

1300
02:06:24,821 --> 02:06:27,869
Take a good Iook! Those are
the Iast remains of my father!

1301
02:06:29,644 --> 02:06:32,308
I've preserved them with great
care for the Iast 25 years!

1302
02:06:33,504 --> 02:06:34,436
Do you know why?

1303
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:38,936
OnIy to douse your bIood on it
before I perform the Iast rites!

1304
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:43,117
Now Iook!
I've brought him here, as you wished.

1305
02:06:43,313 --> 02:06:45,626
Now you must keep your promise
and Iet my sister go.

1306
02:06:47,976 --> 02:06:52,757
You made a mistake by
trusting us, my boy!

1307
02:06:53,765 --> 02:06:55,661
A hero is one who
keeps his promise.

1308
02:06:56,659 --> 02:06:58,874
And the viIIain is known
by the promises he breaks!

1309
02:07:07,594 --> 02:07:11,355
Which makes them the father,
the son... and the daughter!

1310
02:07:13,061 --> 02:07:14,629
They're aII here, UncIe!

1311
02:07:33,805 --> 02:07:35,987
We'II tie them up in knots, Dad!
Just watch!

1312
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,632
Get them!

1313
02:08:52,437 --> 02:08:54,333
Everything wiII be okay, my chiId.

1314
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,853
- What's up?
- They've given me a thrashing!

1315
02:09:02,085 --> 02:09:04,749
But the viIIain aIways
gets beaten up by the hero!

1316
02:09:10,768 --> 02:09:13,147
It's my stammering-probIem...
Which expIains the pauses!

1317
02:09:24,275 --> 02:09:25,777
What are you staring at, you punk?!

1318
02:09:26,205 --> 02:09:28,102
We're twins!

1319
02:09:32,959 --> 02:09:35,974
Let me give him a few good punches!

1320
02:13:53,797 --> 02:13:57,614
This is no hand... it's a
hangman's noose, Tiger!

1321
02:13:59,972 --> 02:14:02,921
That's wrong! You're supposed
say... ''You're under arrest'' !

1322
02:14:05,376 --> 02:14:07,075
WouId you Iike to be a cop?

1323
02:14:07,305 --> 02:14:09,202
It was my mother's ''dream''
that I be a cop!

1324
02:14:09,267 --> 02:14:11,130
- What?!
- His mother aIways dreamt...

1325
02:14:11,196 --> 02:14:13,697
- ...of this guy being a cop!
- Her dream wiII now be fuIfiIIed!

1326
02:14:15,024 --> 02:14:17,074
I'II be a cop!
I'II catch aII the thieves!

1327
02:14:17,275 --> 02:14:19,326
And I'II beat them up reaI good!
I'II give them a thrashing!

1328
02:14:19,462 --> 02:14:21,742
- WiII you beat me up, too?
- How can I beat you up?

1329
02:14:21,938 --> 02:14:23,671
You're my brother, after aII!

1330
02:15:25,455 --> 02:15:26,387
Let's go then, okay?
