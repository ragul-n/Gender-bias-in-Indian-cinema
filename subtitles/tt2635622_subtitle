As the joint commissioner of Mumbai police,

3
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,708
I am present today before this committee,

4
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,541
to answer certain allegations against me,

5
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,708
for the decisions I have taken,

6
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,041
on that night.

7
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,708
I'm aware of that,

8
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,416
keeping in view the incidents of 26/11,

9
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,083
and the situations that arose due to it,

10
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,083
as per the constitution of
democratic India and its law,

11
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,333
and the laws of the state of
Maharashtra vested in it,

12
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,583
and by the administrative
powers of the police,

13
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,166
under which I am bound,

14
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:10,333
with that authority, I state
that every word of my testimony,

15
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:17,541
its details, meanings, sum ups, views,

16
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:24,875
and with regard to all evidence
connected to the 26/11 incident,

17
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,500
I will only speak the truth.

'On the 26th, fisherman Solanki..

19
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,875
Along with his four workers,

20
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:12,041
in search of "Lal Pari', a rare fish
which is found only in deep waters..

21
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,750
Had wandered really far.

00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,958
Balu.

23
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm planning to get my
son married next year.

24
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,416
Let me know if you've someone in mind.

25
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,375
Uncle.

26
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,375
Hitesh must be as old as me?

27
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,625
No, no, he is younger,

28
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,125
Dilip's just 20, and
Hitesh is a year younger.

29
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,000
I thought you already had
someone in mind for Dilip.

30
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,541
I had made plans but it didn't work out.

31
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,125
His mother wanted him to
concentrate on his studies,

32
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,041
and there's no way I could argue with her.

33
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,583
Amar,

34
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,916
I think we've crossed Kori Bunder,

35
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,125
we could be in Pakistani waters as well.

36
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
No, I don't think so.

37
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,583
There's no sight of 'Lal pari'

38
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,541
Let's wait and see for a while
then we'll turn around.

39
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
I say let's go back.

40
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,125
I don't want to end up in a Pakistani jail

41
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,000
Is that a patrol boat?

42
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,750
Looks like a trawler.

Have mercy, son.

131
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,875
Turn off the music.

132

Turn it off.

Where are you going, sir?

Hyderabad. - Hyderabad.

People come to Mumbai for
all kinds of work. Right.

139

But, it's become too congested.

140
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,958
Filled with tension. See
how they're driving.

141
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,083
But, Mumbai is life,

142

153
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,000
My work doesn't allow me..

154
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,041
..to come home any day before late night.

155
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,041
But on 26/11, I had no work in the office,

156
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,000
I was getting bored,

157
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,000
so I went home early at 9 pm.

158
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,750
At around 9.30,

159
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,208
as I was taking a shower.

160
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,083
The phone started ringing
in the living room.

161
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,833
What?

162
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,750
There was a call from the control-room.

163
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,166
When I said you were in the shower..

164
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,666
..the operator banged the phone down

165
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,666
Because, I am the Joint Commissioner,

166
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,000
it's the control-room
operator's responsibility,

167

to inform me about every
incident in the city.

168
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:42,541
He couldn't have asked me to
come out of the bathroom,

169
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:47,333
on a single information about a
firing report in Leopold Caf.

170
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,750
He wanted to..

171
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,208
..reconfirm the incident first.

172
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:59,208
And in that haste he
banged the phone down..

173
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:06,000
..which my wife thought was strange,
and thinking that I might take time,

174
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,541
knocked on my bathroom door.

175
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:17,708
As I came in to the living
room, all the three phones,

176

my mobile, my landline and
control-room hotline,

177

187
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,833
'the centre of attraction
for the entire country, '

188
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,708
'and not just Mumbai alone.'

189
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,083
'Every visitor who travels to Mumbai, '

190
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,375
'never misses seeing the Taj
Hotel and the Gateway.'

191
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:39,125
'By targeting that hotel, the
terrorists wanted to prove, '

192
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,125
'that there's no escape from them, '

193
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,666
'no matter where you hide.'

194
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,750
'Whether it's the Leopold, or the Taj.'

195
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,000
They shot the child through his head.

196
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,625
In today's world a 5 star hotel,

197
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:48,000
symbolises how much humans have
progressed from barbaric times.

198
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:52,291
And to see blood splattered
in its luxurious settings,

199
00:38:52,708 --> 00:39:00,708
and heaps of dead bodies on its
polished floor proves, that

200
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:09,125
humans can even today be more
barbaric than they were ever.

201
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:20,375
At around 9:30, when Taj
was being attacked,

202
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:26,000
'at the same time at, Mumbai's lifeline,

203
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:30,000
the Mumbai Railway's CST station..'

204
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:37,833
'where, people from all
over the country commute.'

205
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:42,833
'By attacking this place, they
wanted to spread terror, '

206
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:49,958
'in every corner of the
country, and not just Mumbai.'

207
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:45,750
Yes.

208
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:47,125
No, sir.

209
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,208
I'll send it day after tomorrow.

210
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,416
Yes, sir. Correct.

211
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,958
Yes, sir.

212
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,500
Okay, sir. Goodnight.

213
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,500
Sir, where's the platform? - That way.

214
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,333
On that side. - Oh, this way?

215
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,750
Yes. That way. - And, the ticket-counter?

216
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,541
This way. - This way?

217
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:15,958
Where's the chart been put up, sir?

218
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,375
That side. - That way?

219
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,875
Yes. - Thank you.

220
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,875
Listen carefully once again.

221
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,799
First throw a grenade so
that with that sound,

222
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:35,083
those sitting and lying down
in the hall will get up

223
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:38,041
And, that way we can shoot more people.

224
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,708
And remember,

225
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:47,125
don't take pity on even women...
and children... understood?

226
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,375
Sir, Shinde speaking from CST.

227
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,000
Someone's opened fire here with an AK-47.

228
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,208
Sir..

229
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,208
I couldn't believe my ears,

230
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,375
when I heard what happened at CST.

231
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,208
What are these people?

232
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,916
What kind of hatred is this?

233
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,875
Can you understand?

234
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,208
I can't.

235
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,041
What kind of barbarism is this?

236
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,750
Are they just plain insane...

237
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:06,125
who've been given a gun?

238
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:10,458
What faith allows you,

239
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:18,958
to kill, innocent children,

240
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:23,083
so brutally and so cruelly?

241
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,291
Then, I received news about the..

242
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:59,041
..attacks on Oberoi and Nariman House..

243
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:03,708
..and also about the blast
in a taxi at Vile Parle.

244
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:50,791
"Moments are passing by slowly.
My eyes are teary."

245
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,458
Not only about those various attacks,

246
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:07,166
I was listening to multiple
versions of each of those attacks.

247
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:14,416
And also rumours of attacks
in various other places.

248
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:25,166
The control room was receiving
thousands of calls,

249
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,291
I had no time to understand, verify

250
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:32,625
or act upon the information.

251
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,541
At a point my mind went numb.

252
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:20,708
"Human being is tormented
in the games of politics."

253
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:24,625
"Every path is foggy.."

254
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,333
My juniors were waiting for my orders,

255
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,416
and I didn't know what to say.

256
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,750
That's when I called the Home Secretary.

257
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:42,791
Sir, I don't know what to do,

258
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,291
we need outside help.

259
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,958
Are you sure? It's the
prestige of Mumbai Police!

260
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,208
Sir, fuck the prestige,

261
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,250
I am not saying whether we
can do or we cannot do,

262
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,833
I am saying I don't know what to do.

263
00:56:55,083 --> 00:57:00,541
In my 27 years of service,

264
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:04,875
me or any other police officer In Mumbai..

265
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:09,250
We always arrived at the scene of crime,
after the crime had already happened.

266
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:14,166
For the first time in my experience
we were facing a situation,

267
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,666
where a crime was still happening and
was getting bigger by the minute.

268
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,208
And to confront such a situation..

269
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:29,458
..we had neither the
training, nor the weapons.

270
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:34,541
And on top of that we were facing someone

271
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,541
who was not afraid of the police.

272
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:43,166
Because they came here
to just kill and die.

273
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,291
The Home Secretary started the proceedings,

274
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,958
to bring The NSG Commandoes from Delhi.

275
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:56,708
And then I received news that the
terrorists that left from CST,

276
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:59,750
were spotted in a lane
behind Cama Hospital.

277
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,458
Can I have some water?

278
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,166
One more?

279
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,250
Yes, I heard too.

280
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,815
I believe they attacked CST Station.

281
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Some people are saying that there
was firing at the Taj hotel too.

282
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,666
Why a hospital?

283
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,666
From the places where we fired,

284
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,541
the wounded will be taken to hospitals,

285
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,708
If we spread terror here too,

286
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:45,625
not just railway stations and hotels,

287
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,750
people will be scared
to go to hospitals too.

288
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:06,791
Geeta. Turn off the lights.

289
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:08,541
Turn off all the lights, quickly.

290
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,166
Don't fire for no reason.

291
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,541
Don't waste bullets?

292
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,500
Sir, we're here.

293
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,625
Lock it. Lock it, quickly.

294
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:25,416
Hide inside. Now.

295
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,000
Go now. - Okay, doctor.

296
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,376
What are you doing here?

297
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:33,958
Go inside. Come on.

298
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,041
Quickly.

299
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,000
Why... why did you kill him? - Shut up!

300
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,333
Where are the others?

301
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:10,041
I don't know. I just arrived on shift..

302
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,208
Tell me,

303
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:13,625
you're a doctor, aren't you?

304
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,916
You should know.

305
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,541
Tell me, or I will kill you.

306
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,333
I don't know. Believe me..

307
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:38,083
What happened?

308
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,875
The police are at the back gate.

309
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,791
Where's the main gate?

310
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,791
Where's the main gate.

311
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,291
I will show you.

312
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,208
Throw down your weapons!

313
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,666
And surrender yourself!

314
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:52,875
You've been surrounded.

315
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:54,875
Throw down your weapons..

316
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,875
..and surrender yourself!

317
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,375
Sir. - What's the position here?

318
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,708
Gun-shots on the upper level.

319
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,471
We don't have a clue about their position.

320
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,538
Do we know how many of them are up there?
- No, sir.

321
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,000
Sir, we need to move inside.

322
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,666
Move. Move!

323
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:17,083
Move.

324
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,458
Hold, Ashok.

325
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,125
There could be many patients and
medical staff trapped inside,

326
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,500
we can't take a risk of charging in

327
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,166
We need to check their next move.

328
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,375
The doctor's with us,

329
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,666
If you try to stop us we'll kill him.

330
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,375
We're coming down.

331
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,625
Look. You still have a chance.

332
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,125
Throw down your weapons,

333
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,791
you cannot escape from here alive.

334
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,041
If u stop us,

335
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,541
the doctor will die.

336
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,083
This is your last chance,

337
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,500
throw down your weapons.

338
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,375
Pass me a grenade.

339
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,625
With the sound coming from inside,

340
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:21,541
and suspecting that the terrorists
might escape from the front entrance,

341
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,083
since the back entrance
was already secured.

342
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:31,333
Three of my best officers,

343
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,041
who also happened to be my friends,

344
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:45,000
headed towards the
hospital's front entrance.

345
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,166
Jadhav sit at the back, I will drive.
- Sir.

346
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,166
Patil, open the door.

347
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,333
Come on, sit. - Salaskar, let's go.

348
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:06,166
Control room to..

349
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,875
Sir, we've just spotted two
people leaving Cama Hospital.

350
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:10,875
Sir,

351
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,375
If they're out, they could be
coming out from any direction.

352
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:35,708
The call on radio operator's phone..

353
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:42,375
..was from his father, in Ahmed Nagar,

354
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:45,458
who saw the news on television,

355
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:49,166
and called to know about his sons safety.

356
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:01,083
How could he have imagined that his call..

357
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,625
..would be the reason for his son's death?

358
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,250
And, due to the bullets
that had hit the wheel,

359
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,000
during the shootout, the car stopped.

360
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,958
Hello, Control Room.

361
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:42,291
Get out!

362
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:47,791
Come on.

363
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:48,833
Saumil.

364
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,041
They've now hijacked a silver Skoda car,

365
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:12,708
and are heading towards Chowpatty.

366
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:16,250
Silver Skoda, number 1276,

367
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,958
Stop it at any cost. - Yes.

368
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:18,541
Get that.

369
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay, sir. Right away.

370
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,041
Come on.

371
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:22,750
Get the barricades over there.

372
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,291
Come on. - Clear the public.

373
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:28,041
Come on. Go home.

374
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,041
Move your car now.

375
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:32,666
On the left. Let the
car's go from that side.

376
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,208
Come on, move now.

377
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:36,083
Go. Go. Get your car out.

378
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,375
Come on.

379
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:40,916
Don't stand here. Leave.

380
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,000
Go.

381
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:44,541
Come on.

382
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,291
Stop him.

383
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,500
Stop. Stop.

384
01:15:58,083 --> 01:15:59,458
Yes, sir. We've setup barricades.

385
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,375
Sir, that looks like the Skoda.

386
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,458
Set up barricades. Hurry up.

387
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:18,000
Put it up quickly. Be ready.

388
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,208
Get down. - Come on, move it fast.

389
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,166
Come out. - Hurry up.

390
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,666
This is my last warning, come out.

391
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,125
Come on, move.

392
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,166
Move.

393
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:55,250
Switch off those lights. - Get down.

394
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,500
Move it.

395
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,525
[Team ExDR] [Anniversary Special]

396
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,250
Sir, one's dead,

397
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:01,993
and we have caught one alive.

398
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:03,333
We're taking him to the hospital now.

399
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,333
Send him with armed escort.

400
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,416
Mind well, armed escort.

401
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,916
His team members could be following him.

402
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:11,083
Get to Nariman House,

403
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:12,326
the situation there is tense.

404
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,041
Get me Delhi.

405
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,166
Sir. Delhi.

406
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,875
Sir, we got one.

407
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,041
Yes.

408
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,083
The order from Delhi was,

409
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,666
to keep him secure at any cost.

410
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:26,458
And the order was right,

411
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:28,916
because he was the only source,

412
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,708
from whom we could extract any information.

413
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:35,625
Then I called my officer.

414
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,916
Yes, sir. - How is he?

415
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,083
He's being treated,

416
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:41,958
he Seems fine.

417
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,458
Bring him to Crime Branch.

418
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,333
The doctor's not allowing.

419
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:46,458
Just get him,

420
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,250
and If the doctor comes
in between shoot him.

421
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:52,958
Right at that time... his team
members were killing our people,

422
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:56,750
and our doctors wanted to treat him.

423
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:00,875
I know it's professional ethics,

424
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,958
a doctor is not supposed to make judgement

425
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,666
calls on his patients background,

426
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:10,500
but then, I didn't have time for
such great ideals at that time,

427
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:14,416
because I needed immediate
information from Kasab..

428
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:18,041
..through which we could try
to save people in Taj, Oberoi,

429
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,833
and Nariman House.

430
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:23,416
And finally he was brought to me.

431
01:21:54,166 --> 01:22:00,208
"Moments are passing by slowly.
My eyes are teary."

432
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:18,625
The first time I saw
Kasab, I was taken aback.

433
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,708
I was shocked.

434
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:28,500
Inspite of all my years of
experience, which taught me that,

435
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,333
a dangerous criminal doesn't
necessarily look dangerous.

436
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,166
I was still surprised.

437
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:44,333
Kasab, was a tiny, small guy,

438
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:51,083
It was hard to believe,

439
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:58,750
that this 20 something had
spread such terror in my city.

440
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,833
At that time my most difficult job was to,

441
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:10,000
protect him from myself and my officers.

442
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:15,333
We all wanted to kill him.

443
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,000
I controlled myself.

444
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:33,250
And went about trying to
extract information from him.

445
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:35,166
Name?

446
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:38,958
What's your name?

447
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:40,000
Ajmal.

448
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:44,000
No father? - Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab.

449
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,041
From where? - Karachi.

450
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,041
How?

451
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,458
We hijacked an Indian boat in the sea.

452
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:53,166
And forced the boat man to bring us here.

453
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,083
Name of the boat.

454
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,291
Kuber.

455
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,041
And the crew.

456
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,083
Killed them.

457
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,625
Don't lie to me as I will check
with your other team members...

458
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,125
we arrested them too.

459
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:13,166
I Told him that his other
members were in my custody.

460
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,166
I lied to him.

461
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,375
After interrogating him all night..

462
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,625
..he provided me with a lot of information,

463
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,468
strangely very quickly
and very elaborately.

464
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,833
At around 7 o'clock in the morning..

465
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:46,958
..an officer came in my room.

466
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,083
Sir.

467
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:51,166
The NSG Commandoes from Delhi have arrived.

468
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,666
They've assault rifles, RDx and grenades.

469
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:23,083
Even as I was briefing the NSG,

470
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:30,208
I had a suspicion that Kasab
could be lying to me.

471
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:37,041
Or It's possible that he doesn't
know the entire truth himself?

472
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:43,958
For all I know, they could have rigged
the Taj and Oberoi hotels with RDX,

473
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:50,333
and were just waiting for the NSG
and other forces to come in.

474
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:53,875
So that they can kill everyone together.

475
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,166
But in that hostage situation,

476
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:00,166
one had no choice but to to take that risk.

477
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,916
People were still in danger in
Taj Hotel and Nariman House.

478
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,458
As NSG went about their mission,

479
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,958
I Continued interrogating Kasab.

480
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,208
You can't have the mindset

481
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:18,541
..to understand Aaka.

482
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,666
His words spell magic.

483
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,958
Magic.

484
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,958
It gratifies the soul.

485
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,250
You can't even look into his face.

486
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:43,416
His grace overwhelms you,

487
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:45,875
you wish..

488
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:50,166
..to keep looking at him,

489
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:51,916
Just keep looking.

490
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,916
Anyone who hears him speak.

491
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:57,791
Even you.

492
01:26:58,375 --> 01:26:59,708
Even you.

493
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:03,083
You will be willing to give up your life,

494
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:05,041
without asking a question.

495
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:10,958
No one can question him.

496
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:19,083
He explains you each and
every word In the Holy Book,

497
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:21,333
that's hard for you to understand.

498
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:25,208
Because you're a non-believer,

499
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:27,041
Non-believer.

500
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:29,666
I picked up the Gun for my religion.

501
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,625
Our religion is in danger,

502
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:36,458
If you want to escape hell then
you've to do Holy war Aaka said,

503
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:42,791
otherwise the fire of hell
will burn you forever.

504
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:48,000
Whether my sins will be pardoned, or not

505
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,833
I don't know that.

506
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,041
But Aaka said,

507
01:27:55,916 --> 01:28:00,875
one who will sacrifice his life for
protecting religion and faith..

508
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:03,208
..will attain the highest stature.

509
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,750
Pebble.

510
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,000
Aaka says,

511
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,000
Anyone who risks his life for Allah,

512
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:20,916
his sins,

513
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:25,791
no matter what, are pardoned.

514
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,791
And you aren't questioned.

515
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,666
But you won't know that.

516
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,916
Allah! 'Rasool'! 'Jihad'.

517
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,166
Do you know?

518
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:37,833
Do you know?

519
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:39,416
Holy war!

520
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,791
It's the only thing that will,

521
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:47,291
keep the grace and purity
of our souls intact.

522
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:49,375
Aaka said,

523
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,208
after martyrdom, angels
will carry us to heaven.

524
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:57,625
Heaven.

525
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,833
On judgement day we'll
be carried with pride,

526
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:06,041
and in heaven we'll be
surrounded by gorgeous beauties.

527
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,541
There will be an abundance
of milk and honey,

528
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,958
and we'll be bathed in them.

529
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:19,041
And..

530
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:22,458
..and all this is waiting for those
who lay their life for religion.

531
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:23,750
For religion.

532
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,875
You don't have any knowledge of religion.

533
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,000
By God..

534
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,625
..the day Aaka chose us for this task..

535
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:42,041
..we were so happy

536
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:47,000
After this good deed, we'll
go straight to heaven,

537
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,958
swaying with joy.

538
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,041
Before seeing us off, Aaka said..

539
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:04,750
"Go children."

540
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:06,416
"Go."

541
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:10,875
"Keep killing till your last breath."

542
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,208
"Spread terror."

543
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,958
"Kill those enemies of our faith."

544
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,875
After martyrdom..

545
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,375
..Your bodies will smell of perfume.

546
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:27,291
And then Our master hugged us.

547
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,458
Blessed us..

548
01:30:30,916 --> 01:30:32,041
..and said..

549
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,291
Allah be with you.

550
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,916
Allah will bless us with
success in our task.

551
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:45,166
If we win, we will be warriors,

552
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,291
and if we die,

553
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,750
we will be martyrs.

554
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:54,291
Allah will protect our families!

555
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:10,916
I have to tell you that I had a
lot of joy killing your people,

556
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,541
I swear..

557
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,125
M****r f****r,

558
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,041
It pleased my soul.

559
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:27,166
What can you do now?

560
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,000
You.

561
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:32,125
And your government.

562
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,333
What?

563
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,791
Tell me.

564
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,833
Tell me.

565
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,958
I realized that he is a dog.

566
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,541
Just a dog.

567
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:08,125
If a handler orders his dog to bite..

568
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,708
.. it's foolish to get angry with the dog.

569
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,125
The real killers are the ones..

570
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:17,625
..who executed this plan
from across the sea.

571
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:22,041
That doesn't mean I am saying
that Kasab is not wrong..

572
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:24,166
..If I wasn't bound by the law.

573
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:27,666
I would've wanted to tear him
apart myself with my bare hands.

574
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,480
The NSG operation ended successfully,

575
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,125
and everything got under control.

576
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:54,166
And then one day Kasab made a request.

577
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:58,166
As long as I am going to be either killed,

578
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,458
or just left to rot,

579
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,000
why don't u let me

580
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:05,750
stay with my other mates?

581
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,041
What's your problem if you..

582
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:09,041
..let me stay with my mates?

583
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,375
You want to stay with your mates?

584
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:17,166
Come.

585
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,000
You wanted to stay with
your mates didn't you?

586
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:34,166
Let alone heaven,

587
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:39,750
even if they knocked on the door of hell,

588
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:44,166
the devil would have kicked on their
asses and sent them back here.

589
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,125
Allah!

590
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:04,125
Their souls must be wandering
somewhere around here only,

591
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:10,125
I can't see them, maybe you can,

592
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:11,488
they were your people after all.

593
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:17,541
Who is he?

594
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:21,000
What's his name?

595
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:23,625
Abdul.

596
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:26,916
Abdul.

597
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,000
Ask them all,

598
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:34,541
What holy war is?

599
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:39,166
Maybe now they know.

600
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:47,041
Holy war has been mentioned
41 times in the Quran

601
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:49,011
Yet you guys didn't understand its context.

602
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:52,250
What do you think?

603
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,625
Only you and your Aaka have read the Quran.

604
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,708
We're illiterates?

605
01:36:57,833 --> 01:36:59,708
We don't have any stature?

606
01:37:02,416 --> 01:37:04,291
What's the f**king stature of your Aaka?

607
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,958
I'm sure your Aaka didn't tell you..

608
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:23,791
..that you're... ASHRAFUL MAKHLOOK...

609
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,041
Means.. human beings.

610
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:30,041
The most unique 'CREATION of God.

611
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:31,833
After creating human beings..

612
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:35,500
..God ordered the angels
to prostrate before them

613
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,166
Do you know?

614
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,708
Your Aaka didn't tell you..

615
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:45,125
..God made self-realization as a means
to escape from the fire of hell?

616
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,958
If you just had realized your sins

617
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:58,041
..even then you would've
been entitled for heaven.

618
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:01,541
Your Aaka didn't tell you about
these words from the Koran.

619
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,208
Why would he?

620
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,541
Then Under the pretext of holy war
he couldn't have sent you here..

621
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:09,125
..to massacre innocent people.

622
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:14,791
Islam is in danger?

623
01:38:15,666 --> 01:38:17,083
Religion is in trouble?

624
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:22,541
He said that and you believed it and
just came here and massacred people

625
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:24,083
Mother f****r,

626
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:28,791
tell me what threat was
there to your religion,

627
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:30,458
from innocent women and children?

628
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:36,958
Islam's based on humanity,
but you don't know that.

629
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:39,375
Because you're an ignorant fool,

630
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:42,708
after this kind of holy
war, you think your souls..

631
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,750
..will stay glorious and pious.

632
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:56,125
Switch on the exhaust.

633
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:06,708
Look at their faces,

634
01:39:09,916 --> 01:39:12,000
smell the sweet scent of martyrdom..

635
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,791
..coming from their body.

636
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,125
Why the fuck are you,

637
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:17,125
covering your nose.

638
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:18,375
Smell!

639
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:20,166
Smell!

640
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:21,875
Smell!

641
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:27,083
Smell!

642
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:30,708
Smell!

643
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:35,541
Smell!

644
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:38,208
Angels will come down?

645
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:45,041
Will bathe you in honey.

646
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:52,166
Your Aaka even refused to
acknowledge them You bastard

647
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:58,083
Nobody wants to give even
6 feet land to bury them.

648
01:40:01,916 --> 01:40:04,000
Each and everyone without
exception hates them,

649
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,095
and You call this sacrifice and martyrdom.?

650
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:12,041
You call this sacrifice and martyrdom.

651
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,875
You want to see martyrdom?

652
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:18,875
Listen to what people did when you
and your guys were busy killing,

653
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,083
they didn't care about
anyone's religion or faith,

654
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:23,250
they just sacrificed their own
lives trying to save others,

655
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,875
they attained martyrdom..

656
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,333
..for protecting humanity created by God.

657
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:30,250
Everyone's mourning for them.

658
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:32,958
Everyone's shedding tears.

659
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:36,666
They attained heaven here itself on earth.

660
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:39,458
That's what true martyrdom is.

661
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,333
You were swaying with joy, didn't you..

662
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:53,375
..when your Aaka chose you for this task?

663
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:58,458
I want to know, did you even bother
to ask any person you killed..

664
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:03,833
..what was their sin? Did you
even ask your conscience?

665
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,166
Conscience,

666
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:10,041
Conscience! Do you even
know what conscience is?

667
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:17,458
If you survive, you're a warrior
and if you die you are a martyr

668
01:41:19,666 --> 01:41:21,208
Bastard

669
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:26,625
Your Aaka lured you with
martyrdom using it like a carrot

670
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,833
He didn't tell you,

671
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:34,916
on Judgement Day only such cruel
sinners as you are punished first.

672
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,083
This is not said by me,

673
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:41,708
It was Hazrat Mohammad
Mustafa who said this

674
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:46,458
Do you even know his words?

675
01:41:54,166 --> 01:41:58,083
Ignorants like you have
made holy war a joke.

676
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,083
A joke.

677
01:42:08,458 --> 01:42:10,083
If you want to do holy war,

678
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,000
then first do it with yourself,

679
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:16,125
with the evil that has developed
in your heart and mind.

680
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:17,833
That's the real holy war,

681
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,083
'Jihad-Ul-Akbar.'

682
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,666
If you had read the Quran
properly even once,

683
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:34,833
or even just read it, you
would have understood,

684
01:42:34,916 --> 01:42:37,375
you can't ever understood what
Islams nobility' is about.

685
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:42,791
That's because first of
all you are not a Muslim,

686
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:46,708
Islam's a very great faith,

687
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:50,166
ignorant fools like you
can never understand.

688
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:05,791
I have a son of your age.

and some call you as Allah."

"But we beg you Lord that do bless us all."

693
01:51:55,208 --> 01:52:01,416
"Lord Ram, the Lord of heavens.
Blessed is thy name."

694
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:07,625
"Victory to you Lord Ram
the husband of Sita."

695
01:52:07,833 --> 01:52:14,083
"Lord Ram, the Lord of heavens.
Blessed is thy name."

696
01:52:14,166 --> 01:52:20,375
"Victory to you Lord Ram
the husband of Sita."

697
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:26,750
"Some call you Ishwar (Lord Vishnu)
and some call you as Allah."
