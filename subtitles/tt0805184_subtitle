00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,870
I will bring down the stars from the sky.

34
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,582
I'll bring the lovely sights of heaven.

35
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,666
Oh my sweetheart, if you say yes, then...

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,625
I'll jump in the air!

37
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:03,889
Jump! Jump! 
Jump in the air!

38
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,887

I am here and you're also here.

It's the season of love.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,437
Oh! My darling, just know what is the signal of our friend.

49
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,988
Wait a little, wail a little.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,283
You wait for a little while more.

51
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,288
Oh my darling, by god.

52
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,495
Do not make me restless.

53
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,330
I am your lover.

54
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,286

55
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:21,421

I just desire you.

62
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,752
I see your face in my dreams.

63
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,094
You are in my memories too.

64
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,892
It is a strange kind of high.

65
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,062
Where am I getting lost?

66
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:23,612
My eyes are open, but I am falling asleep.

67
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,405
My condition is the same.

68
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,528
If you say yes, then...

69
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,069
I'll jump in the air!

70
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,955

00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,349

75
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,040
- Baby! Signal...

76
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,582
This is mine. 
What are you doing?

77
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,159
- Give me! Give me!

78
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,897
Boss...

79
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,437
Boss! Putlibai!

80
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,120
What is it?

81
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,706
Can I get oil?
 Oil.

82
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,086
Oil?

83
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,794
You know Bunny, he took oil for taking a bath.

84
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,683
He does massage all day long.

85
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,031
And used all the oil.

86
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,014
So can I get little oil on loan from your place?

87
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,425
I need it to remove the makeup.

88
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,142
Wait a minute.

89
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,397
Why did you close the door?

90
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,689
I want to tell you one secret.

91
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,112
You know Bunty, Bunty.

92
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,191
Never trust him.

93
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:55,475
He is not worthy enough to be trusted.

94
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,909
So this is your secret?

95
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,583
No, no. 
Ah... the secret is something else.

96
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,035
I wanted to praise you.

97
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,461
I wanted to tell you that all are praising you so much.

98
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,005
Do you know what they are saying?

99
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,457
They say that you are an expert dancer.

100
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,463
And the pair is even better than super-duper hit.

101
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,467
This is the secret?

102
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,427
No, the secret is that... 
I wanted to tell you that if...

103
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,692
...our pair becomes a pair in real life too, then...

104
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,808
Then?

105
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,104
Then... Then, I love you. 
I like you.

106
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,616
Hey! Wait. Wait.

107
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,489
Wait. Wail.

108
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,222
What were you doing in her room?

109
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:41,983
- I didn't go anywhere.

110
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,627
Why are you covering your cheek like that?

111
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,581
Show me. 
Show me, dear.

112
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,966
Why is your cheek red'?

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,723
Isn't the lipstick...
lipstick mark... gone yet?

114
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,134
Why was a lipstick mark on your cheek?

115
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:02,680
Tell me.

116
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,498
- Don't tell anyone I had gone in her room.

117
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,648
No, no.

118
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,810
Promise?
- Promise. Promise.

119
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,569
But tell me.
 Tell me.

120
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:09,134
- I am telling you.

121
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,063
I was feeling thirsty.
- Yes.

122
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,738
I went to her room lo ask for water.
- Yes.

123
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,108
Then she came.
- Yes.

124
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,036
She was walking like this and this.

125
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:18,770
What happened next?

126
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:19,596
Friend, you are really...

127
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,541
Listen. I am telling you.

128
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,556
She came and said 'take water'.

129
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,665
And I held her hand.

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,664
Then. Tell me what happened then?

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,869
No, I can't say that.

132
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,658
No, no, brother.

133
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:28,571
Please, please tell me.

134
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,544
Please tell me what happened next?

135
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,670
Tell me.

136
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,637
You ate everything?

137
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,014
Nothing was left?

138
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:46,977
Don't tell anyone. 
It is a matter of my respect.

139
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,558
Why I would I tell, friend?

140
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,164
This is your advance, sir.

141
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,106
Your show was brilliant.

142
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,678
What is the name of the actress?

143
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:06,313
She was good.

144
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,383
Where do I have to sign?

145
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:08,360
- You have to sign here.

146
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,589
Now listen, it is decided then that on 29th."

147
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,792
...you will take your whole group to London.
- Yes!

148
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,094
Full one month program is finalized. 
Ok.

149
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:19,308
I hope the heroine will be the same, right?

150
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,424
I have signed it.

151
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,289
Help! Help!

152
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,120
Why, help?

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,705
What happened? 
What's the matter?

154
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,632
The sister got scared!

155
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,709
He tried to touch me in the bathroom.

156
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,713
But sister, I was just checking your flute.

157
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,140
You'll check sister's flute in the bathroom?

158
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,093
The people who try to be fresh with their sister's, do you...

159
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,348
...know what are they called...?

160
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,560
Since when is she your sister?

161
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,421
Good that you people came.

162
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:11,166
If you had not come then...

163
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,184
...I don't know what he would have done to me today?

164
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,316
Listen you chaste woman, do not try lo act smart.

165
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,149
Yesterday when he had come to your room then you...

166
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,318
...were jumping all round and having a ball.

167
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,282
What are you saying?
What have I done?

168
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,604
Did you hear that, sir?
This so called chaste woman is asking...

169
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,290
What have I done?

170
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,163
When last night he had come to your room at that time you...

171
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,665
...did not say anything. 
And now you started to scream?

172
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,166
Tell me, what special qualities does he have which...

173
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,293
...I don't have?

174
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,589
Stop it!

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,093
Hey my hair! Hey!
- Stop! Stop!

176
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,008
I am telling you, last night he had come to my room...

177
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,885
Forget about last night.
Talk of now.

178
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,467
Babla, had you gone lo her room last night?

179
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,097
Tell us had you gone there or not.

180
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,480
Last night... I... I had gone to sleep at 7 o'clock.

181
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,859
Oh God this animal!
He is such a lair, sir. Ask him...

182
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,691
Didn't tell me last night that you had gone to her room?

183
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,983
After I woke up I did not meet anyone, really.

184
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,697
You did not meet me?
- When?

185
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,947
Then.
- Then, when?

186
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,495
Sir, I am really telling you...

187
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,117
...that you should drive this man from here.

188
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,408
Quiet! Absolutely silent. Quiet.

189
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,495
First you apologies to her.

190
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,300
No, I'll not apologies.

191
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:12,063
- I am telling you apologies.

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,623
I will not apologies, sir.

193
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,501
All this happened because of this rascal.

194
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,174
Come to London. I'll see you there.
- Listen...

195
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,501
If he behaves like this in the broad day light then what...

196
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,133
...will happen to us women in London?

197
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,197
Apologies will not do.

198
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,534
This lust crazy man should be...

199
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,808
...punished for sure.

200
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,146
Behold! Another chaste woman has spoken.

201
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,163
What do you say, sir.

202
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,834
Should I call the Police.
 - Yes!

203
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:32,964
Stop it. Be quiet.

204
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,841
Do not create a racket, rascals.

205
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,568
If the organizer hears this then what will he think of me?

206
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,065
Agreed that you are not honourable people.

207
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,525
But think of my honour.

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,534
In my 30 years' career this kind of thing has never happened.

209
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,532
But since you both have come...

210
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,864
...my age has doubled. Really.

211
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,614
That is alright.

212
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,776
But he should be punished, right?

213
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:51,224
- Yes!

214
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,034
What punishment? 
Why punishment?

215
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,540
So you have forgotten. Sir, the show which we had staged...

216
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,543
...in Nagpur, I had called the organizer's daughter a...

217
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,966
...buffalo then I was given the punishment of dish washing.

218
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,626
When I had not even called her a buffalo.

219
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,671
But he has committed a crime.

220
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:03,577
He at least be punish with...

221
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,845
...washing the laundry.

222
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,553
Yes. From today for the ext one month you'll wash...

223
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,226
...everybody's dirty laundry. Happy?
- Happy-

224
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,554
<i>Gk. NOW everybody go k: your rooms.</i>

225
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,605
These are everybody's Passport.

226
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,281
You tell everyone to take care of them like a treasure.
Got it.

227
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,286
Sir, sir.
- What is it? Don't shout.

228
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,871
That heroine... Take this.

229
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,666
She is not coming to London.

230
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,999
Poor boss... Boss...

231
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,133
What happened?
-What happened?

232
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,461
Someone gel some water.

233
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,987
Someone see what happened.

234
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,368
- What happened? 
- Sir...

235
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,765
Sir, sir.

236
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,097
Water. 
Sir, sir...

237
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,223
Press his chest.

238
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,646
Sir, sir...

239
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,353
What happened?

240
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,482
This has happened because of you both.

241
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,864
Because of both of you my heroine is refusing to come.

242
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,073
Because of both of them no girl stays for long in our show.

243
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,498
I am saying that you should throw them out.

244
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,205
Throw us out, throw us out.

245
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,537
Give him water. Here, Sir, water.

246
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,043
Sir, I am telling you that we'll do something or the other...

247
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,373
...once we reach there.

248
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,300
What will you do?

249
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:21,440
Will you wear her blouse and petticoat?

250
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,669
What will you do?

251
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,719
Sir, a lot of Indian people live there.
- Yes.

252
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,841
We'll find some heroine Or the other.

253
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:28,967
That's what I was saying.

254
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,014
We do not have any other option.

255
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,800
We'll think about it when we reach there.

256
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,139
But let us first go to London.

257
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,698
Excuse me! Excuse me!

258
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:05,025
Welcome! Welcome!

259
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,156
Welcome! Welcome!

260
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:08,111
- Thank you.
- Has everyone come?

261
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,140
Yes, all are here.
Who are you looking for?

262
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,434
Your main actress has not come?

263
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,803
The show is on Friday, right?
- Yes.

264
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,820
So she will come after two days.

265
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,339
Her uncle is dead. - Oh!

266
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,564
Her mother's brother died.

267
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,751
She is coming after 2 days

268
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,685
OK. Then it's fine.
All of you go in the bus...

269
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,729
...with along with your own luggage.

270
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,189
And you are the director, right?

271
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,357
Yes.
- You come with me in the taxi.

272
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,900
Gullu, keep his luggage in the taxi.

273
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,584
Rest of you, go in the bus.

274
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,725
- Come, come. Welcome!

275
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,126
Listen, do not smoke and do not spit.

276
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,661
This is not India, and don't make it one.

277
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,329
Please come. Come.

278
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,750
Everybody get out of the bus.

279
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,230
Please come, welcome. Welcome.

280
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,268
Come on, everyone carry your own luggage and get down.

281
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,730
Every one proceed to the reception counter...

282
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,126
...and take the
keys to your rooms.

283
00:15:07,152 --> 00:15:07,761
Welcome] Welcome!

284
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,068
This red bag...
- Hey, my bag too.

285
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,198
And listen!
- Yes.

286
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,948
This entire motel has been booked for you only.

287
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:16,581
No one else will live here except you people.

288
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,143
I've arranged for everything.

289
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:17,767
But there is no facility.“...

290
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,291
...for doing laundry.

291
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:20,807
Not to worry.

292
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,768
We have brought a man with us to do...

293
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:22,261
...the laundry.

294
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:22,943
- Is he a 'Dhobi' (Washer man}?

295
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,463
He is a Dhobi or something else.

296
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,112
I don't know.

297
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,209
Ah ha! There is a 'Dhobi'.

298
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,776
Yes, there is a Dhobi.

299
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,783
Dhobi is here.

300
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,383
Quiet! 
Listen, is there any arrangement for food and all?

301
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,262
There is no problem of food.

302
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:35,535
There is a kitchen.

303
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,784
Utensils are there.
Everything is there.

304
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,914
Bu! there is no cook.

305
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,894
You will have to do the cooking yourselves and eat.

306
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,772
Because there is no one else living here, except you all.

307
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,898
No Room Service!

308
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,362
Hey, Gullu! 
Come here.

309
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,302
- I am already here.

310
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,908
Gullu taxi driver, will stay with you for the entire day today.

311
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,236
Whatever you want you can tell him to get from the market.

312
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,445
He will get for you whatever you want.

313
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,358
Gullu, take care of them.

314
00:15:58,384 --> 00:15:59,124
They are our people.

315
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,018
They should not get out of our hand.
Understood?

316
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:01,516
- Yes.

317
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,770
Now be comfortable.

318
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,523
Think this as your own motel.

319
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,375
Now I'll take your leave.
 Now I will meet you all on the...

320
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,960
...the day of the show.

321
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,791
This is height of decency.

322
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,878
Come, Gullu. Come.
- But, money...

323
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,809
Has everybody had their lea, breakfast and have all bathed?

324
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,845
I have not finished.
- What's your problem?

325
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,305
The room is being set.

326
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,817
That is OK.
But our biggest problem is that

327
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,560
we do not have a heroine.

328
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,112
That problem has been taken care of.

329
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,940
How did you manage that?

330
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,824
Listen, the story will be the same but...

331
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,948
the hero and the heroine are changed.

332
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,529
Who is the heroine?
- I am

333
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,240
What?!

334
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:46,062
- I am the hero and this Vaijanthi is the heroine.
- Yes.

335
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:46,922
Then one thing is clear.

336
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:47,961
This is our last show and after this...

337
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,835
...we go straight back to India.

338
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:50,487
You shut up.

339
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:52,112
It is because of you the heroine ran away.

340
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,842
Whatever it is...

341
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,010
...at least the public won't tear our clothes!

342
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,840
I was thinking that if sir becomes the hero and she...

343
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,518
...becomes the heroine then what would be it's title.

344
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,392
Signal... Signal of old age...

345
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,563
Stupid! Idiot! Keep quiet.

346
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,320
Sir, these voices can not be muffled, understand?

347
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,567
Sir, sir, there is a threat from my side.

348
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,863
If she becomes the heroine of this play then I'll play...

349
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,240
...the part of the villain.

350
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,900
Why will you become the villain.
Why you.

351
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,075
I always play the part of the villain so this time also...

352
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,236
...I will become the villain.

353
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,995
Why, you wanted to become the hero.

354
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,118
Now that you've got a chance then why don't you do it?

355
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,871
Brother, I want lo become a hero and not somebody's son.

356
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:26,997
What?

357
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,999
And I also do not want to become somebody's grandson!

358
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,582
Shut up! Shut up!

359
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,963
Quiet! Quiet! Now there is only one option open.

360
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,464
And everybody will have to go with it.

361
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,932
Whoever finds a heroine and brings her here will play...

362
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,800
...the part of the 'Hero'.

363
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,915
Otherwise, I'll do the show...

364
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,396
...with her and I'll not pay even a single rupee lo anyone.

365
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,898
Then you can do whatever you want.

366
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,933
12,13, 14...

367
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,543
Oh, you are minting Sterling Pound!

368
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,627
The Taxi is on hire.

369
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,396
Sol have to give the account everyday.

370
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,378
But why are you carrying that bag and walking?

371
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,049
You know they are cleaning the place.
- Oh!

372
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,635
What a strange weather?

373
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,936
I tell you, you can not trust London's weather and...

374
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,476
...London's girls.
Anytime they keep changing colours.

375
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,277
Why'? Are the girls not nice?

376
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,245
No, it is just a saying.

377
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,216
The girls are very good.

378
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,426
But how is their nature.

379
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,721
Do they make friends or not?

380
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,999
Whoever comes here asks the same thing one way...

381
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,417
No! No! It is nothing of that sort.

382
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,643
I was just asking...

383
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,982
- Oh! Just like that...

384
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,508
Move, move.
- What happened?

385
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,630
What happened?
- Sit inside.

386
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,961
What?
- What type of girl do you want?

387
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,483
Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, English...

388
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,743
- Shall I tell you the truth?
- Yes.

389
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,515
I want an Indian girl.

390
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,142
What?

391
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:06,996
You are in a foreign country and you want...

392
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:07,792
...an Indian girl?

393
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:09,002
- What to do, the game is such.

394
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,448
Oh... I have understood now.

395
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,006
Everyone has their own style...

396
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,975
...of playing this game.

397
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,132
-Lot of people come and ask me.

398
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,518
What?
-Who else has asked you?

399
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,400
Now, nobody has asked me.

400
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:17,161
I said it just like that.

401
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:17,552
- Oh?

402
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,355
When do you want it?
- Today.

403
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,485
Today?!
- Right now.

404
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,066
Right now?!
- Yes.

405
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,411
Oh! You can not hold.

406
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,102
What to do the want is such.

407
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,736
No, no, it is not such a want.

408
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:27,604
- I! is OK. OK!

409
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,202
Listen! Listen!
- Yes?

410
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,242
For one month.
- For one month?!

411
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,669
The same one? Same taste?
You also...

412
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,121
No, it is not that...

413
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:35,748
ll is OK.

414
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,402
You are still not married, that is why.

415
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:37,972
I have understood.

416
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:38,607
I've understood everything.

417
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,750
And listen!
- Yes?

418
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,301
She should be able to speak Hindi.

419
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,886
She should know Hindi also?

420
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,534
- Yes. She should know Hindi.

421
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,261
I see, there should be no communication problem.

422
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,013
He wants for one month, and...

423
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,060
...she should speak dialogues in Hindi too.

424
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,012
He wants for one month, and she should speak dialogues in Hindi too.

425
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,146
Dialogues are important.

426
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,024
I liked it.
The way you said it, liked it.

427
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,481
Listen, listen!
- Yes?

428
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,154
The girl should look like a heroine.

429
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,402
She should be a dancer also!

430
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,443
Oh! You seem to be a man of varied tastes.

431
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:07,905
Now you don't worry.

432
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,309
She will do whatever you tell her to do.

433
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,331
If you tell her to dance she will dance.

434
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,455
If you spent money then there is nothing that can't be done.

435
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,039
By the way how much money will she take?

436
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,005
You forget about it.

437
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,192
The amount she will tell you.

438
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,498
Why are you getting worried about it?

439
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,174
You do what I tell you to do.

440
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,219
Go to your right from the signal.

441
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,220
Then from the 4th signal turn left.

442
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,602
Then you will come across a very big park.

443
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:27,077
There you'll...

444
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,652
...find a lot of Indians standing.

445
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:29,705
But do not ask any white.

446
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,431
The moment the Indians see you they will understand.

447
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,012
They will try to befriend you.

448
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,063
Then you ask them whatever you want.

449
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,171
But beware of the Police.

450
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:36,795
Remember that.

451
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,601
Listen, the talk which we had between you and me...

452
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,273
...do not tell anyone about it.

453
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,481
Lot of people will ask you.

454
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,755
- You need not worry about that.

455
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,550
They will ask.

456
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,936
- Now you go and do your job.

457
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:45,665
All the best!

458
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,216
Listen to me...

459
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:46,965
You speak!

460
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,658
- You speak. - You speak.

461
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,763
No, you speak.
- No you speak.

462
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,351
If we find a heroine then I'll become the hero.

463
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,183
Yes, but for only this show.

464
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,185
In the next show I'll be the hero.

465
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,953
Otherwise that old man will become the hero.

466
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,162
The dwarf had said that I'll meet a lot of Indians here...

467
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,161
...who will try to befriend me and introduce me lo the heroine...

468
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,368
But I can'!
see anyone here.

469
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,302
Look! Look!

470
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,523
Not at me.
Look over there.

471
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,782
I think these are the people.
Come.

472
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,009
Ask! Ask! Ask!

473
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,095
The dwarf had said that they will ask first.

474
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:19,265
Really? They are coming towards us.
- I am seeing.

475
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,518
Do you have a light?

476
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,115
Is he angry? Ask him.

477
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,335
That... He... Heroine...

478
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,754
Don't say heroin, say 'pouch, pouch.'

479
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,211
Doll?
- Pouch.

480
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,717
He is saying 'pouch'.
- Pouch'?

481
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,674
Pouch!
- Have?

482
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,955
Yes. Did you gel the money?

483
00:23:56,981 --> 00:24:00,705
- Yes! Yes! 
- Yes! Yes!

484
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,113
Police!
 Take this! Run! Run!

485
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,607
My bag!

486
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,278
Hey bag!
 Wait!

487
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,447
Where are you running?

488
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,621
Wait!

489
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,513
<i>“W”.</i>

490
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,147
Who's that?
- It's us, boss. - Yes.

491
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,277
Come, come.

492
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,321
Boss, the deal was successful.

493
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,859
Very good!

494
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,307
I hope nothing went wrong?

495
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,233
Yes, Boss.
 - Huh?

496
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:01,055
- The Police had arrived there.
- Police?!

497
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,540
How did the Police know about this?

498
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,894
That we don't know.

499
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,102
- Bu! we escaped.

500
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,083
Open the bag.

501
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,876
Excuse me, Boss.

502
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,965
La! La!

503
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,522
These briefs, vests, pant and shins...
What is all this?

504
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,893
Where is the money?

505
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:36,034
Boss, we had exchanged the bags correctly.

506
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,320
Even the code word was same.

507
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,822
We asked for a light.
He gave me a light.

508
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,247
I said, packet. 
He said, packet.

509
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,873
Did he say packet or old woman?

510
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,706
Then what is all this?

511
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,206
What did he say'?

512
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,469
Manubhai Gandhi here. What?!

513
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,726
Now I've understood.

514
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,721
Our entire material has been nabbed by the Police.

515
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,727
Police? How is that possible, boss'?

516
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,946
That has happened.

517
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,755
Just now Sher Khan has told me

518
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,358
...thal his people have been arrested by the Police.

519
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,488
The Police must have tortured them and got the code word.

520
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:26,787
That means that the rascal Commissioner G.D. Mehra...

521
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,172
...has appointed Indian C.l.D to nab our drug deals.

522
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,749
The people with whom you finalised the deal...

523
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,918
...were Secret Police.

524
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,253
Yes, Boss.

525
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,466
Look, my image here is that of a very big builder.

526
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,760
And I do not want to tarnish it. OK?

527
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,389
Now you go out and be careful.

528
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,274
And do not come back here.

529
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,916
Now get out from here.

530
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,973
Get out I said. Get out!

531
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,447
One coffee please.

532
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,494
This is a strange city.
For the first time in my life I've seen...

533
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,835
...such a thief who takes away my bag but leaves back his bag.

534
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,718
I don't think that they were thieves.

535
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:15,832
They were something else.

536
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,094
I think it is altogether a different ball game.

537
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,835
Let us open the bag and see.

538
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,969
No. Not ere. 
There's lot of public here. No here.

539
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,424
Where
- Let us go lo a place where there's nobody.

540
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,429
Let's go there.

541
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,443
Movel Police! 
Secret Police!

542
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,691
Run!

543
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,327
Who is it?

544
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,447
Boss! Boss! Boss, please save us.

545
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,902
Save us, please.

546
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,920
What... What happened?

547
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:58,656
What's happened?

548
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,174
The secret Police has reached here following us.
- What?!

549
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,880
Yes, boss. We have seen them with these eyes...

550
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,014
...entering this hotel.

551
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,345
You idiots!
Why have you both come hereto gel me killed?

552
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,273
Now because of you both I'll be caught.

553
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,856
Police!

554
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,988
They will not be able lo catch me.

555
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,749
What is all this?
I think it is flour.

556
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:51,618
Is it flour? Flour?

557
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,766
No! These are drugs.

558
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,018
Drugs?!
- Yes.

559
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,896
With this you get intoxicated.

560
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,021
This is quite dangerous.
- Yes.

561
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,478
This has been kept by mistake.

562
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,408
We'll be in more grave danger.

563
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:03,425
- Yes. Shut it close.

564
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,359
H... a... n... d!

565
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,917
Wait! Wait! 
What to do with this bag?

566
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,460
Let me think.

567
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,792
Now what is there to think'!

568
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:20,088
Let us throw away the material...

569
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:20,629
...and keep the bag.

570
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:21,523
It will be useful to us sometime.

571
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,357
It is a good bag.

572
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:23,699
- Have you gone out of your mind?

573
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:24,995
Do you know what's it worth?

574
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:25,763
1 crore rupees.

575
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,629
1 crore rupees? 
This thing?

576
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,673
It is not worth more than 5000 rupees.

577
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,091
You moron, I am not talking about the bag.

578
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,642
I am talking about the material inside ii.

579
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,435
1 crore rupees for this garbage.

580
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,933
Do you think I am mad'?

581
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,515
Yes. You uneducated idiot,

582
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,440
lam a graduate in English.
Understood?

583
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,189
To know about all these things one needs intelligence.

584
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,569
Which you don't have, but I have!

585
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,612
Hey listen, what I am saying.
Listen.

586
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:45,940
If really this material is worth...

587
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,569
...1 crore rupees then let us sell it.

588
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,947
At least then we will not have to dance lo the lune of...

589
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,199
...Mr. Champak for the rest of our lives.

590
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,123
We will forget Mr. Champak and live life happily.

591
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,371
What do you say, should we sell this material?

592
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,353
Yes, sell it. Sell it.

593
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,352
You do one thing... - Yes?

594
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,462
You put a rug on the road side and start calling out...

595
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,131
Take the drugs! Take the drugs!

596
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,008
But then will the public come lo buy it?

597
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,008
Yes, they will come.

598
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:07,194
They will come in uniform.

599
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,005
Police... Excuse me, where is the Police Station.

600
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,241
Listen, I am from Russia.

601
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,620
Don't ask me stupid questions.

602
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,019
They will arrest you and take you and put you behind bars...

603
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,679
...for 2 lo 3 three years.

604
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,979
No brother, then we'll do a thing that we'll lake this garbage...

605
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,981
...and throw it in the garbage bin and get...

606
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,983
mourselves out of this garbage.

607
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,281
We will go to the police station.

608
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,067
We will give the goods lo them.

609
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,120
And then we will tell them to arrest us...

610
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,450
...we are dieing to get arrest

611
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,364
Have you gone mad! Why
are you talking rubbish!

612
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,463
Were you born abnormally!

613
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:38,191
Have you gone mad!

614
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,170
In fact they will reward us for our honesty.

615
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,080
And my photo too will be Published.
Like this.

616
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,585
Why not mine?

617
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,311
That loo will be published.

618
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,484
But it will be a small one.

619
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,076
- Why?

620
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,427
Because you don't have a degree.

621
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,054
Let me think.

622
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,180
For that you need brains.

623
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,759
You just listen to what I have to say.

624
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,015
No, even then...
- Taxi!

625
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,102
Come soon idiot. 
Come soon.

626
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,018
Do you believe we are stupid guys.

627
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,148
Someone gave you drugs and run away.

628
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,696
Officer, please try and understand.

629
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,021
Listen, I am from India.

630
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:10,390
And I speak only the truth.

631
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,391
Shut up! 
- Move aside.

632
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,342
I will explain to them.

633
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,531
Listen, officer.

634
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,577
This is the limit!

635
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:16,309
We had come here to act in a drama.

636
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,729
We needed a heroine for our drama.

637
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:18,561
Such a trivial matter.

638
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,414
And that fool told us, go and stand in that garden.

639
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,339
People who are there, they provide heroines.

640
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,546
I went there and stood like decent guys.

641
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,206
Just then two guys who looked like bulls came there.

642
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,465
They were wearing black goggles.

643
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,432
A black and a fair one.

644
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,408
Black glasses on fair skin.

645
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,585
And both are blind.

646
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,220
They put the cigarette in their mouth.

647
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,342
And they asked me, do you have matchstick.

648
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,094
I too decently took out the matchbox.

649
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,764
And I lit up the matchstick.

650
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,285
And then the guy blows it.

651
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,393
He extinguished the matchstick.

652
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,516
I asked him will we get a heroine.

653
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,642
He said no, you will gel Pooja.

654
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,395
I thought maybe in your country you worship heroines.

655
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,726
Sol said pouch is fine, perform the veneration.

656
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,061
As soon as I said it, he gave me his bag...

657
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,067
...and he took my bag.

658
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,035
And he ran away.

659
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:52,424
We too could have run away.

660
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,099
But brother got an inspiration.

661
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,556
And we came here like fools.

662
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,085
Sir, we have two Indians here with a case of drugs

663
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,129
But we don't understand their language.

664
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,169
Okay, sir.

665
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,102
Good Morning sir.
- Good Morning

666
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,224
Send them in.

667
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,606
Hey come on, let's go.

668
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,775
Where are we going?
- For a picnic.

669
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,229
Now you shut your loud speaker And don't talk there.

670
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,814
I will talk to the senior officer.
- OK.

671
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,414
2 men came, gave you the bag and went away.

672
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,457
Sir, we are Indians.
Sir, brother-brother.

673
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,334
Shut up and answer the question.

674
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,177
I agree.
But this bag full of drugs was found with you.

675
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,180
I will either have to arrest you both...

676
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,306
...or you will have lo prove your innocence

677
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,680
How...?

678
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,143
Do you have anybody in London, who will sign on the statement...

679
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,269
...and get you bail?

680
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,536
No, no, sir. Not in London.

681
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:09,923
But we have many people in India.

682
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,437
If you say we will call them here, but who will pay the fare?

683
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,481
You don't talk.
Otherwise he will again put us in the lock up.

684
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,819
Sir, there is a taxi driver.

685
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,906
Bu! the problem is that I don't know where he stays.

686
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,446
The taxi's number?

687
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,827

One minute.

00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,214

693
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,424
Officer, find the stand it's parked?

Taxi.

701
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:25,785

He went to the left.

00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,259
- He's gone.
 - Come! Come!

709
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,365

Sir come soon, sit.

711
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,873
Drive the car fast.

712
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,627
Sir look there.

713
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,343
I can't drive above the speed limit of 60.

714
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,514
Will your father pay the penalty?

715
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,050
Where do you want to go?

716
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,431
Take us wherever you want lo go.

717
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,353
But drive fast!
 It's an emergency!

718
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,730
Do you want lo use the bathroom?

719
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,560
Why do you eat so much that you can't control it?

720
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,403
Oh my God!

721
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:23,785
Right! Right!

722
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,614
Left! Left

723
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,790
What happened?
- What a man!

724
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,916
First time I found a passenger who...

725
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,039
...is ready to go where I want to go.

726
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,978
Stop! Stop! Stop the car!
Stop the car!

727
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:36,364
- How will it stop?

728
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,821
Hey where are you running'!

729
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,401
Will your father pay the fare?

730
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,677
Gullu! Gullu!

731
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,807
Gullu!
 Explain to these police officers.

732
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,351
They have arrested us.

733
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,310
Name?
- Gullu.

734
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,877
I am not asking your dog's name.

735
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:54,916
What's your full name?

736
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,318
Gulam Singh, Lakhan Singh, from Harayana.

737
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,801

00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,592
- Sir, he said girls...

739
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,902
What do you mean?

740
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:03,975
- No, no. What has happened?

741
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,447
Answer only what is asked from you.

742
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,653
Do you know him?

743
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,954
<i>How'?</i>

744
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,876

748
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,504

Ravindra Taleja, sir.

750
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,659
Sir, they are decent people.

751
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,880
They have come here for the first time.

752
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,091
Sir, have they done something wrong?

753
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,968
Too much. Anyway.

754
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,391

Understood.

761
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,366
And yes. If you saw
the drug supplier...

762
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,864
...who gave you this bag, then call me on this number.

763
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,995
Okay?
- Thank you. Be good.

764
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,700
Thank you.

765
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,748
OK bye.

766
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,415
You fool, I told you stay away from the police.

767
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,549
Say it to him! To him! Fool!

768
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,695
Are you happy now'?

769
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,948
Are you happy? BA pass!

770
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,135
His English has given me a headache!

771
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,249
I explained so much lo him!

772
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:10,040
I explained so much!

773
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:10,885
That this is a bag of trouble!

774
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:11,413
Let's dispose it off!

775
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,593
Let's throw it away!

776
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,518
No! You were happily saying...

777
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,099
What were you saying to me dancing with delight?

778
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,698
Let's go to the police!

779
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:20,001
We will receive a reward!

780
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,482
Our photo will be published in the newspaper!

781
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,612
Shall I give you a tight punch!

782
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,407
If the police didn't thrash us black and blue...

783
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,405
...lhen it was only because my mother...

784
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,077
...had done some good deeds in the past life.

785
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,497
Yesterday's kids are leaching us.

786
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,183
Heroine for a drama.

787
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,194
It's very tough.

788
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,039
There is one man who can do it.

789
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,170
If he can't do it, then it's a lost case.

790
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,922
Who?
- Guru.

791
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,169
Guru? I don't want to deal with sages...

792
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:49,205
- His name is Guru.

793
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,507
Before he was a band master.

794
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,137
A girl used to dance in his group.

795
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,018
She was fabulous dancer.

796
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,436
I don't wan! to get a 'Mujra' done.

797
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,613
Listen to me first.

798
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,959
Western classical dance.

799
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,561
After that I don't know what happened.

800
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,439
Guru stopped singing and he started drinking.

801
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,645
If he is a drunkard than from where will he get a girl?

802
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:04,945
Give him a couple of bottles.

803
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,568
Whiskey.

804
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,737
Guru.

805
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,948
Guru.
- Yes.

806
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,498
Actually the thing is that a movie hero has come.

807
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,768
He has a small problem.

808
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,527
You can help him.

809
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,537
That's why I have brought this bottle.

810
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,123
Please solve his problem.

811
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,462
Brother! Come, come.

812
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,908
- What happened?
 He gave his consent?

813
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,046
Not yet, but it will be done.

814
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:30,659
You don't worry.

815
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,511
I lied a bit about you.

816
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,519
I said you make movies and you are the main hero in that.

817
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,141
What's wrong in a drama?

818
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,566
No girl will work in a drama, TV serial.
- Bull...

819
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,476
Do you want a girl or not'?
- Yes.

820
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,482
Then you come quietly and don't eat my brains.

821
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,813
But I want a 'Kancha' girl.

822
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,239
You don't want to perform a drama, but play with her?

823
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,739
I mean a beautiful girl.

824
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:50,595
- Come, come.

825
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,083
You have gone mad slaying in London.

826
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:52,598
- Come, come.

827
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,699
Coming, coming.

828
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,911
Guru.
- Who's that?

829
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:57,819
He is Mr. Bunty.

830
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:58,598
Touch his feet.

831
00:38:58,624 --> 00:38:59,267
- Greetings.

832
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,664
Do you know him? His name is Bunty.
- Bunty?

833
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,550
You must have heard about his movies?

834
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,133
He directs his own movie and he is the lead hero in that.

835
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,653
Guru, I am not that person.

836
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,704
He is that person.

837
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,514
I had spoken to you about him.

838
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,969
Then who are you?

839
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,847
I am Gullu, the cab driver.

840
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,287
Okay, you are Gullu.

841
00:39:22,313 --> 00:39:23,959
And he is the cab driver.

842
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,223
No, no. I am both of it.

843
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:26,128
- Then who is he?

844
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,277
He is Bunty!

845
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,904
What is he doing in the movies?

846
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,733
Hey, you both don't make me go mad.
Enough of it!

847
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,526
Ask him that the reason why I have come here...

848
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,532
...I want to solve that problem.

849
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,954
Ask him where will I find the girl.

850
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,581
You want women?

851
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,867
No, no. Not women.

852
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,294
He wants one girl to work in the movie.

853
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,032
And that too an Indian girl.

854
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:46,147
- You will get it.

855
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,576
Guru, that girl...

856
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,109
please arrange fast.

857
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,720
I forgot. 200 years ago...
- 200 years!

858
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,921
2 years... 2 years.

859
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,484
There was a girl in Rock and Roll group.

860
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,116
You can have her.

861
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,804
What was her name?

862
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,056
Tell him the name!

863
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,558
Padminil Shankhnil Mohini.

864
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,401
Not old times names.

865
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:03,335
Tell him some modern names.

866
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,849
Julie, Seema, Reema...

867
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,565
Hakka.

868
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,566
Is this some witch's name'? Hakka.

869
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,297
It is not a witch's name.

870
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:12,594
It's my man's name.

871
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,868
Not man, he wants a girl.
- Shut up!

872
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,075
Hakka... is my man.

873
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,625
Go to him and he will tell you where the girl stays.

874
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,086
Then let's go.
- Where?

875
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,755
To Hakka's place. To find Hakka.

876
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:29,916
I forgot.

877
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,334
One minute.

878
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,635
If you would have met me yesterday... I would...

879
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,762
...have introduced the heroine then.

880
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,806
You don't know that I have high contacts.

881
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,634
I know almost all the heroines.

882
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,594
You know, my mom was English, and my pop...

883
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,929
...Come, sit in the car.

884
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,264
And I am the result.

885
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,066
We have reached so quickly.

886
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,256
Hakka, come out.

887
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,984
You gel in. 
We have not started the car.

888
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,690
Come... I am there...

889
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,894
Is he mad? I hope he

890
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,305
won't ruin all my money.

891
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,100
No. You don't worry.

892
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:58,182
Everything will be right.
- Sure?

893
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,704
Everything will be fine. Let's go.

894
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,826
Have we reached there?

895
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:01,952
We have still not reached.

896
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,250
Why do you get out again and again?
Let's go!

897
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,921
Hey Boys! Had Hakka come here?

898
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,676
Some people had come to recover money.

899
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,805
Since then he is missing.

900
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,651
Must be at home.

901
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,704
What's the matter, Guru?

902
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,637
This man wants lo sign him for his movie.

903
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,642
Anybody knows Hakka's home?

904
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,814
This drunkard...
- Yes, I know it.

905
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,648
Why are you all guys coming?

906
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,163
Hey what are you all doing?

907
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:33,978
Only 1-2 guys come.

908
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:34,973
Why is everybody coming?

909
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,779
Move.

910
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,967
Hey look! That is Hakka!

911
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,771

912
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,248
Don't run like this!

913
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,921
I will give it!

914
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,759
This man wants lo sign you for movies!

915
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,843
What?

916
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,731
If you want a role, then you will have...

917
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,729
...to make that girl a heroine...

918
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,025
...the one who used to work in your group.

919
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,227
What's her name?

920
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,904
Name...

921
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,543
What will we do with the name?

922
00:42:58,569 --> 00:42:59,757
Do I want to marry her?

923
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,012
Forget the name. Brother.

924
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:02,309
Tell me where does she stay?

925
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,691
For that we will have

926
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:04,854

927
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,747
Then let's go home.
- How?

928
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,444
What do you mean?

929
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,440
Why have I brought this red box!

930
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,834
Oh yes!
- Come.

931
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,244

933
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,406
- Where in Germany?

934
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,713
Don't worry, we will search for her.

935
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:20,320

Do I want the girl?

942
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,142
What? Huh?

943
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,102

944
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,438

I can't start it.

954
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,479

Who is this white rabbit'?

00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,194
Is it a ghost?
- No

989
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,543
Ghost's legs are abnormal.

990
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:48,350
Her legs are normal.

991
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,369
You drive without any hesitation.

992
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,536
She will move on her own.

993
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,208
Not this side!

994
00:45:57,234 --> 00:45:58,193
Turn that side!

995
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,048
Hey, lady in sari!

You found my car to die!

999
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,930
There are so many cars on this street!

1000
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,056
Choose any other car!

1001
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,606
Whenever I see your face, my entire day is ruined.

1002
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,024
I find all wrong people!

1003
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,438
Look, another air conditioned car is coming!

1004
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:23,940
Go and die there! Go!

1005
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,942
Go...

1006
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,396
What did you tell her!

1007
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:29,721
She is really going lo die!

1008
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,118
Then let her go! Let her die!

1009
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,951
Then we will be held responsible!
- How so?

1010
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,233
Who is the eyewitness of this incident?

1011
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,025
- We both.

1012
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,501
Then who will have lo take rounds oi the court?

1013
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,817
And I will lose my driving license!

1014
00:46:41,843 --> 00:46:43,030
Then go and stop him! Go!

1015
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,381
God knows why I came to London!

1016
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:49,007
Hey, widow woman! Have you gone mad?

1017
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,513
Let me go! Leave me!

1018
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,518
You have come from India just to commit suicide?

1019
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,973
You found this place to fight with...

1020
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,304
...your wife in the middle of the night!

1021
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,662
Go home and quarrel!

1022
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:01,507
Don't do it at a public place.

1023
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,045
Why should I tell you?
You get lost!

1024
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,429
Take your car!

1025
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,571
Leave me! Leave me!

1026
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,734
To die! Don't die in front of us!

1027
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,151
We don't want to make rounds of the court!

1028
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:17,363
Who are you to stop me'?

1029
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:19,753
- I am your brother...

1030
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,665
Oh God!
 You slapped her!

1031
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,166
Gullu, take out the cab!

1032
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,300
Have you gone mad!

1033
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,298
How can we leave her like this and go away?

1034
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,549
Then what should I do?

1035
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,053
Just think. If anything happened to her...

1036
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,013
...then you will hanged for committing a murder...

1037
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,060
...and I will be imprisoned.

1038
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,013
I have not murdered her!
Have you gone mad!

1039
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,398
Who saw you and her fighting'?

1040
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,612
That car driver.

1041
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,190
What if he went to the court and say it?

1042
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,655
Then... then what will we do?

1043
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,235
Tell me, dwarf.

1044
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,366
Hang on!

1045
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,030
Somebody will see us! Tell me!

1046
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,076
Hey! Will she do for you?

1047
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,710
Have you gone mad! lam talking about my problem.

1048
00:48:03,765 --> 00:48:05,382
And you are talking about supplying girls.

1049
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,338
I am not talking about that.

1050
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,460
You want a girl for your drama, don't you?

1051
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,631
Is she fine'?

1052
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,799
She? - Yes.

1053
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,047
This suicidal girl?
 - Yes, yes.

1054
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:11,756
Have you gone mad!

1055
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,345
If she commits suicide during the show...

1056
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,467
...then people will damage the chairs...

1057
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,593
...they will tear my clothes

1058
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,765
And the boss will commit suicide then.

1059
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,096
I don't want her.

1060
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,677
You don't have any other choice. Just think about it.

1061
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,858
You need a heroine.

1062
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,755
And she is going to commit suicide.

1063
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,524
Why does a person commit suicide?
Tell me!

1064
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,772
Because he has some tension or some problem.

1065
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,068
She loo has some financial problem.

1066
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,521
That's why she was going to commit suicide.

1067
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,072
If you will take her as a heroine...

1068
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,364
...then her financial problem will be solved.

1069
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,322
Your problem about a heroine will be solved.

1070
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,369
She will be happy and you too will be happy.

1071
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,536
And is as it is I am happy.

1072
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,704
Take the decision!

1073
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,782
I think God has given you the right opportunity.

1074
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,326
What if she refused?

1075
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,916
Then we will leave her here again.

1076
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:45,607
What do we care?

1077
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,121
We don't have anything to do with it?
- Yes.

1078
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,254
We will tell her to leave?
- Yes.

1079
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,381
Sure? 
- Yes.

1080
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,503
Fine.

1081
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,629
Carry her.

1082
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:52,804
You hold her sari.

1083
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,556
I will hold her blouse.

1084
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,153
- Come on, lift her

1085
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,140
She seems to be from a well lo do family.

1086
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,391
How do you know?

1087
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,394
She is so heavy.

1088
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,767
Then accordingly your family must be very poor.

1089
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,564
Really, she is too heavy!

1090
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,813
Does she eat the neighbors' kids?

1091
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,110
You kept her on my hand!

1092
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,803
What is this?

1093
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:21,472
- Now what happened?

1094
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,123
Where did he go? That drunkard'?

1095
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,451
Where is that drunkard'?

1096
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,203
Hope he didn't run away in this madness.

1097
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,289
Let him die, why should we bother?
Let's go.

1098
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,175
Now what are looking below the tyre?

1099
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,594
Come, please, please.

1100
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,145
Sir! Sir! That Bunty!

1101
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,274
He has died!

1102
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,401
No, he has brought a heroine!

1103
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,877
Move! Excuse me! 
Let Madam enter.

1104
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,336
Excuse me! Come!

1105
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,718
Take it easy. Silence!

1106
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:16,923
Hey hero.

1107
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,219
Give me this bag.

1108
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:23,431
Come, don't look here and there.

1109
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:24,812
Come, come.

1110
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,407
This is my room.
Now it's yours.

1111
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:27,329
- What about you?

1112
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,765
I will stay at the storehouse.

1113
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,315
Are you sure? - Yeah.

1114
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,680
Ladies bathroom is here.

1115
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:34,715
You can use that.

1116
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:35,817
And this is...

1117
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,272
I showed you your room.

1118
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:38,674
You go and rest in your room. OK?

1119
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,200
If you need anything, Anything...

1120
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,323
...sir, move, then call me.

1121
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,700
Okay. Okay.

1122
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,872
No need for thanks, she is our Heroine!

1123
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,441
Hey Dude! 
- Move your hand.

1124
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,274
- Introduce this girl lo us too.

1125
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,378
Tell her about your and our truth.

1126
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,417
I have told her what I had to tell her about you guys.

1127
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,297
Don't expect anything more from me.

1128
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,300
You guys are acting so smugly.

1129
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,256
Hey, give me your hand.

1130
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,471
This girl is perfect for the role oi a heroine.

1131
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,762
But tell me one thing. 
- What?

1132
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,897
From where did you abduct this girl?

1133
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,350
I have not abducted her.

1134
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,356
She is my uncle's best friend's daughter.

1135
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,482
Hi, Rupa. 
Had your bath?

1136
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,489
Your uncle? Here in London?
- Why?

1137
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,992
Strange! Your family has never ventured out of Borivali.

1138
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,247
And your uncle is in London?

1139
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:23,719
- Gel lost!

1140
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,529
I have no problem, if she becomes my heroine.

1141
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,663
Do you have any problem?

1142
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,740
What? What? 
What did you say?

1143
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,014
You don't have any problem?

1144
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,897
I do have a problem.

1145
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,296
Sir, my uncle's best friend has said this...

1146
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,502
...that Munni will work only in the play in which I am the hero.

1147
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,300
And he has also said that she will eat and drink...

1148
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,301
...only what I give her.

1149
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,552
I will look after her.

1150
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,302
And he has also said that she won't talk to anybody.

1151
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,888
Sir, you don't let this happen.

1152
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,390
He is snatching a hero's role from a hero.

1153
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,972
Sir, this is his ruse!

1154
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,777
My ruse! 
Sir, I am plotting a ruse!

1155
00:51:53,803 --> 00:51:54,375
- Yes.

1156
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,545
Sir, I edit hero's role!

1157
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,714
I will do it for him too.

1158
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,274
Sir, have you ever heard that a villain...

1159
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,276
...brings heroine for a hero?

1160
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,402
Have you ever heard of it?

1161
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:03,494
Hero is the one who takes away the heroine...

1162
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,405
...in front of the villain.

1163
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,283
That's it ! 
So it's decided!

1164
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,408
It's decided that from today you will...

1165
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,580
...be the villain and I will be the hero.

1166
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,787
No problem.

1167
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,710
Hey detective!
Who are you to take the decision?

1168
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,911
What are you doing!

1169
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,044
Sir, you decide! You decide.

1170
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,796
You will have to go and search for an Heroine.

1171
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,047
No, no. - What did he say?

1172
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,400
What is your problem in being the villain?

1173
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,171
There are 2 fights.

1174
00:52:25,197 --> 00:52:26,748
You will get the chance lo kick him.
Do it.

1175
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,017
Bull have always been the hero in all the plays.

1176
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,969
You have been a hero so many times before!

1177
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,021
Does he look like a hero?

1178
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,313
You don't talk about face and features.

1179
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,642
Otherwise I will have to find another guy.

1180
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:37,817
I had told you before!

1181
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,440
I heard it!

1182
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,817
I had told you before!

1183
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,570
The guy who will bring the heroine, he will be the hero.

1184
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,609
The guy who does it, he is the winner.

1185
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,779
That's it! Now will you play the role of a villain?

1186
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,450
Don't waste time, will you play the role of a villain or not?

1187
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,328
What happened to your nail'?

1188
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,661
The decision is made!

1189
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:56,353
Come! Let's go!

1190
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,413
Go to your rooms! Come on!

1191
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,203
Go and brush in the bathroom.

1192
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:01,526
Come on.
Okay! Bye-bye!

1193
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:20,571
OK, but I will be the villain in your real life.

1194
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,652
What are you looking at'?

1195
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,394
How beautiful it is?

1196
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,759
- That pair of swan?

1197
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,663
No, water. How deep would it be?

1198
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,038
I have not measured that.

1199
00:53:32,064 --> 00:53:33,895
I will come to know
if I jump in II.

1200
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,454
Shall I jump? - What?

1201
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,071
You only said that it's deep.

1202
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:42,901
I will jump in and check.

1203
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,969
I will jump in the deep, cold water.

1204
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,765
And my warn breath will leave my body gradually.

1205
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,808
After a short while, the body will start floating.

1206
00:53:56,108 --> 00:54:00,898
And with the waves, it will float away.

1207
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,486
Hey! Go in! 
Go in!

1208
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,863
It will float away!

1209
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,022
Has this bull entered the buffaloes den?

1210
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,451
Let me see...

1211
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,462
What was the need for you lo come here...

1212
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,959
...so late in the night to say this?

1213
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,510
But you will have to stay here carefully.

1214
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,236
Hey!

1215
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,155
What are you doing?

1216
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:29,792
You are here?

1217
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:30,633
- Where else will I be?

1218
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,819
I thought you were inside.

1219
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,667
Sir!
The bull has gone mad!

1220
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:38,766
Leave me!

1221
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,159
I won't leave you!

1222
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:42,190
I won't leave you!

1223
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,295
Sir, this man is not needed here.

1224
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:48,609
Not needed here!

1225
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,216
Sir, I don't want this man here.

1226
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,926
His thoughts are very filthy!

1227
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,051
Do you know what he was doing?

1228
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,553
He was peeping in Munni's room!

1229
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,058
He was teasing a sleeping woman.

1230
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,135
Babla!

1231
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,141
What rubbish!
Leave me!

1232
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,768
Sir, he is lying!
He is lying!

1233
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:03,716
He is talking rubbish!

1234
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:04,671
I was looking out for him!

1235
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,648
Why were you searching for me in her room?

1236
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:07,774
If you were looking out for me, then you should...

1237
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,105
...have search the bathroom.

1238
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,272
You sleep in the bathroom?

1239
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,656
Sir, I don't sleep in the bathroom!

1240
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,840
Sir, ask him.

1241
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:16,228
Wasn't he peeping in Munni's room?
Ask him!

1242
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:18,332
Were you peeping in Munni's room, Babla?

1243
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,823
Now, what can I say...

1244
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:20,957
Caught him! Caught him!

1245
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,534
Were you peeping or not?

1246
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,587
I was peeping inside because I wanted to know who is inside!

1247
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,976
Who will be inside! Sir,

1248
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:28,068
who will be inside?

1249
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,958
Poor Munni is inside!
She is sleeping]

1250
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,088
She was snoring!

1251
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,591
Poor Munni, were you peeping at her from the bathroom?

1252
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:37,098
Leave me! 
Let me talk!

1253
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,976
Listen!
I heard a man's voice inside.

1254
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,612
I saw it with my own ears.

1255
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:43,585
- Oh God!

1256
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,685
I heard it!

1257
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,741
Why don't I die!
Why don't I die!

1258
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:46,087
- Go and die!

1259
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,690
Sir! Sir, he is such a filthy man!

1260
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,147
To save himself, he is slandering Munni's image!

1261
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,690
Sir, ask him!
Ask him!

1262
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:58,576
Hang on!
Sir, to end the matter, open the door.

1263
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,202
The girl's room's door... what is she doing!

1264
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,582
I will check it out!

1265
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,125
No, you won't see it!

1266
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,285
I will see it!

1267
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:07,358
Sir, you won't see it. Sir!

1268
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,207
I will see, I am company's boss.

1269
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:09,906
I will see.

1270
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,084
Munni! - Munni!

1271
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,991
Its sir. Don't fear.

1272
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,366
Open the door.

1273
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,968
Open the door. Open the door.

1274
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,059
Munni... is somebody inside?

1275
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,223
There's no one, sir.

1276
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,151
There's no one.

1277
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,829
Fine, you go to sleep.

1278
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:31,720
Good night.

1279
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,918
What goodnight! Wait!

1280
00:57:32,944 --> 00:57:34,347
Did somebody check inside?

1281
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,612
Munni, with whom were you talking?

1282
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,611
Nobody, Babla.

1283
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,367
I heard you talking to somebody.

1284
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,871
That... that I was rehearsing my dialogues.

1285
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,703
You guys said that it should be ready by morning.

1286
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,955
What happened?

1287
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,169
Hey!

1288
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,886
Sir, this bull has gone mad!

1289
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,366
I will bury you alive!

1290
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,831
- The guy is hitting me!

1291
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,178
Leave him!

1292
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,228
Aren't you ashamed!

1293
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:05,708
Go and apologize to the girl!
Go!

1294
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,888
Go and apologise!

1295
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,064
Remember one thing!

1296
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,645
If you will respect the girl...

1297
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,771
...then the girl will give you her respect.

1298
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,649
Sorry! Made a mistake, sir!

1299
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,775
Punish him, sir!

1300
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:15,981
Otherwise I won't stay here.

1301
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,074
What punishment?

1302
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,200
Forgot! Forgot!

1303
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,653
When by mistake I had leased Anjali...

1304
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,783
...you all had made me wash the clothes.

1305
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,932
Forgot it, sir?

1306
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:24,765
Remind him.

1307
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,825
If he is not punished then I will...

1308
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:27,959
What?

1309
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,241
Otherwise I will leave Munni at her home!

1310
00:58:30,267 --> 00:58:30,858
Understood!

1311
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:32,834
Yes!

1312
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,325
He is right!
He should be punished!

1313
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,377
Law should be the same for everybody!

1314
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,716
What trouble is this!

1315
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,098
Hey!
From tomorrow you will cook for everybody!

1316
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,265
Are you happy?
- Yes.

1317
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:43,895
Its fine for now.

1318
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:44,702
But I will give the rest...

1319
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,011
...of the punishment later.

1320
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,687
Everybody go and sleep in their room.

1321
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,140
Bu! listen, nobody will go near that room!

1322
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,691
Understood!
Nobody will go there!

1323
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,813
Then do one thing.

1324
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,021
You stand outside the room at
night like a watchman. Fool!

1325
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,152
You keep awake the whole night just lo peep inside.

1326
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,155
You guys have made my life miserable!

1327
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:10,994
What are you looking at'?

1328
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,751
The burning flame looks so beautiful.

1329
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,085
Is it?

1330
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,750
Then immerse yourself in it.

1331
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,213
Eat it.

1332
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,095
Burning flame looks so beautiful.

1333
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,302
I will like if this fire eats me.

1334
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,855
Then Munni wont be there, and problems also wont be there.

1335
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,399
I will turn onto ashes and fly away in the sky.

1336
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,731
Like a free bird!

1337
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:38,991
Hey! If you want to make lea, then make tea.

1338
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,027
Otherwise go out.

1339
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,367
Fool, she scared me.

1340
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,865
Bunty, did you drink your tea.

1341
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,040
Shall I start now?

1342
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,166
We will do the rehearsal of the gun.

1343
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,288
Okay.

1344
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,796
Yes sir, play the music.

1345
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,129
What happened, sir?

1346
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,804
Ready. Ready... - Look here.

1347
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,465
Yes sir, play the music.

What happened?

1370
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,775
Why are you standing like that with your nose stuck?

1371
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,985
Come in.

1372
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,291
Get up you rascal.

1373
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,838
Break the scoundrel's legs!

1374
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,222
Come on take him!

1375
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,530
Where is that short guy?

1376
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:48,124
- Take him!

1377
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:51,928
Boss look there.

1378
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,889
Boss look there.

1379
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,794
You broke my leg!

1380
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,087
I'll show you!

1381
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,447
Catch him!

1382
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,507
Go! Go! Come on.

1383
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,249
Let's go! Let's go!

1384
01:01:22,275 --> 01:01:23,534
- Bring me his leg!

1385
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,888
Hello, did you see anyone running this way today.

1386
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:33,439
The one that broke your boss's leg, that one.

1387
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,850
Yes, yes him.

1388
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:35,976
He's gone straight.

1389
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,024
Hey guys! Get him!

1390
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,101
Even this news got published in the papers?

1391
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,861
Yes it got published.

1392
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,859
Boss! The news of you becoming...

1393
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,157
...a cripple got published in the newspaper.

1394
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:49,161
Really, these press people publish whatever I do.

1395
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,616
It is a sin to be famous isn't it'?

1396
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,867
Where did that scoundrel go'?

1397
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:52,993
There.

1398
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,537
What are you doing here, dancing?

1399
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:55,226
Go and catch him!

1400
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,035
You read what is written about me.

1401
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,957
Why did you get so shocked?

1402
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:04,964
The news is such.

1403
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,090
Anyway-

1404
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,261
I will read it.

1405
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,515
Hakka! Hakka!

1406
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,638
Come back.

1407
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,934
I have caught him!

1408
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,557
He is there!

1409
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,116
Come, come fast!

1410
01:02:17,142 --> 01:02:18,124
Break his leg!

1411
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,669
- Wail.

1412
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,566
Break his leg.

1413
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,899
He is my prey.
 - No.

1414
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,654
Give me this leg.
 - No.

1415
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,907
Give me this leg!
 - No!

1416
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,239
Quiet!
Will you take the leg home cook it and eat it.

1417
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,448
Break his legs.

1418
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,244
You broke my leg!

1419
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,413
Catch him! Catch him!

1420
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,669
Not him, catch me.

1421
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,967
Take me to a hospital.

1422
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,549
Sorry sir!
- It has broken!

1423
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,343
Come, let us write down the words of the songs.

1424
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,348
So that in the show it goes nicely.

1425
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,231
Without you, there is no desire.

1426
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,685
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1427
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,234
Fire, not tyre.

1428
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,942
It is fire, I write F like this.
- Inverted?

1429
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,447
You read it correctly.

1430
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:20,957
Without you I can't fly high, high, higher...

1431
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,226
Without you, there is no desire.

1432
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,641
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1433
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:48,527
Without you I can't fly high, high... high... high... yo!

1434
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,154
Without you, there is no desire.

1435
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,985
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1436
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:59,700
Without you I can't fly high, high... high... high... yo!

1437
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,220
Without you, I cannot find peace anywhere.

1438
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:14,430
What should I do, what should I not, that is the difficulty.

1439
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:21,231
Without you, I cannot find peace anywhere.

1440
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:25,316
What should I do, what should I not, that is the difficulty.

1441
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,648
In this condition I cannot find peace.

1442
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,790
Now I cannot slay alone.

1443
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,620
Without you, there is no desire.

1444
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,707
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1445
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:54,547
Without you I can't fly high, high... high... high... yo!

1446
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:20,572
It is my desire that you always be with me.

1447
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:26,332
My life should start with your name

1448
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:31,668
Wherever see, I should see you.

1449
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:36,505
Everywhere beloved there should be only you.

1450
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:42,435
Staying alone... I cannot find peace.

1451
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:47,687
No one explains this to the heart.

1452
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:52,566
Now I cannot live alone.

1453
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:59,199
Now I cannot live alone.

1454
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:02,201
Without you, there is no desire.

1455
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,783
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1456
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:10,748
Without you I can't fly high, high... high... high... yo!

1457
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:37,150
After meeting, now we shall never separate.

1458
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:42,908
The Lord should bond us in the bond of love.

1459
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:47,914
You should always be happy, my heart says so.

1460
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:53,249
That is all I pray to the Lord.

1461
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:58,588
Don't go far, away from me.

1462
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,976
Your thoughts should not torture me.

1463
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:08,855
Now I cannot slay alone.

1464
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,521
Now I cannot slay alone.

1465
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,356
Without you, there is no desire.

1466
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,192
Without you, my worlds on fire.

1467
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:26,782
Without you I can't fly high, high, high... high... yo.

1468
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:28,999
Thanks.

1469
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,410
For what?

1470
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,129
You helped me write the show.

1471
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,047
That's nothing.

1472
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,679
Nowadays, even you have started laughing.

1473
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,170
I have also learned acting, of living.

1474
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,514
Why do you always talk about depression?

1475
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,516
Who does not have a problem in his life?

1476
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,973
If every person will think of committing suicide like you.

1477
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,680
Then the population will rise.
- Rise.

1478
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:51,813
In Hell!

1479
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,480
You will get hurt.

1480
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:55,706
Yes, you are a very strong man.

1481
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:56,937
Okay stop this fooling around.

1482
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,067
From today you will not talk about dying.

1483
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,612
Who has seen the life after death Bunty?

1484
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,490
Okay, what if you gel tension up there too?

1485
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,697
That is why whatever you want to do, do it here.

1486
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,827
Fun, enjoyment everything.

1487
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,499
For you, everything is very easy.

1488
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,122
In love everything is easy.

1489
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,668
What? What did you say?

1490
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,922
What you heard.

1491
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,218
I did... 
- Not understand.

1492
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,136
I should leave now.

1493
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,259
You are running.

1494
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,559
Why are you running?
Face the situation.

1495
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,136
Be brave, Munni. Come on, face the problem.

1496
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:31,725
What do you mean?

1497
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,895
You girls are very smart.

1498
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,730
You know everything, but still you want to hear it from us.

1499
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,768
No matter.

1500
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,113
I am a resident of Mumbai, I am B.A in english.

1501
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,444
Learn well enough

1502
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,251
lam in love and I want to gel married.

1503
01:08:45,277 --> 01:08:46,761
- I should leave now.

1504
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,405
Munni, I love you Munni.

1505
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,124
Listen to me Munni.

1506
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,331
You cannot hide the truth, you will have to answer me.

1507
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,288
I will tell you later. Later.

1508
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,186
Munni.

1509
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,773
Look there is nothing to worry.

1510
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,282
She is unconscious because of the incident.

1511
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,443
Rest everything is fine.

1512
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,785
How are you all related to her'?

1513
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,116
She is the heroine of our play.

1514
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,449
Maybe I have seen you somewhere?

1515
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,167
No... yes.

1516
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:41,799
You are the one, you both {ought that night...

1517
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,960
...and she jumped in front of my car.

1518
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,469
Yes... yes.

1519
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,803
But you said she is the daughter of your uncle's best friend.

1520
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,763
Does that girl have a habit of committing suicide?

1521
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,394
Yes, yes she had told me once.

1522
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,430
That she will immerse herself in fire.

1523
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,814
She had told me once too, that...

1524
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:57,939
...she will drown herself in the pond.

1525
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,101
And now she jumped in front of the car.

1526
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,062
Seems like her mental condition is not stable.

1527
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:06,201
So <i>my</i> intuition was right, she is mad isn't it.

1528
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,033
You should not say like that.

1529
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,866
Yes, this is also a kind of madness.

1530
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,827
The person always keeps thinking about dying.

1531
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,834
And in our language ii is called suicidal tendency.

1532
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,371
I think she needs psychiatric help.

1533
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:24,839
Just a minute, doctor, please come here. Hurry.

1534
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,381
Have you see sir'?

1535
01:10:25,407 --> 01:10:26,448
He is taking the doctor to the side.

1536
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,306
What is the meaning of taking doctor aside?

1537
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,890
And I told her that you can become the heroine of our play.

1538
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,480
You will also earn some money.

1539
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,861
And even our problem will be solved.

1540
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,192
Enough! That is all I know about her.

1541
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,982
And she had even agreed to do it.

1542
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,868
Doctor, she is regaining consciousness.

1543
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:52,994
OK. Thanks.

1544
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,530
Look, she has regained conscience.

1545
01:10:56,226 --> 01:11:02,257
If you want then you can go in and meet her.

1546
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,794
Which place is this?

1547
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,293
How did I come here?

1548
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,090
Relax, relax.

1549
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,851
Who are all these people?

1550
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,306
You don't know them'!

1551
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:19,210
You are working with them.

1552
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,813
Looks like even she doesn't know english, like us.

1553
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,153
Didn't you recognise us?

1554
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,073
You work with us. 
In a drama.

1555
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,029
With you.

1556
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,820
I am the boss. Director.

1557
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,912
What boss? 
Where is my husband?

1558
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,121
Husband.

1559
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,914
You are still not married, that...

1560
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,207
...is why people were still after you.

1561
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,549
You had an accident that is why we brought you here.

1562
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:54,932
What nonsense are you talking, I don't know you all.

1563
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,888
Please call my husband.

1564
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,554
What husband?
Where does he stay?

1565
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,557
Vikram Chauhan, he stays in Liverpool.

1566
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:07,524
His number, 079 - 6420708.

1567
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,934
What is this'?
Tears in your eyes.

1568
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,474
What does he expect, lime juice.

1569
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:00,157
Doctor sir, you did a very big favour on me.

1570
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,159
You returned to me my lost wife.

1571
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,458
How can I ever thank you'?

1572
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,998
If you want to thank anyone then...

1573
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,258
...thank them who saved your wife's life.

1574
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,013
I don't know you people, but I would like to say...

1575
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:19,016
...that whatever you did, I cannot forget that for my life.

1576
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,973
Nisha and I were got married 2 years ago.

1577
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,979
After marriage I found out that her...

1578
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,186
...mental condition is not right.

1579
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,647
She even tried to commit suicide once.

1580
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,187
Then I took her to the hospital.

1581
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,233
The doctors said that she has suicidal tendencies.

1582
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:37,026
And for treatment, they will have to...

1583
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,285
...keep her in the hospital for a few days.

1584
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,413
Suddenly one day the doctor called from the hospital.

1585
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,074
He said that she has disappeared from the hospital.

1586
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,576
I lodged a police complaint.

1587
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,497
Here is the medical report and the police complaint.

1588
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,048
Because of you, my wife is safe.

1589
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,380
I am very grateful to all of you.

1590
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,045
You not only returned my wife, but you have...

1591
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,054
...returned me my whole life.

1592
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,217
Yes, now you can take her, she is well anyway.

1593
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,262
But bring her back here after 1 week for check up.

1594
01:14:04,957 --> 01:14:06,733
Because in such cases, this can happen again.

1595
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:07,689
Okay doctor sir.

1596
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,066
For Nisha's treatment we will stay in London...

1597
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,068
...in our friends guesthouse.

1598
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,322
As soon as she is fine, we will go back our home in Liverpool.

1599
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:19,156
If you need anything, then here is my card.

1600
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,084
The doctor said that because of me...

1601
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,499
...all of you had to face a lot of troubles.

1602
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,089
Whatever I did, I did not do it purposely.

1603
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,299
I did it because of my illness.

1604
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,386
And if possible, then please forget it.

1605
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,216
Who could it be, so late at night.

1606
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,237
Hello.

1607
01:15:25,263 --> 01:15:26,910
- I am Nisha here.

1608
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:29,105
Tell Bunty to save me!

1609
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,265
What happened?

1610
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:31,523
This man is not my husband.

1611
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,525
Bunty is my husband.

1612
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,152
Bunty is your husband.

1613
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,437
But when did you get married?

1614
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,926
You please call Bunty!

1615
01:15:37,952 --> 01:15:39,257
Please call Bunty!

1616
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,410
Bunty, Bunty she has called again.

1617
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,536
Who?
- Her phone, looks like she has...

1618
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,697
...got an bout of craziness again.

1619
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,517
Whom?

1620
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,609
- To Munni, come, come.
She is crying on the phone.

1621
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,421
Bunty, Bunty please come and take me from here.

1622
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,253
I don't want to stay here.

1623
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,167
Munni, what are you saying?

1624
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,300
You are his wife Munni.

1625
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,506
Are you coming or not?

1626
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,181
Look, a can of petrol and a box of matches are lying here.

1627
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,182
If you will not come then I will pour...

1628
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,809
...he petrol on myself and kill myself.

1629
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,140
You will not do anything like that.

1630
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,146
Bunty if you will not come here in half an hour...

1631
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,307
...then I will kill myself!

1632
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,315
I promise that I will die.

1633
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,101
Why are you talking like that?

1634
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,871
Nisha! 
Open the door.

1635
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,790
Nisha!
 Please!

1636
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,671
Nisha!
Open the door.

1637
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,378
Nisha!
 Open the door.

1638
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,469
Nisha!

1639
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,675
Nisha!

1640
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:49,866
What is all this?

1641
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:50,825
Their food.

1642
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,623
Their food! First let them decide...

1643
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,202
...whether they are going to perform tonight or not.

1644
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,377
Then you can give them food, understand?

1645
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,955
Otherwise who will pay the penalty, your father?

1646
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,335
Their food!

1647
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:02,774
Don't sleep, wake up!

1648
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,702
The heroine that you had showed me there.

1649
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,212
That was good.

1650
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,846
The other heroine that you showed me this time.

1651
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,013
Even that was good.

1652
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,675
But now she is dead.

1653
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,226
Now whatever had to happen has happened.

1654
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,644
I don't care about that.

1655
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:15,221
Now the show has to go on.

1656
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,977
And if you do not perform the show.

1657
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:21,106
Then you will do a show everyday in the jail here.

1658
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,778
We have found a solution.

1659
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,651
We will not enact this drama, we will...

1660
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,653
...enact another drama in which there is no heroine.

1661
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,154
I don't know anything.

1662
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:31,873
Anyhow this show must go on, understand.

1663
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,832
Shekhar, this time you will surely get the goods.

1664
01:18:38,686 --> 01:18:44,969
Please give me one chance.
Only one chance.

1665
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,835
Last time the secret police caught our goods.

1666
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:47,966
Yes boss.

1667
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,792
This time nothing should go wrong.

1668
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:50,323
- Yes boss.

1669
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:52,383
Because I will be with you at the time of the deal.

1670
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:52,874
- Yes, Boss.

1671
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,077
To keep an eye on you.

1672
01:18:54,103 --> 01:18:54,702
- Yes, Boss.

1673
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,790
And we will not make he deal in a lonely place.

1674
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:57,288
- Yes, Boss.

1675
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:58,785
We will do it in a public place.

1676
01:18:58,811 --> 01:18:59,339
- Yes, Boss.

1677
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,706
So that no one suspects us.

1678
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:02,718
- Yes boss.

1679
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,988
Now, in London, where will we find Peacock feathers?

1680
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,070
Let me look where we can find a Peacock. 
Aunty, please move.

1681
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,876
Bawla!
- Got it! Bawla, come quickly.

1682
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,039
What happened?

1683
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:27,460
Come quickly.
- What happened now?

1684
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:32,094
Come with me. I just saw that girl here, there...

1685
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,428
Whom did you see?

1686
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,472
Excuse me...

1687
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,769
Why has your voice become low?

1688
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,851
What happened?
- You come quietly. Come.

1689
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,401
But whom did you see?

1690
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:46,934
I saw her around here.

1691
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,259
- Whom? The one with drugs?

1692
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,360
Just like that.

1693
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,243
That one. Yes!

1694
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,911
Where did she go'?

1695
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,796
Hello.
What is happening here?

1696
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,832
Sir, I have seen that girl sir'?

1697
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:07,962
Who?

1698
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,510
The one that burned herself to death.

1699
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,338
Who, Nisha?

1700
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:13,801
Yes. Exactly.

1701
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:15,767
Nonsense!
This is impossible, how can that happen?

1702
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:18,021
Sir please believe me, I have seen her myself.

1703
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,432
I have seen her sir.

1704
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,230
Sir, since that mad girl has died, even he has become mad.

1705
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,853
He himself says that she is dead.

1706
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,017
And now he says that he has seen her.

1707
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,192
How can he see her?

1708
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,478
Have you gone mad'? 
I have seen.

1709
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:28,778
Sir, please believe me sir.

1710
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,358
I have seen her with my own eyes.

1711
01:20:30,384 --> 01:20:31,348
Please believe me, sir.

1712
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,379
Yes boss.

1713
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,113
This time there should not be any mistake.

1714
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:47,527
- Yes boss.

1715
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,166
Be alert.
 - Yes boss.

1716
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,700
They will have a red bag, the other party.

1717
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:52,328
- Yes boss.

1718
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,522
I have already talked to the other party.

1719
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:55,121
- Yes, Boss.

1720
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,138
I will wait for you in the car.

1721
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:57,871
- Yes boss.

1722
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,891
And this time the deal should be completed.

1723
01:20:59,917 --> 01:21:00,373
- Yes boss.

1724
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,054
Get lost! - Yes boss.

1725
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:03,810
Get lost. 
- Yes boss

1726
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,233
Look, I know Nisha very well.

1727
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:07,563
I myself saw her dead body.

1728
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,228
What are you saying'?
You are saying strange things.

1729
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,942
Anyway, which way did you see her go?

1730
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,113
This way sir.

1731
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:16,948
This way sir.

1732
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:18,324
Boss, boss secret police.

1733
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:21,998
Sir, I saw her that side.

1734
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,837
Boss, boss secret police.

1735
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,005
Where? Where?

1736
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:30,882
There they are, and even the commissioner is along with them.

1737
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,259
What are you doing here?

1738
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:33,885
Boss, open the door.

1739
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:37,014
I don't know you people, who are you?

1740
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,592
I don't know you people, Save yourselves.

1741
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,434
Boss!

1742
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:42,557
Is that it, Boss?

1743
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,097
Police!

1744
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:53,946
Where is she?

1745
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:55,987
Where is she?

1746
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,194
I swear sir, I saw that girl.

1747
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,870
She has come this way.

1748
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:05,580
Ii is your imagination, you must have seen someone else.

1749
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:08,037
And anyway, the dead don't come back.

1750
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:39,470
And yes, I am coming on Your show.

1751
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:40,538
- OK, sir.

1752
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:41,772
Come, sir.
 This is your seat.

1753
01:22:41,798 --> 01:22:42,350
- Thank you.

1754
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,353
Sir, meet him. 
Mr. Rahul, sir.

1755
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:47,522
- How do you do?

1756
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,203
Mr. Walter. 
- Pleasure.

1757
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,708
Ladies and gentlemen.

1758
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:01,550
A grand welcome to everyone...

1759
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:02,974
Both of you are still not ready yet.

1760
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:04,927
Get ready fast, announcement is already made.

1761
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,227
I will relieve myself and come.

1762
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:10,186
Why do you always have to do it before the show?

1763
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:14,312
Where is the bathroom?

1764
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,949
If had known before, I would have...

1765
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,152
...finished in the morning itself!

1766
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,328
Where is the bathroom?

1767
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,506
Ghost.

1768
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,528
Did you do it more'? 
Why are you panting like this?

1769
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:00,987
Ghost! Ghost!
 - Ghost!

1770
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,660
The girl that had died.

1771
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,410
Munni? 
- Munni?

1772
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,541
I saw her ghost.

1773
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,163
Even you saw her ghost.

1774
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,041
Even you, I mean did you also see'?

1775
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,421
I am asking that where did you see it?

1776
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:15,069
I saw it twice.

1777
01:24:15,095 --> 01:24:16,023
- I am not asking the count...

1778
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,049
...but where did you see?

1779
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,427
Come I will show you.
- Come.

1780
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,304
Where is it'?
 Where? - Further.

1781
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,519
Come there, there.

1782
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,284
Sir.

1783
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:41,408
What did you do?

1784
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:42,322
You fired a bullet'?

1785
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,384
He is dead. 
- I didn't kill him, I didn't fire a bullet!

1786
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,137
The gun is in your hand.
Did he die by himself?

1787
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:52,098
If anyone sees us, then they will think...

1788
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,100
...that we have committed this murder.

1789
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,557
Not we. He has done it!

1790
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:57,687
I have not done it understand!

1791
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,858
I have not done it!

1792
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,190
Hey quiet, quiet!

1793
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,528
Now we only have to think to save ourselves.

1794
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,444
Look, I did not shoot him.

1795
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,112
You please don't say like that.

1796
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,665
Until the show is not over, no one should see this dead body.

1797
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:14,787
We will hide it somewhere.

1798
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,293
And if anyone sees it after the show.

1799
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:19,170
Then no one will suspect us.

1800
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,172
Where will we hide ii, in our pockets?

1801
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,171
Anywhere, lake him away from here.

1802
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,177
It seems like we are very unlucky.

1803
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,385
This is the way to go to the bathroom too. Hide him somewhere.

1804
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,183
Lift him up. 
- Boss, help us.

1805
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:44,155
Welcome. The chief guest of our today's program...

1806
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:49,281
...is the police commissioner Mr. J.D. Mehra.

1807
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:53,580
On my behalf and on all of your behalf, I kindly welcome him.

1808
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,158
And I request to him that, please...

1809
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:59,916
...light the lamp with his hands and grace the show.

1810
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,341
Do one thing, push him in there.

1811
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,714
Come, lift him.

1812
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,712
Hurry UP-

1813
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,076
Let the head go first.
Let the head go first.

1814
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:11,577
- Hurry up.

1815
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:18,048
Push him in.
 - Put him in.

1816
01:27:18,074 --> 01:27:21,710
- Push! 
- Put it in!

1817
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:25,191
It's not going in, what do we do?

1818
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,648
...Forget the corpse, come let's go.

1819
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,610
And yes, remove this tunic, fast.

1820
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,495
Everything is visible.

1821
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,994
Oh, this gun.
- What happened?

1822
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,649
- Wipe the prints.

1823
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:38,746
Come on fast.

1824
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,834
Come on Roopa. 
- Hi.

1825
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,254
Come, fast. Come.

1826
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,295
Come, fast. Come.

1827
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:51,982
Is there anyone in the room?

1828
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:52,531
- No one.

1829
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,974
Change your clothes, fast!

1830
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,329
Train is ready.

1831
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,336
Beloved.

1832
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:30,339
Beautiful, beautiful meetings.

1833
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:34,013
Your talks, Aafreen, beautiful, our meetings.

1834
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:38,264
Beloved, beautiful.

1835
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,813
These eyes, this style.

1836
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,686
Aafreen.

1837
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:48,274
In the darkness of the midnight.

1838
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,573
May lose your Heart.

1839
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:55,952
In the darkness of the midnight.

1840
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:59,622
Something might happen.

1841
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:04,833
Beloved, beautiful. Meetings

1842
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:08,795
Your talks, Aafreen.

1843
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:14,555
Beloved, beautiful. Meetings

1844
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,472
Your grace, beautiful.

1845
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,550
Aafreen.

1846
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,729
In the darkness of the midnight.

1847
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,854
Chain, chain.

1848
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,561
Something might happen.

1849
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,438
<i>My sham my.</i>

1850
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,315
In the darkness of the midnight.

1851
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,442
Something might happen.

1852
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,319
I not talking about that chain, I am...

1853
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:34,745
...talking about the chain in my neck.

1854
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,452
Where did you leave?

1855
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:40,596
Seems like I left it in the hands of the dead body.

1856
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,622
What will we do now?

1857
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:42,828
Let us go and see.

1858
01:30:14,222 --> 01:30:20,581
You are mad'! The whole corpse is missing...

1859
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:21,788
...and you are talking about your chain?

1860
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,960
But whatever happened, the corpse vanished by itself, thank God.

1861
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,412
God is great, this means we don't have...

1862
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,046
...anything to do with the corpse?

1863
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,466
No! - That means we are safe.

1864
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,669
Come, lets change our costumes fast and go to the stage.

1865
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:40,766
The silence is indicating.

1866
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:45,976
The scene is intoxicating.

1867
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:49,391
Beloved, beautiful.

1868
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,819
Your grace, beautiful.

1869
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,820
These scenes, Aafreen.

1870
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:59,030
In the darkness of the midnight.

1871
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:02,157
May lose my Heart.

1872
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:06,583
In the darkness of the midnight.

1873
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:10,166
Something might happen.

1874
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:10,223
Some are insane, and some are mad here.

1875
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,480
The atmosphere is murderous...

1876
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:18,234
...everyone's life is in danger.

1877
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:20,865
The impatient ness is growing.

1878
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,817
Where have we come.

1879
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:27,239
Beloved, beautiful.

1880
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:32,254
My beauty, your beauty, Aafreen.

1881
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:40,757
In the darkness of the midnight.

1882
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:44,013
May lose my Heart.

1883
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:48,514
In the darkness of the midnight.

1884
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,143
Something might happen.

1885
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,274
Please do not panic.

1886
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,022
Move! Move!

1887
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:21,603
Please do not panic.

1888
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,734
Until the police are investigating.

1889
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,611
Please remain in your seats.

1890
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,113
Please close the Hall. Thank you.

1891
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,665
We will have to do something...

1892
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,305
...about the secret police.

1893
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:40,981
- Yes boss.

1894
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:43,635
They are always after me.

1895
01:34:43,661 --> 01:34:44,700
- Yes boss.

1896
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,513
Will you do what I say?

1897
01:34:46,539 --> 01:34:47,408
- Yes boss.

1898
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,838
Hit...

1899
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:54,181
Listen to what I have say first!

1900
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,345
Not me, kill them both.

1901
01:34:57,371 --> 01:34:58,669
- Yes boss.

1902
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,771
I don't know how you will kill them.

1903
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:03,103
But kill them! - Yes boss.

1904
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:06,028
If anyone interferes, then kill them too!

1905
01:35:06,054 --> 01:35:06,761
- Yes boss.

1906
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,763
Officer, did they say anything?

1907
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,682
They say that don't know anything.

1908
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,433
I know that they know everything.

1909
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:39,977
Officer.

1910
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,691
Before I tell you who this tunic belongs to...

1911
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,792
...it will be better if you tell me yourself.

1912
01:35:51,818 --> 01:35:52,348
- Don't know.

1913
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,449
You recognise this don't you, whose is this?

1914
01:36:00,475 --> 01:36:01,107
- No, no.

1915
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:02,787
But this is Bawla's chain!

1916
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,086
This chain is mine, but the tunic is no! mine.

1917
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,462
The tunic is his.

1918
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,766
The tunic is mine but, I did not kill anyone.

1919
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,927
Then why are there blood stains on the tunic?

1920
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,060
He fired the bullet...

1921
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,015
We all did it together.

1922
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:23,395
Now they are accusing me.

1923
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,226
I will explain what happened.
Commissioner sir.

1924
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,812
Whatever you want to explain, do it in the police station.
Arrest them.

1925
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:48,041
Oh God, what is all this happening?

1926
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,376
I don't know anything myself.

1927
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:51,301
Unnecessarily I welcomed him.

1928
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:52,461
I should not have done the show.

1929
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:31,001
Will you eat alone, share it with others too...

1930
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,881
Let me eat it first, it is very hard.

1931
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,469
Have you gone mad, this is a bomb!

1932
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:39,054
Sir, run fast...

1933
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:41,418
Come fast sir, don't sleep.

1934
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:42,416
- Run! Run!

1935
01:37:58,289 --> 01:37:59,495
Where did that bomb come from?

1936
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:00,912
I don't know.

1937
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,912
That man ate it a little and threw at me.

1938
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:05,538
I thought that it was custard apple.

1939
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:07,541
Who was that'?

1940
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:08,997
How would I know'?
Why are you asking me?

1941
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:10,381
Then who should I ask?

1942
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:12,416
Go and ask the one who threw that bomb.

1943
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,881
Let us do one thing, let us go back to India.

1944
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:17,889
How will we go?
The passport is with he police.

1945
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:19,890
Okay tell me one thing, if we will start running...

1946
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,016
...along the railway tracks.

1947
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,093
Then what do you think, when will we reach India.

1948
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:23,302
Tell me.

1949
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:24,854
Do you have a daughter?

1950
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:25,976
My sister has a daughter, 5 years old.

1951
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,307
What do want tell me'?

1952
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:28,858
When we will reach India, your sister's daughter's...

1953
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:31,071
...granddaughter would be getting married.

1954
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,858
Then we will have to buy a present for her.

1955
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,407
Keep quiet! You always keep talking nonsense.

1956
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:41,154
Look, the Lord always come to help in someway or the other.

1957
01:38:41,974 --> 01:38:43,083
This time he has come in the form of a bomb.

1958
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:44,039
Then it must be Lord Shiva.

1959
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,165
Hail Barn Bhole.

1960
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:48,040
Yes, Bam Bhole.

1961
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:49,879
Now we have to think, that how can...

1962
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,047
...we prove ourselves innocent?

1963
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,924
How? - That is what we have to think.

1964
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:07,475
I am dead.

1965
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:12,351
Go, and bring that rat to me.

1966
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:22,077
Shut up, you rat.
You scoundrel, I will break your...

1967
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,123
...arms and legs and hang in the museum today.

1968
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:26,540
Where is that scoundrel?

1969
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,125
Look, you don't beat me. 
Your...

1970
01:39:30,151 --> 01:39:30,858
- Oh!

1971
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:34,086
After breaking your legs he has disappeared.

1972
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:37,339
Careful. Otherwise I will be on hospital bed.

1973
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,388
They have disappeared, or have you hid them.

1974
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:41,513
You are trying to act smart.

1975
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:43,091
Pick up his taxi.

1976
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,802
How can we pick it up, it is very heavy.

1977
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,137
Shall we all pick it up?

1978
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,722
You fool, it has four tyres...

1979
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:51,307
You can drive it.

1980
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:54,644
Sir. Please have mercy on my taxi.

1981
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:58,231
You smarty, until you will not bring them to me.

1982
01:39:58,451 --> 01:39:59,440
Your taxi will remain with me.

1983
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:00,574
Go.

1984
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:02,651
Hey what are you doing?

1985
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:04,578
Wait!

1986
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,245
Where are you taking my taxi, you scoundrels!

1987
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,579
It is not my taxi, it is on rent!

1988
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:15,915
My owner will kill me! 
Wait!

1989
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,101
God, save me.

1990
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:30,605
Come on, get up. 
Gel up!

1991
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:31,805
Can I get some tea'?

1992
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:33,524
Do you have money for the tea'?

1993
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,151
I did not lake the safe along with me...

1994
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,277
...when the police arrested me.

1995
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,400
I don't have any money with me.

1996
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,481
I have it. Come on, come on quickly.

1997
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,483
Come on, come on.

1998
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,864
Take the paper along, it will be of use again.

1999
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,502
Bawla. Here.

2000
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:06,891
Look, our photo has been published in the newspaper.

2001
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:09,807
Jut by one show we have become so famous in London?

2002
01:41:09,864 --> 01:41:11,356
Buy it, we will take it to India along with us.

2003
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,643
We will show it to everyone they will be very jealous.
 Buy it, buy it.

2004
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,228
I don't have a single penny.

2005
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,354
Leave it.

2006
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:17,651
Bunty son.

2007
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,195
Bunty 
- What happened?

2008
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:21,572
Our photo has been published In the papers.

2009
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:22,739
Come, come.

2010
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:27,404
You look so handsome in the picture.

2011
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,823
If you have money, then buy it.

2012
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:34,793
Read about my praises too along with yours.

2013
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:35,953
What is written tell me.

2014
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,210
The name of all three of us is written.

2015
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:39,336
All our names are written.

2016
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:40,507
But at least read what is written.

2017
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,214
I have read it all, come to the side I will tell you.

2018
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,340
What happened?

2019
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:44,511
Keep your head down and walk.

2020
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:45,637
What happened now?

2021
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:46,760
Bunty, what happened?

2022
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:48,261
Come on, fast.

2023
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:51,685
What happened now?

2024
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:53,221
It is written that we have killed famous...

2025
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,765
"businessman Vikram Chauhan and ﬂed away.

2026
01:41:58,404 --> 01:41:59,940
There are more praises written about us.

2027
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:02,238
It is written that our gang hurled...

2028
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,273
...a bomb inside the police car and help us run away.

2029
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,734
We have a gang, and we don't even know about it.

2030
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:09,240
Yes, and the police commissioner...

2031
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,994
...has given a shoot at sight order for us.

2032
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:18,670
You wanted to become famous...

2033
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:19,830
...now have you become famous.

2034
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:21,340
Come on.

2035
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,424
We'll discuss this, okay?

2036
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:31,638
Boss.

2037
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,388
We are discussing a murder... sorry matter, please go.

2038
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:36,555
Go, go.

2039
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,940
Come.

2040
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:39,980
Boss, both of them survived.
 - What?

2041
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:42,311
And there is another bad news boss.

2042
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,396
There was another man with them.

2043
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:45,527
Who was he'?

2044
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,825
He looked like to be their boss.
- Is it?

2045
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,532
But boss, there is also a good news.

2046
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:51,658
What?

2047
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,666
They are not secret police, they are terrorists.

2048
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:58,290
And they also have a big gang.

2049
01:42:58,506 --> 01:42:59,416
I found out all this from the T.V and the newspaper.

2050
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:00,542
If you want to see?

2051
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:01,713
The newspaper.

2052
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:17,017
You fool, they are not terrorist they are secret police!

2053
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:21,521
Didn't you see, they come with the police.

2054
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,318
Didn't you see? 
They travel with the police...

2055
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:24,444
...and that too not walking!

2056
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:28,821
In the police car! 
Do you think that I am a fool.

2057
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:33,700
This is all their trick, to fool us!

2058
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:38,994
This is their new plan, so that we do something wrong.

2059
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,329
And they catch us red handed.

2060
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:46,668
Mannu-bhai Gandhi...

2061
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,047
Mannu-bhai Gandhi here!

2062
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:56,306
Kindly, I am sorry Sher Khan.

2063
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:02,358
No, Sher Khan, there won't be any mistake this time. Promise.

2064
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:06,354
No, this time I will come myself to give...

2065
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:08,523
...you the delivery of the pouch.

2066
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:11,488
Give me one more chance. 
Just one more chance.

2067
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,120
Thank you very much.

2068
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:24,379
What a plight we are in.
 - Here.

2069
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:26,878
Have your last meal.

2070
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:29,585
Why for the last time?

2071
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:32,509
Because now I have very little money left.

2072
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:33,680
If you people have some money left...

2073
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:35,011
...then you can order something and eat it.

2074
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:36,426
I don't have a single penny with me.

2075
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:37,514
Then starve like beggars, until we...

2076
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:38,894
...don't prove ourselves innocent.

2077
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:41,392
How will we prove that we are innocent?

2078
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,057
One minute. 
There is one way.

2079
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:44,520
If we will go to Vikram's house.

2080
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:45,726
Where Munni burnt herself...

2081
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:47,111
She is already burnt to death.

2082
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:48,733
<i>And 'Imam is dead 'm me meme.</i>

2083
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:51,065
Then what will we do by going there? 
Mourn for both of them!

2084
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:55,536
I and sir have seen Munni, that means she is alive.

2085
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:58,410
Bull have not seen her, that means she is not alive.

2086
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:00,412
And if I have not seen someone and he is there...

2087
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:01,538
...I don't believe that.

2088
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,039
Have you seen Japan? - No.

2089
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:04,540
That means Japan is not there.

2090
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:08,420
Look we have only two ways.

2091
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:12,424
The first is that we can go to Vikram's house...

2092
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,426
...and look for evidence, anything...

2093
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:16,849
...anything that can prove that we are innocent.

2094
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:17,971
And he second way.

2095
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:19,051
There is no second way.

2096
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:38,870
Give me a hand. Come, come.

2097
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:45,207
Come sir.
- Come sir. Come.

2098
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:48,997
Careful.

2099
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:50,959
Careful.

2100
01:46:18,247 --> 01:46:19,362
Which language is this?

2101
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:22,869
It is upside down.

2102
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:31,961
Did you find anything?

2103
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:37,843
24, 2611, 4189.

2104
01:46:40,352 --> 01:46:41,717
Nothing, its just a cat.

2105
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:46,060
This is not a girls measurement, but an tent's.

2106
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:48,565
This is the number of fast track travel agency.

2107
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:53,070
And this... Munni has written this.

2108
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:54,022
How do you know?

2109
01:46:54,048 --> 01:46:55,965
Were you next to her when she was writing?

2110
01:46:55,993 --> 01:46:57,608
No, no. You look carefully,

2111
01:46:57,661 --> 01:47:00,277
the f of fast...
...it is written upside down.

2112
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:01,537
Munni always wrote her F upside down...

2113
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,080
...I myself have seen her writing.

2114
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:07,327
Did you listen, boss, Munni wrote f upside down.
- So what?

2115
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:10,746
Hundred percent this has been written by Munni.
- So what?

2116
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:12,881
I think she has gone to India.

2117
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:14,758
Then even we will have to go to India.

2118
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:16,088
Then do you want to go to pakistan and look from there.

2119
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,925
We will have lo go to Fast Track Travel Agency.
- Now?

2120
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:25,887
Excuse me gentlemen.

2121
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:30,562
Sir. Is there any booking made for India, in the...

2122
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:34,111
...for a name called Nisha? Any girl?

2123
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:37,774
I am sorry sir, we don't disclose passenger information.

2124
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,157
It is against the company policy.

2125
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:40,283
Sir. It is very important.

2126
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,160
I am sorry, but I can't help you.

2127
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:50,036
He is a english man, he will never help.

2128
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:53,789
If he is a english man then why are you asking him.

2129
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:55,167
What happened?

2130
01:47:55,193 --> 01:47:58,006
- He will not tell anything.

2131
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,842
Looks like we wont get it easily, we will act and try.

2132
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:04,844
Oh, my daughter!

2133
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:07,332
- Uncle, what happened?

2134
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:10,789
Uncle! Uncle, some one give water.

2135
01:48:10,815 --> 01:48:11,833
Call the police!

2136
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:12,536
What happened?

2137
01:48:12,562 --> 01:48:13,646
- What can I say sir.

2138
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:19,191
His daughter had a fight with him, and suddenly went away.

2139
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,029
I don't know when the girl will return.

2140
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,316
Speak in Urdu!

2141
01:48:22,342 --> 01:48:25,146
Now come here, and handle him.

2142
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:26,163
- What?

2143
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:26,834
Sir I'll tell you.

2144
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:27,973
Please come here for a second.

2145
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:32,165
This one had a fight with her sister and she left the house...

2146
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,421
...and she's gone away sir.

2147
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,297
She must have gone to India.

2148
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,947
You know, it's really, really...

2149
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:41,705
do it for him.

2150
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:42,843
It's a poor family sir.

2151
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:47,885
I'll see what I can do.
- Sir, please sir.

2152
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,348
What happened? Will he tell or not'?

2153
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:51,350
Uncle, she will come.

2154
01:48:51,376 --> 01:48:52,769
She will be back by evening.

2155
01:48:52,818 --> 01:48:54,024
Nisha.

2156
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:58,062
N I <i>s</i> h a.
- No, there's no Nisha.

2157
01:48:58,115 --> 01:49:01,699
Sir, her nickname is Munni. M u n n I.

2158
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:06,028
No.

2159
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:10,748
Any other girl...

2160
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,750
Indian name, from here to Delhi...

2161
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:14,957
...or Mumbai, anywhere to India, sir.

2162
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:16,793
No. I am afraid, there isn't, no.

2163
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:20,759
Alright sir. Thank you.

2164
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:24,425
My daughter.
- She's a sister, buddy.

2165
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:25,885
Come, don't arouse your whole family now.

2166
01:49:25,934 --> 01:49:27,094
Stop overacting.

2167
01:49:27,144 --> 01:49:28,429
What happened?
- Nothing.

2168
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:31,729
Excuse me sir, here is a booking.

2169
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:33,480
But not in the name of Nisha.

2170
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:35,186
In the name of Aditi.

2171
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,480
She is travelling on the 27th.

2172
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:40,737
Excuse me. 
Can you see if there is some contact number.

2173
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:43,069
Any kind of address or something, you know just

2174
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:45,492
there is number.

2175
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:50,372
02877451234.

2176
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:54,786
All right. Long live britishers.

2177
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:00,794
You thief, when you know her name is not Aditi...

2178
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:03,460
...then why did you take her number.

2179
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:05,803
Why can't her name be Aditi?

2180
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:08,966
When her name can be Aditi, Nisha, Munni.

2181
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:11,222
Then why can't her name be Aditi.

2182
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,761
God knows, how many Aditi's, gomatfs...

2183
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,101
...and many girls leaving for London?

2184
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:16,435
That are you Nisha or not.

2185
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:19,101
Champak sir, tell him that girl is dead.

2186
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:20,269
That girl is no more.

2187
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:21,402
I have seen her.

2188
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:23,780
I had forgotten that even you had seen her.

2189
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:25,157
You have seen the on that is not even alive.

2190
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:28,285
Search for her, that whether she is or not.

2191
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,132
Do you have any other work'!

2192
01:50:31,158 --> 01:50:33,982
Come, if you want to.
or, forget.

2193
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:49,257
What happened?

2194
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:52,885
It is some pubs number, called while house.

2195
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:54,803
A person working there said that...

2196
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:57,189
...there is a girl that works here.

2197
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,020
But she is going to come at 5 o'clock in the evening.

2198
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:00,149
Her name is sheetal.

2199
01:51:00,195 --> 01:51:01,810
Whether Sheetal comes at <i>5</i> o'clock...

2200
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:02,979
...in the evening or 12 o'clock in the night.

2201
01:51:03,031 --> 01:51:04,111
Sheetal is after all Sheetal!

2202
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:05,523
Sheetal is not Aditi.

2203
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,157
No, Aditi is Sheetal.

2204
01:51:07,202 --> 01:51:09,238
But you were saying that Aditi is Nisha.

2205
01:51:09,288 --> 01:51:11,870
Nisha is Munni.
- Then who is Aditi?

2206
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:12,995
Nisha.

2207
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,121
Keep quiet! Keep quiet you all.

2208
01:51:14,168 --> 01:51:16,875
Sheetal, Nisha, Aditi whatever...

2209
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,876
...this is the name of the same girl.

2210
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,332
She is a very dangerous girl.

2211
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,464
She changes her name just like she changes her clothes.

2212
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:24,545
I am telling you, I will not spare her.

2213
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:25,880
Tell this great person, that how...

2214
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:27,885
...will he prove it lo the police!

2215
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:30,968
You stop thinking and stop yelling.

2216
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:33,009
I will go and tell the commissioner.

2217
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:36,849
That we have found the girl and she is the murderer.

2218
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:38,810
And we will hand her over in the evening, okay.

2219
01:51:40,903 --> 01:51:42,859
Tell me one thing, who is Munni'?
- Nisha

2220
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:45,862
then who is Aditi?
- She is Sheetal.

2221
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,489
Then who is Sheetal?

2222
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:49,274
Ask him, why are you asking me.

2223
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,489
You are speaking lies, you are talking rubbish.

2224
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:52,955
If you were innocent then why did you run...

2225
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:55,322
...then you would have come to me.

2226
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:57,911
Sir, the girl that has died, we are going...

2227
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,498
...to meet him in the evening.

2228
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:01,912
You come and then we will hand over...

2229
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,921
...the girl to you. You come, sir.

2230
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:07,175
Hello. Hello, what are you guys saying?

2231
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:10,258
Tap my phone, and find where they are calling from?

2232
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:11,296
And tell me.
- Yes, sir.

2233
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,931
Hello. Sir please listen to me.

2234
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:14,868
Come on, come on.

2235
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:15,993
Everybody, move in.

2236
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:19,980
Listen to me, don't try to hide your crimes

2237
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,900
if you are innocent and you trust me...

2238
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:25,902
...then come to the police station.

2239
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:27,313
We will see what we can do later.

2240
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:28,446
We will not come to the police station.

2241
01:52:28,492 --> 01:52:29,982
I know, when we will come to police station you will shoot us.

2242
01:52:40,337 --> 01:52:43,329
Sir, sir hello, hello.

2243
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:45,417
Sir can you hear me?

2244
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,345
Come on, come on.

2245
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,640
They should be somewhere here.

2246
01:53:02,666 --> 01:53:04,383
Cover the whole area.

2247
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:09,146
Come on, there.

2248
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:21,515
Gel some more officers.

2249
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:22,021
Come on, hurry up.

2250
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,697
What happened?

2251
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,077
Did you see this pole?

2252
01:53:58,123 --> 01:53:59,203
Yes I did?

2253
01:53:59,249 --> 01:54:00,364
I did not.

2254
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:01,702
Did you see that?
- What?

2255
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:25,018
Did you see in that corner.

2256
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,355
I cannot see anything.

2257
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,019
Forget it, they will recognise us.

2258
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:40,070
I cannot see anything, are these glasses or some trouble?

2259
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:44,016
I cannot see anything.

2260
01:54:44,042 --> 01:54:46,018
- Sir, walk straight.

2261
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:49,746
You keep walking straight.

2262
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:53,000
I am standing at queens gale terrace.

2263
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:55,304
Yes, I have the goods.

2264
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:57,579
You just bring the money.

2265
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:02,343
Sorry sir.

2266
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:39,133
Excuse me.

2267
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:09,872
Where is he?

2268
01:56:09,898 --> 01:56:11,228
- I am here, didn't you recognise me?

2269
01:56:11,256 --> 01:56:12,371
Not you, that old man.

2270
01:56:12,424 --> 01:56:13,413
Champak sir.

2271
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:14,683
Champak sir.

2272
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:16,184
Catch them.

2273
01:57:55,235 --> 01:57:56,224
Bawla.

2274
01:58:04,661 --> 01:58:05,807
Why are you running crooked?

2275
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:06,993
- The police are behind me.

2276
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:08,949
Get in.
- Are you mad? - come on.

2277
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:34,521
Fool! Stupid! Everyday you narrate me new stories!

2278
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:36,352
Give my cab! 
Where is my cab?

2279
01:58:36,401 --> 01:58:38,038
How do I explain to you'?

2280
01:58:38,064 --> 01:58:39,609
Somebody else took it!

2281
01:58:39,654 --> 01:58:41,189
Give me one chance.

2282
01:58:41,215 --> 01:58:43,638
I will find your cab anyhow.

2283
01:58:44,326 --> 01:58:46,317
If I don't get my cab within 24 hours...

2284
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:47,358
...then I will murder myself.

2285
01:58:47,579 --> 01:58:50,571
And I will gel you arrested for my murder case.

2286
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,990
That too for at least 20 years.
Come!

2287
01:59:08,933 --> 01:59:10,469
Excuse me. Sorry.

2288
01:59:10,518 --> 01:59:13,385
Do you know anybody named Sheetal?
Sheetal.

2289
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:15,394
What's the name?
- Sheetal.

2290
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,680
Sheetal?
- Yeah.

2291
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:17,722
She is sitting there.

2292
01:59:18,693 --> 01:59:20,308
She is some other girl.

2293
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:25,652
It is possible that she knows Nisha and she took Nisha's ticket.

2294
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,986
It is possible that she knows you loo.

2295
01:59:28,036 --> 01:59:29,492
It is possible.

2296
01:59:29,537 --> 01:59:30,745
But what is the harm in asking?

2297
01:59:30,771 --> 01:59:31,368
Let's ask her.

2298
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:33,496
Ask her. Ask her.

2299
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:34,656
Please go and ask.

2300
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:37,329
Go! Go!
- I am going.

2301
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:41,712
Greetings.
- Yes. What do you want?

2302
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:45,755
Aditi.
- Sorry.

2303
01:59:45,804 --> 01:59:47,965
Isn't your name Aditi?

2304
01:59:48,014 --> 01:59:49,879
Why do you want to know my name?

2305
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:52,299
No, no. 
I have come from fast travel agency.

2306
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,352
You had booked a ticket for Mumbai, hadn't you?

2307
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:57,683
Yes. So?

2308
01:59:58,733 --> 02:00:01,019
Your ticket is ready.

2309
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,354
Okay. Give it to me.

2310
02:00:02,404 --> 02:00:03,519
I had just come to inform you.

2311
02:00:03,571 --> 02:00:04,651
You will have to go to collect it.

2312
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:05,687
Okay.

2333
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:12,903
What happened?

2334
02:00:12,956 --> 02:00:15,914
You are so smart. What
intelligence you have!

2335
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,074
What happened?

2336
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:18,858
This girl's name is Aditi.

2337
02:00:18,884 --> 02:00:20,418
And she is going to Mumbai.

2338
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:21,623
What do we do now?

2339
02:00:22,507 --> 02:00:23,917
Are you happy now?

2340
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:25,457
You are satisfied now?

2341
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:29,840
I am saying, the girl who is dead, this guy is pulling her down.

2342
02:00:32,475 --> 02:00:34,090
Don't look, sister is coming here.

2343
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:38,102
What did she say?

2344
02:00:38,128 --> 02:00:38,829
What's her name?

2345
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:40,142
Is he deaf?

2346
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:41,359
I am not deaf. 
I know.

2347
02:00:41,385 --> 02:00:42,898
She said her name is Aditi.

2348
02:00:42,944 --> 02:00:44,684
I say that her name is not Aditi.

2349
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:45,401
It's Sheetal.

2350
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:46,732
What is he saying?

2351
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:48,396
Sir, in the morning when we had called the pub...

2352
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:50,441
...they said there is only one Indian girl...

2353
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:53,155
...and her name is Sheetal.

2354
02:00:53,204 --> 02:00:54,444
And when we asked that foreigner...

2355
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:57,034
...he loo said that Sheetal is there.

2356
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:59,449
And I can prove this.
- How?

2357
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:03,119
<i>How'?</i>

2358
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:07,673
Sheetal!

2359
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:13,675
Idiots!

2360
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:33,779
Look over there! Look over there!

2361
02:01:41,085 --> 02:01:42,771
From where did you get this money?

2362
02:01:42,797 --> 02:01:43,542
- I don't know.

2363
02:01:43,588 --> 02:01:45,169
You don't know!
You don't know!

2364
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:46,500
But we do know!

2365
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:48,505
Even if we died, still this miser...

2366
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,963
...won't give money for our shroud.

2367
02:01:51,012 --> 02:01:52,627
You don't know! Aren't you ashamed!

2368
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,511
For the past 2 days we have not eaten anything!

2369
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:55,637
Aren't you ashamed!

2370
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:57,062
I don't know anything about this money.

2371
02:01:57,088 --> 02:01:57,949
I am speaking the truth.

2372
02:01:57,977 --> 02:01:59,763
I don't know.
 I just saw the money.

2373
02:01:59,813 --> 02:02:01,553
Then from where did this money come?

2374
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:04,848
Your father put it in your pocket!

2375
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,016
Or it fell from the sky!

2376
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:10,187
Look! Look!
 Now he is silent!

2377
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,696
He can't speak anything now!

2378
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:13,825
Tell him to talk properly.

2379
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:15,133
I am his boss!

2380
02:02:15,161 --> 02:02:16,867
MY foot!

2381
02:02:16,913 --> 02:02:19,529
He has either committed robbery or he has stolen it.

2382
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:22,824
What are you fighting like cheap guys!

2383
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:24,242
I am hungry! 
We have got the money!

2384
02:02:24,268 --> 02:02:25,038
Let's eat something!

2385
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:26,248
I don't want stolen money!

2386
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:27,748
I won't eat food bought from this money!

2387
02:02:27,774 --> 02:02:28,233
- Thank you.

2388
02:02:28,817 --> 02:02:31,593
I gave work to everybody for so many years.

2389
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:32,511
I fed everybody.

2390
02:02:32,537 --> 02:02:34,631
I considered them as my own people.

2391
02:02:34,681 --> 02:02:36,637
And this is what I get in return!

2392
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:38,362
I am a thief, am I not'?

2393
02:02:38,388 --> 02:02:39,971
This is stolen money!

2394
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:41,008
Yes!

2395
02:02:44,566 --> 02:02:48,684
I won't give you a drop of water with this stolen money.

2396
02:02:48,736 --> 02:02:52,695
Remember this!
Now there is no relation between us!

2397
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:54,856
You have decided it now!

2398
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:57,154
I decided it since my childhood.

2399
02:03:00,104 --> 02:03:00,195
Even if I am dying, I won't drink your water.

2400
02:03:00,248 --> 02:03:01,579
Because the person who will drink your water...

2401
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:03,706
...he won't achieve salvation.

2402
02:03:03,751 --> 02:03:05,207
You are such a filthy man!

2403
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:08,030
You snatch children's meal!

2404
02:03:08,056 --> 02:03:09,145
Aren't you ashamed!

2405
02:03:09,883 --> 02:03:10,963
Bawla, let's gel

2406
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:29,728
Sir, look there!

2407
02:03:40,997 --> 02:03:45,912
Chaat Masala will add flavour to the food.

2408
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,075
I have got it from Surat.

2409
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:48,618
I ate the 'kahamanfi but the chaat remained.

2410
02:03:48,671 --> 02:03:52,289
I have 'mukhwaas'. Come on.

2411
02:03:52,926 --> 02:03:55,710
Listen! Do you have a knife?

2412
02:03:55,736 --> 02:03:58,321
Give that paper. - Here.

2413
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:01,672
Some more cucumber.

2414
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:11,141
Do you know how to eat this?
- No.

2415
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:14,769
You should chop it into small pieces.

2416
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:16,733
You should take the Masala.

2417
02:04:16,759 --> 02:04:18,360
And sprinkle over it.

2418
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:23,028
After sprinkling it, mix it like this, and eat 1 piece.

2419
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:25,117
Of cucumber... and keep it here.

2420
02:04:29,128 --> 02:04:32,666
Sir, give this poor guy something.
- No.

2421
02:04:32,715 --> 02:04:34,671
It is stolen money.
- So'!

2422
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:36,799
If we bought anything from it, then it is not honest.

2423
02:04:36,844 --> 02:04:38,004
This decent guy won't like it.

2424
02:04:38,721 --> 02:04:40,020
You go in and pay.

2425
02:04:40,046 --> 02:04:43,365
Till then I will prepare the 'chaat masala'.

2426
02:04:43,393 --> 02:04:45,099
If we had black pepper, it would have been great!

2427
02:04:45,144 --> 02:04:46,224
I have got it!

2428
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:47,726
You have black pepper?
- Yes.

2429
02:04:47,772 --> 02:04:50,104
Wow! Are you a man or cupboard?

2430
02:04:50,692 --> 02:04:52,353
The cupboard is full, but the brain is empty.

2431
02:04:52,402 --> 02:04:54,063
The one who is filled, he will eat.

2432
02:04:54,112 --> 02:04:56,148
Rich people don't lock horns with poor people.

2433
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:58,313
You go.
- I won't argue.

2434
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:04,618
Come my cucumber, see how I caught you...

2435
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:11,622
who will eat the cucumber's spice...

2436
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:20,050
that side, Indian!

2437
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:40,711
What happened?

2438
02:05:40,737 --> 02:05:42,030
Why are the people running?

2439
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:43,407
Nothing. A dog had gone mad.

2440
02:05:43,453 --> 02:05:45,034
That's why everybody is running after him.

2441
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:48,074
Where is the boss'?
- Don't know.

2442
02:05:48,124 --> 02:05:49,660
He was preparing the 'chaat' here.

2443
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:52,658
Boss... boss...

2444
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,756
so you don't know me?
- No.

2445
02:05:59,343 --> 02:06:01,840
You have never seen me before?

2446
02:06:01,866 --> 02:06:03,862
- I told never before!

2447
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:06,677
Then how did you take money from me?

2448
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,175
What money!

2449
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:12,186
He is very dangerous!

2450
02:06:12,231 --> 02:06:16,065
I have never seen such a liar and a deceiver like him!

2451
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:19,978
He took money from me and he says he has never seen me!

2452
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:21,317
He is not a police!

2453
02:06:21,343 --> 02:06:22,738
He is thief-police!

2454
02:06:22,784 --> 02:06:25,776
Thrash him and make him spill out that...

2455
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,819
...what do secret police know about me!
- Yes, boss.

2456
02:06:29,832 --> 02:06:31,788
What do you know about our business?

2457
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:34,120
You don't know what happens in your business?

2458
02:06:34,837 --> 02:06:36,122
Stop this rubbish!

2459
02:06:36,172 --> 02:06:37,391
And tell me the truth!

2460
02:06:37,417 --> 02:06:39,189
What do you know about Gandhi!

2461
02:06:39,217 --> 02:06:40,957
He is the father of our nation.

2462
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:43,296
Stop kidding! And tell us the truth!

2463
02:06:43,346 --> 02:06:45,211
What do you know about Gandhi!

2464
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:47,862
Forget me, the whole of India knows about him!

2465
02:06:47,888 --> 02:06:48,802
What will I say?

2466
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:49,931
What!

2467
02:06:49,977 --> 02:06:51,717
What else do you know about him?

2468
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:53,894
When he used to walk, the entire...

2469
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:55,100
...country of India would walk with him.

2470
02:06:55,149 --> 02:06:57,936
And the ones who were with him, they had to run.

2471
02:06:57,985 --> 02:07:00,442
You are right. 
We have to run.

2472
02:07:00,822 --> 02:07:03,063
What do you know about his business?

2473
02:07:03,116 --> 02:07:05,277
Business?
 He used to spin the wheel.

2474
02:07:05,326 --> 02:07:07,817
Wheel? 
What wheel?

2475
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:10,156
To make hand-looms, to fight for independence.

2476
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:12,948
All these are Gandhi’s business.

2477
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,036
Whom are you talking about?

2478
02:07:15,086 --> 02:07:17,327
What kind of an Indian are you?

2479
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,371
You forgot mahatma Gandhi after staying in London?

2480
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:24,838
Not mahatma Gandhi!
M.G. Gandhi!

2481
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:27,253
What do you know about Mannu-bhai Gandhi?

2482
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:28,386
Who are you?

2483
02:07:31,435 --> 02:07:33,221
Where did he go?

2484
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:34,762
He has loads of money.

2485
02:07:34,788 --> 02:07:36,413
He must be having fun.

2486
02:07:36,858 --> 02:07:39,565
We are sitting here waiting for him, hungry and thirsty.

2487
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,773
He must be having a 7-course meal in some <i>7</i> star hotel.

2488
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:49,863
Boss, with a pillar.
I ripped out 2 of his teeth...

2489
02:07:49,912 --> 02:07:52,870
...2 of his nails and I damaged that loo.

2490
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:55,031
Still he is not saying anything.

2491
02:07:55,918 --> 02:07:57,328
Very tough guy-

2492
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,870
Now you will speak up.

2493
02:08:02,466 --> 02:08:03,581
I am losing my 'saans' breath, (mother-in-law).

2494
02:08:03,676 --> 02:08:05,343
Now you will lose your daughter-in-law loo.

2495
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:06,880
Sir, there is a call for you.

2496
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:08,920
Mannu-bhai Gandhi here.

2497
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,925
<i>“O, no, m, she: khan.</i>

2498
02:08:14,312 --> 02:08:15,012
Listen to me.

2499
02:08:15,038 --> 02:08:16,168
Give me one chance.

2500
02:08:17,481 --> 02:08:20,097
Because this time some police officer...

2501
02:08:20,276 --> 02:08:22,733
...will send the courier to you.

2502
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,027
Unnecessarily we are wasting our time.

2503
02:08:26,324 --> 02:08:27,905
From the 4 girls, not even one will come.

2504
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:33,570
Bawla! 
Come here! Quickly!

2505
02:08:36,042 --> 02:08:36,952
What happened?

2506
02:08:37,168 --> 02:08:39,159
Come quickly! 
Look, she is going! Look!

2507
02:08:42,465 --> 02:08:45,502
She went inside.
Now she will come.

2508
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,588
As soon as she comes, we have to follow her.

2509
02:08:49,222 --> 02:08:50,132
This is your ticket ma'am.

2510
02:08:51,224 --> 02:08:52,087
And here's your passport.

2511
02:08:52,113 --> 02:08:53,285
- Thank you. 
- Have a nice trip.

2512
02:08:55,144 --> 02:08:56,099
She has come!
-She has come!

2513
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,180
Look! Hurry up!

2514
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:07,269
Hurry up!
 Idiot.

2515
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:22,035
And if now she doesn't give...

2516
02:09:22,213 --> 02:09:23,168
...the ticket to Nisha, then understand...

2517
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:24,291
Your face is not nice, but at least talk nicely.

2518
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:25,417
Come.

2519
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:05,207
Go and catch her. Go, or she may run away.

2520
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:06,733
Shall I tell you one thing?

2521
02:10:06,759 --> 02:10:08,360
Will you listen to me, brother?

2522
02:10:08,551 --> 02:10:12,294
Remove your brain, put it in pouch, and throw it away.

2523
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:15,213
Bahia, this is not Aditi.

2524
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:20,096
Have you ever known an English by the name of Aditi?

2525
02:10:21,272 --> 02:10:22,557
I will tell you.

2526
02:10:23,274 --> 02:10:25,060
We will follow this English woman.

2527
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:26,186
Let us find whom she gives the ticket.

2528
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:27,437
Amazing ideal

2529
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:30,068
Sheetal gave her ticket to the English woman...

2530
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,397
...the English woman gave to her Aunt.

2531
02:10:32,616 --> 02:10:35,073
Aunt gave it to her child, the child gave lo his uncle.

2532
02:10:35,286 --> 02:10:37,743
How many people will you follow?

2533
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:39,244
Do you have a pouch?

2534
02:10:39,415 --> 02:10:41,246
Now what do you want? 
Tell me.

2535
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:43,829
You beg alms on the train. 
Okay.

2536
02:10:44,295 --> 02:10:45,250
And don't eat my brains.

2537
02:10:45,463 --> 02:10:46,373
You go away from here, go.

2538
02:10:46,589 --> 02:10:50,457
Instead of begging, I will escape from this country in 3 days!

2539
02:10:50,634 --> 02:10:51,840
You think I don't have brains?

2540
02:10:52,345 --> 02:10:53,960
Nor they will hang me, nor put me in prison...

2541
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,169
...nor I will fall in anyone's hand.

2542
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:57,596
Neither will Bawla die like a homeless man.
Understand?

2543
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:25,203
What happened?
- In the toilet!

2544
02:11:25,419 --> 02:11:26,699
I saw the corpse!

2545
02:11:26,725 --> 02:11:28,607
I saw the corpse alive!

2546
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:29,307
I saw Nisha!

2547
02:11:29,333 --> 02:11:30,563
- Where? 
- In the bathroom.

2548
02:11:30,758 --> 02:11:32,874
Nisha! Come! 
Come! Come!

2549
02:11:48,776 --> 02:11:49,891
Look!

2550
02:11:54,782 --> 02:11:55,845
I saw her!

2551
02:11:55,871 --> 02:11:58,846
- She was here, isn't it'?

2552
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:55,725
What are you doing? Run!

2553
02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:25,465
Hello! Guru, this is Gullu speaking!

2554
02:14:25,491 --> 02:14:26,496
The cab driver.

2555
02:14:26,684 --> 02:14:28,424
Yes, I know where is that scoundrel Bunty.

2556
02:14:28,602 --> 02:14:30,934
You quickly come to Brighton railway station.

2557
02:14:31,105 --> 02:14:32,970
And listen! Please bring my cab!

2558
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:44,485
Is this boss speaking?

2559
02:14:44,702 --> 02:14:46,317
Scoundrel, your cab has been found...

2560
02:14:46,379 --> 02:14:47,662
...Quickly come to Brighton railway station.

2561
02:14:47,663 --> 02:14:49,494
Take your cab and get lost from here!

2562
02:14:49,665 --> 02:14:53,704
Once I return your cab, I will no longer be your slave.

2563
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:07,329
Stop! Where are you running?

2564
02:15:07,355 --> 02:15:09,540
You act as dead?

2565
02:15:09,727 --> 02:15:10,637
And you make fools of us? Huh?

2566
02:15:12,563 --> 02:15:13,873
You killed your husband!

2567
02:15:13,899 --> 02:15:15,045
And you accused us!

2568
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:16,472
I didn't murder anyone!

2569
02:15:16,692 --> 02:15:18,654
Is it'! 
Then did I kill him?

2570
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,800
You are lying?

2571
02:15:19,987 --> 02:15:20,897
If you didn't, then why did you run away...

2572
02:15:21,113 --> 02:15:22,023
...from the theatre that day?

2573
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,025
I had come to tell you the truth about myself.

2574
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:25,466
Which truth did you come to tell?

2575
02:15:25,492 --> 02:15:26,385
- My name is not Munni.

2576
02:15:26,577 --> 02:15:27,987
That even I know, your name is...

2577
02:15:28,203 --> 02:15:31,570
Nor my name is Nisha, and nor is Vikram Chauhan my husband!

2578
02:15:34,691 --> 02:15:35,532
Nisha Chauhan!
Vikram Chauhan's real wife!

2579
02:15:35,753 --> 02:15:37,348
You are lying so much!

2580
02:15:37,374 --> 02:15:38,895
Aren't you ashamed!

2581
02:15:39,089 --> 02:15:40,750
You have been lying to me since the day I met you!

2582
02:15:40,924 --> 02:15:41,893
Look at your face!

2583
02:15:41,919 --> 02:15:43,156
You look so innocent!

2584
02:15:43,344 --> 02:15:45,284
But you are so cunning!

2585
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:46,827
It's my mistake]

2586
02:15:47,014 --> 02:15:48,174
That I made you a part of my life and I fell in love with you!

2587
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:49,880
I blame myself!

2588
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,512
Why did I meet you'!
 Why did I fell in love with you'?

2589
02:15:52,686 --> 02:15:53,846
Bunty, please believe me.

2590
02:15:53,872 --> 02:15:55,077
I am speaking the truth.

2591
02:15:55,272 --> 02:15:56,583
How many truths will you speak?

2592
02:15:56,609 --> 02:15:57,834
Which one should I believe?

2593
02:15:57,983 --> 02:15:59,018
You will have to hear me out!

2594
02:15:59,193 --> 02:16:01,400
And you can do whatever you want after that.

2595
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:09,737
My name is Aditi.
 Aditi Desai.

2596
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:15,447
The man who had brought me here for work...

2597
02:16:15,626 --> 02:16:17,457
...his intention was bad.

2598
02:16:18,962 --> 02:16:21,137
The day he cast lustful eyes on me...

2599
02:16:21,163 --> 02:16:22,479
I ran away from there.

2600
02:16:22,633 --> 02:16:24,715
But I left my passport there.

2601
02:16:25,278 --> 02:16:30,014
I am lucky that I found <i>my</i> friend Sheetal.

2602
02:16:30,015 --> 02:16:31,676
She was working in a dance club.

2603
02:16:33,185 --> 02:16:35,096
She got me work in that dance club.

2604
02:16:35,688 --> 02:16:38,725
I worked thereto make both the ends meet.

2605
02:16:40,651 --> 02:16:42,141
Then one day the police arrived there.

2606
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:45,190
Before they could ask for my passport...

2607
02:16:45,406 --> 02:16:49,069
...and ask questions, I ran away from there out of fear.

2608
02:16:49,993 --> 02:16:51,779
But the police followed me.

2609
02:16:51,954 --> 02:16:54,161
Just then a car's door opened.

2610
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:56,496
The man who saved me from the police...

2611
02:16:56,667 --> 02:16:59,033
...he was Vikram Chauhan.

2612
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:00,625
'Get in.'

2613
02:17:02,005 --> 02:17:04,872
'I wanted you to play the charade of my wife for a few days.'

2614
02:17:06,218 --> 02:17:08,579
'And you will do whatever I want.

2615
02:17:08,605 --> 02:17:09,576
Don't worry.'

2616
02:17:09,763 --> 02:17:11,094
'I won't touch you.'

2617
02:17:11,724 --> 02:17:13,510
'But after my work is done, I will give you a new passport...

2618
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:15,933
...and 25 lakhs.'

2619
02:17:16,103 --> 02:17:18,094
'With that you can happily return lo India.'

2620
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:21,563
'What if I refused?'

2621
02:17:23,694 --> 02:17:25,480
'Then nobody can save you from the police.'

2622
02:17:25,696 --> 02:17:26,811
'ls there anybody?'

2623
02:17:27,698 --> 02:17:28,904
I did not have any option.

2624
02:17:30,033 --> 02:17:32,490
I thought I will get a passport and loads of money...

2625
02:17:32,703 --> 02:17:36,662
...to return lo India back to my parents.

2626
02:17:38,709 --> 02:17:39,994
And I said yes to him.

2627
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:45,087
Actually Vikram and I were together.

2628
02:17:46,049 --> 02:17:47,789
We were waiting for the doctor.

2629
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:50,547
So that in front of him I would play the charade of suicide...

2630
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:52,549
...and prove that I, meaning Vikram's wife...

2631
02:17:52,765 --> 02:17:55,131
...was mentally unstable.

2632
02:17:56,769 --> 02:17:58,805
But before that your car arrived there.

2633
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:02,516
When the doctor came, I played the charade...

2634
02:18:02,733 --> 02:18:04,711
...of committing suicide in front of him...

2635
02:18:04,737 --> 02:18:05,545
but you saved me.

2636
02:18:06,153 --> 02:18:10,066
Then you asked me to work for your play.

2637
02:18:10,949 --> 02:18:13,523
I didn't tell you my name Munni.

2638
02:18:13,549 --> 02:18:15,559
And I told you a fable.

2639
02:18:17,372 --> 02:18:19,579
The night when Babla Heard me talking...

2640
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:22,162
...to some one, that was Vikram.

2641
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:26,583
He told me to behave in such a way with you all...

2642
02:18:26,757 --> 02:18:29,294
...that it would look as if I have suicidal tendencies.

2643
02:18:31,136 --> 02:18:32,592
So that your testimony will Prove to the doctor...

2644
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:35,592
...thal I am mad.

2645
02:18:36,809 --> 02:18:39,596
After that everything happened as per the plan.

2646
02:18:39,812 --> 02:18:41,222
'I promise you that I will die!'

2647
02:18:49,029 --> 02:18:50,314
'The work is done.'

2648
02:18:50,781 --> 02:18:53,739
'As I had promised you, here is the remaining money.'

2649
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:56,909
'After today, neither I know you, nor you know me.'

2650
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:00,870
'Good luck.
- Thank you.'

2651
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:06,623
When I left from there, I found that...

2652
02:19:06,797 --> 02:19:09,334
...I had left my passport inside.

2653
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:11,336
I went back to collect it.

2654
02:19:13,178 --> 02:19:16,636
Vikram was taking a young girl inside...

2655
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:18,680
...who was not in her senses.

2656
02:19:18,892 --> 02:19:22,726
And it was none else, but his real wife Nisha Chauhan.

2657
02:19:45,168 --> 02:19:47,329
'Stop! I won't let you do this! '

2658
02:19:50,132 --> 02:19:51,338
'What are you doing here?'

2659
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:55,751
'I will kill you! 
But I won't let you do this! <i>'</i>

2660
02:19:58,932 --> 02:20:02,174
'You will ruin my hard work of so many years! '

2661
02:20:02,477 --> 02:20:04,842
You will spoil my plan?

2662
02:20:04,868 --> 02:20:07,747
- Nisha, he will kill you.

2663
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:12,647
'Nisha run away, he will kill you.'

2664
02:20:12,863 --> 02:20:14,148
'Nisha, close the door!'

2665
02:20:14,865 --> 02:20:15,775
'Leave me, Vikram! '

2666
02:20:15,991 --> 02:20:19,074
'Nisha! 
Nisha, close the door! Leave me! '

2667
02:20:19,286 --> 02:20:20,401
'Nisha you run away.'

2668
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:22,740
'Vikram! '

2669
02:20:31,006 --> 02:20:32,586
'First I will set her ablaze.

2670
02:20:32,612 --> 02:20:33,864
Then it's your turn.'

2671
02:20:37,262 --> 02:20:39,719
'Nisha, open the door! Nisha! '

2672
02:20:42,434 --> 02:20:44,302
'Nisha! Open the door!

2673
02:20:44,328 --> 02:20:47,044
Please, Nisha! 
Open the door!'

2674
02:21:03,246 --> 02:21:06,204
And then... he burnt his wife alive.

2675
02:21:06,917 --> 02:21:09,408
But I somehow ran Away from there.

2676
02:21:12,255 --> 02:21:15,747
I tried many times to tell you the truth,

2677
02:21:15,926 --> 02:21:19,009
...but for some or the other reason, I couldn't reach you.

2678
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:24,761
Even if I believe you that you are speaking the truth...

2679
02:21:24,977 --> 02:21:27,514
...why did you kill Vikram'?

2680
02:21:27,938 --> 02:21:29,724
Bunty, I didn't kill Vikram.

2681
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:31,180
Bunty, don't leave her.

2682
02:21:31,942 --> 02:21:34,228
I have called the commissioner, he is coming to catch her!

2683
02:21:34,403 --> 02:21:35,358
What have you done!

2684
02:21:35,529 --> 02:21:37,235
Bunty, he will kill me.

2685
02:21:37,447 --> 02:21:38,602
He will not beat you.

2686
02:21:38,628 --> 02:21:39,838
He will worship you.

2687
02:21:40,033 --> 02:21:40,943
Your papa is coming, you sinner!

2688
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:42,444
Stop this rubbish!

2689
02:21:42,661 --> 02:21:44,993
You guys have done a grave mistake by calling him here.

2690
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:46,911
Because...
- Why?

2691
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:48,492
Because he has murdered Vikram!

2692
02:21:55,298 --> 02:21:57,835
Come out! Out!

2693
02:21:58,051 --> 02:21:59,382
Why did you bring Taneja sir along?

2694
02:21:59,594 --> 02:22:00,504
Keep quiet!

2695
02:22:00,721 --> 02:22:03,804
He has hired goons from India to break my legs!

2696
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:04,926
No!
- What no!

2697
02:22:05,142 --> 02:22:06,803
Either pay my hospital bill or else present...

2698
02:22:07,019 --> 02:22:08,805
...those goons in front of me!

2699
02:22:16,528 --> 02:22:19,110
Who?
- Why are you asking?

2700
02:22:19,322 --> 02:22:20,937
I am at the 6th floor, come up.

2701
02:22:21,116 --> 02:22:24,825
Where? 
Upstairs? Upstairs.

2702
02:22:35,971 --> 02:22:37,809
Where are you taking me?

2703
02:22:37,835 --> 02:22:39,341
- Your legs, come!

2704
02:22:39,342 --> 02:22:40,832
That day when I came to the theatre to meet you both...

2705
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:42,876
...at that time Vikram too was there.

2706
02:23:12,334 --> 02:23:14,416
'You are he sole witness of Nisha's death.'

2707
02:23:14,628 --> 02:23:15,913
'I can't keep you alive.'

2708
02:23:16,129 --> 02:23:17,164
Vikram!

2709
02:23:27,766 --> 02:23:29,006
He shot at Vikram.

2710
02:23:29,226 --> 02:23:33,139
And running in a wounded condition, he ran into you.

2711
02:23:48,411 --> 02:23:50,527
I was the sole witness of that murder.

2712
02:23:50,705 --> 02:23:52,912
He tried to kill me loo.

2713
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:55,495
But somehow I saved my life and I ran away from there.

2714
02:23:56,378 --> 02:23:58,915
He even found out where I lived.

2715
02:23:59,089 --> 02:24:01,501
I couldn't come lo
you guys for help.

2716
02:24:02,092 --> 02:24:04,174
He had instigated you guys in the murder case.

2717
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:06,297
I took my friend Sheetal's help.

2718
02:24:06,471 --> 02:24:07,677
For buying the ticket.

2719
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:11,257
Before he kills ma, I want to return to India.

2720
02:24:11,476 --> 02:24:12,511
That is fine.

2721
02:24:12,727 --> 02:24:14,263
But I can't understand one thing.

2722
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:17,141
Why will the police commissioner kill Vikram Chauhan?

2723
02:24:17,315 --> 02:24:19,055
Bunty, even I don't know that.

2724
02:24:19,276 --> 02:24:20,436
I will tell you.

2725
02:24:28,368 --> 02:24:29,904
Because Nisha was my only sister.

2726
02:24:31,121 --> 02:24:36,582
After our parent's death...
I raised her like my child.

2727
02:24:44,134 --> 02:24:46,671
One day she told me that she loves a guy.

2728
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:49,176
And she wants to marry him.

2729
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:51,463
That guy's name was Vikram Chauhan.

2730
02:24:53,351 --> 02:24:54,916
I never refused her.

2731
02:24:54,942 --> 02:24:56,584
I got them married.

2732
02:24:57,147 --> 02:24:58,933
A few months after marriage, my sister...

2733
02:24:59,149 --> 02:25:00,059
started losing her mental balance.

2734
02:25:00,275 --> 02:25:03,938
And one day I found out that she has burned herself to death.

2735
02:25:04,154 --> 02:25:05,940
When the post mortem report arrived...

2736
02:25:06,156 --> 02:25:07,066
...I found out that she was given drugs.

2737
02:25:08,158 --> 02:25:10,991
When I started investigating, I found out...

2738
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:12,992
...thal to gel her wealth.

2739
02:25:13,163 --> 02:25:15,119
Vikram was giving her injections full of drugs.

2740
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:17,576
And because of this my sister had grown weak.

2741
02:25:17,792 --> 02:25:19,453
Vikram was already married.

2742
02:25:19,628 --> 02:25:22,995
He married my sister to lay his hands on her wealth.

2743
02:25:23,173 --> 02:25:24,709
When I spoke to Vikram...

2744
02:25:24,925 --> 02:25:26,131
'It is possible that what you are saying that is true.'

2745
02:25:26,343 --> 02:25:28,709
'Now the wealth is mine.'

2746
02:25:28,929 --> 02:25:32,012
'By killing me, do you want lo get hanged...

2747
02:25:32,224 --> 02:25:34,385
...and leave your children orphaned?'

2748
02:25:37,896 --> 02:25:39,602
Since then I was searching for him.

2749
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:43,182
And that day when I came to the theatre, I saw him.

2750
02:26:02,212 --> 02:26:03,497
I was lucky.

2751
02:26:03,713 --> 02:26:07,046
Unknowingly you all kept the corpse in the AC duct.

2752
02:26:07,217 --> 02:26:10,050
It slipped and fell on the stage.

2753
02:26:13,265 --> 02:26:14,300
I won't spare the girl.

2754
02:26:14,933 --> 02:26:17,515
She aided Vikram in killing my sister.

2755
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:21,137
And not even you, who will be the witness to her murder.

2756
02:26:21,356 --> 02:26:23,017
Hang on! 
Listen to me! Hang on!

2757
02:26:23,233 --> 02:26:24,598
I understand your feelings.

2758
02:26:24,818 --> 02:26:27,025
This girl wants to say something in her justification.

2759
02:26:27,237 --> 02:26:28,352
Speak up!
 Are you dumb! Speak up!

2760
02:26:28,571 --> 02:26:32,689
The gun is in his hands! Speak up!

2761
02:26:34,244 --> 02:26:36,989
I am tired. 
Where are these Bunty and Bawla?

2762
02:26:37,015 --> 02:26:37,807
Where is he?

2763
02:26:38,248 --> 02:26:39,658
I saw him going upstairs.

2764
02:26:39,874 --> 02:26:41,205
Has he vanished in the thin air?

2765
02:26:41,376 --> 02:26:42,331
Do one thing.

2766
02:26:42,544 --> 02:26:44,580
You wait here, I will break his legs and come.

2767
02:26:44,754 --> 02:26:46,335
Nab him when he leaves from here.

2768
02:26:46,548 --> 02:26:47,458
What will happen to me'?

2769
02:26:47,674 --> 02:26:49,084
I am there.

2770
02:26:49,259 --> 02:26:50,546
So what! Move!

2771
02:26:50,572 --> 02:26:52,776
Move! Move!
l am there.

2772
02:26:55,724 --> 02:26:56,679
Babla! Bunty!

2773
02:27:05,317 --> 02:27:06,477
Guru!

2774
02:27:09,279 --> 02:27:10,394
Come

2775
02:27:16,286 --> 02:27:17,901
How old this must be'?

2776
02:27:20,623 --> 02:27:22,329
He is Sher Khan.

2777
02:27:23,251 --> 02:27:24,161
Yes, boss.

2778
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:29,663
But he is neither carrying Bag nor money.

2779
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:33,667
Maybe he has brought cheque or demand draft.

2780
02:27:33,887 --> 02:27:36,219
Go and ask him.
- Yes, boss.

2781
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:45,766
Do you have demand draft?
- What?

2782
02:27:46,316 --> 02:27:47,852
Money! Money!

2783
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:51,185
Is this your father's building that you are asking for money?

2784
02:27:52,655 --> 02:27:53,770
The money for the goods.

2785
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:55,605
Pouch! Pouch!

2786
02:27:55,825 --> 02:27:57,656
Have you gone mad, asking for a “pouch”?

2787
02:27:59,954 --> 02:28:00,864
He has gone mad.

2788
02:28:01,081 --> 02:28:02,196
Are you Sher Khan?

2789
02:28:02,415 --> 02:28:04,956
Yes? 
- No, you need not worry.

2790
02:28:04,982 --> 02:28:07,776
Tell, are you really Sher Khan?

2791
02:28:07,962 --> 02:28:09,543
No, I am his father-in-law!

2792
02:28:10,423 --> 02:28:11,067
Oh my God!

2793
02:28:11,093 --> 02:28:13,281
We want to meet your son-in-law.

2794
02:28:13,426 --> 02:28:14,415
Where is your son-in-law'?

2795
02:28:14,636 --> 02:28:16,297
He died.
- When?

2796
02:28:16,513 --> 02:28:18,891
Just now.
He died a minute ago.

2797
02:28:18,917 --> 02:28:19,530
- How?

2798
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:20,658
By eating a chocolate.

2799
02:28:20,684 --> 02:28:21,956
Why are you eating my brain!

2800
02:28:22,102 --> 02:28:25,560
Bunty is not here, who are these strange people?

2801
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,891
Boss, these guys know where Bunty is!

2802
02:28:28,358 --> 02:28:29,438
He is my boss!

2803
02:28:30,902 --> 02:28:32,688
Gullu, save me from them!

2804
02:28:32,904 --> 02:28:34,895
Boss, they are addressing him as boss.

2805
02:28:35,365 --> 02:28:36,696
This means they all are secret police.

2806
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,148
And they have nabbed Sher Khan.

2807
02:28:38,785 --> 02:28:41,407
Champak bhai, how come you are here?

2808
02:28:41,433 --> 02:28:42,849
- Nab him! 
Nab him!

2809
02:28:43,915 --> 02:28:46,873
Boss, the police have surrounded us from all sides! 
Run!

2810
02:28:55,677 --> 02:28:56,757
Here he is!

2811
02:28:57,762 --> 02:28:58,877
Catch him!

2812
02:29:02,684 --> 02:29:04,470
. Sir!
sum"

2813
02:29:06,438 --> 02:29:08,349
Boss, everyone here is secret police!

2814
02:29:15,738 --> 02:29:17,945
He fired the bullet at the beehive.

2815
02:29:35,967 --> 02:29:38,925
Bees! Run!

2816
02:29:39,137 --> 02:29:40,252
Oh no!

2817
02:29:43,475 --> 02:29:45,557
Pick me up!

2818
02:30:07,916 --> 02:30:08,780
Look at those crazy people.

2819
02:30:08,806 --> 02:30:09,477
- Look a! that guy!

2820
02:30:15,465 --> 02:30:17,161
Hey let me keep my foot!

2821
02:30:17,187 --> 02:30:17,822
- Move!

2822
02:30:44,994 --> 02:30:46,325
Help!

2823
02:30:48,831 --> 02:30:52,323
Don't panic. Come one at a time.

2824
02:30:54,045 --> 02:30:54,243
Help!

2825
02:30:54,269 --> 02:30:55,059
- Don't panic. 
You idiot!

2826
02:31:08,101 --> 02:31:09,090
God I love you.

2827
02:31:09,561 --> 02:31:11,552
Okay, get down, it's out of control!

2828
02:32:17,211 --> 02:32:18,417
Bunty I just love you!

2829
02:32:39,942 --> 02:32:43,150
Save me!' I will die!

2830
02:33:39,210 --> 02:33:42,202
Hail Punjab!

2831
02:34:09,699 --> 02:34:13,157
Bunty, open your mouth.
Very good.

2832
02:34:39,103 --> 02:34:40,138
How are you, sir?

2833
02:34:42,732 --> 02:34:44,518
I am sorry for whatever happened.

2834
02:34:45,735 --> 02:34:49,148
These are your passports.
- Thank you.

2835
02:34:49,322 --> 02:34:51,734
Whenever you are cured, then you can leave.

2836
02:34:54,744 --> 02:34:57,110
We will meet in some corner of the world.

2837
02:34:57,330 --> 02:35:00,618
Some corner, but not in a col.
Thank you.
