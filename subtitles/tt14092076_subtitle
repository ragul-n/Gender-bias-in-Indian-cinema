1
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,766
Hi, my name is Anbirkiniyal.

2
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,568
I am 25 years old.

3
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,004
I live with my father.

4
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,472
I am nursing... oh, no.

5
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,276
I am BSc nursing... no.

6
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,881
I am a BSC nursing graduate.

7
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,184
Something is missing here--

8
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:06,226
Like a king with his elephantry

9
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,865
Like a king with his mighty elephantry

10
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,836
You represent present day history

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,307
Pearl so rare, a sparkling future

12
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,877
You can foresee for sure

13
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,381
Light of my home if by my side forever

14
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,784
Peace of mind I will cherish and savor

15
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,088
Even if I die for your sake duly

16
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:38,959
Please comply to forsake me

17
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:43,096
I saw you yesterday in the sky

18
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,366
As a cluster of nimbus clouds sailing by

19
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,304
You are the fresh flower of tomorrow

20
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,841
This earth will sprout to blossom also

21
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,811
My dream-come-true!

22
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:01,849
In my eyes I shall carry you

23
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,319
My heartbeat, my Godsend

24
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,489
I will protect you till the very end

25
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,559
Like a king with his mighty elephantry

26
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,363
You represent present day history

27
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,001
Pearl so rare, a sparkling future

28
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,971
You can witness for sure

29
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,878
Dad?

30
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,160
The warmth of your tender hand in mine

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,664
I want my palms to retain for a lifetime

32
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,169
The sky will oblige crystal clear

33
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,672
Rain showers for you to shower, Dear

34
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,543
The imprint of your feet I favor

35
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,546
The design they draw I savor

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,950
Path should be etched fully

37
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:13,320
With your footprint only

38
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:18,525
To ensure you don't hurt your finger

39
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,696
When you light a lamp, dear
Beside you I will linger

40
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:27,968
I will nurse you back to health so well

41
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:32,239
Much better than even your mother will

42
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:37,144
I came here, dear daughter
As your life, love and laughter

43
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,616
I sprinkled gold dust on you, my precious
Apple of my eye, close your eyes and rest

44
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,971
The work I am starting today
and others that will follow,

45
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,907
Lord Ganesha along with
your brother Lord Muruga,

46
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,376
please consider my work as Yours.

47
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,045
O' Lord with a golden belly,
may I succeed without any hitch?

48
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,948
Praise be to Thee, the God
who protects us against all hurdles.

49
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,519
I must somehow ace it
in my English exam today.

50
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,922
Tea is in the table.

51
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,559
"In" means inside.

52
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,828
How can tea be inside the table?

53
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:31,265
It isn't "in" the table, Dear.
Right usage is "on" the table.

54
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,799
Well, Aunty,

55
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,569
how do you know I'm attending
an English speaking course?

56
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,339
The whole world knows! That tea hasn't
crossed the table for the past 40 days!

57
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,675
Dad, stop cracking your poor jokes, okay?

58
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,877
Thinks he educated me
in Oxford University.

59
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,445
You admitted me
in a Govt. school.

60
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,447
That too, Tamil medium
My fluency will be limited.

61
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,617
Our Abdul Kalam studied
in the same Govt. school.

62
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,819
He became a scientist and
then the President of our nation.

63
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:58,091
Sivan, chief of ISRO and Sagayam, IAS
are all alumni of Govt. school.

64
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,459
You should also be like them--

65
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,595
All that is fine.
First, come out of the loo.

66
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,729
Then, Dad.

67
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,665
Tea is on the table, okay?

68
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,832
Okay, go.

69
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

70
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,235
[coughing]

71
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,175
Dad, are you smoking in there?

72
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,610
Of course not.

73
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,011
Don't you dare lie to me.

74
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,813
Doubting my words, rascal!

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,981
Yes, very true.

76
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,149
Come out now.

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,519
I know you have flushed the cigarette.

78
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,988
How many times I've shown you
videos on YouTube?

79
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,123
For you to know
the ill effects of smoking!

80
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,492
I know, my dear.

81
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,797
Your lungs are like cotton.

82
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:42,336
If not taken care of in the proper manner
you will be prone to terrible disease--

83
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,071
You realize that, don't you?

84
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,674
I get it but I don't know where I kept it.

85
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,445
What a hotshot message
that blessed chap has forwarded.

86
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,847
Wait, Dear, I have to
forward this right away.

87
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,282
Forward it to my group.

88
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,986
How many times should I tell you not to
forward these forwarded messages?

89
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,221
Our group will be on fire today!

90
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:05,025
I'll remove you from all the groups
when you are asleep tonight.

91
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,530
But don't unsubscribe me
from the '60's kids' group please!

92
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,801
You're getting ready in five minutes.

93
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,172
Wow! So cool, Man.

94
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,306
Coming.

95
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,643
Our Govt. says yes to public exams
and then cancels them.

96
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,144
It's all a mystery, right?

97
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,379
Forget it.

98
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,647
Forget all about it.

99
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,148
We'll cross the bridge
when we get to it!

100
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,416
Hey!

101
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,985
Hey lovekiniyal, love you.

102
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,520
-Hit you.
-Escape!

103
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,956
-Hi, sister. Good morning.
-Good morning.

104
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,225
You are shining brighter than
the full moon, Sister.

105
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,960
Did you scrub your face
with orange peel?

106
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,629
We'll upload your picture in Facebook.
You'll get 'likes' sky-high.

107
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,598
Hey, come on, focus.

108
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,401
I made rice flakes upma for both of you.

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,535
-Okay? Bye.
-Okay.

110
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,670
Fresh vegetables.

111
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,239
Hi, Uncle. Hi, Aunty.

112
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,074
Come, Anbu.
Join us for breakfast.

113
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,243
It's okay, Aunty.
I've already eaten.

114
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,545
Hello, Mr. Raghavan.
You seem to be too busy.

115
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,681
It's all organic, Dear.
Nothing to go gaga over.

116
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,418
Hey Insta! What's your video for today?

117
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,386
Sister, don't announce it so loudly.

118
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:12,960
-Anbu.
-Yes, Uncle.

119
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,329
Tell me if my mother's tablets
need to be ordered again.

120
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,563
Yes, Uncle.

121
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,237
If you don't wear your slippers,
how will you be cured of arthritis?

122
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,538
Oh, you are here.

123
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,073
As soon as the clock strikes nine,

124
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,343
thinking of you, my heart
starts beating ten times faster.

125
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,745
If you come five minutes late
one day, what will--

126
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,682
What will happen is a silly thought.
And so just zip your lips.

127
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,118
Aaaah... ouch!

128
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,687
I haven't even injected you.

129
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,923
Not yet, huh?

130
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,825
Go ahead, be gentle.

131
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:49,162
After giving birth to five sons, you are
bringing the roof down for one injection!

132
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,364
Gentle, ouch!

133
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,665
Over, over.

134
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:57,504
Why don't you sit next to this grandma for
five minutes, chat and then breeze out?

135
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,706
Don't have the time to chit-chat.
What is it? Tell me.

136
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,642
Why do you have wheels on your feet?

137
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,277
Razo is over, huh?

138
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,678
Come to the point.

139
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,613
Your father came here yesterday.

140
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,050
Listen, don't start a tirade
against my dad.

141
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,287
He doesn't like you going
to Canada one bit it seems.

142
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,621
I don't like it either.

143
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,890
Have you seen the board
outside my house?

144
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,159
"Anbirkiniyal"
in bold capital letters.

145
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,495
But I haven't paid my EMI dues
for three months, you know?

146
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,399
If it continues like this, the board will
be right there, bank will seize our house.

147
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,502
That's alright, why can't you go
through tough times right here?

148
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,737
What a staff nurse can earn
in one month over there,

149
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,040
will take ten months
for me to earn the same!

150
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,375
I can't repay our loans if I am here.

151
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,577
And also,

152
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,813
there's a very important reason
for me to go to Canada.

153
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,650
Men above 60 over there,

154
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,786
are super smart it seems.

155
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:50,624
I'll fix up an awesome gentleman for you.

156
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,561
Look how you are blushing!

157
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,029
[honking]

158
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,966
He's ready and waiting for me, right?
Now he'll yell out my name.

159
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,701
As if I've vanished into thin air.

160
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,902
Anbu.

161
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,003
You can hear his voice now.

162
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,171
Anbu.

163
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,006
I told you.

164
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,374
Okay, I have to go now, bye.

165
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,276
Hey! One minute.

166
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:14,915
Don't go there and look for
a 60-70 years old companion for me.

167
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,317
If you still want to do so,

168
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,088
between 50 to 52,

169
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,389
that should suit me fine.

170
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,457
I knew it!

171
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:27,394
What is the age limit?
Fifty to fifty-two, huh?

172
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,830
I'll pickle you to pieces!

173
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,001
-Bye.
-Bye, Dear.

174
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,669
Raghavan sir,

175
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,638
come home early this evening.

176
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,073
I have an important discussion.

177
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,575
Hey!

178
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,644
Pondicherry matter is pending, right?

179
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,380
If you come back early,
we can finish that.

180
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,483
Just get us some appetizer to go with it.

181
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,652
Why are you throwing
this sudden bombshell?

182
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,587
I have to fund booze
and appetizer too, huh?

183
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,223
-Fatso! Don't hanker after freebie--
-Don't go on a yelling spree.

184
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,226
Your plan of buying booze for Rs. 500
and free dinner for Rs. 1000 is super!

185
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,028
-Okay, okay.
-What are you okaying?

186
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,664
Your quota for this month
is over, remember?

187
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,898
Fixing?

188
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:05,999
Mix-ing!

189
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,835
-What?
-Come soon.

190
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,270
You're late and then you yell at me.

191
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,973
Rub the 'chunam' off your neck.

192
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,614
I don't generally dab
powder on my face.

193
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,015
-I'm sure you don't!
-Natural.

194
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,951
Anbu, come soon.

195
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,591
Let's go.

196
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,793
-Switched off the stove?
-Yes.

197
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,028
Wait, now I have second thoughts.

198
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,630
Why did you ask me now?

199
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,669
Last night did you go to
Uncle Raghavan's house?

200
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,173
Last night you went to
Uncle Raghavan's house, right?

201
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,374
No, I didn't.

202
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,842
I'll punch you in the face
if you lie to me.

203
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,677
As if we won't visit our neighbor?

204
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,312
Mind your business, Man.

205
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,849
Dad, this is the sixth person telling me

206
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,951
that you don't like me going to Canada.

207
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,122
Mr. Shivam, shall I ask you a question?

208
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,626
Roaming from road to road a whole month
and selling your insurance policies,

209
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,927
how much will you get?

210
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,428
How does that concern you?

211
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,497
Why do you think
I attended this ILTS course?

212
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,999
And took up a part-time job?

213
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,767
You are going out of sheer boredom.

214
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,335
What else? Temerity!

215
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,570
Dad!

216
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,372
What do you want now?

217
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,107
Go to Canada?
That's it, right?

218
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,843
By all means, go, let me suffer
living all alone in solitude here.

219
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,281
Didn't you leave mom and me alone here
and go to Saudi when I was in school?

220
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,651
Hey! I went only because I wanted
to give you all the comforts.

221
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,487
Do you know how much
I suffered in that hot climate?

222
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,755
Do you know?

223
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,657
Damn! I had tanned so much.

224
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,127
Dad, why are you seriously being so funny?

225
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,997
Did you have Aamir Khan's
skin tone earlier?

226
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,533
My dear princess,
everything is a joke for you.

227
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,803
You can go to Canada
or even to Kailasa island!

228
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,374
If you want, tell me
I'll take you straight to the airport.

229
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,210
Shall I go... shall I right now?

230
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,414
Dad, you don't even have enough fuel
to take us to the nearest petrol bunk.

231
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,249
Will you head for a bunk first?

232
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,383
You're right.

233
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:09,723
Who is calling you?

234
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,058
Diana.

235
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,126
You keep getting calls
from this Diana.

236
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,628
Why don't you pick it up?

237
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:15,963
We are in a bunk, Dad.

238
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,000
Instead of making friends
with Diana and Dora

239
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,870
why don't you befriend
our own people?

240
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,404
Our own people?

241
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,307
Come here.

242
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,642
Closer.

243
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,410
Our community.

244
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:36,149
Dad, the state at which our nation is
right now, why are you fanning the flames?

245
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,818
That too in this petrol bunk.

246
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,721
Don't spin the same tale on me today.

247
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,923
I'll call and hang up,
so you know I called.

248
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,859
That's the cue for you
to take your medicine.

249
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,295
Who will do this for me
after you go to Canada?

250
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,097
I'll do the same setting an alarm.

251
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,099
In your dreams!
Sonny, fill up for Rs. 150.

252
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,300
Do you know this?

253
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,369
If it's night here,
it's daytime in Canada.

254
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,305
My friends' children went abroad

255
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,574
not one of them kept in touch, you know?

256
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,910
-How can you compare me with them?
-Who knows?

257
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,545
-What?
-I was just kidding.

258
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,614
What were you kidding about?
I would really like to know.

259
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,150
-You got the guts, speak up.
-I just did.

260
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,719
Fill for Rs. 100.

261
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,891
See you tonight, bye, Dad.

262
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,560
Anbu.

263
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,228
Come here.

264
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,031
For a long time, I've been
wanting to ask you this.

265
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,733
You keep getting a call often, right?

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,303
Even when we were at the bunk.

267
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,772
-What is her name?
-Diana.

268
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,040
Diana.

269
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,843
Ask that Diana to take
one insurance policy from me.

270
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,011
Month end. Pressure.

271
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,279
Please tell her.

272
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,014
I can tell her.

273
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,884
But she doesn't belong
to our community, right?

274
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,386
You have all these boundaries.

275
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,755
You are so clannish, isn't it?

276
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,724
See you in the evening, bye.

277
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,960
I'll give you a call and hang up,
take your medicine.

278
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,262
I don't need medicine
or any other ball of mud, bye.

279
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,966
Present unreal conditionals
make hypothetical statements.

280
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,069
Then show what would happen
in such situations.

281
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,104
Have you applied for the test?

282
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,907
Planning to do so by this weekend.

283
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,709
But I need to prepare for it.

284
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,711
I don't even mind
this 'reading & writing'.

285
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,646
Listening is way too tough.

286
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,316
-Can't we learn watching English movies?
-So my friends told me.

287
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,118
So I started watching them.

288
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,187
But they hardly spoke! Only action.

289
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,256
Oh my! Which film was that?

290
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,124
Top secret! Okay, bye.

291
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,492
Wretched female!

292
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,960
-Bye.
-Bye, Priya

293
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,931
Hey, Anbu.

294
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,400
Hey darling! Why not look at me lovingly?

295
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,613
So many fellows do penance
on one foot for love.

296
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,849
I'm vaulting over a pole for you.

297
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,285
Anbu, your love is just in your name, huh?

298
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,003
Dude, I get so bugged when I hear
the words, 'not today, tomorrow'.

299
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,173
You know how I got married
in a tearing hurry, eh?

300
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,577
Only if we make out on our wedding night
we can call it 'first night'.

301
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,613
That night hasn't dawned as yet!

302
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,849
She repeats only one word, Dude.

303
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,617
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

304
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,252
I am really facing a dead end.

305
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,387
Dude, theater or shopping,
she'll get ready at once.

306
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,556
If it's visiting her mom,
she'll fly without even telling me.

307
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:33,160
But if I broach my wish-list,
she will go on this broken record mode.

308
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,662
How long can I put up
with this 'tomorrow' mantra?

309
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,631
The entire stock will be
delivered tomorrow, sir.

310
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,399
Tomorrow, huh?

311
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,401
Hey, hey!

312
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,570
Who invented this word
'Tomorrow'?

313
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:45,706
Will they twiddle their thumbs today then?

314
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,242
How can anyone use
the word 'tomorrow'?

315
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,678
If you say that damn word,
you are dead meat, Man.

316
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,913
Get lost!

317
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,484
-Dude, you there?
-I'll call you tomorrow!

318
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:09,930
What the heck are you doing?

319
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,266
Sorry, sir. Missed it.

320
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,734
I swear that isn't funny!

321
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,270
-Do your job properly.
-Yes, sir.

322
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,040
Are you drawing
a 'rangoli' or what?

323
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,809
-Wipe fast.
-Yes, sir.

324
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,648
Why are you getting distracted?

325
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,361
Hi, your order, please.

326
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:47,434
The way she views life daily
Celebrating every moment truly

327
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:53,974
She seizes every moment of her life
Lives it to the fullest without any strife

328
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:59,146
You take life easy duly
On your shoulders daily

329
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,816
You are a firefly
In the sky flying high

330
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:07,454
Like a world by yourself anew

331
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:11,058
On the grass you're a drop of fresh dew

332
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,894
-Dealing with customers is an art.
-Yes, sir.

333
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,330
-When will you learn that art?
-Right now, sir.

334
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,464
I'm asking you seriously.

335
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:18,532
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

336
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,236
Is your chicken in house
or is it from outside?

337
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:27,341
Sir, actually all our chickens
are coming from a big farm.

338
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,510
Small small autos and lorries, sir.

339
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,446
Roads are contracts by politicians, sir.

340
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,147
Jumping, jumping, sir.

341
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,117
Roads are deep risky, sir.

342
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,953
But we are delivering
our chicken... crispy, sir.

343
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,557
Customers are licking like... this, sir.

344
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,658
How is the work?

345
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,026
Chicken best, sir.

346
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,361
Customer trust, sir.

347
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,996
Your English is worst!

348
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,597
Namaste, sir.

349
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,334
Scumbag, do you understand?

350
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,004
-Sir, he is the right person.
-Okay.

351
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,605
Your all the questions, sir.

352
00:18:58,672 --> 00:18:59,806
He answers, sir.

353
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,675
-Clean India, sir.
-Okay.

354
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,644
Excuse me.

355
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,245
Is your chicken in house

356
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,047
-or from outside?
-Out of stock, sir.

357
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,549
I'll handle this, you go.

358
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:10,117
How may I help you?

359
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,486
Is your chicken in house
or from outside?

360
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:15,956
So all the chicken are from
our own poultry farm, sir.

361
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,124
Not outside.

362
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,525
-Can I take your order?
-Okay.

363
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,327
-Wings combo, please. Yeah.
-Okay.

364
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,965
Thank you.

365
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,200
Here you go.

366
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,568
Thank you very much.

367
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,403
Your English is very nice.

368
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:30,838
-Thank you, sir.
-See you, bye.

369
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,574
Be positive is your motto

370
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,944
Yesterday, today and tomorrow

371
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,581
Just one look at her, you will see

372
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,917
Customers flip for her nice and easy

373
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,987
She gives it her all at work so sincere

374
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:50,557
Rest assured spring season is here

375
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,026
With vivid colors so bright

376
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:53,794
Thank you.

377
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,164
Won't it be a lifetime of delight?

378
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,070
Hello, The Chicken Hub.
Can I take your order, please?

379
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,372
Anbu, don't hang up on me.
Just forgive me this once.

380
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,640
-Sorry, out of stock.-Hello.

381
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,443
Who was that?
Charles, huh?

382
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,045
-Yes.
-What's his problem this time?

383
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,048
He has no responsibility whatsoever.

384
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,484
He went to play a cricket match
instead of attending an interview.

385
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,720
But he lied to me that
he went for the interview.

386
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,255
The first time you met him

387
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,724
wasn't he admitted in the hospital
after a fist-fight with someone?

388
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,360
If you select the wrong guy,
what can you expect?

389
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,963
If everything is 10/10,
life would be boring, Sister.

390
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,466
There's no love
without problems, right?

391
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,468
When I inject a patient,

392
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,803
if he yells out 'amma',
instead of the usual 'aiyo'

393
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,572
he must be good-hearted, right?

394
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,542
Hey! Which world are you in?
You'll be swept away by a crow!

395
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,377
Don't be so stuffy and Victorian!

396
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:48,148
Anbirkiniyal, you give an overdose of love,
you'll find yourself in a soup!

397
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,018
Don't you fight with Prakash
the whole night through?

398
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,021
And ask him the next day
"Have you had breakfast?"

399
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,722
How can you compare Prakash--

400
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:59,259
If I mention his name alone,
you'll melt and mellow--

401
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,561
Attend to the customer.

402
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,563
Hi, can I take your order?

403
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,997
One smokey red chicken.

404
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,241
There isn't any butter in this, my boy.

405
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,909
Sorry, sir, we serve
with less butter.

406
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,011
But your bill isn't less for sure!

407
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:20,614
[mobile ringing]

408
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,184
This doesn't look like a 3D movie.

409
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:26,286
Looks more like someone did a copycat!

410
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:27,988
Sad.

411
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,726
Madam, is the popcorn free
if it's a 3D movie?

412
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,728
-Damn!
-Okay, okay.

413
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,063
Don't waste food.

414
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,598
If you have leftovers,
pass it behind.

415
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,167
After corona, there is a demand for food.

416
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,935
That's why I gave you the idea.

417
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,036
Dad, this row.

418
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,574
-Yov! Can't you see my foot?
-Sorry.

419
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,742
Trampling all over me?

420
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,810
Get lost!

421
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:52,279
Sad.

422
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:54,615
Hello, I am Kalki.

423
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,717
Welcome.
This is your seat.

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,925
Hello.

426
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,793
Who is he?

427
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:09,563
Who is--

428
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,031
Who is?

429
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,068
-Dad, he wants to know who you are.
-Huh?

430
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,805
He wants to know who you are.

431
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:19,940
I can show him.

432
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:21,842
Hold this.

433
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,247
Hello, why did you shift?

434
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:37,691
Without knowing who I am,
can't you enjoy the movie, eh?

435
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,560
Do you know now?

436
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,729
Did you figure it out, my dear boy?

437
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,364
Dear fellow!

438
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,836
Please release your
'Conjoined Hands' now, sir.

439
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,073
-Will do.
-Keep it, keep it.

440
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,209
Let it be, it's alright.

441
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,845
Hello.

442
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,281
Nice meeting you.

443
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,084
What the hell are you doing here?

444
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:06,453
I called you so many times.
You should've picked the call.

445
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,323
Instead, father and daughter
have come to watch a lame film.

446
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,558
Dad might spot you.
Just go now.

447
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,560
I'll scoot as soon as you say
you've forgiven me.

448
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,695
No way.

449
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,929
Oh! So you won't.

450
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,334
Then as a man, I have no other choice
but to fall at your feet and beg.

451
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,403
-Touch me and I'll kill you.
-Will you kill me?

452
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,407
I'll tell uncle the truth about
how Diana died and then I'll die.

453
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,675
Uncle, aaawww!

454
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,145
Awesome, too good!

455
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,414
Okay, I forgive you, go now.

456
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,650
You could have said that already.

457
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,051
Okay.

458
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:42,856
What's all this 'sorry'
and 'thanks' between us.

459
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,458
Tell me you love me
and I'll go.

460
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,692
I won't.

461
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,296
-What's he saying now?
-He's saying 'love you', Uncle.

462
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,266
Why did he say 'I love you'?

463
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:08,115
Won't time extend its hands to relish?

464

If you don't have,
all the better, dear.

526
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:11,325
Why do I see a guilty glint
in your dad's eyes?

527
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,726
Not guilty glint.

528
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:13,994
Smoky glint.

529
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,097
-See you, Uncle.
-Okay, bye.

530
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,432
Hey!

531
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,667
Not enough if you wear a helmet,

532
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:22,135
you must lock it.

533
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,540
See you tomorrow
I have night duty today.

534
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,310
Nothing.

535
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,917
Hello, the apple of my eye!

536
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:39,786
-Apple of my--
-Eye.

537
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,154
What's going on?

538
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:43,690
I was just being affectionate.

539
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:44,825
And then?

540
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,194
My pretty precious princess sweetie.

541
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,863
Hey precious.
Come here.

542
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,132
Me?

543
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,567
Hello!

544
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,118
You shouldn't smoke
in front of your dad.

545
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:12,452
Very bad.

546
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:16,557
It's okay.

547
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,463
Swear on mother.

548
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,071
What? Got electrocuted?

549
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,575
Why won't you say so?
Place your hand on her photo.

550
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:40,247
Your mother loved my style
of smoking a cigarette.

551
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,616
She used to appreciate it so much.

552
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,619
You think you're Superstar Rajinikanth
to romanticize smoking!

553
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:49,923
Good night, Dear.
I'm reminded of your mother.

554
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,824
Dad!

555
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,728
Don't make any promises to anyone.

556
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:57,364
Your mother made me promise
in Satyam theatre, you know?

557
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,532
Ji?

558
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,534
Won't you let me go, ji?

559
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,436
Place your hand.

560
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,572
Do you have cigarettes
stashed anywhere else?

561
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,342
What does 'hmm' mean?
Take them out.

562
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,744
Hey! Hand, hand here.

563
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,017
Is that a safety locker?
Take that out too.

564
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,118
Take it.

565
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:21,154
Is this all or--

566
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:33,734
Oh my God!

567
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,404
Are you smoking or
selling cigarettes, Dad?

568
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,776
What will happen if all this nicotine
spreads into your body?

569
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,349
Open your mouth.

570
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,821
When I think about my school days,

571
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:57,958
I can only remember you running
from one hospital to another for mom.

572
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:03,997
Wasn't it to pay her hospital bills

573
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:06,133
you mortgaged your dream house
as collateral to the bank?

574
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:12,706
That day, unable to pay the interest
when you begged the bank officer

575
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:14,975
I just couldn't bear to watch it, Dad.

576
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:18,378
Enough, Dad.

577
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:23,550
You've suffered a lot
for both mom and me.

578
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,721
I want to take good care of you, Dad.

579
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:33,260
The reason I am going to Canada,
is not to put miles between us

580
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:35,896
I want to pay off these loans,

581
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:38,899
I wish to be with you always
and see you smile, Dad.

582
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,934
Dad, please.

583
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,836
Don't smoke, Dad.

584
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:47,441
Allow me to smoke
one last cigarette, Dear.

585
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:58,285
Just like you can't forget your first puff
the same goes for the last.

586
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,654
God is great!

587
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,656
If Anbu orders, dad will drop
the cigarette habit.

588
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:03,757
That's it!

589
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:06,560
From tomorrow,
dad's lifestyle will change.

590
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,830
I will maintain my body
and health properly.

591
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll avoid Raghavan even if
he calls me in the evening.

592
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:14,835
He'll call me over to drink.

593
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,639
I'll be so sober and eat
just two 'chappatis' for dinner.

594
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:22,309
And remember to take my sugar pills
even before you call me.

595
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:27,080
Half an hour before bedtime,
if I could enjoy just one cigarette,

596
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,817
you think anything bad may happen
because of my promise to you?

597
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,319
For sure, yes.

598
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,762
Dad has quit smoking!

599
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,902
Hurry up.

600
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:52,906
Sister, you feast on chicken and mutton
to your tummy's content, right?

601
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,908
Even you can't handle this cold.

602
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,010
Look at me
I'm a pure vegetarian.

603
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,145
How can I handle it?

604
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:02,115
Being a vegetarian or non-vegetarian,
is of no consequence to this minus degree.

605
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,284
Hey! Pass it on quickly.

606
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:07,621
It is a great sin for me
to just touch this chicken.

607
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,656
You carry this sin yourself.

608
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,829
Did this month's salary
get credited for you?

609
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,464
Oh, yes.

610
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:21,201
Then you carry
the rest of the sin yourself.

611
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,103
-Are you leaving? Come back soon.
-Hello?

612
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,338
Or I'll just freeze here.

613
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:25,539
-Can you hear me?-Hello?

614
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,140
-Hello?
-Hello, weak signal here.

615
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,242
Can you hear me?

616
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:30,010
-Can you hear me now?-I can hear you.

617
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:31,445
I got the job.

618
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,514
Hey! Superb!

619
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,282
Wow! When and where?

620
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,251
But the placement
is in Hyderabad.

621
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,418
I have to leave tomorrow.

622
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,153
-Tomorrow?
-No, no.

623
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:42,789
If you aren't keen, tell me.
That job is no big deal.

624
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:43,891
I will just trash it.

625
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:45,292
Your wish is my command.

626
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,927
Don't be a drama queen.

627
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,161
You better leave!

628
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,664
Okay, can you come and pick me up?

629
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,166
Now?

630
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,601
Don't you want to see me?

631
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:57,604
Of course, I do.
But some slight hiccups.

632
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,206
-What?
-Okay, wait, I'll come.

633
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:00,908
Okay, bye.

634
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:02,910
Any of you got cologne?

635
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,444
Rubbish! You had only vodka.

636
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:06,079
-You won't stink of booze, go.
-Sure?

637
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,281
Yeah, get lost.

638
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:09,283
Making a huge fuss.
That's how I've escaped often.

639
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,653
What on earth will you do
going home so early?

640
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,856
I am a newly married man.

641
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,358
Have you ever seen me go home early?

642
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,761
I come in first and leave last, why?

643
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:24,031
What?

644
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:26,667
Go, I'll deal with you later.

645
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,136
Tell me, why?

646
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:31,004
-What can I say--
-Huh?

647
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,908
It's my commitment towards this firm
and how sincerely I care for my customers.

648
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:36,009
-Yes, sir.
-Sir.

649
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,578
Your wife had called.

650
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,946
-Today...
-Today?

651
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:42,049
She's going to sleep early today.
She's asked you to eat outside and come.

652
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,984
-Hey.
-Hmm?

653
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,024
Sir?

654
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,726
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow.

655
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,561
Hey. Get lost!

656
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,531
-Okay, I'm leaving.
-Got permission?

657
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:00,000
To grant just two hours' permission
he spoke nonstop for an hour!

658
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,768
Is your guy going
by bus to Hyderabad?

659
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:02,503
Yes.

660
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,605
You go and drop him.
Or he'll go back to his match!

661
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:06,607
-No, sister, he has changed.
-Oh really?

662
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:08,375
I heard it on the News.

663
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,810
Stop teasing me.
I have to go.

664
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,944
Be safe.

665
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:18,952
I swear this is true.

666
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,288
If I go to Hyderabad,
I'll miss you like crazy.

667
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,357
I'll also miss you.

668
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,025
Why should we miss each other?

669
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,960
Why don't you come
with me to Hyderabad?

670
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,762
Nurses get a fat salary over there.

671
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,397
Why do you want to go to Canada?

672
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,667
There isn't much of a difference
between my dad and you.

673
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,803
He smothers me with hugs
and with soulful words, you beg.

674
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,505
I have an idea for you.

675
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,073
Don't go to Hyderabad tomorrow.

676
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,108
Really?

677
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:42,376
Leave tonight.

678
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,946
I am definitely going to Canada.
I won't change my mind come what may.

679
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,482
Oh! Then I have to make
a serious decision.

680
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:50,117
What serious decision?

681
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:53,587
I'll tell my mother to find me a girl
ready to come to Hyderabad and marry her.

682
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,123
-Oh! You'll marry another girl?
-Yes.

683
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,360
Stop, I say!

684
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,297
So, you've made up your mind
to marry another girl.

685
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,398
Yes, I will.

686
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:05,899
Okay.

687
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,369
I'll attend your wedding
and then go to Canada.

688
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,506
How can I miss eating the 'biriyani'
at your wedding feast?

689
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,907
No need to trouble yourself.

690
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,043
My wife and I will come
to Canada for our honeymoon.

691
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:19,546
Find a cold location in Canada.

692
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:22,216
Under the bed sheets...

693
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,551
Silly boy, start the bike.

694
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:25,919
Go.

695
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,054
Get lost!

696
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,989
??Take some elders
from home with you, go.

697
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:44,471
Hey, stop.

698
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,207
Park your bike to the side.

699
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:49,843
Come, stop here.

700
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,146
Where is your helmet?

701
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:54,915
I didn't bring it, sir.

702
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:57,084
-Then come with me, Man.
-Get down.

703
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,890
Pay the fine and go.

704
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,529
How much do you have on you?

705
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:12,199
I put all my money into Dream 11
game app and I'm penniless now, sir.

706
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,669
-What's this petty cash?
-That's all I got, sir.

707
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,004
What the hell!
Take it.

708
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,573
Sir, it's a helmet case.
If you tell me what to do...

709
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:23,644
What are you doing
out here at this time of night?

710
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,412
Sir, I came to drop her home.

711
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:29,950
Drop whom?

712
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:37,658
If it is that big a secret,
you don't have to tell me, sir.

713
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:40,093
We want you to wear a helmet
for your own safety, right?

714
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,000
Looks like sir doesn't take
safety precautions in any situation!

715
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:52,506
-Okay, take it and let him go.
-Okay, come with me.

716
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:54,074
You heard him, right?

717
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:01,682
Damn swindler!

718
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,150
What happened, Charles?

719
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:04,117
Get onto the bike.

720
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,652
-Or I'll kill him, let's go.
-What?

721
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,787
Hey!

722
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:08,789
Stop.

723
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,026
Are you drunk?

724
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:14,561
No, I...

725
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,829
-Huh?
-No.

726
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:17,831
You're losing your temper?

727
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:19,733
-Not drunk?
-No, sir.

728
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,568
No.

729
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,174
Vodka?

730
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:29,776
Hey!

731
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:30,878
Sir?

732
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:36,717
Blow.

733
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,092
Sir has passed the test.

734
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,194
Let's take him to
the station and honor him.

735
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,530
What? Go.

736
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:53,133
-What area?
-Indira Nagar, sir.

737
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:54,368
Huh?

738
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,836
Indira Nagar.

739
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,406
Get this girl's father's phone number.
Ask him to pick her up from the station.

740
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:00,474
Okay, sir.

741
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,442
Sir, sir, why all that?

742
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:03,644
I'll pay the fine, sir

743
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,646
Please talk to him, sir.
Don't call her father.

744
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,714
-Get the girl into the jeep.
-Yes, sir.

745
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,516
Sir, sir.

746
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:11,785
That girl lives close by.

747
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,254
We can send her back by auto.
Why get her into trouble, sir?

748
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,490
The state our nation is in
why do you add to the chaos?

749
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,592
Hey, he's drunk too.

750
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:20,928
What if he has his fun,
and then burns her?

751
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:22,563
-Will you take responsibility?
-Sir!

752
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:23,797
What is that 'sir' in aid of?

753
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,566
Feeling sorry for no reason.

754
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,403
She'll ride pillion
on a drunkard's bike.

755
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:30,971
Won't get into a police jeep?

756
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,774
[whistling]

757
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:40,547
-Sir, tea.
-Hey!

758
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,549
-Serve tea to the chap inside.
-Okay, sir.

759
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,485
How many family members?

760
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:50,624
-Why can't I get green tea?
-Hey!

761
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,092
Getting too big for your boots, eh?

762
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,361
Requesting just to reduce it, right?

763
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,799
Give me the number.

764
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,268
9-8-4-1-1

765
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:02,769
Six...

766
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,838
Tell me the rest of the numbers.

767
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,873
...0-0-6-1.

768
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,207
[whistling]

769
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,010
Do you live at the address
registered in your license?

770
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,278
Yes, sir.

771
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:16,583
-Where is your father employed?
-He has passed away.

772
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:19,253
Sir, that girl's father has come.

773
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:24,958
Tell him to come in.

774
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:40,807
Nothing serious to the extent
you seem worried, please sit.

775
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,213
Tell me if you can identify that boy.

776
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:52,920
I don't know him.

777
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,257
When we caught him
for a drunk & drive case,

778
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,759
your daughter was with him.

779
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,429
You had to find out
your daughter loves a chap

780
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:05,299
in a situation where you
had to come to the police station.

781
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,336
Come here.
Come sit here.

782
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,006
Sit down.

783
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,078
Sir, it wasn't such a big deal.

784
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,881
I could have collected the fine
at the spot and let them go.

785
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,884
I brought you here for the sole reason
that you should know what's going on.

786
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:27,688
The police force is responsible for
the safety of our nation's women.

787
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,756
[laughter]

788
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:31,525
Hey!

789
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:32,793
Not me.

790
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,927
It was him.

791
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,262
Let him be, sir.

792
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,064
Temerity from head to toe.

793
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:42,736
What's your name, dear?

794
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:43,871
Anbirkiniyal.

795
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:47,174
Your father has chosen
such a lovely name for you.

796
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:49,343
What's your name, son?

797
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,278
Charles Sebastian.

798
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,214
Is there any connection, sir?

799
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,218
The intention with which boys like him
fall in love is wrong per se, sir.

800
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:00,988
I can tell by just looking at his face.

801
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:04,558
I attend hundreds of such cases daily, sir.

802
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:10,430
Look, if this continues, your case will
also be filed in this station tomorrow.

803
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:11,932
Take it from me.

804
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,534
You seem like a decent person.

805
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,336
Put some sense into her head
and take her home.

806
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:18,372
Go home.

807
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,053
Dad.

808
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,760
Please--

809
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:40,687
[honking]

810
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:08,215
Tickets are available from
the beginning of next month.

811
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:10,851
But rates are a bit high
because of the season.

812
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:13,320
You will be paying less
if you book end of the month.

813
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,222
What is your preference, sir?

814
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,124
The rate doesn't matter.

815
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,059
Book the first available ticket.

816
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,861
She has to leave for Canada
at the earliest.

817
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:22,563
Okay, sir.
Thanks.

818
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,601
Excuse me.

819
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,944
Dad...

820
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:53,493
-Won't you check the stock?
-We did, sir.

821
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,962
Don't know how the rat got in.

822
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,797
Who knows if it was you or the rat?

823
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,532
Sorry, sir, this won't happen again.

824
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,301
How will the customer accept my apology?
Why should I be humiliated?

825
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,904
-What happened, Sister?
-You checked the stock yesterday?

826
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,240
Bhavesh and I checked it.

827
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,409
Rats ruined all the stock.
The manager is asking for you.

828
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:11,845
Is it my job to listen
to all your stupid excuses?

829
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:12,980
Come, madam.

830
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,681
You can leave.
I've fired you.

831
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:17,684
You have been chosen for
'The Best Sales Girl' award this year.

832
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:20,254
You've worked so diligently, you see.

833
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,856
I'll be the one targeted
during the time of inspection.

834
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:24,725
I've repeated this a hundred times to you.

835
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:26,960
Check the list when we get fresh stock.

836
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,662
This stock is worth Rs. 12,000.

837
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,864
Will your father reimburse?

838
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:33,133
Why are you glaring at me?

839
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:34,902
When you flashed your teeth asking me

840
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:36,904
for one hour permission,
did you glare at me?

841
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:38,505
Huh?

842
00:45:38,705 --> 00:45:42,709
If you repeat this once more,
my words will spit out differently!

843
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:45,579
-Clear out!
-Sir, sir.

844
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:47,481
Please, sir.
Forgive me this once.

845
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:48,749
Sir, sir.

846
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:51,084
It's okay.
Get ready.

847
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,720
Call after sometime.

848
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:12,873
Have you washed your hands?

849
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,310
Customers are waiting in a queue
out there, but it's okay.

850
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:17,878
You stuff your face!

851
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:19,746
Isn't that the reason we are here?

852
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:21,915
Damn!

853
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,157
-Sir, your order number?
-98.

854
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:32,125
You go, I'll attend to him.

855
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:34,027
Give me order number 98.

856
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,997
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

857
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,801
-Hi.
-Anbu, come outside.

858
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:42,836
Sir, can I take your order, please?

859
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:45,939
Anbu, I need to talk
to you now, come outside.

860
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,941
Customers are waiting.
Please give your order.

861
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,576
I'm leaving for Hyderabad tonight.

862
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,044
We can't talk after this, understan--

863
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:53,247
-Sir, customers are waiting.
-Hello.

864
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,482
Keep your love story out of this.

865
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:58,185
Can't you see customers are waiting?

866
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,521
Is this some kind of drama?

867
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:01,688
Sorry, sir.

868
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:03,357
One Coke.
One French fries.

869
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:06,727
Is this how you treat your staff
in front of the customer, huh?

870
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:09,162
Give it to him.

871
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,907
-Anything else you want, ma'am?
-One chicken nugget.

872
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:21,675
Your order, sir.

873
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:27,714
-Excuse me.
-Sir?

874
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,859
Would he have done this if he was
even the least bit responsible?

875
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,827
Don't keep fretting about it.

876
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:43,730
You are anyway leaving
for Canada very soon.

877
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:45,732
Why do you want to fret and fume?

878
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:48,235
Don't worry about anything.
It will all work out fine.

879
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:49,703
How are you going home?

880
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,906
Hey! I'm talking to you.
How are you going home?

881
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:56,476
-I'll take an auto.
-Go home safe.

882
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:57,978
I'm leaving now.

883
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:00,380
Going to a temple
in the morning with Prakash.

884
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:02,249
-He will yell if I'm late.
-Okay.

885
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:29,209
The customer you are calling
is unable to take your call right now.

886
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,310
Please try after some--

887
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,483
Not leaving, Sister?

888
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:39,953
-I'll go in a bit.
-Okay, I'm leaving, bye.

889
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:46,326
Charles.

890
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:49,763
Hey, Charles.

891
00:48:50,397 --> 00:48:51,765
Did you want this shirt?

892
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:55,936
Where are you now?

893
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:57,538
I am still in the Hub.

894
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,773
Hey! It's 11:45.

895
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,208
What are you doing there still?

896
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:04,578
My dad hasn't spoken
a single word to me.

897
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,049
I don't know how I'll face him, Sister.

898
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,118
He's your father, right?

899
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:12,819
What's the problem in facing him?

900
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,622
I don't feel like going home.

901
00:49:15,923 --> 00:49:18,959
Don't be an idiot.
Go home now.

902
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,163
He won't yell at you.

903
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:24,865
Things will get ironed out.

904
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:26,366
Go home right now.

905
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:27,968
Hmmm, okay, Sister.

906
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:30,737
Dude, her dad has the gall to ask me
"Have you got yourself tested?"

907
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:33,140
You know my grandfather had 12 children.

908
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,308
In that--

909
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:36,844
Bought everything?

910
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,979
Soda sponsored by the company.
All good, let's go.

911
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,447
Hey! Shall we take some chicken?

912
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:42,416
Will any human eat this? Come!

913
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:44,251
My father has seven children.
I have six siblings.

914
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,686
Where do I keep this stock, sir?

915
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:47,487
Keep it there, Ramajayam.

916
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,593
He is doubting my virility!

917
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:55,229
What is my family's depth?
If we start making--

918
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,464
Hey! Where are you off to?

919
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,733
-We are leaving--
-Keep this stock inside.

920
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,769
Will your father come
to keep this inside?

921
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,705
I asked if your father
is joining here tomorrow?

922
00:50:04,805 --> 00:50:06,106
Keep it in and then go.

923
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:12,346
Thank you.

924
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:14,214
Please keep this in the freezer.

925
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,849
-We have to go.
-No.

926
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:18,118
-Please, please, please.
-It's already late.

927
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,653
Please, Sister.

928
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,121
Please do us this favor.

929
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,625
Give it fast.

930
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:26,560
Hurry up, Dude.

931
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:29,196
Hey! We forgot to punch out.

932
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:31,932
Press fast.

933
00:50:32,165 --> 00:50:33,734
Thank you.

934
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:37,471
Even if that man stops us,
turn a deaf ear, just scoot.

935
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:41,008
-What does our Siddha guru say?
-Didn't say anything, sir.

936
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:42,509
We kept everything inside.

937
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,411
Er, go, go.

938
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:47,748
What I'm saying is
marital bond is an ocean.

939
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,317
You have to dive deep
to take out the pearls!

940
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,332
How many you know?

941
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,000
How many aphrodisiacs
I bought for her?

942
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,402
But she hasn't touched them!

943
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:15,375
Even if she is my wife, I shouldn't touch
her if she isn't interested it seems.

944
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,411
No means 'no' I believe, huh?

945
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:23,517
No way.

946
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,086
She will simply be following
social distancing all the time!

947
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:28,455
You know what distance
she maintains happily?

948
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:31,959
Without her even hearing
the door being locked the other night

949
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,161
I tiptoed into the room silently.

950
00:51:34,228 --> 00:51:36,196
She said, "Hey! Get out."

951
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:37,798
She doesn't watch web series.

952
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:39,466
Only TV serials!

953
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:55,549
The other day, listen, Dude,
we planned to go on our honeymoon.

954
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,117
Guess what happened?

955
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,555
Her entire family landed up!

956
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,257
She coolly said
you be here, I'll be there.

957
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:04,258
Imagine how I would've felt.

958
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:09,229
Be on the line.

959
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,388
Wait, Dude.
I'll punch out and come.

960
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:38,425
I take her out for a candlelight dinner
She asks for the lights to be turned on!

961
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:41,895
Worst!

962
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:45,098
No way will she agree to all that.

963
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:16,797
Sir, sir.

964
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,800
Hello?

965
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:20,934
Hello, sir.

966
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:25,839
Yes, I've just left now.

967
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,775
Sir, please.

968
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:36,183
Sir, please, sir.

969
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:41,989
Where was I?

970
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,393
Hello!

971
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,066
Sir, hello.

972
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:17,724
Sir.

973
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,328
Sir, please.

974
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:30,003
Hello!

975
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,819
Bro, hasn't Anbu come home as yet?

976
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:46,720
Not yet.

977
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:49,556
Sometimes her shift changes.

978
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,592
She should be home soon.

979
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:29,930
Sir?

980
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:33,166
Sir, any luggage to be kept in?

981
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:47,915
Get in, get in.

982
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,536
Prakash, can't you hear
my mobile ringing?

983
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:13,707
Yes, Uncle.

984
00:56:15,242 --> 00:56:16,910
Anbu hasn't come home as yet?

985
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:19,613
I left work a bit early.

986
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:23,283
I'll ask the other boys
and call you back, Uncle.

987
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:26,653
She was in the pantry when I left, Sister.

988
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:29,656
Ask Gopi or Sannath.

989
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:31,258
Okay.

990
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:32,659
We left earlier.

991
00:56:33,193 --> 00:56:34,561
Anbu left only after we did.

992
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:37,497
Manager was there,
why don't you call him?

993
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,801
Okay. I'll call sir.

994
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:41,802
Okay, okay.

995
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:43,470
-Dear, then tomorrow?
-Shut up and go.

996
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,571
Okay, dear.

997
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:45,806
I was just clarifying!

998
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:49,643
Why me?

999
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:53,747
Sir?

1000
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:57,184
-Has Anbu punched out?
-Listen.

1001
00:56:57,284 --> 00:56:58,752
She has punched out and gone.

1002
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,554
I've also punched out and come.

1003
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:02,489
-Then, sir--
-Then what?

1004
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,625
I'll be twiddling my thumbs
lying on the sofa, huh?

1005
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:06,727
As if you tell me before you leave?

1006
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:07,895
Do I need this?

1007
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:09,596
I know only one word!

1008
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:11,598
Tomorrow!

1009
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:12,666
Hello, Uncle.

1010
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,103
Manager said she left the Hub.

1011
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:17,905
Is that so?

1012
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,878
Alright.

1013
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:27,047
Okay.

1014
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:53,307
The person you are calling is
not answering, please try later.

1015
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:05,839
Please.

1016
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:32,499
Please.

1017
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,810
[banging]

1018
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:50,184
[muffled banging]

1019
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:09,236
Please.

1020
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:14,608
Dad, I can hear a banging noise here.

1021
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:18,245
I came with my son
for the theater experience.

1022
01:01:18,312 --> 01:01:19,713
My son is calling me.

1023
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:22,015
What is it?

1024
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:24,418
Dad, I can hear some banging noise inside.

1025
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:27,654
You can't hear any sound
in a locked shop.

1026
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,681
[banging noise]

1027
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:58,378
The customer you are calling is not--

1028
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:40,020
Hello, sir.

1029
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:43,624
Sir.

1030
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:45,459
You, huh?

1031
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,896
Just as I said yesterday
you proved me right.

1032
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,765
My tongue is known for jinxing!

1033
01:08:51,832 --> 01:08:54,101
-What happened?
-His daughter didn't get back home.

1034
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,036
I knew this would happen.

1035
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:59,072
You must have given her
a thrashing after going home.

1036
01:08:59,173 --> 01:09:01,975
No, sir, nothing of that sort happened.

1037
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:03,810
I told you, sir.
Voice of experience!

1038
01:09:04,278 --> 01:09:05,579
Why didn't you listen to me, sir?

1039
01:09:06,713 --> 01:09:09,650
Okay, did you call up
her usual friends' circle?

1040
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:14,288
We've looked for her at
her class and workplace.

1041
01:09:14,521 --> 01:09:16,023
They claim she didn't come.

1042
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:19,092
When does she come home usually?

1043
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,695
Around 12 midnight.

1044
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,531
Usual time is 12?

1045
01:09:24,598 --> 01:09:26,934
Sir, her work is such.

1046
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:29,403
Where does she work
to come home at midnight?

1047
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:33,574
Sir, she works in Chicken Hub
in Grand Mall.

1048
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:36,009
That boy who was here yesterday

1049
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:37,611
did you ask him?

1050
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:40,414
Sir, that is... not necessary.

1051
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:44,184
Girls nowadays look at
photos in Instagram,

1052
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:46,687
few videos in Tik-Tok and elope happily.

1053
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:48,989
My daughter isn't like that, sir.

1054
01:09:49,323 --> 01:09:51,291
Don't be so overconfident.

1055
01:09:51,558 --> 01:09:53,260
First, go and find out
where the boy is.

1056
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:54,962
We are here to register
a complaint, sir.

1057
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:58,699
Don't I know to accept a complaint?
Didn't you hear a word I said?

1058
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:01,068
You'll come back here
and say she's married,

1059
01:10:01,134 --> 01:10:03,704
you'll want to withdraw the complaint
and give us a hard time?

1060
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,406
Is this our profession?
Are we running a matrimonial site?

1061
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:10,043
Go and ask him first.
Do as I say.

1062
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,949
By now she would have married
that boy and made out with him.

1063
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,586
-What's the use of coming now?
-Ignore him, let's go.

1064
01:10:19,686 --> 01:10:20,954
Call him and find out.

1065
01:10:21,188 --> 01:10:24,091
His phone will be switched off.
Go directly to his house.

1066
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:25,626
Sir, this complaint--

1067
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:28,095
What is it, Man?
You get a pen and paper--

1068
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:30,097
Keep it aside.

1069
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:33,133
You there!

1070
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:35,202
I'm talking to you.

1071
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:37,070
Go and attend to your work.

1072
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,073
Sticking like a leech.

1073
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:42,809
Look at you!

1074
01:10:44,711 --> 01:10:45,913
Phone is switched off.

1075
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:48,515
Hasn't the constable texted
his address to your phone?

1076
01:10:48,615 --> 01:10:49,883
Let's go to his house.

1077
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,486
Raghava, I know my daughter.
Anbu wouldn't have eloped.

1078
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:54,888
I agree, I'm not saying
we should go and confront.

1079
01:10:54,955 --> 01:10:57,090
If we go directly and ask
we may get some information.

1080
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:58,225
Let's go.

1081
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,538
-May I know who you are?
-We called Charles several times.

1082
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,607
His phone is switched off.

1083
01:11:46,673 --> 01:11:48,342
We came to see him in person.

1084
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:49,943
He isn't here.

1085
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:53,080
Would you like to come in?

1086
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,215
No, it's alright.

1087
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:56,783
Where has he gone?

1088
01:11:57,117 --> 01:11:59,453
He left for Hyderabad tonight.

1089
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:02,389
Did he tell you anything
before he left?

1090
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:05,893
No, he didn't.
Is there any problem?

1091
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:07,528
Not specifically.

1092
01:12:08,195 --> 01:12:12,332
If he calls you,
ask him to contact this number.

1093
01:12:15,202 --> 01:12:16,603
[mobile ringing]

1094
01:12:20,073 --> 01:12:21,575
Your name, please.

1095
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:24,011
Tell him, Anbu's father Sivam
wanted to meet him.

1096
01:12:24,077 --> 01:12:25,078
He will know.

1097
01:13:06,653 --> 01:13:07,855
Nothing serious, Dear.

1098
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:10,724
Only a minor dislocation.

1099
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,627
Don't be scared.
You will be fine.

1100
01:13:39,286 --> 01:13:40,921
Did you get any information, Uncle?

1101
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:43,757
No, Charle's phone is also switched off.

1102
01:13:44,691 --> 01:13:48,128
Anbu said he had got a job
in Hyderabad and was leaving tonight.

1103
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,598
-He's the one calling.
-Answer.

1104
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,768
Hello, hello.

1105
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,103
Hello.

1106
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:58,105
Disconnected.

1107
01:13:58,305 --> 01:13:59,506
Try his number again.

1108
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:09,850
Where is my daughter?

1109
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:11,652
Sir, I don't know.

1110
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:18,158
-Where is my daughter?
-I swear I don't know.

1111
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:19,426
Tell me the truth.

1112
01:14:19,526 --> 01:14:20,494
He knows.

1113
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:21,895
-Siva.
-Tell me.

1114
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:22,930
Siva, stop it.

1115
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:25,465
-No, he knows everything.
-Let's be calm and talk it over.

1116
01:14:25,532 --> 01:14:26,800
He is hiding something.

1117
01:14:28,535 --> 01:14:30,304
Even if I wasn't talking to her

1118
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:33,574
my Anbu gave me her usual
'missed' call as a reminder tonight.

1119
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,543
He has brainwashed her somehow.

1120
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,745
Uncle, please, nothing drastic
would've happened to her.

1121
01:14:38,846 --> 01:14:39,847
I'll talk to him.

1122
01:14:39,913 --> 01:14:40,781
I'll ask him.

1123
01:14:42,115 --> 01:14:44,218
Where is Anbu?
What has happened?

1124
01:14:44,284 --> 01:14:45,853
I swear I don't know.

1125
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:48,789
I've called her repeatedly.
She didn't pick my calls at all.

1126
01:14:48,889 --> 01:14:50,591
She comes with you always, right?

1127
01:14:51,024 --> 01:14:52,960
I left home early tonight.

1128
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:55,462
Gopi says Anbu left
only after he left.

1129
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:56,597
I called the manager.

1130
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:58,599
He says she punched out and left.

1131
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,134
Sivam, somehow I don't trust that boy.

1132
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,438
The best idea is to take him
with us to the police station.

1133
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,273
Get into our car.

1134
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:47,341
-What, man?-That girl who is missing.

1135
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:49,376
Sir, her people have come to the station.

1136
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:52,212
Her father has traced the boy, sir.

1137
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,748
But that girl isn't with the boy, sir.

1138
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:58,652
Tell them I'll take one hour to return.

1139
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:01,755
It will be too late, sir?

1140
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:03,223
You are in the next street and--

1141
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,159
Does your name mean 'good pearl'
or good-for-nothing pearl?

1142
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:07,961
Are you working
for the Govt. or them?

1143
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:10,631
-How much bribe did you take?
-Let me talk to him.

1144
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:15,536
Sir, you said you'll accept a complaint
only after we trace the boy and ask him.

1145
01:17:16,036 --> 01:17:17,738
I'm here now with that boy.

1146
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:21,341
You are talking without an iota
of responsibility whatsoever.

1147
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:24,645
What happened to your responsibility
in raising your daughter properly?

1148
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:26,413
You are questioning me, huh?

1149
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,482
It will take an hour
for me to come.

1150
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:31,818
He's a half-baked idiot.
This is so typical of him.

1151
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:35,122
Whomever you called on the phone,
go and enquire in person.

1152
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:38,225
Friends generally won't tell you
the truth over the phone.

1153
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:41,228
Sir, Anbu would never go away
like this without informing.

1154
01:17:41,562 --> 01:17:44,598
Don't you dare vouch for her now!
You are the root cause of all this mess.

1155
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:59,546
Her mood was off this morning
when she spoke to me, Uncle.

1156
01:22:59,613 --> 01:23:00,881
I asked her what had upset her.

1157
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:03,350
But she didn't tell me anything, Uncle.

1158
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:06,086
Uncle, any problem?

1159
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:07,888
I tried calling her this evening.

1160
01:23:07,955 --> 01:23:09,756
But she didn't pick my call.

1161
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:11,291
I'll call you back.

1162
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:13,293
Give me that phone.

1163
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:31,945
We've asked everyone
she is in touch with.

1164
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:36,116
I'm asking you as last resort.

1165
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,054
I don't care who you are.

1166
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:43,023
I just want my daughter back.

1167
01:23:43,423 --> 01:23:47,127
Listen, if Anbu is with you 24x7
only because she wants to marry you.

1168
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,530
I will perform that damn wed--

1169
01:23:49,596 --> 01:23:50,998
I'll get you both married.

1170
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:54,935
Please show my daughter to me.

1171
01:23:55,569 --> 01:23:58,305
In your anger, you don't know
what you are saying, sir.

1172
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:02,576
Anbu told me she will marry me
only after she repays all your debts.

1173
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:07,848
Will such a girl forget you in one night
and come away with me, huh?

1174
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,351
You were the one who said,

1175
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:13,720
even if you weren't talking to her,

1176
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:16,256
she gave you a 'missed' call
as reminder to take your pills.

1177
01:24:17,357 --> 01:24:20,160
Sir, even when she meets me
and I tell her to go after ten minutes,

1178
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,596
she'll say her dad will worry
and leave in a hurry, sir.

1179
01:24:23,997 --> 01:24:27,267
She would have never dreamt
we would meet in such a situation.

1180
01:24:28,468 --> 01:24:29,670
Sorry, sir.

1181
01:24:30,304 --> 01:24:33,473
I didn't expect last night
to end on that note, sir.

1182
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:37,644
We are looking for her
at the wrong place, sir.

1183
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:39,646
God knows where
and what fix she is--

1184
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:46,186
We've looked in all the places
you asked us to.

1185
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:47,688
Anbu is nowhere to be found.

1186
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:49,990
Hello?

1187
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:52,326
Yes, sir.

1188
01:24:52,726 --> 01:24:54,461
I'll come immediately, sir.

1189
01:24:54,528 --> 01:24:56,630
Let's go, that call
was from the station.

1190
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:06,139
Raghava, Anbu gets a call
ever so often from a girl.

1191
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:07,374
Who?

1192
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:08,709
Her name is--

1193
01:25:08,976 --> 01:25:10,077
Diana.

1194
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:11,645
If we know who Diana is--

1195
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:14,548
Do you know that Diana?

1196
01:25:15,516 --> 01:25:16,717
Sir?

1197
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:18,719
I am Diana.

1198
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:26,460
Go.

1199
01:28:50,564 --> 01:28:55,068
The Gods are by your side herein
O' girl, stand with strength from within

1200
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:58,805
Your courage will stand in good stead
For you to survive instead

1201
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:03,744
Guts and grit in your heart in tow
Your eyes are as sharp as Arjuna's bow

1202
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:08,115
Your mind's will and intelligence
Will be a fortress wall of defense

1203
01:29:13,086 --> 01:29:17,291
Don't succumb to pressure and fall down
Like a bamboo that bends to the ground

1204
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:22,796
Against all odds, step by step
Like a ladder rise to the top

1205
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:28,402
Make the smallest particle a pillar
To ensure safety from this disaster

1206
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:34,308
When sorrows start to drizzle
The sky will never fall in any debacle

1207
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,532
She will go home direct
after work usually.

1208
01:29:58,599 --> 01:30:01,068
Something must have happened
en route mall to her place, sir.

1209
01:30:01,168 --> 01:30:05,606
If we call cyber cell, they can
track Anbu for sure, sir.

1210
01:30:05,672 --> 01:30:07,241
Her phone is ringing even now.

1211
01:30:08,609 --> 01:30:09,810
Cyber cell, huh?

1212
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:12,713
Why didn't I think of this?

1213
01:30:15,115 --> 01:30:16,483
Why did you come here?

1214
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,685
You could have gone
directly to cyber cell, huh?

1215
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:20,454
First, give me your phone.

1216
01:30:20,854 --> 01:30:23,624
I'll decide if I should call cyber cell,
or lock you up in the cell here.

1217
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,560
-What's your password?
-Sir.

1218
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:27,828
Anbu, sir.

1219
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:30,764
Looks like you change
your password often.

1220
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:35,035
So many calls
from the morning.

1221
01:30:36,136 --> 01:30:38,005
You've sketched a plan brilliantly.

1222
01:30:38,805 --> 01:30:40,741
Tell me this, looks like
she called you repeatedly.

1223
01:30:40,807 --> 01:30:42,242
Why didn't you pick her call?

1224
01:30:42,309 --> 01:30:43,777
I was leaving for Hyderabad, sir.

1225
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:46,346
You were leaving, suddenly got enlightened

1226
01:30:46,413 --> 01:30:48,982
and started searching high
and low for her?

1227
01:30:49,049 --> 01:30:51,251
I saw his 'missed' call in my phone.

1228
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:53,387
That's why I came back immediately.

1229
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:55,189
You are a seasoned lover boy.

1230
01:30:56,323 --> 01:30:58,392
You must have been
fast with your moves.

1231
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:02,062
That girl would have said
we'll wait till we are married.

1232
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:03,330
You would have taken her--

1233
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:04,431
Sir.

1234
01:31:05,032 --> 01:31:07,167
I don't think that boy
has done anything wrong.

1235
01:31:07,234 --> 01:31:09,136
So does the fault lies
with your daughter?

1236
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:11,972
Allow me to investigate properly, sir.

1237
01:31:13,841 --> 01:31:15,709
Nagging me over the phone.

1238
01:31:16,243 --> 01:31:18,412
You roam around with
the accused under your armpit!

1239
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:19,479
Sit down.

1240
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:22,015
I'm standing anyway.

1241
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,918
Will he blurt out everything
in front of you?

1242
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,158
Okay.

1243
01:31:32,292 --> 01:31:33,427
Where is the girl?

1244
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:34,895
Sir, I really don't know.

1245
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:37,998
Is she alive or--

1246
01:31:38,765 --> 01:31:42,169
I know what you would
have done with that girl.

1247
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:43,737
Better cough up the truth.

1248
01:31:43,804 --> 01:31:46,206
Your plan is to upload
the video... how is it?

1249
01:31:46,573 --> 01:31:48,141
Just you or your friends pitched--

1250
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:49,977
Sir, don't let your tongue run.

1251
01:31:50,043 --> 01:31:51,945
How dare you speak to me like that?

1252
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:54,248
-Sir, sir.
-Mind your business.

1253
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:59,953
You party only to get the girl drunk
and have fun with her, right?

1254
01:32:00,487 --> 01:32:01,788
I won't blame you fully.

1255
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:04,224
You wouldn't have made your move
without her angling for it.

1256
01:32:04,324 --> 01:32:07,694
So should we be on night duty
if she sends the wrong signals?

1257
01:32:07,761 --> 01:32:10,797
Should we be here
on night duty?

1258
01:32:11,965 --> 01:32:14,501
If you utter one more word,
maligning my daughter's morals

1259
01:32:14,568 --> 01:32:16,703
I'll disregard the fact
that you are a police officer.

1260
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:20,641
We come here asking for help
only because we don't know anything.

1261
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:22,910
You are asking us
all the questions and--

1262
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,511
Hey! What's all this ruckus about?

1263
01:32:24,611 --> 01:32:25,846
Ravi, what's the problem?

1264
01:32:25,913 --> 01:32:28,882
I was investigating the case
and this old man is hitting me, sir.

1265
01:32:28,949 --> 01:32:30,017
What is the matter?

1266
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:33,353
Sir, it's more than three hours
since my daughter went missing.

1267
01:32:33,453 --> 01:32:34,788
He hasn't taken any action.

1268
01:32:34,855 --> 01:32:36,623
He isn't even willing to
register my complaint.

1269
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:40,794
All we did was suggest he calls up
the cyber cell to inform them.

1270
01:32:40,894 --> 01:32:42,329
He is bashing up this boy.

1271
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:44,598
-Didn't you take their complaint?
-No, sir.

1272
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:47,067
-If I interrogate this bo--
-Did you call cyber cell?

1273
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,937
What is your problem
in calling the cyber cell?

1274
01:32:50,003 --> 01:32:51,004
Why didn't you call?

1275
01:32:51,605 --> 01:32:53,507
Did you try to call that girl?

1276
01:32:53,574 --> 01:32:55,576
Sir, her phone rings fully and
gets automatically disconnected.

1277
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:57,411
Both of you come with me.

1278
01:32:58,078 --> 01:33:00,948
You will track that phone
and tell me as soon as possible.

1279
01:33:01,014 --> 01:33:02,316
Understood?

1280
01:34:28,402 --> 01:34:30,137
-She has left, sir.
-Is that so?

1281
01:34:30,204 --> 01:34:31,772
I am sure she left, sir.

1282
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:33,607
I even checked the punch-out list.

1283
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:36,043
Send that punched out list
to this number immediately.

1284
01:34:41,915 --> 01:34:45,319
Sir, punch out list shows
your daughter left the workplace.

1285

She has left the shop.

1286
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:50,891
Does she have any problem with anyone?

1287
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:52,926
Not now, I mean generally.

1288
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:53,994
No, sir.

1289
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:57,464
As far as I know,
nothing of that sort, sir.

1290
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,933

hassle Anbu often, sir.

-Which auto stand?
-The one in front of the mall, sir.

-Yes, sir.

-Inform all the stations about that girl.
-Okay, sir.

I'll follow.

to all the police stations.

Okay, sir.

01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,716
Did you get any information
from the cyber cell?

1299
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:16,884
No, sir.

1300
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,486
As soon as you get any information
intimate me, understand?

1301
01:35:20,053 --> 01:35:21,054
Okay, sir.

1302

I am sure she left, sir.

1303

I even checked the punch-out list.

She has left the shop.

1306
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:57,090
Gopi says Anbu left
only after he left.

1307
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:59,092
Sir, sir, please stop the car.

1308

01:42:18,672 --> 01:42:20,674
-Keep the stock where?
-Freezer room.

1392
01:42:21,508 --> 01:42:22,943
-Who is calling?
-Charles.

1393
01:42:23,844 --> 01:42:26,013
Joseph, go at once, check
the freezer room in the hub--

1394
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:27,214
-Hello?
-Hello?

1395
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:30,684
-Hello, Charles machan.
-Hello?

1396
01:42:32,286 --> 01:42:34,054
What happened, Bro?

1397
01:42:34,388 --> 01:42:35,522
Give me your phone.

1398
01:42:35,589 --> 01:42:37,224
Didn't bring my phone.
Charging at home.

1399
01:42:37,324 --> 01:42:38,325
Move aside.

1400
01:43:09,156 --> 01:43:10,724
What about the CCTV footage?

1401
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:14,161
We have checked all the CCTVs nearby.
Her face has not registered, sir.

1402
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:15,696
Did you check inside the mall?

1403
01:43:15,762 --> 01:43:17,197
Manager isn't reachable, sir.

1404
01:43:17,998 --> 01:43:19,266
Where does he live?

1405
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,202
A short distance from here.
Galaxy apartment.

1406
01:43:22,269 --> 01:43:24,605
That's near Kamakshi hospital, right?

1407
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:26,874
Both of you stay here.
You come with me.

1408
01:44:01,808 --> 01:44:05,012
Sir, we can send
the girl's tower location.

1409
01:44:06,446 --> 01:44:08,315
-We can send, Man.
-Then please do, sir.

1410
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,251
Sir.

1411
01:44:11,318 --> 01:44:13,854
But I have forgotten his password.

1412
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:16,190
How did we draw his pattern?

1413
01:44:16,523 --> 01:44:18,091
Like this or straight?

1414
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:19,593
Which one?

1415
01:44:19,693 --> 01:44:22,496
Poor girl, sir, something drastic
shouldn't happen to her.

1416
01:44:22,563 --> 01:44:24,932
Her father isn't even concerned
to the extent you are!

1417
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:28,035
He had the gall to accost me,
a police officer, eh?

1418
01:44:29,002 --> 01:44:31,438
Inspector gives me a piece of his mind.

1419
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:35,809
But tell me why aren't
you feeling bad for me?

1420
01:44:35,876 --> 01:44:37,044
Sir, I am--

1421
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,281
It concerns a girl.

1422
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:42,883
Must deal coolly with this.

1423
01:44:56,964 --> 01:44:58,265
Where are you off to?

1424
01:44:58,732 --> 01:45:00,901
I wanted to drink some water.

1425
01:45:00,968 --> 01:45:02,636
Don't trouble yourself,
I'll do the needful.

1426
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:15,115
Quench your thirst.

1427
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:18,118
Drink it up, it will fill
your restless mind with peace.

1428
01:46:20,147 --> 01:46:21,148
Hey!

1429
01:46:21,915 --> 01:46:23,016
Open the cell.

1430
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:30,791
How dare you act smart!

1431
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:32,259
You'll get it from me.

1432
01:46:32,793 --> 01:46:34,628
What audacity!
Asking for trouble.

1433
01:46:34,695 --> 01:46:35,863
I'll smash your face.

1434
01:46:36,763 --> 01:46:38,065
What do you take me for?

1435
01:46:38,465 --> 01:46:39,633
Won't you pipe down?

1436
01:46:55,349 --> 01:46:56,383
I'll skin you alive.

1437
01:46:58,886 --> 01:46:59,820
Lock the door.

1438
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:04,958
Sir.

1439
01:47:10,664 --> 01:47:11,765
Goodnight.

1440
01:47:12,633 --> 01:47:13,967
Sir, sir.

1441
01:47:17,604 --> 01:47:18,639
Sir.

1442
01:47:21,808 --> 01:47:22,876
Here.

1443
01:47:31,518 --> 01:47:34,821
Don't smoke.

1444
01:47:34,888 --> 01:47:36,723
She will say my health will get spoilt.

1445
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:39,159
I don't know where she is now.

1446
01:47:39,226 --> 01:47:41,929
She must be safe somewhere.
She'll be back, don't worry.

1447
01:47:41,995 --> 01:47:44,364
Anbu's friend told me.

1448
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:47,968
She left work late because
I was not talking to her.

1449
01:47:49,336 --> 01:47:52,639
I could have just yelled at her and
not given her this silent treatment.

1450
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,275
Why even yell at her?

1451
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,511
All she did was
fall in love with this chap.

1452
01:47:58,612 --> 01:48:02,282
Why did I hold this silly ego
against my own daughter?

1453
01:48:05,853 --> 01:48:10,891
If she was in some trouble,
and she had called me.

1454
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:13,727
I didn't pick her call
and go to her rescue.

1455
01:48:18,866 --> 01:48:21,335
-You can go.
-Take the torch, Bro.

1456
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:27,574
Sir, it is too late for anyone
to hang around here.

1457
01:48:28,809 --> 01:48:30,944
Nagaraj, don't tell him anything.

1458
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:33,413
-Why?
-His daughter is missing from evening.

1459
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,382
He is very upset and distraught.

1460
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:37,818
Sir, where is your daughter
working in this mall?

1461
01:48:37,885 --> 01:48:38,886
Chicken Hub.

1462
01:48:38,952 --> 01:48:40,721
Do you have her photo on you?

1463
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:47,094
Did you look for her
in the usual places she visits?

1464
01:48:50,797 --> 01:48:52,399
As far as I know,

1465
01:48:52,733 --> 01:48:55,602
your daughter hasn't left this mall.

1466
01:49:10,117 --> 01:49:11,151
Hurry up.

1467
01:49:14,121 --> 01:49:14,955
Fast, fast.

1468
01:49:17,758 --> 01:49:18,892
Make it fast.

1469
01:49:51,959 --> 01:49:53,360
Give me the torch.

1470
01:49:55,796 --> 01:49:58,232
-Where's the key?
-Sir, the manager has it.

1471
01:49:58,332 --> 01:49:59,967
Go and get it from him.

1472
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:12,773
Hey?

1473
01:51:13,807 --> 01:51:15,709
-What are you doing here?
-What, sir?

1474
01:51:15,776 --> 01:51:17,244
What are you watching?

1475
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:18,846
-Give me your phone.
-Interview, sir.

1476
01:51:18,912 --> 01:51:21,648
[YouTube 'Live' Interview]

1477
01:51:21,715 --> 01:51:23,917
Switch it off.

1478
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:35,896
Anbu.

1479
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:37,798
Anbu.

1480
01:52:40,694 --> 01:52:41,862
Anbu.

1481
01:52:43,664 --> 01:52:44,698
Anbu!

1482
01:53:36,149 --> 01:53:38,318
Following your footsteps true

1483
01:53:38,385 --> 01:53:39,453
Dad!

1484
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:42,523
To walk along with you

1485
01:53:42,589 --> 01:53:48,529
Undoubtedly by your side
Delightedly my feet will stride

1486
01:53:51,965 --> 01:53:54,701
My childhood days

1487
01:53:54,768 --> 01:53:58,305
My love for you always

1488
01:53:58,372 --> 01:54:01,542
Will shuteye at ease

1489
01:54:01,608 --> 01:54:04,878
On your shoulder in peace

1490
01:54:07,748 --> 01:54:10,851
My eyes can close to eternal sleep

1491
01:54:10,918 --> 01:54:14,054
Mother Earth can bury me real deep

1492
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:17,224
Even then, my father dearest

1493
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:20,294
You are my unquenched quest

1494
01:54:23,597 --> 01:54:29,570
Hands we clasped for strength
Eyes exchanged our love's depth

1495
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:33,173
Such precious memories on earth

1496
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:36,877
Will gleam like gems in my breath

1497
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:45,285
To walk with head high by your side

1498
01:54:45,652 --> 01:54:49,089
Through thick and thin, high or low tide

1499
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:52,392
Always by your side

1500
01:55:32,733 --> 01:55:34,434
My dear daughter.

1501
01:55:35,936 --> 01:55:37,371
My dearest.

1502
01:55:40,073 --> 01:55:42,709
Anbu, Anbu.

1503
01:55:43,177 --> 01:55:44,211
Anbu.

1504
01:55:44,478 --> 01:55:46,413
Your father is here.
Look at me, dear.

1505
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,850
I didn't talk to her one day.
She has gone without talking to me.

1506
01:55:50,517 --> 01:55:52,286
Anbu...

1507
01:55:52,352 --> 01:55:53,720
No!

1508
01:56:05,165 --> 01:56:07,434
I'm your father here.

1509
01:56:18,212 --> 01:56:19,246
Dear.

1510
01:56:19,646 --> 01:56:20,747
My dear.

1511
01:56:21,515 --> 01:56:22,649
Dad.

1512
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:25,252
My daughter--

1513
01:56:28,755 --> 01:56:29,890
Lift her up.

1514
01:56:30,757 --> 01:56:31,925
Lift her.

1515
01:56:33,961 --> 01:56:35,395
Hurry, watch your step.

1516
01:57:10,831 --> 01:57:12,399
Rest up, dear.

1517
01:57:12,966 --> 01:57:14,134
Sleep for a while.

1518
01:57:17,004 --> 01:57:18,071
What happened?

1519
01:57:18,772 --> 01:57:20,507
Just a minor bike accident.

1520
01:57:21,108 --> 01:57:22,376
Didn't go to Hyderabad?

1521
01:57:22,976 --> 01:57:24,745
He didn't go for your sake.

1522
01:57:26,547 --> 01:57:27,981
When did this happen?

1523
01:57:29,249 --> 01:57:30,584
You are both friends now?

1524
01:57:34,354 --> 01:57:36,190
He isn't one of us, Dad.

1525
01:57:36,557 --> 01:57:37,391
Is it okay?

1526
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:39,092
No problem.

1527
01:57:45,065 --> 01:57:46,967
Did you think I'll die?

1528
01:57:47,734 --> 01:57:48,769
No!

1529
01:57:51,271 --> 01:57:54,174
I won't leave you
and go anywhere, Dad.

1530
01:57:55,108 --> 01:57:56,710
Not even Canada?

1531
01:58:00,113 --> 01:58:02,015
You won't change your mind?

1532
01:58:03,217 --> 01:58:04,051
Good.

1533
01:58:05,152 --> 01:58:06,987
Sir, you need to buy this medicine.

1534
01:58:07,921 --> 01:58:09,056
-Sir, I'll go.
-I'll go.

1535
01:58:11,124 --> 01:58:12,159
Go.

1536
01:58:14,161 --> 01:58:15,495
Diana?

1537
01:58:15,929 --> 01:58:17,197
Sir... uncle?

1538
01:58:18,732 --> 01:58:20,167
Isn't that your name?

1539
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:21,268
No.

1540
01:58:21,401 --> 01:58:22,569
Take good care of her.

1541
01:58:27,608 --> 01:58:29,309
Why didn't you
switch on the alarm?

1542
01:58:29,409 --> 01:58:30,677
I always do, sir.

1543
01:58:30,878 --> 01:58:32,279
My wife switches it off.

1544
01:58:32,346 --> 01:58:33,614
It's of no use, sir.

1545
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,250
Hey madcap! How does it matter
if it is of any use or not to you?

1546
01:58:36,316 --> 01:58:37,718
I didn't ask about your home matters..

1547
01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:39,453
I meant the safety alarm
in the freezer zone.

1548
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,522
It is under repair
I will rectify it soon, sir.

1549
01:58:41,588 --> 01:58:42,890
You and your spaced out face!

1550
01:58:43,757 --> 01:58:46,527
Sir, I got that girl's
last tower location.

1551
01:58:46,727 --> 01:58:48,662
Hang on that tower, jinx of a jerk!

1552
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:50,631
When did you send me that message?

1553
01:58:50,731 --> 01:58:53,267
I will first have your
suspension letter typed out.

1554
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:55,402
Sir, this is a hospital.

1555
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:57,671
Idiot, hang up now.

1556
01:59:09,883 --> 01:59:10,918
Sir?

1557
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:12,686
How is your daughter now?

1558
01:59:12,753 --> 01:59:14,688
She's fine now.
Nothing to worry.

1559
01:59:14,755 --> 01:59:15,722
I'm so glad to hear that.

1560
01:59:15,789 --> 01:59:18,125
Sir, I should be the one to thank you.

1561
01:59:18,192 --> 01:59:21,628
What made you think
my daughter didn't leave the mall?

1562
01:59:21,695 --> 01:59:24,665
I am in this same security job
for the past 30 years.

1563
01:59:24,765 --> 01:59:27,467
So many faces go past me daily.

1564
01:59:27,534 --> 01:59:30,204
Not one of them will look me in the eye.

1565
01:59:30,504 --> 01:59:32,573
Like a society of hunchbacks

1566
01:59:32,706 --> 01:59:35,709
everyone will be bending over
their mobiles and walk past me.

1567
01:59:36,743 --> 01:59:40,814
But only your daughter will look up
and flash her sweet smile at me.

1568
01:59:55,996 --> 01:59:58,799
Last night I didn't see that smile.

1569
01:59:59,733 --> 02:00:01,635
When none of the faces
acknowledge a person

1570
02:00:02,169 --> 02:00:03,871
when one face looks him in the eye,

1571
02:00:04,304 --> 02:00:06,073
how can that face be forgotten, sir?

1572
02:00:06,173 --> 02:00:09,309
Not to walk with their eyes
buried into their mobile,

1573
02:00:09,676 --> 02:00:11,745
we should teach people
to make direct eye contact.

1574
02:00:11,845 --> 02:00:16,016
To survive here most people assume
food and water will suffice.

1575
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:19,086
A little bit of love is needed
to nourish us, sir.

1576
02:00:19,152 --> 02:00:20,554
It's time for my duty.
Let me go, sir.

1577
02:00:22,856 --> 02:00:24,157
I forgot to ask you.

1578
02:00:24,525 --> 02:00:25,826
What is your daughter's name?

1579
02:00:28,195 --> 02:00:32,466
ANBIRKINIYAL

1580
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:48,849
The way she views life daily

1581
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:52,252
Celebrating every moment truly

1582
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:55,155
She seizes every moment of her life

1583
02:00:55,222 --> 02:00:58,659
Lives it to the fullest without any strife

1584
02:00:58,725 --> 02:01:03,363
You take life easy duly
On your shoulders daily

1585
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:07,034
You are a firefly
In the sky flying high

1586
02:01:07,134 --> 02:01:11,705
Like a world by yourself anew

1587
02:01:11,772 --> 02:01:16,844
On the grass you're a drop of fresh dew

1588
02:02:11,865 --> 02:02:14,768
Be positive is your motto

1589
02:02:14,835 --> 02:02:18,272
Yesterday, today and tomorrow

1590
02:02:18,672 --> 02:02:21,742
Just one look at her, you will see

1591
02:02:21,808 --> 02:02:25,078
Customers flip for her nice and easy

1592
02:02:25,145 --> 02:02:31,118
She gives it her all at work so sincere
Rest assured spring season is here

1593
02:02:31,785 --> 02:02:34,922
With vivid colors so bright

1594
02:02:34,988 --> 02:02:38,592
Won't it be a lifetime of delight?
