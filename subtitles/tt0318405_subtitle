Who prepares the food here?

15
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:44,002
I instructed the cook.

16
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,548
What will you do there?

17
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,668
No one will dance
with you, I don't like it.

18
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,083
I just want to see the play.

19
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:53,418
Do you think
dancing is a circus?

20
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,210
what's the difference

21
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,463
Animals are the ones who jump in a circus.

22
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,715
Girls and boys do
that at the dance.

23
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:01,960
OK, Sonia?

24
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:10,918
Welcome!

25
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,335
- Good morning to you, sir.
- Good Morning.

26
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,418
Yes... what should happen?

27
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,875
Show me this coat.

28
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,423
This...?

29
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,043
This is not good.
I will show you a beautiful one.

30
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:28,882
How much will this be?

31
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,715
The wearer adds value to it.

32
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:32,673
How much is the price?

33
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,422
300 rupees only.

34
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,673
Uncle, I want to
buy this sweater.

36
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:46,178
Sonia, you have
several of these at home.

37
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,298
Madam, this is 40 rupees.

38
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:49,965
Only 40.

39
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,257
Why waste 40 rupees?

40
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:53,798
here

41
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,090
Sonia take some
fruits and come home.

42
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,007
be careful  Yesterday too,
you had bought rotten fruits.

43
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,048
I don't talk much.

44
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,798
But Sonia is my late
brother's daughter.

45
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:35,340
His mother is also dead.

46
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,632
He gets angry even for small things.

47
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,345
I take care of her day and night.

48
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:41,257
She sleeps quietly at night.

49
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:43,382
Take care of her during the day.

50
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,887
What else can I do?

51
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,413
She eats and dresses as she pleases.

52
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,012
Our employees do the same.

53
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,220
Remember, she is
one of us, not a servant.

54
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,012
If she is good, I can help.

55
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,132
A happy person is beautiful.

56
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,840
If you love her, you
will find her beautiful.

57
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,090
Shall I ask Sheila or you?

58
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,048
You ask her.

59
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:08,215
I will call if necessary.

60
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,340
Marriage is a sensitive topic.

61
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,090
Did you ask me to come?

62
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,095
Yes, daughter.  Your
father wants to talk to you.

63
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,215
say

64
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,632
Talking about Dev.

65
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,648
Is he just one of
your many friends?

66
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,632
Or are you interested in him?

67
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,590
What does it mean?

68
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,590
He means, about love.

69
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:37,298
Love is outdated, mom.

70
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,590
Important these days...

71
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,590
...getting what you want.

72
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,590
Is he trying to get you?

73
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:48,632
- Are you interested too?
- Yes.

74
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:49,845
what does he do?

75
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,007
Why does a rich person work?

76
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,845
He is young, rich and handsome.

77
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,762
Along with all these things intelligence...

78
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,715
Then everything is given.

79
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:02,505
It could be.

There are many such young people.

91
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:12,465
- A husband should have one quality.
- I understand that.

92
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,762
He earns 0.2 million per year.

93
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,840

00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,715

I warned you.

No one came to dance.

137
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:52,385
I will ask Kapoor.

138
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,757
I don't want to dance.

139
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,132
Listen to this!

140
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:56,882
Don't bother her.

141
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,590
Not everyone is beautiful.

142
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,673
Sonia, where's the coffee?

143
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:29,965
I can't believe Sonia
and Sheela are cousins.

144
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,385
They are different.

145
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,382
Sonia's mother and
I are not the same.

146
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:39,137
She is ugly like Sonia.

147
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:42,715
No wonder her father remarried.

148
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:46,382
Tell us about uncle's second wife.

149
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:48,928
Mom, you said he
was very beautiful.

150
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,345
Yes, she is beautiful just like you.

151
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,090
same as you.

152
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,673
Unfortunately, they
died in a car accident.

153
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,505
What happened to Sonia's mother?

154
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:02,422
She died of heart disease.

155
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,965
- Bahadur.
- Yes?

156
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:28,882
- Give them coffee.
- Okay.

157
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,840
There is no point in talking about the dead.

158
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,220
Sheela, have you told Dev
that you don't like children?

159
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
I'll tell him later.

160
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,505
He might not like it.

161
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:57,678
We live in modern times, Grandma.

162
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,715
Children have no place in the modern world.

163
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:05,298
If that's true, Grandma,
we're not alive.

164
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,840
Who asked for your opinion?

165
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,715
Is there no such place in the modern world?

166
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,422
How good life is without
two or three children.

167
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:16,215
You may even have a dozen children.

168
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,882
may be

169
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,048
I will be happy if I do.

170
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,137
Be humble, Sonia.

171
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:25,548
Every girl dreams of
motherhood, Sheila,

172
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,928
Will the husband be happy or will
he remarry, and eventually kill her?

173
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,840
To die like that, you
have to marry a man.

174
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,445
Do you think I
won't get someone?

175
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,553
I didn't say that.

176
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:41,215
But you mean, why
can't I get a man?

177
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,007
What am I lacking?

178
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:44,548
I can take 10 men.

179
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,340
Are you missing something, Sonya?

180
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,090
i have

181
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:55,422
Everyone blames me, not her.

182
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,882
I don't argue with her, but
she keeps fighting with me.

183
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,132
Tell me, what am I lacking?

184
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,257
What do you have that I don't?

185
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,423
Why can't you find
a match like Dev?

186
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,340
I will find someone
better than Dev.

187
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,840
Really?

188
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,340
Sheila, this is a matter of choice.

189
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:19,007
You need an appreciator
of beauty, I need true love.

190
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,173
Unfortunately,

191
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:25,422
True love also seeks
physical beauty.

192
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:31,132
Charm and kindness.
You have none of them.

193
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,632
I will make them.

194
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:39,548
- How is that?
- Anyway.

195
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,132
Tell us your plan.

196
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,423
I am.

197
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,082
I serve him with all my heart.

198
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,132
I cook him good food.

199
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,090
I fulfill all his needs.

200
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,965
I am waiting for him all day.

201
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:55,453
At night...

202
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:04,340
I massage her legs
and make her sleep.

203
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:08,840
To do these, you
must first find someone.

204
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,505
You don't have to worry about it.

205
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:13,798
Think about yourself.

206
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:17,007
Who wants to marry...

207
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,215
...a girl who dances
with boys in clubs?

208
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,382
Don't overstep your bounds, Sonia.

209
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,382
Now you see how
innocent you are.

210
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:31,673
People will sympathize with you because of Amma.

211
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:35,548
People will hate
you when you talk.

212
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:39,632
Your presence will take people's breath away.

213
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:44,720
I have no choice
but to say this.

214
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,262
You are too stupid and
ugly for any man to...

215
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:50,007
...can't be together, no
one will come to marry you.

216
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:05,548
Sheila, you shouldn't
say them to her face.

217
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,632
I can be stubborn and ugly.

218
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,007
But I won't hurt anyone.

219
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:33,298
Sheela, if you do this to
me, I will make God mine.

220
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,840
Dev...?  you are dreaming

221
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:41,215
Laugh as much as you want.

222
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,923
Laugh until your stomach hurts.

223
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:54,215
Until you cry and
beg me to leave God...

224
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:59,422
...I won't let him near you.

225
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,007
Shut up, Sonya.

226
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,590
To Sheila, you say nothing.

227
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,715
blame me

228
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:16,840
I want to apologize to Sheila.

229
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:18,465
No.

230
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,298
Go to your room.

231
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:21,595
No.

232
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:22,798
I said, go.

233
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,340
No.

234
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:29,298
Good.

235
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:33,465
You are too good.

236
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:36,382
A general like you in India...

237
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,173
...or never been in Britain.

238
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,863
Mr. Dev Mehra has arrived.

239
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,363
Sonia, stop crying.

240
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,280
listen

241
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,113
Mr. Dev Mehra.

242
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:57,322
- Hello, Dev.
- Hello, Sheila.

243
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:00,488
Come, I will introduce
you to everyone.

244
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,113
This is my dear daughter Sheila.

245
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,905
And this is my husband.

246
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,155
Yes, that's right.

247
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,697
Look closely and you
will see what is on him.

248
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:15,738
Grandma is joking.

249
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,822
There is no one to know.

250
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:19,197
Hands up!

251
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,447
Ravi, why this?

252
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:26,072
He is a child.

253
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:28,447
Dev, sit down.

254
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,482
Tell us...

255
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,613
Ms. Sonia, I need some help.

256
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,535
Sonia, see what he wants.

257
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:38,988
That's your business, aunty.

258
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:40,655
I remember God...

259
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,447
What did you say Sonia?

260
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:50,573
I mean you rule the
kitchen, so you should go.

261
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,697
Dev, I will prepare food.

262
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:58,447
A woman never rests.

263
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,653
Bahadur, show her to the kitchen.

264
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,988
She hasn't been there in 20 years.

265
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:15,613
Sonia, please check that
the guest room is ready.

266
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,660
Take Dev's luggage there.

267
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,947
Uncle, that's a man's job.

268
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,530
You do it.

269
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:28,238
you are right.

270
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
You are right my girl.

271
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,822
- Would you like a cold drink?
- all right.

272
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:38,905
- Sonia, bring a lemon drink.
- Sorry, Dev.

273
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:45,155
Sonia be careful.
You are off to a great start.

274
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:11,280
Do you smoke?

275
00:24:11,863 --> 00:24:13,280
No, thank you.

276
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,447
Why are you standing?
please sit down.

277
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,697
You seem upset.

278
00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:20,573
No, I...

279
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,780
Sit comfortably.

280
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,322
I'm fine...

281
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,072
just wait.

282
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:36,738
Good.

283
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:39,905
Do you want anything else?

284
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:42,613
I want to wash my face.

285
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,947
ok

286
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:47,573
Why shy?  Come on.

287
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:51,363
You don't have to come.
show me my room

288
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:56,405
You are our guest, come.

289
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,780
stupid girl

290
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,170
Here!

291
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:18,822
You whistle well.

292
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,988
- Do you whistle too?
- I am...?

293
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,447
Yes, I will too.

294
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,113
Try with me.

295
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,655
No, like this.

296
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,653
Keep trying.
I will wash my face.

297
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:00,613
Try and you will learn.

298
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,655
Awesome!

299
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,653
You whistled well.

300
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:37,322
I thought it was you.

301
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,197
That was Sheila's whistle.

302
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,322
She will teach you.

303
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:49,947
It's a beautiful thing.

304
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,573
When it comes to love, it comes in handy.

305
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,488
Sheila and I
communicate by whistling…

306
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,155
When we are surrounded by people.

307
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,238
why so?

308
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,155
I will tell you a secret.

309
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,030
Listen!

310
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,988
You know what I said?

311
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:16,363
I said I love her.

312
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:27,905
did you hear that  She
said I was attractive.

313
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,738
Boys in our college are
dying to see Sheela's smile.

314
00:27:33,815 --> 00:27:35,363
But she loved me too.

315
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,822
I feel like a king,

316
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:40,530
like a king

317
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:50,322
What did you say now?

318
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:54,613
I said she was the most
beautiful person in the world.

319
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:01,988
What did she say?

320
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,280
She said I was lying.

321
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:14,405
What does that mean?

322
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,197
I said, I want to be with her.

323
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,447
That means both of you are crazy.

324
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,573
This means that love is useless.

325
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:39,363
This means going to hell.

Nobody likes me.

363
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,155
I'm not good at anything.

364
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,905
I'm a fool.

365
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,653

Why would anyone like me?

370
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,988
What am I missing from Grandma?

371
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:06,780
You have some flaws.

372
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:10,155
You need to change from head to toe.

373
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:13,197
come here

374
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,030
Why do you wear glasses?

375
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,905
To get rid of headache.

376
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,322
If you wear these, no
man will look at you.

377
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:30,780
be new

378
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,307
why did you cut my hair

379
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:42,932
Nowadays, men don't
like women with long hair.

380
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:44,598
why so?

381
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:47,638
Men do different
hairstyles by themselves.

382
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:50,265
Therefore, they do not like long hair.

383
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,807
As the song goes...

384
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,265
"Your handsome face..."

385
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:58,182
"Stirring Girls' Hearts"

386
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,265
Grind some curry.

387
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:03,015
- Grandma.
- hurry up.

388
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:13,973
Wear some shades.

389
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,558
"Hearts are attracted to the
beauty of a mother's eyes"

390
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:29,223
Apply lipstick...

391
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,973
To win hearts.

392
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,640
Change your clothes.

393
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:41,558
Someone is sure to
lose a heart tonight.

394
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,890
Look at me, you walk beautifully.

395
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:52,140
Try walking like you're drunk.

396
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:53,973
look at me

397
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:56,265
Hold the saree like this.

398
00:35:58,015 --> 00:35:59,432
Walk like this.

399
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:06,645
Yes, when you swing…

400
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,723
...the world will go mad.

401
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,603
- Can you dance?
- a little.

402
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,307
That doesn't work.

403
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:17,103
- Think I am Dev.
- I am...?

404
00:36:17,223 --> 00:36:18,640
be yourself.

405
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,473
dance with me now

406
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,638
you come...

407
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,348
Look casually at the floor.

408
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,558
smile

409
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:32,638
Yes.

410
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,598
Close your eyes.

411
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:44,223
Show that you are trying hard…

412
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:46,765
...to control yourself.

413
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,432
Open your eyes and look at him.

414
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,640
A bit scared...

415
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:28,973
Look at the floor.

416
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:35,558
These are gestures that hypnotize men.

417
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:40,473
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:45,140
Time to start the dance competition.

419
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,890
Trust me, in a race…

420
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,515
There is no certainty.

421
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,473
Anyone can be a winner.

422
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:01,440
You could be the winner.

423
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,640
You could be the winner.

424
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:27,057
Contestants please…

425
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,732
Sheila, will I enjoy this dance?

426
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:46,265
May I Mrs. Sheela...?

427
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:48,515
I'm sorry Dev.

428
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,223
This is a competition, he is a champion of Calcutta.

429
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,432
Champion of Bombay.

430
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,432
why don't you dance with me

431
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:05,395
I will come when you learn to dance.

432
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:06,723
may i mrs sheila

433
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,682
Dev, this is the champion of Madras.

434
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:17,265
why...?

435
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:22,098
- Do you fly kites?
- Yes.

436
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:27,307
You lost your kite.

437
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:31,682
When you lose a kite,
you fly another one.

438
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,287
I will dance with you.

439
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:36,973
- Oh no.  I can not dance.
- I can't either.

440
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,390
These are champions from Timbuktu.

441
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,890
"Who has rosy cheeks
and enchanting eyes?"

442
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:08,478
"Who has black hair
on a night like this?"

443
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,395
"Who is that?"

444
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:11,348
"Shakeela"

445
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:16,390
"Who has rosy cheeks
and enchanting eyes?"

446
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:31,062
"Who has long arms
and hypnotic eyes?"

447
00:41:31,182 --> 00:41:35,562
"Whose beauty do the
winds and the moon envy?"

448
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,395
- "Who is that?"
- Jamila"

449
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:43,348
"Who has long arms and hypnotic eyes?"

450
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:58,187
"Who speaks sweet words
and destroys with her glance?"

451
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:02,687
"Whose beauty hypnotizes men?"

452
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,615
"Who is that?"

453
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:10,848
"Who speaks sweet words
and destroys with her glance?"

454
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:25,395
"Who's got the shiny, pretty one?"

455
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:29,937
"Who catches
everyone's eye in Shimla?"

456
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:32,728
- "Who is that?"
- "Sheila"

457
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:37,603
"Who's got the shiny, pretty one?"

458
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:42,438
"Who has rosy cheeks, captivating
eyes, long arms, and a hypnotic look?"

459
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:46,880
"Who has a shining,
shining beauty? Who is it?"

460
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:49,293
"Sonia"

461
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,620
- Greetings, champion of Timbuktu.
- Thank you.

462
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,662
Good luck, Shimla champion.

463
00:44:16,038 --> 00:44:18,870
Dev, I wish I danced with you.

464
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:22,412
The past is the past.

465
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,912
I would have done
anything for you.

466
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,870
You danced well.

467
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,937
You care about
rock and roll dancing.

468
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:31,918
of course.  It's an art.

469
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:33,245
It's a great art.

470
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:36,038
A European dancer went mad.

471
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,578
He was frantically rolling stones.

472
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,038
This dance art is named
as rock n roll for him.

473
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:49,953
What are your plans for tomorrow?

474
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,078
I am your guest.  You plan.

475
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,995
Let's go for a walk in the morning.

476
00:44:57,263 --> 00:45:00,537
Shimla is like paradise in the morning.

477
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:04,828
It's like angels come to
live here during that time.

478
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:09,287
Snow-capped
mountains kiss the clouds.

479
00:45:09,578 --> 00:45:13,620
Like bees kissing flowers.

480
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:42,495
Grandma, what are those mixed pills?

481
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,662
I am old.

482
00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:48,787
I can't sleep without them.

483
00:45:49,537 --> 00:45:51,620
- Are these sleeping pills?
- Yes.

484
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:54,620
Mrs. Sonia drink milk.

485
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,953
- Bahadur, I will give milk to Sheila.
- Okay.

486
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,620
You don't seem to get angry like you used to.

487
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,708
Mrs. Sonia is nervous.

488
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,328
This is none of your business.  Go.

489
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:12,745
Grandma, you have
something on your face.

490
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,370
- Really?
- I'll remove it.

491
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:20,537
- Where is that thing?
- I threw it.

492
00:46:21,118 --> 00:46:22,745
drink milk

493
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,038
bless you.

494
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,523
Not drinking milk on time is a bad thing.

495
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:41,787
Our ancestors said that hot...

496
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:45,318
...that milk should be offered with love.

497
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:47,162
You look happy Sonia.

498
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:51,162
Life is too short to fight.

499
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,870
I have understood...

500
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:56,412
...serving people is a great blessing.

501
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,203
When you drink milk...

502
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:09,162
...I feel happy.

503
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:16,078
sleep princess

504
00:47:17,118 --> 00:47:20,495
Simla's charm lies in sleep.

505
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:36,078
He must have been waiting there alone.

506
00:47:36,383 --> 00:47:38,875
ok grandma  I will
give him an excuse.

507
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:41,328
Don't go alone.  Take Ravi with you.

508
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:43,078
Raise the count at first.

509
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:44,708
Count up...?

510
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,250
Beauty, dress less…

511
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,328
As millions of jewels
and billions of conduct.

512
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:52,453
grandma

513
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:12,037
It is wrong.

514
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,538
Try again.

515
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,453
- Urdu is difficult.
- No.

516
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,578
How do you know?
I tried for 7 days.

517
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,745
How many years did you study?

518
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,828
I learn in days, not years.

519
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:32,292
The neighbor will
sing and teach us.

520
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,500
I do not believe in that.

521
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,953
Can't sing in Urdu.

522
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:37,578
If I teach you...?

523
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,912
tell grandma

524
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,620
So listen, grandpa.

525
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,750
"I do not know"

526
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:07,458
"I do not know"

527
00:52:07,578 --> 00:52:08,995
where are you going

528
00:52:09,245 --> 00:52:13,828
I'm going for a walk.
Simla is like a paradise.

529
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:16,828
Sometimes angels come here.

530
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:21,903
Snow-capped
mountains kiss the clouds.

531
00:52:22,162 --> 00:52:26,703
Like bees kissing flowers.

532
00:52:28,662 --> 00:52:31,203
I planned to see paradise.

533
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:35,203
But your dear Sheela is sleeping.

534
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,433
She wakes up late
after lunch time.

535
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:39,495
- Really?
- You think I'm lying.

536
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:43,538
You will grow old waiting for her.

537
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:47,495
You are already old.

538
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,917
Hello, young man.

539
00:52:50,037 --> 00:52:52,120
Sorry, old man.  No luck.

540
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:54,578
I tried to wake up Sheela
but she didn't wake up.

541
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,995
I'm coming to go with you.

542
00:52:57,115 --> 00:53:01,262
I danced with you last night.
Do not try again.

543
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:03,995
Are you going alone?

544
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,037
I like to walk alone.

545
00:53:06,162 --> 00:53:09,328
Trust me, I'm a good friend.

546
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:13,042
But only if you do as I say.

547
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:15,538
I will die if you ask.

548
00:53:16,703 --> 00:53:19,203
Don't make claims.

549
00:53:19,703 --> 00:53:21,287
ok come on

550
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,287
wait a minute

551
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:54,500
Look at that mountain.

552
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,120
Sheila's friends
tried to cross it.

553
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,328
But it didn't work.

554
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,870
Big deal, it's easy.

555
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:05,287
to run

556
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:08,745
amazing

557
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:11,787
to run

558
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:15,120
hurry up!

559
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:22,620
Well done, Dev.

560
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,328
come down.

561
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,500
- Come on.
- How is that?

562
00:54:31,678 --> 00:54:33,078
Did I ask you to climb up?

563
00:54:33,293 --> 00:54:36,020
You made me want to climb.

564
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,345
Now you deny it.

565
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:40,890
I'll show you what I can.

566
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,120
Dev.

567
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,453
Did you remember something?

568
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:14,078
I will consider you brave.

569
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,578
Should I ride a
horse without gear?

570
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,662
I admit you are brave.

571
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:16,287
If you make such
demands again, I will die.

572
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:20,787
My bones will crack.

573
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:38,453
why...?

574
00:56:40,953 --> 00:56:43,370
I can't jump from here.
I am not brave.

575
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,828
Listen!
Look at that man marching.

576
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:51,245
I can see his rifle gleaming.

577
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:52,412
Yes.

578
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,495
I don't see him.

579
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,538
I can't kill him.

580
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:01,995
- really?
- Yes.

581
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:06,495
This is not a big deal.

582
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,620
- I like his helmet.
- Okay.

583
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:12,537
It is an easy task.

584
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:16,078
Sneak up behind him.

585
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:20,703
Take his helmet and run.

586
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,287
Do that.

587
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:25,703
I will go to jail.

588
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:28,245
- You won't get caught.
- Really?

589
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:32,203
He is not a protector.  He is crazy.

590
00:57:32,412 --> 00:57:33,745
How did he get a rifle?

591
00:57:33,865 --> 00:57:36,328
Don't you understand it?
It's a fake rifle.

592
00:57:36,593 --> 00:57:37,703
I am not going.

593
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:40,162
I don't get that helmet?

594
00:57:40,328 --> 00:57:41,787
- No?
- No.

595
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,333
- No?
- No.

596
00:57:43,453 --> 00:57:45,745
- No?
- No.

597
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:48,870
to run

598
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:37,495
How stupid of me.

599
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:41,245
To do everything you say.

600
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:43,412
What do you think?

601
00:59:46,325 --> 00:59:48,162
I think you are very brave.

602
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:50,370
you are very good

603
00:59:51,203 --> 00:59:54,245
My late grandfather used to say...

604
00:59:54,745 --> 00:59:58,537
The work done with love will stop.

605
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,953
Women in love like silly things.

606
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:05,662
Chirping like a bird...

607
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:08,953
Be upside down, run like crazy

608
01:00:09,287 --> 01:00:10,412
Do as you like.

609
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:13,912
You will be lost the moment
you speak sensitively.

610
01:00:16,038 --> 01:00:17,287
It is indeed true.

611
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,328
I don't understand
the purpose of life.

612
01:00:28,203 --> 01:00:31,578
No food, too many bad habits.

613
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:35,912
My father says,
cooking with love...

614
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,953
...never eat if not accepted.

615
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,287
You keep giving examples.

616
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:43,245
Don't you have anything else to say?

617
01:00:43,578 --> 01:00:45,245
They have pampered me.

618
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:49,328
My grandfather used to say
that only women cook well.

619
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:55,120
You want me to cook, don't you?

620
01:00:55,328 --> 01:00:58,995
You will be blessed.

621
01:00:59,328 --> 01:01:01,620
ok i will cook

622
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:05,287
Mom, I eat from the plate.

623
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,745
Why did you remember your mother?

624
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:11,412
Now that's the way it was spoken.

625
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:14,120
That's how mom talks to dad.

626
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,118
Ma'am, Dev has come.

627
01:01:27,703 --> 01:01:30,120
- Good morning, Sheila.
- Good morning, Dev.

628
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:31,537
I am sorry,

629
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:34,828
I slept, you must be lonely.

630
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,453
No problem.  I was not alone.

631
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:39,038
Who was with you?

632
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:43,245
I walked thinking about you.

633
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:44,703
get ready

634
01:01:44,823 --> 01:01:48,162
I am preparing lunch for
the Miss Shimla pageant.

635
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:50,703
Making me lunch.

636
01:01:51,018 --> 01:01:54,495
Who cooks that?

637
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:57,703
He asked me lovingly.

638
01:01:57,963 --> 01:02:00,453
I agreed.  He asked
what I would like to eat.

639
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,453
I said the things I liked.

640
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:05,828
How can I break
his heart and eat?

641
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,870
You don't care about my feelings.

642
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:12,118
I can always cook for you.

643
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,787
God will dwell in the
hearts of the poor.

644
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:17,328
How can I break the heart of that poor person?

645
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,870
- Bahadur.
- Yes?

646
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:22,453
I fire him immediately.

647
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:25,003
- How does he do that?
- No, Sheila.

648
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:27,850
Don't interfere.  Employees
need to know where they stand.

649
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,118
OK, I'll come with you.

650
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,583
Don't blame him.

651
01:02:31,703 --> 01:02:32,787
you can go

652
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:37,203
Look at yourself in the mirror.

653
01:02:39,662 --> 01:02:43,787
Dev, look at yourself before marriage.

654
01:02:43,912 --> 01:02:46,120
What happens after marriage?

655
01:02:48,713 --> 01:02:52,500
You don't do anything.
i will cook

656
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,662
ok ma'am

657
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:58,162
Why cut the meat like that?

658
01:02:58,832 --> 01:02:59,870
Crush it finely.

659
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:07,287
Who told you to make bread?
Let's make 'Puri'.

660
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,620
No vegetables?

661
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:13,453
Get some more.

662
01:03:14,095 --> 01:03:17,370
- What's for dessert?
- Vermicelli.

663
01:03:18,038 --> 01:03:19,370
- Only vermicelli?
- Yes.

664
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,162
- Get some cream.
- other than that...?

665
01:03:23,072 --> 01:03:24,245
you go.

666
01:03:38,905 --> 01:03:42,370
You fry the 'puri'.
I will set the table.

667
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:44,328
Yes, Bahadur?

668
01:03:44,448 --> 01:03:46,453
Everyone goes out for lunch.

669
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:47,995
Who is everyone?

670
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,703
My uncle and aunt are going.

671
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,953
Is Dev going?

672
01:04:02,073 --> 01:04:03,412
Yes.

673
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,578
- How do you know?
- Ms. Sheila told me.

674
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,703
- Did she say?
- Yes.

675
01:04:17,398 --> 01:04:20,595
ladies and gentlemen.

676
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,108
We gathered here...

677
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:27,692
...to celebrate the Silver Jubilee.

678
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:29,900
In the Miss Shimla competition.

679
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:34,858
By the grace of God...

680
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:40,483
I have been the chairman of
this committee for 25 years.

681
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:44,418
We held this
competition every year.

682
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,670
Although there are wars all over the world...

683
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,628
This beauty pageant…

684
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:55,335
It was celebrated every year.

685
01:04:56,908 --> 01:05:02,045
This year on Hindustan Radio...

686
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:07,045
A tape recorder...

687
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,585
...and a 3 year movie contract...

688
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,837
...presented as prizes
from Filmlaya, Bombay.

689
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:20,003
I will now explain the rules.

690
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:23,753
First rule.

691
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:29,710
No contestant should
be below 17 years of age.

692
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:33,920
She should not be less than 17.

693
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:39,335
And should not be more than 25 years of age.

694
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:46,253
Hello!

695
01:05:48,628 --> 01:05:50,878
Mr. Dev Kumar Mehra.

696
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:53,753
You have a call.

697
01:05:54,523 --> 01:05:55,878
Sorry!

698
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,920
- Sorry for the trouble, sir.
- No.

699
01:06:01,018 --> 01:06:02,503
Hello, this is Dev speaking.

700
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:05,378
You are shameless.

701
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,295
Made me cook, you disappeared.

702
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:10,585
Yes, I suddenly came to Shimla.

703
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:12,628
I couldn't inform you.

704
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,920
I am Major General Rajpal Singh.

705
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:17,460
Come anytime.

706
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:22,670
What are you saying, are you crazy?

707
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:24,962
No, we haven't eaten yet.

708
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:27,418
I thought you were a gentleman.

709
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:29,335
You're right, see you later.

710
01:06:37,582 --> 01:06:40,295
I will repeat the rule.

711
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:46,508
No candidate...

712
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:50,128
Must not be under 17 years of age.

713
01:06:50,503 --> 01:06:54,545
And should not be more than 25 years of age.

714
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,628
Mr. Dev Kumar Mehra.

715
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,003
Another call for you.

716
01:07:12,253 --> 01:07:13,335
I'm very sorry.

717
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:17,253
I'm sorry, sir.

718
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:18,920
Yes...

719
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,837
Hello, this is Dev speaking.

720
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:24,212
You are a scumbag.

721
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,068
you are right.

722
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,545
you are a fool  A useless man.

723
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:31,253
We are not just sitting around.
There is work to do.

724
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,045
sorry sir

725
01:07:39,795 --> 01:07:43,170
I repeat the rule
for the third time.

726
01:07:44,753 --> 01:07:50,003
No candidate...

727
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:53,253
Must not be under 17 years of age.

728
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:57,962
And should not be more than 25 years of age.

729
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,170
and...

730
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:10,628
- Mr. Dev Mehra.
- I am very sorry, sir.

731
01:08:10,748 --> 01:08:14,628
This is not a Shimla
beauty pageant.

732
01:08:15,017 --> 01:08:18,460
All India Telephone Contest.

733
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,212
I am very sorry sir.

734
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,460
sorry sir

735
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:24,418
hello

736
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:27,418
Salam Sheikh Bukhara!

737
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,670
A princess wants to attend.

738
01:08:32,128 --> 01:08:33,418
Really?

739
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:43,710
A gentleman's daughter
from Madras is also interested.

740
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,378
what?

741
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:50,128
Welcome.  how are you

742
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,003
No problem.

743
01:08:53,878 --> 01:08:57,128
A daughter of a land owner in
Calcutta also wanted to participate.

744
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,878
- Put down the phone.
- what?

745
01:09:01,253 --> 01:09:03,045
Put it down.

746
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:04,827
stay here

747
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,253
- It will ring again.
- No.

748
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,335
- Yes.
- Okay.

749
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:14,335
I will repeat the rule.

750
01:09:20,545 --> 01:09:22,253
- Welcome.
- No.

751
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,193
Yes.

752
01:09:27,878 --> 01:09:32,460
I asked for tomato soup,
this was chicken soup.

753
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,628
- Let's exchange this.
- Okay.

754
01:09:37,295 --> 01:09:38,295
oh

755
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,753
I'll go and get
changed.  I'm very sorry.

756
01:09:44,128 --> 01:09:45,878
sorry sir  I am very sorry.

757
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:03,418
Women work hard
to cook good food.

758
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:06,425
That food makes someone happy

759
01:10:06,545 --> 01:10:08,805
They feel happy when they eat

760
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:11,128
It will be praised.

761
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,003
Grandma says, a man's

762
01:10:14,123 --> 01:10:17,253
To win the heart...

763
01:10:18,878 --> 01:10:20,933
Cook delicious food for him.

764
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,837
Feed him with love.

765
01:10:26,545 --> 01:10:28,548
Eat Kebab, Dev.

766
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:39,545
Dev, do you like them?

767
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:47,128
Don't thank me.
These are just for you.

768
01:10:47,795 --> 01:10:49,837
Puri, take some.

769
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:57,378
Are they hot?

770
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:00,045
Eat slowly Dev.

771
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:06,418
don't bark  Eat slowly.

772
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:12,523
Eat some flavored yogurt.

773
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,545
You will like it.

774
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:27,003
Are they tough?  Wait, I'll get water.

775
01:11:33,503 --> 01:11:36,087
You drink in a special container.

776
01:11:49,048 --> 01:11:51,378
- Where do you take the food?
- Eat me.

777
01:11:51,503 --> 01:11:53,253
- All this alone?
- Yes.

778
01:11:53,853 --> 01:11:54,878
Your guest...?

779
01:11:55,525 --> 01:11:56,710
He is a fraud.

780
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,003
He broke his promise.

781
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:00,585
Sheela got angry.

782
01:12:00,705 --> 01:12:03,753
I tried to explain
to her but failed.

783
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:07,753
Did Sheila cuddle you like a baby?

784
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:19,250
- "Hey baby.
- My love"

785
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:22,538
- "Hey baby.
- My love"

786
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,460
- "Come here.
- Here I am."

787
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,125
- "Turn around.

01:12:28,122 --> 01:12:32,375

01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:44,692
- "Do you agree?

795
01:12:44,812 --> 01:12:49,085
- "What do you eat?

796
01:12:49,205 --> 01:12:51,413
"Hey baby.

797
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:06,748
"Darling, look at the beautiful weather"

798
01:13:06,868 --> 01:13:11,710
"Darling, look at the beautiful weather"

799
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:17,050
"This spectacular beauty
cannot quench my hunger"

800
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:22,125
"This spectacular beauty
cannot quench my hunger"

801
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:24,335
- "Come here.

802
01:13:24,455 --> 01:13:26,125

"hey baby"

806
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,425
"Hear the Bird Sing"

807
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:58,633
"Hear the Bird Sing"

808
01:13:59,038 --> 01:14:04,198
"I'm sure he's
hungry or thirsty."

809
01:14:04,318 --> 01:14:08,995
"I'm sure he's
hungry or thirsty."

810
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,328
- "Come here.
- Here I am."

811
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,038
- "Hang in there.
- OK"

812
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,808
- "Bows.

813
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:19,085
- "What do you eat?

814
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,328

815
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:36,765
"I, Your Guest"

"I, Your Guest"

817
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:47,005
"Thank you for the mercy"

818
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:52,022
"Thank you for the mercy"

819
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:54,293
- "Come here.
- I'm not coming"

820
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:56,122
- "Turn back.

821
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:57,747
- "Do you agree?
- No"

822
01:14:57,867 --> 01:14:59,913
"Are you hungry?"

823
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,705
'Get something.  hey baby"

824
01:15:14,913 --> 01:15:20,000
"I beg you, don't be angry."

825
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,783
"I beg you, don't be angry."

826
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:30,200
"Come here I will punish you"

827
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,293
"Come here I will punish you"

828
01:15:35,413 --> 01:15:37,495
- "Come here.
- Here I am."

829
01:15:37,615 --> 01:15:39,125
- "Sit down.
- OK"

830
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:41,002
- "Do you agree?
- Yes"

831
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:45,335
- "What do you eat?
- Whatever you give"

832
01:15:45,455 --> 01:15:49,455
- "Hey baby.
- My love"

833
01:15:58,328 --> 01:15:59,328
Dev.

834
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,455
Hello, Dev.

835
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:04,245
Hello, Sheila.

836
01:16:06,122 --> 01:16:09,830
You have expressed love at the highest level.

837
01:16:10,245 --> 01:16:12,872
Strangers compliment me.

838
01:16:13,205 --> 01:16:15,328
But my beloved doesn't care.

839
01:16:15,695 --> 01:16:17,538
Don't be mean.

840
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:19,346
That program was boring,
and the soup turned over.

841
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,413
No one gave me food here.

842
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:23,163
Sonia was at home.

843
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:26,872
Sonia...?  She has no help.

844
01:16:27,328 --> 01:16:29,793
She runs after pets.

845
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:31,585
She is talking to the horse.

846
01:16:31,705 --> 01:16:34,435
She followed a rabbit.

847
01:16:36,373 --> 01:16:37,788
Crazy girl.

848
01:16:38,418 --> 01:16:40,580
I'm sorry, my love.  hold me.

849
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,830
Your clothes are wet, why?

850
01:16:46,163 --> 01:16:48,955
I got angry, so I
jumped into the pool.

851
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:51,208
If you ignore me,
I will kill myself.

852
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,738
You get angry for no reason.

853
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,125
If you were still there,
you would be happy.

854
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,038
People were speechless when they saw me.

855
01:16:58,328 --> 01:17:00,627
They said, beauty
is eternal happiness.

856
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:02,872
for sure!

857
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:05,122
This table...?

858
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:08,080
I like that.

859
01:17:09,377 --> 01:17:10,455
sit down

860
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:15,163
I can win the race.

861
01:17:15,283 --> 01:17:18,163
Then I will surely lose.

862
01:17:18,457 --> 01:17:20,388
What will I do when you
become a movie star?

863
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:23,250
Why do you work?  have fun

864
01:17:23,412 --> 01:17:25,538
I am a devoted husband.

865
01:17:25,747 --> 01:17:28,163
- I will buy a good car.
- Yes.

866
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:30,495
I bet on the races.

867
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,620
I go gambling in clubs.

868
01:17:33,872 --> 01:17:38,788
People look at me and
say, I am a gentleman.

869
01:17:42,413 --> 01:17:47,168
If I turn around, they
tell me different things.

870
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,663
You are jealous.

871
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,747
Yes, I am jealous.

872
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,538
I will not leave you.
I'm jealous too.

873
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:18,072
Dev, you think I'm weird.

874
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:21,780
Although I told you to come to
Shimla, there is no time to be with you.

875
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,452
Please understand, I am busy.

876
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:27,072
I am surrounded by people.

877
01:18:27,197 --> 01:18:28,660
Useless people.

878
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,530
They are artists, not idlers.

879
01:18:31,737 --> 01:18:34,489
- It is my social duty to encourage them.
- Really?

880
01:18:34,867 --> 01:18:36,867
They are talented.

881
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:41,660
I probably talk too much about it.

882
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,280
I think they will go crazy.

883
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:49,112
Your name will be heard in those
crazy houses all over the world.

884
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:54,820
- I will definitely come for a walk in the morning.
- Like today?

885
01:18:55,057 --> 01:18:58,655
I can't sleep tonight.
I am awake.

886
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,947
why don't you sleep

887
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,987
You better sleep.

888
01:19:10,197 --> 01:19:11,947
I will assure you of that.

889
01:19:13,197 --> 01:19:17,697
Even if there is an explosion, you will not feel it.

890
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,405
Go.

891
01:19:32,905 --> 01:19:35,572
I couldn't sleep last night.

892
01:19:37,827 --> 01:19:40,987
Sometimes pills don't
work because it's winter.

893
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:42,405
How does it happen?

894
01:19:43,055 --> 01:19:44,364
I brought these yesterday.

895
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,530
Then.

896
01:19:48,572 --> 01:19:49,614
These must be fakes.

897
01:19:49,734 --> 01:19:53,030
Medicines are stolen these days.

898
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:58,197
All are thieves.
We can't help it.

899
01:20:00,737 --> 01:20:01,947
bless you.

900
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:10,905
Sneaky girl!

901
01:20:13,572 --> 01:20:17,947
The cook drinks half of the
milk and adds water to the rest.

902
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:20,155
I caught him today.

903
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:21,737
Really?

904
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:27,572
Pure milk is essential
for good health.

905
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,405
Food is equally important.

906
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:34,447
It's wrong, whether you
have good food or not…

907
01:20:34,947 --> 01:20:39,072
...everyone should
have plenty of milk.

908
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,947
Good night, sweet dreams!

909
01:21:14,737 --> 01:21:17,112
Whistling is useless.

910
01:21:17,737 --> 01:21:20,364
You are in love.

911
01:21:21,322 --> 01:21:22,405
Go there.

912
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:25,905
Then Sheila might wake up.

913
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,447
I don't want that to happen.

914
01:21:29,664 --> 01:21:32,322
If he opens his eyes, I will have to beat him.

915
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:35,239
I really wish.

916
01:21:35,905 --> 01:21:38,737
I will wait when you are embarrassed.

917
01:21:39,614 --> 01:21:41,112
I will say this...

918
01:21:41,987 --> 01:21:44,197
...a lover gets hit in Shimla.

919
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:48,820
You think this is a joke.

920
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,987
No, not like that.

921
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:55,197
Look at me and tell me.

922
01:21:56,155 --> 01:21:58,322
You don't love anyone.

923
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,239
- No, no...?

924
01:22:01,862 --> 01:22:02,910
No.

925
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:04,447
are you sure

926
01:22:04,772 --> 01:22:06,155
No.

927
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:10,280
- Answer me for love.
- what?

928
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:13,862
You are like a dream, I came to you.

929
01:22:40,737 --> 01:22:42,737
- What happened?
- I sprained my ankle.

930
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,737
Let me carry you.

931
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:48,489
There is a way to
carry a loved one.

932
01:22:49,117 --> 01:22:50,447
Did you mean in the heart?

933
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:54,697
In a rickshaw.  You have to drag it.

934
01:22:55,447 --> 01:22:57,155
I am a lover, not a rickshaw puller.

935
01:22:57,905 --> 01:22:59,905
You have already given up then.

936
01:23:01,862 --> 01:23:04,987
"Love is a journey"

937
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:07,820
"Wait"

938
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,987
Really?  I will bring a rickshaw.

939
01:23:11,697 --> 01:23:13,364
What do I get back then?

940
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,572
A boyfriend's salary.

941
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:20,572
Tears and an aching heart.

942
01:23:21,072 --> 01:23:23,737
"Look what love
has become of me"

943
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,472
"Look what love
has become of me"

944
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:47,139
"Look what love
has become of me"

945
01:24:47,259 --> 01:24:50,850
"Look what love
has become of me"

946
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:54,572
"Look what love
has become of me"

947
01:24:54,692 --> 01:25:00,224
"Look what love
has become of me"

948
01:25:00,344 --> 01:25:05,804
"Look what love
has become of me"

949
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:09,567
"Going With a Beauty"

950
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:13,402
"Bless My Rickshaw"

951
01:25:13,522 --> 01:25:17,155
"Going With a Beauty"

952
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:54,600
"wait a little"

953
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:58,262
"Take it easy"

954
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:02,115
"The wind will change my hair"

955
01:26:02,235 --> 01:26:05,827
"Take it easy"

956
01:26:05,947 --> 01:26:11,274
"The wind will change my hair"

957
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:17,060
"You are beautiful and
your work is attractive"

958
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:21,029
"Going With a Beauty"

959
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:24,517
"Bless My Rickshaw"

960
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:28,349
"Going With a Beauty"

961
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:05,512
"sit down"

962
01:27:05,632 --> 01:27:09,000
"Sit down my love"

963
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,924
"You're My First Ride"

964
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:16,359
"Sit down my love"

965
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:21,805
"You're My First Ride"

966
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:27,522
"This is a special rickshaw"

967
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:31,350
"Going With a Beauty"

968
01:27:31,642 --> 01:27:34,897
"Bless My Rickshaw"

969
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:38,892
"Going With a Beauty"

970
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,900
Father, no one
comes here so early.

971
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:12,647
Here they are.  They don't
know about our presence.

972
01:28:15,897 --> 01:28:17,104
Good morning Dev.

973
01:28:17,795 --> 01:28:18,795
Good morning, Father.

974
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:20,605
sit down

975
01:28:20,965 --> 01:28:24,772
Mr. Dev Kumar Mehra.

976
01:28:26,094 --> 01:28:27,855
your girlfriend...

977
01:28:28,687 --> 01:28:30,104
Are you married Dev?

978
01:28:30,897 --> 01:28:31,897
No.

979
01:28:32,105 --> 01:28:34,230
- Are you planning to get married?
- Yes.

980
01:28:34,414 --> 01:28:35,480
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

981
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:39,777
- Yes, no, Father.
- I understand.

982
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:41,897
I don't understand.

983
01:28:42,397 --> 01:28:47,020
Yes, no, yes, no.

984
01:28:47,437 --> 01:28:51,939
Dev, you are amazing
on the college stage.

985
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:55,230
Yes, those were good times.

986
01:28:55,562 --> 01:28:58,855
I organized a concert tonight.

987
01:28:59,437 --> 01:29:02,605
- Are you coming to the stage?
- To the stage...?

988
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,355
Yes, a good thing.

989
01:29:06,144 --> 01:29:07,897
- Okay dad.
- promise?

990
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:09,067
promise

991
01:29:09,187 --> 01:29:12,480
- Make a promise.
- This is the program.

992
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,145
- God bless you both.
- Thank you, Father.

993
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:22,397
If he wants to cheat…

994
01:29:22,562 --> 01:29:24,395
...Why did he choose me?

995
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,145
I can not believe.

996
01:29:31,187 --> 01:29:33,275
Sheila, while walking...

997
01:29:33,395 --> 01:29:36,187
...can you dream?

998
01:29:37,647 --> 01:29:40,730
How do I know if it's sugar?

999
01:29:41,522 --> 01:29:46,020
Trust me, I was awake.

1000
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,480
I saw something on the road.

1001
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,610
Dev was pulling the rickshaw.

1002
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:58,562
Sonia was safe in the rickshaw.

1003
01:29:58,812 --> 01:30:00,437
They were singing.

1004
01:30:00,904 --> 01:30:03,480
Work so you don't regret it.

1005
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:06,730
Otherwise, you will have
to cry for the rest of your life.

1006
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:11,020
Dev is a gentleman.
She is the one who cheated on him.

1007
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:16,687
If you pursue someone hard…

1008
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:18,562
...He'll knock you down sometime.

1009
01:30:18,939 --> 01:30:22,395
Either you separate them.

1010
01:30:23,897 --> 01:30:25,897
I don't want to see
your marriage fail.

1011
01:30:26,162 --> 01:30:27,230
Dev.

1012
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,020
Vijaya, you go out.

1013
01:30:30,687 --> 01:30:32,020
ok

1014
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:36,687
Good Morning.

1015
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,025
Good morning, Sheila.

1016
01:30:45,145 --> 01:30:48,562
- where were you?
- I went for a walk.

1017
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:50,730
- Alone?
- Yes.

1018
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,655
You have started lying.

1019
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:57,270
I actually met Sonia on the way.

1020
01:30:58,675 --> 01:31:00,062
She was very sad.

1021
01:31:00,437 --> 01:31:03,062
I thought she would
be happy with a walk.

1022
01:31:03,647 --> 01:31:05,730
Why do you please her?

1023
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:09,980
Because she is your sister-in-law.

1024
01:31:10,425 --> 01:31:12,145
Why did you pull her rickshaw?

1025
01:31:12,325 --> 01:31:15,562
Rickshaw...?  I told
her not to walk fast.

1026
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:17,480
She was running.

1027
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:20,395
stubborn girl  She was tired.

1028
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,230
So we came by rickshaw.

1029
01:31:22,522 --> 01:31:24,020
Who pulled the rickshaw?

1030
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:26,522
- The rickshaw puller.
- You lie again.

1031
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:32,020
I have been bored
since I came here.

1032
01:31:33,062 --> 01:31:36,187
I thought exercise would do me good.

1033
01:31:36,312 --> 01:31:39,355
Have no shame, what
will people think of you?

1034
01:31:39,897 --> 01:31:42,487
They will say, to
please my future wife...

1035
01:31:42,544 --> 01:31:45,204
...that I was
helping her cousin.

1036
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:47,980
No shame.  Then why did you sing?

1037
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:53,605
When I got tired,
I started singing.

1038
01:31:53,897 --> 01:31:56,150
If father had seen you,
he would have shot you.

1039
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,355
Thank God, then I am alive.

1040
01:31:58,812 --> 01:32:02,355
I saw that you don't
love me like before.

1041
01:32:03,437 --> 01:32:05,730
Sheila, I will listen
to anything you say.

1042
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:09,480
But take back your words.

1043
01:32:20,437 --> 01:32:22,522
Sheila, where are we going?

1044
01:32:23,065 --> 01:32:25,437
To hell!  You must come with me.

1045
01:32:29,355 --> 01:32:33,062
A priest in my college is sick.

1046
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,437
- He is about to die.
- Allow it.

1047
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,777
what am i doing now

1048
01:32:41,897 --> 01:32:44,270
- Who are you talking to?
- to you.

1049
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:46,020
What I do?

1050
01:32:46,312 --> 01:32:47,855
come with me

1051
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:50,897
Listen to this!

1052
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:53,812
He wants to see me
in his last moments.

1053
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:56,312
How can I reject him
and come with you?

1054
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:57,647
say

1055
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,145
- you go.  I will come.
- what?

1056
01:33:02,522 --> 01:33:04,442
I mean, you go.  I join you.

1057
01:33:04,562 --> 01:33:05,897
No.

1058
01:33:06,939 --> 01:33:08,145
You are heartless.

1059
01:33:08,687 --> 01:33:11,067
You have no compassion
for someone who is dying.

1060
01:33:11,187 --> 01:33:12,522
I know you're lying.

1061
01:33:13,312 --> 01:33:16,812
You can't lie about a dying person.

1062
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:20,935
- I'll go and talk.
- to whom?

1063
01:33:21,055 --> 01:33:22,270
to your father

1064
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:25,442
General, I need your help.

1065
01:33:25,562 --> 01:33:26,562
Yes?

1066
01:33:26,855 --> 01:33:29,020
There is no one as sentimental as you.

1067
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,777
I mean you have
killed enemies in wars.

1068
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:33,730
Yes, like insects.

1069
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,275
Imagine an elderly person dying.

1070
01:33:36,395 --> 01:33:38,355
- Let him die.
- You don't understand.

1071
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,772
An old relative wants to
see you, in his last moments.

1072
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,012
Are you going to see him
or go somewhere else?

1073
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:47,730
If so, then I'm going
to see that person.

1074
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,647
- But dad...
- Wait...

1075
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:51,747
Listen to her.

1076
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,692
Be quiet too.

1077
01:33:53,812 --> 01:33:57,187
Last for a priest in my college.
She won't let me go.

1078
01:33:57,437 --> 01:33:58,567
She is cruel.

1079
01:33:58,687 --> 01:34:01,437
- You should go there.
- Thank you very much.

1080
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:09,605
We bought tickets for 200 rupees.
50 rupees wasted.

1081
01:34:09,812 --> 01:34:12,685
It's for a good cause.

1082
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:14,067
It's for a good cause.

1083
01:34:14,087 --> 01:34:15,980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1084
01:34:17,105 --> 01:34:19,020
ladies and gentlemen!

1085
01:34:19,542 --> 01:34:23,645
This charity concert
is to help children.

1086
01:34:24,187 --> 01:34:26,812
For those orphans!

1087
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,062
thank you

1088
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,147
"left, right, left"

1089
01:35:08,397 --> 01:35:09,980
"left, right, left"

1090
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:13,730
"Have you ever been in love?"

1091
01:35:14,062 --> 01:35:18,027
"I'm so with you now"

1092
01:35:18,147 --> 01:35:21,860
"Have you ever been in love?"

1093
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:26,192
"I'm so with you now"

1094
01:35:26,312 --> 01:35:28,102
"left, right, left"

1095
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:31,635
"left, right, left"

1096
01:35:40,062 --> 01:35:47,775
"In a wonderful drizzle"

1097
01:35:47,895 --> 01:35:55,895
"Heart blown, no more meaning"

1098
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:08,902
"When in love, the
heart is uncontrollable"

1099
01:36:09,022 --> 01:36:13,770
"Heart Uncontrollable"

1100
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:17,985
"Have you ever been in love?"

1101
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:22,110
"I'm so with you now"

1102
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:25,937
"Have you ever been in love?"

1103
01:36:26,062 --> 01:36:30,192
"I'm so with you now"

1104
01:36:30,312 --> 01:36:32,235
"left, right, left"

1105
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:35,770
"left, right, left"

1106
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:51,980
"Look at the moving
clouds, it's like a game"

1107
01:36:52,105 --> 01:37:00,105
"What are you looking for?
Where are you going?"

1108
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:12,970
"They're looking for love just like us."

1109
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:18,105
"They're Looking for Love"

1110
01:37:18,272 --> 01:37:21,980
"Have you ever been in love?"

1111
01:37:22,147 --> 01:37:26,110
"I'm so with you now"

1112
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:29,902
"Have you ever been in love?"

1113
01:37:30,022 --> 01:37:33,895
"I'm so with you now"

1114
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:36,252
"left, right, left"

1115
01:37:36,372 --> 01:37:39,945
"left, right, left"

1116
01:37:48,187 --> 01:37:56,022
"Blowing wind and
mist kiss the green"

1117
01:37:56,147 --> 01:38:04,147
"Don't go crazy with love
like you're a wanderer."

1118
01:38:12,187 --> 01:38:16,942
"Life is meaningless
without love"

1119
01:38:17,062 --> 01:38:21,855
"Life is meaningless"

1120
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:25,942
"Have you ever been in love?"

1121
01:38:26,062 --> 01:38:30,022
"I'm so with you now"

1122
01:38:30,187 --> 01:38:33,735
"Have you ever been in love?"

1123
01:38:33,855 --> 01:38:37,645
"I'm so with you now"

1124
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,827
"Have you ever been in love?"

1125
01:38:41,947 --> 01:38:45,822
"I'm so with you now"

1126
01:38:45,942 --> 01:38:49,652
"Have you ever been in love?"

1127
01:38:49,772 --> 01:38:53,685
"I'm so with you now"

1128
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:04,520
Time to present
young, stage lovers,

1129
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:08,604
Mr. Dev Mehra and his girlfriend.

1130
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,730
This is my girlfriend's sister.

1131
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:15,937
His girlfriend's sister
if you can believe it.

1132
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:33,895
Mom, all this is dad's fault.

1133
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:37,855
If we scold Dev and
Sonia, Dad will correct them.

1134
01:39:37,922 --> 01:39:40,395
If I were in his place,
I would shoot them.

1135
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:42,355
Do you think I will spare them?

1136
01:39:49,312 --> 01:39:51,187
I stop myself.

1137
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:55,439
If Sonia is killed...

1138
01:39:56,272 --> 01:39:58,730
...which means wiping
my brother's memories.

1139
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:00,105
And Dev?

1140
01:40:01,605 --> 01:40:04,812
Who will Sheela marry if I kill Dev?

1141
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:08,397
Something is sure to happen today.

1142
01:40:11,664 --> 01:40:15,147
You, come in.

1143
01:40:15,855 --> 01:40:17,355
Good Morning.

1144
01:40:18,849 --> 01:40:21,520
Good Morning.  Good morning, Sheila.

1145
01:40:21,645 --> 01:40:22,812
sit down

1146
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:27,855
Listen, I am more
experienced than you.

1147
01:40:28,604 --> 01:40:32,520
Your behavior is unacceptable.

1148
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,187
Why did you lie to me?

1149
01:40:37,022 --> 01:40:38,770
I regret that.

1150
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,645
I apologize.

1151
01:40:42,687 --> 01:40:44,645
Did you hear him?

1152
01:40:45,315 --> 01:40:47,147
He apologized.

1153
01:40:47,604 --> 01:40:49,895
Go to your room.

1154
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:51,520
thank you

1155
01:40:55,032 --> 01:40:57,230
Are you done scolding him?

1156
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,105
If I get tougher,
he gets tougher.

1157
01:41:02,312 --> 01:41:03,855
I have fought wars.

1158
01:41:04,022 --> 01:41:09,147
This is a war between Sheela and Sonia.

1159
01:41:09,562 --> 01:41:11,645
It is up to them to decide.

1160
01:41:12,355 --> 01:41:13,855
I will decide immediately.

1161
01:41:15,855 --> 01:41:17,562
You are weird.

1162
01:41:18,895 --> 01:41:21,397
I am.

1163
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:27,355
"L love you"

1164
01:41:27,855 --> 01:41:29,147
"L love you"

1165
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,105
Sonia, this deception that exists now.

1166
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:34,687
You have sunk very low.

1167
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:39,230
I warned you.

1168
01:41:39,715 --> 01:41:41,895
I should have thought more...

1169
01:41:42,355 --> 01:41:47,645
What will Dev say when he
finds out you're trying to win a bet?

1170
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:53,562
What will he say when he finds out...

1171
01:41:54,022 --> 01:41:55,645
...that you marry him for money?

1172
01:41:57,312 --> 01:42:01,147
Sheila, you believed…

1173
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,062
...that no one will
love me and marry me.

1174
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,937
If I was convinced that
you really love Dev...

1175
01:42:12,355 --> 01:42:14,855
...I never even look at him.

1176
01:42:15,977 --> 01:42:19,230
What do you mean?
do you love him

1177
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:27,022
You have no right to ask me.

1178
01:42:28,105 --> 01:42:30,062
If you want him back…

1179
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,355
...you will have to apologize to me.

1180
01:42:33,562 --> 01:42:34,770
I would never do that.

1181
01:42:35,147 --> 01:42:37,147
Things are not going well for you and Dev.

1182
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:08,969
- you are beautifull.
- Really?

1183
01:43:09,219 --> 01:43:12,762
I am looking at this beautiful saree.

1184
01:43:12,885 --> 01:43:14,135
Grandma wore it for me.

1185
01:43:14,554 --> 01:43:19,135
But you are missing something.

1186
01:43:19,802 --> 01:43:23,385
Wear this ring.

1187
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:28,427
- It's a gift for Diwali.
- Thank you, aunt.

1188
01:43:29,302 --> 01:43:30,350
where is sheila

1189
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:33,219
She refuses to
come out of her room.

1190
01:43:33,339 --> 01:43:36,475
She is not even dressed yet.

1191
01:43:36,907 --> 01:43:38,177
why is that

1192
01:43:38,364 --> 01:43:40,552
Why don't you ask her?

1193
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,345
It's a shame.

1194
01:43:44,817 --> 01:43:46,652
Currently, only our family members know.

1195
01:43:46,772 --> 01:43:51,027
If others find out, our
reputation will be ruined.

1196
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,985
- Aunt.
- Things got out of hand.

1197
01:43:54,277 --> 01:43:56,277
Everything was messed up.

1198
01:43:56,424 --> 01:43:58,320
- But aunty.
- I know,

1199
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:00,027
These are the things Sheela did.

1200
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:03,737
It's too late to go to the pooja.
Everyone is waiting for you.

1201
01:44:06,817 --> 01:44:07,902
get up

1202
01:44:08,997 --> 01:44:11,737
Everyone is upset because of you.

1203
01:44:15,485 --> 01:44:16,819
Are you not happy?

1204
01:44:17,819 --> 01:44:20,027
Come get dressed.
I'll take them out.

1205
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,152
Sheela, today is Diwali.

1206
01:44:32,944 --> 01:44:34,777
Forget this battle,
at least for today.

1207
01:44:35,252 --> 01:44:39,272
How can I forget these things
when my mind is troubled?

1208
01:44:41,352 --> 01:44:44,934
If you wanted to mess with
me, you had a thousand reasons.

1209
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:50,847
What you have done to me,
not even an enemy can do.

1210
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:57,165
You've made me
cry my whole life.

1211
01:44:57,752 --> 01:45:02,417
Why don't you remember that?

1212
01:45:05,997 --> 01:45:08,222
I would like to apologize, Sonia.

1213
01:45:15,607 --> 01:45:19,265
- I apologize to you.
- Sheila.

1214
01:45:26,972 --> 01:45:29,180
I can do anything for Dev.

1215
01:45:29,472 --> 01:45:32,807
I love Dev.

1216
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,222
Your wish will come true.

1217
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,932
be happy.

1218
01:45:42,492 --> 01:45:44,305
Are you not happy?

1219
01:45:47,057 --> 01:45:49,890
I'm happy

1220
01:45:51,277 --> 01:45:53,305
Make me a promise.

1221
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,724
what is that

1222
01:45:56,222 --> 01:45:59,682
Promise me, you won't meet God.

1223
01:46:01,472 --> 01:46:03,472
I promise.

1224
01:46:09,972 --> 01:46:13,140
I promise you.

1225
01:46:19,532 --> 01:46:21,665
Good evening Dev
and Happy Diwali too.

1226
01:46:21,692 --> 01:46:23,772
Hello, Sheila.  Happy Diwali.

1227
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:26,840
Will you come to dance rehearsal with me?

1228
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,835
I will come.

1229
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:31,159
You guys are talking here.

1230
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:34,002
Mom is looking for you everywhere.  Let's go.

1231
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:41,210
- Sonia went alone?
- She won't come there.

1232
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:43,210
why is that  Today is Diwali.

1233
01:46:43,487 --> 01:46:46,042
Why is she at home?

1234
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,252
We force her to come.

1235
01:46:48,544 --> 01:46:50,460
I said, she will not come.

1236
01:46:51,455 --> 01:46:52,732
Do you want to stay too?

1237
01:46:52,852 --> 01:46:54,750
No, I will come with you.

1238
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:06,667
Listen!

1239
01:47:07,077 --> 01:47:10,002
Please be seated now.

1240
01:47:10,294 --> 01:47:13,335
The final rehearsal begins now.

1241
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,585
Ravi, why this?

1242
01:47:17,909 --> 01:47:19,710
Sorry, Sonia didn't come.

1243
01:47:20,377 --> 01:47:22,710
- Why is that?
- She is nervous.

1244
01:47:23,075 --> 01:47:24,835
- Here are the crackers you asked for.
- thank you.

1245
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,960
Here is the firebox and the rest of the money.

1246
01:47:27,252 --> 01:47:29,169
you keep

1247
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,100
How is it?

1248
01:47:31,252 --> 01:47:34,960
It has a sloppy state.

1249
01:47:37,505 --> 01:47:39,792
I will brighten there.

1250
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:49,667
I am glad...

1251
01:47:50,335 --> 01:47:54,835
...The contestants are well
trained in singing and dancing.

1252
01:47:55,597 --> 01:47:58,042
People from Shimla...

1253
01:47:58,272 --> 01:48:01,627
...appeared as dance partners.

1254
01:48:02,377 --> 01:48:04,960
Lucky girl...

1255
01:48:05,185 --> 01:48:07,085
...will be elected as
Miss Shimla tomorrow.

1256
01:48:07,224 --> 01:48:10,710
She has a radio, a tape recorder and…

1257
01:48:11,035 --> 01:48:15,507
...a three-year contract
from Filmalaya, Bombay.

1258
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:24,964
My God!  What is going on?

1259
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:29,085
I have been president here for twenty-five years.

1260
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:30,877
Apparently, this year…

1261
01:48:31,002 --> 01:48:34,002
...a revolutionary is here.

1262
01:48:34,127 --> 01:48:37,627
A person who wants
to destroy Indian beauty.

1263
01:48:37,912 --> 01:48:42,002
If this happens
again, I will arrest him.

1264
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,119
Oh my God.

1265
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:49,585
Close the doors.

1266
01:48:50,997 --> 01:48:54,547
Miss Dev Kumar Mehra
I will teach you a lesson.

1267
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:57,169
This is very disgusting behavior.

1268
01:48:57,392 --> 01:48:59,710
This is a great insult, sir.
Who do you think I am?

1269
01:48:59,877 --> 01:49:02,630
Do you think I am a
revolutionary or an anarchist?

1270
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:05,169
Stay away.  Do not touch me.

1271
01:49:06,137 --> 01:49:08,460
I didn't know I had them.

1272
01:49:09,512 --> 01:49:13,210
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the crackers!

1273
01:49:13,705 --> 01:49:16,667
Dev, you are dangerous.

1274
01:49:17,352 --> 01:49:20,835
I wanted to celebrate Diwali.

1275
01:49:21,294 --> 01:49:23,042
- I...
- Shut up.

1276
01:49:23,627 --> 01:49:26,335
Take these crackers and leave here.

1277
01:49:26,455 --> 01:49:28,335
You burn them all outside.

1278
01:49:28,835 --> 01:49:30,132
I'm sorry sir.

1279
01:49:30,252 --> 01:49:31,667
go out

1280
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:56,669
- who is?
- I am...

1281
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:00,669
I don't have the joy
of Diwali without you.

1282
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:12,417
why did you come here

1283
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,794
This is my bedroom.  I am alone.

1284
01:50:16,252 --> 01:50:17,542
I also came alone.

1285
01:50:18,092 --> 01:50:19,877
We must not be alone.

1286
01:50:20,292 --> 01:50:22,669
I want to be alone.  Please go.

1287
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:24,377
I can't help but see you.

1288
01:50:24,669 --> 01:50:26,417
I don't want to see you.

1289
01:50:26,627 --> 01:50:28,167
I say firmly.

1290
01:50:28,542 --> 01:50:29,907
Don't overstep your bounds, Dev.

1291
01:50:30,072 --> 01:50:31,710
My love is infinite.

1292
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,002
You haven't lost it.

1293
01:50:36,775 --> 01:50:38,919
Don't forget that you are
here because of Sheila.

1294
01:50:39,922 --> 01:50:41,292
You should be with her.

1295
01:50:41,765 --> 01:50:44,167
Please go.

1296
01:51:11,127 --> 01:51:14,674
"I am at your door"

1297
01:51:14,794 --> 01:51:18,297
"I give you my heart"

1298
01:51:18,417 --> 01:51:20,460
"I am not going"

1299
01:51:22,167 --> 01:51:25,840
"I am at your door"

1300
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:29,465
"I give you my heart"

1301
01:51:29,585 --> 01:51:32,210
"I am not going"

1302
01:51:39,044 --> 01:51:42,632
"I had to"

1303
01:51:42,752 --> 01:51:49,924
"fall in love with someone"

1304
01:51:50,044 --> 01:51:53,549
"I chose"

1305
01:51:53,669 --> 01:52:00,752
"Sacrifice yourself"

1306
01:52:01,135 --> 01:52:04,799
"I speak the truth"

1307
01:52:04,919 --> 01:52:08,465
"As long as I live"

1308
01:52:08,585 --> 01:52:10,669
"I am not going"

1309
01:52:12,377 --> 01:52:16,007
"I am at your door"

1310
01:52:16,127 --> 01:52:19,794
"I give you my heart"

1311
01:52:19,919 --> 01:52:22,542
"I am not going"

1312
01:52:29,314 --> 01:52:32,877
"Don't Reject Me"

1313
01:52:32,997 --> 01:52:40,172
"Don't Break My Heart"

1314
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:43,960
"You'll be sorry"

1315
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:50,794
"But you won't get my love back"

1316
01:52:51,417 --> 01:52:55,044
"I promise you my love"

1317
01:52:55,167 --> 01:52:58,669
"Let's Get Together"

1318
01:52:58,794 --> 01:53:01,210
"I am not going"

1319
01:53:02,627 --> 01:53:06,257
"I am at your door"

1320
01:53:06,377 --> 01:53:09,962
"I give you my heart"

1321
01:53:10,082 --> 01:53:12,542
"I am not going"

1322
01:53:19,465 --> 01:53:23,047
"I was attracted to wine"

1323
01:53:23,167 --> 01:53:30,340
"But I gave it all up for you"

1324
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:34,047
"I was with wine"

1325
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:41,167
"But I gave it all up for you."

1326
01:53:41,627 --> 01:53:45,130
"I'm here for you"

1327
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:48,882
"I came from afar"

1328
01:53:49,002 --> 01:53:51,127
"I am not going"

1329
01:53:52,865 --> 01:53:56,507
"I am at your door"

1330
01:53:56,627 --> 01:54:00,215
"I give you my heart"

1331
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:03,210
"I am not going"

1332
01:54:20,377 --> 01:54:22,502
I thought you were an honest girl.

1333
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:26,292
You must keep your
word no matter what.

1334
01:54:27,002 --> 01:54:30,960
Sonia, I realized
that you are a liar.

1335
01:54:31,292 --> 01:54:32,960
You broke your promise.

1336
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,210
How can I convince
you that I am innocent?

1337
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:37,044
He came of his own accord.

1338
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:39,167
Trust me, I didn't call him.

1339
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:42,335
I tried to avoid him
but he wouldn't go back.

1340
01:54:42,585 --> 01:54:46,377
God came for me.

1341
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:50,167
People laugh at me now.

1342
01:54:50,412 --> 01:54:51,752
They mock me.

1343
01:54:51,919 --> 01:54:53,919
Our family is said to be a strange family.

1344
01:54:54,437 --> 01:54:57,752
Sister, with sister's boyfriend...

1345
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:00,085
...They say we are shameless.

1346
01:55:00,917 --> 01:55:04,752
Your mother is a chaste woman.

1347
01:55:04,937 --> 01:55:07,252
You seduce your
sister's boyfriend.

1348
01:55:07,372 --> 01:55:09,044
Be quiet, Sheila.

1349
01:55:09,794 --> 01:55:11,585
I will protect that mother.

1350
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,502
One does not do that.

1351
01:55:15,002 --> 01:55:17,502
I wonder if you are trying to
take revenge on your mother.

1352
01:55:17,877 --> 01:55:20,085
Please try to understand.

1353
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:22,877
I just can't ignore him.

1354
01:55:24,085 --> 01:55:27,460
Dev and I are very close to each other.

1355
01:55:34,502 --> 01:55:37,002
God loves me.

1356
01:55:37,377 --> 01:55:39,502
He really loves me.

1357
01:55:39,877 --> 01:55:42,919
- That's what you wanted.
- No, I didn't.

1358
01:55:44,377 --> 01:55:47,127
I will keep my promise.

1359
01:55:48,669 --> 01:55:51,710
Sheela apologized to me.

1360
01:55:52,137 --> 01:55:53,372
What do I do now?

1361
01:55:53,592 --> 01:55:56,292
Please help me, grandma.

1362
01:55:57,044 --> 01:56:00,542
Why not say it out loud?

1363
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:04,919
Two lovers are inseparable.

1364
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:07,542
I can never say that.

1365
01:56:08,167 --> 01:56:09,340
Have you lost something?

1366
01:56:09,505 --> 01:56:11,167
Yes, that happened to me.

1367
01:56:11,582 --> 01:56:15,919
Grandma, how can I hate him?

1368
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:20,502
On the path of love...

1369
01:56:21,567 --> 01:56:23,250
Don't expect to kill it.

1370
01:56:24,377 --> 01:56:27,127
Hate has no place.

1371
01:56:27,502 --> 01:56:29,167
I, make him a hater.

1372
01:56:29,919 --> 01:56:31,382
I convince him…

1373
01:56:31,502 --> 01:56:34,422
...that I am mean and evil.

1374
01:56:34,542 --> 01:56:35,590
how is that

1375
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:38,919
I tend to flirt with others.

1376
01:56:39,295 --> 01:56:40,799
He will love you more.

1377
01:56:40,919 --> 01:56:44,085
I dance with others
and don't look at him.

1378
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:46,085
He will think you are kidding him.

1379
01:56:46,542 --> 01:56:48,085
He will tolerate it.

1380
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,335
Why didn't he tolerate Sheila?

1381
01:56:51,044 --> 01:56:54,210
Because Sheela was not looking for love.

1382
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,710
Seeking only wealth.

1383
01:57:08,377 --> 01:57:11,335
ladies and gentlemen!

1384
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:16,167
filmmakers and the esteemed
judges of our beauty pageant.

1385
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:21,919
The twenty fifth beauty
pageant is starting now.

1386
01:57:22,292 --> 01:57:26,502
As you know, the winner…

1387
01:57:26,919 --> 01:57:29,085
...gets a movie opportunity...

1388
01:57:29,335 --> 01:57:34,167
For assessment of
beauty and acting skills.

1389
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:37,335
Every candidate...

1390
01:57:37,669 --> 01:57:40,542
...want to dress up in different clothes.

1391
01:57:40,909 --> 01:57:42,542
Hello, everyone.

1392
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:50,669
ladies and gentlemen!

1393
01:57:51,044 --> 01:57:55,167
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce these young ladies...

1394
01:57:55,515 --> 01:57:58,092
...who is competing for
the Miss Shimla crown.

1395
01:58:02,395 --> 01:58:03,627
Come forward young people!

1396
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:09,465
The youth of Shimla this...

1397
01:58:09,585 --> 01:58:11,919
...will help young women.

1398
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:14,710
Singing and dancing with them.

1399
01:58:18,919 --> 01:58:23,460
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen!

1400
01:58:23,775 --> 01:58:27,292
Sorry for the late registration
for the competition.

1401
01:58:27,552 --> 01:58:30,047
If you allow, may I participate?

1402
01:58:30,167 --> 01:58:32,507
Yes of course.

1403
01:58:32,627 --> 01:58:34,502
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

1404
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:46,335
aunt

1405
01:58:47,085 --> 01:58:50,960
Look at this pistol.
One bullet is enough.

1406
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:54,127
You, kill her.

1407
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,292
what are you saying

1408
01:58:56,497 --> 01:58:59,460
You, shoot her.

1409
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:02,335
I will say, I killed her.

1410
01:59:03,092 --> 01:59:04,167
I don't understand you.

1411
01:59:04,502 --> 01:59:06,377
Why did you come here?

1412
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:09,794
I am at the end of this game.

1413
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:13,794
You promised Sheila
that you wouldn't block her.

1414
01:59:14,127 --> 01:59:15,335
That you forget God.

1415
01:59:16,122 --> 01:59:17,794
I remember that promise, aunty.

1416
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:20,377
However, you are here now.

1417
01:59:20,877 --> 01:59:22,794
Trust me aunty.

1418
01:59:31,752 --> 01:59:33,669

1419
01:59:34,377 --> 01:59:36,292

"I remember many stories tonight"

1421
01:59:44,597 --> 01:59:46,502
You were eager to
participate in the competition.

1422
01:59:47,192 --> 01:59:48,210
Why are you sad now?

1423
01:59:49,084 --> 01:59:50,542
You want to be a movie star right?

1424
01:59:51,502 --> 01:59:54,335
I helped Sheila.

1425
01:59:55,374 --> 01:59:57,127
I wanted to lose.

1426
01:59:58,877 --> 02:00:01,877
But she thinks I'm here to win.

1427
02:00:02,265 --> 02:00:04,377
You help Sheila.

1428
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:08,335
You look beautiful in this dress.

1429
02:00:10,112 --> 02:00:11,669
I can't take my eyes off you.

1430
02:00:13,027 --> 02:00:15,417
I would like to participate with you.

1431
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:17,794
Why wait!

1432
02:00:20,127 --> 02:00:22,502
Why wait!

"The dry fields shake with joy"

1454
02:02:54,427 --> 02:02:58,297
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1455
02:02:58,417 --> 02:03:03,257
"Clouds Raining in Love"

1456
02:03:03,377 --> 02:03:07,177
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1457
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:10,797
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1458
02:03:27,002 --> 02:03:30,877
"I'm lonely because of love"

1459
02:03:31,002 --> 02:03:34,919
"I don't know what to do"

1460
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:38,850
"Loss in Love is True Victory"

1461
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:42,882

02:03:43,002 --> 02:03:47,757
"Clouds Raining in Love"

1463
02:03:47,877 --> 02:03:51,775
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1464
02:03:51,895 --> 02:03:55,492
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1465
02:03:55,919 --> 02:04:00,799
"Clouds Raining in Love"

1466
02:04:00,919 --> 02:04:04,439
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1467
02:04:04,559 --> 02:04:08,147
"The dry fields shake with joy"

1468
02:04:32,474 --> 02:04:34,557
Sonia.

1469
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:40,807
Miss Shimla!

1470
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:42,722
Sonia.

1471
02:04:43,139 --> 02:04:44,935
Sonia.

1472
02:04:45,055 --> 02:04:47,139
Sonia.

1473
02:04:49,139 --> 02:04:50,722
See how they talk to you.

1474
02:04:50,842 --> 02:04:52,872
They say you are the winner.

1475
02:04:53,467 --> 02:04:56,935
"Pretty girls are
never intimate"

1476
02:04:57,055 --> 02:05:00,682
"They're not kind to anyone."

1477
02:05:00,842 --> 02:05:03,185
"Keep it in your heart"

1478
02:05:03,305 --> 02:05:05,812
"I, dare to face you"

1479
02:05:05,932 --> 02:05:09,890
"Pretty girls are
never intimate"

1480
02:05:20,557 --> 02:05:24,395
"Spread the light of
love, dispel the darkness"

1481
02:05:24,515 --> 02:05:28,305
"Dispel the Darkness"

1482
02:05:28,425 --> 02:05:32,194
"Wait for the right time"

1483
02:05:32,314 --> 02:05:36,019
"it's time"

1484
02:05:36,139 --> 02:05:40,704
"don't do that to me"

1485
02:05:41,722 --> 02:05:45,305
"Pretty girls are
never intimate"

1486
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:49,145
"They're not kind to anyone."

1487
02:05:49,265 --> 02:05:51,602
"Keep it in your heart"

1488
02:05:51,722 --> 02:05:54,139
"I, dare to face you"

1489
02:05:54,265 --> 02:05:56,645
"Keep it in your heart"

1490
02:05:56,765 --> 02:05:59,180
"I, dare to face you"

1491
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:01,500
"Keep it in your heart"

1492
02:06:01,755 --> 02:06:03,680
"I, dare to face you"

1493
02:06:13,682 --> 02:06:17,557
Ladies and gentlemen, I am
very happy to announce this.

1494
02:06:17,775 --> 02:06:23,905
A smart, 17-year-old girl.

1495
02:06:23,949 --> 02:06:26,682
Miss Shimla has been selected
as the winner of the competition...

1496
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:29,597
Miss Sonia!

1497
02:06:48,075 --> 02:06:50,305
Best wishes, Sonia.

1498
02:06:52,642 --> 02:06:53,974
thank you sir

1499
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:57,682
Here's your tape recorder...

1500
02:06:58,077 --> 02:07:01,055
...and a film contract
from Bombay's Filmalaya.

1501
02:07:06,577 --> 02:07:09,685
I am more than happy
to get the film contract.

1502
02:07:10,622 --> 02:07:12,415
- Thank you, sir.
- thank you.

1503
02:07:13,297 --> 02:07:17,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
as a partner...

1504
02:07:17,992 --> 02:07:21,622
...Contributed by Dev Mehra.

1505
02:07:22,035 --> 02:07:24,495
The honorable judges have decided...

1506
02:07:24,747 --> 02:07:27,872
...to present him with this radio.

1507
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:30,955
Mr. Dev Mehra!

1508
02:07:35,077 --> 02:07:37,695
- Your radio.
- Thank you, sir.

1509
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,872
Can I use the mic?

1510
02:07:40,099 --> 02:07:41,747
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

1511
02:07:43,969 --> 02:07:45,289
ladies and gentlemen!

1512
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:48,622
Sonia performed very well on stage.

1513
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:51,914
She acts well in real life too.

1514
02:07:53,239 --> 02:07:55,289
I present this radio to her.

1515
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,872
Wherever I am, this
gift will remind me of you.

1516
02:08:09,667 --> 02:08:11,747
I hold it close to my heart.

1517
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:17,164
- Thank you, Dev.
- Okay.

1518
02:08:33,492 --> 02:08:36,460
Sheila, you are crying over something stupid.

1519
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:40,622
Vijaya, I was running
after fame instead of love.

1520
02:08:40,822 --> 02:08:42,539
I got neither love nor fame.

1521
02:08:42,659 --> 02:08:46,247
Why don't you tell Dev that
you had a fight with Sonia...

1522
02:08:46,452 --> 02:08:49,830
So she accepted the
challenge of winning his heart.

1523
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:52,330
He loves Sonia.

1524
02:08:54,257 --> 02:08:57,495
Sonia just wants to win the bet.

1525
02:08:57,615 --> 02:08:59,040
She does not love him.

1526
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:01,539
- It's too late now, Vijaya.
- It's not late.

1527
02:09:02,694 --> 02:09:05,955
Poor Dev, I pity him.

1528
02:09:06,075 --> 02:09:09,914
If you can't I will
tell him everything.

1529
02:09:16,297 --> 02:09:18,455
Is Sheela telling the truth?

1530
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,372
come with me

1531
02:09:35,122 --> 02:09:37,622
I'm sad to tell you the truth.

1532
02:09:39,254 --> 02:09:40,622
what are you doing now

1533
02:09:48,247 --> 02:09:50,789
I will take care of it.

1534
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:09,622
Hello, Sonia.

1535
02:10:11,747 --> 02:10:12,997
Hello, Dev.

1536
02:10:13,437 --> 02:10:15,664
You left without meeting me.

1537
02:10:16,985 --> 02:10:20,330
I couldn't even congratulate you.

1538
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,122
What a beautiful presentation!

1539
02:10:26,789 --> 02:10:29,122
How did you change overnight?

1540
02:10:31,539 --> 02:10:34,914
I wonder who
that girl I met was.

1541
02:10:35,789 --> 02:10:37,914
Fell in love for it.

1542
02:10:38,552 --> 02:10:40,372
who are you

1543
02:10:41,914 --> 02:10:43,289
I didn't recognize you.

1544
02:10:45,354 --> 02:10:46,497
I remember.

1545
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:48,997
love in your eyes

1546
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:51,622
The love in your words...

1547
02:10:52,985 --> 02:10:55,205
...and your honesty.

1548
02:10:55,785 --> 02:10:58,330
I couldn't help you.

1549
02:10:58,789 --> 02:11:02,372
Sonia, if this happened to
every girl who met a guy...

1550
02:11:03,497 --> 02:11:04,789
...how does he live?

1551
02:11:06,567 --> 02:11:08,580
You and I understand
what love is.

1552
02:11:09,549 --> 02:11:12,955
Some for fun, some for fame...

1553
02:11:13,377 --> 02:11:15,122
Some love money.

1554
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:16,955
Some like to win a bet.

1555
02:11:19,915 --> 02:11:22,122
We don't mind some
fools dying for love.

1556
02:11:23,872 --> 02:11:25,747
There is no point in talking about this.

1557
02:11:25,872 --> 02:11:27,789
Morning dawns in a few hours.

1558
02:11:27,995 --> 02:11:30,664
Let's drink, dance, celebrate.

1559
02:11:31,164 --> 02:11:32,622
Let's have some fun.

1560
02:11:35,122 --> 02:11:36,830
It's too bright here.

1561
02:11:39,372 --> 02:11:42,039
I will play soft music...

1562
02:11:43,769 --> 02:11:46,122
...to enhance the beauty of this night.

1563
02:11:50,682 --> 02:11:54,247
Dev, I want to tell you a story.

1564
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:56,789
I couldn't before.

1565
02:11:57,824 --> 02:12:00,164
A girl humiliated
and humiliated...

1566
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:05,455
Looking for love and security in life.

1567
02:12:06,705 --> 02:12:08,455
She barely managed to find love.

1568
02:12:09,195 --> 02:12:11,915
When all worries are eased.

1569
02:12:13,289 --> 02:12:16,330
Sister's condition...

1570
02:12:17,789 --> 02:12:21,289
Those tears hurt the heart.

1571
02:12:22,682 --> 02:12:25,995
Seeing that dark face is hard to bear.

1572
02:12:26,697 --> 02:12:29,247
If you really love...

1573
02:12:30,664 --> 02:12:33,414
...begging you...

1574
02:12:34,747 --> 02:12:36,372
...to accept Sheila's love.

1575
02:12:37,177 --> 02:12:39,164
She will be grateful to you.

1576
02:12:41,194 --> 02:12:43,455
Do it for love.

1577
02:12:43,829 --> 02:12:46,080
He believes in you, Dev.

1578
02:12:47,414 --> 02:12:49,789
You should never reject her.

1579
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:53,205
Fulfill the last will.

1580
02:12:54,247 --> 02:12:56,955
I will never ask anything again.

1581
02:12:57,757 --> 02:13:00,622
It's a promise.

1582
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:10,997
I can die for love Sonia.

1583
02:13:12,039 --> 02:13:14,122
But I can't trade love.

1584
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:20,455
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

1585
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:25,080
I have been waiting
for you all my life.

1586
02:13:55,975 --> 02:13:58,747
No one has ever loved me so much.

1587
02:14:00,997 --> 02:14:02,955
I would willingly die

1588
02:14:04,644 --> 02:14:07,080
for love

1589
02:15:06,637 --> 02:15:08,580
You worry about the little things.

1590
02:15:08,747 --> 02:15:10,164
You think it's a silly thing.

1591
02:15:10,627 --> 02:15:13,997
Sonia wrote that she
will be back in a few days.

1592
02:15:14,454 --> 02:15:15,747
I wonder why she left.

1593
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:19,085
She makes a sacrifice for
Sheela.  Don't you understand that?

1594
02:15:19,205 --> 02:15:23,330
I know.  But Sheila's
marriage is very important.

1595
02:15:23,955 --> 02:15:26,039
You are worried about her marriage

1596
02:15:26,289 --> 02:15:28,164
It's not about
the poor girl's life.

1597
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:30,705
What if Sheila commits suicide?

1598
02:15:30,955 --> 02:15:33,205
Sheila is my daughter.
She can die if she wants to.

1599
02:15:33,497 --> 02:15:36,735
I want my late brother's
daughter not to die.

1600
02:15:37,330 --> 02:15:39,164
I will call the police
and look for Sonia.

1601
02:15:39,495 --> 02:15:41,039
It would be a disgrace to us.

1602
02:15:41,605 --> 02:15:44,044
Our family will be disgraced.
Try to understand.

1603
02:15:44,164 --> 02:15:47,127
It's about a girl's life.

1604
02:15:47,247 --> 02:15:48,348
You worry about respect.

1605
02:15:48,372 --> 02:15:52,664
all right.  Trust
me, we will find her.

1606
02:15:53,239 --> 02:15:54,705
Let's find her.

1607
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:59,164
Because Dev came here.  It is a disaster for us.

1608
02:16:00,205 --> 02:16:01,372
Grandma, do you know about this?

1609
02:16:01,914 --> 02:16:03,914
I received Sonia's letter.

1610
02:16:07,539 --> 02:16:09,289
She's going to die for me.

1611
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:17,080
I didn't tell anyone this.

1612
02:16:17,997 --> 02:16:21,372
Now I have no
choice but to tell you.

1613
02:16:23,035 --> 02:16:26,080
I am happy.

1614
02:16:26,654 --> 02:16:29,080
But I am a woman in a sad situation.

1615
02:16:31,247 --> 02:16:34,372
I saw how Sonia's
mother's life was ruined.

1616
02:16:36,177 --> 02:16:38,372
I saw her die of grief.

1617
02:16:40,045 --> 02:16:41,747
I saw the death of my son.

1618
02:16:43,415 --> 02:16:47,495
I wish I was dead, but
Sonia wouldn't let me then.

1619
02:16:48,087 --> 02:16:50,495
Today she wants to commit suicide.

1620
02:16:50,872 --> 02:16:54,039
God forbid if she was
going to hurt herself.

1621
02:16:54,247 --> 02:16:55,539
Before leaving this house,

1622
02:16:56,122 --> 02:16:58,544
I might die too.

1623
02:16:58,664 --> 02:17:02,580
Grandma, I promise
I will save Sonia.

1624
02:17:03,622 --> 02:17:04,705
If I don't...

1625
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:07,495
...I'm dying too.

1626
02:17:15,539 --> 02:17:17,080
I came to apologize Sheila.

1627
02:17:17,664 --> 02:17:18,789
For what?

1628
02:17:19,455 --> 02:17:20,997
what have you done?

1629
02:17:21,289 --> 02:17:22,830
I want to marry you.

1630
02:17:23,289 --> 02:17:25,495
what?

1631
02:17:26,707 --> 02:17:27,955
You're kidding right?

1632
02:17:30,747 --> 02:17:32,664
I really want to marry you.

1633
02:17:34,262 --> 02:17:36,372
Think with your heart.

1634
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:39,289
Say this is what you really like.

1635
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:42,580
If all wishes come true...

1636
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:44,997
believe me.

1637
02:17:45,817 --> 02:17:47,789
Life will be meaningless.

1638
02:17:49,574 --> 02:17:52,830
Some wishes are important to be fulfilled.

1639
02:17:53,455 --> 02:17:54,789
While some don't…

1640
02:17:55,667 --> 02:17:58,247
We must live to chase.

1641
02:17:58,747 --> 02:18:00,664
To achieve the impossible.

1642
02:18:02,039 --> 02:18:05,497
It's like cheating yourself.

1643
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:08,122
Deception makes one live.

1644
02:18:09,122 --> 02:18:10,914
We all die.

1645
02:18:11,914 --> 02:18:13,789
I was happy to call you here.

1646
02:18:14,904 --> 02:18:16,497
I came with high hopes.

1647
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:19,497
How have you changed?

1648
02:18:21,375 --> 02:18:22,705
There is no point in talking about it.

1649
02:18:23,245 --> 02:18:24,705
You must answer me.

1650
02:18:25,890 --> 02:18:28,080
Will your ego allow you to listen?

1651
02:18:28,894 --> 02:18:30,334
What arrogance are you talking about?

1652
02:18:31,247 --> 02:18:32,914
What are you talking about?

1653
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:35,580
Everything ended because of your treachery.

1654
02:18:36,914 --> 02:18:41,539
Sheela, one good
karma deserves another.

1655
02:18:42,122 --> 02:18:44,705
You can repay the kindness
with another kind act.

1656
02:18:45,497 --> 02:18:48,789
Money, or sweet words.

1657
02:18:50,330 --> 02:18:53,372
But when it comes to love...

1658
02:18:54,395 --> 02:18:57,664
...You can't repay it
with anything but love.

1659
02:18:59,789 --> 02:19:02,039
I never got that love from you.

1660
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:05,747
I found love elsewhere.

1661
02:19:07,122 --> 02:19:08,789
But fate had other plans.

1662
02:19:09,497 --> 02:19:10,664
Why come to me now?

1663
02:19:11,405 --> 02:19:15,205
Go to your lost loved one.

1664
02:19:16,914 --> 02:19:19,039
I'm not here to scold, Sheila.

1665
02:19:19,955 --> 02:19:20,955
Why did you come here?

1666
02:19:22,122 --> 02:19:23,830
To save a life.

1667
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,400
Read this.

1668
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:41,205
Sonia will die if you
don't marry me in 4 days.

1669
02:19:42,122 --> 02:19:43,497
Then you too will die.

1670
02:19:43,857 --> 02:19:45,080
My life is not important.

1671
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:47,955
But if Sonia dies, you
have no right to live.

1672
02:19:48,602 --> 02:19:51,955
This life is worse than death.
What is wrong with me?

1673
02:19:52,009 --> 02:19:53,964
Don't talk like you don't know.

1674
02:19:53,987 --> 02:19:55,915
You are crazy.

1675
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:58,872
I'm telling the truth.

1676
02:19:59,164 --> 02:20:01,627
keep quiet  Don't be stubborn.

1677
02:20:01,747 --> 02:20:03,705
You don't do that.

1678
02:20:04,289 --> 02:20:07,080
Someone dies because
of you, but you don't care.

1679
02:20:07,705 --> 02:20:09,747
An innocent person dies, you don't care.

1680
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:13,539
She won the bet, but
she gives her life for you.

1681
02:20:13,705 --> 02:20:15,997
You wait for her to die.

1682
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:21,705
Sheela, only you can save her.

1683
02:20:22,522 --> 02:20:24,495
Do it for humanity.

1684
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:26,955
For that reason.

1685
02:20:30,744 --> 02:20:32,205
Marry me Sheela.

1686
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:35,330
I promise to do as you say.

1687
02:20:35,857 --> 02:20:38,164
Your word will be my command.

1688
02:20:38,945 --> 02:20:40,997
I hold you close to my heart.

1689
02:20:41,705 --> 02:20:43,164
I'll be sure.

1690
02:20:43,635 --> 02:20:46,460
May you be happy every moment.

1691
02:20:46,610 --> 02:20:47,610
Dev.

1692
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:42,034

It will be broadcast on
radio from 8 pm tomorrow.

1697
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:18,685
It's eight o'clock.

1698
02:22:18,994 --> 02:22:23,227
We are promoting the
events of a grand wedding.

1699
02:22:23,602 --> 02:22:25,602
In Shimla, you can listen to it too.

1700
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:29,269
It is the famous Dev Kumar Mehra's…

1701
02:22:29,394 --> 02:22:33,560
...and Rajpal Singh's
daughter Sheela's wedding.

1702
02:22:33,935 --> 02:22:35,977
These lovers...

1703
02:22:36,477 --> 02:22:40,477
Tonight will be together forever.

1704
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:43,394
Everyone welcomed the bridegroom.

1705
02:22:44,269 --> 02:22:48,269
Can't wish guests well yet.

1706
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:56,560
The groom and the
bride have taken vows.

1707
02:23:17,185 --> 02:23:19,852
The sky is clear.

1708
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:22,144
This place...

1709
02:23:22,852 --> 02:23:24,352
Bright and bright...

1710
02:23:24,727 --> 02:23:26,894
Glowing with the joy of love.

1711
02:23:29,505 --> 02:23:31,977
Everyone is happy.

1712
02:23:32,269 --> 02:23:34,935
Young parents want to…

1713
02:23:35,602 --> 02:23:39,894
...to make their children grow up
quickly and get married gloriously.

1714
02:23:40,602 --> 02:23:42,602
Everyone congratulates the couple.

1715
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:47,560
Guests are eager to give gifts.

1716
02:23:48,602 --> 02:23:50,227
Many gifts...

1717
02:23:51,045 --> 02:23:53,100
stay tune...

1718
02:23:53,672 --> 02:23:55,685
....until the couple's hands join.

1719
02:23:56,649 --> 02:24:00,935
Looks like the groom is looking for someone.

1720
02:24:01,185 --> 02:24:05,227
He says, everyone
congratulated us…

1721
02:24:05,755 --> 02:24:08,769
...but that I await
the arrival of one.

1722
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:14,102
If that person can hear me...

1723
02:24:14,519 --> 02:24:18,894
I request you to
fulfill my notice.

1724
02:24:36,242 --> 02:24:39,310
- Dev.
- Hello, Sonya.  were are you?

1725
02:24:39,727 --> 02:24:41,852

02:24:42,685 --> 02:24:45,144
Please come back.
We did as you said.

1727
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:46,602
I'm sorry Dev.

1728
02:24:47,727 --> 02:24:49,269
I am far away.

1729
02:24:50,727 --> 02:24:52,352
I can't come back.

1730
02:24:56,060 --> 02:24:58,102
If true...

1731
02:24:58,337 --> 02:25:01,727
Will meet in the soul after death.

1732
02:25:03,262 --> 02:25:04,435
I assure you,

1733
02:25:05,664 --> 02:25:07,269
One day we will meet.

1734
02:25:08,224 --> 02:25:10,894
In a certain spirit.

1735
02:25:11,477 --> 02:25:14,060
What are you talking about, Sonia?

1736
02:25:14,185 --> 02:25:15,769
God bless you.

1737
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:21,144
Sonia.

1738
02:26:04,894 --> 02:26:06,685
Hello, phone exchange location?

1739
02:26:07,435 --> 02:26:08,519
Yes...?

1740
02:26:09,894 --> 02:26:11,227

1741
02:26:11,769 --> 02:26:13,644
- I found Sonia.
- Where is she?

1742
02:26:13,852 --> 02:26:14,932
In Govt. Bungalow.

1743
02:26:15,055 --> 02:26:16,644
I hope she knows...

1744
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:19,519
...that we found out her whereabouts.

1745
02:26:19,644 --> 02:26:21,769
No, Sheila.  I have to hurry.

1746
02:26:22,477 --> 02:26:23,977
To request that she not kill herself.

1747
02:26:24,727 --> 02:26:26,815
My child is dying.

1748
02:26:26,935 --> 02:26:28,227
Don't worry grandma.

1749
02:26:28,277 --> 02:26:30,527
Dev's song is now
being played on the radio.

1750
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,352
He will reach there in that time.

1751
02:26:32,644 --> 02:26:33,727
Let's go.

1752
02:26:35,977 --> 02:26:38,810
People are forcing Dev

1753
02:26:39,265 --> 02:26:43,435

Yes.

02:33:18,227 --> 02:33:19,810
Why did you save me?

1786
02:33:20,685 --> 02:33:22,602
I can't live without you.

1787
02:33:23,394 --> 02:33:26,560
are you mad?  You belong to Sheila.

1788
