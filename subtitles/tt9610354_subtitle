00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,458
- He has gone mad.
- You donâ€™t know anything. Go!

176
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,834
Hey! Wonâ€™t you come?

177
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,917
Go away.

178
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,291
I donâ€™t understand him.

179
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,875
Hey! Who are you looking for?

180
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:56,959

Excuse me.

183
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,583
Yes, Ankitha.

184
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,500
Dad! Where are you?

185
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,208
I am at the site.

186

- Are you busy?
- No... Tell me.

187
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,458
Can you come home once?

188
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,333
I will come right away. Okay.

- Okay, dad. Bye.
- Bye.

Nice.

191
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,083
How do you do this?

192
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,542
We do it by placing sugar.
We should rotate this wheel to make it.

193
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,875
Is it made out of sugar?

194
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,375

Did you see this?
Candy is made out of sugar.

00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,166
Does sugar make candy?

203
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,792
Wow! It is very interesting. Fantastic!

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,667
Why do you react just like
your daughter, sir?

205
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,291
I am selling candy here.

206
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,834
She said that sheâ€™d buy all of it
if I tell her how I make it.

207
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,375
I thought Iâ€™d go watch Pawan Kalyan

You tell her sir.

Will it become this?

Wow!

00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,583

when I was young.

218

- Really?

Gosh!

I am disturbed.

232

- Right!

- Shut up and come.

Give me some clarity.

unwanted people around.

Stop the bike. I will get down.

- Stop! I will get down.

Hey! Where to?
â€“ No! Straight!

He's torturing me.

00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,583
- I will call you later.
- She must be somewhere around.

00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,208
I have to talk with her today
at any cost.

253

- I should miss this time. Wait.
- Hey! Why did you bring me here?

254

Whom is he searching?

Move aside.

Hey! It's Jyothi.

00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh no no! It is definitely Jyothi
if I am scared.

Hey... Stop overacting.

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,834
Nothing like that.

00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,291
- I think she lost some weight.?
- Oh! Is it?

261
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,083
She lost around three-fourth. Canâ€™t you see?

262
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,333
Why will be like this if I lost 30 kilos?

263
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,792
Not 30, it is 750 grams... Three-fourth of a kilo.

- We are here to meet you.

perspective.

These lines and colorsâ€¦

289
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,708
This color is exactly like the glow
in your face.

- Everything will be different.
- Whatâ€™s going on?

291
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,792
Why are talking about college
instead of the painting?

292
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,625
It is not about the college, sir.
I am explaining the painting.

293
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,917
- Ask her.
- He explained it very well.

294
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,834
A guy would say like that.

295
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,667
Why would you say that?
You know me, right?

296
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,542
I never show interest towards girls.

297
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,375
I was telling her because
she was interested.

298
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,000

Oh! I have night shift.

Heâ€™s a guy without gratefulness.
No gratitude at all.

- Heâ€™s my close friend.
- Same company?

No! He is not a software guy.

He is good for nothing.

00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,000
He has no goals in life.

Give me your mobile number.
Hey! Did you like my painting?

I will dedicate the college if you want,
not just the painting.

Stop there.... Letâ€™s have a smoke.

Yes, buddy! I feel the same.

They don't carry pen in banks,
No helmet while drivingâ€¦

They don't keep change

- Equals to tan theta.

00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,917
Ohâ€¦

352
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,625
- Hello, uncle.
- Come in.

353
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,041
Do you what your son does
when he goes out?

354
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,208
He will follow girls and comment them.

355
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,917
He will dedicate the college
to someone it seems.

356
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,291
â€¦as if it belongs to him.

357
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:45,000
I am unable to answer my friends
and enemies.

358
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,375
Stop it.

359
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,625
He is not good with decision-making.

360
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,500
He likes cricket for a period
and then music.

361
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,792
Now, it is painting.

362
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,959
I encourage him and support
with everything he wants.

363
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,375
I hope to see him in a good position
in my fantasy.

364
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,125
But, he is nothing in reality.

365
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,083
- What is this torture, mom?
- Just for a little while.

366
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,625
Daddy! Selfie!

367
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,458
A selfie in this situation?

368
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,250
Daddy! Shall we both take a selfie?

369
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, sure.

370
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,125
- Thank you.
- Okay.

371
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,458
Not me... Try to keep her under control.

372
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,458
She is the best in everything.
She is always first.

373
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,875
She is my daughter.

374
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:25,375
Your son started taking puffs nowadays.

375
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,041
What? Are you smoking?

376
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,500
It wasnâ€™t me, mom.

377
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,291
He was smoking and I was simply
holding it.

378
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,333
- Idiot.
- Uncleâ€¦

379
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,625
- New project in my software company.
- I was tensed and it was just one cigarette.

380
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,875
Donald trump! Please.

381
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,083
It is okay with you.

382
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,834
You can smoke, booze
or do anything you want.

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,250
You have a goal in life.

384
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,083
You got settled in software job.

385
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,583
What is his goal?

386
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,041
He will get settled one day, uncle.
Donâ€™t worry.

387
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,834
I am waiting for that day.

388
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,041
Idiot.

389
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,333
- What a family, man!
- I'm leaving, uncle.

390
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,708
- Loose some weight.
- Okay.

391
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,750
Does Roshini know that
I am not into software?

392
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,041
She doesnâ€™t know. You may leave.

393
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:03,959
Okay.

394
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,000
Hey!

395
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,125
Donâ€™t stumble here and there like rolling stones.

396
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,542
Settle in a right place.

397
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:09,792
How many times should I tell you?

398
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,917
- What did you say?
- I told you not to ask me.

399
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:13,291
Oh!

400
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,583
Is it like telling me to not ask you?

401
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:50,125
â€œI feel you in every voice that is heardâ€

402
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:54,792
â€œI hear yours when someone calls a nameâ€

403
00:25:55,333 --> 00:26:00,041
â€œI see you wherever I goâ€

404
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,667
â€œI am indulged in love no matter what happensâ€

405
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,291
â€œMy heartâ€¦

406
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,834
Is not with me anymoreâ€

407
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,291
â€œI wasâ€¦

408
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,917
"Vanished by my heartâ€

409
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,166
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

410
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,333
â€œTotallyâ€¦ I have become youâ€

411
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,166
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

412
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:43,125
â€œTotallyâ€¦I have become youâ€

413
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:19,875
â€œYour charm is locked in my gaze like thisâ€

414
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:29,750
â€œMy treads are being hauled towards your gloryâ€

415
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:34,708
â€œMy love, it feels like a dreamâ€

416
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:39,542
â€œDo you know if this is true?â€

417
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:44,500
â€œIs there any way to know that?â€

418
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,667
â€œIs there an evidence that it really exists?â€

419
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,583
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

420
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,500
â€œTotallyâ€¦I have become youâ€

421
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:03,458
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

422
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,500
â€œTotallyâ€¦I have become youâ€

423
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:43,875
â€œIn the time that has passed all these yearsâ€

424
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:48,959
â€œI have never felt like this beforeâ€

425
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:53,625
â€œLike a wonderful appearanceâ€

426
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,792
â€œIt happened only because of youâ€

427
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,708
â€œI feel that thereâ€™s a magic around meâ€

428
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:08,750
â€œDid it happen to you too?â€

429
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:13,542
â€œThere is some enthrallmentâ€

430
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:18,667
â€œDo you feel the same?â€

431
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,583
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

432
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,625
â€œTotallyâ€¦I have become youâ€

433
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:32,542
â€œAm I there? Am I really there?â€

434
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,834
â€œAm I there?â€

435
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:37,375
â€œTotallyâ€¦I have become youâ€

436
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,250
â€œIâ€™ve become youâ€

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Ankitha!

438
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,500
Good morning.

439
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,917
Why are you dull?

440
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,166
Daddy! I had a dream.

441
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,542
Everyone will dream.

442
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,625
I keep getting the same dream, dad.

443
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,959
Why do you worry about dreams?

444
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,166
Thatâ€™s okay. What are your plans today?

445
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,917
Nothing.

446
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,250
Okay.

447
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,083
Drink it.

448
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,291
Come on... Have this.

449
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,208
- I donâ€™t want.
- Your dad is getting late for the office.

450
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,250
I have so many meetings at office today.

451
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,417
I have to go.

452
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,208
- Take care and be a good girl.
- Okay, daddy.

453
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,834
- See you.
- Okay.

454
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,500
Ankitha is moody today.

455
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,375
She thinks a lot about that dream.

456
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:00,291
Shall I bring Ankitha to you?

457
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:03,625
Hey! It is just a dream.
Donâ€™t think too much unnecessarily.

458
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,917
It might be her dream or a memory.

459
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,792
You shouldnâ€™t think much about it.
I will talk to Ankitha.

460
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,667
You donâ€™t worry.
- Okay.

461
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,125
Hi.

462
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,291
Jo?

463
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,583
I was thinking about you.

464
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,542
Really? Thatâ€™s why I wanted
to surprise you.

465
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,875
Why are still like this?

466
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,166
Go and get ready.

467
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,708
I am hungry. Let us go out
and eat something.

468
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,792
Jo! Shall I do something?

469
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,458
Do you know how to cook?

470
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,708
Wait here. I will be back.
Five minutes.

471
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,875
Oh no no!

472
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,417
But, it smells good.

473
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,333
What is this?

474
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,792
Guess.

475
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,375
It smells like omelet
but it looks different.

476
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,333
Ankitha cooked it.
So, it will be different.

477
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,917
Taste it and tell me...
I will get ready in 2 minutes.

478
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,291
- Shall we go out for a movie?
- Movie? I am not interested.

479
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,166
Okay. You tell me. Where shall we go?

480
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,708
Where shall we go?

481
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,166
Yeah! We met them.

482
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,959
When?

483
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,250
We met Abhi at art gallery.

484
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:13,000
Why are you thinking about him now?

485
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,792
Boys will try to travel with us
if we simply look at them.

486
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,333
If he comes to know that
you asked about himâ€¦

487
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,834
â€¦he will want you for life.

488
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,458
Will you be with him?

489
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:24,708
Hey!

490
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,834
Hi.

491
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,250
We should go out for a movie
and it is final. Okay?

492
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,125
Fix it.

493
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,834
Waitâ€¦ I will also come.

494
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,375
It will be so good.

495
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:40,834
Hey, Jo.

496
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:43,875
Hi.

497
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,166
What are you doing here?

498
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,375
Shall we talk while we go?

499
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,792
Look at me. Many people gaze
but I never care about anyone.

500
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,333
You should be like that.

501
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:55,041
I was asking Jo about you
and saw you.

502
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,875
- About me?
- Yeah.

503
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,458
Really?

504
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,291
Why are you getting excited?

505
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,625
Look how he is blushing.

506
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,083
I asked her casually.

507
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,291
[ABHI INNER VOICE]: â€˜You think about her
and she thinks about you.â€™

508
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,875
â€˜Hey, Abhi! You are so lucky.â€™

509
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,375
Youth waste their time. Silly fellows!

510
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,625
Are you youth?

511
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,250
You say that you are a software guy
but you roam around with him.

512
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,041
Moreover, you say that
it is waste of time.

513
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,834
I work for a client in the US.

514
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,125
It is night for me when it is a day for us.

515
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,875
Youâ€™ll always be with us
from morning till evening.

516
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:26,917
I will work in the afternoonsâ€¦
Why do you care?

517
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,083
Donâ€™t question me for everything like CBI.

518
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,834
What do you know about software?
- I know a lot.

519
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,834
- Do you know Java?
- I had it in the morning.

520
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,542
- Do you know Oracle?
- The one beside Rama talkies.

521
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,375
- Why wouldnâ€™t I know?
- Do you know SAP?

522
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,667
I ate last night. It was yummy.

523
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,208
Cheap fellows!

524
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,750
Not all these! I am working on a new program

525
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,959
Youâ€™ll see the change within one year.

526
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,375
You have been saying from past 10 years.

527
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,834
Why do you talk about all of that
when I ask about software?

528
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,458
Thereâ€™s a guy like him in our village.

529
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,125
He followed a girl very badly.

530
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,917
She rejected him.

531
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,333
This guy got depressed.

532
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,125
And then he started boozing.

533
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,417
Later, he became sick.

534
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,792
- Whatâ€™s next?
- What will happen...

535
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,250
No one knows where he is.

536
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,834
His dad calls me for him.

537
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,458
- I feel uncomfortable when you say that.
- How should I feel then?

538
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,500
- Where are you?
- I am at Abhiâ€™s place.

539
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,875
Okay, hang up. I am coming.

540
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,625
Hey! It is Ankitha!

541
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:33,583
Hi.

542
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,708
- Hi.
- Hi.

543
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,041
Satya! Art gallery?
- Yeahâ€¦

544
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,375
Excuse me.

545
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,041
Heâ€™s being busy these days.

546
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:40,917
Hi.

547
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,125
Which company are you working for?

548
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,166
I am the project manager at TCS.

549
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:50,667
Well said.
- How can you work at TCS with Wipro ID?

550
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,500
I work as a freelancer.

551
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,041
Freelancer?

552
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,834
I work as a consultant for everyone.

553
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:59,500
TCS, Satyam, Wipro, Tata. Everyone!

554
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,625
Stop it. Thatâ€™s enough.

555
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,500
He wanted to work for a software company
but he did not get a chance.

556
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,000
- You said that you wouldnâ€™t tell anyone
- Ankitha is our friend..

557
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,417
Okay.

558
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,750
This secret should remain
between us three. Okay?

559
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Promise?

560
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,959
Promise. I wonâ€™t tell anyone.

561
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,375
Hey! What is it about promise?

562
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,375
She asked to give party
and I promised to give.

563
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,750
He wants everything. Sit down.

564
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:22,875
Will you give party too?

565
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,708
Of course!
Pay back my loan first.

566
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,500
- Jyothi!
- Hey! Call me Jo.

567
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,375
Jyothi! Come and sit.

568
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,166
Okay, come. It is getting late.
We shall go.

569
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,583
Come and sit.
- Sit.

570
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,583
Get a large Fanta for Jyothi
and a chilled one.

571
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,500
We are getting for movie.
Letâ€™s go.

572
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,917
Movie at this time?

573
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,750
- Letâ€™s go out for lunch.
- We already decided.

574
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,583
Is it good?

575
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,875
What is bamboo chicken?

576
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,208
Donâ€™t you know bamboo chicken?

577
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,625
Havenâ€™t you had this earlier?

578
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,875
This is my favorite food.

579
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,417
Hey! Hi, buddy.

580
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,208
Hey, man! Where have you been?

581
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,625
- Hi, bro.
- Hi, DJ.

582
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,667
Ankitha! Thatâ€™s DJ.

583
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,875
Hi.

584
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,917
Hi.

585
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,291
He composes nice songs.

586
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,792
But, you might need sometime to understand.

587
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,500
You canâ€™t say anything to me from tomorrow.
- Why?

588
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,959
I am doing a show for the first time.
Don't miss it.

589
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,750
Ankitha! You are also invited.

590
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,041
What is DJ?

591
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,500
[ALL]: Donâ€™t you know whatâ€™s DJ?

592
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,875
She doesnâ€™t know anything, buddy.

593
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,834
Please join us.
- We can't make it.

594
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,208
Hey! What is your problem?

595
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,834
We have to go. We canâ€™t come.

596
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,083
Hey! Sheâ€™s ready to come.
What is your problem?

597
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,750
Please.

598
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,583
I havenâ€™t experienced DJ.

599
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,458
Let's go.
Please, Jo.

600
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:47,917

â€œAn embellished lightningâ€

620
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,500
â€œA tempo of the thunderâ€

621
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,959
â€œA sparkle of the fallen starâ€

622

Stop.

Okay. It is already late.

663
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,959
- Bye. Bye.
â€“ Bye.

664
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:56,959
Goâ€¦

665
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,834
- Wait.
- Bye, Abhi.

666
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,375
- Okay, bye.
- Bye, Satya.

667
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,500
- Letâ€™s go.
- Wait for a minute.

668
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:15,542
Abhi! I enjoyed a lot today.

669
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,250
I am so happy.

670
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,959
When shall we meet again?

671
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,250
Is it okay tomorrow?

672
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,417
Bye.

673
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:50,375
[MUSIC]

674
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,458
Bye.

675
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,458
Letâ€™s go.

00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,250
- Bye.
- Bye.

677
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,708
Hey.

678
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,000
I am telling you.

679
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,333
She is in love with you.

680
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,208
I saw her at the pub.

681
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,208
Listen to me and express
your feelings to her.

682
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,041
It would be nice if I say.

683
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,542
- But, what if she says it?
- Oh!

684
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,959
Listen to me!
Such stupid plans will not work.

685
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,291
You propose her.

686
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,542
It would be nice to hear from her
rather than telling her.

687
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,667
I donâ€™t get it. But, she has fallen for you.

688
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,125
Okay. Letâ€™s go...
- I am telling you. No doubt.

689
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:57,583
Abhi.

690
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,834
Abhi.

691
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,708
Go away, mom.

692
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,250
- Get up. Do you know what time is it?
- What?

693
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,333
It's past 12 pm.

694
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,417
It is time to have lunch and take a nap.
Get up.

695
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,333
Why didn't you go to the office?

696
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,875
My vehicle is at servicing centerâ€¦
You should drop me. Let's go.

697
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,917
- Why donâ€™t you take a cab?
- I can go.

698
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,083
But, I want you to drop me. Okay?

699
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,750
He is silly. Fathers are like that.

00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,583
He woke me up at 12.

701
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,000
- Hello, Mr. Varma.
- Yeah, Mr. Rao.

702
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,375
- Wait for a minute.
- Dad!

703
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,166
You are getting late to the office?
- We'll go.

704
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,750
- How are you, Mr. Rao?
- Good... Are you going to the office?

705
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,208
No! Weâ€™re going home.

706
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,417
Your house is this way.
Why are you going that way?

707
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,417
- Is he your son?
- What is he doing?

708
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,834
He does everything but not a job.

709
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,125
- Will you be here?
- I will.

710
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,792
I will talk to you once I come back.

711
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,583
Mr. Varma!
Heyâ€¦Stop.

712
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,875
- What is it again, dad?
- Wait. We'll go.

713
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,917
- I have good news for you.
- Tell me.

714
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,208
- My son got admission in the US.
- Really?

715
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:56,208
I was following you since morning
to share that.

716
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,417
- But you were going forward.
- Congratulations.

717
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:00,708
Did you come to say that?
- Yes.

718
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,708
Where? Beside Trump?

719
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,667
What happened to your friends, dad?
They act like reporters.

720
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,792
- Priest... Greetings!
- Greetings, sir.

721
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,333
- How are you doing?
- I am good, sir.

722
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,125
When is your sonâ€™s wedding?

723
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,333
You ask him.

724
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,000
I already have two kids.

725
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,166
Sir! You havenâ€™t told me.

726
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,708
I came to know just now.

727
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:27,583
- You son is too fast.
- Yes, he is young and fast.

728
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:30,834
Morning, sir... Why are you late today?

729
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,208
Were you stuck in the traffic?
- I am stuck in my sonâ€™s life.

730
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,500
- Sir! Is he your son?
- Yeah.

731
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,291
- He looks a movie hero.
- Omkar! I plead you.

732
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,792
He lacks that one thing.

733
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:41,000
Please don't give such ideas to him.

734
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,625
Abhi! Why didnâ€™t pick up my call?

735
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,792
I called you many times.

736
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,792
What should I say, Ankitha?

737
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,041
Tell me.

738
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,125
My dad woke me up in the morning.

739
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,875
He tortured me starting from home
till we reached his office.

740
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,333
Hi, dad.

741
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:06,333
- Jaya! Get me coffee.
- Okay.

742
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,792
Ankitha! Whoâ€™s on the phone call?

743
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:22,875
It is Abhi, dad.

744
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:26,708
Is it?
- I forgot to tell youâ€¦

745
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,708
Surekha called from the States.
Theyâ€™re coming to India next month.

746
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,917
It has been so long that my sister
came to India.

747
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,625
Will you tell Trump to cancel the visa?

748
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,750
I will say whatever if people
like you listen to me.

749
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,333
[CAMERA CLICKS]

750
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,083
I will call you later... Okay, bye.

751
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,125
Girl... Girlfriend?
To this guy?

752
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,083
Did you post it on FB?

753
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,041
I am talking to you.

754
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,417
Hey.

755
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:13,166
- So, you know it.
- You didnâ€™t tell me about her.

756
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,417
Friend?

757
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:24,041
More than that.

758
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:26,917
Stop doing dubsmash.
I am seriously asking you...

759
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,625
- Who is that girl?
- Girl?

760
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,000
Is it a boy?

761
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:31,959
Why did you become like this?

762
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,041
Okay. Who is that girl?

763
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,875
Go away! Look at your face!

764
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:37,291
Mom! See what he is doing.

765
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,500
Hey! Did you propose her or not?

766
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,667
No... I impressed her.

767
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,208
But, I have no idea how
she might react if I express.

768
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,917
One guy in my village went after one girl
without proposing her.

769
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,500
She got married when
he planned to propose her.

770
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:54,166
- Her husband beat him up.
- You shut up.

771
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:57,000
I can say that she loves me
by looking into her eyes.

772
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:02,000
Stop saying all that and tell us
if you expressed or not.

773
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,792
Hey! I am 99 percent sure that
Ankitha is in love with me.

774
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,417
But, I have one percent doubt.

775
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,166
- That one percent is enough.
- Everyone will fail at that point.

776
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,792
I donâ€™t want to face that.

777
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,667
That is why I want her to express
her feelings first.

778
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,708
A girl never proposes a boy.

779
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,333
Boys will propose to girls.

780
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,458
Boys are great...
Girls are waste.

781
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,083
Few feelings make us happy.

782
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,291
We get a feeling to see the girl.

783
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,417
We wait.
We plan to meet.

784
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,041
We fail to express.

785
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,458
All these feelings are blissful.

786
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,792
Weâ€™d miss all these of we express
our love on the first day.

787
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:33,667
My love story should be cool,
interesting and beautiful.

788
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,208
You think that she has fallen for you.
You think that she talks only with you.

789
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,333
Expecting her to hop on your bike.
Expecting her in your dreams.

790
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,792
At the end, she might love someone else.

791
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,291
These are all common. Just chill.

792
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,583
Hey! Wonâ€™t you ever talk
in a positive manner?

793
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:46,125
- Girls areâ€¦
- Stop it.

794
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,375
That girl is waiting for me to express.

795
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,542
I am waiting for her to express.

796
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:52,750
That feeling is awesome.

797
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:54,417
I understand because
I am experiencing it.

798
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:55,834
Guys like you wonâ€™t understand.

799
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:57,083
Waste fellows.

800
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,333
After traveling with you for 6 months,

801
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,625
She would say that you are just a friend
and sheâ€™ll leave.

802
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,792
There is no use to feel bad then.

803
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,375
That is why you should have some clarity
before itself.

804
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,542
Donâ€™t get into such things.
You cannot get out of it later.

805
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,000
Nothing of that will happen to you.

806
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:11,375
You are good looking with nose and all.
It's okay.

807
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,583
That reminds of something.
There is guy named Raju in my village.

808
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,417
- His nose is charming. Heâ€¦
- Shut up.

809
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,291
You have someone to compare
with in every situation. Let's go!

810
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,917
Look at that face!

811
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,000
â€˜Friends are always like this.â€™

812
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,458
â€˜They raised many doubts in my mind.â€™

813
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,166
â€˜What should I do now?â€™

814
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,375
Sister. Oh!

815
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,417
He calls me in a sweet manner.

816
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,834
He needs my help.

817
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,750
I am in my class.

818
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:49,959
- Hello.
- Roshini.

819
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,041
Tell me fast.
Sir will come.

820
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,417
Nothing. I have to speak with you.

821
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,875
I have exams. It is not possible.

822
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,000
â€˜She understood.â€™

823
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,000
I thought of taking you to ice cream store.

824
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,667
Is it not possible for you?

825
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,458
Ice cream?

826
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:10,333
You always disturb me while I study.

827
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,333
I know very well about your studies.

828
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:15,083
You are pleasing me, right?
Okay. I will think about it.

829
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,000
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. I will come.

830
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,083
Okay.

831
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,041
â€˜She is simply overacting. I know her.â€™

832
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,834
It feels happy to eat with his money.

833
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:25,000
Should I ask you now or
should I ask you after you eat?

834
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,875
Ask me after I eat...
I know about you.

835
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,792
You will leave without paying the bill.

836
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,125
â€˜Sheâ€™s tricking me.â€™

837
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,250
How will these girls be?

838
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,000
Go and get your eyes checked.

839
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:46,125
I am right here and you ask me
how girls are.

840
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,875
They will be like me.

841
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,083
Hey! You and your stupid face!

842
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,041
- I will leave.
- Heyâ€¦sorryâ€¦

843
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,917
- Thatâ€™s how you should behave.
- Actuallyâ€¦

844
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,166
What are the inner feelings of girls?

845
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,375
Letâ€™s do open talk.

846
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,333
Okay.

847
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,250
Will girls propose or not?

848
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,500
If it is about meâ€¦

849
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,708
About you? Who is that?

850
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,250
Is that the guy who drives bike
in a good manner or someone else?

851
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:19,291
Tell him that I will not spare him.

852
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,375
No love stories for you during first year.

853
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,542
Whatâ€™s your age and
what kind of things you do?

854
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,250
â€˜Is it too much?â€™

855
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:30,000
Helloâ€¦ I am not that type.
No one dares doing it.

856
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,959
I have clarity about my life.

857
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,542
You stop over acting.

858
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,583
It is not wrong to fall in love.

859
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,250
But, age matters for everything.

860
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,834
You shouldnâ€™t love at your age.

861
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,375
You are still young.

862
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44,500
I can love at my age.

863
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:46,083
I know.

864
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:48,917
Is your doubt about you or about me?

865
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,917
- I will leave if you behave like this.
- Heyâ€¦

866
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,625
If not, I will have another ice cream.

867
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,041
How many ice creams will you have?

868
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,125
Tell me any of your friendsâ€™ love stories.

869
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,750
My friends are not grown-ups like you.

870
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,625
You talk about age, right?

871
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,125
Will you tell or not?

872
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:06,500
Please.
- Hey.

873
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,333
Will anyone ask his sister about love?

874
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,917
Hey! It is not about love.

875
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,917
How does girls think?
I want to know that.

876
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:17,125
No girl will express her feelings.

877
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,917
She hides her feelings.

878
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,417
You should express first.
Then, we can see what happens.

879
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:27,500
Shall we meet tomorrow?
I have to talk to you.

880
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:29,834
Thatâ€™s too much.

881
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,333
Let yourself down.

882
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,875
Is it?

883
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:37,250
You said that girls do not express
and hide their feelings.

884
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:40,166
Pay the bill for your ice cream
and post it on FB.

885
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,375
You will get more likes. Byeâ€¦

886
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,166
Girls do not pay the bill.

887
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,792
Abhi!

888
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,625
Iâ€™ve been waiting to say something to you.

889
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:55,250
Abhi! I want to say I love you.

890
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,375
I love you, Abhi.

891
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:08,875
I was thinking of a way to express
my feelings.

892
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:13,417
I loved you in my first sight, Ankitha.

893
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,625
I love you too.

894
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,583
â€˜What is this?
I was dreaming?â€™

895
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:30,917
My dress is right.

896
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,625
But, Ankithaâ€™s dress does not match.

897
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,250
I will not fail for sure.

898
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,583
Dress isnâ€™t a matter...
Heart is important.

899
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:42,083
Hi.

900
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,542
Hi, Ankitha.

901
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:44,750
Hi.

902
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,750
I should ask you something. Can I?

903
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,500
â€˜Is it real?â€™

904
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:50,208
Donâ€™t waste time and ask me.

905
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,917
I want to ask you but I am not sure
how you might react.

906
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,834
Why will I react?
I feel whatever you feel.

907
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,375
Okay, I will ask you.

908
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,208
Iâ€¦

909
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:07,500
You?

910
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,041
- Can you teach me painting?
- What?

911
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,708
Painting?

912
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,291
Painting is nothing. I will teach.

913
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,291
Do you like painting?

914
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,834
I donâ€™t just like it. It is a necessity.

915
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,083
Okay. That's fine. Next?

916
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,792
Whatâ€™s next?

917
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:34,959
I donâ€™t have any plans to exhibit
my paintings.

918
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,792
You impressed me.

919
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,667
I should teach you painting. Is that all?

920
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,125
I will teach you.

921
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,166
Not that, Ankitha.
What is that you want to tell me?

922
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:47,083
There should be clarity is few things.

923
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,917
I say yes to whatever you say.

924
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,625
I am scared that you might say No
if I say something.

925
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,542
What is this â€˜Yesâ€™ and â€˜Noâ€™?

926
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,458
I donâ€™t understand anything.

927
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:03,041
What are those flowers and
love symbols in messages?

928
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:07,375
I send them to make the message colorful.

929
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,250
Did you call me to say that?
- Yes.

930
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:11,708
Isnâ€™t there anything else?

931
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,708
There is nothing else.

932
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,834
You could have said that on phone.

933
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,125
Phone.

934
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,625
Soâ€¦

935
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,959
Did you call me here to ask about painting?

936
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,625
Are you sure?

937
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,041
- Sure.
- Is it painting?

938
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,125
I will teach you. Bye.

939
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,542
Bye.

940
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:39,500
You are right, guys.

941
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,083
Girls will not express their love.

942
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,875
What happened?

943
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,125
Tell me what happened.

944
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,458
I expected something.
But, something else happened.

945
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:09,291
I knew it.
I know about you and your expectations.

946
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:12,458
What is your opinion about girls?

947
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:16,542
Are you expecting them to propose
just because they are close to you?

948
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,041
Are you saying that Ankitha doesnâ€™t
have feelings for me?

949
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,000
But, I feel that she loves me.

950
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:27,583
Ankitha is very different from others.

951
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:30,291
She is very innocent....
She is not like other girls.

952
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:34,208
Why will such a unique person
come and propose you?

953
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:36,000
What should I do now?

954
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,375
Give me back the ice cream I paid.

955
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,291
Hey! I will give you.
This is too much.

956
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,667
This is nothing before what you did.

957
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:47,083
Will you give or not?
You should pay the interest too.

958
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,000
- Give me your wallet.
- You want money, right?

959
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:50,750
I will buy you an ice cream
and then give you.

960
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,291
Give me a good suggestion.

961
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:53,834
I am already in confusion.

962
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,750
Then, you should go and propose her.

963
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,875
I am tensed about her response if I propose.

964
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:03,750
My intention is that it might be good
if she proposes me.

965
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,291
I have to do something and end this.

966
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:07,959
How many times should I tell you?

967
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,667
Girls will not propose first.

968
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:12,125
You have to propose. You do it first.

969
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,750
- I have to do it first?
- Hmm.

970
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,417
Ankitha!

971
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,500
Do you know how to cook?

972
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,542
I can cook omelet. â€“ Omelet?

973
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,917
Do you like it?

974
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,875
Cooking is not a problem.

975
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:36,291
My mom will take care of it.

976
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,959
â€˜Donâ€™t look at me like that.
I cannot control myself.â€™

977
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,417
Abhi! Whatâ€™s that surprise
you were talking about? - Nothing.

978
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,917
â€˜Abhi! You brought Ankitha here to propose.â€™

979
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,250
â€˜You forget that and simply say nothing.â€™

980
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,291
â€˜Is it needed?
First tell her.â€™

981
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,458
What is it, Abhi?

982
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,458
Why are you talking to yourself?

983
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,291
That isâ€¦

984
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,500
Your hair is nice.

985
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:08,917
Which shampoo?

986
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,333
Hair?

987
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:15,500
Thatâ€™s not the matterâ€¦
You were trying to say something else.

988
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,166
Somethingâ€¦right?

989
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,250
Sky is nice, right?

990
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:23,667
- It's so nice.
- â€˜Are you weather reporter to say that?â€™

991
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,458
Why do you care about those?

992
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,625
This is your first love.

993
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:29,542
You are trying to express your love
for the first time.

994
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,959
You wonâ€™t get a better chance. Tell her.

995
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:36,333
Come on... 1...2â€¦3â€¦4

996
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:37,792
Ankitha.

997
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,375
What is it, Abhi?

998
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,166
Your eyes are amazing.

999
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,333
Eyes?

1000
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,500
â€˜Her eyes are disturbing.â€™
- Abhi.

1001
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,959
What happened to you?

1002
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:53,000
Your behavior is different.

1003
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,500
â€˜Not different but worst behavior.â€™

1004
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:03,250
â€˜You know what I want to tell you.â€™

1005
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,917
â€˜You must have decided.â€™

1006
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:07,583
â€˜That I should express it.â€™

1007
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,083
- I will find moment to say it.
- Hey! Is it dance movement?

1008
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,458
You can hear such things.

1009
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,959
Your dance was so good
at the pub that day.

1010
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,250
Can you teach me? Please.

1011
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:18,834
- Please. No.
- Pleaseâ€¦

1012
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,125
Leave it.... Some other timeâ€¦

1013
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,333
Please tell me that you will teach.

1014
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,333
Ankitha! This is my favorite place.

1015
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,333
I love this place.

1016
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,708
Do you like it?

1017
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,041
It is beautiful.

1018
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,125
Amazing.

1019
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,125
Will you teach me to dance or not?

1020
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,208
Gosh! Youâ€™ll not leave me until I teach.

1021
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,291
- Turn around... Hey.

1022
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,291
â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€

1023
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,333
â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€

â€œYou are filled in meâ€

1029
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:40,750

â€œShall I make sketches in the air
that explains you?â€

1037
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,708
â€œShall I rename this type of language?â€

1038
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,792
â€œThat treasures you in my breathâ€

1039
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,667
â€œShall I come to you once a day?â€

1040
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,917
â€œThat ensures a lifelong attachmentâ€

1041
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:46,708

â€œIs all because of youâ€

1047
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,208
â€œLike a part of my bodyâ€

1048
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,708
â€œYou are everywhereâ€

1049
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,250
â€œThere is no much distanceâ€

1050
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:58,667
â€œYou dwell in my heartâ€

1051
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,750
â€œThis is something that
canâ€™t be expressed in wordsâ€

1052
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,625
â€œMoments of dismay turn out to be ecstaticâ€

1053
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:10,708
â€œItâ€™s a potent gaze beyond yoursâ€

1054
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:13,625
â€œIn between the left and the rightâ€

1055
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,417
â€œThere is this twirling storyâ€

1056
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:19,583
â€œLike a dream of twoâ€

1057
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,667
â€œAdjoins as one like usâ€

1058
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,458
â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€

1059
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,458
â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€

1060
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,542
â€œThis disturbance in meâ€

1061
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,834
â€œIs all because of youâ€

1062
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,834
Abhi! I am so happy being with you.

1063
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53,625
You are so handsome.

1064
01:04:56,834 --> 01:04:59,333
Did anyone propose to you?

1065
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:03,458
Donâ€™t you have any love story?

1066
01:05:03,959 --> 01:05:06,917
I donâ€™t have any love story till now.

1067
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,166
[LOWER TONE]: There will be a story
if you accept my love.

1068
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,917
What is your opinion about love, Abhi?

1069
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:18,291
Love isnâ€™t past or present for me.

1070
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:20,000
It's my future.

1071
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,458
Suppose if we love someone,
No matter what the situation is...

1072
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,417
we should never give up our love.

1073
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,625
We should never forget that or let others forget.

1074
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,041
It's my feeling... That's my opinion.

1075
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,417
I have a same feeling.

1076
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,041
Is it?

1077
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:57,083
[ABHI INNER VOICE]: â€˜You wonâ€™t get
a better chance than this, Abhi.â€™

1078
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,500
Ankitha.

1079
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,000
â€˜I tried hard to get some courage.â€™

1080
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,000
â€˜Where did she go?â€™

1081
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,959
Sorryâ€¦ What were you saying?

1082
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,375
â€˜What can I say now?â€™
- Abhi!

1083
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:13,375
I have to tell you something.

1084
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:17,041
I love my dad so much.

1085
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,417
Not just love, he is my life.

1086
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,500
I share everything with my dad.

1087
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:31,875
Now, I did not share this with my dad
but I am telling you first.

1088
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You are so close to me...
Closer to my heart!

1089
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:40,500
â€˜She says everything but
not the important thing.â€™

1090
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:45,041
What is that you want to tell me?

1091
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,792
I am waiting for a guy
who is in my dreams.

1092
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,208
- Dream?
- Yes, Abhi.

1093
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:54,959
I am in love with him.

1094
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:58,375
He is my love, life.

1095
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:01,083
He is my life.

1096
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,625
I will wait lifelong for him.

1097
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,458
He is my first and last love.

1098
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:12,667
I have a hope that he will meet me some day.

1099
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:20,250
It might sound silly but I want to see
how he looks now.

1100
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:26,583
Am I boring you with my love story?

1101
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,667
You might have been bored.

1102
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:33,166
I can talk my heart out
when you are beside me.

1103
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,417
Hey!

1104
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:44,625
Why are you standing here?
Are you enjoying the view?

1105
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,375
Abhi.

1106
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,500
Abhi.

1107
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,291
Listen to me.

1108
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,834
Wait.

1109
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,708
Abhi.

1110
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,000
Hey.

1111
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,375
You know what I want to say.

1112
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,625
But, you talk something
without letting me say it.

1113
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,667
What do you want to say?

1114
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,959
Okay. Let me tell you.

1115
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,959
What is it, Abhi?

1116
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,625
Ankithaâ€¦

1117
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:19,041
I thought that she is not expressive.

1118
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:21,583
But, she didnâ€™t let me express.

1119
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,708
Are you still thinking about her?

1120
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,959
I knew it from the day you started
thinking seriously about her...

1121
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:31,208
â€¦that weâ€™d have this discussion at beach.

1122
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,125
You didnâ€™t listen to me.

1123
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:35,667
This is his first love.
It's obviously painful.

1124
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:37,667
Leave him alone for some time.

1125
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,125
Is there anyone in this world
who isnâ€™t a love failure?

1126
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,250
There is failure behind every
successful love story.

1127
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,333
We should get depressed about it.

1128
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,959
We should try to come out of it.

1129
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,333
Listen to me and come out of it, bro.

1130
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:54,333
Hey! It is so hard to understand these girls.

1131
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,375
They confuse us a lot.

1132
01:09:57,625 --> 01:10:00,792
I like you so much...
I want this lifelong.

1133
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:04,875
Time just passes by when I am with you.
They ask us not to miss them in life.

1134
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:08,583
We imagine a life and
have dreams with them.

1135
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:12,208
She says that she loves a guy
in her dreams.

1136
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,291
The funny thing is that
she didnâ€™t even see him till now.

1137
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,583
Who says that?

1138
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:20,041
It is easy to find the depth of this ocean.

1139
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:23,250
But, we can never deeply understand a girl.

1140
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:26,542
- There is a lot of confusion.
- All girls are like that, bro.

1141
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,208
They get close to us at the beginning.

1142
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,834
We imagine a life with them
and have expectations.

1143
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,625
We dream about them having a colorful life.

1144
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,458
But, they will find someone else.

1145
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,291
Our life remains black and white.

1146
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:39,041
Iâ€™ve seen a lot like this in my village.

1147
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,291
Hey.

1148
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:44,708
He is already frustratedâ€¦
If you keep talking about your villageâ€¦

1149
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:46,708
Iâ€™ll break a bottle on your head.

1150
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,875
Hey, bro. This is the fact.

1151
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,208
Girls might take some time to say I love you.

1152
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,667
They never have second thoughts
about breaking up.

1153
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,500
You are right.

1154
01:10:57,125 --> 01:11:00,000
It's okay if she rejects after
you propose her.

1155
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:03,417
But, she indirectly said No
without even proposing.

1156
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:05,208
What should we call it?

1157
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:06,917
It is fate... Fate!

1158
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:11,583
We endured Tsunami, hudhud
and even denomination.

1159
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:14,208
How can we bear a broken heart?

1160
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:16,417
I told you earlier.

1161
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,792
Things like that in love are common.

1162
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:21,375
You have to be practical and move forward.

1163
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:25,041
It will turn out like this if you wait
for her to express and do something.

1164
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,875
But, she is not like every other girl.

1165
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,708
She is very good and she likes me a lot.

1166
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:34,875
But, I do not understand
why she does like that.

1167
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:38,750
I have a feeling that she talks
like that to make fun of me.

1168
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:42,750
You still have a positive feeling
about her.

1169
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,875
I donâ€™t understand if it is
your innocence or foolishness.

1170
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:48,041
We should care about love and all.

1171
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,583
We should wake up, go outside and perform errands

1172
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,375
and have fun in the evening.

1173
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,750
Have few drinks. Everything will be all right.

1174
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:56,333
Drink it.

1175
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,333
Alcohol cannot calm me.

1176
01:11:58,625 --> 01:11:59,667
Hey!

1177
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:03,250
Like in old movie â€˜Devadasâ€™ and in latest movie â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™â€¦.

1178
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,750
Alcohol heals lovers.

1179
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:16,583
There wonâ€™t alcohol and that girl in my life from today.

1180
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,208
Thatâ€™s it.

1181
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,625
So, this is what I say about girls.

1182
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:37,583
â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€

1183
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,291
â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€

1184
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:47,625
â€œMy pulse rate is far beyond normalâ€

1185
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,917
â€œMy body weight falls graduallyâ€

1186
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,667
â€œWith the charm in her eyesâ€

1187
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,834
â€œShe locked me upâ€

1188
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,291
â€œWith her lovable talks,
She walks away from meâ€

1189
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,000
â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€

1190
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:09,083
â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€

1191
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:40,625
â€œIt is Lord Brahmaâ€™s faultâ€

1192
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:45,041
â€œFor giving her such beautyâ€

1193
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:49,375
â€œPeople are gentle on outsideâ€

1194
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:54,041
â€œNo words can describe the intensityâ€

1195
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:58,458
â€œNever fall in love, my friendâ€

1196
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:03,125
â€œHave a drink and walk
your pet to be goodâ€

1197
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:05,750
â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€

1198
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:10,291
â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€

1199
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:42,500
â€œTheyâ€™re never clear with what they sayâ€

1200
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,708
â€œTheir words keep changingâ€

1201
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:50,834
â€œThey welcome us into their lifeâ€

1202
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:55,166
â€œOur life becomes a nightmareâ€

1203
01:14:55,875 --> 01:15:00,041
â€œThey make us crazy with their tricksâ€

1204
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:04,875
â€œThey say weâ€™re just friends
when we propose.â€

1205
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,333
â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€

1206
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:11,875
â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€

1207
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,875
Why are you like that, Abhi?

1208
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,750
Why donâ€™t you say something?

1209
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:10,208
Serve some chutney.

1210
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:12,333
He never says anything properly.

1211
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,291
Tell me now.

1212
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:33,041
Okay... Tell dad that Iâ€™ll go to office
from today.

1213
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:35,417
Is that the reason for your expression?

1214
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:37,083
Why? Wonâ€™t you tell him?

1215
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,708
No, dear. You can tell him directly.

1216
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:43,458
You tell his words to me.
Wonâ€™t you tell him mine?

1217
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,375
Okayâ€¦I will tell him.

1218
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,792
- Have green tea.
- Thank you.

1219
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:52,875
Did you add sugar?

1220
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,875
You went for jogging to reduce
your sugar levels.

1221
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,458
Is it needed?

1222
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,834
Donâ€™t get shocked but
there is good news for you.

1223
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,959
Abhi decided to come to the office.

1224
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:04,875
What is this sudden change?

1225
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,667
- He should know that.
- I suspect this.

1226
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:10,208
Why are you discussing
when I said that Iâ€™d come to office?

1227
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,667
You ask me to come when I donâ€™t want to
and you are questioning me now.

1228
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:14,625
- Are you coming to office or not?
- I will not come.

1229
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:16,542
- I am going.
- Abhi.

1230
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:18,792
Today is Sunday.

1231
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,291
I will go anyway.

1232
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,583
Your son goes to office on Sundays.

1233
01:17:58,625 --> 01:17:59,792
Hi.

1234
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:02,000
What happened?

1235
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,917
Tell me what happened.

1236
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:09,375
Abhi is avoiding me.

1237
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:13,333
I donâ€™t know what happened.

1238
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:17,083
He doesn't answer my calls.

1239
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:20,291
He goes away when we see each other.

1240
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,750
Why?

1241
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:24,750
I donâ€™t know.

1242
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,458
I already told you that guys are dangerous.

1243
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,000
Even they donâ€™t know how they behave.

1244
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:31,917
Okay. Leave it.

1245
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,083
I want to talk to Abhi.

1246
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:37,125
Okayâ€¦ Donâ€™t get emotional.
I will call Satya.

1247
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:46,041
See! Son-in-law is awesome.

1248
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,166
You achieved your goal, son-in-law.

1249
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,583
You are great.

1250
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,834
I knew about his talent earlier.

1251
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:54,500
Thatâ€™s your affection, uncle.

1252
01:18:54,959 --> 01:18:58,125
My father dreamed about me getting
into software field.

1253
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,000
Did your father wanted you
to get into software back in those days?

1254
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:04,959
You fulfilled my fatherâ€™s dream.

1255
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,417
He will die if he finds the truth.

1256
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:10,458
Uncle! I have a doubt.
Were there computers back in those days?

1257
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:13,458
Yes. There were large systems.
Now theyâ€™re all tiny.

1258
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,500
He must have read about computers
in newspapers.

1259
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,750
Otherwise, how will he have
such knowledge?

1260
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:21,583
It has been ringing for so long.
Pick it up.

1261
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:22,959
It is from the office.

1262
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:25,667
I already told them that
Iâ€™ve got an alliance today.

1263
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,375
I asked them not to disturb me.

1264
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:30,125
They don't listen...
They canâ€™t work without me.

1265
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,083
Put a lemon in pockets
to stay away from evil.

1266
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:39,041
- Iâ€™ve got a pumpkin too.
- No. Both of your sizes are same.

1267
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,583
Uncle is being sarcastic.

1268
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:43,708
Call him.

1269
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:48,166
Why are they calling me so many times?

1270
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:56,625
Please... I have an alliance.

1271
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:00,375
- Shut up and come.
- Not possible... Letâ€™s meet later.

1272
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:02,750
Will you come or should I tell them
about your job?

1273
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:04,542
Oh my! No.

1274
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,792
My son-in-law knows all languages.

1275
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:09,625
I learned all as Iâ€™m into software.

1276
01:20:09,834 --> 01:20:11,708
- Oh.
- Oh.

1277
01:20:11,834 --> 01:20:13,333
By the way, who are they?

1278
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,166
They are my colleagues from office.

1279
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:17,166
The clients came from the US it seems.

1280
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,917
They want to meet me.

1281
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,500
I will be back.

1282
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:25,667
- Why did you come?
- Why did you disconnect my call?

1283
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:27,375
I have an alliance. Canâ€™t you see?

1284
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,083
- Shut up and come.
- Come out.

1285
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,083
What is it?

1286
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:34,166
Why is he avoiding Ankitha?

1287
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,291
Is it?

1288
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,583
I donâ€™t know what she did to him.

1289
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,708
I didn't do anything, Satya.

1290
01:20:39,959 --> 01:20:43,375
Abhi was playing with coke tin
and I kicked it.

1291
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,375
He got angry for that.
- Really?

1292
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:47,375
Did he get angry
for this small issue?

1293
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:50,041
Heâ€™s getting angry for every small thing.

1294
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,583
He gets angry for everything.
He doesnâ€™t pick my calls either.

1295
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:55,083
- Stop this nonsense.
- This fatso is here.

1296
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:57,000
I am screwed now.

1297
01:20:57,291 --> 01:21:00,917
Tell him to pick up the call.
Otherwise, I'll tell them about you.

1298
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,125
- Son-in-law!
- Yeah... Heâ€™s annoying me.

1299
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,000
Hey! Jyothi and Ankitha
came to my house yesterday.

1300
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,542
Why did they come?

1301
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:16,417
They want to speak with you.

1302
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:19,000
Hey! Leave it...
I donâ€™t want to talk.

1303
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:22,000
She doesnâ€™t understand my value
because I am after her.

1304
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:24,834
She has something in mind
by saying something else.

1305
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:26,667
I cannot sustain her acting.

1306
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:29,625
Hey! Poor thing! Talk to her once.
She came this far.

1307
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,041
Leave it.

1308
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,667
- Tell him.
- Why donâ€™t you talk to her once?

1309
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,792
What are you thinking?

1310
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,708
What is the matter?

1311
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:53,083
I am unable to forget Ankitha.

1312
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:58,542
I say that I want to forget her
but my heart doesnâ€™t want to.

1313
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:02,291
She knew that Iâ€™d express my love to her.

1314
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,208
So, she said about her love in dreams.

1315
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,250
I havenâ€™t loved anyone till now.

1316
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,417
Why did I love her?

1317
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,250
Why am I thinking about her so much?

1318
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,291
I thought that Ankitha loved me
as much as I loved her.

1319
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,125
Hey! I didnâ€™t expect you
to be serious about love.

1320
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,583
Iâ€™m touched when I see your emotion.

1321
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:31,542
Not just me...
Even my friends are feeling bad.

1322
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,375
Not just my friends...
Everyone is feeling bad.

1323
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:35,667
What?

1324
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,500
Only you, my friends and me knew this, right?

1325
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:41,917
Your feeling is good.

1326
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,250
So, I started a live video on Facebook.

1327
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,917
Oh no!..

1328
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:50,500
This is bad... I am feeling sad
and you post it on Facebook.

1329
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,583
Hey. See this.

1330
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,500
So many likes and comments.

1331
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:58,166
Hey! Donâ€™t you worry about me?

1332
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,291
You make it public.

1333
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:02,542
You are enjoying comments, right?

1334
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:05,500
Nice! I came to share my feelings with you.

1335
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,333
But, you post it on Facebook.

1336
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:10,750
All right! Everyone is worried
everyone is selfish about being happy.

1337
01:23:10,959 --> 01:23:13,000
Life is full of likes and dislikes.

1338
01:23:13,959 --> 01:23:15,875
He will never understand me.

1339
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:39,834
Is this an AD film?

1340
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:42,750
For you to follow me and I follow you.

1341
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:45,375
Why are you talking like that, Abhi?

1342
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,041
Donâ€™t you know why?

1343
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:51,667
Is it why I spoke something that day
which was boring?

1344
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:57,750
Is it why because I kicked
the coke tin another day?

1345
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:00,375
How can you be so innocent?

1346
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,500
Please donâ€™t say that, Abhi.
Why are you like that?

1347
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:07,417
- Tell me, Abhi... Please.
- Hey.

1348
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:12,125
I am feeling bad.

1349
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,959
Why are you avoiding me?

1350
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,375
Donâ€™t you know what I feel?

1351
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,375
I am so happy when I am with you.

1352
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:24,375
I can share anything with you...
You are close to my heart.

1353
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:27,125
I cannot stay without talking to you or see you.

1354
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:30,041
You say everything but act
as if thereâ€™s nothing.

1355
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:33,125
I donâ€™t understand
what your problem is.

1356
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,041
You know everything.

1357
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:38,792
You know what I feel.
You know what I want to say.

1358
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,000
Why do you behave like this?

1359
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:44,166
I really donâ€™t know.

1360
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,375
Is it? Leave it.

1361
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:49,875
Stop calling me and donâ€™t come after me.

1362
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:52,917
There is nothing between us.
Forget me. Please.

1363
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,500
Abhi.

1364
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:13,750
- What happened?
- Sheâ€™s like this after coming home.

1365
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:16,000
- What happened, dear?
- Ankitha.

1366
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,083
Look at daddy...
What happened, dear?

1367
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:19,792
- Look at me.
- What happened?

1368
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,667
Did someone misbehave with you?

1369
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,375
Let her take rest for 5 minutes...
Sheâ€™ll become normal.

1370
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,458
I will be right backâ€¦
Donâ€™t worry.

1371
01:25:58,917 --> 01:25:59,750
Hi.

1372
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,166
Sit.

1373
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,667
Uncle! Why did you call me?

1374
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:10,458
I donâ€™t know what happened
between you and Ankitha.

1375
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,500
Ankitha is very upset.

1376
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,875
I should tell something about her.

1377
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:17,917
This wasnâ€™t shared with anyone
except our family.

1378
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,291
But, I am telling you becauseâ€¦

1379
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:25,750
â€¦Ankitha is happy with just the way
sheâ€™s happy with us.

1380
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,291
I have observed that many times.

1381
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,792
There is a risk to her life if there is any
negative reaction from your side.

1382
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:37,875
We went to Annavaram
on Ankithaâ€™s 13th birthday.

1383
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:42,000
- Hey.
- Yayâ€¦

1384
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,542
Reduce the volume. Please.

1385
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,542
Stop.

1386
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:02,875
You should not do that
when weâ€™re on highway.

1387
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,333
See thereâ€¦

1388
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,083
Wow.

1389
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,000
That is why I told you.

01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,667
How long will it take for her to recover?

1396
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:07,041
Prasad... It's hard to say
when she will get out of coma.

1397
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,792
Ankitha will be safe, right?
- She is safe.

1398
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,750
She will recover soon.

1399
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:33,291
Ankitha! â€œHappy birthday to youâ€

See...

1401
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:37,917
I bought your favorite teddy bear for you.

1402
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:48,417
You wanted a bicycle, right?

1403
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,041
We bought that tooâ€¦
Not just thatâ€¦

1404
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:53,875
We bought a big LED TV.

1405
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:59,333
You can watch your favorite
cartoon channel.

Let us all go to the States.

1409

After you come home.

1410
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:16,875
Okay?

1411
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:23,250
Ankitha is responding to the treatment.

1412
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,834
I am sure that she will get well soon.

1413
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:44,333
How long will you be like this keeping
everything aside?

1414
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,000
You are an engineer.

1415
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,625
How long will you be like this
without caring about your future?

1416
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:50,542
We will take care of her.

1417
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:53,375
Nothing is more important
than my daughter.

1418
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:55,583
Ankitha is my life.

1419
01:30:59,792 --> 01:31:03,250
It gives utmost joy to see our kids grow.

1420
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:09,417
But, to watch them grow
on a hospital bed is scary.

1421
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,792
That sorrow is inexpressible.

1422
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:58,708
Ankitha is out of coma after 7 years.

1423
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:01,417
My life is back after seeing her.

1424
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:06,750
Doctor said that Ankitha has
recovered completely.

1425
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,875
But, there was some disturbance
in my heart.

1426
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,542
Dad!

1427
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:17,542
Where am I?

1428
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,875
Ankitha was angry and silent ever
since we came to this house.

1429
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,917
She couldnâ€™t recognize anyone
except her mother and me.

1430
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,708
She spent most of her time alone.

1431
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:36,792
She had major head injury on left side
in the accident.

1432
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:41,500
Her nervous system got damaged
and she lost her memory.

1433
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:48,125
She can recognize her parents, but she forgot her past.

1434
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:52,000
Because her brain can only
think to some extent.

1435
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:56,625
She might be matured at times
and childish otherwise.

1436
01:32:57,208 --> 01:33:00,291
She wonâ€™t have strength to control herself.

1437
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:06,667
She cannot think too much or feel bad.

1438
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:09,166
She might go back to coma
if she does that.

1439
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:13,250
Itâ€™s okay for her to rememberâ€¦
But if we stress her about pastâ€¦

1440
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:17,792
Her brain might get stressed
which is a risk to her life.

1441
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,208
You should always keep her happy.

1442
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:24,417
You should encourage her in everything
and be supportive.

1443
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:26,542
That will be very helpful for her.

1444
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,041
It took time for her to recover.

1445
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:35,959
After meeting you,

01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:42,667

Please do not hurt her.

01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:50,458
I will console if thereâ€™s any mistake
from her side.

01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,667
But, if something happens to herâ€¦

01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:56,250
I cannot take it.

like I was before.

I recognized you because of Abhi.

1558
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:03,417
You taught me painting and
helped me to find Kiran.

1559
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:04,750
Thanks, bro.

1560
01:44:04,834 --> 01:44:09,875
I would not know what Ankitha feels
if it wasnâ€™t that painting.

1561
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:13,542
So, I taught you painting...

1562
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:17,208
and you screwed me.

1563
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:23,000
Get upâ€¦ Iâ€™m talking to you.

01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:24,875
- Get up!

She asked me to teach painting
and I taught her.

She drew something and you appeared.

01:44:35,417 --> 01:44:36,667
Abhi! What happened?

1570
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:38,583
If you come when she paints,

1571
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,375
What should I do?

1572
01:44:40,708 --> 01:44:42,542
Hey! I love her.

1573
01:44:42,792 --> 01:44:44,792
I will spend all life looking at her.

1574
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:47,917
Hey! She introduced you
as her dream boy.

1575
01:44:48,041 --> 01:44:49,542
Should I give my blessing
for your weddingâ€¦?

1576
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:53,542

01:45:02,333 --> 01:45:03,792
Were you dreaming?

Didnâ€™t you remember me at least once?

weâ€™ve decided earlier.

We can both go to the States
if the wedding happens before that.

1695

Wedding suddenly?

1732
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:47,291
Are you not feeling sad?

1733
01:52:50,458 --> 01:52:53,708
Why will I feel bad
when you get married, Ankitha?

1734
01:52:57,458 --> 01:53:00,959
Then, why are you so dull?

1735

You see that I am sad but

But, your wedding sounds
breathless to me.

1739

We wonâ€™t meet after the wedding.

after wedding.

the wedding...

02:05:22,041 --> 02:05:23,542
I want Ankitha, dad.

1905
02:05:23,625 --> 02:05:25,708
I tried to tell her many times
about my love.

1906
02:05:25,917 --> 02:05:27,458
But, I couldnâ€™t say.

1907
02:05:28,083 --> 02:05:29,834
I cannot live without her.

1908
02:05:31,166 --> 02:05:32,792
I want Ankitha.

1909
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:10,917
â€œDeep in my heart, thereâ€™s a woundâ€

1910
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:16,333
â€œSomething that canâ€™t be expressed
is this loveâ€

1911
02:06:16,834 --> 02:06:21,667
â€œYouâ€™ve become my lifeâ€

1912
02:06:22,291 --> 02:06:27,250
â€œEven if this journey is indefiniteâ€

1913
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:32,708
â€œMy silence is never heardâ€

1914
02:06:33,417 --> 02:06:38,291
â€œNo one breaks that silenceâ€

1915
02:06:38,959 --> 02:06:43,959
â€œI am with you while I think of youâ€

1916
02:06:44,333 --> 02:06:49,375
â€œI am not with me while I think of youâ€

1917
02:06:49,959 --> 02:06:54,917
â€œYou are in me while I think of youâ€

1918
02:06:55,375 --> 02:07:00,458
â€œIâ€™m left alone while I think of youâ€

1919
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,917
â€œDeep in my heart, thereâ€™s a woundâ€

1920
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:11,417
â€œSomething that canâ€™t be expressed is this loveâ€

1921
02:07:11,959 --> 02:07:16,542
â€œI think of youâ€¦"
[HUMMING]

1922
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:22,667
â€œI think of youâ€¦"
[HUMMING]

1923
02:07:22,959 --> 02:07:28,000
â€œYou are in me while I think of youâ€

1924
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:33,583
â€œIâ€™m left alone while I think of youâ€

1925
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:01,834
Love doesnâ€™t happen when
we think of it or plan for it.

1926
02:08:02,417 --> 02:08:04,125
Love happens only once.

1927
02:08:04,708 --> 02:08:08,708
Love will remain even if we lose our life.

1928
02:08:09,625 --> 02:08:11,166
Ineffable love!

1929
02:08:12,041 --> 02:08:13,792
Intolerable sorrow!

1930
02:08:14,083 --> 02:08:15,542
I hold it in my heart.

1931
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:19,083
One second, one hour, one dayâ€¦

1932
02:08:19,208 --> 02:08:20,458
One yearâ€¦

1933
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:23,834
Let it be any longer.
I will think about her as long as I live.

1934
02:08:25,542 --> 02:08:28,000
With her memories and for her loveâ€¦

1935
02:08:29,125 --> 02:08:31,417
This waitingâ€¦it canâ€™t be expressed
in words.

1936
02:09:19,417 --> 02:09:21,667
After knowing that you my dream boy,

1937
02:09:22,834 --> 02:09:24,834
my love should increase.

1938
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:27,583
But, I donâ€™t have that feeling for you.

1939
02:09:28,083 --> 02:09:30,458
Did I really love you, Kiran?

1940
02:09:30,834 --> 02:09:35,166
I loved you in my dream.

1941
02:09:35,917 --> 02:09:39,708
I am unable to love you like that
when you are here.

1942
02:09:44,083 --> 02:09:48,208
I havenâ€™t felt that love I expected from you.

1943
02:09:49,125 --> 02:09:51,125
I donâ€™t feel it in me either.

1944
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,375
You are the one in my dream.

1945
02:09:55,959 --> 02:10:00,583
But, my heart is confused.

1946
02:10:05,333 --> 02:10:06,542
Why?

1947
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:11,542
Why am I not able to love you
as I loved in my dream?

1948
02:10:12,208 --> 02:10:17,458
If I donâ€™t tell you that I love Abhi,

1949
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:22,834
I should suffer lifelong for doing
this mistake.

1950
02:10:23,458 --> 02:10:25,792
I can't marry you.

1951
02:10:27,125 --> 02:10:28,458
I am sorry.

1952
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:38,792
Dad!

1953
02:10:39,583 --> 02:10:41,041
Am I doing wrong?

1954
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:45,542
You gave it a thought and decided
what you want.

1955
02:10:46,125 --> 02:10:50,041
I am so happy to see my daughter like this.

1956
02:10:50,875 --> 02:10:53,750
My daughter says everything to me
like a kid.

1957
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:57,083
She told me what she wants
for the first time.

1958
02:10:58,125 --> 02:11:02,959
Any father feels bad when his daughter
denies to get married at the wedding atrium.

1959
02:11:05,291 --> 02:11:07,959
But, I am feeling very happy.

1960
02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:13,250
Keeping aside the denial of this wedding,

1961
02:11:13,917 --> 02:11:18,125
As a father, my daughter is important to me.

1962
02:11:18,834 --> 02:11:23,250
Not only me. His daughter is important to any father.

1963
02:11:23,917 --> 02:11:25,875
Her happiness is important.

1964
02:11:28,917 --> 02:11:33,834
My daughter clarified that she loves Abhi
and that she live happily with Abhi.

1965
02:11:35,542 --> 02:11:38,125
I respect my daughterâ€™s decision.

1966
02:11:38,667 --> 02:11:40,500
My daughter is never wrong.

1967
02:11:42,125 --> 02:11:43,875
You are never wrong, dear.

1968
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:46,458
You will not.

1969
02:12:40,875 --> 02:12:42,000
Abhi!

1970
02:12:42,792 --> 02:12:44,041
Abhi.

1971
02:12:49,125 --> 02:12:51,417
Ankitha! What are doing here?

1972
02:12:53,041 --> 02:12:54,625
Do you know Abhi?

1973
02:12:55,458 --> 02:13:00,083
I am lost in your thoughts always.

1974
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,583
It is true, Abhi.

1975
02:13:03,125 --> 02:13:06,333
I cannot live without you, Abhi.

1976
02:13:11,875 --> 02:13:16,208
It makes me sad knowing
that I will miss you.

1977
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:21,834
I am so happy when I am with you.

1978
02:13:24,875 --> 02:13:29,333
I want to be with like this forever.

1979
02:13:30,166 --> 02:13:31,834
It is true, Abhi.

1980
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:39,041
I thought that the one I loved
is in my dream.

1981
02:13:39,917 --> 02:13:44,708
But, the one I love is in my heart.

1982
02:13:45,458 --> 02:13:47,208
He is standing in front of me.

1983
02:13:47,291 --> 02:13:48,792
Thatâ€™s you!

1984
02:13:54,375 --> 02:13:59,542
Abhi! Havenâ€™t you felt that love
for me at least once?

1985
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:02,959
Not just once.

1986
02:14:03,917 --> 02:14:09,291
I felt that every time my heart beats
from the day I saw you.

1987
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,375
I loved you at first sight.

1988
02:14:15,625 --> 02:14:18,041
You are the love of my life, Ankitha.

1989
02:14:18,959 --> 02:14:22,083
I tried to express my love
every time I meet you.

1990
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:23,750
But, I couldnâ€™t say it.

1991
02:14:24,041 --> 02:14:26,000
Now, I am telling you.
I love you.

1992
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:28,000
I love you forever and ever.

1993
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:33,917
I love you, Ankitha.

1994
02:14:34,125 --> 02:14:36,041
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1995
02:14:51,208 --> 02:14:56,375
â€˜Ankitha may not know that the one
she loved then and now is Abhi.â€™

1996
02:14:56,583 --> 02:14:58,917
â€˜But, her heart knows it.â€™

1997
02:14:59,583 --> 02:15:02,500
â€˜Heart never forgets true love.â€™

1998
02:15:03,208 --> 02:15:06,917
â€˜Love is a wonder in this beautiful world.â€™

1999
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:11,417
â€˜Love has troubles and sorrows
along with happiness.â€™

2000
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:19,250
â€˜Beyond all that, Love should remain
as a good memory in our heart and life.â€™

2001
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:36,333
Bike is easier than bicycle.

2002
02:15:41,291 --> 02:15:43,834
What would you do if I leave?

2003
02:15:44,166 --> 02:15:46,291
I will wait until you come back.

2004
02:15:46,542 --> 02:15:47,750
Okayâ€¦

2005
02:15:49,417 --> 02:15:50,875
Whatâ€™s next?
