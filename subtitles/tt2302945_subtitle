1
00:01:58,498 --> 00:01:59,897
Hey, catch him!

2
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,900
get him...

3
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,198
Be careful.

4
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,502
Run, you loser

5
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,378
Savjidada (Brother Savji)

6
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,283
Where's Tuka?

7
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,854
We can't find him

8
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,462
Hey...

9
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,539
There's Tuka

10
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,419
Hey, Tuka.

11
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,261
Hey, Tuka.

12
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:38,458
Tuka, is Vishnu telling the truth?

13
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,227
You hugged God Pandurang?

14
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,298
Answer me

15
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,768
I didn't; he hugged me

16
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,966
You are lying.
Should I give you a shock?

17
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,804
We were playing tip and run

18
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,743
With whom?
With your friends or the God?

19
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,939
You bad boy...

20
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,415
We'll be cursed

21
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,418
Your father's gone on the annual
pilgrimage to seek His blessings

22
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:00,646
And here you're committing sins

23
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,315
Daughter-in-law, don't beat the child

24
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,757
The Lord has no duplicity

25
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,555
Don't cover up for Tuka

26
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,495
On the pilgrimage,
thieves rob travelers

27
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,731
SomItimes, wolves attack and kill them

28
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,366
These things happen when one sins

29
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,737
Oh Lord...

30
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,173
Mother, mother...

31
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:28,140
Lord Vitthal (Pandurang),
forgive the boy

32
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:31,210
let his father rIturn safely

33
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,948
Mother, Vitthal has
never scolded me. I promise!

34
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,814
Go away; Go get lost forever...

35
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,433
Why is Chandri (the cow) mooing?

36
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,164
She's looking for her calf

37
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,804
Savji, where is the calf?

38
00:04:57,243 --> 00:05:00,235
It was with Tuka.
You know it always follows him

39
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,372
Where have they gone now, at dusk?

40
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,343
You're always lost in your own world

41
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,113
Where are Tuka and the calf?

42
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:13,249
Uncle, come with me.
We'll look for them

43
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,351
Why don't you go too?

44
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:25,495
Mother, there's our calf

45
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:31,374
Yes, it's ours.
It's looking bewildered

46
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,735
come, let's go see

47
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,248
come here you...

48
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,743
My lettle darling.
So Tuka left you here?

49
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,822
Its me find him;
I'll beat him with a stick

50
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:50,759
My poor baby...

51
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,801
Hey, wait... wait.

52
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,598
Where are you going?

53
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,731
Wait... wait. Why are you running?

54
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,241
Tuka?

55
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,448
Tuka? What is this?

56
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:11,746
Tuka what happened?
- What is this, Tuka?

57
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,342
Tuka, don't be afraid. We're here

58
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,648
Who did this?

59
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:19,390
Tuka, why did you do this?

60
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:22,388
You told me to 'get lost forever'

61
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:25,260
That doesn't mean you
should bury yourself

62
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,300
When Santya's
grandfather died, they buried him

63
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:29,665
Isn't it brother Savji?

64
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:34,896
I must have been mad...
to ask my own son to go away forever

65
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,707
I'll never say that again... never!

66
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,311
My lettle kid!

67
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:47,478
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

68
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:51,354
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

69
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:54,882
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

70
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:58,692
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

71
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:02,667
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

72
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:06,433
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

73
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:12,240
Glory to the Gods Rama and Krishna...

74
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,812
Hundreds of devotees
singing in one rhythm

75
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,917
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

76
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:29,450
Walking mile after mile

77
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:33,196
The body refuses to tire

78
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:40,873
You chant vitthal's name and just
flow with the devotees to meIt him

79
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,136
father...

80
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,269
You mIt Vithoba?

81
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,846
Not 'mIt'... I visited the idol

82
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,179
let him sleep; he's tirred

83
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,683
But he just said that
the body doesn't tire

84
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,494
Oh, this boy! Come on, go to bed

85
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,532
Yes, come on
- get up, my child

86
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:12,131
And you rest a lettle tomorrow
- Okay

87
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,463
Saru, come on...

88
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,376
Oh Lord...

89
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:42,395
father... father...
- yes?

90
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,199
What Tuka?

91
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:49,367
Is our village Vitthal different
from the one in Pandharpur?

92
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,406
No, he's the same, my boy

93
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,538
Then why do you go there?

94
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,916
You can't even meIt him

95
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,486
Don't tell anyone...
- What?

96
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:02,487
I mIt the Vitthal in our village

97
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:05,251
Fine
- I'll even intrroduce you to him

98
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,736
Grinding grain at dawn

99
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:22,366
It's almost sunrise now

100
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:26,203
My God helps me

101
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,579
Wakes me up in time to milk the cows

102
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:35,878
I grind the grain

103
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:40,486
The soft flour falls

104
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:48,891
May God bless my dear son Savji

105
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:58,643
I grind the grain I am happy as I work

106
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,879
My lettle Lord
Krishna is asleep in my lap

107
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:13,417
My lettle Lord
Krishna is asleep in my lap

108
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:14,960
Saru, come here

109
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,723
So many people?

110
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:19,264
He's started his
money lending and trading

111
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,730
I told him to atleast rest for a day

112
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,666
But who listens to me? Go...

113
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,727
Carefully dear
- Yes

114
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:37,281
From Bolhoba Ambile,
District Pune, Village Dehu...

115
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,945
...Ghorpade Bhikaji, to buy a pair

116
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:44,485
of bullocks and farming instruments...

117
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:50,295
...has taken a loan of 25 gold
coins for a six-month period

118
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,895
If the loan is not paid
back within the time frame...

119
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:58,460
...an interest of 24% per
gold coin will be levied per month

120
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,871
That's too rmuch...
Laxmidas Savkar only charges%

121
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,341
Yes, but for how long?

122
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,743
You always do this, Bhikaji

123
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,809
The moment I stop to dip my pen in ink

124
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:15,581
You ask for a longer term,
lesser interest

125
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,588
Bhikaji, your debt bond is ready

126
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,920
Witnesses, give your thumb prints here

127
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,329
The junior
moneylender is learning fast

128
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:36,601
What about you, Marotrao?

129
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,167
I have two pieces of jewellery to pawn

130
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,443
I need 10 gold coins for a month

131
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,777
I need them today

132
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,583
Unless the jeweller evaluates them...

133
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,587
...I cannot accept valuables

134
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,917
come to the rmarrkItplace on Mon dayn

135
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,483
We'll get them evaluated

136
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,423
But I really need the money

137
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,257
Okay, fine

138
00:11:56,729 --> 00:12:00,187
Diwanji, make a draft of the
mortgage bond and give him the cash

139
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,427
I'm really grateful, Sir

140
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,637
Offering

141
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,781
How do you manage both money
lending and the annual pilgrimage?

142
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:22,279
One must know what to
sell and what not to

143
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,954
If someone offers a
sack full of money...

144
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,351
...would we sell the Lord's blessings?

145
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,156
No, never

146
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,896
Okay. I have a lot to people to meIt

147
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,489
Goodbye

148
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,797
Goodbye

149
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:47,770
Savji... still at worship?

150
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,611
Savji, Tuka... let's leave

151
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,920
I'll go meIt Mahadya
- Yes

152
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:57,387
It's bItter to warn
him before the attachment

153
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,213
And what about resting?

154
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:05,395
Tuka, come sit

155
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:12,265
Come on

156
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,442
Do it tomorrow, Aai (Mother)

157
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,644
I can't send you out
without a bracelet?

158
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,346
Else' people will think
our business is bankrupt

159
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:28,920
You must wear good clothes,
ear studs and a bracelet... Savji...

160
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:30,587
Then why doesn't Savji wear one?

161
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,214
He wants to be a fakir!

162
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,785
It's enough if he wears decent clothes

163
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,596
Shh... run off now

164
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,528
Mother, can I go too?
- Okay

165
00:13:55,848 --> 00:14:03,550
Hey Ganya, Ishnya, Tukya

166
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,921
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

167
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,620
Santu, Dama, Paka

168
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:10,286
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

169
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:11,523
Santu, Dama, Paka

170
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:12,757
Rama, Pandu, don't quarel

171
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,231
It's playn trrapstick

172
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,598
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

173
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:19,229
Santu, Dama, Paka

174
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:34,380
The stick's up in the air

175
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:41,416
The stick's up in the air

176
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,656
Catch it
- Catch it

177
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:49,793
come on, catch it

178
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:57,298
Spin like a top

179
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,674
Round and round

180
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,355
Round and round

181
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,891
You are a top; so am I

182
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,427
We all go round and round

183
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,190
On the tree, there's
a beehive that bites

184
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,562
Those bees are awesome

185
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,227
They visit all the flowers

186
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,702
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

187
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:28,365
Santu, Dama, Paka

188
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:29,635
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

189
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,835
Santu, Dama, Paka

190
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,241
Rama
- Pandu, don't fight

191
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,573
It's playn trrapstick

192
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:37,446
Ganya, Manya, Tuka, Santu, Dama, Paka

193
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:56,494
Plunder all you can

194
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:02,498
Precipitate Lord Rama's name

195
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,837
Or you will repent

196
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:12,716
After your life's gone

197
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:18,917
After your life's gone

198
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:24,561
Come on, get up Don't get tired

199
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,258
Drop some, pile up some

200
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,733
It's build these tiles

201
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,327
Drop some, pile up some

202
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,805
It's build these tiles

203
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,502
The tiles are ready

204
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,874
Lord Krishna's cows have run away

205
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,573
He plays the flute

206
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,208
He requests God

207
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,444
To find his cows

208
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,713
Hey heron, give me a cowrie

209
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,948
The prayer has worked

210
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:52,884
Now's our cowherd game

211
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,426
Oh Lord, the ball's coming at us

212
00:16:55,494 --> 00:17:00,158
It's hit each otherr with it

213
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,865
Hit him, and him!

214
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,363
The ball's in the water

215
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,631
It's all iurmp in

216
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:10,665
Ganya's brother is a crybaby

217
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,211
He cried and cried

218
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,577
He fell in the water

219
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,276
He cried and cried

220
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,819
He fell in the water

221
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:41,399
(Counting coins and dividing
a gold coin into smaller coins)

222
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,404
father

223
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,813
What?
- How much would this be?

224
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,316
F our pounds

225
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,478
What?
- F our pounds

226
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,347
And now?

227
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:00,586
Stop your questions.
I'm doing accounts.

228
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:09,463
But how can you tell?

229
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:15,538
I've grown up playing
with weights and measures

230
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,633
The weighing scale
is like a God for us

231
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,806
If we cheat, He'll never forgive us

232
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:26,542
We may hold the scale
But He's he one who balances it

233
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:33,855
father, wrhen wrill I start guessin g
corrrrectlyn? - Afterr you become old

234
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:35,450
When will I become old?

235
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:38,895
After your old man goes to heaven
- What!

236
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,866
Now don't ask me when your
old man will go to heaven?

237
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,768
What sort of ridiculous talk is this?

238
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,570
Go Tuka, go have breakfast

239
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,501
This boy's questions never cease

240
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,609
Savji, after counting the coins...

241
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:03,478
Instead of counting, he has
arranged them in Lord Vitthal's shape

242
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:07,689
My son, there's a time for
work and a time for worship

243
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,794
What will happen of this boy?

244
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:19,895
It Maniula Savii's wrife
come to live here

245
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,375
Then see how he transforms

246
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:24,904
When will she come here?

247
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,308
The coming full moon day

248
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:33,116
That's the message.
She's become a woman now

249
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:37,621
Thank the Lord!

250
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,924
I beg of you; don't throw the vessels

251
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,327
Please, don't throw them

252
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:46,830
Can you hearr me?

253
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:48,696
Please, don't throw them
- Oh, Lord! - Bring that here

254
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,463
Sir, I swear by my mother

255
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:53,232
There's not a grain
of cereal in the house

256
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:54,897
Please give us some time

257
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,732
Sir, look at this bracelet

258
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:03,171
So Mahadya, there's no grain...

259
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:07,885
...but your son wears a
silver bracelet. How come?

260
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,353
Sir, he found that while playing

261
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,185
Enough of your lies...

262
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:20,322
Give him the bracelet.
We don't want it

263
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,697
We don't want it!

264
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,201
My bracelet...

265
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,334
Two water jugs, one silver bracelet...

266
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,943
I don't know what people gain
by lying - Who?

267
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,310
Mahadya. He says he is in bad shape

268
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,589
And his son wears this bracelet

269
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:45,681
Show me

270
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,522
Are you making a list?

271
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:53,788
Tuka...
- Yes?

272
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,924
come here

273
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,773
Didn't you tell me you
dropped this in the river?

274
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,939
I lied
- Um?

275
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,711
I gave it to Vishnu

276
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,772
What for?

277
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,445
He's my friend

278
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,646
But a silver bracelet for friendship?

279
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,746
Did I have a gold one?

280
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,218
Thank God for that!

281
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,592
But why did you lie?

282
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:26,756
Mother, I won't lie again

283
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,594
I'm sorry

284
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,337
Go

285
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:39,237
father, if you knewr that
I gave vishnu this brracelet...

286
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:40,903
...Would you have taken it back?

287
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:43,941
Yes. Because until
our loan is paid back,

288
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,416
every grain in Vishnu's house...

289
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,715
...every piece of jewellery,
belongs to us

290
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,254
That's the agreement

291
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,540
A moneylender has no friends

292
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:12,877
father has been on
pilgrrirmage so manyn times

293
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,572
Ask him if he has mIt
orrd vitthal even on ce

294
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,815
Lord Vitthal was frightened

295
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,549
He thought it's some creditor come...

296
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,316
...to collect his
dues in a devotee's garb

297
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,688
No, Father is not like that

298
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:29,654
He has to be, Tuka

299
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,964
Because he has to feed us

300
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:38,863
We think we are rich because we
have pawned things from others

301
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:41,499
But that's not true

302
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,269
It's our stomachs that
are mortgaged to them

303
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,417
father, rmayn I give
that brracelet to vishnu?

304
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,478
Okay my child

305
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:02,122
I know you won't be
happy till you do so

306
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:10,660
Brother, look...

307
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:14,296
Vishnu, hey Vishnu...

308
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,840
Hey Vishnu...

309
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,936
Vishnu, come here

310
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:24,876
See this?

311
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,580
The bracelet. Take it

312
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,687
I've asked my father

313
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:30,779
Take it

314
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,814
I don't want your bracelet

315
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,283
A money lender's son is
a cheat... just like him

316
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:38,828
You give with one hand and
take back with the other

317
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:40,725
I don't want this

318
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:07,082
The beloved
daughter-in-law wants to eat a sweIt

319
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:12,029
In a gold and silver bowl

320
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:16,600
Your hair's long like a snake's coil

321
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:21,401
The neighbours have
gathered to see you

322
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:26,437
The bond of marriage The
body's scent of sandalwood

323
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:31,814
The scent of sandalwood Take
care of the house, my girl

324
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:36,911
I'll give my dear girl a lovely name

325
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:38,752
Anklets on her feIt

326
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:41,622
Armlets with lettle bells

327
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,587
The lettle sifting fan murmurs

328
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:46,529
As it stands against the wall

329
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:51,262
She's matured now She blushes,
my dear girl!

330
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:55,898
She's matured now She blushes,
my dear girl!

331
00:25:52,331 --> 00:26:02,866
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

332
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:07,301
Come wind or hail,
the goods must not be damaged

333
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,505
Yes

334
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,608
Savji, this is for the
wedding in Deshmukh's family

335
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:17,911
Bidwai has asked us to
send these spices as a gift

336
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:21,624
Bidwai is the chief of the markIt
and Deshmukh is the village head

337
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:24,560
So this job must be perfect

338
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,226
When you get there, greIt
Mr. Deshmukh and introduce yourself

339
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:32,828
Tell him that Ambilemerrchant
From ehu village has sent spices

340
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,805
Have you understood?
- Yes

341
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,773
Have this for lunch
- Okay

342
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,936
And tap your stick as you walk

343
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,310
There are snakes and scorpions
- Yes

344
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:47,143
See! Manjula (his wife) has arrived
and he's become a responsible man

345
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,268
He's quite a strapping
lad Neither blind nor deaf

346
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,435
Four donkeyns just disappearr before him

347
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,172
How can we believe that story?

348
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:16,336
I'll compensate you

349
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:19,907
What compensation? This isn't
something I had pawned to you

350
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,816
They were live donkeys

351
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:24,412
They bore burdens to feed my family

352
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:28,259
Look, rrelax. Theyn rmust have got lost

353
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:29,624
They'll be back by morning

354
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,391
Are they kids to get lost?

355
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,529
By now, thieves must have
stolen them and sold them off

356
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:38,801
forget the ifs an d buts

357
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:40,835
Take these two gold coins

358
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:42,703
And let's close this matter
- But...

359
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,708
I, Bolhoba Ambile...

360
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,474
...beg for your forgiveness

361
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,679
Such a big boy can't
even look after donkeys

362
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,721
I'm supposed to be
satisfied with two gold coins

363
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,187
What's the use?

364
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,726
So you've ruined my reputation?

365
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:10,528
You made your father apologise
to a man who tends to donkeys

366
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,171
I suppose you were in heavenly bliss

367
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,440
Or do you think you're a saint?

368
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,207
My child, losing oneself
in worship and prayer...

369
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:27,774
...is meant for older
people like us, not for you?

370
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:32,588
Now do you want me to start
delivering spices from door to door?

371
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,489
And how do I face the Bidwai?

372
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,187
What do I tell him?

373
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:41,926
Now, I'll start delivering the
spices and collecting the dues myself

374
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,627
You sit here and pray

375
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,663
come have your lun ch

376
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,637
I don't want lunch

377
00:28:56,915 --> 00:29:00,214
Tuka, come here

378
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,090
come

379
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:14,090
Now you are big enough

380
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,296
From tormorrrrowr,
you wrill ioin your father in his wrorrk

381
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,271
What?
- Yes

382
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,469
Go bow to the deity

383
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,610
Time passes, the years go by

384
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:36,885
The days of childhood are over

385
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,887
Time passes, the years go by

386
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,718
The days of childhood are over

387
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,457
He's a grown-up man now

388
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,795
Busy with his life

389
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,427
He's a grown-up man now

390
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,937
Busy with his life

391
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:56,639
The heart is restless

392
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,336
Relationships beckon

393
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,777
On the threshold, under the awning

394
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:04,372
The tinkle of bangles

395
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:09,386
The vine clings to the roof

396
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:14,551
The hand waves goodbye

397
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:19,290
It's time to leave for work

398
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:24,601
Time to make a living

399
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:29,572
It's time to leave for work

400
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:34,810
Time to make a living

401
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,644
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

402
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,946
Santu, Dama, Paka

403
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:42,816
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

404
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:44,879
Santu, Dama, Paka

405
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,815
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

406
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,657
Santu, Dama, Paka

407
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,599
Music in their hearts

408
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,866
And prosperity in their lives

409
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,341
Music in their hearts

410
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,844
And prosperity in their lives

411
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,473
It's the same route as before

412
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,915
Profit, loss and earning money

413
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:15,516
There are both highs and lows

414
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,919
The measure does the counting

415
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:22,660
The deal is based on integrity

416
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:25,792
The deal is based on integrity

417
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,458
The wind carries the word

418
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:32,663
It's an honest life

419
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:38,966
We are ready to even conquer the Sun

420
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:43,976
It's time to leave for work

421
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:49,413
Time to make a living

422
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,887
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

423
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:54,289
Santu, Dama, Paka

424
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,919
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

425
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:59,293
Santu, Dama, Paka

426
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,192
Ganya, Manya, Tuka

427
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:04,792
Santu, Dama, Paka

428
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:08,566
Rakhma?
- She's not well

429
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,256
Rakhma
- Yes

430
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,433
Why are you doing this?

431
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:41,363
As it is, my asthma
treatment is expensive

432
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,805
I believe that doctor from
Pune charged two gold coins

433
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:48,637
This is not your
parents' home (We can afford it)

434
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,647
I'd have paid him
even more if necessary

435
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,945
You are the
daughter-in-law of a rich moneylender

436
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,552
You just be happy and
cheerful when I rIturn home

437
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:17,267
Tuka, Appa and Parvati have a grandson

438
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:19,867
Great! Haven't they sent any sweIts?

439
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,812
And SeIta's
daughter-in-law is expecting

440
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:25,213
So is that my fault?

441
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:27,678
No, it's our fault!

442
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,513
Wherever we go...

443
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,720
...we have to hang our heads in shame

444
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:36,420
If people get grandchildren,
why are you ashamed?

445
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:39,321
How long can I bask in their joy?

446
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,792
Your grandmother died before
seeing her great- grandchild

447
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,562
Aai(Mother), let's not bring that up

448
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:53,377
And there's nothing shameful
about Rakhma not bearing a child

449
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:57,412
What about my elder brother
who's not being a good husband?

450
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:22,902
You can't just joke and
avoid what your mother is saying

451
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:29,245
To take care of a huge business
like ours, we must have heirs

452
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:34,410
Also, nobody's asking
you to abandon Rakhma

453
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,617
If the first wife is childless,
you can marry another.

454
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:38,781
That's the custom

455
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:45,319
Some decisions may seem
harsh but they have to be tackled

456
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,756
I don't think that's necessary as yIt

457
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,611
Rakhma

458
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,314
What on earth are you up to?

459
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,221
Not eating,
not taking your medicines...

460
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,350
Why do this?

461
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:20,289
Your health will
only dIteriorate further

462
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:32,505
What's wrong Rakhma?

463
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:37,473
Rakhma?

464
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,180
Are you really worried about me?

465
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:46,255
You really want me to get well?

466
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,523
You know that I don't fake anything

467
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,889
You see my suffering

468
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:55,363
But not my inner grief

469
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:03,430
Medicines only work if
the mind is at peace

470
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,608
I'm having sleepless nights

471
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,547
What do I get well for?

472
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,579
To see my in-laws' sorrow?

473
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,156
I am unable to give them a grandchild

474
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:26,659
And you stubbornly
refuse to get a second wife

475
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:38,208
Do you think I'll be
angry if you do that?

476
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,606
Or that I'll lose my
position in this house?

477
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,176
Am I that weak?

478
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:48,581
Don't you have faith in yourself?

479
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,321
You may have a second or third wife

480
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,449
But in your heart...

481
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:56,653
...will anyone be able
to take my top spot?

482
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:04,860
You will never push her on a swing

483
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,703
So why would I be angry?

484
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,365
You think only you alone have grown up

485
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,602
I've also grown up with you

486
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,339
listen to me...
accept Gulve moneylender's daughter

487
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,679
And then see

488
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:25,246
Your Rakhma will be
happier than ever before

489
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:48,612
come

490
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,551
God bless you

491
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:02,214
May you bring joy to this house

492
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:06,390
And bear many children

493
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,233
Take the Lord's blessings

494
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,778
Savji, your elder brother-in-law

495
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,324
Manjula, your sister-in-law

496
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,394
No, no, don't

497
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:46,397
Come, I'll show you around our house
- Go

498
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,912
First see the kitchen where
wewomenspend all our time

499
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,511
Mother-in-law smears
the floor with cow dung

500
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,406
It's her favourite job

501
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:02,876
It's a lettle dark in here

502
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,553
It's almost dusk...
Where will the light come from?

503
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:10,492
Our prayer room is twice this size

504
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,489
Actually our whole house is a temple

505
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,800
father-in-law neverr
rmisses the annual pilgrrirmage

506
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,166
And our
brother-in-law almost lives here

507
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,202
father-in-law? Brrotherr-in-law?
So you are...? - I'rm Rakhrma

508
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,737
I thought you were
his sister Saraswati

509
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,407
That's okay

510
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,908
You're not off the mark

511
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,813
We'rre both his wrives.
Ike sisters who wrorship the same man

512
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:42,120
What's he like?

513
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:44,685
One in a million!

514
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,861
How? Good or bad?

515
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,791
Now how do I explain?

516
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,358
Tell the truth

517
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,128
He knows the
business; he enjoys prayer!

518
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:00,608
He's an obedient son;
a devoted brother-in-law

519
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,509
He's fond of his young brother Kanha

520
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,774
He sings very well

521
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,206
His friends can't do without him

522
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,484
The calf won't eat unless he feeds it

523
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,413
The house feels
empty when he's not there

524
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,486
That is Tukaram of the Ambile family!

525
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:38,973
come in

526
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:45,719
Wait! See the stars

527
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,490
The stars come out when the moon rises

528
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:06,540
The star upstairs is
waiting for you - Rakhma

529
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,349
It's not nice that you
should sit here alone

530
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:17,920
The poor girl is bewildered as it is

531
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,249
Come on now

532
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,488
Come on now

533
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:48,248
Go.

534
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,574
A person's true colours
are seen under pressure

535
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:56,749
Our Rakhma's turned
out to be pure gold

536
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:59,180
I don't know how I can repay her

537
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:00,913
It's good fortune!

538
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:07,363
You're right. I'm fortunate
to have such a daughter-in-law

539
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:13,803
Not you. Your daughter-in-law
Rakhma is fortunate

540
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:21,445
How can you say that?
Her husband remarried...

541
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:26,410
Her grief has a name

542
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:29,852
Her sacrifice is worth something

543
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:33,721
Also she has earned your praise

544
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:41,761
When she crried in the
darrk you grrieved with herr

545
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:46,328
But you can't see my
tears in broad daylight

546
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:52,901
orrd, don't give me grrief...

547
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:55,972
...that I can't even express

548
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:09,124
Hurry up!

549
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:12,822
Come on

550
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,394
One baskIt of unhusked rice

551
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,729
What else do you have?

552
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:22,905
Tukaram Ambile. One sack of rice

553
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,833
Tukaram Ambile. One sack of rice

554
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:28,939
Six pice

555
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,644
What? The duty has doubled in a mouth?

556
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,911
The last time you must have had the...

557
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:37,354
...same weight on a horse,
not a bullock

558
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:39,514
We'll bring it on a donkey if we wish

559
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:42,621
With a donkey you'll save four pice

560
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,921
The donkey might die under this weight

561
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:48,295
What can we do? A rule is a rule

562
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:49,765
God bless your rules!

563
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:52,302
No... we will not pay the duty

564
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,501
Sir, these men are creating a problem

565
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:55,903
Bring them here

566
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,877
Yes, let me go. You think I'm afraid?

567
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:02,475
Yes?

568
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:04,707
This Digubhat refuses to pay the duty

569
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:06,909
I repeat... I will not pay it

570
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:11,518
You make us brahmins pay
taxes to fill government coffers

571
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:13,580
That's an unforgiveable sin

572
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:15,818
We are taking two cows and 20 mounds...

573
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:17,690
...of rice for the
brahmins in the monastery

574
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:19,593
Got it?
- No...

575
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:22,598
You'll have to pay the duty
- Back to square one?

576
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,897
You should ask for our
blessings; not levy duties on us

577
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,870
Come on... bring the cows

578
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:29,235
What's this?

579
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:31,240
If you don't collect
duty from Digubhat...

580
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:33,936
...I too won'tpayn
for these silk cloths

581
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:36,611
Brother, let's just pay the duty

582
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,376
Why? Didn't he say
that a rule is a rule?

583
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,940
Four pice for two cows

584
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:43,953
Again? This is the limit of impudence

585
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:48,685
look Digubhat, because of you
Tukaram Ambile also refuses to pay

586
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:49,817
So what can I do?

587
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:52,522
Tell me priest, why are
you carrying all this?

588
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,928
Why? Obviously for
religious rites! - Um

589
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:58,435
The silk cloths we have
are also for religious rites

590
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:01,664
Digubhat, what's your job?

591
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:05,874
Great. Mr. Patki, this trading
caste person doesn't even know...

592
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:09,704
...that any religious rite in the
town is not possible without us!

593
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:13,578
And no worship is possible
without wearing this silk cloth

594
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,380
This brahmin doesn't
even know all that!

595
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:18,911
You idiot, we wear that.
We don't sell it

596
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:22,249
But don't you charrge
for your services?

597
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:25,295
Of course! That is our right!

598
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:27,626
And carrying on trade is our right!

599
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,533
But it's not a sin to
charge for service! - Yes

600
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,935
It's not a sin to do the
work ordained for my caste!

601
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,673
What's good or bad about paying duty?

602
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:38,935
That's my point

603
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:44,273
Our caste and our purpose have
nothing to do with this duty

604
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,343
Hey, stop that noise

605
00:46:46,617 --> 00:46:48,244
First, give this brahmin his rreceipt

606
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,617
Everyone else get back to work
- Yes sir

607
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:53,384
Come on, quick
- This is the rule of evil

608
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,448
get our cows. let's go

609
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:58,222
One baskIt of unhusked rice and
a 'Pitamber' (Sacred Cloth).

610
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,319
Alright.
- Move ahead.

611
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,758
Hey, Joshi. Come fast. We are late.

612
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:05,267
Kayn...
- Fast. Fast.

613
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:08,828
Now I'll have to work day and
night to pay for all these taxes

614
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,605
let's go.

615
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:15,578
Your cows look like they give a
lot of milk Where did you buy them?

616
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:16,772
From hell!

617
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:25,581
When he said 'From hell',
that brahmin looked...

618
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:27,681
...like he'd swallowed
some bitter medicine

619
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:31,888
He must have cursed Tuka a million
times as he paid his duty

620
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:34,556
I don't care! I was so angry.

621
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:36,865
He behaved as though he was doing...

622
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:38,868
...God a favour by running a monastery

623
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:40,904
I hope you didn't insult him?

624
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,370
There she goes

625
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:45,666
But why take on these people?

626
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:49,179
Mother, our relationship is
directly with God Pandurang

627
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,740
Do we compromise on
our religious duties?

628
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:53,873
Then why be scared of these middlemen?

629
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:56,610
You don't worry Mother

630
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,416
My brother's more
than a match for them

631
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,548
Yes, support your brother!

632
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:04,618
Shevanta, ask your
husband what he wants

633
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:06,561
Go

634
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,089
Serve him some more

635
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:13,793
Hey, look after me too

636
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:19,138
We lack the abilety to eat well

637
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:23,402
One should speak less and eat more

638
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,313
Um... I like this milk dessert

639
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:27,611
Rakhma's made it

640
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:29,676
Great!

641
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:33,748
If you don't like the
green vegetable, don't eat it

642
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:38,585
You've made it?

643
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:44,132
No wonder! I find it tastes
even bItter than the dessert

644
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:54,710
The mind keeps worrying Who knows
what Destiny has in store for us!

645
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:55,802
Tuka.

646
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:57,439
Yes Father?

647
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:01,146
The signs don't look good!

648
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:03,619
Why Father?

649
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,884
Ike birrds can sense an earthquake...

650
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:10,283
...moneylenders also
have to be vigilant

651
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,659
when a famine looms large

652
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:17,864
The famer looks at the sky...

653
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,096
...the moneylender at his capital

654
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:24,172
Now's the time to collect our dues

655
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:27,176
Do one thing. Leave tomorrow at dawn

656
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:28,609
Go to Bhikaji

657
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:31,170
And collect all our pending dues

658
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:32,772
He will complain...

659
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,285
..."The seeds are burnt;
it was no use sowing them"

660
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:39,187
But don't listen to him

661
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:41,219
Take from him...

662
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,624
...whatever you can get

663
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:46,254
And if there's no money,
ask for jewellery

664
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,594
But what's the rush Father?

665
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,427
let one big shower of rain fall

666
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,700
Then we will have a right to ask

667
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:56,331
The rains are delayed somItimes

668
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:57,806
Tell him this

669
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,567
Say that the crop prospects are good

670
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:03,369
But there's a problem at home

671
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:06,909
Tell him that your
father is seriouslyill

672
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,552
I should lie to him?

673
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,920
Isn't it true that the
situation is serious?

674
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,652
I will not tell a lie!

675
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:19,792
But I'll handle this. You don't worry

676
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:26,426
And take 20 mounds of grain
to Mr. Kulkarni - Okay

677
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:31,236
I've measured it. Ask Ganpa
to load it in the cart - Yes

678
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:46,216
Go away!
- What

679
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:51,585
When I have to go to my parents'
home, you decide to go out of town

680
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:55,856
Shouldn't I obey my father?

681
00:50:56,834 --> 00:51:00,600
When I'm back, we'll take the
bullock cart and head for Pune. Okay?

682
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:02,772
And what if the rains begin?

683
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,172
We'll get wIt

684
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,508
How else would I see you all soaked?

685
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:16,582
You are rarely bashful.
But you look lovely when you are

686
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:21,624
You just praise my looks

687
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,959
But you think Rakhma is a bItter cLook

688
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:29,494
You only ask about my cough
Your thoughts are elsewhere

689
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:34,335
Why? Didn't I praise
your milk dessert?

690
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:36,772
You praised it?
- Of course!

691
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:40,206
But you didn't ask why I made it

692
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:44,805
When do we need a reason?
Must be some festival

693
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:48,808
You don't see any change in me?

694
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,215
You have a co-wife to assist you now

695
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:54,179
You seem a lettle chubby

696
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:56,958
I had made a vow to the Goddess

697
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:59,255
We'll have to go and fulfill it

698
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:01,657
I'm four months pregnant

699
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:04,859
Rakhma

700
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:10,699
Really...?

701
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:11,798
Yes.

702
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:14,570
I'm not a moneylender to tell lies

703
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:21,547
See, weren't you hasty
about getting me a second wife?

704
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:23,812
Yes, I was

705
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:26,583
let it be. She brought good luck

706
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:28,683
That's great!

707
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:29,953
So it's her luck?

708
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,885
All my prayers and vows are in vain!

709
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:38,565
Oh Lord, having two scales at work,
and two wives at home...

710
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:42,401
Maintaining the
correct balance is a problem!

711
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:51,540
Has the sky fallen on you...

712
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:54,712
...that you and your father
can't even wait till the crop grows?

713
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:58,186
The truth is that is
that my father's old now

714
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,618
So he worries more

715
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,886
You owe us the most money
- Yes.

716
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:07,894
You've overstepped the loan
period by six months - Yes

717
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:10,623
You and I are equally
worried about the future

718
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:12,457
Do one thing

719
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:15,403
Give me one share of
the dues now - But...

720
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,872
Give the rest after the crop

721
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:21,906
This way my father will have
one worry less in his old age.

722
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:24,879
...and I will have the
satisfaction of having obeyed him

723
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:49,795
Bhikaji, believe me. I feel no
joy in taking away this ornament

724
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:59,248
There's no need to measure, Uncle

725
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,914
My father has measured it

726
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:04,445
Yes, but just because it's the custom

727
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,546
That's fine by me

728
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,618
It falls short by two mounds

729
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:12,789
That's impossible

730
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:15,693
He can tell the
measure with just one look

731
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,399
His estimate has not gone
wrong in the last 20 years

732
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:20,132
Count it again

733
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,530
You count it if you like

734
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,474
How much less?

735
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:26,474
Two mounds

736
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:39,385
How did Father's estimate go wrong?

737
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,387
His estimate is correct

738
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:48,294
Our times are to blame

739
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:52,802
We're headed for famine Tuka

740
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:55,899
Famine!

741
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,911
His estimate is correct

742
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:12,319
Our times are to blame

743
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,685
We're headed for famine Tuka

744
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:16,254
Famine!

745
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:29,663
Brother!

746
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,341
Kanha, what's wrong?

747
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,468
What happened?

748
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:37,747
Our Father's gone, brother

749
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,608
father's dead
- What?

750
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,521
Brother-in-law...

751
00:55:58,368 --> 00:55:59,494
Mother...

752
00:56:00,704 --> 00:56:02,228
Mother, how did this happen?

753
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,774
How, Mother? Is this true?

754
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,742
He was fine when I left

755
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:10,206
He didn't even wait for me?

756
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:12,776
Mother...

757
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:24,791
He sent you to collect the
dues and here God tLook him away

758
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:33,828
Who dies? Who is born?

759
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:39,707
Who goes to heaven or hell?

760
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,741
The five elements
that make up our bodies

761
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:51,879
Live together in our bodies

762
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:57,852
When they scatter after death

763
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:05,331
All hope is at an end

764
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:12,202
The pot is in the water
and there's water in the pot

765
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:18,341
There is water inside and outside

766
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:25,182
When the pot (body) breaks,
the waters mix

767
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:30,151
This is the teaching of wise men

768
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:33,254
This verse,
by the saint-poIt Kabir, says

769
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:38,432
that the Soul and
the Supreme Being are one.

770
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:51,407
Listen.
- Yes.

771
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:52,846
Just look at him closely

772
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:54,511
Who does he resemble?

773
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:57,511
His chin... the shape of his eyes...

774
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:59,288
Doesn't he look like Father-in-law?

775
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,584
Yes Rakhma, you are right

776
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,428
A broad forehead, thick hair...

777
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:07,795
Where are you off to?

778
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:09,263
Showing mother-in-law.

779
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:15,631
Mother-in-law, you haven't
looked at my baby properly

780
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,807
Look

781
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,276
Look, it's father-in-law come back

782
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,270
See

783
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:28,342
Isn't it?

784
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:33,251
Tell your grandmother to look at me.

785
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:38,620
Kankayee... Kankayee...

786
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:42,263
Kankayee...
- What happened?

787
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:45,561
Mother-in-law... What happened?
- Mother...

788
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:49,803
Mother-in-law...
- Mother...

789
00:58:49,873 --> 00:58:51,272
Mother-in-law...

790
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:52,535
Mother...

791
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:53,701
Mother...

792
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:57,476
Mother... Mother...

793
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:00,741
Mother...

794
00:59:01,418 --> 00:59:02,885
Mother...

795
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:10,785
Brother, mother has passed away.
We have become orphans now.

796
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:13,591
What I had brought to show you...

797
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:16,194
Mother... Mother...

798
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:26,502
Mother-in-law...

799
00:59:28,912 --> 00:59:30,436
What are you
searching for in this corner?

800
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:32,437
Your mother's dead

801
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,210
Who are you hiding from?

802
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:37,444
What are you running away from?

803
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:42,215
Come on and tell brother-in-law
that his elder brother is still alive

804
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:44,387
Tell him that you will
look after the family

805
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:48,289
That your shoulders are strong
enough to bear the family's burden

806
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:51,391
come on... your parentsare gone

807
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,803
Now at least come
back to earth. Come on

808
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:56,136
What happened?

809
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,232
What happened?

810
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:00,874
What sort of man is he?

811
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:02,571
Unmoved even by his mother's death

812
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,181
Is he a stone?

813
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,681
No, he can't be

814
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:11,215
Water can spring from a stone

815
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:13,786
Tomorrow, even if I die...

816
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:17,350
...this man will just wipe
his eyes once and go away

817
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:22,389
He doesn't need anyone

818
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:28,766
I never complained to my parents

819
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:33,842
Or to anybody in the village

820
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:39,246
I only flung barbs at my mother-in-law

821
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:43,543
She would listen quiItly

822
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,690
Now who can I complain to?

823
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,622
Talk to?

824
01:00:53,396 --> 01:00:55,489
This man will now mend his ways.

825
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,389
It's a curse

826
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,500
orrd vitthal has cursed this house

827
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:09,507
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

828
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:12,446
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

829
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:15,279
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

830
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:18,549
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

831
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:44,739
Serve me more sweIts

832
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:14,642
Take care of each other now

833
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:18,441
Your mother...

834
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:19,573
...was one in a million

835
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:21,814
She cared for everyone

836
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:24,215
She loved everyone

837
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:30,188
She wouldn't have been
able to bear this famine

838
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:31,951
So she left...

839
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:33,354
...us behind and went away

840
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:36,888
Take care, all of you

841
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,967
for my husband...

842
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,606
He has not eaten for two days

843
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:19,406
Nothing's wrong. Why would I lie?

844
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:21,444
She was fine till yesterday

845
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:24,275
Of course she was. She's fine now too
- What's wrong?

846
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:27,908
We just came to check on
sister Manjula's health - And?

847
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:29,611
She's not telling us much

848
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:31,244
Is sister-in-law okay?

849
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:33,755
Yes. She had a fever since
morning but she's bItter now

850
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:35,586
These people just won't listen

851
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,652
What on earth?

852
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:40,620
Goodbye

853
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:42,426
Goodbye

854
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:46,868
They came to snoop around

855
01:03:48,671 --> 01:03:52,402
If she dies, the brahmin gets his fees

856
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:55,205
work for the man who cremates
an d money for the wood-seller

857
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:59,880
The florists will earn and the
villagers will get another feast

858
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,881
Even vultures wait for death to happen

859
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,516
These people don't
have even that patience

860
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,455
Oh Lord, what more is in store for us?

861
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:19,392
Brother-in-law, what happened?

862
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,711
I spoke to Deshmukh (the village head)

863
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:42,314
The situation's really bad in our area

864
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:44,893
Told him there'd be
no revenue this year

865
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:48,864
He doesn't even have time to
come here and ask after us?

866
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:51,628
Yes, he should come
and see for himself

867
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:56,962
In Pune, Murarrao, a crazy
commander of the Bijapur empire...

868
01:04:57,273 --> 01:04:59,434
...has sIt fire to the whole city

869
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:00,874
Deshmukh rushed there to help

870
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:03,276
Just tell us how to survive

871
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:05,337
Give us food Or kill us

872
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:09,408
Yes, that's right... - When our
sins overflow, famine occurs

873
01:05:09,852 --> 01:05:11,217
We should have a sacrifice

874
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,221
What do we offer the sacrificial fire?

875
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,187
Human bodies?

876
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:17,750
Try to understand

877
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:20,856
Tatya, you are the
oldest in the village

878
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,764
Tell us what to do

879
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:28,498
This famine reminds me of my
great-grandfather telling me...

880
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:31,406
...about another such famine

881
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:36,173
It went on for 12 years

882
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:38,877
Remember that the first
casualty in a famine...

883
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:42,440
...is humanity.
I'll tell you the story...

884
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,246
...of Damoji, an officer...

885
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:50,682
...who couldn't bear to
see the plight of the people

886
01:05:51,394 --> 01:05:52,622
What did he do?

887
01:05:52,695 --> 01:05:57,428
He opened up the
emperor's granary for them

888
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,928
Isn't that wonderful?

889
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,731
But Tatya...

890
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:04,398
...there's no emperor with
granaries in our village

891
01:06:04,474 --> 01:06:07,272
nor any officer to open them up

892
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:12,872
What I get from this story is
that those who have food to spare...

893
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:16,481
...should share it
with the entire village

894
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:19,214
Great Tuka... It sounds good

895
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:22,281
But everyone is
concerned about the future

896
01:06:22,558 --> 01:06:24,526
Who would want to share?

897
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:25,856
Tuka has no problem

898
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:27,919
His father made lots of money

899
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:30,864
He's not really
affected by the famine yIt

900
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:33,424
Is the rain that falls
on my roof different?

901
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:34,629
Maybe not

902
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:37,798
But people are dying like
flies in poor households

903
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:41,310
It sounds good to hear the
magnanimity in Tatya's story

904
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:44,540
But it's difficult to
emulate it in these tough times

905
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:49,677
Yes, that's true. let's go

906
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,595
Brother Savji is not to be seen

907
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:05,759
He was at home
during the morning prayer

908
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:07,700
The servants have
looked all over the village

909
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,862
He can't be traced

910
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,397
Come on
- Come

911
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:29,916
Finallyn, brrotherr Savii has left

912
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:32,885
He had no bonds left any more

913
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:35,229
How could we stop him?

914
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,833
I requested everyone
at the meIting that day

915
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:48,467
But nobody offered

916
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:52,871
So I am coming forward and
opening up our grain silos

917
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:56,751
I am no Damaji from Tatya's story

918
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,683
Nor is this an emperor's granary

919
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,518
This grain is due to
my father's good deeds

920
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,793
The prrovision he rmade
for the farmilyn's futurre

921
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:09,658
The village is my family

922
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:12,663
So let us share this grain,
taking only...

923
01:08:12,735 --> 01:08:14,464
...as much as we need
to carry on with life

924
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:18,137
That would be a mercy
- Yes indeed

925
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,204
May God bless you, Tuka

926
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:23,145
Kanha

927
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:39,658
Move away

928
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:42,664
What are you doing?

929
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,338
Don't do that

930
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:52,374
Come one by one.
Don't do that, brother

931
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:03,612
Wait, wait

932
01:09:09,225 --> 01:09:11,785
get out

933
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:18,393
Wait, wait

934
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:26,902
Why did you, brother?

935
01:09:27,677 --> 01:09:28,837
for what? for whom?

936
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,111
They don't deserve this

937
01:09:31,414 --> 01:09:33,109
I was telling you...

938
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:34,847
...to stop him

939
01:09:35,485 --> 01:09:36,713
But who listens to me?

940
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,778
Also, I don't have the
status to tell you anything

941
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:44,454
Relax. The deed is done. Come on

942
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,290
That's the Problem, He's too relaxed!

943
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,459
You've given away
everything and you're satisfied

944
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:50,590
Right?

945
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:55,668
The people benefited

946
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:58,703
But what about them?
- Avali...

947
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:04,379
My baby will be born
soon What about its future?

948
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:07,746
Everything will be alright.
Don't cry

949
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:10,650
He has lost everything
- Please don't cry

950
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:18,859
Lord, I realize that people
don't understand spiritualety

951
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:20,956
But don't they know their own welfare?

952
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:24,329
I wanted to make equal shares

953
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:28,533
They just blasted my sentiments too

954
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,871
What if it doesn't
rain again this year?

955
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:06,601
Baren skies

956
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:11,411
Burning earth

957
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:15,649
Baren skies

958
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:20,287
Burning earth

959
01:11:20,923 --> 01:11:25,360
Relationships destroyed

960
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:29,455
All around

961
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:33,495
The seed in the soil

962
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:38,430
Dead before sprouting

963
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:42,269
The seed in the soil

964
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:46,881
Dead before sprouting

965
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,418
The eyes are moist

966
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:56,383
As life weeps

967
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:22,474
The pulse is slow

968
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:27,255
Villages are scorched

969
01:12:27,523 --> 01:12:31,619
Narrowed eyes

970
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:35,953
Scanning the sky

971
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,165
Skeletal bodies

972
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:44,596
Bodies as hearses

973
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:48,841
Skeletal bodies

974
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:53,405
Bodies as hearses

975
01:12:53,849 --> 01:12:57,842
All we meIt is

976
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:02,654
Misfortune

977
01:13:11,634 --> 01:13:15,468
The song is lost

978
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:20,475
Words mean nothing

979
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:24,542
The song is lost

980
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,474
Words mean nothing

981
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:33,215
The drum in the temple

982
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:37,949
Is cracked

983
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:42,458
The river has dried up

984
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:47,260
The pennant is torn

985
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:51,204
The cymbals of worship

986
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,239
Have fallen silent

987
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,642
How did this bud sprout?

988
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:31,370
From where did it get water?

989
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:32,744
And nutrition?

990
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:37,776
How did it breach this rocky ground?

991
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:39,811
What hope made it come out?

992
01:14:40,256 --> 01:14:42,724
Or has Lord Vithoba himself emerged...

993
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:46,193
...as a symbol of
hope amid this disaster?

994
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:18,889
Oh sister-in-law, come out...!

995
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:41,949
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

996
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:45,977
Everyone should realize

997
01:15:46,055 --> 01:15:48,580
The mine of this knowledge

998
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:50,956
According to the wise

999
01:15:51,027 --> 01:15:53,461
Is writing and leterature

1000
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:55,963
It is indestructible

1001
01:15:56,032 --> 01:15:58,432
The sky is the limit for it

1002
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:01,061
To run after
liberation without true devotion

1003
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:04,066
Is no use at all

1004
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:12,337
This dItachment from worldly
life comes to those who...

1005
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,074
Hey... Hey...

1006
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:16,946
Hey Tuka

1007
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:18,646
look there.

1008
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:21,914
come.

1009
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:23,958
Your name?
- Dhondiba Mohite

1010
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:26,894
What have you brought?
- Two ornaments

1011
01:16:45,381 --> 01:16:48,908
We think we are rich because we
have pawned things from others

1012
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:50,711
But that's not true

1013
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,488
It's our stomachs that
are mortgaged to them

1014
01:16:55,725 --> 01:16:57,625
A trader's son is a cheat...
just like him

1015
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:00,493
You give with one hand and
take back with the other

1016
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:03,591
His estimate is correct

1017
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:06,725
Our times are to blame

1018
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:10,304
We're headed for famine Tuka

1019
01:17:12,475 --> 01:17:15,774
He sent you to collect the
dues and here God Look him away

1020
01:17:17,713 --> 01:17:23,481
The pot is in the water
and there's water in the pot

1021
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,651
There is water inside and outside

1022
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:36,455
When the pot (body) breaks,
the waters mix

1023
01:17:36,933 --> 01:17:41,734
This is the teaching of wise men

1024
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:44,598
This verse,
by the saint-poIt Kabir, says

1025
01:17:44,674 --> 01:17:49,611
that the Soul and the
Supreme Being are one.

1026
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:52,812
Dada (Brother), Where are you going?

1027
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:57,050
Sister-in-law, come out

1028
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,558
Wait, brother Tuka

1029
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:05,357
Wait... he's not listening

1030
01:18:05,695 --> 01:18:07,686
Dada (Brother)
- Listen.

1031
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:11,629
Stop
- Stop Brother

1032
01:18:11,968 --> 01:18:14,596
Brother
- Listen

1033
01:18:15,504 --> 01:18:17,369
What are you doing?

1034
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,066
What are you doing?

1035
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:23,708
Giving to the river Indrayani the
things that never belonged to us

1036
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:25,542
Have you lost your mind?

1037
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:28,373
Brother-in-law, at least...

1038
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:30,351
...think about us, these children

1039
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,558
Fine. I'll irmmerse only
my share of the ledgers

1040
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:46,058
Yes, do that

1041
01:18:46,936 --> 01:18:48,733
First, you distributed all the grain

1042
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:50,328
Now immerse all the money

1043
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:55,275
What's the use of wealth that can
do nothing for you in hard times?

1044
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,564
Oh Lord Pandurang

1045
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:33,848
Uttam, your jewellery

1046
01:19:34,784 --> 01:19:40,086
Uttam Dhondiba - two bangles,
one necklace

1047
01:19:40,923 --> 01:19:42,322
You got your jwellery?

1048
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:48,394
Received. Have you really
given up money lending? - Yes

1049
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:49,761
lmmersed all the papers?

1050
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:52,323
Yes. I'm a free bird now

1051
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:55,627
You're hacking away at
the pillars of your home

1052
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:58,067
How will you live?

1053
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,404
Uttam, move aside

1054
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:02,410
Now that you've got your stuff,
you're concerned about him

1055
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:04,912
Give me the document for my land

1056
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,505
That's disappeared
in the river Indrayani

1057
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,949
Disappeared? What?

1058
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:12,351
Tomorrow if you accuse me
of having stolen them...

1059
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:13,479
What then?

1060
01:20:13,756 --> 01:20:15,417
Give me in writing...

1061
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:16,958
...that I don't owe you anything

1062
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:22,391
Kanha, give it to him

1063
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:25,394
My bangles and bracelets?

1064
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:27,095
Your papers aren't here

1065
01:20:27,403 --> 01:20:28,495
How come?

1066
01:20:28,571 --> 01:20:31,369
Tukoba immersed his
share of the papers

1067
01:20:31,674 --> 01:20:33,539
Kanhoba's business is still on

1068
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:36,440
And why did I come in Kanha's share?

1069
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:37,809
What can we do about that?

1070
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,370
Why not?

1071
01:20:39,448 --> 01:20:41,973
I'm an old widow;
I'm getting my daughter married

1072
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:44,315
I won't leave till I get
my bangles and bracelets

1073
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,684
I won't leave without my ornaments

1074
01:20:46,756 --> 01:20:48,383
Hey you!

1075
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,282
Do you also want my
brother-in-law to be insolvent?

1076
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:57,893
Leave now. get out, all of you

1077
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:02,495
Sister-in-law...

1078
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,536
What's wrong?

1079
01:21:13,549 --> 01:21:15,039
He gave everything away

1080
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:18,618
He has squandered everything

1081
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:20,987
Take it easy

1082
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:34,929
Shevanta...

1083
01:21:35,638 --> 01:21:36,866
What are you doing sister-in-law?

1084
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:38,702
I'm giving her the
charge of this house

1085
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:40,071
But you are older than her

1086
01:21:41,143 --> 01:21:42,770
What's the use of that?

1087
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:44,972
The one who takes care
of the house is bigger

1088
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:48,244
It's enough if you just feed us

1089
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:52,420
If you stop caring...

1090
01:21:52,822 --> 01:21:54,255
...who do we look up to?

1091
01:21:55,391 --> 01:21:56,790
It us rrermain the way we are

1092
01:21:58,928 --> 01:22:00,987
We don't want the
burden of responsibilety

1093
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:03,523
And you don't worry

1094
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,328
Everything will get back to normal

1095
01:22:06,702 --> 01:22:09,466
This is just a temporary whim of his

1096
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:12,897
Temporary or pemanent. Who knows?

1097
01:22:19,515 --> 01:22:20,812
You don't approve of what I did?

1098
01:22:20,883 --> 01:22:23,977
forget the keyns.
I wrant to get away From this house

1099
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:25,711
Why?

1100
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,046
It is obsessed with Lord Vitthal

1101
01:22:28,557 --> 01:22:29,581
What did you say?

1102
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:32,050
It's obsessed with Lord Vitthal!

1103
01:22:34,897 --> 01:22:36,489
You know what people say?

1104
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,600
That I'm obsessed with you

1105
01:22:40,636 --> 01:22:45,039
You pushed me to give up money lending

1106
01:22:45,975 --> 01:22:47,772
And now I'm ruined!

1107
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:54,541
But they don't realize that Tuka...

1108
01:22:54,617 --> 01:22:56,585
...is attracted not
to material wealth...

1109
01:22:56,952 --> 01:23:01,286
...but to the everlasting wealth
that devotion to you gives him

1110
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:08,923
orrd, in orrderr to
brrin g me closerr to you...

1111
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:11,764
...to become one with you...

1112
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:16,537
...you have liberated me from
the bother of worldly problems

1113
01:23:22,745 --> 01:23:27,546
Mother, give me some food. I'm hungry

1114
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:33,082
Mahadev, Bhagu... come have lunch

1115
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,718
You too sister-in-law

1116
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:40,653
You've not had anything for two days

1117
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:42,657
Why are you doing this?

1118
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,935
It's been eight days that he's gone

1119
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:51,871
I wonder how he is and where

1120
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,672
How can I eat in peace?

1121
01:23:57,546 --> 01:23:58,808
I'm dItermined too

1122
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:02,616
let me see how long he stays away

1123
01:24:16,665 --> 01:24:20,795
h no, did you have to
fly away because of me?

1124
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:23,764
come, my dear friends

1125
01:24:24,073 --> 01:24:25,904
come sit by me

1126
01:24:36,986 --> 01:24:44,483
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1127
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,588
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1128
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:54,825
So are the birds who sing sweIt songs

1129
01:24:54,903 --> 01:24:59,863
So are the birds who sing sweIt songs

1130
01:24:59,942 --> 01:25:07,371
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1131
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:12,978
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1132
01:25:23,599 --> 01:25:28,366
This joy makes us long for soletude

1133
01:25:28,437 --> 01:25:33,397
This joy makes us long for soletude

1134
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:38,708
Where we are not judged by anybody

1135
01:25:38,781 --> 01:25:45,016
Where we are not judged by anybody

1136
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:52,893
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1137
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:59,491
The flora and fauna are
our kith and kin - Tuka!

1138
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:16,778
The sky is the roof
and the earth the seat

1139
01:26:16,852 --> 01:26:21,619
The sky is the roof
and the earth the seat

1140
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:26,821
Our minds frolic where
they find recreation

1141
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:33,425
Our minds frolic where
they find recreation

1142
01:26:33,702 --> 01:26:41,438
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1143
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:46,846
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1144
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:54,083
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1145
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:57,381
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1146
01:26:57,459 --> 01:27:02,362
Tuka says that in soletude
we can talk to ourselves

1147
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:04,695
Tuka says that...

1148
01:27:20,082 --> 01:27:24,883
Tuka says that in soletude
we can talk to ourselves

1149
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:30,050
We can converse with our inner beings

1150
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:36,792
We can converse with our inner beings

1151
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:44,362
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1152
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:52,005
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1153
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:58,781
The flora and fauna
are our kith and kin

1154
01:28:01,657 --> 01:28:03,716
When did you come?

1155
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:04,986
While you were singing

1156
01:28:05,427 --> 01:28:06,758
What a lovely song!

1157
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:09,563
And what does 'Tuka says' indicate?

1158
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:11,092
Have you created it?

1159
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,999
Maybe I created it; perhaps nature did

1160
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:15,798
Everyone's singing here

1161
01:28:15,871 --> 01:28:17,964
The trees, animals, birds

1162
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,065
So, you too can write
'abhangs' (devotional verses)?

1163
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:23,538
The saint-poIt Namdev,
along with Lord Vitthal...

1164
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:25,910
...Woke me up in my dreams

1165
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:28,643
They gave me the
task of writing poetry

1166
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:30,582
And asked me not to
indulge in empty talk

1167
01:28:30,886 --> 01:28:34,083
That means we have
the right to compose?

1168
01:28:34,156 --> 01:28:37,489
Didn't Saint Namdev do it?
Was he a brahmin?

1169
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:41,120
But he was a great man, a leader.
You are just Tukaram Ambile

1170
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:46,590
Dada, have you eaten?

1171
01:28:48,337 --> 01:28:50,897
Didn't you feel lonely here?

1172
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:55,342
Lonely? With all this around me?

1173
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:56,809
But what's wrong with the village?

1174
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:59,610
These are people there
too who care for you

1175
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:01,546
I like it there too

1176
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,407
When people work hard

1177
01:29:03,785 --> 01:29:05,912
When the cobs of corn fill up

1178
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:07,783
It's a great feeling

1179
01:29:08,991 --> 01:29:11,619
But there one is
divided into too many parts

1180
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:16,627
Divisions of caste, divisions
at home; barriers in the fields

1181
01:29:16,698 --> 01:29:19,599
It's mine and yours all over!

1182
01:29:20,769 --> 01:29:23,795
The heart is a place for lots of love

1183
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:26,466
But we have filled
it with money matters

1184
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:28,907
How do we find joy there?

1185
01:29:29,711 --> 01:29:30,837
And look here!

1186
01:29:31,446 --> 01:29:33,744
The pond belongs to
the one who sits by it

1187
01:29:34,116 --> 01:29:36,983
You hear a bird's chirp; you own it

1188
01:29:37,753 --> 01:29:40,620
We lose out on such simple joys!

1189
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:46,525
Yes, but God has created
some other creatures for our joy

1190
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:49,063
And you owe them something too

1191
01:29:49,665 --> 01:29:50,597
Who?

1192
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:54,067
Your wife, kids

1193
01:29:54,136 --> 01:29:57,537
Sister-in-law hasn't
eaten a bite since you left

1194
01:29:58,073 --> 01:29:59,062
Oh no!

1195
01:29:59,174 --> 01:30:01,108
Where did he go after storming out?

1196
01:30:01,677 --> 01:30:04,475
Don't I have a right to react
when he destroys all the papers?

1197
01:30:04,813 --> 01:30:06,405
Why should he leave?

1198
01:30:06,682 --> 01:30:08,479
Sister, he's rIturned

1199
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:14,715
Great!

1200
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,517
So where was he?

1201
01:30:18,593 --> 01:30:19,992
On top of the hill

1202
01:30:20,062 --> 01:30:23,964
The hill? Why? To drink in the breeze?

1203
01:30:26,068 --> 01:30:28,593
There was no need to go there

1204
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:31,469
Here too, he behaved
like he walked on air

1205
01:30:31,773 --> 01:30:34,469
Got rid of ledgers; emptied grain bins

1206
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:36,033
let that go now...

1207
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:40,673
Oh yes; what a great man

1208
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:45,409
eaves before dawrn but rIturns in
the evenin g wrhen someone rmakes him

1209
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:49,653
Hey, what's this?

1210
01:30:50,092 --> 01:30:51,582
Is this a carnival? get out!

1211
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,423
Relax, sister-in-law

1212
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:57,060
Why give him water? Felicitate him!

1213
01:30:57,866 --> 01:31:00,061
Once for coming home

1214
01:31:00,602 --> 01:31:03,696
Also for not having
immersed anything else

1215
01:31:04,005 --> 01:31:07,873
YIt again for not turning
into an ascItic - Avali...

1216
01:31:07,943 --> 01:31:12,403
What? Remember you have a family?

1217
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:17,341
Here, push them into
the well and be free

1218
01:31:20,122 --> 01:31:21,646
Avali...

1219
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,287
Go away

1220
01:31:25,794 --> 01:31:29,696
You do what you want
and then apologize

1221
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,008
Once and for all

1222
01:31:41,843 --> 01:31:44,004
Give up everything

1223
01:31:44,746 --> 01:31:46,509
Become an ascItic or be a householder

1224
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:50,613
I won't allow you to behave
like this till we are around

1225
01:31:53,488 --> 01:31:55,752
You start trading again

1226
01:31:56,491 --> 01:31:59,460
No, if you do that,
all your attention will go to that...

1227
01:31:59,528 --> 01:32:01,257
...black God (Vitthal) in the temple

1228
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:04,992
You start farming

1229
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:07,860
Grow heaps of grain

1230
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:10,632
Then do whatever worship you want

1231
01:32:11,506 --> 01:32:14,532
Okay, I'll start farming

1232
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:18,502
Kanha, you look after
the business. Come - Where?

1233
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,480
To the farm. Take the plough

1234
01:32:20,549 --> 01:32:24,451
May I come too?
- Nobody is going anywhere

1235
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:27,586
Sit down. I can't let
you go without eating

1236
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:31,757
I'm hungry too. Come on Shevanta,
let's make some flatbread

1237
01:32:31,827 --> 01:32:33,624
And your green vegetable

1238
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,831
Then we'll go to the farm
- Me too

1239
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:39,657
Okay. All of us will go

1240
01:32:45,874 --> 01:32:52,370
May your figure be always before me

1241
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:58,750
May your figure be always before me

1242
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:05,487
My beloved God,
husband of mother Rukmini

1243
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:11,726
Your form is beautiful;
it feels good to chant your name

1244
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:18,501
Please give me your love always

1245
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:25,536
May your figure be always before me

1246
01:33:31,419 --> 01:33:37,585
My mother-like Lord Vithu,
give me this one boon

1247
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:43,996
My mother-like Lord Vithu,
give me this one boon

1248
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:50,761
Occupy my heart always

1249
01:33:50,839 --> 01:33:57,335
My mother-like Lord Vithu,
give me this one boon

1250
01:33:57,412 --> 01:34:03,681
Tuka says "I will not ask for more"

1251
01:34:03,752 --> 01:34:10,021
Tuka says "I will not ask for more"

1252
01:34:10,325 --> 01:34:16,787
"Since all my joy
lies in your worship"

1253
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:23,327
May your figure be always before me

1254
01:34:23,405 --> 01:34:31,312
May your figure be always before me

1255
01:34:41,623 --> 01:34:43,591
Listen everyone

1256
01:34:43,992 --> 01:34:49,487
The arrogant Murarrao from the
barbaric Adilshahi empire...

1257
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:52,458
...dermolished manyn villages

1258
01:34:53,034 --> 01:34:55,002
Those villages will be rebuilt

1259
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:57,796
The land will be made fertile

1260
01:34:58,473 --> 01:35:04,571
This is by order of
Jijabai Shahji Bhosle

1261
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:09,245
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1262
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:13,752
Oh mind, don't get lost
in the illusion of life

1263
01:35:14,055 --> 01:35:17,388
Bad times are here to torture you

1264
01:35:17,826 --> 01:35:21,455
When they happen

1265
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:24,498
Your parents cannot save you

1266
01:35:24,566 --> 01:35:28,400
Neither king nor minister can help you

1267
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:31,764
Nor powerful relatives

1268
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,367
Tuka says nobody can save you

1269
01:35:35,443 --> 01:35:37,809
Except Lord Vishnu,
the bearer of the divine wheel

1270
01:35:37,879 --> 01:35:40,313
Lord Pandurang...

1271
01:35:40,682 --> 01:35:41,876
So friends...

1272
01:35:42,484 --> 01:35:45,885
Death is the greatest teacher

1273
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:50,556
But we have forgotten its lesson

1274
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:54,493
After the famine,
we are back to our usual ways

1275
01:35:54,763 --> 01:35:56,731
As if the tragedy never happened

1276
01:35:57,732 --> 01:35:59,757
Why aren't we ready to learn?

1277
01:36:00,035 --> 01:36:03,801
Why are we back to
chasing transient things?

1278
01:36:04,472 --> 01:36:07,703
I am truly surprised by these people

1279
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:10,677
Why don't they
consider their own welfare?

1280
01:36:10,745 --> 01:36:14,112
Why don't they
consider what's good for them?

1281
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:16,941
Who will finally come to their aid?

1282
01:36:17,018 --> 01:36:22,513
Oh Lord Vitthal... Vitthal

1283
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:26,048
Oh Lord Vitthal... Vitthal

1284
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:31,565
Oh Lord Vitthal... Vitthal

1285
01:36:31,633 --> 01:36:36,730
Oh Lord Vitthal... Vitthal

1286
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:40,567
Tuka gave up money lending
and immersed himself in worship

1287
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:44,069
I thought, "Great, now his
pride will take a beating,"

1288
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,006
"My business will prosper"

1289
01:36:46,448 --> 01:36:50,350
But he's back to trading and farming

1290
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:53,478
And he renovated the temple

1291
01:36:53,555 --> 01:36:55,420
So his business of worship has started

1292
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:58,088
Those who gather
around him for worship...

1293
01:36:58,393 --> 01:37:00,725
...go to Kanha for loans

1294
01:37:00,795 --> 01:37:03,389
And those who take money from Kanha...

1295
01:37:03,465 --> 01:37:05,433
...pay obeisance to Tuka

1296
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:08,468
It's a profitable business
- Yes

1297
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,800
If we don't wake up now...

1298
01:37:11,473 --> 01:37:16,410
...we'll have to pack up
and leave one day soon - So?

1299
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:25,545
There's just one solution
- What?

1300
01:37:26,154 --> 01:37:28,520
Mambajibuva
- Who?

1301
01:37:28,857 --> 01:37:32,088
He's a bigwig from Chinchwad

1302
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:35,019
He needs a bigger area for his work

1303
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:37,654
It's get him here

1304
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:41,930
Great! His strength of
devotion and your power...

1305
01:37:42,003 --> 01:37:45,564
We'll move the ground
under the Ambiles' feIt

1306
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:48,972
God, it's good that I am insolvent

1307
01:37:49,043 --> 01:37:51,477
God, it's good that I am insolvent

1308
01:37:51,546 --> 01:37:53,741
And that the famine tortured me

1309
01:37:53,815 --> 01:37:55,976
And that the famine tortured me

1310
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:58,541
My repentance made me think of you

1311
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,884
My repentance made me think of you

1312
01:38:00,955 --> 01:38:03,389
And this worldly
life become nauseating

1313
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:05,653
And this worldly
life become nauseating

1314
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:08,059
It's good, oh Lord,
that my wife harasses me

1315
01:38:08,129 --> 01:38:09,824
It's good, oh Lord,
that my wife harasses me - Tukaram.

1316
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:11,826
What does 'a shrill wife' mean?

1317
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:14,095
'A shrill wife' means...

1318
01:38:14,169 --> 01:38:16,660
..."Thank God, you gave me...

1319
01:38:16,738 --> 01:38:17,796
...a quarelsome wife"

1320
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,867
Hence I lost
interest in family life...

1321
01:38:20,942 --> 01:38:23,934
...and concentrated on your wrorship

1322
01:38:24,746 --> 01:38:26,646
I am quarelsome?

1323
01:38:27,115 --> 01:38:29,879
Why? Because I feed you?

1324
01:38:30,385 --> 01:38:32,114
look after you?

1325
01:38:32,187 --> 01:38:34,849
Or give offerings of
food to that black God...

1326
01:38:34,923 --> 01:38:37,016
...even if my kids are hungry?

1327
01:38:37,091 --> 01:38:40,356
What are you saying?
- Yes, it hurts when I talk

1328
01:38:41,062 --> 01:38:43,053
You don't earn a
penny; I still run the house

1329
01:38:43,364 --> 01:38:44,888
Take care of the business,
and the kids

1330
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:45,990
That doesn't count?

1331
01:38:46,734 --> 01:38:49,601
And your idle friends!

1332
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:51,832
They're here early
morning to beat cymbals

1333
01:38:51,906 --> 01:38:53,396
They have no work

1334
01:38:53,675 --> 01:38:55,768
All their wives curse them

1335
01:38:56,644 --> 01:38:59,078
And I'm quarelsome?

1336
01:38:59,914 --> 01:39:01,677
You are right Avali

1337
01:39:01,749 --> 01:39:04,616
Damu's wife threw a stick at him

1338
01:39:04,686 --> 01:39:05,983
I don't blame her!

1339
01:39:06,054 --> 01:39:09,421
And Santu's oil mill is closed?
The bull ran away

1340
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:10,957
His wife has to work the mill

1341
01:39:11,626 --> 01:39:13,059
Are you teasing me?

1342
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:15,687
No, you're right

1343
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,361
They have been thrown out

1344
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:18,956
And they are calling you 'shrill'

1345
01:39:19,033 --> 01:39:20,432
Give them a piece of your mind

1346
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:23,436
They don't work;
they get to eat anyway

1347
01:39:23,705 --> 01:39:25,104
All they do is beat on cymbals

1348
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:26,868
And create noise everywhere

1349
01:39:27,141 --> 01:39:28,438
They are alive but as good as dead

1350
01:39:28,509 --> 01:39:29,999
They have no shame whatsoever

1351
01:39:30,078 --> 01:39:32,672
They don't care for and
have forsaken their families

1352
01:39:32,747 --> 01:39:35,807
Their wives suffer; and
exist by turning hard like stones

1353
01:39:38,052 --> 01:39:39,076
Avali

1354
01:39:43,391 --> 01:39:45,325
Don't cry

1355
01:39:46,461 --> 01:39:47,689
All of them

1356
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:50,593
Me too, have become conceited...

1357
01:39:50,932 --> 01:39:53,901
...that we are all great devotees

1358
01:39:54,569 --> 01:39:56,036
We do good for the world

1359
01:39:56,905 --> 01:40:00,033
So we neglect our wives
and kids We call them names

1360
01:40:02,477 --> 01:40:04,536
Whose side are you on?

1361
01:40:06,414 --> 01:40:08,041
The side of sorrow

1362
01:40:11,552 --> 01:40:13,076
Then why call me 'shrill'?

1363
01:40:13,388 --> 01:40:16,949
Not you! They
complained about their wives

1364
01:40:17,025 --> 01:40:18,617
So I wrote 'shrill wife'

1365
01:40:18,693 --> 01:40:21,526
You told me of your
distress I expressed that too

1366
01:40:24,632 --> 01:40:26,964
Yes. As if you are
never angry with me?

1367
01:40:28,002 --> 01:40:29,060
Maybe...

1368
01:40:29,904 --> 01:40:31,701
I may have expressed my anger

1369
01:40:32,373 --> 01:40:36,070
But the expression in my
words is never mine alone

1370
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:41,814
A poIt's heart is the rrecess
for all the sorrows of society

1371
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:47,287
God himself has no other
place to rest his burden

1372
01:41:00,969 --> 01:41:05,406
Greeting. Come...
- Greeting.

1373
01:41:13,014 --> 01:41:14,276
Carefully.

1374
01:41:19,988 --> 01:41:22,422
This is Digubhat
- Greetings!

1375
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:24,981
Joshibuva...
He looks after this monastery

1376
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:26,890
Kanakdas, a man from the North...

1377
01:41:26,961 --> 01:41:29,429
...established this
monastery 100 years ago

1378
01:41:29,697 --> 01:41:31,096
There was a rest house here

1379
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:32,889
for travelers

1380
01:41:32,967 --> 01:41:34,798
This is a Shiva temple

1381
01:41:34,869 --> 01:41:36,530
Kanakdas lived here

1382
01:41:36,604 --> 01:41:37,662
In this garbage heap?

1383
01:41:37,939 --> 01:41:39,702
Um... yes
- Yes

1384
01:41:39,774 --> 01:41:42,004
I can't live amid rubbish

1385
01:41:42,076 --> 01:41:43,373
Give me good accommodation

1386
01:41:43,444 --> 01:41:45,378
Is the village wealthy?

1387
01:41:45,713 --> 01:41:47,044
What wealth?

1388
01:41:47,348 --> 01:41:49,339
The famine destroyed everything

1389
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:50,441
Then why did you call me?

1390
01:41:50,885 --> 01:41:54,013
There are moneylenders like Laxmidas

1391
01:41:54,322 --> 01:41:56,017
You don't worry

1392
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:57,489
We will manage the funds

1393
01:41:57,558 --> 01:42:00,550
A monastery means festivals

1394
01:42:00,628 --> 01:42:01,925
Religious rites

1395
01:42:01,996 --> 01:42:04,021
Hundreds of people
will eat We need money

1396
01:42:04,098 --> 01:42:06,726
We'll get it.
The village folk are religious

1397
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:08,735
Just being religious isn't enough

1398
01:42:08,803 --> 01:42:11,829
We need finances to
restore the monastery

1399
01:42:11,906 --> 01:42:13,032
Yes.

1400
01:42:13,608 --> 01:42:14,734
What about water?

1401
01:42:14,809 --> 01:42:15,867
I'll show you

1402
01:42:21,949 --> 01:42:22,938
Here...

1403
01:42:24,018 --> 01:42:25,883
Oh no!

1404
01:42:26,587 --> 01:42:27,747
This sludge must be removed

1405
01:42:28,423 --> 01:42:31,085
get the villagers on it
Clean it up; repair it

1406
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:33,719
The monastery needs constant funds

1407
01:42:33,795 --> 01:42:35,990
We must have land.
Understood? Come on

1408
01:42:36,064 --> 01:42:38,692
let's go.
- Careful.

1409
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:46,028
How is it? It's my first attempt ever

1410
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:49,242
Why have you scribbled this Santu?

1411
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:52,672
You have just put
together some letters

1412
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:56,713
look, don't feel bad

1413
01:42:57,351 --> 01:43:00,787
But poetry must come
from experience - What?

1414
01:43:01,656 --> 01:43:04,386
See... Vitthal is our
respected deity but...

1415
01:43:04,692 --> 01:43:08,423
...that doesn't make
every verse about him great

1416
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:10,688
It must be true

1417
01:43:10,765 --> 01:43:12,790
Real, backed by experience

1418
01:43:13,701 --> 01:43:17,728
Use your surroundings when you write

1419
01:43:18,606 --> 01:43:22,667
I have my oil mill,
bullock and oil What can I write?

1420
01:43:23,044 --> 01:43:25,308
You will one day

1421
01:43:25,813 --> 01:43:28,441
Your poetry will flourish

1422
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:33,343
Really?
- Yes. Come...

1423
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:34,445
Okay.

1424
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:37,380
May Lord Shiva bless us

1425
01:43:37,458 --> 01:43:42,794
May Lord Shiva bless us

1426
01:43:42,864 --> 01:43:45,958
May good fortune be yours

1427
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:48,558
This is Tukoba. A famer and trader

1428
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,971
This is Santu. An oilman

1429
01:43:51,539 --> 01:43:52,665
Who is there?

1430
01:43:54,308 --> 01:43:56,742
May Lord Shiva bless us

1431
01:43:57,011 --> 01:44:00,037
Tukoba is also a moneylender
- That's great!

1432
01:44:00,114 --> 01:44:01,945
Great!

1433
01:44:02,517 --> 01:44:05,350
I have heard about you.
I wanted to meIt you

1434
01:44:07,588 --> 01:44:12,423
I have decided to restore Kanakdas's
monastery to its fomer glory

1435
01:44:12,927 --> 01:44:16,328
Rich men like you should participate

1436
01:44:16,397 --> 01:44:18,888
Tukoba has also renovated his temple

1437
01:44:19,867 --> 01:44:21,698
You have a temple?
- Yes

1438
01:44:21,969 --> 01:44:23,903
With 'Keertans'
(musical narrations)? - Yes

1439
01:44:25,473 --> 01:44:27,532
Do people come to listen?

1440
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:28,870
Yes, they have started to

1441
01:44:28,943 --> 01:44:32,071
It's surprising.
You are lower caste people

1442
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:34,740
But you build
temples and do 'keertans'

1443
01:44:34,815 --> 01:44:36,578
He also writes devotional verse

1444
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:39,745
Mean? You know Sanskrit?

1445
01:44:40,021 --> 01:44:43,422
Enough to get along
- He knows it well

1446
01:44:43,858 --> 01:44:47,021
These days, anyone
writes about the holy bLooks

1447
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:50,820
This is a question of rights

1448
01:44:50,898 --> 01:44:53,594
But also, people should
stick to what they know

1449
01:44:53,968 --> 01:44:56,334
for instan ce, I wrould have liked...

1450
01:44:56,404 --> 01:44:58,463
...to discuss prices of
rice and cereal with you

1451
01:45:00,408 --> 01:45:04,902
We would have given you the
contract for the monastery

1452
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,507
Or why don't you do this?

1453
01:45:08,549 --> 01:45:10,244
The monastery is spacious

1454
01:45:10,952 --> 01:45:13,944
We'll install your Vitthal idol there

1455
01:45:15,056 --> 01:45:17,684
You look after the temple

1456
01:45:18,059 --> 01:45:20,550
You take all the earnings

1457
01:45:20,628 --> 01:45:23,392
And donate a bit to the monastery

1458
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:26,994
You have misunderstood

1459
01:45:27,635 --> 01:45:29,330
One temple is hereditary

1460
01:45:29,704 --> 01:45:32,468
It's there for devotion, not profit

1461
01:45:33,474 --> 01:45:38,002
Wait. We haven't finished

1462
01:45:38,846 --> 01:45:40,939
We came for something else

1463
01:45:41,015 --> 01:45:44,451
He writes. He had some
questions on the BhagwadgeIta

1464
01:45:44,518 --> 01:45:46,076
Fine. Ask...

1465
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,545
No! I've got the answers

1466
01:45:53,127 --> 01:45:54,424
Didn't I tell you?

1467
01:45:54,895 --> 01:45:57,955
This is Tuka!
We have to teach him a lesson

1468
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:03,397
He's no scholar. He's a businessman

1469
01:46:03,704 --> 01:46:05,763
He'll lord it over
everyone if he goes to the markIt

1470
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,364
And a hypocrite!

1471
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:11,041
It's the short guys who
need to struggle to seem tall

1472
01:46:11,112 --> 01:46:12,875
A cot is a challenge for the bedbug

1473
01:46:12,947 --> 01:46:15,108
It's a long way to climb!
- Brother - What?

1474
01:46:15,182 --> 01:46:17,047
A wolf bit Laxman,
the blacksmith's son - What?

1475
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:18,642
Oh God! let's go

1476
01:46:20,788 --> 01:46:23,120
What happened Laxman?

1477
01:46:23,424 --> 01:46:24,584
Wolves attacked me

1478
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:26,752
Theyn have bitten the
flesh off your arrrm

1479
01:46:26,827 --> 01:46:28,818
Didn't you go to see a girl to marry?
- Yes

1480
01:46:29,096 --> 01:46:30,120
I left in the morning

1481
01:46:30,665 --> 01:46:33,862
I stopped at the well to eat.
Two wolves came at me

1482
01:46:33,934 --> 01:46:35,595
And then?
- Then...

1483
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:39,106
I had my axe. I killed both
- Lord Pandurang...

1484
01:46:39,407 --> 01:46:41,932
come on
- Carefullyn.

1485
01:46:42,009 --> 01:46:43,738
Slowly.

1486
01:46:44,478 --> 01:46:48,073
Oh no! What happened?

1487
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:50,617
Wolves bit him
- Where?

1488
01:46:50,685 --> 01:46:52,050
Near the well.
- Sit

1489
01:46:52,119 --> 01:46:55,088
He killed them - Oh God!
- get some tumeric

1490
01:46:55,389 --> 01:46:57,016
Oh no!
- We have applied some medicinal herbs

1491
01:46:57,758 --> 01:46:59,817
Your son is brave. Don't worry
- But?

1492
01:47:03,064 --> 01:47:07,592
If you had brought their tails
you would have won a huge award

1493
01:47:07,668 --> 01:47:09,101
What award?
- Yes

1494
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:10,865
Wolves are a big problem

1495
01:47:11,138 --> 01:47:15,472
King Shivaji gives an award to those
who kill them and get their tails

1496
01:47:16,377 --> 01:47:18,538
Come Subhan...
- Where

1497
01:47:18,612 --> 01:47:19,977
Uncle, there's really an award?

1498
01:47:20,047 --> 01:47:21,947
Yes. But get well first

1499
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:25,383
No. I killed them. Someone
else will claim the award

1500
01:47:25,453 --> 01:47:26,681
Come Subhan...
- Okay

1501
01:47:27,455 --> 01:47:29,719
My boy, you're not well enough to go

1502
01:47:32,126 --> 01:47:35,391
Okay Kanhoba, I'm off on pilgrimage

1503
01:47:35,996 --> 01:47:37,486
I'll meIt Lord Vitthal and rIturn

1504
01:47:37,565 --> 01:47:41,399
Yes brother - Yes, you nod
your head and he's scot free

1505
01:47:42,036 --> 01:47:45,028
I don't know what wealth
that black God has stored there

1506
01:47:45,339 --> 01:47:46,465
You come with me too

1507
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,973
No need. I'm fine here!

1508
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:51,671
If you don't, how will you
understand the God's glory?

1509
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:54,445
It's enough that I know your glory

1510
01:47:55,049 --> 01:47:58,348
So? Ready to go on pilgrimage?

1511
01:47:58,419 --> 01:48:01,081
No, not this time

1512
01:48:01,155 --> 01:48:03,385
Why? Is everyone okay at home

1513
01:48:03,457 --> 01:48:04,719
Yes.

1514
01:48:04,792 --> 01:48:07,886
But Digubhat said that the planIts
are not favourable for my daughter

1515
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:10,688
We have to do a propitiatory rite

1516
01:48:10,765 --> 01:48:13,791
So the planIts move
according to Digubhat's wishes?

1517
01:48:14,502 --> 01:48:15,628
And if that was so...

1518
01:48:15,703 --> 01:48:17,762
...would his own wife be ailing?

1519
01:48:18,572 --> 01:48:20,005
This is all rubbish

1520
01:48:20,808 --> 01:48:23,800
You'll do the rite and
Digubhat's lot will improve

1521
01:48:24,945 --> 01:48:26,572
Take my son along

1522
01:48:26,647 --> 01:48:28,080
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1523
01:48:28,382 --> 01:48:30,816
Take care of him
- orrd Pan durran g does that

1524
01:48:30,885 --> 01:48:33,683
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1525
01:48:33,754 --> 01:48:38,384
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1526
01:48:38,459 --> 01:48:42,725
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1527
01:48:42,797 --> 01:48:44,594
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1528
01:48:44,665 --> 01:48:46,826
Tuka, just talk to him

1529
01:48:46,901 --> 01:48:48,493
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1530
01:48:48,569 --> 01:48:51,060
Glory be to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna

1531
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:54,668
Tuka, just talk to him

1532
01:48:54,742 --> 01:48:57,040
That landowner praised him

1533
01:48:57,111 --> 01:48:58,806
And he's off to work for him

1534
01:48:58,879 --> 01:49:01,473
Not a landowner
- It's King Shivaji

1535
01:49:01,549 --> 01:49:02,811
You mIt him?

1536
01:49:02,883 --> 01:49:05,010
Yes. He spoke to me

1537
01:49:05,085 --> 01:49:07,417
He asked you to work for him?
- Yes

1538
01:49:07,488 --> 01:49:10,787
Then why wait? You'll be his soldier

1539
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:13,786
People sleep in peace
because soldiers guard them

1540
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:15,852
What are you saying Tuka?

1541
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:19,024
Landowners used to abduct women

1542
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,764
Shivaji broke their limbs

1543
01:49:21,836 --> 01:49:23,667
See what he's doing

1544
01:49:23,737 --> 01:49:24,795
What?

1545
01:49:24,872 --> 01:49:26,931
He said he wants our rule

1546
01:49:27,007 --> 01:49:28,804
Yes. Our rule...

1547
01:49:29,076 --> 01:49:30,509
...is the rule of the people

1548
01:49:30,845 --> 01:49:34,440
He is the people's king and
your son will work for him

1549
01:49:34,715 --> 01:49:38,583
Trust in Lord
Pandurang and let Laxman go

1550
01:49:40,554 --> 01:49:44,991
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

1551
01:49:45,059 --> 01:49:49,689
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

1552
01:49:49,763 --> 01:49:54,393
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

1553
01:49:54,468 --> 01:49:56,732
I will be a mendicant;

1554
01:49:56,804 --> 01:49:59,773
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1555
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:03,672
I will be a mendicant;

1556
01:50:03,744 --> 01:50:05,803
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1557
01:50:08,516 --> 01:50:10,643
To take Vithoba's name...

1558
01:50:10,718 --> 01:50:13,084
...is my practice and my religion

1559
01:50:13,153 --> 01:50:15,087
I will be a mendicant;

1560
01:50:15,389 --> 01:50:18,051
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1561
01:50:22,396 --> 01:50:27,663
I will pay homage to all the saints

1562
01:50:29,136 --> 01:50:33,800
I will pay homage to all the saints

1563
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:38,573
Tuka says "Oh God, this is
my artless service for you"

1564
01:50:38,646 --> 01:50:40,705
I will be a mendicant;

1565
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:42,942
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1566
01:50:43,017 --> 01:50:45,349
I will be a mendicant;

1567
01:50:45,419 --> 01:50:47,546
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1568
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:49,782
I will be a mendicant;

1569
01:50:49,857 --> 01:50:52,951
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

1570
01:51:17,885 --> 01:51:23,050
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

1571
01:51:23,357 --> 01:51:27,657
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

1572
01:51:27,728 --> 01:51:30,595
Come on. Tukaram's
narration has started

1573
01:51:30,664 --> 01:51:32,689
Mother-in-law, please finish
doing the flatbread I'll be back

1574
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:44,776
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1575
01:51:44,845 --> 01:51:49,839
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1576
01:51:49,917 --> 01:51:57,881
Discrimination is an unholy illusion

1577
01:51:57,958 --> 01:52:03,055
isten all you devotees

1578
01:52:03,364 --> 01:52:08,495
isten all you devotees

1579
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:16,442
Carry out the good that you want to

1580
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:21,607
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1581
01:52:21,682 --> 01:52:27,018
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1582
01:52:31,992 --> 01:52:36,861
Do not envy any creature

1583
01:52:37,164 --> 01:52:42,500
Do not envy any creature

1584
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:47,632
That is the gist of God's worship

1585
01:52:47,708 --> 01:52:52,873
That is the gist of God's worship

1586
01:52:52,946 --> 01:52:58,043
Tuka says the organs
of knowledge and action

1587
01:52:58,118 --> 01:53:03,021
Tuka says the organs
of knowledge and action

1588
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:05,991
Belong to one body...

1589
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:11,430
...which experiences joy and sorrow

1590
01:53:11,498 --> 01:53:16,435
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1591
01:53:16,503 --> 01:53:21,634
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1592
01:53:21,709 --> 01:53:27,443
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

1593
01:53:33,487 --> 01:53:38,390
Is there a place

1594
01:53:38,459 --> 01:53:42,793
Is there a place

1595
01:53:42,863 --> 01:53:47,391
Where there is instant loss of ego?

1596
01:53:47,468 --> 01:53:52,371
Where there is instant loss of ego?

1597
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:56,933
It happens in Vitthal's Pandharpur

1598
01:53:57,010 --> 01:54:01,709
It happens in Vitthal's Pandharpur

1599
01:54:01,782 --> 01:54:06,344
One is totally spellbound

1600
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:10,754
One is totally spellbound

1601
01:54:11,525 --> 01:54:15,655
Brother Savji
- One is totally spellbound

1602
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:17,594
where were you for so long?

1603
01:54:18,031 --> 01:54:20,431
We looked for you all over

1604
01:54:21,535 --> 01:54:23,696
orrd vithoba has rmade us meIt

1605
01:54:24,571 --> 01:54:27,699
Now come on home.
Enough of your wandering

1606
01:54:28,008 --> 01:54:32,604
I travelled all over,
but what did I find?

1607
01:54:33,714 --> 01:54:35,875
You achieved so much while
continuing with your family life

1608
01:54:35,949 --> 01:54:38,383
But I gained nothing
despite giving up family

1609
01:54:39,419 --> 01:54:42,286
I knew of your fame.
I heard your narration too

1610
01:54:42,589 --> 01:54:45,752
Every word you spoke spouted
springs of devotion in people's hearts

1611
01:54:46,593 --> 01:54:48,390
This is true salvation!

1612
01:54:48,896 --> 01:54:53,595
Should I have searched within
myself instead of going away?

1613
01:54:54,067 --> 01:54:58,902
They all touch each other's feIt

1614
01:54:58,972 --> 01:55:03,500
They all touch each other's feIt

1615
01:55:03,577 --> 01:55:07,445
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1616
01:55:07,514 --> 01:55:11,006
Oh Lord Pandurang...!
- Brother Savji...

1617
01:55:11,084 --> 01:55:14,611
Oh Lord Pandurang...!
- Brother Savji...

1618
01:55:14,688 --> 01:55:17,816
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1619
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:21,054
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1620
01:55:21,361 --> 01:55:24,353
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1621
01:55:24,431 --> 01:55:28,527
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1622
01:55:30,504 --> 01:55:35,032
Tuka says... Tuka says...
Everyone is harping on his name

1623
01:55:35,342 --> 01:55:37,606
This is really shameful

1624
01:55:37,678 --> 01:55:39,441
We must do something!

1625
01:55:39,513 --> 01:55:42,277
It was okay when it
was restricted to Dehu

1626
01:55:42,549 --> 01:55:45,746
But now his fame has
spread far and wide

1627
01:55:45,819 --> 01:55:53,487
Kulkarni, Malharpant, Mawal...

1628
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:59,658
...all these brahmins are
also hanging on his words

1629
01:55:59,733 --> 01:56:03,066
And we're sitting here doling
out sweIts as God's blessing

1630
01:56:03,136 --> 01:56:05,696
You think I'm not in demand elsewhere?

1631
01:56:05,772 --> 01:56:09,299
Yesterday, I was invited
to Lohagaon. Just watch

1632
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:14,380
I'll build armies of my
supporters in every town

1633
01:56:17,084 --> 01:56:18,813
I gave birth to myself

1634
01:56:19,519 --> 01:56:21,384
Was born from my own womb

1635
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:25,551
My existence lies in my own hands

1636
01:56:27,127 --> 01:56:29,425
We blessed saints have
transcended birth and death

1637
01:56:29,496 --> 01:56:31,054
What are you blabbering?

1638
01:56:31,598 --> 01:56:32,895
What are you thinking of?

1639
01:56:34,067 --> 01:56:36,865
I want to go to Dehu to meIt Tukaram

1640
01:56:37,204 --> 01:56:38,535
Are you crazy?

1641
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,801
That man has cast a spell on you

1642
01:56:44,111 --> 01:56:47,308
Then you come with me

1643
01:56:47,714 --> 01:56:50,512
So you will follow him?

1644
01:56:50,584 --> 01:56:52,051
And I should follow you?

1645
01:56:52,653 --> 01:56:55,952
Then let me go. Tukaram says

1646
01:56:56,356 --> 01:56:58,051
'False laughterr, false tears'

1647
01:56:58,692 --> 01:57:00,751
"Mine and yours; it's all false"

1648
01:57:01,795 --> 01:57:02,989
"Worldly life is false"

1649
01:57:03,397 --> 01:57:07,834
"Relationships too!
It's all child's play"

1650
01:57:08,468 --> 01:57:10,095
Please let me go...

1651
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:12,400
...and build a
relationship with Lord Vitthal

1652
01:57:12,472 --> 01:57:15,498
A relationship with
God or with Tukaram?

1653
01:57:16,443 --> 01:57:18,104
I won't let you go alone

1654
01:57:19,613 --> 01:57:23,379
Not alone. I'll take
Kapila (the cow) with me

1655
01:57:30,757 --> 01:57:34,318
See how important I am?
- Yes

1656
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:39,690
What are you doing?

1657
01:57:39,766 --> 01:57:41,063
come, sit dowrn here

1658
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:45,770
You are from Tukoba's Dehu village

1659
01:57:46,073 --> 01:57:49,634
Seeing you is like meIting him

1660
01:57:50,344 --> 01:57:51,777
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

1661
01:57:54,014 --> 01:57:56,676
Wonder when I will meIt him.
Only Lord Pandurang knows about it.

1662
01:57:57,117 --> 01:58:00,848
I wrill come to do a narrrration
for you - Goodbye. Pan durran g...

1663
01:58:10,764 --> 01:58:12,061
Santu... what?

1664
01:58:12,432 --> 01:58:16,869
Nothing. Just massaging your back

1665
01:58:17,437 --> 01:58:19,302
get to the point Sir

1666
01:58:19,973 --> 01:58:24,967
I wrote something.
Will you hear it? - Yes

1667
01:58:28,715 --> 01:58:30,046
Listen.

1668
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:33,348
I became an oilman

1669
01:58:33,754 --> 01:58:35,483
I learnt to run the oil mill naturally

1670
01:58:36,456 --> 01:58:38,481
This oil mill is extremely intelligent

1671
01:58:38,558 --> 01:58:40,321
It has waves of discrItion

1672
01:58:40,927 --> 01:58:42,827
We will draw this oil (of devotion)

1673
01:58:43,096 --> 01:58:44,791
And break the mass of desire

1674
01:58:45,665 --> 01:58:47,496
Having drawn this oil

1675
01:58:47,901 --> 01:58:49,664
The Saint will sell it in the markIt

1676
01:58:50,604 --> 01:58:52,572
Santu the oilman draws
the oil (of devotion)

1677
01:58:53,073 --> 01:58:54,665
It will never run out

1678
01:58:57,110 --> 01:59:00,341
You are blessed Santu,
you will become great

1679
01:59:00,414 --> 01:59:02,075
You have a lot of wisdom

1680
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:04,674
People criticize you for no reason

1681
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:06,548
Believe me when I tell you this

1682
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,678
You like it?
- Master...

1683
01:59:09,689 --> 01:59:14,786
Master...
- What are you doing? Who are you?

1684
01:59:15,695 --> 01:59:21,827
I'm Bahinai.
I've come from Kolhapur to see you

1685
01:59:23,036 --> 01:59:27,029
I have drunk my thirst,
eaten my hunger (forgotten everything)

1686
01:59:28,742 --> 01:59:31,677
Master, I want to be your disciple

1687
01:59:35,048 --> 01:59:37,448
Bhagu, get some water and jaggery

1688
01:59:37,517 --> 01:59:40,008
Okay
- You've come from so far

1689
01:59:40,087 --> 01:59:42,317
Rest awhile

1690
01:59:42,756 --> 01:59:44,246
Then we'll talk

1691
01:59:44,825 --> 01:59:51,321
Take it - No Master.
Tell me, will you induct me?

1692
01:59:51,932 --> 01:59:53,593
She's very stubborn.

1693
01:59:53,867 --> 01:59:57,633
Say 'Yes' or she won't
even drink a drop of water

1694
01:59:58,004 --> 02:00:00,666
She sings your verses all day

1695
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:02,935
You are?
- Her unfortunate husband!

1696
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:08,745
Adyn, becoming a disciple...

1697
02:00:08,815 --> 02:00:10,339
...means walking with support

1698
02:00:12,919 --> 02:00:15,820
And if Lord Pandurang wanted
everyone to become my disciple...

1699
02:00:15,889 --> 02:00:20,883
...why would he have let
different flames in every heart?

1700
02:00:22,129 --> 02:00:24,893
My verses may be like
momentary lightening

1701
02:00:25,465 --> 02:00:27,763
They may light the way for a moment

1702
02:00:28,802 --> 02:00:33,000
But you must use your inner
glow to light up your life

1703
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:54,556
Kapila, I have got what I wanted

1704
02:00:56,396 --> 02:00:59,058
I listen to Tukaram's
narration every night

1705
02:00:59,733 --> 02:01:01,257
And live in this monastery

1706
02:01:03,603 --> 02:01:09,405
The Master says "See the world
through the light in your heart"

1707
02:01:10,377 --> 02:01:13,778
But when his 'abhangs' light
up everything so clearly...

1708
02:01:14,381 --> 02:01:16,372
...why would I use my faint lamp?

1709
02:01:18,051 --> 02:01:19,575
Will people laugh at me?

1710
02:01:21,121 --> 02:01:24,852
But really, It's so wonderful
to hear him speak

1711
02:01:25,792 --> 02:01:27,555
Do you think I should try to write?

1712
02:01:28,662 --> 02:01:33,895
See what Mambajibuva,
this monastery's head, says

1713
02:01:33,967 --> 02:01:37,425
I heard that you ate
at Tukaram's house

1714
02:01:37,704 --> 02:01:38,966
You want to be his disciple

1715
02:01:39,406 --> 02:01:43,604
Is it proper for a brahmin lady
like you to bow to a low caste?

1716
02:01:43,677 --> 02:01:45,611
Brahmins and low castes?

1717
02:01:45,912 --> 02:01:47,846
We are pilgrims of Vithoba

1718
02:01:48,515 --> 02:01:50,039
We don't discriminate

1719
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:51,942
What does Tukya know?

1720
02:01:52,986 --> 02:01:56,979
He can't become a scholar by
reading holy bLooks and singing verses

1721
02:01:57,724 --> 02:02:01,319
There are many wise people
in the world Be their disciple

1722
02:02:01,394 --> 02:02:03,885
He has agreed to instruct you

1723
02:02:04,331 --> 02:02:05,389
Yes

1724
02:02:05,465 --> 02:02:08,696
I'm looking for common sense;
not wisdom

1725
02:02:12,439 --> 02:02:15,567
Govind, Parshuram, come here

1726
02:02:15,842 --> 02:02:20,438
What happened?
- Throw their belongings out! Go!

1727
02:02:20,513 --> 02:02:23,380
Isten to me
- No! You can't stayn here.

1728
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:26,578
I offered a brahmin
couple a roof for a few days

1729
02:02:26,653 --> 02:02:27,915
Not for this tomfoolery

1730
02:02:27,988 --> 02:02:30,047
Don't do this...
- Out...

1731
02:02:30,123 --> 02:02:32,091
Please don't do this

1732
02:02:32,492 --> 02:02:34,551
Where will we go?

1733
02:02:34,628 --> 02:02:38,792
Don't do that
- Throw their stuff out. This cow too

1734
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:14,758
Listen
- Yes.

1735
02:03:15,068 --> 02:03:16,695
Is this Dehu village?
- Yes

1736
02:03:17,337 --> 02:03:19,828
King Shivaji wants to
visit the blacksmith

1737
02:03:20,674 --> 02:03:22,574
Where is the king?
- There

1738
02:03:28,715 --> 02:03:29,943
I'll show you

1739
02:03:35,388 --> 02:03:37,413
What do you do?
- Nothing

1740
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:38,582
Nothing?

1741
02:03:38,992 --> 02:03:40,789
I have a business and some land

1742
02:03:41,728 --> 02:03:44,026
My brother looks after the
business HE (God) tills the farm

1743
02:03:44,097 --> 02:03:48,466
And you tend to animals?
- Someone has to do it

1744
02:03:49,869 --> 02:03:52,463
I hear there's a big
saint called Tukaram

1745
02:03:53,306 --> 02:03:56,434
A saint?
- Isn't he one?

1746
02:03:56,710 --> 02:03:59,975
In these troubled times,
there's a saint in every home

1747
02:04:00,413 --> 02:04:01,812
Really?
- Yes.

1748
02:04:02,349 --> 02:04:05,318
His wife criticizes him;
his children scream at him

1749
02:04:05,385 --> 02:04:07,319
The learned priests oppose him
- I see

1750
02:04:07,854 --> 02:04:10,652
Has anyone see him worship properly?

1751
02:04:11,057 --> 02:04:12,786
Has he ever done religious rites?

1752
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:15,291
Or propitiated the planIts? No!

1753
02:04:15,762 --> 02:04:18,890
He only advises people
to be good Is that enough?

1754
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:21,294
But that is a necessity

1755
02:04:23,703 --> 02:04:26,501
Some wise men get close to God

1756
02:04:27,507 --> 02:04:30,499
Some even hug him like a child

1757
02:04:30,977 --> 02:04:33,741
But Tukaram's knowledge is
sparse and his pride boundless

1758
02:04:34,948 --> 02:04:37,280
I tell you He is unduly popular

1759
02:04:37,851 --> 02:04:39,409
Queues of people

1760
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:43,021
He has no time to meIt himself!
How will he meIt God?

1761
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:55,324
Axman told me that Tukaram is so
sirmple; it's tough to rrecognizozoe him

1762
02:04:57,904 --> 02:04:58,996
Your Majesty...

1763
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:02,806
Tukoba...
- What?

1764
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:06,411
Who else would be so
candid about himself?

1765
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:07,878
Sorry Master
- It's okay.

1766
02:05:09,983 --> 02:05:11,245
How is Laxman?

1767
02:05:12,952 --> 02:05:14,385
God tLook him away

1768
02:05:17,424 --> 02:05:18,584
Pandurang!

1769
02:05:18,958 --> 02:05:22,325
He put his life in danger to save me

1770
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:24,792
We couldn't bring his body

1771
02:05:26,065 --> 02:05:27,532
The King did all the rites

1772
02:05:29,135 --> 02:05:30,363
We have the ashes

1773
02:05:37,377 --> 02:05:38,435
Hanmya...

1774
02:05:43,716 --> 02:05:45,581
Tuka... what?

1775
02:05:45,885 --> 02:05:47,045
look who's here

1776
02:05:48,621 --> 02:05:53,558
The person Laxman worshipped.
King Shivaji!

1777
02:05:54,027 --> 02:05:56,552
Great!
- It's okay.

1778
02:05:57,564 --> 02:05:59,555
I am honoured, your majesty

1779
02:05:59,899 --> 02:06:03,027
My Laxman is always
full of praise for you

1780
02:06:04,137 --> 02:06:08,767
Today his majesty is
here to praise Laxman

1781
02:06:17,984 --> 02:06:19,076
Laxman!

1782
02:06:28,795 --> 02:06:31,958
Laxman...!

1783
02:06:38,505 --> 02:06:41,099
Laxman...!

1784
02:06:41,708 --> 02:06:44,905
Axman...!

1785
02:06:49,749 --> 02:06:52,013
Your discourses
strengthened our efforts

1786
02:06:53,419 --> 02:06:56,047
My father tried to
establish an empire too

1787
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:58,050
But that bore no fruit

1788
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:01,927
Because slavery was in
the people's mindsIt

1789
02:07:01,995 --> 02:07:03,986
But you saint-poIts
gave them self-respect

1790
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:09,090
So many young men like Laxman
voluntered to fight these intruders

1791
02:07:09,402 --> 02:07:11,734
It's big of you to say that!

1792
02:07:13,006 --> 02:07:18,000
My mother wishes to honour
you and reward you in court

1793
02:07:19,612 --> 02:07:20,670
You must come

1794
02:07:21,648 --> 02:07:26,676
Oh king, I would never turn
down this affectionate invitation

1795
02:07:28,054 --> 02:07:31,023
But I feel that my task is different

1796
02:07:31,524 --> 02:07:34,960
To create peace in people's
minds through Lord Vitthal's worship

1797
02:07:35,028 --> 02:07:36,893
To travel all over the valleys
and dales of the Sahyadri mountains

1798
02:07:36,963 --> 02:07:38,863
To find brave men like Laxman

1799
02:07:39,132 --> 02:07:41,566
To send them to you; that is my job

1800
02:07:42,702 --> 02:07:45,034
To give them
strength to fight injustice

1801
02:07:45,104 --> 02:07:47,572
To protect your citizens, is your job

1802
02:07:49,442 --> 02:07:51,501
It's best that we
work in our own areas

1803
02:07:52,946 --> 02:07:56,404
You said that my
contribution strengthens your task

1804
02:07:56,916 --> 02:07:58,042
That is my reward

1805
02:07:58,818 --> 02:08:01,309
Your gift to me!

1806
02:08:18,171 --> 02:08:19,570
What happened?

1807
02:08:19,639 --> 02:08:22,301
My sister's getting married.
Digubhat didn't show up

1808
02:08:22,909 --> 02:08:24,467
The guests were getting
delayed so we did the wedding...

1809
02:08:24,544 --> 02:08:26,068
...without a priest. They punished me

1810
02:08:26,813 --> 02:08:28,075
Mambaji, what is this?

1811
02:08:28,147 --> 02:08:29,614
Move out of my way

1812
02:08:29,682 --> 02:08:32,776
Why? If someone else chants the
hymns, is the wedding invalid?

1813
02:08:33,386 --> 02:08:34,876
Or are those hymns less effective?

1814
02:08:35,154 --> 02:08:36,951
This is a matter of religion

1815
02:08:37,023 --> 02:08:38,650
Religion or business?

1816
02:08:38,725 --> 02:08:40,852
He wanted remuneration from both sides

1817
02:08:40,927 --> 02:08:43,919
So what? It's our right
to perform marriage rites

1818
02:08:43,997 --> 02:08:46,557
Why? Because you are God's manager?

1819
02:08:46,633 --> 02:08:47,657
Yes!

1820
02:08:47,967 --> 02:08:49,764
Religion is God's administration and...

1821
02:08:49,836 --> 02:08:52,464
...so, as you say, we are His managers

1822
02:08:52,538 --> 02:08:54,938
So you blacken the
face of our poor Damu?

1823
02:08:55,008 --> 02:08:59,377
No other alternative - At least
fear that God might be watching

1824
02:08:59,912 --> 02:09:02,710
These simple, ignorant
people turn a stone into God

1825
02:09:03,449 --> 02:09:06,384
And you decide that
God knows nothing...

1826
02:09:06,452 --> 02:09:07,646
...an d turrn H irm into a stone!

1827
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,744
Tuka!

1828
02:09:09,355 --> 02:09:11,050
Damu, get down!

1829
02:09:11,357 --> 02:09:12,688
Don't you dare

1830
02:09:12,759 --> 02:09:14,750
Stop... you'll regrIt
it if you touch Tukaram

1831
02:09:14,827 --> 02:09:17,762
Yes... Yes...
- Damu, get down

1832
02:09:18,698 --> 02:09:20,393
You haven't committed any crime

1833
02:09:20,466 --> 02:09:22,400
Tuka, I have two more daughters

1834
02:09:22,468 --> 02:09:25,699
Don't worry. If these
priests continue in this manner...

1835
02:09:25,772 --> 02:09:28,764
...we'll marry off
your girls without them!

1836
02:09:34,113 --> 02:09:38,015
Tukya, let's just see for how
long these people stand by you

1837
02:09:41,421 --> 02:09:42,581
Oh Vitthal, what's all this?

1838
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:46,017
What religion in
this that bends people?

1839
02:09:46,092 --> 02:09:48,390
Religion should teach them to stand

1840
02:09:49,429 --> 02:09:50,794
You endorse such a religion?

1841
02:09:51,631 --> 02:09:53,826
One that makes
people numb and powerless?

1842
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,868
No? Then why are you silent?

1843
02:09:56,602 --> 02:09:59,833
You actually watch this
harassment in the name of religion?

1844
02:10:00,339 --> 02:10:01,738
What do I say to you?

1845
02:10:02,875 --> 02:10:05,366
Now let people praise
you as much as they wish

1846
02:10:06,379 --> 02:10:07,937
for me, God is dead...

1847
02:10:09,549 --> 02:10:10,743
I don't care what others think!

1848
02:10:11,484 --> 02:10:13,611
It your speech sayn that God exists

1849
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:15,985
But experience in your
mind that he is formless

1850
02:10:22,695 --> 02:10:23,753
Tuka...!

1851
02:10:31,704 --> 02:10:33,899
We servants of Lord
Vishnu are softer than wax

1852
02:10:33,973 --> 02:10:35,873
But also hard enough to break
the weapon of the king of Gods

1853
02:10:36,142 --> 02:10:38,110
We will give even our
loincloths to the virtuous

1854
02:10:38,177 --> 02:10:40,111
Bur we will smack the
wicked on the head with a stick

1855
02:10:40,646 --> 02:10:43,046
Do these fellows think we
servants of Lord Vishnu are weaklings?

1856
02:10:43,483 --> 02:10:46,316
I was trying to persuade them,
hoping that they'd change

1857
02:10:46,385 --> 02:10:49,650
But they are taking advantage
and stinging these simple folk

1858
02:10:49,722 --> 02:10:51,451
They have to be taught a lesson

1859
02:10:51,724 --> 02:10:52,850
for the guinea-worm on the foot

1860
02:10:52,925 --> 02:10:54,358
Some camphor was applied

1861
02:10:54,427 --> 02:10:55,894
Actually, it needed something stronger

1862
02:10:55,962 --> 02:10:57,486
Evil people deserve tit for tat

1863
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:58,922
When the scorpion
climbs on the holy idol

1864
02:10:58,998 --> 02:11:00,693
It's not because it likes to worship

1865
02:11:00,767 --> 02:11:02,530
It must be hit with a shoe

1866
02:11:02,602 --> 02:11:03,899
All evil deserves tit for tat

1867
02:11:03,970 --> 02:11:06,996
That Tukya...
He calls saints donkeys...

1868
02:11:07,673 --> 02:11:08,833
...an d scorrpions

1869
02:11:10,042 --> 02:11:11,771
...an d snakes

1870
02:11:13,513 --> 02:11:15,447
He has to be taught a lesson!

1871
02:11:15,748 --> 02:11:17,375
They call themselves saints?

1872
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:19,513
Some saints belonging to our times

1873
02:11:19,585 --> 02:11:20,950
Smoke pipes of tobacco

1874
02:11:21,821 --> 02:11:23,049
They forego religious rituals

1875
02:11:23,122 --> 02:11:24,555
They indulge in
intoxicating substances

1876
02:11:24,857 --> 02:11:26,518
Intoxicating drugs are their habit

1877
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:27,957
And they are used to drinking liquor

1878
02:11:28,427 --> 02:11:30,361
Tuka says "They are all hypocrites"

1879
02:11:30,429 --> 02:11:31,862
"They have no real
connection with God!"

1880
02:11:32,165 --> 02:11:33,860
This Tukya...

1881
02:11:33,933 --> 02:11:35,901
He will utterly ruin our religion

1882
02:11:35,968 --> 02:11:37,526
He will destroy it

1883
02:11:42,375 --> 02:11:45,606
Avali, you came?
- Yes

1884
02:11:46,345 --> 02:11:49,337
You should have sent Kanha,
or the kids

1885
02:11:49,715 --> 02:11:51,683
That's okay

1886
02:11:53,019 --> 02:11:55,283
Your legs were hurting the other day

1887
02:11:55,655 --> 02:11:59,455
You climbed all this way...
- That's okay

1888
02:12:00,827 --> 02:12:02,727
Have I been here many days?

1889
02:12:03,462 --> 02:12:06,056
No. Just a couple

1890
02:12:06,766 --> 02:12:10,031
People must have
gathered asking where I am

1891
02:12:10,603 --> 02:12:12,764
No. No one did

1892
02:12:14,006 --> 02:12:15,405
You came to get me?

1893
02:12:16,075 --> 02:12:17,872
No, not at all

1894
02:12:18,477 --> 02:12:21,071
I've brought flatbread. And bed sheIts

1895
02:12:21,747 --> 02:12:24,079
We can stay for a few more days!
- Really?

1896
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:25,549
Of course

1897
02:12:25,618 --> 02:12:28,917
Just rinse out your mouth.
And eat something

1898
02:12:32,992 --> 02:12:36,018
Tell me
- What?

1899
02:12:36,729 --> 02:12:37,787
Whatever happens...

1900
02:12:37,864 --> 02:12:41,960
...happens because it's
your black God's wish?

1901
02:12:44,103 --> 02:12:45,764
Without doubt!

1902
02:12:46,739 --> 02:12:50,231
So all our losses,
bankruptcy were his wish? - Yes

1903
02:12:52,411 --> 02:12:54,971
He ruined our business,
tLook away our family members...

1904
02:12:55,681 --> 02:12:57,342
Then why do you still worship him?

1905
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:01,445
You tell me Avali...

1906
02:13:02,688 --> 02:13:04,918
You have lost everything with me

1907
02:13:05,892 --> 02:13:07,450
Then why do you still live with me?

1908
02:13:07,894 --> 02:13:09,054
I have to

1909
02:13:09,629 --> 02:13:11,654
My life is tied to yours

1910
02:13:11,731 --> 02:13:13,756
That's what I realized too

1911
02:13:14,734 --> 02:13:16,895
My life is tied to HIS!

1912
02:13:17,603 --> 02:13:19,002
So I have to walk with him

1913
02:13:19,939 --> 02:13:21,065
What's the matter?

1914
02:13:21,674 --> 02:13:22,766
It's a first for you...

1915
02:13:22,842 --> 02:13:26,437
...to tell me to stay here,
not return home

1916
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:29,547
You eat first

1917
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:33,518
What?
- Fine

1918
02:13:34,587 --> 02:13:35,918
Yesterday Mambaji came over

1919
02:13:36,422 --> 02:13:37,855
To ask for you

1920
02:13:39,091 --> 02:13:40,058
Brother-in-law said...

1921
02:13:40,359 --> 02:13:42,589
...that he has brought
the priest Rameshwar

1922
02:13:43,596 --> 02:13:45,029
They are planning some mischief

1923
02:13:46,866 --> 02:13:49,357
If they don't find you for
a couple of days, they'll go back

1924
02:13:53,072 --> 02:13:56,701
Where are you off to?

1925
02:13:56,776 --> 02:13:58,437
I have to go Avali

1926
02:13:59,412 --> 02:14:01,710
I have to do a narration tonight

1927
02:14:01,781 --> 02:14:06,809
They'll blacken your face.
Parade you on a donkey

1928
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:09,280
I became my own judge

1929
02:14:09,355 --> 02:14:10,913
I did not blindly follow the majority

1930
02:14:11,824 --> 02:14:15,055
Tradition doesn't have
to be obeyed blindly

1931
02:14:16,329 --> 02:14:18,729
Tradition is like the
river that carries...

1932
02:14:18,798 --> 02:14:22,427
sticks, stones and
garbage along with fertile soil

1933
02:14:23,002 --> 02:14:26,529
SomItimes, we need to ask our
cultivated minds what is good or bad

1934
02:14:26,605 --> 02:14:28,436
Hey, wait!

1935
02:14:36,849 --> 02:14:40,080
Come
- Enough. Wait...!

1936
02:14:40,386 --> 02:14:41,410
Wait

1937
02:14:48,561 --> 02:14:49,789
He is...

1938
02:14:58,104 --> 02:14:59,366
I see!

1939
02:15:00,806 --> 02:15:03,741
So you will decide the
suitabilety of tradition

1940
02:15:03,809 --> 02:15:06,471
Yes! Tuka says

1941
02:15:06,979 --> 02:15:08,344
We consider it our job

1942
02:15:08,414 --> 02:15:09,711
To teach morals to everyone

1943
02:15:10,349 --> 02:15:12,681
You will preach morals to the world

1944
02:15:12,752 --> 02:15:16,552
Why? Are all we priests dead?

1945
02:15:16,622 --> 02:15:19,785
Please sit Sir. We will
talk after my exposition

1946
02:15:20,092 --> 02:15:23,391
Fine. Now we have to
listen to your commentary

1947
02:15:23,462 --> 02:15:24,588
It has come to this!

1948
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:25,988
You were preaching to simple,

1949
02:15:26,065 --> 02:15:28,056
illeterate people in your
shrine at home

1950
02:15:28,134 --> 02:15:30,068
We let you do it And now you say...

1951
02:15:30,369 --> 02:15:32,360
We saints grasp the
essence of our scriptures

1952
02:15:32,438 --> 02:15:33,962
Those who merely recite
them are just beasts of burden

1953
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:35,803
You dare tell us this!

1954
02:15:36,342 --> 02:15:40,642
Great! You seem to know
many of Tukaram's verses

1955
02:15:42,148 --> 02:15:44,343
Shut up!

1956
02:15:44,917 --> 02:15:48,819
The real surprise is that the
devotional path easily grasped by...

1957
02:15:49,088 --> 02:15:51,056
...these illeterate people,
is beyond you

1958
02:15:51,357 --> 02:15:54,326
Enough!

1959
02:15:55,961 --> 02:15:57,952
I have an order from
the religious court

1960
02:15:59,098 --> 02:16:01,931
Your explanations
are confusing people...

1961
02:16:02,001 --> 02:16:03,491
...about tradition itself

1962
02:16:03,869 --> 02:16:09,637
You have to appear before the
religious court to provide the answers

1963
02:16:43,742 --> 02:16:44,936
QuiIt...

1964
02:16:47,847 --> 02:16:50,315
The religious court is in session

1965
02:16:50,916 --> 02:16:52,941
Rameshwarbhat and Mambaji...

1966
02:16:53,018 --> 02:16:56,476
...have complained against you

1967
02:16:56,789 --> 02:17:03,627
Tukoba, son of Bolhoba Ambile,
has crossed the ordained boundaries...

1968
02:17:03,696 --> 02:17:04,958
...of the caste system...

1969
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:09,433
...and committed the
grave crime of challenging it

1970
02:17:10,136 --> 02:17:14,095
Though he is of the lowest caste...

1971
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:17,941
...his writings
interprIt the scriptures

1972
02:17:19,145 --> 02:17:20,976
Though a low caste trader...

1973
02:17:21,413 --> 02:17:23,608
...he has brahmin
(upper caste) disciples...

1974
02:17:23,682 --> 02:17:26,708
...who also touch his feIt

1975
02:17:26,785 --> 02:17:29,310
He is accused of this as well.

1976
02:17:30,055 --> 02:17:32,023
These are serious accusations...

1977
02:17:32,691 --> 02:17:36,718
...registered in the
civil court more than once

1978
02:17:37,563 --> 02:17:42,023
If these are proved,
Tukoba Ambile will be sentenced...

1979
02:17:42,801 --> 02:17:48,068
...to leave his home, country
or receive corporal punishment

1980
02:17:48,674 --> 02:17:54,840
Before announcing the sentence,
he is given a chance to defend himself

1981
02:17:57,783 --> 02:18:00,377
Officers of the religious
court and all you good people

1982
02:18:02,588 --> 02:18:04,681
I will speak but
please do not think...

1983
02:18:04,757 --> 02:18:09,057
...this is an attempt to
get my punishment reduced

1984
02:18:09,795 --> 02:18:11,660
To begin with I don't know if...

1985
02:18:11,730 --> 02:18:13,994
...the accusations are
of a criminal nature

1986
02:18:15,601 --> 02:18:18,764
It is true that my verses
interprIt the Hindu scriptures

1987
02:18:19,405 --> 02:18:23,432
But I did not know that
I needed permission to do that

1988
02:18:24,777 --> 02:18:27,371
When a newborn sucks at
his mother's breasts...

1989
02:18:27,446 --> 02:18:31,348
...he needs no
sanction from any officer

1990
02:18:31,784 --> 02:18:33,684
I partLook of the
nectar of experience...

1991
02:18:33,752 --> 02:18:35,777
...From the scrripturres as innocentlyn...

1992
02:18:36,121 --> 02:18:39,022
...and then shared
it as God's blessings

1993
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:42,787
I do not feel that is a sin

1994
02:18:43,395 --> 02:18:45,488
lf, as the holy texts say...

1995
02:18:45,564 --> 02:18:48,533
...we are all created from
the same Divine Spirit...

1996
02:18:48,968 --> 02:18:50,959
...and will mingle with it after death

1997
02:18:51,036 --> 02:18:52,731
Then why this discrimination?

1998
02:18:53,672 --> 02:18:56,539
We all belong to the same letter
There should be no discrimination

1999
02:18:56,875 --> 02:18:59,400
Saint Kabir says that if God
wanted brahmins to be different...

2000
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:04,279
...he would have given them a sacred
thread and a shaven head at birth

2001
02:19:04,817 --> 02:19:07,342
And if he wished
Muslims to be different...

2002
02:19:07,419 --> 02:19:09,910
...they would have
been born circumcised

2003
02:19:09,989 --> 02:19:13,288
Don't mention Kabir;
he had no caste or religion

2004
02:19:13,692 --> 02:19:15,785
He was a bastard who
grew up on the streIts

2005
02:19:15,861 --> 02:19:17,419
Should I quote (the saint-poIt)
Dnyanadev?

2006
02:19:17,496 --> 02:19:19,521
No, he was an ascItic's child

2007
02:19:19,598 --> 02:19:20,656
That's strange!

2008
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:22,628
You brahmins agreed not to expel

2009
02:19:22,701 --> 02:19:24,965
nynanadev an d his siblin gs
From society

2010
02:19:25,037 --> 02:19:27,733
In rIturn, you made their
parents drown themselves

2011
02:19:27,806 --> 02:19:30,900
And you still label
him 'an ascItic's child'

2012
02:19:32,111 --> 02:19:34,978
What about the saint
Eknath from Paithan? - No

2013
02:19:35,047 --> 02:19:36,708
You don't want the scriptures,
pantheism...

2014
02:19:36,782 --> 02:19:38,716
...the tradition of
the pilgrimage to Vitthal

2015
02:19:38,784 --> 02:19:40,115
So what do you want?

2016
02:19:41,387 --> 02:19:44,788
You say that we have no
right to light up the darkness!

2017
02:19:44,857 --> 02:19:46,324
Then why don't you light it up?

2018
02:19:46,392 --> 02:19:47,882
You don't tell us what to do

2019
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:50,861
Everyone has the right to knowledge

2020
02:19:51,630 --> 02:19:53,461
All four castes, those even lower

2021
02:19:53,532 --> 02:19:58,629
Children, men, women,
even prostitutes - Prostitutes too?

2022
02:19:58,704 --> 02:20:00,399
Yes, they too!

2023
02:20:01,073 --> 02:20:05,442
We all have a right to celebrate
God's name; to go close to him

2024
02:20:05,511 --> 02:20:08,969
And making brahmins your disciples,
having them touch your feIt?

2025
02:20:10,115 --> 02:20:13,084
Amongst the pilgrim community,
we all touch each other's feIt

2026
02:20:13,686 --> 02:20:15,051
Dnyanadev says that...

2027
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,487
...is an obeisance to the
divine element in each of us

2028
02:20:19,024 --> 02:20:21,584
And I have never
made anyone a disciple

2029
02:20:21,994 --> 02:20:26,431
Disciples, establishing monasteries,
business-minded exploitation...

2030
02:20:26,498 --> 02:20:28,932
...that's the job of
people like Mambaji - Tukoba...

2031
02:20:29,768 --> 02:20:32,703
You may blabber all you want

2032
02:20:33,505 --> 02:20:35,973
But you have sinned
according to the religious texts

2033
02:20:37,109 --> 02:20:40,010
Are you aware of the
punishment for this crime?

2034
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:42,470
You must be knowing
that the holy texts...

2035
02:20:42,548 --> 02:20:47,781
...term even brahmins who lend money,
serve and farm as low caste?

2036
02:20:48,887 --> 02:20:51,913
These same brahmins who
consider untouchables impure...

2037
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:55,255
...go to their houses
to collect their loans

2038
02:20:55,561 --> 02:20:56,858
What do you call that?

2039
02:20:58,497 --> 02:21:00,362
This law is only for us?

2040
02:21:00,432 --> 02:21:02,423
You are talking more than you need to

2041
02:21:02,501 --> 02:21:04,867
The truth is secure within me
There is no confusion whatsoever

2042
02:21:04,937 --> 02:21:06,404
I give sharp answers

2043
02:21:06,472 --> 02:21:07,803
In order to improve
myself in my future journey!

2044
02:21:07,873 --> 02:21:11,070
You have insulted the Hindu law code

2045
02:21:11,143 --> 02:21:13,407
There is a law that transcends it

2046
02:21:14,046 --> 02:21:15,343
Divine justice!

2047
02:21:16,081 --> 02:21:18,572
There is a court that
supersedes this one!

2048
02:21:19,017 --> 02:21:20,882
You are rejecting it!

2049
02:21:21,854 --> 02:21:24,721
We cannot neglect your crime

2050
02:21:25,457 --> 02:21:28,290
This religious court ordains

2051
02:21:28,761 --> 02:21:31,286
...that you cannot write verse anymore

2052
02:21:32,598 --> 02:21:34,725
All your existing
notebLooks of poetry...

2053
02:21:35,067 --> 02:21:36,466
...will have to be immersed

2054
02:21:36,869 --> 02:21:39,804
If not, all your moveable and
immoveable assIts will be confiscated

2055
02:21:40,172 --> 02:21:41,901
You will be evicted...

2056
02:21:41,974 --> 02:21:43,908
And expelled from the community!

2057
02:21:45,411 --> 02:21:46,537
He will learn a lesson now.

2058
02:22:47,573 --> 02:22:48,665
Wait... wait

2059
02:23:07,693 --> 02:23:09,024
What are you doing?

2060
02:23:10,662 --> 02:23:13,324
What are you doing?

2061
02:23:19,571 --> 02:23:20,833
You immersed your
Gaatha (BLook of Abhangs)

2062
02:23:23,609 --> 02:23:24,906
Why?

2063
02:23:25,777 --> 02:23:27,404
Why?

2064
02:23:28,714 --> 02:23:30,614
Why should all of you
be expelled due to me?

2065
02:23:31,884 --> 02:23:33,408
Why should the children suffer?

2066
02:23:35,687 --> 02:23:39,384
And who knows? Perhaps my
Gaatha has done what it could!

2067
02:23:40,459 --> 02:23:42,654
But you didn't feel like asking me?

2068
02:23:44,796 --> 02:23:47,264
You fought with me for these verses

2069
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,360
I spent sleepless nights;
I waited for you to come home

2070
02:23:52,471 --> 02:23:55,770
You made us insolvent;
You let the kids go hungry

2071
02:23:55,841 --> 02:24:00,540
And now you calmly immerse
them and say their work is over?

2072
02:24:03,749 --> 02:24:07,549
Even when I quareled, I continued
to take care of these Abhangs

2073
02:24:08,787 --> 02:24:12,348
When it rained, even
before I covered the kids...

2074
02:24:12,424 --> 02:24:15,018
...I made sure that their
pages wouldn't get wIt...

2075
02:24:50,762 --> 02:24:53,959
As per the orders of the religious
seat Tukaram did immerse his hymns.

2076
02:24:54,967 --> 02:24:59,301
But as he had lost everything he
sat at the banks of river Indrayani...

2077
02:24:59,371 --> 02:25:02,704
...for 13 days
without eating or drinking.

2078
02:26:00,932 --> 02:26:03,332
Gradually everyone
came to know about it.

2079
02:26:04,369 --> 02:26:07,600
And all the people
started going to Dehu.

2080
02:26:08,106 --> 02:26:14,841
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2081
02:26:14,913 --> 02:26:21,477
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2082
02:26:21,553 --> 02:26:28,652
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2083
02:26:41,039 --> 02:26:44,475
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2084
02:26:44,543 --> 02:26:47,706
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2085
02:26:47,779 --> 02:26:51,010
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2086
02:26:51,083 --> 02:26:54,075
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2087
02:26:54,386 --> 02:27:00,916
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2088
02:27:08,366 --> 02:27:11,426
Words are the riches in our homes

2089
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:15,406
Words are the riches in our houses

2090
02:27:15,474 --> 02:27:17,908
Our aim is to preserve that knowledge

2091
02:27:18,477 --> 02:27:21,446
Words are the
instruments of our daily lives

2092
02:27:21,513 --> 02:27:23,845
We will also distribute them to others

2093
02:27:24,449 --> 02:27:27,646
Tuka says "The Word is God"

2094
02:27:27,719 --> 02:27:29,846
"We should honour and worship it"

2095
02:27:29,921 --> 02:27:31,752
The person who treats everyone...

2096
02:27:31,823 --> 02:27:33,518
...tomented or downtrodden,
as his own

2097
02:27:33,825 --> 02:27:35,656
He is a true saint

2098
02:27:35,727 --> 02:27:37,092
One can perceive
that God resides in him

2099
02:27:37,162 --> 02:27:38,925
Oh God, give me childhood

2100
02:27:38,997 --> 02:27:40,658
Because the ant is
tiny and gets to eat suga

2101
02:27:40,732 --> 02:27:42,927
The elephant,
though it is great, gets no sugar

2102
02:27:43,001 --> 02:27:45,060
It is pricked with the sharp goad

2103
02:27:45,137 --> 02:27:47,469
This proves that those who are great

2104
02:27:47,539 --> 02:27:49,404
Have to bear the most agony

2105
02:27:49,474 --> 02:27:51,442
Those who are paid to lament

2106
02:27:51,743 --> 02:27:53,870
Have neither tears nor affection

2107
02:27:54,412 --> 02:27:56,505
What is the use of such devotion

2108
02:27:56,581 --> 02:27:58,549
That is put on just for show?

2109
02:27:58,617 --> 02:28:01,051
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

2110
02:28:01,119 --> 02:28:03,679
Chant orrd vitthal's
name an d see him always

2111
02:28:03,755 --> 02:28:05,780
Make him your beloved

2112
02:28:05,857 --> 02:28:08,587
This longing makes your mind greedy

2113
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:10,525
It refuses to rIturn
to worldly matters

2114
02:28:10,829 --> 02:28:13,559
Chant orrd vitthal's
name an d see him always

2115
02:28:13,632 --> 02:28:15,964
Chant Lord vitthal's
name an d see him always

2116
02:28:16,034 --> 02:28:18,594
Chant Lord vitthal's
name an d see him always

2117
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:25,075
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2118
02:28:25,143 --> 02:28:30,103
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2119
02:28:30,415 --> 02:28:33,816
The foundation of life

2120
02:28:34,853 --> 02:28:39,756
The strength to live

2121
02:28:39,825 --> 02:28:42,123
The foundation of life

2122
02:28:42,394 --> 02:28:44,555
The strength to live

2123
02:28:44,629 --> 02:28:47,359
The key to thought

2124
02:28:47,432 --> 02:28:51,801
Tukaram!

2125
02:28:51,870 --> 02:28:53,861
The foundation of life

2126
02:28:53,939 --> 02:28:56,499
The strength to live

2127
02:28:56,575 --> 02:28:58,770
The foundation of life

2128
02:29:08,153 --> 02:29:10,621
Honesty of words

2129
02:29:10,689 --> 02:29:12,987
A garden of knowledge

2130
02:29:13,058 --> 02:29:15,583
Honesty of words

2131
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:17,753
A garden of knowledge

2132
02:29:17,829 --> 02:29:20,525
The page of devotional verse

2133
02:29:20,599 --> 02:29:25,059
Tukaram!

2134
02:29:25,136 --> 02:29:27,070
The foundation of life

2135
02:29:27,505 --> 02:29:29,700
The strength to live

2136
02:29:29,774 --> 02:29:31,901
The foundation of life

2137
02:29:41,453 --> 02:29:43,944
He rises again

2138
02:29:44,022 --> 02:29:46,047
He spreads deep within us

2139
02:29:46,124 --> 02:29:48,786
He rises again

2140
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:50,987
He spreads deep within us

2141
02:29:51,062 --> 02:29:53,690
There is always more to him

2142
02:29:53,765 --> 02:29:55,926
TUKARAM!

2143
02:29:56,001 --> 02:29:58,469
There is always more to him

2144
02:29:58,536 --> 02:30:00,504
TUKARAM!

2145
02:30:00,572 --> 02:30:04,975
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2146
02:30:05,043 --> 02:30:09,639
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2147
02:30:09,714 --> 02:30:14,014
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2148
02:30:14,085 --> 02:30:18,385
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2149
02:30:18,456 --> 02:30:22,051
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2150
02:30:22,127 --> 02:30:26,029
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2151
02:30:26,097 --> 02:30:29,760
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2152
02:30:29,834 --> 02:30:34,862
Oh Lord Vitthal...!
Oh Lord Vitthal...!

2153
02:30:35,941 --> 02:30:39,308
How can these words,
carved in each heart, be erased?

2154
02:30:40,512 --> 02:30:42,776
These verses may have been immersed

2155
02:30:42,847 --> 02:30:45,543
But today, in an extraordinary
way they have become immortal

2156
02:30:46,518 --> 02:30:48,008
This Gaatha
transcends the boundaries...

2157
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,049
...of state, country, time and language

2158
02:30:50,121 --> 02:30:53,249
And has been overflowing with
wisdom for the last 400 years

2159
02:30:53,825 --> 02:30:57,261
It lights the flame of truth in
the hearts of millions of pilgrims

2160
02:30:57,529 --> 02:30:58,791
It explains the
essence of life through...

2161
02:30:58,863 --> 02:31:00,524
...common sayings in spoken language

2162
02:31:01,099 --> 02:31:04,034
That is why Saint
Tukaram's Gaatha continues to float

2163
02:31:06,604 --> 02:31:11,507
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

2164
02:31:11,576 --> 02:31:16,070
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

2165
02:31:16,147 --> 02:31:20,641
Lord Vitthal... his wife,
Mother Rakhumai

2166
02:31:21,052 --> 02:31:23,043
I will be a mendicant;

2167
02:31:23,121 --> 02:31:26,090
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2168
02:31:27,659 --> 02:31:29,991
I will be a mendicant;

2169
02:31:30,061 --> 02:31:32,757
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2170
02:31:34,666 --> 02:31:37,032
To take Vithoba's name...

2171
02:31:37,102 --> 02:31:39,536
...is my practice and my religion

2172
02:31:39,604 --> 02:31:41,697
I will be a mendicant;

2173
02:31:41,773 --> 02:31:44,435
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2174
02:31:48,747 --> 02:31:53,684
I will pay homage to all the saints

2175
02:31:55,387 --> 02:32:00,051
I will pay homage to all the saints

2176
02:32:00,125 --> 02:32:04,824
Tuka says "Oh God,
this is my artless service for you"

2177
02:32:04,896 --> 02:32:06,955
I will be a mendicant;

2178
02:32:07,032 --> 02:32:09,023
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2179
02:32:09,334 --> 02:32:11,632
I will be a mendicant;

2180
02:32:11,703 --> 02:32:13,864
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2181
02:32:13,938 --> 02:32:16,065
I will be a mendicant;

2182
02:32:16,141 --> 02:32:18,666
A pilgrim to
Pandharpur (Vithoba's abode)

2183
02:32:23,081 --> 02:32:25,675
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2184
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:28,378
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2185
02:32:28,453 --> 02:32:30,921
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2186
02:32:30,989 --> 02:32:33,583
"Glory to Lord Rama and Krishna"

2187
02:32:44,803 --> 02:32:49,740
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

2188
02:32:49,808 --> 02:32:54,939
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

2189
02:32:55,013 --> 02:33:03,011
Discrimination is an unholy illusion

2190
02:33:03,321 --> 02:33:08,384
Listen all you devotees

2191
02:33:08,460 --> 02:33:13,625
Listen all you devotees

2192
02:33:13,698 --> 02:33:21,537
Carry out the good that you want to

2193
02:33:21,606 --> 02:33:26,805
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

2194
02:33:26,878 --> 02:33:32,077
Devotees of Lord Vishnu
see the world full of him

2195
02:33:35,553 --> 02:33:40,581
Is there a place

2196
02:33:40,658 --> 02:33:45,322
Is there a place

2197
02:33:45,396 --> 02:33:49,628
Where there is instant loss of ego?

2198
02:33:49,701 --> 02:33:54,638
Where there is instant loss of ego?

2199
02:33:54,706 --> 02:33:59,370
It happens in Vitthal's Pandharpur

2200
02:33:59,444 --> 02:34:04,040
It happens in Vitthal's Pandharpur

2201
02:34:04,115 --> 02:34:08,575
One is totally spellbound

2202
02:34:08,653 --> 02:34:13,420
One is totally spellbound

2203
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:18,554
One is totally spellbound

2204
02:34:18,897 --> 02:34:23,698
Tuka says "Have you seen such harmony

2205
02:34:23,768 --> 02:34:28,034
Tuka says "Have you seen such harmony

2206
02:34:28,106 --> 02:34:33,066
of worship anywhere else?"

2207
02:34:33,144 --> 02:34:37,547
Of worship anywhere else?"

2208
02:34:37,615 --> 02:34:42,279
No other holy place is
a match for Pandharpur

2209
02:34:42,353 --> 02:34:46,790
No other holy place is
a match for Pandharpur

2210
02:34:46,858 --> 02:34:51,557
Nobody here has any ego

2211
02:34:51,629 --> 02:34:56,293
Nobody here has any ego

2212
02:34:56,601 --> 02:35:01,334
They all touch each other's feIt

2213
02:35:01,406 --> 02:35:05,934
They all touch each other's feIt

2214
02:35:06,010 --> 02:35:09,741
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

2215
02:35:09,814 --> 02:35:13,477
Oh Lord Pandurang...!

2216
02:35:13,551 --> 02:35:16,918
