00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:32,277
What a game!

2
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:45,664
Hello, Bantu, where are you?

3
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,100
I am there...almost there.
- I've been waiting for over an hour.

4
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,638
Almost there...Adi bro...
- Late like always.

00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:53,333
Come quickie... - Just
5 more minutes...l am there...

00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,637
Go away! Get out!
- Please just listen to me.

7
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,510
No! Get out! - Listen...

8
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,606
No...just go!
Don't show me your face again!

9
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:07,348
I will jump... get out! - Look, Tara...

10
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:08,616
Get out! No!

11
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,151
Okay, I am going! I am going!

12
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:11,589
Get out or I will jump. - Relax!

13
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,194
I am going. - I will jump!

14
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:14,695
I wasn't spying on you.

15
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,394
Go. - I am going.

16
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,464
I don't care. Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

17
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,682
Hey dumb***' get back.

18
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,609
Can't you see the train? Get back!

19
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:07,479
Call him, Bantu...where is he?
- It's not reachable.

20
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:09,980
Adi! - Bro...

21
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,383
Bro, where were you?
- Love you, buddy.

22
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:15,445
Where were you? - Bantu, I saw
a dream on the train...and got inspired.

23
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:18,589
When I got off,
I saw reality...which made me perspire.

24
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:19,717
What are you talking?

25
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,593
Let's go now, bro... or
Jenny here might expire.

26
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,358
Why will Jenny expire?

27
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,261
She's getting married. - Huh?

28
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,065
Yeah... Come, I'll tell you. - Marriage?

29
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,293
Yeah, marriage.

30
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,461
Actually you should
get married, Jenny...

31
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:32,597
...it's already too late for you.
- Shut up!

32
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,539
Right, Bantu? - Adi Bro...

33
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,202
We need to stay away from marriage
permanently. - No chance, bro.

34
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,677
Like me...simple, good looking and lean.

35
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:43,581
And me...cheap...smart and single.

36
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:47,453
Forever...and ever and ever and ever...

37
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:56,521
Stop it, guys.

38
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,695
We're are...at 'Teen Bhavan'.
- But it's just one.

39
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,334
Adi, you're single as well.

40
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,304
Jenny, get the luggage
and escort the guest.

41
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:07,137
I am getting married,
you get the luggage.

42
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,077
Hello Charu aunty, what's up?

43
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,450
Aunty, it's me...Bantu.

44
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,982
Remember I took you to Maratha
Mandir (Movie Hall) last week.

45
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:20,382
For DDLJ.

46
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,285
Hello, aunty.

47
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:27,161
Hi, aunty. - Who are you?

48
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,119
Adi.

49
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,695
I am Ravi Gunjal's younger brother...

50
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,597
...who was Gopi uncle's junior. Adi!

51
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:41,097
Uncle.

52
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,403
Hi, Uncle.

53
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:48,749
Adi.

54
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,187
What's this? - My hand!

55
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,379
Sorry.

56
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,289
Was the train late? - No.

57
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,721
Then? - Nothing...

58
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,993
This Nothing' won't be
tolerated around here.

59
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:09,492
Yes.

60
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,665
You have to be punctual,
this is a not a hotel.

61
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,435
It's a house, and you're a guest.

62
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,407
Just like all of us... - Yes, I know!

63
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,237
Brother told me everything.

64
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:23,112
Told you what?
- That Judge sir is a strict man.

65
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,719
He calls you Judge sir.
- Good.

66
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,218
And no late nights...

67
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,322
And definitely no
screaming and shouting!

68
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,122
Except for... - Except for?

69
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:36,994
When my wife's singing. - Of course...

70
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,395
Charulata Devi.

71
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:41,197
The Great Indian Classical Artist.

72
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,497
Sorry...Singer.

73
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:45,334
Hello...you can't play
cheesy Bollywood numbers here.

74
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:46,696
You don't know about uncle.

75
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,139
He's a butcher!

76
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,209
Sorry uncle... Judge sir... Sorry!

77
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:52,708
Wrong adjective...

78
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:57,182
Death penalty hasn't
been abolished in India yet.

79
00:09:57,251 --> 00:10:01,188
I can't decide whether to
throw you two out...or strangle you.

80
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,184
How about you don't do either, uncle?

81
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,619
Please pardon us as per section 102.

82
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:08,719
Thank you, sir.MAZE HDRelease

83
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,294
Sir, please forgive this girl as well.

84
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,529
She's getting married. - Why?

85
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,605
Didn't papa tell you, uncle?

86
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,597
Actually, it's a good
thing to get married early.

87
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,610
You can grow old together. - Yeah.

88
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,305
This is your room. - Okay.

89
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,471
Thank you, sir. - Thank you, uncle.

90
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:45,521
Whoa!

91
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,599
Bro, you've no idea
what a grouch the boss is.

92
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,659
I think we should run. - Okay.

93
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:54,269
Hey...you fools...come here.

94
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,671
Boys...the LA guys rejected
all your gaming programs.

95
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:04,178
I don't have much
knowledge about games.

96
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:06,083
I am an advertising guy.

97
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:08,622
Dude...sell it. - What?

98
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,490
The dream you had...sell it.
- Are you mad?

99
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,653
Buddy, first impression
is the last impression.

100
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,025
Sell it...come on...

101
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,292
...l will make things
hell for all you, promise.

102
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,261
Sir, we do have an idea. Come on.

103
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,367
Who is this? - Hi, sir.

104
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:27,334
I am Adi... First day,
first show...first idea.

105
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:32,710
It better be a good idea,
otherwise it will be your last idea.

106
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:34,473
Thank you, sir.

107
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:35,708
Okay. . -

108
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,578
So this game is a thriller,
and it's called 'Mumbai 2.0'.

109
00:11:40,654 --> 00:11:42,816
Wow. . what a title.

110
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,319
What a title.

111
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,383
There's a Boss...sitting
inside Mumbai's local...

112
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,293
The main villain of our game.

113
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,827
This Boss has two heads.

114
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,463
One head is from streets of Mumbai,
like a local gangster.

115
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:58,264
And the other...classy
and dangerous...

116
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,068
...chugging smoke from his cigar!

117
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:05,045
The Boss has a remote...and
the 'Heroine' in captivity.

118
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:06,580
Bravo...go on...

119
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:07,512
Yes, sir...okay.

120
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,606
In comes our 'Hero'.

121
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,677
Simple looking but deadly fighting.

122
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,254
The 'Herd must use
sonic-jumps and parkour...

123
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:16,516
...through buildings and slums...

124
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,687
and clear different levels of bomb-blasts,
car-chase, bike rides, train rides...

125
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:26,393
...and get to the main Villain...
finish him...get the remote.

126
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,595
And save the 'Heroine'.

127
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,229
That's Mumbai 2.0.

128
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:32,705
Wow...amazing.

129
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,599
Great...

130
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,606
What an idea?

131
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:37,676
How soon can you give it?

132
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:42,710
Sir...the 3D trailer will
take at least 4 months.

133
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,312
4 months?

134
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,543
Take 5...

135
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,385
Thank you, sir.

136
00:12:58,332 --> 00:12:59,265
Jenny

137
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,564
Jenny! - I am really scared.

138
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:03,731
You can be scared all you want...

139
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,165
...later, it will be
his turn to be scared.

140
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:36,503
Dearly beloved, we've come
together in presence of God...

141
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:44,111
...to witness and bless the joining of
Henry and Jenifer in holy matrimony.

142
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:49,540
The union of husband
and wife is intended by God.

143
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:56,455
For the mutual joy, for the health
and comfort given to each other...

144
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,082
...in prosperity and adversity.

145
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:03,455
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

146
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,256
She gives herself, father.

147
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,232
Of course,
with blessings of mother and father.

148
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:13,166
In the name of God,
do you Jenifer Rodriguez...

149
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:14,274
Name?

150
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:19,213
Tara.

151
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,573
Adi!

152
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,289
...until death do you apart?

153
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,196
Yes, I do.

154
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:18,094
...as your lawfully wedded wife,
until death do you apart?

155
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,029
I do.

156
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:35,451
Hey... - Hey.

157
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,053
What did you call me
at the station that day?

158
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,292
Was it darling?

159
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,261
No, what you called
me in a fit of rage.

160
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:53,733
Mo... - Madam... I called you madam.

161
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:58,234
There's no 'f' in madam.

162
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,015
It's hard to realize what
you're saying in a fit of rage.

163
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,744
I see...

164
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:12,285
Are you from Jenny's side?
- Hmmm...college friend.

165
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,225
She's looking gorgeous...
and happy too.

166
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:20,029
Everything feels
nice in the beginning.

167
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,432
Love-filled days.

168
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:30,705
Marriage... Honeymoon.

169
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,545
Hugs. . . kisses.

170
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:39,253
Love... - Lust!

171
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,014
Now please exchange the rings,
as the symbol of your love.

172
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:47,517
And then... - Then?

173
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,621
Petty quarrels. - Hmmmm...

174
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,757
Embarrassing your wife
in front of your friends.

175
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,294
And facing the music at home.

176
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,102
And then, the kids.

177
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,030
Oh God!

178
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:02,966
Cry-babies.

179
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:06,673
Pukes...

180
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:09,082
Shit...

181
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:17,656
Then?

182
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,689
And then...their admission.

183
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:27,429
Turning that dumbm' into a smart“

184
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:30,465
And when that smart***“ grows up...

185
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:32,764
...watch him get married.

186
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:38,111
And go through that same
old mess all over again.

187
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,707
Correct. - Correct.

188
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:43,742
Now, you may kiss the bride.

189
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,015
Hey... - Hey...

190
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:55,495
You seem to know a
lot about this department.

191
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:56,790
Are you married?

192
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,760
No. And I never want to.

193
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,295
Good! Marriage is for fools.
- Correct!

194
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,264
So just girlfriends, huh?

195
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:11,609
Around 15... - Not bad.

196
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,470
And you...

197
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,346
I am going to Paris. - Why?

198
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:18,584
To study architecture.

199
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,484
Cool. - Thank you.

200
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:21,419
And you.

201
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:23,223
lam going to the US...

202
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:25,488
...to give Zuckerburg
a run for his money.

203
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,618
Not bad. - Yeah.

204
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,194
All the best. - Same to you.

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,991
Come on...come on... - Come on.

206
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:36,567
Hey Bantu...come on.

207
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,006
Good morning.

208
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,004
Good morning.
- Morning.

209
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:46,536
What are you doing here?

210
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,512
It's Peru.

211
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,276
It's an easy one.

212
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,353
You come late at night...
and always in a hurry in the morning.

213
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,461
It was Jenny's wedding party.

214
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,324
Poor thing got hitched.

215
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,593
No partying today, uncle.
I'll come home early today.

216
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:11,635
What time?
- By 5 'clock.

217
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:14,438
Put it back...put it...

218
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,542
Actually by 5:30.

219
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,210
Uncle, I'll...be back by 6.
- Yeah.

220
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,278
Be back by 6, right.

221
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:24,547
You've to take Charu
to Ravindra Natya Mandir.

222
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:26,279
For a classical music program.

223
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:28,750
Me?

224
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,620
Your brother wouldn't
have asked twice.

225
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:38,758
I've to head to the BSES office...
regarding the electricity bill.

226
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,063
They send such absurd bills.

227
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:46,004
Grease their palms...
and they will never call again.

228
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:51,404
Do what? - Grease their palms...
fill their pockets.

229
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:55,312
I see...how about a pour a can
of oil on their hands...their pockets?

230
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:01,285
Your generation cannot
do without corruption.

231
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,322
I can still handout sentences.

232
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:07,324
I will throw you out along with
your luggage if you say that again.

233
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:11,026
Okay uncle, sorry.

234
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:13,462
Here you are, baby.

235
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,435
Bye.

236
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:18,300
Bye, aunty.

237
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,571
Here you go, and... you've
almost finished the crossword.

238
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:24,508
Wow...
- Isn't that amazing.

239
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:25,406
Come, madam.

240
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:28,312
Hello. Hello.

241
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,045

Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,785
Hello.

246
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:44,129
Aunty, you sit and I'll be...
- No-no...sit.

247
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:45,531
Hello. Hello.

248
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,397
Can you go to that side?
There's another seat.

249
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:49,299
Thank you.

250
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:02,182
Hello. Hello.

251
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,481
You're a big star, aunty.
- Of course.

252
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:50,054
You sing so well...
why don't you do a stage show?

253
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:53,789
You're unmusical and unmelodious.

254
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:55,526
Uncultured fellow.

255
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:56,327
Get out.

256
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:57,697
Get down.
- What happened?

257
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,432
I said get down.
- What happened?

258
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:00,696
Get out! Get down!

259
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,341
Get down from the bus!
- The bus...

260
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:08,308
You were sleeping through the program.

261
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:12,582
Oh, God!

262
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:24,028
Hello, baby.

263
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:25,290
You're back.
- Yeah.

264
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,230
How...

265
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:43,217
So...how was your program?
- Amazing!

266
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,780
Where are your feet, sir?
- Where they should be.

267
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:47,448
There's food inside.
Go and eat.

268
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:49,188
Hats off.

269
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:55,321
Roll up my sleeves...please.

270
00:22:58,498 --> 00:22:59,624
This one too.

271
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:02,295
Keep these there.

272
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:09,007
Gopi, should I heat-up the food?

273
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,183
We already ate, baby.

274
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:21,482
Look, I even wiped
my hands with your dress.

275
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:26,655
Fine, clean this wok properly.

276
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,695
Alzheimer's, 2nd stage.

277
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:44,805
She's forgotten a great deal.

278
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,479
But she still remembers some things.

279
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,183
Brother Ravi did tell me about it.

280
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,644
How do you handle all this, uncle?

281
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:05,521
Well...if she calls me
Paplu even once in a day...

282
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:09,463
...it fills me up with
the energy for a lifetime.

283
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,502
Paplu...

284
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:19,546
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

285
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:23,348
Come-come-come...
let's take you to the bedroom...

286
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,577
...and sing you a lullaby.

287
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,218
Which one is it?
Your favorite lullaby?

288
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:34,783
Have you open Bank account.

289
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,586
Yes, brother...l did get one.
- Where?

290
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:37,594
At the Parel Branch.

291
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,624
Did Bantu give you the bike?

292
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:44,363
Madam's geyser isn't working,
I came for some hot water.

293
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,233
Yeah...Bantu gave me the bike.

294
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:50,273
He gave me the bike, the keys,
papers, insurance...everything.

295
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:53,643
I mean...whatever...
wear your helmet while riding.

296
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:55,511
Talk to your sister-in-law.

297
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:57,441
Hurry up, it's a long-distance call.

298
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:58,746
Hello.
- Quickly.

299
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:01,378

I thought its no. 10.

00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,572
I was just testing your number.

308
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,168
Otherwise no decent girl
calls up a guy at this hour.

309
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:02,276
We'll know your decency when we meet.

310
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,077
Whose wedding will we meet next?

311
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:07,309
Jenny's been shipped to America.

312
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:10,285
Ohh...so you're missing me.

313
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:14,459

Say yes. . say yes-yes.

Maybe.

323
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,289
Good.
- Maybe not.

324
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:56,166
Okay.

Of course, sir.
He's the no. 1.

00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,238
I see...

339
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,653
But in the interview
you said that I am no. 1.

340
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,552
You're beyond that...

341
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:53,757
You're above the list.

342
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,157

I've picked up my bag from the desk.

358
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:44,138
My keys-my keys-I've found my keys.

359
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,646
I have my phone.

360
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,636
My boss is looking at me...

361
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,683
He thinks I'm going
out for something urgent.

362
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,549
I just gave him a fake smile...
and faced Asha.

363
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,486
Avoided her by giving
her a cold shoulder.

364
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:58,490
And after dodging
two guys carrying coffee...

365
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:00,217
My card...my card...

366
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,159
And...open sesame...

367
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:04,219
I am outside my office.

368
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,265
And I am coming outside
my office walking fast...

369
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:07,561
And you're right in front of me.

370
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:11,569
You?
- Alak Niranjan lady...

371
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,472
Wow...from desk to door,
somewhere you lost the formalities.

372
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,538
You're a funny man.

373
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,608
So come let's have fun.

374
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:27,984
What happened?

375
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:32,688
Okay.

376
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:34,286
1-2-3...

377
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:37,324
Come on.

378
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:38,296
1-2...

379
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:54,369
So...all time favorite video game.

380
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:57,242
All time favorite...
No chance.

381
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,778
Definitely not...
- Something...

382
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:03,388
You tell me...
- My favorite is...Mortal Kombat.

383
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:04,650
I love it.

384
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,190
Tara.

385
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:09,252
Who is that guy?

386
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:15,397
Isn't that the guy from the train?
- Come on.

387
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:19,194
At least tell me what
happened between you two.

388
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:21,070
The same thing that didn't happen.

389
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,332
Marriage.

390
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,510
Marriage? You?

391
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:26,043
Never.

392
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,773
He was chasing after me for marriage.

393
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:32,180
And you?
- Me... I was trying to get rid of him.

394
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:34,181
By jumping in front of the train?

395
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:37,318
I was just pretending.

396
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:39,687
To get him out of my life for good.

397
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,589
And that's where I came in.

398
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:00,608
What?

399
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,740
Tara?

400
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,107
Sorry.

401
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,120
Listen to me. Please.

402
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:05,558
So...
- So what?

403
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,430
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

404
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,765
Where?
- Ahmedabad. Kutch Express.

405
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:17,070
Hey...when are you coming back?

406
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,142
Don't know.

407
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,346
What are you doing, Paplu?

408
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:31,081
Tickling you, baby.

409
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:36,252
Uncle, did you two
always talk like this?

410
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,262
Paplu...baby?

411
00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:39,058
Oh...let it go...

412
00:34:39,465 --> 00:34:41,524
Stupidity of young age...

413
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:44,360
Tell me, uncle...how did you meet aunty?

414
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:49,806
Well, you see...

415
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,601
I was in my final year of LAW...

416
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,410
...and she was 20 years old.

417
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,017
And I had a taste for classical
music...from the beginning.

418
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,113
But not enough knowledge.
- Like always.

419
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:05,348
Yes, always...

420
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:09,290
And her voice... oh, God.

421
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:12,327
And her beauty...
- Like always...

422
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:15,026
Yes, always...she was
always so beautiful.

423
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:17,335
It so happened that
I had a doctor friend...

424
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:18,734
...and he would tag along as well.

425
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:21,334
The doctor was crazy about Charu.

426
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:27,207
And one day...he sent a
letter to Charu through me.

427
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,205
Love letter.

428
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,512
And I gave it to her.

429
00:35:34,387 --> 00:35:37,288
She read the letter and smiled.

430
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:42,722
And when the doctor heard
about this, he grew bolder.

431
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:45,358
He started writing
to her more frequently.

432
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,462
But I never read the envelope.
- I see...

433
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:54,038
I didn't know that he never wrote
his name at the end of the letter.

434
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,042
So tell me...what would I understand?

435
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:01,045
You thought the letter was from him.
- Of course.

436
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:04,273
And he was also so
good-looking and shy.

437
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,081
Bonjour!!

438
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:07,644
That's it...

439
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,417
One fine day,
I made him get in my car...

440
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:12,423
...and took him to see my father.

441
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:15,520
And uncle, did her father know
you didn't write those letters?

442
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,527
No, not at all.

443
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:18,154
The doctor had already
made one mistake...

444
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,493
...l didn't want to make another one.

445
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,431
And the doctor, didn't he ask?

446
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:28,269
That poor love-stricken
guy... what could he ask?

447
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,134
He was a doctor himself.

448
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:38,645
Never miss the train even
if you don't have the ticket.

449
00:37:08,314 --> 00:37:10,248
It's not like you think. Ask her.

450
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:16,411
All lies...

451
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,146
Why would I lie?

452
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,459
What are you doing?

453
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,532
Isn't this train heading to Ahmadabad?

454
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:32,400
I am going to Ahmadabad too.

455
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:34,006
It's been really long
since I last went there.

456
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:37,477
Be serious.
- What? Sight-seeing.

457
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:41,543
I should've known.

458
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:45,181
Do you do this often?
- What? Sightseeing?

459
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:50,645
No...chasing girls.
- Oh... Since childhood.

460
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,653
How many have you chased till now?

461
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:56,487
I've lost count.

462
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,596
But you said 15.

463
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:09,174
I think there's none.
- I see...

464
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:11,501
Show me your ticket.

465
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:14,273
I would've missed my train
if I had waited to buy a ticket. .

466
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:17,474
What if you get caught?

467
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,312
So be it.

468
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:23,614
Come inside.

469
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:26,548
Stay here.

470
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:30,653
Everyone else is inside.
- So?

471
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,325
They will come looking for me.

472
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:34,626
Let them.

473
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:43,232
Okay. . . let them.

474
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:21,172
You know architecture
is a challenging job.

475
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:25,446
It's not just a miracle,
but it's a challenge.

476
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:28,382
And I had to do it for Husain.

477
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,552
What was the old man saying?

478
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:38,720
He was saying architecture
is a mission, a commitment...

479
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:42,298
...don't get influenced by some
video-gamer and forget your mission.

480
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,567
That's a big thing to say.

481
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:48,400
But even the heart has a mission.

482
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:51,136
One should always
keep the heart in check.

483
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:52,435
Hey...

484
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:09,761
Hey...

485
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,124
What are you drawing?
ls it a sketch of me?

486
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:14,366
I am making a well.

487
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:17,425
Why?
- So you can drown in it.

488
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:20,706
Ohh...but your eyes
are perfect for that.

489
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:24,803
We didn't need such a deep well.

490
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:31,280
True architecture is magical.
It's like magic.

491
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:36,618
It creates fiction...it
creates unexpected spaces.

492
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:41,585
And it...helps to create
unexpected dialogue.

493
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:47,461
It is a generator of passion,
love, romance...

494
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:19,426
My papa would often come here.
- I see...

495
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:21,289
Does he still come here?

496
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,195
Don't know.
- If he does, don't get me beaten up.

497
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,799
He wouldn't recognize me either.

498
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:35,145
Why?

499
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:40,475
It's been many years
since he separated from us.

500
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,820
Daily quarrels...

501
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,259
...and then custody battle.

502
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,659
I was only 7 when the court asked
me who I would like to live with.

503
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:06,507
I didn't want to live with anyone.

504
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:15,044
Then papa left me for good.

505
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:29,296
That's when I decided
I will never get married.

506
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:55,249
Isn't it time to get to the station?
<i>_</i> s,“

507
00:42:55,394 --> 00:42:56,623
Come on-come nan-let's go.

508
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:04,696
S***

509
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:07,569
What now?

510
00:43:14,413 --> 00:43:15,539
Let's get a room.

511
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:21,482
The two of us?
- Of course.

512
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:26,720
We won't actually
become a married couple...

513
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:28,453
...if we write so in the register.

514
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:32,024
Whatevs to that!

515
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:35,660
I still won't sign as Mrs. Adi Gunjal.

516
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:38,764
Fine, I'll sign as Mr. and Mrs. Tara...

517
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:40,638
What is it?

518
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,674
Agnihotri.

519
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,734
Agnihotri.

520
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:47,306
Whatevs to that?

521
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,448
Bro...another piece of bread for me.

522
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,251
Mr. and Mrs. Tara Agnihotri.

523
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:04,519
Honeymoon!
- Yeah.

524
00:44:27,052 --> 00:44:29,350
"How are you... all good,
sister-in-law."

525
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:31,045
"Tell us your name."

526
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:34,320
"Hello, my name is Sheetal.
And I am definitely not sister-in-law."

527
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:35,791
There's just one bed.

528
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:37,791
It's big enough for the two of us.

529
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:41,663
One blanket too.

530
00:44:43,502 --> 00:44:44,560
We can easily fit in it.

531
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:46,536
"My problem is a bit private."

532
00:44:46,738 --> 00:44:48,672
"Okay, I hope you don't have
a problem discussing it publicly."

533
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:50,366
"I don't have a problem.
- Okay."

534
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,170
"I actually I live in a joint family,
I've been married for three years now."

535
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:55,270
Hey...

536
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:01,312
There's just one
bucket and one mug.

537
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:07,557
"He's always busy either with
the office work...or the family..."

538
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:09,458
Will you behave like a good boy?

539
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:11,253
Will you behave like a good girl?

540
00:45:12,464 --> 00:45:13,329
Maybe.

541
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:16,359
"This effort from my side."

542
00:45:16,635 --> 00:45:18,034
"M ay be not."

543
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:25,339
"I want some kind of naughtiness
back in our relationship."

544
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,605
"Some kind of spice..."

545
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:30,441
"Naughtiness...l've a superb
track for you actually..."

546
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:34,281
"...that will tickle to
you and your husband also."

547
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:40,192
"So this song from Badshah,
dedicated to one and only AR Rehman."

548
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,384
"Here's the new track."

549
00:48:43,308 --> 00:48:45,436
"So how are you...how's you...how're
you...hope you're having fun."

550
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,741
"Who is with me next, sister-in-law."

551
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:50,748
We're here.

552
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:52,078
Let's go.

553
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,118
Wait for me, dude
- Okay.

554
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:12,394
Say that this was your best holiday.

555
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:16,337
This was my best holiday. Am I right?

556
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,644
Liar. You don't mean that.

557
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:21,111
Be honest.

558
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:23,171
Honestly?

559
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:26,144
No-no-no. . .don't say it.

560
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:28,352
Okay darling.

561
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:33,582
Am I your darling?
- Yes, darling.

562
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:43,029
Can I go?

563
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:48,572
Say it...Okay darling, go.

564
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:51,366
Not okay darling, don't go.

565
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:53,133
Don't go.

566
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,496
Grandpa!

567
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:21,733
My darling...
- Grandpa.

568
00:50:24,276 --> 00:50:27,211
Don't cancel...yes...
- How are you? - Fit and fine.

569
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:30,071
Tara.
- I'll just call you back. Yeah.

570
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,244
Shall I? Okay...

571
00:50:33,084 --> 00:50:36,315
Your favorite pickle...
with extra oil.

572
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:39,780
Let me say hi to mom.

573
00:50:41,293 --> 00:50:43,261
Hi, dear.
- Hi, mom.

574
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:46,123
Let's go inside and talk.

575
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:54,132
Tara, this is for you.

576
00:50:57,809 --> 00:50:58,674
Thanks, mom.

577
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:06,517
Where were you?

578
00:51:07,485 --> 00:51:10,318
I went to Ahmadabad...with
my office colleagues.

579
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:11,454
When did you arrive?

580
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,081
But your office colleagues
returned yesterday.

581
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:16,755
And you...where were you?

582
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,321
I just told you, Ahmadabad.

583
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:24,258
With whom?

584
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:26,331
And what were you doing?

585
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,502
Why do you always
ask so many questions?

586
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,038
Because you're my only
daughter...and I worry for you.

587
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:41,150
If I wasn't your only daughter...

588
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:42,550
...would you have worried
any less for me?

589
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:45,115
Stop this nonsense, Tara.

590
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:49,820
None of your office colleagues
knew where you were.

591
00:51:50,428 --> 00:51:51,293
And with whom?

592
00:51:53,465 --> 00:51:55,661
I went to Sabarmati...with a friend.

593
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:57,797
And missed my train.

594
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:02,172
Why did you go?

595
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:12,509
To meet Bapu...

596
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:15,380
I used to call him papa...

597
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:17,779
He was your husband.

598
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,692
You know he often went there.

599
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:34,404
Are you going to stay in
Mumbai for business or go back?

600
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,413
I've to go to the office, mom.

601
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,416
Why didn't you come
back with us in the train?

602
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:54,621
I couldn't make it on time,
missed the train.

603
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:57,492
Where were you?
- And with whom?

604
00:52:58,296 --> 00:53:00,458
<i>Sabarmati.
- Why?</i>

605
00:53:04,302 --> 00:53:06,703
To meet Bapu.
- So did you meet him?

606
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,234
Yes, I did.
- What was he doing?

607
00:53:10,408 --> 00:53:11,341
Spinning his spinning-wheel.

608
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,635
Did you say something?
- Yes, he did.

609
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:15,544
He said "Sing for me".
- So?

610
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:18,142
I did?
- What did you sing?

611
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,117
Do you want to hear?
- Please do.

612
00:53:32,297 --> 00:53:33,458
Love my foot...

613
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:38,192
...since when did Bapu
start wearing jeans and t-shirt?

614
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:41,171
Oh, God. Ladies, we've work to do.

615
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,673
A presentation to be made, please.

616
00:53:49,614 --> 00:53:51,048
Adi!
- Tara!

617
00:53:52,183 --> 00:53:54,151
Tell your boss that you've a headache.

618
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:55,186
Take the day off and come with me.

619
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:57,788
Are you mad?

620
00:54:21,446 --> 00:54:23,471
I couldn't sleep all night.
- Me neither.

621
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,073
My hands are still shaking, look.

622
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,425
Stop it.
- Stop what?

623
00:54:38,096 --> 00:54:41,157
Stop...this madness.

624
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:44,665
I can't...what to do.

625
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:47,499
Adi!

626
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:55,075
Is this love?

627
00:54:58,449 --> 00:54:59,416
You won't say that, will you?

628
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,586
No!

629
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:05,979
I want ice-cream.

630
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:08,287
Ice-cream?

631
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:11,361
N ow?

632
00:55:28,346 --> 00:55:32,374
So...
- So?

633
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,514
Should I call mom tomorrow.

634
00:55:37,222 --> 00:55:38,246
What for?

635
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:40,050
So she can meet you.

636
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,388
Why me?

637
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:46,697
Our family must be there.

638
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:51,235
Why our family?

639
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:59,207
For our engagement, Adi.

640
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:31,165
What the...

641
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:43,015
Where are we going?

642
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:45,681
To your hostel.

643
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,385
Hostel? Why?

644
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:53,055
I am taking you to
your hostel before I stray?

645
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:57,230
What if you still do?

646
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,699
Then I will take you in my arms.

647
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:07,236
What then?

648
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:10,981
I won't let go.

649
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:14,642
Then?

650
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,482
Kiss you really hard.

651
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,324
And After kissing me hard?

652
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,591
Keep kissing you.

653
00:57:31,269 --> 00:57:32,259
What then?

654
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:02,522
What now?

655
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,366
Now you will pull me inside your room.

656
00:58:14,445 --> 00:58:15,640
And...

657
00:58:18,116 --> 00:58:19,515
Close the door!

658
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:22,615
And after closing the door?

659
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:27,750
I don't know...why don't
you take over from there!

660
00:58:34,432 --> 00:58:37,129
I will eat you up...alive!

661
00:58:40,071 --> 00:58:41,505
'I will pull up the curtains...'

662
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:47,238
'...clinch the rains and
hold on to the sky tight.'

663
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,070
'And hide in your arms.'

664
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:26,646
Do you like me?
- Hmmmm...

665
00:59:28,052 --> 00:59:29,713
But I can't say the
same for this hostel room.

666
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:35,457
Do you like me or this?

667
00:59:36,494 --> 00:59:37,586
Of course this.

668
00:59:39,497 --> 00:59:40,589
This is how much I like you.

669
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,299
Good.

670
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:45,364
That much is better.

671
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:54,771
Is it right what we're doing?

672
00:59:55,713 --> 00:59:57,181
It's a grave sin.

673
00:59:58,049 --> 01:00:02,646
But...the only way to
atone is to keep doing it.

674
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:11,485
I didn't get it.

675
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:13,760
What did you say?

676
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,128
Uncle, can Tara live here too?

677
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:23,268
Here? Here where?
- In my room.

678
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:25,466
Your room.

679
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:30,044
She's not some milk bottle
you can shelve on the teapoy.

680
01:00:31,516 --> 01:00:34,247
And where will you live?
- Even I'll stay on the teapoy.

681
01:00:34,585 --> 01:00:37,384
Sorry...in my room.

682
01:00:38,422 --> 01:00:40,481
<i>Oh, so she's Sitara.</i>

683
01:00:41,092 --> 01:00:43,720
Tara. <i>. .</i> baby, it's Tara.

684
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:45,553
I see...

685
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:47,522
Your room!

686
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,233
Together...in the same room?

687
01:00:51,536 --> 01:00:54,528
Together...in the same room!

688
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:56,800
Yes...

689
01:00:57,642 --> 01:00:59,542
Did you two get married?

690
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:01,340
We don't want to get married!

691
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:06,311
So...you two are 'Magliks'.

692
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:09,752
Then you can definitely
marry each other.

693
01:01:11,022 --> 01:01:12,456
There's a big problem, aunty.

694
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,421
What do you want to say?

695
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:20,262
Uncle, I am going to Paris...
to become an architect.

696
01:01:20,731 --> 01:01:23,166
He's going to America,
to become a millionaire.

697
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,573
And...until becomes a millionaire?

698
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:31,775
We want to live together until then.

699
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:34,375
I see...

700
01:01:34,445 --> 01:01:38,313
It's one of those...
live-in relationships.

701
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,342
Is it wrong, aunty?
- Absolutely wrong.

702
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:44,221
Paplu. You're too old fashioned.

703
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:50,221
He signals with his hand even
after turning on the indicator.

704
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:53,698
Look, this is absolutely wrong...

705
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,291
...and it's heading in
the wrong direction. - Uncle...

706
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,560
I won't allow this in my house.
- Listen to me.

707
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:02,400
Listen to me.

708
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,381
<i>Uncle, Tara and</i> I <i>are friends.</i>

709
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:18,647
We like each other.

710
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:20,649
Would it look nice if we met outside...

711
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:22,557
...in a hotel or other shady places?

712
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,458
Or live here decently,
with your permission and blessings.

713
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:28,623
Did you take your brother's blessings?

714
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,492
He will kill me.

715
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:32,432
I see...and I will spare you?

716
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:34,735
Aunty doesn't keep well...

717
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:36,136
...and you take care of her alone.

718
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:38,134
We can help you.

719
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:40,136
Even aunty won't feel bored.

720
01:02:40,211 --> 01:02:43,078
Look, this is my final decision.

721
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:45,446
And I am saying this
on Charu's behalf too.

722
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,143
This is my final decision.
- Uncle...

723
01:02:47,218 --> 01:02:50,620
There's no room for argument now.
- Don't be unreasonable, uncle.

724
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:34,576
Great.

725
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:07,974
This is our garden.

726
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,217
And our room is on the first floor,
check it out.

727
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:15,992
And that's uncle and aunt's room,
with full sea-view.

728
01:06:16,227 --> 01:06:18,093
The car's here, these are the flowers.

729
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,694
Hi, aunty.

730
01:06:24,268 --> 01:06:25,758
Aunty, this is Bittu and...

731
01:06:26,036 --> 01:06:27,629
And that's Ayesha.
- Hi, aunty.

732
01:06:28,472 --> 01:06:29,405
Hello, aunty.

733
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:30,304
You..

734
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:32,468
That's Bantu.
DDLJ...Maratha Mandir.

735
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:09,578
Sister-in-law.
- Whose sister-in-law?

736
01:07:10,414 --> 01:07:11,176
Hello, sister-in-law. Greetings.

01:07:11,248 --> 01:07:13,979
Where are you?
- Absolutely fine, sister-in-law.

738
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:16,484
What's going on?
- What else will I do in the morning?

739
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:17,715
I can hear some strange noises.

740
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:19,547
No, I was drinking tea...

741
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:21,990
It's hot. - I see...
- Tell her the truth.

742
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:25,652
Yes, How is brother?
- Yeah, he's fine.

743
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,725
And Tia?
- Tia's fine too.

744
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:30,495
Who is Tia?
- Here, talk to your brother.

745
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:31,467
Hello.
- Hello, Adi...

746
01:07:31,535 --> 01:07:33,128
Yes brother. . . .Yeah. . greetings.

747
01:07:33,203 --> 01:07:34,568
Listen...
- I am listening.

748
01:07:35,072 --> 01:07:37,166
Please explain your
address to this taxi driver.

749
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:39,340
Address? Taxi-driver? Why?

750
01:07:39,677 --> 01:07:41,111
So we can come there.

751
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:43,076
Where are you?
- On the way.

752
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,313
Mumbai?
- We're coming to meet you.

753
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:47,615
Coming here?

754
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:49,244
Talk to him.
- Yeah...

755
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:51,453
Driver...

756
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:53,680
Yeah...do you understand Marathi?
- I am from UP.

757
01:07:53,757 --> 01:07:54,690
Oh, so you're from UP as well.

758
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:58,251
Look...do you know Malabar Hills,
Hanging Gardens.

759
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,061
You're at Hanging Garden.

760
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,433
We're dead...it's the end.
- Who's dead?

761
01:08:05,035 --> 01:08:06,332
We are, who else?

762
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:08,303
I am not dead

763
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:10,204
Would you like me to make
some arrangements for you?

764
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:12,166
Get up, Tara...please, get up.

765
01:08:12,242 --> 01:08:14,142
Brother's in Mumbai for a day,
with the entire family...

766
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:15,007
...to give me a surprise.

767
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:16,046
Get up!

768
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:19,278
Stupid...why did you give
him the right directions?

769
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,374
You could've given
him a different route.

770
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:21,475
I could've slept little longer.

771
01:08:22,252 --> 01:08:24,687
Brother's here.
- So what now?

772
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:29,759
Where will you go?
- Me... Nowhere.

773
01:08:31,495 --> 01:08:32,462
Nowhere?

774
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,289
What will we do when brother
and sister-in-law come here?

775
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:38,194
I'll say "Greetings, I am Tara".

776
01:08:38,268 --> 01:08:41,101
"And I am living-in With Adi-Adi-Adi."

777
01:08:41,171 --> 01:08:43,572
Adi-Adi-Adi...
Tara, have you gone mad?

778
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:46,440
Please try to understand
the situation...and get up.

779
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:51,078
Hello.
- Greetings, sister-in-law.

780
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:52,205
How many times are
you going to greet her?

781
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:54,579
Listen...
- How far have you reached?

782
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:55,380
We're at the gate.

783
01:08:55,452 --> 01:08:57,443
At the gate? - Yes.
- I am coming, bye.

784
01:08:58,656 --> 01:09:00,681
My dear...dear bubbly...

785
01:09:01,025 --> 01:09:02,618
My sweetheart... my baby.

786
01:09:04,395 --> 01:09:05,726
Ok darling, listen...
help me out...

787
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:08,431
...or we'll get stuck
in a big drama. Please.

788
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:10,991
We're dead.

789
01:09:12,436 --> 01:09:13,369
This witch isn't getting up.

790
01:09:17,207 --> 01:09:19,699
I'll get that.
- Okay.

791
01:09:25,382 --> 01:09:27,373
Hello, sir.
- Hi. - Hi.

792
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,019
How are you, you fool?
- First class, sister-in-law.

01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,577
Fit and fine...

794
01:09:32,022 --> 01:09:33,319
So big man.
- Yeah.

795
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,188
All set to conquer America.
- Yeah, brother!

796
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:37,390
Tia! You've grown so tall in 10 days.

797
01:09:38,228 --> 01:09:39,195
Shall I make coffee for everyone?

798
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,595
Let us come in first,
meet Judge sir.

799
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,128
Hello, Charulata ma'am.

800
01:09:44,401 --> 01:09:45,493
How are you?

801
01:09:46,136 --> 01:09:48,468
Judge sir must be out playing cricket.

802
01:09:48,739 --> 01:09:50,366
Who are they, Adi?

803
01:09:50,574 --> 01:09:51,541
This is my brother.

804
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:54,473
He was junior to Gopi uncle...
he lived with you in Lucknow.

805
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,705
And this is my sister-in-law
and Tia. - I see.

806
01:09:57,114 --> 01:09:59,014
Where is Paplu?

807
01:10:00,184 --> 01:10:01,674
I think he's out playing cricket?

808
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:05,050
Paplu? - Gopi uncle.
She calls him fondly.

809
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:07,451
Just like you call brother...Dabbu.

810
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:09,421
What nonsense.

811
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:14,695
Where do you stay?
- Me? I stay right here.

812
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:19,233
His room is upstairs.
- Oh...thank you.

813
01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:22,236
Let's go...upstairs. Show me your room. Quickly!
- Now sister-in-law.

814
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:24,536
We'll see it right now.
- It's in a complete mess. - It's okay,

815
01:10:24,608 --> 01:10:26,303
I am hereto clean up your mess.

816
01:10:26,376 --> 01:10:27,104
Come on, show me.
- Sister-in-law.

817
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:28,611
Sister-in-law. Wait, sister-in-law.
- What happened?

818
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:30,374
I've changed.
- Very good.

819
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:32,515
Is this your room?
- No.

820
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,379
Okay.

821
01:10:33,684 --> 01:10:35,550
Is this? - Sister-in-law,
there's someone in my life.

822
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:39,653
What? Let me see.

823
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:42,787
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

824
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:48,231
Saved!

825
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,624
Sister-in-law.

826
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,764
You really have changed, Adi.

827
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:57,108
Like I said...
there's a change in my life.

828
01:10:57,508 --> 01:10:58,475
I can see that.

829
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:00,071
Hello, Baby.

830
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:03,112
Who are you?

No need for formalities, baldy.

Gunjal, sir.

834
01:11:08,285 --> 01:11:09,616

How far is your office?

Nice...and how do you go?

Yes. You can stay in Adi's room.

846

Okay, now shoot this fellow.

01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:19,508
Adi's.

889
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:21,275
Adi's?

890
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:23,369
Where do you stay?

891
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:29,417
You see,
Adi's brother is Naive...not me.

892
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,284
I can clearly figure
out what's going on here.

893
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,354
Are you two married?
- No.

894
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,693
But you intend to?

895
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:40,528
Right now our focus is our careers.

896
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:46,164
So you two live here...without marriage.

897
01:14:48,338 --> 01:14:50,670
I don't want interfere in your lives.

898
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:55,336
But you see, when two people
in love, live together...

899
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:58,443
...they get habituated to each other.

900
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,744
And when the time
comes to part ways...

901
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:05,080
...you can't get over
the habit... or love.

902
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:09,286
And let's assume that...
if you two have to part ways...

903
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:11,453
...for the sake of your careers.

904
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:16,193
What will choose...
habit or love?

905
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:22,603
Think about it.

906
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:28,076
And this...is yours.

907
01:15:30,147 --> 01:15:30,773
Bye.

908
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,753
Sweeta...

909
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:47,087
People tend to get...
cheated a lot.

910
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:55,071
Sister-in-law...knows...
what goes in the room.

911
01:15:55,305 --> 01:16:02,075
Don't scare me...
you know my heart's weak.

912
01:16:02,179 --> 01:16:09,381
Sister-in-law...must have...
told brother everything.

913
01:16:10,053 --> 01:16:13,250
<i>Tara-Tara-Tara-Tara-Tara!</i>

914
01:16:14,524 --> 01:16:16,993
You're crazy, showing up
in front of my entire family.

915
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:18,662
You didn't answer my phone either.

916
01:16:19,129 --> 01:16:20,722
But where are we going?

917
01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:24,124
You said you'll follow me until hell.

918
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:25,493
So why ask questions now?

919
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:28,565
Fine...but do you have
the address to hell?

920
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:35,476
Tara! It's a gynecology clinic.

921
01:16:35,712 --> 01:16:37,305
What a genius you are.

922
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:39,307
Hi.
- Hi.

923
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:41,781
Please wait there.

924
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:43,085
Okay.

925
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:45,582
Is this some kind of test
report... for Charu aunty?

926
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:47,623
Shut up!

927
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:00,468
Tara!

928
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:03,303
Everyone here looks pregnant.

929
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:07,177
They don't just look pregnant,
they are.

930
01:17:11,481 --> 01:17:12,380
Tara.

931
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:17,986
These test reports
you brought in...

932
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,682
Is it What I think it is?

933
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:24,659
How do I know what you're thinking?

934
01:17:27,197 --> 01:17:30,132
These are your test reports,
and not Charu aunty'

935
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:35,063
Tara, are you pregnant?

936
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:41,042
How can I be sure without
seeing the test results, Adi?

937
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:51,413
And what if the reports are positive?

938
01:17:56,059 --> 01:17:57,049
Maybe...

939
01:17:57,627 --> 01:17:59,789
The earth under
my feet is shaking.

940
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:06,125
It's not the earth,
your legs are shaking.

941
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:10,465
But Tara,
we did all the calculations.

942
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:13,369
Excuse me, ma'am...
Dr. Sheriyar is calling you.

943
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:17,443
Tara, wait a minute.

944
01:18:19,382 --> 01:18:20,577
Tara, wait...

945
01:18:31,061 --> 01:18:32,995
Hi.
- Hi.

946
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:35,693
First child?
- Don't know.

947
01:18:36,032 --> 01:18:37,227
Huh?
- Yeah...

948
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:40,737
No wonder you look so nervous.

949
01:18:41,271 --> 01:18:44,536
You know...when my husband
brought me here for the first time...

950
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:47,567
...he was saying "The ground
under my feet is shaking".

951
01:18:48,745 --> 01:18:50,440
I am sure his legs were shaking,
not the earth.

952
01:18:51,348 --> 01:18:52,179
It happens.

953
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:58,111
Listen...bring your wife
here every month for checkup.

954
01:18:58,255 --> 01:18:59,416
It's very important.

955
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:03,124
Look at my husband...
never takes time off his work.

956
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:05,122
So I come here on my own...alone.

957
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:09,098
But you must come with her, okay.

958
01:19:10,734 --> 01:19:12,634
You know...it's such a nice feeling...

959
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:16,605
...the little movements
inside the stomach.

960
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:19,231
Feels so nice...

961
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:21,271
My mind runs astray...

962
01:19:21,311 --> 01:19:22,335
Adi...
- Yeah.

963
01:19:22,646 --> 01:19:24,307
Let's go.
- Okay.

964
01:19:24,614 --> 01:19:26,207
Dry mango...
- No-no...thank you.

965
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:28,244
Bye, all the best.
- Bye...

966
01:19:28,318 --> 01:19:29,183
Tara...

967
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:30,981
What happened?
Tell me something.

968
01:19:31,621 --> 01:19:33,316
Positive? Negative?
Tell me something?

969
01:19:34,324 --> 01:19:35,655
Any movements inside your stomach?

970
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,293
Read it yourself.

971
01:19:45,635 --> 01:19:46,329
Tara...

972
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,434
Yeah... - What's this?
Looks like some drawings...

973
01:19:50,573 --> 01:19:52,507
Yeah...it's the floor
plan of the clinic.

974
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:55,335
Our company is
renovating the place.

975
01:19:55,445 --> 01:19:56,776
Come on...

976
01:19:57,347 --> 01:19:58,212
You're...

977
01:19:58,682 --> 01:20:00,241
Come on...

978
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:02,642
You looked so cute
when you were scared...

979
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,346
Very cute...
- Tara, what is this?

980
01:20:05,155 --> 01:20:06,020
Huh!

981
01:20:06,423 --> 01:20:07,390
Come here.

982
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:10,283
What is this?
What is this?

983
01:20:11,628 --> 01:20:12,390
Suri...

984
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:13,462
Yes, sir.
- What are you doing?

985
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,328
Your train's jumping around.

986
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:17,294
Sir, what weapon should I give him?

987
01:20:18,268 --> 01:20:21,238
Give him a big gun...you wouldn't
want to give him a slingshot!

988
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,671
Sir, how about a bazooka?
- Now you're talking.

989
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:26,338
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

990
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:29,102
Sir, the LA producers just called.

991
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:32,549
Tell them to take a flying
jump at a rolling donut.

992
01:20:33,049 --> 01:20:34,107
What are you guys up to?

993
01:20:34,284 --> 01:20:35,080
Hello, sir.

994
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:36,615
What's going on?

995
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:45,255
Wow! Who's that guy?

996
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,664
It's the main villain, dude.
- Villain?

997
01:20:48,732 --> 01:20:49,563
Yeah.

998
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:52,201
I've seen him somewhere before.
- Really?

999
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:55,100
Yes.
- It's you. - Me?

1000
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:57,566
Villain? With two heads.

1001
01:21:04,714 --> 01:21:05,704
What's happening?

1002
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:14,353
Jump...

1003
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:16,085
Jump...go up--

1004
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:23,494
Kill him. Kill him.

1005
01:21:28,304 --> 01:21:30,329
Nice...
- Boss, you're amazing.

1006
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:33,437
Your game's awesome.
- Thank you, sir.

1007
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,536
Immediately ship to LA.
- Immediately?

1008
01:21:36,613 --> 01:21:38,604
Immediately!
- Done, sir we are ready.

1009
01:21:44,687 --> 01:21:45,620
Tara!

1010
01:21:53,062 --> 01:21:54,325
You didn't sleep all night?

1011
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:02,495
Either you're very happy
or very sad?

1012
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:05,732
People often lose their
sleep in these two conditions.

1013
01:22:09,379 --> 01:22:10,744
It's both.

1014
01:22:15,752 --> 01:22:17,186
I just got an email from Paris.

1015
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:19,680
I got the admission.

1016
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:24,018
Wow...so I know why you're happy.

1017
01:22:24,093 --> 01:22:25,083
But why the tears?

1018
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,255
Feels like I am leaving
something behind.

1019
01:22:32,335 --> 01:22:33,598
Does Adi know?

1020
01:22:35,705 --> 01:22:36,570
No!

1021
01:22:41,244 --> 01:22:42,541
Tell me something.

1022
01:22:45,415 --> 01:22:47,315
What's more important for you?

1023
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,415
Your career or Adi?

1024
01:22:59,295 --> 01:23:00,990
6 months ago I would've said career.

1025
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:01,724
But now...

1026
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:17,412
<i>Tara-Tara-Tara!</i>

1027
01:23:17,614 --> 01:23:19,309
<i>Tara-Tara-Tara!</i>

1028
01:23:20,116 --> 01:23:21,345
Tara...

1029
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:23,642
Why are you packing our clothes?

1030
01:23:25,054 --> 01:23:27,022
Just mine...not yours.

1031
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:30,088
Tara?

1032
01:23:31,494 --> 01:23:32,359
What's wrong?

1033
01:23:33,329 --> 01:23:34,262
I am leaving.

1034
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:38,232
But Why?

1035
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:40,435
Hello.

1036
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:43,405
It's over!

1037
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:50,808
Tara, what happened?

1038
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:56,710
Only for two days.

1039
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:02,421
S***“ man... you witch...

1040
01:24:03,192 --> 01:24:05,991
You're such a drama queen.

1041
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,731
It's not my fault that
you always fall for it.

1042
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:12,665
Thank God...l thought you
found out about Anjali and Zoya...

1043
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:15,136
...and you're leaving me.
- Shut up!

1044
01:24:15,271 --> 01:24:16,170
Shut up...

1045
01:24:17,473 --> 01:24:20,704
Who are you going with?
- Mr. Doshi.

1046
01:24:21,044 --> 01:24:22,375
I don't like this Mr. Doshi, you know.

1047
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:25,071
What is your problem
with a 80 year old man?

1048
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:26,673
Old men like him are perverts too.

1049
01:24:28,451 --> 01:24:29,316
Come here.

1050
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,487
Stay for a while.

1051
01:24:32,255 --> 01:24:33,154
I am getting late.

1052
01:24:33,222 --> 01:24:35,122
What late?
You're not allowed to go.

1053
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:36,524
Now allowed.

1054
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,087
Look...we already made it clear.
- What?

1055
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:43,189
No asserting rights.

1056
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:45,701
I see...

1057
01:24:46,736 --> 01:24:50,502
Save it for your wife.
- Wife? No thank you.

1058
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:52,408
Fine, go.

1059
01:24:53,109 --> 01:24:54,804
Bye, Tara. Hi, Anjali.

1060
01:24:55,144 --> 01:24:56,407
Yeah, Anjali.
What's the plan?

1061
01:24:57,213 --> 01:24:58,647
Bye, darling. Have fun!

1062
01:25:02,018 --> 01:25:02,678
Darling my foot...

1063
01:25:02,752 --> 01:25:03,548
Wait.

1064
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:05,185
Adi. Adi. Adi.

1065
01:29:05,361 --> 01:29:09,161
Darling...where are you?

1066
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:12,501
Adi!

1067
01:29:27,283 --> 01:29:29,650
Hi, guys.
- Hello, dear.

1068
01:29:30,253 --> 01:29:32,585
Where's Adi?
His phone switched off as well.

1069
01:29:33,022 --> 01:29:34,490
Didn't Adi go with you?

1070
01:29:35,091 --> 01:29:37,150
He's sleeping in his room.

1071
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,456
I am really scared of this boy.

1072
01:29:41,597 --> 01:29:44,191
He wants perfection in everything.
- What Perfection?

1073
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:46,601
His game...on the Underworld.

1074
01:29:47,136 --> 01:29:50,697
He goes to really dangerous
places for research...

1075
01:29:51,774 --> 01:29:53,139
I am really scared, man.

1076
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:55,441
Still can't get through him.

1077
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,535
Look, Adi will come
back sooner or later.

1078
01:30:54,103 --> 01:30:56,333
But don't chase him
around like a wife.

1079
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,232
I am not chasing him.

1080
01:30:58,507 --> 01:31:01,272
But he should at least tell me...

1081
01:31:04,613 --> 01:31:05,705
Adi?
- Hello.

1082
01:31:07,016 --> 01:31:09,041
Are you at the office?
- Where are you?

1083
01:31:09,618 --> 01:31:10,779
I am waiting for you.

1084
01:31:11,787 --> 01:31:13,312
Just come out of your office.

1085
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:17,694
Hello.
- Just wait there, I am coming.

1086
01:31:18,661 --> 01:31:21,756
Where are you?
- Just keep walking straight.

1087
01:31:22,131 --> 01:31:25,226
Where?
- You sound so sexy in that angry tone!

1088
01:31:25,634 --> 01:31:29,070
Just let me get my hands
on you...l will shoot you.

1089
01:31:40,082 --> 01:31:40,674
How about a sword instead?

1090
01:31:41,384 --> 01:31:43,148
You'll need a license to shoot me.

1091
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,216
Where were you?

1092
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:47,622
And why call me here?

1093
01:31:48,257 --> 01:31:49,315
It's an expensive restaurant.

1094
01:31:49,392 --> 01:31:51,360
I thought, maybe you
won't make a scene here.

1095
01:31:55,498 --> 01:31:57,830
Answer me.
- Would you like to eat?

1096
01:31:59,301 --> 01:32:00,132
I want to eat you.

1097
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,362
No possible. Today is Tuesday.

1098
01:32:02,438 --> 01:32:04,270
And you don't eat meat on Tuesdays.

1099
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:08,005
Why don't you just
tell me where you were?

1100
01:32:11,313 --> 01:32:14,248
Don't you care about what
I've been through in the last 2 days?

1101
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:21,156
Don't you think...it's
your responsibility...

1102
01:32:21,223 --> 01:32:23,214
...to tell me where you were.

1103
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:26,754
Remember...your last
words before you left.

1104
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:29,725
No asserting rights!

1105
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:34,332
So this is revenge?
- No...

1106
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:37,630
You could've kept your phone on.

1107
01:32:38,507 --> 01:32:39,804
How could I? I was in Kanpur.

1108
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:44,375
Mom?

1109
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:47,775
Yeah...why else would I go there?

1110
01:32:48,584 --> 01:32:49,813
Did you go there on your own?

1111
01:32:50,419 --> 01:32:51,682
I had no plans of going there.

1112
01:32:53,122 --> 01:32:54,681
Look, I am a middle-class guy.

1113
01:32:55,724 --> 01:32:58,193
So when your private plane
came to pick me up, I obliged.

1114
01:32:59,061 --> 01:32:59,721
You weren't here either.

1115
01:33:00,062 --> 01:33:01,723
So I thought I'll do
some sightseeing in Kanpur.

1116
01:33:02,698 --> 01:33:03,688
What did she say?

1117
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:08,365
She wanted to know why
I have been chasing you around.

1118
01:33:10,339 --> 01:33:13,365
She already knew who and what I am.

1119
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:18,078
Then?
- Then...l told her.

1120
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:20,675
"Your Tara made me
see stars in daylight."

1121
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:23,449
Then?

1122
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,452
Then she asked... "What
made you move in with me"?

1123
01:33:31,727 --> 01:33:32,660
What did you say?

1124
01:33:33,262 --> 01:33:35,663
I said "I don't know...
I'll go ask her" and left.

1125
01:33:38,734 --> 01:33:41,066
So...what did you see in me, Tara?

1126
01:33:50,746 --> 01:33:52,077
Hey, that's Vodka.

1127
01:33:56,652 --> 01:33:58,142
Excuse me, sir...your check.
- Tara...

1128
01:33:59,255 --> 01:34:00,552
Oh, man!
- Tara.

1129
01:34:01,624 --> 01:34:02,557
Tara, listen to me.

1130
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:05,253
Don't talk to me!
- What else should I do?

1131
01:34:05,494 --> 01:34:07,986
I can't divorce you,
because I've no right over you.

1132
01:34:08,063 --> 01:34:10,623
Divorce. Divorce. Divorce.
Don't show me your face for two days.

1133
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,067
Just two days?

1134
01:34:15,538 --> 01:34:16,528
Come here.

1135
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:18,372
Come here.

1136
01:34:21,243 --> 01:34:22,540
First selfie of our first fight.

1137
01:34:22,778 --> 01:34:24,075
I am uploading this.

1138
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:16,062
Taxi.

1139
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:19,267
Let's go quickly.

1140
01:35:23,305 --> 01:35:24,272
Tara.

1141
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:28,567
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Hey man, do you have a death-wish?

1142
01:35:29,044 --> 01:35:30,409
Follow that car, please.
- Why?

1143
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:33,210
Love,huh?
- Follow her.

1144
01:35:48,697 --> 01:35:49,562
Stop.

1145
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:57,301
Madam, my fare? - Take your fare
from that blue T- Shirt boy.

1146
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:00,041
Sir... - What?
- My fare.

1147
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:10,076
Come on.
- Where?

1148
01:37:11,213 --> 01:37:14,114
Right there.
- Who? The Big Guy!

1149
01:37:15,184 --> 01:37:17,084
We're not on good terms these days.

1150
01:37:21,323 --> 01:37:22,381
Let's go make an offering.

1151
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:24,624
I prayed for your safe return.

1152
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:44,111
Charu Aunty!

1153
01:37:46,248 --> 01:37:47,579
Adi.
- Charu Aunty!

1154
01:37:47,649 --> 01:37:49,208
I...
- What are you doing here?

1155
01:37:50,786 --> 01:37:51,719
I...

1156
01:37:52,755 --> 01:37:54,018
Get up...come on...

1157
01:37:54,423 --> 01:37:55,254
Come on...

1158
01:37:56,658 --> 01:38:00,060
I was...
- Where were you going?

1159
01:38:02,231 --> 01:38:03,357
I forgot.

1160
01:38:04,233 --> 01:38:05,632
Come.
- Come, let's go home.

1161
01:38:32,494 --> 01:38:35,429
It's the next stage of Alzheimer's.

1162
01:39:00,022 --> 01:39:02,286
What did the doctor say?
- The doctor said...

1163
01:39:02,357 --> 01:39:05,327
...you're in much better
condition than before.

1164
01:39:06,128 --> 01:39:07,527
Don't lie to me, Paplu.

1165
01:39:09,698 --> 01:39:13,225
I can hear noises in my head all day.

1166
01:39:13,602 --> 01:39:15,297
I am forgetting everything.

1167
01:39:15,637 --> 01:39:18,129
People. . . places. . everything.

1168
01:39:18,574 --> 01:39:23,478
Even my music seems to be leaving me...
- No-no...that's not possible.

1169
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:29,245
Fine, so what the doctor
say...while giving you the medicines.

1170
01:39:29,318 --> 01:39:33,221
I am losing my memory...not my mind.

1171
01:39:33,388 --> 01:39:36,653
Doctor told to take medicine
after reaching home.

1172
01:39:39,294 --> 01:39:40,159
Paplu...

1173
01:39:41,697 --> 01:39:46,157
...what if I forget you someday?

1174
01:39:51,573 --> 01:39:52,631
What will you do?

1175
01:40:24,573 --> 01:40:26,473
What's going on, mama?

1176
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:29,273
Hello.
- Hello...who do you want to meet?

1177
01:40:29,478 --> 01:40:33,244
Ravi Gunjal.
- l...l am Ravi Gunjal.

1178
01:40:33,782 --> 01:40:36,547
I see... Sit. I am Tara's mom.

1179
01:40:37,786 --> 01:40:38,651
Sit.

1180
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:44,116
Idiot...why do you always
create problems for me?

1181
01:40:44,192 --> 01:40:46,388
Good evening guys.
- What did I do now?

1182
01:40:46,795 --> 01:40:49,127
Well, there's one right here...now.

1183
01:40:50,632 --> 01:40:51,565
Take a look...

1184
01:40:55,137 --> 01:40:57,071
What is all this?

1185
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:02,107
Who is she? Do you know her?

1186
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:03,742
Yes, brother. She is Tara's mom.

1187
01:41:05,414 --> 01:41:06,540
And who is Tara?

1188
01:41:09,017 --> 01:41:09,711
Her daughter.

1189
01:41:10,185 --> 01:41:12,677
I will slap you out cold.

1190
01:41:14,556 --> 01:41:16,320
I mean Gopi uncle's niece.

1191
01:41:16,458 --> 01:41:17,687
She's living with him.

1192
01:41:18,026 --> 01:41:20,461
No she's not, she lives with you.

1193
01:41:20,662 --> 01:41:22,096
In your room.

1194
01:41:22,431 --> 01:41:24,763
And her mother is sitting
in our living room.

1195
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,663
Does Gopi know? - She lives
here with Gopi uncle's consent.

1196
01:41:28,737 --> 01:41:31,434
She is his niece.
- Gopi's lost his mind.

1197
01:41:32,107 --> 01:41:33,165
He doesn't know anything.

1198
01:41:33,442 --> 01:41:37,140
Bloody Ravi Gunjal...if
I've lost my mind...

1199
01:41:37,212 --> 01:41:39,112
...why is there hair
growing on your head?

1200
01:41:39,615 --> 01:41:41,811
That baldy's grown hair?

1201
01:41:43,218 --> 01:41:45,653
Sir...l didn't know you were there too...

1202
01:41:45,721 --> 01:41:46,654
Would you like some sweets?

1203
01:41:46,788 --> 01:41:48,347
Did you forget the
thrashing in Lucknow?

1204
01:41:48,657 --> 01:41:49,624
Would you like some more?

1205
01:41:51,693 --> 01:41:54,355
No, sir... Tara's mom is here.

1206
01:41:54,529 --> 01:41:56,156
What do I do? Tell me...

1207
01:41:56,331 --> 01:41:58,322
You fool, you should be thankful that...

1208
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,664
...they came to you.

1209
01:42:01,336 --> 01:42:02,462
Sir, she's here with
a marriage proposal...

1210
01:42:02,537 --> 01:42:03,698
She is talking about marriage.

1211
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,264
You won't find another girl like her.

1212
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:07,206
Get lost.

1213
01:42:14,516 --> 01:42:16,245
Did you show this to the lawyer?
- Yeah ma'am...

1214
01:42:16,318 --> 01:42:18,446
...l've shown it to the lawyer,
but they are not agreeing...

1215
01:42:20,522 --> 01:42:22,513
I am a little busy Tara,
can I call you back?

1216
01:42:22,591 --> 01:42:23,717
No mom, I want to talk right now.

1217
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:24,759
Don't hang up.

1218
01:42:25,227 --> 01:42:26,524
Driver, stop the car please.

1219
01:42:28,063 --> 01:42:29,622
Please excuse me. Take the follow car.

1220
01:42:29,765 --> 01:42:31,096
Yeah, sure ma'am.

1221
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:39,336
Go ahead, Tara.

1222
01:42:39,408 --> 01:42:41,740
Why are you interfering
in my life, mom. - Manners!

1223
01:42:43,045 --> 01:42:46,208
Who told you to fix my marriage?
- Who's going to tell me?

1224
01:42:46,815 --> 01:42:50,046
Are you going to tell me...
or am I going to tell you to get married?

1225
01:42:50,485 --> 01:42:53,216
You live with a complete
stranger...all alone.

1226
01:42:53,388 --> 01:42:54,549
Who else is going to
talk some sense into you?

1227
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:56,316
He's not a stranger.

1228
01:42:56,658 --> 01:42:58,092
So why don't you marry him?

1229
01:42:58,427 --> 01:42:59,826
Marriage is not my priority.

1230
01:43:00,062 --> 01:43:02,030
You might have been a burden...
- Manners...

1231
01:43:02,364 --> 01:43:04,196
Maybe you were a burden
on your family, but not me.

1232
01:43:04,266 --> 01:43:05,427
I can look after myself.

1233
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,365
I see...did you grow up on your own?

1234
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:11,631
That's the most I could've
done for you as your mother.

1235
01:43:12,074 --> 01:43:13,508
I proposed marriage on your behalf...

1236
01:43:13,575 --> 01:43:15,202
...to the guy you like.

1237
01:43:15,577 --> 01:43:17,272
Asked for his hand
in marriage...for you.

1238
01:43:17,746 --> 01:43:19,111
Has any mother ever done that?

1239
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:20,778
No mother has ever
done what you did either.

1240
01:43:21,149 --> 01:43:23,675
Making the police spy on me.

1241
01:43:24,352 --> 01:43:26,150
I was not spying on you, Tara!

1242
01:43:26,388 --> 01:43:28,516
Come on, stop it.
- You shut up!

1243
01:43:28,623 --> 01:43:30,113
Don't forget your manners, Tara!

1244
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:32,618
No, mom...

1245
01:43:33,395 --> 01:43:35,557
I wasn't telling you...
- Manners!

1246
01:43:40,535 --> 01:43:41,559
Such anger, Tara.

1247
01:43:42,237 --> 01:43:43,534
Stop it now...enough!

1248
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:45,734
Come on, I want to
show you something.

1249
01:43:45,807 --> 01:43:46,638
Come on...

1250
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:48,406
Come on... Hey...

1251
01:43:52,748 --> 01:43:53,476
Tara...

1252
01:43:54,416 --> 01:43:58,785
Listen...this is it
now...the final verdict.

1253
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:04,153
So stop fuming... and start praying.

1254
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,188
For me, please...

1255
01:44:16,738 --> 01:44:17,603
Okay.

1256
01:44:19,007 --> 01:44:19,701
Eyes closed.

1257
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,713
Where are these guys?

1258
01:44:30,786 --> 01:44:32,481
Sorry-sorry-sorry-sorry...

1259
01:44:32,587 --> 01:44:33,418
Hi...

1260
01:44:33,755 --> 01:44:35,553
Adi.
- Okay, rolling.

1261
01:45:58,406 --> 01:45:59,635
Number one.

1262
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:01,099
Adi.

1263
01:46:02,611 --> 01:46:04,204
Three cheers for Adi.

1264
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:06,106
Hip-hip hurray!

1265
01:46:06,314 --> 01:46:07,577
Hip-hip hurray!

1266
01:46:07,649 --> 01:46:09,583
Hip-hip hurray!

1267
01:46:11,186 --> 01:46:12,551
Dude, you've done it.

1268
01:46:13,255 --> 01:46:15,690
Those LA guys love your game.
- Yeah...

1269
01:46:15,991 --> 01:46:20,224
They immediately sent your ticket,
visa...everything. - Oh, sir...

1270
01:46:20,262 --> 01:46:22,253
And in 10 days...you're out of here.

1271
01:46:22,731 --> 01:46:24,290
10 days!

1272
01:46:27,135 --> 01:46:28,125
Adi bro...

1273
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,160
Come lets 90..

1274
01:46:30,305 --> 01:46:32,399
Let's party.
Time to open up the bottles...

1275
01:46:37,712 --> 01:46:41,774
Jenny...welcome back.
- Thank you.

1276
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:42,744
Cheers.

1277
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:51,418
Tara, come please.

1278
01:46:51,493 --> 01:46:53,018
Adi, is going tara.

1279
01:46:53,328 --> 01:46:54,318
Tara please.

1280
01:46:54,362 --> 01:46:57,263
My heart's really depressed, Jenny.
- Why?

1281
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:00,330
Scared of going to America?
- No.

1282
01:47:01,236 --> 01:47:02,499
Scared of leaving her.

1283
01:47:07,442 --> 01:47:08,500
Tara!

1284
01:47:10,679 --> 01:47:12,238
My biggest mistake.

1285
01:47:16,718 --> 01:47:19,710
Shall I tell her?
- I will strangle you.

1286
01:47:28,997 --> 01:47:33,230
I must leave this beautiful world,
just to go to America!

1287
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:45,103
Cheers Jenny.

1288
01:48:05,567 --> 01:48:08,127
Stop here, please.

1289
01:48:09,437 --> 01:48:10,370
What happened?

1290
01:48:14,676 --> 01:48:17,338
What's wrong, Tara?

1291
01:48:21,649 --> 01:48:23,139
How much?
- 150.

1292
01:48:24,386 --> 01:48:25,410
Here...thank you.

1293
01:48:42,003 --> 01:48:43,061
When are you going to America?

1294
01:48:46,241 --> 01:48:47,174
Will you come along?

1295
01:48:49,744 --> 01:48:51,269
Only to see you off.

1296
01:48:54,282 --> 01:48:55,772
Better to part ways right here.

1297
01:48:56,718 --> 01:48:58,618
It'll be much more complicated later.

1298
01:49:00,021 --> 01:49:01,989
Will you go to Paris with me?

1299
01:49:08,063 --> 01:49:11,294
Tell me something...why
are we scaring each other...

1300
01:49:11,599 --> 01:49:12,623
...about parting ways?

1301
01:49:13,568 --> 01:49:15,332
Because we are scared.

1302
01:49:16,337 --> 01:49:17,498
It's time to part ways.

1303
01:49:21,342 --> 01:49:26,303
Adi. The last 6 months...

1304
01:49:27,415 --> 01:49:28,712
Time just flew by.

1305
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,587
The best days of my life.

1306
01:49:36,257 --> 01:49:37,122
Mine too.

1307
01:49:40,161 --> 01:49:41,356
Just 10 more days.

1308
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:45,366
And then, you'll be off to Paris...

1309
01:49:45,433 --> 01:49:46,491
...and I will be in US.

1310
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:51,436
We will move on in our lives.

1311
01:49:53,308 --> 01:49:54,537
Maybe you will find someone.

1312
01:49:55,376 --> 01:49:56,673
Maybe you will find someone!

1313
01:50:03,418 --> 01:50:06,183
So then...just 10 days, huh!

1314
01:50:13,695 --> 01:50:16,665
Tara...promise me.

1315
01:50:19,267 --> 01:50:22,567
The next 10 days...no
fights or quarrels.

1316
01:50:25,607 --> 01:50:29,043
No emotional talk...no arguments...

1317
01:50:30,512 --> 01:50:32,037
No drama...

1318
01:50:34,048 --> 01:50:34,776
Okay.

1319
01:50:36,618 --> 01:50:38,677
No crying...no sleeping...

1320
01:50:41,156 --> 01:50:41,782
Okay.

1321
01:50:44,492 --> 01:50:46,654
Full party...full on fun.

1322
01:50:49,731 --> 01:50:54,191
Let's live an entire
lifetime in these 10 days.

1323
01:50:55,203 --> 01:50:56,830
Okay-
<i>,</i> Okay-

1324
01:50:57,105 --> 01:50:58,504
Okay-
<i>,</i> Okay-

1325
01:50:58,573 --> 01:51:02,441
Okay.
- Okay...Darling!

1326
01:51:27,101 --> 01:51:28,535
What if this was our home?

1327
01:51:29,604 --> 01:51:31,333
All the rooms would
be our bedrooms

1328
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:36,477
And a fierce dog.

1329
01:51:37,512 --> 01:51:38,707
Shishupal.

1330
01:51:39,113 --> 01:51:40,205
Shishupal?

1331
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:43,647
Shishupal!

1332
01:51:46,187 --> 01:51:47,154
And kids?

1333
01:51:49,457 --> 01:51:51,448
We'll adopt a boy for one day.

1334
01:51:55,063 --> 01:51:56,553
And we'll call him Shishupal.

1335
01:51:58,099 --> 01:52:00,158
What if it's a girl?
- Still Shishupal.

1336
01:52:01,603 --> 01:52:03,264
Yeah, baby...

1337
01:52:05,073 --> 01:52:06,063
Come on...

1338
01:52:12,747 --> 01:52:14,613
What will you do in America?

1339
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:16,483
Go to a strip club.

1340
01:52:17,485 --> 01:52:18,384
Shut up.

1341
01:52:18,786 --> 01:52:21,050
Ask me what I'll do in Paris.

1342
01:52:21,356 --> 01:52:22,323
What will you do?

1343
01:52:23,524 --> 01:52:24,355
Don't know.

1344
01:52:25,159 --> 01:52:28,220
Maybe waste my time
thinking what you're doing.

1345
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,564
But you'll be at the strip club.

1346
01:52:36,037 --> 01:52:37,596
I love you!

1347
01:52:44,245 --> 01:52:45,804
Tick-tock-tick-tock...

1348
01:52:47,749 --> 01:52:49,342
...time's slipping through.

1349
01:52:59,594 --> 01:53:01,119
Say "Don't cry Tara"!

1350
01:53:05,466 --> 01:53:06,558
Say it!

1351
01:53:13,775 --> 01:53:15,072
Don't cry, Tara.

1352
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:23,448
Okay, darling.

1353
01:53:34,329 --> 01:53:36,058
Here-here-here-here...come.

1354
01:53:41,769 --> 01:53:42,634
Thank you.

1355
01:54:05,727 --> 01:54:07,058
Hey...

1356
01:54:34,122 --> 01:54:35,180
Say something.

1357
01:54:37,291 --> 01:54:40,056
I am drunk...l'll say the truth.

1358
01:54:45,299 --> 01:54:46,391
Then spill it out.

1359
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:50,795
What do you really want now?

1360
01:54:54,375 --> 01:54:55,342
Right now...

1361
01:54:55,476 --> 01:55:02,473
I want a tender... hot...
eggs on toast.

1362
01:55:09,323 --> 01:55:13,692
Hmmm...me too.

1363
01:55:24,705 --> 01:55:27,731
Take that chain off...
- Why?

1364
01:55:28,443 --> 01:55:30,104
Take it off...or I'll snatch it.

1365
01:55:52,567 --> 01:55:54,501
So how many days is that worth?

1366
01:55:57,505 --> 01:55:58,472
Tara!

1367
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:04,508
You want me to keep it
with me and always miss you.

1368
01:56:06,314 --> 01:56:10,308
No. I want to keep
that with me always...

1369
01:56:10,384 --> 01:56:13,479
...so I can smile
when I think of you.

1370
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:14,713
Okay.

1371
01:56:47,388 --> 01:56:51,723
I wonder what the kids
do out there until midnight.

1372
01:56:53,194 --> 01:56:57,188
What kids? We don't have kids.

1373
01:56:57,732 --> 01:57:00,030
You do have one...Paplu.

1374
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:05,203
And dinner?
- We already ate.

1375
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:08,305
Now we'll eat tomorrow...
With the kids.

1376
01:57:08,376 --> 01:57:12,210
On our 'Golden Anniversary'.

1377
01:57:21,022 --> 01:57:23,184
That's what I've been doing.

1378
01:57:23,624 --> 01:57:25,023
Show off.

1379
01:57:35,202 --> 01:57:37,000
Why is the door open?

1380
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:41,768
Happy anniversary guys.

1381
01:57:43,778 --> 01:57:45,041
Adi.

1382
01:57:51,586 --> 01:57:54,021
Is the gas on? Take a look.

1383
01:57:55,356 --> 01:57:56,687
Gopi uncle.

1384
01:57:58,659 --> 01:58:00,127
Charu aunty.

1385
01:58:01,228 --> 01:58:02,559
It was on?
- Yeah.

1386
01:58:04,165 --> 01:58:05,155
Let's check upstairs.

1387
01:58:11,472 --> 01:58:12,564
Uncle.

1388
01:58:13,674 --> 01:58:15,199
I'm calling Gopi uncle.

1389
01:58:15,343 --> 01:58:16,469
Charu aunty.

1390
01:58:21,215 --> 01:58:22,148
His phone's right here.

1391
01:58:24,452 --> 01:58:25,419
Somethings wrong.

1392
01:58:26,187 --> 01:58:27,120
Hemu.

1393
01:58:28,222 --> 01:58:29,485
Give me the car keys.

1394
01:58:29,757 --> 01:58:30,588
Where are uncle and aunty?

1395
01:58:30,658 --> 01:58:32,183
I was coming over to give the keys...

1396
01:58:32,259 --> 01:58:34,353
...when I learned that madam walked out.

1397
01:58:34,528 --> 01:58:35,495
It's been over 30 minutes.

1398
01:58:35,563 --> 01:58:37,554
And sir is already
out looking for her.

1399
01:58:37,632 --> 01:58:39,532
Here's the key.
- This is uncle's phone.

1400
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:40,726
Call me if you find out anything.
- Okay.

1401
01:58:41,002 --> 01:58:41,525
Come on.

1402
01:58:41,602 --> 01:58:43,229
Be careful.
- Yeah.

1403
01:58:45,306 --> 01:58:46,205
Let's go.

1404
01:59:11,499 --> 01:59:12,989
Stop. Stop.
- What?

1405
01:59:13,534 --> 01:59:16,162
Charu Aunty.
- That's not her.

1406
01:59:21,175 --> 01:59:22,404
It's completely our fault.

1407
01:59:23,044 --> 01:59:25,445
We should've convinced
uncle to hire a nurse.

1408
01:59:25,713 --> 01:59:27,044
Aunty was always clear about that...

1409
01:59:27,114 --> 01:59:28,309
Only uncle will take care of her.

1410
01:59:28,549 --> 01:59:29,675
Of course she will say that.

1411
01:59:31,085 --> 01:59:33,053
Will uncle listen
to you or Charu aunty?

1412
01:59:38,025 --> 01:59:39,390
Which way should we go now?

1413
01:59:41,062 --> 01:59:43,053
Wait...l'll go take a look.

1414
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:44,095
On the temple road.

1415
01:59:45,132 --> 01:59:47,601
Adi, stop.
- Keep seated, I'll go take a look.

1416
01:59:47,735 --> 01:59:49,032
Don't yell at me.

1417
01:59:49,537 --> 01:59:51,631
Don't turn off the engine,
and don't go anywhere.

1418
02:00:05,486 --> 02:00:06,681
Charu aunty!

1419
02:00:20,568 --> 02:00:21,694
She isn't there.

1420
02:00:27,575 --> 02:00:29,441
Don't you see the 'No-Parking' board?

1421
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:31,478
Why park your car here?
- Sir, my wife's missing.

1422
02:00:31,545 --> 02:00:33,639
What do I do?
- Come on, show me your license.

1423
02:00:33,714 --> 02:00:35,478
Let me go, sir...
- Come on...

1424
02:00:35,549 --> 02:00:38,177
Get out...get out now...
- I am going!

1425
02:01:29,136 --> 02:01:30,194
It's locked.

1426
02:01:34,074 --> 02:01:35,041
Where were you?

1427
02:01:35,676 --> 02:01:36,802
I was checking in the market.

1428
02:01:37,111 --> 02:01:38,579
I told you to stay in the car!

1429
02:01:39,747 --> 02:01:42,739
Why? Only you can go
look for Charu aunty, not me?

1430
02:01:43,117 --> 02:01:44,175
What if she was in the market?

1431
02:01:44,685 --> 02:01:45,675
Couldn't you wait for me?

1432
02:01:45,753 --> 02:01:48,450
You left the car
there...and a cop showed up.

1433
02:01:49,356 --> 02:01:52,553
You can't handle a cop,
but you can yell on me.

1434
02:01:54,428 --> 02:01:56,453
Take a left here...up
ahead...the hospital road.

1435
02:01:56,530 --> 02:01:58,464
It's a one way...we'll get in trouble.

1436
02:01:58,766 --> 02:02:01,360
Then go around.
- I am...l am...

1437
02:02:01,435 --> 02:02:02,527
Stop bothering me.

1438
02:02:05,239 --> 02:02:07,469
If you're so fed-up,
why don't you just leave me?

1439
02:02:10,044 --> 02:02:11,307
I am leaving you forever!

1440
02:02:11,378 --> 02:02:12,675
I'm going to America.

1441
02:02:13,614 --> 02:02:14,706
Isn't that what you want?

1442
02:02:19,653 --> 02:02:21,553
Adi...Gopi uncle!

1443
02:02:22,456 --> 02:02:24,151
What is this? You want to die?

1444
02:02:24,658 --> 02:02:26,319
Tara! Tara!

1445
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,292
Gopi uncle! - Are you crazy?
Do you have a death wish?

1446
02:02:28,662 --> 02:02:29,390
Hey...

1447
02:02:29,797 --> 02:02:31,697
Wait there...l'll handle you.
Handle your wife first...

1448
02:02:31,765 --> 02:02:33,130
Handle your wife first...

1449
02:02:33,334 --> 02:02:35,166
Come on...come you rascal...

1450
02:02:35,402 --> 02:02:36,665
Where are you going?

1451
02:02:37,104 --> 02:02:41,337
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1452
02:02:42,076 --> 02:02:44,306
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1453
02:02:46,046 --> 02:02:48,174
Gopi uncle! Gopi uncle!

1454
02:02:49,416 --> 02:02:50,349
Gopi uncle!

1455
02:03:03,097 --> 02:03:06,260
Come on. - You can't
just jump out of a moving car.

1456
02:03:06,333 --> 02:03:08,097
Should I jump in front of a car too?

1457
02:03:10,137 --> 02:03:11,434
What did you see?

1458
02:03:12,273 --> 02:03:14,674
That man...he looked
just like Gopi uncle!

1459
02:03:21,548 --> 02:03:23,016
What if he had hit you?

1460
02:03:25,519 --> 02:03:26,509
But he did.

1461
02:03:26,654 --> 02:03:29,624
What if he had? What then?

1462
02:03:30,624 --> 02:03:33,059
If you care so much for me,
why are you yelling?

1463
02:03:33,127 --> 02:03:34,288
I am not yelling!

1464
02:03:54,515 --> 02:03:55,812
Poor Gopi uncle.

1465
02:03:58,252 --> 02:04:00,619
No one can be as caring as him.

1466
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:04,385
That's not true.

1467
02:04:08,062 --> 02:04:10,531
You think only uncle
can take care of aunty.

1468
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:13,031
No one else can do the same.

1469
02:04:20,107 --> 02:04:21,734
Are you talking about yourself?

1470
02:04:31,585 --> 02:04:36,785
What if end up like aunty,
will you look after me?

1471
02:04:41,128 --> 02:04:42,323
Yes, I will.

1472
02:04:47,568 --> 02:04:53,200
If I get lost...
will you come looking for me?

1473
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:00,647
I Will.

1474
02:05:10,758 --> 02:05:12,089
You can go to Paris or anywhere...

1475
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:13,217
...just marry me before you do.

1476
02:05:31,178 --> 02:05:32,339
Charu aunty!

1477
02:05:43,157 --> 02:05:44,181
Tara!

1478
02:05:46,794 --> 02:05:47,693
Come on.

1479
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:01,735
Charu aunty! Charu aunty!

1480
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:11,484
Charu aunty, are you okay?

1481
02:06:12,152 --> 02:06:13,517
Paplu?
- Paplu's at home.

1482
02:06:14,021 --> 02:06:15,250
Paplu's at home.
- He's at home.

1483
02:06:17,091 --> 02:06:17,751
Let's go home,

1484
02:06:18,025 --> 02:06:19,117
Come, let's go home.

1485
02:06:19,326 --> 02:06:21,294
Charu aunty. Let's go home.

1486
02:06:47,554 --> 02:06:48,487
Paplu.

1487
02:06:54,595 --> 02:06:56,188
Come...come...come inside.

1488
02:06:57,731 --> 02:07:02,100
Thank God I found you Paplu,
or you would've been lost.

1489
02:07:02,169 --> 02:07:03,330
Then what about me?

1490
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:06,198
I am sorry, Baby...very sorry.

1491
02:07:06,573 --> 02:07:08,166
It won't happen again.

1492
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:54,681
You said something... in the car.

1493
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,548
It was true.

1494
02:08:04,298 --> 02:08:07,131
The last six months were
the best days of our lives.

1495
02:08:09,002 --> 02:08:10,970
Imagine what our entire life can be.

1496
02:08:14,408 --> 02:08:16,467
You can go anywhere you like,
just marry me before you do.

1497
02:08:19,446 --> 02:08:21,005
We'll figure out the rest.

1498
02:08:30,157 --> 02:08:31,420
Marriage?

1499
02:08:36,496 --> 02:08:37,429
Okay.

1500
02:08:44,638 --> 02:08:46,333
Marriage is for fools.

1501
02:08:49,009 --> 02:08:50,408
So let's be fools.

1502
02:08:55,015 --> 02:08:56,005
Okay, darling?

1503
02:08:58,285 --> 02:08:59,275
Okay, darling?

1504
02:09:00,621 --> 02:09:01,645
Okay, darling...
