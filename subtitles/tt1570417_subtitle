1
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,218
Now.

2
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,237
Cupid, cupid.
You're a real mean guy.

3
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,131
I like to clip you so
that you don't fly.

4
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,235
Come and cry in shame.

5
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,280
And I know that you
want it lame.

6
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,184
Hey! Set me free.

7
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,212
Cupid, cupid.
Stop picking on me.

8
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:12,054
I can't do my homework and
I can't get it straight.

9
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,218
I need them every moment
at this stage.

10
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,256
Come and act like
love sick pooch...

11
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,124
You will be carrying school...

12
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,260
Good morning, boys.

13
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,129
Morning.

14
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,073
This is your morning shots.
-Thanks.

15
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,144
And your little pinky.

16
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,114
And sir, this is specially for you.
-No, thanks.

17
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,185
No, thanks.
-You know, Sonam...

18
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,178
we don't touch medicines
like that.

19
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,121
Partners.

20
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,185
We need partners, Sonam.

21
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,220
Partners?

22
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:55,033
I think your partner is with me.

23
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,169
Yeah!
-Yes.

24
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,296
Here is your partner.

25
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,195
Naughty boys.

26
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,041
Come on. Hurry up. Quickly
hurry up your medicines.

27
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,168
Bye.

28
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,116
Good morning.
How is the game going?

29
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,241
Fine, thank you.
-Fine.

30
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,077
Medicine is very good.

31
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,113
Really, dear?

32
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,151
Is the medicine very good or she...
-Take.

33
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,219
Morning, girls. How are you?

34
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,129
Good morning.
-Fine, thank you.

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,132
Time for your medicines.

36
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,129
No, first joke.
-Yeah!

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,207
Yes, tell me.

38
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,244
When Navin, Dinyar's brother,
was on death-bed...

39
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,247
he called his son and said,
I want to give you something.

40
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,148
And he took out his gun.
-Son was disappointed.

41
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,048
He said, I don't want gun.

42
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,143
Give me your Rolex watch.

43
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,086
Father said, when I die...

44
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,148
you'll handle my business,
return home tired...

45
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,092
and when you find your wife
without another man in bed...

46
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,219
will you shoot him...

47
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,256
or show him your Rolex and say...

48
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,089
sir, your time is up.

49
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,227
You're too much. Come on quickly.

50
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,097
That was good.
-Thank you.

51
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,035
Welcome. And now it's time for
your medicine, Mrs. Walia.

52
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,271
I won't take medicine.
-Why?

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,139
I said no.

54
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,279
I've cure of that too.

55
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,054
Tina.
-Tinku...

56
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,060
What are you doing?
Madam had prohibited us.

57
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,129
Let it be. Nothing will happen.

58
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,123
Your medicine.

59
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,261
Thank you. That's more like it.

60
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,098
Come on, bottoms up!
-Cheers.

61
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,133
It will spill.

62
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,235
You'll be in trouble.
-Forget it. Nothing will happen.

63
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,045
Thank you.
-Thank you.

64
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,241
But...
-Come on. Let's go.

65
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,279
Sonam. -Yes.
-Mr. Sharma.

66
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,092
No, pal! Not again.

67
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,150
I'll handle it.

68
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,191
Mr. Sharma. Good morning.

69
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,067
It's done.
-Done?

70
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,129
It's done.
-Again?

71
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,267
Ok. Come on, Mr. Sharma.

72
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,235
Come on.
Take him along. I'll be there.

73
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,141
Good boy.

74
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,242
Come. Doctor is calling you.

75
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,238
I'm sorry, dad.

76
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,031
Doctors said that...

77
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,265
it can happen any time.

78
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,043
Today, tomorrow...

79
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,207
or day after.

80
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,049
Anytime.

81
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,060
Dad, I'm...

82
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,096
I'll phone office and
cancel my tickets.

83
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,178
Child, you've already extended
your leave twice.

84
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,244
You know how people are
losing jobs in America.

85
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,208
Look, child...

86
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,057
what has to happened
will happen here.

87
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,192
Now don't cancel your tickets.
You've to catch flight today.

88
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,033
You should reach airport
3 hours before time.

89
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,129
Get ready.

90
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,132
But dad...

91
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Child,
whatever that happens here...

92
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,209
I'll handle it.

93
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,164
What is this, child?

94
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,276
These are 2 open tickets
for New York.

95
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,154
Whenever you feel,
you can come there.

96
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,218
Child, what will I do there?

97
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,024
All that...

98
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,154
I'd was...

99
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,163
Now listen to me.

100
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,040
Keep these tickets.

101
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,171
I'll arrange the ticket
if I've to come there.

102
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,108
Now prepare to leave.

103
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,279
I know, dad...

104
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,150
but please, dad...

105
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,025
promise me...

106
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,090
you'll surely come to
New York to meet me.

107
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,195
Promise me please.

108
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,162
Ok, child.

109
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,283
Hello. Yes?

110
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,147
Yes, Sonam Chopra.

111
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,257
Yes, I'd applied for employment
visa. Yes, correct.

112
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,157
Really?

113
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,068
Yes. Ok. Monday.

114
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,301
Yes, I'll come for the
appointment. Yes.

115
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,135
References. Hospital references.

116
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,071
I'll get everything.
Thank you so much.

117
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,138
Thank you.

118
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,280
Sonam. -Tina!
-What happened?

119
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,060
Tell me. -I got a phone from
Red Cross in London.

120
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,129
There is call for visa on Monday.

121
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,764
And no formalities.
-I'm so happy.

122
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,260
You've done it.
Now you'll live in London.

123
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes.

124
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,170
Now I won't be a paying guest
in someone's bungalow.

125
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,108
So let's party tonight.
It's a weekend.

126
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,233
You'll party?

127
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,180
What will you drink? Orange juice.
And what do you eat?

128
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,242
Your favorite dish.
-Cottage cheese fritters.

129
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,206
That only.

130
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,083
You can't party, fool. Come on.

131
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,121
Let it be. If you were born
in Gujrati family...

132
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,215
you would've realized it.

133
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,056
Everything is a luxury beside snacks.
-Anyways...

134
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,162
finally on Monday I'll be free...

135
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,097
from this hell and that witch.

136
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,099
God!
-But will you get leave on Monday.

137
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,167
I mean, our witch likes you a lot.

138
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,162
That's true. Actually she was
deprived of love as a child.

139
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,007
If I go, she'll call you.
What do you say?

140
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,107
My God.

141
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,071
Morning, madam.

142
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,020
You're in a jolly mood today.

143
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,188
Madam, we gave medicines
to all the patients.

144
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,087
Everything is under control.

145
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,261
With you here everything
has to be under control.

146
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,094
Madam, actually I got...

147
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,167
a phone from London
Red Cross Society.

148
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,237
I've been selected.
-That's great. Congrats.

149
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,274
Thank you, madam. On Monday I've
been called for visa so...

150
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,077
I was wondering if
I could get a day off.

151
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,176
Of course. Why not?

152
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,173
But you've to come tomorrow.

153
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,148
Oldies will be happy to see
you on Sunday afternoon.

154
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,152
Tomorrow is Sunday, madam.

155
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,056
Why? Don't you like to come alone.

156
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,157
Ok, we'll call Tina too.

157
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,161
If she comes,
you'll get time to chat.

158
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,252
Right?

159
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,134
And if you come early morning...

160
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,137
I'll give you recommendation
letter too.

161
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,136
But come at 8 am.

162
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,070
Madam,
if I could get the letter today...

163
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,134
it would've been really great.
-Come on, Sonam.

164
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,279
You know how much I like you.

165
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,140
Right, Tina.
-Yeah.

166
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,076
For you I've to write a special
recommendation letter.

167
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,019
Give me some time to think,
Sweety.

168
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,180
Right? Yeah?
-Yeah, madam.

169
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,126
Ok, madam.
-See you tomorrow, girls.

170
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,054
Witch!

171
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,063
Sir, fill the form at reception.

172
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,149
Hey, Sid.
-Hey, dude. What's up?

173
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,851
Cool, man.

174
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,251
Is everything fine?
What about you?

175
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,244
Hi, handsome.
-Thanks, bro. See you later.

176
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,085
Enjoy.

177
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,022
Hey! Hi, babes.
-Hi!

178
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,219
Did you get it?
-Yes, I got it. Don't worry.

179
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,198
Hey, Sid.
-Hey, Jimmy.

180
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,259
Where were you, fool? Take this.

181
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,136
You'll get me trapped some day.
And don't worry. -No, pal.

182
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,238
Thank you.

183
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,199
Come on. Dance.

184
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,244
Hello, dear. My stuff.

185
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,214
Don't call me dear.
It sounds fraud.

186
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,104
Really?

187
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,119
Hi, baby.
-Get it out.

188
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,215
Got your stuff.

189
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,127
Sonam, rocks!

190
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,187
Hey, Sid. You know what?
-Yeah?

191
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,021
I've been selected in Red Cross.

192
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,157
Wonderful...
-Really?

193
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,093
I knew it.

194
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,136
And I'm very, very happy for you.

195
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,070
Yes,
this party is to celebrate it.

196
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,143
Hello, my cheese fritters.

197
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,111
Shut up! I'm cool.

198
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,012
No, you're a fool.

199
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,013
Give me a kiss. Come on.

200
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,220
Come on. Give me a hug now.
-She's cool.

201
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,057
Hi. Hi.

202
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,232
How are you?

203
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,062
Excuse me.
Please give me one ecstasy tablet.

204
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,259
Shut up! Is it your first time?

205
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,035
Call it pinky here, not ecstasy.

206
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,195
Yeah? So just say,
please give me a pinky.

207
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,198
Please give me a pinky.

208
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,038
Not to me, tell her.
She's my girl friend, Sonam.

209
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,201
Please her.
Make her feel like a goddess.

210
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,180
Sid. -On your knees.
-What are you doing?

211
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,115
Her higness is impressed.
-Idiot!

212
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,175
Please.
-Alright.

00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,226
Thank you.
-Love, wait.

216
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,259
What happened, love?
Why are you angry?

217
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,196
What should I get for you? Vodka?

218
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,265
Anything will do. Anything.

219
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,079

Lock it.

251
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,205
I'll be back.

252
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,094
Where is your car, babes?

253
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,036
Don't call me, babes. Understand?

254
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,264
Sorry, baby doll.

255
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,137
I'll kill you.

256
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,205
Please do that.

257
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,251
But not here. At your place.

258
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,119
Reach home, I'll be there.

259
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,247

Come.
-Bye.

261
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,155
Hey! Let me drive.

262
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,063
Why?

263
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,225
Because you're drunk.

264
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,229
Didn't you drink?

265
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,140
Orange juice is a drink too.

266
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,069
But Sonu, police is strict about
drunken-driving these days.

267
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,115
They put you behind
bars for 2 days.

268
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,246
Dear, nothing will happen.
Understand?

269
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,087
And you're with me. Come.

270
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,214
Come.
-But, Sonu...

271
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,082
Move, man.

272
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,051
Ok.

273
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,046
Do you remember we've to
come again at 8 am.

274
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,115
Yes, I remember.

275
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,245
But anyways,
this is your last week.

276
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,123
Chill!
-That's it.

277
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,234
Pull over. I'll get down here.

278
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,206
God!
-You can stay here.

279
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,238
Are you sure?

280
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,175
Think again.

281
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,175
Don't be stupid.

282
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,185
You're always welcome in my house.

283
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,079
But where will I sleep?

284
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,024
I've a sofa-cum-bed in my hall.

285
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,154
And when Sid comes at night...

286
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,029
on your sofa-cum-bed...

287
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,139
Will your parents object to that?

288
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,209
My God!

289
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,133
Sid is coming too.

290
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,279
My dear, go away.

291
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,206
You guys are wild.

292
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,117
But drive carefully.

293
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,121
Yes, madam.
-Don't get involve with cops.

294
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,125
These visa personnels are
worst witch than warden.

295
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,095
Witch! Witch!

296
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,167
If you say such words in
front of your house...

297
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,259
what will your family say?

298
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,071
Ok, fine. Go and let me go.

299
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,036
Ok, witch.
-But listen...

300
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,074
on visa interview day wear
deep neck T-shirt. -Ok.

301
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,203
Will this do?
-It'll do just fine.

302
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,241
Ok, bye.
-Bye. -Bye.

303
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,042

304
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,079

You go every week.

313
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,264
Yes. Every week. Every Saturday.

314
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,098
For my courier business...

315
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,075
God blessed me...

316
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,145

My wife is very close to God now.

322
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,099
She can directly ask Him
if she wants anything.

323
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,258
By the way, she...

324
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,263
was never a silent one.

325
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,194
I'm so sorry, sir.

326
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,036
But God is great, sir.

327
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,268
Any relative, sir.

May she be happy wherever she's.

Done, sir.

333
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,150
Hail lord Ganpati!

334
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,128
Yo, babes!
-Hi, Sid.

335
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,230
Don't call me babes.

336
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,274
I'm famished.
Get something to eat.

337
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,077
Eat me. I'm coming.

338
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,233
Shut up, Sid.

339
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,274
Please Sid, stop this nonsense.

340
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,208
Bring something to eat quickly.
-Ok, babes.

341
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,201
Hello. Hello.

342
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,207
Hello, babes. I can't hear you.

343
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,107
No!

344
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,065
Help!

345
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,040

346
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,079
Someone help!

347
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,191
God! What has happened?

348
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,093
The Vodaphone number you've called
is currently unavailable.

349
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,225
No! -The number you're
trying to contact.

350
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh, God! God!

351
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,099
Chameli, what are you doing?

352
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,098
I'm not Chameli, but Chanda, sir.

353
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,099
Whatever...

354
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,239
how many times I've told you
not to do business here.

355
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,166
Who does business these days, sir?

356
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,140
Why? Did you retire?

357
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,280
No, there is recession. Recession.

358
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,182
Hey, are you abusing me?

359
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,117
No.
Recession means market is down.

360
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,085
Hey, you're trying to teach me.

361
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,180
I'll slap you...

362
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,082
I swear, sir.

363
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,148
I've no money today.

364
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,261
Do you think I'm mad?

365
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,257
Sir.
-Do you think I'm mad?

366
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,157
Sir, that man is hanging
on the car. -Really?

367
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,033
So who is driving the car?
-I swear, sir. Look.

368
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,035
A man was hanging from that car,
sir.

369
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,107
Chameli, do you think I was
born yesterday? -Sir...

370
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,109
I swear. -Don't waste my
time. Give me money.

371
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,145
Give me money.

372
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,177
My God!

373
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,018
From where did you bring him?

374
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,081
I said, I found him at the
roadside in Charkop.

375
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,049
Charkop.

376
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,097
Give me your name and address.

377
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,093
Look, sir.
First start his treatment.

378
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,138
And why do you want my
name and address.

379
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,166
Sir, we need it.

380
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,100
If inquires takes place tomorrow...

381
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,112
you'll have to come
to police station.

382
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,083
Police is very strict in
druken-driving cases.

383
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,053
But I'm helping this man
for sake of humanity...

384
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,147
nothing else. Got it?
-I know.

385
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,082
You're going a good deed.

386
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,114
Very good deed.

387
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,023
But it's my duty.

388
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,218
I've to do it.

389
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,124
Give me your office address.

390
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,134
Don't get involve with cops.

391
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,102
This visa personnels are
worse witch than warden.

392
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,104
We'll come to your office for tea.

393
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,175
We won't ruin your reputation.

394
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,036
Maybe because of this
behaviour of yours...

395
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,139
a common man is scared
to help others.

396
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,227
Madam, what do you want?

397
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,257
I ran out of petrol.

398
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,157
Is there a petrol pump nearby?

399
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,065
Petrol?
-Yes. -Come.

400
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:29,062
That...
-No, come on. -But...

401
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,145
Come, madam.

402
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,045
Sir, I'll find it.
Thank you so much.

403
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,171
Madam, don't be tense.

404
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,050
Go straight and turn right
after 1.5 kilometers.

405
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,152
You'll find the petrol pump.
Get petrol filled.

406
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,112
Thank you.
-Mention not.

407
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,254
Thank you.
-Welcome, madam.

408
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,081
Hello, baby doll.

409
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,023
You didn't open the door for long.
Is someone else inside?

410
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,062
Whom were you busy with?
-Sid...

411
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,123
Baby.

412
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,227
What happened?
What's wrong with you? -Accident.

413
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,231
Accident?
-I'd an accident on Hill Road.

414
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,065
God!

415
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,234
No! What is this?
-Baby. -Blood.

416
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,046
Are you hurt? Show me.
-No.

417
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,181
Where did you get hurt?
-I didn't get hurt...

418
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,205
but that man did.
There will be police inquiry.

419
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,245
God!

420
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:31,255
Day after tomorrow is my visa call.
-Relax.

421
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,258
Take it easy. I'll do something.
-I'll just do something for you.

422
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,123
Just relax. I'll...

423
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,219
No, baby!
-Why did it happen to me?

424
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,219
Poor me...
-Cool it.

425
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,099
Just take it easy. Drink this.

426
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,226
Come on. Drink it.
You need this. -No.

427
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,038
Let's think with a calm mind.
Go on.

428
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,129
Yes.

429
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,065
Good girl.

430
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,144
Now tell me.

431
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,271
When, where and with whom did
you meet with an accident?

432
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,149
A man was crossing the road.

433
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,184
And my car knocked him.

434
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,120
Ok. A man was crossing the road.
-Yes.

435
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,122
He came under your car. And died?

436
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,118
I don't know.
-Did anyone see you there?

437
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,084
Did you tell anyone?

438
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,030
Then relax and just chill.
Stop crying.

439
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,226
There is no problem. When you
didn't say anything to anyone...

440
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,237
nobody saw anything,
then what is the problem.

441
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,264
No, that...
-what is the problem?

442
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,010
These people who walk and
sleep on road die daily.

443
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,235
Whose fault is it?

444
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,139
Sometime a rich man's spoilt
brat runs car over them...

445
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,051
or some star gets drunk
and kills them.

446
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,153
But does anything happen? Nothing.

447
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,054
Just chill, pal. -But Sid, I've
to go for visa tomorrow.

448
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,125
There will be police inquiry,
verification...

449
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,127
and they'll find out.
They'll get me.

450
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,095
What will the police do?

451
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,221
Sid, stop joking.

452
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,067
I'm not joking, baby. I'm serious.

453
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,035
Look at me. Come on. Take it easy.

454
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,042
One of my clients died because
of drug overdose 2 days ago.

455
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,007
Did you find out?
Did anyone find out?

456
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,044
So just relax, baby.

457
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,116
Relax...

458
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,116
-That man is in my car.
-Nothing will happen.

459
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,175
Nothing will happen.

460
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,079
You just need to take
this chill pill.

461
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,114
No.
-Take it. Yes.

462
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,161
Calm down. Calm down.

463
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,225
Look at me.

464
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,134
Just relax. Yes.

465
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,227
Yes, it's working.

466
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,166
Look at me. Only me.

467
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,067
Nothing will happen.
Everything will be fine.

468
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,135
Just relax.

469
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,110
Just relax, baby.

470
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,139
Just relax.

471
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,211
Just relax.

472
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,051
Sid.

473
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,222
Sid.

474
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,225
Sid.

475
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,095
Sid.

476
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,174
That man is still in the garage.

477
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,060
Sid.

478
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,141
No!

479
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:34,115
When he was asked,
he dodged it slyly...

480
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,059
and interview...
-2 cases have been filed.

481
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,095
Victim is hospitalized.

482
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,061
He's in serious condition.

483
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:45,262
A rich boy run over a 5 year
old boy with his BMW car.

484
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,162
Police says that driver was
driving under intoxication...

485
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,208
and had taken drug.

486
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,235
Right now he's under arrest.

487
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,244
And legal action is
taken against him.

488
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,172
Reavti Sharma for Live
news from Mumbai.

489
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,207
Because of strike of BEST,
common people are harassed.

490
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,246
BEST workers say...

491
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,154
they'll continue their strike
until their demands are met.

492
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,250
Now let us take you to
the street of Mumbai.

493
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,071
Good morning, Sonam.

494
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,185
Morning, Mr...
-Shetty.

495
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,245
You always forget my name.

496
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,054
And maybe you do it purposely.

497
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,152
Anyway,
what are you searching in the...

498
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,253
paper so ruffled
up in the morning?

499
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,202
Do you know what happened
in town last night?

500
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,237
Sharukh and Amir Khan met
in a dinner party.

501
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,239
They both are enemies.

502
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,280
Hey, your dog...
-Yes.

503
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,019
Not God, he's Rambo.
-Look I hate dogs.

504
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,060
Where is your dog going?
-Rambo. -Come, Rambo. Come.

505
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,216
He's very curious.

506
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,190
Sonam, if you don't mind,
can I say something.

507
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,034
You look too good early morning.

508
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,206
Thank you.

509
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,104
Sonam.

510
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,206
Bye. Rambo.

511
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,210
Come. Let me talk you for a walk.

512
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,082
Come. Come, Rambo.

513
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,119
Help me!

514
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,163
Leave me.

515
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,131
Please help me.

516
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,094
Help me!

517
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,263
I'll help you.

Yes, madam. Where to?
-Silver retreat.

00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,174
What?

537
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,134
You called a taxi to go nearby.

538
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,212
We get turn after spending
4 hours in queue.

539
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,182
And you just phone and
call the cab. -Shut up!

540
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,208
Drive.
-It's too much!

541
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,143
You ruined my day and
on top of that...

542
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,084
you abuse me in English.

543
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,257
It's too much!
God knows how they're...

544
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,061
You've a big bungalow, madam.
Didn't you buy a car?

545
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,098
Listen, mind your own business.
Ok?

546
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,030
I said, drive.

547
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,101
She has started in English again.

548
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,159
Yes, madam. I'll drive.

549
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,102
You don't want to go to moon.

550
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,230
It's a 10 minutes drive.

551
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,041
Thank you, God!

552
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,168
Thank you, God!

553
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,242
Madam, this honking sound is
coming from your garage.

554
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,149
My car is broken.

555
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,219
Ok, then I'll fix it.

556
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,993
No. Wait here.

557
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,223
I'll check the car.

558
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,125
Stay here.
-Ok, I too don't care.

559
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,036
I was just trying to help.

560
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,031
Look at her arrogance.

561
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,208
What are you doing? Stop it.

562
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,245
Stop it.

563
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,056
Stop it. Please.

564
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,250
Please stop honking.

565
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,188
Stop it.

566
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,200
Please help me.

567
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,102
Please. I need help.

568
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,139
Help me.

569
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:15,049
Yes. I promise...

570
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,117
I'll get a doctor.

571
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,109
I'll just get help.

572
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,180
I promise. Stop honking.

573
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,088
Please stop honking.

574
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,257
Stop it.

575
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,194
Stop it.

576
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,039
Stop it. Stop it.

577
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,168
Stop it.

578
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,261
I said stop it.

579
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,175
I said stop it.

580
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,090
Was it my fault that you came in
front of my car last night?

581
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,061
I said I'm getting help.

582
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,206
You?

583
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,131
What are you doing here?

584
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,266
You didn't return...

585
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,073
so I thought.
-My car broke down.

586
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,070
I'm coming. Go now.

587
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,207
I said go.

588
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,094
Today this game is mine.

589
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,120
I'll get it today.
Just wait and watch.

590
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,153
Tina.

591
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,166
Hey, listen!

592
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,091
Listen.

593
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,194
Listen to my joke.

594
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,227
My joke.

595
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,164
Listen, do you now a man's wife...

596
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,073
Please. Not today.

597
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,237
No, in Ram's temple...
-Madam, come inside.

598
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,048
My joke.
-I'll listen.

599
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,175
Come inside...
-Tina.

600
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,208
She left... -You're late.
You'd to come at 8 am.

601
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,051
Did the warden come?
-She...

602
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,090
She has asked thrice about
you since morning.

603
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:42,090
No!

604
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,126
Chill! I'll handle her.

605
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,060
Ok, listen.

606
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,223
I need your car this evening.

607
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,091
Car?

608
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,128
Why?
-My cousin Bhavin...

609
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,172
is going to teach
me driving today.

610
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,042
Tina, my car is broken down.
I took a cab.

611
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,042
No problem.

612
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,105
I'll tell him to take mechanic
to the garage.

613
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,117
But Tina...
-He'll return it in the evening.

614
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,119
I said I can't give
you the darn car.

615
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,176
Don't you get it?

616
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:27,032
Good morning, madam.
-Good morning, Sweety.

617
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,094
I'm sorry I'm late, madam.

618
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,231
My car broke down, madam.

619
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,075
It's ok. No problem. It's fine.

620
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,143
Madam, I found cab with difficulty
that's why I'm late.

621
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,077
God! Did you eat breakfast?

622
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,049
No, madam. I didn't get time.

623
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,210
I'm so sorry. Let us...

624
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,214
take breakfast.
What will you've?

625
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,150
Tea, coffee, juice or milk shake?

626
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,059
Madam, I was really in a big problem.

627
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,163
My car had an accident...

628
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,156
It's very badly bashed up.

629
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,223
God!

630
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,069
Poor you! Are you all right.

631
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,264
Madam, honestly. I'm not lying.

632
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,042
My car really met with
an accident and...

633
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,134
I got cab with difficulty.

634
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,041
That's why I got late.

635
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,137
Ok. Ok. I trust you.

636
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,271
I trust you.

637
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,139
Thank you, madam.

638
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,148
Sonam.

639
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,188
What should I write in your
recommendation letter? -What?

640
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:32,225
Should I write that Sonam Chopra
isn't a responsible girl?

641
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,059
Sorry, madam. But...

642
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,241
See, Sweety, I'm very sure, if
someone is late in Red Cross...

643
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,044
or doesn't show up,
he phones to inform...

644
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,046
that I'm not going to
be coming in today.

645
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,172
Or I'm going to be late.

646
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,272
Don't you think?

647
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,144
Phone?
-Yes, phone.

648
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,247
At least you should've phoned.

649
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:16,201
Phone?
Your lovely MMS enabled phone.

650
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,137
Where is it?

651
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,226
Mumbai police helpline.

652
01:42:29,178 --> 01:42:30,167
Drive.

653
01:46:48,337 --> 01:46:51,101
Help me.
-I'll be back.

654
01:46:51,306 --> 01:46:52,330
We appreciate your call.

655
01:46:53,175 --> 01:46:55,302
Currently all our operators
are busy.

656
01:46:57,146 --> 01:47:00,047
Madam, this honking sound is
coming from your garage.

657
01:47:02,317 --> 01:47:04,080
You? What are you doing here?

658
01:47:06,255 --> 01:47:08,052
Listen to my joke.

659
01:47:08,123 --> 01:47:09,317
I said I can't give
you the darn car.

660
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:14,061
See,
Sweety, I'm very sure if someone...

661
01:47:14,129 --> 01:47:15,221
comes late in Red Cross...

662
01:47:15,297 --> 01:47:17,162
or doesn't show up,
he at least...

663
01:47:17,266 --> 01:47:20,099
phones to inform that I'm not
going to be coming in today.

664
01:47:20,302 --> 01:47:22,327
Or I'm going to be late.
Don't you think?

665
01:47:27,276 --> 01:47:29,301
Hey! Hear the rest of the joke.

666
01:47:29,344 --> 01:47:32,040
Hear the rest of the joke.
Do you know what happened?

667
01:47:32,114 --> 01:47:34,082
After 3 days he returns
to Lord Ram.

668
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:36,117
He said, I'm coming for 3
days, where is my wife?

669
01:47:36,185 --> 01:47:38,244
Lord Ram said,
go to lord Hanuman's temple.

670
01:47:38,287 --> 01:47:40,084
He'd found my wife too.

671
01:47:40,155 --> 01:47:43,056
Hear my joke. Listen.

672
01:47:46,161 --> 01:47:48,288
Hey, look at this.

673
01:47:49,131 --> 01:47:51,156
A 6 year old boy swallowed a coin.

674
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:55,069
These kids are very smart.

675
01:47:55,337 --> 01:47:59,068
They know after growing up people
will swallow their money.

676
01:47:59,141 --> 01:48:01,132
That's why he took his share
in his childhood.

677
01:48:03,345 --> 01:48:06,041
I don't know what to do.

678
01:48:07,182 --> 01:48:10,242
There is something fishy
in that girl's garage.

679
01:48:11,153 --> 01:48:13,246
I could see fear on her face.

680
01:48:13,322 --> 01:48:15,051
Forget it.

681
01:48:15,123 --> 01:48:16,317
Why are you trying to
get into her mess?

682
01:48:17,092 --> 01:48:18,116
But that bed...

683
01:48:18,293 --> 01:48:19,282
There was blood.

684
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,091
Was your blood on the bed?

685
01:48:21,363 --> 01:48:24,059
No? Then don't be so tense.

686
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:25,292
Forget that useless nonsense.

687
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:28,167
Don't get involve in
unnecessary troubles.

688
01:48:29,137 --> 01:48:30,229
Heed my advice.

689
01:48:32,174 --> 01:48:34,335
Let's phone from public phone.
They won't know our name.

690
01:48:36,144 --> 01:48:39,307
Hey, did you renew your license?

691
01:48:40,315 --> 01:48:42,078
Tell me.

692
01:48:42,284 --> 01:48:45,082
Mumbai police helpline.
What's the matter?

693
01:48:47,289 --> 01:48:48,313
Hello.

694
01:48:48,357 --> 01:48:50,120
I'd an accident.

695
01:48:50,325 --> 01:48:52,054
Whose accident?

696
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:54,128
Hello.

697
01:48:54,196 --> 01:48:56,323

01:48:59,268 --> 01:49:00,326
With a car.

700
01:49:01,103 --> 01:49:02,127
Ok, where are you?

701
01:49:03,338 --> 01:49:05,101
I'm in the car.

702
01:49:05,274 --> 01:49:08,243
Car had an accident.
But where are you?

703
01:49:09,244 --> 01:49:10,268
I'm in the car.

704
01:49:11,246 --> 01:49:13,305
Car was involved in the accident.
You're in the car.

705
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:15,207
Were you driving the car?

706
01:49:16,184 --> 01:49:19,153
No, I was walking.
-You were walking on the road.

707
01:49:19,187 --> 01:49:21,155
You're in the car.
Car had an accident.

708
01:49:21,323 --> 01:49:23,086
What are you saying?

709
01:49:23,258 --> 01:49:25,123
Ok, what's the number of the car?

710
01:49:26,361 --> 01:49:29,159
Hello. Hello.

711
01:49:30,132 --> 01:49:32,066
Tell me the car number.

712
01:49:33,168 --> 01:49:34,226
Hello.

713
01:49:35,304 --> 01:49:38,171
Brother, my phone battery is down.

714
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,070
If you click snap and watch
videos whole day...

715
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:42,269
it will happen when you need it.

716
01:49:43,278 --> 01:49:45,075
Ok, what's the location?

717
01:49:46,181 --> 01:49:47,275
Location.

718
01:49:47,316 --> 01:49:49,216
Where did the accident take place?

719
01:49:52,287 --> 01:49:54,221
I don't know. I don't understand.

720
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,320
Where did you met
with an accident?

721
01:49:58,226 --> 01:49:59,284
On Hillroad.

722
01:50:00,062 --> 01:50:01,256
Ok. Where are you?

723
01:50:03,165 --> 01:50:04,291
I'm in the car.

724
01:50:05,067 --> 01:50:06,329
You'd told me that earlier.

725
01:50:07,269 --> 01:50:08,293
But where is the car?

726
01:50:10,305 --> 01:50:13,240
Hello.
-Car is in the garage.

727
01:50:14,176 --> 01:50:15,268
Garage?

728
01:50:15,344 --> 01:50:17,335
Dear, don't waste my time.

729
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:19,170
Where is the garage?

730
01:50:21,149 --> 01:50:24,141
I don't know. Help me please.

731
01:50:26,088 --> 01:50:28,147
First give me full information.

732
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:32,055
Hello. Hello.

733
01:50:37,165 --> 01:50:38,325
Thank God battery is down.

734
01:50:40,068 --> 01:50:41,262
Please help me.

735
01:50:42,270 --> 01:50:43,294
Please let me go.

736
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:48,269
Why are you doing this to me?

737
01:50:49,077 --> 01:50:50,135
I'm dying.

738
01:50:51,113 --> 01:50:53,343
Maybe you can't see but I'm dying.

739
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,241
Shut up!

740
01:50:56,118 --> 01:50:58,211
Because of you my life
is getting ruined.

741
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:01,346
Can't you see?

742
01:51:02,124 --> 01:51:04,058
Because of me?
-Yes.

743
01:51:08,063 --> 01:51:10,258
Please throw me on the road.

744
01:51:11,299 --> 01:51:14,063
Let me go.
I won't say anything to anyone.

745
01:51:14,102 --> 01:51:16,093
I won't tell the police anything.

746
01:51:16,104 --> 01:51:17,196
Let me go.

747
01:51:18,306 --> 01:51:20,240
Why should I trust you?

748
01:51:20,342 --> 01:51:24,278
You can't trust me.

749
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,244
I can't believe you.

750
01:51:33,155 --> 01:51:35,146
You can believe me.

751
01:51:36,258 --> 01:51:38,055
My life will be ruined.

752
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,091
I... I can't believe you.

753
01:51:43,098 --> 01:51:44,122
I can't believe you.

754
01:51:45,133 --> 01:51:46,293
Please let me go.

755
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:50,138
I'm dying. Maybe you...

756
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:52,263
You don't realize that I'm dying.

757
01:51:53,175 --> 01:51:55,143
I won't say anything to anyone.

758
01:51:56,278 --> 01:51:57,302
I won't tell the police...

759
01:52:08,156 --> 01:52:09,282
Take me to Malad.

760
01:53:02,077 --> 01:53:03,305
Give me cigarette.
You always delay.

761
01:53:03,345 --> 01:53:05,074
Sid.

762
01:53:06,348 --> 01:53:08,213
You?
-Sid.

763
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:14,281
What happened, babes?
-Sid.

764
01:53:48,256 --> 01:53:49,280
Uncle.

765
01:53:55,163 --> 01:53:56,221
Uncle.

766
01:53:58,233 --> 01:54:00,030
Son, call someone.

767
01:54:01,236 --> 01:54:03,227
Go and call someone.
-Yes, uncle.

768
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:17,115
What happened? Why are you crying?

769
01:54:17,319 --> 01:54:19,150
Darling, who is it?

770
01:54:23,225 --> 01:54:24,249
Who is that?

771
01:54:25,327 --> 01:54:27,318
Just a client.

772
01:54:29,164 --> 01:54:32,133
Client?
-Don't go. Please.

773
01:54:36,137 --> 01:54:37,229
Who are you?

774
01:54:38,073 --> 01:54:39,131
Who the heck is this?

775
01:54:39,207 --> 01:54:40,265
Listen to me.

776
01:54:41,142 --> 01:54:42,234
Who the hell is this?

777
01:54:43,078 --> 01:54:44,204
Who are you?
-Listen...

778
01:54:45,113 --> 01:54:47,138
Who the hell is this?
-Please sit.

779
01:54:47,215 --> 01:54:49,149
You'll get your turn too.
-What?

780
01:54:49,217 --> 01:54:51,242
Come in the evening.
It's my turn now.

781
01:54:54,089 --> 01:54:55,215
Witch!
-Sonam.

782
01:54:55,257 --> 01:54:57,316
No, Sonam. Don't do this.

783
01:54:58,126 --> 01:55:00,060
How dare you!
-Leave her.

784
01:55:00,295 --> 01:55:02,286
She'll die. Hello.

785
01:55:03,098 --> 01:55:06,158
Witch!
-No, okay throw her out.

786
01:55:06,334 --> 01:55:08,268
Get out. Get out, you witch!

787
01:55:09,104 --> 01:55:10,128
Get out.

788
01:55:18,313 --> 01:55:20,042
I'm very sorry, darling.

789
01:55:20,282 --> 01:55:21,306
Give me...
-What?

790
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:25,048
You...
-This evening, not now. I promise.

791
01:55:27,122 --> 01:55:28,111
Hey!

792
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,253
Where is it? -Come.
-I've work to do.

793
01:55:33,161 --> 01:55:35,129
Come quickly.
-Where?

794
01:55:36,331 --> 01:55:38,094
Where is it?

795
01:55:38,333 --> 01:55:40,096
Here.

796
01:55:41,102 --> 01:55:43,127
Inside this.
-Here?

797
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:51,136
Climb?

798
01:55:51,346 --> 01:55:53,280
I've so much work to do at home.

799
01:56:05,293 --> 01:56:07,022
How is it here?

800
01:56:14,069 --> 01:56:15,229
Sister, help me.

801
01:56:16,071 --> 01:56:17,231
Get me out of here.

802
01:56:18,139 --> 01:56:20,334
I'm coming. -Hurry.
-I'll get someone.

803
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,274
Ajju, come quickly.

804
01:56:28,116 --> 01:56:31,142
Hey, babes. Control, dear!

805
01:56:31,252 --> 01:56:33,117
Control. Control, dear.

806
01:56:33,154 --> 01:56:35,122
Control. Come on.
-My foot!

807
01:56:35,156 --> 01:56:37,147
Control please. Control.

808
01:56:38,259 --> 01:56:40,250
God!
-I told you she was a client.

809
01:56:40,362 --> 01:56:42,057
She came in and...

810
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,298
After taking drugs she fell here.
What do I do?

811
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:47,067
She fell down and stripped
herself...

812
01:56:47,135 --> 01:56:48,261
and slept on bed.

813
01:56:48,303 --> 01:56:51,067
Baby. I told you she was stoned.

814
01:56:51,106 --> 01:56:52,266
She felt hot,
so she undressed herself.

815
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:55,309
And she lie down. Don't you know
these doppers. -They're beggars.

816
01:56:56,144 --> 01:56:58,237
You think I'm mad.
-You think I'm bloody mad.

817
01:56:58,313 --> 01:57:00,076
Don't give me nonsense.

818
01:57:00,081 --> 01:57:02,072
I'm not giving you any nonsense.
Remember, Jimmy.

819
01:57:03,084 --> 01:57:05,109
He was roaming naked here when
he came out of bathroom.

820
01:57:05,153 --> 01:57:07,121
He was roaming naked.
Was it my mistake?

821
01:57:07,355 --> 01:57:09,255
Why didn't you answer your phone?
-Phone?

822
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:11,258
I've been trying to call
you for long. -Phone?

823
01:57:13,161 --> 01:57:14,321
There is no network, dear.

824
01:57:15,096 --> 01:57:16,154
Look, there is no network.

825
01:57:20,135 --> 01:57:23,070
Signal was busy or you were
busy with her. Tell me.

826
01:57:24,105 --> 01:57:25,265
Come on. Say nice things.

827
01:57:26,141 --> 01:57:29,076
First tell me, why are you so worried?
-What happened? Tell me.

828
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:30,270
That rogue...
-Who?

829
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:32,171
Didn't I tell you last night?

830
01:57:33,081 --> 01:57:36,141
The man I ran into is stuck
in my car's windscreen.

831
01:57:37,318 --> 01:57:38,285
No!

832
01:57:39,154 --> 01:57:41,122
I've a visa call day
after tomorrow.

833
01:57:41,289 --> 01:57:44,087
Cops... if police finds out
I'll never get my visa.

834
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:46,218
What is going to happen?
-Nothing will happen.

835
01:57:46,261 --> 01:57:48,126
What?
-Nobody will find out.

836
01:57:48,263 --> 01:57:51,130
I'll handle it. Ok? Just relax.

837
01:57:51,332 --> 01:57:53,266
Just relax, baby.
Nothing will happen.

838
01:57:53,301 --> 01:57:55,098
I'll handle everything.

839
01:57:55,136 --> 01:57:57,127
Nothing will happen.

840
01:58:00,075 --> 01:58:01,133
I'll see to it.

841
01:58:02,177 --> 01:58:03,337
Everything will be all right. Ok?

842
01:58:05,246 --> 01:58:07,339
Trust me.
Everything will be all right. Ok?

843
01:58:12,087 --> 01:58:14,146
Come.
Find it quickly. It was here.

844
01:58:15,256 --> 01:58:17,281
Here it's. Come quickly.

845
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:19,251
Let's phone your dad.

846
01:58:32,373 --> 01:58:35,069
Hello.
-Hello. Ajju's father.

847
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:36,334
Just a minute.

848
01:58:38,146 --> 01:58:39,204
There is call for you.

849
01:58:42,117 --> 01:58:44,244
Yes?
-Something has happened here.

850
01:58:44,285 --> 01:58:46,344
What happened?
Did municipal people come there?

851
01:58:47,122 --> 01:58:48,146
No.

852
01:58:48,289 --> 01:58:52,225
That... white bungalow nearby...
-What about it?

853
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:55,058
In that garage a man
is lying down...

854
01:58:55,263 --> 01:58:56,252
soaked in blood.

855
01:58:56,297 --> 01:58:57,321
He's stuck in car.

856
01:58:58,066 --> 01:58:59,090
Why did you go there?

857
01:58:59,134 --> 01:59:00,123
I didn't go there.

858
01:59:01,102 --> 01:59:03,127
Our Ajju went there to play.
-Yes.

859
01:59:03,338 --> 01:59:05,135
Then he took me along.

860
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:07,070
Is your son mad?

861
01:59:07,142 --> 01:59:09,269
Why did he go there?
Let me come at night.

862
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:11,305
I'll punish him...

863
01:59:12,113 --> 01:59:14,138
I think I should phone the police.

864
01:59:15,083 --> 01:59:16,209
I think he's going to die.

865
01:59:16,284 --> 01:59:19,276
Listen,
first worry about your husband.

866
01:59:20,088 --> 01:59:22,249
I brought you to city from dung.

867
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:25,316
Don't ruin my life again. Got it?

868
01:59:26,161 --> 01:59:28,152
Keep me away from police matters.

869
01:59:28,263 --> 01:59:30,288
Our house is already
on illegal plot.

870
01:59:31,132 --> 01:59:34,101
If police comes,
they'll first kick us out.

871
01:59:34,135 --> 01:59:35,295
Yes, that true.

872
01:59:36,237 --> 01:59:39,035
But he's in pain...

873
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,140
so I think if I inform
the hospital...

874
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:43,304
it will be good.

875
01:59:43,344 --> 01:59:47,246
Listen, can't you understand me?

876
01:59:47,315 --> 01:59:49,078
Sit at home quietly.

877
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:50,208
Put Ajju on line.

878
01:59:51,186 --> 01:59:52,278
Here.

879
01:59:53,087 --> 01:59:55,055
Hello, papa.
-Listen, son.

880
01:59:55,256 --> 01:59:59,352
I'll hit you with
your bat so bad...

881
02:00:00,094 --> 02:00:02,062
that it will break.

882
02:00:02,163 --> 02:00:03,289
Sit at home quietly.

883
02:00:03,364 --> 02:00:05,332
And don't move before evening.

884
02:00:05,333 --> 02:00:07,096
Got it? Hang up now.

885
02:00:20,081 --> 02:00:22,140
Will you help me?
-Yes, dear.

886
02:00:23,117 --> 02:00:24,243
If not me, who else?

887
02:00:31,259 --> 02:00:33,090
He's still stuck in the car.

888
02:00:33,194 --> 02:00:35,321
No problem.
Everything will be fine.

889
02:00:36,164 --> 02:00:38,257
I'm here. Ok?

890
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:41,290
Relax.

891
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,329
30. 40. 50. 60.

892
02:00:46,107 --> 02:00:48,170
Here...
-That's my place.

893
02:00:48,207 --> 02:00:49,270
God!

894
02:00:50,078 --> 02:00:51,238
Yes. Give me money.

895
02:00:51,346 --> 02:00:54,110
What will you do with
so much money?

896
02:00:54,148 --> 02:00:55,240
I'll go to America.

897
02:00:57,218 --> 02:00:59,277
40. 50. 60. 70. Yes.

898
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:03,052
Ok, your turn.

899
02:01:09,163 --> 02:01:10,289
Sid, hurry up.

900
02:01:11,099 --> 02:01:14,068
Chill. Let it to me and relax.

901
02:01:14,335 --> 02:01:17,304
I've handled many such cases. Relax.
-God.

902
02:01:55,243 --> 02:01:57,211
I'm sure you didn't eat
anything since morning.

903
02:01:58,112 --> 02:01:59,136
Please have something.

904
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:12,126
Thanks.
-Anything for you, love.

905
02:03:57,098 --> 02:04:01,262
Dad. Can we get what we wish for?

906
02:04:05,273 --> 02:04:06,297
Sure, child.

907
02:05:41,102 --> 02:05:42,126
Promise me, dad.

908
02:05:43,304 --> 02:05:45,272
You'll come to New
York to meet me.

909
02:07:02,316 --> 02:07:04,284
God! What the hell is this?

910
02:07:05,052 --> 02:07:07,111
Please help me. -No!
-Did you see him?

911
02:07:08,255 --> 02:07:09,279
He's alive.

912
02:07:10,057 --> 02:07:11,285
That's what I said.
-No!

913
02:07:11,325 --> 02:07:13,316
You said he's stuck in
the car and he's dead.

914
02:07:14,328 --> 02:07:15,352
He was stuck in the car.

915
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:17,256
I don't know how he got here.

916
02:07:17,298 --> 02:07:19,232
What do you mean?
He came out as he's alive.

917
02:07:21,202 --> 02:07:22,294
No! He's moving. See.

918
02:07:26,307 --> 02:07:28,104
Hey! Stop it.

919
02:07:28,309 --> 02:07:29,298
What are you doing?

920
02:07:29,343 --> 02:07:31,243
Have you gone mad? Are you crazy?

921
02:07:31,312 --> 02:07:33,075
What do you want to do?

922
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,238
What are you doing?

923
02:07:37,284 --> 02:07:39,081
Sonam.
-That's why I brought you here.

924
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,049
To deal with him.

925
02:07:41,255 --> 02:07:43,155
Come on. Just relax.

926
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:45,121
He's an alive person.

927
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:46,319
He's a moving alive man.

928
02:07:47,294 --> 02:07:49,091
That's the problem.

929
02:07:50,064 --> 02:07:52,055
He has seen me. He recognizes me.

930
02:07:52,166 --> 02:07:54,100
If he says anything to anyone,
it's over.

931
02:07:54,135 --> 02:07:55,227
I'm finished. It's gone.

932
02:07:56,303 --> 02:07:58,271
So what should I do?
What do you want?

933
02:08:00,274 --> 02:08:02,299
Kill him! Kill him!

934
02:08:03,244 --> 02:08:04,302
Hello, take it easy.

935
02:08:05,246 --> 02:08:07,214
You ran into him and
I should kill him.

936
02:08:08,182 --> 02:08:11,276
Ok? You act like a big goon.

937
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:13,347
I play with guns.

938
02:08:14,155 --> 02:08:15,281
I've killed so many people.

939
02:08:16,123 --> 02:08:17,147
What happened now?

940
02:08:17,324 --> 02:08:19,155
That's my business.

941
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,228
I take money.
I charge a lot of money.

942
02:08:22,096 --> 02:08:24,064
Will you take money from me?

943
02:08:24,365 --> 02:08:26,265
It's your problem. Not mine.

944
02:08:27,068 --> 02:08:28,262
I came to help you and you...

945
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:31,331
I didn't know...
what should I do now?

946
02:08:34,308 --> 02:08:37,106
God! What a mess!

947
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:40,247
What are you doing?
Whom are you calling?

948
02:08:40,347 --> 02:08:43,111
Hello, I'm Sonam Chopra.

949
02:08:43,284 --> 02:08:46,276
Last night I'd an accident.
I ran over a man.

950
02:08:47,121 --> 02:08:48,281
My boyfriend was also with me.

951
02:08:49,123 --> 02:08:50,147
His name is Siddharth.

952
02:08:50,224 --> 02:08:51,213
He's a drug dealer.

953
02:08:51,292 --> 02:08:53,089
And he has killed 4 men.

954
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:55,151
Just stop it. Are you mad?

955
02:08:56,163 --> 02:08:58,290
You got scared? Didn't you?

956
02:09:00,134 --> 02:09:04,070
If you don't help me,
I'll really make the call.

957
02:09:04,171 --> 02:09:06,139
Shut up! First you dash someone...

958
02:09:06,173 --> 02:09:07,265
then blackmail me.

959
02:09:07,308 --> 02:09:09,037
Help me.

960
02:09:10,111 --> 02:09:11,271
God! Make him quiet.

961
02:09:12,279 --> 02:09:13,303
I should do that too.

962
02:09:15,349 --> 02:09:17,078
Do something.

963
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:27,088
No!

964
02:09:58,359 --> 02:10:00,122
Done.

965
02:10:01,095 --> 02:10:02,153
Now what?

966
02:10:02,263 --> 02:10:04,254
Let me think.
-What's there to think?

967
02:10:05,266 --> 02:10:06,324
Kill him. Finish him.

968
02:10:07,234 --> 02:10:09,225
Just cool it.
Is it so easy to kill someone?

969
02:10:10,070 --> 02:10:12,300
Is it like opening a beer bottle?

970
02:10:13,140 --> 02:10:15,074
He's a person...

971
02:10:15,142 --> 02:10:16,200
who is alive.

972
02:10:17,178 --> 02:10:19,339
Don't forget he has seen you too.

973
02:10:20,247 --> 02:10:21,305
And he recongnizes you.

974
02:10:21,348 --> 02:10:23,111
Whomever he has seen...

975
02:10:24,084 --> 02:10:25,142
has to die.

976
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,312
Or else whom he has seen...

977
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:29,089
has to be killed. That's it.

978
02:10:31,091 --> 02:10:32,115
Hi.

979
02:10:36,163 --> 02:10:38,131
My God! What happened?

980
02:10:39,099 --> 02:10:41,067
What's going on here?

981
02:10:41,268 --> 02:10:42,292
What happened?

982
02:10:43,103 --> 02:10:44,127
Sonam had an accident.

983
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:46,102
What? How?

984
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:48,233
After dropping you,
while returning home...

985
02:10:48,342 --> 02:10:51,175
she took right turn and
met with an accident.

986
02:10:51,278 --> 02:10:53,041
But are you fine?

987
02:10:53,113 --> 02:10:55,138
She's fine.
Nothing has happened to her. Look.

988
02:10:55,282 --> 02:10:56,340
But the car got ruined.

989
02:10:57,251 --> 02:11:00,243
But who was it? How did it happen?

990
02:11:04,325 --> 02:11:06,122
Come with me.
-My...

991
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,251
Come, I'll tell you everything.
But don't tell anyone.

992
02:11:08,329 --> 02:11:10,297
Yes, I won't say.
-Come. -I swear.

993
02:11:11,098 --> 02:11:13,157
Tell me.
-Come, I'll tell you.

994
02:11:31,318 --> 02:11:34,287
Give me a place in your heart.

995
02:11:35,322 --> 02:11:38,052
Make me yours.

996
02:11:38,125 --> 02:11:41,094
Hello. The building collapsed.
Then buy the rubbles.

997
02:11:42,096 --> 02:11:44,257
Yes. I don't you not to invest
in real estate. Hello.

998
02:11:45,165 --> 02:11:48,134
Not to you. Listen. Rambo, stop.

999
02:11:48,335 --> 02:11:51,099
I'm not talking to you.
Listen to me.

1000
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:52,229
I'll call you later.

1001
02:11:53,073 --> 02:11:54,131
Yes, invest 10 million.

1002
02:11:58,345 --> 02:12:00,108
Was anyone hurt badly?

1003
02:12:02,082 --> 02:12:03,344
Actually Sonam was driving.

1004
02:12:04,351 --> 02:12:06,080
It was totally dark.

1005
02:12:07,288 --> 02:12:09,256
She couldn't see when he
suddenly came in front.

1006
02:12:09,323 --> 02:12:11,120
Who?
-Cow.

1007
02:12:12,126 --> 02:12:14,219
What?
-Cow's baby.

1008
02:12:15,329 --> 02:12:17,320
What? You ran over a calf.

1009
02:12:18,132 --> 02:12:19,121
Are why serious?

1010
02:12:23,070 --> 02:12:24,298
She knocked it.
It wasn't her fault.

1011
02:12:25,172 --> 02:12:27,140
What could she do if he
came in the front?

1012
02:12:27,174 --> 02:12:28,232
Are you mad?

1013
02:12:28,342 --> 02:12:30,139
You knocked a calf.

1014
02:12:30,344 --> 02:12:32,141
Do you know how unlucky it's?

1015
02:12:32,346 --> 02:12:35,110
You mean to say she shouldn't
have run over a calf.

1016
02:12:35,182 --> 02:12:37,241
It would've been fine if
she'd knocked a man.

1017
02:12:38,152 --> 02:12:41,087
Don't you know cow is so pure.

1018
02:12:41,255 --> 02:12:42,313
You should've driven properly.

1019
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:45,081
What should we do now?
It has happened? -Meaning?

1020
02:12:46,293 --> 02:12:48,261
What are you thinking?
-What is there to think?

1021
02:12:49,296 --> 02:12:52,060
If we throw him out,
people's sentiment will be hurt.

1022
02:12:52,299 --> 02:12:54,062
Then?
-Well...

1023
02:12:55,102 --> 02:12:57,229
we've thought...

1024
02:12:58,105 --> 02:13:00,335
to cut the calf in pieces
and drown them in ocean.

1025
02:13:01,141 --> 02:13:02,233
Fishes will thank you.

1026
02:13:02,309 --> 02:13:05,073
And you'll help us in this work.

1027
02:13:05,145 --> 02:13:06,305
No. Not me.

1028
02:13:07,247 --> 02:13:09,112
Not me. Are you mad?

1029
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:12,251
I can't cut a calf.
-We'll hurry up...

1030
02:13:12,252 --> 02:13:14,049
we'll cut into small pieces.
-No.

1031
02:13:14,154 --> 02:13:15,246
No.
-Wait. -No.

1032
02:13:15,322 --> 02:13:16,311
Please wait.

1033
02:13:17,057 --> 02:13:19,252
Wait for a second.
How can you leave us alone?

1034
02:13:20,094 --> 02:13:22,153
Bhavin is waiting for me.
We're going to get ice-cream.

1035
02:13:23,063 --> 02:13:24,121
Where is Bhavin waiting?

1036
02:13:24,298 --> 02:13:25,322
On the road outside.

1037
02:13:26,166 --> 02:13:27,292
I think he smokes.

1038
02:13:28,102 --> 02:13:29,126
This is very wrong.

1039
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,228
I'll phone you.

1040
02:13:31,305 --> 02:13:32,329
I'll call you later.

1041
02:13:32,373 --> 02:13:34,307
Ok. But take care.

1042
02:13:35,142 --> 02:13:36,268
To cut a cattle...

1043
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:39,040
I'll call you later.
-Ok, bye.

1044
02:14:51,318 --> 02:14:54,287
Shall I kill you?
-What is wrong with you?

1045
02:14:55,255 --> 02:14:57,314
What are you doing?
-Not you, but him.

1046
02:15:02,262 --> 02:15:04,253
What happened?
-It will make sound.

1047
02:15:05,165 --> 02:15:07,133
Everyone will hear it?
-So what should we do?

1048
02:15:07,301 --> 02:15:10,099
Let's wait for the night.

1049
02:15:11,071 --> 02:15:12,299
It'll be easy to get him out.

1050
02:15:15,109 --> 02:15:16,133
No!

1051
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:18,039
Who came at this time?

1052
02:15:20,314 --> 02:15:22,145
Go. Check.

1053
02:15:29,256 --> 02:15:31,121
Listen, this isn't right.

1054
02:15:32,359 --> 02:15:34,156
Excuse me.
-What's going on?

1055
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:38,321
Meaning?
-What's going on in your garage?

1056
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:41,096
What happened?

1057
02:15:41,235 --> 02:15:43,032
There is blood in your garage.

1058
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:46,331
What's going on in your garage?

1059
02:15:47,141 --> 02:15:49,075
Blood? Blood?

1060
02:15:49,243 --> 02:15:51,074
My Rambo entered your garage.

1061
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:54,104
Do you know that?

1062
02:15:55,082 --> 02:15:57,209
Listen, I've told you many times...

1063
02:15:57,251 --> 02:15:59,082
to control your dog.

1064
02:16:00,154 --> 02:16:02,281
Don't be angry. A mouse...

1065
02:16:04,091 --> 02:16:06,252
There is mouse in your garage
and you're getting angry.

1066
02:16:07,161 --> 02:16:08,253
Listen...

1067
02:16:09,096 --> 02:16:10,154
Shall I tell you something?

1068
02:16:10,297 --> 02:16:12,288
Go for pest control. Yes.

1069
02:16:13,233 --> 02:16:15,030
I've told you this many times.

1070
02:16:15,169 --> 02:16:16,227
Mouse will die.

1071
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:19,205
My Rambo won't enter the garage.
Ok?

1072
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:27,338
Boy friend.
-No, boy friend's father.

1073
02:16:28,215 --> 02:16:29,239
Hello, uncle.

1074
02:16:30,083 --> 02:16:31,277
Any problem.
-No, uncle.

1075
02:16:31,318 --> 02:16:33,286
Want chocolate.
-Thank you. -Cold drink.

1076
02:16:34,087 --> 02:16:35,349
No. -Get lost.
-Ok.

1077
02:17:28,342 --> 02:17:30,071
Sid.
-Yes.

1078
02:17:31,245 --> 02:17:32,303
It's night, Sid.

1079
02:17:38,118 --> 02:17:41,212
Do you really want to kill him?

1080
02:17:42,356 --> 02:17:44,085
Not me...

1081
02:17:46,293 --> 02:17:48,261
but you'll kill him.
-Me?

1082
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:05,278
Ok. Ok.
-But, Sid.

1083
02:18:07,114 --> 02:18:08,138
What's the plan?

1084
02:18:09,082 --> 02:18:10,106
It's simple.

1085
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:15,048
First of all, I'll go to my car.

1086
02:18:16,156 --> 02:18:18,056
I'll take petrol from my car.

1087
02:18:19,126 --> 02:18:21,151
And then I'll enter the garage.

1088
02:18:24,298 --> 02:18:26,061
Then?
-Not much.

1089
02:18:32,139 --> 02:18:33,128
I'll shot him thrice.

1090
02:18:34,107 --> 02:18:35,301
And the sound of the bullets?

1091
02:18:38,178 --> 02:18:39,145
My baby!

1092
02:18:41,148 --> 02:18:43,082
You're so smart.

1093
02:18:47,321 --> 02:18:48,310
Ok.

1094
02:18:50,157 --> 02:18:51,215
I'll use this pillow.

1095
02:18:51,291 --> 02:18:53,259
I'll fire with pillow around it.

1096
02:18:54,194 --> 02:18:56,128
I'll pump 4 bullets in his brain.

1097
02:18:56,263 --> 02:18:57,287
And in 5 minutes...

1098
02:18:57,331 --> 02:18:59,162
we'll take his body out.

1099
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:19,084
Cheers. Bottoms up.

1100
02:19:20,354 --> 02:19:22,083
Come on.

1101
02:19:27,327 --> 02:19:28,316
Ok.

1102
02:19:31,064 --> 02:19:32,053
Sid.

1103
02:19:43,243 --> 02:19:44,232
Don't worry.

1104
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:36,152
Rogue.
Because of people like you...

1105
02:20:37,297 --> 02:20:39,265
people like me lose
their morality.

1106
02:22:30,110 --> 02:22:31,134
No!

1107
02:22:31,311 --> 02:22:32,335
What is Sid doing?

1108
02:22:45,158 --> 02:22:46,216
Sid.

1109
02:22:50,263 --> 02:22:51,252
Sid.

1110
02:23:21,294 --> 02:23:22,283
Sid.

1111
02:23:39,079 --> 02:23:40,103
Sid.

1112
02:23:54,294 --> 02:23:55,283
Rogue!

1113
02:23:56,262 --> 02:23:58,253
Rogue! You rogue!

1114
02:23:59,132 --> 02:24:00,224
Where are you?

1115
02:24:01,067 --> 02:24:02,261
Where are you?

1116
02:27:01,114 --> 02:27:03,139
I'm so sorry.

1117
02:27:03,316 --> 02:27:05,079
So sorry, baby.

1118
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,800
Subtitles: Arigon

1119
02:28:49,289 --> 02:28:50,347
No, Sid.

1120
02:28:51,124 --> 02:28:52,284
Please help me.

1121
02:28:53,159 --> 02:28:54,319
Why?
-Help me.

1122
02:28:55,128 --> 02:28:56,152
Why should I help you?

1123
02:28:57,297 --> 02:28:59,060
I want to live.

1124
02:29:00,066 --> 02:29:03,035
I want to live.

1125
02:29:03,169 --> 02:29:05,137
And what was I asking for?

1126
02:29:06,172 --> 02:29:08,072
That's what I was telling you.

1127
02:29:08,107 --> 02:29:09,267
I got scared.

1128
02:29:11,311 --> 02:29:13,211
I got scared.

1129
02:29:15,281 --> 02:29:18,079
You're scared to save
someone's life.

1130
02:29:19,085 --> 02:29:21,053
But to thrash an innocent person...

1131
02:29:21,087 --> 02:29:24,284
to kill him doesn't scare you.

1132
02:29:26,125 --> 02:29:28,059
What are you made up of?

1133
02:29:28,294 --> 02:29:30,057
I hate myself.

1134
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:33,299
I'm really sorry.
I hate myself. Help me.

1135
02:29:34,267 --> 02:29:36,235
I never raised my hand on anyone.

1136
02:29:37,337 --> 02:29:39,100
Not even on my daughter.

1137
02:29:39,272 --> 02:29:40,330
I'm like your daughter.

1138
02:29:41,274 --> 02:29:44,209
Like your daughter. No.

1139
02:29:45,144 --> 02:29:46,236
I hate myself.

1140
02:29:49,082 --> 02:29:50,242
No. No.

1141
02:29:56,122 --> 02:29:58,090
No. No.

1142
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:02,286
No.

1143
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:09,200
No. No!

1144
02:30:12,105 --> 02:30:14,130
You're not like my daughter.

1145
02:30:15,174 --> 02:30:17,142
You can never be like her.

1146
02:30:18,177 --> 02:30:20,168
Now police will decide
what to do with you.

1147
02:30:22,281 --> 02:30:24,215
You rogue!

1148
02:30:37,096 --> 02:30:39,064
Help me! Help me!

1149
02:30:47,140 --> 02:30:48,232
Help me!

1150
02:31:28,247 --> 02:31:30,147
Uncle! Uncle!

1151
02:31:31,150 --> 02:31:33,209
Uncle, get up! Uncle.
