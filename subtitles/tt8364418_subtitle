1
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,334
Greetings, brother. Come...

2
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,433
It's 12:01. You are late by a minute.
I can't open as you wish.

3
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,534
Move away.
The government trusts you.

4
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:07,400
Why this delay?
We've been waiting since dawn.

5
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,367
Hey, move away. Move.

6
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,434
I can open only, if I go inside.

7
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:16,167
Don't open the bar...

8
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,132
Don't shut the public...

9
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,334
Don't open the bar...

10
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:28,466
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

11
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:29,133
What about them?

12
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,500
Don't care them. You go ahead.

13
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:30,901
You wait.

14
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't shut the public...

15
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:40,933
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

16
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,466
You wait. Paraman boss has come.

17
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,868
Don't shut the public...

18
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,299
You leave. He's the bar owner.

19
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,667
Don't shut the public...

20
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:49,366
Will you close the shop
and the bar immediately?

21
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,701
Or you want us to immolate?

22
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,067
Take it. Take...

23
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:53,474
Immolate yourself and die.

24
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,534
You can't do anything,
no matter how many of you immolate.

25
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,167
Go and concentrate
on your studies.

26
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,844
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

27
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,267
Boss, the count of college students
is increasing.

28
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,007
They'll be submissive
only if we hit them.

29
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,199
Shall I call our clan?

30
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,901
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

31
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:09,299
Hey, our guys work for us
only for money.

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,299
Police also works for us
for money.

33
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,166
If we thrash, it's unlawful.

34
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,443
If they thrash,
It's law and order.

35
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,467
Leave it. Let's see.

36
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:19,534
Tell me, Paraman...

37
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:21,366
What sir,
again these college students?

38
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:22,487
Wait... I will look at that.

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,333
Today is Sunday.

40
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:27,076
The inauspicious time is
between 4.30 to 6pm.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,740
But the phone rings
in the morning itself.

42
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:29,968
No...

43
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:31,868
K4 police station.

44
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,567
Ramdass... sir,

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,310
The college students are creating
ruckus at Paraman's wine shop.

46
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,367
Check and convey the status
to me immediately.

47
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,633
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

48
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:41,334
Greetings, Paraman...

49
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,334
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

50
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,100
What is this? Tell...

51
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,133
A mob. Tell...

52
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,067
Wait, I will talk to them.

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,499
500 metres away is a must.

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,610
Listen, dear college students.
Are you following the law?

55
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:49,967
500 metres away is a must.

56
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,032
Wait for a second.

57
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:51,734
Are you following the law?

58
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:52,833
Wait, just for a second.

59
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,033
Be calm.

60
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,466
Dear students,

61
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,199
Sir, ask the Inspector to come.

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,467
We both are in the same attire.

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Ask the person to come
who has stars in his attire.

64
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:08,500
What?

65
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,300
Sir, the situation is getting worse.

66
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,600
The bar council members of
the bar are enraged.

67
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:15,601
Who are you talking about?

68
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:17,534
Sir, I'm talking about the drunkards.

69
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,801
The college students are
more furious than them.

70
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,366
I came here to buy a car
for my daughter.

71
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,266
SI Chandran has gone to the court.

72
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,467
Is there anyone
who can solve the problem?

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,033
Sir, a person is there.

74
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,901
Who?

75
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,500
A youth for the youth.

76
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:33,534
Aah...

77
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,301
He will set things right
with his speech.

78
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,801
Ramdass, don't tense me.

79
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,534
The newly joined
"Crime branch Sub-Inspector, Subash".

80
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,933
Hey, it's only been four days
since he joined.

81
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,614
Will he solve the problem?
Definitely sir.

82
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,901
Okay, ask him to solve it.

83
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,199
500 metres away is a must.
Are you following the law?

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,233
(crowd shouting)

85
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:58,066
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

86
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:58,801
Hey, give that.

87
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,066
Tell...

88
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:00,968
Pour it.

89
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:07,067
Don't shut the public...

90
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,499
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,999
Hey, give the torch.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,701
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

93
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:25,934
Don't shut the public...

94
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:35,067
Hey, throw that.

95
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,333
Whether to study or to take spirit?
Tell...

96
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,834
All be quiet.

97
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,700
We'll find a better solution.

98
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,801
We stayed quiet till now.

99
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:08,366
As you didn't take any decision,
we are protesting.

100
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,276
If some problems get solved
only by protesting...

101
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,133
then, we have to protest.

102
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,133
I don't deny.

103
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:14,533
But, you should protest
without any hindrance to the public.

104
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,567
That's why,
we're protesting on a Sunday.

105
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,566
What's your problem?

106
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:22,634
Sir, the wine shop next to our college
must be shifted somewhere else.

107
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:26,267
We can't bear the comments
of the drunkards when we pass by.

108
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:27,643
We've complained many times.

109
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:28,367
Nothing has happened.

110
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:30,467
We won't leave unless
we get a solution.

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,533
If you want us to self-immolate,
for taking a decision,

112
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,894
then, we are ready for that too.

113
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,033
Who?

114
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,434
Who said that?

115
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:36,968
It's me.

116
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:38,700
Did you?

117
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:39,701
Come.

118
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,373
You must not immolate yourself.

119
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,667
You have to set this bar
and shop on fire.

120
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,601
Very nice.

121
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,299
Sir has told you.

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,366
Disperse the crowd and clear out.

123
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,801
He is telling...

124
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,666
Go and look after your studies.
Go...

125
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,934
I told you to study not to hit.

126
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,833
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Hey, where are you going?

127
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:03,967
(Crowd screaming and instructing)

128
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,868
Control room...

129
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,901
I wonder what to convey
to the inspector.

130
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:15,766
Hey, were you trained to be a policeman
or worked in a construction company?

131
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:16,467
What's this?

132
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,567
They've thrashed
the entire shop.

133
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,100
Did you go there to
protect the students?

134
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,967
If you had thrashed
at least four people...

135
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,033
only their footwear
would've been left.

136
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,427
No one would've
dared to stay back.

137
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,510
We can't chase them away with a stick,

138
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:31,700
It's not the crowd who has come
for Rs.250, a quarter of booze and biryani,

139
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,634
like the politicians clan,
to run away.

140
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,467
Students!

141
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:37,968
They won't run, sir.

142
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,467
They protested on a holiday
to avoid hindrance to the public.

143
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:45,334
There may be a future IAS, IPS...

144
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:48,867
Even a prospective minister might be there
in that group.

145
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,266
What the students did was wrong.

146
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:51,677
They must have been left to immolate.

147
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,367
Self-immolation is against law.

148
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,307
That's why I stopped them.

149
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:56,868
Police flair is new to him.

150
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,433
So, he is not aware
of our preferences.

151
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,500
Everything will be right
if his attire dries a bit.

152
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:04,567
For all the praise,
this is what I get.

153
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,166
Sir, this is named beat.

154
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,199
We must stand here the whole day.

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,934
Protection for paraman's bar.

156
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,366
It's like punishment for us...

157
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,300
and also consoling paraman.

158
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
They've come.

159
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,133
Come, the fuel boy...

160
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:18,734
Why is sir standing here?

161
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,601
Don't know dude.

162
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,300
Greetings, sir.

163
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,734
What?

164
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:21,933
Sir, why are you here?

165
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:25,800
He is in duty here
as he saved you.

166
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,967
Sir, our college students
want to meet you.

167
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,834
Why? Are you going to thrash
any shop there?

168
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:30,534
Why?

169
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,534
Please, come sir.

170
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,934
You don't stand here, sir.

171
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,400
Our college is very near.

172
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,266
A small treat in the canteen, sir.

173
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,499
Treat? Come sir. Please.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,934
Please come, sir.

175
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:38,968
Okay, you leave. I'll come.

176
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,067
Oh... okay.

177
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,033
Sir, how long to stand
in this hot sun?

178
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,700
The students are inviting us.

179
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,767
We'll go and enjoy the treat.

180
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,900
"Give and take respect,
be oblivious and bear,."

181
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,733
"It's a nice ballad
which graces him,."

182
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,500
"If you don't sing
along with us,."

183
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,968
"The jar and the pair,
and the gruel,."

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,900
"Using the tiffin box lid
as the snare drums,."

185
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,933
"If you don't dance
along with him,."

186
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:33,801
"He is the James Bond
who threatens with the pistol,"

187
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:37,533
"I'll strip off your skin,
if you do hooliganism."

188
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:40,968
"The self-luminous star, who stands
for Justice, honesty and integrity."

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,766
"I'll find out the crook
and break his leg."

190
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:48,334
"Move away, move away,
he is the police scamp."

191
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:57,534
"He'll shatter you,
better run away."

192
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:31,701
"If you speak abash,
with a strap knife."

193
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:35,333
"I'll pierce you with
a bullet on forehead."

194
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,833
"If you plan with sketches drawn,"

195
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,567
"I'll beat with hard stick
and take you to the courtroom."

196
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,200
"The don and forefathers of don,
will tremble when looking at him."

197
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:49,800
"The politicians panic at him,."

198
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:53,400
"He is a joyful person,
If get caught, we are compassed."

199
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:56,834
"The procurers will be gutted here."

200
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,032
"Give and take respect,
be oblivious and bear,."

201
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,868
"It's a nice ballad
which graces him,."

202
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,734
"If you don't sing
along with us,."

203
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,199
"The jar and the pair,
and the gruel,."

204
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,100
"Using the tiffin box lid
as the snare drums,."

205
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,167
"If you don't dance
along with him,."

206
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,533
"If any problem arise
for students,"

207
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,133
"I'll be there to support them."

208
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,834
"I'll break the hand and limbs,
if anyone tease the girls."

209
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:05,566
"I was also a student before
wearing the police attire."

210
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:09,099
"If all the students amass,
even the government may go in haste."

211
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,800
"Accept the police department
as your friend,"

212
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,500
"I'm your friend now."

213
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,466
"There is no end for this love."

214
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:20,000
"Salute him, hold him."

215
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,467
"Take a selfie as
we are one and the same."

216
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,233
"Give and take respect,
be oblivious and bear,."

217
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,067
"It's a nice ballad
which graces him,."

218
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,934
"If you don't sing
along with us,."

219
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,399
"The jar and the pair,
and the gruel,."

220
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,266
"Using the tiffin box lid
as the snare drums,."

221
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:44,334
"If you don't dance
along with him,."

222
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,600
He got the point.
What do you say now?

223
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,266
Wait. He is not letting him speak.
You are not letting me listen.

224
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,500
Let's see what he says.

225
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,267
Hey Subash,
You tell me which is right?

226
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:20,200
Four brilliants there and
two of you are here.

227
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,233
You decide which is good or bad
for the country.

228
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,734
Children are waiting
for their uncle.

229
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:27,801
Hi...

230
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:30,868
My dear.

231
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:31,167
My dear.

232
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
How is it?

233
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,801
Superb!

234
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:37,767
Anshu, dear.

235
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,167
What happened to you?

236
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,933
My music teacher told me
not to come to class.

237
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:44,467
Why?

238
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,500
I didn't go for three days.

239
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,566
Why? I didn't feel like going.

240
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,567
That's why.

241
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,299
You are my angel.

242
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,067
You say so.

243
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,801
But my teacher shouted
at me to get out.

244
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,033
I'm there for you.

245
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,667
We are going to
music class tomorrow.

246
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,467
We'll meet the teacher
and then sing.

247
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:01,701
Yes.

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Be careful.

249
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,000
Dosa...

250
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,434
Take it.

251
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,700
Dad, the aroma of ghee is nice.

252
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:15,434
Yes.

253
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,743
We are in the same house
and belong to the same family.

254
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,534
But so much of diversity!

255
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:20,968
Are you and the children,
the same?

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,567
6 feet and 80kgs of weight!

257
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,967
Is he a child to you?

258
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,200
Yes, until he attains
the status of marriage...

259
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,167
he is also a child
in this house.

260
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:29,901
Don't blabber, mom.

261
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,334
Is marriage a status?

262
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:32,601
Yes, brother.

263
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:37,267
If we earn on our own
and buy a car, that's a status.

264
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:41,968
If we get a degree next
to our name, that's a status.

265
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,033
All these belong to us.

266
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,767
In the name of marriage,
if we tie a nuptial thread...

267
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:50,133
we belong to her.

268
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,366
Then, how you'll be a
child to a mother?

269
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,434
You have good taste.

270
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,834
Anitha is very much blessed.

271
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,867
Why? Aren't you blessed?

272
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,367
Who? Me?

273
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,533
I gave you all my jewels.

274
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:04,801
You pledged that in the bank.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,066
I gave...

276
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,067
You pledged...

277
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,133
So, you are blessed!

278
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,834
Don't tease him to the core.
He is pitiful.

279
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,900
Today, you're Anusha
and you're Vinusha.

280
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,968
Okay. Okay.

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
(Music class)

282
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,066
Yes. Good morning, teacher.

283
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,500
This girl, actually...

284
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,199
Listen, better forget the thought of
rejoining her in class.

285
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,934
But... what a rude girl!

286
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,066
When I asked why she didn't
come to music class...

287
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,167
she replied rudely.

288
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:46,099
Oh no, teacher.
You've got it all wrong.

289
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,868
She wasn't the girl who
was rude to you.

290
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,334
Her sister, Anusha.

291
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,100
See there.

292
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Hi...

293
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,634
Oh, twins?

294
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,267
Yes.

295
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,634
You aren't a rude girl
like your sister, are you?

296
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,233
No, no mam. I'm a good girl.

297
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,300
Very good girl.

298
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Come.

299
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,167
Bad boy, Chicha.

300
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,933
Don't tell grandpa, okay?

301
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,467
Okay. Thank you.

302
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:17,701
Check who it is, brother.

303
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,434
Sir, it's a call from alcohol.

304
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,601
You turn down the call.
I'll speak later.

305
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,834
You've saved that as alcohol.

306
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,766
But it doesn't set right for you.

307
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,967
That is, everyone gets
addicted to alcohol.

308
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay.

309
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,400
But I've named the person
I'm addicted to, as "Alcohol".

310
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,600
Anitha, my fiancee.

311
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:37,367
Is it, sir?

312
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,466
Then stop aside.

313
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,367
We'll go after speaking.
She may call again.

314
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,801
Nothing like that, brother.

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,733
If I don't attend her call,

316
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,267
She won't disturb me,
until I call her back.

317
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,467
It's an understanding.

318
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,300
Okay, sir.

319
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:54,433
If I fail to attend
when my wife calls...

320
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,801
she'll call back five times
to ask why I didn't attend?

321
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,167
Sir.

322
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,067
What Subash?

323
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,566
In the meantime, while I was away at court,

324
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,467
You thrashed Paraman's bar, I believe?

325
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,400
If I hadn't gone, the students
might've thrashed him too, sir.

326
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,667
Come, sir.

327
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,367
What's the matter?

328
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,494
Sir, our brownie is missing.
Who is brownie?

329
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,287
It's a costly breed named 'Chow Chow', sir.

330
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,767
Okay, what should we do?

331
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,967
Our madam suspects that
someone might've kidnapped it.

332
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,968
Our lawyer has also given
a written complaint, sir.

333
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:37,399
Okay, we'll rove around and find
your pet.

334
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,968
You can go.

335
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,366
Not that sir, it's been a night
since the pet went missing.

336
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,033
We fear that it may get along
with other races outside.

337
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,467
Oh, is that so?

338
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,333
Sir, yes.

339
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,367
Your thought of racism
even for a pet is...

340
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:52,133
You are the true Indian.

341
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,567
You don't even need
an Aadhar card.

342
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,667
Thank you, sir.

343
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,420
You must be killed foremost.

344
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,767
Oh, god! You leave.

345
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,267
Hey...

346
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,000
Hi, sister. Hi, Subash.

347
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,333
Anitha is getting ready.

348
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:15,999
She told that you both
are going out for dinner.

349
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,567
Yes, sister.

350
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:17,601
Please, sit.

351
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:18,934
Okay.

352
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,167
Hi, dear. Hi.

353
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:32,133
(Titanic movie playing)

354
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,999
That painting scene? Isn't it?

355
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
I have seen that four times.

356
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,567
Four times!

357
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,021
Usually, it won't take this long
for her to get ready.

358
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:53,868
Go and check.

359
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Always into 'PubG'.

360
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,667
Uncle... uncle.

361
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:09,500
Why are you gazing at me?

362
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,234
Am I looking so pretty?

363
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,133
What is this?

364
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,567
You're wearing a similar dress like mine.

365
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,033
How would I know?

366
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,499
That you'd also wear
the same blue denim?

367
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,734
Please, change now. Go.

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Wait, I'll come.

369
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:26,934
Hey...

370
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,133
Hey Subash,

371
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,901
Just once.
We have to go for dinner.

372
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,014
Hey, wait. Everyone is at home.
It's okay. Just once.

373
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,934
We've been in love
for this many years.

374
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,934
You behave naughty
whenever you get a chance.

375
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,500
Aren't you bored of that?

376
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:44,833
Know something,

377
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,833
After 15 years
of our marriage...

378
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,400
giving birth to children, you'll
become a plumpy aunt.

379
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,200
Even then, if I don't get naughty,
when I get a chance,

380
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,901
Either I'm not in love with you...

381
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,767
or I must be in an affair
with some one.

382
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,701
Being naughty is a must
for a good relationship.

383
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:15,100
"The eyes resort to dreams,"
"Queries within the soul".

384
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,132
"If you come along with me,"
"I'll rejoice that".

385
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,967
"The eyes resort to dreams,"
"Queries within the soul".

386
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:24,199
"If you come along with me,"
"I'll rejoice that".

387
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,366
"The eyes resort to dreams..."

388
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,267
"Queries within the soul..."

389
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:36,467
"To behold you,"
"Tell me your address".

390
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,100
"To accompany you,"
"Why do I need permission?"

391
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,066
"Boundless time
with you is enough,."

392
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:49,334
"We must live together till the end".

393
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,366
"Immense desires transpire
all the time,"

394
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,700
"I have to lean on your shoulders
without accountable time".

395
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:58,767
"Oh, Saayali... Oh, Saayali..."

396
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,933
"You caused an earthquake
within me".

397
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,000
"Oh, Saayali... Oh, Saayali..."

398
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,233
"You pitched me deep
with the roots".

399
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:11,132
"The eyes resort to dreams,"
"Queries within the soul,."

400
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:14,400
"If you come along with me,"
"I'll rejoice that".

401
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,466
"The eyes resort to dreams,"
"Queries within the soul,."

402
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:20,801
"If you come along with me,"
"I'll rejoice that".

403
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:48,633
"It's an abode which is surrounded
with deep love,."

404
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:54,901
"It's a nest where we live
as one soul,."

405
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:07,634
"It's an abode which is surrounded
with deep love,."

406
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:14,032
"It's a nest where we live
as one soul,."

407
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:17,133
"Like the drizzles which is
the glee of the sky".

408
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,267
"Ever the merriness flows
in our abode,."

409
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,234
"The love here has no deception,."

410
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,499
"The breeze here, also sings a lullaby,."

411
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,867
"There is no other need
for us to live,."

412
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:39,267
"We live with love to
attain the gaiety".

413
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,366
"Oh, Saayali... Oh, Saayali..."

414
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,434
"You caused an earthquake
within me".

415
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,567
"I'm your Saayali... I'm your Saayali..."

416
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:51,934
"You pitched me deep
with the roots".

417
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:03,968
Shall we marry?

418
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:06,033
Is this the way to propose?

419
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,467
I don't know to propose formally.

420
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,833
It's beautiful, Isn't it?

421
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,566
I'll decide later about
our marriage.

422
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,767
But this ring is nice,
I'll take it.

423
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:22,300
"The moment of your absence
is like a blaze,."

424
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:28,734
"Give me a notion
to be with you forever,."

425
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,099
"I become a waning moon,
when you go apart."

426
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,701
"Come, let's go for a joyful ride,
when the love is bound".

427
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:52,334
"Into my eyes, your persona
appears on violation,."

428
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,968
"Is it to defeat me?"

429
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,266
"The burden of your love
lies on my mirror like heart,."

430
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:00,166
"Is it to break my heart
like glass bits?"

431
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:03,067
"Why this delay?"

432
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,433
"Come with me to lead a life".

433
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:12,868
"We'll ally before the days pass".

434
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,933
"I'm your Saayali... I'm your Saayali..."

435
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,999
"You caused an earthquake
within me".

436
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,100
"I'm your Saayali... I'm your Saayali..."

437
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:25,334
"You pitched me deep
with the roots".

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Just wait.

439
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,109
Stop your vehicle.
Stop your car.

440
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,000
Is that your vehicle?

441
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,166
Stop your vehicle.

442
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:09,667
You can go.

443
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:10,400
Okay.

444
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,000
Thank you sir.

445
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:11,801
Give your license.

446
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:12,567
Where are you coming from?

447
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:14,233
Thirumangalam.

448
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,167
Show me your license.

449
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,467
Sir, my house is nearby.

450
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,109
I have the RC book and license.
Stop your vehicle...

451
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:18,801
Stop the vehicle.

452
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:19,334
I forgot, sir.

453
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:20,934
Ask someone from
your house to get it.

454
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:22,700
Else you leave the
vehicle here and get it.

455
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,566
I was wondering
why the hands were itching.

456
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,133
Come on... King of collections!

457
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:26,667
Go...

458
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:26,934
Come inside...

459
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:27,801
Go...

460
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:28,634
What are you looking at?

461
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:28,968
Go...

462
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,867
He thinks, he is Bruce Lee...

463
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:31,968
No need to scrutinise him.

464
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,667
Yes, sir.

465
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:35,367
My neighbourhood aunt also
admires me because I'm slim.

466
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:36,934
Hey, it's drunken driving.

467
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:38,248
Do you know
how much the fine is?

468
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,734
If it's for the government, Rs.3K sir.
You are correct.

469
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,800
If it's for the department, Rs.500.

470
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,400
He is good in logic. See now.

471
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,567
Where is your helmet?

472
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:47,601
No helmet.

473
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:48,634
RC book?

474
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,033
License?

475
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,601
Insurance?

476
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:52,868
That means?

477
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:54,467
Then, what do you have?

478
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:56,601
Not for myself,
It's for the station share.

479
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:57,710
I kept somewhere here...
take it out.

480
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:59,334
Hey, where are you searching?

481
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,367
Wait, sir.

482
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:01,334
Take it out.

483
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,367
Here it is, sir.

484
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,300
I got half booze.
It's the left over.

485
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,733
Hey, how dare you drink
before a policeman?

486
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:08,633
Sir, the quantity doesn't matter
to you.

487
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:10,334
Whatever, the fine is the same.

488
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,868
Give me Rs.100 and take your bike.

489
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:15,000
Sir, is it the emergency help number
100?

490
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,199
Don't you listen to me?
Take the lathi.

491
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,399
Okay... hey...

492
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,167
Take the license.

493
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,901
Take the license.

494
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:22,733
Stop the car...

495
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:23,434
Hey...

496
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,800
What happened?

497
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:25,801
Hey...

498
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,067
Subash.

499
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,033
What, Subash?

500
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,300
Be careful.

501
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:52,701
Subash.

502
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,000
Subash, listen to me.
Whatever happens, be calm.

503
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,133
He is the minister's son.

504
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,601
Not only to you,
it'll be a problem to all.

505
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,561
Listen to me.
Sir, he is not aware about you.

506
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:03,800
Don't mistake. Who is he?

507
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,132
He is new to the job.

508
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,800
Do you know
the price of this car?

509
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,466
Sir, don't be angry. Please.
Your lifetime salary.

510
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,400
Please, sir.
That's the price of this car.

511
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:10,267
It happened by mistake, sir.

512
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,933
He's not listening to me,
and he's simply staring at me.

513
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:12,868
What? Hey! Sir,

514
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:14,199
Don't be angry, sir.

515
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,133
How dare you stare?

516
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:15,734
Sir, please.

517
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,533
To whom are you showing heroism?
I'll tell him, sir.

518
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:18,634
Hey, what is his name?

519
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,400
What is your name? Subash, sir.

520
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,600
Tomorrow he must call and meet me.
I'll tell him, sir.

521
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,766
You must come and meet me.
I'll tell him, sir.

522
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,199
If not, you're done.
Please, sir.

523
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,443
You go, sir.
Whom are you staring at?

524
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:27,633
The public is watching, sir.

525
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:29,410
How dare you stop with a barricade!
Subash, listen to me.

526
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:30,434
Go.

527
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:31,200
Sir.

528
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,734
You are not fit to
open even my car door.

529
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:35,299
How dare you stop my car?

530
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,367
Sir, forgive us.

531
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:37,567
You go, sir.

532
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:38,601
Tell him to be disciplined.

533
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,467
Sir, I'll take care.

534
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,533
Sir, no problem will emerge.
Move the barricade away.

535
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,567
I'll clear it, sir.

536
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,801
You come.

537
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:45,968
Sir... Good night, sir.

538
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,901
Why should we retain these people alone?

539
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:49,934
Send them too, brother.

540
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Tell everyone to go.

541
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,340
Tell them to go. Thank you sir.

542
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:55,701
Send them.

543
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,601
Leave.

544
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,867
Kabilan, tell everyone to go.

545
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,100
Okay sir.. I'll send them.

546
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,634
Let's go. Come fast...

547
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:01,667
Subash,

548
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,868
What they have is not the
attitude of money or hooliganism.

549
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
It's their power!

550
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:08,974
They'll be in the ruling party.

551
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:10,714
We have to stand for
their protection.

552
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,433
If they get defeated in elections,

553
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,677
They'll complain saying there is
no guarantee for their lives.

554
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,621
Even then, we have to stand
for their protection.

555
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,734
As we always stand
for their protection,

556
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,500
They don't respect us.

557
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
"Obey the order."

558
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,000
Under these words,

559
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,300
No policeman can think
on his own...

560
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,367
or even enrage.

561
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,267
Okay, I'll do one thing.

562
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:32,681
I'll give his phone number.

563
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,500
You give him two missed calls.
Tomorrow at 9 and 10 am.

564
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:37,974
Damn sure,
he won't answer the calls.

565
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,901
He'll sleep till 2pm,
after boozing all night.

566
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:43,314
We can tell him that
he didn't answer the calls.

567
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,766
If by any chance, he answers
and asks you to come somewhere,

568
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,801
Don't go alone.

569
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,434
I'll also come.

570
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Okay?

571
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,114
Thank you, sir. Okay, Subash.

572
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:54,234
You go home.

573
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:15,434
Who is that?

574
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,033
Leave me. Who is that?

575
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:28,434
Leave me.

576
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,167
Do you know who my father is?

577
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,734
Why? Don't you know?
Hey leave me.

578
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,734
Who's that?

579
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:51,300
Hey leave me...

580
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:07,767
Hey! Come.

581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,033
Chicha, phone...

582
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:18,400
Sir,

583
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:20,434
Subash, I'm standing down
at your flat.

584
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:21,700
You mean, here!

585
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:22,701
Yes.

586
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,066
I'll come now, sir.

587
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,500
Mom, see this. Okay.

588
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:28,901
Brother! Sir!

589
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:29,901
Good morning, sir.

590
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:31,443
Is it your own flat, Subash?

591
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,000
No, sir. We are residing
for rent.

592
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,300
My parents are not interested
in the apartment culture.

593
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,934
So, we've built a new house
in OMR.

594
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,143
Next month is their wedding anniversary.
(Shashtiapthapoorthi)

595
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:46,767
So, we planned to surprise them
on that day with house warming ceremony.

596
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,734
Good, a big commitment,
isn't it?

597
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:51,166
Nothing like that, sir.

598
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,334
It's a small sentiment.

599
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,567
What's the matter, sir?
You have come this far?

600
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:56,801
That's nothing, Subash.

601
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:58,900
Minister's son who had a brawl
with you yesterday,

602
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:01,801
Has been thrashed by someone.

603
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,466
They shouldn't react on you,
thinking you might've done that.

604
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,834
That's why I came to alert you.

605
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,901
Oh...

606
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:10,967
But sir, his back has
been tinkered very well.

607
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,334
He is the sensational news
in all the media.

608
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:17,000
Our good time, that hotel is
not under our station limits.

609
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,734
Else, our heads might've rolled.

610
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:21,399
What is in our control?

611
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,100
Yes, sir.

612
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,132
Even our wife is not under
our control.

613
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:24,534
Hey.

614
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,066
I said about my wife, sir.

615
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,132
Shall we follow up this case, sir?

616
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:29,133
Why?

617
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,607
It's an unnecessary job for us.

618
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,133
Correct, sir.

619
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,634
Someone has done our job.

620
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,267
At least we can find
and thank him.

621
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,733
Sir, now it's the time you mentioned.

622
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,067
Shall I give him a missed call?

623
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:45,534
I can understand.

624
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,300
You are happy inside.

625
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,132
Chandran,
have you reached the red building?

626
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,667
Sir, I'm going to the spot.

627
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:01,334
Kabilan, you come with me.

628
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,499
You stand at the gate.

629
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay sir.

630
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,968
Who are you?

631
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,033
Are you the security?

632
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,834
Give that stick.

633
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,100
Sir, she was already dead
when I noticed.

634
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,466
Sir, I tested by keeping a thread
near her nose.

635
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:18,999
It didn't wave off.
She was dead.

636
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,934
Hey, why do you
do unnecessary things?

637
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:21,999
Then for what are we here?

638
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,701
Why don't you do the
post mortem also?

639
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:47,033
Sir. What?

640
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,400
This phone was lying
there in the bush.

641
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:14,367
Go around.

642
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:16,868
Sir, Subash,

643
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,634
We found the phone of that girl.

644
00:38:18,968 --> 00:38:20,200
But it's got a pattern lock..

645
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:21,800
Sir, I'll unlock that.

646
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,534
The finger print would be
visible in the light's reflection.

647
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:41,701
Subash, just check out if there
are any details about this girl.

648
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,067
Sure, sir.

649
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,968
Sir, it shows Mogappair.

650
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,367
Mogappair...

651
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,601
Sir, what, Subash?

652
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,701
Sir, I don't think it's a suicide.

653
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:56,801
Something is fishy.

654
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,033
Is this your intuition?

655
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:01,267
We can't decide whether
it's a murder or a suicide.

656
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:02,547
We don't have those rights.

657
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,801
Sir, then forensic, postmortem...

658
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,801
Chandran. Sir...

659
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,934
Did you inquire?

660
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,834
We found the phone of that girl.

661
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:15,968
Mogappair area, sir.

662
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,243
Already, we've attended four suicide
cases in this building, haven't we?

663
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:19,701
Yes.

664
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,493
They've probably built this building
for people to jump off.

665
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,800
File the case,
mentioning it's a suicide...

666
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,234
and complete the formalities.

667
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,600
Also, inform the girl's house.

668
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:28,033
Okay.

669
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:29,467
Hey. Sir,

670
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,033
Sir.

671
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:33,968
Okay, sir.

672
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:35,467
Sir.

673
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,601
Sir, how did he decide without
even stepping inside?

674
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:46,767
"Obey the order."

675
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,400
Ramdass, sir.

676
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,754
You take the body
to the hospital.

677
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:51,243
We will go to mogappair.
Okay, sir.

678
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,267
Subash, come let's go.

679
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,100
Go and inform them, Subash.

680
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:20,434
Sir...

681
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,767
Go, Subash.

682
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,567
How can I, sir?

683
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
Subash, we have to face
hundreds of situations like this.

684
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,667
You'll get used to it.

685
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,167
Go and inform.

686
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,767
Go...

687
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,367
Hello,

688
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,801
I'll be late.

689
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,167
Don't wait.

690
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,300
Okay... bye.

691
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,534
Yes, sir.

692
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,367
I'm Subash.

693
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:01,834
Parvati...

694
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:03,028
She is my daughter only, sir.

695
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,480
Is it for passport verification?

696
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:05,834
Please, come in.

697
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,767
Sir...

698
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:19,033
Sir, he's thinking I've come
for passport verification.

699
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,667
To him... how can I sir?

700
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,067
You must learn, Subash.

701
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,334
You would've to explain situations
more brutal than this.

702
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,467
Sorry, sir.

703
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,601
What's this?

704
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,667
An accident.

705
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,166
Come and identify
whether she is your daughter.

706
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,200
What are you saying, sir?

707
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,234
Which hospital, sir?

708
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Not any hospital.

709
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:42,834
Royapettah mortuary.

710
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,500
Oh, no!

711
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,734
Sir!

712
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,767
What happened, sir?

713
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,367
Sir, tell me and leave.
Come, let's go.

714
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:48,434
Sir.

715
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:49,868
Oh, no!

716
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:53,834
Sir, at least you tell me.
What happened?

717
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:54,933
Why are you crying?

718
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:57,176
Our daughter has met with an accident
and is at the mortuary.

719
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,267
Oh no, what accident?

720
00:41:58,734 --> 00:41:59,734
What?

721
00:41:59,868 --> 00:42:01,701
What happened to my daughter?

722
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,701
What? Tell me.

723
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:07,000
At least, you tell me, brother.

724
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,000
What happened to my daughter?

725
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,200
I can understand your emotions.

726
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,534
The deceased is your friend.
I understand very well.

727
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,100
Hey, why don't you tell her?

728
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:16,933
The girls are emotional by nature.

729
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,033
But, you guys too?

730
00:42:18,234 --> 00:42:19,167
Sub-Inspector has come.

731
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:19,901
Just a minute.

732
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Wait.

733
00:42:21,601 --> 00:42:22,999
I'm telling you.

734
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,166
Please understand.

735
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,167
I'll speak.

736
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
First understand.

737
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:27,834
Sir!

738
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,667
Sir, everyone is enraged. Why?

739
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:34,367
The deceased parents are not
taking the corpse citing it's not suicide.

740
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,733
They are creating a ruckus.

741
00:42:35,734 --> 00:42:37,299
I managed to my best, sir.

742
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,367
I told them you'll come
and we'll talk after that.

743
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,132
Just... Just be calm.

744
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:42,133
Be calm.

745
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:44,800
See, only If you stay calm,
he'll answer you.

746
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:49,499
We are investigating.
Please, help the police.

747
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,700
There is no point in shouting.

748
00:42:51,634 --> 00:42:53,734
You girls are educated.

749
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:55,499
Be patient. Understand please.

750
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,577
We can answer only,
if you stay calm.

751
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:00,400
(Crowd arguing)

752
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:05,801
If you do as I say, sure, sir.

753
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,200
Sure, they'll investigate this case.
Okay, sir.

754
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,166
Sir, how clearly we had explained.

755
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,833
Again you have come here.

756
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:25,534
Sorry, sir.

757
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:27,976
We don't have clarity about parvati's
death, inspite of your explanations.

758
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Whatever we say,
you're only trying to convince us.

759
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:32,267
Sir, I know Parvati very well.

760
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,420
I swear, there is no chance of her
committing suicide.

761
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,434
If we don't make this an
issue now, you... sorry.

762
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:39,968
The police will not
bother about it, sir.

763
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:43,566
That's why we informed
the media, sir.

764
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,900
Sir, what's this? Why aren't
you allowing us inside?

765
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:48,467
Sir, we're talking. Be patient.

766
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,100
Yes... yes...
don't disturb, please wait.

767
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,233
Just listen to what I say.

768
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:53,334
Okay.

769
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,066
Could you try...

770
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:56,067
Greetings, sir.

771
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,944
Don't you know
to end it there itself?

772
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:03,766
They didn't create any ruckus
or give interviews to any channels.

773
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,667
They're sitting in front of
the police station.

774
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:07,132
They've called all
the media channels.

775
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:08,701
It's time for the DC's
station visit.

776
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:10,434
What ruckus to create
more than this?

777
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,234
We've filed an FIR relating
to Parvati's case.

778
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:20,761
The post mortem report
would come only after this.

779
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:23,534
We have to investigate with that
and come to a conclusion.

780
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:26,300
We will inquire further
whether it's a murder or not.

781
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:28,200
Subash. Yes, sir.

782
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:29,967
Get that petition.

783
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,367
Deal this case seriously.
Okay, sir.

784
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,434
I told you, I'll inquire.
Look after the formalities.

785
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,601
You look after
Parvati's funeral.

786
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,601
This is my responsibility!

787
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,933
Sir, this is such a huge building.

788
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:03,433
Eight gates are there.

789
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,033
Only two securities.

790
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,067
How to keep a
track on the visitors?

791
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:13,233
I had a doubt on
that place when we saw it, sir.

792
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:15,334
I went to that place again,
on the same night.

793
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:20,634
"The treacheries which don't die,
Will do it chore per diem...!"

794
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:23,433
"Like the crow which eats
the leftover food,."

795
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:26,133
"If it continues, it'll destroy you..."

796
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,433
What Subash? The van is filled
with cigarette buds?

797
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:37,033
Sir, they call it 'Hotbox'.

798
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:43,000
They'll smoke weed as a gang
in a closed room or car.

799
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:46,199
The effect is more intense
when compared to plain weed.

800
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,066
This is also one of the habits
which ruin this generation.

801
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:52,766
"The law mustn't doze without
searching for the crime...!"

802
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,868
When I look at that place,
it still seems to be active, sir.

803
00:45:55,901 --> 00:45:58,800
"Even if you're the last one left,
don't compromise to live."

804
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,533
"All the dogs and ghosts will wag their
tails, asking us for everything we have..."

805
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:04,700
Inspector sir said that already
four suicides had happened there.

806
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:05,734
Yes.

807
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:08,367
If we meet the concerned officials,
we'll get some information.

808
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:14,767
"The deceit and bribe together,
Enact a drama everywhere...!"

809
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:20,200
"Only the truth is in your hands.
Be careful... be careful..."

810
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:22,399
I want to talk to you
regarding the suicide case...

811
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,610
that happened at the
'Redd' building.

812
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:26,666
Are you new to this job?
Inquiring about old cases?

813
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,067
You should only do
what the seniors say.

814
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:32,834
I was inquiring sincerely,

815
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:36,767
Suddenly, they asked me to close
the case, mentioning it's suicide.

816
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:39,467
Before I could realise,
I was transferred.

817
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,767
"If you think swindling and pestering
are a single package and bend,."

818
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,333
Sir, just a minute.
"there is no solution ever..."

819
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:47,200
"If you fight with wrath,
this world will obey you."

820
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,033
Yes, tell me.

821
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:51,467
We are in the new house,
colours have to be chosen. Come soon.

822
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,733
I'm coming there.

823
00:46:52,734 --> 00:46:57,000
"If you think of living
like stone and sand,."

824
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:02,601
"A situation will arise
to put you down."

825
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,033
You select from this.

826
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:09,132
Give me a minute. Come.

827
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,200
Your room. Oh, sorry.

828
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,800
You select the colour
for our room.

829
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:13,868
You know all this
better than me.

830
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:14,901
You select on your own.

831
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,234
Strictly, your choice.

832
00:47:16,235 --> 00:47:17,400
You choose it.

833
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,100
This one...

834
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:22,534
Grey colour won't suit
the bedroom, dear.

835
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,243
Then, why are you asking me?

836
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:25,701
You could've just selected.

837
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:27,601
Okay.

838
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:29,534
I have selected aquamarine blue.

839
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,901
Bharati, get that shade card.

840
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:48,299
Use this colour there.
Okay madam...

841
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,701
And...

842
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,367
Sorry.

843
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:58,234
This shade over there.

844
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:02,333
In the past five years,
six incidents have occurred.

845
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:05,901
I have marked the time
of the crime and the area.

846
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:09,533
Can you tell me the numbers
which were active in the building, then?

847
00:48:09,534 --> 00:48:11,968
Numbers active five years ago
can't be tracked, sir.

848
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,767
It's possible
only for two years.

849
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:15,133
I'll track, sir.

850
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:16,500
Thank you.

851
00:48:16,501 --> 00:48:17,667
Okay, sir.

852
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,267
What Subash?
How come this brutal?

853
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,567
Sir, in Parvati's case, upon
inquiry of her friends and family...

854
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:47,766
there is no reason
for her to commit suicide.

855
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:52,968
But, in the reports, it is clearly
stated as suicide. I don't understand.

856
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,466
The truth is known only
to the deceased...

857
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:57,299
and the doctor who has
conducted the post mortem.

858
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,167
You don't get emotional, Subash.

859
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,733
Sir, I have some work.

860
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,266
I will finish that and
come to the station.

861
00:49:03,267 --> 00:49:04,367
Okay.

862
00:49:07,868 --> 00:49:08,701
Yes.

863
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:11,634
Doctor, a formal inquiry about
the post mortem report of Parvati.

864
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:13,867
Sir, I'm a government servant too.

865
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,133
Everything has a procedure,
doesn't it?

866
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,867
Whatever it is, meet me
in the morning at the hospital.

867
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,634
Please, leave now.

868
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,601
Sorry.

869
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Hello.

870
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,566
What can we do for that?

871
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:37,234
What do you say?

872
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:37,767
Nothing.

873
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:39,133
Sir, come.

874
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:40,367
What's the matter, sir?

875
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:41,601
It's something important.

876
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,274
Joint Commissioner Sarangan
has come.

877
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,433
It might be something important.

878
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:49,434
Oh...

879
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:53,534
Sir, Subash.

880
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:54,534
New SI, Crime branch.

881
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:55,067
Good luck.

882
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:56,067
I'm leaving, Chandran.

883
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:00,933
Will it be so?

884
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,100
It won't be, sir.

885
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Subash, sir.

886
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,543
That 'Redd' building suicide case...
yes, sir.

887
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,601
I'm following that.

888
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:08,066
Get those files and come in.

889
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:09,067
Sure, sir.

890
00:50:19,701 --> 00:50:20,701
Sir.

891
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,400
Another team is taking this over.

892
00:50:26,868 --> 00:50:28,066
I'll refer you another case.

893
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,567
Follow that, hereafter.

894
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,766
Sir, just two more days.

895
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,133
I'll finish the case by then.

896
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,833
The report has come stating
it's a suicide.

897
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:36,266
Do only what I say.

898
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,834
Neelakandan, Minister of Food,
is getting life threatening calls.

899
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:40,233
Inquire about that.

900
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:42,133
You go to his house,
first thing in the morning.

901
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:45,767
What?

902
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:49,334
Sir, if you tell who's going to
follow this case...

903
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,733
I'll pass on some
important leads to them.

904
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:53,834
Subash, I know you're studying for IPS.

905
00:50:53,868 --> 00:50:57,433
After you pass the examination
and get a higher post than me...

906
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:58,968
you order what I must do.

907
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,868
I'll do it, then.

908
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:02,868
Now, just do what I say.

909
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:05,132
You are just an SI
in this station.

910
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:06,634
Don't forget that.

911
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:08,267
Go.

912
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:18,534
Sir, look at how polished the
minister's house looks.

913
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,166
It was entirely built with the
nutrition scheme eggs.

914
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:23,601
All the accomplices sitting
there are goofs.

915
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:25,534
But, they'll act as if
they're smart.

916
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,433
Boss, how are you? Come.

917
00:51:28,434 --> 00:51:29,868
Why are you not seen
at the station?

918
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:33,900
Sir, for the past ten days, eggs are being
thrown on the minister's house.

919
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:34,400
Oh, no!

920
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,132
The whole house is stenchy.

921
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,234
But, he's not getting caught.

922
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:40,633
We asked you to come,
to find out who that is.

923
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:42,132
What, he left?

924
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:42,901
Tell me, Gopi.

925
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,710
According to the timing you gave me,
a single number...

926
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,933
was active five times
at the 'Redd' building, sir.

927
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:49,466
I've messaged you the details
of that number.

928
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:50,467
Oh... Thank you.

929
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:56,667
Who? You mean, 'Bar' Ganesan?

930
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,267
Abhijith here. Might be...

931
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,700
Hello, I'm the Crime branch SI,
from Anna Nagar.

932
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,399
I want to talk to you regarding
the 'Redd' building murder case.

933
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,801
Come to the golf court.
Be here in thirty minutes.

934
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,733
Tell me, boss.
If it happens at the minister's house?

935
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,467
The eggs were thrown on
the minister who distributes it.

936
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,660
Now, sir will come after
he's done with his phone call.

937
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:16,801
Sir...

938
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:39,167
Who are you?

939
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,167
What do you want?

940
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,634
Abhijith asked me to come.

941
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,100
I'm Crime branch SI, Subash.

942
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,634
What's the matter?

943
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:09,901
I need to talk to you regarding
the 'Redd' building murder case.

944
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,834
Are you dealing that case?

945
00:53:17,868 --> 00:53:19,701
We told the department to drop that case.

946
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,701
Then, why have you come?

947
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:23,067
Okay, okay.

948
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
I got it.

949
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,434
Do you want money?

950
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:32,200
A three-course meal, an own house,
marriage, sex, children...

951
00:53:32,234 --> 00:53:34,234
that's the happiness
of a normal person.

952
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:35,901
But,

953
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:38,601
We are above all that.

954
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:40,234
See our happiness!

955
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:43,467
Enjoy.

956
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:51,000
If she had agreed,
we wouldn't have touched her.

957
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:54,133
But, she wept and ran around.
That's interesting.

958
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
See the next one.

959
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,681
It'll be more interesting than
the previous one.

960
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:06,667
You seem to enjoy watching it.

961
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
What?

962
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:09,434
Are you aroused?

963
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,667
Hey, you are making a mistake.

964
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:27,868
Do you know who we are?

965
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,300
Do you know who our fathers are?

966
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,400
Hey, none of the rich guys
know who their fathers are?

967
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:38,601
You people always ask others
who your fathers are...

968
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:43,467
Do one thing. If you come out
of this case, give a complaint.

969
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:44,834
I'll find out.

970
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:47,700
Now, shut your trap and
come with me to the station.

971
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,701
What did you say?

972
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,334
Hey!

973
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:42,033
Hey.

974
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,901
If we come out, we will...

975
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:49,634
What? If you come out?

976
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:54,233
Section 376 D and 302,
Non bailable...

977
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:55,067
Don't you understand?

978
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:58,434
For 20 years, I won't let you
out of prison.

979
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:01,467
What? 20 years in prison?

980
00:57:02,868 --> 00:57:04,066
20 minutes.

981
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,967
Just for 20 minutes...

982
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:08,300
you try retaining us
in this lockup.

983
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:22,100
Sir,

984
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,100
You...

985
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,733
Hey, what have you done?
Why did you keep them in?

986
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:30,900
Sir, 'Redd' building Parvati case...
I told you not to take up that case.

987
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:32,167
Sir, not only this case.

988
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,199
They are involved in many other
murder cases of girls.

989
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,566
I have the video evidence
to prove them as criminals.

990
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:36,600
Don't talk rubbish.

991
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:37,601
Sir, sir.

992
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:38,767
Sir,

993
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:41,000
Are you the Inspector
of this station or is he?

994
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:42,534
I told him, sir.

995
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:43,901
But, he is...

996
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:46,133
On what basis,
did you arrest them?

997
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:50,067
Do you know the status
of their fathers in the society?

998
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,700
Show me that video proof.

999
00:57:53,701 --> 00:57:54,701
Yes, sir.

1000
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:58,700
Sir, passcode...

1001
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,467
4455, brother.

1002
00:58:07,868 --> 00:58:08,868
Sir...

1003
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:11,567
Sir...

1004
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:12,400
Sir...

1005
00:58:12,434 --> 00:58:13,767
Sir, it's auto deleting.

1006
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:16,968
Evidence?

1007
00:58:17,467 --> 00:58:18,901
Sir, I saw it.

1008
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,167
I said evidence.

1009
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Sir.

1010
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:27,701
Will the murderer have the
proof of crime on his phone?

1011
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,300
Idiot.

1012
00:59:01,701 --> 00:59:03,968
Even when you are here,
my son is in the lock up.

1013
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,009
A small mistake has happened.

1014
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:05,601
I will take care.

1015
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:06,976
Without having any respect
for a collector like me...

1016
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,366
he has taken my son
and kept him in the lock up.

1017
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:09,700
And you remained as a spectator.

1018
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:12,901
Shall I inform the Home Minister?
Or do you want me to speak to the CM?

1019
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:15,814
Clear this soon and
send the guys out.

1020
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:25,367
Release them.

1021
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:27,033
Sir,

1022
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,467
Sir, still I can prove it.

1023
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,500
"It's an order."

1024
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,234
Suspend him.

1025
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,133
You are suspended.

1026
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:56,334
You should've actually been
expelled from the job.

1027
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:57,367
Fool.

1028
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,167
We said 20 minutes.

1029
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,467
But, just 15 minutes brother.

1030
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:09,334
That's what we are.

1031
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:12,643
You think you can do anything
if you have evidence?

1032
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:13,734
You are done.

1033
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,000
You made this day
an unforgettable one in our life.

1034
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,868
Hereafter, you won't forget each
and everyday in your life.

1035
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:36,467
Abhijith, come.

1036
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
Yes dad.

1037
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:43,868
Sir.

1038
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
You don't say anything.

1039
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:46,834
First, you go home.

1040
01:00:47,834 --> 01:00:49,354
Tomorrow is the
house warming ceremony.

1041
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:51,534
Look into those chores.

1042
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:01,633
Postpone this issue for now, sir.

1043
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:03,300
Whatever it is,
we will check later.

1044
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:07,400
Be relaxed, sir.

1045
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:28,734
Mom!

1046
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:30,434
Mom!

1047
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:06,467
Sir.

1048
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,701
Sir, what happened?

1049
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,834
Subash sir!

1050
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,934
Chicha!

1051
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,067
Sir...

1052
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,667
Subash. Madam.

1053
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:38,567
He fainted in shock.
Nothing else, madam.

1054
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:39,701
Subash.

1055
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:42,967
Vinusha!

1056
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:45,000
Go away. Sir, please.

1057
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:45,968
Listen to me. Sir, please.

1058
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,299
Don't go there.
Please listen, Anitha.

1059
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,534
Please understand.

1060
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:49,234
Please, madam.

1061
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:51,343
First, get the child to the hospital
and take care of her.

1062
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:52,367
Come.

1063
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:01,834
Go.

1064
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:03,100
Hurry up.

1065
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:06,434
Sir.

1066
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:25,234
Come in.

1067
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:26,933
Where are you taking us? One...

1068
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:28,999
One... Two...
what's the suspense?

1069
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,533
You closed my eyes too.

1070
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,199
Three...

1071
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,400
Wow!

1072
01:04:34,434 --> 01:04:35,499
Oh, my!

1073
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,767
Our house! A new house!

1074
01:04:42,634 --> 01:04:44,400
It looks superb.

1075
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:48,834
Dear!

1076
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Who are you guys?

1077
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:56,267
Mom!

1078
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,867
Who are you?

1079
01:04:58,868 --> 01:04:59,868
Who?

1080
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:08,334
Mom.

1081
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:10,200
Pull him over.

1082
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,767
Mom.

1083
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:39,868
Mom.

1084
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,200
It's a fire accident.

1085
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:15,734
For performing rituals
to Lord Ganesh...

1086
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,567
they've kept the gas and
kerosene nearby.

1087
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,667
As it was at dawn, nobody
in the neighbourhood noticed.

1088
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:30,367
Sir.

1089
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:43,667
Sir, my family didn't die in a fire
accident, like you conveyed to the media.

1090
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,667
They were murdered.

1091
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,601
I very well know
who those criminals are.

1092
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:51,234
May be.

1093
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,467
Evidence?

1094
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:55,968
Sir,

1095
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:57,734
Sir, I can prove it.

1096
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,067
Won't the murderer know
to destroy the evidence?

1097
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:05,367
Haven't you read about the witnesses
committing suicide in such cases?

1098
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:09,434
All these are one-day
news for dailies.

1099
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:13,700
If it becomes an issue, a one-day
debate runs on television.

1100
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:14,734
That's all.

1101
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:18,400
The deceased becomes news
to the person who is alive.

1102
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:30,299
Register the number '5555'.

1103
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,300
It's good. Isn't it?

1104
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,067
There is a proverb.

1105
01:07:34,868 --> 01:07:37,567
"When the whole country runs,
we must also run amidst it."

1106
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,767
"If you wish to run alone,
you will vanish."

1107
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:43,467
Come.

1108
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:47,734
Thanks for the car.

1109
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:48,767
My pleasure.

1110
01:07:48,868 --> 01:07:49,868
Welcome.

1111
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,467
How are you?

1112
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,300
Hey... hey...

1113
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,734
You must kill a person
only once.

1114
01:07:57,968 --> 01:07:58,300
Go.

1115
01:07:58,934 --> 01:07:59,934
Chill, dude.

1116
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
Go.

1117
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:05,667
If you'd done what had been ordered to you
nothing might've happened.

1118
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:11,601
I like the colour.

1119
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:12,133
Is it so?

1120
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,167
Sit.

1121
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:13,934
On time.

1122
01:08:13,935 --> 01:08:15,167
As always. Yes.

1123
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,834
Come and meet me with
a proper apology letter.

1124
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:23,767
I'll give you the posting
in the same station.

1125
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,367
But, you must work without
disturbing anyone.

1126
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:28,234
Go.

1127
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,701
Collector sir, am I right?

1128
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
What do you say?

1129
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:34,834
Hey, Bhuvan.

1130
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Tell him, why he and the
child were left alive.

1131
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:41,766
We would've also burnt
you in the same house.

1132
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:45,099
But, you must regret living
for losing the whole family...

1133
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,934
and refrain from dying for the child
and go through agony everyday.

1134
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:54,000
The one who is growing up at
your house is another Parvati.

1135
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:55,067
You must understand that.

1136
01:08:55,901 --> 01:08:56,901
Get lost.

1137
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:31,534
Actress Pushpa is coming to file
a complaint on sexual harassment.

1138
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,967
The entire media has assembled here.

1139
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:33,968
Come... come...

1140
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,300
Hi, Anusha.

1141
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,367
Anu, sit.

1142
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:46,600
You be here.

1143
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:47,868
Okay, Chicha.

1144
01:09:54,434 --> 01:09:55,434
Sir.

1145
01:09:56,434 --> 01:09:58,300
If you had obeyed my order...

1146
01:09:59,267 --> 01:10:01,167
you wouldn't have to
stand before me.

1147
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:04,901
If you go with this black mark,
you can never be an IPS.

1148
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:05,934
Do you know that?

1149
01:10:07,634 --> 01:10:10,234
But, your agony must not happen
even for your enemy.

1150
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,033
My enemy must feel my agony.

1151
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:26,167
I asked you for
an apology letter.

1152
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,499
But, you're giving me a
resignation letter.

1153
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,033
Have you gone mad?

1154
01:10:30,067 --> 01:10:31,434
I was mad.

1155
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,433
"Obey the order"
"Obey the order."

1156
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:36,034
Listening to that constantly,
I went mad.

1157
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,567
Now, I'm clear.

1158
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,499
After resigning, what will you do
without the power of the police?

1159
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,767
I'm going to do my job.

1160
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,610
The job which I couldn't do
with the police attire on...

1161
01:10:46,634 --> 01:10:48,500
will now be done without
the police attire.

1162
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:50,801
For that, I don't need the power
of the police.

1163
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:53,314
It's enough if I have the
intelligence of the police.

1164
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,234
Chandran, what's he talking about?

1165
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:57,299
Subash, listen to us.

1166
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,300
Please.

1167
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:02,133
Now, I'm not a policeman
to listen to you.

1168
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:04,567
Public!

1169
01:11:04,634 --> 01:11:05,968
You are a public servant.

1170
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:09,334
You get salary from me
for your work.

1171
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,868
Now, you must do what I say.

1172
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
Don't you understand?

1173
01:11:13,234 --> 01:11:14,834
I'm saying, "Obey the order".

1174
01:11:15,334 --> 01:11:15,868
What?

1175
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,032
"Obey the order" and sit.

1176
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:17,601
Subash.

1177
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:18,367
Hey, sit.

1178
01:11:18,367 --> 01:11:18,801
Sit.

1179
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Sit.

1180
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,901
I thought the police station
was a sacred place.

1181
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:31,500
Because of people like you,
it has lost its sanctity.

1182
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:33,766
Still, the people have
faith on it.

1183
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,933
"Justice stays long,
But god strikes at last."...

1184
01:11:35,934 --> 01:11:37,414
is something people still believe.

1185
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,400
I must lynch.

1186
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:42,667
Those four criminals
must be lynched.

1187
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,267
I won't lynch them.

1188
01:11:47,634 --> 01:11:48,999
They'll be lynched by
their own fathers...

1189
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,601
who brought them up
to be rogues.

1190
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:57,267
Are you dubious about
how I would do this?

1191
01:11:58,767 --> 01:12:00,067
Shall I show you a sample?

1192
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,734
In five seconds, that collector
will come in search of you.

1193
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:07,367
He'll say his son is missing.

1194
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:09,000
Will you believe me then?

1195
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:11,801
One...

1196
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Two...

1197
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:17,234
Three...

1198
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,000
Sarangan. Sir.

1199
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,167
Good luck.

1200
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:24,667
Subash.

1201
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:27,133
Hey, my son is missing.

1202
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:28,767
Sir, Bhuvan hasn't come here.

1203
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:29,734
Where is my son?

1204
01:12:29,735 --> 01:12:31,100
I got a message that he is here.

1205
01:12:36,367 --> 01:12:36,934
I don't know.

1206
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:38,400
The message conveys
he is with you.

1207
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:43,334
Hey, my son.

1208
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,399
It's the car parking
of this building.

1209
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,567
What are you saying?

1210
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:56,467
Oh, no...

1211
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Oh, no...

1212
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:58,634
Oh, god!

1213
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,467
Bhuvan!

1214
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,300
My son!

1215
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,300
Bhuvan!

1216
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:28,400
Bhuvan!

1217
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:29,667
He's burning.

1218
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:30,733
Open the door. Sarangan!

1219
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:31,100
Sarangan!

1220
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:32,200
Save him. Open the door.

1221
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:32,934
Go away. Save my son.

1222
01:13:32,934 --> 01:13:33,834
Save him.

1223
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:34,767
Go away, sir.

1224
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:36,099
Save him. Sir, you come here.

1225
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,100
Sir, don't...

1226
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:40,334
Sir, don't...

1227
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:40,801
Sir, come.

1228
01:13:40,801 --> 01:13:41,367
Dad...

1229
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:42,467
Sir, don't go.

1230
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:42,868
Sir, come.

1231
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:43,567
Come, sir.

1232
01:13:43,568 --> 01:13:44,734
Sir, don't.

1233
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:45,767
Dad!

1234
01:13:45,868 --> 01:13:47,466
Go away. My son.

1235
01:13:47,467 --> 01:13:48,834
Go away, sir.

1236
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:49,801
Come.

1237
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:50,801
Sir, come.

1238
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,634
Sir.

1239
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:53,901
Bhuvan!

1240
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:58,367
Oh no...

1241
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,234
Sir,

1242
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:00,234
Listen to me, sir.

1243
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:01,100
Sir,

1244
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:01,868
Please, come.

1245
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:03,434
Dad...

1246
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:07,801
Dad.

1247
01:14:09,534 --> 01:14:10,534
Dad.

1248
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:15,366
Please...

1249
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,200
Sir.

1250
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:17,968
Sir. Drench the fire.

1251
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,934
Drench the fire.

1252
01:14:19,968 --> 01:14:20,734
Come.

1253
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:21,601
Get the water.

1254
01:14:21,801 --> 01:14:22,901
Go.

1255
01:14:23,934 --> 01:14:25,000
Bhuvan! Come, sir.

1256
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,300
Bhuvan!

1257
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:31,033
Look at him.

1258
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,734
He is going.

1259
01:14:34,968 --> 01:14:36,234
He is going.

1260
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:37,634
Catch him.

1261
01:14:38,634 --> 01:14:40,400
Do something.

1262
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:51,433
Five of you are the best officers
of our department.

1263
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:53,834
Do you know why
I've assigned this case to you people?

1264
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,801
The one we're searching for,
was in our department.

1265
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:59,100
He knows our department very well.

1266
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:01,601
He is not an ordinary person.

1267
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,033
After all, a Sub-Inspector...

1268
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:33,868
hit my son, arrested him
and at last killed him.

1269
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,067
My only son...

1270
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:38,834
He is no more.

1271
01:15:42,267 --> 01:15:44,200
Sarangan, why haven't you
arrested him yet?

1272
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,133
We are yet to know about
his whereabouts.

1273
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:50,667
But he knows very well
how the police will search for him.

1274
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,701
For business and to
reach this level...

1275
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:56,132
we have done many evil things.

1276
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,367
That's business.

1277
01:15:57,901 --> 01:15:59,333
It was just for money.

1278
01:15:59,334 --> 01:16:02,267
But, now someone has
threatened the lives of our sons.

1279
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:05,999
I can understand your emotions.

1280
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,434
We're doing this only for you people.

1281
01:16:10,534 --> 01:16:14,267
He wouldn't have thought
that you'd burn his entire family.

1282
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,100
We shouldn't have
underestimated him.

1283
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:19,334
Is he a bigwig...?

1284
01:16:20,067 --> 01:16:21,734
That's the mistake I did.

1285
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:26,868
I left him, thinking he's outbursting
as his whole family has been wiped off.

1286
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,534
Untraceable calls to media.

1287
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,367
Auto delete messages.

1288
01:16:32,133 --> 01:16:33,400
Signal jammers.

1289
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,833
Ethylene gas in the fire extinguisher.

1290
01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:38,999
The silane gas has been
filled in a manner...

1291
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,333
that would trigger fire
on opening the door.

1292
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:43,934
He is not an ordinary
policeman, like you think.

1293
01:16:43,968 --> 01:16:45,666
He's done many crash courses like
hacking technology,

1294
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,700
Investigation and Intelligence management,

1295
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:50,934
Forensic science, and he's well versed
in all intellectual courses.

1296
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:54,167
And most importantly,
everything has been done perfectly...

1297
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:56,500
with precision in time.

1298
01:16:57,133 --> 01:17:01,132
He even told me that he'd make
the fathers kill their own sons.

1299
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:04,534
So, you want us to hide?

1300
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,167
I'm telling you to be careful.

1301
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,200
We are in search of him.

1302
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:09,633
If he comes in search of us,

1303
01:17:09,634 --> 01:17:10,801
Then who are we all?

1304
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:14,567
Listen to what he says.

1305
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,167
Don't create any issue
by doing something on your own.

1306
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,433
Without any evidence
against Subash,

1307
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:22,701
We can't do anything.

1308
01:17:23,434 --> 01:17:25,033
If we take action beyond that,

1309
01:17:25,534 --> 01:17:28,266
The media would hype the news
of the family accident...

1310
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:31,968
saying there's something fishy about it
and the police are hiding it.

1311
01:17:32,467 --> 01:17:33,534
I think you're right.

1312
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,467
Even my lawyer said the same.

1313
01:17:37,901 --> 01:17:39,133
Don't be in a hurry.

1314
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:43,466
First, ask these guys to
give separate complaints...

1315
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:46,334
stating life threats from Subash,
to the Commissioner's office.

1316
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,533
I'll take care of the rest.

1317
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:49,867
Sir, I checked his old flat
and the new house.

1318
01:17:49,868 --> 01:17:51,633
I couldn't get any details.

1319
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:56,400
Sir, we're tracing down his ID,
credit card and bank details.

1320
01:17:56,434 --> 01:17:59,466
Security has been tightened,
so that he won't leave the city.

1321
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,467
No... no...

1322
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:02,634
There is no chance of him
going out of the city.

1323
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:05,366
Because, he's targeting certain people
within the city.

1324
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,901
By protecting them,

1325
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:08,534
We must trap Subash.

1326
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:22,700
Mr.Subash. Yes.

1327
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:24,700
Welcome, sir.
MD is waiting for you.

1328
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,267
Please come. Yeah, bye.

1329
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,667
Hi, Subash.

1330
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:30,834
Hi, Anusha.

1331
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Please, come.

1332
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,267
My wife, Sandhya.

1333
01:18:35,434 --> 01:18:36,500
Hi, hi.

1334
01:18:36,701 --> 01:18:37,434
Take them in.

1335
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:38,467
Come. Yeah.

1336
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:43,367
I'm sorry for your loss.

1337
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,367
Is whatever I asked for, ready?

1338
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:10,299
Subash, if the solution
to murder is murder...

1339
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:13,667
it's like you consuming poison
and expecting them to die.

1340
01:19:16,634 --> 01:19:18,901
This has the details of the game
I spoke about.

1341
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,100
Be ready.

1342
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:24,834
Shall we proceed legally, once?

1343
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,733
At least, for the sake of the child,
you can change your decision.

1344
01:19:28,734 --> 01:19:31,067
I took this decision only
for the sake of that child.

1345
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,834
Whenever I see her,

1346
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:36,400
I think of the other child.

1347
01:19:37,634 --> 01:19:39,801
I'm in angst because
I've still left them alive.

1348
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,300
I must be in Chennai by tonight.

1349
01:19:45,267 --> 01:19:46,601
They'll stay here for a few days.

1350
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:49,067
Take care.

1351
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:50,601
Sure.

1352
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:11,367
In this world, everyone is affected
by someone for some reason.

1353
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:14,234
If everyone decides
to take revenge...

1354
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,201
this world will turn
into a graveyard.

1355
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:22,033
Do you think I'm doing this to
take revenge?

1356
01:20:23,234 --> 01:20:26,967
If it was so, I would've gathered all my
anger...

1357
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:30,701
and lynched them, the day I saw them.

1358
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,334
It's not that!

1359
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:36,167
I joined the department to
punish the offenders.

1360
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,467
But, they're supporting the offenders.

1361
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,901
Then, how would the criminals be afraid?

1362
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:45,834
They'll be afraid, only when
the worst punishment is given.

1363
01:20:46,734 --> 01:20:49,334
They must know, if at fault,
they'll be sheared.

1364
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:52,367
That fear must be created!

1365
01:20:53,968 --> 01:20:56,334
The day a woman can walk freely
on the roads at night...

1366
01:20:56,734 --> 01:21:00,166
is the day of our independence,
is what we have studied, isn't it?

1367
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:03,901
Today, women are afraid of
walking on roads even at day.

1368
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:06,834
Why to say all this?

1369
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,868
Is there any assurance that
it won't happen to you?

1370
01:21:16,767 --> 01:21:21,133
Do you know what he told me
that day about our child?

1371
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:24,867
You must have the fear that
another Parvati is...

1372
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:26,934
growing up at your house.

1373
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:32,300
Now tell me. What should
we do to them?

1374
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:36,634
Tell me, what should
we do to them?

1375
01:21:37,868 --> 01:21:38,934
Kill them, Subash.

1376
01:21:40,701 --> 01:21:41,701
Kill them all.

1377
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,767
With pleasure.

1378
01:22:01,734 --> 01:22:06,000
"See the gloom of the night,."

1379
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:10,233
"It strives to blow you down,."

1380
01:22:10,234 --> 01:22:18,234
"Every moment goes on
searching for a solution."

1381
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:23,766
"It's the clan, knitting the
net of unrighteousness."

1382
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:27,667
"I'm wandering in search of them."

1383
01:22:27,701 --> 01:22:32,099
"The eyes of an eagle in the
hunt for a corpse,."

1384
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:39,100
"Even if that chases me,
"I won't let this pass."

1385
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,433
"The killing fields,."

1386
01:22:56,434 --> 01:22:58,634
"Makes to wander,."

1387
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:01,167
"A battle field,."

1388
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:05,099
"Will respond,."

1389
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,167
"Will be cleared soon,."

1390
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,567
"The evidence is not a phantom,."

1391
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,933
"There are no hindrances,."

1392
01:23:15,934 --> 01:23:17,999
"The evidence is not a phantom,."

1393
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,267
"There are no hindrances,."

1394
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,299
"The illusions get splintered,."

1395
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,833
"The solutions aren't so far,."

1396
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,567
"Refuse to submit,."

1397
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,800
"Break the unrighteousness,."

1398
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:33,333
"There is nothing to question.
Go beyond limits and surge up,."

1399
01:23:33,334 --> 01:23:35,067
"Refuse to submit,."

1400
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,266
"Break the unrighteousness,."

1401
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:42,500
"There is nothing to question.
Go beyond limits and surge up."

1402
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:00,968
We miss you, Bhuvan.

1403
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:05,267
Cheers. Cheers.

1404
01:24:08,901 --> 01:24:10,133
Can we believe Sarangan?

1405
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,487
Or else, shall we send our men
to search for him?

1406
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,167
Definitely, we have to do something.

1407
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:17,667
Let's hire some professionals.

1408
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:22,300
Sarangan is more sincere to us
than to the department.

1409
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:24,133
Leave it.

1410
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:27,467
If we do something from our side...

1411
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,868
our reputation will be spoilt.

1412
01:24:31,868 --> 01:24:32,868
Tell me, Mr.Alex.

1413
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:35,634
"The girl who couldn't write the
NEET exam consumed poison and died"

1414
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,267
is the news
we have printed, sir.

1415
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:40,734
So? But, unfortunately
that girl is alive, sir.

1416
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:44,467
If this news spreads out,
it'll be a black mark for our magazine.

1417
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,701
Reputation is important to us.

1418
01:24:47,534 --> 01:24:49,634
Better, make the news come true.
Sir!

1419
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,400
Kill that girl.

1420
01:24:51,701 --> 01:24:53,033
Okay, sir.

1421
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:29,234
Yeah.

1422
01:25:29,235 --> 01:25:31,066
Sir, I'm Gopi speaking
from Cyber crime.

1423
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:31,601
Tell me.

1424
01:25:31,602 --> 01:25:33,922
Actually, Subash's debit card
has been swiped in Bangalore.

1425
01:25:34,133 --> 01:25:35,493
He's definitely in Bangalore, sir.

1426
01:25:35,634 --> 01:25:36,634
Okay.

1427
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:42,933
Subash is in Bangalore.

1428
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:43,944
Are you sure, sir? Yes.

1429
01:25:43,968 --> 01:25:46,299
I've forwarded all the details.
You start immediately to Bangalore.

1430
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:47,300
Okay, sir. Let's move.

1431
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,701
Hey, Deepak.

1432
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:32,934
Hey... No.

1433
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:34,333
Please, stop it. No...

1434
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:35,434
Hey... No.

1435
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:40,499
Please, stop it. No...

1436
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Stop it right now.

1437
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:42,601
Please, stop it. No...

1438
01:26:42,634 --> 01:26:44,666
Hey... don't do that.

1439
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:45,267
Please, stop it. No...

1440
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,067
Hey... hey...
Please... Please...

1441
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,033
No...

1442
01:26:50,034 --> 01:26:51,133
Hey...

1443
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:52,500
It's paining.

1444
01:26:53,534 --> 01:26:54,601
Hey...

1445
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:58,667
Hey, please. Stop it.

1446
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Stop it right now.

1447
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,733
I can't bear this.

1448
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:04,500
Please.

1449
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:06,533
Stop it. Stop it right now.

1450
01:27:06,534 --> 01:27:08,533
Stop...

1451
01:27:08,534 --> 01:27:13,601
Hey, stop it. No.

1452
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,267
You've only one choice.

1453
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,400
In an hour, your friend Christy
must be here.

1454
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:24,200
I don't know how you will
ask him to come here.

1455
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:26,767
But, he must come.

1456
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:28,701
No chance!

1457
01:27:30,033 --> 01:27:32,133
His father won't allow him
to go out of the house.

1458
01:27:35,701 --> 01:27:37,934
Then, you are of no use to me.

1459
01:27:41,267 --> 01:27:44,667
If I take the car in reverse,
your body will split into halves.

1460
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,934
He'll come to see that,
won't he?

1461
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:48,234
Please, no...

1462
01:27:49,334 --> 01:27:50,734
No... No...

1463
01:27:51,067 --> 01:27:52,934
I'll try.

1464
01:27:54,334 --> 01:27:55,334
I'll try.

1465
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:57,334
I'll try. Please.

1466
01:27:57,767 --> 01:27:59,667
Please.

1467
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,667
Hey Deepak, where are you?

1468
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:18,901
Are you okay?

1469
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,534
I created a scene on my own.

1470
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:22,200
And settled alone at a place.

1471
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:24,133
And I just don't trust this police.

1472
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,167
Still, they underestimate Subash.

1473
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:30,868
It's not safe for you also
to be at home.

1474
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:32,234
Just come here, man.

1475
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It's our place!

1476
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,801
But, don't discuss with anyone.

1477
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,499
Just follow the location.

1478
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Okay.

1479
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,968
Sir, there.

1480
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,900
Oh, no.

1481
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:35,267
Go... Go and search.

1482
01:32:23,033 --> 01:32:24,200
Even if you kill me,

1483
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,534
You can't make my son come here.

1484
01:32:36,567 --> 01:32:38,901
If I speak, my son will come,
is it?

1485
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Don't be stupid, I say.

1486
01:32:41,534 --> 01:32:42,814
Tell me, how much money
you want?

1487
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Let's finish this.

1488
01:32:45,234 --> 01:32:46,567
Once... and for all...

1489
01:32:49,567 --> 01:32:50,567
How much will you give?

1490
01:32:51,234 --> 01:32:52,234
Two crores.

1491
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:54,801
That's all?

1492
01:32:55,334 --> 01:32:56,334
Five crores.

1493
01:33:01,267 --> 01:33:03,467
So, the cost of a life
is five crores.

1494
01:33:06,868 --> 01:33:09,567
Hey...

1495
01:33:10,033 --> 01:33:11,634
Phone.

1496
01:33:22,934 --> 01:33:24,634
We just followed their commands.

1497
01:33:25,868 --> 01:33:27,234
We are not aware of anything.

1498
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:28,968
Forgive us, sir.

1499
01:33:29,234 --> 01:33:30,434
Do you have five crores?

1500
01:33:32,133 --> 01:33:33,133
You don't have it, right?

1501
01:33:58,434 --> 01:33:59,133
Yes, dad?

1502
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,634
Christy, start immediately
with five crores.

1503
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:03,333
I'll share the location with you.

1504
01:34:03,334 --> 01:34:04,366
Why at this time, dad?

1505
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:04,968
What happened?

1506
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,334
Do what I say.

1507
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:08,434
I just want to finish all this.

1508
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:09,968
And don't inform anybody.

1509
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,934
Come, soon. Okay, dad.

1510
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,867
If you speak to him,
you think he'll turn up?

1511
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:22,400
I didn't speak.

1512
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:24,999
It was you, who did the talking.

1513
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,701
Yes, dad?

1514
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,133
Christy, start immediately
with five crores.

1515
01:34:28,167 --> 01:34:29,833
I'll share the location with you.

1516
01:34:29,834 --> 01:34:30,867
Why at this time, dad?

1517
01:34:30,868 --> 01:34:31,467
What happened?

1518
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,834
Do what I say.

1519
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:34,968
Hey.
I just want to finish all this.

1520
01:34:35,267 --> 01:34:36,499
And don't inform anybody.

1521
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,434
Come, soon. Okay, dad.

1522
01:34:39,534 --> 01:34:41,700
Hey...

1523
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:42,901
Your son has left.

1524
01:34:42,934 --> 01:34:44,100
Five crores.

1525
01:34:44,934 --> 01:34:47,174
If you had asked me earlier,
I would've thrown it at you.

1526
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,033
Why do you do this drama?

1527
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,701
I know, everything has a
price in this world.

1528
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,133
Dad, where are you?

1529
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:14,767
Dad?

1530
01:35:19,567 --> 01:35:21,300
Christy. What happened?

1531
01:35:21,334 --> 01:35:22,234
This is a trap.

1532
01:35:22,234 --> 01:35:23,133
Christy. Go away.

1533
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,900
Christy go away.

1534
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:28,099
Christy, why did you come? Dad.

1535
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,367
Who did this to you?

1536
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,566
Subash is here, you go.

1537
01:35:30,567 --> 01:35:33,266
What are you saying, dad?
Go away... go man...

1538
01:35:33,267 --> 01:35:34,434
Christy. Hey.

1539
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:35,734
Christy.

1540
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:40,634
What you said is right.

1541
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:42,367
Everything has a price.

1542
01:35:43,067 --> 01:35:46,968
Your son's life costs
five crores and five hundred rupees.

1543
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:50,032
You take the money.

1544
01:35:50,033 --> 01:35:52,233
I'll take your son's life.

1545
01:35:52,234 --> 01:35:55,066
Hey... No...

1546
01:35:55,067 --> 01:35:56,968
I'll kill you man...

1547
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,666
Christy. Get up.

1548
01:35:58,667 --> 01:36:00,634
Leave my son!

1549
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:03,499
Christy.

1550
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,234
Deepak...

1551
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:08,933
What happened, Deepak!

1552
01:36:08,934 --> 01:36:10,466
Christy.

1553
01:36:10,467 --> 01:36:12,132
Hey, the money has been given.

1554
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:12,968
You must not shout.

1555
01:36:12,969 --> 01:36:15,633
Hey, I'll kill you.

1556
01:36:15,634 --> 01:36:19,901
Leave him alone, man
Leave him alone.

1557
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,234
Leave him.

1558
01:36:28,267 --> 01:36:30,267
Christy.

1559
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:43,267
Muthu, I've shared the location.

1560
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,300
Go there immediately.
Something is not right.

1561
01:36:55,667 --> 01:36:59,333
Inspector, Subash has taken away
my son and Deepak.

1562
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:00,767
Come soon. Hurry up.

1563
01:37:06,968 --> 01:37:10,534
Hey... Sir...

1564
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:13,299
Hey... come soon.

1565
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:16,367
Come soon. Is anyone there?

1566
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,000
Hey...

1567
01:37:35,634 --> 01:37:36,234
What happened?

1568
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,200
Abhijlth is safe... yeah.

1569
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:40,900
If he isn't caught immediately,

1570
01:37:40,901 --> 01:37:42,901
You'll lose your son like me.

1571
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:48,667
Madam, does this person stay here?

1572
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,032
By now, he would've
reached the airport.

1573
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:53,433
Sir, we found the place
where Subash stayed.

1574
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:55,167
For the past two days,
he has stayed here.

1575
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,901
It's confirmed.

1576
01:37:55,902 --> 01:37:57,433
He travelled by road.

1577
01:37:57,434 --> 01:37:59,677
But now, Subash has boarded
the Bangalore to Chennai flight, sir.

1578
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:01,766
Within an hour, he will reach
Chennai airport.

1579
01:38:01,767 --> 01:38:02,767
Okay.

1580
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:05,500
Tell me sir.

1581
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:07,867
In an hour,
Subash will be at the airport.

1582
01:38:07,868 --> 01:38:09,533
Arrest him unofficially.

1583
01:38:09,534 --> 01:38:10,434
Sir, I'll take care.

1584
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:11,734
Hmm... don't miss him.

1585
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:12,767
Okay, sir.

1586
01:38:45,067 --> 01:38:47,387
Without creating any fuss,
get into the vehicle I point at.

1587
01:39:16,834 --> 01:39:19,867
Hey, drop the gun...

1588
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:23,067
Police...

1589
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,366
Two days back, at the premises
of the Joint Commissioner of Police,

1590
01:39:30,367 --> 01:39:33,067
Bhuvan, the son of collector Gnanasekar
died in a fire accident.

1591
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,466
A person was arrested by
the police today...

1592
01:39:35,467 --> 01:39:38,032
as a suspect of planning
the entire accident.

1593
01:39:38,033 --> 01:39:41,700
The arrest at the airport created
chaos among the passengers.

1594
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:44,100
For Sun News...
Mugilan and Akshaya.

1595
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:46,100
A simple job.

1596
01:39:46,334 --> 01:39:47,601
Can't you do that properly?

1597
01:39:48,767 --> 01:39:49,833
We planned it perfectly, sir.

1598
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:51,274
But, before the public...
come on...

1599
01:39:51,934 --> 01:39:52,934
Switch on the recorder.

1600
01:39:59,033 --> 01:40:00,133
He has killed my son.

1601
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:01,887
They are talking to him lethargically.

1602
01:40:02,467 --> 01:40:04,443
You know how the
police treatment will be, don't you?

1603
01:40:04,467 --> 01:40:05,467
Better tell us the truth.

1604
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:07,834
I don't understand.

1605
01:40:08,767 --> 01:40:09,934
Where is Christy and Deepak?

1606
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:11,667
If you ask me,

1607
01:40:11,934 --> 01:40:12,934
How would I know?

1608
01:40:13,267 --> 01:40:14,347
See, how smart he's acting!

1609
01:40:14,434 --> 01:40:16,009
No one will answer,
if asked in this way.

1610
01:40:16,033 --> 01:40:17,810
You've kidnapped
both of them on the same day.

1611
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:19,267
You've burnt five people.

1612
01:40:19,467 --> 01:40:21,307
You shared the location
and escaped from there.

1613
01:40:21,467 --> 01:40:23,734
And you framed
the police for that act.

1614
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,166
Tell me that I started a
new political party,

1615
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:27,777
I'm contesting elections
as an independent.

1616
01:40:27,801 --> 01:40:31,633
I spoilt the country by asking the politicians
to accept bribes, include all this too.

1617
01:40:31,634 --> 01:40:32,901
I'm tired of listening to this.

1618
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:33,701
What?

1619
01:40:33,702 --> 01:40:36,267
We know very well that
you have done this.

1620
01:40:36,634 --> 01:40:38,000
Tell us the truth.

1621
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:40,634
Is there any evidence?

1622
01:40:42,868 --> 01:40:43,868
What's the proof?

1623
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:47,700
Have you come here
qualified or...?

1624
01:40:47,701 --> 01:40:48,701
Subash...

1625
01:40:50,534 --> 01:40:53,100
Sir, when I arrested those guys,

1626
01:40:53,701 --> 01:40:56,367
I couldn't do anything as there
was no evidence.

1627
01:40:57,868 --> 01:41:01,033
Then, my family died in a fire accident.

1628
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:04,733
So, I resigned my police job and
went to Bangalore...

1629
01:41:04,734 --> 01:41:06,774
in search of another job
and returned to Chennai.

1630
01:41:07,767 --> 01:41:10,634
Sir arrested me at the airport
amid high drama.

1631
01:41:11,701 --> 01:41:12,701
That's it.

1632
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:14,399
I don't know anything else.

1633
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,000
Hey, I'll bang you to death.

1634
01:41:16,033 --> 01:41:17,033
Muthu...

1635
01:41:18,934 --> 01:41:19,934
I will...

1636
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:29,801
He is lying.

1637
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:30,834
He's playing some game.

1638
01:41:31,834 --> 01:41:32,834
What's happening here?

1639
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:34,766
Bang him to death.

1640
01:41:34,767 --> 01:41:35,968
What's the use of killing him?

1641
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:39,234
My priority is to know
about Christy and Deepak.

1642
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:44,100
I'll plan how to
kill him after that.

1643
01:41:44,868 --> 01:41:45,868
Sir, yes.

1644
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:48,433
Sir, here is the proof of
Subash's presence in...

1645
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:51,195
an IT company in Bangalore and
the toll gate footage of his travel.

1646
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:52,901
Am I mad?

1647
01:41:54,334 --> 01:41:56,033
He took away both of them
in my presence.

1648
01:41:59,067 --> 01:42:00,567
Where have you kept them both?

1649
01:42:01,133 --> 01:42:03,567
Two people close to you
are missing,

1650
01:42:03,901 --> 01:42:06,267
So you're trying to frame me
as the abductor.

1651
01:42:06,767 --> 01:42:08,434
Are they alive or dead?

1652
01:42:09,968 --> 01:42:11,667
As I promised to you,

1653
01:42:12,067 --> 01:42:13,767
I won't kill anyone.

1654
01:42:14,934 --> 01:42:16,334
So, they're alive.

1655
01:42:17,133 --> 01:42:18,133
I don't know, sir.

1656
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,834
Listen, you are all alone.

1657
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:24,367
That too under my custody.

1658
01:42:24,801 --> 01:42:26,200
You can't do anything.

1659
01:42:28,667 --> 01:42:29,901
I'm alone only.

1660
01:42:30,567 --> 01:42:31,727
But I'm one among the public.

1661
01:42:33,934 --> 01:42:36,267
You have the entire police force.

1662
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:40,100
Do whatever you can. You...

1663
01:42:41,133 --> 01:42:42,133
Sir,

1664
01:42:43,434 --> 01:42:45,154
The fathers want
to speak to him personally.

1665
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Where is my son?

1666
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Where have you kept him?

1667
01:42:58,834 --> 01:42:59,834
He is alive, isn't he?

1668
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:02,667
If anything happens to my son!

1669
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:04,667
What is this, sir?

1670
01:43:05,167 --> 01:43:06,834
Are you selling tickets outside?

1671
01:43:07,334 --> 01:43:09,267
One by one, they're inquiring the same.

1672
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:11,167
It's a torture!

1673
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,334
Cameras are placed here and there...

1674
01:43:22,234 --> 01:43:24,300
JC sir,
ask them to switch off the cameras.

1675
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:26,667
I need to speak to him.

1676
01:43:29,133 --> 01:43:30,400
He is telling you, isn't he?

1677
01:43:39,968 --> 01:43:40,367
Good.

1678
01:43:40,868 --> 01:43:42,628
I'll kill you right here
at this very moment.

1679
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,200
A person can be killed
only once, sir.

1680
01:43:45,968 --> 01:43:47,033
I died long ago.

1681
01:43:48,434 --> 01:43:53,434
But, if I'm even slightly touched,
the two boys would be dead.

1682
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:58,267
If you do what I say,
you'll get back your sons.

1683
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:02,566
He should inform the media that
Bhuvan's death was a fire accident...

1684
01:44:02,567 --> 01:44:07,167
just like how he informed
about my family.

1685
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,300
Bloody, you're asking me
to speak to the media?

1686
01:44:09,334 --> 01:44:11,434
How dare you order me?

1687
01:44:11,901 --> 01:44:12,901
Nonsense...

1688
01:44:13,033 --> 01:44:15,434
I think he isn't concerned
about your son.

1689
01:44:15,934 --> 01:44:16,934
No.

1690
01:44:17,367 --> 01:44:17,968
No.

1691
01:44:18,367 --> 01:44:19,766
I won't speak. What'll you do?

1692
01:44:19,767 --> 01:44:21,133
What'll you do?

1693
01:44:21,167 --> 01:44:24,534
JC sir, I have two ants
in my hand.

1694
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:28,334
If asked whether they are alive
or dead, what'll you say?

1695
01:44:30,334 --> 01:44:32,934
If you say they're dead,
I'll show them alive.

1696
01:44:33,701 --> 01:44:35,434
If you say, they are alive...

1697
01:44:35,767 --> 01:44:39,434
I'll kill them and
show it to you.

1698
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:44,934
So, we both are in not in
a position to question and to respond.

1699
01:44:45,334 --> 01:44:46,701
He is crossing his limits.

1700
01:44:46,934 --> 01:44:48,343
You are crossing your limits,
Subash.

1701
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:50,901
You know who those
ants are, don't you?

1702
01:44:53,767 --> 01:44:56,767
Sarangan sir,
it's my son's life.

1703
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,234
So, let me handle it.

1704
01:45:02,067 --> 01:45:03,067
What else?

1705
01:45:04,667 --> 01:45:05,701
Hey, Muthukaruppan.

1706
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,400
Me...?

1707
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:10,100
Your name is Muthukaruppan,
right?

1708
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:13,234
Get me two packs
of Chicken biryani.

1709
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,868
It's been a long time
since I ate well.

1710
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:20,020
Don't I need to remember
where the guys are?

1711
01:45:23,667 --> 01:45:26,734
I guess, both of them aren't
concerned about your sons.

1712
01:45:28,067 --> 01:45:30,000
Sarangan, please.

1713
01:45:31,834 --> 01:45:32,834
Please.

1714
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:35,000
Muthu, sir.

1715
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:40,234
Hey, don't poison the food.

1716
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,934
The ants would die.

1717
01:45:44,801 --> 01:45:47,400
Also, I want a television
with a big screen.

1718
01:45:48,334 --> 01:45:50,601
I must watch JC's interview.

1719
01:45:53,801 --> 01:45:55,000
Yeah, yes...

1720
01:45:55,801 --> 01:45:58,200
The car fire accident that
happened at this building...

1721
01:45:58,234 --> 01:46:00,833
where the collector's son,
Bhuvan died, requires clarification.

1722
01:46:00,834 --> 01:46:03,834
I wanted to meet you all for that.

1723
01:46:04,367 --> 01:46:06,767
It's a confirmed fire accident.

1724
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:09,234
The forensic report proves that.

1725
01:46:09,868 --> 01:46:11,634
Oil has leaked through
the exhaust pipe.

1726
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:14,000
Octane petrol was used.

1727
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,434
That's why, we couldn't control the
situation when the car caught fire.

1728
01:46:17,467 --> 01:46:19,000
Excuse me, sir.

1729
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,901
May I know why Subash is
under police custody?

1730
01:46:23,567 --> 01:46:25,000
You are? I'm Subash's lawyer.

1731
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:27,567
You have arrested him
at the airport at gun point.

1732
01:46:27,901 --> 01:46:29,434
Under what case has he been arrested?

1733
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:30,499
Which section?

1734
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,701
FIR details?

1735
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,700
Even if not for the media,

1736
01:46:33,701 --> 01:46:35,234
You ought to answer me.

1737
01:46:36,067 --> 01:46:39,601
We suspect him of
kidnapping two people.

1738
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:40,941
Interrogation is going on.

1739
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:42,968
Is this the interrogation?

1740
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:48,701
Is he alive or not?

1741
01:46:49,067 --> 01:46:49,834
I want to see him.

1742
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:51,934
He'll be produced at court, tomorrow.

1743
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:53,968
Whatever it is, you can
meet him there.

1744
01:46:55,334 --> 01:46:57,399
My friend is a lawyer.

1745
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,901
She's headstrong.

1746
01:46:59,367 --> 01:47:00,968
Muthu, yes, sir.

1747
01:47:01,434 --> 01:47:03,167
Media has become aware.

1748
01:47:03,534 --> 01:47:05,767
We have to handle this
case carefully, hereafter.

1749
01:47:06,033 --> 01:47:10,299
Produce him at court tomorrow
and get permission to interrogate...

1750
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,734
under our custody for a week.

1751
01:47:11,767 --> 01:47:12,267
Okay, sir.

1752
01:47:12,268 --> 01:47:14,667
Let me see how this
bloody fellow escapes.

1753
01:47:17,767 --> 01:47:18,767
Tell me now.

1754
01:47:19,033 --> 01:47:20,133
Where is my son?

1755
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,434
Where is my son Deepak?

1756
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:26,400
Whose son should be found out first?

1757
01:47:26,567 --> 01:47:28,132
Deepak... My son,

1758
01:47:28,133 --> 01:47:29,234
My son, Deepak. Christy...

1759
01:47:29,267 --> 01:47:30,634
Don't fight.

1760
01:47:32,567 --> 01:47:33,727
I'll give you both, a number.

1761
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:36,968
Whoever gets the line first,
is the winner.

1762
01:47:44,567 --> 01:47:45,807
You've given only nine numbers.

1763
01:47:46,234 --> 01:47:47,968
At least, find out the rest.

1764
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:56,533
Deepak, dad here.

1765
01:47:56,534 --> 01:47:57,367
What? Dad!

1766
01:47:57,368 --> 01:47:59,801
Hey, I've been searching for you
all these days.

1767
01:48:00,234 --> 01:48:02,354
You orphaned me when I was
five years old, didn't you?

1768
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:03,601
Shit. Wrong number.

1769
01:48:05,734 --> 01:48:06,234
Christy.

1770
01:48:06,235 --> 01:48:07,800
Hello Christy?

1771
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:10,132
Hello, ask me directly for an escort.
Who's Christy?

1772
01:48:10,133 --> 01:48:11,133
Shit.

1773
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:28,234
Hello.

1774
01:48:28,567 --> 01:48:29,567
Christy,

1775
01:48:30,067 --> 01:48:31,434
Christy, dad here.

1776
01:48:32,167 --> 01:48:33,734
Hey, is it you?

1777
01:48:33,767 --> 01:48:35,666
Hey, where is my son, Deepak?
Christy, it's me... dad.

1778
01:48:35,667 --> 01:48:36,667
He is the winner.

1779
01:48:36,767 --> 01:48:37,767
Christy, first.

1780
01:48:38,234 --> 01:48:41,234
Christy, it's dad speaking. Believe me.
Give it to me.

1781
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:43,067
Hey, Christy.

1782
01:48:43,234 --> 01:48:43,767
Uncle?

1783
01:48:43,834 --> 01:48:45,701
Christy, don't panic.

1784
01:48:46,133 --> 01:48:47,534
Uncle, I thought it was Subash.

1785
01:48:47,567 --> 01:48:48,334
Tell me, where you are?

1786
01:48:48,567 --> 01:48:49,733
Tell me, where you are?
I don't know where I am.

1787
01:48:49,734 --> 01:48:50,814
Christy... Christy... hey.

1788
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:54,100
Give the phone to him.

1789
01:48:56,634 --> 01:48:57,634
Christy, dad.

1790
01:48:58,767 --> 01:48:59,933
Dad, I'm afraid.

1791
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:01,499
Don't be afraid. Where are you?

1792
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,499
Ask him to follow only
what I say.

1793
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,500
Follow only what I say.

1794
01:49:05,234 --> 01:49:06,601
It's very gloomy here, dad.

1795
01:49:06,868 --> 01:49:08,300
Ask him to clap twice.

1796
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,567
Clap twice.

1797
01:49:10,734 --> 01:49:11,734
Clap...!

1798
01:49:15,834 --> 01:49:17,434
Dad, the lights are on now.

1799
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:21,033
Ask him whether Deepak is there?

1800
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,580
A red colour bag would be there.

1801
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,520
Ask him to take that and
do what I say.

1802
01:49:25,801 --> 01:49:27,701
If he tries to do
anything smart,

1803
01:49:28,334 --> 01:49:29,701
He will be dead the next moment.

1804
01:49:30,234 --> 01:49:31,968
Is there a red colour bag?

1805
01:49:32,868 --> 01:49:33,868
Yes, dad.

1806
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:35,701
Go out with that.

1807
01:49:38,567 --> 01:49:39,968
The door has a number lock, dad.

1808
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,200
Number lock?

1809
01:49:41,234 --> 01:49:43,601
That is '4455'

1810
01:49:43,901 --> 01:49:45,133
4455

1811
01:49:45,734 --> 01:49:46,968
4455

1812
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,400
The door opened, dad.

1813
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,500
Where are you?

1814
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:54,334
Somewhere near the airport, dad.

1815
01:49:54,634 --> 01:49:56,234
Ask him to go to the airport
immediately.

1816
01:49:57,133 --> 01:49:58,667
My fiancee Anitha
will come there.

1817
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:00,700
Don't hang up, until I ask you.

1818
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,061
You go to the airport immediately.

1819
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,367
Muthu, you be here.

1820
01:50:08,467 --> 01:50:10,334
Check all the departing flights
from now.

1821
01:50:11,734 --> 01:50:14,233
Check the IDs also to find out
the destination of the tickets...

1822
01:50:14,234 --> 01:50:15,514
booked in the name of Anitha.

1823
01:50:21,534 --> 01:50:22,877
Christy, have you entered
the airport?

1824
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:23,901
Where are you?

1825
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:25,334
I'm near gate 3, dad.

1826
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,634
Ask him to go to gate 1.

1827
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,734
I have come near gate 1, dad.

1828
01:50:31,067 --> 01:50:32,566
What next? Tell us.

1829
01:50:32,567 --> 01:50:37,100
There is an ID card and a flight ticket
for him on the side of the bag.

1830
01:50:37,133 --> 01:50:40,901
Ask him to show that to
security and enter through gate 1.

1831
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,200
I have come inside, dad.

1832
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:42,734
What should be done now?

1833
01:50:42,735 --> 01:50:44,934
Ask him to wait at the
check-in counter for Anitha.

1834
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:49,667
Ask him to hand over
the bag to her and leave.

1835
01:50:58,334 --> 01:50:59,200
Have you come inside?

1836
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,200
Yes, dad.

1837
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,733
Check whether anyone
is following you.

1838
01:51:01,734 --> 01:51:02,734
No, dad.

1839
01:51:02,934 --> 01:51:04,543
The police and public are
near you, aren't they?

1840
01:51:04,567 --> 01:51:05,567
They are dad.

1841
01:51:06,133 --> 01:51:08,367
So, you're safe!

1842
01:51:09,367 --> 01:51:10,367
You stay there.

1843
01:51:10,467 --> 01:51:12,234
Within ten minutes, our guys will
be there.

1844
01:51:12,267 --> 01:51:13,267
Okay, dad.

1845
01:51:15,267 --> 01:51:16,367
You are making a mistake.

1846
01:51:16,801 --> 01:51:18,466
With my help, you made my son...

1847
01:51:18,467 --> 01:51:19,734
wander like a dog.

1848
01:51:19,767 --> 01:51:21,299
I'm not going to leave you.

1849
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,567
Listen to me. Hey, stop it.

1850
01:51:23,901 --> 01:51:25,421
Why should I listen to you, hereafter?

1851
01:51:25,934 --> 01:51:27,467
My son is safe at the airport.

1852
01:51:27,901 --> 01:51:29,400
Dad, whatever happens...

1853
01:51:29,868 --> 01:51:30,868
Don't leave him.

1854
01:51:30,869 --> 01:51:31,934
Kill him there.

1855
01:51:37,234 --> 01:51:38,234
Christy...

1856
01:51:39,234 --> 01:51:39,667
Christy...

1857
01:51:39,934 --> 01:51:40,667
What's that sound?

1858
01:51:40,701 --> 01:51:41,701
What's that beep sound?

1859
01:51:42,901 --> 01:51:44,901
Christy, what are you doing?

1860
01:51:45,868 --> 01:51:46,948
Talk to me, man. Christy...

1861
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:48,300
Christy...

1862
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:49,908
Christy, what's happening?

1863
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,200
Christy...

1864
01:51:52,801 --> 01:51:53,801
Hey...

1865
01:51:54,267 --> 01:51:55,267
Hey, Christy...

1866
01:52:01,033 --> 01:52:03,700
Drop the gun...

1867
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:04,701
Christy...

1868
01:52:05,834 --> 01:52:06,834
Hey...

1869
01:52:08,701 --> 01:52:09,534
Drop the gun...

1870
01:52:09,535 --> 01:52:11,634
I said put the gun down...

1871
01:52:11,667 --> 01:52:15,267
Drop the gun...

1872
01:52:19,133 --> 01:52:19,701
Christy!

1873
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:20,300
Sir.

1874
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:21,534
Christy! What happened?

1875
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:22,367
What happened?

1876
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:23,701
Hey, Christy!

1877
01:52:24,834 --> 01:52:26,167
Talk to me, man. Hey, Christy.

1878
01:52:26,667 --> 01:52:27,667
Christy!

1879
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,601
Hey, Christy.

1880
01:52:31,167 --> 01:52:32,199
Flash news...

1881
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:35,734
Gun shooting at Chennai airport.
One dead.

1882
01:52:35,767 --> 01:52:36,833
They killed him...

1883
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:37,834
A young man, entered the domestic
terminal of the airport with a gun.

1884
01:52:37,835 --> 01:52:41,067
I already told you
to listen to me.

1885
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:44,167
Now see, you've killed
your own son.

1886
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,100
Francis...

1887
01:52:48,133 --> 01:52:48,801
Hey, get me the water. Sir.

1888
01:52:48,802 --> 01:52:50,834
Hey, get me the water. Sir.

1889
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,901
Hey!

1890
01:53:01,367 --> 01:53:03,968
Even after the warning
of the CISF soldiers...

1891
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,366
without obliging, he fired the gun.

1892
01:53:06,367 --> 01:53:10,801
As a defensive step,
he was shot dead.

1893
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,500
You saw that?

1894
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,100
This is also Subash's plan.

1895
01:53:17,033 --> 01:53:18,393
I can't keep quiet
even after this.

1896
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,500
He is under police custody.

1897
01:53:21,234 --> 01:53:22,274
How could've he done that?

1898
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,733
Why did Christy go to the
airport with a gun?

1899
01:53:25,734 --> 01:53:26,767
You don't get it.

1900
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:29,367
He is not a fool to
go to the airport with a gun.

1901
01:53:33,634 --> 01:53:38,533
My lord, SI Subash has dealt
an unrelated case in which...

1902
01:53:38,534 --> 01:53:41,534
he had arrested four guys
and locked them up.

1903
01:53:41,801 --> 01:53:44,367
In fact, he even threatened
to kill them.

1904
01:53:44,734 --> 01:53:48,601
We suspect that he kidnapped
two of them and killed one.

1905
01:53:48,901 --> 01:53:51,601
We still aren't aware of the other
person's whereabouts.

1906
01:53:51,834 --> 01:53:54,399
Until we get back Deepak alive,
grant us permission...

1907
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,767
to interrogate him under
police custody, for a week.

1908
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:00,241
This is my sincere request, my lord.

1909
01:54:00,434 --> 01:54:01,434
You?

1910
01:54:03,133 --> 01:54:05,834
Lord, everything is dubious
for the public prosecutor.

1911
01:54:05,868 --> 01:54:08,901
They've fixed in their minds that
Bhuvan was killed by Subash.

1912
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,968
They arrested Subash in the airport
like a terrorist.

1913
01:54:12,067 --> 01:54:15,167
But, after an hour,
Joint Commissioner Sarangan sir...

1914
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,567
informs the media that
it was an accident.

1915
01:54:17,868 --> 01:54:20,700
Then, they claim he kidnapped
two other people.

1916
01:54:20,701 --> 01:54:23,366
One of them was caught at
the airport with a gun.

1917
01:54:23,367 --> 01:54:25,701
So, the CISF soldiers shot him dead.

1918
01:54:26,067 --> 01:54:27,634
That was yesterday's breaking news.

1919
01:54:27,934 --> 01:54:31,667
Now, they're asking for police custody
again for the sake of another person.

1920
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:36,299
It's clear that the police department
has other motives.

1921
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:38,968
So, I request you not to
grant police custody.

1922
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,834
My Lord, here are the flight ticket and video footage
evidences of Subash's trip to Bangalore and Chennai.

1923
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,334
I want the right evidence for everything.

1924
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:51,634
No proof is given on your favour.

1925
01:54:52,067 --> 01:54:54,834
First, search for the guy
who went missing.

1926
01:54:54,868 --> 01:54:55,934
That's your duty.

1927
01:54:56,033 --> 01:54:58,901
Then, to interrogate him,
not a week...

1928
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,734
I'll give you just one day.

1929
01:55:02,133 --> 01:55:03,400
You shouldn't hit him.

1930
01:55:03,634 --> 01:55:04,234
Understood?

1931
01:55:04,267 --> 01:55:04,667
What?

1932
01:55:04,667 --> 01:55:05,667
Okay, madam.

1933
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,740
You think I'll leave you,
if the judge orders not to hit?

1934
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:13,033
Even if I kill you,
I know how to handle it.

1935
01:55:14,767 --> 01:55:16,634
I'll give you an hour.

1936
01:55:17,534 --> 01:55:19,634
If possible, save the other guy.

1937
01:55:30,033 --> 01:55:31,033
Hey...

1938
01:55:31,334 --> 01:55:31,667
Hey...

1939
01:55:31,934 --> 01:55:33,500
Deepak.

1940
01:55:35,834 --> 01:55:36,834
Deepak!

1941
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,434
Sir... sir... Deepak's video.

1942
01:55:58,567 --> 01:56:00,300
Sir, we're unable to track this.

1943
01:56:02,601 --> 01:56:04,321
Wonder what Cyber crime experts
you all are!

1944
01:56:04,467 --> 01:56:06,499
Who'll find out then,
if you aren't able to do?

1945
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,166
This programme seems to be
very complicated, sir.

1946
01:56:08,167 --> 01:56:09,944
We can source some
illegal hackers and try it.

1947
01:56:09,968 --> 01:56:11,901
Legal or illegal,
I just want it.

1948
01:56:11,934 --> 01:56:13,033
Just do it I say.

1949
01:56:15,567 --> 01:56:17,566
Welcome sir, look at
what he is doing.

1950
01:56:17,567 --> 01:56:18,567
Look at him.

1951
01:56:18,968 --> 01:56:21,067
Sir, hackers. Oh, okay.

1952
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,100
Just take them there.

1953
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,567
In our country, rape has
become a daily news.

1954
01:56:50,934 --> 01:56:52,933
Everyone updates their status
on social media that the law...

1955
01:56:52,934 --> 01:56:55,633
must be stringent against rape.

1956
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:58,800
Saying, we would kill
the criminals if we get them...

1957
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:01,300
and we would
hang them in public,

1958
01:57:01,334 --> 01:57:02,534
Is just what we keep saying.

1959
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:06,467
Those who said that are being given
a chance now.

1960
01:57:06,834 --> 01:57:11,067
One of the criminals, who raped and
murdered many girls is in front of you now.

1961
01:57:11,901 --> 01:57:13,901
Listen to his confession.

1962
01:57:14,167 --> 01:57:15,167
Christy, myself,

1963
01:57:16,367 --> 01:57:17,601
Bhuvan and Abhijith...

1964
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,601
We have raped and
killed many girls.

1965
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:24,334
Recently, we murdered Parvati also.

1966
01:57:24,868 --> 01:57:26,233
It'll be over if we trace
this IP address.

1967
01:57:26,234 --> 01:57:28,968
If you are ready to punish him,
click the link below.

1968
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,233
No one can track
or read your IP address.

1969
01:57:32,234 --> 01:57:34,767
I've sent you the link of a game.
Check immediately.

1970
01:57:35,033 --> 01:57:36,313
Okay. Share it with everyone.

1971
01:57:38,467 --> 01:57:40,167
You would've got the
link of a game.

1972
01:57:40,667 --> 01:57:41,667
Play that game.

1973
01:57:42,167 --> 01:57:44,376
We can punish the culprit
who killed our daughter, on our own.

1974
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,667
We've got the chance
to punish a rapist.

1975
01:57:53,033 --> 01:57:54,867
I have sent you the
link of a game.

1976
01:57:54,868 --> 01:57:55,944
Download and play
that immediately.

1977
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:58,067
Please share this
on all social media.

1978
01:58:02,567 --> 01:58:04,300
Oh, no! What happened?

1979
01:58:04,567 --> 01:58:06,047
The link has started
to spread to all.

1980
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,033
I don't think these people
can do this.

1981
01:58:08,067 --> 01:58:10,766
JC, I don't mind spending
even crores of money,

1982
01:58:10,767 --> 01:58:12,934
I can get somebody from
abroad to do this.

1983
01:58:13,701 --> 01:58:15,199
Don't you have common sense, sir?

1984
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:16,200
Excuse me? What?

1985
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,367
Do you know what gas is
set beside your son?

1986
01:58:19,234 --> 01:58:21,234
Hydrofluorosilicic acid
with potassium lye.

1987
01:58:21,868 --> 01:58:24,400
By the time, you call the
international hacker and explain...

1988
01:58:24,634 --> 01:58:27,234
your son's body will melt
due to the gas flow.

1989
01:58:27,968 --> 01:58:29,009
They've set this game
in such a way that...

1990
01:58:29,033 --> 01:58:31,200
the gas would leak while
we play and he'd die.

1991
01:58:31,434 --> 01:58:33,500
He has raped and
killed many girls.

1992
01:58:33,534 --> 01:58:37,234
When given a chance of killing him
online, why should I deny it?

1993
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,366
Oh, god! The public has started
playing the game.

1994
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,467
The gas flow has started.

1995
01:58:47,701 --> 01:58:49,399
If you can't find the location,

1996
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,934
At least, block the website.

1997
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,734
Sir, the IP address is changing
every twenty seconds.

1998
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,466
Whoever logs in, the website reflects
that IP address as its own.

1999
01:58:57,467 --> 01:59:00,734
By giving technical excuses,
you're telling me you can't find him?

2000
01:59:01,167 --> 01:59:03,434
Sir, he has done this with
the same technology.

2001
01:59:03,701 --> 01:59:06,300
In this technological world,
an expert can do whatever he wants.

2002
01:59:06,767 --> 01:59:09,100
It's not possible for him
to do this alone.

2003
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:12,100
It's possible only
if someone helps.

2004
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,434
I know how to make him speak.

2005
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:29,701
You know all his plans.

2006
01:59:31,167 --> 01:59:32,267
Tell me where Deepak is.

2007
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,500
I don't know.

2008
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,300
Muthu. Okay, sir.

2009
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:57,166
I'll tell, Please.

2010
01:59:57,167 --> 01:59:58,033
Don't hit him.

2011
01:59:58,033 --> 01:59:59,033
Please sir.

2012
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:00,300
Sir, please.

2013
02:00:02,267 --> 02:00:02,634
No.

2014
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,366
Your life is more important to me...

2015
02:00:04,367 --> 02:00:06,234
than someone's death.

2016
02:00:06,634 --> 02:00:07,634
I'm sorry.

2017
02:00:07,968 --> 02:00:09,133
Anitha, listen to me.

2018
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,300
Anitha...

2019
02:00:13,801 --> 02:00:15,743
As soon as you know the
whereabouts of Deepak, inform me.

2020
02:00:15,767 --> 02:00:16,767
Okay, sir.

2021
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,900
I'll tell you what should be
done to her.

2022
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:29,333
Nobody can play this game if we disconnect
the entire city's internet, am I right?

2023
02:00:29,334 --> 02:00:31,910
It's programmed in such a way, if the
current login strength is interrupted...

2024
02:00:31,934 --> 02:00:34,300
the entire gas would release.

2025
02:00:34,801 --> 02:00:37,199
At least, find out
who is helping him.

2026
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,367
That's what I'm trying, sir.

2027
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:39,801
I will find him.

2028
02:00:57,434 --> 02:00:58,834
It's a great place.

2029
02:00:59,367 --> 02:01:00,367
Is this the building?

2030
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:02,687
If we shout, nobody can hear us.
Come... come...

2031
02:01:02,901 --> 02:01:04,667
How many more floors.
Which side?

2032
02:01:04,701 --> 02:01:05,701
This side or that?

2033
02:01:05,901 --> 02:01:06,834
Which side?

2034
02:01:06,868 --> 02:01:09,067
Did you notice how
his blood pressure is rising?

2035
02:01:09,334 --> 02:01:10,900
You've brought him
to the 6th floor.

2036
02:01:10,901 --> 02:01:12,900
You should've finished him
on the ground floor.

2037
02:01:12,901 --> 02:01:14,621
Hey, go and search on that side.
Okay, sir.

2038
02:01:14,701 --> 02:01:16,101
I'm asking you, which side?
Tell me.

2039
02:01:37,434 --> 02:01:38,434
Hey, Deepak.

2040
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:41,200
Hey, open the door.

2041
02:01:41,701 --> 02:01:44,033
Hey, open it.

2042
02:01:44,567 --> 02:01:45,801
Open it.

2043
02:01:45,834 --> 02:01:46,834
See, what I'll do now.

2044
02:01:55,367 --> 02:01:56,367
Hey...

2045
02:01:59,567 --> 02:02:00,567
This is a crime.

2046
02:02:00,601 --> 02:02:01,666
I'm not going to play this.

2047
02:02:01,667 --> 02:02:03,243
Will you say this
if it happened to your sister?

2048
02:02:03,267 --> 02:02:05,707
Why are you prying into that, brother?
Shut your trap and go.

2049
02:02:18,968 --> 02:02:22,534
They should be punished in public,
like in Iran and Iraq.

2050
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,333
Sir, by any chance,

2051
02:02:28,334 --> 02:02:31,333
if we get a 10 second gap,

2052
02:02:31,334 --> 02:02:34,234
That is, if there are no players
for ten seconds...

2053
02:02:34,601 --> 02:02:36,934
I can track where the IP address
is active.

2054
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,467
This is our only way, sir.

2055
02:02:43,033 --> 02:02:44,777
Hey, glutton...
Instead of talking, do something.

2056
02:02:44,801 --> 02:02:46,333
Wait, I'll save you somehow, sir.

2057
02:02:46,334 --> 02:02:47,267
I'm searching for an object.

2058
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,333
Search for a big object.
Wait, sir.

2059
02:02:48,334 --> 02:02:49,601
I got it, sir. You got it!

2060
02:02:49,834 --> 02:02:50,434
Wait, sir.

2061
02:02:50,467 --> 02:02:51,633
Take it and open.

2062
02:02:51,634 --> 02:02:53,200
Please, do something to open it.

2063
02:02:53,467 --> 02:02:54,666
Do something and open it.

2064
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:55,667
Hey, Ramdass.

2065
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,868
I'm coming...

2066
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:58,199
If I come out, I'll thrash you.

2067
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,868
Sir, am I cleaning my ears?

2068
02:03:00,901 --> 02:03:01,976
I'm trying to open the door.

2069
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,234
Hey,
wait, I'll get some policemen, sir.

2070
02:03:04,601 --> 02:03:07,000
Sarangan.
Don't worry, we'll get him.

2071
02:03:07,033 --> 02:03:09,534
Sir, shall I talk to Subash?

2072
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:14,834
Okay, sir.

2073
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,720
What you're doing is
not right, Subash.

2074
02:03:23,667 --> 02:03:26,567
Aren't you anguished of
doing such a brutal murder?

2075
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,667
I feel anguished, sir.

2076
02:03:31,267 --> 02:03:35,367
I challenged that those four guys
would be killed by their fathers.

2077
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,033
Criminals who rape innocent girls,

2078
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:42,000
And take videos of them and enjoy...

2079
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:47,000
couldn't be killed by me.
That's why I'm anguished.

2080
02:03:48,701 --> 02:03:49,701
Chandran, sir.

2081
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,900
Whatever you plan,
at the end of the day...

2082
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:53,643
you are under my custody.
Don't forget that.

2083
02:03:53,667 --> 02:03:55,100
I'm under your custody only.

2084
02:03:56,033 --> 02:03:57,901
I'm safe under your custody.

2085
02:03:59,067 --> 02:04:00,734
Anitha is also safe.

2086
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:04,766
But, do you know whether your
daughter is safe at your house?

2087
02:04:04,767 --> 02:04:06,467
Hey, what do you mean?

2088
02:04:06,901 --> 02:04:10,766
A teenage girl... I heard that
some video has come...

2089
02:04:10,767 --> 02:04:12,334
Hey, Subash.

2090
02:04:12,767 --> 02:04:14,834
Your daughter is precious to you,

2091
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:17,868
But, other girls are crap to you.
Sir...

2092
02:04:18,934 --> 02:04:20,166
Hey, what did you do to her?

2093
02:04:20,167 --> 02:04:22,067
What can I do?
I'm under your custody.

2094
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:24,132
But, if you don't go to
your house in ten minutes...

2095
02:04:24,133 --> 02:04:25,373
you can't see your daughter.

2096
02:04:34,968 --> 02:04:36,901
Hey, what did you do?

2097
02:04:37,968 --> 02:04:38,968
What did you do?

2098
02:04:39,968 --> 02:04:41,200
Just ten minutes!

2099
02:04:41,434 --> 02:04:42,434
Subash!

2100
02:04:44,234 --> 02:04:45,234
Sarangan.

2101
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:46,300
Sarangan.

2102
02:04:54,167 --> 02:04:55,601
Yes, I got the address, sir.

2103
02:04:55,634 --> 02:04:56,634
Give me the address.

2104
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:57,968
Give me the address.

2105
02:04:57,969 --> 02:04:59,534
Building no.11,
near Siruseri, OMR.

2106
02:05:23,334 --> 02:05:24,334
Appu!

2107
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,467
Appu! I'm coming, wait.

2108
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,280
Where is Appu? What happened?

2109
02:05:27,467 --> 02:05:28,533
Appu! What happened?

2110
02:05:28,534 --> 02:05:29,867
Appu! Tell me what happened?

2111
02:05:29,868 --> 02:05:30,467
Appu!

2112
02:05:30,734 --> 02:05:31,834
Why are you tensed?

2113
02:05:31,868 --> 02:05:33,934
Appu, where is your phone?
It's here, dad.

2114
02:05:33,968 --> 02:05:35,634
Then, why didn't you
attend the call?

2115
02:05:35,801 --> 02:05:37,399
Your phone is not reachable.
I didn't receive any call.

2116
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,400
Any problem?

2117
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,400
Oh, my god! Dad...

2118
02:05:41,734 --> 02:05:42,968
This game is a crime.

2119
02:05:43,367 --> 02:05:44,867
Do you want to be a
part of this killing?

2120
02:05:44,868 --> 02:05:45,634
Do you know?

2121
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:46,500
I know what I'm doing.

2122
02:05:46,501 --> 02:05:50,767
Dad, if I was in the video instead of
that girl, would you break the laptop?

2123
02:05:50,801 --> 02:05:52,334
Just one honest answer, daddy.

2124
02:05:52,968 --> 02:05:53,634
Appu.

2125
02:05:53,834 --> 02:05:54,367
Appu.

2126
02:05:54,368 --> 02:05:56,534
Hey Appu, wait...
Tell me what happened?

2127
02:06:16,968 --> 02:06:19,033
We have decoded your encryption.

2128
02:06:20,467 --> 02:06:24,400
Can't we login for ten seconds
by breaching the security walls?

2129
02:06:24,968 --> 02:06:26,376
When you had planned it
brilliantly...

2130
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,601
you shouldn't have given
that ten second loophole.

2131
02:06:29,434 --> 02:06:30,801
Operation success.

2132
02:06:31,801 --> 02:06:34,367
But, patient dead.

2133
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,367
Shit. What happened?

2134
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,960
He has hacked all the
systems here, sir.

2135
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:49,033
Sir, tell them to not
go near that spot.

2136
02:06:53,133 --> 02:06:54,968
Tell them to not
go near the glass box.

2137
02:07:00,634 --> 02:07:01,634
Deepak!

2138
02:07:03,167 --> 02:07:04,167
Deepak!

2139
02:07:04,667 --> 02:07:05,667
Deepak!

2140
02:07:14,133 --> 02:07:17,067
Deepak!

2141
02:07:18,767 --> 02:07:19,967
Sir, save me.

2142
02:07:19,968 --> 02:07:20,734
Deepak!

2143
02:07:20,767 --> 02:07:22,833
Deepak!

2144
02:07:22,834 --> 02:07:23,267
Sir...

2145
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:26,167
Hey, come here and save my son.

2146
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,868
Deepak!

2147
02:07:38,133 --> 02:07:39,968
Sir, no. Don't hit the box.

2148
02:07:43,534 --> 02:07:45,634
Deepak!

2149
02:07:57,334 --> 02:07:58,334
He killed!

2150
02:07:58,667 --> 02:07:59,667
He killed!

2151
02:07:59,934 --> 02:08:01,834
He has killed all, as he said.

2152
02:08:02,167 --> 02:08:03,167
I'm the only one left.

2153
02:08:03,267 --> 02:08:04,267
He'll kill me too.

2154
02:08:05,701 --> 02:08:06,734
Abhijith.

2155
02:08:07,067 --> 02:08:08,067
Just do something.

2156
02:08:13,934 --> 02:08:14,334
Hello.

2157
02:08:14,701 --> 02:08:17,133
Being under police custody,
he is killing everyone.

2158
02:08:17,667 --> 02:08:19,000
You couldn't do anything.

2159
02:08:19,667 --> 02:08:21,234
I know what to do with him.

2160
02:08:22,434 --> 02:08:24,934
Clear his case and let him out.

2161
02:08:25,267 --> 02:08:26,300
I'll take over.

2162
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,968
I'm not working for you,
to listen to whatever you say.

2163
02:08:31,033 --> 02:08:32,467
You don't order me.

2164
02:08:39,267 --> 02:08:40,267
Hello, Commissioner sir.

2165
02:08:45,234 --> 02:08:46,601
You'll never change.

2166
02:08:47,033 --> 02:08:49,734
You have to arrest only
if there is evidence.

2167
02:08:50,033 --> 02:08:53,634
Nowadays, you arrest a person
and then look out for evidence.

2168
02:08:53,667 --> 02:08:55,534
Leave now.
Simply, wasting the court's time.

2169
02:09:09,267 --> 02:09:10,267
JC sir.

2170
02:09:11,234 --> 02:09:11,667
Chandran,

2171
02:09:11,668 --> 02:09:12,988
Sir. Give the phone to Subash.

2172
02:09:14,234 --> 02:09:15,234
Speak.

2173
02:09:17,734 --> 02:09:18,467
Tell me.

2174
02:09:18,468 --> 02:09:20,548
Don't think that you've escaped
without any evidence.

2175
02:09:21,267 --> 02:09:22,907
It's safe for you to remain
under custody.

2176
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:26,467
The case has been closed, just to
get you out and end your life.

2177
02:09:27,267 --> 02:09:29,767
They've planned to lynch you
at court itself.

2178
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,534
I suggest, just be careful.

2179
02:09:34,067 --> 02:09:36,467
I appreciate your thought
of helping me, sir.

2180
02:09:39,067 --> 02:09:40,067
You go.

2181
02:09:43,234 --> 02:09:44,234
Subash.

2182
02:09:44,934 --> 02:09:45,934
I'll take care.

2183
02:10:11,734 --> 02:10:12,734
You're no more!

2184
02:10:12,934 --> 02:10:14,500
Even god can't save you.

2185
02:10:15,801 --> 02:10:17,400
God won't save me,

2186
02:10:17,767 --> 02:10:18,968
But, he will.

2187
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:24,300
Don't you understand?

2188
02:10:25,267 --> 02:10:29,187
The rape videos taken by your son and his friends
have been uploaded in the name of 'Redd leaks'...

2189
02:10:29,434 --> 02:10:33,801
safely on the automatic scheduler.

2190
02:10:34,934 --> 02:10:37,334
If I don't stop that in an hour,

2191
02:10:37,767 --> 02:10:39,500
It'll reach all the media.

2192
02:10:39,567 --> 02:10:42,801
The image you built in
the society will tarnish.

2193
02:10:43,801 --> 02:10:45,367
Dad, he is lying.

2194
02:10:45,734 --> 02:10:47,614
Absolutely no chance of him
having those videos.

2195
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:52,100
Hey, can't I do this
when I could do other things?

2196
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:54,868
Your dead friend, Deepak... right?

2197
02:10:55,467 --> 02:10:58,567
I recovered all the videos from
his phone and it's safe in my mail.

2198
02:10:59,901 --> 02:11:01,400
Give me your phone,
I'll show you.

2199
02:11:02,067 --> 02:11:03,067
Are you afraid?

2200
02:11:22,534 --> 02:11:23,534
There's no time.

2201
02:11:24,067 --> 02:11:27,000
I must manually overwrite
to stop that.

2202
02:11:27,033 --> 02:11:28,793
You were under police custody
all these days.

2203
02:11:28,868 --> 02:11:30,534
I asked them to take you out.

2204
02:11:30,734 --> 02:11:33,734
But, now you're saying that the video
will spread in an hour.

2205
02:11:34,868 --> 02:11:37,367
It's not possible,
unless you activate it.

2206
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:41,033
Correct.
I was under custody all these days.

2207
02:11:42,167 --> 02:11:47,601
You took me out, gave your phone
and made me activate it.

2208
02:11:57,868 --> 02:11:59,634
Dad, we will lynch him here.

2209
02:11:59,667 --> 02:12:02,334
Hey, matured people
are speaking.

2210
02:12:03,067 --> 02:12:03,767
Don't get tensed.

2211
02:12:03,768 --> 02:12:04,868
We don't want those videos.

2212
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:07,701
We know how to deal with it.

2213
02:12:08,033 --> 02:12:09,601
But, you can't go alive
from here.

2214
02:12:10,868 --> 02:12:11,868
Hey...

2215
02:12:14,767 --> 02:12:16,200
Hey, Sanjay! Dad.

2216
02:12:17,033 --> 02:12:18,033
Great friendship!

2217
02:12:18,734 --> 02:12:20,067
Abhijith, get the car.

2218
02:12:21,601 --> 02:12:22,601
What is this?

2219
02:12:23,033 --> 02:12:24,113
What are you doing, Sanjay?

2220
02:12:25,634 --> 02:12:26,801
My business empire.

2221
02:12:27,534 --> 02:12:28,868
Fifty years of reputation.

2222
02:12:29,267 --> 02:12:31,167
I won't allow a five minute
video to spoil that.

2223
02:12:34,801 --> 02:12:37,834
I'll kill him there
after I get the video.

2224
02:12:38,534 --> 02:12:40,934
Till then, don't do anything.

2225
02:12:41,267 --> 02:12:42,267
Understood?

2226
02:12:42,868 --> 02:12:43,901
Mark my words.

2227
02:13:11,801 --> 02:13:12,868
Fast... fast.

2228
02:13:29,067 --> 02:13:30,800
Flash news.

2229
02:13:30,801 --> 02:13:32,166
In the name of 'Redd leaks',

2230
02:13:32,167 --> 02:13:34,067
Shocking videos associated with,

2231
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:36,367
'Redd' group are to be released...

2232
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,934
on the internet and media.
Hey, fast, stop it.

2233
02:13:40,968 --> 02:13:41,968
Dad!

2234
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,100
Hey.

2235
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:51,667
Don't worry.

2236
02:13:51,667 --> 02:13:52,200
Hey, open it.

2237
02:13:52,601 --> 02:13:54,634
I won't kill your son.
Abhijith...

2238
02:13:58,334 --> 02:13:59,000
No...

2239
02:13:59,267 --> 02:14:00,267
No...

2240
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,333
A countdown has also been
given by that unknown person...

2241
02:14:06,334 --> 02:14:09,733
to release the videos.

2242
02:14:09,734 --> 02:14:10,734
Shit.

2243
02:14:19,234 --> 02:14:20,234
Hey,

2244
02:14:24,534 --> 02:14:25,534
Abhijith...

2245
02:14:28,033 --> 02:14:29,033
Where are you?

2246
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:32,133
Hey.

2247
02:14:39,801 --> 02:14:40,801
Hey...

2248
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,267
Hey, where are you going?

2249
02:14:56,534 --> 02:14:57,534
Where is Abijith?

2250
02:15:01,234 --> 02:15:03,734
Dad... Abhijith!

2251
02:15:04,067 --> 02:15:04,767
Dad...

2252
02:15:05,033 --> 02:15:06,133
Dad...

2253
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,968
Dad, don't leave it.

2254
02:15:10,133 --> 02:15:12,033
Hold, dad.

2255
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,300
Abhijith.

2256
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:18,200
Abhijith.

2257
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:21,100
Dad...

2258
02:15:21,801 --> 02:15:22,834
Dad..

2259
02:15:22,868 --> 02:15:24,299
Dad... dad...

2260
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,300
Dad, don't leave it.

2261
02:15:25,601 --> 02:15:26,601
Dad...

2262
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:30,200
Dad...

2263
02:15:33,567 --> 02:15:34,901
Dad, hold.

2264
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:36,400
No...

2265
02:15:44,033 --> 02:15:45,033
Hey.

2266
02:15:45,234 --> 02:15:46,354
Hold on, Abhijith. Dad...

2267
02:15:47,033 --> 02:15:48,033
Dad...

2268
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:49,834
Dad...

2269
02:15:49,868 --> 02:15:54,767
You said that it took fifty years
to build this reputation, isn't it?

2270
02:15:56,934 --> 02:16:01,567
But, to save all that,
you're just left with two minutes.

2271
02:16:02,801 --> 02:16:08,901
Your son or your
reputation in the society,

2272
02:16:08,934 --> 02:16:09,534
Stop.

2273
02:16:09,767 --> 02:16:10,833
You decide.

2274
02:16:10,834 --> 02:16:11,834
Stop that.

2275
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,767
That's not my job. Stop.

2276
02:16:14,267 --> 02:16:15,300
Stop it yourself.

2277
02:16:15,868 --> 02:16:17,634
This button... Come.

2278
02:16:19,267 --> 02:16:20,601
Dad... dad...

2279
02:16:21,601 --> 02:16:22,601
Dad... dad...

2280
02:16:23,267 --> 02:16:26,033
No, dad...

2281
02:16:27,534 --> 02:16:29,467
Don't leave it, dad. No, dad...

2282
02:16:38,868 --> 02:16:40,133
Hold on, Abhijith.

2283
02:16:40,968 --> 02:16:41,968
Hold on, Abhijith.

2284
02:16:43,167 --> 02:16:44,167
Dad...

2285
02:16:46,267 --> 02:16:49,334
Dad... my feet.

2286
02:16:50,467 --> 02:16:51,567
Dad.

2287
02:16:52,467 --> 02:16:53,634
I can't, dad.

2288
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:57,067
Dad.

2289
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:58,100
I can't.

2290
02:17:01,334 --> 02:17:03,033
Hold.

2291
02:17:13,267 --> 02:17:14,834
Don't leave it, dad.

2292
02:17:15,167 --> 02:17:16,167
Dad.

2293
02:17:16,868 --> 02:17:17,434
Dad.

2294
02:17:17,435 --> 02:17:19,100
Dad.

2295
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,734
Dad.

2296
02:17:48,834 --> 02:17:50,534
Dad...

2297
02:17:54,200 --> 02:18:02,200
Dad... dad...

2298
02:18:09,334 --> 02:18:11,167
No...!

2299
02:18:21,167 --> 02:18:22,567
Abhijith!

2300
02:18:24,067 --> 02:18:25,067
Abhijith!

2301
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:27,234
Hey Abhijith, come on.

2302
02:18:28,434 --> 02:18:29,434
Abhijith!

2303
02:18:29,667 --> 02:18:30,667
Abhijith!

2304
02:18:31,267 --> 02:18:31,801
Abhijith!

2305
02:18:31,802 --> 02:18:34,534
Finally, I gave you a chance
to be a good father.

2306
02:18:35,934 --> 02:18:37,334
You missed this one too.
Abhijith!

2307
02:18:37,601 --> 02:18:39,467
But, there's something
I like about you.

2308
02:18:43,734 --> 02:18:46,174
You never thought about anything
when you brought your son up.

2309
02:18:48,234 --> 02:18:49,874
Even now you weren't
hesitant to kill him.

2310
02:18:57,267 --> 02:18:58,334
Abhijith...

2311
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,534
Abhijith...

2312
02:19:06,868 --> 02:19:08,534
Abhijith...

2313
02:19:13,868 --> 02:19:18,566
The prime suspects,
in the kidnapping case...

2314
02:19:18,567 --> 02:19:20,233
have been murdered mysteriously.

2315
02:19:20,234 --> 02:19:23,233
The Anna Nagar police are
intensely interrogating.

2316
02:19:23,234 --> 02:19:25,443
It's Suresh reporting for 'News 10' channel
with cameraman Bharathi.

2317
02:19:25,467 --> 02:19:27,333
Cover it... sir...

2318
02:19:27,334 --> 02:19:30,200
Just a minute, sir.

2319
02:19:43,567 --> 02:19:45,677
Sir, a complaint was filed on them
just three days ago.

2320
02:19:45,701 --> 02:19:47,533
But, someone has already
lynched them.

2321
02:19:47,534 --> 02:19:50,467
Sir, you have attended four cases
after you have been placed here.

2322
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,999
In that, two of the accused related
to the cases went missing.

2323
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,700
It's written as,
"The law will take its own course".

2324
02:19:54,701 --> 02:19:56,210
But, only a series of murders
are happening.

2325
02:19:56,234 --> 02:19:57,934
Will you arrest them or not, sir?

2326
02:20:24,801 --> 02:20:28,234
Sir, why aren't you replying?

2327
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:33,567
"The law will take its own course".
