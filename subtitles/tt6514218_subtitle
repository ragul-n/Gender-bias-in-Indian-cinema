1
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,916
What the hell is going on here?

2
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,833
What's going on?

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,208
We're just fooling around, sir.

4
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,750
In winter, with your clothes on?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,083
Out of the pool, all of you! Come on!

6
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,583
Oh shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

7
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,708
He must have called Murali.

8
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,791
Stupid fatso!

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
You're bleeding, Shay.

10
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,875
Hit the edge of the pool, sir.

11
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,791
The list is out.

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Am I on it?

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,166
Go, find out.

14
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,000
Get out of those clothes
before you catch a chill!

15
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,041
Yes, sir!

16
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,750
We did it! We did it!
We made it to the Founder's. We did it!

17
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,375
Oops, sorry.
We did it!

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,291
Statue!

19
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,958
Pia!

20
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,500
Pia!

21
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,041
Pia!

22
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,125
- Pia!
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,541
"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,

24
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,291
and in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee."

25
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,291
What happened to your lip?

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,625
"Even by thine own fair eyes,
wherein I see myself in."

27
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,416
"Mark you but that!

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,750
In both my eyes he doubly
sees himself in each eye,

29
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,750
- one--"
- Pia?

30
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,208
Have you seen the history test papers
I left on the dining table?

31
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,708
On your desk, Mom!

32
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
"Swear by your double self,
and there's an oath of credit!"

33
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,958
We did it, Pia.
We did it. Look at this. We did it!

34
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,208
We did it!

35
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,500
We did it! Yeah!

36
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,500
- What was that?
- Oh!

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,208
- What was that?
- Look at this, Pia.

38
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,958
- It's a finch. It's...
- Oh...

39
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,416
- And it's wearing our uniform.
- Show me, show me!

40
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,208
How are you?

41
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,250
Pia, hurry.
You will be late for assembly.

42
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:12,125
Mount Noble High
has a grand and glorious tradition.

43
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,458
This year, that tradition
takes even more meaning

44
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:21,208
as we celebrate our 150th Founder's Day.

45
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,833
It is also
an extraordinary opportunity for each

46
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,875
and every one of you to shine

47
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,666
and spread greatest Noble High traditions.

48
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,375
For me, it takes on even greater meaning,

49
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,291
as it shall be my last
before my retirement.

50
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:45,833
Together, let us resolve
to make it our finest hour.

51
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,583
So,

52
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,250
The Merchant of Venice
is basically a tale about?

53
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,250
Revenge.

54
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,333
Revenge.

55
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,375
Shylock wants to avenge himself
against those that have wronged him.

56
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,208
And you know what the cool part is?

57
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,833
Theatre imitates life.

58
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,875
Now, just for a moment...
let's imitate theatre.

59
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,375
I want you guys... to shut your eyes,

60
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,916
take a moment...

61
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,333
and think about that one person
that has wronged you...

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,708
and how you would avenge yourself.

63
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,625
Come on.

64
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,541
Pia?

65
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,041
I'd like to hurt them
like they hurt me, sir.

66
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,500
An eye for an eye. Fair enough.

67
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,333
Baaadal?

68
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,208
I'd enlist the best people
on my side and carry out my revenge.

69
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,583
Simple.

70
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,250
What about you, Shay?

71
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,000
Momma says
there's no need for revenge.

72
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,000
Those who hurt you will eventually
end up hurting themselves, so...

73
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,375
I guess I'll just wait
till I tire my enemies out.

74
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,416
Momma's fuckin' boy!

75
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,416
What about you, sir? What would you do?

76
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,666
Well, forgiveness is the sweetest revenge.

77
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,750
Can't quite remember who said that
but works all right for me.

78
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,250
All right, guys!
Let's get the scripts out.

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,708
This ain't no soup.
It's sewage, man.

80
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,958
And you're still stuffing
your face with it?

81
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,833
Listen up, boys!

82
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,750
Attention, please!

83
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,916
Noblemen.

84
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,625
And Nobler women.

85
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,750
What does that say?

86
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,666
Truth, courage, strength.

87
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,500
Let's start from me.

88
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,083
As of 14:30 hours today,

89
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,458
I got selected
in the under-19 state football team.

90
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,166
-See! That's my boy!
-The only player...

91
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,041
The only player from this region.

92
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,958
Take that, competing schools!

93
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,708
Time to get your asses
whooped in the final.

94
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,583
- Arjun! Arjun! Arjun!
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

95
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,125
Now, which lucky boy

96
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,833
is going to show me some strength

97
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,041
and courage tonight?

98
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,958
Huh?

99
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,791
Wimp. Wimp. Wimp.

100
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:08,000
Wimp. Wimp. Wimp. Wimp.

101
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
Ah!

102
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,791
Lucky little Shay.

103
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,875
Do it for me tonight.

104
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,416
- Sir.
- See you.

105
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
-Um...
-Baaadal.

106
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
Sir, I really want to act
in the play, sir.

107
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,958
Sir, Bassanio's part.

108
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,166
Sir, Shay is just a tenthie.

109
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,708
A tenthie has never been cast for
the lead role in the Founder's play, sir.

110
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,833
Sir, also, I think I'll do
a much better job than him, sir.

111
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Look, Baaadal, it's really simple. Uh...

112
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,666
Shay gave the best audition.
That's why he got the part.

113
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,541
Yes, sir, but... Sir, my Dad can help
with the production, big time, sir.

114
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,083
Sir, you know, being a movie star,
he can get the best set designers,

115
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416
best choreographers,
whatever you need, sir.

116
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,375
Did you just try to bribe me, Mr. Shroff?

117
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,208
No, sir, not at all.

118
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,333
Sir, all I'm trying to say is that...

119
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,000
You do realize this is Shakespeare,
not a Bollywood film, right?

120
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,083
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
But I appreciate your enthusiasm. Um...

122
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,125
Maybe... Maybe you could be
the understudy for Bassanio's part?

123
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,583
Hm...

124
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,958
-Yeah?
-Hm.

125
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,750
Great! See you tomorrow.

126
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,208
He must have kept
the bag in there. Please, give it to me.

127
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,958
Ram Singh did not mention the bag to me.

128
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,208
He probably forgot to tell you.

129
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,583
"Yes, here I tender it
for him in the court. Yeah, twice the sum.

130
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,541
If that will not suffice, I will be
bound to pay it ten times o'er,

131
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,458
on forfeit of my hands,
my head, my heart."

132
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,750
He must have kept it inside.
Please give me the bag.

133
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,166
It's not in here.

134
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
Please check. It should be there.

135
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,250
I know it's not in here.

136
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,000
"On forfeit of my head, my hands
and my heart. Yes, you were right."

137
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
Please, look for it once more!

138
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,958
I'm asking you
to please search for it one last time.

139
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,041
I have checked. It's not here, brother.

140
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,833
-Good evening, sir!
-Good evening, sir!

141
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,083
What are you doing here, young man?

142
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,958
I was just looking for my bag, sir.

143
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,875
Sir... Sir...

144
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,541
"My head, my hands, and my heart..."

145
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,875
Shit! Shit!

146
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,791
What are you doing here
at the main gate at this time?

147
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,208
Uh... Sir, we were just, uh...

148
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,625
What did you just pick up?

149
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,000
Sir, we were collecting, uh...

150
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,041
Collecting what?

151
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,458
Show me.

152
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,083
What's in your pocket?

153
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,166
Now!

154
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,833
Sir, I was looking for insects to feed it.

155
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,833
You know the rules. No pets.

156
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,500
-Get rid of it.
-All right, sir.

157
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,583
And get back to your dorms.

158
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,541
-Now!
-Sorry, sir.

160
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,291
You! Get back to the gate!

161
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,708
-Nice one, Batman!
-Thanks, Robin.

162
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,375
Sorry, babe. No more weekends for me.

163
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,250
State team players have to practice hard.

164
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,041
How can you not come
and see me on the weekend?

165
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,916
Not even for this?

166
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,333
Ooh! Tempting.

167
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,250
Listen, I hear the housemaster coming.
I'll just call you back.

168
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,958
Good stuff, Baddy.
Next round's on me, huh?

169
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,500
Chill, bro.

170
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,750
Thought the pussy
would be scared shitless,

171
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,250
would start crying like a bitch,

172
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,208
but that pussy's got balls too.

173
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:09,625
He is a fuckin' faggot
who can only suck up to teachers.

174
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,125
How else did he get the part?
I should be the lead, yeah.

175
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,458
Exactly, dude. You are the real star.

176
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,083
B-A-A-A-D-A-L.

177
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,750
You know why we put
three bloody A's in my name last year?

178
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,166
Because my Dad's astrologer told him
that it will bring me unbeatable luck.

179
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,500
What will I tell him now?

180
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,458
I'm not having my luck
cramped by this bloody momma's boy, yeah?

181
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,208
And you know,
it's the perfect chance

182
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,291
to play the romantic lead against Pia.

183
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,250
I have to have this role - simple!

184
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,166
Pia? Who's Pia, man?

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,583
Do you ever listen to me, bro?

186
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,458
How many times have I told you?

187
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,083
The new junior school teacher's daughter.

188
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,125
Oh yeah...

189
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,833
The one with the big tits.

190
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,333
Love the tits, man,
but hate the sassy attitude.

191
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,500
You stay
the fuck away from her.

192
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,416
She's mine. I really like her, yeah?

193
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,791
God Almighty!
The pain of a lover...

194
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't worry, Baddy!
I'll get you the play.

195
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,916
Listen to me very carefully now.

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
All you have to do is walk out of the play
and leave it to the better actor.

197
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,916
Because...

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
"Float like a butterfly,

199
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625
sting like a bee, the hands can't hit

200
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,583
what the eyes can't see!"

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,708
We can do it nice and easy,

202
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,666
or we can do it the hard way.

203
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,000
You don't get it, Shay. Do you?

204
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,958
You know a tenthie once ended
up in hospital with two broken knees.

205
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,958
Know why?

206
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,250
He made the mistake
of saying no to Arjun.

207
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,416
Just like you,
I'll do anything for my friend.

208
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,708
The play belongs to Baaadal.

209
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:02,416
Or else yours
and your fat friend's ass is mine.

210
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,708
Noble High will!

211
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,250
Who will win?

212
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,708
Noble High will!
We are with you!

213
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,333
Come on, run!

214
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,416
Go, Mount Noble High!

215

Arjun, Arjun!

218
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,541
Why don't you leave the play?

219
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,291
Shoot! Shoot!

00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,916

221
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,666

225
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,791
What happened to your mouth?

226
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,291
Oh, this?

227
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,916
Just fell while playing, nothing much.
How are you? How are you feeling?

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,458
You tell me first.

229
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,541
It feels like forever
since I saw you.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
This is so much better
than a phone call, right?

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,083
How's school? Friends?

232
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,375
Everything's great, Momma.
I mean, there are tons of friends.

233
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,958
There's Ganzu,
Pia, Phoenix, Baaadal, Arjun,

234
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,916
Imran, Abby. There's so much going on.

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Wow!

236
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,541
- You have three minutes left.
- Yeah.

237
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,958
I-- I have something to show you.

238
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,500
Even I couldn't believe it.

239
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,625
But they brought in this neurosurgeon
from the Australian Navy.

240
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,291
Um...

241
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,000
He says I might be able to walk again.

242
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,666
And you know what helped me the most?

243
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,833
Remember this?

244
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,458
You still have that, Momma?

245
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,166
Always.

246
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,791
Guess where my first outing
is going to be?

247
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,208

Awesome. Awesome.

Fucking asshole, man!

260
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,208
Was someone yanking your dick?

261
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,750
Isn't that why you were singing
in that high-pitched voice?

262
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Yes?

263
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,458
Turn around, man.

264
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,166
Or no?

265
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,875
I'm told you can get
the perfect pitch if someone squeezes

266
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,208
your balls really hard.
I'm serious.

267
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:58,416
Trust me. Shall we try? Whoo.

268
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,708
Ganesh, you should know,
we have eyes and ears everywhere.

269
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,208
Right?

270
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,583
Fucker. Got saved by the bell.

271
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,541
Lucky fucker!

272
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,208
I'll squeeze your balls next time.

273
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,916
You fine?

274
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,000
Son, you're looking

275
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,375
at the sports captain.
You want to say no to me?

276
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,583
-To me?
-No.

277
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,208
On the ground,
give me 500 push-ups. Now. Now!

278
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,250
Forget push-ups.
You should push out of the play.

279
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,083
Why do you want to get fucked?

280
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,041
What is he talking about?

281
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,791
I'm going to effing smash your teeth in.

282
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,125
Then I'm going to get you
to clean my room for the next two weeks!

283
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
And... clean my butt when I shit!

284
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,333
-Are you with me, buffalo soldier?
-No!

285
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,250
-Are you with me?
-Obviously, no!

286
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,875
Do you like bananas?

287
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean... you can have ours, if you want.

288
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,333
Hate this place.

289
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,250
There's nothing worse
than being a girl in an all-boys school.

290
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,541
Yeah right.

291
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,625
Try being a fat dark boy
like me,

292
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
who likes to sing
in a high-pitched voice.

293
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,125
No, you guys have nothing.

294
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,666
Try being a boy who likes drama
and literature

295
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,666
and just can't do well at sports.

296
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,666
Yeah right!

297
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,500
And by the way,
why did you join this school?

298
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,125
You must have known that the
only girls here are teachers' daughters?

299
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,291
No option.

300
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,250
-Anyway, why were you--
-Guys!

301
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,416
There's someone's waiting to meet you.

302
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,166
- Come fast! Come fast! Come fast!
- Wait, but who?

303
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,083
All clear. All clear.

304
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,916
- Shay, listen...
- Sh. Don't make noise.

305
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,250
Why are you taking us to the dorms?

306
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
Shh! Keep it down. Keep it down.

307
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,041
OK. OK.

308
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,791
Come on. Come on.

309
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,291
Sh. Sh...

310
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,875
Listen, Shay, I'm scared.
What if we get caught?

311
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,166
Bro...

312
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,333
Let's go!

313
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,625
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

314
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,541
OK then. Say hello!

315
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,166
You kept it?

316
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,750
Oh my God! It's so cute.

317
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,666
Oh!

318
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,916
He was injured.

319
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,208
But he is a brave little boy!

320
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,708
Yeah. Does he have a name?

321
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,500
Of course, we've given him one.

322
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
-Cupcake?
-Phoenix.

323
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,333
Cupcake? Really Ganzu?

324
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,333
Phoenix. I like it.

325
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,666
He's risen from the ashes.
A fighter.

326
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,583
Shay, get down.

327
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,791
What's going on?

328
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,458
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

329
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,250
You must have over bloody eaten!

330
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,791
Let's go to the nurse.

331
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,625
No, no, no.
I can't go to the nurse right now.

332
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,916
I think I need to lie down.
Yeah?

333
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,541
-Eat less, you bugger!
-Yeah.

334
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,958
You smell so good.

335
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,375
We just had a narrow escape.

336
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,541
Well done, Ganzu!
You should be in the play, not us.

337
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,750
Good job, man!

338
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,500
Who will sing the song? Let's go.

339
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,625
"In Belmont is a lady richly left.

340
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,625
And she is fair and fairer
than that world of wondrous virtues."

341
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,041
"Sometimes, from her eyes

342
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,958
I did receive fair speechless messages.

343
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,375
Her name is Pia. Um, Portia.

344
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,416
Nothing undervalued

345
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,541
to Catos' daughter and Brutus' Portia.

346
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,125
Nor is the wide world
ignorant of her worth.

347
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,000
For the four winds
that blow in from every coast.

348
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,958
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks,

349
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,875
hang on her temples
like a golden fleece-fleece!

350
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,833
Oh, my Antonio--"

351
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,708
That's... That's good, Baaadal.
Baaadal, that's good.

352
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,125
Thank you. Thank you so much.

353
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,458
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

354
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,041
What the heck does she see
in Shay? Always stuck to him.

355
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,000
Fucking fag! Bet he's lending to Murali.

356
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,875
You know, man,
you actually might be right.

357
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Murali has no family, has no wife.

358
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:09,000
He's always reciting poetry,
doing his silly Tai Chi,

359
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,000
hanging around younger boys.

360
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,375
He has to be a fucking fag, man.

361
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,125
Yeah, of course!
That's what I'm saying.

362
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,458
Morning!

363
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,958
I see the cold hasn't dampened
your enthusiasm for the outdoors.

364
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,583
Not a chance, sir.

365
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,500
-How was your walk?
-Good. Good.

366
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,208
Is everything OK, sir?

367
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,958
Something that needs immediate attention.

368
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,958
Smuggling of cigarettes
and marijuana has started again.

369
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,291
And I fear the harder drugs will follow.

370
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,125
We had clamped it down last year,
but obviously, nothing is permanent.

371
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:54,000
But I'm determined
this school to remain drug free.

372
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,875
Sir, uh, I know you carry out
random checks in here.

373
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,375
You're pretty much doing
everything that you can do, but...

374
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,166
I think it might be more effective if we
somehow get the students involved?

375
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,750
Good idea.

376
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,166
-Let us get them involved.
-Right, sir!

377
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,916
I'll bring in Lalit and Colvyn,
and some other schoolteachers.

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,333
Let's meet at four
in the afternoon in my office.

379
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,208
-Great, sir.
-Very good. Thank you.

380
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,666
-Thank you, sir.
-Carry on.

381
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,666
So, continuing from yesterday,
we talked

382
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,750
about super normal profits
and super normal losses.

383
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,458
Good morning, students!

384
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,750
It has come to my notice

385
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,583
that a packet of banned substance
was brought into our campus.

386
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,000
I am bringing in surprise checks
with immediate effect.

387
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:45,583
And we are starting a "No drugs" campaign
for the students, by the students.

388
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,166
Mr. Karthik Murali has kindly agreed

389
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,166
to take lead in this endeavor.

390
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,083
Thank you. Back to your classes.

391
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,375
- Is it straight?
- Yeah.

392
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,000
Pass the tape.

393
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,625
Oops.

394
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,625
Oh, look Arjun,

395
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,833
Murali's fucking sidekicks are so sad.

396
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,833
Come on, Baddy, not fair.

397
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,250
We must give your work more respect,
and I will.

398
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,500
Yup.

399
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,291
"Say no to drugs and yes to hugs."

400
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,333
Aw! Gay boy wants a hug!

401
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,458
Come!

402
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,000
Shay is shy, huh?

403
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,750
Shay? Shy? Shy Shay!

404
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,625
Gay boy, listen up...
I've got to show you something.

405
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,875
- Guys, guys, guys, here's a good one.
- Hm?

406
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,500
♪ What burns is fire
What's left is ash ♪

407
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:46,166
♪ The one who rises
From the ash is Baaadal ♪

408
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,791
Baddy, man, Baddy!

409
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,625
Shay is shy. Shy Shay.
That was a good one!

410
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,833
The students
seem to have thrown themselves

411
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,416
into the NO TO DRUGS campaign?

412
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,208
Well, the younger ones
more than the seniors.

413
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,833
All the more reason to press on
with the surprise raids.

414
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,458
Let's not overreact.

415
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,750
I am sure the prefects are keeping an eye

416
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:23,000
and would tell us
if something suspicious comes up.

417
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,416
Well,
from the little that I've seen, uh...

418
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,375
no matter how well-intentioned
a student might be,

419
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,291
ratting out your classmates
is seen as the ultimate treachery.

420
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,458
Puts an even bigger responsibility on us
to figure out what's going on, huh?

421
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,625
Well, I know what's happening in my house:

422
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,916
the boys are clean.
Gandhi House is absolutely clean.

423
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,041
So you don't believe
in random checks at Gandhi House?

424
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,875
No. Of course I do.

425
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,625
OK, guys, so what's the most,
uh, important thing for an actor?

426
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,583
Be in the moment?

427
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,666
Be in the moment. That's a good one.

428
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,125
Expressions?

429
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,000
- Expressions. Of course.
- Good looks!

430
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,041
That's great, Baaadal,
but we'll just keep that aside for now.

431
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,833
What about... feeling?

432
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,708
Is that important?

433
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,250
Yes. Definitely.

434
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,625
And to feel everything,
do we have to experience everything?

435
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,958
Yes, sir.

436
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,791
So what is it that stops us
from experiencing everything?

437
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,083
Um... shyness?

438
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,625
- Shyness. Of course.
- Fear?

439
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,125
Fear. That's a big one.

440
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,291
Inhibitions.

441
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,416
OK, fine, come on.

442
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,291
Today, we are going to break
these damn inhibitions! Stand up.

443
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,750
So, I want you guys
to take your clothes off.

444
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,083
Not the girls, just the guys.

445
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,125
An actor's body is not his body.
It's just a neutral machine.

446
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,583
It has no caste, no sex,

447
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,958
no religion, no inhibitions.

448
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,875
Come on, guys!

449
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,083
OK fine, I'll start.

450
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,166
Baaadal, thank you very much.

451
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,208
Take that inhibition.

452
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,708
"Mislike me not for my complexion.

453
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,708
Shadowed livery of the burnished sun

454
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,750
for whom I am neighbor and near bred."

455
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,458
Feel great?

456
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,166
Come on!

457
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,916
That's it? That's it, boys.

458
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,958
Come on, guys! Shay?

459
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
My stomach's cramping.
Can I have five minutes?

460
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,875
OK.

461
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,333
Let's make the bastard
run 20 more rounds.

462
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,291
Why?

463
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,875
We will enjoy watching his legs break.

464
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,375
I'm obviously missing something here.

465
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:29,833
Training.

466
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,750
Training?

467
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,125
Training for what?

468
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,166
To be a man.

469
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,250
This will make a fine man of him someday.

470
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,666
We've all been through it.

471
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,625
Look what it did for me.

472
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,416
Look what it did for you.

473
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,791
But I just finished.

474
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,416
Then start again with bricks.

475
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,958
- Twenty rounds more!
- Come on.

476
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,125
See, tonight your legs
are going to pain, huh?

477
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,583
Take it as a preparation
for when your legs are broken.

478
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:12,875
See, understand.

479
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,375
You broke the code, son.

480
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,708
Actually, do not do that.

481
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,416
-You don't mess with your seniors, bro.
-Absolutely.

482
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,958
Your fat buddy
didn't turn up today, huh?

483
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,375
He's not gonna come.

484
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,458

Sir, I can't have him messing my parade.

504
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,541
He needs practice, and you can see it.

505
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,208
I have very high standards, sir.

506
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,541

Where's your Shay now?

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,875
Let's take him.

511
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,625
Please leave me.

512
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:30,416
Let's teach him a lesson.

513
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,875
Let everyone see what we do to him!

514
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:35,791
- Don't fall, Fatfuck!
- Push him down.

515
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,291
Please leave me.

00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,500
What are you hiding behind
those hands, do you even have a dick?

517
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,416
Help me!

518
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,583
Get him! Get him!

00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,541

00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:50,041
-Why are you guys doing this to me?
-Shut up.

It's the price he pays
for helping you out.

525
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,625
Leave me. Let go of him!

- Leave him alone!
- Shay!

527
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,291
Ganzu!

528
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,625
Ganzu!

529
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,375
OK.

530
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,500
It's fine. I am here.

531
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,916
The worst is over.

532
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,791
Ganzu, oh man.

533
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,250
There's nothing more they can do now.

534
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,041
Nothing.

535
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,375
Hey.

536
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,000
Ganzu!

537
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,291
Look at me, Ganzu.

538
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,458
In 18 months,
we're going to be in grade 12.

539
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,041
Then nobody can do anything to us.

540
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,625
And even if they try to, I'm not gonna let
anyone do anything to you. OK?

541
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,166
Don't cry, man.

542
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,375
You are strong, right?

543
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,833
Come here.

544
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:23,500
You want something?

545
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,875
OK. OK, OK.

546
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,291
Plus tan theta,

547
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,875
plus cot theta.

548
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:45,208
Find the solution.
You have exactly two minutes.

549
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,208
-Excuse me, sir?
-Hm.

550
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,833
-Uh, take charge of the class.
-Yes, sir.

551
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,458
Now that he has gone,

552
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:20,000
let's watch girl on girl action, boys!

553
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,000
Shit, it's Ganesh!

554
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,416
He drank phenyl.

555
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,458
Let's go! Let's go!

556
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,000
Hurry!

557
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Ganzu!

558
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,375
I have to go!
I have to go with him! I have to go!

559
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,416
- Let him go, Shay.
- Let me go! Ganzu!

560
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,041
-Sir, please, please, please let me go.
-He'll be OK, Shay.

561
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,916
-Ganzu!
-Shay, he's going to be OK, Shay.

562
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,041
It's OK.

563
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,166
He's going to be OK.

564
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,500
- It's all my fault.
- Shay, it's not your fault.

565
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:55,958
It's not your fault, Shay.

566
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,625
It's going to be OK, Shay.

567
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,583
I don't know, sir.

568
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,208
It's your business to know
what's going on in your house.

569
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,750
Your business to know
what's going on with each and every boy!

570
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,000
There will be cops to answer to,
angry parents to answer to,

571
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,791
and God, I hope there
is no media to answer to.

572
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:25,833
While we are at it,
I need certain answers.

573
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,791
How does a sweet,
singing, happy-go-lucky boy

574
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,875
wake up one day
and guzzle a bottle of phenyl?

575
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,291
Sir, I'll investigate the--

576
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,416
I knew... about the drinking,

577
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:42,791
but I thought it will never interfere
with your responsibilities.

578
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:46,125
I was a fool to trust you!

579
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,291
Don't worry. He is fine now.
His pulse rate is under control now.

580
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,500
I've given him some medicines. And he's...

581
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,375
Ganzu, please come back, man. I need you.

582
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,333
Ganzu, wake up.

583
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,916
What if he really dies, man?

584
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,791
They'll investigate and arrest us
for sure.

585
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,916
We'll be going to fuckin' jail.

586
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,500
But we were only following instructions.

587
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,166
If Shay talks, we're dead.

588
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,166
I'm dead.
My father will kill me.

589
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,708
- We're so fucked.
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

590
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,083
I don't know if that fatfuck
is going to die or not,

591
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,750
but you're surely going to kill me.

592
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,958
Don't want to get caught? Right?

593
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,583
First rule:

594
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,625
stop looking fucking guilty.

595
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,458
Hm?

596
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,333
Can you do that?

597
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,625
Suicide is not cowardly.

598
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,750
You know what's cowardly?

599
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:14,125
Ganging up and tormenting someone

600
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,291
so he wants to end his life.

601
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:22,250
I stood up against the board on the issue
of security cameras in dorms.

602
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,500
To protect your privacy.

603
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,000
But...

604
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,958
you don't deserve my trust.

605
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:37,500
The boy you bullied and tormented
is much stronger than you will ever be.

606
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,041
Even now,
he refuses to give me your names.

607
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,208
But make no mistake,

608
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:47,000
I shall find the cowards
behind this cruel,

609
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,541
vicious and unspeakable behavior.

610
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,916
And they will be punished.

611
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:57,000
So, step forward now

612
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,166
or have me suspend all of Gandhi House.

613
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,916
Very well, then.

614
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:12,000
No Founder's for Gandhi House.
You're all suspended.

615
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,041
The message will be loud and clear.

616
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,125
Ganesh has nothing to be ashamed of...

617
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,541
only you do.

618
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,666
Since nobody is coming forward,

619
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:29,416
this matter will be referred
to the local police.

620
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,833
Sir, it was me.

621
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:40,041
We were joking with him.
We found his love letter in the dorm.

622
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:43,041
You! Come with me!

623
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:11,708
That's it, Shay. That's it, Shay.

624
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:14,208
Feel the anger, Shay. Feel the anger.

625
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,916
Stay with it, Shay. Stay with it.

626
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,875
Come out of it slowly, Shay.

627
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,208
Come out of it slowly.

628
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,000
Relax.

629
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,291
That's it.

630
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,291
That's it.

631
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,833
I never imagined
you had that in you.

632
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,500
Neither did I.

633
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,041
Even Baaadal
looked positively scared of you.

634
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,583
Shay, what happened?

635
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:17,833
Shay?

636
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,041
What happened?

637
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,250
Pia, dinner in ten minutes.

638
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,375
You have to speak up.

639
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,625
Shay, it's...
It's Ganesh. It's your best friend.

640
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,041
I can't be that guy, OK. I can't.

641
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,458
I can't be the snitch.

642
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:01,916
They will make life... hell for me.

643
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,625
What happened?

644
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:28,750
My father.

645
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,500
He was much worse to my mum.

646
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,208
We filed a case against him. I insisted.

647
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,708
We moved here to start a new life.

648
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,375
Pia, food.

649
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,291
One minute, Ma!

650
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,041
We have to do something, Shay.

651
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,291
Phoenix, come on.

652
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,625
Can you not trouble me?

653
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,041
Good boy.

654
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,791
Are you hungry?

655
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,041
It's my fault, isn't it?

656
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,166
Should I leave the play?

657
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,666
He is going to physiotherapy
every week, so talk with him politely.

658
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:02,166
Say no to drugs campaign:
for the students, by the students.

659
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,333
I told you all
there was nothing to worry about.

660
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:06,875
You all were shitting yourselves
for no fucking reason.

661
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,583
The old man's lost his marbles
long ago, huh?

662
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:11,958
Bro, pass it to me.

663
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,583
Here, take it.

664
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,291
You too?

665
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,708
-Really?
-I need it.

666
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,833
I wet my pants from fright today.

667
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,791
Come here.

668
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,708
You saved us, son,
by being a true Gandhian.

669
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,416
You did a good job.

670
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:39,000
And he told the HM that Ganzu was upset

671
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,708
because he teased him about a love letter.

672
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,166
Fucking genius!

673
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,708
Learn from him! You should
write love letters to Pia on behalf of me.

674
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,041
Welcome to the squad, bro.

675
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:56,166
You're captain material,
and I promise you I'll get you there.

676
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,583
- Woah, too good!
- Good one. Good one.

677
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,500
"Hath not a Jew eyes?

678
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,708
Hath not a Jew hands,

679
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,583
organs, dimensions,

680
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,291
senses, affections, passions?

681
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,375
Fed with the same food,

682
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,750
hurt by the same weapons,

683
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,375
subject to the same diseases,
healed by the same means,

684
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:01,208
warmed and cooled by the same
summer and winter as a Christian is?

685
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,625
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

686
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,833
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

687
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:12,083
If you poison us, do we not die?

688
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:17,125
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?

689
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:22,750
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

690
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,791
When a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility?

691
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,458
Revenge?

692
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,500
If a Christian wrong a Jew,

693
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,708
what should his sufferance be,
by Christian example?

694
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:40,625
Why... revenge.

695
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:45,875
The villainy that you teach me,

696
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,708
I shall execute, and it shall go hard,

697
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,833
but I shall better thee instruction.

698
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,875
The bastard
just isn't scared of us!

699
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,458
He's still showing up for drama class.
Can you imagine?

700
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,500
Bro, I'm 100% sure he has to be
sucking that Murali's cock.

701
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,166
Are you serious?

702
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,833
Sir, there was something in his eye.

703
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,541
-I was just...
-Arjun. Arjun.

704
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,166
Is everyone a girl
in our junior batch?

705
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,208
But he was just removing
something from my eyes.

706
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:21,125
No! No! No!
Is this a boys school anymore, guys?

707
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,458
-Sorry, sir. Sorry.
-Leave, leave. Leave.

708
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,875
Leave buggers, right now! Leave.

709
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,958
-Fucking pansies.
-Arjun, control, bro!

710
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,083
What's wrong with you?

711
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,166
Come on Ganzu, pick up.

712
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,541
Phoenix loves Arjun. What can I say?

713
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,125
Please don't hurt Phoenix.

714
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:49,666
What part
of "quit the play" did you not get?

715
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,541
You seriously want to defy me?

716
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,125
Please, where's Phoenix?

717
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:08,416
Or... you may get off.

718
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:13,083
Oh yeah.
I think the faggot wants more.

719
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,041
-I'll do anything, OK?
-Hm...

720
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,708
-Wash your clothes, polish your shoes.
-Hm...

721
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:25,041
I'll even warm your toilet seat.
Please tell me where Phoenix is.

722
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,458
- Please.
- Anything?

723
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,208
Anything?

724
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:37,791
Come on.

725
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,166
Sit.

726
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,791
Sit.

727
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,458
Anything, huh?

728
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,958
Oh, you dirty fucking pervert!

729
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:17,458
You dirty fucking pervert!

730
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,083
You pervert!

731
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,583
Dirty pervert!

732
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,208
Pervert! Homo! Rat!

733
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,625
Pervert! Homo! Rat! Pervert!

734
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,416
- You fucking pervert.
- Stop it. That's enough.

735
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,958
You know all this
can stop right now.

736
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:31,125
All you have to do
is fucking leave the play!

737
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,083
I can't.

738
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,791
Oh, no, no.

739
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,166
No!

740
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,375
Shay, are you OK?

741
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,291
Oh my God! Phoenix.

742
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,500
Shay? Shay?

743
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,625
Are you fine, Shay?

744
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:34,333
Shay! Shay! Shay, wait! Shay!

745
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:41,666
Do... Do all the men
kill the things they not love?

746
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:46,250
I'm sorry, Phoenix.

747
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,375
I'm really sorry.

748
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,500
You don't know
who you are messing with.

749
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,500
Enjoy the warm weather.

750
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,625
Assholes!

751
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:47,916
Shay? What?

752
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,916
Come in.

753
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:22,166
There you go.

754
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,208
Nice and warm.

755
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:29,708
Feeling better?

756
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:31,916
Hungry?

757
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,333
OK.

758
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:39,041
Uh... OK,
let's see what we can rustle up. Uh...

759
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,875
Yeah! You can start with this.

760
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,208
OK, so here's what we've got:

761
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:49,791
we've got eggs and bread, eggs and toast,

762
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:51,166
and eggs and eggs.

763
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,916
Anything but boiled eggs, sir.
That's all we ever get here.

764
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,291
All right, scrambled it is then.

765
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,458
So, what are you doing here, Shay?

766
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,250
I got locked out, sir.

767
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:28,833
After dinner, I went to Pia's.

768
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:31,583
We were rehearsing
our lines together and...

769
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,958
I lost track of time. By the time
I went back, the dorms were shut.

770
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,125
In your night suit?

771
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:41,916
And what's that gash on your face?

772
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,708
That's... That's nothing, sir. I'm a...

773
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,750
I'm a klutz. I keep falling
and tripping all over the place.

774
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,666
You're such a terrible liar, Shay.

775
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,750
And that's a good thing.

776
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,125
You want to tell me what happened?
Who did this?

777
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:03,416
You know you can trust me. Huh?

778
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:10,791
They killed Phoenix.

779
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,208
And they took Ganzu away from me
and... now even Phoenix is gone.

780
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:17,166
But...

781
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,291
But there was that... that boy who came
and said that it was just a prank.

782
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:23,875
No, sir.

783
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:27,083
Aman is one of us.
He wouldn't ever do that to Ganzu.

784
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,958
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
Why would he...?

785
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,666
Why would he take the blame
for something that he didn't do?

786
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,583
Shay, listen to me, Shay.
If what you're saying is true,

787
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,875
we need to go to the HM tomorrow.

788
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,250
No, sir! Not the headmaster, sir!

789
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,958
They all hate me. They always have,
way before you even joined this school.

790
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,833
And that is nothing compared
to how much they hate rats.

791
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,000
They'll drive me to leave the school.
I can't have that, sir.

792
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,500
Shay, fear empowers bullies, Shay.

793
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,458
They thrive on it.

794
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,833
No, no, no, sir,
I... I can't go the headmaster, sir.

795
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,583
Momma's doing everything
she can to get well.

796
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:04,666
-I know, Shay.
-Everything,

797
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,833
only so she can see me up on stage.

798
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:08,500
I can't mess that up.

799
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,125
This is the first time she's coming
for Founder's in all these years.

800
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:12,750
You understand.

801
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,416
And maybe it's just my fault.

802
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,083
I'm not like the rest of the boys.

803
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:28,000
And I suck at sports.

804
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:33,500
Maybe boys like me and Ganzu
are just... better off dead.

805
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,041
That's not true, Shay.

806
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,416
I love you. Everyone loves you, Shay.

807
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,958
You're talented,
you're smart, you're sensitive,

808
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,125
and I'm so lucky to have you in my class.

809
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,791
And I promise you,
you're gonna make your mother so proud.

810
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:55,375
I love you, sir! I love you so much.

811
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:57,666
Please hold on to me, sir.
I need you. Please hold on.

812
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,208
What the hell are you doing, Shay?

813
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm sorry, sir.

814
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,833
I don't know how that... I don't
know how that happened. I was...

815
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:10,041
I was feeling low.
I was missing Mom and Ganzu and...

816
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,833
I don't know what came over me.

817
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,291
It was by accident, I swear!

818
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:15,666
- I really didn't mean to...
- It's... It's... It's...

819
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,125
It's... It's OK, Shay! It's OK.

820
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,541
You've just... just had a rough night.

821
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,583
I'm just gonna go for that run, OK?

822
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:30,000
And, uh...
you make yourself comfortable. Hm?

823
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,958
What the fuck?

824
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,833
Gandhi House
has two captains and one prefect.

825
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,750
Yet, a boy of class ten
was locked out last night.

826
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,708
Was the door locked
when you went for your last round?

827
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,791
No... No, sir.

828
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,500
This is the second hideous incident
in Gandhi House this month.

829
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,416
May I remind you,

830
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:34,333
Noble High appoints Captains
for a purpose:

831
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:36,833
to look out for the youngsters
and lead by example,

832
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:39,375
displaying truth, courage, and strength.

833
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:43,291
It seems the exact opposite
is happening here.

834
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:46,666
You are all suspended from your positions.

835
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,583
Deposit your badges on my table and leave.

836
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,500
But sir, as the Sports Captain,
you can't...

837
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:55,666
You too, Mr. Sarwara.

838
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,958
I'm sorry, sir.

839
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,041
I will ensure that going forward--

840
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,708
I should not have appointed you
Housemaster in the first place.

841
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:28,083
Mr. Murali will take charge
of Gandhi House with immediate effect.

842
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:31,625
-But sir, Murali does not even have--
-That's all, Mr. Nair.

843
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,333
Arjun got what he deserved.

844
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:51,500
I'm really proud of you
for speaking up, Shay.

845
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,333
Filth like him has no business
being a captain.

846
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,250
Why did you all even vote
for him in the first place?

847
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,583
Look, the fag is here!

848
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,208
SHAY THE COCK SUCKING RAT

849
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,541
Listen, Shay!

850
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm curious.
What does he have that we don't?

851
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,166
Balls.

852
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,833
And if you or Arjun or Baaadal
or any of your ugly looking friends

853
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,333
come near him again,
I'll make sure you're expelled.

854
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,250
Why? Why, sir?

855
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,875
Why did you have to tell the HM?
I told you not to go to the HM, sir.

856
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,625
-Shay, I--
-Why did you go to him?

857
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:34,791
Shay, the only thing I spoke about
was you being locked out.

858
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,625
But why did you have to?

859
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,250
You know what they'll do to me?

860
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,458
You have no idea what they'll do!
I trusted you.

861
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:43,833
OK! Just come here.

862
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,375
-I trusted you.
-Shay, listen to me!

863
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,750
-I shouldn't have trusted you.
-Shay!

864
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,041
Trust me. I know how to get
the bastard begging for mercy.

865
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,666
He's broken the code, man.

866
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,458
- Bloody fag.
- Not fag, fags.

867
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:00,708
The giant dickhead Murali
and his sidekick Shay.

868
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,541
- Let's do it tonight--
- Enough!

869
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,666
No one's doing anything.

870
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,958
"I am married to a wife,
which is as dear to me as life itself.

871
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,083
But life itself, my wife..."

872
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:50,583
I'm so glad you came back!

873
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:54,000
I knew Batman
couldn't do shit without Robin.

874
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,208
How you feeling?

875
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,125
Fuck!

876
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,666
I wish I didn't come, bro.

877
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,833
I don't think we should have
taken things so far.

878
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,625
I mean, I shouldn't have
taken things so far.

879
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:27,166
I'm sorry about Ganesh, Phoenix.

880
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:30,625
I was wrong.

881
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:36,416
And brother, the play is yours.

882
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,500
I'll make sure of that.

883
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:44,416
And I haven't told you something,
but your insane passion,

884
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,375
it's blown my mind away, man.

885
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,291
You just don't give up.

886
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,291
Respect.

887
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,958
Listen up, boys!
Standing right here in front of you

888
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,375
is the man of Gandhi house.

889
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,833
He sets the examples and the standards.

890
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,000
We all have to learn from him.

891
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,375
Come on, boys!
Looks like it's party time!

892
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,375
I missed you so much!

893
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,916
I missed you too, bro.

894
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:38,750
"The quality of mercy
is not strained.

895
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:43,500
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven upon the place beneath.

896
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,208
-It is twice blessed:
-I see.

897
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:48,208
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

898
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:50,291
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.

899
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:53,375
It becomes the throned monarch
better than his crown.

900
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,416
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.

901
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,875
It is an attribute to God himself."

902
01:05:58,958 --> 01:05:59,958
What?

903
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,208
I'm talking about the Arjun apology.

904
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,416
And I'm talking about these.
You look pretty with these earrings.

905
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,666
They're trishuls!

906
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,125
So it's about being fierce, not pretty.

907
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,791
-"Most worthy Noblewoman..."
-Hey, Shay.

908
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:11,708
- Hey.
- Hey there.

909
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,333
-Morning!
-Thanks.

910
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:17,083
"...I and my friend have
by your wisdom, been this day

911
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:20,000
acquitted of grievous penalties,
in lieu whereof

912
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,833
3,000 ducats due unto the Jew.

913
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,708
We freely cope
your courteous pains withal."

914
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,958
What?

915
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,083
- You're my star, Shay.
- Hey, good morning.

916
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,958
- Good morning.
- Hey, Shay.

917
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,375
You set Arjun right!
Keep it up, bro. Keep it up.

918
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,416
-Can we go?
-Sure.

919
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,208
Hey bro, you...

920
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,375
That was awesome.

921
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,833
-You too!
-Well done, Shay!

922
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,041
Thanks.

923
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,500
Thanks to you, Shay, we've gone
from three idiots to three musketeers!

924
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,250
Shay, you are the man!

925
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:49,958
It's musketeers, by the way.

926
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,708
And yeah, somewhat!

927
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,875
Musketeers.

928
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,208
Better kill it on Founder's.

929
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,416

Goodnight.

938
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,583

01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:28,208
Good.

942
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,916
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight, sir.

943
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:40,916
All right, lights out!

944
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,541
I'm very curious.

945
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,791
This is your third boys school.

946
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:07,916
Surely, you've encountered homosexuality.

947
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,916
It's always a complex dynamic.

948
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,291
Homosexuality and homophobia
go hand in hand.

949
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:21,666
Never addressed but omnipresent.

950
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:27,375
So, you've... you've never
dealt with it there yourself then?

951
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,291
I can't say I have.

952
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,833
It should be addressed.

953
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:34,166
But I doubt...

954
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,750
Our schools,
will they be ever able to do it?

955
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,500
But why can't we, sir?

956
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:44,791
I mean, it's such a shame
that the boys have to suffer.

957
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,333
Honestly,

958
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,666
I fear for the ones who come out.

959
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,791
How do you protect them

960
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:59,375
from this world
of testosterone-driven madness?

961
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,375
Sir...

962
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,625
Sir, aren't we teachers supposed
to be the agents of change, sir?

963
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:10,166
Murali, in an ideal world, yes, son.

964
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,541
Oh...

965
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,750
But shouldn't we at least try?

966
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,458
I admit, Murali...

967
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,750
I did not have strength

968
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:27,166
or the courage to face this truth.

969
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,416
It is easier...

970
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,208
to shut your eyes.

971
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,791
Yes, Papa.

972
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,750
- You will never be one of us.
- Hello?

973
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:37,291
It's bad enough that
your grades are below average.

974
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,791
Now you've been stripped
of the Captain's badge too.

975
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,500
You might as well quit school.

976
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:44,666
Dad, I got selected
for the under-19 football team.

977
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:49,291
Explain to me,
how is that going to help you?

978
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,458
Dad,
college admission may be easier?

979
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,666
- Sports quota?
- Yeah.

980
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,125
Your brother
has just cleared the IFS exam,

981
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,291
and you're finding new ways to fail.
Well done!

982
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:03,208
Dad? Will you
be coming for Founder's?

983
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:07,333
Arjun, I don't want another phone call
from your Headmaster.

984
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:11,500
One more phone call, and you
can find a way to pay your own fees.

985
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:14,375
You are on your own.
Is that clear?

986
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:16,041
Clear, Dad. Clear.

987
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,250
Why! Why! Why! Why!

988
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:12,791
Oops.

989
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,958
Let's hear some Shakespeare
now from you, fuck-face.

990
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,416
Lover boy.

991
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,208
I know what you want.

992
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,500
You know what he wants, right?

993
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:33,916
-Yeah.
-Right?

994
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,750
Then let's fucking give it to him!

995
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,541
Come on, Arjun!

996
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,750
Show him how it's done. Show him!

997
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,041
Let's fuck him up.

998
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:02,041
You OK?

999
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,291
Huh?

1000
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:13,291
If we keep this as a secret...

1001
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:19,500
we can be friends... forever.

1002
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,583
Shay, what happened? Shay?

1003
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:41,458
Shay! Tell me, Shay.

1004
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,833
Good. It's down.

1005
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:55,208
Two days of high fever
and no other symptoms.

1006
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,791
It was only a viral fever. OK?

1007
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:08,791
Shay?

1008
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:14,375
I'm so sorry, Shay.

1009
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,875
You're going to make
an official complaint, right?

1010
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:31,083
Please listen to me, Shay.

1011
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,666
These monsters need to be arrested.

1012
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:39,166
They are worse than my father.

1013
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,625
I'll come with you to the Headmaster.

1014
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,791
I'm going to be with you till this ends.

1015
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:52,666
At least listen to me, Shay!

1016
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,791
Can't you just fucking leave me alone?

1017
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,583
Huh?

1018
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:02,250
Don't you get it?
I was doing fine until you came along.

1019
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:05,250
This is all your fault.

1020
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,083
This is all your fault.

1021
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:10,208
I understand what it's like to be scared.

1022
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,500
No.

1023
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,708
No, you don't know what it's like!

1024
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,333
You don't understand
'cause you're not one of us.

1025
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:17,583
-That's not true, Shay.
-You're not a boy,

1026
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:19,500
and you will never understand!

1027
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:29,375
And if you decide to tell anyone
about this,

1028
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,625
I'm going to kill myself.

1029
01:19:32,958 --> 01:19:33,875
All right?

1030
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,500
Whenever you are in Bombay next,

1031
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,125
I'll make you meet Aish and Abhishek,
for sure.

1032
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,916
Saif and Kareena.
I'll make you meet Kareena aunty.

1033
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,916
Bastards.

1034
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,458
We went on a vacation with them
last year. Dad is too close to them.

1035
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,416
You should have seen the villa man.
Oh, that pool...

1036
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,291
fuckin' real French maids and all...

1037
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:10,250
How could you?

1038
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:12,833
Asshole! You fucking asshole!

1039
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,208
-She's gone mad.
-You fucking coward!

1040
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:17,208
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Pia. What's wrong with her?

1041
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,625
You're an asshole. Fucking let me go!

1042
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:22,375
How the fuck could you? Let me go!

1043
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,916
Uh-huh. Now you're talking.

1044
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,166
She knows, goddammit!

1045
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,125
We have to fix this, bro.
If she tells the HM, we are screwed!

1046
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,791
Baddy, take it easy.

1047
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,708
You know, uh...
I liked your long hair so much.

1048
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:50,958
I miss Shay!

1049
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,708
Yeah. Me too.

1050
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:20,458
Shay Sharma. That's all it says. Huh?
Secret admirer?

1051
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,083
We'll do it again!

1052
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,041
So I believe you've decided
to drop out of the play.

1053
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:08,041
My grades are beginning to drop off.
I've been getting sick too often. Besides,

1054
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:11,041
Mum can't make it for Founder's,
so I don't think I should be doing it.

1055
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,666
You're such a terrible liar, Shay.

1056
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:18,500
I just spoke to your mum, and she
can't wait to watch you in the play.

1057
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:23,375
Come on, Shay.
Nobody else can be Bassanio but you!

1058
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,666
Is this about what happened
the other night?

1059
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:39,958
Look Shay, you have absolutely
nothing to be embarrassed about.

1060
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:43,166
And if there's... If there's anything,

1061
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,583
anything at all
that you want to talk about,

1062
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:48,125
-you know you can trust me.
-Like I did so earlier?

1063
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,250
Shay, I know you're angry,
and you're upset and...

1064
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:54,041
and I understand that.

1065
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:58,500
And...
and it's not a big deal being homosexual.

1066
01:23:58,583 --> 01:23:59,791
But I'm not!

1067
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,791
All I'm saying is
it doesn't matter.

1068
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:04,166
It doesn't matter if you're...
if you're black or white

1069
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,583
-or rich or poor or straight or gay--
-Stop it!

1070
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,708
You don't know what happens to faggots
and rats over here.

1071
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:12,583
You don't know this place, sir.
So stop it!

1072
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,000
Did someone say something to you?

1073
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,083
Do something?

1074
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,333
I just don't want to be a part
of this play, and that's about it, sir!

1075
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:25,458
Shay?

1076
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:29,208
-Shay, listen to me--
-Ma'am!

1077
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,041
-Ma'am, excuse me! Ma'am!
-Shay, what are you doing, Shay?

1078
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:34,375
Just leave me alone, sir. Please!

1079
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:37,708
OK.

1080
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,375
OK.

1081
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,541
Get well soon.

1082
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,125
What's wrong, love?

1083
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:01,583
So the surgeon thinks that
you might actually be able to walk?

1084
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:02,625
Shay?

1085
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:06,375
Nothing, Momma. I'm just... really tired.

1086
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:07,750
Got a bunch of stuff to do,

1087
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:10,625
volunteered for a lot of things,
class work pending,

1088
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,333
exhausted!

1089
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:13,750
And?

1090
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,375
And?

1091
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:16,791
What aren't you telling me, Shay?

1092
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:19,458
I mean, you know I'm going
to worm it out of you eventually, right?

1093
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,708
OK, so maybe you can help me with this.

1094
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:29,125
Suppose you've got enemies on both sides,

1095
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,541
and they're firing away at you,

1096
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:35,166
how do make your way... out?

1097
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:39,791
What's going on, son?

1098
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:43,250
It's just a part of my...
planning and strategy project.

1099
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:45,625
So, as a pilot, what would you do?

1100
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,541
Well, I think it's about two things.

1101
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:50,791
Focus and distraction.

1102
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,458
So you focus on your part

1103
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,125
and distract your enemies.

1104
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,416
They should get so tangled up
with each other that

1105
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,250
they forget all about you.

1106
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,291
Thanks, Mom.

1107
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,750
I think I'll speak to you tomorrow.

1108
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:08,916
Bye. I love you.

1109
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,375
Bye! Take care, huh?

1110
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,666
"'And I beseech you:

1111
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,708
rest the law to your authority

1112
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,833
to do a great right, do a little wrong,

1113
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,000
and curb the cruel devil of his will."

1114
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,416
Tell him exactly
what you told me last night.

1115
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:59,083
Tell him word for word
how he touched you inappropriately,

1116
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:01,875
how he tried to get you
to undress in class,

1117
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:05,708
how he convinced you to stay
and spend the night at his place,

1118
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:10,458
how he kissed you and misused
your trust. Tell him everything, Shay.

1119
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,166
Son,

1120
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:20,250
what Mr. Nair says, is it true?

1121
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,291
I've never trusted
that smooth-talking Tamilian.

1122
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,375
No background in education.
No recommendations.

1123
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,916
I... I know you like him, sir.

1124
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,625
But he was always suspicious.

1125
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:39,500
He gives up a fancy job
and comes here. Why?

1126
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,875
Only so he can be
amongst young, innocent kids.

1127
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,541
He's a predator, sir.

1128
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:49,416
And now he's molested one of our own.

1129
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:51,375
Shay?

1130
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,291
You want to say something?

1131
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,458
He's in shock, sir.

1132
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:01,041
You have the facts. Why would a child lie?

1133
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,791
Sir, because that's...
that's exactly what happened.

1134
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,958
He... he tried to kiss me,
and I pushed him away.

1135
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:08,625
This is an exceedingly
difficult situation, Murali.

1136
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:12,041
I wish really you had taken me
into confidence earlier.

1137
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:13,166
Sir, I...

1138
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:17,625
I was...
I was concerned about the boy, sir.

1139
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:21,750
To be confused
about your sexual orientation, to...

1140
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:24,125
to be rejected by someone
that you look up to, it's...

1141
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:25,708
It can be devastating at that age.

1142
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:28,333
And I didn't want him to deal with
more than he was already dealing with.

1143
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,791
But it makes no sense.

1144
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:33,041
Why should he accuse you then?

1145
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,958
I've clearly underestimated
how hurt he felt and...

1146
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,791
And this is obviously his way
of getting back at me, sir.

1147
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,500
I'm sorry, Murali.
There will be an official inquiry,

1148
01:28:44,291 --> 01:28:46,000
and you will have every chance
to defend yourself.

1149
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:49,291
No, sir. I can't.

1150
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:52,666
I can't do that to Shay.

1151
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:57,125
Then, there'll be no choice but to...

1152
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:58,708
I know.

1153
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,666
You'll have my resignation
by end of day.

1154
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,625
Sir, thank you for everything, sir.

1155
01:29:46,791 --> 01:29:50,166
"There's more depends
on this then on the while you,

1156
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:54,666
the dearest ring in Venice
will I give you and find..."

1157
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,416
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening. Good evening.

1158
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,875
Come on guys, settle down. Settle down.

1159
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,708
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1160
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:15,625
Uh, guys, uh...

1161
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,375
there's something
I want to share with you.

1162
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,833
I've resigned, with immediate effect.

1163
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,375
What?

1164
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,041
But why, sir? What happened?

1165
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:29,000
I'm afraid that's all I can
tell you at this point of time.

1166
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:31,458
But the play will, of course,
go on as planned.

1167
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:35,583
Uh, the deputy headmaster
will take on from here on.

1168
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,041
I'm so, so, so proud of each one of you.

1169
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,833
And I'm sure you guys
will put up an incredible show.

1170
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,166
And, uh... as they say, the...

1171
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:49,416
the show must go on.

1172
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:53,833
Break a leg, guys. Yeah?

1173
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,125
Can I squeeze in here?

1174
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:52,791
Listen, I'm... I'm really sorry, Shay.

1175
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:57,125
I... I shouldn't have said
what I said the other day.

1176
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:01,583
Boys, slick on the pitch, huh?
Got my eye on you.

1177
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:03,125
Come on.

1178
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:07,041
Boo.

1179
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,833
Son, how are you doing?

1180
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,291
Oh, man!

1181
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,625
You're looking weak.

1182
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:20,916
I forgot... the viral fever
must have been a killer? Huh?

1183
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,875
Wait.

1184
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:25,833
Waiter! Sandwiches
and hash browns here. Quick!

1185
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:41,833
See? I've got your back.

1186
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:46,541
Your back is mine.

1187
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:50,916
Shay, feels good
when Arjun's got your back, right?

1188
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:53,833
And I've got your front.

1189
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:57,083
Oh, by the way,
I'm doing Bassanio for you.

1190
01:32:57,416 --> 01:33:00,041
Here Arjun, no Shay, no drama teacher.

1191
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:02,958
Why is everyone quitting, huh?

1192
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:05,583
Baddy, Baddy, Baddy.

1193
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:07,625
Oh, you didn't know
your favorite...

1194
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,041
is going?

1195
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:13,708
No Housemaster in Gandhi House, huh?

1196
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:16,458
Fuck it, man! Let's celebrate.

1197
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,333
You bring the goodies for daddy, huh?

1198
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:26,500
Bon Appetit!

1199
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:40,708
Shay, I'm really scared.
They are never ever going to stop.

1200
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,125
And the best teacher had to go and resign.

1201
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:45,416
Yeah, man!

1202
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:48,833
Something must have happened
to his family or...

1203
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,125
Why would he leave?

1204
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,250
Yeah?

1205
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:55,625
Why would he give this up,
if he gave everything up for this?

1206
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,625
It just doesn't make any sense.

1207
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:03,708
Sorry, Ganzu! You have to help me.

1208
01:34:04,416 --> 01:34:06,541
Go on without me.
There's something I must do.

1209
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:07,541
What?

1210
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:10,083
Shay! Where is he going?

1211
01:34:10,166 --> 01:34:12,666
I don't know. Idiot. I don't know.

1212
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,000
Shay!

1213
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,083
Wait, wait, wait!

1214
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:24,708
Thank you, Daddy.

1215
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:27,916
No better use of your money.

1216
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,625
We did it, bitches! To all you boys!

1217
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,291
Isn't it a double whammy?

1218
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:39,083
Triple! Bassanio is mine,

1219
01:34:39,666 --> 01:34:43,416
that drama teacher is history,
and that gay boy is scared to death.

1220
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:45,416
I feel like the king of the world.

1221
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,791
Shh... Be quiet. We are too loud.

1222
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,458
Damn coward.

1223
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:55,125
You know...
I still can't figure out Shay, man!

1224
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:59,625
Is the guy a wuss
or does he have balls of steel?

1225
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:03,166
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

1226
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,666
No. I don't think so, man.

1227
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,333
I don't think so.

1228
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:12,791
Wh-- why would you lie--
Why would you do that to me, Shay?

1229
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,666
I was scared.

1230
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:20,958
We're all scared, Shay.

1231
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,166
Figuring out who you truly are
can be bloody scary.

1232
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,958
But lying is not the answer.
It doesn't solve anything.

1233
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:29,958
It... It only ruins peoples' lives, Shay.

1234
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:42,875
Shay, the world is a cruel place, Shay.
People will pull you down.

1235
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:44,750
And you know what?

1236
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:49,666
The more you... you're afraid,
the more you hide who you truly are,

1237
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,125
the more they come after you.

1238
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,208
Shay...

1239
01:35:57,208 --> 01:36:00,416
Shay, the...
the truth will set you free, Shay.

1240
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:04,625
The truth?

1241
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,541
-You want to know the truth?
-Oh my God!

1242
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:08,625
What the fuck--

1243
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:10,916
-What the fuck are you doing, Shay?
-Here is your truth.

1244
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:21,500
They raped me.

1245
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:26,125
And they're going to do it again
and again and again.

1246
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:30,958
Fuckers!

1247
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:34,083
Sir, wait!

1248
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,916
- Sir?
- Find them!

1249
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,041
I know where they are.

1250
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:54,791
- Guys! I heard someone coming.
- Fuckers!

1251
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:55,750
-The fuck?
-Murali?

1252
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:58,166
- What the fuck?
- Grab him. Get hold of him.

1253
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,625
- What are you doing?
- Who got this fucker here?

1254
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:02,875
Catch him! Hold him.

1255
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:04,958
I'm gonna show him
what it's all about.

1256
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:11,416
I know what you have fucking did to Shay!
I'm going to fucking make you pay!

1257
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,916
-Shay is gonna speak up and...
-Get off me, man. Get off me.

1258
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,291
I'll make sure of it. And when he does,
you are all going to jail.

1259
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:21,041
- Give me the fucking brick!
- Here Arjun, take the brick.

1260
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,041
Give me the fucking brick!

1261
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:24,291
Hit him harder.
Hit him. Keep hitting. Don't stop.

1262
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:28,708
-Now who will save you?
-Die, fucker! Die, fucker! Die, fucker!

1263
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:31,625
Hit him, hit him, Arjun.
Hit him harder. Harder!

1264
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:33,750
Hit him hard!

1265
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:36,541
You thought Shay would tell on us?
Shay's a part of us!

1266
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:37,708
He is a part of me.

1267
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:39,416
Let's see who comes to save him!

1268
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,500
- Me, me, me, me, me, me.
- Hit him! Take this and hit him.

1269
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:43,875
Kill him, Arjun. Kill him.

1270
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:48,125
Throw him in the bloody pool.

1271
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:50,875
- Drag and throw him.
- Let's finish him off today.

1272
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,875
Hurry! Hurry!

1273
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:55,041
Let's drown him and throw him.

1274
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,791
Let's drown him.

1275
01:37:56,875 --> 01:38:00,000
Drown the bloody asshole!

1276
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,250
Let's drown him.

1277
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:03,125
Beat him up.

1278
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,833
Beat him up.

1279
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:07,041
Beat him up.

1280
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,833
Guard!

1281
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:12,000
Guard. Switch
on the flood lights. There's some noise.

1282
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:13,458
Guys, the guards are coming!

1283
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:15,333
Guard, look if there is someone.

1284
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:17,875
Guard, there is something wrong.
Come quickly!

1285
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,041
Run fast!

1286
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:22,625
- Baddy, let's run!
- Arjun, I left my watch!

1287
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:26,208
Run! Hurry!

1288
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:17,750
Sir, please let me
talk to my father once...

1289
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,583
Sir, I'm innocent.

1290
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:23,916
Sir, the Commissioner of Mumbai Police
is my Papa's best friend. Please, sir!

1291
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:38,750
And with deep regret
and sadness I must inform you

1292
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:43,666
that our beloved headmaster
has opted for early retirement.

1293
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
The Headmaster had his way
of running this school.

1294
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,750
He let you run amok.

1295
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:54,916
But while things need
to be broken and tamed,

1296
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:58,208
boys need to be disciplined

1297
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:00,958
to become men by force of law.

1298
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:05,041
And that law, I will implement.

1299
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,500
And in view
of the recent, unfortunate incident,

1300
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:12,583
the Founder's Day
celebrations stand canceled.

1301
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:17,625
Now please join me in prayer.

1302
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:22,708
- Hello, Murali?
- Help me, sir.

1303
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:24,750
Please, sir. I need your help, sir.

1304
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:27,541
Other boys, they've...
they've beaten me up.

1305
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:33,000
Arjun, Baaadal,
Manav, Parag, Abby, all of them.

1306
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:35,291
Come quick, sir. I need your help, sir.

1307
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,166
"The villainy
that you teach me,

1308
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:45,083
I shall execute,

1309
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,708
and it shall go hard,

1310
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:53,166
but I shall better thee instruction."

1311
01:41:56,791 --> 01:42:00,958
"So may the outward shows
be least themselves,

1312
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:04,958
the world is still deceived with ornament.

1313
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:09,833
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,

1314
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,625
but being seasoned with a gracious voice,

1315
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:14,625
obscures the show of evil."

1316
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:29,000
"In religion, what damned error,

1317
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:32,125
but some sober brow
will bless it and approve it with a text,

1318
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:34,958
hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

1319
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,375
There is no vice so simple but assumes

1320
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:41,583
some mark of virtue on his outward parts."

1321
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:48,541
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

1322
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:51,583
I have no choice.
There's nothing I can do!

1323
01:42:55,666 --> 01:43:00,083
You... you understand, sir.
You understand. I don't have an option.

1324
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:01,875
They'll kill me!

1325
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,666
"How many cowards,

1326
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:09,750
whose hearts are all as false
as stairs of sand,

1327
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:11,750
wear yet upon their chins

1328
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:15,333
the beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,

1329
01:43:15,916 --> 01:43:19,291
who inward searched,
have livers white as milk,

1330
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,625
and these assume but valor's excrement
to render them redoubted."

1331
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,333
"Look on beauty,

1332
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:56,666
and you shall find 'tis purchased
by the weight..."

1333
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,916
"Which therein works a miracle in nature,

1334
01:44:00,416 --> 01:44:03,041
making them lightest that wear most of it.

1335
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,833
So are those crisped..."
