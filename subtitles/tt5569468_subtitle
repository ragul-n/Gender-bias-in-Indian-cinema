Don't touch my hair.

181
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,264
Really, attitude?

182
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,900
Oh hi, Julia!

183
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:58,935
Hi, Manveer.

184
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,369
He's my dad. Parghat.

185
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:01,940
- Hi, Parghat.
- Hi, Julia

186
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,436
Very confident.

187
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,802
- How old are you?
- Seven.

188
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,646
Papa, you shouldn't
ask girls their age

189
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,344
Fine. I understand what you are up to.

190
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,815
Bye, Pargham.

191
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:13,852
Bye, Julia

192
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,621
Get this straight.
She is okay as afriend.

193
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,121
But you will be marrying
into the Jat community.

194
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,492
I am so lame!

195
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,260
Your father seems very nice

196
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,526
Yeah, but my mom is
getting divorced from him

197
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,605
Oh, so you'll have
a new father then?

198
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:32,897
Yeah

199
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,073
Well, what kind of
a father do you want?

200
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,740
Depends on mom.

201
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,140
I hope he will be good

202
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,146
But I like Parghat.

203
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,057
Wait, dear. He'll be here soon.

204
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,597
- Hi, sir.
- Hello.

205
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:06,138
Hi.

206
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,209
Sorry, I am late
I have to drop offthe kid.

207
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,606
What's new in that?

208
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,472
Hold on, I just came.
Let me at least settle.

209
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,479
We will fight in a while.

210
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,515
Sorry. Yes?

211
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,281
Well, these are petty tiffs.

212
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,980
Why don't you sit
together and resolve them?

213
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:25,491
You are absolutely right, sir.

214
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,990
Anyway, one person alone
cannot bring up a child.

215
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:28,786
Wham say?

216
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:29,692
I will manage

217
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,722
The child isn't as
troublesome as he is sir.

218
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,327
He is, sir.

219
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,162
One child is as troublesome
as six women are.

220
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,736
Tell me something.

221
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,534
What problem do you have with him?

222
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,868
Sir, this is what I keep
asking as well. Vilham is the problem?

223
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,674
You try asking her.
Perhaps she might tell you.

224
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,435
Really?

225
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:44,974
You don't know?

226
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,780
I will know only if you tell me

227
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,007
Problem One:

228
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,814
I think you two don't
communicate with each other.

229
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,112
Unnecessary communication gap.

230
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,085
Exactly

231
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,791
After a few years of marriage,
ask him..

232
00:14:58,414 --> 00:14:59,916
...did he ever spend
quality time with me?

233
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,529
It's not so, sir.
We talked a lot in the beginning.

234
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,556
But slowly we released
how each other is.

235
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,924
We ran out of topics

236
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:07,563
Now what should I talk about, sir?

237
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,167
I come home tired.

238
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,699
I just wish to have a
drink or two and go to bed.

239
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,828
I have to go to work the next day.

240
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,769
Hence, I go out to
spend time with my friends.

241
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,308
Then why don't you spend
that time with me instead?

242
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,107
Because of them,
you forgot my birthday this time.

243
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,271
I didn't forget, sir.
I came home lame by two hours

244
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,972
How can I forget her birthday?

245
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:24,277
I wouldn't have become
a resident if she wasn't born.

246
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:28,082
So, was our love alie?

247
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,212
Was it because you wanted
to become a permanent resident?

248
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:30,513
It's not so, sir.

249
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,154
When I saw her for the first time,
I thought she is beautiful.

250
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,228
Okay? Then I learnt that
she is a permanent resident.

251
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,329
I thought I should give it atry.

252
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,692
What's the harm if we manage to click?

253
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,492
But I truly loved her after marriage.

254
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,896
I swear by plumbing, sir.

255
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,503
Let it be. It's done now.

256
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,565
I now know. All the problem is solved.

257
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,106
He got married to me to
become a permanent resident.

258
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,901
What problem do we have now?

259
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,102
What is the harm in that, sir?

260
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,040
Look, when people
get married in Punjab..

261
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,169
...elders get together
and discuss it through, right?

262
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,179
They see what the girl does.

263
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:58,114
The girl has a government job.
She is had done BEd. She's a teacher:

264
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,948
What does the boy do?
He is working in a bank

265
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,986
So, let's get them married.

266
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:02,178
Now my parents are not here

267
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,187
So here, lam going to decide
whol am going to marry, right?

268
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,552
So, I saw that she's a permanent
resident and got married to her.

269
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,489
What is the harm in that?

270
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,194
I didn't care if she
has a government job

271
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,189
There's a point in than, dear.

272
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,523
Oh please, that's enough.

273
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,891
Actually, it is my fault.

274
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,833
My mother told me that he is getting
married to me for permanent residence.

275
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,429
You will face trouble later in life.

276
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,728
Then why didn't you
listen to your mother?

277
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,034
I had fought with her.

278
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,743
Look at that, sir.
She fights with everyone

279
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,869
Just a few moments ago,
she said that's enough to you.

280
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,379
It's a different case
that you didn't mind it.

281
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,973
Moreover, your mother
isn't good in giving advices.

282
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,584
She comes up with
a new one every day, sir.

283
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:32,946
Everything that she
said turned out to be true

284
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,714
She had told me,
he would never take me to parties.

285
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,357
If he does
you'll be sitting with the ladies.

286
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,514
...and he will be sitting with the men

287
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,126
And if he ever takes you to shopping.

288
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,229
...then he will multiple
everything with 50.

289
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,625
Ask him. That's what he does

290
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,056
Listen to me, sir.

291
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:48,225
When my father sent me here, he had
multiplied by 50 and sent me, right?

292
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,836
Secondly as she spoke
about the party"

293
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,700
She doesn't fit into my social circle

294
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:54,067
The clothes she wears..

295
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,470
Sometimes they are so thin..

296
00:16:56,832 --> 00:17:00,245
We use thicker clothes than
that to cover bread in our village.

297
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,582
Then why don't you get a better
understanding of your culture?

298
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,645
Why don't you go in your
Bhangra costume to fix the taps?

299
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,049
Conservative thinking

300
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,419
Conservative what?

301
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,151
- I am conservative?
- Yes, you are

302
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,697
He has stopped giving me time. Hence,
I too got busy in my friend circle.

303
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,733
If my friends come over to meet
me or ifl go to meet my friends.

304
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:23,894
Oh God! He sulks for four days

305
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,730
Hold on, sir. You tell me
\Mves don't need to have friends, sir.

306
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,135
My mother doesn't have a friend.

307
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,434
My mother never said..

308
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,008
"Your father doesn't
spare time for me."

309
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,441
"I went to my friend
Nazar Singh's house."

310
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,979
"Nichchamar Singh showed up there."

311
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,446
"We kept chilling till 12:00am"

312
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,418
Listen, don't talk about your mothen.

313
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,345
"Forget about the past
and move fonlvard.

314
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:45,184
If you keep talking about the past
then you won't be able go forward.

315
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,026
You are right.
You are absolutely right.

316
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,861
I'll let it go.
Let's go ahead. I am done.

317
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,027
I want a divorce.

318
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:52,492
Thank you. Bye

319
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:53,464
This is what I want as well, sir.

320
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,168
I came here just because of Manveer.

321
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,596
Tell him not to talk about Manveer.

322
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,769
Does he even know in
which grade Manveer is?

323
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,867
How much did he score
in his last exams?

324
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,707
Have you ever gone to
his parent-teacher meeting?

325
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:07,709
I have been looking
after Manveer so far.

326
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:08,907
And I will do so
in the future as well.

327
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:10,981
Giving binh doesn't
make anyone afamher.

328
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,817
Don't use him and attempt a patch up.

329
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,820
Iam done with him

330
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,907
Wham do you think,
sir, will she come back?

331
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:41,478
She will.

332
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:47,120
If she is angry,
it means she wants to come back.

333
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:48,921
But after teaching you a lesson.

334
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,124
But even if the wife leaves
what difference does it make?

335
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,156
Let her go.

336
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,399
The world doesn't come to an end.

337
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,365
If someone old leaves the world,
someone new enters.

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,597
Best ofluck. God bless you.

339
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,572
Let it be

340
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,648
Let her do whatever she wants to.
She is no longer related to me anyway.

341
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,610
He might be just a friend.

342
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,211
There's no use asking

343
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,917
If I ask,
she will say he's her friend.

344
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:26,125
It's not like she will accept it.

345
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,164
Forget it. You can't be
bothered about the whole world.

346
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,523
You better live your own life

347
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,002
lfl ask her whom she was with,
she says I am suspicious.

348
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:50,005
She wants a divorce.
I will give her 5-7 divorces.

349
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,176
You can divorce her later.
First, do the job in hand.

350
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,979
This is where I have
been going wrong so far.

351
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,282
I have been only concentrating
on work until now.

352
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,889
I kept working hard and slogging.

353
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,617
I kept paying the mortgages.
I kept paying the bills.

354
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,292
Why are you wearing the gloves
Whom are you going to operate on?

355
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:03,325
- Check the wiring.
- Okay.

356
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,987
Tell me something, sir.

357
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,727
Ifl couldn't give time at home because
of work then what is the problem?

358
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,336
I think one shouldn't
get married at all.

359
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,060
Wham say?

360
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,901
Don't cross wire the
fitting in your fit of anger.

361
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,304
Don't talk about work.

362
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,442
It is my bread and butter.
I survive because of this.

363
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:20,504
My job is always perfect.

364
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,913
Sharp. Very Shal' P-

365
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,006
Amazing Great.

366
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:24,810
Do you want to check it, sir?

367
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:25,909
Yes

368
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:27,278
Let's go.

369
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,155
100 dollar; sir.

370
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,883
What? Can't you change it a little?

371
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:37,389
I can only change the flow.
Do you want me to change it?

372
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:39,556
Here you go.

373
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,161
- Let's go.
- Coming Let's go.

374
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,063
Bro! Bro! Bro!

375
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,196
You took money from
me just yesterday.

376
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,071
I don't want money.
Wham do I need for?

377
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:49,933
Then?

378
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,412
- Are you divorcing your wife?
- Yes.

379
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,448
Then she will be available, right?

380
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:56,472
Wham do you mean?

381
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,108
I mean, if you fix her up with me..
I will get permanent residency.

382
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,275
How?

383
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,685
She will stay in the family.

384
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:05,892
It will be your house.
You can do whatever you please.

385
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,890
There will be no problem from my end.

386
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,016
Whenever you want to meet Manveer.

387
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,493
Whenever you want.
You can do whatever you want.

388
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,086
- Just one condition.
- I want to take divorce from here..

389
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,256
...and not revenge.

390
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,862
You shouldn't be so courageous

391
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,263
The village is yet to set
up and the beggars are already here

392
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:21,904
- Bro! Bro!
- Yes.

393
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:23,772
At least pay me

394
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,608
You can take it tomorrow.

395
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,679
And then why do you
want to be permanent?

396
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:30,978
Getting married will
only make you impermanent.

397
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,852
She will keep insulting
you before others.

398
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,157
If you ever talk about this
again then I'll pull your ears.

399
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,425
Don't call out after I leave

400
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,237
How can he please anyone?

401
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,064
If his friend isn't happy
with him how will his wife be happy?

402
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,334
Leave What are you waiting for now?
To kill me?

403
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:06,847
Hey Julia,
why are you friends with him?

404
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,447
He's such afreak.

405
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,353
Why don't you go back to India?

406
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,855
Let's go, Julia

407
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:17,993
Why didn't you react?

408
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,857
I've seen lots of things in my life

409
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,263
But now these things do not affect me

410
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:24,693
Very mature.

411
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,137
Hey! What's up?

412
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:06,837
No, Facebook?

413
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:08,978
You are funny.

414
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:15,483
It's very cold today.

415
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,346
The weather here is unpredictable.

416
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,457
It keeps changing like a chameleon.

417
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,118
It was absolutely clear in
the morning And then it snowed.

418
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,066
I have been noticing
since the past few days.

419
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,668
You stay quite busy on the phone.

420
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,429
I don't have anyone else
Whom do I talk to?

421
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,865
You will know if you
lift your eyes off the phone.

422
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:36,374
There are many people you can talk to.

423
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:38,309
- Really?
- Yes.

424
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:42,148
- Are you from Pakistan?
- Yes. Lahore

425
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,644
I guessed it right.

426
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,112
I am from Amritsar.
We are neighbors.

427
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,151
I never knew.

428
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,516
We have been staying close
to each other from quite some time

429
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:50,819
Yes

430
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:54,856
Are you married?

431
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:57,389
Yes

432
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:58,864
Oh, sorry.

433
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:02,999
- Actually, I am a divorcee.
- Oh, wow.

434
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,998
I mean even I am
going through a divorce.

435
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,335
- Oh. So sorry.
- You are a divorcee

436
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:09,373
I too am a divorcee.

437
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,137
Too many divorcees, don't you think?
- Yes.

438
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,939
Mr. Peter's whole family..

439
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,976
It's very common these days.

440
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,280
So what caused it?
I mean what was the reason?

441
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,690
Nothing much.
He was very conservative

442
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,019
It's the same with me.

443
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,688
- My wife was very conservative.
- Really?

444
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,698
She used to ask me to wear Bhangra
costume and go for plumbing jobs

445
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,932
I was kept busy with
marriage and work

446
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:42,368
- Okay.
- I never made friends

447
00:24:42,797 --> 00:24:43,434
Oh.

448
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,375
Wham are you doing in the evening?

449
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:50,145
Nothing I am going for shopping
After than, I am free.

450
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:51,882
Then.

451
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,083
Dinner?

452
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,191
- Sure.
- O kay.

453
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:04,664
We will make it at my place.

454
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,364
- Your place?
- Yes.

455
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,428
Do you know how to cook?

456
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:12,068
Look Canada teaches you only two
things How to earn and how to cook

457
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:13,465
Really?

458
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,739
- See you later then.
- Yes.

459
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,274
- Bye.
- Bye.

460
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,981
Drive carefully
There's a lot of snow.

461
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,211
- Yes
- A lot of accidents happened today.

462
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,845
Okay.

463
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,049
Black ice.. I am sure you know.

464
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,023
- The car skids sometimes.
- Yes Okay. Sure.

465
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,184
- Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:35,954
Bye.

467
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:46,728
Keep driving.

468
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,110
Auntie, make a large one for me

469
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:58,343
I know, darling.

470
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:02,286
Come on, Jessica It's not a big deal.
It's a misunderstanding.

471
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:05,518
Such things keep
happening in every family.

472
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,055
Just get over it.
At least for Manveer's sake.

473
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,261
Look at him.

474
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,763
There is a vast difference in
the way he thinks and Parghat thinks

475
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,661
This is the difference
of basic education.

476
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:20,468
I had told you,
the guy should be a Canadian.

477
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:21,801
But you didn't get me.

478
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,141
You won't find anyone like Zora

479
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:25,944
I am sorry, Zora

480
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,939
I took your name without asking you.

481
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,140
Oh God, mom. Please

482
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:30,981
We are just friends

483
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,416
So what?
Can't friends become husband?

484
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,020
If a friend can become a husband..

485
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,145
...then it will end all
the enmity in the world.

486
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,115
Auntie, we went to school together'.

487
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,655
I never saw Jessica in that way.

488
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,930
Then grow up, man.
You can do that now.

489
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,429
Mom, please I am really sorry.

490
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:48,196
You have to stop this.

491
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,731
Anyway, I want to give
Parghat another chance

492
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,372
Chance? What is wrong with you,
Jessica?

493
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,602
Met take advantage
ofthis very weakness

494
00:26:57,732 --> 00:27:00,076
Look at me I too took a divorce.

495
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,079
Next day I was completely happy.

496
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,212
We haven't given birth to
them that we cannot leave them

497
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,211
Take a divorce and end the topic.

498
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:08,715
- Am I right, auntie?
- Absolutely.

499
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,047
You know it is not so easy for me

500
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:15,120
Fine, I don't know
whether he ever loved me.

501
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,797
But I loved him

502
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,035
Just.

503
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:27,632
Just a chance and..

504
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:30,541
I am sorry.

505
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,713
You are standing at the shore,
what sorrows hold you back?

506
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:43,415
Go on, I am still drowning.

507
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,358
I haven't drowned as yet.

508
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,325
Good.

509
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:52,123
Amazing

510
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,526
My sister is amazing.

511
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:56,295
My sister is a great poet.

512
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,831
Amazing
Superb. Fantastic.

513
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,903
She is wounded. She is hun.

514
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,564
Wham do you mean?

515
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,341
- I mean the man she married..
- Yes.

516
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,809
Her husband wasn't permanent.

517
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,379
God bless my wife.

518
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:10,775
She said we will settle
ourselves in Beijing later.

519
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,383
First let us settle down sister.

520
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,010
We caught the next
flight and came here.

521
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:24,661
Brother; this might be a little personal
but what brought you two together?

522
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,526
Okay.

523
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:28,133
It's a very long story but
I will make it shon and tell you.

524
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,327
One day I was wondering in the streets
of Beijing in the middle of the night.

525
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,961
- Ok.
- Four goons surrounded me.

526
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,830
I don't know from where she showed up.

527
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,401
She hit me black and blue
I said, don't hit me, save me.

528
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:41,707
You need to hit them

529
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:43,747
Then from the bottom
of my heart I said.

530
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:45,774
Oh What?

531
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,987
- Do you know what it means?
- No. Not at all.

532
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:49,184
I love you.

533
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,555
You need to say it to someone else.
Not to her.

534
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,823
Have some kebabs You look weak.
Your plane is also empty.

535
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:56,755
Take some

536
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:59,591
Someone is giving special
attention to someone.

537
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:01,332
Brother!

538
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:02,934
You cooked good food.

539
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:04,335
Whatever you say..

540
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,531
The food cooked by my
sister smells like Lahore.

541
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,072
Amazing

542
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,766
The food from Lahore and
Amritsar smell the same, brother:

543
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,441
Not just the smell.

544
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:16,446
People are also the same.
The same villages, the same streets.

545
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:20,017
The same language,
the same youth and the same childhood.

546
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:22,119
Brother, don't make
me recall my childhood.

547
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,779
Those sweet memories of my childhood.

548
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:26,188
Sour berries, sweet mangoes
Sweet breads.

549
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:29,721
- And a mother sweet scolding.
- Amazing.

550
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:32,930
Brother, too much sweet.
It causes worms.

551
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,196
Worms! What have
youjust reminded me of!

552
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:39,502
Worms!

553
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:40,605
You guys too get them?

554
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,233
Of course

555
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:46,742
Worms don't have a religion,
caste or country.

556
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,404
She too must be getting them.

557
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,778
Eating sugan.

558
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:53,809
Everyone gets them

559
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,547
In the childhood kids get worms..

560
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,288
Everyone is the world worries

561
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:00,925
A mother worries the most.
She keeps trying to find a treatment.

562
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,651
Father will go behind
you with his slippen.

563
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:03,455
"Now dare you eat more sugar!"

564
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,621
So true, brother:

565
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:06,894
Now look,
there is so much happening in life.

566
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,393
"But there is no
one to worry about us

567
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:12,896
I have decided that I will make
some money and go back to my country.

568
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:14,404
I am not going anywhere.

569
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:15,973
I am Canadian.

570
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:22,046
Brother, loneliness kills one.

571
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,774
If you find the right
companion is such countries"

572
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:28,018
...then one starts enjoying the place.

573
00:30:58,139 --> 00:30:59,641
Bro, you can look
at the photographs later.

574
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,720
Please give me a helping hand.
I am getting lame.

575
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,184
I need to go back and do the laundry.

576
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,618
Okay. I am coming after
sending this message

577
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,253
Do you know any emotional poetry?

578
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,329
The ones one sends
on anniversaries etc.

579
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:13,826
Whose it is?

580
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,832
Mine. I want to send
her a nice message.

581
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,903
You will send a message to your wife?

582
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:26,512
Where is that person who used
to say I don't care about anyone?

583
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:27,508
"She can do whatever she wants"

584
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,546
"She can go wherever she wants."

585
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:31,745
Beer has lost its fizz?

586
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,181
I sometimes say things I don't mean,
you know that.

587
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,580
Let me send her a message.

588
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:40,249
She will be angry ifl don't send one

589
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,225
This is a little different,
a little emotional.

590
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,291
Read it.

591
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,568
Fill it the glow and
let's get out of her.

592
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,679
Okay, so you are messaging Parghat.

593
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,748
Why not? Continue. Go ahead.

594
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:07,853
Tell him,
"forgive me, I made a mistake"

595
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:09,853
"I will die without you"

596
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,490
"Who will take care of me"

597
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,349
I have another idea.

598
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,192
Write a letter to him in your blood

599
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,791
"I am your slave."

600
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:20,524
oka)', Okay, okay. Stop.

601
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:23,429
I was only asking about Manveer.

602
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,868
I know you are asking about Manveer.

603
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,167
Students, I have this exciting
project to announce today.

604
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,932
The family heritage project.

605
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,411
I always look fonlvard
to this every year.

606
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:42,211
It gives us a chance to
talk about where we come from.

607
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:43,688
So, I will give you an example.

608
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,986
My father's from Canada, but my
mother actually comes from Scotland

609
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:52,832
Canada is a multicultural country.

610
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,795
And we have a lot of different people
come from a lot of different places.

611
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,500
So, I'd like for you to
include facts and photographs

612
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,140
Getting facts off the
internet is very easy.

613
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,015
Manveer,
your project is going to suck.

614
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,152
There is nothing
good about your country.

615
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:33,338
Thank you.

616
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,101
You are right, brother:
You are absolutely right.

617
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,537
Just kidding, brother:

618
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:42,715
Here you go.
Sister-in-law has made it.

619
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,645
This is my wife's favorite food.

620
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,011
- Only a little.
- Take it.

621
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,588
- That's enough.
- Try it.

622
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:50,947
Try it.

623
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,722
Eat it.

624
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,029
- What was this?
- This?

625
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,537
Cockroaches with onions.

626
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,200
- Sorry. Sorry.
- He must have got an onion.

627
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:13,311
It would have tasted delicious
if it were a cockroach.

628
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,207
- You too eat some.
- No, ldon't eat it.

629
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,610
I don't touch such things.
I am into greens and bread.

630
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:21,444
I too am into greens and bread.

631
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,554
Greens and bread reminds me of Punjab.

632
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,091
Punjab reflects in everything you say.

633
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,262
You can remove someone from Punjab..

634
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,090
But you can never remove
Punjab from a person.

635
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,933
You are being so poetic.

636
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:36,767
Amazing

637
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:40,938
It will be quite a pair
when two poets will get together'.

638
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:43,138
Listen.

639
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,238
Manveer?

640
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,643
Wham happened to him?

641
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,347
Oh, history of Punjab.

642
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:54,711
Let's read it together:

643
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,455
- Punjab has a great history and..
- Kids said that Canada isn't my country.

644
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,322
I want to go to Punjab.

645
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:05,859
You got influenced by kids?

646
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:08,033
So many intelligent people
told me and yet I didn't believe them.

647
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:09,963
It is such a beautiful country.

648
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,630
We won't leave it just
because people ask us to.

649
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,634
This is the problem.
Those kids insulted me.

650
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,232
They said that my country is bad.

651
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,045
Okay. Insult.

652
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:26,816
You know son,
insult is just like cold.

653
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:30,620
The more you think about
it the more you feel it.

654
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,785
I want to go to Punjab That's it.

655
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,890
Fine, we will go in the morning.
Go to sleep now.

656
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:47,066
Now shouldl go to Punjab or
the counselor's office in the morning?

657
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:48,973
Or should I go get the
tissue as we ran out of them.

658
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,706
Oh. I need to also
fix aflush urgently

659
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,153
Hey Tuti, you are not up as yet?

660
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:09,923
Who will switch offthe alarm?

661
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,255
Why should I switch it off?
I don't want to go to school.

662
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:13,990
What?

663
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:15,961
I don't want to go to school.

664
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:17,934
0h!

665
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,403
That's more like it!

666
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:25,269
Today I realized that you
are my son and I am your father.

667
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:26,910
You know I didn't
complete my education

668
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,306
I will take you to
school by your ears.

669
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,446
I don't want to go there.

670
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:35,247
- You will go there for sure.
- No, I don't want to go there.

671
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:38,687
Okay, bye-

672
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:41,252
Study well.

673
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,954
Your mother will come to pick you up.

674
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,591
Okay? Bye-bye.

675
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,016
Hi.

676
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:12,717
- Oh hi, how are you?
- I am very well.

677
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,089
I am sorry, I can't find Manveer.
Do you know where he is?

678
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,256
He didn't come to school today.

679
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:19,991
He.. he didn't come?

680
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,566
No. No. I haven't seen him.

681
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,562
Thank you.

682
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:26,703
No problem

683
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:28,740
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

684
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,203
Manveer!
Manveer! Wham are you doing over here?

685
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,677
What are you doing over here?
You know how scared I was?

686
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:09,610
- You didn't go to school?
- No.

687
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:12,149
- Does your father know you are here?
- No.

688
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,510
Let's go.

689
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,751
He couldn't take care
of his child for 15 days

690
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:25,255
"Don't mix up love
with a fake friendship."

691
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:28,760
"lf you don't wish to give
a hug then don't even shake hands."

692
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,261
Beautiful.

693
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:31,833
Very beautiful.

694
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:35,837
- It's very deep too.
- Not so much. Now your turn

695
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,808
I had brought a book
from the bus stand in India

696
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,005
There was a good one in it.

697
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,987
"L cannot tell my father,
mother, you cannot keep it hidden."

698
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,423
No, this wasn't in the book.
It was something else

699
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:53,491
I thought so.

700
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:57,423
"L cannot tell my father,
mother, you cannot keep it hidden."

701
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:00,863
"They say I am just a kid,
pampered by my parents."

702
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:04,867
"I wish to get married, mothen."

703
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,736
I won't be able to say it.
You go ahead with yours.

704
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:09,307
No. It's okay. Go ahead.

705
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:11,468
- No, you recite good ones. Go ahead.
- No.

706
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:13,010
- You.
- No, you recite one

707
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,636
- You.
- No, you recite one

708
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:15,406
You..

709
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,411
- No, you recite one
- You recite one.

710
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,109
Sorry, sorry.
I think I am interrupting

711
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,081
No, brother: No. Have aseat.

712
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,518
Brother;
your kitchen is in a bad state.

713
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:26,886
A house without a woman and
a woman without a house are useless.

714
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:27,550
Am I right?

715
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,055
Ifthere is a bulb switch on at home.

716
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,992
...and there is no one to
switch it off, then it is not far.

717
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:32,660
Didn't I say wrong?

718
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,059
I think you two are feeling shy.

719
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:37,836
It's okay.
You carry on I will look away.

720
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,369
No brother, sit.

721
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,871
Why are you making
him feeling uncomfortable?

722
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:46,106
Just kidding, sister.
Tell me, did you recite that one..

723
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:59,918
"Don't look at me with
such passionate eyes."

724
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:03,228
"Otherwise, I am sure to die."

725
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:06,957
You are..

726
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:09,830
Who are you?

727
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,833
Didn't they teach you
to knock before entering?

728
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:15,200
- Are you new here?
- My wife.

729
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,173
You didn't tell me about her.
Sister, put your feet down.

730
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,303
Hello. Hi.

731
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,840
Do you know where Manveer was?

732
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,872
Yes he had gone to school. I dropped
him off to school in the morning.

733
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,507
- Why?
- You don't need to pretend

734
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,721
I thought you are just
not concerned about me.

735
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:32,784
But I didn't know that you aren't
concerned about your child either

736
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,788
But I dropped him to school..

737
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,789
In your life, everything is
about you. Your life, your happiness

738
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,690
You don't deserve a relationship,
Pargham.

739
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:42,832
Enjoy your company.

740
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,598
She is my friend's sister.

741
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,365
They are my friends.

742
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:50,139
I have come to talk
to you for the final time.

743
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,344
I know that you like Jessica

744
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,810
Then what is the problem
is getting married with her?

745
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:55,810
VWthout sugar.

746
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:59,281
I love her.

747
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,813
But I don't want her
family life to be disturbed.

748
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,785
Anyway, she considers
me as her friend.

749
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:06,218
If I talk about the wedding,
then it won't look good.

750
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,318
I have no problem.

751
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,286
I am ready to marry Zora

752
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:31,340
"I feel scared at night."

753
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:38,953
"My eyes seek light."

754
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,825
"I will be happy."

755
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,356
"I will be happy."

756
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:52,165
"Just look at me with a smile"

757
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:57,526
"Keep this apple of
your eyes in your heart."

758
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:10,105
"Keep this apple of
your eyes in your heart."

759
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,034
Okay, I'll do it.

760
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:32,235
Just get out of my whole life.

761
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,002
Manveer!

762
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:44,152
"Mom, I am used to
sleeping in your arms"

763
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:51,560
"Papa, I am used to
sitting on your knees"

764
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:59,003
"Mom, I am used to
sleeping in your arms"

765
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:06,240
"Papa, I am used to
sitting on your knees"

766
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,880
"I haven't seen God."

767
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:13,380
"I haven't seen God."

768
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:18,752
"You should side me."

769
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,433
Be brave, son.
India is a really good country.

770
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:31,766
And your parents
they are really nice

771
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:32,700
Right?

772
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:38,799
I think your child is
suffering from depression.

773
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:43,376
He thinks this isn't
his country anymore.

774
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:47,646
And after your divorce, his
father too will be separated from him.

775
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:52,451
Hence, he thinks he can no
longer look into his friends' eyes.

776
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,783
It happens.
Kids are sensitive

777
00:43:56,583 --> 00:44:01,259
Hence, both of you will
need to take good care of him

778
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:05,530
Fine.

779
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:08,800
If you two cannot be
together then can you do this?

780
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:13,205
Take him to India and show him
that his country is a beautiful one.

781
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,077
He is a good boy.

782
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,618
You are right, doctor.

783
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,256
But do we show its beauty?

784
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,663
We can show beauty only
if it is beautiful, right?

785
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,703
Don't you see the news?
Or don't you have a Facebook account?

786
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,533
Look, you will have do it.

787
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:45,704
Ican try.

788
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:50,242
Let it be. He is in depression
over here, so over there he'll..

789
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:55,348
No, India is indeed
a beautiful country.

790
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:56,614
It has its own beauty.

791
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,951
Yes, it is indeed
it has a lot of beauty

792
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:03,651
Like unemployment, bribery..

793
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:08,390
"Drug; traffic,
bullet; farmers suicide..

794
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,735
Tell me honestly, docton.

795
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,729
If lndiawas better than Canada.

796
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,539
"Then would you have come to Canada?

797
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,368
Wouldn't you have opened
a clinic in your village?

798
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:24,280
Nothing is wrong with him.
he is absolutely fine

799
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:31,679
When I was small someone told
me that a lizard fell into waten.

800
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,689
...and someone died
after drinking that water.

801
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,727
Fearing that I didn't
water for quite some time.

802
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,692
I was about to die from dehydration

803
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,125
Slowly everything went back to normal.

804
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:41,127
He too will be fine He doesn't
have much to worry about anyway.

805
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,399
My son will be fine, right?

806
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,729
Manveer, let's go.

807
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:52,201
Thank you, doctor.

808
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,140
- You are welcome.
- Let's go.

809
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,977
Look, don't lose hope.
At least make an attempt towards this.

810
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:04,117
Sure.

811
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,282
I'll talk to the prime minister:

812
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,485
I'll tell him,
my son needs to visit India

813
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,524
Please make India better
than Canada for a few days

814
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:32,640
Down with - This government.

815
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:36,277
Down with - This government.

816
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,514
We will destroy it!

817
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,457
Down with - This government.

818
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,085
Down with - This government.

819
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:44,821
Hello?

820
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,460
Hello, father.

821
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:48,225
Yes?

822
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:49,494
Hello, father.

823
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,100
Hello, dear. How are you?

824
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:53,967
Is everyone fine? Hale and hearty?

825
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:55,402
Yes yes. All is fine.

826
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,571
- How are you?
- Yes?

827
00:46:57,764 --> 00:47:01,507
Father, Manveer wants
to come to Punjab.

828
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:02,943
My grandson is coming?

829
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,906
Brar's grandson is coming?

830
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:15,786
You have added four years
to my life by saying than.

831
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:19,127
Come quickly.
I say you just come quickly.

832
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:24,295
- But there is a small problem
- Yes?

833
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:30,567
Can we somehow show Manveer
that Punjab is better than Canada?

834
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,500
- Yes?
- Father?

835
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,475
Can we somehow show Manveer
that Punjab is better than Canada?

836
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:50,228
What's happening over there?

837
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:54,090
It's nothing. It's festive time.
People are bursting firecrackers.

838
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:55,859
. Vvh _ Move!
at haPPened?

839
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,594
It hit my bum

840
00:47:57,691 --> 00:47:59,602
I'll talk to you later. I need to run!

841
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,932
Run?

842
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,899
Like you run everyday, dear.
Now I need to run. Bye.

843
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,937
Hit them! Hit them!

844
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:08,375
It is hurting me

845
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:09,537
You!

846
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,612
Leave!

847
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:12,274
- Watch out!
- It really hit me!

848
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:14,374
Stop scaring me like that!

849
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:17,148
Headman, why did you
have to do that protest?

850
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,889
I can't help it. I am helpless.
I need to be with the people

851
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,085
lfl don't then they said
that I don't support them.

852
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:24,754
He made my bum hun.

853
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,663
Wham can I say? We too are helpless.

854
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,829
We get strict orders
from the headquarters

855
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:32,970
Othenuise, would we want
to hit people like you with sticks?

856
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,004
Our helplessness always
gets the better of us

857
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,472
- Here, sign over here.
- Give. Where do I need to sign?

858
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,744
Take this.

859
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:45,948
Yes, dear?

860
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:47,048
Did you finish your run, father?

861
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,414
Yes I am very tired. Don't ask.

862
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:51,154
What were you saying?

863
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:53,155
Punjab what than Canada?

864
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,518
We need to show its better.

865
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:56,317
What is wrong with you?

866
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,697
54 rupees is equal
to one Canadian dollar.

867
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:01,459
If the rupees keeps
rising every year..

868
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:03,067
...then we won't be able to
compete with it for another 54 years.

869
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:04,464
What are you talking about?

870
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:06,365
No, no, no. This is impossible.

871
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,072
I know it is difficult.

872
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:15,774
But Manveer isn't well.

873
00:49:17,904 --> 00:49:19,281
We don't know what's wrong

874
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,083
They said, he has depression.

875
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:29,786
Someone told him something in school..

876
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:34,962
He isn't talking to anyone
He isn't eating anything.

877
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,767
He isn't saying anything.

878
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,666
They said that.

879
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:45,937
We will have to take him to Punjab

880
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:50,111
They say that if he
doesn't come out of it..

881
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,850
...then he will face more
problems once he grows up.

882
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:55,512
It's okay. It's okay, dear. Don't cry.

883
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:57,549
Don't cry, my child. Don't cry.

884
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,350
You shouldn't cry, dear.
I will do something

885
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:01,515
I will do something about it.

886
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:02,726
Don't worry.

887
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:04,362
Don't worry. I will do something.

888
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,253
Thank you, father.

889
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:10,028
Please try.

890
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:16,507
So, this is what it is in brief.

891
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:24,178
We need to change
for good for 15 days.

892
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:25,345
Okay?

893
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,888
I shouldn't be saying this
I don't want to say it either.

894
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:33,323
No more local brewing.

895
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:35,959
And there will be no loitering around
in the streets in a drunkard state.

896
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,084
This is my only request.

897
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:38,753
Oh great headman!

898
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:40,796
Just because your
grandson is visiting you..

899
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:42,127
...you want all the
villagers to stop drinking?

900
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:44,969
Is your grandson visiting u;
or some prince?

901
00:50:45,158 --> 00:50:48,901
You are right.
I didn't want to say it but"

902
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,603
If it would be great
if you can do that.

903
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:55,907
Wham are you doing, uncle?

904
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:59,546
According to Canada's list,
spitting is prohibited.

905
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:00,981
No spitting?

906
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:03,054
Where do I spit then? In his pocket?

907
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,688
Or should I sell it in the bank?

908
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:06,849
They can use it to count money.

909
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,126
Today you say that I should spit.

910
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:10,785
Next, you will say
that I cannot sneeze

911
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,555
Then, you will say that I cannot burp

912
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,427
Then, you will say that I cannot fan.

913
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:17,262
In this manner,
you will stop our innate reflexes

914
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:20,531
He is right as well.

915
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,934
Do we wish to stop
his innate reflexes?

916
00:51:22,095 --> 00:51:23,938
It is a very natural thing

917
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:24,734
Right.

918
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:27,344
He is right.
But his manners are wrong.

919
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:29,140
Listen to me.

920
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:33,781
Whatever we do we in front
of that kid, we need to be polite.

921
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:35,512
Don't spitting in
your fists repeatedly.

922
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,517
One more thing

923
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:42,190
Whenever you pass each other,
without differentiating"

924
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,558
"between male and female,
you will smile at each other.

925
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:46,528
How can anyone do that!

926
00:51:46,787 --> 00:51:50,098
I will behead the one
who even looks at my wife!

927
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:51,668
He is right as well.

928
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:55,702
We should behead anyone who looks
at anyone's wife, sister daughter'.

929
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,331
- He is absolutely right.
- Yes.

930
00:51:57,798 --> 00:51:59,800
I am your headman

931
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,708
I help you when you are in need.

932
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:03,143
Now it is your turn, right?

933
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:04,977
Wham have you done for us, headman?

934
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:07,016
You have always only
stolen from our village

935
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,948
You had said that you would
install computer in our village

936
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,350
Tell me, where are they?

937
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:12,684
- I had said so?
- Yes.

938
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:14,190
"When?
- Hey__

939
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:17,427
I must have said
so in a drunkard state.

940
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,121
You are unnecessarily
bringing up ghosts of the past.

941
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:21,129
Tell me,
what will you do with a computer?

942
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,392
Have you seen your
face in the mirror, uncle?

943
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,730
Do you think you can run a computer?

944
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:27,135
You should be running
a bar or something

945
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,964
Wham if you run your
computer into someone?

946
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,938
Mind your language.

947
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:33,634
I can even make you run,
that too without any gears

948
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,872
We can no longer be fooled, headman.

949
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:37,606
We won't be fooled by you anymore.

950
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:40,878
We voted for you.
Wham did you do?

951
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:41,815
Tell us.

952
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,718
You arejust acting stubborn now.

953
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:49,485
What ifl say that you took Rs.
1000 to vote for me?

954
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,259
Look at me

955
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,261
I have noted in my diary.
You can ask him.

956
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,697
I think none of you
are going to listen to me.

957
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,701
Let it be. I will talk to Pargham.

958
00:52:58,825 --> 00:53:00,270
How can you do that?

959
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:01,836
Listen to me, villagers.

960
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,905
If my grandson doesn't
come here because of all of you..

961
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:06,534
...then I will be yourworst enemy.

962
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,839
Look into my stomach.

963
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:12,814
I have so many desires! When he
will come, he will bite my stomach.

964
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,946
If my grandson doesn't come here..

965
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,380
...then you will find my dead
body in front one of your fields.

966
00:53:17,577 --> 00:53:19,784
It is also possible that
I tear my veil before I die

967
00:53:20,013 --> 00:53:22,516
Then don't say that the
old hag got two cases on you

968
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,857
Have some shame
These people respect me.

969
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:26,362
Ijust saw how much they respect you

970
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,126
None of them listened to you

971
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,632
If you don't listen to me,
how will they listen to me?

972
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:32,896
Be grateful that I stayed with you.

973
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:34,495
You should be grateful
that I stayed with you

974
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,074
You tell us not to fight
when your grandson comes over.

975
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:38,437
But both of you aren't
stopping either.

976
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,439
Let's go, villagers.

977
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,273
Hold on

978
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,513
You guys have stooped so low now?

979
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,042
Can't you change
for good for a few days?

980
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:50,916
You forgot your history.

981
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:53,252
When did you blood turn white?

982
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,485
When did your conscience die?

983
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,026
You need to wake up conscience.

984
00:53:57,183 --> 00:53:59,789
Whenever Punjabis
have been in trouble.

985
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,560
...they have come together
and fought against it.

986
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:07,296
When warriors and the braves one
used to fight, a poet had written"

987
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,067
People have the illusion
that we are just a handful.

988
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:15,670
Even dead won't be an end to us,
we are so many in number.

989
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,645
Get together once again.

990
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:22,082
Tell the world that we are no less.

991
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:24,478
Long live.

992
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:29,954
Long live.

993
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,367
Lambardan. get up Let's go.

994
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:43,336
Wait.

995
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:47,671
When I won, I had paid some Rs.
500, some Rs 1000 to vote for me.

996
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,672
And in exchange,
I had asked for five years from you.

997
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,045
Now I ask you for 15 days.

998
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,850
And I will pay double the money.

999
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:56,249
From Rs. 2000 to Rs. 5000.

1000
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:58,080
Long live Revolution!

1001
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,054
Long live Revolution!

1002
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,853
Long live Revolution!

1003
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:03,359
Long live Revolution!

1004
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:05,690
Yes, we have made our
village better than Canada

1005
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:07,965
That's great, father. Thanks

1006
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:12,503
Just ask Parghat to send
me a grant of 25,00,000 or so.

1007
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:13,603
Grant?

1008
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,839
I am the headman here, dear.

1009
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:18,739
I am used to asking for grants.
Tell him to send me Rs. 25,00,000.

1010
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:20,003
I need it.

1011
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,611
Oh Okay. Okay, father.
It's not a problem. We will send it.

1012
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,883
But try to use it
for the village itself.

1013
00:55:29,142 --> 00:55:31,179
What are you saying, dear?

1014
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:33,723
I am the headman for wllagerg
and not for the family members.

1015
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:34,882
Thank you, father.

1016
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,292
Bye. I will see you soon

1017
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:39,958
- Guess what?
- What?

1018
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:41,798
We are going to Punjab!

1019
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:42,865
Oh really?

1020
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:07,817
"It is different from all!"

1021
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:12,487
"It is different from all!"

1022
00:56:22,595 --> 00:56:25,303
"Jams hold their pride high."

1023
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:27,344
"Young males are going to the fair!"

1024
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,847
"The sticks on the shoulders clashed."

1025
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:34,418
"The sticks on the shoulders clashed."

1026
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:36,487
"Now it will cause a storm"

1027
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:39,750
"The girls are wearing
cleaned slippers"

1028
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:43,460
"The girls are wearing
cleaned slippers"

1029
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,460
"And they have a
smile on their faces.."

1030
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:50,557
"Now the girls dance
in a carefree manner!"

1031
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:03,538
"Look the chiefis on his knees."

1032
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:07,982
"Sister-in-law, look Baba Bishana. "

1033
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:10,645
"Sister-in-law, look Baba
Bishana the devil has changed."

1034
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:17,251
"Now everyone gets
together at the square."

1035
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:19,590
"Now everyone gets
together at the square."

1036
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,721
"And everyone is heard."

1037
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:26,566
"Now the girls dance
in a carefree manner!"

1038
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:29,998
- Hello?
- Hello, father.

1039
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,868
Hi, son. How are you?

1040
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,611
Why do you sound so sad?

1041
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,680
No, jusL.

1042
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,010
Ijust felt like talking to you.

1043
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,118
Oh really?
You are really missing me today.

1044
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:43,812
Usually whenever I call you,
you seem to be in a hurry.

1045
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,218
What is wrong?

1046
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:47,514
Anyway, you are coming
day after tomorrow"

1047
00:57:47,614 --> 00:57:49,560
Then we will get together and talk

1048
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,759
- We?
- Yes, we

1049
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:54,460
I cannot say Canada

1050
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,131
But we have made something out of it.

1051
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,462
You can come and take a look at it.

1052
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:02,266
Once he meets his grandpa,
he will forget Canada and America!

1053
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:05,241
Be strong See you. Bye.

1054
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,490
Let's go, Manveer.

1055
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,898
Okay, bye-

1056
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:30,795
I am doubtful Manveer
will get well over there.

1057
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,435
But you can make an attempt.

1058
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,094
- Take care of his health
- Okay.

1059
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:47,310
Your ex-wife

1060
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:49,353
Oh wow. What brings you here?

1061
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:50,846
Are you too going to India?

1062
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:52,147
You too?

1063
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:53,087
- No.
- Thank God.

1064
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:53,884
- You?
- Oh God!

1065
00:58:54,013 --> 00:58:55,048
- Hello, brother:
- Hi!

1066
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:56,354
Business or economy?

1067
00:58:56,749 --> 00:58:58,660
It has to be business After all,
his uncle is going with him.

1068
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,225
- I am flying economy.
- Are you too going, papa?

1069
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:04,132
Yes son. I too am going there.

1070
00:59:04,324 --> 00:59:05,496
Wham a co-incidence, isn't it?

1071
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,730
But brother, you already
knew that they were going to India

1072
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,397
You are going after
doing all the planning

1073
00:59:09,762 --> 00:59:10,604
Planning?

1074
00:59:10,897 --> 00:59:11,932
Now what is this drama?

1075
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:14,075
Jessica, you are not going

1076
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:15,804
Mother, I am not going there for fun.

1077
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:17,472
You know how many
flushes I have to repair?

1078
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:18,708
I am going for Manveer.

1079
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:20,476
These two won't be able
to take care of him.

1080
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:22,519
You don't need to worry.

1081
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:24,482
I will take care of everything

1082
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:27,715
Look, we too don't
want him to go with you

1083
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:29,593
But I advice you to take him with you

1084
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:32,526
God forbid if anything goes bad,
he will make it worse

1085
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:33,927
I mean he will make it good

1086
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:35,760
It's okay, Jessica Don't worry.

1087
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:37,731
Moreover, there is one more condition.

1088
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:39,767
Actually, it's a request.

1089
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,936
My family doesn't know
that we are taking a divorce

1090
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:43,332
Please don't tell them

1091
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,500
You should be all
smiles in front of them

1092
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:47,134
- Just a little, not too much.
- No.

1093
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,005
Just sometime;
when they are in front of you.

1094
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:50,113
Smile alittle

1095
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,450
Brother, if she has your
permission she will laugh sometimes.

1096
00:59:52,538 --> 00:59:54,540
That's okay.
But tell them about the divorce

1097
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:57,117
Thank you, I will tell them as
soon as I get an opportunity

1098
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,245
Okay, that's enough.

1099
00:59:59,646 --> 01:00:01,785
We are leaving.
Manveer, let's go. Bye.

1100
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:03,249
Manveer, I am coming.

1101
01:00:39,686 --> 01:00:41,222
Balkar Singh's grandson is coming

1102
01:00:41,788 --> 01:00:44,428
I will expose the
drama he has been doing.

1103
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:48,002
If I don't expose the truth in front
of him then don't call me Gajjan.

1104
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:49,629
I don't understand these people.

1105
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:50,933
They will keep slogging
to death for five years.

1106
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,941
But during elections
as soon as they see the money..

1107
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:54,340
...they will pee on the spot.

1108
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:55,907
Bloody double-tongued scoundrels.

1109
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,578
I don't trust you guys either.

1110
01:00:58,004 --> 01:00:58,709
Drink some tea

1111
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:01,045
No. After all he is
your brother's grandson.

1112
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:02,050
Wham brother?

1113
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:03,552
He has always only
stolen from our village

1114
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:05,687
His grandson is coming here
But what about our grandsons?

1115
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:07,883
We have kept our grandsons
away from our village

1116
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:08,787
They have come from the city.

1117
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,417
Look, there is no
charm on their faces

1118
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:12,429
Take your tea

1119
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,060
- Take it, Gurdev Singh.
- Give it to me

1120
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:45,651
"Come soon, oh my beloved."

1121
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:47,493
"My eyes are getting
tired of waiting.."

1122
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:49,191
"Come back soon."

1123
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,393
"Come back,
my hean eagerly awaits you."

1124
01:01:51,524 --> 01:01:53,504
"I cannot stay alone anymore."

1125
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,470
"Alone.."

1126
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,469
"Waiting for you is killing me"

1127
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:01,374
"Waiting for you is killing me"

1128
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,916
"Waiting for you is killing me"

1129
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,363
"You have turned my face into stone."

1130
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:30,965
"You have turned my face into stone."

1131
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:36,809
"Let the eyes shed tears,
oh my beloved."

1132
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:42,749
"Let the eyes shed tears,
oh my beloved."

1133
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:45,922
"Oh my beloved!"

1134
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,788
"Oh my beloved!"

1135
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:51,794
"Oh my beloved!"

1136
01:02:51,884 --> 01:02:55,422
"Oh my beloved!"

1137
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:04,597
"My sightseeing is going weak,
but the wait isn't over."

1138
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,368
"Come back at least now."

1139
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:08,537
"Come back, I plead to you."

1140
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,477
"You should know, I am dying."

1141
01:03:10,603 --> 01:03:12,640
--
 am dying."

1142
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,682
"But this period of separation
doesn't seem to come to an end."

1143
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:18,482
"But this period of separation
doesn't seem to come to an end."

1144
01:03:18,678 --> 01:03:23,559
"But this period of separation
doesn't seem to come to an end."

1145
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:40,633
So my brave son,
how did you like our Punjab?

1146
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:42,505
Amazing
- Isn't it better than Canada?

1147
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:46,448
This new trend of
dancing in the fields.

1148
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:47,548
It is absolutely amazing

1149
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,347
The happy farming of Punjab.

1150
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:52,182
- I am sure Obamawill hear about this.
- Yes.

1151
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:53,222
I am sure it must have been your idea

1152
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:54,822
Yes brother: It has all been my idea.

1153
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:56,288
So Manveer, did you like it?

1154
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:58,256
Yes, I really like it.

1155
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,495
- Like it.
- He likes it.

1156
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:05,462
How did you like Punjab, dear?

1157
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:08,404
I thought it is amazing
It's beautiful.

1158
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:12,642
I wonder why do people
leave this place to go to Canada!

1159
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,503
Why don't they permanently stay here?

1160
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:19,078
Now tell me, how can you stay
where you are not destined to stay.

1161
01:04:19,205 --> 01:04:20,149
- So true.
- So true.

1162
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:24,378
Pargham, did you miss us over there?

1163
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:25,920
You ask ifl miss you guys uncle?

1164
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:29,250
Only my body has gone there
My hean is still here.

1165
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:31,256
Ye; he is absolutely right.

1166
01:04:31,884 --> 01:04:33,227
His hean is still over here

1167
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:35,061
He didn't take it to Canada

1168
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:37,132
Stop it now.

1169
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:38,826
You are so sweet!

1170
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:40,770
They make such a cute couple.

1171
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:43,703
They look good together:

1172
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:45,706
They make a beautiful couple.

1173
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:47,602
My grandson is also very beautiful.

1174
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:49,269
He is my grandson.

1175
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:52,312
He smells like me. Let me tell you.

1176
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:55,978
Hey, as if you smell good.
You always stink.

1177
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:57,911
She is just joking, son

1178
01:04:58,177 --> 01:05:00,088
Here son, this is your
wedding reception's invite.

1179
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,155
Wedding reception?

1180
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:07,128
Reception? It was not needed, mother.

1181
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:12,164
You should give the
money to the poor instead.

1182
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,129
Or you could have gotten
group weddings done.

1183
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:16,467
You don't want a reception?

1184
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,369
You got married and settled in Canada

1185
01:05:18,631 --> 01:05:20,167
I have given around Rs.
2.5 lakhs as gifts.

1186
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:21,277
Don't I have a right to recover it?

1187
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:23,107
It's a desire, dear.

1188
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:25,509
Of the villagers as
well as the relatives

1189
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:31,852
Yes. Now if everyone is insisting
then for how long can we refuse?

1190
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:33,451
And then, Manveer is also here

1191
01:05:33,813 --> 01:05:38,319
He will get a chance to attend
his parents' wedding reception.

1192
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:43,059
You also complete you wish.

1193
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,671
What is wrong with her?

1194
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,307
I think she felt shy after hearing
us talk about the wedding reception

1195
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:55,777
But the way she got up,
she didn't look shy.

1196
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,848
Now in what proper manner
should she feel shy for you?

1197
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,416
- This is how atired person feels shy.
- True.

1198
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,311
Let's go home now.

1199
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:05,178
Bye.

1200
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,755
Let's go to the bar then

1201
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,682
No, I mean the fields.

1202
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:10,586
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Hurry up

1203
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:11,888
Drink it, there's a sip left.

1204
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:13,093
Let's go.

1205
01:06:14,086 --> 01:06:15,759
Stan moving now.

1206
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,228
Finally.

1207
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:24,672
What is this function?

1208
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:30,143
It's just like awedding reception

1209
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:33,148
Villagersjust eat
and have a gala time.

1210
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:35,309
I didn't ask for a definition.

1211
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,312
I am asking for the reason.

1212
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,686
Why did they keep this pany, Parghat?

1213
01:06:39,879 --> 01:06:40,550
I don't know.

1214
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:42,717
I too was surprised
to hear about it, Jessica

1215
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:44,924
My meal came up from my stomach

1216
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:46,189
Oh God.

1217
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:49,758
One lentil's dish..

1218
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:52,392
Two dry veggies and chicken
That's all people would like to eat.

1219
01:06:52,491 --> 01:06:54,596
It's no use telling this idiot
anything I am going to meet the cook.

1220
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,701
Okay, okay. You have to stop them.

1221
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,809
Please Please, Parghat.
Just stop them.

1222
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:03,473
Well, lwill try.
But it's not in my hands

1223
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:04,806
It is all your fault.

1224
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,378
If you wouldn't have
insisted on coming here..

1225
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:07,882
...then they wouldn't have
printed the wedding invites

1226
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,149
It is so difficult for me too.
Think about it.

1227
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:13,416
I will be sitting with
someone's future wife

1228
01:07:15,314 --> 01:07:16,019
It's okay.

1229
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:18,559
We will somehow manage this difficult
situation with a smile on our face.

1230
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:19,391
Oh please

1231
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:20,962
I don't know what have
I gotten myself into.

1232
01:07:22,655 --> 01:07:26,797
She says I felt shy. Don't feel shy,
this is your own house

1233
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:29,236
She loves me a lot.

1234
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:32,673
Look, how much your
parents love each other.

1235
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,037
- Don't they, son?
- Yes.

1236
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:40,907
The dinner was so tasty, mother.

1237
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:43,485
I swear, I was yearning to
eat the food cooked by my mother.

1238
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:44,020
Yes

1239
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,589
I didn't cook it, son.

1240
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:47,384
My daughter-in-law cooked it.

1241
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,584
Oh really? But you must have
been standing next to her, right?

1242
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,759
Even a mother's shadow
makes the food tasty

1243
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:54,626
Yes, son. lwas standing close to her.

1244
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:56,324
- She is very nice.
- Yes.

1245
01:07:56,689 --> 01:07:59,499
When she came, she said I
will do all the household chores.

1246
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:02,435
Cooking, handling the dung cakes.
Cleaning the utensils.

1247
01:08:02,962 --> 01:08:04,305
She is very affectionate.

1248
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,609
- Let's go to bed, son.
- Yes.

1249
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:07,277
Okay?

1250
01:08:07,366 --> 01:08:08,811
But we won't let her do it,
will we, mother?

1251
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,275
We will handle it on our own

1252
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:12,379
- We won't let her work
- No.

1253
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,381
- And son..
- Yes?

1254
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,883
I am not like my mother-in-law.

1255
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,580
Two days after my marriage,
she tied her veil on her head

1256
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,585
She said she is an asthma patient.

1257
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,382
She stayed alive for another 10 years.

1258
01:08:22,648 --> 01:08:24,525
Nothing happened to her.
She was as healthy as a horse.

1259
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:27,029
She was waiting for my mother to die.

1260
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:28,889
When we got her eyes operated.

1261
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:30,931
...she had kept the stove
right next to her bed.

1262
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,967
The smoke gave her
eyes an asthma attack

1263
01:08:33,092 --> 01:08:34,070
Oh my mother!

1264
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,639
Don't teach him bad things.

1265
01:08:35,795 --> 01:08:36,637
As if she was a good human being.

1266
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:38,137
It was only me how managed
to survive living with her.

1267
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,531
And plus you and your family.

1268
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,033
And plus you and your family.

1269
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:41,777
- Shut up. You better shut up
- Crazy guy.

1270
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,938
She was good for nothing
and she is finding faults in others.

1271
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,743
Stop it, father.
You are the smart one.

1272
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,310
Dear, is this how you fight with him?

1273
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:50,651
Tell me

1274
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,418
N o.

1275
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,519
- No.
- No. No..

1276
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:56,752
We don't fight.

1277
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,522
Why will we fight? She is very good.

1278
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:01,427
Only fortunate ones get such wives.

1279
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,030
She doesn't eat till
I don't come home

1280
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:04,759
Really?

1281
01:09:05,024 --> 01:09:07,800
- Yes. Yes.
- And what about him? Tell me

1282
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:09,133
Do you have any
complaints against him?

1283
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,037
Tell him that I too am good.

1284
01:09:13,165 --> 01:09:15,304
Yes. He is very good

1285
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:21,511
He does much more than what
a wife expects her husband to do.

1286
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,745
My son is very nice.

1287
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,689
But let me tell you something.

1288
01:09:26,178 --> 01:09:28,419
There are many people
here who marry Canadian girls..

1289
01:09:28,547 --> 01:09:30,026
...to get permanent residency.

1290
01:09:30,115 --> 01:09:32,026
Let me tell you
They are very selfish.

1291
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:33,357
You are absolutely right, father.

1292
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,432
- Enough, Jessica
- Such boys are very..

1293
01:09:35,554 --> 01:09:36,794
What are you guys talking about?

1294
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:38,059
Tell him about the time.

1295
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:40,603
...in the zoo when the
monkey snatched your ice cream

1296
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,102
I had scolded the monkey.

1297
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:43,867
Talk about good things

1298
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:46,704
Happy couples are those who have
done good deeds in their past lives.

1299
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:47,810
- Enough, enough.
- Look at them.

1300
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,140
Learn something from them

1301
01:09:49,235 --> 01:09:50,976
Here, garbage down your medicines

1302
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,344
What do you mean by garbage down?

1303
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,344
I mean, please have your medicines.

1304
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:55,541
Oh so sweet.

1305
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:57,880
Such sweetness,
I hope you are not offering me poison.

1306
01:09:57,977 --> 01:09:59,513
Poison won't kill you.

1307
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:01,850
- Ohna
- Lovely. You are amazing

1308
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:03,722
What are you saying
in front ofthe kids?

1309
01:10:03,816 --> 01:10:05,056
Have some shame

1310
01:10:05,384 --> 01:10:06,419
You have one leg in the grave

1311
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:07,792
The legs are in the grave,
but my head it still out.

1312
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,660
You think you are very smart?

1313
01:10:08,854 --> 01:10:09,594
Drama

1314
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:16,769
Papa.

1315
01:10:16,862 --> 01:10:18,808
I want to go to school.

1316
01:10:20,332 --> 01:10:22,278
We came to India but
you don't go to school.

1317
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:23,775
Now you say that you
want to go to school.

1318
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:25,978
Now do you want me to go
to Canada to drop you offto school?

1319
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,583
Go to sleep.

1320
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:31,218
I want to see the
school of this village.

1321
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:33,988
What?

1322
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:38,194
Let me teach a few of
them a lesson until they come

1323
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:39,456
No, sir.

1324
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,858
Listen to me..

1325
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:42,955
Let me hit one of
them until they come.

1326
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:44,158
Both of us will feel better.

1327
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,270
Use your brains sir.
We have to do a drama

1328
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:47,837
According to Canadian schooling.

1329
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,405
...beaming them up makes
them lose their confidence.

1330
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,803
They are the future of our country.

1331
01:10:50,896 --> 01:10:54,673
If you teach them properly, our
country won't move towards darkness.

1332
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,775
- They are the future of our country?
- Yes. Then what!

1333
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,479
Think about yourself as well.

1334
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:01,517
We have got the grant.
You can get atransfer.

1335
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,581
Country's future, no.
They are our future.

1336
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:04,313
Right.

1337
01:11:04,777 --> 01:11:05,721
Stand up, Futures.

1338
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:07,386
Today the present saved you.

1339
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,588
Go on, boys.

1340
01:11:10,115 --> 01:11:11,594
But how will I teach
them without beating them up?

1341
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:15,130
No, you cannot beat them up
Make them your friends.

1342
01:11:15,254 --> 01:11:16,494
- Whatsapp madam.
- Yes?

1343
01:11:16,622 --> 01:11:17,396
Listen to him

1344
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:20,298
He says make these
kids your friends Friends.

1345
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,832
Yes, of course. They are our friends.

1346
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,304
This means madam is also our friend?

1347
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:27,340
- Your friend...!
- Oh it hurts!

1348
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:28,467
It's only for a matter of minutes

1349
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,478
Then it's back to your
stick and their hands.

1350
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,446
- Right.
- Okay.

1351
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,414
Yes

1352
01:11:34,073 --> 01:11:35,313
Uncle, he has arrived. Let's start.

1353
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:36,912
Today's news

01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,788

Wow, they keep the place so clean.

1359
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:55,939
They give us a bad
name for no reason at all.

1360
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:58,573
Everyone reads newspapers and books

1361
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:00,109
Good riddance.

I like Canada school.
Very intelligent.

1377
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:38,238
Yes

1378
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,044
How many kids know about computers?

1379
01:12:41,173 --> 01:12:42,311
What do you know about it?

1380
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,015
- I know.
- Ghudda, stand up. Tell us

1381

In a computer apan from
Facebook there is Youtube as well.

1382
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:55,463
In Youtube we can listen to songs.

1383
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:59,162
If we find a singer's
song to be offensive..

1384
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:02,131
"Then we came curse them as well.

Before our friendship take
a painful turn, sit down.

1389
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,472
Okay.

1390
01:13:13,772 --> 01:13:17,049
So, this is the computer class.

1391
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:22,051
Do you wish to ask anything?

1392
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,854
I think that's enough.
Am I right, son?

1393
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:25,792
Let's go. Very good Well done, sir.

1394
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:27,263
Come on, say bye to him

1395
01:13:27,352 --> 01:13:29,798
I will come back again tomorrow.
This school is very nice

1396
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,136
- Let it be. Tomorrow..
- He is coming back tomorrow?

1397
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:36,364
- Bye.
- Fine. Try not to come tomorrow.

1398
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:37,833
Carry on, Whamsap ma'am.

1399
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:40,239
So.. Youtube.

1400
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:42,104
Stand up, Jinda Jat.

1401
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:43,646
I will change your profile.

1402
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:45,080
What is this nonsense!

1403
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,384
Earlier we used find faults in
the headman while sitting over here.

1404
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,747
Look at the politics now.

1405
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,355
Now that same headman
is finding faults in us.

1406
01:13:52,611 --> 01:13:54,613
He says you should changed,
yourself for the good.

1407
01:13:54,813 --> 01:13:56,087
Only then will your
village get better.

1408
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:59,262
Now did we change the whole village?

1409
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:01,557
The headman changed it, didn't he?

1410
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,627
It is headman's fault.

1411
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:06,268
I am yearning to
get my hands on a drink

1412
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:10,170
What's that, Papa?

1413
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:12,138
Hurry up! Hurry up! Get up! Get up!

1414
01:14:12,231 --> 01:14:13,608
- What is it?
- The square.

1415
01:14:13,799 --> 01:14:15,972
- Quickly start the drama
- So as I was saying"

1416
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:20,006
Why is our country
ahead of other countries?

1417
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,578
Is everything set?

1418
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,314
The reason is that
we love our country.

1419
01:14:25,944 --> 01:14:28,390
We stay together like afamily.

1420
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:33,393
America, Uganda, Turkmenia
all are feel jealousy.

1421
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:37,194
It is not what the government
will do something for us

1422
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:38,492
No. No.

1423
01:14:38,624 --> 01:14:39,967
We too have some duty.

1424
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:42,535
We have to do something for ourselves.

1425
01:14:42,661 --> 01:14:46,165
Ifwe are hungry then we
are the ones who will have to eat.

1426
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,642
If someone else eats
we don't feel sated.

1427
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,475
\Mll we feel sated? Am I right, Happy?

1428
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:54,840
So, while talking about food.
We will have a look at the moon

1429
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,383
Am I right. Moon is round,
just like a circular flatbread.

1430
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,616
Hey scientist uncle, how you doing?

1431
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,454
I want to see the Milky Way.

1432
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,053
Look, we don't talk
in English while working.

1433
01:15:09,621 --> 01:15:10,565
No, son.

1434
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:12,065
Actually only those
who are above 18 years old..

1435
01:15:12,157 --> 01:15:13,727
...can see through
that telescope. Sorry.

1436
01:15:14,293 --> 01:15:15,863
- Prasabh..
- Yes?

1437
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,665
- You cannot grow grams on moon.
- Why?

1438
01:15:19,131 --> 01:15:20,633
I heard that there is no..

1439
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:23,839
I have seen. There is no water there

1440
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,307
If there is no water,
then we can grow cotton, right?

1441
01:15:27,406 --> 01:15:30,046
No, we cannot even grow cotton

1442
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,678
Because the Americans have already
reached there. Come, have a look.

1443
01:15:33,212 --> 01:15:36,455
Son, I think they will
soon shift to the moon.

1444
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:38,355
We shouldn't disturb them
Let's go, shall we?

1445
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,326
- Let's hurry up.
- Hold on Stop this drama

1446
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:46,064
This one who is looking at the moon
has never even looked at his uncle.

1447
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:47,829
Hello, uncle.

1448
01:15:48,093 --> 01:15:50,937
Your hello won't stop me from telling
the truth, Parghat. Let me tell you.

1449
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:53,009
This isn't the real image of Punjab.

1450
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,111
This is your grandpa's drama

1451
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,611
Wham do I tell you, son?

1452
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:58,739
Farmers are in a bad state.

1453
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,350
Groundwater levels are
getting lower by the day.

1454
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,511
Medicines have become expensive.

1455
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:06,383
If a man goes out
with a rope in his hand..

1456
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,957
His wife makes a boy follow him.

1457
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,388
To know where is he actually going

1458
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:11,383
You didn't recognize him, son?

1459
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,053
He is my uncle who does drama

1460
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,495
He does street plays
to make people aware.

1461
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:17,931
...so that no problem
arises in the system

1462
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:19,229
You heard his speech?

1463
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,361
I thought that it was true

1464
01:16:21,627 --> 01:16:23,436
Look, he thought it was true

1465
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:26,938
Your acting is a hit.
Amazing Let's go, son.

1466
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,838
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Son, your grandpa is fooling you.

1467
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:31,106
All this is a drama

1468
01:16:31,203 --> 01:16:32,910
He has gathered all idlers at awage

1469
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:35,415
Well done, oh great artist. Well done

1470
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:38,816
Did you aunt just danced
that you are applauding? Stop it.

1471
01:16:38,944 --> 01:16:40,617
Show me a nice dress, son.

1472
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:42,521
Here auntie
This is a very good dress.

1473
01:16:42,781 --> 01:16:43,816
It is in fashion.

1474
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,360
Let it be. This looks like a blanket.

1475
01:16:46,485 --> 01:16:47,862
Show me something nice.

1476
01:16:48,053 --> 01:16:51,830
Listen show me something
that makes the villagers say..

1477
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:53,368
"Than there is no one
like the Brar's daughter-in-law.

1478
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,493
Okay wait, I'll find one for you.

1479
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:57,540
Watch out brother, don't
increase the rate after this

1480
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:59,834
Don't try to fool us
just because we are women.

1481
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,103
Mothen.
Mother, all this is not needed.

1482
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:04,471
I will fulfill all my desires.

1483
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,876
Whenever a boy used to
get married in our village.

1484
01:17:08,073 --> 01:17:10,576
...l used to feel like throwing
myself in front of the car.

1485
01:17:10,842 --> 01:17:14,813
Now, I will dance
in front of your car.

1486
01:17:14,946 --> 01:17:17,256
"She flew away."

1487
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:18,554
"She flew away."

1488
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:19,694
Mother!

1489
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:23,497
Hold on.

1490
01:17:25,924 --> 01:17:27,562
Sorry, mother.

1491
01:17:28,093 --> 01:17:28,833
It's okay.

1492
01:17:31,129 --> 01:17:31,732
Hi.

1493
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:33,365
Hey Jessica, how are you?

1494
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:34,474
I am good.

1495
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:36,077
How is Manveer?

1496
01:17:36,301 --> 01:17:38,144
Thankfully Manveer is happy.

1497
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,112
Okay, that's good.

1498
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,747
Is everyone fine in Punjab?

1499
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:43,244
Oh, Punjab is beautiful.

1500
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:45,014
These people are also very nice

1501
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:48,417
Listen, your mom is here.
We all have got togethen.

1502
01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:51,487
I am making plans for my future Yeah.

1503
01:17:53,352 --> 01:17:54,422
Are you liking it in Punjab?

1504
01:17:54,519 --> 01:17:56,499
Now don't say that and
make her like it. Give it to me

1505
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,200
Hello Jessica

1506
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:00,461
Hello? Hi!

1507
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:02,839
Keep Manveer away from
the dust and the grim.

1508
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:04,935
And stay away from
all the black magic

1509
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,667
They start asking
money from foreigners.

1510
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,435
Keep your fists closed.

1511
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:12,611
Anyway, I have blocked
your credit card.

1512
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:15,749
Come soon.
We have a big surprise for you.

1513
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:16,815
One more thing

1514
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:19,285
Get me a Punjabi
sandal on your way back.

1515
01:18:19,878 --> 01:18:22,324
- Sister, do you want something?
- No, thank you.

1516
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:23,858
Okay, dear.

1517
01:18:23,982 --> 01:18:24,926
Okay.

1518
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:26,562
Take care.

1519
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:33,768
- Come on..
- No. No.

1520
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,734
- No..
- No, now don't run away.

1521
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:37,772
- Drink it.
- No, no.

1522
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:39,599
You have tired me.

1523
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:40,570
Here, drink it.

1524
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,679
- He won't drink it that easily, mother.
- Okay.

1525
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,077
This generation
eats chocolates and ice creams.

1526
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,114
I will have to force him to drink it.

1527
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:47,216
Come on, finish it.

1528
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:49,079
- Give binh to another one like him
- Finish it.

1529
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,912
I will go crazy playing with them

1530
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,354
She keeps saying, mother.

1531
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,918
She also has a child's
photo in our room

1532
01:18:57,115 --> 01:18:57,991
But I refuse.

1533
01:18:58,116 --> 01:18:58,958
'Nhv, Son?

1534
01:18:59,418 --> 01:19:01,329
It's not easy to bring up two kids

1535
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,090
It's more than enough
if we bring one up together'.

1536
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:04,200
Ofcourse

1537
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,960
You can leave him with us.

1538
01:19:06,191 --> 01:19:10,662
Son, you should ask
God to give you a brother:

1539
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:12,567
God answers kids' prayers quickly.

1540
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:15,177
No, grandma I want a sister.

1541
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,480
I want an aunt for my children.

1542
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:19,749
- Hey, come here.
- Oh God.

1543
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,144
Hear him talk.

1544
01:19:22,407 --> 01:19:24,978
He says he wants an aunt for his kids.

1545
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:28,250
Don't listen to your father.

1546
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,788
Take after your mother.

1547
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:34,290
- No, no one can be like his mother.
- Really?

1548
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:36,332
Such people are not born every day.

1549
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:39,493
She is better than
ten angels put together'.

1550
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:41,236
If she wasn't born then I would.

1551
01:19:41,626 --> 01:19:44,004
How would I become
a permanent resident?

1552
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:45,541
Let it be, mother.

1553
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,836
How do I praise her in front of her?

1554
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,241
When we will sit alone,
I will tell you how good she is.

1555
01:19:50,435 --> 01:19:52,108
- Really?
- It is true, mother.

1556
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:54,106
I too will tell you
how good he really is.

1557
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,081
Okay, dear.

1558
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:58,581
So sweet! They love each other a lot.

1559
01:19:58,677 --> 01:19:59,553
A lot.

1560
01:19:59,744 --> 01:20:03,385
Keeping love aside,
you shouldn't pamper him

1561
01:20:03,648 --> 01:20:05,753
Such people end up troubling you.

1562
01:20:05,984 --> 01:20:07,759
Take his father for example

1563
01:20:08,186 --> 01:20:09,961
I was newly married.

1564
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:13,232
I loved him a lot.
I did everything for him.

1565
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:15,695
He used to come home drunk at night.

1566
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,200
And he used to ask me to
serve him fresh hot flambreads

1567
01:20:18,497 --> 01:20:20,272
I used to serve him
fresh hot flatbreads.

1568
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:24,545
Once, late in the night
he came home sloshed.

1569
01:20:24,769 --> 01:20:26,271
He kept roaring.

1570
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,247
He asked me to serve him
fresh hot flatbreads.

1571
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:31,445
- Then?
- I got angry.

1572
01:20:31,877 --> 01:20:33,447
I don't know what happened to me

1573
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:35,286
I think I was possessed.

1574
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:40,653
I picked up a small bat, covered
my face and started beaming him up

1575
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:42,490
I hit him black and blue.

1576
01:20:44,456 --> 01:20:45,230
Really?

1577
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:48,167
From that day onwards.

1578
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,039
...he never ever mentioned them.

1579
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:52,500
Now when I serve hot flatbreads.

1580
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:54,235
...he cools them down
and then eats them.

1581
01:20:57,135 --> 01:20:59,308
- Stop it now.
- Great.

1582
01:20:59,404 --> 01:21:01,577
The Brar family seems
very happy today.

1583
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:02,811
What's happening?

1584
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:06,954
Laughter is echoing
in the Brar household today.

1585
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:08,820
The whole family is
sitting together, father.

1586
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:10,926
Tell me what's the reason, dear.

1587
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:13,158
<i>'N-</i>

1588
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,124
Nothing.

1589
01:21:17,756 --> 01:21:19,497
Why are you laughing? Tell me.

1590
01:21:20,091 --> 01:21:21,832
Females have so many
things to talk about.

1591
01:21:21,927 --> 01:21:23,531
Now we won't be telling
you everything, will we?

1592
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:24,333
Let it be father.

1593
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:25,567
It won't be anything
meaningful anyway.

1594
01:21:25,697 --> 01:21:27,734
They must be making fun of someone

1595
01:21:28,233 --> 01:21:30,110
- I know everything.
- Quiet.

1596
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:31,709
Oh God.

1597
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:35,314
Aren't you ashamed of
insulting me in this old age..

1598
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:37,353
...in front of my son
and my daughter-in-Iaw?

1599
01:21:38,243 --> 01:21:41,190
Look dear,
how he is threatening me with the bat.

1600
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:44,650
Grandma, you two always keep fighting.

1601
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,855
Why don't you take
a divorce from grandpa?

1602
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,488
He never gives me anything

1603
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:51,226
He sold the instruments
to buy machinery.

1604
01:21:51,356 --> 01:21:52,266
He still hasn't returned them.

1605
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:53,596
He is a miser.

1606
01:21:53,692 --> 01:21:56,070
Try me and then you will know.

1607
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,367
Go and get my medicines.

1608
01:21:57,462 --> 01:21:59,601
I won't. Live or die, I don't care.

1609
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:02,572
Oh my Zeenam Aman, go and get it.

1610
01:22:02,701 --> 01:22:03,736
Damn you.

1611
01:22:03,935 --> 01:22:05,710
You flin with me
in front of the kids

1612
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:09,043
- He thinks he is Rajesh Khanna
- Get lost.

1613
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:11,753
Look son, this is how you
can sweetly make woman do your work.

1614
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:12,921
Yes

1615
01:22:16,114 --> 01:22:17,149
Drama

1616
01:22:19,117 --> 01:22:20,152
My son will sleep with me?

1617
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:21,429
Let's go.

1618
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:32,901
Okay.

1619
01:22:33,398 --> 01:22:35,708
So that boys knows better
English than your teacher:

1620
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,040
Lift your bum, son

1621
01:22:37,402 --> 01:22:38,244
Higher.

1622
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:42,944
Sir, ifyou don't stop
punishing us like this.

1623
01:22:43,074 --> 01:22:45,953
...then I will come about
you to the headman's grandson.

1624
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,182
Threats?

1625
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:49,755
I will beat your friendship
until it is red. Let me tell you

1626
01:22:49,848 --> 01:22:53,819
Sir, don't punish them
till his grandson is here.

1627
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:58,058
I cannot eat until
I see them punished.

1628
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:00,567
So what do you mean now,
that I should stay hungry for 15 days?

1629
01:23:00,692 --> 01:23:01,534
I am going on a leave.

1630
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:04,732
Approve my 15 days' leave.
I cannot do this drama

1631
01:23:07,632 --> 01:23:09,805
Friend, get back to your seam.

1632
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:11,338
Go and sit down.

1633
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:16,213
- Hey teacher; how you doing?
- Well.

1634
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:19,115
- How's schooling, teacher?
- Good.

01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,315
Viflll anyone of them

1636
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,290
Mum do you say?

1637

That's great, teacher:

1644
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,242
You framed an English
sentence perfectly

1645
01:23:39,731 --> 01:23:41,733
- Really?
- Yes.

1646
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,046
This means it was just fear.

1647
01:23:46,905 --> 01:23:49,385
Take this, dear. You will get twins.

1648
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:51,745
- Twins
- Hail the great sage.

1649
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:52,853
Go.

01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,486

1654
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:07,532
Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1655
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:11,570
Here, dear. Feed it to your husband.

1656
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:12,501
Take it.

1657
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:18,878
But remember, tell him not to
think about monkeys while eating it.

1658
01:24:20,071 --> 01:24:20,811
What?

1659
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,119
Well, dear,
only he knows what he talks about.

1660
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:24,752
- Go.
- I praise the sage.

1661
01:24:24,876 --> 01:24:26,082
- Twins
- I praise the sage.

1662
01:24:26,377 --> 01:24:27,412
- Twins
- I praise the sage.

1663
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:28,580
Go.

1664
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:32,527
Good.

1665
01:24:32,617 --> 01:24:35,029
This is making all the villagers play.

1666
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,894
Manveer is also very happy here.

1667
01:24:37,222 --> 01:24:38,860
He is much better than before.

1668
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:42,660
Fathen.

1669
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:45,038
You have always fought with mother.

1670
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,442
But from the time I have come back..

1671
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:49,272
...l have been noticing
that you fight with her a lot.

1672
01:24:49,768 --> 01:24:52,806
Do you ever feel that you made
a mistake by getting married to her?

1673
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:55,675
What do you think,
I don't know the truth?

1674
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,482
Have you lost your mind?

1675
01:24:57,609 --> 01:24:59,282
All the old women are the same.

1676
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:02,316
You shouldn't get angry with them,
let me tell you.

1677
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:03,892
No man can be ever happy with them.

1678
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:06,026
Don't tell your father
about this sweet.

1679
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:08,731
He will start lecturing
for no good reason.

1680
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,855
You know he has already lost his mind.

1681
01:25:10,989 --> 01:25:12,059
I don't get it, mother.

1682
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,629
You fight with him all day long.

1683
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:16,304
How did you spend
so manyyears with him?

1684
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:17,531
This is life

1685
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:19,404
What's so special with life othenlvise?

1686
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:23,374
My aunt's daughter's
husband hits her every day.

1687
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,742
- Oh my God!
- She still lived a good life.

1688
01:25:26,571 --> 01:25:29,552
This means what those sweet
talks about love are also fake?

1689
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,820
What love? Have you lost your mind?

1690
01:25:31,976 --> 01:25:32,920
Love? That too with that old hag?

1691
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:34,784
You should love your friends.

1692
01:25:35,013 --> 01:25:36,515
- You love your children.
- True.

1693
01:25:36,781 --> 01:25:39,523
But still, even if they
have a snake instead of a tongue.

1694
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:40,721
They are better off at home

1695
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:42,559
All men are worthy of being killed.

1696
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:44,997
- Yes. So true
- Absolutely.

1697
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:46,432
Help me up, dear.

1698
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:48,671
My knees

1699
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,646
I think he is a quack

1700
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:03,251
Wow.

1701
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,581
You were the smart one, weren't you?

1702
01:26:06,644 --> 01:26:10,751
I am very sman,
but everyone makes mistakes, Parbo.

1703
01:26:11,015 --> 01:26:12,585
Yes, like Zora..

1704
01:26:12,684 --> 01:26:13,628
Who is Zora, son?

1705
01:26:13,818 --> 01:26:17,732
Mother, Zora is her
eldest uncle's son

1706
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:21,194
- ls he your real uncle's...?
- No. He isn't.

1707
01:26:21,526 --> 01:26:24,166
Why do you talk about
things you know nothing about?

1708
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,742
- Let it be, you liar.
- He isjust.

1709
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,744
I want to discuss
something with you two.

1710
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:29,743
_ Yes?
_ Yes?

1711
01:26:29,834 --> 01:26:31,472
I am having doubts on you two.

1712
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:34,139
Did you two have a
disagreement or something?

1713
01:26:39,577 --> 01:26:40,851
We are always smiling and laughing.

1714
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:42,786
- Did you?
- No.

1715
01:26:43,815 --> 01:26:46,762
- Oh mother...!
- I have never seen you two fighting.

1716
01:26:47,852 --> 01:26:48,922
Come again?

1717
01:26:49,187 --> 01:26:51,428
You want me to buy a dress worth Rs.
20000 for the reception?

1718
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:54,067
You want two dresses wonh Rs. 40,000!

1719
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:56,229
I've been going bankrupt
from the time I have married you.

1720
01:26:56,561 --> 01:26:58,370
Talk to me and stop punching me...!
Stop punching me!

1721
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,942
Mother, you better come
here and save your son!

1722
01:27:00,064 --> 01:27:02,738
What are you saying? Please don't
ruin my image in front of everyone

1723
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:03,744
I don't like this drama.

1724
01:27:03,835 --> 01:27:04,905
Mother, save your son!

1725
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:06,539
- Please! Shut up! Please!
- They are fighting!

1726
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:07,446
Mother, save your son!

1727
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:09,643
Now I am assured
that everything is fine

1728
01:27:09,774 --> 01:27:10,752
- They will make a good couple.
- Mother, save your son!

1729
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:11,820
Mother!

1730
01:27:12,377 --> 01:27:14,050
Now I will tell you who is good. No!

1731
01:27:14,178 --> 01:27:16,419
- She might hit him
- They will handle it on their own

1732
01:27:16,547 --> 01:27:19,494
- Mother, save your son!
- Oh God!

1733
01:27:41,973 --> 01:27:42,974
Smile

01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,590
"I had got matches from
big shots near and fan"

1735
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,316
Your earrings are beautiful.

1736
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:53,920
"The middleman had lured
me with promises of cars."

1737
01:27:54,052 --> 01:27:55,463
You perhaps never noticed before.

1738
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:56,497
I have worn them earlier as well.

1739
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:59,568
"L had got matches from
big shots near and fan"

1740
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,503
"The middleman had lured
me with promises of cars."

1741
01:28:03,795 --> 01:28:09,507
"Sisters-in-law too tried
to cajole me but I didn't give in"

1742
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,640
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1743
01:28:15,406 --> 01:28:21,015
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1744
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,785
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1745
01:28:27,418 --> 01:28:32,993
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1746
01:28:44,602 --> 01:28:50,553
"There is no more beautiful
in this world other than you"

1747
01:28:50,808 --> 01:28:56,224
"Boys look for excuses
to befriend you."

1748
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:59,657
"There is no more beautiful
in this world other than you"

1749
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:03,961
"Boys look for excuses
to befriend you."

1750
01:29:04,055 --> 01:29:06,092
"I am known as the
example of loyalty."

1751
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:09,194
"I only chant your name."

1752
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:14,840
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1753
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:21,215
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1754
01:29:21,305 --> 01:29:25,913
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1755
01:29:27,378 --> 01:29:33,158
"Take me into your fair arms,
I belong to you."

1756
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:05,326
Uncle Rajvinder Singh.. Rs 2000.

1757
01:30:10,788 --> 01:30:14,736
UncleAmarjit Singh.. Rs. 500.

Come here, please.

1760
01:30:19,063 --> 01:30:21,009
What is it? You called out to me?

1761
01:30:21,099 --> 01:30:22,169
Yes, I called you.

1762
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,880
You used to say that your brothers.

1763
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:27,540
...build you a bungalow,
bought land for you etc, etc.

1764
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:30,446
Your darling eldest
brother gave just Rs 500.

1765
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,145
You shouldn't be so greedy.

1766
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:34,751
What about the Rs.
5100 which was given separately?

1767
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:35,324
Show it to me?

1768
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:37,586
You show me what
did your brother give?

1769
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:38,749
Forget my brother:

1770
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,693
- Stop talking about my brother:
- Why are you two fighting, uncle?

1771
01:30:40,818 --> 01:30:42,195
How about spending some time with us?

1772
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,993
- Come outside.
- Coming.

1773
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,725
Find me a permanent resident like you

1774
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,697
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

1775
01:30:48,893 --> 01:30:51,134
She is an angel.

1776
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:53,573
Don't cast an evil
eye on my daughter-in-law.

1777
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:57,308
Come with me, dear.
I wanted to talk to you.

1778
01:30:57,935 --> 01:30:59,141
She is so beautiful.

1779
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:01,272
This is our treasure

1780
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,849
And this trunk"

1781
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,251
This belongs to my mother-in-Iaw.

1782
01:31:08,446 --> 01:31:09,754
And this box belongs to me.

1783
01:31:10,781 --> 01:31:12,419
From now onwards,
these two belong to you.

1784
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:15,297
- No, mother.
- Don't say no, dear.

1785
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,834
Men have land and women
have such boxes and trunks.

1786
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:21,831
This is how we transfer our heritage.

1787
01:31:22,693 --> 01:31:25,333
Look, from today this
house belongs to you

1788
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:30,078
And afterwe are gone,
you can come here if you want.

1789
01:31:30,168 --> 01:31:32,011
You can sell it or distribute it.
Do whatever you want.

1790
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:33,112
Okay, dear?

1791
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,080
Here you go, my child.

1792
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:53,565
Wham happened?

1793
01:31:59,797 --> 01:32:00,673
Keys?

1794
01:32:04,368 --> 01:32:05,210
Did.

1795
01:32:07,004 --> 01:32:08,039
Mother!

1796

Please Pargham.

1797
01:32:13,878 --> 01:32:15,118
I cannot do this anymore.

1798
01:32:16,814 --> 01:32:19,090
I cannot play with
their emotions anymore.

1799
01:32:21,052 --> 01:32:23,532
I cannot deceive them anymore. l..

1800
01:32:24,222 --> 01:32:25,997
Please tell them the truth

1801
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:34,573

I will tell mothen.

1803
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:46,717
Shall I talk to her
tomorrow or in afew days?

1804
01:32:52,383 --> 01:32:54,124
Keep these keys safe.

1805
01:32:55,019 --> 01:32:57,021
There isjewelry in them.

1806
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:18,680
Manveer!

1807
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:20,951
- Manveer!
- No.

1808
01:33:21,812 --> 01:33:23,314
- Give it here.
- No.

1809
01:33:23,414 --> 01:33:25,690
- Oh mom, my game!
- Manveer!

1810
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,191
What is wrong, son? You look wistful.

1811
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,290
You seem sad over something.

1812
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:33,060
It's nothing, mother.

1813
01:33:33,924 --> 01:33:35,426
Something is wrong for sure.

1814
01:33:36,661 --> 01:33:40,404
No. It's nothing important. Actually"

1815
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:44,505
You know my friend Sunny.
Hejust called me.

1816
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:46,009
He is upset.

1817
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:49,283
He has been fighting
a lot with his wife.

1818
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:51,616
She says that she wants a divorce.

1819
01:33:52,009 --> 01:33:53,147
He too is very stubborn.

1820
01:33:53,911 --> 01:33:55,015
He said whenever you want.

1821
01:33:55,346 --> 01:33:56,654
You can take a divorce
right away if you want.

1822
01:33:56,781 --> 01:33:58,556
What caused this son?

1823
01:33:58,949 --> 01:34:02,829
It's nothing big.
She says you don't talk to me.

1824
01:34:03,187 --> 01:34:05,394
He says there is
nothing to talk about.

1825
01:34:05,623 --> 01:34:06,601
Just like than.

1826
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,770
Why don't they just talk it out?

1827
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,371
What will they gain from a divorce?

1828
01:34:11,762 --> 01:34:13,002
No, they will benefit.

1829
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:14,568
Yes!

1830
01:34:14,799 --> 01:34:17,643
The girl will benefit a little more

1831
01:34:18,436 --> 01:34:20,643
- The girl will get half the property
- Okay.

1832
01:34:20,838 --> 01:34:22,010
Money and wealth will also
be distributed equally.

1833
01:34:22,106 --> 01:34:22,584
Okay.

1834
01:34:22,673 --> 01:34:25,517
And he will have to pay
monthly alimony to her as well.

1835
01:34:25,676 --> 01:34:26,882
- Really?
- Like a salary.

1836
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:30,151
What kind of a boy
is your friend Sunny?

1837
01:34:31,148 --> 01:34:33,560
Sunny, is like.

1838
01:34:35,953 --> 01:34:36,988
You can say he is like father.

1839
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,325
That girl is doomed.

1840
01:34:40,157 --> 01:34:41,693
Then she should leave him.

1841
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:42,566
Oh really?

1842
01:34:42,727 --> 01:34:45,640
First of all,
she will get monthly alimony.

1843
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:47,666
She will also get property

1844
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:52,444
If you ask me, I will suggest
that she should divorce him.

1845
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:54,175
You are right, mother.

1846
01:34:54,839 --> 01:34:56,147
It is better to take a divorce

1847
01:34:56,874 --> 01:34:58,012
Instead offighting all the time.

1848
01:34:58,476 --> 01:35:02,891
If Jessica and I fight in near future,
I will divorce her.

1849
01:35:03,013 --> 01:35:04,617
Don't make me hit you.

1850
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:06,885
He will take a divorce!

1851
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:09,188
I'll hit you ten times
and count it as one.

1852
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,026
'NW?

1853
01:35:10,688 --> 01:35:11,962
She is a gem of a girl.

1854
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:14,299
Don't you dare talk
about such a thing again!

1855
01:35:15,192 --> 01:35:18,833
- Now what are you staring at me?
- Nothing. l..

1856
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,148
Mother, are you making corn
bread or wheat bread with the greens?

1857
01:35:32,576 --> 01:35:34,249
Corn bread, son

1858
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:44,962
These people don't understand
but being separated or being together:

1859
01:35:47,925 --> 01:35:48,869
lwill try again

1860
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,102
It's difficult but.

1861
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:53,600
I know.

1862
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:55,733
Please keep trying.

1863
01:35:56,367 --> 01:35:57,141
Yes

1864
01:36:00,538 --> 01:36:05,214
But you too should reduce
your love towards them.

1865
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,819
Make them hate you a little.

1866
01:36:08,712 --> 01:36:10,521
You should refuse to do any work.

1867
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:11,985
Back answer them.

1868
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:13,521
One more thing"

1869
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:15,857
Come and help me, dear.

1870
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,200
Say no.

1871
01:36:18,489 --> 01:36:19,968
Tell her no. Be firm.

1872
01:36:20,324 --> 01:36:21,598
Tell her that I am not free

1873
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:23,533
- Say no.
- Come here.

1874
01:36:23,828 --> 01:36:25,603
Come here, dear.

1875
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:29,670
I told you, don't go.

1876
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:32,138
Oh, sorry.

1877
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:33,414
Thank you.

1878
01:36:35,306 --> 01:36:37,809
By the way, you are looking beautiful.

1879
01:36:38,409 --> 01:36:41,686
I know your brothers,
your parents and your family

1880
01:36:41,812 --> 01:36:42,916
Wham are you blabbering?

1881
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:47,325
Now if you argue with me,
I will divorce you.

1882
01:36:47,952 --> 01:36:53,129
I will take half your house, half of
your land, plus monthly maintenance.

1883
01:36:53,991 --> 01:36:57,131
I say hurry up.
I have 20 acres of land.

1884
01:36:57,394 --> 01:37:00,568
Even after give you 10 acres
I will be left with 10 acres.

1885
01:37:00,664 --> 01:37:01,734
Anyone will be ready
to marry their daughten.

1886
01:37:01,832 --> 01:37:02,810
...to someone who
owns 10 acres of land.

1887
01:37:02,933 --> 01:37:03,809
Do you understand?

1888
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:04,977
Wham are you telling me?

1889
01:37:05,102 --> 01:37:06,513
Won't anyone accept
me if I have 10 acres?

1890
01:37:06,637 --> 01:37:08,639
Only God will accept you
Stop blabbering.

1891
01:37:08,873 --> 01:37:10,978
If the lentils don't turn
out to be tasty then I will tell you

1892
01:37:21,285 --> 01:37:22,263
Nice book

1893
01:37:22,853 --> 01:37:24,924
Isn't this the one in
which the hero dies in the end?

1894
01:37:26,223 --> 01:37:27,201
Or was it the other one?

1895
01:37:27,892 --> 01:37:33,342
Papa, if your parents take a divorce,
whom will you stay with?

1896
01:37:35,032 --> 01:37:37,069
Their divorce?
They won't get divorced.

1897
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,612
They are conservative.

1898
01:37:41,872 --> 01:37:45,285
You tell me, when we get divorced,
whom will you stay with?

1899
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:50,149
I haven't decided as yet.

1900
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,887
Keep the divorce papers ready,
let me tell you.

1901
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:56,691
I will be right back.

1902
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:58,494
- Come with me
- Yes!

1903
01:38:01,926 --> 01:38:03,098
Of course, with me.

1904
01:38:22,212 --> 01:38:22,849
Hi.

1905
01:38:23,914 --> 01:38:25,393
Manveer is calling you.

1906
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:27,529
He isn't ready to sleep without you.

1907
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,530
Okay.

1908
01:38:31,555 --> 01:38:34,229
The moon of our country
looks beautiful, doesn't it?

1909
01:38:40,431 --> 01:38:41,910
It's the same moon there as well.

1910
01:38:44,201 --> 01:38:46,181
It is possible that
you never looked at it.

1911
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:48,248
I don't know.

1912
01:38:50,407 --> 01:38:52,512
I know this moon very well.

1913
01:38:53,243 --> 01:38:54,950
I have had many conversations with it.

1914
01:38:56,046 --> 01:38:57,525
It knows me well.

1915
01:38:57,948 --> 01:38:59,484
I know it well.

1916
01:39:01,385 --> 01:39:03,661
If you would've had
conversations with that moon.

1917
01:39:04,989 --> 01:39:06,696
"Then maybe you would've
know it well too.

1918
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:09,569
Maybe.

1919
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:13,337
But there is a difference.

1920
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:16,968
Of language and level..

1921
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:22,947
Yes

1922
01:39:23,974 --> 01:39:25,044
Manveer is calling

1923
01:39:25,342 --> 01:39:28,448
Okay, tell me something"

1924
01:39:28,912 --> 01:39:33,622
The moon's light. it is its own
or does it reflects the sun's light?

1925
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:37,993
Wham does that mean?

1926
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:39,961
Ijust asked

1927
01:39:42,326 --> 01:39:44,306
There can be some things without
any hidden meaning behind them, right?

1928
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,139
Sorry.

1929
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,146
Good night.

1930
01:40:09,787 --> 01:40:15,760
"L shall take the light from
the sun and make an ornament."

1931
01:40:15,893 --> 01:40:21,775
"Instead ofa diamond, I'll
embed the moon in it and beautify it."

1932
01:40:22,032 --> 01:40:30,975

to place on your forehead."

1933
01:40:31,075 --> 01:40:34,056

1935
01:40:37,147 --> 01:40:41,994
"I pluck the stars from the sky.."

1936
01:40:42,086 --> 01:40:46,091

01:40:46,223 --> 01:40:51,138
"I pluck the stars from the sky.."

1938
01:40:51,261 --> 01:40:55,232
"To decorate your veil."

1939
01:41:07,544 --> 01:41:13,460
<i>"I'll</i> steal the darkness from the
night, to apply kohl in your eyes."

1940
01:41:13,684 --> 01:41:19,464

to apply on your forehead."

1941
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:26,235

the sunset and apply on your hands."

1942
01:41:27,297 --> 01:41:36,183
"I keep gathering precious
gems to grow them in your garden"

1943
01:41:36,373 --> 01:41:45,225
"I keep gathering precious
gems to grow them in your garden"

1944
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,520
"The stars from the sky.."

1945
01:41:48,619 --> 01:41:51,532
"The stars from the sky.."

1946
01:41:51,622 --> 01:41:56,469
"I pluck the stars from the sky.."

1947
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,303
"To decorate your veil."

1948
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:15,754
"I flow with the water."

1949
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:18,826
"I keep burning with the lamps."

1950
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:24,889
"I keep looking like a fool
after falling in love with you."

1951
01:42:25,088 --> 01:42:30,936
"I keep searching
for you in my dreams."

1952
01:42:32,296 --> 01:42:37,075
"I always seeking your presence."

1953
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:41,206
"To wake up my sleepy destiny."

1954
01:42:41,338 --> 01:42:46,549
"I always seeking your presence."

1955
01:42:46,677 --> 01:42:50,648

"To decorate your veil."

1960
01:43:05,996 --> 01:43:09,000
"To decorate your veil."

1961
01:43:15,138 --> 01:43:16,276
lnspecton.

1962
01:43:21,211 --> 01:43:22,053
Very good.

1963
01:43:22,179 --> 01:43:23,920
We will gather every single penny.

1964
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:25,991
I had taken Rs. 2500 from the headman

1965
01:43:26,116 --> 01:43:27,060
I am not lying.

1966
01:43:27,184 --> 01:43:28,561
Iam left with only Rs
500. Why return it?

1967
01:43:28,652 --> 01:43:29,858
- Let it be.
- Give it to me

1968
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:31,523
You won't change so quickly.

1969
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,124
Stop loving this.

1970
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:35,597
Learn to love your conscience

1971
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,670
Papa, looking the uncle
who does drama

1972
01:43:38,795 --> 01:43:39,500
Yes, son

1973
01:43:41,698 --> 01:43:43,234
What's happening out here?

1974
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:44,639
Cops are also in the drama?

1975
01:43:44,768 --> 01:43:46,270
Wham accounts are you balancing?

1976
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:48,447
You have so much money in your hand
Are you selling drugs?

1977
01:43:48,538 --> 01:43:50,211
Take them money. Seal it.
- Wham drugs?

1978
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:51,145
Why did you have that money with you?

1979
01:43:51,241 --> 01:43:53,687
He acts smans.
The headman keeps calling me.

1980
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,050

1981
01:43:55,178 --> 01:43:56,020
Hold on

1982
01:43:56,346 --> 01:43:57,848
Don't touch my uncle.

1983
01:44:00,684 --> 01:44:01,560
Who are you?

1984
01:44:03,053 --> 01:44:05,294
- L..

1985
01:44:06,556 --> 01:44:07,557
I am the headman's son.

1986
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,695
We will settle it between ourselves.

1987
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:12,064
You know, we are trying to show the
child that our village is nice

1988
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,637
Say that it is a drama

1989
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,038
We arejust acting, son.

1990
01:44:16,366 --> 01:44:19,506
It's possible that at the end
of the scene they might take me away.

1991
01:44:19,636 --> 01:44:20,614
They might even beat me up.

1992
01:44:20,704 --> 01:44:22,206
- Acting.
- Look over here.

1993
01:44:22,572 --> 01:44:25,883
Listen, fulfill what you have promise.

1994
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:27,113
Make sure it all reaches me

1995
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:29,324
I didn't even spare your father.

1996
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:32,585
It's just acting, son

1997
01:44:32,716 --> 01:44:35,219
Look, I will poke him. Just wind.

1998
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:37,899
He doesn't say anything No.

1999
01:44:38,155 --> 01:44:39,634
I will settle the accounts at night.

2000
01:44:40,057 --> 01:44:40,797
- Let's go.
- Bye.

2001
01:44:40,924 --> 01:44:41,925
Acting. Acting.

2002
01:44:47,431 --> 01:44:50,002
It's not me, it's your
uncle who is being impossible

2003
01:44:50,133 --> 01:44:51,134
You are being impossible.

2004
01:44:51,335 --> 01:44:52,643
He is trying to make
this village betten.

2005
01:44:52,769 --> 01:44:54,271
...and you are sending
cops to arrest him.

2006
01:44:54,638 --> 01:44:56,549
Let this village get better, headman.

2007
01:44:56,673 --> 01:45:00,314
Okay, so you will teach me sense,
Mr. Pargham.

2008
01:45:00,577 --> 01:45:02,318
Why are you ruining his mood?

2009
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:03,919
He is leaving tomorrow.

2010
01:45:04,114 --> 01:45:05,616
Shut up. Stop blabbering

2011
01:45:05,749 --> 01:45:07,786
First of all,
you should talk properly with mother.

2012
01:45:08,051 --> 01:45:09,928
She got married and came
to your house with a lot desires.

2013
01:45:10,187 --> 01:45:11,598
Have you ever spoken to her with love?

2014
01:45:13,123 --> 01:45:14,295
You take your Bullet
and go to your friends.

2015
01:45:14,424 --> 01:45:15,630
You take your Jeep
and go to your friends.

2016
01:45:16,994 --> 01:45:19,668
Friends are important
but not more than your family.

2017
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:23,306
Mother has looked after your family.

2018
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:27,548
When I was a kid, did you
know where I was what I was doing?

2019
01:45:28,538 --> 01:45:30,518
Just giving birth,
don't make you a father.

2020
01:45:32,642 --> 01:45:33,848
Did you ever take us shopping..

2021
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:40,494
First of all sell your Bullet
and Jeep and buy afamily car.

2022
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,063
Something like a Maruti.

2023
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,166
Take a newspaper subscription
and read it early in the morning.

2024
01:45:47,224 --> 01:45:48,965
It's never too lame to improve.

2025
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:54,075
A person can change anytime in life

2026
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:56,701
He should just get an opportunity

2027
01:46:02,539 --> 01:46:03,677
Have you packed my clothes?

2028
01:46:04,241 --> 01:46:06,915
I would have beaten him
up if he wasn't to leave tomorrow.

2029
01:46:07,144 --> 01:46:08,851
Calm down now.

2030
01:46:23,927 --> 01:46:25,770
Son, the black-undenlvear
thieves are out these days.

2031
01:46:25,862 --> 01:46:26,932
Wham are you doing here alone?

2032
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:44,519
Is this a way to talk to your father?

2033
01:46:46,416 --> 01:46:48,089
Yes, I said a little too much

2034
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:50,894
Sit down.

2035
01:47:02,532 --> 01:47:04,671
Now you will see, father
will stay upset with me tomorrow.

2036
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:07,003
He will show that it doesn't
make a difference to him.

2037
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:12,686
But after I leave,
he will cry when he is alone

2038
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:16,388
Some people are like than.

2039
01:47:18,381 --> 01:47:19,655
He cannot say it, but.

2040
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,853
...they feel hun when
someone leaves them.

2041
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,197
People get attached.

2042
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:28,060
Yes.

2043
01:47:29,993 --> 01:47:32,303
Even Manveer is attached
with all of them

2044
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:34,431
Yes

2045
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:38,146
He too won't feel
like leaving tomorrow.

2046
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:39,812
But thank God, he is all better now.

2047
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,983
Father had made the village look good

2048
01:47:47,077 --> 01:47:48,249
My favorite song

2049
01:47:52,749 --> 01:47:54,592
You love old songs don't you?

2050
01:47:55,585 --> 01:47:56,359
A lot.

2051
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:58,031
I have heard them
a lot when I was small.

2052
01:47:58,221 --> 01:47:59,461
Manik, Sadiq..

2053
01:48:01,024 --> 01:48:02,799
I should used to spend the
whole day at the pumping station"

2054
01:48:02,993 --> 01:48:05,098
Listening to Chamkila's
songs and playing cards.

2055
01:48:05,962 --> 01:48:07,270
No worries or tensions

2056
01:48:07,364 --> 01:48:08,365
Those were some good times

2057
01:48:10,767 --> 01:48:12,337
You had sent me a song as well,
hadn't you?

2058
01:48:12,769 --> 01:48:13,679
Of Chamkila.

2059
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:16,549
- Before we got married.
- Yes.

2060
01:48:16,806 --> 01:48:18,183
Wham was that song?

2061
01:48:19,976 --> 01:48:22,684
"L wish to get married.
But my mother doesn't agree"

2062
01:48:22,779 --> 01:48:24,781
Your mother didn't agree.
But we still got married.

2063
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:27,822
I understood.

2064
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:30,854
You had sent another one

2065
01:48:30,987 --> 01:48:32,398
Yes, I had sent you one more.

2066
01:48:32,556 --> 01:48:33,933
The second one..

2067
01:48:34,224 --> 01:48:35,760
- What was that song?
- What was that song?

2068
01:48:37,661 --> 01:48:39,766
"The moon rises early in love.."

2069
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:47,408
"The moon rises early in love,
but it is.."

2070
01:48:49,005 --> 01:48:49,847
Hello?

2071
01:48:50,407 --> 01:48:52,148

01:52:15,011 --> 01:52:18,015
Who knows whether I am
alive the next time he visits

2122
01:52:18,348 --> 01:52:19,258
Nothing will happen to you.

2123
01:52:19,416 --> 01:52:21,089
The flexible branches
don't fall so easily.

2124
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:22,389
Understood? Yes.

2125

01:52:35,365 --> 01:52:37,345
You have made us so happy.

2129
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:45,850
I too am pleased to meet you, mother.

2130
01:52:52,582 --> 01:52:55,620
I will miss you and father a lot.

2131
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:03,496
Did you eat that sweet?

2132
01:53:04,127 --> 01:53:05,936
Next time come with a pair of kids

2133
01:53:06,095 --> 01:53:07,597
Do you want them to
give you a pair right away?

2134
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:09,776
Listen to me, dear.

2135

You and my son will come
and meet us every year. Understood?

2136
01:53:12,502 --> 01:53:13,310
I won't say anything to him.

01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:15,108
Mr. New-Turned-Smanypants Okay?

01:53:16,806 --> 01:53:19,480
I thought the kids are leaving.
You might feel lonely.

2139
01:53:19,609 --> 01:53:21,486
Come in now that you
have come here by mistake

2140
01:53:21,611 --> 01:53:23,318
One has to mistake sometimes

2141
01:53:23,446 --> 01:53:25,187
Take this, my child.
This is a gift, dear.

2142

01:53:31,387 --> 01:53:34,493
Your eldest brother gavejust Rs. 500.

2147
01:53:34,757 --> 01:53:38,204
And look at my brother, he gave Rs
1000 to everyone

2148
01:53:38,328 --> 01:53:40,330
You ran after the headman's
post all your life..

2149
01:53:40,763 --> 01:53:41,969
...and never tried to find
out how your brother is doing.

2150
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:43,303
And now he is your brother:

2151
01:53:43,466 --> 01:53:44,342
ls it so?

2152
01:53:47,303 --> 01:53:50,648
Fine then, next time you
can be the headman I won't contest.

2153
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:54,046
Let me see how you improve
the village by becoming the headman.

2154
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:55,985
If my NRI nephew will suppon me..

2155
01:53:56,112 --> 01:53:58,251

our village into heaven

2156

Moreover, if we keep
our villages maintained.

01:54:03,553 --> 01:54:05,294
...then grandsons will
keep visiting the village.

2159
01:54:05,455 --> 01:54:08,664
Well done, Mr. Smartypants. Come here.

God has made such a nice pair.

2215
01:59:33,482 --> 01:59:36,053
Zora, who are you waiting for?

2216
01:59:38,588 --> 01:59:40,966
Isn't he the boy she
was married to earlier?

2217
01:59:41,123 --> 01:59:43,228
Yes, mother.
I think he used to hit her.

2218
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:44,463
I think so too.

2219
01:59:49,365 --> 01:59:50,639
It ruined my clothes.

2220
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,473
The tap in the bathroom is broken

2221
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:54,613
Oh.

2222
02:00:02,044 --> 02:00:03,250
I will go and check.

2223
02:00:06,015 --> 02:00:06,993
Please.

02:00:08,885 --> 02:00:09,920
Thank God he was here

2225
02:00:10,086 --> 02:00:11,429
He is at least being
useful for something.

2226
02:00:11,787 --> 02:00:13,824
Mom, stop.

2227
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:15,765
Wait for him, please

2228
02:00:16,025 --> 02:00:17,231
Fine.

2229
02:00:23,833 --> 02:00:25,813
- I repaired it. Check it.
- Thank you.

2230
02:00:30,039 --> 02:00:31,643
So shall we begin
the ring ceremony now?

2231

- Of course
- Thank you.

2232
02:00:34,110 --> 02:00:35,680
Zora, exchange the rings.

2233
02:00:45,922 --> 02:00:47,265
Where is the ring?

2234
02:00:47,757 --> 02:00:49,100
- Ring?
- Yes.

2235
02:00:53,162 --> 02:00:54,163
Where it is?

2236
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,777
Did you keep it somewhere?

2237
02:00:59,068 --> 02:00:59,978
Don't no.

2238
02:01:10,613 --> 02:01:11,421
Sorry.

2239
02:01:16,619 --> 02:01:18,724
- Thanks

2240
02:01:27,463 --> 02:01:28,339

She isn't with me

2244
02:01:37,807 --> 02:01:38,751
She has gone for a run

2245
02:01:39,442 --> 02:01:41,786
- You still didn't tell them?
- No.

2246
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:43,216
'NW?

2247
02:01:45,181 --> 02:01:46,216
When were you planning to tell them?

2248
02:01:46,615 --> 02:01:47,252
I don't know.

2249
02:01:47,917 --> 02:01:48,725
Yes?

2250
02:01:50,486 --> 02:01:52,159
- Give me the phone, I will tell him.

2251
02:01:53,789 --> 02:01:55,097
Here, talk to her.

2252

One second.

2253
02:02:00,262 --> 02:02:01,172
One second.

2254
02:02:06,135 --> 02:02:08,513
Hello, father.

2255
02:02:09,472 --> 02:02:10,246
Hello.

2256
02:02:16,512 --> 02:02:18,389
Hello? Father?

2257
02:02:19,081 --> 02:02:21,652
Hello? Can you hear me?

2258
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:25,596
- What?
- I think the network is weak.

2259
02:02:25,988 --> 02:02:27,262
Just one second. I am sorry.

2260
02:02:27,523 --> 02:02:28,968
- Jessica!
- Yes, I am going outside

2261
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:31,935
- Network issue?
- Speak louder, father.

2262
02:02:32,695 --> 02:02:34,072
Yes I am going outside.

2263
02:02:34,263 --> 02:02:35,139
Hello?

2264
02:02:35,531 --> 02:02:36,874
Hello, father?

2265
02:02:38,401 --> 02:02:39,379
Let's go.

2266
02:02:40,536 --> 02:02:43,608
I think this girl is out of network.

2267
02:02:57,286 --> 02:02:58,526
Where did she go?

2268
02:02:59,688 --> 02:03:01,099
I think she has gone for a run.

2269
02:03:01,557 --> 02:03:02,262
- Shall I go and get her.
- Let's go.

2270
02:03:02,425 --> 02:03:03,233
Let's go, Tuti.

2271
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:06,563
Zora, get your car.

2272
02:03:10,666 --> 02:03:12,168
Papa, fast.

2273
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,111
Papa, fast.

2274
02:03:17,406 --> 02:03:18,544
Hurry up, PaPa!

2275
02:03:18,974 --> 02:03:20,112
You drive.

2276
02:03:46,702 --> 02:03:48,113
You drove really fast.

2277
02:03:48,737 --> 02:03:52,913
I had to jump a red
signal to come after you

2278
02:03:53,876 --> 02:03:54,718
Okay.

2279
02:03:57,780 --> 02:04:01,091
I just took a chance and
lied that it was father's call.

2280
02:04:01,817 --> 02:04:02,887
But you understood everything"

2281
02:04:03,319 --> 02:04:04,354
As to whyl lied.

2282
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,363
Really?

2283
02:04:07,423 --> 02:04:08,401
âMy did you lie?

2284
02:04:09,258 --> 02:04:13,729
Because I don't want you
to get engaged to anyone else.

2285
02:04:15,264 --> 02:04:16,436
I tried living without you

2286
02:04:16,565 --> 02:04:17,475
I have learned a lesson.

2287
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,143
A snake cannot survive without poison.

2288
02:04:22,204 --> 02:04:23,342
I am poison

2289
02:04:24,473 --> 02:04:25,315
No, I am poison.

2290
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:26,542
So I am a snake.

2291
02:04:28,811 --> 02:04:30,256
I am the snake and I am the poison.

2292
02:04:33,115 --> 02:04:34,185
Okay, I love you.

2293
02:04:36,285 --> 02:04:37,355
'Okay, I love you.'

2294
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:39,065
After all this?

2295
02:04:40,222 --> 02:04:41,428
Is this how you will tell me?

2296
02:04:42,124 --> 02:04:44,263
Then how else should I say it?
I mean..

2297
02:04:47,129 --> 02:04:47,800
I love you.

2298
02:04:48,164 --> 02:04:48,801
Okay?

2299
02:04:53,702 --> 02:04:54,476
Let it be

2300
02:04:54,603 --> 02:04:55,809
No, you should let it be.

2301
02:04:56,705 --> 02:04:57,308
Just.

2302
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:58,381
Manveen.

2303
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:00,686
I love you.

2304
02:05:05,848 --> 02:05:08,522
I don't want you to be
'X'ed' from my life's ABC.

2305
02:05:12,087 --> 02:05:13,464
I cannot do better than this

2306
02:05:13,722 --> 02:05:15,167
You can leave if you want to.

2307
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:19,339
But it's no use going there now.

2308
02:05:20,162 --> 02:05:21,573
Even the cooks must have left by now.

2309
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:38,353
When you two feel like,
you guys get together'.

2310
02:05:38,514 --> 02:05:41,620
When you two feel like,
you guys start fighting.

2311
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:43,752
Have you ever thought about me,
you scoundrels?

2312
02:05:44,153 --> 02:05:46,030
- Manveer.
- Hit him Hit him hard!

2313
02:05:46,422 --> 02:05:49,096

Manveen.

2315
02:05:51,093 --> 02:05:53,130
- Who taught you all this?
- Grandpa

2316
02:05:54,964 --> 02:05:56,136
Let's go, home

2317
02:05:56,465 --> 02:05:57,443
- Okay?
- Mom.

2318
02:06:09,778 --> 02:06:11,223
They look happy together'.

2319
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:12,620
Let's go.

2320
02:06:15,584 --> 02:06:16,790
She is your daughter?

2321
02:06:17,486 --> 02:06:19,693
She is the first girl in the
world who ran away with her husband.

2322
02:06:20,089 --> 02:06:21,295
I feel so sad, brother:

2323
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:24,232
By the way, do you like chicken?

Yes, Lakha?

2330
02:06:40,643 --> 02:06:42,054
You should have called sooner.

2331
02:06:42,411 --> 02:06:43,321

children's aunt.

We don't even know

02:07:34,196 --> 02:07:36,767
Mother, did uncle do
anything good for our village?
