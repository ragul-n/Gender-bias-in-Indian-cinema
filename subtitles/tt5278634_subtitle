1
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,271
Some people are like than.

2
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,740
They just enter our
life and split it into two.

3
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,611
The time before them
and the time after them

4
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,273
Life from then on, along with
all our dreams expectations.

5
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:13,371
...and memories, takes on
two different meanings.

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,279
Two colours.

7
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,537
This story is about one
such man who came into my life

8
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:26,079
This is the story of the first time,
and the last time I ever fell in Love

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,037
He was obviously big trouble.

10
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,743
He was Preshrank Roy.

11
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,477
Roshni

12
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,205
Shh

13
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,673
Oh, It's Vishu!

14
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,511
Right! It will be a special one,
this year.

15
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,303
Really?

16
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,303
Today would be a day of miracles.

17
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,509
That, which we have not expected,
shall be awaiting us.

18
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,280
Right! It would be our boss,
who would be awaiting, there

19
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,543
You know it's not a holiday, today
Isn't it?

20
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,735
Come, let's go, dear!

21
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,001
We have to go to work.

22
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,134
Come!

23
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,110
Papa, you come here!

24
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,171
Few days we shall stay in Bangalore.

25
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,071
BEE

26
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,144
Yes; In the office!

27
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,406
Yes, on the 15th?

28
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,241
Come!

29
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,071
I shall call, later!

30
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,639
Yes, did you have your food?

31
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,344
Okay, Papa!

32
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,544
If I tell papa, to come here and stay...

33
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,703
...he will say, no.

34
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,541
If I tell him, I shall come there"

35
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,203
...Who is elder, he asks.

36
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,704
Why does father not come here to stay?

37
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,070
He is someone who used to travel
for 300 days, a year.

38
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,403
After

39
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,638
It was after mother's death"

40
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,209
...that, father left that house
That's the reason

41
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,378
Well!

42
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,375
Chandra boss is calling!

43
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,676
Seems like something is wrong.

44
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,237
Sir, may we come in?

45
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,442
Thank you, sir.

46
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:54,306
I had given you'll a consideration
that you are Malayalees.

47
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,410
But,

48
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,103
Now I am unable to support you'll.

49
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,571
But sir...

50
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,376
What... I...

51
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,338
Your activities, here,

Can be finished, soon.

53
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,505
The company guest house,

54
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,705
Needs to be vacated immediately.

55
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:12,534
But...

56
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,307
Why. --

57
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,611
Take it!

58
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,201
But, sir.

59
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,671
I could havejust sent me an email.

60
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,273
Since you are girl;

61
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,971
I thought of giving it in your hands.

63
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,068

64
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,305
I don't understand.

65
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,470
Wham is it, sir?

66
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,203
You open it!

67
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,439
Overseas assignment?

68
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,445
Wow! Sir!

69
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,271
That's what I told you. Isn't it?

70
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,505
You'll cannot

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,443
work here, anymore.

72
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,205
Oh god! Didn't I say?

73
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,244
That we both might

74
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,677
Be going together, there

75
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,111

What fun it would be, if everything
goes as per the plans!

86
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,475
Just as you say,

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,146
Something we never expected,

88
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,235
What if something is awaiting us, there?

89
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,610
What if you find your man there, Baby?

90
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,007
No way!

91
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,639
The person I marry,

92
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,644
Shall be the one whom my family chooses.

93
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,705
But, seriously,

94
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,746
When you had said, miracle,

95
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,340
I never expected that, so much.

96
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:17,711
'Up-

But, before you go to London,

106

You'll have to change your attire, okay?

This is my army, and these are my generals.

Do you know, where it pushed me into?

135
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,978
You have literally made us get out of
every single competition, in this country.

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,774
It's a shame.

137
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,334
Congratulations!

138
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,740
You made me beg in front of the board.

139
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,407
You have made me beg for one last chance

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
You have got,

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,313
One single chance to escape, and succeed

142
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,080
And my dear friends, I am looking at
retirement after this, if we get it right.

143

Mr. Shan, you are in charge
of the guest relations.

There will hardly be
any quality in his work,"

147
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,242
...but it will always have a good look.

And, she is going to do this great India route.
She will make our portal online within 6 months.

156
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,142
And if you don't do that,
I fear.

157
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,306
You will be pushing out
almost 500 families out of their homes..

158
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,711
Do you have anything
to add?

159
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,180
Well, I certainly wouldn't
want that on my conscience sir.

160
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,479
But I am sure that with all your support,
we will be able to do the needful.

Hope that attitude works for you Bob,

162
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,069

Some proposal?

186
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:54,216
A marriage proposal? For me? No way!

187
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,644
Why do you say that? Are you anti-men?

188
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:03,674
Not just anti-men,
sometimes I can be anti-women too!

189
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:08,106
So, I wonder what type of
men you would not be averse to.

190
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,201
Super human beings?

191
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,546
Not Super human .Minimum qualities.

192
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,375
Someone who behaves
well with everyone.

193
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,603
Someone who respect me

194
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,076
Someone who will support
me even if I falter.

195
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,108
A decent gentleman.

196
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,113
Your requirements are
pretty old school, girl.

197
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,145
That's what.
There's no school like old school!

198
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,437
Hey! Hey!

199
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,774
Didn't take him home, right?

200
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,135
I thought than, I would find
him in your house, now.

201
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,546
That too in London?! When you take
Unnecessary burdens onto yourself,

202
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,273
...you just won't know when it will become
a thorny fence around your head!

203
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,075
What fence?

204
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,371
I am too busy for all this

205
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,307
That crown of thorns on top
of my head is more than enough.

206
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,237
But you shouldn't have
dragged in to the train!

207
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,570
What else do you
think I should've done?

208
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,378
Whatever. It's over now.

209
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,971
Yeah ok. You're going home, right?
I will drop you, come.

210
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:00,476
That was crazy.

211
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,474
Hello?

212
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,308
Miss. Roshni Menon?

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,708
Hello? I am in a lift.

214
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,471
Hello?

215
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,713
This is Raymond Colligan from the
Metropolitan Police.

216
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,277
A man was found dead
on the Tube on Friday night.

217
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:21,538
The CCTV footage shows that you were
the last person to be seen with this man.

218
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,076
We need you to come
down to the office.

219
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,776
Sir... I don't understand...

220
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,479
Don't worry.
The death was a natural one.

221
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,481
'Ne just have to complete
some formalities to close the case.

222
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,409
That's all.

223
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,443
I

224
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,444
Ma'am. Please do cooperate.

225
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,547
We have already sent a car
to pick you up from your office

226
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:49,037
Officer listen, I didn't even know
this man, He was a stranger. I...

227
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,578
That's alright.

228
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,313
The car will be with you shortly
and I will see you when you arrive.

229
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,706
Nothing happens by chance, but by choice
Definitive simple choice

230
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,507
You can meet the Inspector
on the fifth ï¬‚oor.

231
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,735
Here?

232
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,603
Yes

233
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,211
How am I supposed to come?

234
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:02,678
Sunnychaya.. you know all this

235
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:06,180
You come, man! It will only
be fun if you are also here.

236
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,079
What's the program for today?

237
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,203
Yeah, I started early today.

238
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,610
You have had enough for
Four lifetimes already, alright?

239
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,413
I won't go so easily Achaya!

240
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Wham hurry do I have here?
Achaya, you continue

241
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,401
Okay. Then?

242
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,138
Achaya... there is
a small emergency here.

243
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,178
A friendly meet!

244
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,744
I will call you.

245
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,701
Don't want it?

246
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,369
What is your problem?

247
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:56,112
Ordinary! Predictable response.

248
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,974
What?

249
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,539
Just as expected.

250
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,679
Too scared to even sit down.

251
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,407
Knees knocking with fear even
while standing. Really ordinary.

252
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,474
Sit down!

253
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,410
So... how are you?

254
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,178
What is your intention?

255
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:15,377
Just a courtesy

256
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,071
Felt like talking to
the person who saved my life.

257
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,441
Thought of just getting acquainted.

258
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,544
That is what this
whole drama was about?

259
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:24,443
I'll explain.

260
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,343
There are only two ways
to really get to know a person.

261
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:31,238
Either, you have to sit with
them and have a drink with them

262
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:34,213
Or threaten them
and fight with them

263
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,677
How did you get my
contact information?

264
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:40,107
Again, predictable question.

265
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,371
This is a Ten Pound note.

266
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,405
With this,
one can get anything done in London.

267
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,070
And I am very good at than.

268
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:52,671
Who the hell are you?!

269
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,145
Preshrank. Preshrank Roy.

270
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,676
That's my name.

271
00:25:59,033 --> 00:25:59,977
Preshrank Roy.

272
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,578
Do you practice this pompous behaviour
in front of the mirror?

273
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,610
Earlier I used to.
Don't need it anymore.

274
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,337
Have at least some
juice before you leave

275
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:13,341
That's mine! You order one for yourself.

276
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:28,544
Hey Roshni, you know what
happened today? Let me tell you...

277
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,114
I know, you had a
fantastic day at work today

278
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,372
and your make over
is looking really great.

279
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,738
I am very tired today.

280
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,180
We will talk tomorrow. Good Night!

281
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,038
Roshni, the house owner
had asked for the rent.

282
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,237
Are you still brooding
over this thing?

283
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,374
Throw it in a dustbin!

284
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,475
This seems to be a crack case.

285
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:37,677
Finish it!

286
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,174
No Misha.

287
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,411
This is not just a wallet
like you are making it out to be

288
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,070
Oh it's not awallet? Let me see

289
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:48,507
It's a bait.

290
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:50,411
This is a fishing hook.

291
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,271
A hook to catch me

292
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,045
The other end of this fishing
line is still in that man's hands

293
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:57,545
And he will definitely
pull on it soon.

294
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:59,637
Before that,
I will end this game

295
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,470
I know what to do

296
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,541
Excuse me!

297
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,112
Good morning. How can I help you?

298
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,977
I am here to meet Mr. Preshrank Roy.

299
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:20,475
I have an appointment with him.

300
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,977
Are you sure?

301
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,471
Yes, at ten thirty.

302
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,045
Ha! Well, you'll have
to sit over there, and wait.

303
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,612
He's not in the office right now

304
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,278
Well, what time is he expected back?

305
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,475
But he hasn't been here for a year!

306
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,444
What?

307
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,240
And you still let him work here?

308
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,310
He doesn't work here,
he owns this company!

309
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,747
Well, in that case
just give this to him

310
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,502
I am not authorized to
accept anything on his behalf.

311
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,371
But this belongs to him!

312
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,603
Can I have his number

313
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,579
I don't have it! Sorry!

314
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,341
Oh God!

315
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:06,472
You?

316
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,276
Good afternoon ma'am
How can I help you?

317
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,273
Is this Preshrank Roy's House?

318
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:13,643
It ls.

319
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:17,477
Another Drama

320
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:20,438
Where is he?

321
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,213
He doesn't live here ma'am

322
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,277
Another lie.

323
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,246
No Ma'am it is the truth

324
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:29,238
Do one thing,

325
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,041
Just give this to him

326
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,776
Sorry, that's his personnel belonging
I cannot take it.

327
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:36,474
I am sorry!

328
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,046
Just... Just give this to him

329
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,572
I cannot take it ma'am.

330
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,474
Fine I will just throw
it out in the dumpster

331
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,335
As you wish, ma'am.

332
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,270
Hello!

333
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,101
Preshrank Roy.

334
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,711
The wallet is in the garbage
dump next to your mansion.

335
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:15,471
Good. Now go get it from there
and come to the place I tell you.

336
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,476
Sorry. I won't.

337
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,977
Everybody is aware by now that
my missing wallet is with you

338
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,240
It's okay,
the police will find it out.

339
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,113
Then I suppose they
will hang me to death.

340
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,535
No. They won't do that.

341
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,374
They will come
to your office to question you.

342
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,343
Excuse me!

343
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,643
Let them do!

344
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,474
And, if I spend another ten pounds

345
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,338
You shall get a free trip, in the
police car, up to the police station

346
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,671
<i>Okay. OWN</i>

347
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,012
Tell me where I have to meet you?

348
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,538
I'll text you the address Okay?

349
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,612
Who are they?

350
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,377
Their names,
I don't really know.

351
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,377
Now what relevance in knowing,
who they were and what they were?

352
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,671
Its

353
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:31,745
(in English) A thin line

354
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,143
Then why are you here?

355
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,601
Just like than.

356
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,778
Excuse me.

357
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:44,745
Thanks.

358
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:47,343
Is that all?

359
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,479
Was this all, just to say a "Thank You"?

360
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:51,741
Then what were you expecting?

361
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,778
I wanted a friendship with a person who
saved my life. That's all what I expected.

362
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,305
You and me being friends?

363
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,181
Not just me, but nobody in this world would
be able to tolerate you.

364
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,705
That's true

365
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,279
Maybe that's why my wife left me.

366
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:09,241
Okay.

367
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,412
Good bye.

368
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,045
I think we have a problem

369
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,339
Miss. Roshni, you have a
fantastic team buddy!

370
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,304
It's not anything personal.

371
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,377
Let me be very clear.

372
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,011
Now, you say; Wham is the dead line,

373
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:43,678
In which you can deliver this work?

374
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,636
Since you began thejob, six months ago,

375
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,610
You haven't achieved even 50 %.

376
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,509
No sir, I will finish it by Monday.

377
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,144
Monday means, what time?

378
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:52,376
Tell me the time?

379
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,413
11 am sir. 11 AM Monday morning.

380
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,104
That seems realistic!

381
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,572
We need results madam! One thing
I have to tell to the entire team:

382
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,668
Wake up!

383
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:03,739
Do your work!

384
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,078
Thanks.

385
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,678
Thanks a lot!

386
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,535
Please come!

387
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,474
He married a poor lame girl

388
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,604
and is sitting there siphoning
all her wealth.

389
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,111
Didn't you see his arrogance?

390
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,475
Forget that!
Tell me what happened, then?

391
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,478
I came back here.

392
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,170
Preshrank Roy.

393
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:24,242
The name is nice.

394
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,438
But there is something
a spelling mistake, here

395
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:29,272
It's over, Misha.

396
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,380
Now you don't go digging
for anything new.

397
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:32,207
Forget that.

398
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,506
What is your plan for this evening?

399
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,136
Deepak has kept a party.

400
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,175
I am not for anything.
From now on, only work!

401
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:39,712
All the obstacles
have just been cleared

402
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,110
Good Morning.

403
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,339
Good Morning, I am Preshrank.
Preshrank Roy.

404
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,112
I'm a man of my time
I don't repeat myself.

405
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,611
Please, listen to me carefully

406
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,740
Just call your colleague Roshni Menon,

407
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,413
And, ask her to come down in a minute!
I mean in a minute

408
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,744
Okay Sir. Please wait here.

409
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,569
Alright

410
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,474
Hello!

411
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:29,577
Ms. Roshni, I have a Mr. Preshrank
Roy waiting for you at reception.

412
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,678
Please come out within one minute

413
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:33,342
What?

414
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,007
Are you free now?

415
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,276
I am not free now.

416
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:37,342
But I am free.

417
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,569
Who do you think you are, a star?

418
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:42,708
Yeah I have one such bad name

419
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:45,174
Do I still have to show off?

420
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:48,675
I Can't come. This is an office.

421
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,769
Oh do you think this is an office?

422
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:55,338
You will come

423
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:59,478
Don't force me..
I really don't want to insult you.

424
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,310
Excuse me!

425
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,440
10k Salvatore Farragma

426
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,278
Who...

427
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,437
'Who are you?

428
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:12,247
I don't care who you are,
so mind your own business..

429
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:13,477
Roshni

430
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:14,341
Excuse me"

431
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,706
Do you know who I am?

432
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:17,577
If you want,

433
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,371
you can speak to her.

434
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,314
I don't talk to strangers.
I am leaving!

435
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,671
You know, I'll just come.

436
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,342
I'll wait for 2 minute;
downstairs for you..

437
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,972
2 minutes

438
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,274
I wait only for one minute

439
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:37,139
Who the hell are you?
Should I call the police?

440
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,177
This is my office

441
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,507
For that you need an Address

442
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,447
And bill me for the damages"

443
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,336
2 minutes" downstairs"

444
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,110
Who is this guy Roshni?
What is this?

445
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,977
What is the scene..

446
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:01,071
I'm really sorry.
This will not happen again.

447
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,172
I will handle it.

448
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:23,609
Come.

449
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,507
Happy Valentines day!

450
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,972
Happy valentines day!

451
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:41,541
Have I seen you somewhere?

452
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,173
No. But you'll see
me in tomorrow's news.

453
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,241
Why?

454
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,478
I'm going to kill someone today!

455
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,237
Are you getting married?

456
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:56,078
Did you order something?

457
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,435
Ice tea and hamburger'.

458
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,001
- Same here.
- Alright!

459
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:12,472
When there are many experiences
of good and bad in our life,

460
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,706
we tend to lose these
so called formalities.

461
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,308
As for me,
I was always bad with it.

462
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,635
N o.

463
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:35,406
You won't understand anything.

464
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,640
For you, everything is a game.

465
00:40:40,134 --> 00:40:41,112
Everything?

466
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:43,475
Football! Football is a game

467
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:45,010
A celebration!

468
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:48,335
I am getting bored.

469
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:10,145
It was delicious;
You could have had it too.

470
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,541
I was just overreacting.

471
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:16,976
Ah" Anyways, it was good.
I was hungry.

472
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,677
Everything is Okay.

473
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:21,512
But now I have to get an answer.

474
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,035
What is it that you want?

475
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,305
Iced tea and burger.

476
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:27,104
I could have had
a black forest cake, too.

477
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,511
And then,
Some time with you

478
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,408
I haven't thought
anything more than that.

479
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,673
No. That can never be what you want.

480
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,504
You are not a man like than.

481
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,104
You are a selfish man!

482
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,611
You are only bothered
about your own happiness,

483
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,011
there is no value for other people's

484
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,013
reputation or tears,
for people like you.

485
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,637
Alright! Then, what is it that I want?

486
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:53,104
I know very well, what people
Like you want.

487
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,278
You want my body!

488
00:41:56,534 --> 00:41:58,070
What a pi!!!-

489
00:41:58,467 --> 00:41:59,411
Do you need to stoop so low?

490
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:03,607
You would be able to find far better
meanings to a man and woman's relationship

491
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:05,568
If your mind is matured.

492
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:08,514
The mind; Not the body.

493
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,174
Grow up if you can!

494
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:26,076
Roshni, a parcel for you!

495
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,043
Coming!

496
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:29,410
Madam!

497
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,504
Happy Birthday!

498
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,304
<i>'</i> Thank you!
- Bye.

499
00:43:38,634 --> 00:43:41,410
Hey! Don't tell me
it's your birthday!

500
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:44,612
It's Diya, my friend in New York!

501
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,310
Happy Birthday Roshni!

502
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,038
So, where's the party!

503
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,604
Ask for the day off today.

504
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,304
Let's roam all over London

505
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,344
Good idea!

506
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,010
As it is, I have a compensatory
day off for working on a Sunday

507
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,104
Let me just call the
office and inform them Okay?

508
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,076
Yes!

509
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,407
Let's call Nisha too.

510
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,444
Okay!

511
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,077
Anwar.

512
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,544
Pick!

513
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,140
Hello?

514
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,304
Good morning Roshni!

515
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:17,178
Hi! Good morning Anwar.

516
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,641
Can you drop by the office,
Roshni? It's an emergency.

517
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,777
- Anwar.
- I'll leave you early.

518
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:23,671
I am on leave today.

519
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,440
I won't take much time.
I shall leave you soon.

520
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:29,773
After you come, I shall brief the team.
Maximum 30 minutes.

521
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,007
30 minutes right?

522
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,540
Okay.

523
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,544
No Misha. There is no need
for you to come in to the office.

524
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,078
I will be back with in an hour.

525
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,005
Okay?

526
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,140
Okay!

527
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:47,110
Bye, then

528
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,343
Okay!

529
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:49,604
Hey Roshni,
- Yes sir!

530
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,371
Just a second..

531
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:53,176
We have some problem
with the payment gateway.

532
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:56,077
I want to you to do some
trial payments in check.

533
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:57,640
Sure, I will take a look at it.

534
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:59,111
This is to be done very carefully

535
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:01,778
We're all trying.
Don't let us down.

536
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,178
Okay Anwar

537
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:05,373
Bob, carry on!

538
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:14,113
Okay... Today is yet...

539
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,778
Hello!

540
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,346
Hello Roshni!
I'm at central London..

541
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:28,369
Where are you?

542
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:36,246
Hey Roshni, what's the update?

543
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,972
Anwar it's not showing any errors.

544
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,507
Wham are you saying? It's
not reï¬‚ecting in my system

545
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,279
But, it's not. I just checked it.

546
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:43,574
How many times did you run it?

547
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,235
About 20 times

548
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,505
You've come all dressed up, any ways.

549
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:48,011
Then why can't you do it properly.

550
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,141
Why do you think the
board is paying you?

551
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,736
Are you in London
for a pleasure trip?

552
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,503
No! Sir... I'll just
check it again sir.

553
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,546
You're here to get me results;
Results not to make efforts.

554
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:00,378
Yes sir!

555
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:13,477
Roshni have you cleared it?

556
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:15,476
Yes sir... I am

557
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,444
Don't be so helpless yar.
This is not child's play.

558
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,205
I'm trying sir.

559
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:22,736
Hell!

560
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,043
A Pain!

561
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,604
So, there's nothing for today?

562
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,780
No Nila It won't happen for today.

563
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:51,581
Alright! Then,
I'm going back home Okay.

564
00:46:52,334 --> 00:46:53,745
Hmm... Sorry

565
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,506
Bye! Bye!

566
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:14,635
Bye girls.

567
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,008
That's grand!

568
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,210
Alright!

569
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,307
I'll see you at the bar.

570
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,544
Bye Roshni!

571
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:22,674
Happy birthday!

572
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:23,711
Thanks.

573
00:48:14,734 --> 00:48:15,337
Roshni.

574
00:48:15,467 --> 00:48:15,774
Sir.

575
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:16,603
What's the update?

576
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,474
What happened?

577
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:19,707
420, Sir!

578
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,747
Hmm! I think,
do it till 500 and shut it down.

579
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:31,544
It could be a mistake on the
side of the people who checked it.

580
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,509
This was not deliberate.

581
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,712
I apologize for keeping you here
at work on a day like this your birthday

582
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,203
Happy Birthday!
Shut it down!

583
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:50,144
Happy Birthday to you.

584
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:52,770
Happy Birthday to you.

585
00:49:53,034 --> 00:49:55,981
Happy Birthday to Roshni.

586
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,570
Happy Birthday to you.

587
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:02,615
Happy Birthday to you.

588
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:06,705
Happy Birthday to you.

589
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:34,046
I never wanted to be the first
person to wish you neither the last.

590
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,107
But I want to be
a person to wish you.

591
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:40,579
Many, many happy returns of the day!

592
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:42,035
Thank you!

593
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:44,711
Cheers!

594
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,302
You look like Radha

595
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:52,773
Really!?

596
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:55,740
Now look very much like
(in Malayalam)...Radha..

597
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:57,276
Malayalam?

598
00:51:57,734 --> 00:51:59,771
I come to Guruvayur
Krishna temple every year.

599
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:03,011
I come to Guruvayur
Krishna temple every year.

600
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,510
Oh! Does that mean I
will never get my Krishnan?

601
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,011
I don't know about Krishna

602
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,540
But you will definitely
get your soul mate

603
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,276
Really, does soul mates
and miracles exist?

604
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,179
I don't know... but I believe it.

605
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:26,379
When you meet your soul mate or a miracle
happens the heavens send out a sign.

606
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:31,573
Stars...
they will come down to earth.

607
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,971
Stars will come down to Earth?

608
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,010
Hmmm..

609
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,104
Always smile... always" like Radha

610
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:15,014
Hi, Miss Roshni!
Are you free, today?

611
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:18,376
Oh Mr Preshrank Roy,
I am afraid, I am not free today.

612
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:19,172
H mmm?

613
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,710
You see that man sitting there?

614
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,505
Who? That priest?

615
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,177
Not a priest; A sanyasi.

616
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:27,445
Both are same

617
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:32,577
That man told me that if I walk forward
like this, I will meet my soul mate.

618
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,239
Didn't he tell you about the
Devil that would come from behind?

619
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,169
That is the problem
with these priests!

620
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:39,768
Yes

621
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:42,044
He told me not to pay
attention to the Devil.

622
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:46,171
Now, you have paid attention to the
Devil. So let's go to one place

623
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,107
Where?

624
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:49,205
To the Devil's den

625
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,342
"Hello, hey yo. Hello, hey yo".

626
00:54:13,434 --> 00:54:14,378
We'll win.

627
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,439
19, great!

628
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,708
Okay, now winners!

629
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:58,777
COME ON 5 SONG COME ON 5...
come on come on.. hmmm

630
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,640
What is there to laugh, so much?

631
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:15,671
Does it feel so good to poke fun?

632
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,171
It's fun to loose, actually

633
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,777
We can loose a 100 times.

634
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:20,704
Victory happens just once.

635
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:23,678
What's the fun in winning
if you don't loose?

636
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:26,269
Still, do we need to lose, like this?

637
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,637
Down on your luck today?

638
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,613
Hardly. Luck is not
on my side today at all.

639
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,112
Then why don't
we try your luck elsewhere?

640
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,372
May be that'll help.

641
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:45,074
No Tina. I don't find
any fun in playing games"

642
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:48,114
...in which my success is guaranteed.

643
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:51,544
If you will excuse me now,
I have another game to play

644
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,705
Okay?

645
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,138
As she said,

646
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:01,679
You could have tried
our luck there. Isn't it?

647
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:05,311
I never play games where
I know victory is assured

648
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:07,708
I give up this play.

649
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,575
So fast?

650
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,239
My;
is

651
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:16,644
What? No WW-

652
00:56:17,234 --> 00:56:20,374
Your birthday is on
9th mine is on 20th...

653
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,604
29... keep this on 29!

654
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,377
If we hit, we get
20 lakh Indian rupees!

655
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,138
Try-

656
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:28,577
Try your luck.

657
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:29,318
WOW! Oh my god!

658
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:04,475
Okay. Now next?

659
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:06,345
36

660
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,778
How you find this out,
I have understood

661
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,545
How?

662
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,311
Probability.

663
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,273
For a math wizard like you,

664
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,142
Finding this out is difficult?

665
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,008
The speed of the spinning wheel.

666
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,578
The speed at which
the ball is launched

667
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,704
The point at which the
ball hits the wheel first.

668
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,571
And above all this,
the air pressure in this room

669
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,213
Only after you know all this you get
the probability in Roulette.

670
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:34,005
What's this? It's just luck.

671
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:35,571
I don't believe you.

672
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,973
It is pure luck. Just watch

673
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:44,513
Next, as I said, 36 will never repeat.
Because luck can strike only once

674
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,735
Try

675
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:01,008
look, Luck

676
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,473
Luck again!

677
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:03,475
- Again luck?
- Why not? - Is it?

678
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:06,474
It's all a repetitions Roshni.

679
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:09,378
When victory repeats
why are you getting tensed?

680
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:13,345
We will repeat everything
Again and again.

681
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:16,574
Don't need,
I will test my luck myself.

682
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:20,146
Okay. I am getting call.

683
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:21,741
Can I have a coke please?

684
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:24,542
Hello!

685
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,442
Preshrank, how are things?

686
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,601
Sunny chaya

687
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,580
What are the plans for Christmaas?
Coming home?

688
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,577
Not as of now.

689
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:36,343
What is this you are saying, man?

690
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:38,705
Hi!

691
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,175
Hi!

692
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:41,378
I am Senthil.

693
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,611
Achaya, tell me one thing.

694
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:47,613
Nothing. We have a family get together. it
will be complete only if you are there, too.

695
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,311
Oh! All the Tharakan's are coming?

696
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:54,207
Not all of them.
Only the Mathew Tharakan family.

697
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,371
Wham a hot look baby! Are you Indian?

698
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,445
Albanian.

699
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:02,311
Isn't that enough? So, Thrissur will
run shot of alcohol This Christmas

700
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,342
I'm not coming

701
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:07,515
Alright! I don't want to force.

702
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,504
Hmm.. where are you now?

703
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:12,306
Excellent sense of humour!

704
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,380
So you are South Indian.
Tamilian, Telegu, or Mallu?

705
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,241
<i>Tum.</i>

706
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,302
I am on the way to Ottapalam

707
01:00:20,134 --> 01:00:23,240
Do you remember Baby Aunty who passed away?

708
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:24,506
One who had eloped with a Nair guy?

709
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,581
Yeah, the same. That Nair
guy lives in Ottapalam

710
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:30,713
Oh! Going there to invite the family?

711
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:35,047
First, Let me find them Then I will
decide whether to invite them or not.

712
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:38,507
- Okay then
- Okay, Preshrank.

713
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:40,737
Okay, okay. Fine!

714
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:44,974
She is a smanie.

715
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:48,080
Definitely a Mallu!
Palakkad or Cochin?

716
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,545
Could you hurry up please?
Just mind your own business 0k?

717
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,970
This is my business too.

718
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,208
Shall we go?

719
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:57,744
Who is this, uncle?

720
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:01,244
Boss or Professor?

721
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,077
If not both, then it's
a very bad choice.

722
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,271
Done? Shall we go, then?

723
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:10,144
What's the hurry, uncle? Wait for a while.
Let me woo her till then.

724
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,375
How is your mother? Is she fine?

725
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,480
What? What did you say about my mother now?

726
01:01:18,734 --> 01:01:24,013
You called me Uncle. Then, isn't your mother my
sister? Isn't it manners to inquire about a sister?

727
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,307
Oh really? I will give
you the number. Ask yourself

728
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:33,345
Then, I'll need to search your father
and ask him "Whose fatherless one you are".

729
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,607
Hey, what...

730
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,275

Hey, hey, he!!!

01:02:02,267 --> 01:02:04,679
I didn't do anything
He started it.

736
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,110
It's about who you did it to!

737
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,777
Understand?

738
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:11,343
Help him out!

739
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:13,377
Get out!

740
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,338
I just didn't expect a fight,
whatever!

741
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:31,208
EMU

742
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,202
Are you not wearing your seam belt?

743
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,306
No. I never wear.

744
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:42,170
Don't sit in my car
without wearing a seat belt.

745
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,071
M
WEED

746
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:45,044
I will ask you to get Out!

747
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:45,407
<i>WHAT'?</i>

748
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,137
Get Out!

749
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:47,538
I said, get out of my car!

750
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,435
Get outside!

751
01:02:49,534 --> 01:02:50,137
Get Out!

752
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,011
I told you to get out.

753
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,043
Are you serious?

754
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:57,478
Preshrank!

755
01:02:57,567 --> 01:02:58,443
Close the door!

756
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:02,008
Preshrank!

757
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,044
No, don't say that!

758
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,776
Yes! I am going to New York!

759
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,407
Even after there being
so many issues, here?

760
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:30,015
Whatever happens! I am here for maximum three
months. After that, I am going to New York.

761
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:31,545
So, pany?

762
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,110

763
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:35,637

<i>Hey Rash!</i>

765
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:55,176
Why this congratulation,
did you understand?

766
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:59,444
I saw the e-mail
about your New York assignment.

767
01:04:01,467 --> 01:04:02,969
You have to understand
one thing Roshni.

768
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,140
I was the head of the review committee

769
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:09,514
I am a person who feels happy for the
colleagues when they receive something good.

770
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,341
It's not something which
I have given you.

771
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:13,640
It's something which you
have earned for yourself.

772
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:15,309
Thank you, boss!

773
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,535
Nisha, Don't learn.

774
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,708
Okay?

775
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:20,337
You shall progress!

776
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,677
Not informing it to Preshrank?

777
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:29,045
What for?

778
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,671
"Oh!"

779
01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:43,410
"There she goes".

780
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,472
"Into a distant place".

781
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:53,979
"There she goes".

782
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,106
"Into a land".

783
01:04:58,234 --> 01:05:00,612
"Far away".

784
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,771
IIBaby-t

785
01:05:03,034 --> 01:05:05,139
IIBaby-t

786
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,306
"oh".

787
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,576
I am sorry.

788
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,774
For what?

789
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:22,246
Because, I always forget
to ask you one thing.

790
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:23,174
That's why.

791
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,074
Wham thing?

792
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,205
Can I kiss you?

793
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,778
What?

794
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:29,268
What did I just say?

795
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,003
Hmm, come on

796
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,078
Can I kiss you?

797
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,204
If you insist, you may.

798
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,176
Never mind forget it.

799
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,677
Am not in the mood.

800
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,405
Oh! Then what mood are you in, now?

801
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,005
Shall I tell you?

802
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,435
Tell me?

803
01:05:43,734 --> 01:05:45,304
Are you free for the next 25 years?

804
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,677
Why?

805
01:05:47,233 --> 01:05:48,678
We'll celebrate? Let's hang out

806
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,479
Hmm let me think about it.

807
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,178
Oh It's over.

808
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,643
- Is it finished?
-Yes, finished. It should finish.

809
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,371
What?

810
01:06:14,034 --> 01:06:17,072
My life is like a circle.

811
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:20,447
A circle; Which begins
and returns to the same point.

812
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:22,637
When it reaches
to where it began,

813
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:25,373
I too shall be finished,

814
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:27,708
just as this liquor on this bottle

815
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:30,137
Once and for all.

816
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,446
Nice prose Now, let's go home!

817
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:35,775
Em
E

818
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:39,706
Where are you going to get
more, in the middle of the night?

819
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:43,213
There are ways for that.
We will steal it!

820
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:43,710
Huh!

821
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,344
Are you coming with me?

822
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:48,271
When we befriend an devil...

823
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:50,208
...then you have to go to hell.

824
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,177
Oh .. I forgot.

825
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:52,711
What?

826
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,780
I need a cooling
glass, after two shots.

827
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,271
So?

828
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,176
Do you have one?

829
01:06:58,267 --> 01:06:59,746
Not a cooling glass but
I have a reading glass.

830
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,778
Okay, give me that.

831
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:07,744
Show me!

832
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,774
Ah!

833
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:10,775
Superb!

834
01:07:47,634 --> 01:07:48,408
Are you ready?

835
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:50,236
What if there is a problem?

836
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:52,511
If there is a problem,
then we move to Plan B.

837
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,974
What is Plan B?

838
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,970
First, let me figure
out what Plan A is.

839
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,209
There are two rules in Plan A!

840
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,578
Rule number one.

841
01:08:00,234 --> 01:08:01,645
Don't touch a single thing!

842
01:08:02,367 --> 01:08:03,311
And rule number two?

843
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,175
Rule number two: Whatever happens,
don't forget rule number one!

844
01:08:07,267 --> 01:08:07,768
Got it?

845
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,308
Okay? Come, come, come!

846
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,037
Come!

847
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:12,112
Hey Preshrank!

848
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:52,576
Technically, in all rules,

849
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:53,772
There is some difference

850
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:17,704
Wow! Adistillery!

851
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,670
No! A brewery!

852
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,208
Don't touch a single thing Okay?

853
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,244
Come!

854
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,572
Wow!

855
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:53,111
This is for you.

856
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:56,974
And this is for me.

857
01:10:06,734 --> 01:10:08,270
Ah, wow!

858
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:18,772
Wham did you touch?

859
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,705
No, no... this way. This way.

860
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,304
What else we've got?

861
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,638
Wow! That was unbelievable!

862
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,711
Oh!

863
01:11:30,401 --> 01:11:31,436
What was that?

864
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,242
God! I had so much fun.

865
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,746
Hey, Preshrank!

866
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,772
What happened?

867
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:45,035
Hey, what happened?

868
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,280
Hey, Preshrank!

869
01:11:49,267 --> 01:11:50,541
Why so serious?

870
01:11:56,734 --> 01:11:57,769
Hey!

871
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,740

One who has different houses

VWnter houses, summer houses..

879
01:16:17,134 --> 01:16:19,637
And you live here?

880
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:24,505
Are the rooms more important...

881
01:16:24,601 --> 01:16:25,739
or, is it the people,
who live there are more important?

882
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,774
Please sit down..

883
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:32,973
Hey! Don't start messing up my things!

884
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:34,444
It will become difficult
to find things later.

885
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,506
Yeah, at the moment they are kept as
tidily as in ajewellery store, right?

886
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,077
How did you find this place?

887
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,279
With Ten Pounds,
can't anything be done in London?

888

01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:08,476
Coffee.

895

There's no sugar in this.

899
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:25,010
That's white poison!

900
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:26,337
One should never use it.

901
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:29,047

01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:47,978
That is not going to happen.

908
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:51,110
Why? Do you have some other work?

909
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:54,214
I am not interested.
If you want to go, go all by yourself.

910
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:06,307
Fifty thousand pounds?

911
01:18:07,234 --> 01:18:09,510
50 lakh rupees!
For whom is this cheque for?

912
01:18:09,634 --> 01:18:11,443
For whomever! Keep it there!

913
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,774
Or you can keep it.

914
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:16,771
I don't want!

915
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,407
Aren't you free, today?
Can you give me a help?

916
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,238
I will. But, what about
The thing I had told you?

917
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:35,740
Wham? You want the cheque?

918
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,643
No. Outer London.

919
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:43,270
Okay.

920
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:48,044
Just one condition.

921
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:51,245
What's that?

922
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,003
We will go by bus.
I had enough traveling by car.

923
01:18:57,367 --> 01:18:58,243
Okay.

924
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:01,238
Then, I will do.

925
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:21,041
Don't bother about
the way they look at you.

926
01:19:21,734 --> 01:19:23,611
Outsiders don't come here

927
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,202
The only ones who come are
collection people.

928
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:27,577
Or the police, or "children catchers".

929
01:19:28,134 --> 01:19:29,135
"Children catchers"?

930
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,137
The social services department
have taken children from homes here

931
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:33,645
and place them in foster care.

932
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:35,008
To get them education, of course

933
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:37,707
But in away...

934
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,302
...isn't that better?

935
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:40,735
May be!

936
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,110
It is!

937
01:19:42,634 --> 01:19:43,704
This, Du Yee?

938
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,542
John Du Yee.
Settled here at a very young age.

939
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,614
They live upstairs, there.
You go!

940
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:54,475
Me alone?

941
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,544
Wham else?

942
01:19:55,801 --> 01:19:57,371
I will be in this street!

943
01:19:59,034 --> 01:19:59,569
Come on!

944
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:35,304
Mrs. Du Yee

945
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:49,671
Mrs. Du Yee

946
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,172
Mrs. Du Yee

947
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,171
I have come to speak to you
about something very important.

948
01:21:09,201 --> 01:21:11,374
May I come in, please?

949
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:23,041
Hi!

950
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,246
I don't mean to intrude like this

951
01:21:26,334 --> 01:21:28,109
I don't know if you remember.

952
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,372
We met... I was there
at your husband's funeral.

953
01:21:34,334 --> 01:21:35,335
L, actually...

954
01:21:36,367 --> 01:21:38,643
Please, take this and
give us one more week.

955
01:21:40,634 --> 01:21:43,478
I am sorry! I didn't understand...
I don't know what you are saying

956
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:45,205
Mrs. Du Yee

957
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,111
- Please. Don't take away my children
- No, no. I don't want it.

958
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:50,976
Please. Don't take
away my children

959
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:54,276
Please Don't take away my
children. They are all I have.

960
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:56,272
'Up-

961
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,739
I am not here to
take the children away.

962
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:07,738
Don't worry, I am not
here to take the children away.

963
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:11,605
This is for you.

964
01:22:17,734 --> 01:22:20,112
Your Husband had a life
insurance policy with us.

965
01:22:20,167 --> 01:22:21,703
I have come to settle the claim

966
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:33,013
<i>Oh Thank You'. Thank You God'. he He'.!</i>

967
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,207
Oh Thank You! Thank You God!

968
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,478
Thank You! Thank You God!

969
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:50,537
Oh Thank You! Thank You God!

970
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:23,569
Preshrank!

971
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,236
Yes

972
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:30,038
Wham you missed, just now,
was the special moments of life's

973
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:32,441
Who says that?
You taste this noodles.

974
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,706
There will never come a
special moment than this!

975
01:23:39,734 --> 01:23:41,042
I don't have money with me

976
01:23:41,234 --> 01:23:43,578
Please pay for this. Okay?
I will be there.

977
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:09,038
As of now, I don't have plans of buying
gratitude and blessings by giving money.

978
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:10,374
That is not the path that I am on.

979
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:12,978
Which path are you on, then?

980
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:14,410
When people reach their destinamionsw

981
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,740
...the journey ends for them

982
01:24:16,234 --> 01:24:19,215
For me, the end is
the destination The end!

983
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,702
Still, you shouldn't have
hid yourself, like this, from them.

984
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,474
They were in need of money
and they got that.

985
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:26,375
There ends it!

986
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:30,070
You should have seen their happiness.

987
01:24:30,634 --> 01:24:32,636
Money can only comfort you...

988
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:34,512
...it can never give happiness

989
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:38,310
Yes everything is right
in philosophy. But...

990
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,378
But what?

991
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,335
Money is a tool.

992
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:43,611
You need it for certain things,

993
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,407
Beyond that, it has no value.

994
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,072
Oh! Who would Preshrank
Roy be if he didn't have money?

995
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,744
Even without money,
Preshrank Roy would be Preshrank Roy, only.

996
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,279
Is it? Can you prove it!

997
01:24:54,434 --> 01:24:57,142
Today, until now, I have
traveled without a single penny.

998
01:24:57,234 --> 01:24:58,713
I traveled this far,

999
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,076
I ate my choice of food.

1000
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:02,043
Didn't we also buy other things too?

1001
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,271
But that's because I had money. Isn't it?
What if that was also not there?

1002
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:09,574
Okay. I will show you
Give me your purse!

1003
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:10,304
Aw
E-

1004
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:17,069
Oh, Heavy!

1005
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:20,610
Preshrank!

1006
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:26,474
Hey' my Purse!
MY Purse!

1007
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,146
Let me show you what
a penniless Preshrank Roy can do.

1008
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:29,745
Come!

1009
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,043
Preshrank!

1010
01:25:41,634 --> 01:25:42,544
Preshrank!

1011
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,041
It's getting dark.
What's more? Tell me?

1012
01:25:54,134 --> 01:25:56,239
One minute.
I am hunting for a solution right now.

1013
01:25:57,134 --> 01:25:59,114
Ah, found it, Found it. Come!

1014
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:07,745
What solution is here?

1015
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,604
This is where the solution is.
Come!

1016
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:16,110
Fred!!! Fred!!! Fred!!!

1017
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:21,980
Fred!!! Fred!!! Fred!!!

1018
01:26:24,734 --> 01:26:29,046
Fred!!! Fred!!! Fred!!!

1019
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:31,444
Finally, I have found a solution;
To give you a solution.

1020
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,978
You came in here to drink?

1021
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:34,011
Wham else?

1022
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:35,705
To catch fish?

1023
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:38,311
Are you going to wrestle To have a beer?

1024
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,179
No. I am going to defeat him

1025
01:26:41,267 --> 01:26:42,439
a
a

1026
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:49,616
Fred!!! Fred!!! Fred!!!

1027
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:55,549
Fred!!! Fred!!! Fred!!!

1028
01:26:55,634 --> 01:26:57,307
So, who's next?

1029
01:27:06,367 --> 01:27:07,710
How about this challenge?

1030
01:27:08,467 --> 01:27:10,674
Oh, this is an drinking competition is it?

1031
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:11,974
Not alcohol. Beer.

1032
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,304
Where is the bartender?

1033
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:15,307
I am the bartender!

1034
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:22,369
What are these chillies?

1035
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,245
Hot chilli and beer challenge.

1036
01:27:24,334 --> 01:27:25,472
And then?

1037
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:28,043
Spiciest chilies, in the world.

1038
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:29,510
We have to keep eating it.

1039
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,581
The first person who shall have the beer,
while eating, loses.

1040
01:27:32,734 --> 01:27:34,179
Hey Indian, are you ready?

1041
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:36,178
0k, Englishman!

1042
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,738
Arminite? Scottish?

1043
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:40,669
Welsh?

1044
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,235
I am Russian!

1045
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,710
Oh okay! Pust' nachnetsya igra!

1046
01:29:18,334 --> 01:29:20,712
Marriage? No way.

1047
01:29:21,534 --> 01:29:22,535
I don't want marriage.

1048
01:29:22,601 --> 01:29:24,103
Wham I want is, freedom

1049
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:26,539
Why

1050
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,204
It's not than, one becomes slaves

1051
01:29:29,534 --> 01:29:31,980
But one never becomes the owner
of himself after marriage

1052
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:36,282
For example, time. Imagine if
it gets a little late

1053
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:39,337
Hey, how are we going to go home?

1054
01:29:39,434 --> 01:29:41,436
You are the one who wanted freedom
Enjoy it!

1055
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,204
Hey, Preshrank!

1056
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,739
The length and breadth
are both correct.

1057
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,603
What?

1058
01:29:52,301 --> 01:29:52,745
Hey, what is this?

1059
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,536
It's already so late.
Let's go in the morning

1060
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:56,670
Wham about me?

1061
01:29:57,067 --> 01:29:59,069
Please wake me as you wake up
in the morning. Don't get late

1062
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,438
Hey! Hello!

1063
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:11,012
Preshrank!

1064
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:13,543
Look!

1065
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,144
It's beautiful!

1066
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,111
Anybody there?

1067
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:34,109
Anybody there?

1068
01:30:34,701 --> 01:30:37,705
Yes. There is a witch and a devil.

1069
01:30:38,401 --> 01:30:42,008
True. I too feel there is a devil.

1070
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:46,075
Wow! It's so beautiful.

1071
01:30:47,134 --> 01:30:49,136
Just like we have entered
Queen Elizabeth's palace!

1072
01:30:49,234 --> 01:30:51,214
Yes. It's a palace indeed!

1073
01:30:53,034 --> 01:30:56,982
Marlow, Spencer, Shakespeare...

1074
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:13,142
Hast thou wept thy soul away twice
once in mirth, and once in sorrow?

1075
01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:15,236
This is a question
asked by God to humans

1076
01:31:15,334 --> 01:31:18,247
Have you cried like
you have touch your soul?

1077
01:31:18,701 --> 01:31:21,204
At least once in sadness
and once in happiness?

1078
01:31:21,634 --> 01:31:24,046
Oh God! Philosophy, Philosophy!

1079
01:31:24,467 --> 01:31:27,573
Tell me, Mr Preshrank Roy.

1080
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:29,204
Have you cried?

1081
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:33,243
When I was a small kid,
I used to cry when I lost something

1082
01:31:33,634 --> 01:31:35,545
I believed that my mother
would get it back for me.

1083
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,104
When I learnt, that whatever is
destroyed cannot be brought back...

1084
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,239
...I slowly lost my ability to cry.

1085
01:31:43,001 --> 01:31:46,244
Today, I don't even know
how to cry artificially

1086
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:47,208
I have forgotten!

1087
01:31:48,801 --> 01:31:50,542
Wham am I hearing?

1088
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:53,138
Preshrank Roy also has sentiments?

1089
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:56,045
The stars might have come down
to earth. Let me see

1090
01:31:57,034 --> 01:31:58,104
What stars?

1091
01:31:58,367 --> 01:31:59,368
Haven't you heard?

1092
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:05,243
When miracles happen, the
stars themselves descend onto earth.

1093
01:32:05,334 --> 01:32:06,506
Miracle is something that was found out,

1094
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,204
...to fool humans.

1095
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,243
It's bed time. Go to sleep!

1096
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:23,376
Just because you closed your eyes
It doesn't mean you have to sleep.

1097
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,240
What's your problem?

1098
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,144
Won't you let me sleep?

1099
01:32:27,467 --> 01:32:29,572
In the middle of the night,
you want to deliver cinema dialogues?

1100
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,078
Go and sleep!

1101
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:40,276
Good night!

1102
01:32:40,367 --> 01:32:41,277
Good night!

1103
01:33:23,734 --> 01:33:24,542
Preshrank!

1104
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:47,043
Preshrank!

1105
01:33:53,734 --> 01:33:54,769
Preshrank!

1106
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:19,271
Oh it's only this high.

1107
01:34:19,367 --> 01:34:20,175
Why, not enough?

1108
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,702
Not enough to jump and die

1109
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:26,441
I still have few desires left.

1110
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:28,104
After I achieve those,
will think of trying to die

1111
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:29,974
For that there is a day.
A special day.

1112
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,472
So, not now.

1113
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,274
Shall I come there?

1114
01:34:36,767 --> 01:34:37,711
â€œMy? Wanna jump?

1115
01:34:38,601 --> 01:34:41,241
No. To have a look, from there.

1116
01:34:49,734 --> 01:34:52,237
Preshrank, I would have fallen.

1117
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:54,072
Even if you fall,
the height is not enough to die

1118
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:58,043
Don't stand here for too long.

1119
01:34:58,134 --> 01:34:59,670
It's along way to London.

1120
01:35:00,067 --> 01:35:00,772
Come!

1121
01:35:02,634 --> 01:35:03,510
Good Morning!

1122
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,442
Morning!

1123
01:35:52,467 --> 01:35:53,275
Thank you!

1124
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,972
It's been a pleasure!

1125
01:35:59,067 --> 01:36:00,375
When Do I meet you again?

1126
01:36:00,734 --> 01:36:03,180
Oh, One second! One second!
Just a minute!

1127
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:09,305
<i>E-
E-</i>

1128
01:36:09,401 --> 01:36:11,574
Hey, Purse?

1129
01:36:12,034 --> 01:36:12,705
Yeah Purse.

1130
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:14,774
Then what about my purse?

1131
01:36:15,034 --> 01:36:15,671
That's gone!

1132
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:21,778
Hmm. So, is that all,
what has happened?

1133
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:23,975
'KNhat worse could have happened,
than this?

1134
01:36:25,067 --> 01:36:25,772
Alright then.

1135
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:33,072
Preshrank, thanks!

1136
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:39,114
For making me realize
that there are things..

1137
01:36:39,434 --> 01:36:43,507
...that we can enjoy even
without money. Thanks!

1138
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:51,614
So, I'll see you...
hmm, what am I saying.

1139
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,277
I'll see you when I see you

1140
01:36:59,467 --> 01:37:01,276
I'll see you when I see you

1141
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,040
What's happened to you?

1142
01:37:35,134 --> 01:37:36,579
That's exactly what
I wanted to ask

1143
01:37:37,134 --> 01:37:37,669
What?

1144
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,510
You canceled the
New York project. Isn't it?

1145
01:37:43,634 --> 01:37:47,104
Didn't you tell,
to take decisions according to my choice?

1146
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:49,673
I know how much you miss me

1147
01:37:50,167 --> 01:37:52,078
I know, for whom this decision is

1148
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,674
Then why you are asking?

1149
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,507
Roshni, this is not a joke,
as you think

1150
01:37:57,367 --> 01:37:58,539
Look at this?

1151
01:38:00,767 --> 01:38:01,575
What?

1152
01:38:03,434 --> 01:38:04,708
Residents living near St. Peter's.

1153
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,245
Brewery woke up to gun shots

1154
01:38:07,067 --> 01:38:07,977
Not that.

1155
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:11,076
Security personnel have scanned
the CCTV footage.

1156
01:38:11,167 --> 01:38:14,546
...and identified a man and
woman who seem to have broken in.

1157
01:38:15,067 --> 01:38:17,377
However, there is no indication
of any loss thus far.

1158
01:38:17,467 --> 01:38:20,107
The police are investigating
the possible connection.

1159
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:23,704
...between this break in and
a similar incident fifteen year back,

1160
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:25,041
In which an anonymous man...

1161
01:38:25,134 --> 01:38:27,478
Let me see

1162
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:29,677
Now, you understood just that?

1163
01:38:29,767 --> 01:38:33,408
Look Your association with Preshrank Roy
will not get anything good for you.

1164
01:38:33,634 --> 01:38:34,578
I know

1165
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,770
Are you in love with him?

1166
01:38:37,534 --> 01:38:40,981
If you ask me, like that,
I don't know!

1167
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,977
"Whom to say it to?"

1168
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:58,276
"The soul is dancing".

1169
01:39:05,134 --> 01:39:08,308
"Who is to listen?".

1170
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:11,575
"Sing without singing".

1171
01:39:11,667 --> 01:39:17,379
"The world is becoming lovely".

1172
01:39:31,667 --> 01:39:37,481
"The time to is going so slow".

1173
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:01,475
"Whom to say it to".

1174
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:04,605
"The soul is dancing".

1175
01:41:11,601 --> 01:41:14,673
"Who is to listen?".

1176
01:41:14,767 --> 01:41:18,180
"Sing without singing".

1177
01:41:18,267 --> 01:41:23,580
"Together; this song".

1178
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:24,202
Come in!

1179
01:42:24,534 --> 01:42:25,604
Good Morning Raymond!

1180
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:29,011
Good Morning Miss Roshni!
Lovely ï¬‚owers.

1181
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:29,703
Are they for me?

1182
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:31,678
Well, no.

1183
01:42:31,767 --> 01:42:33,769
I think YOU know
who deserves it today.

1184
01:42:34,067 --> 01:42:34,704
Where is he?

1185
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,479
I think you know where he lives

1186
01:42:36,634 --> 01:42:39,080
'Nell, I went there,
and he was not there.

1187
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:40,612
So, could you please help me!

1188
01:42:40,701 --> 01:42:42,703
I too want to help you, my dear.

1189
01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:45,008
You are such
a lovely girl, but.

1190
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:48,105
Raymond, you know that he doesn't deserve
to be to be alone. Specially, today

1191
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,304
So, where is he?

1192
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:51,142
I am helpless, Miss Roshni.

1193
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,106
Fine! Just give this to him

1194
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,071
Miss Roshni, how are you going back?

1195
01:43:00,167 --> 01:43:01,168
By bus! Why?

1196
01:43:02,234 --> 01:43:05,443
There is a short cut through
St Stephen's Cathedral.

1197
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:09,343
Thank you, Raymond!

1198
01:43:09,434 --> 01:43:10,504
You're welcome!

1199
01:43:47,567 --> 01:43:49,012
Happy Birthday!

1200
01:43:50,701 --> 01:43:52,510
You seem to have learnt my ways.
Isn't it?

1201
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:56,209
I never expected
to find Preshrank Roy in a church.

1202
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:01,478
This is a habit, since childhood.

1203
01:44:02,534 --> 01:44:03,672
Every year, one day,

1204
01:44:04,334 --> 01:44:06,314
I go to church and
confess for the whole year.

1205
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,009
Sorry!

1206
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,601
Excuse me!

1207
01:44:11,234 --> 01:44:12,770
It's been such a long time,

1208
01:44:13,034 --> 01:44:15,571
Since I have seen you
two darlings here together'.

1209
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:18,147
Where have you been hiding
all this time?

1210
01:44:18,234 --> 01:44:20,043
I have missed you so much!

1211
01:44:20,134 --> 01:44:22,637
I've been here? I don't understand

1212
01:44:22,767 --> 01:44:24,212
Is that so?

1213
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:27,180
You still look as lovely, as ever?

1214
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:36,645
Preshrank, happy birthday

1215
01:44:37,534 --> 01:44:38,444
Thank you!

1216
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:42,441
That old lady...
Says, she seen us here before.

1217
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:43,740
She is crazy.

1218
01:44:44,434 --> 01:44:47,074
There's nothing wrong with her.
There's something in what she said.

1219
01:44:49,134 --> 01:44:50,579
You have nothing better to do?...

1220
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:51,702
...other than disturbing?

1221
01:44:55,767 --> 01:44:56,768
Do come!

1222
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,606
Preshrank, what are you hiding from me?

1223
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:02,407
Why this hide and seek, game?

1224
01:45:03,467 --> 01:45:06,573
Hiding? Me?
For what? Don't I have things to do?

1225
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:57,243
Security personnel have scanned
the CCTV footage.

1226
01:45:57,334 --> 01:45:59,143
...and identified a man and
woman

1227
01:45:59,201 --> 01:46:03,411
Who have entered St. Peter's brewerieg
in the thick of the night.

1228
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,637
After going through the C.C.'l'.V footage,

1229
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:07,509
they were able to identify them, as...

1230
01:46:07,601 --> 01:46:09,410
...being, man and woman

1231
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,309
Although there have been no damages

1232
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:14,142
The incident that
took place 15 years ago; Is it...

1233
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:17,238
...related to this incident,
is what matter.

1234
01:47:16,334 --> 01:47:18,143
L...just want it.

1235
01:48:07,601 --> 01:48:09,979
Elena... his wife

1236
01:48:33,134 --> 01:48:34,238
His wife.

1237
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,538
Where is she now?

1238
01:48:41,301 --> 01:48:42,507
She is no more

1239
01:48:43,067 --> 01:48:45,377
She died in an accident.

1240
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:55,604
That's true. Maybe that's
why my wife deserted me and left.

1241
01:50:04,801 --> 01:50:06,644
Have I seen you somewhere?

1242
01:50:13,001 --> 01:50:15,106
Where have you been hiding all this time?

1243
01:50:15,201 --> 01:50:17,374
I have missed you so much!

1244
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,309
Isn't everything just
a repetition, Roshni?

1245
01:50:25,401 --> 01:50:29,144
We can repeat everything
again and again... AGAIN AND AGAIN!

1246
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:31,210
AGAIN AND AGAIN!

1247
01:50:31,734 --> 01:50:34,772
AGAIN AND AGAIN!

1248
01:50:52,534 --> 01:50:53,569
Preshrank!

1249
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,610
Preshrank!

1250
01:53:24,467 --> 01:53:26,071
You are unnecessarily
getting hassled over this

1251
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,070
Those photos and those dates.

1252
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:30,573
The photos were placed in
the pages of the exact dates that.

1253
01:53:30,668 --> 01:53:32,113
...I went to those places.

1254
01:53:33,134 --> 01:53:38,413
No, when I was taken to those places

1255
01:53:38,634 --> 01:53:41,376
He is trying to relive
his late wife's life with me..

1256
01:53:41,667 --> 01:53:44,079
But he got upset and left. What then?

1257
01:53:44,767 --> 01:53:46,269
That's not how it is Misha.

1258
01:53:46,367 --> 01:53:47,277
Look at this!

1259
01:53:51,134 --> 01:53:53,705
The day Eleena met with an
accident there was an argument.

1260
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,303
Mbetween Preshrank
and Eleena in some hotel

1261
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,736
In that case, he much have"

1262
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:01,207
Accident!

1263
01:54:02,267 --> 01:54:03,302
When was the dame?

1264
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:13,242
- Will he repeat the accident too?

1265
01:54:30,734 --> 01:54:32,111
Should we go to the police?

1266
01:54:33,034 --> 01:54:35,014
And, what should we complain about?

1267
01:54:35,534 --> 01:54:37,070
He hasn't done something wrong. Isn't it?

1268
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,606
And his influence...

1269
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,141
In that case you should leave
this country as soon as you can.

1270
01:54:41,534 --> 01:54:42,308
Now, than...

1271
01:55:22,134 --> 01:55:23,272
Hey Roshni!

1272
01:55:25,767 --> 01:55:26,973
How come you are you here?

1273
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,644
How come you are here, Anwar?

1274
01:55:29,434 --> 01:55:31,744
We go for shopping every Sunday.

1275
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,274
That's our routine.

1276
01:55:36,467 --> 01:55:37,775
This is my wife,

1277
01:55:38,234 --> 01:55:38,609
Noora

1278
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:39,576
Hi.

1279
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:41,245
Hello!

1280
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,139
Don't be alarmed,
I haven't done this.

1281
01:55:45,334 --> 01:55:46,608
She is like this from birth.

1282
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,245
She is like this from birth.

1283
01:55:49,434 --> 01:55:51,038
Where is she from, in Kerala?

1284
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:52,440
One can say, Calicut.

1285
01:55:52,667 --> 01:55:55,045
But she was brought up in an orphanage.

1286
01:55:56,001 --> 01:55:57,503
When we met in college

1287
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,544
Our love story which began that day,
reached until here

1288
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:04,377
That's not what you
have heard. Isn't it?

1289
01:56:05,267 --> 01:56:06,143
No!

1290
01:56:07,467 --> 01:56:08,468
That's how it.

1291
01:56:08,801 --> 01:56:11,179
Wham we hear about,
or see in certain cases.

1292
01:56:11,267 --> 01:56:13,543
...may actually be
very far from reality

1293
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,244
Anwar, that's great.

1294
01:56:20,301 --> 01:56:24,511
What for? Because I loved here?
But haven't I done that for myself?

1295
01:56:25,101 --> 01:56:27,980
Don't we all take risk in life,
every moment? Isn't it?

1296
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,611
When we take that risk for a person,
we sometimes call it Love.

1297
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:39,406
M
is

1298
01:56:42,234 --> 01:56:44,976
Roshni, you're beautiful
than I had imagined

1299
01:56:45,634 --> 01:56:47,773
Thank you.
Nice to meet you, Noora.

1300
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:49,138
Nice meeting you.

1301
01:56:49,401 --> 01:56:50,072
Alright Roshni.

1302
01:56:50,167 --> 01:56:52,408
Shall we leave, now?
See you in office tomorrow.

1303
01:56:53,134 --> 01:56:53,669
- Have a good day.
- You too.

1304
01:56:53,767 --> 01:56:55,007
Bye.

1305
01:57:07,234 --> 01:57:09,180
That is the moment I had realized,

1306
01:57:09,501 --> 01:57:12,414
That, I won't be able
to forget him, ever.

1307
01:57:59,701 --> 01:58:01,703
Where were you?
I was trying for you.

1308
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:04,544
Yes, Good afternoon!

1309
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:09,472
Oh, my phone had some complaint.

1310
01:58:09,701 --> 01:58:11,374
Okay. Are you free tomorrow morning?

1311
01:58:13,001 --> 01:58:13,979
Yes, I am

1312
01:58:14,334 --> 01:58:16,007
Then let's meet at
Al Fresco Restaurant.

1313
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:19,408
I have to tell you
something very important.

1314
01:58:20,534 --> 01:58:21,774
I also.

1315
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,513
Okay. I will send Raymond
over. He will pick you up

1316
01:58:26,367 --> 01:58:27,345
Thanks.

1317
01:58:40,467 --> 01:58:42,378
Wham do you think about this Ma'am?

1318
01:58:42,801 --> 01:58:44,474
Yeah, I like it!

1319
01:58:46,134 --> 01:58:48,512
It will be good for special occasion.

1320
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:53,481
Oh yes, the occasion is special,
very special.

1321
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:23,775
Thanks!

1322
01:59:24,267 --> 01:59:25,109
Welcome!

1323
01:59:53,167 --> 01:59:53,702
Hi!

1324
01:59:53,801 --> 01:59:54,541
Hi!

1325
01:59:54,634 --> 01:59:55,476
Please!

1326
01:59:55,767 --> 01:59:56,609
Thank you!

1327
01:59:59,301 --> 02:00:02,510
This is Roshni.
The only friend I have.

1328
02:00:03,134 --> 02:00:04,010
Hi Roshni!

1329
02:00:04,134 --> 02:00:04,771
Hi.

1330
02:00:05,034 --> 02:00:07,105
Roshni, this is Sandhya

1331
02:00:08,567 --> 02:00:11,309
The one I am going to marry.

1332
02:00:16,634 --> 02:00:18,079
That's a surprise.

1333
02:00:22,301 --> 02:00:23,405
Congratulations!

1334
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:26,679
We are just as surprised as you are

1335
02:00:31,301 --> 02:00:33,247
You are aware of my self
introduction skills, etc. Don't you?

1336
02:00:33,667 --> 02:00:35,544
When Sandhya said she
wanted to know more about me,

1337
02:00:36,034 --> 02:00:37,741
I thought about you.

1338
02:00:38,001 --> 02:00:39,241
You are my best friend.

1339
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:44,640
Roshni, You are a little late.
I have to urgently leave for some place

1340
02:00:45,034 --> 02:00:47,537
Yeah, I got a bit lame.

1341
02:00:49,067 --> 02:00:50,239
Anyway, you have met the
person. isn't it?

1342
02:00:50,334 --> 02:00:51,438
Now whenever you get time,

1343
02:00:51,667 --> 02:00:53,146
you can ask her whatever
it is that you want know about me

1344
02:00:53,234 --> 02:00:56,215
Now we shall get talking.
Isn't it, Roshni?

1345
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,509
Okay? I'll be there.

1346
02:00:58,567 --> 02:00:59,545
Okay!

1347
02:01:04,567 --> 02:01:06,410
Roshni, Aren't you in TCS?

1348
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:07,543
Yes

1349
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,302
How long have you been here?

1350
02:01:10,401 --> 02:01:12,244
It's been an year.

1351
02:01:12,567 --> 02:01:15,104
I work at King's College.

1352
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:16,441
Long ten years.

1353
02:01:22,667 --> 02:01:26,444
Alright! I will call you, Roshni.
I have to go now.

1354
02:01:27,334 --> 02:01:28,779
How do you know each other?

1355
02:01:30,134 --> 02:01:35,049
That... that... friends.
We know each other since years.

1356
02:01:35,434 --> 02:01:38,244
But I did not expect
of this relationship.

1357
02:01:39,567 --> 02:01:43,276
Sandhya
M

1358
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:51,479
So ladies,
how did your discussion go?

1359
02:01:52,201 --> 02:01:54,477
Preshrank, what you said was true.

1360
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,312
No one other than Roshani can you.

1361
02:02:01,467 --> 02:02:02,445
Alright!

1362
02:02:02,634 --> 02:02:03,669
You people carry on!

1363
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:04,737
E mu
E

1364
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:06,207
Bye!

1365
02:02:10,567 --> 02:02:11,568
So, what do you think?

1366
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:15,509
Preshrank, at least now,
can't you stop this game?

1367
02:02:16,267 --> 02:02:17,405
I know everything!

1368
02:02:18,167 --> 02:02:19,111
Wham do you know?

1369
02:02:20,034 --> 02:02:23,208
I know... lam not Elena, but Roshni!

1370
02:02:24,401 --> 02:02:26,347
You dressed up like
this to prove that?

1371
02:02:30,734 --> 02:02:32,236
What the hell do you want?

1372
02:02:34,501 --> 02:02:37,345
I want to be with you,
till the end of my life

1373
02:02:41,634 --> 02:02:42,772
Get lost!

1374
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,041
I will be with you always

1375
02:02:47,334 --> 02:02:48,677
It's enough Roshni.

1376
02:02:49,067 --> 02:02:50,137
Yes it is enough.

1377
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,480
At least now, can't you finish it all?

1378
02:02:53,734 --> 02:02:56,408
Yes I will end it.

1379
02:02:57,234 --> 02:03:00,374
But I don't want to hurt you.

1380
02:03:00,767 --> 02:03:05,079
I wanted to keep you out of all this.
But if this is your decision, then,

1381
02:03:06,067 --> 02:03:08,047
I'll finish it all,
this very day.

1382
02:03:50,434 --> 02:03:51,572
It's him.

1383
02:04:13,567 --> 02:04:15,740
For everybody else, when they reach
their destination, the journey ends.

1384
02:04:16,034 --> 02:04:19,243
But for me,
the end is the destination... THE EN D.

1385
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,477
My life is like a circle.

1386
02:04:28,101 --> 02:04:30,274
A circle which starts at one
point and returns right back to it.

1387
02:04:30,434 --> 02:04:32,436
I will also not be there

1388
02:04:55,401 --> 02:04:58,439
There is a day for that.
A special day. So don't jump now.

1389
02:06:00,367 --> 02:06:01,778
Did you think that I died?

1390
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:06,074
You should have Who is topping you?

1391
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:10,176
Whether it is to live or to die,
it is now always people who will stop.

1392
02:06:10,267 --> 02:06:11,575
Isn't that words?

1393
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:18,511
It was finally, when I had decided
to end it all...

1394
02:06:20,067 --> 02:06:21,637
...that you pulled me towards life.

1395
02:06:22,334 --> 02:06:25,110
That day, I thought it was Elina

1396
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,402
Then, when I got to know you,
It was a nice thing

1397
02:07:04,434 --> 02:07:06,141
That precious moments with Elina...

1398
02:07:06,234 --> 02:07:07,372
...I wish to live again

1399
02:07:09,567 --> 02:07:10,773
Before I die

1400
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,339
ls life something
you just throw away..

1401
02:07:13,434 --> 02:07:15,004
...for the sake of memories
of another person?

1402
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,370
Another person.

1403
02:07:19,134 --> 02:07:21,478
As far as I know,
Elina is not another person.

1404
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:29,174
Stubborn, reckless, brave;
Much more than I am.

1405
02:07:30,367 --> 02:07:34,042
Sometimes I even think
I got all this from Elena

1406
02:07:35,701 --> 02:07:39,649
Elena made me, the way I am now.

1407
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:44,238
And a quarrel like we always do.

1408
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,041
She just wanted to scare me.

1409
02:07:50,368 --> 02:07:51,278
But...

1410
02:07:58,801 --> 02:08:01,611
A pan of me died along with Eleena

1411
02:08:02,367 --> 02:08:04,711
A half of my mind and soul.

1412
02:08:05,267 --> 02:08:07,076
You loved Elena so much?

1413
02:08:08,701 --> 02:08:11,477
May be because I am unable to live
together with her, till I my death...

1414
02:08:11,701 --> 02:08:14,238
...I love her..Always...

1415
02:08:16,234 --> 02:08:18,214
It took me too long to
realise I was adding you..

1416
02:08:18,434 --> 02:08:21,472
...to the balance
sheet of my tragedies.

1417
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:25,205
Then I thought to keep
you away from all this

1418
02:08:26,267 --> 02:08:28,213
That marriage
drama was for that?

1419
02:08:31,267 --> 02:08:35,306
People happily living in this world,
are they the one's ..

1420
02:08:35,401 --> 02:08:36,675
...who has never experienced sorrow?

1421
02:08:36,767 --> 02:08:38,246
Have they never lost anything?

1422
02:08:39,034 --> 02:08:43,141
Don't advise me.l can't
change the way you want me to.

1423
02:08:44,767 --> 02:08:47,611
So, there
is no meaning to our meeting?

1424
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:50,374
...my this face, me rescuing you?

1425
02:08:50,501 --> 02:08:52,606
What are you implying? A miracle?

1426
02:08:54,201 --> 02:08:57,011
Roshni, our life is a blank page.

1427
02:08:57,368 --> 02:08:59,507
A plain white page,
without even a line on it.

1428
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:03,381
What colours we put on it, what lines
we write on it are determined by us

1429
02:09:04,134 --> 02:09:05,738
That choice is what life is

1430
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,677
Other than than,
there is no miracle in this world.

1431
02:09:09,234 --> 02:09:11,009
- Preshrank!
- Don't.

1432
02:09:13,168 --> 02:09:14,408
I am sorry!

1433
02:09:15,134 --> 02:09:16,272
This is how I am

1434
02:09:16,734 --> 02:09:18,213
Don't try to change me.

1435
02:09:19,401 --> 02:09:20,709
I can't change!

1436
02:09:31,434 --> 02:09:33,072
Okay Mr Preshrank Roy.

1437
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:34,404
Just one more thing.

1438
02:09:35,301 --> 02:09:38,077
When half of you did with Elena,"

1439
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:40,647
...one half of Elena
remained inside you

1440
02:09:41,734 --> 02:09:44,340
And that is precisely
the value of your life.

1441
02:09:44,567 --> 02:09:46,137
Don't disrespect that value

1442
02:09:56,067 --> 02:09:57,375
Thanks for every thing

1443
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,111
You're right, there are no miracles

1444
02:10:09,267 --> 02:10:11,770
The stars never come down, on earth.

1445
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,211
I am leaving

1446
02:10:15,334 --> 02:10:20,010
For India.
'Ne will not meet... ever again.

1447
02:14:30,467 --> 02:14:31,343
Landed?

1448
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:34,702
Where are you bro?

1449
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,109
You first tell me if
Johnny has come with you.

1450
02:14:39,467 --> 02:14:40,775
The walking Johnny?

1451
02:14:41,034 --> 02:14:43,071
The black one is there,
as well as the blue one

1452
02:14:43,467 --> 02:14:45,071
What about the Johnny
that sways about?

1453
02:14:46,034 --> 02:14:49,311
â€œMy do you need a Johnny that sways
about? For that we have Sunnychayan".

1454
02:14:51,634 --> 02:14:52,612
Where are you?
Okay, I saw you. Come, come!

1455
02:14:54,701 --> 02:14:57,238
- Well, who is this?
- Who is this, man?

1456
02:14:57,734 --> 02:14:58,644
How was the journey?

1457
02:14:58,701 --> 02:14:59,577
Not bad at all!

1458
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:01,179
Sunnychyan,
is your driver free tomorrow.

1459
02:15:01,301 --> 02:15:02,507
- I need to go to Banglore, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1460
02:15:02,601 --> 02:15:03,511
Yeah right!

1461
02:15:03,701 --> 02:15:07,410
You come back after so many years and
you want to leave tomorrow, on Christmas

1462
02:15:07,501 --> 02:15:08,343
Forget the idea!

1463
02:15:08,434 --> 02:15:09,504
How is the family get together?

1464
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:12,171
Everybody from the smallest to the
biggest fish in the sea has arrived.

1465
02:15:12,334 --> 02:15:13,506
Even Baby Kunhjammas family
who had not come to the.

1466
02:15:13,601 --> 02:15:15,444
...Tharavad for the past
thirty years has made it...

1467
02:15:15,534 --> 02:15:17,343
You mean... Ottapalam? Yes.

1468
02:15:17,434 --> 02:15:18,071
Where is the car?

1469
02:15:19,334 --> 02:15:20,278
What's the level of your cholesterol?

1470
02:15:20,367 --> 02:15:20,777
In the blood?

1471
02:15:21,034 --> 02:15:21,603
Yes, in the blood

1472
02:15:21,701 --> 02:15:23,146
Must be lesser than
the level of alcohol.

1473
02:15:24,634 --> 02:15:25,977
Any other heart problems?

1474
02:15:26,634 --> 02:15:28,636
Public thinks that
I don't have such an organ.

1475
02:15:29,334 --> 02:15:31,473
What is it Sunny? Are you planning
to open a super specialty hospital?

1476
02:15:31,568 --> 02:15:34,640
When unexpected things happen, cardiac
arrest is a common fallout right?

1477
02:15:34,734 --> 02:15:37,044
Why? Are you planning to leave poor..

1478
02:15:37,134 --> 02:15:40,411
Deepa and marry
some eighteen year old?

1479
02:15:40,501 --> 02:15:44,711
You are going to give me a heart
attack by saying such wonderful things!

1480
02:15:59,101 --> 02:16:02,344
After the long time.
Back to Tharakan Villa

1481
02:16:03,568 --> 02:16:05,047
Oh, Achhayan?

1482
02:16:05,567 --> 02:16:06,671
Georgy, right?

1483
02:16:08,101 --> 02:16:10,172
Oh, Uncle, you look exactly the same!

1484
02:16:10,267 --> 02:16:11,541
But you have aged too much!

1485
02:16:12,767 --> 02:16:14,405
Recognize this goth? Tinku

1486
02:16:14,501 --> 02:16:15,172
- Tinku?
- Yes, Tinku!

1487
02:16:15,501 --> 02:16:18,004
You take these away and keep it safe.

1488
02:16:18,101 --> 02:16:19,512
...If your Simon Uncle sees this,"

1489
02:16:19,601 --> 02:16:21,080
...nothing will be left
not even the bottle caps.

1490
02:16:21,267 --> 02:16:22,245
Oh and if you find you
can't control yourself..

1491
02:16:22,334 --> 02:16:23,540
...go ahead, and have a peg or two!

1492
02:16:23,668 --> 02:16:26,012
And, don't fill water in it,
to keep the level up

1493
02:16:26,201 --> 02:16:28,340
I have always had an allergy when
water is poured into it, right Sunny?

1494
02:16:28,434 --> 02:16:30,573
We are not going to open this at all.

1495
02:16:30,634 --> 02:16:31,476
We will open after you'll come.

1496
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:32,778
Oh, it's going to be a boozing session.

1497
02:16:33,167 --> 02:16:35,443
Kid; but they are
worse drinkers than we are!

1498
02:16:38,001 --> 02:16:39,742
Nothing has changed...
The house the people in it...

1499
02:16:40,201 --> 02:16:42,477
Everybody and everything has changed

1500
02:16:42,734 --> 02:16:44,543
Maybe it's because only you are just
the same.

1501
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:46,170
Look, who is here!

1502
02:16:46,268 --> 02:16:47,440
Hey, Maple!

1503
02:16:47,534 --> 02:16:50,708
Oh my dear Christ! Have you
managed to bring this fellow over too?

1504
02:16:51,201 --> 02:16:52,441
What is the use of you coming now?

1505
02:16:52,534 --> 02:16:54,241
The bars have all closed. Isn't it?

1506
02:16:54,334 --> 02:16:55,972
The bars have all
become beer parlours anyway.

1507
02:16:56,334 --> 02:16:57,779
Doesn't matter if you don't open it.

1508
02:16:58,034 --> 02:16:59,138
After all you are here

1509
02:16:59,234 --> 02:17:00,212
Where are you going with this?

1510
02:17:00,601 --> 02:17:03,741
Let me take this to them.
Our old place only... open air.

1511
02:17:04,234 --> 02:17:06,646
When they see you,
they will all get ajolt!

1512
02:17:07,601 --> 02:17:08,671
Come fast, come fast!

1513
02:17:18,767 --> 02:17:19,609
E-
E

1514
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:22,010
Oh. You have come?

1515
02:17:22,467 --> 02:17:24,538
Will I not come here
to see Grand Mother?

1516
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:29,171
You are still the ï¬‚atterer.
So what news of Queen Elizabeth.

1517
02:17:29,301 --> 02:17:31,338
Do you still visit the palace?

1518
02:17:31,434 --> 02:17:34,005
I stopped doing that. Now and then
the Queen comes to visit me instead.

1519
02:17:34,134 --> 02:17:35,238
Oh, is that so?

1520
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,211
Oh there you are!

1521
02:17:38,367 --> 02:17:40,438
I was wondering where
Miss Kunamkulam had gone

1522
02:17:40,701 --> 02:17:42,510
Where will I go? I am here only.

1523
02:17:42,601 --> 02:17:44,205
Aren't you participating
in the Christmas celebrations

1524
02:17:44,301 --> 02:17:46,406
Don't you know how
things work in Kerala?

1525
02:17:47,268 --> 02:17:48,611
Here, what is festivity?

1526
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:51,146
It just means a lot of drinking for the
men and kitchen work for the women!

1527
02:17:51,801 --> 02:17:53,974
What is your problem now?
Men drinking?

1528
02:17:54,101 --> 02:17:55,409
A
a

1529
02:17:55,467 --> 02:17:58,505
That I don't need. You just come and
do some work in the kitchen instead?

1530
02:17:58,667 --> 02:18:00,237
So many of them have come

1531
02:18:00,334 --> 02:18:02,177
After the tharavad is demolished

1532
02:18:02,267 --> 02:18:02,745
then we won't be here
to celebrate Christmas.

1533
02:18:03,001 --> 02:18:04,503
So, let's think of it as Nostalgic.

1534
02:18:04,601 --> 02:18:06,103
Everyone together;

1535
02:18:06,267 --> 02:18:08,338
Celebrating their last Christmas.

1536
02:18:08,601 --> 02:18:10,478
Don't say last. Look there, can't you see?

1537
02:18:10,534 --> 02:18:12,741
Come let's go to the room.

1538
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,502
Everything is as old as it was

1539
02:18:14,601 --> 02:18:15,579
I have kept the bag inside

1540
02:18:15,667 --> 02:18:16,611
Get freshened up! go!

1541
02:18:16,701 --> 02:18:17,577
Okay, then.

1542
02:18:18,001 --> 02:18:19,503
Oh, grandmother, she is on F. B?

1543
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:34,238
Hope nothing happened to your heart.

1544
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:35,504
Stunned? Shocked right?

1545
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:38,207
Doesn't she look exactly like eleena?

1546
02:20:42,034 --> 02:20:42,535
Who is this?

1547
02:20:43,367 --> 02:20:45,608
This is the one I was talking about,
late baby kunjammas daughter'.

1548
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,441
Come. I will introduce! Come.

1549
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,502
Roshni, this is Preshrank

1550
02:21:04,401 --> 02:21:04,776
Hi.

1551
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,074
Hi.

1552
02:21:06,267 --> 02:21:08,679
Roshni works with TCS.
She was in London before this.

1553
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:10,977
Oh What project were you working on?

1554
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:13,372
Human Rescue Operation.

1555
02:21:13,701 --> 02:21:17,478
I was creating a software
to rescue people who get into danger.

1556
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:19,772
What do you do Preshrank?

1557
02:21:20,601 --> 02:21:25,016
Hospitality services. I show the
country to the people who come there.

1558
02:21:25,234 --> 02:21:26,611
- Achayyan. -Yes
- Please come here!

1559
02:21:28,034 --> 02:21:30,173
Okay. You guys talk.
I will come right now. Come!

1560
02:21:34,767 --> 02:21:36,075
You knew everything Isn't it?

1561
02:21:37,534 --> 02:21:40,572
No. I came to know of it only after
I came here. But, I wasn't surprised.

1562
02:21:42,167 --> 02:21:44,340
But I did not expect it.

1563
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:48,006
My beliefs were true

1564
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:50,204
What?

1565
02:21:51,367 --> 02:21:52,437
Whatever happened,

1566
02:21:52,534 --> 02:21:53,512
In my life.

1567
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:54,738
Had a reason.

1568
02:21:56,467 --> 02:21:57,571
You imagine things
that don't even exist

1569
02:21:57,667 --> 02:21:59,203
What for?

1570
02:22:00,067 --> 02:22:01,102
Can be made to imagine

1571
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:02,577
It can only cause more pain
and heart brakes.

1572
02:22:03,434 --> 02:22:05,539
You wanted to put an end to all the pain;

1573
02:22:06,134 --> 02:22:07,704
...by taking a decision to end your life,

1574
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:09,006
In front of that train,

1575
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:10,170
...that day?

1576
02:22:12,467 --> 02:22:14,378
I had found myself and
my happiness in that pain.

1577
02:22:14,467 --> 02:22:16,242
Because,

1578
02:22:17,467 --> 02:22:18,502
It was in that pain and sadness,

1579
02:22:18,601 --> 02:22:20,478
that Eleena was with me

1580
02:22:23,134 --> 02:22:24,272
It was not out of fear or scare

1581
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,273
I felt it would be fun
to explore certain death

1582
02:22:28,001 --> 02:22:29,173
And that is when you...

1583
02:22:29,767 --> 02:22:33,078
Yes. Like a miracle

1584
02:22:34,634 --> 02:22:37,706
Roshni, let's put an end to this, now.

1585
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:41,236
That day what you said was spot on

1586
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:45,044
We should not have met... ever.

1587
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:48,573
Yeah You do whatever you feel like

1588
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:50,509
You can decide to walk into the lives
of those who dint want you in their lives.

1589
02:22:51,434 --> 02:22:53,607
Then you can abandon them on the roads

1590
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:56,003
Once again you will walk back straight
into their lives with a sorry

1591
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:59,076
And when you are done you will walk out
of their lives giving hundred reasons.

1592
02:23:00,267 --> 02:23:01,245
But,

1593
02:23:02,167 --> 02:23:03,612
you love me.

1594
02:23:04,634 --> 02:23:06,045
And, that's a fact.

1595
02:23:08,167 --> 02:23:09,237
It is impossible

1596
02:23:11,434 --> 02:23:13,471
Yeah, I was just a shadow,

1597
02:23:13,567 --> 02:23:15,046
Eleenas shadow.

1598
02:23:15,134 --> 02:23:16,238
Wthout a mind,

1599
02:23:16,333 --> 02:23:17,641
Without a body,

1600
02:23:17,734 --> 02:23:19,213
'Without a soul.

1601
02:23:19,367 --> 02:23:20,710
A worthless

1602
02:23:21,234 --> 02:23:22,269
Shadow.

1603
02:23:23,167 --> 02:23:25,044
For me it was always about eleena.

1604
02:23:26,067 --> 02:23:27,546
When I met you,

1605
02:23:27,667 --> 02:23:29,203
I only had Eelina in my heart.

1606
02:23:30,467 --> 02:23:32,105
Then I wandered.

1607
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:33,472
Searching all over my world.

1608
02:23:34,267 --> 02:23:36,543
My coming here is a continuum
of the same search.

1609
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:40,740
If you are still searching for Eleena,

1610
02:23:41,001 --> 02:23:42,105
Whom did eleena show to you?

1611
02:23:42,201 --> 02:23:43,271
Wham is she trying to tell you?

1612
02:23:43,367 --> 02:23:44,607
Who is that...

1613
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:46,373
Person?

1614
02:23:53,734 --> 02:23:56,044
What is the answer
that Eleena is giving you?
