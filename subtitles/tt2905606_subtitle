00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,938
'I dedicate my 50
years in film industry..'

2
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:32,376
'..to my beloved friend,
who is a part of my family..'

3
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:35,240
'..Sahasa Simha, Vishnu Vardhana..'

4
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,876
'..Dwarakish.'

5
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:45,016
Vishnu Vardhana!

6
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,218
Vishnu Vardhana!

7
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,445
Hello?

8
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:50,950
Hello? Yes?

9
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,557
But where?

10
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,289
I don't know.

11
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:09,306
Darling, where are you?
I want to meet you.

12
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,736
'Everyone has a phone and
they are always on the phone.'

13
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,842
'When India's population
is 120 crores..'

14
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,975
'..the number of
phones are 160 crores.'

15
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,720
'Every individual
carries 2 to 3 phones.'

16
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:28,459
'A phone can describe everything
about the owner in a jiffy.'

17
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,129
'Look, how seriously
they are talking.'

18
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,491
'I wonder what's
there to talk so much.'

19
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,261
'I wonder how people
used to make a living..

20
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,199
..before cell phones
were invested.'

21
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,737
'Start the film. Who are you?'

22
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,769
'Sir, I'm the director.'

23
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:44,173
'But you are talking something
which is irrelevant.'

24
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:46,608
'Sir, it is relevant.'

25
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:50,911
'There is a relevancy between what
I'm about to say and this film.'

26
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:53,645
'I will say one last
thing and leave. Please.'

27
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,686
'Alright.'

28
00:03:54,754 --> 00:04:00,522
'Check if you have your phones
in your respective pockets.'

29
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,784
'Sir, start the film.'

30
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:09,518
What are you doing?

31
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,964
You advised me not
to befriend Adishesha..

32
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,759
..but I didn't listen to you.

33
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,664
He after me now.

34
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:18,735
He will kill me.

35
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:21,671
The government is in your hands.
Nothing will happen to you.

36
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,901
Don't be afraid.

37
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,307
Adishesha is a dangerous man.

38
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,908
His men have reached our home.

39
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:34,176
If they get me, they will
torture me and set me on fire.

40
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,611
Forgive me.

41
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,923
Forgive me.

42
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,356
What are you doing? - Forgive me.

43
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,551
No.

44
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,050
Wait.

45
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,496
Stop pretending now.

46
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:22,095
Tell Adishesha that there
is an end to everything.

47
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:23,766
God is watching everything.

48
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:24,961
He is.

49
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:26,330
Vishnu!

50
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,900
Vishnu!

51
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,769
Vishnu!

52
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:36,576
Vishnu!

53
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,776
Vishnu!

54
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,045
Vishnu!

55
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:49,287
Vishnu Vardhana!

56
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:22,390
Hello, sir.

57
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:28,323
I know who you are but
you don't know me. - Fire!

58
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,062
Who is it? What's the matter?

59
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,367
Move aside. - Sit down.

60
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:38,507
So you are drinking here?
- Who are you?

61
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:40,770
Look, I don't know
you and you don't know me..

62
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,336
..but let me tell you something.

63
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:45,644
Even my boss on the
screen doesn't like people..

64
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,844
..who create ruckus
in the public place..

65
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,617
with women and children around.

66
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,657
So I would ask you to
handover the bottles to me..

67
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:55,353
..and after the film is
over I will give it back to you.

68
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,428
What do you say?

69
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,788
What if we don't?

70
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,629
Don't think that my boss..

71
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:07,066
..on the screen has
made only sentimental films.

72
00:08:07,873 --> 00:08:11,775
He has also made action
and commercial films.

73
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,172
And if you don't understand
sentimental dialogues..

74
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,538
..I will have to explain
to you with action. Should I?

75
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,849
Who is he?

76
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,617
Vishnu.

77
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:23,655
Vishnu Vardhana.

78
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,384
You will not become your
boss by having a similar name.

79
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,220
Is it possible?

80
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:34,057
I can't be him but
since I've been an actors..

81
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,097
..I've achieved a certain position.

82
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:38,532
I might do even better
with his blessings.

83
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:39,696
What's your problem?

84
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:40,966
Let's do one thing.

85
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:44,202
Even boss has told not to create
ruckus when there are women around.

86
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,311
So let's change the location.
What do you say?

87
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:49,039
Look there.

88
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,095
How did you get there?

89
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,024
Not just me but
all of you are there.

90
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,736
Take a good look.

91
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:02,841
Hey.

92
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:05,748
How dare you create ruckus
coming to my boss's film..

93
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:06,842
..as he is no more.

94
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,453
So what if he is dead?

95
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:13,490
He still lives in the
hearts of many people.

96
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,886
Not only in the theatre..

97
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:22,063
..in bars or pubs or bus
station or market or in colleges..

98
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:25,035
..if you create ruckus in
the place when women are around..

99
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:30,234
..fans like me will thrash
you death. Be careful.

100
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,341
If I have to say it in English..

101
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,205
..be careful.

102
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,145
Am I right?

103
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,929
Sir, greetings. - Greetings.

104
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:02,337
Sir, greetings.

105
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:03,739
Sir, greetings. - Greetings.

106
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,736
Where is Vishnu?

107
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:07,206
Hurry up.

108
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:10,777
My friend,
your auspicious period has begun.

109
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,783
Really? - Vishnu.

110
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:16,185
I knew you would be here.

111
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,120
Sir. - Listen to him. - Be quiet.

112
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:22,087
Vishnu, your father
has become old now.

113
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:26,124
It is you who has to handle
my business after I die.

114
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,389
What business?

115
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:32,798
The apartment with 24 double
bedroom flats in Kalyan Nagar.

116
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,169
Apartment with 48
single bedroom flats.

117
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:41,411
And the bungalows with 5
bedrooms built on 50 by 80 sites.

118
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,812
You have to handle
everything from tomorrow.

119
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,612
I don't want any of them,
keep them for yourself.

120
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:51,150
When your father is giving
them to you why are you refusing?

121
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:55,488
He is talking about them.

122
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,217
This is Jai Mahal palace.

123
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:58,790
This is Lalit Mahal palace.

124
00:12:58,897 --> 00:12:59,955
And this laundry business.

125
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:03,297
And since the laundry
man in Kalyan Nagar died..

126
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,337
..he wants me to go
there and iron clothes.

127
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,531
I will not do it.

128
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:09,897
First fill the pipe with tobacco.

129
00:13:09,975 --> 00:13:11,602
He is wearing coat taken on rent.

130
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,942
Don't talk about my coat.

131
00:13:14,313 --> 00:13:18,409
The coat was a compliment given
by my customer for my good work.

132
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,145
Do what you please,
don't ask me to do your work.

133
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,580
Moreover,
you yell at me before people.

134
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:24,485
You tarnish my image.

135
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:27,150
What's wrong in
helping your father?

136
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:28,419
Uncle, be quiet. Do not interfere.

137
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:31,486
Let me tell you something. I will
not handle the laundry business.

138
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:34,327
I earn my daily bread
through the laundry business.

139
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,765
Mr. Puttu,
everything has changed now.

140
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:39,497
If you don't know, I will tell you.

141
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:40,795
Tell him.

142
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:41,964
Tell him everything.

143
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,873
His auspicious
period has now begun.

144
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,774
You should be thrashed first.

145
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:48,412
You spoilt my son.

146
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,572
What's it about him?

147
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:51,973
His horoscope is
similar to Lord Indra's.

148
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:57,515
His horoscope is similar
to renowned actor Vishnu Vardhana.

149
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,923
His horoscope is similar
to Manmatha, the most handsome man.

150
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,157
His horoscope is
similar to Bill Gates's.

151
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:12,931
He will rule the entire country.

152
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,416
"My only desire is I
want to become a millionaire."

153
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:33,254
"I want a small house
like Mysore palace."

154
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,418
"There is no tax for desires."

155
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,928
"There is no fine for dreams."

156
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:42,865
"There is no one who
can question me. I'm a king."

157
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,130
"One, two, three, Vishnu Vardhana."

158
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,229
"I'm the king of Karnataka."

159
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,739
"I'm the king of romance."

160
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,673
"Remember that."

161
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:54,569
"One, two, three, Vishnu Vardhana."

162
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,876
"I'm the king of Karnataka."

163
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:59,280
"I'm the king of romance."

164
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:01,079
"Remember that."

165
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:25,404
"I'm for money. There's
nothing better than money, honey."

166
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,808
"World is spinning on money,
money."

167
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:45,189
"The great men who made
money saying it is everything."

168
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:50,257
"People who don't have
money said money is God."

169
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:57,006
"I don't go after
money like others."

170
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,703
"I will not wait for
money to come to me."

171
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,940
"I'm unique and my style too."

172
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,283
"My way is unique."

173
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:14,121
"I'm a fan of boss Vishnu.
I will follow his footsteps."

174
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:18,754
"Look at lion's
footprints on his path."

175
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,128
"One, two, three, Vishnu Vardhana."

176
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,428
"I'm the king of Karnataka."

177
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:25,800
"I'm the king of romance."

178
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:27,599
"Remember that."

179
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:31,574
"Vishnu,
here comes Vishnu Vardhana."

180
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:41,216
"Vishnu,
here comes Vishnu Vardhana."

181
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,685
"Here comes the snake dance."

182
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:47,316
"One, two, three, four."

183
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:11,339
"Goddess of money doesn't heed
anybody's advice to make someone rich."

184
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:16,012
"She would come whenever
you think of her."

185
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,387
"Even though I'm
poor I will dream big."

186
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:28,058
"I lead my life as
per Abdul Kalam's ethics."

187
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,504
"Life is large only
if you think it is short."

188
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:40,238
"Desires are small if
you think they are large."

189
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:45,146
"I'm a king by my name itself."

190
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:49,847
"My only desire is I
want to become a millionaire."

191
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:54,517
"I want a small house
like Mysore palace."

192
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,953
"There is no tax for desires."

193
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:59,462
"There is no fine for dreams."

194
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:04,230
"There is no one who
can question me. I'm a king."

195
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,463
"One, two, three, Vishnu Vardhana."

196
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,904
"I'm the king of Karnataka."

197
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,135
"I'm the king of romance."

198
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:13,109
"Remember that."

199
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,791
"Shake your body."

200
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:33,164
"Move your body."

201
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,612
I'm Valli for the one
who tries to flirt with me.

202
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:53,141
And Nagavalli for the
one who pull my plaits.

203
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,384
"Shake your body."

204
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,752
Valli!
- Shut up.

205
00:18:57,856 --> 00:19:00,154
Uncle, why don't you buy a phone?

206
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:02,692
I must come crossing
four lanes for clothes.

207
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,523
What will happen to my body?

208
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,256
Say it again, Valli.

209
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,026
He refuses to buy me
a phone worth Rs. 10,000.

210
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,660
Why don't you buy him a phone?
- I'm a mere laundry man.

211
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,363
I can only afford to
buy you phone worth Rs. 1000.

212
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,667
Hello. Discuss things later.

213
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,971
Deliver these ironed
clothes to the Colonel.

214
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:22,505
I didn't go because I'm drunk.

215
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:23,741
Vishnu.
- Yes?

216
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:25,180
Come here, son.

217
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,411
Deliver these clothes
to the Colonel.

218
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,849
I can't do it.

219
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,479
Stop it.
- Son, help your father.

220
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,684
You are unbelievable, father.

221
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,522
Uncle, what's this? - Local rum.

222
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,227
I drink rum.
- Okay.

223
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:39,820
Can I have some?
- Go ahead.

224
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:42,093
Take it.
- You drink, Valli?

225
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:47,097
I will give up drinking
if you marry me.

226
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:50,641
Drink the whole bottle.
- Valli, will you marry me?

227
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,133
What are you doing, Vishnu?

228
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:54,940
I can't take the clothes like this.

229
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:58,612
If I take the clothes packed,
people will think it is a gift.

230
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:02,414
Very few people in our locality know
that I'm the son of a laundry man.

231
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,654
What about the rest?

232
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:05,952
They think that I
run an iron business.

233
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:07,615
Nobody asks me which iron.

234
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:11,860
Thank you.

235
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,236
Is everybody dead?

236
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,364
Hello?

237
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm here with the laundry clothes.

238
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:27,841
Keep it there.

239
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,292
This is great.

240
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,967
Hey.

241
00:20:58,577 --> 00:20:59,805
Come on.

242
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:06,182
Your auspicious
period has now begun.

243
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:10,114
The time has come where
you will meet your life partner.

244
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:11,749
When your girl comes..

245
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,882
..there will be no music
but only mantras will be heard.

246
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,658
I'm coming, sister.

247
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:20,591
Bharati.

248
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,394
Not from the heaven or earth..

249
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:27,164
..but she will come down
like an angel, my friend.

250
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:29,763
There will be rain of flowers.

251
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:48,055
The moment you see her, all
your desires will get fulfilled.

252
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,863
Vishnu, what's happened?
What's the matter?

253
00:22:01,606 --> 00:22:02,868
Relax.

254
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,169
Relax. - What is it?

255
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,836
Check if the girl named
Bharati will match me.

256
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:08,036
Hurry.

257
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,811
Bharati, Vishnu, Vishnu, Bharati.

258
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:12,778
This is the bond of births.

259
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,409
It is your wife's name.

260
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:16,511
Are you sure? - Of course.

261
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:18,350
Will she be mine?
- Of course, my friend.

262
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,219
Father. - Yes, son?

263
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,280
Father.

264
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,157
I found a wonderful daughter-in-law
for you, father. - Where?

265
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:26,964
I'm sitting right before him.

266
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,928
Doesn't he know that?

267
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,965
Valli, I'm not talking about you.

268
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:33,401
I'd been to Colonel's
house to deliver the clothes.

269
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,163
I saw his daughter, father.
- Really?

270
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,232
She is four months pregnant.

271
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:40,140
She is here for the delivery.

272
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:41,473
I know, Valli.

273
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,377
I'm talking about her
younger sister, Bharati.

274
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:50,648
She is as fresh as a silk
sari after you wash it with petrol.

275
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:53,449
Bharati completed her
education in America..

276
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:55,988
..and came here just last week.

277
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:59,086
Tomorrow, she will be
going to meet Surya Prakash..

278
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,667
..the MD of Hospital Mallige
without her own knowledge.

279
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:07,263
If she likes the doctor..

280
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:10,702
..she will marry him for sure.

281
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:14,438
Vishnu, you will have to marry me.

282
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:17,538
Vishnu, she is right.

283
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:21,115
If she has kept a
renowned doctor waiting..

284
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,618
..what about you,
we are poor people.

285
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:24,120
Be quiet, Blackie.

286
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:27,147
She wants to marry only a doctor,
right? - That's right.

287
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,292
Which hospital is Bharati going to?

288
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:40,731
Doctor, I ironed your
coat and kept it here.

289
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,966
I don't know who took it away.

290
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:54,709
Come.

291
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,150
Compounder? - Yes, doctor?

292
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:58,145
She is coming. - She is coming.

293
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,323
Is everything ready?
- Everything is ready.

294
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,218
Doctor! - What are you doing?

295
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,694
Doctor.

296
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,224
Doctor!

297
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:12,166
Stop him.

298
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:15,996
Somebody stop this.

299
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:18,097
Doctor!

300
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,770
Being a doctor, I'm coming down
on a stretcher for the first time.

301
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:21,912
Get down.

302
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,880
Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

303
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:25,876
Shall I arrange for the treatment?

304
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:28,214
Bring the patient..
- No, no. I'm all right.

305
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:29,249
Are you sure? - Yes.

306
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,947
Is that the way
you fall on his feet?

307
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,721
I'm sorry, doctor. - No.

308
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:34,347
I couldn't control my emotions.

309
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:39,761
You sutured such a big
hole in my heart, doctor.

310
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,598
You gave me a new life.

311
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:44,627
There's Rs. 5000.

312
00:24:44,736 --> 00:24:47,102
Be careful with the money.
Take him. - Thank you.

313
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:49,367
You are supposed to pay him only
Rs. 300. - Take him to the room.

314
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,931
Next! - Doctor! - Yes? - Doctor!

315
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:58,107
Ma'am, your husband
saved my child and me.

316
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:01,583
May God bless you
with a child soon.

317
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:05,017
Doctor, please name my child.

318
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:07,783
First of all, we are not married.

319
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,358
I don't even know her. You..

320
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:12,429
I'm getting angry.
- Never mind, doctor.

321
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:13,828
She's innocent.

322
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,024
Name this child.

323
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,225
You are such a nice girl.

324
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:19,494
Name.. - Give him
your favorite name.

325
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,969
My only favorite name
ever since my childhood..

326
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:23,199
..is Bharati.

327
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:24,969
Say it three times in the ears.
- I see.

328
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,178
Not in her ears,
in the child's ears.

329
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:29,941
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:33,450
Bharati. Bharati. Bharati.

331
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,552
Take your child. - Here you are.

332
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:41,488
Wait. I want to give
a token to the child.

333
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:47,157
Doctor, it's worth Rs. 50,000.
- But the child is priceless.

334
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,196
Never mind. Be quiet. - Don't cry.

335
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,359
Take it.

336
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,934
Be careful with the chain.
You may go. - Next!

337
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,234
You are not a doctor.

338
00:25:57,342 --> 00:25:59,207
I can swear on anyone.
- Be careful.

339
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,344
You are not a doctor. - What?

340
00:26:01,713 --> 00:26:08,846
You are the God who saved my life.

341
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:10,981
You are my deity. - He scared me.

342
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:13,023
You are my deity, doctor.

343
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:17,519
Why did you let him
come down three floors?

344
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:20,621
Not three floors, I jumped
from the thirteenth floor..

345
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,529
..and no doctor could treat me.

346
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:27,933
Whereas you operated
me and saved my life, doctor.

347
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:30,802
You are the best doctor ever.

348
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,342
I performed operation for free.

349
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,241
Doctor. - Do one thing.

350
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,540
Give him sleeping pills and
put him to sleep. - Okay, doctor.

351
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:38,181
He looks like Puttiah's son.

352
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:40,612
Why would Puttiah's
son wear a doctor's attire?

353
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:42,448
Doctor. - Slowly.

354
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:47,752
He wasn't in the scene?

355
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,520
You are Puttiah's son..

356
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:54,564
Doctor Puttiah? - No.

357
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:55,860
He's upstairs, take him.

358
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,161
Actually.. - Go with him.

359
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,200
He's upstairs, go. - Oh, my God.

360
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,763
By the way,
do you have any problem?

361
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,472
Let me check. - No.

362
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,102
Everything is normal.
- I was actually here..

363
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,772
You are here to meet someone?
- Yes. - I guessed.

364
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:14,541
Sorry. - Are you a
gynecologist or neurologist..

365
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:15,745
..or cardiologist?

366
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,116
Let's walk and talk. - Okay.

367
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,282
Come on.

368
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:22,618
I will tell you something.

369
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:24,261
When there are different
kinds of patients here..

370
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:26,729
..we must not treat
just one or two patients..

371
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,059
..but treat everyone.

372
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,428
So I have a hand in everything.

373
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,091
I didn't understand?

374
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,529
I myself didn't understand.

375
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,898
By the way, do you know Dr.
Surya Prakash?

376
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:39,108
No. Why? - I will tell you, come.

377
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,279
It is I who perform all the
major operations in this hospital.

378
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:47,849
Oh. - But he gains fame and money.

379
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:50,646
Basically, it is only fame
and money that is important to him.

380
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:52,352
For me, it is passion.

381
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:56,252
I feel so proud about you.

382
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:58,185
What is your name?

383
00:27:58,896 --> 00:27:59,954
Vishnu Vardhana.

384
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,731
Oh. - Dr. Vishnu Vardhana.

385
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,267
Your visiting card?

386
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:07,232
Basically,
I don't keep visiting cards.

387
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:09,170
Because I have no idea
how many times I visit.

388
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:10,672
At least phone number?

389
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,266
I don't have a phone too.

390
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:15,107
Because I get calls while
performing operations..

391
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:17,647
..and that disturbs
the patient. - Oh.

392
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:20,411
When I'm checking the
patient I get messages..

393
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:21,543
..and that disturbs
the patient again.

394
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:23,882
I think no doctor
should carry phone.

395
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,614
Yes. - One second.

396
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,458
This is my card.

397
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,489
Bharati. - Yes? - Bharati?

398
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:34,724
The name on the card.
- Your favorite name.

399
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:39,369
Such a coincidence.

400
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,371
Call me when you are free.
- Sure, I will

401
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:46,167
Hello. You were here
to meet someone. Shall I..?

402
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:49,572
I met him.

403
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,236
Who is he? Are you blind?

404
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,739
You entered through the
exit gate and you blame me?

405
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:23,713
I'm already in anger, get going.

406
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:27,683
Hello. I'm showing
respect and you..

407
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:31,216
You think I will get
scared if you show me sword?

408
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,587
You think I will get scared
if you get down from the car?

409
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:35,182
Get going. - Where to?

410
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:37,750
Hey. - Hey.
- Hey. - Hey.

411
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:39,295
What's going on?

412
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:40,863
You see that?

413
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,957
For the first time the
police has arrived on time.

414
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,466
He would've hacked me if
you were a little late, uncle.

415
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,799
Come. Look, he is creating
nuisance in the public place.

416
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:47,734
File a case against him.

417
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,466
Come to the police station.

418
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:51,636
You are great, uncle.

419
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,710
You arrested them
when they were armed.

420
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,440
You will be in the paper tomorrow.

421
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,572
You will get promoted
for sure, uncle.

422
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,050
It is all because of you,
Vishnu Vardhana.

423
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:07,683
By the way, they are
acting so smart. Who are they?

424
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:09,885
They say that they
are Adishesha's men.

425
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:15,295
They say that whenever
they get arrested.

426
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,769
Adishesha? Who is he, uncle?

427
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:27,140
The one who committed 20 murders,
several kidnaps.

428
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:29,771
But not a single case
has been filed against him.

429
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:33,280
You are a bravo. You dared
to file a complaint. You are great.

430
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:42,988
But you're not sure that
they are Adishesha's men, are you?

431
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:44,989
Probably, they are his men.

432
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,996
Nevertheless,
I will file a complaint.

433
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,428
I have an urgent work to do.

434
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:52,964
Until you type the letter I
will go and be right back. - Okay.

435
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,334
Who is in the police station?

436
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:58,039
Here he is.

437
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:06,544
What time is it now?
What are you doing here?

438
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:07,877
Go.

439
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:09,512
I asked them to
go to the hospital..

440
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,144
..but they've come
to the police station.

441
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:13,615
Are you out of your mind?

442
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,483
We thought your men were lying.

443
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,791
Who hit my men?

444
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,293
Who is he?
Tell me. No one should confront me.

445
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:28,634
People fear me whereas
that guy got my men arrested.

446
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:33,536
Bring him to me.

447
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,837
I will take off his
clothes and hack him to death.

448
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:41,044
He's an innocent guy.
He didn't know about you.

449
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,480
He already left.

450
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:48,950
How many are there in
the police station? - Four.

451
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,117
What's the total strength
of this police station? - 24.

452
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:58,195
I liked the way you feared
me when I was hitting my men.

453
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,925
Phoolchand. - Who is it?

454
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:26,595
What do you want? - I want you.

455
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:42,970
Our men would've finished
their job by now, isn't it?

456
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,612
Why didn't Wahab call me yet?

457
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,916
I don't find my phone?

458
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:51,546
Check in the car.

459
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:54,888
"Game."

460
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:57,319
"Play the game."

461
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:59,386
"Game."

462
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:01,124
"Play the game."

463
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:04,529
"Game."

464
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:08,361
"Play the game."

465
00:33:08,472 --> 00:33:09,564
"The king.."

466
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:13,103
Hello. Boss Adishesha?

467
00:33:14,512 --> 00:33:15,410
Yes.

468
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,538
Wahad here calling from Chennai.

469
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:21,613
Boss, your men finished
Phoolchand in the hospital.

470
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:23,846
I received the information.

471
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:28,690
The deal amount Rs.
50 lakhs is ready in Hotel Savera..

472
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:31,486
..on table no.
J-17. Go and pick it up.

473
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,165
Coming.

474
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,724
Tell me a code word.

475
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,027
Code word?

476
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,432
Boss, my man doesn't know you.

477
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,871
Please tell me a code word.

478
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,838
Code word..

479
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:50,705
Code?

480
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,819
Ding Ding Digana..

481
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,415
Ding Ding Digana..

482
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:03,851
Dang Dang Dagana.

483
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:06,294
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

484
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,525
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

485
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,964
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

486
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,593
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

487
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:15,501
Call my cell.
It must be somewhere around.

488
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:17,768
"Game."

489
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,208
Boss, your phone is ringing
but it is not around.

490
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,944
You might've dropped it when you
were after Ranga in Kalasipalya.

491
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,711
Raju, it must be in the place
where I thrashed Ranga. - Okay.

492
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:28,614
Find it. - Okay, boss.

493
00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:29,846
Call Wahab.

494
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,279
Sorry, boss. His number is busy.

495
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,119
He usually comes to this place..

496
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,451
..and pays the money after
the deal is over, isn't it?

497
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:37,551
Yes, he came here the
last time to pay the money.

498
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:39,426
Come.

499
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:44,191
"Whoever the money belongs to,
you must think it is yours."

500
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,633
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

501
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:49,171
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

502
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,768
"No matter what the source is just
count the money and keep it with you."

503
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:56,210
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

504
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,612
"Ding Ding Digana,
Dang Dang Dagana."

505
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:03,445
"The one who can hide
the money found for free..

506
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:07,490
..has never been born yet."

507
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:10,890
"Money never lasts forever."

508
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:16,063
"You must make money
until your last breathe."

509
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:22,668
"Whoever the money belongs to,
you must think it is yours."

510
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,439
"No matter what the source is just
count the money and keep it with you."

511
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:10,416
"I'm a simple beauty."

512
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:12,683
"You all are welcome."

513
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,282
"Can I know why you are late?"

514
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:22,330
"Stand aside and
look into my eyes..

515
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:25,960
..and then come closer to me."

516
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,899
"I'm your beloved."

517
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:36,376
"You are my man."

518
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:40,213
"I'm made for you."

519
00:36:41,252 --> 00:36:45,848
"Nobody drops me home."

520
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:51,591
"Whoever the money belongs to,
you must think it is yours."

521
00:36:51,695 --> 00:36:56,359
"No matter what the source is just
count the money and keep it with you."

522
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:52,818
Boss, Wahab sir is on line.
- Wahab? - Yes.

523
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,653
Hello? - Hello, brother Adi.

524
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:56,056
Hello? - Brother Adi.

525
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,122
Hello? Wahab, one minute.
I'll just come out.

526
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,893
I'm in the club.
There's a lot of noise here.

527
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,331
Just one minute. One minute.

528
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,926
So, did you take the money?
- Not yet, Wahab.

529
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,335
My phone has gone missing.
I called for the payment.

530
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,068
What are you saying?
I personally spoke to you on phone.

531
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,110
No Wahab, I'm telling you
that my phone has gone missing.

532
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:17,613
Wasn't it you who gave
me the code word? - Code word?

533
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:19,308
Which code word?

534
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,479
Ding ding digana..
- Dang dang dagana..

535
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,778
Where's the money? - Who are you?

536
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:52,604
Hey! - Where's the money?

537
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:53,650
He took it.

538
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,219
Goddess Lakshmi, save me.

539
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,424
Son, what is this?
New box, new lock.

540
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:10,626
What's the matter?
- Have I kept Rs. 50 lakhs in it?

541
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:12,669
What? - I've kept
my horoscope in it.

542
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:15,466
What's the matter, you are
showing so much love towards me?

543
00:39:15,773 --> 00:39:17,400
Blackie, why are you saying so?

544
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:21,271
Will you iron four clothes for me?
Do it with love.

545
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,710
Blackie? - Son, please do it.
Please do it.

546
00:39:22,913 --> 00:39:24,972
Blackie, where are you going?
- I'll go and have two pegs.

547
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:28,576
"You play a game."

548
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:32,017
"You play a game and see."

549
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:36,189
"You play a game."

550
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:44,930
"You play it."

551
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:49,165
Hello?

552
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:51,567
Hello?

553
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:54,204
Hello?
- Hello?

554
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:59,011
Who is it? - Sir, you called
me and you are asking me who I am.

555
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:03,315
This is 9916202429, isn't it?
- Is it?

556
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:07,956
Sir, I swear on my father,
I don't know which number is this.

557
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,256
You are talking on phone,
don't you know the number?

558
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:12,659
Boss, this phone is not mine.

559
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,756
That phone belongs to me.
- So what?

560
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:18,926
Hey, I'm the owner of
the phone which you have.

561
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:24,065
Owner? Sir, am I talking
to the owner of Nokia company?

562
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,332
Sir, give me a handset
for 50% discount.

563
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,140
Even I can buy one then..
- Hey, stop joking.

564
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:33,579
I'm Adishesha.
I'm Bangalore Adishesha speaking.

565
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:37,578
Adi? Sir, are you the same
Adi who has done 20 murders..

566
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:38,985
..and countless kidnapping?
Are you the same Adi?

567
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:41,922
Yes, I'm the same Adishesha.
- Hello, sir.

568
00:40:41,992 --> 00:40:43,892
You've taken my phone
without knowing me.

569
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,286
Return my phone back to me.

570
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,632
I'll forgive you.
- Sir, you are very kind-hearted.

571
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,929
Sir, do one thing.
If you really have to forgive me..

572
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:54,163
..do it on the phone itself.

573
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:57,469
The network is nice. Why should
I come there and spoil my network?

574
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,435
Forget it.
Sir, shall I hang up now? - Hey!

575
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:05,245
Tell me, sir. - You've
taken away my 50 lakh rupees.

576
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:08,475
Sir, forget that also.
It is a petty matter. Why are you..

577
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,212
You betterment lies
in returning my phone and..

578
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:14,087
..my 50 lakh rupees. If not..

579
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:17,286
If not, what will you do, boss?
- If not, you'll not be seen.

580
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:20,053
You are talking to me
as I haven't found out yet.

581
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:24,022
If I catch you.. - Sir, why
are you blabbering unnecessarily?

582
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,692
You can't do anything to me until
I return the phone to you myself.

583
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:26,963
Listen to me,
I'll tell you something.

584
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:29,230
This is not a game
where you are blind-folded.

585
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:31,668
This is a game which
will gouge out your eyes.

586
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:36,571
You don't know me yet. - I spoke
to you respectfully till now.

587
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:40,310
I know who you are.
Do you know who I am?

588
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:42,281
That's the screenplay here.
What say?

589
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:44,751
If you are a real man,
then come and confront me.

590
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:46,948
I'm not a man.
Why are you getting tensed?

591
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,581
Why should I come
to you and get thrashed?

592
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,684
You are a male, aren't you? - Hey!

593
00:41:50,828 --> 00:41:54,025
Isn't it? Find out who
I am and take the phone.

594
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,894
Who are you?
How are you related to me?

595
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,401
Okay.. whoever you are.
I want my phone back.

596
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,098
What do you want? - Will you
do whatever I say? - Yes, I will.

597
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:08,804
Tell me. - Tomorrow afternoon..

598
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:10,539
Tomorrow afternoon? - At 12 noon.

599
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,445
At 12 noon?
- Before Vidhana Soudha.

600
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:14,881
Before Vidhana Soudha..
there's a high court.

601
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:16,714
What is between Vidhana
Soudha and the high court?

602
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,482
Between Vidhana Soudhaand
high court.. there's a public road.

603
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:22,719
On that road, you have to stand
naked in front of the public..

604
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:25,317
..at 12 noon.

605
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,994
You have to prove that you are man,
isn't it? Can you do it?

606
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:32,132
You can't do that, isn't it?
Shut up and hang up the phone.

607
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:37,533
Adi, what if you call the customer
care and disconnect that number?

608
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:39,735
Instead of that, put petrol
on me and burn me to ashes.

609
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:42,738
Your life will be meaningful
as my elder brother.

610
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,377
If we disconnect that number,
it is like hanging ourselves.

611
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,312
We can never find him in our life.

612
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:52,582
It is okay, but what if he
takes out the sim card thinking..

613
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:54,350
..he has got enough of money now?

614
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,584
Did you hear him or not?

615
00:42:55,893 --> 00:42:59,954
He is not the one who'll run away,
but the one who'll haunt you.

616
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,122
I'm telling you the same.

617
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:04,597
Our phone is with him.
We won't disconnect the phone..

618
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:05,895
..and he won't throw the sim card.

619
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:07,197
What if there is any problem?

620
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,464
So, do you want me
to fear him and keep quiet?

621
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,804
He is telling me to..

622
00:43:14,444 --> 00:43:16,844
..stand naked in
front of Vidhana Soudha.

623
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:23,078
Whatever he said.. if I don't
reply him and hack him to pieces..

624
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,945
..like he said, I am not a man.

625
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:27,318
What do you want to do?

626
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:31,160
Once if the cat has stolen milk,
it will surely come again.

627
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,959
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8..

628
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,226
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8..

629
00:43:40,337 --> 00:43:42,532
Linganna.. - What?

630
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:43,831
Why haven't you tasted it yet?

631
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:46,669
Get lost.
Are you trying to joke with me?

632
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:49,746
You mean, this Vishnu
Vardhana doesn't have money?

633
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,048
Do you mean to say, this
Vishnu Vardhana doesn't have money?

634
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:53,412
Then?

635
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:59,251
I'm tired of drinking
local quarter rum daily.

636
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:04,022
So, I've brought you to
the city bar to try something new.

637
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,460
This means, you have lot of money.

638
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,624
Not only that, I have lots to come.

639
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,863
How? - Forget that.
Will you drink or not?

640
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,271
This is nice. This is superb.

641
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:30,609
Waiter, no matter if the
sky falls or there's an earthquake.

642
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:33,087
No matter if the ice becomes
water or the water becomes ice.

643
00:44:33,156 --> 00:44:35,556
No matter if there is moon
in the day and sun in the night.

644
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:40,162
My friend has liked this drink.
No matter how costly it is..

645
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,787
..get two bottles for me.

646
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:43,365
This is the local
rum that you drink daily.

647
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:44,991
It is Rs. 50 for a quarter. - What?

648
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:49,900
We know.. no matter what we change,
but we won't change our brand.

649
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:51,167
Give me two bottles of it.

650
00:44:55,078 --> 00:45:00,015
Lord, today my work should
be done without any problem.

651
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,378
Everything should be successful.

652
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,851
Lord Vinayaka.

653
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:29,935
Oh no, everything
inside it is empty.

654
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:41,551
The booty is in this and
the key is with the children.

655
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:45,488
When children grow up,
they don't care for their fathers.

656
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:48,993
Lord Vinayaka,
I trust you completely.

657
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:01,374
"Where are you?"
Who kept this here?

658
00:46:02,979 --> 00:46:05,004
Sir will scold me
if he sees this here.

659
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:10,283
Where is the stool? - Oh my God.

660
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,579
Sir, where are you?

661
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:15,892
Oh my God! Oh my God!

662
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:22,892
Why did you have to do this?

663
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:23,955
Grandpa?

664
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:25,659
You all go out. Come on, go out.

665
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:27,767
We have to go out whenever
there's a problem.

666
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,168
Valli, what happened?

667
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:34,442
Did father do anything to you?

668
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:36,535
Ask him what he did.

669
00:46:37,147 --> 00:46:39,615
Father, why do you
do such things at this age?

670
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:43,710
Dear, what can I do? It is
habitual, so I couldn't control it.

671
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:46,820
Don't you feel ashamed
to call it as a habit?

672
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,825
Every evening when the sun sets,
I feel something.

673
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:53,795
I tried to control it,
but couldn't.

674
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,190
I'm sorry.

675
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:58,165
Why do you ask me sorry?
Apologize to Valli.

676
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:03,301
Sorry Valli.
- Why are you apologizing to me?

677
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:05,341
If it was once in a week..

678
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:07,739
..I would've given it
to you without their knowledge.

679
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:12,739
But you want it daily.
It will affect your health.

680
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:18,277
Valli. - Madam, without your
knowledge he drinks stealthily..

681
00:47:18,388 --> 00:47:21,619
..and he climbed up and fell down.

682
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:23,488
What if something
would've happened to him?

683
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:27,051
Father, how many times have
I told you not to drink this?

684
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:29,226
Sir.. - Okay.

685
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:34,730
Superb.

686
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:37,764
We have to decide it today. - What?

687
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:41,239
We have to decide it today. - What?

688
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:46,138
Whether she will propose
me or I should propose her.

689
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:50,949
Who? - She.. Bharati.

690
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:54,113
What should I do now? - Call her.

691
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:57,091
I fell down and I am in pain.
Instead of calling a doctor..

692
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,094
..you are standing
here and scolding me.

693
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,388
Aunt, your phone is ringing.

694
00:48:02,332 --> 00:48:04,493
Hello? - Hello.

695
00:48:04,701 --> 00:48:06,635
Who is it? - I'm Vishnu speaking.

696
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:10,166
Hey doctor.. what a surprise?

697
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:12,867
Doctor? I'm Vishnu speaking.

698
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:14,877
Yes. Aren't you Dr. Vishnu Vardhana?

699
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:19,313
Yes. - I was thinking of you.
Doctor, what are you doing?

700
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:22,175
What am I doing?
- You are taking the third round.

701
00:48:22,252 --> 00:48:24,914
I'm taking the third round.
- Third round?

702
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:28,818
I mean, in the hospitals..
to check the patients..

703
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:30,291
..they call it as third round,
isn't it?

704
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,759
Nurse, give him the injection.

705
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:33,954
Yes, the same way,
I'm taking the third round.

706
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:37,363
I can hear a lot of people talking.

707
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:40,502
It is weekend.
So, the crowd comes here.

708
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,561
During weekends,
there is a crowd in the bar..

709
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,037
..is it same in the hospital too?

710
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,907
For me, pub is like a hospital..
and hospital is a pub.

711
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:50,844
How can I stay away
from the patients, tell me?

712
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:52,448
I'm always close to my patients.

713
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:55,383
You said,
you were thinking about me.

714
00:48:55,986 --> 00:48:58,147
Can I know why? I mean..

715
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:01,552
Doctor, actually my father
slipped and fell down.

716
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:02,853
He has hurt his leg.

717
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:08,327
Oh.. he fell down!
Why didn't you call the doctor?

718
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:10,959
You are a doctor,
why should I call others?

719
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:15,265
Right said. Shall I come home?

720
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:17,769
Yes, doctor. Please, come soon.

721
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,171
I'll be there as soon
as you disconnect the phone.

722
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:20,470
Okay. - Hang up the phone.

723
00:49:20,577 --> 00:49:22,943
Hello? Are you going there? - Yes.

724
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:25,004
Your mouth is stinking.

725
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:29,609
It is not dettol, but it is local
rum that you had three rounds.

726
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,121
Idea..

727
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:36,621
Doctor, tell me. - I need
to have a small clarification.

728
00:49:36,693 --> 00:49:39,491
Tell me.
- Do you have rum in your house?

729
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:43,226
Rum? - Do you have it or not?

730
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,300
Yes. - Then listen
carefully to what I say.

731
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,168
Do this until I reach there. Okay?

732
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:52,941
Dear, what is this?

733
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:56,408
This has to go inside, but you are
wasting it by putting it outside.

734
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:57,980
Who told this treatment to you?

735
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:01,506
Father, Bharati had been to
Mallige hospital in the morning..

736
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:03,483
..and she said that
she met someone there.

737
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:04,917
That doctor told her to do so.

738
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:09,424
Oh.. son-in-law? - Yes, father.

739
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:12,393
"The moon has come from the sky.."

740
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:14,122
Wait there. - Where is she?

741
00:50:14,197 --> 00:50:16,358
I don't know what magic you cast
on her in the hospital in morning.

742
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:17,990
She has only been
talking about you.

743
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,090
Why did you come here at this hour?

744
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:20,796
Are you here to take
the clothes to wash?

745
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:22,098
Hey! Tell her.

746
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:24,970
He has come here as a doctor.
I've come here as a lover.

747
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,065
I'll kill you.

748
00:50:26,343 --> 00:50:29,176
Hi. Hi.

749
00:50:29,846 --> 00:50:31,871
She is my sister, Poorni.
- Hello. - Hello.

750
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:33,471
She is my brother's children.
- Hi. - Hi.

751
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,811
Doctor, please come. - Please come.

752
00:50:34,884 --> 00:50:37,853
I can smell something
dirty like alcohol.

753
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,320
Looks like somebody is drunk.

754
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:40,583
It is me.

755
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:44,586
Did you? - I massaged my
father with rum as first aid.

756
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:46,161
You told me to do so, didn't you?
- Yes, I told her.

757
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:47,389
So, there's booze smell
all over in the house.

758
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:48,623
Come on, let's go. - Come on.

759
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:50,422
Compounder.. - Yes, doctor?

760
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:52,023
I hope you won't have any
problem in treating the patient..

761
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,127
..in this dirty smell? - When
nothing happened to you, how can I..

762
00:50:55,238 --> 00:50:57,069
Don't blabber..
- Doctor, how did you come so soon?

763
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:59,666
Actually, we..
- We came here running.

764
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:01,300
Did you come running? - Yes.

765
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:03,539
There will be a lot of traffic,
so we came running.

766
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,874
The patient is very
important for us.

767
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:06,642
Let's go and see the patient first.
- Yes, please come.

768
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,581
Show me.
- Yes, show him. - Please, come.

769
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,845
Nagavalli..

770
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:12,615
Son-in-law, please come.
- Son-in..?

771
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:15,522
Sir, he is not your son-in-law.
He is a doctor.

772
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,956
Doctor, don't get him wrong.

773
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,460
No matter who he sees,
he calls them as son-in-law.

774
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:20,723
Has he injured his
head anytime before?

775
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:23,163
Father, stay quiet. He doesn't
know anything about it till now.

776
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:25,427
Doctor, you are here
without your stethoscope.

777
00:51:25,535 --> 00:51:28,402
Stethoscope.. - Father, he
left his car there and came here..

778
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,597
..and you are talking
about the stethoscope.

779
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:30,866
I was about to tell him the same.

780
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:34,975
How many months? - Just now I fell.

781
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,604
Uncle, I asked her.

782
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,114
Oh, you asked her.
- It is 5 months.

783
00:51:41,117 --> 00:51:45,076
How did it happen?
- Was the question for me or her?

784
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:49,318
Uncle, I asked you.
How can I question her like that?

785
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:52,088
Father, you don't know to talk.

786
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:53,754
He'll treat you.
You just sit quietly.

787
00:51:54,297 --> 00:51:56,629
Sir, can you tell us
how this did happen to you?

788
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:57,825
Do you want to know the flashback?

789
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:05,333
Shall I give you the
medication in the bottle..

790
00:52:05,408 --> 00:52:06,705
or shall I measure
it in the cap for you?

791
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:08,038
Doctor,
give it to me in the bottle.

792
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:15,473
Doctor, give me some more.
- Don't drink more.

793
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:20,086
That was a good timing.

794
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:21,316
What timing are you talking about?

795
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:25,758
I'll tell you. Is it settled now?

796
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,890
Do you still have the pain?
No, isn't it?

797
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:30,432
That is the magic
of the medication.

798
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:31,932
Doctor, I hope there's no fracture.

799
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:33,901
Nothing.
Everything is fine. - It is fine.

800
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:34,902
He doesn't have any problem.

801
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:37,371
Without taking an x-ray, how can
you say that there's no fracture?

802
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,941
Actually..
- Shall I ask you something?

803
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:44,304
Did the doctor come
first or the x-ray?

804
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:48,409
Doctor. - That is right. The
doctor knows more than the x-ray.

805
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:50,146
Am I right, uncle?
- Well said, son.

806
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:53,086
Keep taking medication on time.

807
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:54,487
I'll take full.

808
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:56,290
Uncle, shall I leave? - Okay.

809
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:57,553
Will you get up? - Okay.

810
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:59,959
Doctor, coffee? - We don't
want to drink coffee now.

811
00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:01,121
We drink something else.

812
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:03,495
Doctor, let's go. - Give it to me.

813
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:05,394
Uncle. - Let's go.

814
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:07,493
Doctor.. - Yes, uncle?

815
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,596
What is your name?
- My name is Vishnu Vardhana.

816
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:12,368
Dr. Vishnu Vardhana.

817
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:25,120
Uncle, why are you crying?
Did I say something wrong?

818
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:26,820
No, doctor.

819
00:53:28,224 --> 00:53:31,853
I had a best friend
who had the same name.

820
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:40,592
You had..
- I had.. now he is here..

821
00:53:44,374 --> 00:53:45,398
Goodbye.

822
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:46,464
The coffee is very nice.

823
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:50,171
Doctor, you called
me to say something.

824
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:52,981
Instead of asking you what it is..

825
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:55,677
..I made you come to my house.

826
00:53:55,752 --> 00:53:57,947
I'm sorry. - No problem.
Why are you apologizing to me?

827
00:53:58,054 --> 00:54:00,318
Tell me. Why did you call me?

828
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:12,958
Actually, I forgot. I forgot..

829
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:16,137
I'll tell you as soon as
I remember it. Is it okay with you?

830
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:19,704
Call me the moment you remember it.
I'll wait for you.

831
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:23,143
Cup.. - Oh.

832
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:25,641
Shall I leave? - Yes.

833
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:27,807
I'll tell you as soon
as I remember it. - Okay.

834
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:28,976
I shall leave.

835
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,993
You said, colonel's daughter
would come to the hospital.

836
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:42,654
Even I was waiting
for her since morning.

837
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,427
She hasn't come here till now.

838
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:46,229
You came here to
take your commission.

839
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:48,770
Mr. Surya Prakash,
it is not as you think.

840
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:50,929
I'll find out why
she hasn't come here.

841
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:53,335
Okay, go. - Okay, sir.

842
00:54:53,676 --> 00:54:54,938
Doctor. - Yes, sister?

843
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:57,172
The inspector is here to meet you.
- Send him inside.

844
00:54:57,246 --> 00:54:59,373
Okay. Sir, you can go in.

845
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,712
Hello doctor, I'm inspector Rakesh.

846
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,845
Hello inspector, please sit down.
- Thank you.

847
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:07,219
What can I do for you?

848
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:10,751
Sir, a murder took place
in your hospital in morning.

849
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:14,626
I inquired all your staff
members regarding that.

850
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:17,761
No one is cooperating with me.
If you tell them..

851
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:20,700
Look inspector, I'm running
this hospital to treat patients..

852
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,761
..and to do business.

853
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,699
I won't force anyone
to give their testimony..

854
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:27,402
..and won't stop them
if they are willing to.

855
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:28,737
So, you please..

856
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:34,644
"Play the game.."

857
00:55:36,953 --> 00:55:39,012
Hello? - Is this Adishesha?

858
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,224
Yes. - I'm Narsimha Reddy.

859
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:45,186
Is this Balakrishna's
new title of his movie?

860
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:47,558
I'm talking from Hyderabad.

861
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:51,566
I need a help. - I.. tell me.

862
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:54,626
I'm ready to pay any amount.
- What? Tell me.

863
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:57,638
Venkat and Narayan have taken Rs.
2 crore from me..

864
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,732
..and are not returning.
They cheated me.

865
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,508
Many people told
me that if Adi wishes..

866
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:06,047
..you'll get back your money.

867
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:09,676
So, I collected your number and
I'm calling you for the first time.

868
00:56:11,387 --> 00:56:12,615
What should I do?

869
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:15,317
Rape (tomorrow)
- I won't rape anyone.

870
00:56:15,425 --> 00:56:17,620
Boss, I was not talking
about English rape..

871
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:18,752
..I was telling tomorrow in Telugu.

872
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:20,021
You had to tell this before.

873
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:21,327
Tell me.

874
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:23,797
Tomorrow morning
Venkat and Narayan..

875
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,563
..are travelling in a car
number 2233 and coming there.

876
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,138
Kidnap them and keep them with you.

877
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,407
I will blackmail his
brother and recover my money.

878
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:37,445
Boss, don't murder them.
- I won't do that.

879
00:56:37,547 --> 00:56:39,811
I'll pay you 50 lakh
rupees for this deal.

880
00:56:40,216 --> 00:56:42,013
How much? - 50 lakh rupees.

881
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:45,054
50.. - Please, help me.

882
00:56:49,892 --> 00:56:51,655
Done. Hang up the phone.

883
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:53,490
Thanks a lot, boss.

884
00:56:55,898 --> 00:56:57,490
How was my mimicry?

885
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,361
The prey has been trapped.

886
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:03,932
Didn't I tell you, once the cat
steals milk, it will come again?

887
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,908
Tomorrow you take our
2233 number car and go to..

888
00:57:07,977 --> 00:57:10,172
..Thirupati route.
You become Narayan. - Okay, boss.

889
00:57:10,246 --> 00:57:11,611
In the greed of 50 lakh rupees,

890
00:57:11,714 --> 00:57:13,409
..that duplicate Adishesha
will surely come there.

891
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,679
Take this. Shoot him in
his leg as soon as you see him..

892
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:18,185
..and get him here.

893
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:22,080
Why are you crying?
What happened to you?

894
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:24,056
Brother, why shouldn't I cry?

895
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:26,889
No one in the village
believes that I'm a rowdy.

896
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:28,487
Even you don't think me as one.

897
00:57:28,564 --> 00:57:30,259
If you don't, who'll encourage me?

898
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,868
Okay, don't sit and cry here.

899
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:34,994
You go with him.
Give him the gun. - Okay, boss.

900
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:45,242
"Golden castle for me.."

901
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:56,520
"Hail Lord Hanuman."

902
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,357
Hey, what are you doing?

903
00:57:59,462 --> 00:58:00,895
"Hail Lord Hanuman."

904
00:58:00,997 --> 00:58:01,929
Where were you all?

905
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:04,022
Hey, don't damage the car.

906
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,864
You are children,
but you are acting like monkeys.

907
00:58:13,543 --> 00:58:15,135
Stop it.

908
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:19,612
You all are too much.

909
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:25,382
"Hail Lord Hanuman."

910
00:58:27,056 --> 00:58:28,819
The army of monkeys
is coming towards us.

911
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:31,485
Get down.
I washed the car in the morning.

912
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:32,493
Please, get down.

913
00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:33,824
"Hail Lord Hanuman."

914
00:58:33,896 --> 00:58:35,921
Why is boss going in such a speed?

915
00:58:38,701 --> 00:58:40,328
It is a call from my
men who came along with me.

916
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,999
Tell them to go
straight to Thirupati..

917
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:47,507
..do veneration and take
a laddoo (sweet) with them..

918
00:58:47,844 --> 00:58:50,938
..and give it to Adi. Tell them.

919
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:52,745
Hello? - Hello?

920
00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:54,476
Go straight to Thirupati.. - Then?

921
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:56,313
Take a laddoo.. - Then?

922
00:58:56,452 --> 00:58:58,113
Give it to Adi. - Why?

923
00:58:58,221 --> 00:58:59,620
Just do as I say.

924
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:17,732
Shall we leave? - Sari?

925
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:22,534
Sari, I wore it as I wanted
to go to the temple with you.

926
00:59:22,612 --> 00:59:24,307
How do I look?

927
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:29,744
Let's go. - Why are you laughing?

928
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:34,055
Don't feel offended.

929
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:35,784
You say you want
to go to the temple.

930
00:59:36,325 --> 00:59:39,817
When people see you, they should
feel that you've come from home..

931
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:42,695
..and not coming after
consummation night.

932
00:59:43,266 --> 00:59:46,326
No problem, let they think.
Come on, let's go.

933
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:50,361
Actually,
I wore it for the first time, so..

934
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:54,738
"Play the game." - Cell phone?

935
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,539
You said you don't use the mobile.

936
00:59:56,612 --> 01:00:00,912
It is not mine. A VIP's brother
is admitted in our hospital.

937
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:04,077
"Play the game and see."
- He has been admitted.

938
01:00:04,153 --> 01:00:06,144
They've given me the phone
to know about his condition.

939
01:00:06,255 --> 01:00:08,086
It is not mine. Give me a second.

940
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:11,452
Hello? - Where's my brother?

941
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:13,085
Didn't I tell you he is in ICU?

942
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:15,960
Release my brother right away.

943
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:19,829
Look, try to understand what I say.

944
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:22,928
Doctor will decide
when he will be discharged.

945
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:26,600
One more thing.. just because
you've given me the phone..

946
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:28,473
..don't disturb me by
calling me again and again.

947
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:30,442
Please. - Hey!

948
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,414
Is he a doctor?

949
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:38,945
You do one thing..
remove your sari and give it to me.

950
01:00:39,055 --> 01:00:41,046
Sari? - Don't mistake me.

951
01:00:41,123 --> 01:00:44,115
Remove it and give it to me,
I'll tell you.

952
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:53,635
You iron it so nicely. - I
have an experience of seven years.

953
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:57,832
Experience? - I mean,
I keep giving shock treatments..

954
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:00,269
..to the patients in the hospital.

955
01:01:00,343 --> 01:01:03,938
Even that instrument resembles
this. So, I told you.

956
01:01:05,214 --> 01:01:06,545
Take this.

957
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:10,081
Is this your sari? - Yes.

958
01:01:10,353 --> 01:01:13,254
I'll wear this and show it to you..
how to wear it.

959
01:01:13,489 --> 01:01:16,219
You wear it like that..
if it is okay with you.

960
01:01:16,726 --> 01:01:18,057
Okay.

961
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:20,524
Take this part and tuck it inside.

962
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:25,533
I mean, tuck it there.
Take this part and take a rotation.

963
01:01:26,135 --> 01:01:27,397
Then take this and..

964
01:01:40,049 --> 01:01:43,416
That is all..
wear it now. Look, how I wore it.

965
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,491
Shall I wear it?
Won't you make me wear it?

966
01:01:53,295 --> 01:01:57,356
I.. - Did you remember
what you had to tell me that day?

967
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:03,100
That.. I remembered it.
I'm feeling shy.

968
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,599
"Magic. I'm magic."

969
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:12,410
"Love is a magic."

970
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:15,414
"Magic."

971
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:17,948
"Magic."

972
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:19,851
"Love is a magic."

973
01:02:19,922 --> 01:02:21,480
"Magic."

974
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:35,531
"How I was, how I became?"

975
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,865
"What is the name of the
magic that you've cast on me?"

976
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:44,503
"Where were you?
What did you do to me?"

977
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:48,811
"I forgot my name
since I've met you."

978
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:53,487
"You've stolen me from myself."

979
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:58,289
"Why do you laugh
and steal my heart?"

980
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,353
"You locked eyes with
me and struck love on me."

981
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:06,799
"I lost my heart then."

982
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,342
"Hold me now."

983
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:20,407
"Hold me now."

984
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:42,729
"I was happy when I was alone.
Then I met you."

985
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:47,208
"Seeing your smile,
I got lost completely."

986
01:03:47,276 --> 01:03:51,576
"You are everything to me."

987
01:03:51,647 --> 01:03:56,209
"You are my desire."

988
01:03:56,285 --> 01:04:01,222
"You are the world to me."

989
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:05,083
"It is you."

990
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:17,302
"Magic."

991
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:41,192
"Who are your parents?
I thank them whole heartedly."

992
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:45,358
"Lord Brahma gave you to me.
He did the right thing by doing so."

993
01:04:45,434 --> 01:04:49,598
"Look at me again and again."

994
01:04:49,738 --> 01:04:54,334
"Look at me all the time."

995
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:59,871
"Look at my condition."

996
01:05:00,449 --> 01:05:03,350
"Look."

997
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:07,985
"How I was, how I became?"

998
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,317
"What is the name of the
magic that you've cast on me?"

999
01:05:12,428 --> 01:05:16,956
"Where were you?
What did you do to me?"

1000
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:21,162
"I forgot my name
since I've met you."

1001
01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:25,840
"You've stolen me from myself."

1002
01:05:25,941 --> 01:05:30,674
"Why do you laugh
and steal my heart?"

1003
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:34,977
"You locked eyes with
me and struck love on me."

1004
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:39,612
"I lost my heart then."

1005
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:48,323
"Hold me now."

1006
01:05:48,397 --> 01:05:52,834
"Hold me now."

1007
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:00,933
Hello?

1008
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,103
I saw your 250 missed call.
Is anything urgent?

1009
01:06:03,178 --> 01:06:06,443
You sent Laddoo to me
and you abducted my brother.

1010
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:10,279
This mimicry artist is sitting
here sullen without eating pilaf.

1011
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:11,476
He is your brother.

1012
01:06:11,787 --> 01:06:13,914
I thought he was Venkat
Reddy or Narayan Reddy.

1013
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:19,226
Unknowingly my brother
got into your trap.

1014
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:22,626
Release him.
- What will I do with this scrap?

1015
01:06:22,698 --> 01:06:24,461
If I release him, who'll
give me 50 lakh rupees that..

1016
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,797
..Narsimha Reddy had promised me?

1017
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:28,870
Do one thing, give me
that money and take him away.

1018
01:06:28,937 --> 01:06:30,165
Where do I get the money?

1019
01:06:30,272 --> 01:06:32,172
Near the river banks
of Oganikle river.

1020
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:33,905
Boss, there's one more
thing I have to tell you.

1021
01:06:33,976 --> 01:06:36,342
What is it? - The battery
is getting over in this phone.

1022
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:38,045
If it goes completely down..

1023
01:06:38,147 --> 01:06:40,377
..then our communication
will be totally cut off.

1024
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:44,146
So, do one thing, while getting
the money, get me the charger too.

1025
01:06:44,253 --> 01:06:46,687
Couldn't you buy a charger?

1026
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:48,814
Boss, what are you saying?
It is Rs. 100 in the signals.

1027
01:06:49,024 --> 01:06:50,286
How much does an original one cost?

1028
01:06:50,693 --> 01:06:52,285
Don't argue in business.

1029
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:55,262
While getting the money,
get me the charger too.

1030
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:13,847
Are our men ready? - I've
arranged for 50 local hoodlums.

1031
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:16,850
They are hiding here.
- Let him come here.

1032
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:21,416
Boss! Boss, look in the front.

1033
01:07:25,928 --> 01:07:28,829
The phone is out of battery,
so I'm talking in the mike.

1034
01:07:28,897 --> 01:07:30,990
Hey, he is on the
other side of the river.

1035
01:07:31,367 --> 01:07:34,359
Are our men there?
- Boss, you told me Betedat.

1036
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:35,936
So, all our men are here.

1037
01:07:36,004 --> 01:07:38,165
That is Oganikle area.
It is in Tamil Nadu border.

1038
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,333
Boss, have you brought
the money and the charger?

1039
01:07:40,409 --> 01:07:42,434
It is ready. Come here and take it.

1040
01:07:42,544 --> 01:07:45,775
Boss, I'm not a comedian like your
brother to come there and take it.

1041
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:47,406
How do I give you money then?

1042
01:07:47,483 --> 01:07:52,477
There's a boat in front of you.
Keep the money and push it.

1043
01:07:52,554 --> 01:07:54,613
It is 50 lakh rupees.
What if it drowns?

1044
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,748
There are falls ahead.

1045
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:58,918
Boss, the money is mine.
Why are you getting tensed?

1046
01:07:58,994 --> 01:08:00,518
Just keep it in it and push it.

1047
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:05,062
Boss, don't forget the charger.
- Darn it.

1048
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:07,834
50 lakh rupees. It will drown.

1049
01:08:23,986 --> 01:08:25,419
Boss, look there.

1050
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:32,292
Do you know to swim? - No, sir.

1051
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:35,524
Now you are talking
in Kannada. - Yes.

1052
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:39,565
Boss, this comedian doesn't
know anything other than mimicry.

1053
01:08:40,002 --> 01:08:43,267
You would've paid money
to 50 men to nab me.

1054
01:08:43,505 --> 01:08:44,904
Don't let that money go waste.

1055
01:08:44,973 --> 01:08:46,031
Tell them to take him from here.

1056
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,176
I have to charge my phone.
I have lot of work to do.

1057
01:08:48,243 --> 01:08:49,437
I shall leave now.

1058
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:54,439
Don't think.
I'm with you. Take this.

1059
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:56,516
Don't get scared.

1060
01:08:59,488 --> 01:09:02,651
Good morning, sir. Sir,
there's a good news. - Tell me.

1061
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:05,721
Sir, we've got a good
chance to arrest Adishesha.

1062
01:09:06,695 --> 01:09:09,255
One of his men is ready
to become an approver.

1063
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:12,129
If you permit me, we can
call him here and arrest him.

1064
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:24,137
Since how long have
you joined this job?

1065
01:09:24,213 --> 01:09:25,441
Sir, it is six months.

1066
01:09:27,382 --> 01:09:30,408
Do you want to become
an ACP in six months?

1067
01:09:32,888 --> 01:09:35,789
The one who has become an approver
and if he turns in the court..

1068
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:37,651
..you are here
to tell a good news..

1069
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,556
.. but you'll have
to give a bad news..

1070
01:09:39,962 --> 01:09:41,657
..in your house stating
you lost the job.

1071
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:44,924
In our department, if you
nab someone, you'll be promoted.

1072
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,468
If you leave someone,
you'll be promoted.

1073
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:51,596
I have Adishesha's case
with me from the last five years.

1074
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,099
I very well know
what to do with him.

1075
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:58,137
You take some other petty
case in hand and try for promotion.

1076
01:10:06,522 --> 01:10:08,490
Adi, already the media people
are publishing in the paper..

1077
01:10:08,557 --> 01:10:09,854
..that we both have
some connection between us.

1078
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:12,253
Without informing
you've come to my office.

1079
01:10:12,694 --> 01:10:13,956
Is this your father-in-law's house?

1080
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:16,954
This is not my
father-in-law's house.

1081
01:10:17,032 --> 01:10:18,431
I am not here to preach you.

1082
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,428
I have to file a complaint.
- What complaint?

1083
01:10:21,537 --> 01:10:23,368
I lost my phone.

1084
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:26,170
Losing a mobile in
this city is very common.

1085
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,002
It is like children losing
their pencils in the school.

1086
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:30,436
Call the Airtel office
and buy a new SIM card.

1087
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,070
I can buy 100 mobiles like that.

1088
01:10:32,681 --> 01:10:38,244
The mobile that I lost
has something to do with you.

1089
01:10:38,387 --> 01:10:42,847
What are you saying? - What
did you do last Saturday afternoon?

1090
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:50,131
So what? - I have a
clipping of that in my cell.

1091
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:52,996
Why did you record that?
How did you do that?

1092
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:55,668
You don't have to
know why I recorded that.

1093
01:10:56,004 --> 01:10:59,667
I recorded that
for my safety. - Oh.

1094
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:02,176
I didn't know that
my mobile will be lost..

1095
01:11:02,344 --> 01:11:05,211
..and that jinxed guy will have it.

1096
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,180
You should've killed
that jinxed guy.

1097
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:11,719
He is so smart that
he will do anything to us.

1098
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:15,648
I've already lost 1
crore rupees because of him.

1099
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:19,858
If he finds that video clip in it..
he will take off your pants..

1100
01:11:19,928 --> 01:11:23,364
..in the public road between
Vidhana Soudha and High Court.

1101
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:26,230
I couldn't find who he is.

1102
01:11:26,902 --> 01:11:30,360
You have power,
people, and equipments with you.

1103
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:34,008
Use that and nab that jinxed guy.

1104
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:36,474
It will be good for both of us.

1105
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:43,244
Bharati, do I need to buy it?

1106
01:11:43,785 --> 01:11:46,777
Some VIP forcibly gave you
the phone, you can keep that..

1107
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:48,981
..but I'm buying you a phone
with love, you have to keep it.

1108
01:11:49,091 --> 01:11:52,185
Okay.. I don't know what to say..

1109
01:11:52,294 --> 01:11:54,524
Look. - What?

1110
01:11:55,097 --> 01:11:56,155
Look there.

1111
01:11:59,768 --> 01:12:01,793
You look like an
educated guy to me.

1112
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,631
Don't you feel ashamed to steal?

1113
01:12:04,339 --> 01:12:06,000
Actually.. - What is it?

1114
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:08,935
I wanted to gift a cell
phone to my girlfriend.

1115
01:12:09,044 --> 01:12:12,036
Will she continue to love you
if she knows that you are thief?

1116
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:14,639
Will she be happy
if she knows that..

1117
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:16,308
..you've stolen this
phone and given it to her?

1118
01:12:16,652 --> 01:12:17,880
She'll spit on your face.

1119
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,251
Adishesha is a very big don.

1120
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:23,917
Do you think you did a good
job by stealing a phone from a don?

1121
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:28,393
You said you love me,
how do I believe that?

1122
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:30,556
Do you love me or my property?

1123
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:32,759
I am feeling ashamed
to see your face.

1124
01:12:36,538 --> 01:12:37,732
Darn it!

1125
01:12:37,873 --> 01:12:41,570
Vishnu! Vishnu, what's the matter?

1126
01:12:42,177 --> 01:12:44,236
He.. - They took him.

1127
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,478
He stole a cell phone to gift
it to his lover. Shame on them.

1128
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:51,276
Everyone is not like you.
I'm very lucky.

1129
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,711
Come on, let's select
a mobile that you like.

1130
01:12:53,889 --> 01:12:57,086
I have an important work to do.

1131
01:12:57,592 --> 01:12:58,422
What is it?

1132
01:12:58,527 --> 01:12:59,960
I have to put this
in the donation box.

1133
01:13:00,195 --> 01:13:03,494
Bharati doesn't like people
who steal others things.

1134
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:05,894
If she knows this,
she'll leave me and go away.

1135
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:08,162
Before that, I'll put this
mobile in the donation box. - No.

1136
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,261
I'll help some people with
the money that I have. - No.

1137
01:13:10,338 --> 01:13:11,703
Otherwise, my love story will end.

1138
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:16,008
Friend, you had said that if
there's incoming, you'll get income.

1139
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,669
You want to put it
in the donation box.

1140
01:13:17,779 --> 01:13:21,271
Wait for two more days. If you get
a call, then give that money to me.

1141
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:22,850
Don't put that in the donation box.

1142
01:13:22,918 --> 01:13:25,819
Consider this box and donation
box and put it in this.

1143
01:13:25,887 --> 01:13:28,481
Listen, don't interfere
in this matter. Keep quiet.

1144
01:13:28,557 --> 01:13:30,752
Wait for two days, please.
- Listen, leave me.

1145
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:32,292
I beg of you. - Don't hold my leg.

1146
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,759
Leave my leg. - Please, don't.

1147
01:13:33,862 --> 01:13:35,352
Leave me. - Please.

1148
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,091
Not two, but I'll count till 10.

1149
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:43,194
If I get a call on this,
then it will be yours.

1150
01:13:43,305 --> 01:13:44,636
You shouldn't stop me, okay?

1151
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:48,801
Pal, count slowly. You
are my darling. - I'll slap you.

1152
01:13:48,877 --> 01:13:55,749
Please.
- 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. - Oh God..

1153
01:13:56,218 --> 01:13:58,778
5.. - No.

1154
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:01,253
6.. - No.

1155
01:14:01,323 --> 01:14:03,382
7, 8.. - It is ringing.

1156
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:06,518
9.. - "Play a game."

1157
01:14:06,628 --> 01:14:10,359
Good. - "Play and see."

1158
01:14:10,665 --> 01:14:14,658
"Play and see." - Pal,
answer the phone.

1159
01:14:14,736 --> 01:14:17,432
You'll get income.
Answer it, you'll get money.

1160
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:19,803
Pal, you'll get money. Answer it.

1161
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:22,001
Hello? - Talk.

1162
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:26,572
Hello? - Pal, talk to her.

1163
01:14:26,648 --> 01:14:30,084
Hello? - Talk to her.

1164
01:14:30,418 --> 01:14:32,409
Hello? - Hello Vishnu, how are you?

1165
01:14:33,555 --> 01:14:36,251
You told me that no one knows that
you have the cell phone with you.

1166
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:37,882
But she is telling
your name as Vishnu.

1167
01:14:37,959 --> 01:14:39,324
I have nothing to do with this.

1168
01:14:39,861 --> 01:14:44,025
Hello, I'm Adi speaking.
I don't know anyone named Vishnu.

1169
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,030
Sorry, wrong number.

1170
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:46,498
Vishnu Vardhana, son of Puttaiah.

1171
01:14:46,568 --> 01:14:48,627
Your father does a petty job.
You live in Indra Nagar.

1172
01:14:48,737 --> 01:14:50,967
Are these details enough or you
want me to tell your horoscope too?

1173
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,842
My..

1174
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,918
Listen, I.. - I don't have
enough of time to talk more.

1175
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:06,385
Listen to me carefully.
The 1 crore rupees that you..

1176
01:15:06,454 --> 01:15:08,319
..stole from Adishesha,
take 10 lakh rupees from it..

1177
01:15:08,423 --> 01:15:10,823
..and meet me in the value
forum mall in 10 minutes.

1178
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:13,220
You have to come..
you just have 10 minutes.

1179
01:15:13,461 --> 01:15:18,728
Nothing like that..
listen to me. Who is she?

1180
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:20,963
10 lakh rupees..
10 lakh rupees.. 10 lakh rupees..

1181
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:27,974
10 lakh rupees?

1182
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:39,448
"Play the game." - What is it?

1183
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:43,354
"Play the game." - Hello?

1184
01:15:43,558 --> 01:15:46,925
Do as I say.
- I am doing it, sister.

1185
01:15:46,995 --> 01:15:48,792
Can you see a coffee shop?

1186
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:54,493
Yes. - Go there,
don't disconnect the phone.

1187
01:15:59,007 --> 01:16:00,065
I'm near the coffee shop.

1188
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:01,665
Don't go inside. Stand there.

1189
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:02,937
Sister, I'm standing here.

1190
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:04,808
There's a dustbin next to you.

1191
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,379
What is it? - The dustbin..

1192
01:16:06,448 --> 01:16:08,382
Yes, there is one.

1193
01:16:08,884 --> 01:16:10,317
Put the money inside it.

1194
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:11,879
Sister, should I put it in this?

1195
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:13,884
Put it inside. - Put it.

1196
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:16,318
Hurry up.

1197
01:16:17,025 --> 01:16:21,052
Good. One more thing, don't
try to play hide and seek with me.

1198
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:22,687
Don't look behind
and just walk straight.

1199
01:16:22,764 --> 01:16:24,595
Sister, shall I hang
up the phone? - Okay.

1200
01:16:26,268 --> 01:16:28,395
Pal, if she knows that
we've kept a brick inside..

1201
01:16:28,503 --> 01:16:31,097
..she will thrash us to death.

1202
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:32,604
Let's go.

1203
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:35,801
This is not official.
This matter should be kept secret.

1204
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:37,602
We have to nab him at any cost.

1205
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:41,442
"Play the game."
- It is ringing again.

1206
01:16:42,117 --> 01:16:44,312
Pal, it must be the same
girl who we gave brick to.

1207
01:16:44,419 --> 01:16:45,545
Give it to me.

1208
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:47,411
Hello? - Good morning, sir.

1209
01:16:47,656 --> 01:16:49,089
My name is Mohan Mambali.
- Tell me.

1210
01:16:49,157 --> 01:16:50,454
I'm calling you from
the Airtel office.

1211
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:52,288
It is last day today
to pay your bills.

1212
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,794
Bill? How much?
- Sir, it is Rs. 1700.

1213
01:16:54,896 --> 01:16:56,955
Hey, I only get incoming calls.

1214
01:16:57,132 --> 01:16:59,362
Sir, it is okay if you
pay half the amount now.

1215
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:01,493
You are a fool. - Yes, sir.

1216
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,364
Sir, where are you now?
- I'm in Madivala.

1217
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:06,739
Yes, sir.

1218
01:17:06,808 --> 01:17:08,275
Where exactly in Madivala, sir?

1219
01:17:08,343 --> 01:17:12,973
Why? - My agent will come and
collect the bill amount from you.

1220
01:17:13,148 --> 01:17:15,548
No need. I'll go to the
Madivala outlet and pay the bill.

1221
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:17,845
Sir, what time can you come here?

1222
01:17:18,086 --> 01:17:19,644
It will take me 15-20
minutes to reach there.

1223
01:17:19,721 --> 01:17:22,485
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Okay. Hang up now.

1224
01:17:22,857 --> 01:17:24,722
Inform the Madivala station.

1225
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:26,555
Tell them to send a team
to the Airtel office there.

1226
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,458
The one who is playing with
my life with the cell phone..

1227
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,521
..I'll nab him in 10
minutes and make him dance.

1228
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,098
Sir! - Have you informed them?
- Yes, sir.

1229
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:41,574
He'll come to pay
the bill on that number.

1230
01:17:41,643 --> 01:17:43,042
Inform them as soon as
he comes here. - Okay, sir.

1231
01:17:43,144 --> 01:17:44,372
Be alert. Okay? - Okay, sir.

1232
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:51,809
Stand near that circle.
- Come soon, pal.

1233
01:17:51,886 --> 01:17:53,080
I will return soon.

1234
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:55,016
Thank you. - Thank you, ma'am.

1235
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:57,121
Next.

1236
01:17:58,927 --> 01:18:00,451
Sir, what's your number?

1237
01:18:06,968 --> 01:18:07,957
Let go.

1238
01:18:08,503 --> 01:18:10,471
You take Mr. Adishesha's
phone and mess with him?

1239
01:18:10,538 --> 01:18:11,334
How dare you mess with Mr.
Adishesha?

1240
01:18:11,406 --> 01:18:12,600
Sir, I'm Adishesha's man.

1241
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:14,335
Where is Mr. Adishesha's phone?

1242
01:18:17,912 --> 01:18:19,243
You will call me
as an Airtel agent..

1243
01:18:19,347 --> 01:18:22,043
..and I will come
there to pay the bill..

1244
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:25,176
..you will then nab
me and I will get nabbed.

1245
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,414
Are you an ACP officer or a joker?

1246
01:18:29,257 --> 01:18:32,317
Hey you, doesn't Adishesha
know that he will not get me..

1247
01:18:32,427 --> 01:18:34,918
..if the phone gets disconnected?

1248
01:18:35,296 --> 01:18:37,560
I told him and he paid the bill.

1249
01:18:37,665 --> 01:18:40,657
Where are you? - Not too far.

1250
01:18:40,802 --> 01:18:43,202
I'm waiting for you outside.

1251
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:44,532
Come soon.

1252
01:18:44,773 --> 01:18:46,570
Where are you?

1253
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:47,835
You go on..

1254
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:50,604
Who are you?
- You caught a wrong man.

1255
01:18:50,678 --> 01:18:51,940
Go.

1256
01:18:53,348 --> 01:18:55,839
Why do you yell so
much coming outside?

1257
01:18:56,117 --> 01:18:57,880
Look towards the left.

1258
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:04,381
Not towards your left,
look toward the right of your left.

1259
01:19:04,659 --> 01:19:06,627
Don't mess with me.

1260
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:09,520
Don't talk too much. Listen to me.

1261
01:19:11,266 --> 01:19:16,226
You can find out the position
of the phone through signal.

1262
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:18,795
But how will find out
in whose pocket it is in?

1263
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:21,737
By the way, the bill for
this month has been paid, ACP.

1264
01:19:22,077 --> 01:19:24,978
Until the next month, bye.

1265
01:19:26,714 --> 01:19:27,840
Oh my God.

1266
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:30,008
Idiot. Are you crazy?

1267
01:19:30,085 --> 01:19:31,211
I'm standing here petrified.

1268
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:33,652
Moreover, the money is lying there.

1269
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:35,848
Why are you screaming?

1270
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:40,893
I troubled the ACP so much that..
- You troubled me too.

1271
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,290
Don't spare him.
Break the car glass.

1272
01:19:45,366 --> 01:19:47,129
Don't spare him.
Break the car glass.

1273
01:19:47,202 --> 01:19:48,965
Break the car glass. Come on.

1274
01:19:59,147 --> 01:20:00,512
Come on.

1275
01:20:09,124 --> 01:20:11,752
You splashed water
on us by driving rashly..

1276
01:20:11,826 --> 01:20:14,454
..and now you come
towards us in slow motion?

1277
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:16,564
Take off your glasses.
You will see things clearly.

1278
01:20:18,299 --> 01:20:19,493
Why are you laughing?

1279
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:21,296
I'm yelling at you
and not appreciating.

1280
01:20:21,402 --> 01:20:23,734
Do we look like fools? Tell me?

1281
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:25,237
Are you fond of bricks?

1282
01:20:26,474 --> 01:20:28,271
I found it there. Why?

1283
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:29,936
One second.

1284
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:32,076
Who is she? - I don't know.

1285
01:20:38,153 --> 01:20:41,611
It's her. - Who?

1286
01:20:42,657 --> 01:20:44,989
So you found it.

1287
01:20:45,059 --> 01:20:48,051
It belongs to him. - Who? - To him.

1288
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:49,858
We need to give her the money.
- I see.

1289
01:20:49,931 --> 01:20:51,421
I have the money. I will bring it.

1290
01:20:51,499 --> 01:20:52,693
I don't want the money.

1291
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:55,269
I wanted to check
how smart you are.

1292
01:20:55,537 --> 01:20:57,095
But you turned out to be smarter.

1293
01:20:57,172 --> 01:20:58,901
You must do what I say.

1294
01:20:59,107 --> 01:21:01,268
What..? - He will do it.

1295
01:21:01,342 --> 01:21:03,902
Your auspicious period
has begun, do it.

1296
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,239
Do it.

1297
01:21:05,313 --> 01:21:09,807
Tell me. - I could've
told you over the phone..

1298
01:21:10,618 --> 01:21:13,143
..but there are chances that
the police can tap your phone.

1299
01:21:13,588 --> 01:21:14,953
So I didn't call you.

1300
01:21:15,757 --> 01:21:17,588
To check if anybody
was following you..

1301
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:20,184
..I called you to Forum Mall.

1302
01:21:20,828 --> 01:21:22,625
There is nobody.
- Not for Rs. 10 lakhs.

1303
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:25,857
But I confirmed that
nobody was following you.

1304
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:27,799
Anyway I will come to the matter.

1305
01:21:28,503 --> 01:21:29,527
Listen to me carefully.

1306
01:21:29,637 --> 01:21:31,571
I will give you 24 hours..

1307
01:21:31,873 --> 01:21:34,933
..you must kill Adishesha.

1308
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:39,674
If you don't kill him..

1309
01:21:39,914 --> 01:21:43,247
..I will give all the
details about you to Adishesha.

1310
01:21:43,952 --> 01:21:46,978
And you know what will
happen after if I do so.

1311
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:50,388
Don't waste your time
trying to check my capacity.

1312
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:52,320
So decide.

1313
01:21:52,594 --> 01:21:54,789
Do you want to die or kill him?

1314
01:21:56,064 --> 01:21:57,554
The choice is yours.

1315
01:21:58,866 --> 01:22:01,460
24 hours. Your time starts now.

1316
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:16,876
"Food to eat and water to drink."

1317
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:21,383
"A piece of cloth is
enough to protect my dignity."

1318
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:26,788
Who is she? She is wearing
Burka and sitting in my shop?

1319
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:28,385
Who are you?

1320
01:22:29,497 --> 01:22:31,522
Uncle. - It's you?

1321
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:33,658
Why are you wearing Burka?

1322
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:34,702
Take it off.

1323
01:22:34,936 --> 01:22:40,033
The time she gave is passing
by but you don't seem worried.

1324
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:44,138
Keep wandering about.
- Be quiet. - Idiots.

1325
01:22:45,713 --> 01:22:49,809
I'm worried but I don't want
to make it obvious. Get on the bike.

1326
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:50,781
Where to?

1327
01:22:50,852 --> 01:22:52,285
Where the bike takes us. Come on.

1328
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:04,421
The enemy of our
enemy is our friend.

1329
01:23:04,499 --> 01:23:07,627
If she wants Adishesha killed,
it means that he is her enemy.

1330
01:23:08,436 --> 01:23:09,164
What is it?

1331
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:11,296
We are from the Karnataka
Medical Society.

1332
01:23:11,406 --> 01:23:13,636
We are handicaps.
We are deaf and dumb.

1333
01:23:14,809 --> 01:23:17,277
Ma'am, you are only deaf and
dumb but we are going to die soon.

1334
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:18,778
You are better than us.

1335
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,072
Will she get us killed?

1336
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:23,345
If she gets us killed,
who will hire to kill Adishesha.

1337
01:23:23,418 --> 01:23:25,045
You talk rubbish. - Then?

1338
01:23:25,353 --> 01:23:30,416
There he is. Our boss
wants to meet you. Don't go.

1339
01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:32,558
It is Adi, right? - Where?

1340
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:33,753
Sitting in the front seat.

1341
01:23:34,762 --> 01:23:35,558
They are coming for us.

1342
01:23:37,231 --> 01:23:37,925
Don't go.

1343
01:23:38,032 --> 01:23:39,829
I'm innocent.

1344
01:23:40,702 --> 01:23:42,863
Don't go. You can't get away.

1345
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:48,240
Are you crazy? - Shut up.

1346
01:23:48,643 --> 01:23:50,474
To hell with you.

1347
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:53,411
No. - You left me alone? Idiot.

1348
01:23:53,514 --> 01:23:54,310
Get on the bike.

1349
01:23:55,116 --> 01:23:55,980
Come on.

1350
01:23:56,818 --> 01:23:58,649
Here they come.

1351
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:05,357
It is one way.

1352
01:24:40,428 --> 01:24:41,656
Get out of our way!

1353
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:11,623
They were after someone else.

1354
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,122
Let go.

1355
01:25:13,461 --> 01:25:14,587
Let go.

1356
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,391
No, boss. - Take it. Never mind.

1357
01:25:18,566 --> 01:25:21,399
No, boss. - It's the same brand
which the inspector offered you.

1358
01:25:21,469 --> 01:25:23,460
My friend..
- Let's get away before he sees us.

1359
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:25,301
Let's go.

1360
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:28,066
You don't have the courage
to even smoke before me..

1361
01:25:28,242 --> 01:25:29,470
..but you dare to give
testimony against me.

1362
01:25:29,544 --> 01:25:30,511
No.

1363
01:25:35,016 --> 01:25:35,880
Oh, no.

1364
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:38,814
Hurry up.

1365
01:25:41,222 --> 01:25:42,917
Come on. - Hey.

1366
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:44,220
Wait.

1367
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,427
Why are you running away seeing us?

1368
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,435
Why are you quiet? Speak.

1369
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:57,101
Are you dumb?

1370
01:26:02,043 --> 01:26:05,911
We are handicaps.
We are deaf and dumb.

1371
01:26:06,013 --> 01:26:09,915
This card was given by
the Karnataka Medical Society.

1372
01:26:09,984 --> 01:26:12,145
We request you to donate..

1373
01:26:12,553 --> 01:26:15,681
Adi, they are deaf and dumb.

1374
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:20,960
Your fly is open, sir.

1375
01:26:31,806 --> 01:26:33,865
The hero gets his speech
back after God appears before him.

1376
01:26:33,941 --> 01:26:35,841
You are God to him.

1377
01:26:36,244 --> 01:26:38,508
You got back your speech. - Shut up.

1378
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,939
Why did you lie to me?

1379
01:26:41,015 --> 01:26:42,710
I'm seeing a murder
for the first time..

1380
01:26:42,783 --> 01:26:44,751
..hence I lied to you
fearing you would kill me.

1381
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:46,514
Forgive me, sir. - Who are you?

1382
01:26:46,654 --> 01:26:47,712
My name is Shastri.

1383
01:26:47,788 --> 01:26:49,187
My father's name is Siddha Shastri.

1384
01:26:49,257 --> 01:26:50,849
His father's name
is Siddha Rood Shastri.

1385
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:53,620
He died even before I was born.
I'm so unlucky.

1386
01:26:53,794 --> 01:26:55,694
I'm an astrologer by profession.

1387
01:26:55,897 --> 01:26:58,661
If he kills me, he will be
committing a grave sin. Tell him.

1388
01:26:58,866 --> 01:27:01,391
Oh, my God. I'm scared.

1389
01:27:01,469 --> 01:27:05,872
Do you take us to be fools?
- Not you I'm a fool.

1390
01:27:05,973 --> 01:27:06,803
Tell him.

1391
01:27:07,675 --> 01:27:09,006
Hey. Who are you?

1392
01:27:09,844 --> 01:27:11,471
Who are you?
- Who am I? I don't know you.

1393
01:27:12,113 --> 01:27:14,047
I'm suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, sir.

1394
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:16,879
I forget what happened a while ago.

1395
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:19,145
I can't even see. Let go.

1396
01:27:20,154 --> 01:27:22,418
I think I've seen before. - Really?

1397
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,250
I don't remember.

1398
01:27:24,358 --> 01:27:26,758
You remind me of something..
- Let go off us.

1399
01:27:27,161 --> 01:27:28,253
You want to talk to Adi?

1400
01:27:29,664 --> 01:27:31,359
Adi, ACP on line.

1401
01:27:31,566 --> 01:27:33,363
He wants you to call
your phone which you lost.

1402
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:34,694
Yes, ACP?

1403
01:27:34,902 --> 01:27:36,767
I've summoned all the thieves
who steal phones in the city.

1404
01:27:37,038 --> 01:27:39,029
They know about 500
thieves who steal phones.

1405
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:42,400
If they recognize his voice..

1406
01:27:43,077 --> 01:27:44,840
..he will be finished. - Good.

1407
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:46,444
I will call my phone right now.

1408
01:27:49,884 --> 01:27:51,647
What do we do now?

1409
01:27:55,456 --> 01:27:56,047
Turn it off.

1410
01:27:58,593 --> 01:27:59,252
Stop it.

1411
01:27:59,794 --> 01:28:01,193
Once turned off it
doesn't start again.

1412
01:28:02,563 --> 01:28:03,791
Turn it off.

1413
01:28:04,799 --> 01:28:06,460
"Game." - Go. Get going.

1414
01:28:07,802 --> 01:28:08,826
Can we? - Go.

1415
01:28:09,604 --> 01:28:10,400
Get on the bike.

1416
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:14,835
Oh, my God.

1417
01:28:15,076 --> 01:28:15,906
Let's go.

1418
01:28:16,577 --> 01:28:19,045
They would've killed me.

1419
01:28:21,082 --> 01:28:23,073
Why are you laughing?

1420
01:28:23,918 --> 01:28:25,408
Hey. - Yes?

1421
01:28:26,187 --> 01:28:27,779
Take the phone from my pocket.

1422
01:28:32,059 --> 01:28:34,357
Hello, boss. - Shut up.

1423
01:28:34,595 --> 01:28:37,257
It is my duty to greet
the owner of my phone.

1424
01:28:37,765 --> 01:28:38,493
Where are you?

1425
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:40,894
Will you find me if
I told you where I am?

1426
01:28:41,202 --> 01:28:42,794
I did see it. - What did you see?

1427
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:45,595
You couldn't do anything
though I was right before you.

1428
01:28:46,907 --> 01:28:47,931
What will you do now?

1429
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:49,805
When did I see you?

1430
01:28:50,244 --> 01:28:51,575
Did you forget, boss?

1431
01:28:51,846 --> 01:28:54,041
I was not standing behind you..

1432
01:28:54,749 --> 01:28:56,376
..but right before you.

1433
01:28:56,784 --> 01:28:58,251
You idiot. - Hey.

1434
01:28:58,653 --> 01:28:59,984
Don't get angry.

1435
01:29:00,588 --> 01:29:05,423
By the way, what's making
you talk with me for so long?

1436
01:29:06,594 --> 01:29:09,893
Did that idiot,
the ACP give you an idea again?

1437
01:29:10,097 --> 01:29:12,065
You call me idiot?
Show some respect.

1438
01:29:12,266 --> 01:29:14,734
ACP, why did you talk?

1439
01:29:15,002 --> 01:29:17,095
He calls me 'idiot' and
you want me to tolerate it?

1440
01:29:17,304 --> 01:29:20,296
You give me an idea
and ruined it yourself.

1441
01:29:20,508 --> 01:29:23,068
He is right, you are an idiot.

1442
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:24,735
Adishesha, you too?

1443
01:29:24,845 --> 01:29:28,303
Listen to me, Mr. Adishesha.

1444
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:32,541
Though I come to your house,
sit on your dining table..

1445
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:34,411
..have food to the content..

1446
01:29:34,722 --> 01:29:36,280
..sleep in your
air conditioned room..

1447
01:29:36,357 --> 01:29:38,723
..and get myself
massaged by your men..

1448
01:29:38,793 --> 01:29:41,455
..you will never be able to nab me.

1449
01:29:41,662 --> 01:29:46,395
So I would suggest you
to hang up the phone. Okay?

1450
01:29:48,469 --> 01:29:51,131
I better put the phone
in silent mode. - Why?

1451
01:29:51,238 --> 01:29:53,468
What if they nab us by chance?
- Oh, no.

1452
01:30:00,314 --> 01:30:05,718
You killed the one
who came to me as approver.

1453
01:30:06,821 --> 01:30:09,790
Every dog has its day.

1454
01:30:10,124 --> 01:30:12,354
I will wait for it. Go.

1455
01:30:13,294 --> 01:30:16,263
Boss, you say you
will give me money..

1456
01:30:16,464 --> 01:30:19,524
..but God didn't give me eyes.

1457
01:30:19,834 --> 01:30:23,702
If I could see I would've
told you how the person looked..

1458
01:30:23,904 --> 01:30:26,464
..who came to call here.

1459
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:30,973
Adi, people like him have given
clues to the police many times.

1460
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:36,614
Alright. At that time
was someone with you?

1461
01:30:36,984 --> 01:30:37,882
No, sir.

1462
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:41,281
This is list of all the
outgoing and incoming calls..

1463
01:30:41,388 --> 01:30:43,185
..ever since your phone
went missing until the day..

1464
01:30:43,357 --> 01:30:45,791
..we three had conference call.

1465
01:30:45,993 --> 01:30:48,018
You made five calls,
I made three calls..

1466
01:30:48,095 --> 01:30:49,585
..and Wahab made
one call from Chennai.

1467
01:30:49,663 --> 01:30:51,028
Apart from those calls,
there were two incoming calls..

1468
01:30:51,098 --> 01:30:52,224
..from this STD booth.

1469
01:30:52,433 --> 01:30:54,492
One at 11:10 and the other at 11:22.

1470
01:30:54,702 --> 01:30:55,896
There was one chance, Adi.

1471
01:30:56,137 --> 01:31:00,130
Had he called your number through
his landline or mobile phone..

1472
01:31:00,207 --> 01:31:04,576
..we could've nabbed him and then
nabbed the one who stole your phone.

1473
01:31:05,045 --> 01:31:07,878
But this is public phone.

1474
01:31:08,516 --> 01:31:09,813
The one who works there is blind.

1475
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,010
Like we cannot see
the air that we breathe..

1476
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:14,849
..I guess we will not be able to
find the one who stole the mobile.

1477
01:31:16,056 --> 01:31:19,150
Only losers say that.

1478
01:31:19,426 --> 01:31:22,554
Do something. I want him.

1479
01:31:23,464 --> 01:31:24,795
Yes, doctor.

1480
01:31:24,865 --> 01:31:27,993
When colonel's daughter
was here last week to meet you..

1481
01:31:28,235 --> 01:31:30,863
..he managed to woo her.

1482
01:31:31,639 --> 01:31:35,336
I'm not a fool to watch someone
taking away my girl from me.

1483
01:31:35,543 --> 01:31:39,980
What did you say?
They both are getting married?

1484
01:31:40,347 --> 01:31:42,212
Just watch what I
will go there and do.

1485
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:48,955
"Dance, my world."

1486
01:31:53,727 --> 01:32:01,099
"I will die."

1487
01:32:20,588 --> 01:32:24,456
"On our way we found
a bump on the road."

1488
01:32:28,262 --> 01:32:32,460
"We met girls on our way."

1489
01:32:36,003 --> 01:32:39,439
"We are famous for losing our way."

1490
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,276
"I wonder why we meet these ladies."

1491
01:32:43,644 --> 01:32:47,011
"Someone sing the chorus loudly."

1492
01:32:47,414 --> 01:32:51,282
"Stop singing, brother."

1493
01:32:51,385 --> 01:32:53,250
"Get us pizza and burger."

1494
01:32:53,354 --> 01:32:55,447
"And take us to Kannada film."

1495
01:33:23,984 --> 01:33:27,784
"We behave ourselves when
we hear the sound of anklets."

1496
01:33:27,855 --> 01:33:31,951
"And we also dance thinking
the girl is alone."

1497
01:33:35,496 --> 01:33:39,227
"We will not look at you,
we will close our eyes."

1498
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:43,100
"Our favorite actress is Sridevi."

1499
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:50,875
"You want us to pamper you."

1500
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:54,779
"We want permission
once we cross 18."

1501
01:33:54,848 --> 01:33:58,011
"We don't lose our balance."

1502
01:33:58,419 --> 01:34:01,786
"Ladies shouldn't wink at us."

1503
01:34:02,623 --> 01:34:06,115
"Someone sing the chorus."

1504
01:34:06,193 --> 01:34:10,357
"Stop singing, brother."

1505
01:34:13,901 --> 01:34:15,835
"Get us Pepsi."

1506
01:34:15,903 --> 01:34:18,269
"Teach us Michael Jackson steps."

1507
01:34:58,345 --> 01:35:01,906
"On our way we found
a bump on the road."

1508
01:35:15,429 --> 01:35:17,761
"We met girls on our way."

1509
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,507
Doctor, what brings you here?

1510
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:03,472
He lives in Indra Nagar.

1511
01:36:03,744 --> 01:36:07,976
He wooed the girl I was
to marry and ruined my plans.

1512
01:36:08,082 --> 01:36:09,777
She is a millionaire.

1513
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:11,813
We should not spare him, Adishesha.

1514
01:36:12,019 --> 01:36:13,543
Kill him.

1515
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:18,148
I know how to marry
her after he dies.

1516
01:36:18,559 --> 01:36:19,992
I will give any sum of money.

1517
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:24,592
Surya Prakash,
you've helped me several times.

1518
01:36:25,265 --> 01:36:26,197
Don't worry.

1519
01:36:30,704 --> 01:36:32,103
Brother, didn't I tell you?

1520
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,808
There is some connection.

1521
01:36:35,075 --> 01:36:37,509
Some sort of vibration
after I saw him.

1522
01:36:38,278 --> 01:36:42,715
He will die in our hands.

1523
01:36:44,184 --> 01:36:44,912
Kill him.

1524
01:36:45,252 --> 01:36:46,412
My friend. - Yes?

1525
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,921
Your father-in-law sings
but doesn't know how to dance.

1526
01:36:50,023 --> 01:36:52,753
So what if he doesn't
know how to dance..

1527
01:36:54,027 --> 01:36:56,188
Are they Adishesha's men?

1528
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:59,929
He is your son, right? - Yes.

1529
01:37:00,767 --> 01:37:03,065
Who are you?
Why are you looking for him?

1530
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:04,703
He is a nice guy.

1531
01:37:04,972 --> 01:37:08,203
Do you know who your son
has locked horns with? - No.

1532
01:37:08,609 --> 01:37:10,907
You are a mere laundry man..

1533
01:37:11,011 --> 01:37:13,309
..but your son desires
to buy the whole area.

1534
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:16,143
You said the enemy
of our enemy is our friend.

1535
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,617
I'm sure she would've
informed Adishesha.

1536
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,788
Our boss met your
son in the afternoon.

1537
01:37:21,889 --> 01:37:24,357
If he knew the fact about
your son he would've finished him.

1538
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:25,857
But what did my son do?

1539
01:37:28,228 --> 01:37:30,992
I think she told him.

1540
01:37:31,298 --> 01:37:34,267
Tell me where's your son?
Else I will..

1541
01:39:15,035 --> 01:39:17,868
Who are those goons?
Why did they come looking for you?

1542
01:39:18,905 --> 01:39:20,839
Blackie, actually what happened is..

1543
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:21,902
Take your hands off.

1544
01:39:22,009 --> 01:39:26,673
Did I work hard and raise you..

1545
01:39:26,913 --> 01:39:30,178
..to watch you getting
killed by some goons?

1546
01:39:30,617 --> 01:39:35,953
Vishnu, if something happens to you,
I will die.

1547
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:41,620
I told you his inauspicious
period has begun. - Shut up. - Wait.

1548
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:44,021
Why are you getting so emotional?

1549
01:39:44,097 --> 01:39:45,394
Wipe your tears first.

1550
01:39:45,966 --> 01:39:47,194
Wipe your tears.

1551
01:39:47,901 --> 01:39:49,459
Stop crying.

1552
01:39:50,637 --> 01:39:54,232
Well, if you so emotional..

1553
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:56,934
..buy me a mobile. - Leave my hand.

1554
01:39:57,044 --> 01:40:00,502
You are never serious.
- That's right. Be like this.

1555
01:40:00,714 --> 01:40:03,774
Never cry again.
He talks too much. Let's go.

1556
01:40:03,984 --> 01:40:06,612
Oh, my God.

1557
01:40:07,454 --> 01:40:10,855
It is like a Pakistan
house in India.

1558
01:40:11,024 --> 01:40:13,356
Talk softly. - Whose house it this?

1559
01:40:14,895 --> 01:40:16,760
You will feel very
happy if I tell you.

1560
01:40:17,197 --> 01:40:18,255
Tell me.

1561
01:40:18,865 --> 01:40:20,924
It's Adishesha's house.

1562
01:40:21,034 --> 01:40:23,093
Why did you bring me here?

1563
01:40:23,603 --> 01:40:27,437
I'm scared. - You are such a coward.

1564
01:40:27,641 --> 01:40:29,370
I can nothing about it.

1565
01:40:29,543 --> 01:40:31,909
Listen to me. - Tell me.

1566
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:34,504
Look.. - Hurry up.

1567
01:40:34,715 --> 01:40:36,307
Let's go inside Adishesha's house..

1568
01:40:36,516 --> 01:40:41,146
..handover this phone to him and..

1569
01:40:41,388 --> 01:40:44,789
..also tell him that I have 1 crore
in my bike which you can take it.

1570
01:40:45,192 --> 01:40:50,220
Let's cry and touch his
feet and apologize to him.

1571
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:54,264
And then?
- And then he will get angry.

1572
01:40:54,334 --> 01:40:55,699
He will kill us.

1573
01:40:55,902 --> 01:40:57,164
Listen to me. - Tell me.

1574
01:40:57,471 --> 01:40:58,938
Once he gets angry..

1575
01:40:59,373 --> 01:41:02,865
..we will tell him that a
girl is threatening us to kill him.

1576
01:41:03,143 --> 01:41:05,577
We will tell him that
he is in the hit list.

1577
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,512
We will tell him that
we are not bad people.

1578
01:41:08,682 --> 01:41:11,446
We will request him to
save us by killing that girl.

1579
01:41:11,551 --> 01:41:12,950
And then?

1580
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:16,556
He will then get angry on that girl.

1581
01:41:16,757 --> 01:41:18,691
So will he spare us? - Don't..

1582
01:41:18,992 --> 01:41:20,619
He will not spare us. - What?

1583
01:41:20,694 --> 01:41:24,425
He will get us thrashed. - No.

1584
01:41:25,265 --> 01:41:27,096
I'm sorry. - Darn you.

1585
01:41:27,834 --> 01:41:31,531
I'm get more scared. - Shut up.

1586
01:41:32,038 --> 01:41:34,529
He will thrash us for few days and..

1587
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:36,438
..then release us once
his anger gets subsided.

1588
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:39,001
Idiot. Why should I
get thrashed because of you?

1589
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:40,407
I see.

1590
01:41:40,514 --> 01:41:44,644
I will remind you of something.

1591
01:41:45,018 --> 01:41:48,249
Do not interfere. Stay away. - No.

1592
01:41:48,355 --> 01:41:49,754
Let go. - I beg of you.

1593
01:41:49,823 --> 01:41:52,121
Let go. - No.

1594
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,021
You get it now?
Tie the string. - Okay.

1595
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,223
We need to get in now. Come on.

1596
01:41:58,365 --> 01:42:03,029
You go first. - No.
You go first this time. Come on.

1597
01:42:03,303 --> 01:42:05,737
It's dirty here.
- You dirtied the place.

1598
01:42:06,106 --> 01:42:07,073
Slowly.

1599
01:42:07,307 --> 01:42:10,105
He looked so weak.

1600
01:42:10,477 --> 01:42:13,537
When it comes to death even
a cat will fight like a tiger.

1601
01:42:13,947 --> 01:42:15,778
We relied on the ACP.

1602
01:42:15,982 --> 01:42:19,008
We couldn't find your phone.

1603
01:42:19,553 --> 01:42:22,386
What was the need to kill
him at such a critical situation?

1604
01:42:22,456 --> 01:42:25,857
You fool. We promised the
doctor that we will kill him.

1605
01:42:26,059 --> 01:42:29,153
I understand.
But still think about it.

1606
01:42:34,334 --> 01:42:35,301
Limbe Hannu.

1607
01:42:42,108 --> 01:42:43,473
The house is this way.
Why are you turning this side?

1608
01:42:43,643 --> 01:42:46,612
Look what's here.

1609
01:42:51,818 --> 01:42:55,879
My friend, you only mentioned
about getting thrashed..

1610
01:42:55,989 --> 01:42:57,047
..but not about getting bitten up.

1611
01:42:57,123 --> 01:42:58,454
I didn't know it either.

1612
01:42:59,626 --> 01:43:01,025
Now what?

1613
01:43:06,099 --> 01:43:08,499
Doggy. - Lord Narayana.

1614
01:43:09,903 --> 01:43:12,098
Robert. - Lord Govinda.

1615
01:43:14,808 --> 01:43:17,072
Johnny. - Lord Gomateshwara.

1616
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,148
What? - Give me the lime. - Lime?

1617
01:43:26,353 --> 01:43:27,945
Hurry up. - Take it.

1618
01:43:31,758 --> 01:43:32,622
Sweet.

1619
01:43:35,695 --> 01:43:36,821
Sweet.

1620
01:43:41,868 --> 01:43:43,028
Catch.

1621
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:44,432
Catch.

1622
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:46,663
Let's go.

1623
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:50,070
We also killed the
approver who was about to..

1624
01:43:50,143 --> 01:43:54,546
..give testimony in the court that we
killed Phoolchand in the hospital.

1625
01:43:54,814 --> 01:43:59,842
The inspector who is aware of all
this is planning to get us arrested.

1626
01:44:00,053 --> 01:44:03,079
When the situation is such what was
the need to commit another murder?

1627
01:44:03,356 --> 01:44:05,347
Come on. - Okay.

1628
01:44:07,527 --> 01:44:09,119
How did the lime come here?
- What's going on?

1629
01:44:12,465 --> 01:44:13,625
What is it?

1630
01:44:15,802 --> 01:44:17,201
What is it?

1631
01:44:19,539 --> 01:44:20,665
You want sweet?

1632
01:44:21,508 --> 01:44:22,907
You want to catch it again?

1633
01:44:24,444 --> 01:44:25,775
Even we have become dogs.

1634
01:44:26,546 --> 01:44:28,070
Catch.

1635
01:44:29,816 --> 01:44:31,784
The one who stole my mobile..

1636
01:44:32,519 --> 01:44:35,147
..though he is our enemy..

1637
01:44:35,956 --> 01:44:38,584
..he is a very committed
towards his job.

1638
01:44:39,092 --> 01:44:40,582
Call the guy who
is homeless and then..

1639
01:44:40,994 --> 01:44:42,791
What's his name? - Vishnu.

1640
01:44:42,862 --> 01:44:46,662
Give him his address
and ask him to kill Vishnu.

1641
01:44:47,133 --> 01:44:50,967
Tell him you will pay Rs.
50 lakhs after he kills him.

1642
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,338
My God. - God, protect us.

1643
01:44:57,577 --> 01:45:00,910
The one who stole
the phone will come..

1644
01:45:01,147 --> 01:45:03,741
..to kill the laundry man's
son for the greed of Rs. 50 lakhs.

1645
01:45:04,317 --> 01:45:08,720
Have our men follow the
laundry man everywhere he goes..

1646
01:45:09,322 --> 01:45:10,983
..and then let's nab him.

1647
01:45:13,226 --> 01:45:15,524
Aim two birds with one stone.

1648
01:45:18,365 --> 01:45:21,425
I have stomach problem.

1649
01:45:31,578 --> 01:45:33,170
There's nobody.

1650
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:40,415
Boss is at home, I'm coming outside.

1651
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:43,185
Limbe Hannu?

1652
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:45,214
Limbe Hannu?

1653
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:47,190
Limbe Hannu?

1654
01:45:48,294 --> 01:45:50,819
I will slap you.
- You created confusion.

1655
01:45:58,938 --> 01:45:59,563
Oh, no.

1656
01:46:00,974 --> 01:46:02,066
What are you doing?

1657
01:46:02,575 --> 01:46:05,066
If you wanted to apologize to him..

1658
01:46:05,145 --> 01:46:06,874
..then why didn't you
enter through the main gate?

1659
01:46:09,049 --> 01:46:10,414
You are right. - Yes.

1660
01:46:11,985 --> 01:46:13,213
You should've told me later.

1661
01:46:21,795 --> 01:46:22,853
What's your problem?

1662
01:46:26,166 --> 01:46:28,498
What's your problem? Please go.

1663
01:46:28,601 --> 01:46:30,330
Who let the dog inside?

1664
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:35,901
You want sweet?

1665
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:37,504
Go.

1666
01:46:38,044 --> 01:46:38,703
Go.

1667
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:46,185
Who is it?

1668
01:46:49,122 --> 01:46:50,180
Yes, boss?

1669
01:46:51,491 --> 01:46:54,255
You are the boss not he.

1670
01:46:54,694 --> 01:46:55,353
Tell me.

1671
01:46:55,428 --> 01:46:59,387
You seem to be in trouble.
You are talking softly.

1672
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:03,533
This is how one would feel when
he is under the stairway to hell.

1673
01:47:03,603 --> 01:47:04,797
Come to the point.

1674
01:47:05,004 --> 01:47:08,462
I want to you kill someone.

1675
01:47:08,775 --> 01:47:09,867
Kill whom?

1676
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:13,273
There is a laundry shop
in Indra Nagar called Puttiah.

1677
01:47:15,381 --> 01:47:17,975
So? - His son's name is Vishnu.

1678
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,175
You must kill him.

1679
01:47:21,387 --> 01:47:23,787
But why should I kill him, boss?

1680
01:47:24,157 --> 01:47:29,026
He managed to woo the girl
who Dr. Surya Prakash was to marry.

1681
01:47:29,129 --> 01:47:31,962
He is very upset about it.

1682
01:47:32,365 --> 01:47:36,199
If the doctor has to marry
her you must kill Vishnu.

1683
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:38,431
Is this the matter? - Yes.

1684
01:47:39,038 --> 01:47:41,871
Nothing else? - It's a small
job but you will be paid huge sum.

1685
01:47:41,941 --> 01:47:43,408
Rs. 50 lakhs again.

1686
01:47:44,844 --> 01:47:45,640
What is it?

1687
01:47:47,981 --> 01:47:49,949
Assume the job is over.

1688
01:47:50,583 --> 01:47:52,574
And one more thing.

1689
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,920
You could've done it yourself,
why did you tell me?

1690
01:47:55,989 --> 01:47:59,891
The job has been assigned
to you since it is a small job.

1691
01:48:00,059 --> 01:48:01,959
Alright, I will do it.

1692
01:48:04,397 --> 01:48:05,386
Come on.

1693
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:12,228
They got thrashed?

1694
01:48:12,438 --> 01:48:14,269
They got thrashed severely.

1695
01:48:14,374 --> 01:48:16,399
They couldn't hit a single man.

1696
01:48:16,476 --> 01:48:18,000
Where are they? - Outside.

1697
01:48:51,845 --> 01:48:52,539
Why did you come here?

1698
01:48:56,015 --> 01:48:56,743
What happened?

1699
01:48:57,917 --> 01:48:58,906
Meera, what happened?

1700
01:49:00,119 --> 01:49:01,347
Meera!

1701
01:49:01,888 --> 01:49:02,718
Open the door.

1702
01:49:03,323 --> 01:49:04,187
Meera, what happened?

1703
01:49:05,158 --> 01:49:06,090
Get in.

1704
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,018
What are you doing?

1705
01:49:08,962 --> 01:49:09,929
Open the door.

1706
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,792
Meera!

1707
01:49:12,398 --> 01:49:13,262
Meera!

1708
01:49:13,733 --> 01:49:15,257
Mee.. why did you scream?

1709
01:49:16,536 --> 01:49:18,663
I saw a cockroach while changing.

1710
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:26,101
You scream so loudly
for a mere cockroach?

1711
01:49:27,747 --> 01:49:29,146
Let's go. Come on.

1712
01:49:37,257 --> 01:49:38,189
Well..

1713
01:49:38,424 --> 01:49:40,449
I've seen hunters wait patiently
to hunt down the lion but for..

1714
01:49:41,327 --> 01:49:44,490
..the first time I'm seeing someone
enter its den to hunt it down.

1715
01:49:44,797 --> 01:49:48,893
I.. - Fearing me,
you came here to kill him, right?

1716
01:49:51,237 --> 01:49:53,432
Yes. - Good.

1717
01:49:54,073 --> 01:49:55,540
But you will not kill him here.

1718
01:49:57,844 --> 01:50:01,302
But you are here?

1719
01:50:01,381 --> 01:50:02,575
That's none of your business.

1720
01:50:03,816 --> 01:50:05,443
Just do what I say.

1721
01:50:06,953 --> 01:50:10,116
If you kill him here,
you can't get away.

1722
01:50:11,157 --> 01:50:12,624
So I will give you one more day.

1723
01:50:13,192 --> 01:50:14,557
Finish him by tomorrow.

1724
01:50:14,694 --> 01:50:20,257
I.. - Else, 9916202429.

1725
01:50:20,934 --> 01:50:23,300
The number.. - I will tell
him that you have it in your pocket.

1726
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:24,864
Understand? - Yes.

1727
01:50:26,339 --> 01:50:27,431
I will do it. - Go.

1728
01:50:34,013 --> 01:50:36,208
Hello? - Darn it.

1729
01:50:38,351 --> 01:50:40,216
The kitchen is on the right.

1730
01:50:40,386 --> 01:50:42,820
I.. - There is a small
gate near the kitchen.

1731
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:44,053
Go out through that gate.

1732
01:50:44,824 --> 01:50:48,055
You will be caught if
you take another way. - Okay.

1733
01:50:49,595 --> 01:50:52,860
Adi gives me money
and asks me to kill myself.

1734
01:50:53,466 --> 01:50:56,458
Whereas she wants him killed
though she stays in his house.

1735
01:50:56,970 --> 01:50:58,767
I don't get it.

1736
01:50:58,871 --> 01:51:01,237
Wait. The phone is ringing.

1737
01:51:01,541 --> 01:51:02,906
Check who is it.

1738
01:51:03,443 --> 01:51:04,307
It's Bharati.

1739
01:51:04,877 --> 01:51:05,434
Hello.

1740
01:51:13,019 --> 01:51:15,214
Vishnu, come, I will tell you.

1741
01:51:15,989 --> 01:51:19,652
After the function, sister
slipped and rolled down the stairs.

1742
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:21,588
Please go and treat her. - Me?

1743
01:51:21,661 --> 01:51:22,992
How..? - Please, Vishnu.

1744
01:51:23,262 --> 01:51:25,662
Is he the family doctor
you were talking about? - Yes.

1745
01:51:25,865 --> 01:51:26,593
Doctor, please come.

1746
01:51:27,734 --> 01:51:28,792
Please hurry.

1747
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,707
Come and take a look.

1748
01:51:35,775 --> 01:51:38,767
Not only the stomach but the womb has
also been ruptured in the accident.

1749
01:51:38,878 --> 01:51:40,937
Look, the infant's leg has come out.

1750
01:51:41,147 --> 01:51:43,581
They want us to save both,
how is it possible?

1751
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:44,839
I'm not God.

1752
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:47,244
The infant should pull its leg by
itself. I can't do anything about it.

1753
01:51:47,553 --> 01:51:49,418
It's only been 20 weeks.

1754
01:51:49,789 --> 01:51:52,587
Moreover,
the womb has not grown yet.

1755
01:51:52,859 --> 01:51:53,985
It's just a fetus.

1756
01:51:54,227 --> 01:51:56,024
They don't understand in
spite of telling them several times.

1757
01:51:56,829 --> 01:51:59,354
I've never come across such
a complicated case in my career.

1758
01:51:59,732 --> 01:52:00,494
You are doctor.

1759
01:52:00,867 --> 01:52:02,801
Go and make them understand. - Me?

1760
01:52:03,036 --> 01:52:04,401
Tell them if they want
their daughter to be alive..

1761
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:05,664
..they will have to lose the fetus.

1762
01:52:05,738 --> 01:52:07,638
Go and tell them, doctor.

1763
01:52:09,475 --> 01:52:11,568
Vishnu, they've been
telling the same thing..

1764
01:52:11,677 --> 01:52:12,871
..ever since she's
been hospitalized.

1765
01:52:12,945 --> 01:52:15,175
Please do something, Vishnu.
Please. - I..

1766
01:52:15,548 --> 01:52:19,109
Son-in-law, my daughter has
been destined to become a mother..

1767
01:52:19,385 --> 01:52:21,444
..after six years of marriage.

1768
01:52:21,954 --> 01:52:25,151
I forcefully brought
her from in-law's house..

1769
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:27,987
..just to give her
all the love and care.

1770
01:52:28,227 --> 01:52:30,787
She something happens to her,
I will die.

1771
01:52:30,997 --> 01:52:33,124
I will die. - Sir, just a minute.

1772
01:52:33,232 --> 01:52:37,862
Come here. If you still remain
quiet there will a lot problems.

1773
01:52:38,104 --> 01:52:40,095
Tell them you are not a doctor.

1774
01:52:40,306 --> 01:52:42,638
Else, you will be held
responsible for everything.

1775
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:44,869
Listen to me. Tell them the truth.

1776
01:52:45,812 --> 01:52:47,905
Come on, my friend.

1777
01:53:05,998 --> 01:53:10,492
Doctor, what is this? What
are you doing? This is sterile area.

1778
01:53:11,904 --> 01:53:13,496
Doctor, no. Don't do that.

1779
01:53:13,906 --> 01:53:17,307
Doctor, no. Don't do that.

1780
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:30,951
Doctor, I can't believe this.
I will take over from here.

1781
01:53:31,023 --> 01:53:35,221
Doctor, at such young age
you did something which I couldn't.

1782
01:53:35,561 --> 01:53:37,461
Thanks a lot.

1783
01:53:46,739 --> 01:53:47,763
Vishnu.

1784
01:53:48,241 --> 01:53:53,338
Son-in-law, you came like
God and saved my daughter.

1785
01:53:53,613 --> 01:53:56,741
My family is always indebted to you.

1786
01:53:56,816 --> 01:53:58,443
My family is always
indebted to you. - Sir.

1787
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:00,018
You are my God. Don't stop me.

1788
01:54:00,219 --> 01:54:01,686
You are my God. - Sir, listen to me.

1789
01:54:01,754 --> 01:54:03,654
You are my God. - Sir, listen to me.

1790
01:54:03,756 --> 01:54:04,950
Sir.. - You are my God.

1791
01:54:05,024 --> 01:54:06,548
I'm not a doctor, sir.

1792
01:54:06,626 --> 01:54:08,321
I'm not a doctor, sir.

1793
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:15,095
I'm not a doctor, sir.

1794
01:54:18,804 --> 01:54:23,605
I'm your laundry man Putta's son.

1795
01:54:26,646 --> 01:54:30,082
When I came to your
house to deliver clothes..

1796
01:54:30,616 --> 01:54:34,211
..I liked your daughter
Bharati very much.

1797
01:54:39,025 --> 01:54:40,617
I fell in deep love with her.

1798
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:50,069
But.. I lacked the
courage to tell you.

1799
01:54:50,469 --> 01:54:52,232
I'm a laundry man's son.

1800
01:54:52,772 --> 01:54:58,733
I learnt that she was
to marry a doctor, so..

1801
01:54:59,745 --> 01:55:02,236
..I pretended as a doctor.

1802
01:55:02,915 --> 01:55:06,783
I feared of losing her.

1803
01:55:08,621 --> 01:55:10,646
You shouldn't touch my feet, sir.

1804
01:55:10,923 --> 01:55:13,414
Instead, I should but I won't.

1805
01:55:13,793 --> 01:55:18,594
Don't forgive me.

1806
01:55:20,199 --> 01:55:21,996
Don't forgive me.

1807
01:56:10,416 --> 01:56:12,475
If you are a real
man come before me.

1808
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:15,212
I'm not a real man. Let it be.

1809
01:56:15,955 --> 01:56:16,944
But you are real man.

1810
01:56:25,564 --> 01:56:27,031
Adi, what happened?

1811
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,458
Adi, what happened? Adi.

1812
01:56:28,768 --> 01:56:32,670
I want him. - As you said
I've showed the greed of money.

1813
01:56:33,205 --> 01:56:35,435
He will come to kill
the laundry man for sure.

1814
01:56:36,275 --> 01:56:40,302
Our men are following all day long.

1815
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:46,117
My friend, your auspicious
period has now begun.

1816
01:56:46,252 --> 01:56:49,619
Your good time now begins.
- Shut up.

1817
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:54,656
You are doctor?

1818
01:56:56,195 --> 01:56:58,857
You cure the hole in the heart.

1819
01:56:59,398 --> 01:57:02,333
You save the one who
jumps off from the 13th floor.

1820
01:57:02,968 --> 01:57:05,061
You gain fame by
saving someone child..

1821
01:57:05,171 --> 01:57:06,365
..and give her a name.

1822
01:57:07,106 --> 01:57:09,097
Moreover, my name.

1823
01:57:10,076 --> 01:57:11,703
We are here to nab the
thief who stole the mobile..

1824
01:57:11,811 --> 01:57:13,244
..but there's family
sentiments going on.

1825
01:57:13,312 --> 01:57:17,544
The love which begins on the
basis of lies is never love at all.

1826
01:57:18,818 --> 01:57:22,151
I don't the love which
has not truthfulness in it.

1827
01:57:23,789 --> 01:57:27,316
If you fear of being to shame
don't you ever try to meet me.

1828
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:38,466
My friend, she stopped.

1829
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:51,341
Hello, you think only
you know how to act?

1830
01:57:52,818 --> 01:57:54,911
Did you like my performance?

1831
01:57:55,321 --> 01:57:57,846
Do you know who the director
of this drama is? - It's me.

1832
01:57:58,057 --> 01:58:00,719
This is how a heroine's
performance should be.

1833
01:58:01,927 --> 01:58:04,987
I asked her to overact
after slapping your face..

1834
01:58:05,197 --> 01:58:09,395
..but she acted so
well like a drama queen.

1835
01:58:09,602 --> 01:58:11,695
She always wanted
to marry a doctor..

1836
01:58:11,971 --> 01:58:17,273
..but I never thought you'd come
into her life like 'Munnabhai MBBS'.

1837
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:22,042
You are the God who gave
a new life to my daughter.

1838
01:58:22,381 --> 01:58:25,077
So you are a doctor to us.

1839
01:58:25,384 --> 01:58:29,286
Above all,
your name is Vishnu Vardhana..

1840
01:58:29,955 --> 01:58:32,253
..and that's enough for
you to become my son-in-law.

1841
01:58:33,192 --> 01:58:35,990
I will thank God.

1842
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:36,925
Go on.

1843
01:58:38,264 --> 01:58:40,095
My prediction turned
out to be right.

1844
01:58:42,301 --> 01:58:43,700
He agreed.

1845
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:55,339
I guess there's going
to be a song now.

1846
01:58:55,414 --> 01:58:56,312
What do we do now?

1847
01:58:56,382 --> 01:58:59,215
We will follow them in the song too.

1848
01:59:22,708 --> 01:59:26,405
"The guitar in my heart says ding,
ding, ding."

1849
01:59:26,679 --> 01:59:30,376
"When I come before
her I hear an old song."

1850
01:59:38,424 --> 01:59:42,121
"The guitar in my heart says ding,
ding, ding."

1851
01:59:42,194 --> 01:59:45,994
"When I come before
her I hear an old song."

1852
01:59:46,065 --> 01:59:48,761
"Come to me."

1853
01:59:49,502 --> 01:59:52,596
"Come to me."

1854
01:59:53,906 --> 02:00:01,506
"I can never be away
from a guy like you."

1855
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:05,311
"We two make a smart couple."

1856
02:00:40,853 --> 02:00:44,311
"Hello, Mr.
Vishnu vardhana. Do you like me?"

1857
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:48,251
"You sing for me even under the
hot sun, do you like me so much?"

1858
02:00:48,327 --> 02:00:52,491
"Let me tell you.
You are my beloved."

1859
02:00:52,565 --> 02:00:56,433
"I will bring you a golden deer."

1860
02:00:56,502 --> 02:00:58,333
"Shall I kiss you? - Right."

1861
02:00:58,404 --> 02:01:00,338
"Shall I give you my photograph?
- Wrong."

1862
02:01:02,308 --> 02:01:04,139
"You pinch me. - Wrong."

1863
02:01:55,027 --> 02:01:58,519
"You are the hoodlum
to all the goons in the city."

1864
02:01:58,897 --> 02:02:02,230
"You are kiddo in
front of this girl."

1865
02:02:02,568 --> 02:02:06,470
"Love is my life."

1866
02:02:06,538 --> 02:02:10,565
"Everyone call me a colorful top."

1867
02:02:10,676 --> 02:02:12,507
"I'm in love. - Right."

1868
02:02:12,578 --> 02:02:14,409
"I don't know how. - Wrong."

1869
02:02:14,513 --> 02:02:16,481
"Mr. Perfect. - Right."

1870
02:02:16,548 --> 02:02:18,345
"No, decent. - Wrong."

1871
02:02:34,133 --> 02:02:37,899
"He sings the national
anthem perfectly."

1872
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:41,872
"He chants the rituals even
though he didn't practice it."

1873
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:44,500
"Hey Vardhana."

1874
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:49,303
"Vishnu Vardhana."

1875
02:03:05,197 --> 02:03:06,255
Let's sit.

1876
02:03:32,024 --> 02:03:34,254
He is inside. - Who are you?

1877
02:03:34,359 --> 02:03:36,850
Why are you hitting me?
- Open the door.

1878
02:03:37,129 --> 02:03:38,061
Open the door.

1879
02:03:41,033 --> 02:03:42,000
What happened?

1880
02:03:50,609 --> 02:03:51,940
Oh, no.

1881
02:03:53,412 --> 02:03:55,744
So this is the mask he was wearing?

1882
02:03:56,248 --> 02:03:57,408
Yes, sir.

1883
02:03:58,050 --> 02:03:59,415
Did you see him?

1884
02:04:00,185 --> 02:04:01,311
You mean Spiderman?

1885
02:04:01,787 --> 02:04:03,220
I've seen him on TV.

1886
02:04:05,023 --> 02:04:06,991
I'm talking about the
one who was wearing the mask?

1887
02:04:09,027 --> 02:04:10,016
I did see him?

1888
02:04:10,262 --> 02:04:11,695
Have you seen him before?

1889
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,866
I've seen..

1890
02:04:17,269 --> 02:04:20,932
I've seen him. - Where?

1891
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:23,333
I saw him in Indra Nagar.

1892
02:04:23,609 --> 02:04:27,170
He came to kill you
but why did he run away?

1893
02:04:27,312 --> 02:04:29,143
He's a coward.

1894
02:04:29,214 --> 02:04:31,409
He only looks strong.

1895
02:04:31,517 --> 02:04:34,418
Had I nabbed him
I would've thrashed him.

1896
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,147
I got his mask.

1897
02:04:36,221 --> 02:04:38,416
He ran away when I saw his face.

1898
02:04:38,624 --> 02:04:40,353
Then your men brought me here.

1899
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:46,327
I now understood. - Really, sir.

1900
02:04:46,732 --> 02:04:48,461
Will you be able to recognize him?

1901
02:04:48,934 --> 02:04:53,496
Of course. When I stand
in front of the mirror I see him.

1902
02:04:53,705 --> 02:04:55,536
That's enough for me. - I see.

1903
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,709
I will nab him.

1904
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:00,075
Until then you will stay with me.

1905
02:05:01,313 --> 02:05:02,143
What did you say?

1906
02:05:02,514 --> 02:05:04,141
You want me to stay with you?

1907
02:05:06,084 --> 02:05:08,143
Okay. Hold this.

1908
02:05:10,656 --> 02:05:12,146
The problem is..

1909
02:05:13,425 --> 02:05:17,862
..actually I might
be the laundry man's son.

1910
02:05:18,230 --> 02:05:22,758
But my friend stays in air
conditioned room in the vicinity.

1911
02:05:23,035 --> 02:05:25,697
I sleep only in air
conditioned room in the night.

1912
02:05:25,904 --> 02:05:29,704
I don't want to trouble you.
I will go.

1913
02:05:29,808 --> 02:05:31,435
Hey. - Yes, sir?

1914
02:05:31,910 --> 02:05:34,538
There's air condition
even in the bathroom. - Really?

1915
02:05:35,614 --> 02:05:37,639
Turn on the air condition
for sir in the guesthouse.

1916
02:05:37,749 --> 02:05:39,580
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1917
02:05:39,818 --> 02:05:41,308
There's another problem.
- What is it?

1918
02:05:41,386 --> 02:05:43,752
I only sleep in
air conditioned room.

1919
02:05:44,223 --> 02:05:52,824
But for dinner,
I only have pilaf, chicken..

1920
02:05:53,232 --> 02:05:54,893
I'm laundry man's son.

1921
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,025
So don't trouble yourself.
I will go.

1922
02:05:57,102 --> 02:05:58,262
Hey. - Yes, sir?

1923
02:05:58,337 --> 02:05:59,326
There's a hotel in the vicinity.

1924
02:05:59,438 --> 02:06:01,872
You can have anything you want.
- Really?

1925
02:06:02,441 --> 02:06:03,840
Are you sure? - Yes.

1926
02:06:04,643 --> 02:06:07,237
No, sir. I have another problem.

1927
02:06:07,579 --> 02:06:09,103
I don't to trouble you.

1928
02:06:09,514 --> 02:06:10,538
Give that to me.

1929
02:06:11,383 --> 02:06:16,116
Actually, I only sleep
in air conditioned room..

1930
02:06:16,188 --> 02:06:18,713
..and eat only non vegetarian food..

1931
02:06:19,658 --> 02:06:23,321
..but, sir.. hold it please.

1932
02:06:23,795 --> 02:06:26,787
Since my stomach will
be full after having dinner..

1933
02:06:26,865 --> 02:06:28,890
..I get sleep only
if I get a body massage.

1934
02:06:29,001 --> 02:06:30,832
But I'm laundry man's son.

1935
02:06:31,069 --> 02:06:33,094
So I don't want to trouble you.

1936
02:06:33,305 --> 02:06:35,330
I will go. - Hey. - Yes, sir?

1937
02:06:35,674 --> 02:06:39,132
Our men will give you a massage.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1938
02:06:39,478 --> 02:06:41,571
They should massage only
my body not strangle my neck.

1939
02:06:43,282 --> 02:06:44,442
Give that to me.

1940
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:45,973
Thank you, sir.

1941
02:06:46,218 --> 02:06:48,982
I agree to stay here.

1942
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:56,218
Hello.

1943
02:06:58,330 --> 02:06:59,319
I knew you would come.

1944
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:01,626
The butcher never spares the goat.

1945
02:07:02,434 --> 02:07:04,425
Why did you come here again?

1946
02:07:05,704 --> 02:07:08,366
I'm here to tell you
that I cannot kill him.

1947
02:07:08,774 --> 02:07:09,433
Got it?

1948
02:07:11,043 --> 02:07:16,572
You are threatening me
for stealing a mere phone..

1949
02:07:16,982 --> 02:07:18,540
..and if I kill him,
I will be done for.

1950
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:21,150
You are smart.

1951
02:07:21,987 --> 02:07:25,718
There should be only two
reasons for killing husband.

1952
02:07:25,991 --> 02:07:29,222
One is money and the other is..

1953
02:07:30,395 --> 02:07:34,297
..you must be having
an affair with another man.

1954
02:07:35,901 --> 02:07:37,664
If you want me let me know.

1955
02:07:38,136 --> 02:07:42,197
I have 1 crore and
it belongs to your husband.

1956
02:07:42,474 --> 02:07:45,170
I will give it to you
do whatever you want with it.

1957
02:07:45,377 --> 02:07:47,345
Tell me if you have
an affair with another man.

1958
02:07:47,412 --> 02:07:49,277
I will somehow unite you both.

1959
02:07:49,514 --> 02:07:51,311
Why are you troubling me?

1960
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:55,110
Don't talk rubbish.

1961
02:07:55,721 --> 02:07:57,552
Can money and lust
be the only reasons..

1962
02:07:58,056 --> 02:07:59,580
..if a woman wants to kill someone?

1963
02:08:01,159 --> 02:08:07,723
You are spoilt brat. You will
never understand a woman's feelings.

1964
02:08:13,805 --> 02:08:16,433
I'm not asking you to kill him
so that I can lead a peaceful life.

1965
02:08:18,110 --> 02:08:19,634
I want to die in peace.

1966
02:09:15,367 --> 02:09:19,235
Adi came to meet the college
principal to discuss a problem.

1967
02:09:20,038 --> 02:09:23,496
After seeing me dance in the
cultural he proposed me immediately.

1968
02:09:24,009 --> 02:09:27,308
When I thought an infamous
hoodlum proposed me..

1969
02:09:27,946 --> 02:09:28,776
..I felt proud.

1970
02:09:31,316 --> 02:09:33,216
But my family opposed the proposal.

1971
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:38,712
I came leaving behind
everyone for Adi.

1972
02:10:24,035 --> 02:10:24,694
Hey.

1973
02:10:24,903 --> 02:10:28,862
I wanted to reform him.

1974
02:10:31,943 --> 02:10:35,435
Our dealings were taking
place outside for days.

1975
02:10:36,348 --> 02:10:40,978
But today, ACP has come to my house.

1976
02:10:41,553 --> 02:10:44,420
My juniors have
reached higher levels.

1977
02:10:45,023 --> 02:10:47,856
But I think I will retire
as an ordinary officer.

1978
02:10:49,294 --> 02:10:50,761
Don't worry.

1979
02:10:51,029 --> 02:10:53,725
Find out who is responsible
for their promotions.

1980
02:10:53,899 --> 02:10:55,332
Nobody is responsible
for their promotions.

1981
02:10:55,433 --> 02:10:58,368
They nab goons, kill them,
the public and media support them..

1982
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:59,698
..and the government promotes them.

1983
02:11:00,005 --> 02:11:02,838
So why don't you kill some goons?

1984
02:11:02,908 --> 02:11:04,967
If I kill one goon that's enough.

1985
02:11:05,177 --> 02:11:06,906
Then why don't you do it?
- That's why I'm here.

1986
02:11:08,146 --> 02:11:08,510
Hey.

1987
02:11:09,214 --> 02:11:14,447
Hey. If you kill me you
will not go out from here alive.

1988
02:11:14,653 --> 02:11:18,612
If I kill the boss,
your men can cause no harm to me.

1989
02:11:18,857 --> 02:11:20,017
You will die today.

1990
02:11:21,693 --> 02:11:23,024
Who do you think you
are pointing the gun at?

1991
02:11:23,228 --> 02:11:25,389
To your boss who's been
supporting you all these days?

1992
02:11:25,897 --> 02:11:27,592
He got you a bungalow.

1993
02:11:27,866 --> 02:11:29,458
He sponsored world tour
for you and your mistresses.

1994
02:11:29,534 --> 02:11:31,161
He bought bike for your son.

1995
02:11:31,336 --> 02:11:33,896
You want Adishesha's money
to fulfill all your desires.

1996
02:11:34,105 --> 02:11:37,199
And now you want to
kill just to gain promotion?

1997
02:11:37,309 --> 02:11:38,207
Darn you.

1998
02:11:38,677 --> 02:11:40,941
You want promotion, isn't it?
Arrest him.

1999
02:11:41,012 --> 02:11:43,981
File a case,
go to court, get him punished.

2000
02:11:44,416 --> 02:11:47,180
Whether you go to high
court or supreme court..

2001
02:11:47,252 --> 02:11:49,982
..I know how to get him
released hiring the best lawyer.

2002
02:11:50,222 --> 02:11:53,282
Until I'm there you
can't do anything to him.

2003
02:11:53,825 --> 02:11:56,225
If you still want
to kill Adishesha..

2004
02:11:56,294 --> 02:11:57,261
..kill me first.

2005
02:11:59,130 --> 02:11:59,926
Kill me.

2006
02:12:02,033 --> 02:12:08,836
I so happy that there is
someone who can do anything for me.

2007
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,701
Admitting a mistake
is the greatest thing.

2008
02:12:11,676 --> 02:12:15,772
And I wish to see that
greatest thing in you, Adi.

2009
02:12:18,516 --> 02:12:21,644
If you surrender,
the punishment will be reduced.

2010
02:12:23,154 --> 02:12:24,621
We are still young.

2011
02:12:25,357 --> 02:12:31,921
After you get released, I
wish to live a happy life with you..

2012
02:12:33,031 --> 02:12:34,896
..until my last breathe.

2013
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,934
You are right, darling.

2014
02:12:38,903 --> 02:12:41,133
But ACP doesn't..

2015
02:12:41,906 --> 02:12:44,773
..want me to reform at all.

2016
02:12:46,611 --> 02:12:48,772
He wants to make a deal with me.

2017
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:51,205
He asked me directly.

2018
02:12:52,617 --> 02:12:55,381
Is he demanding for a huge sum?
- I felt that same.

2019
02:12:55,654 --> 02:12:59,385
But to spare me alive..

2020
02:13:00,825 --> 02:13:01,849
..he wants you.

2021
02:13:02,727 --> 02:13:03,694
What?

2022
02:13:05,997 --> 02:13:08,898
What did you do to him?
Did you hack him to death?

2023
02:13:09,301 --> 02:13:10,461
Did you shoot him?

2024
02:13:10,869 --> 02:13:12,336
Adi, tell me what did you do to him?

2025
02:13:12,804 --> 02:13:14,738
I agreed to the deal.

2026
02:13:21,713 --> 02:13:23,578
Adi..

2027
02:13:31,056 --> 02:13:34,685
I feel dizzy after
hearing what you just said.

2028
02:13:34,893 --> 02:13:37,054
Not after hearing what I said..

2029
02:13:37,462 --> 02:13:38,724
..but you're feeling dizzy
after eating something..

2030
02:13:38,830 --> 02:13:39,888
..which I fed you with love.

2031
02:13:41,499 --> 02:13:44,662
I spiked the dish.

2032
02:13:46,838 --> 02:13:51,138
Thinking you were a bravo I came
to you leaving everything behind.

2033
02:13:54,512 --> 02:13:55,638
No, Adi.

2034
02:13:56,548 --> 02:14:00,075
Let's die rather than
leading such a lowly life.

2035
02:14:00,185 --> 02:14:00,776
Hey.

2036
02:14:01,353 --> 02:14:04,117
You die if you want to.
I want to live.

2037
02:14:05,323 --> 02:14:07,553
There's just one way out.

2038
02:14:13,865 --> 02:14:15,264
Adi.

2039
02:14:23,641 --> 02:14:25,541
Please don't do that.

2040
02:14:26,678 --> 02:14:29,511
Please don't do that to me.

2041
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:39,215
You seem very relaxed.
Did you like his company?

2042
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:44,927
Hereafter, ACP will not disturb us.

2043
02:14:45,296 --> 02:14:49,255
I've recorded whatever
happened in the room.

2044
02:14:50,268 --> 02:14:51,257
Take a look.

2045
02:14:58,309 --> 02:15:00,209
"Game.."

2046
02:15:00,779 --> 02:15:01,302
Hello?

2047
02:15:01,546 --> 02:15:03,275
Boss, there was a small
problem in the hospital.

2048
02:15:03,348 --> 02:15:04,940
We've been arrested by the police.

2049
02:15:05,116 --> 02:15:07,016
Darn you.

2050
02:15:07,318 --> 02:15:08,615
Which police station?

2051
02:15:12,991 --> 02:15:14,856
Why did Adishesha come here?

2052
02:15:15,026 --> 02:15:17,551
There was a fight between
Puttiah's son Vishnu..

2053
02:15:17,629 --> 02:15:21,190
..from Indra Nagar
and Adishesha's men.

2054
02:15:21,399 --> 02:15:22,491
Who is in the police station?

2055
02:15:23,468 --> 02:15:25,436
What are you doing here? Get out.

2056
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,719
Go home straight and
from there go to Kalasipalya.

2057
02:15:42,587 --> 02:15:44,612
They day ACP touched me..

2058
02:15:45,623 --> 02:15:46,988
..I was dead.

2059
02:15:49,894 --> 02:15:53,830
But I will not die
unless I kill them both.

2060
02:15:56,534 --> 02:15:58,627
I know it is impossible.

2061
02:15:59,537 --> 02:16:03,906
But after seeing you taking
Adi's phone is felt it was possible.

2062
02:16:05,076 --> 02:16:07,544
Promise me you will kill them.

2063
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:11,378
I will die right now before you.
- What..?

2064
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:15,980
You shouldn't die.

2065
02:16:16,921 --> 02:16:18,548
But they should die.

2066
02:16:21,759 --> 02:16:23,624
It is said that everything
happens for a reason.

2067
02:16:24,863 --> 02:16:28,094
I guess the God you trust
made me take the phone.

2068
02:16:29,267 --> 02:16:31,599
His order is that I save you.

2069
02:16:32,237 --> 02:16:34,000
And it is my duty to obey it.

2070
02:16:36,441 --> 02:16:42,402
But when I took the phone
I didn't know you were involved.

2071
02:16:42,747 --> 02:16:43,645
Even now I don't know.

2072
02:16:43,915 --> 02:16:46,315
I didn't see you either. Believe me.

2073
02:16:50,788 --> 02:16:58,092
Girls in this modern age
desire to get married to rich guys..

2074
02:16:58,196 --> 02:17:05,796
..but you desired to marry
a hoodlum just to reform him.

2075
02:17:10,875 --> 02:17:13,036
You shouldn't die.

2076
02:17:14,345 --> 02:17:16,973
When there is dust in your eyes,
you clean it..

2077
02:17:21,786 --> 02:17:24,118
..but you don't gouge out your eyes.

2078
02:17:24,522 --> 02:17:27,958
There is a life for you outside.
You have a family.

2079
02:17:31,062 --> 02:17:33,189
I will stand by you.

2080
02:17:33,798 --> 02:17:36,028
I will finish them somehow.

2081
02:17:37,068 --> 02:17:38,330
I promise you.

2082
02:17:39,270 --> 02:17:41,670
Promise me that you
will not die, please.

2083
02:17:49,814 --> 02:17:53,716
First of all, delete the
obscene video from the phone.

2084
02:17:53,851 --> 02:17:57,184
It isn't an obscene
video but a weapon.

2085
02:18:11,436 --> 02:18:14,166
Hello? - Sir,
I'm calling from Udaya TV.

2086
02:18:14,372 --> 02:18:18,331
I have your CD.
Your performance is incredible.

2087
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:21,039
When you can call
from Airtel office..

2088
02:18:21,112 --> 02:18:22,340
..can't I call from Udaya TV?

2089
02:18:22,647 --> 02:18:24,012
Why are you troubling me?

2090
02:18:24,115 --> 02:18:26,549
I'm giving you 20 minutes
and not even one second more.

2091
02:18:26,918 --> 02:18:29,944
You must kill Adishesha.

2092
02:18:31,322 --> 02:18:32,914
And if you don't..

2093
02:18:33,224 --> 02:18:36,853
..the CD in which you've
put up extra ordinary performance..

2094
02:18:37,095 --> 02:18:39,563
..I will release it worldwide.

2095
02:18:43,935 --> 02:18:46,597
I only released
the ordinary weapon..

2096
02:18:47,438 --> 02:18:50,271
..and now I will release
the strongest weapon.

2097
02:18:52,276 --> 02:18:54,141
Hello? - Boss Adi.

2098
02:18:54,278 --> 02:18:55,609
You are very smart.

2099
02:18:56,681 --> 02:18:58,911
You asked me to kill
the laundry man's son..

2100
02:18:58,983 --> 02:19:03,079
..but since he saw my face
you brought him to your house.

2101
02:19:03,154 --> 02:19:04,815
You are very smart.

2102
02:19:04,922 --> 02:19:06,685
You are right.

2103
02:19:06,758 --> 02:19:12,321
Boss, ACP is coming to your
house in 10 minutes to kill you.

2104
02:19:12,530 --> 02:19:13,326
Did you like the twist?

2105
02:19:14,065 --> 02:19:17,626
ACP will never come to kill me.

2106
02:19:17,702 --> 02:19:19,169
Boss. - Yes?

2107
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:20,166
ACP has come.

2108
02:19:23,274 --> 02:19:25,401
Boss, why did you get scared?

2109
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:28,874
The game now begins.

2110
02:19:37,555 --> 02:19:38,920
Hi, ACP. - Hey Adi!

2111
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:40,389
Did you like my mimicry?

2112
02:19:44,762 --> 02:19:47,822
You always had a desire
to shoot someone, right? - Yes.

2113
02:19:48,166 --> 02:19:49,360
Then take a chance.

2114
02:19:49,834 --> 02:19:53,235
If ACP doesn't hit me,
shoot him. - Okay.

2115
02:20:07,518 --> 02:20:10,612
Adi, I was out of my mind.
Please spare me.

2116
02:20:10,822 --> 02:20:12,084
Adi, please listen to me.

2117
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:12,756
Hello?

2118
02:20:12,824 --> 02:20:15,224
This is Keshava here. - What is it?

2119
02:20:15,293 --> 02:20:18,888
You can now find out
who called the other day.

2120
02:20:18,996 --> 02:20:20,486
The other day you
said it is impossible..

2121
02:20:20,698 --> 02:20:21,892
..but today you say it is possible?

2122
02:20:21,999 --> 02:20:25,833
There is an ATM machine
opposite to the phone booth.

2123
02:20:25,903 --> 02:20:30,340
The security guard just
told that two months' footage..

2124
02:20:30,408 --> 02:20:33,400
..will be recorded
in the ATM centre.

2125
02:20:33,745 --> 02:20:38,045
He said the camera
is facing the phone booth.

2126
02:20:38,382 --> 02:20:43,149
If you come here you can find
out who called you the other day.

2127
02:20:43,688 --> 02:20:45,212
I will come right away.

2128
02:20:45,456 --> 02:20:47,481
You are lucky. Come on.

2129
02:20:49,827 --> 02:20:50,816
Vishnu!

2130
02:20:52,964 --> 02:20:54,022
Sir? - Get in the car.

2131
02:20:54,465 --> 02:20:56,057
Where to? - Get in, I will tell you.

2132
02:20:56,667 --> 02:20:57,964
Boss. - You stay here.

2133
02:21:03,841 --> 02:21:06,537
Someone had called twice
from the booth here in the mall..

2134
02:21:06,644 --> 02:21:08,475
..to the person who
hit you in the bathroom..

2135
02:21:08,679 --> 02:21:10,203
..and to my phone which is missing.

2136
02:21:10,448 --> 02:21:12,939
We will get to know the
person after seeing the video.

2137
02:21:13,251 --> 02:21:15,151
If we nab him we can
nab the other person too.

2138
02:21:15,386 --> 02:21:16,717
See if you know him.

2139
02:21:24,929 --> 02:21:27,193
The person we are looking for
made a phone call from this booth..

2140
02:21:27,265 --> 02:21:29,392
..on the 12th of this
month at 11:10. Please check.

2141
02:21:36,307 --> 02:21:37,968
Why is the head cut in the video?

2142
02:21:38,075 --> 02:21:42,569
It is because of the
roof of the ATM centre.

2143
02:21:42,814 --> 02:21:43,644
Darn it.

2144
02:21:45,683 --> 02:21:47,344
What happened, sir?

2145
02:21:47,952 --> 02:21:49,647
It's a girl.

2146
02:21:50,588 --> 02:21:53,056
Go to 11:22.
Let's see if it is the same girl.

2147
02:21:53,257 --> 02:21:55,452
Boss, if it not clear
in the previous video..

2148
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:58,458
..it will not be clear even
this too. Don't waste time. - Quiet.

2149
02:21:58,729 --> 02:21:59,753
Play the video.

2150
02:22:04,268 --> 02:22:05,826
Ma'am, your change.

2151
02:22:06,537 --> 02:22:07,401
Sorry.

2152
02:22:08,806 --> 02:22:09,329
Freeze.

2153
02:22:12,143 --> 02:22:12,666
Zoom in.

2154
02:22:15,012 --> 02:22:15,535
More zoom.

2155
02:22:18,549 --> 02:22:19,015
Zoom.

2156
02:22:28,693 --> 02:22:33,858
ACP, I will nab the thief
who stole my phone in just 1 hour.

2157
02:22:36,667 --> 02:22:38,259
Hey, you may go.

2158
02:22:45,776 --> 02:22:47,767
Ma'am, call for you.

2159
02:22:48,012 --> 02:22:49,707
Who is it? - Who is it?

2160
02:22:52,183 --> 02:22:55,016
I'm her brother speaking.
- It's your brother.

2161
02:22:57,054 --> 02:23:01,047
I called him several times but
he didn't bother to answer my calls.

2162
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:02,826
Why is he concerned now?

2163
02:23:05,663 --> 02:23:07,893
Tell him I don't
want to talk to him.

2164
02:23:10,034 --> 02:23:10,898
Hello?

2165
02:23:17,942 --> 02:23:19,705
Hello? I want to talk to Meera.

2166
02:23:19,777 --> 02:23:22,143
Her father is unwell.
I want to inform her.

2167
02:23:26,417 --> 02:23:28,851
Hello, Ravi.
What happened to father?

2168
02:23:28,953 --> 02:23:30,443
Meera, this is Vishnu.

2169
02:23:30,888 --> 02:23:32,583
Just listen to what I say.

2170
02:23:32,957 --> 02:23:35,391
Adi has learnt that it was
you who called me from the booth.

2171
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:37,788
Did he learn that I'd called you?

2172
02:23:37,862 --> 02:23:40,422
No, he has only learnt
that it was you who called.

2173
02:23:40,598 --> 02:23:43,226
He's coming home for you.
Go away from there.

2174
02:23:43,734 --> 02:23:46,760
And you? - Don't worry about me.
Go away from there.

2175
02:23:46,971 --> 02:23:48,131
Come to my area.

2176
02:24:18,936 --> 02:24:19,630
Is Meera home?

2177
02:24:19,704 --> 02:24:22,798
Her brother called
saying her father unwell.

2178
02:24:22,873 --> 02:24:24,033
She has gone to meet him.

2179
02:24:26,944 --> 02:24:28,104
Brother?

2180
02:24:30,448 --> 02:24:32,006
I want to meet him too.

2181
02:25:01,078 --> 02:25:02,102
Is it urgent?

2182
02:25:07,585 --> 02:25:08,415
Go.

2183
02:25:09,353 --> 02:25:11,048
Go anywhere you want.

2184
02:25:11,522 --> 02:25:13,012
I will not stop you.

2185
02:25:15,259 --> 02:25:17,489
Who stole my phone?

2186
02:25:19,096 --> 02:25:20,495
I only want to know that.

2187
02:25:22,199 --> 02:25:23,291
I don't know.

2188
02:25:25,936 --> 02:25:30,703
You made two calls
from booth in the Mall..

2189
02:25:31,275 --> 02:25:32,902
..whom did you call?

2190
02:25:33,744 --> 02:25:34,938
I will not tell you.

2191
02:25:35,513 --> 02:25:39,244
So you know everything
but you will not tell me.

2192
02:25:42,153 --> 02:25:46,590
Tell me who is he?
Else I will become a cruel man.

2193
02:25:46,657 --> 02:25:49,057
You've always been cruel man.

2194
02:25:49,693 --> 02:25:52,287
I will not tell you
even if you kill me.

2195
02:25:53,097 --> 02:25:55,327
I will not kill you
but put you to shame.

2196
02:25:55,833 --> 02:26:00,861
The other day,
ACP saw your body in the room..

2197
02:26:01,705 --> 02:26:03,798
..but today, the public will see it.

2198
02:26:06,077 --> 02:26:08,375
Let them see. Let them all see.

2199
02:26:10,347 --> 02:26:14,306
The girls will then realize the
consequences of falling in love..

2200
02:26:14,385 --> 02:26:16,114
..with a hoodlum like you.

2201
02:26:16,821 --> 02:26:17,913
Are you done?

2202
02:26:30,201 --> 02:26:31,896
Don't come.

2203
02:26:33,737 --> 02:26:35,637
You will kill him some day.

2204
02:26:36,006 --> 02:26:37,530
That's enough for me.

2205
02:26:37,875 --> 02:26:39,672
Go away from here now.

2206
02:26:40,978 --> 02:26:42,878
I will not tell him who you are.

2207
02:26:44,381 --> 02:26:47,509
Don't put yourself into
trouble trying to save me.

2208
02:26:47,585 --> 02:26:49,746
You deserve a good life.

2209
02:26:50,621 --> 02:26:51,952
Go away from here.

2210
02:26:53,057 --> 02:26:55,048
Who is he?

2211
02:26:55,559 --> 02:26:57,049
Is it him?

2212
02:26:58,195 --> 02:27:00,527
Who is he? Who are you talking to?

2213
02:27:00,731 --> 02:27:04,428
Tell me? - Why are
you still here? Go away.

2214
02:27:04,668 --> 02:27:07,000
Is it him? Tell me? - Go away.

2215
02:27:07,505 --> 02:27:09,905
I will shoot the one
who leaves this place.

2216
02:27:10,007 --> 02:27:11,099
Stay put.

2217
02:27:11,809 --> 02:27:13,800
Is it him? Is it him?

2218
02:27:14,678 --> 02:27:15,736
Who is he?

2219
02:27:16,881 --> 02:27:19,509
Vishnu, you've come
on the right time.

2220
02:27:19,583 --> 02:27:21,414
I will nab him with his help.

2221
02:27:21,519 --> 02:27:23,419
Vishnu, the one who stole my phone..

2222
02:27:23,521 --> 02:27:25,250
..the one who hit
you in the bathroom..

2223
02:27:25,523 --> 02:27:26,854
..he is here.

2224
02:27:27,158 --> 02:27:28,352
But she isn't telling me.

2225
02:27:28,425 --> 02:27:30,620
I'm so angry. Find him.

2226
02:27:30,895 --> 02:27:32,260
Come on. Find him.

2227
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:34,463
Show me.

2228
02:27:35,032 --> 02:27:36,897
Show me who is he?

2229
02:27:37,101 --> 02:27:39,729
Who is he? Is it him, Vishnu?

2230
02:27:39,837 --> 02:27:40,599
Show me who is he?

2231
02:27:40,671 --> 02:27:43,435
Go away from here
before he finds you.

2232
02:27:43,974 --> 02:27:47,774
Don't scream.
- Hey. - Vishnu, be quiet.

2233
02:27:48,546 --> 02:27:50,844
Hello. - He will come if I kill her.

2234
02:27:51,248 --> 02:27:52,237
Hello, boss.

2235
02:27:53,551 --> 02:27:54,745
'Boss, it is not my phone.'

2236
02:27:54,818 --> 02:27:56,547
'Did you cross Ognekal falls?'

2237
02:27:56,754 --> 02:27:58,688
'Boss, did you bring
the charger and the money?'

2238
02:27:58,789 --> 02:27:59,813
'Hello, boss.'

2239
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:00,584
'Adi, boss.'

2240
02:28:29,486 --> 02:28:31,386
It's you? - Yes.

2241
02:28:32,056 --> 02:28:34,650
You could never find me.

2242
02:28:36,193 --> 02:28:37,387
I came before you myself.

2243
02:28:37,695 --> 02:28:41,392
She surrendered herself
to ACP just to save you.

2244
02:28:42,166 --> 02:28:44,134
But you ruined her dignity.

2245
02:28:44,868 --> 02:28:48,998
Today, to save me she
wants me to go away from here.

2246
02:28:50,641 --> 02:28:54,168
But I'm not Adishesha to go away.

2247
02:28:55,212 --> 02:28:56,144
Vishnu.

2248
02:28:58,148 --> 02:28:59,740
Vishnu Vardhana.

2249
02:31:31,034 --> 02:31:33,025
Stop it. Your game is now over.

2250
02:31:33,103 --> 02:31:34,832
ACP, he hit me.

2251
02:31:34,905 --> 02:31:37,738
Kill him. - If I kill him we will
not find out where the phone is.

2252
02:31:37,808 --> 02:31:40,572
Where is the phone?
- We will deal with it later.

2253
02:31:40,644 --> 02:31:42,509
First kill him. - Get away.

2254
02:31:42,579 --> 02:31:45,139
Where is the phone? Give it to me.

2255
02:31:45,215 --> 02:31:46,773
It is in the place
where it has to be.

2256
02:31:48,419 --> 02:31:50,182
If something happens to
me it will be taken to the place..

2257
02:31:50,254 --> 02:31:51,414
..where it has to be.

2258
02:31:51,889 --> 02:31:54,380
And then you will go to jail.

2259
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,256
You get it?

2260
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:58,553
You want the phone
but Adi wants my life.

2261
02:31:58,829 --> 02:32:02,196
If Adi kills me you will
be in grave trouble. Think about it.

2262
02:32:02,266 --> 02:32:03,096
Hey.

2263
02:32:04,401 --> 02:32:07,529
ACP, move away. - Than me
my life is more important to you.

2264
02:32:07,805 --> 02:32:09,102
If you want the
phone then shoot Adi.

2265
02:32:09,206 --> 02:32:10,867
I will shoot now. Move away.

2266
02:32:10,941 --> 02:32:13,375
ACP, don't listen to him.
Shoot him. - Move away, ACP.

2267
02:32:13,477 --> 02:32:14,375
Shoot him, ACP.

2268
02:32:15,212 --> 02:32:16,144
Shoot him.

2269
02:32:16,513 --> 02:32:17,104
Hey.

2270
02:32:18,515 --> 02:32:21,006
You fool, you want shoot me?

2271
02:32:21,251 --> 02:32:22,513
Don't listen to him, ACP. Shoot him.

2272
02:32:22,586 --> 02:32:23,553
Shoot me.

2273
02:32:23,954 --> 02:32:27,082
But what's the guarantee that
he will hand over the phone to you?

2274
02:32:28,592 --> 02:32:31,254
He's trying to confuse you.
You will get the phone. Shoot him.

2275
02:32:31,462 --> 02:32:32,622
To hell with the phone.

2276
02:32:32,696 --> 02:32:34,857
Befriend me,
I will give you everything.

2277
02:32:34,932 --> 02:32:36,331
Shoot him, ACP.

2278
02:32:37,067 --> 02:32:38,432
He is our enemy.

2279
02:32:38,635 --> 02:32:40,569
Did you forget how
much he troubled us?

2280
02:32:40,904 --> 02:32:43,134
Don't listen to him. He's
trying to confuse you. Shoot him.

2281
02:32:43,307 --> 02:32:45,673
Listen to me. - Shoot him, ACP.

2282
02:32:46,376 --> 02:32:46,865
Hey.

2283
02:32:46,944 --> 02:32:48,309
Hey.

2284
02:33:06,497 --> 02:33:07,088
Die.

2285
02:33:42,065 --> 02:33:44,727
Oh, my God. My friend.

2286
02:33:45,536 --> 02:33:48,027
That was an incredible jump.

2287
02:33:48,305 --> 02:33:49,670
How did you do it?

2288
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:57,142
One bullet from this direction
and the other from this direction..

2289
02:33:57,214 --> 02:34:00,911
..you will automatically jump.

2290
02:34:00,984 --> 02:34:02,918
Is that so? - Idiot.

2291
02:34:02,986 --> 02:34:05,420
You were here since a while,
why didn't you help me?

2292
02:34:05,522 --> 02:34:09,754
My friend, when you have
the support God and people..

2293
02:34:09,826 --> 02:34:13,057
..why would you need me?

2294
02:34:13,163 --> 02:34:15,654
"One, two, three, Vishnu Vardhana."

2295
02:34:15,899 --> 02:34:18,060
"I'm the king of Karnataka."

2296
02:34:18,302 --> 02:34:20,395
"I'm the king of romance."

2297
02:34:20,671 --> 02:34:22,332
"Remember that."

2298
02:34:22,806 --> 02:34:24,296
"Magic."

2299
02:34:27,611 --> 02:34:29,010
"Magic."

2300
02:34:42,392 --> 02:34:46,453
"I'm for money. There's
nothing better than money, honey."

2301
02:34:46,863 --> 02:34:48,854
"World is spinning on money, money."

2302
02:34:48,932 --> 02:34:51,560
"You want to stop the
world you baby honey."

2303
02:35:01,278 --> 02:35:06,306
"The great men who made
money saying it is everything."

2304
02:35:06,383 --> 02:35:10,843
"People who don't have
money said money is God."

2305
02:35:13,457 --> 02:35:18,190
"I don't go after
money like others."

2306
02:35:18,261 --> 02:35:22,857
"I will not wait for
money to come to me."

2307
02:35:25,736 --> 02:35:28,102
"I'm unique and my style too."

2308
02:35:28,205 --> 02:35:30,366
"My way is unique."

2309
02:35:30,474 --> 02:35:34,137
"I'm a fan of boss Vishnu.
I will follow his footsteps."
