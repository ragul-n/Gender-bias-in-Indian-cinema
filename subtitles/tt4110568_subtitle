1
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,734
<i>The world is ﬁlled with
all kinds of animals.</i>

2
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,303
But the strangest species

3
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,272
<i>is the human being.</i>

4
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,405
<i>Time just flows for the
rest of the creatures...</i>

5
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,416
<i>But human beings divide
it into years, months, days</i>

6
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,243
<i>and make calendars.</i>

7
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,525
<i>They claim you can? turn back time.</i>

8
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,395
<i>And they also say my
birthday has come again.</i>

9
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,257
<i>Whether time can turn back or not</i>

10
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,598
<i>all the special
occasions of human beings</i>

11
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,366
<i>take a u-tum and
come back each year.</i>

12
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,372
<i>Which brings us to these
hampers being packed.</i>

13
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,309
<i>These are gifts as well as invitations</i>

14
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,281
<i>for a 30th marriage anniversary.</i>

15
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,087
<i>The 30th happy anniversary
of Mr. and Mrs. Mehra.</i>

16
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,555
<i>One of Delhi societys
most popular coup/es</i> -

17
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,393
<i>The Mehras.</i>

18
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,226
<i>This is Mr. Kama! Mehra.</i>

19
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,294
<i>A successful businessman.</i> . .

20
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,437
<i>who built his mighty
empire from scratch.</i>

21
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:27,607
<i>A fact he repeats often,
incase anyone forgets it.</i>

22
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,111
<i>Mr. Mehra is referred
to as</i> a <i>self made man.</i>

23
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,450
One wonders that <i>if</i> people
can make themselves...

24
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,383
then why dorft they make
themselves a <i>little</i> better?

25
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,657
But what does one do?

26
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,755
<i>These days, 'better' is not defined</i>

27
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,790
<i>by intelligence, honesty or courage</i>

28
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,319
<i>but by something else.</i>

29
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,565
<i>H has to do with
something called money.</i>

30
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,163
Nice putt Kamal!

31
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,234
If only you had been this
precise with the Suri deal.

32
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,612
You win some, you lose some, Lalit.

33
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,278
Only a man nearing
the end does accounts.

34
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,048
Come on!
Beer is on me.

35
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,057
I have a lunch date with my wife...

36
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,995
and I never keep a lady waiting.

37
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,289
See you.

38
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,071
<i>This is his Wife, Neelam Mehra.</i>

39
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,209
<i>Mr. Mehra is hot having lunch
with her, she is just ah excuse.</i>

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,139
<i>In fact, they have not
lunched together in years.</i>

41
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,414
<i>Their story was quite
romantic to begin with.</i>

42
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,520
<i>18 year old Nee/am had run</i> away

43
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,621
<i>and married</i> 22 <i>year old Kama].</i>

44
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,127
<i>Over time, they found
unbelievable success.</i>

45
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,129
<i>But lost each other along the way.</i>

46
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,125
<i>Anyway, this is just
inside information.</i>

47
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:01,004
<i>In front of the world,
theirs is</i> a <i>perfect marriage.</i>

48
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,006
<i>An ideal couple.</i>

49
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,569
You know na Kamal was in Taiwan
last week for some work...

50
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,073
Guess who had a meeting
in Taiwan the same week?

51
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,244
Don't tell me!
Radhikal?

52
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,013
She’s such a number!

53
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,478
And this Kamal...

54
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,419
Why pack your pants

55
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,354
when you aren’t going to wear them?!

56
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,154
We were just talking
about you & Kamal.

57
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,162
Really?

58
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,221
It's so sweet of him
to plan a cruise.

59
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,124
My husband doesn't even

60
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,191
remember our anniversary.

61
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,235
L-low do you remember your husband'?

62
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,108
My maid's run away again.

63
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,578
Again? What do you do with them?!

64
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,048
Yes, Ayesha?

65
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,274
Deeya aunty still hasn’t confirmed...

66
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,688
I know, mom
but we can’t keep the room on hold.

67
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,689
Nice card...

68
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,255
To celebrate 3O years
of Kamal and Neelam,

69
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,295
we wish you to join us

70
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,331
for a 1O day cruise
of Turkey and Greece.

71
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,964
Just like our lives, this journey

72
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,092
won't be the same without you.

73
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,165
Kabir Ivlehra.

74
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:11,704
Ayesha Mehra. ..

75
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,136
<i>Neeiam and KamaPs ﬁrst born.</i>

76
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,346
<i>But her name is not on the
invite alongside her brotnefs.</i>

77
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,012
<i>Why would it be?</i>

78
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,686
<i>The tradition of our nation
is that after marriage</i>

79
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,519
<i>the daughter belongs
to another family.</i>

80
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,560
<i>The son could have umpteen marriages</i>

81
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,024
<i>he will always remain our own.</i>

82
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,590
<i>And so, 21 years after her birth,</i>

83
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,065
<i>Ayesha was married and
shipped off to Mumbai</i>

84
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:43,173
<i>to lead</i> a <i>life like all
girls in these circumstances.</i>

85
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,743
<i>But Ayesha is not
typical of the female ilk.</i>

86
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,704
<i>Soon after her wedding,</i>

87
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,248
<i>she started her business
- An onHne travel portal.</i>

88
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,445
<i>Today, she is the
2nd biggest in the market.</i>

89
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,692
<i>Just like her father,
she too is self made.</i>

90
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,428
<i>The difference is, she doesrft say it.</i>

91
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,474
<i>And here We have Kabir Mehra,</i>

92
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,113
<i>the youngest member
of the Mehra family.</i>

93
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:28,109
<i>The male child, or rather Gocfs gift.</i>

94
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,154
<i>After all, he will
carry on the family name.</i>

95
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,552
<i>Just last Week, he turned 25.</i>

96
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,322
<i>The apple of his motheﬁs eye</i>

97
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,565
<i>and the sole heir to
his fathefs empire.</i>

98
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,170
So <i>we have</i> a <i>prince
and we have</i> a <i>throne.</i>

99
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,700
<i>But is that enough?</i>

100
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:56,241
<i>Only time will tell if this prince
is worthy of the throne or hot.</i>

101
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,450
And there you have it, folks.

102
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,115
I think it’s sufficiently clear
that we can together deliver

103
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,555
a high quality product
for the South Asian market-

104
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,219
And how will you compete
with Chinese products'?

105
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,293
Well I don’t think

106
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,694
that is a concern for us.

107
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,629
After all, our quality is higher
and price lower.

108
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,602
These prices are only possible

109
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,469
if the production
costs and selling price

110
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,202
function on these numbers.

111
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,035
The Indian rupee keeps fluctuating.

112
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
Where is the contingency
plan for that?

113
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,709
If the dollar rises

114
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,680
raw material costs will also increase.

115
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,551
Isn't that right'?

116
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,629
Actually, you are totally right

117
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,354
we should have factored that in.

118
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,569
You will get our revised
proposal by tomorrow.

119
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,399
You’re right.

120
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,169
Anything can happen.

121
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,536
Don’t you have elections
in Sri Lanka ne><t year?

122
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,342
The policy could change

123
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,045
with a new government.

124
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,543
And then the tax concessions

125
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,140
you have committed to us

126
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,480
may also change.

127
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,583
We must factor that in too.

128
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,087
You're absolutely right, Mr. Mehra

129
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,289
As usual.

130
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:53,782
Oh my god!

131
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,321
I love that picture of Pluto
you put up yesterday.

132
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,486
Isn't it the best?

133
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,492
He's so cute.

134
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,460
Whafs Pluto?

135
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,354
It's a planet.

136
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:02,666
It was.

137
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,266
Was...

138
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,427
Pluto is our doggie.

139
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,672
Pluto is our brother.

140
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,073
Brother...

141
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,368
Does he look like you?

142
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,736
Why didn’t anyone tell me

143
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,503
lvlanav’s cousin is so cute?

144
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,048
You're really stupid!

145
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,446
When are you going
back to Delhi, Kabir?

146
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,379
Tomorrow, after the meeting.

147
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,553
Why? What is the hurry?

148
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,061
Stay another day na.

149
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,488
Do you still ride that plane?

150
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,758
I even fly it now, Aunty.

151
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,198
You had promised me you'll come.

152
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,031
then what happened?

153
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,126
How?

154
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,570
I have vertigo.

155
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:41,763
In any case...

156
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,766
if I leave for even a day
this house falls apart.

157
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,446
I heard
dad is selling the plane?

158
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,413
Yes...

159
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,383
Don’t remind me.

160
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,646
I may jump off from here.

161
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,418
Ayesha, please work out a way

162
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,581
that he doesn’t have to sell it.

163
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,056
Kabir!

164
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,457
I know this plane is
your one true love,

165
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,325
but Ayka needs an asset reduction.

166
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,363
It's a dead investment.

167
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,261
You know...

168
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,997
When I got married,

169
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,230
I was so shy in front of my in-laws.

170
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,562
Forget talking about business.

171
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,238
I could hardly say 'yesfi 'no'.

172
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,611
But how times have changed...

173
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,043
Mom tell us that story,

174
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,281
when you met the Maharaja of Jodhpur.

175
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,552
You know...

176
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,384
Even Kabir felt my name
should have been on the card.

177
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,350
Aysh...
The invitation was from the ivlehras.

178
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,692
You're not a Ivlehra anymore.

179
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,592
You are a Sangha.

180
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,733
And please tell Kabir...

181
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,768
how was he behaving with Nitya'?

182
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,727
They are not kids.

183
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,364
I know.
But she is my cousin

184
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,470
and your brother...

185
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,299
spoilt brat!

186
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,379
<i>Brat or not, Kabir is my best friend.</i>

187
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,311
We met 5 years ago

188
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,511
<i>and have been inseparable since.</i>

189
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,491
<i>Oh great... I forgot
to introduce myself.</i>

190
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,755
<i>After all, even l
belong to this family.</i>

191
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,390
<i>Hello, handsome!</i>

192
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,228
<i>And at the risk of sounding impolite</i>

193
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,633
<i>if anyone in this family is normal,</i>

194
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,100
<i>it is me...</i>

195
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,468
<i>Pluto Mehra.</i>

196
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,343
Ayesha is upset

197
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,538
her name was not on the card.

198
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,506
L-low was your meeting'?

199
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,378
Papa did everything on Skype.

200
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:35,552
Awww

201
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,447
l-low modest my baby is!

202
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,784
Just like Mama.

203
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,062
I don’t think Ayka needs me.

204
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,295
What do you mean?

205
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,697
The company is for you.

206
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,569
You’re our son...
who else will manage it?

207
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:56,563
I don’t know.

208
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,668
Maybe Papa can find
someone more qualified.

209
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,482
What is the matter?

210
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,747
Here.

211
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:09,710
It's diet.

212
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,478
There is no such thing

213
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,454
don’t lie.

214
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,516
You want cheese toast?

215
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,353
Hot chocolate fudge from Nirula's?

216
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,086
Are you even listening to me?

217
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,199
I don’t think I belong here.

218
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,170
If you didn’t belong here

219
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,679
why would you be born here?

220
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,313
This 'mummy' logic ma...

221
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:42,782
<i>Okay . ....</i>

222
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,482
If you could wish for
one thing right now

223
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,021
what would it be?

224
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,756
Anything.

225
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,162
Anything, tell me?

226
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,757
I wish dad vvasn’t selling the plane.

227
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,442
It's so oily.

228
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,578
L-low can anyone eat this'?

229
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,158
What else is there?
- Just this.

230
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,994
Just this?
- Great. Thank you.

231
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,423
Sunil!
- Yes, sir?

232
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:27,690
Get some fruit.

233
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,663
I've told you to tell
them in the morning

234
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,672
what you want to eat.

235
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,700
It's not just about me.

236
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,610
You think you should be eating this?

237
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,402
Good luck with your weight loss.

238
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,683
Pass the yoghurt.

239
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,552
Ayesha is upset
her name is not on the card.

240
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,195
Oh ya?

241
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,064
She did all the planning, not me.

242
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,564
If we put Ayesha’s name on the card

243
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,661
then we'll have to put Manavs as well

244
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,705
and then everyone will think

245
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,669
he is paying for the cruise.

246
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,138
It's confusing.

247
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,979
I told you she’d be upset.

248
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,372
Then talk to her...

249
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,581
<i>Mother India.</i>

250
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,144
Guys please.

251
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,265
I am selling some of my shares.

252
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,429
What?

253
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,339
I need to buy something.

254
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,305
Oh really!

255
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,503
Those Louis Vuitton bags
and shoes aren’t enough?

256
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,604
Now you need to own their company?

257
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,581
I want to buy my son a gift
if you don’t mind?!

258
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,380
What gift?
- The plane you are selling.

259
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:57,384
Mom!

260
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,359
Have you no shame?

261
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,724
I didn’t say anything.

262
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,428
Whafs wrong with you, Kabir?
- Just leave him out of this.

263
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,227
At your age
I used to take a bus to work.

264
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,959
On foot, when I had no money.

265
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,204
The soles of my shoes would wear out!

266
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,237
I've worked very hard, Kabir-

267
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,607
Really? Then?

268
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,369
V\/e’ve never heard this story before.

269
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,382
And you?
You want to buy our plane from us?

270
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,516
You are a genius, Neelam.

271
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,516
They are my shares.

272
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,619
I'll do what I want
with my money, okay.

273
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:32,580
Your money?

274
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,650
You only have this money
because I earned it.

275
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,616
Me!

276
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,753
And I supported you.
- Shut up okay.

277
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,322
Don’t talk to me like this.

278
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:46,401
<i>Human beings are
blessed with language.</i>

279
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,305
<i>H is a gift that enab§es
them to clearly express</i>

280
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:56,376
<i>their thoughts, ideas and emotions.</i>

281
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,413
<i>But the irony is that
in spite of this power,</i>

282
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,712
<i>the acute lack of
understanding between them,</i>

283
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,121
<i>will not be found in mute animals.</i>

284
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,395
<i>If there can be so much
misunderstanding in one nuclear family,</i>

285
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,559
how can one even hope for world peace?

286
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,204
What is this, Amrish?

287
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,602
If I hadn’t come for a random check

288
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,068
you vvoulcfve shipped these off?

289
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,513
ls this Ayka’s finish?

290
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,015
You're the supervisor.
Is this how you supervise'?

291
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,150
<i>Bhai Saab...</i>

292
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,480
I heard from the bank.

293
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:42,759
Bad news.

294
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,727
They are not willing
to take any more risks.

295
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,052
The account is already overdrawn.

296
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,088
And everyone we owe
money to is calling.

297
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,028
Shit.

298
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,762
L-low can they do this'?

299
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,472
25 years we've been
working with them...

300
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,568
This is how they
value our relationship'?

301
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,506
What do they want?

302
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,111
Should I put up a hoarding?

303
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,680
That Ayka is bankrupt!

304
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,715
I can delay it.

305
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,781
But vve’

 have to pay up. What to do...

306
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,338
Everything is okay...

307
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,273
I am okay.

308
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,275
I am okay.

309
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,345
Oh, Kamal will be so upset.

310
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,377
We'll miss you guys...

311
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,482
I'll tell him.

312
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,315
I'll tell him.

313
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,422
Okay.
Bye... Bye..-

314
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,761
The Kumars are not coming.

315
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,227
Good.

316
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,665
<i>8,000 Euros saved.</i>

317
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,503
Do you have to be so crude?

318
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,129
The company is bleeding.

319
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,304
Interest is mounting by the day.

320
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,043
So forgive me for being crude.

321
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,459
Prem thinks I should talk to Lalit.

322
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,690
Lalit Sood?

323
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,732
You're selling shares?

324
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,236
For partnership?

325
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,431
49%.

326
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,667
He has deep pockets.

327
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,744
You have to be at an advantage
with a man like Lalit.

328
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,085
Give him something he needs...

329
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,186
But what?

330
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,113
That bastard has everything.

331
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,792
Except a
son-in-law.

332
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,061
His daughter Noorie. ..

333
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,126
Her engagement broke up. I told you.

334
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,557
Why, what did she do?

335
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,097
Who cares!

336
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,466
She is Lalit Soocfs only heir.

337
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,605
Does Kabir know her?

338
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,335
They must have met socially.

339
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,343
What are you thinking?

340
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,323
Kabir and Noorie?

341
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,498
No, actually... it's not a bad idea.

342
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,671
<i>Anyway Nahwa Soot) must be</i>

343
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,761
quite desperate these days.

344
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,073
Should I invite them?

345
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,080
What about Vinod?

346
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,309
If we call them Vinod will get upset.

347
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,719
Don’t worry about him...

348
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,384
He survived a heart attack.

349
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,158
He’

 live through this too.

350
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,496
Hi Naina!

351
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,430
L-low are you'?

352
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,099
Very well...

353
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,429
Okay, I've called to invite you...

354
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,227
it's our wedding anniversary

355
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,428
and we are going for a cruise.

356
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,435
And we'd love you all to join us.

357
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,172
Ayesha Didi!

358
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,215
Coming!

359
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:29,643
Welcome!
- Hello, darling!

360
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,553
Hi, Saira Aunty!
- Hey boy!

361
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,661
Come on!

362
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,557
Pluto Ivlehra.

363
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,130
Come to me...
Why is he on the leash?

364
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,167
Ship rules...
- Sorry Pluto!

365
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,067
Great show Kabir.

366
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,233
Congratulate Ayesha, Jamaal uncle.

367
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,438
It's all her doing.

368
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,172
Your sister is a genius...

369
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,736
Forbes magazines top 1O entrepreneurs.

370
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,239
Congratulations, Kamal.

371
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,011
Next year it'll be my son.

372
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,615
He just cracked an
incredible deal in Ivlumbai.

373
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,283
You should have seen him, Jamaal...

374
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,089
He was a tiger!

375
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:41,782
Really?

376
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,651
Good job, Kabir.

377
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,558
Proud of you!

378
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,197
You have completely
forgotten Delhi and all of us.

379
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,800
Not at all, Amrish uncle!

380
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,399
You must come more often.

381
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,469
Of course I will.

382
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,265
But I'm really happy that you are here.

383
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,210
Kamal Ji personally invited Sunny & me.

384
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,243
I had to come.

385
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,302
I hope Sunny comes too.

386
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,043
L-low many change of
clothes have you brought'?

387
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:07,416
25.

388
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,049
Should be enough no?

389
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,652
The Chaddhas are upset

390
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,313
they were not invited.

391
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,618
Aren’t they your friends lndu?

392
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,724
Everyone can’t be invited.

393
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,085
They invited the dog.

394
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,628
He is better behaved than the Chaddas.

395
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,597
Naina! Hello!
- Oh my god!

396
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,600
So glad you all could make it.

397
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,197
What are they doing here?

398
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,397
Welcome aboard, Lalit.

399
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,634
This is amazing, Kamal.

400
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:33,667
Impressive.

401
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,670
Hello, Kamal.

402
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,071
L-low are you'?

403
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:37,413
Top of the world, as usual.

404
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,209
Noorie!

405
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,581
She was so little when I last saw her.

406
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,182
Right, Neelu?

407
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,386
Come let's have a drink.

408
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,353
I'll just join you in a second...

409
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,549
Come come... Please come...

410
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,348
it's not easy.

411
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,489
But he'll learn.

412
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,286
Prem...

413
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,424
Listen...

414
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,563
Lalit Sood is here.

415
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,593
Give him the best suite.

416
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,335
These should be no issues.
No screw ups, okay?

417
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,968
What are you waiting for?

418
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:02,472
Go!

419
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,370
What is this, Papa?

420
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,372
Why do you talk to Prem uncle in this tone?

421
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,107
He’s your brother, not your assistant.

422
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,412
Don't be silly.

423
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:13,710
I think you need a drink.

424
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:14,683
Come.

425
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,418
We all were worried about you.

426
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,121
Good to see you back in action, Sir.

427
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,055
It's gods grace

428
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,353
that I got luckys.

429
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,321
You never know with the heart.

430
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,186
I just got an ECG done.

431
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,993
Where did you do it?
- In Bombay.

432
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,467
Let me know if you ever need a bypass.
Very good

433
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,536
Did you know Kamal
had invited the Soods?

434
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,603
<i>Seeds?</i>

435
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,245
<i>They say dogs have</i> a
<i>strong sense of smell.</i>

436
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,555
<i>But when it comes to sniffing out trouble,</i>

437
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,649
<i>humans aren‘t far behind.</i>

438
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,597
<i>Not only do they anticipate
danger in advance,</i>

439
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,658
<i>they even plan their response to it.</i>

440
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,038
<i>Ironically, the biggest
threat to</i> a <i>human being</i>

441
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,734
<i>is another human being.</i>

442
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,739
<i>To shield them selves,</i>

443
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,005
<i>they change their coiour
to suit their environment.</i>

444
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:24,586
<i>And they become</i>
a <i>bit like shame/eons.</i>

445
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:26,983
<i>For instance,</i>

446
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:31,390
<i>Vinod Khanna and LaHt Sood
are shaking hands.</i>

447
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,592
<i>When in reality, it is</i> a <i>show of strength.</i>

448
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,536
<i>Their wives are exchanging smiles</i>

449
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,073
<i>but it is a baring of fangs.</i>

450
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,274
<i>Their children have been
instructed to keep</i> a <i>distance,</i>

451
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,616
<i>but are actually sizing each other up.</i>

452
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,114
<i>Pretension is</i> a <i>purely human trait.</i>

453
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,996
<i>When others do it,
people ca" it hypocrisy.</i>

454
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:11,659
<i>And</i> when they do <i>it</i> themselves,
they call <i>it</i> world/mess.

455
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,662
<i>So ab' I can say is</i>

456
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,264
<i>that Mr. and Mrs. Mehra
are very worldly people.</i>

457
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,018
Attention attention...

458
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,516
Today, all of you...

459
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,155
my dear friends...

460
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,221
are here tonight...

461
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,122
What can I say.

462
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,064
I feel on top of the world!

463
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,407
Neelu, my beautiful wife...

464
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,073
When I first met you,

465
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,142
I was nothing.

466
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,643
And even today, without you

467
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,714
I'd be nothing.

468
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,992
I can't say it enough...

469
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,052
I love you, Neelu.

470
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,027
Go for it!
That's my buddy!

471
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,965
Touch wood, Vinod.

472
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,528
God has been very kind.

473
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,533
Our only wish is that

474
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,007
our daughter...

475
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,703
and our son-in-law. ..

476
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,308
quickly give us a grandson!

477
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:41,283
Cheers to that!

478
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,586
Cheers!

479
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,385
Come on lets have dinner!

480
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:48,595
You know Vinod just had a heart attack.
- I know...

481
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,157
If we knew the Soods are coming
we wouldn't come.

482
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,663
Vandana aunty, it musfve
slipped Mamas mind...

483
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:55,537
How?!

484
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,141
Everyone knows our equation with the Soods.

485
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,769
Vinod can’t stand Lalit Sood.

486
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,171
Mom please take it easy...

487
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:02,769
They’re standing right here.

488
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,208
Rana, please!
Neelu shoulcfve told us.

489
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,381
Now what have I done?

490
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,712
You cou
d've made a little
more effort at your outfit.

491
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,584
I did.
- It's not a big deal...

492
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,018
I don’t get involved in
making these guest lists.

493
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,251
Neelam looks into all that.

494
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:15,757
<i>Kama . . ...</i>

495
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,060
Don’t be formals.

496
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,156
V\/e’ve been tolerating our
wives for so many years.

497
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,062
We can tolerate the Soods for 2 weeks!

498
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,469
<i>Omen mam!</i>

499
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,527

t’s your anniversarys. ..

500
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,498
Cheers!

501
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,136
Come on Smita Ji, you must have a drink!

502
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,199
Shall I get you a drink?

503
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,137
I have arthritis.

504
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,407
I can’t hold the glass for too long.

505
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,149
I'll help you.

506
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,209
I love this Neelam Aunty.

507
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,479
This is so stunning!

508
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,419
Thank you!

509
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,188
My anniversary gift.

510
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,286
WOW !

511
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,384
Have you met Kabir?
- Yes.

512
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,123
Kabir!

513
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:53,654
Come here, son.

514
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,464
Have you met Noorie?

515
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,702
Yes... Hi.

516
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:00,433
Hi...

517
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,538
Now she's your responsibility...

518
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:03,538
Have fun.

519
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:04,663
Thank you.

520
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,376
So vvhafs been up?

521
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:17,282
Whafs been up?

522
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,718
My fiancé left me at the altar.

523
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,388
Everyone is laughing at my family

524
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,619
and my mom blames me.

525
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,659
But you already knew this?

526
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:31,792
No.

527
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,171
My fiancé Jai went to Goa-

528
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,766
Ex-fiance...

529
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,371
Ex-fiance, Jai...

530
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,608
went to Goa for his bachelor trip.

531
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,744
There he met a hippie, fell in love

532
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,515
and that was that.

533
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,256
That's rough.

534
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,721
It was in the front page of the Delhi Times.

535
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,161
Headlines...

536
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,733
Noorie Sood...

537
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,369
"Not so Hippie!"

538
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,514
That boy Jai has turned us into a joke...

539
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,622
That's just how people are.

540
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,196
Look at some of my own friends...

541
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,692
They love discussing
other peoples' problems.

542
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,498
I'm having a 'Mata I<I Chowki' next month.

543
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,765
Goofs given us just one daughter...

544
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,072
Atleast now he should be kind.

545
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,610
He was being kind.

546
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,044
Let me tell you Naina...

547
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,719
Noorie is meant to find
a better boy than Jai.

548
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,654
Believe me.

549
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,223
Dinner was great, haan?

550
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,084
Did you try the prawns?

551
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,356
They were fantastic!

552
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,265
Did you notice...

553
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,073
Noorie and Kabir were really bonding.

554
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,007
Did Naina say anything to you?

555
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,319
Relax...

556
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,153
it's just been a day.

557
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,414
Yes.

558
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,523
Just one day...

559
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,061
But ifs been 3O years for us.

560
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,270
L-low time has flown...

561
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,802
Why are you acting?

562
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,146
No one is watching.

563
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,420
<i>Okay. . ...</i>

564
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:30,309
Everyone is saying how well
you planned this cruise.

565
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,247
Congratulations.

566
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,154
Your name shoulcfve been on that card.

567
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,025
Why don’t you ever say anything?

568
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,490
Please...

569
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,022
Just order yourself another one...

570
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,328
Why do you always eat from my bowl?

571
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,663
Because you always get so irritated.

572
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:53,668
Makes it more tasty!

573
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,331
By the way--

574
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,304
Jamaal uncle is super impressed
with your Forbes article.

575
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,573
Really Aysh...

576
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,314
What you have done with your company...

577
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,483
I could never do it.

578
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,191
Of course you can.

579
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,249
And anyway...

580
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:20,621
no one except Jamaal Uncle cares what I do.

581
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,297
Everyone just wants me to have a baby.

582
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,395
Ya, so that will happen too.

583
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,533
It won’t...

584
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,142
I'm on the pill.

585
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,773
If you tell anyone I
swear to god I'll Kill you.

586
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:39,777
You know that right?

587
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,140
Ivlanav doesn’t know?

588
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,122
Hello, Kabir...

589
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,352
Big man!

590
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,255
Hi...

591
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,120
Uff!

592
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,596
Look where your dog is sitting.

593
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,099
Pluto shoo...

594
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:00,635
Shoo...

595
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:03,996
Shoo...

596
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,574
Pluto off.

597
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,139
Omon... Let's go for a swim.

598
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,039
L-low can you allow him on the bed'?

599
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,080
It's disgusting...

600
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,545
Divorce! Divorce! Divorce!

601
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,119
Bye, Kabir.

602
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,150
Look at this dog hair...

603
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,518
We are living in a kennel.

604
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,567
Here we go...

605
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,497
<i>A new story begins.</i>

606
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:47,210
<i>This is cal/ed love at first sight.</i>

607
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,678
<i>What is love at first sight?</i>

608
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,954
You see someone,

609
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,186
a <i>chemical reaction is
triggered in the brain,</i>

610
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,526
<i>blood rushes faster through the veins,</i>

611
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,525
a <i>tingling sensation
passes through the body...</i>

612
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,632
<i>So your heartbeat increases.</i>

613
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,063
<i>It's not visible,</i>

614
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:19,966
<i>but the two of them are
experiencing all this right how.</i>

615
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,323
<i>Look at that...</i>

616
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,117
<i>When he comes here,</i>

617
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:38,452
she goes there.

618
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,054
<i>Even we may such
games in the beginning.</i>

619
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,577
<i>At the start of</i> a <i>new Jove story,</i>

620
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,469
one doesn’! really need speech...

621
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,514
<i>The eyes talk...</i>

622
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,351
<i>The body communicates.</i>

623
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,352
<i>Neither you nor I heard a thing,</i>

624
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:11,657
<i>but these two just had a conversation.</i>

625
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,290
<i>Good Morning! This is your Captain speaking.</i>

626
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,397
<i>We are approaching the port of Izmir</i>

627
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,959
<i>and as predicted we shall arrive at Q</i> am...

628
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:27,704
Please...

629
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:28,610
Oh no, please!

630
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,273
Go ahead.

631
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,110
You were here first...

632
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:35,614
Thank you.

633
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:36,552
You’re welcome.

634
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,713
This Rana Khanna is so smart...

635
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,326
What are you are wearing?!

636
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,502
I just woke up.
- So? This is not your bedroom!

637
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,262
Look at Noorie. ..

638
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,112
You want me to dress like Noorie?

639
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,274
If you don't doll up, how
will you trap a nice boy'?

640
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:13,279
That's what girls your age are meant to do.

641
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,385
What did she say?

642
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,196
Such a lovely colour you’re wearing...

643
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,701
Listen, there’s an
authentic Turkish Hamam here.

644
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,135
Do you want to come with us?

645
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,678
No.

646
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,203
I have asthma.

647
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,339
The steam makes
me...

648
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,113
I can't.

649
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,820
She even has asthma...

650
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,390
Now that college is over, Divya

651
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,760
what is your career plan?

652
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,197
I don't know...

653
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,632
I like some things, but...

654
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,067
Like what?

655
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,664
You like to sleep.

656
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,639
You could become a coma patient.

657
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,207
Hello, girls!

658
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,375
Sorry! I need to borrow
your sister for a minute...

659
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,615
What happened?

660
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,218
Saira Aunty just told me Amira is pregnant.

661
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,621
That's great!

662
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:22,486
Ifs IVF...

663
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,192
We should also try it.

664
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,328
<i>Speak to Sake aunty.</i>

665
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,292
Let’s meet Amira’s doctor
as soon as we go back.

666
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,730
Okay?
- Yes.

667
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,539
We have to do this Aysh.

668
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,734
Yes. ..Okay.

669
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:00,991
Mama.

670
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:02,765
Hmm...

671
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,202
Why didn’t you divorce Papa?

672
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:12,266
What kind of question is this?

673
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:18,644
Look...

674
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,213
I know what all he’s done.

675
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,485
Every marriage has problems.

676
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,048
If not an affair, then something else...

677
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,094
Doesn’t mean you throw up your hands

678
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,494
and leave.

679
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:35,690
But why not?

680
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,692
Because that is too easy.

681
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,332
Staying together and solving
problems is difficult,

682
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:45,765
But also the right thing to do.

683
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,611
Marriage is not a race
you have to finish.

684
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,815
If someone is not
happy then why can't -

685
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,039
What is the matter with you?

686
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,281
Did you have a fight with Ivlanav?

687
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,292
Not a fight, but we aren’t-

688
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,520
Ayesha, I don’t want to hear it!

689
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,328
Ivlanav is a good man.

690
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,693
He’s doing very well for himself.

691
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,161
You'll always have
everything you want.

692
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:15,403
Have everything I want?

693
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,099
If thafs the case why didn’t you

694
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,200
marry me off to a mall?

695
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,676
Have you gone crazy?

696
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,612
Just because your
company is doing well

697
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,645
don't let it go to your head.

698
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,145
Forget about your career,

699
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:35,717
focus on your home.

700
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,167
<i>We animals also train our young.</i>

701
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:52,134
<i>A lioness teaches her cubs to hunt.</i>

702
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,104
<i>A pigeon teaches her squabs to ﬂy.</i>

703
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,142
<i>But once they’ve grown up,</i>

704
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,207
<i>they are on their own.</i>

705
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,251
<i>Indian parents somehow can? accept</i>

706
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,516
<i>that their offspring
are capable enough</i>

707
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,385
<i>to live life on their own terms.</i>

708
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:08,622
Kabir.

709
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:09,582
Yes.

710
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,194
I've booked a table at the
night club for you kids.

711
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:12,693
Sweet.

712
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,720
Please invite Noorie also.

713
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,463
Please.

714
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:23,503
<i>They remain involved in
their children ’s lives</i>

715
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,632
<i>way longer than required.</i>

716
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,008
Are you going like this
or will you wear some clothes?

717
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,211
Where is your jacket?

718
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:35,240
<i>§f one thinks wearing a
jacket will solve the problem,</i>

719
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,516
<i>they are sadly mistaken.</i>

720
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:37,676
Take off your jacket.

721
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,422
Mom, please!

722
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,387
What please?

723
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,150
Atleast wear some lipstick.

724
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,092
<i>Wanted or not,</i>

725
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,657
<i>the training never stops.</i>

726
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:54,397
Stay away from Lalit Soocfs daughter.

727
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,669
Understood?

I was sleeping, these guys woke me up.

816
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,583
You can sleep when you're dead.

817
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,058
Hey! I thought the champagne

818
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,084

819
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,528
Hold on! It's coming.

820
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,723
Noorie, don't you
know sharing is caring.

821
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,026
Here.

822
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:55,464
<i>Oh no... That's</i> okay.

823
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,197
What do you mean it's okay?
You'll fall sick.

824
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:57,999
No really...

825
00:49:58,296 --> 00:49:59,001

826
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,167
Anyway I wouldn't wear
this grandfather jacket.

827
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:05,170
Did she just say 'grandfather jacket”?

828
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,074
Noorie, you're a star!

829
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:09,582
Speaking of stars...

830
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,279
Does anyone know any Nakshatras?

831
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:16,047

837
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,393
1, 2, s, 4...

838
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,157
I can't see anything.

839
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,725
And then you see the legs coming down...

840
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,132
Can you see the shape?
- I can't see it...

841
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,468
Ptolemy discovered it.

842
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:33,198
It's from Greek mythology.

843
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:33,765
I'm bored...

844
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,145
<i>Yuck-mi puiao!</i>

845
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,280
Some warning would have been nice...

846
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,646
Come on, Divya!

847
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,348
I'm so sorry...

848
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,147
I'm feeling really sick...

849
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:52,618
Not here.

850
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:53,790
Over the railing.

851
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,329
Over the railing.

852
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,160

861
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:23,623

00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,807
There is some magic in this name.

865
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,314
Anything can happen here...

866
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,254
Istanbul!

867
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,549

Sir, you can't be here...

874
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:41,486

Who says I am going?

Start again?

888
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:51,564

personally involved with guests.

889
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,102

00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,083
I can fly a plane.

916
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:49,246
Can you ride a cycle?

917
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,054
I have a birthmark on my right leg.

918
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:53,624
I have a scar on the right leg.

919
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,594
I fractured my hand when I was 8.

920
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,225
Toe fracture when I was 16.

921
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,229
No tattoos.

922
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,326
One tattoo.

923
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,192
Where?

924
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,202
You’re in a hurry!

925
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:05,070
Democracy!

926
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:05,640
Dictatorship!

927
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:06,566
What? Really?

928
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,438
Don't judge!

929
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:08,474
One serious girlfriend.

930
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,044
One serious boyfriend.

931
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:10,611
Cricket.

932
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:11,702
Basketball.

933
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,481
I love video games.
- I hate video games.

934
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,572
What? Lame.
I can beat you in a cycle race.

935
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:16,747
You can try.

936
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,451
I bet my golf kit,

937
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,424
Your dad wants Lalit
Sood to invest in Ayka.

938
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,063
Why would you think that?

939
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,199
Why else would he invite them?

940
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,435
God I hope not...

941
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,665
That Lalit Sood is a vulture.

942
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,174
Your dad is a hawk.

943
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,110
It's a perfect match.

944
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:23,010
Why don’t we invest in Ayka?

945
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,678
That way the company
will stay in the family.

946
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:28,152
Are you crazy?

947
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:31,186
I don’t want any new equation with

948
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:32,989
your father or brother.

949
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,092
But...

950
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:42,599
when it comes to you...

951
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,562
ifs a different matter.

952
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,247
Please, lvlanav..

953
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:54,640
Don't...

954
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,183
It's been such a long
day, I'm so tired.

955
00:57:58,242 --> 00:57:59,016
Please...

956
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,150
Please...

957
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:25,740
Hey...

958
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:28,405
Come here.

959
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:00,572
Pluto...

960
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:02,979
Hey!

961
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,184
Pluto!

962
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:07,986
Hi!

963
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,421
Hi!

964
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,190
Hi!

965
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,124
Hi, Pluto! Hi, handsome!

966
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,693
When I was one,

967
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,429
whenever I heard music

968
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,462
I would crawl to the speaker,

969
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,331
hold n,

970
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,735
prop myself up and jump...

971
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,206
Up and down.

972
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:33,471
What a memory!

973
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:35,675
Shut up!

974
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,118
My mom told me.

975
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,986
Born to dance...

976
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:42,649
Yes.

977
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,583
I was born to dance.

978
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,087
And you...

979
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:48,756
Born for business?

980
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:54,468
That's what my family says...

981
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,535
Meaning?

982
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,098
That is all I heard since I was a kid.

983
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:02,707
So?

984
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,144
I was always told I have to

985
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:06,613
be a good housewife.

986
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:08,646
Really?

987
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,278
My family is very conservative.

988
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,112
So then?

989
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:16,556
L-low did you convince them'?

990
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:18,755
I cou
dn’t...

991
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,527
So I ran away.

992
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:23,664
What do you mean ran away?

993
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:27,561
Like literally ran away?

994
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,294
Yes.

995
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,366
My house was in Birmingham.

996
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,707
One night I packed my bag,

997
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,671
put the 200 pounds I had saved

998
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,511
in my pocket...

999
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,071
and I took a train to London.

1000
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:41,645
What?

1001
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,450
Where did you live?

1002
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,178
I had some friends there.

1003
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,559
If I was lucky, their couch,

1004
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,488
Otherwise a park bench.

1005
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:56,760
But mostly I was lucky.

1006
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:58,225
And money?

1007
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:59,329
I worked.

1008
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,232
Waitress.

1009
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,035
Bartender.

1010
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:06,701
That way I saved money

1011
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,242
and paid for dance school.

1012
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,141
Fearless Farah...

1013
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,144
If you were in my place
even you would be fearless.

1014
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,280
You vvoulcfve jumped from here...

1015
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,585
and then... sink or swim baby.

1016
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,462
<i>While some girls need to run,</i>

1017
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,641
<i>others have to hide.</i>

1018
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,779
<i>To live life on their own terms,</i>

1019
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,409
<i>girls are often left with no choice.</i>

1020
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:53,280
<i>Interestingly enough,
if</i> a <i>boy meets</i> a <i>girl,</i>

1021
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,612
<i>the family has no prob/em at all.</i>

1022
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:58,685
<i>In fact, they are happy</i>

1023
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,653
<i>he’s all grown up.</i>

1024
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:04,323
<i>But if a girl meets a boy,</i>

1025
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:06,727
<i>the family is apparent/y dishonoured.</i>

1026
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:10,129
<i>Whatever this logic</i> is...

1027
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,104
<i>ifs beyond my understanding.</i>

1028
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,034
God!

1029
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,403
Mom?

1030
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:51,738
Where were you all night?

1031
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,441
I was just hanging out.

1032
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:56,776
Hanging out what?

1033
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:58,615
Clothes?

1034
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,686
I was with a friend.

1035
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,019
We were talking.

1036
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,323
That's all.

1037
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:05,484
Who is this friend?

1038
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,696
Who is this friend?

1039
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,065
Kabir. ..

1040
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,227
Last night...

1041
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:44,424
Noorie was in Kabiﬁs room.

1042
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:47,491
L-low do you know'?

1043
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,068
Naina told me.

1044
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,505
She is very upset.

1045
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,739
That's good news, Neelu!

1046
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,545
What are you doing?

1047
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,205
She is so upset!

1048
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:03,984
I explained to her

1049
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,247
if the kids want to
be together then...

1050
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,181
We don't mind.

1051
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:09,120
Absolutely. We have no problem.

1052
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,663
Why would they have a problem?

1053
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,231
Noorie is Lalit Soocfs only daughter

1054
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,130
and Kamal has zero credibility
in the market today.

1055
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,508
Being related to us will benefit him.

1056
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:28,338
Come on, Lalit!

1057
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,341
Think of your own benefit.

1058
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:30,267
What?

1059
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:31,671
Noorie should get married.

1060
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:33,078
Come on, Naina.
- iCome on.

1061
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,649
If we have to help them for that

1062
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,649
what is the problem!

1063
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,118
You are just...

1064
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,313
Come on, trust me!

1065
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,695
Where are you taking me?

1066
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:52,131
Just come with me.

1067
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,734
You're making me nervous, Noorie.

1068
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,530
Sit.

1069
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:55,635
Why?

1070
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:57,104
Sit!

1071
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:01,067
If anyone asks, I was
with you last night...

1072
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:02,666
Please!

1073
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,443
Not bad, Noorieji!

1074
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,084
That's one hell of
an emergency landing.

1075
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:13,553
Shut up!

1076
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:15,649
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

1077
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:17,691
Don't worry...

1078
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,092
Your secret is safe with me.

1079
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,493
Thank you!
- Now listen.

1080
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,654
If anyone asks...

1081
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,722
Tell them I was a
little unwell so I left.

1082
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,598
Where are you going?

1083
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,526
Hey...

1084
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,657
Whafre you doing?

1085
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,416
<i>The ﬁrst time</i>

1086
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:30,361
<i>when I laid eyes on you</i>

1087
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,126
<i>Hear me girl,</i>

1088
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:38,099
<i>this is what I made of you</i>

1089
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:44,238
<i>I knew meeting you is the end of me</i>

1090
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:48,381
<i>I spoke to my heart and said baby</i>

1091
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:51,781
<i>Don? go down this road</i>

1092
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,755
<i>This is not meant to be</i>

1093
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,514
<i>But my heart...</i>

1094
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,589
<i>said aloud</i>

1095
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:03,430
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1096
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:07,298
<i>Have no fear, good or bad</i>

1097
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,062
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1098
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,971
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

1099
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:17,979
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

1100
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:21,444
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

1101
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:27,045
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

1102
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,185
<i>The ﬁrst time</i>

1103
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,131
<i>when I laid eyes on you</i>

1104
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,596
<i>Hear me boy,</i>

1105
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:46,664
<i>this is what I made of you</i>

1106
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,678
<i>I knew you take advice from your heart</i>

1107
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:56,743
<i>I knew you are siightiy crazy</i>

1108
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:00,510
<i>We’// speak of love when we meet</i>

1109
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,457
<i>And the things you
say will be very sweet</i>

1110
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,221
<i>But my heart...</i>

1111
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,292
<i>said aloud</i>

1112
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,192
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1113
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:16,067
<i>Have no fear, good or bad</i>

1114
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,638
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1115
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,540
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

1116
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,547
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

1117
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,212
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

1118
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:35,586
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

1119
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,222
<i>Like a Wave crashes into another,</i>

1120
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:21,292
<i>Our heartbeats intertwine</i>

1121
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:25,595
<i>We keep going, but lost in each other,</i>

1122
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:29,200
<i>Are our hearts and minds.</i>

1123
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,337
<i>How and why did we get so close</i>

1124
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:36,516
<i>It may seem like</i> a <i>small thing</i>

1125
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:40,210
<i>You’ve been thirsty for</i> a <i>while now</i>

1126
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,553
<i>And I too have been longing</i>

1127
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:47,354
<i>I knew meeting you is the end of me</i>

1128
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,497
<i>I spoke to my heart and said baby</i>

1129
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:55,101
<i>Don? go down this road</i>

1130
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:59,066
<i>This is not meant to be</i>

1131
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,630
<i>But my heart...</i>

1132
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,701
<i>said aloud</i>

1133
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,613
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1134
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,515
<i>Have no fear, good or bad</i>

1135
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,279
<i>What has to be, will be</i>

1136
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:17,188
<i>So, did you listen to your heart?</i>

1137
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,195
<i>So, did you choose your path?</i>

1138
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:24,655
<i>Yes, I heard my heart</i>

1139
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:30,228
<i>Yes, I chose my path!</i>

1140
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:44,176
Our ship is not so far from Egypt
that you can’t come.

1141
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,318
Anyway I don’t keep well these days...

1142
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,351
Who knows if I will be
able to travel again.

1143
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,184
Come, if you can...

1144
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:55,662
It will make me happy.

1145
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:56,794
Okay, son.

1146
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:57,728
See you.

1147
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:05,505
Come on, Amrish uncle

1148
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:07,770
VVasn’t that a little too melodramatic?

1149
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:11,369
These days to meet your kids

1150
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,010
you have to do a little drama.

1151
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,685
You haven’t seen Sunny
in a while, right?

1152
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:22,352
Yes.

1153
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,018
So he is in Egypt these days?

1154
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,362
Yes, EQYPt-

1155
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:34,360
Look...

1156
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:44,134
ls that his girlfriend?

1157
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:46,809
Who knows?

1158
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,574
As if he will tell his father.

1159
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,623
Hey...

1160
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,567
Thank you for inviting us.

1161
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,173
What are you saying, man...

1162
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:28,213
Listen...

1163
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,313
Can I speak to you honestly?

1164
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:31,555
Of course, Lalit.

1165
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:32,683
There are no secrets between us.

1166
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:36,791
What percentage of Ayka
are you planning to sell?

1167
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,357
Prem told me.

1168
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:43,766
49%.

1169
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:45,595
I'm not happy

1170
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,333
but it’s a way to expand the business.

1171
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,110
And what if I suggest...

1172
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:59,185
that we take our friendship...

1173
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,080
to the next level'?

1174
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,529
The kids have grown quite close.

1175
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:12,622
Yes even I noticed.

1176
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:14,230
Good!

1177
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:16,162
Noorie is a very sensible girl.

1178
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:22,533
So as I was saying...

1179
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:27,170
Those shares...

1180
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:30,674
Why don't I buy them?

1181
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:33,778
What?

1182
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:40,127
If Kabir and Noorie
really want to be together

1183
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,154
then the business will
stay in the family.

1184
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,562
Kabir and Noorie?

1185
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:50,370
WOW !

1186
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:54,741
The surprises life
throws at us, Lalit!

1187
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,239
You tell me!

1188
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:08,685
Cheers!

1189
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:10,352
Cheers!

1190
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:19,725
Good morning!

1191
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,265
Good morning!

1192
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:25,672
Breakfast?

1193
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:27,765
No...

1194
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,039
I have to host a dance
class for kids at 10.

1195
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,445
Come on, fearless Farah...

1196
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,073
Call in sick.

1197
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,309
Don’t you get sick leave?

1198
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,677
Of course!

1199
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:40,019
Without pay.

1200
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,086
So, I'll pa)' You-

1201
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,084
Money can't buy you everything, Ivlehra.

1202
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,562
It's just one day, Ali.

1203
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:52,691
Bunk it.

1204
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:55,701
You know...

1205
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,700
Some people actually
enjoy what they do.

1206
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,997
Obviously you are not one of them.

1207
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,149
Lunch?

1208
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:13,219
My treat.

1209
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,280
Lunch is not possible,

1210
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,550
I have a family commitment.

1211
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,614
You want to come with me?

1212
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:21,528
To your family lunch?

1213
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:22,756
Yes.

1214
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:23,996
Why should I suffer alone?

1215
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:28,297
Are you sure?

1216
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:29,265
Yes.

1217
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,337
Please come...

1218
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:32,702
You should also meet the loonies.

1219
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:36,609
Will you come?

1220
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:40,004
<i>Okay . ....</i>

1221
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:41,114
Yes!

1222
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:42,745
You saved me!

1223
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:58,390
If they've invited you, you must go.

1224
01:15:58,754 --> 01:15:59,698
Great! Thank you.

1225
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:01,966
We should make our guests
feel welcome.

1226
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,731
So attending a party is
well within the boundaries.

1227
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,529
Okay?

1228
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,605
Thanks!

1229
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:19,344
I told you it is not a theme party.

1230
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:25,356
Sorry...
I have to do this.

1231
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,557
You knew it was a heart attack?

1232
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:30,463
No.

1233
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:34,360
It's goofs grace,
that Vandana isn't a widows today.

1234
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:35,764
Widow.

1235
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,302
Drinking is allowed?

1236
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,068
Yes...
I exercise a little

1237
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,371
and I control my diets.

1238
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,706
Tell Neelu to control her diet too.

1239
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:48,509
Her food habits are very unhealthy.

1240
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,687
And wanting the body of
a 24 year old at his age

1241
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:55,120
is very healthy.

1242
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,055
Hello, beautiful!

1243
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,427
Kabir, where were you?

1244
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:08,426
Farah, this is my crazy sister, Ayesha.

1245
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,966
Everyone says that dad
gave us all this money...

1246
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:13,303
and you're crazy to
actually build the empire

1247
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:14,306
that we've built.

1248
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,410
You need to look at the great leaders
and learn from them-

1249
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:18,001
Who is that girl with Kabir?

1250
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,680
Oh!

1251
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:22,448
I know her.

1252
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:24,415
She is a dancer at Cha Cha Cha Club.

1253
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:26,142
She was fantastic.

1254
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:29,083
Oh! I think I've seen it
but from the outside.

1255
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,384
Hey Kabir, how's it going?

1256
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,095
Good bro...

1257
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,061
What happened?

1258
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,258
Who is that girl?

1259
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,737
Why is everyone asking about her?

1260
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:48,434
Who all?

1261
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:49,768
Naina Sood.

1262
01:17:55,605 --> 01:17:57,084
She is a friend... Why?

1263
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,548
Don’t you think it's inappropriate

1264
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:01,714
to bring her to the party?

1265
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,288
No, I don’t think so.

1266
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,019
Noorie could have a problem with it.

1267
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:08,560
Noorie?

1268
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:12,562
Naina has told us everything.

1269
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,399
Told you what?

1270
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,106
Noorie stayed in your room?

1271
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,703
Now don’t pretend.

1272
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:26,739
We know everything.

1273
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,743
Mom...Noorie is...

1274
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,250
From a respectable family,
as are you.

1275
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:39,083
What?

1276
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:40,523
What is so funny ya?

1277
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,291
ls it a joke?

1278
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,367
Kabir, ifs a serious matter!

1279
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,065
The Soods are also worried.

1280
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,075
Papa, please ya!

1281
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,006
Lalit spoke to me himself.

1282
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,943
I told him I'd speak
to you and let him know.

1283
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:03,178
Okay, tell me...

1284
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,349
What is your intention with Noorie?

1285
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,247
My intention?!

1286
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,478
Yes, your intention!

1287
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,059
Has anyone spoken to Noorie?

1288
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:14,522
I am sure her parents will talk to her.

1289
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:15,287
Good.

1290
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:18,331
Because she has no interest
in a future with me.

1291
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,066
Then make her interested!

1292
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:22,693
But even I am not interested.

1293
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,601
Are you interested in that plane?

1294
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:27,369
Tell me...

1295
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,534
Do you want the plane or not?

1296
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,977
Are you bribing me?

1297
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,014
Kabir, don't be silly...

1298
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,310
No, vvhafs going on?

1299
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:40,677
ls Lalit Sood investing in Ayka?

1300
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:42,147
Yes!

1301
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,054
If this marriage happens.

1302
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:49,495
He will buy 49% stake in Ayka.

1303
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,327
The company control stays with us...

1304
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:54,126
Stays with you!

1305
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,428
It will be perfect!

1306
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:57,669
And...

1307
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:00,098
We won’t have to sell the plane.

1308
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:02,500
You can have it,
all by yourself!

1309
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:03,475
You can take your friends...

1310
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:05,136
Fly Noorie around too!

1311
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,217
Noorie is such a lovely girl.

1312
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:19,458
Papa, what are you guys doing here?

1313
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,516
Everyone is asking...

1314
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:27,424
What is going on?

1315
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,697
You know what...

1316
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,506
Let me speak to Noorie.

1317
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:41,474
Good.

1318
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:44,448
About what?

1319
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:46,085
Tell your sister...

1320
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,485
Mom, please...

1321
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,181
I told you

1322
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,387
let me speak to Noorie first.

1323
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:51,316
Mom!

1324
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:54,494
Kabir and Noorie. ..

1325
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:59,397
What are you people doing?!

1326
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,128
What are we doing?

1327
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:03,596
Kabir, have you lost your mind?

1328
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:04,537
Lost your mind?

1329
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,672
They are made for each other!

1330
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,640
You said the same thing about Ivlanav and me

1331
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,767
and now I want a divorce-

1332
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:22,087
What did she say?

1333
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:53,111
Come here...

1334
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:54,613
What are you doing?

1335
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:01,323
Sunny is here.

1336
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:02,586
Oh my god!

1337
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:05,625
That's all I need...

1338
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,996
What is going on, dude...
You are freaking me out.

1339
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:08,726
I am freaking you out?
- Yes!

1340
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:09,731
I am freaking you out!

1341
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:10,697
And what are you doing?

1342
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,002
Don’t listen to them.

1343
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,406
You don't know them.

1344
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,308
Can you forget them for a moment?

1345
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:18,538
L-low can I'?

1346
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,205
They do everything
for their own benefit

1347
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:22,749
Kabir!

1348
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,413
Do you really want this marriage'?

1349
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:28,678
Do you really want this divorce?

1350
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,715
Has Ayesha mentioned this to you before?

1351
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,848
She said they are having problems.

1352
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:07,590
What problems?

1353
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:11,053
I don’t know...
I didn’t ask.

1354
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:13,164
You didn’t ask?

1355
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:15,601
You didn’t even ask?

1356
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:17,899
Are you deaf?

1357
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:21,768
I said what I had to.

1358
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:23,299
Every marriage has problems.

1359
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,272
No need to make it an issue, move on.

1360
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,839
What great advice, Neelam.

1361
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,642
She is moving on to a divorce.

1362
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:32,782
If you know better, speak to her.

1363
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:34,113
She is your daughter too.

1364
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,587
Why do you keep telling me?

1365
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:44,696
Should I ask Prem to talk to her?

1366
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:47,698
They are quite close.

1367
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,094
That's a brilliant idea!

1368
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:55,372
Then he'll tell lndu and that radio
will broadcast it all over Delhi.

1369
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:57,800
She just needs an
excuse to talk about me.

1370
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,244
I think it's a fantastic idea!

1371
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,548
Neelam ji will be really happy, Sunny.

1372
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,846
She’s asked about you twice.

1373
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,752
L-low long will you Keep working, Papa'?

1374
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:12,786
What else will I do?

1375
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:14,251
Retire...

1376
01:24:15,017 --> 01:24:15,825
I am here.

1377
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:17,990
L-low can I just quit'?

1378
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,158
L-low would they feel.

1379
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,159
They treat us like family.

1380
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:26,000
Who takes their manager on a cruise?

1381
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:30,208
Ayesha! Look...

1382
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,103
The melodrama worked!

1383
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:34,079
Yes...

1384
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:37,579
Don't be too long.

1385
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:39,118
They are waiting.

1386
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:51,656
Hi...

1387
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:52,265
Hi...

1388
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,827
I thought you weren't coming.

1389
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:57,703
Sorry to disappoint you.

1390
01:24:58,694 --> 01:24:59,798
No, not at all...

1391
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:01,368
Good you came.

1392
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,903
Amrish uncle was really missing you.

1393
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,044
You are looking good.

1394
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:10,808
Different.

1395
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:11,576
Yeah...

1396
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:12,249
Thanks!

1397
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:14,686
Everything else okay?

1398
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:16,280
Perfect.

1399
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:19,217
And your husband...

1400
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:20,619
Ivlanav.

1401
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:21,156
Ivlanav.

1402
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,261
Sorry... l-low is he'?

1403
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:23,319
He is amazing.

1404
01:25:24,019 --> 01:25:25,930
I've been very lucky, touchvvood.

1405
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:27,859
That's great.

1406
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:29,597
Yes...

1407
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,827
Oh my God!

1408
01:25:31,894 --> 01:25:34,170
It's Captain Sunny Gill!

1409
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,070
It's Mr. Captain to you.

1410
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:38,135
Mr. Captain Sunny Gill!

1411
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,349
<i>You never know who you'll run into</i>

1412
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:46,347
<i>when you turn a corner.</i>

1413
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:51,952
<i>Sunny Gill.</i>

1414
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:56,994
<i>There was a time when Sunny
and Ayesha were very close.</i>

1415
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,860
<i>The best of friends.</i>

1416
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:03,667
<i>H1 fact, Sunny was the
one who gave me to Ayesha.</i>

1417
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:05,905
Those were the days.

1418
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,005
<i>Sunny, Ayesha and Kabir.</i>

1419
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:10,043
<i>That was my who/e world.</i>

1420
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,807
<i>Then Sunny went far</i> away.

1421
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,114
<i>Ayesha got married.</i>

1422
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,650
<i>Her new family didrft want me.</i>

1423
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:22,655
<i>And I ended up with Kabir.</i>

1424
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:27,092
Today, once again,
we are all together...

1425
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,026
<i>and ab' I can hope for is that</i>

1426
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,256
<i>this time it stays that way.</i>

1427
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:40,999
God bless you!

1428
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,734
Big journalist you have become.

1429
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:46,579
I try to read your articles,

1430
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,978
but they are very depressing.

1431
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,844
All this bloodshed, war...

1432
01:26:50,139 --> 01:26:51,846
Write some good news also!

1433
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,281
I write in the hope that one day

1434
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:55,015
the news will get better.

1435
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,189
Neelu!

1436
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:58,353
Just look at this...

1437
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:01,222
That's beautiful!

1438
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:02,784
It's from Egypt-

1439
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:03,923
Beautiful... Thank you.

1440
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:04,657
You are most welcome.

1441
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,730
And also...

1442
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:06,898
Thank you for the cheque.

1443
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,532
Who pays back money these days.

1444
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:11,199
That too with interest, Amrish saab!

1445
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:14,764
I could never really repay you

1446
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,106
for all you've done for me.

1447
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,239
Oh ho! Come here...

1448
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,944
You’re like our son.

1449
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,851
Now go get ready.

1450
01:27:29,144 --> 01:27:32,023
Let's put our Punjabi livers to use!

1451
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:32,821
Okay!

1452
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,027
Bye, son!

1453
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,200
Why did you take money from him?

1454
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:50,208
He insisted, so I had to.

1455
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:51,208
Why?

1456
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:56,015
He is a good kid.

1457
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:58,952
I am glad he is doing so well.

1458
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,817
I always knew he has it in him.

1459
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,890
I'm glad I sent him
to study in America.

1460
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,285
You sent him to study?

1461
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,625
As far as I can remember

1462
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,166
you had another reason.

1463
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:53,935
Neelam.

1464
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:56,235
Sorry we are late.

1465
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:58,172
Actually, we were
waiting for our friends.

1466
01:28:58,567 --> 01:28:59,944
They live here in Kusadasi.

1467
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:01,313
Sandhya

1468
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:02,071
Naren

1469
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:02,808
Hi!

1470
01:29:03,872 --> 01:29:04,850
And this is Guler.

1471
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:05,810
Oh yes.

1472
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,145
Guler.

1473
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:07,811
Hello...

1474
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:08,888
Hi!

1475
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:11,223
Guler.

1476
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:12,116
Gyuler.

1477
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:13,589
Gyuler. ..

1478
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:14,524
That's better.

1479
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:16,826
Shall we?

1480
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:18,860
Where is Noorie?

1481
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:20,132
Don't ask!

1482
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:21,133
You know how these Kids are.

1483
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,567
She has left us

1484
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,262
and gone outwith their son Kabir.

1485
01:29:53,589 --> 01:29:54,067
Mom!

1486
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:01,202
Don't worry about Ivlanav & me...

1487
01:30:01,263 --> 01:30:02,139
We're fine.

1488
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:04,541
I don't know why I said all that.

1489
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:05,841
Good.

1490
01:30:07,269 --> 01:30:08,907
I think I was really upset and-

1491
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:09,915
Not now, Ayesha.

1492
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:11,949
We'll talk later.

1493
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:17,950
<i>Smka M. ....</i>

1494
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:18,682
Ivlanav...

1495
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:19,190
Namaste.

1496
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:20,959
He is a journalist.

1497
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,959
He writes for The Geographic.

1498
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,657
It's very big papeF---

1499
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:26,765
You must be reading it?

1500
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:27,560
Papa...

1501
01:30:27,723 --> 01:30:28,201
Please.

1502
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:29,533
That's okay...

1503
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:31,065
Let him show off, it's only fair.

1504
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,230
Better if he did it behind my back.

1505
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:34,867
Hi.

1506
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:37,173
Hi.

1507
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:38,533
My wife, Ayesha.

1508
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,941
They used to be best friends.

1509
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,544
Used to be meaning?

1510
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:44,914
Nothing...

1511
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,584
He went away to America.

1512
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:50,214
Where did you study, son?

1513
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:52,181
Yale, aunty.

1514
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:53,189
Oh!

1515
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:55,785
My uncle used to read law there...

1516
01:30:56,218 --> 01:30:58,220
'68...maybe '69...

1517
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,293
Will she hang it on the walls?

1518
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:02,158
You can hang carpets
on the wall right?

1519
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,866
I guess if you don't understand art

1520
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:06,099
then you should hang carpets!

1521
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:09,635
Excuse me.

1522
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:12,238
That's an amazing story.

1523
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,644
Thank you.

1524
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:15,780
Thank you for listening.

1525
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:16,844
Neelam...

1526
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:18,211
Come sit with us.

1527
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:19,913
I am sure they'll
give us another chair.

1528
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:21,782
No, lam good...
I am really good.

1529
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:24,117
I just wanted to borrow
my husband for a minute...

1530
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:24,986
Of course.

1531
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:25,851
Darling

1532
01:31:35,724 --> 01:31:38,068
Do you have to do this
on our anniversary?

1533
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:40,202
Why, what did I do?

1534
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,573
Please don’t embarrass me, Kamal.

1535
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,769
You've been stuck to
that Guler like a leech.

1536
01:31:47,736 --> 01:31:48,680
Have you gone mad?

1537
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,006
They are our guests.

1538
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,083
I am just looking after them
and so should you.

1539
01:32:56,638 --> 01:32:58,140
You know Noorie and me are together?

1540
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:00,712
So why did you propose to her?

1541
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:01,747
Me?

1542
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,120
Kamal uncle spoke to my parents.

1543
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:05,124
Excuse me?

1544
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,184
Your parents spoke to my dad-

1545
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:08,125
Whatever, Kabir.

1546
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:09,226
You could have said no.

1547
01:33:09,284 --> 01:33:09,887
No.

1548
01:33:10,886 --> 01:33:12,263
Because thanks to
Noorie, everyone thinks

1549
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,765
she is in my room every night.

1550
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:15,961
Thank you...

1551
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17,293
For keeping quiet.

1552
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:18,603
But enough now.

1553
01:33:18,994 --> 01:33:20,940
We are not in school.

1554
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:23,709
I don't care what our families think.

1555
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,210
I care, baby.

1556
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:31,216
Babies!

1557
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,315
You guys really like each other.

1558
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:37,716
WOW !

1559
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,617
Your story is just
like Romeo and Juliet...

1560
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,290
Warring families, tragic ending...

1561
01:33:45,654 --> 01:33:47,133
That was a bad space, man!

1562
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,098
But what if I say...

1563
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,873
That your story can
have a happy twist...

1564
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:00,641
How?

1565
01:34:03,205 --> 01:34:04,149
By getting engaged to me.

1566
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:05,150
Excuse me?

1567
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,550
No, no... Wait. Hear me out...

1568
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:08,650
Just for now.

1569
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:12,216
Mom, Dad, Uncle,
Aunty, everyone happy!

1570
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:14,055
Then...

1571
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,854
A few months later...

1572
01:34:18,053 --> 01:34:19,031
I will dump you.

1573
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:20,731
Great!
- Wait, wait...

1574
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,764
Then...

1575
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:26,272
You cry, shout, scream, pass out...

1576
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:27,898
Try to kill yourself...

1577
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:28,600
Sure!

1578
01:34:28,697 --> 01:34:30,973
Your parents will do
anything to save you.

1579
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:32,670
Right?

1580
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:34,772
Then...

1581
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,975
You say...

1582
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:38,877
"I want to be with Noorie."

1583
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:41,950
That's it...

1584
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:44,589
For your parents he will be like

1585
01:34:44,646 --> 01:34:45,716
a knight in shining armour!

1586
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:50,262
It's genius!

1587
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,222
And what about your parents?

1588
01:34:55,757 --> 01:34:56,963
What do you mean cancel the wedding?

1589
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,334
The cards have been printed.

1590
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:01,806
What do I do?

1591
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:06,043
Noorie loves someone else.

1592
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:07,945
Who?

1593
01:35:09,838 --> 01:35:10,748
She loves Rana.

1594
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,716
Rana Khanna?

1595
01:35:13,742 --> 01:35:15,813
Because of their family
problems, she agreed-

1596
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:16,878
This is ridiculous!

1597
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:18,680
I'm going to call Naina right now.

1598
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:20,790
It isn't Noorie's fault, Mom!

1599
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:22,753
It's mine.

1600
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,121
So stupid...

1601
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,736
I did all this for the company.

1602
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:35,337
But I really fell in love with her.

1603
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,146
I just want her to be happy.

1604
01:35:41,803 --> 01:35:42,873
That's all I want.

1605
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:45,582
Oh my baby...

1606
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:47,746
Oh my child...

1607
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,649
I made a big mistake.

1608
01:35:53,048 --> 01:35:54,755
What are we going to do, Papa?

1609
01:35:56,885 --> 01:35:57,829
You should sell the plane.

1610
01:35:58,119 --> 01:35:58,961
No...

1611
01:35:59,187 --> 01:35:59,961
No!

1612
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:01,199
Absolutely not!

1613
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,160
That's the least we can do for him.

1614
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,214
You look very happy...

1615
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,981
I am thinking about our bright future.

1616
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:31,694
I've seen many make
promises on this ship.

1617
01:36:32,654 --> 01:36:33,997
But as soon as the journey ends...

1618
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:35,194
Poof!

1619
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:36,965
Gone!

1620
01:36:39,995 --> 01:36:41,269
Are you allergic to romance?

1621
01:36:42,597 --> 01:36:43,575
I am being practical.

1622
01:36:43,932 --> 01:36:45,843
Being practical!!!

1623
01:36:46,768 --> 01:36:48,213
ls that what they teach you in London

1624
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:49,646
is to be practical?

1625
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:52,908
You see it's very important
for every individual to be practical!

1626
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:55,046
If Shah Jehan was practical,

1627
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:56,783
who would've built the Taj Mahal'?

1628
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:01,225
What are you doing?

1629
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:02,884
Say you love me...

1630
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:04,521
What?

1631
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:05,526
Say you love me.

1632
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:06,298
No...

1633
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:07,562
Say it.

1634
01:37:07,756 --> 01:37:08,200
No!

1635
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:08,927
Say it!

1636
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:10,763
Kabir stop it, I am really ticklish.

1637
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,101
No!

1638
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:13,701
Say it!

1639
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:21,145
I love you!

1640
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,244
You could be on any ship...

1641
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,255
It won't sail without me.

1642
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:53,866
Awesome!

1643
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,206
Thank you!

1644
01:38:56,331 --> 01:38:56,968
Who's next?

1645
01:38:57,732 --> 01:38:58,176
Me!

1646
01:39:06,074 --> 01:39:07,052
Kiss me!

1647
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,223
Any requests?

1648
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:22,964
Who did this?

1649
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:24,797
What nonsense is this?

1650
01:39:26,027 --> 01:39:26,937
Who did it?

1651
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:28,038
Don't laugh, Jamaal.

1652
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:29,039
This is rubbish!

1653
01:39:30,098 --> 01:39:30,838
I am waiting.

1654
01:39:31,566 --> 01:39:31,941
<i>Bhabhi J5!</i>

1655
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,035
Vinod, don't get involved.

1656
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:34,307
It was a jokes.

1657
01:39:35,237 --> 01:39:36,545
Bhabhi ji, it was a jokes.

1658
01:39:36,604 --> 01:39:37,981
Kids joke.

1659
01:39:38,173 --> 01:39:40,653
This is very wrong, whoever did this.

1660
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:41,719
Don't do it again.

1661
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,216
Okay? Sorted?

1662
01:39:43,712 --> 01:39:44,747
Now have a drinks!

1663
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:49,554
OK now, a song for the host couples!

1664
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:02,767
<i>PH break into a bhangra</i>

1665
01:40:02,797 --> 01:40:04,208
<i>You also put on your dancing shoes</i>

1666
01:40:04,566 --> 01:40:06,568
<i>Come on, Iefs paint this town red</i>

1667
01:40:06,634 --> 01:40:08,739
<i>And get everyone to
show us their</i> moves

1668
01:40:12,607 --> 01:40:14,780
<i>I feel like fetching</i>

1669
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:16,584
For you the stars <i>&</i> the moon

1670
01:40:16,645 --> 01:40:18,556
<i>The moon, PH place in my hand</i>

1671
01:40:18,613 --> 01:40:20,786
<i>In my hair, will be the stars strewn.</i>

1672
01:40:24,652 --> 01:40:26,097
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

1673
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:28,589
<i>Since you’ve hit the floor</i>

1674
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:30,067
<i>YeHo YeHo...</i>

1675
01:40:30,658 --> 01:40:32,569
<i>A magic night is in store</i>

1676
01:40:32,627 --> 01:40:34,265
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

1677
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:36,609
You seem to have consumed a lot

1678
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:38,109
<i>YeHo YeHo...</i>

1679
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:40,873
<i>Brother, you got no control at all!</i>

1680
01:40:40,902 --> 01:40:42,813
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

1681
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:45,784
<i>The bangles from Punjab are tinkiing</i>

1682
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,945
<i>The night is fun, so my dearest one</i>

1683
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,649

<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

1688
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:18,844
<i>That ﬂutter in your eyes</i>

1689
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:20,545
<i>Tortures me</i> a <i>lot</i>

1690
01:41:20,608 --> 01:41:22,849
<i>Till date you just have to look at me</i>

1691
01:41:22,877 --> 01:41:24,982
<i>And an arrow hits the spot</i>

1692
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:30,856
<i>Without a drink I get high</i>

1693
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,296
<i>Your beauty is all I need</i>

1694
01:41:32,687 --> 01:41:34,667
<i>How can anyone stay sane</i>

1695
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:37,066
<i>With</i> the restlessness
you make them feel

1696
01:41:40,662 --> 01:41:42,107
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

1697
01:41:42,697 --> 01:41:44,677
<i>These hearts must connect</i>

1698
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:46,610
Ye/lo Ye/lo. . .

1699
01:41:46,634 --> 01:41:48,910
<i>The line should be direct</i>

1700
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:50,710

1702
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:55,683

01:41:55,744 --> 01:41:58,748
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

1704
01:42:06,855 --> 01:42:08,596
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

1705
01:42:08,656 --> 01:42:11,660

1706
01:42:11,893 --> 01:42:13,668

01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:24,571
<i>Explained to me</i>

1712
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:26,335
<i>The thing that everyone wants</i>

1713
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:28,747
<i>is to ﬁnd their dream woman or man</i>

1714
01:43:28,803 --> 01:43:30,646
<i>That is what has happened here</i>

1715
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:32,978

<i>The song you are sing</i>

<i>Tougher than ﬁnding the love</i>

1719
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:40,750
<i>is honoring the thing</i>

1720
01:43:40,815 --> 01:43:42,294
<i>Hello Hello...</i>

1724
01:43:49,123 --> 01:43:50,864
<i>The heart beats hard and fast</i>

1731
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:16,919
<i>Lets get down to some mingling</i>

1732
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,269
Here you all are!

1733
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,143
Delhi's Beyonce!!!

1734
01:44:34,202 --> 01:44:35,840
lndu Aunty!!!

1735
01:44:40,908 --> 01:44:41,818
You are the one!

1736
01:44:42,243 --> 01:44:43,347
She is a star!

1737
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:46,053
Why are you in the bar, Putlu?

1738
01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:48,355
Where else would I
be after your dance?

1739
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:49,623
Shut up!

1740
01:44:49,851 --> 01:44:51,626
lndu Aunty you were amazing!

1741
01:44:51,886 --> 01:44:52,990
Thanks!
- So good!

1742
01:44:53,354 --> 01:44:54,594
I got carried away.

1743
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:56,860
I would never do this in Delhi.

1744
01:44:57,592 --> 01:44:58,696
What would people think?

1745
01:44:58,926 --> 01:45:00,599
They won’t think anything.

1746
01:45:00,662 --> 01:45:02,107
We are ready for your talent.

1747
01:45:03,064 --> 01:45:04,566
Maybe you are ready

1748
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:06,737
but what will the public say?

1749
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:08,272
You will have to migrate now,

1750
01:45:08,536 --> 01:45:09,742
it's about your image!

1751
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:14,983
You journalists make such
a big deal about everything.

1752
01:45:15,009 --> 01:45:16,147
Big deal?

1753
01:45:17,178 --> 01:45:17,781
Really?

1754
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:19,951
Yes... Seriously.

1755
01:45:20,615 --> 01:45:23,061
Look what you're writing
on women's issues...

1756
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:25,831
You people make it seem like

1757
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:29,200
women here are unsafe all the time.

1758
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:31,864
Every survey seems to say that.

1759
01:45:32,627 --> 01:45:33,867
And it’s not just about safety,

1760
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:36,168
it's also about equal rights-

1761
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:37,607
Precisely, things are changing.

1762
01:45:37,799 --> 01:45:39,107
Slowly but surely,
things are changing.

1763
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:40,601
Take my own family...

1764
01:45:41,302 --> 01:45:44,283
Till my dads generation,
no woman had worked.

1765
01:45:44,305 --> 01:45:44,874
Never!

1766
01:45:46,274 --> 01:45:48,652
But I allowed Ayesha
to run her business.

1767
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:53,291
You allowed Ayesha?

1768
01:45:53,614 --> 01:45:54,092
Yes!

1769
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,694
And why does she need your permission?

1770
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:01,129
You know what I mean.

1771
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:03,591
No, I don't know what you mean.

1772
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:06,069
Allowing someone means you are

1773
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,265
in a position of
authority, of control...

1774
01:46:09,297 --> 01:46:10,833
And that is not equality.

1775
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:14,237
But thank you.

1776
01:46:15,169 --> 01:46:17,672
You just proved my point.

1777
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:20,882
Cheers!

1778
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:23,720
I love you...

1779
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:30,256
<i>Indu year!</i>

1780
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:37,099
Sunny!

1781
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,961
What was that?

1782
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:42,172
What?

1783
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:45,171
What was the need to be rude to Ivlanav?

1784
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,208
Why put him down?

1785
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:48,212
What was the point...

1786
01:46:48,269 --> 01:46:49,646
And he can put you down?

1787
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:52,914
Q Kay-

1788
01:46:56,177 --> 01:46:57,315
I am still talking to you.

1789
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:58,318
What do you want to say?

1790
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:01,285
What do you want to say?

1791
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:07,556
I know you sold yourjewellery

1792
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:08,827
to start your business.

1793
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:10,834
Without anybody's help

1794
01:47:10,892 --> 01:47:12,565
look at where you've reached.

1795
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:14,065
And I am really proud of you!

1796
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:17,265
That's it.

1797
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:08,049
Who the hell does he think he is?

1798
01:48:10,117 --> 01:48:11,892
L-low can he lecture me about you'?

1799
01:48:13,754 --> 01:48:16,098
He must think I ill-treat you.

1800
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:18,227
Ridiculous!

1801
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:20,938
Bloody journalist-activist types.

1802
01:48:21,696 --> 01:48:22,902
They have no balance.

1803
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:24,733
Everything is black or white for them.

1804
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:29,309
Don't I have a say
in what my wife does?

1805
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:32,046
Don't I have the right to an opinion?

1806
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:34,885
We are a married couple, dammit.

1807
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:36,880
I have the right.

1808
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:37,752
I want a divorce...

1809
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:40,714
And when I said that I allow you,

1810
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:41,985
it doesn't mean that-

1811
01:48:42,049 --> 01:48:43,119
I want a divorce.

1812
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:45,128
What?

1813
01:48:49,056 --> 01:48:50,330
You want a divorce...

1814
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:53,798
Because of that stupid argument?

1815
01:48:58,065 --> 01:48:59,874
Because I don't love you.

1816
01:49:07,775 --> 01:49:09,516
I really tried, Ivlanav...

1817
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:18,560
But I can't pretend anymore.

1818
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:21,192
I can't...

1819
01:49:23,857 --> 01:49:25,530
I really tried.

1820
01:49:30,297 --> 01:49:31,105
I am sorry...

1821
01:49:35,169 --> 01:49:37,775
I'm sorry I couldn't love you.

1822
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,243
I am sorry...

1823
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,764
You should have spoken to me...

1824
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:04,707
I am also like your mother.

1825
01:50:11,772 --> 01:50:12,750
Never mind...

1826
01:50:13,974 --> 01:50:14,918
What is the problem?

1827
01:50:22,283 --> 01:50:26,754
I don't feel for Ivlanav

1828
01:50:29,256 --> 01:50:31,133
the way I am supposed to.

1829
01:50:31,926 --> 01:50:32,666
But...

1830
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,102
What is the problem?

1831
01:50:45,873 --> 01:50:48,012
We are not right for each other...

1832
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:51,314
We are not compatible-

1833
01:50:51,545 --> 01:50:52,319
Not compatible? How?

1834
01:50:55,716 --> 01:50:56,694
You are both young,

1835
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:57,826
successful,

1836
01:50:58,586 --> 01:50:58,996
Punjabi...

1837
01:50:59,052 --> 01:50:59,996
You both play squash.

1838
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:00,896
Tennis.

1839
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:03,866
Yes Papa, but...

1840
01:51:05,559 --> 01:51:07,129
We are still very different.

1841
01:51:08,763 --> 01:51:09,867
Ivlanav is your husband

1842
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:10,874
not your twin brother.

1843
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:14,873
Has he ever hit you?

1844
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:16,203
God!

1845
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:17,647
No, Mom!

1846
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:20,609
ls he stingy?

1847
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,885
You don't let her shop?

1848
01:51:30,784 --> 01:51:32,092
ls he having an affair?

1849
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:33,958
No!

1850
01:51:37,558 --> 01:51:39,663
Even Ivlanav won't be happy with me.

1851
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:40,999
That is my decision, Aysh.

1852
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:47,710
Every marriage has problems.

1853
01:51:48,602 --> 01:51:52,106
Just have a baby,
everything will be fine.

1854
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:55,011
You are right.

1855
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:57,648
When you become a mother,

1856
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:01,316
all these problems will go away.

1857
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:06,664
If I'm not happy in this relationship,

1858
01:52:06,987 --> 01:52:09,627
then having a baby...

1859
01:52:14,128 --> 01:52:15,664
It didn't feel right.

1860
01:52:19,133 --> 01:52:20,806
I've been on the pill.

1861
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:24,545
What?

1862
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:30,150
This is not the place
for this conversation.

1863
01:52:32,145 --> 01:52:32,953
Sorry...

1864
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:34,287
You are right,

1865
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:36,785
this is between Ivlanav and me.

1866
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:37,861
We are family!

1867
01:52:39,553 --> 01:52:41,897
We are here to celebrate
our anniversary.

1868
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,561
What will our guests
think if they hear this?

1869
01:52:46,026 --> 01:52:47,061
Have you thought about that!

1870
01:52:49,163 --> 01:52:51,040
There has been no
divorce in this family

1871
01:52:51,832 --> 01:52:52,867
and there never will be.

1872
01:52:54,301 --> 01:52:55,905
You get that straight!

1873
01:53:05,179 --> 01:53:07,284
Now tell me this won't
ever come up again.

1874
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,562
I am talking to you, Ayesha.

1875
01:53:14,054 --> 01:53:14,828
Answer me!

1876
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:26,903
I am sorry, Papa.

1877
01:53:28,568 --> 01:53:29,842
I can’t do that.

1878
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:34,044
So you're just going to leave?

1879
01:53:36,043 --> 01:53:37,886
Why are you doing this to us?

1880
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:42,590
Don’t think you can come back to us.

1881
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:47,030
That is not your home anymore.

1882
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:52,161
We are not going to
support this nonsense.

1883
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:03,812
Q Kay-

1884
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:07,550
Q Kay-

1885
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:13,620
Q Kay-

1886
01:54:16,817 --> 01:54:17,727
Where are you going?

1887
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:18,996
Ayeshal!

1888
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:21,723
Kabir.

1889
01:54:21,889 --> 01:54:22,663
Just go and get her.

1890
01:54:32,066 --> 01:54:32,840
Ya, Papa...

1891
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:36,578
I am looking...
I can't seem to find her.

1892
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:38,913
Q Kay-

1893
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:48,156
Yes, I am still looking.

1894
01:55:25,986 --> 01:55:26,930
Where is Ayesha?

1895
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,663
She is very upset.

1896
01:55:29,957 --> 01:55:30,833
She is upset?

1897
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:31,595
Why?

1898
01:55:32,993 --> 01:55:36,770
Papa, how could you tell
her she can't come home'?

1899
01:55:40,634 --> 01:55:42,307
I'm doing this for her benefit.

1900
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,342
It is for her own good.

1901
01:55:45,839 --> 01:55:47,113
If Ayesha is not welcome at home,

1902
01:55:47,141 --> 01:55:48,677
then I can't live there either.

1903
01:55:52,813 --> 01:55:53,757
What is this drama?

1904
01:55:53,814 --> 01:55:54,690
It's not drama.

1905
01:55:54,748 --> 01:55:55,988
Then what? Emotional blackmail?

1906
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:57,721
Are you emotionally blackmailing me?

1907
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,058
Think what you want...

1908
01:56:00,253 --> 01:56:01,061
Then go...

1909
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:02,729
Get out.

1910
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:04,863
Let's see how far you reach.

1911
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:08,197
You can’t even get a day’s work done.

1912
01:56:12,766 --> 01:56:13,972
What have you done in life?

1913
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:15,075
Tell me?

1914
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:17,047
What do you have?

1915
01:56:17,605 --> 01:56:18,276
Nothing!

1916
01:56:19,606 --> 01:56:22,212
You are lucky, I am your father.

1917
01:56:23,577 --> 01:56:24,112
Go...

1918
01:56:24,678 --> 01:56:25,884
Try working outside.

1919
01:56:26,914 --> 01:56:29,053
You'll come to your
senses in two days.

1920
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,061
Bloody idiot.

1921
01:56:46,033 --> 01:56:48,240
People say things they
don't mean in anger.

1922
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:51,241
He was right...

1923
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:56,654
What have I done?

1924
01:56:59,145 --> 01:57:00,647
What do I have?

1925
01:57:08,088 --> 01:57:09,567
You have this...

1926
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:12,168
And this.

1927
01:57:14,795 --> 01:57:17,036
Take a decision from the heart.

1928
01:57:18,131 --> 01:57:20,008
Your mind will figure a way out.

1929
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:24,142
ls it that simple?

1930
01:57:25,305 --> 01:57:25,908
No.

1931
01:57:27,107 --> 01:57:28,916
Some hard work is also required.

1932
01:57:31,879 --> 01:57:33,552
Will the soles of my shoes wear out?

1933
01:57:33,847 --> 01:57:34,552
What?

1934
01:57:41,088 --> 01:57:42,567
You're in love, baby!

1935
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:43,096
Shut up...

1936
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:46,896
You're in a bad space, man!

1937
01:57:50,697 --> 01:57:51,937
I won't ditch you.

1938
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,135
As soon as the
engagement is announced,

1939
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,611
I'll dump you.

1940
01:57:55,803 --> 01:57:56,941
Until then just...

1941
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:15,824
Careful, please!

1942
01:58:19,526 --> 01:58:21,597
Sorry, didn’t mean to ruin your plan.

1943
01:58:22,296 --> 01:58:23,274
What plan?

1944
01:58:24,664 --> 01:58:26,007
You were about to jump right?

1945
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:37,282
Listen you were right...

1946
01:58:38,812 --> 01:58:40,723
I shouldn’t have spoken
to Ivlanav like that.

1947
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:43,822
It was rude.

1948
01:58:44,885 --> 01:58:46,330
It's your marriage...

1949
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,066
What is right or wrong

1950
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:50,891
is none of my business.

1951
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:53,293
Just wanted to say

1952
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:55,101
I won't cross the line again.

1953
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:57,665
I'm really sorry.

1954
01:59:07,941 --> 01:59:08,919
Friends?

1955
01:59:12,078 --> 01:59:12,920

’d rather jump.

1956
01:59:18,785 --> 01:59:19,195
Come on, Pluto.

1957
01:59:20,153 --> 01:59:20,961
Come on, baby.

1958
01:59:23,857 --> 01:59:24,232
Come on!

1959
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:32,872
I guess he wants to stay.

1960
01:59:49,082 --> 01:59:49,822
Pluto...

1961
01:59:52,786 --> 01:59:54,993
You were supposed to
remind her of me...

1962
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:58,761
What happened buddy?

1963
02:00:06,666 --> 02:00:08,668
<i>Human beings are so strange...</i>

1964
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:11,604
<i>The things they say to someone</i>

1965
02:00:11,672 --> 02:00:13,709
are often meant for someone else.

1966
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:17,952
<i>And the conversation they
shy away from the most</i>

1967
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:22,891
<i>is of the heart, of love.</i>

1968
02:00:23,683 --> 02:00:25,788
<i>But ifs the only thing that matters.</i>

1969
02:00:27,788 --> 02:00:29,893
<i>Now how to explain to them</i>

1970
02:00:29,957 --> 02:00:32,665
<i>that if you love someone,</i>

1971
02:00:33,093 --> 02:00:34,902
<i>just show it.</i>

1972
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:03,267
<i>There’re no roads, near or far</i>

1973
02:01:03,557 --> 02:01:06,094
<i>Where a twist or a turn, is ever afar</i>

1974
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:09,266
<i>This heart wants to let it go</i>

1975
02:01:09,663 --> 02:01:12,576
<i>These rafters, don? you try to sew</i>

1976
02:01:12,733 --> 02:01:15,213
<i>The road We Walk,</i>

1977
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,939
<i>Many a times, forks into two</i>

1978
02:01:18,905 --> 02:01:21,215
<i>At every step, we find the love,</i>

1979
02:01:21,975 --> 02:01:25,184
At every other, <i>it</i> leaves us <i>blue.</i>

1980
02:01:25,645 --> 02:01:26,783
<i>But still this life</i>

1981
02:01:26,847 --> 02:01:28,190
For even a second

1982
02:01:28,248 --> 02:01:30,819
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

1983
02:01:31,584 --> 02:01:32,824
These waves of time

1984
02:01:32,886 --> 02:01:34,763
For even a second

1985
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:36,927
<i>Just doesn't stop</i>

1986
02:01:36,957 --> 02:01:39,164
<i>This loneliness. . .</i>

1987
02:01:40,126 --> 02:01:48,045
becomes the air <i>I</i> breathe. <i>. .</i>

1988
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:55,676
<i>l know not, What to do...</i>

1989
02:02:08,255 --> 02:02:13,568
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

1990
02:02:14,594 --> 02:02:19,043
<i>These threads in a tangie,</i>

1991
02:02:19,499 --> 02:02:22,742
<i>Straighten them out . ..</i>

1992
02:02:23,637 --> 02:02:27,813
<i>FoHow the heart, you dreamer</i>

1993
02:02:28,141 --> 02:02:33,614
<i>It tells the truth, have no doubt</i>

1994
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:44,536
<i>There</i> is a restlessness <i>in my</i> hopes;

1995
02:02:44,724 --> 02:02:49,002
<i>A dream rests on shut eyes</i>

1996
02:02:50,764 --> 02:02:56,146
<i>This longing I had put to sleep,</i>

1997
02:02:56,803 --> 02:03:01,843
<i>Once again, is aching to rise</i>

1998
02:03:02,909 --> 02:03:05,913
<i>Which road you want to take...</i>

1999
02:03:05,979 --> 02:03:14,865
<i>why don? you know my crazy head.</i> ..

2000
02:03:15,054 --> 02:03:16,192
<i>But still this life</i>

2001
02:03:16,256 --> 02:03:17,792

02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,726
That Anju is an alcoholic!

2016
02:04:24,157 --> 02:04:26,728
She cans a crate of
champagne every evening.

2017
02:04:32,732 --> 02:04:33,642
What are you taking?

2018
02:04:36,036 --> 02:04:38,209
Something to help digest this bill.

2019
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,717
Why don’t you announce
Kabiﬁs engagement?

2020
02:04:49,883 --> 02:04:52,329
Waiting on Soocfs astrologer.

2021
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:54,124
Can you believe it?

2022
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:57,964
No one is ready to believe

2023
02:04:58,024 --> 02:05:00,231
that Lalit Sood is
investing in our company.

2024
02:05:01,061 --> 02:05:03,166
This news will shut them up.

2025
02:05:15,875 --> 02:05:17,252
Did you tell lndu
about the engagement?

2026
02:05:17,644 --> 02:05:18,281
No!

2027
02:05:19,779 --> 02:05:21,690
She can't keep
anything in her stomach.

2028
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:26,824
Then it is time to
give her the good news...

2029
02:05:29,723 --> 02:05:30,701
This Noorie...

2030
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:32,635
is very smart.

2031
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:34,133
Why?

2032
02:05:34,794 --> 02:05:35,704
Just tell us now.

2033
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:39,200
She has gone and conquered Kabir.

2034
02:05:41,301 --> 02:05:42,803
Kabir and Noorie?

2035
02:05:43,837 --> 02:05:45,009
I didn't say anything.

2036
02:05:46,873 --> 02:05:48,318
I'm just worried about Divya.

2037
02:05:48,575 --> 02:05:50,577
That girl needs to up her game.

2038
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:52,747
L-low to dress, how to behave...

2039
02:05:53,846 --> 02:05:56,019
I was so impressed with your Rana...

2040
02:05:56,616 --> 02:05:59,062
But she went and vomited on him.

2041
02:05:59,986 --> 02:06:00,726
What?!

2042
02:06:01,788 --> 02:06:02,266
Yes...

2043
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:05,228
That chapter is closed for me.

2044
02:06:05,792 --> 02:06:06,770
lam moving on.

2045
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,766
What do you think about Sunny?

2046
02:06:09,129 --> 02:06:10,267
Very handsome

2047
02:06:11,231 --> 02:06:12,073
and different.

2048
02:06:12,598 --> 02:06:13,542
What is different?

2049
02:06:13,633 --> 02:06:15,635
All men want the same kind of wife.

2050
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:17,804
I'll talk to Neelu Bhabhi.

2051
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:18,848
About what?

2052
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:23,710
About Divya & Sunny's match...

2053
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,286
isn't Divya a bit young'?

2054
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:32,755
What is young?

2055
02:06:33,053 --> 02:06:35,260
At her age, your mother had two kids.

2056
02:06:36,256 --> 02:06:36,996
Talk to Neelu na.

2057
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,797
Tell Prem to talk to Amrish.

2058
02:06:38,825 --> 02:06:40,964
Sunny is quite a famous
journalist, I hear.

2059
02:06:41,728 --> 02:06:42,263
I know.

2060
02:06:42,328 --> 02:06:44,103
Divya will get a chance to travel-

2061
02:06:44,164 --> 02:06:46,735
Don't you all have
anything better to do?

2062
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:47,838
Please!

2063
02:06:48,334 --> 02:06:51,975
Leave your kids alone
and get a life.

2064
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,107
Get a job!

2065
02:07:01,648 --> 02:07:02,752
Has she gone mad?

2066
02:07:03,849 --> 02:07:05,123
Who will give us a job?

2067
02:07:10,624 --> 02:07:11,227
Yes...

2068
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:15,836
Yes yes, coming.

2069
02:07:18,064 --> 02:07:18,565
Hey!

2070
02:07:18,898 --> 02:07:22,004
Those hags are plotting
your marriage to Divya.

2071
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:23,906
What?

2072
02:07:24,304 --> 02:07:24,941
Yup...

2073
02:07:25,105 --> 02:07:25,879
You heard me.

2074
02:07:26,939 --> 02:07:28,179
I like what you are wearing, by the way.

2075
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:32,122
So... With Divya?

2076
02:07:33,079 --> 02:07:34,023
Please, Sunny.

2077
02:07:35,081 --> 02:07:36,185
What is their plan?

2078
02:07:36,583 --> 02:07:37,687
It's not a joke.

2079
02:07:38,718 --> 02:07:41,665
Don’t encourage them.
If they ask, just say no.

2080
02:07:41,721 --> 02:07:42,995
Just... No!

2081
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:44,600
Why?

2082
02:07:44,758 --> 02:07:46,328
I don’t even know Divya...

2083
02:07:46,693 --> 02:07:48,673
She could be a very nice girl.

2084
02:07:49,195 --> 02:07:50,572
She is my cousin!

2085
02:07:50,797 --> 02:07:51,571
So?

2086
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:53,901
Why do you care?
You’re already married.

2087
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:58,209
I wouldn't be, if we were together.

2088
02:08:05,745 --> 02:08:07,850
We would be, if you had waited.

2089
02:08:12,184 --> 02:08:15,529
But you jumped on the
first guy that came by.

2090
02:08:16,055 --> 02:08:16,931
It was very nice of you.

2091
02:08:19,959 --> 02:08:20,699
L-low dare you'?

2092
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,665
What are you doing?

2093
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:24,940
I jumped on the first guy?
ljumpedl!

2094
02:08:25,064 --> 02:08:26,042
You really want to talk
about this right now?

2095
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:27,840
Yes I think it's high time, don't you?

2096
02:08:29,769 --> 02:08:31,112
You didn’t want to tell your parents.

2097
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:32,945
They would've never accepted it

2098
02:08:33,006 --> 02:08:34,041
and you know that.

2099
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:35,845
So what was your plan...

2100
02:08:36,009 --> 02:08:36,749
That we run away?

2101
02:08:36,809 --> 02:08:37,810
What else could we have done?

2102
02:08:37,877 --> 02:08:38,685
Are you crazy?

2103
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:41,058
L-low would my father
have faced your parents'?

2104
02:08:41,114 --> 02:08:43,321
And what would they think of me?

2105
02:08:44,017 --> 02:08:44,995
They knew about us.

2106
02:08:45,051 --> 02:08:45,756
Please.

2107
02:08:46,018 --> 02:08:47,019
What do you think, Sunny?

2108
02:08:47,687 --> 02:08:49,667
Why did Papa send you to America?

2109
02:08:50,623 --> 02:08:53,661
Not to study but to keep you away from me!

2110
02:08:54,794 --> 02:08:56,796
Did he tell you that?
- Obviously not.

2111
02:08:56,863 --> 02:08:58,900
Then how do you know'?
- Because I know my father!

2112
02:08:58,965 --> 02:08:59,807
Ayesha!

2113
02:08:59,866 --> 02:09:00,776
Then please tell me...

2114
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:03,579
l-low did he convince you to marry Manav'?

2115
02:09:05,004 --> 02:09:06,950
He didn’t need to...

2116
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,813
Because you did it.

2117
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:12,987
You know, Ayesha that
is really convenient.

2118
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:15,215
Everyone is at fault, except you.

2119
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:17,686
Do you remember...

2120
02:09:18,551 --> 02:09:19,928
l-low many times I called you'?

2121
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:21,764
I kept telling you

2122
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:23,596
my parents are pressurizing me...

2123
02:09:23,656 --> 02:09:24,964
Please come back, please come back...

2124
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:26,202
Why didn't you come back, Sunny?

2125
02:09:26,525 --> 02:09:29,870
Ayesha!
I am your fatheﬁs manager's son!

2126
02:09:31,531 --> 02:09:32,976
I wanted to be somebody.

2127
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:35,907
Somebody your parents would accept.

2128
02:09:35,968 --> 02:09:37,038
Don't you get it?

2129
02:09:41,541 --> 02:09:43,282
And why are we talking about this now?

2130
02:09:44,977 --> 02:09:46,115
Ivlanav is great.

2131
02:09:46,579 --> 02:09:47,614
You are happy.

2132
02:09:48,714 --> 02:09:50,125
What is the point of this-

2133
02:10:13,006 --> 02:10:16,579
This is the best place for seafood...

2134
02:10:17,577 --> 02:10:18,282
You like fishes?

2135
02:10:19,245 --> 02:10:20,155
You will love them.

2136
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:23,225
No fishes for you!

2137
02:10:23,282 --> 02:10:24,955
You're coming with me to King's Bar.

2138
02:10:26,185 --> 02:10:27,823
I want you to meet Farah.

2139
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:30,894
Farah?

2140
02:10:32,058 --> 02:10:33,059
Don't be late.

2141
02:10:33,726 --> 02:10:34,727
I am serious.

2142
02:10:36,796 --> 02:10:37,774
You alright?

2143
02:10:37,930 --> 02:10:38,806
Yeah.

2144
02:10:38,865 --> 02:10:39,843
I'll see you there.

2145
02:10:41,201 --> 02:10:42,703
I am coming to King's Bar.

2146
02:10:43,303 --> 02:10:43,974
Divya, please.

2147
02:10:44,303 --> 02:10:46,112
Champagne or me.

2148
02:10:46,172 --> 02:10:47,082
Please choose one.

2149
02:10:47,273 --> 02:10:47,910
Shut up!

2150
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:49,652
Don't be mean, Rana.

2151
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:53,823
What was that?

2152
02:10:56,816 --> 02:10:58,022
It was nothing.

2153
02:10:59,652 --> 02:11:01,063
Don’t mess with me, Ayesha...

2154
02:11:01,888 --> 02:11:02,889
You have no idea how difficult it was

2155
02:11:02,956 --> 02:11:04,026
for me to see you again.

2156
02:11:04,257 --> 02:11:05,668
So why did you come?

2157
02:11:05,825 --> 02:11:06,963
What choice did I have?

2158
02:11:08,128 --> 02:11:10,802
Papa was behaving like
it's his last holiday.

2159
02:11:12,165 --> 02:11:12,905
Papa?

2160
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:14,541
Ya...

2161
02:11:16,102 --> 02:11:17,547
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

2162
02:11:18,204 --> 02:11:19,148
I am sorry.

2163
02:11:19,772 --> 02:11:20,546
SO, is that it?

2164
02:11:20,606 --> 02:11:21,641
Yes, that's it.

2165
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:24,984
Go... Live your bachelor
life with your girlfriends.

2166
02:11:25,044 --> 02:11:25,988
Do your thing.

2167
02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:28,715
ls that what you think?

2168
02:11:28,781 --> 02:11:31,091
That's what I hear, so that's what I think.

2169
02:11:32,952 --> 02:11:35,193
L-low can someone so smart be so stupid'?

2170
02:11:56,709 --> 02:11:57,653
Sure you don't want anything?

2171
02:11:58,144 --> 02:11:58,918
Some poison?

2172
02:11:59,312 --> 02:12:00,086
A slap?

2173
02:12:00,179 --> 02:12:01,283
Here you all are!

2174
02:12:01,681 --> 02:12:02,682
Hi!

2175
02:12:03,516 --> 02:12:04,756
Come on, dinner is served.

2176
02:12:04,817 --> 02:12:05,591
Let's go.

2177
02:12:05,752 --> 02:12:09,063
We are not hungry,
in fact we are all working up an appetite.

2178
02:12:09,255 --> 02:12:10,165
Very good.

2179
02:12:10,222 --> 02:12:11,565
Really?

2180
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:13,528
Kabir. ..

2181
02:12:13,826 --> 02:12:15,032
You sneaky boy!

2182
02:12:15,628 --> 02:12:16,698
When is the big day?

2183
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:19,072
Sorry... What big day?

2184
02:12:19,899 --> 02:12:21,776
Nice acting, Ayesha!

2185
02:12:22,001 --> 02:12:23,002
We know all about it...

2186
02:12:23,069 --> 02:12:24,707
He is getting married!

2187
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:26,515
You're getting married'?'?

2188
02:12:27,106 --> 02:12:27,982
To whom?

2189
02:12:28,274 --> 02:12:28,911
To her!

2190
02:12:31,077 --> 02:12:31,919
Kabir. ..

2191
02:12:31,977 --> 02:12:33,752
Nothing like that, Saira Aunty...

2192
02:12:34,146 --> 02:12:35,022
Who told you?

2193
02:12:35,281 --> 02:12:36,760
Your lndu Aunty!

2194
02:12:36,816 --> 02:12:39,660
No engagement, they're
directly planning the wedding.

2195
02:12:39,752 --> 02:12:40,059
What?

2196
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:41,293
Come on, let's celebrate!

2197
02:12:41,554 --> 02:12:42,624
I think it's very good they're not

2198
02:12:42,688 --> 02:12:43,860
bothering with an engagement.

2199
02:12:44,223 --> 02:12:45,167
It's a waste of time.

2200
02:12:46,092 --> 02:12:49,164
Don't do it guys, it's a trap!

2201
02:12:55,268 --> 02:12:56,008
Farah!

2202
02:12:57,603 --> 02:12:58,013
Farah...

2203
02:12:58,271 --> 02:12:59,306
Please just stop.

2204
02:12:59,705 --> 02:13:00,183
Please!

2205
02:13:03,142 --> 02:13:04,086
Are you okay'?

2206
02:13:04,110 --> 02:13:06,090
No.
I am not okay.

2207
02:13:06,879 --> 02:13:07,619
What was that?

2208
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:10,221
Look I am really sorry... I have no idea.

2209
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:13,029
You people don't talk to each other or what?

2210
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,664
You're getting married?

2211
02:13:15,721 --> 02:13:16,597
No babe...

2212
02:13:16,956 --> 02:13:17,866
it's a long story.

2213
02:13:17,957 --> 02:13:20,631
I am not deaf, Kabir.
I heard what your Aunties said.

2214
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,137
Please hear me out too?

2215
02:13:23,195 --> 02:13:25,072
It's true that Noorie &
I are getting engaged...

2216
02:13:25,131 --> 02:13:26,109
but there is a reason for that-

2217
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:27,200
Farah, please wait!

2218
02:13:28,101 --> 02:13:29,273
I am not getting married!

2219
02:13:29,335 --> 02:13:30,837
Go tell Noorie that you asshole!

2220
02:13:30,903 --> 02:13:31,847
Farah, please just listen-

2221
02:13:31,904 --> 02:13:32,678
To what?!

2222
02:13:33,939 --> 02:13:35,885
We met, I liked you, we had a fun time.

2223
02:13:36,209 --> 02:13:37,017
I was fine.

2224
02:13:37,743 --> 02:13:39,689
Then this I love you,
I want to be with you...

2225
02:13:39,745 --> 02:13:42,157
What was the need to lie?

2226
02:13:43,315 --> 02:13:45,352
You made an arse of me, Kabir.

2227
02:13:52,224 --> 02:13:53,168
Whafs going on?

2228
02:13:53,793 --> 02:13:54,635
Nothing...

2229
02:13:54,694 --> 02:13:57,334
Noorie meets Rana, not me.
They are together.

2230
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,672
I was trying to help them out.

2231
02:13:59,732 --> 02:14:00,210
The next thing I Know,

2232
02:14:00,265 --> 02:14:02,905
Papa was bribing me with
the plane to marry her.

2233
02:14:03,136 --> 02:14:04,547
And you said yes?

2234
02:14:04,737 --> 02:14:05,681
Are you stupid?

2235
02:14:05,772 --> 02:14:06,910
What about them?

2236
02:14:07,573 --> 02:14:08,847
These are our parents?

2237
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:11,711
Am I an asset?

2238
02:14:12,145 --> 02:14:13,556
I thought I'd teach them a lesson.

2239
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:15,057
If they can use me for the company,

2240
02:14:15,114 --> 02:14:17,025
I can use them for my plane.

2241
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:19,120
So what's the difference
between you and them?

2242
02:14:19,185 --> 02:14:19,788
Ayesha, please!

2243
02:14:19,852 --> 02:14:20,956
Cut out the moral science.

2244
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,624
You vvoulcfve done the same thing.

2245
02:14:22,688 --> 02:14:24,099
No! I wouldn't.

2246
02:14:25,057 --> 02:14:27,037
If I don’t agree with them, I tell them.

2247
02:14:27,093 --> 02:14:27,833
Oh really?

2248
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:29,766
Did you tell them about the card?

2249
02:14:29,962 --> 02:14:30,872
Kabir!

2250
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:32,837
That was not important.

2251
02:14:33,099 --> 02:14:35,170
Can you please just grow up?

2252
02:14:36,102 --> 02:14:37,080
What are you doing?

2253
02:14:38,003 --> 02:14:39,846
What do you want to do?

2254
02:14:40,873 --> 02:14:41,613
Think.

2255
02:14:50,282 --> 02:14:52,023
We are not getting married!

2256
02:14:52,318 --> 02:14:53,763
There's been some confusion.

2257
02:14:54,053 --> 02:14:54,963
Don’t you trust me?

2258
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,090
I don't know, you are a Sood.

2259
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:57,199
What is that supposed to mean?!

2260
02:14:57,256 --> 02:14:57,996
You know what I mean!

2261
02:14:58,291 --> 02:14:59,964
You know the problem between our families.

2262
02:15:00,192 --> 02:15:01,728
What problem?

2263
02:15:01,861 --> 02:15:03,807
Your aunt was engaged to my uncle

2264
02:15:03,863 --> 02:15:05,672
and one day before the wedding she eloped.

2265
02:15:05,798 --> 02:15:07,641
That's because your sleazy uncle

2266
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:09,543
was having an affair with his secretary.

2267
02:15:09,602 --> 02:15:10,910
Watch your tongue, she's my aunt now.

2268
02:15:11,837 --> 02:15:13,111
And she didn’t buy my uncle,

2269
02:15:13,172 --> 02:15:15,049
like your dad is buying Kamal Uncle for you.

2270
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:28,230
Please classify my account...

2271
02:15:28,754 --> 02:15:29,061
Q Kay-

2272
02:15:41,267 --> 02:15:41,768
What?

2273
02:15:41,934 --> 02:15:42,275
Shhh!

2274
02:15:53,612 --> 02:15:54,022
Shit!

2275
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:58,194
This is too much.

2276
02:15:58,250 --> 02:15:59,251
Where were you?

2277
02:16:00,052 --> 02:16:01,030
I got a call from Delhi.

2278
02:16:01,087 --> 02:16:02,088
Sit Kamal.

2279
02:16:02,288 --> 02:16:03,062
lndu...

2280
02:16:03,722 --> 02:16:04,257
<i>Have you seen Pram?</i>

2281
02:16:04,690 --> 02:16:06,067
I don't see him after 1O pm.

2282
02:16:06,692 --> 02:16:08,797
Don't tell me. He sleeps that early?

2283
02:16:08,861 --> 02:16:09,532
Yes...

2284
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:11,674
And I'm the queen of the night.

2285
02:16:12,165 --> 02:16:14,076
Tell Neelu I went back to the ship.

2286
02:16:14,567 --> 02:16:15,068
Kama! <i>Jr'...</i>

2287
02:16:15,601 --> 02:16:16,705
Please take Putlu with you.

2288
02:16:17,637 --> 02:16:17,944
Come.

2289
02:16:19,005 --> 02:16:19,779
Why?

2290
02:16:19,906 --> 02:16:20,816
It's getting late.

2291
02:16:22,308 --> 02:16:23,286
Good night, everybody.

2292
02:16:23,976 --> 02:16:24,784
Good night, bye!

2293
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:26,152
Kabir!

2294
02:16:30,816 --> 02:16:32,796
Kamal Uncle saw Rana & me together...

2295
02:16:34,286 --> 02:16:35,230
So?

2296
02:16:38,057 --> 02:16:39,968
What were you both doing?

2297
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:48,204
I'll handle it.

2298
02:16:51,704 --> 02:16:52,580
And Noorie...

2299
02:16:53,305 --> 02:16:55,649
There are 500 rooms on the ship.

2300
02:17:10,823 --> 02:17:11,528
What happened?

2301
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:13,229
Don’t ask...

2302
02:17:15,594 --> 02:17:16,163
Are you okay'?

2303
02:17:17,129 --> 02:17:18,039
Get me some water.

2304
02:17:18,631 --> 02:17:19,075
Ya, sure.

2305
02:17:22,701 --> 02:17:23,679
Can I get some water?

2306
02:17:23,836 --> 02:17:24,211
Sure.

2307
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:31,221
Kamal Uncle!

2308
02:17:33,746 --> 02:17:34,019
Sir!

2309
02:17:34,914 --> 02:17:35,892
Sir, are you okay?

2310
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:40,861
Call the ship...

2311
02:17:41,186 --> 02:17:42,597
Tell them to open the medical centre.

2312
02:17:43,188 --> 02:17:44,599
He may be having a heart attack!

2313
02:17:44,657 --> 02:17:45,192
Hurry UP!

2314
02:17:47,893 --> 02:17:48,803
Don't complain...

2315
02:17:49,194 --> 02:17:50,673
You are the luckiest out of the lot!

2316
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:52,236
I totally agree!

2317
02:17:55,768 --> 02:17:56,576
Hello...

2318
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,080
Hello?

2319
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:01,046
Yes?

2320
02:18:14,086 --> 02:18:14,757
L-low is he'?

2321
02:18:16,022 --> 02:18:16,796
We don’t know...

2322
02:18:18,157 --> 02:18:19,602
Kabir, it's all my fault...

2323
02:18:19,658 --> 02:18:20,966
He was already so stressed and I...

2324
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:22,027
It wasn't you...

2325
02:18:29,235 --> 02:18:30,270
What happened?

2326
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:34,113
The doctor is with him...

2327
02:18:37,777 --> 02:18:40,257
He's been on anti-anxiety
pills for a few months.

2328
02:18:43,716 --> 02:18:44,786
I didn’t even know.

2329
02:18:47,586 --> 02:18:48,155
Come here.

2330
02:19:24,957 --> 02:19:26,698
There is nothing to worry about.

2331
02:19:27,259 --> 02:19:29,261
It's a severe case of gas.

2332
02:19:30,663 --> 02:19:32,700
We've given him something for the heartburn.

2333
02:19:32,765 --> 02:19:34,176
He'll be fine in a few minutes.

2334
02:19:35,267 --> 02:19:36,245
Excuse me.

2335
02:19:55,587 --> 02:19:58,261
You have no idea what I've been through.

2336
02:20:04,562 --> 02:20:06,166
What you've been through?

2337
02:20:09,501 --> 02:20:10,172
You!

2338
02:20:10,903 --> 02:20:12,177
What are you doing?
Stop it!

2339
02:20:12,571 --> 02:20:13,549
You?!

2340
02:20:13,672 --> 02:20:14,650
Stop it!

2341
02:20:16,541 --> 02:20:18,043
Have you ever thought about me?

2342
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:20,817
Should I keep living with the fear

2343
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:22,517
that you will leave me.

2344
02:20:30,689 --> 02:20:31,895
Yes, one minute.

2345
02:20:38,163 --> 02:20:38,732
Come in.

2346
02:20:43,135 --> 02:20:44,136
You okay?

2347
02:20:44,670 --> 02:20:45,774
Ya, top of the world!

2348
02:20:45,838 --> 02:20:46,578
Mom...

2349
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:49,180
You scared us, Papa.

2350
02:20:50,609 --> 02:20:51,883
I'm glad you are fine.

2351
02:20:57,549 --> 02:20:58,152
Listen...

2352
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:03,123
Please forget this Noorie...

2353
02:21:04,089 --> 02:21:04,863
What?

2354
02:21:05,757 --> 02:21:06,633
Why?

2355
02:21:06,725 --> 02:21:08,966
She is not serious about Kabir, trust me.

2356
02:21:09,028 --> 02:21:10,029
Meaning?

2357
02:21:10,562 --> 02:21:12,872
We've given our word to the Soods.

2358
02:21:14,566 --> 02:21:15,271
Sorry...

2359
02:21:16,735 --> 02:21:18,180
Sorry for everything.

2360
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:22,084
Don’t be sorry, Papa.

2361
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:27,956
Actually I never planned to marry Noorie...

2362
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:34,587
I know about her & Rana...

2363
02:21:36,855 --> 02:21:38,232
Noorie, with Rana?

2364
02:21:39,658 --> 02:21:40,659
She likes him.

2365
02:21:40,725 --> 02:21:42,568
They are together...

2366
02:21:43,529 --> 02:21:45,531
I was just helping them out.

2367
02:21:47,599 --> 02:21:48,600
So, I'm sorry.

2368
02:21:49,768 --> 02:21:50,610
You are sorry?

2369
02:21:51,836 --> 02:21:52,906
That's it, you are sorry?

2370
02:21:53,038 --> 02:21:54,210
What is the meaning of sorry now?

2371
02:21:54,773 --> 02:21:55,877
This isn't a joke.

2372
02:21:55,974 --> 02:21:57,920
This is a very serious matter.

2373
02:21:58,276 --> 02:22:00,313
Yes, of course it's serious...

2374
02:22:00,745 --> 02:22:02,725
For you it’s a business deal, right?

2375
02:22:02,781 --> 02:22:04,055
It's not just our business,

2376
02:22:04,616 --> 02:22:05,594
ifs yours too.

2377
02:22:06,918 --> 02:22:07,988
It isn't mine...

2378
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:11,191
And I don't want it.

2379
02:22:11,489 --> 02:22:13,025
What do you mean you don't want it?

2380
02:22:20,966 --> 02:22:23,503
Now that he is fine and we are talking,

2381
02:22:23,568 --> 02:22:24,911
let's talk openly...

2382
02:22:29,207 --> 02:22:31,517
I don’t want to be the CEO of Ayka.

2383
02:22:34,145 --> 02:22:35,249
I am not good enough.

2384
02:22:36,949 --> 02:22:38,087
I know that.

2385
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:39,655
You will learn.

2386
02:22:39,718 --> 02:22:40,628
I won’t be able to.

2387
02:22:41,786 --> 02:22:43,697
I don’t have what it takes.

2388
02:22:43,955 --> 02:22:45,161
Then what will you do?

2389
02:22:45,657 --> 02:22:46,727
I like flying...

2390
02:22:47,959 --> 02:22:49,836
I want to do something in that field.

2391
02:22:50,295 --> 02:22:51,672
And our business?

2392
02:22:52,564 --> 02:22:53,668
Should we sell Ayka to someone else?

2393
02:22:53,932 --> 02:22:54,273
No...

2394
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:59,070
Give it to that Ivlehra who
has his business acumen.

2395
02:22:59,771 --> 02:23:01,580
Who deserves it, who is worthy of it.

2396
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:02,983
It's called Ayka, right'?

2397
02:23:03,141 --> 02:23:04,085
Ayesha-Kabi r.

2398
02:23:05,243 --> 02:23:07,018
So if you want to save your company

2399
02:23:07,078 --> 02:23:08,318
let your son go

2400
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:09,957
and bring your daughter back home.

2401
02:23:10,148 --> 02:23:11,126
What rubbish!

2402
02:23:12,684 --> 02:23:13,719
She is in her home.

2403
02:23:13,818 --> 02:23:14,922
She is miserable.

2404
02:23:14,987 --> 02:23:16,057
Can't you guys see that?

2405
02:23:16,121 --> 02:23:17,794
Don't you care?

2406
02:23:17,856 --> 02:23:18,766
Of course we care!

2407
02:23:19,157 --> 02:23:21,137
But do you know what
divorce means in our society?

2408
02:23:21,193 --> 02:23:22,263
It's not easy.

2409
02:23:23,328 --> 02:23:25,706
So if I am about to do something difficult,

2410
02:23:26,932 --> 02:23:29,276
you should be even more supportive, right?

2411
02:23:30,168 --> 02:23:31,238
What are you talking, Ayesha?

2412
02:23:32,804 --> 02:23:33,748
If you do all this,

2413
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:35,946
people will talk. You know that.

2414
02:23:36,641 --> 02:23:38,120
They are doing that anyway, aren't they?

2415
02:23:38,643 --> 02:23:39,781
Whether something happens or not,

2416
02:23:40,579 --> 02:23:41,683
that is what people do-

2417
02:23:41,746 --> 02:23:42,816
What are these two saying?

2418
02:23:43,815 --> 02:23:45,192
I just don't understand this girl.

2419
02:23:45,684 --> 02:23:46,856
The problem, Neelam...

2420
02:23:47,019 --> 02:23:48,293
is that the morality & values we had,

2421
02:23:48,353 --> 02:23:49,855
don't exist any more.

2422
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:51,692
Marriage has become a joke.

2423
02:23:52,257 --> 02:23:53,258
Get married today,

2424
02:23:53,325 --> 02:23:54,599
divorced tomorrow!

2425
02:23:56,161 --> 02:23:56,935
Really?

2426
02:23:59,097 --> 02:24:01,304
Since when have you been married?

2427
02:24:04,169 --> 02:24:08,049
And what is your morality
and what are your values?

2428
02:24:08,106 --> 02:24:08,880
Please tell us.

2429
02:24:09,141 --> 02:24:09,778
Stop it, Kabir!

2430
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:10,751
Oh, its true.

2431
02:24:12,644 --> 02:24:14,954
Everyone knows about his business trips.

2432
02:24:18,049 --> 02:24:20,086
Where he goes, who he
goes with, what he does

2433
02:24:20,151 --> 02:24:22,131
and how you pretend nothing has happened.

2434
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:23,321
Whereas the truth is

2435
02:24:23,588 --> 02:24:25,625
you have nowhere else to go...

2436
02:24:36,935 --> 02:24:38,039
l-low dare you'?

2437
02:24:39,071 --> 02:24:40,072
It's the truth.

2438
02:24:44,809 --> 02:24:45,617
Please leave.

2439
02:24:45,978 --> 02:24:46,649
No.

2440
02:24:46,978 --> 02:24:48,685
Just get out of here.

2441
02:24:48,747 --> 02:24:50,249
I am not going anywhere.

2442
02:24:50,315 --> 02:24:51,988
Is this how you speak to your father'?

2443
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:53,324
I am talking to you too.

2444
02:24:53,585 --> 02:24:54,859
Don't talk to me, Kabir.

2445
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,762
Shut up!

2446
02:24:55,821 --> 02:24:57,323
No!
- I don't want to see your face!

2447
02:24:57,589 --> 02:24:58,795
I am not going any where.

2448
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:02,694
Everyone in this family talks in circles.

2449
02:25:02,761 --> 02:25:04,638
Nothing real is ever said.

2450
02:25:04,696 --> 02:25:05,766
What do you want to say?

2451
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:11,706
What more is left to say?

2452
02:25:14,973 --> 02:25:16,179
I'm in love with Farah.

2453
02:25:16,241 --> 02:25:18,983
She’s a dancer and she's a Muslim.

2454
02:25:51,843 --> 02:25:52,913
I need to talk to you.

2455
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:56,987
Farah please... I need to talk to you.

2456
02:25:57,048 --> 02:25:57,788
Not here.

2457
02:25:57,815 --> 02:25:58,816
Then where?

2458
02:25:58,984 --> 02:25:59,724
Back off man.

2459
02:25:59,785 --> 02:26:01,025
Don't mess with me right now!

2460
02:26:04,956 --> 02:26:05,764
Listen, I am sorry.

2461
02:26:05,824 --> 02:26:06,734
I screwed up, okay?

2462
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:10,228
I was never going to marry Noorie,

2463
02:26:10,295 --> 02:26:12,241
I was just playing a
stupid game with my Dad.

2464
02:26:12,764 --> 02:26:13,868
Please, I am sorry.

2465
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:17,279
I love you.

2466
02:26:24,843 --> 02:26:27,016
These games are best played with your dad.

2467
02:26:27,278 --> 02:26:28,621
This is my place of work...

2468
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:29,681
Get out!

2469
02:26:51,202 --> 02:26:52,772
They hate us...

2470
02:26:56,641 --> 02:26:59,588
No... I don't think they hate us.

2471
02:26:59,644 --> 02:27:00,679
Why didn’t you leave me?

2472
02:27:10,588 --> 02:27:11,896
You heard Kabir...

2473
02:27:15,093 --> 02:27:17,164
I had nowhere to go.

2474
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:27,841
Will you be able to forgive me?

2475
02:27:38,216 --> 02:27:40,127
You forgot me, Kamal.

2476
02:27:49,894 --> 02:27:50,872
I'm sorry.

2477
02:27:52,230 --> 02:27:54,232
I'm really sorry.
I never forgot you, Neelu

2478
02:27:56,068 --> 02:27:56,978
Never.

2479
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,847
<i>Why do human beings forget to tell</i>

2480
02:28:04,910 --> 02:28:07,618
<i>each other things
when they are together?</i>

2481
02:28:10,682 --> 02:28:12,059
<i>And why is it</i>

2482
02:28:12,817 --> 02:28:15,593
<i>that they always
remember the unsaid things</i>

2483
02:28:16,555 --> 02:28:20,697
when someone is gone?

2484
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,970
<i>Why does the right
thing only come to them</i>

2485
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,539
<i>when its too fate?</i>

2486
02:28:33,605 --> 02:28:34,913
Everyone is gossiping...

2487
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:38,143
This girl doesn’t care about herself

2488
02:28:38,677 --> 02:28:40,588
or her fami
y’s reputation.

2489
02:28:41,613 --> 02:28:43,957
Why have I lived to see this day?

2490
02:28:44,949 --> 02:28:46,895
All these years we invested in her...

2491
02:28:47,686 --> 02:28:49,188
Invested in me means?

2492
02:28:50,188 --> 02:28:51,792
Did I say something wrong?

2493
02:28:52,324 --> 02:28:53,667
Did I upset you?

2494
02:28:54,692 --> 02:28:55,830
Are you angry?

2495
02:28:56,261 --> 02:28:56,864
Tell me?

2496
02:28:57,595 --> 02:28:58,073
Tell me...

2497
02:28:58,930 --> 02:29:01,774
I'm not allowed to
speak in my own house.

2498
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:03,272
So you only say something...

2499
02:29:04,135 --> 02:29:05,273
Why are you quiet'?

2500
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,910
Okay, fine.

2501
02:29:07,205 --> 02:29:09,116
If I upset you, then please...

2502
02:29:09,707 --> 02:29:10,685
Please forgive me.

2503
02:29:11,843 --> 02:29:14,016
If this is not good
enough, then I will-

2504
02:29:14,746 --> 02:29:16,191
I will kill myself!

2505
02:29:17,015 --> 02:29:18,119
Will that make you happy?

2506
02:29:18,182 --> 02:29:18,887
Mom, please-

2507
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:20,686
Ivlanav...

2508
02:29:22,086 --> 02:29:23,190
This is what she wants!

2509
02:29:23,855 --> 02:29:24,526
Smita ji...

2510
02:29:26,091 --> 02:29:26,728
Aunty...

2511
02:29:28,593 --> 02:29:30,004
That's a butter knife.

2512
02:29:30,695 --> 02:29:31,264
What?

2513
02:29:32,163 --> 02:29:33,642
That is a butter knife.

2514
02:29:34,532 --> 02:29:35,272
Kabir!

2515
02:29:35,834 --> 02:29:36,608
Take this.

2516
02:29:36,968 --> 02:29:38,003
This will be better.

2517
02:29:39,537 --> 02:29:40,208
Hold it like this...

2518
02:29:41,205 --> 02:29:41,979
And cut like this.

2519
02:29:43,041 --> 02:29:43,712
Lengthwise.

2520
02:29:44,742 --> 02:29:47,188
L-low dare you speak to
my mother like that'?

2521
02:29:48,012 --> 02:29:49,218
I am just helping her-

2522
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:49,815
Kabir!

2523
02:29:51,049 --> 02:29:51,754
Apologize.

2524
02:29:53,718 --> 02:29:54,594
Now.

2525
02:29:55,253 --> 02:29:55,924
Sorry...

2526
02:29:58,322 --> 02:29:59,699
This is ridiculous!

2527
02:30:01,126 --> 02:30:02,070
This is my marriage.

2528
02:30:02,994 --> 02:30:04,803
And this is my fami
y’s
personal matter.

2529
02:30:06,598 --> 02:30:07,235
I have had enough.

2530
02:30:07,765 --> 02:30:08,004
Mom.

2531
02:30:08,767 --> 02:30:09,711
We should go back.

2532
02:30:10,569 --> 02:30:10,876
Come on.

2533
02:30:11,269 --> 02:30:12,714
Ayesha, pack up your bags... Let's go.

2534
02:30:12,904 --> 02:30:15,214
Manav, I can't leave.
it's my parents' anniversary.

2535
02:30:17,742 --> 02:30:18,117
Ayesha. ..

2536
02:30:19,143 --> 02:30:22,249
Don’t make me force you, alright?

2537
02:30:22,914 --> 02:30:23,187
Let's go.

2538
02:30:23,881 --> 02:30:24,222
Oy!

2539
02:30:26,084 --> 02:30:27,154
Easy, tiger-

2540
02:30:27,218 --> 02:30:27,821
Shut up!

2541
02:30:29,153 --> 02:30:31,258
This is between me and my wife.

2542
02:30:33,558 --> 02:30:33,933
Get up!

2543
02:30:34,893 --> 02:30:35,997
Ivlanav you are making a scene.

2544
02:30:36,161 --> 02:30:37,037
Get up!

2545
02:30:37,762 --> 02:30:38,968
Ivlanav. .. Stop it!

2546
02:30:39,598 --> 02:30:40,269
Get up!

2547
02:30:43,735 --> 02:30:44,179
Papa!

2548
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:52,078
What do you think you’re doing?

2549
02:30:56,948 --> 02:30:59,622
If you even raise a
finger at my daughter...

2550
02:31:00,685 --> 02:31:03,029
I'll rip your arm out
and throw it into the sea.

2551
02:31:03,088 --> 02:31:04,658
Do you understand?

2552
02:31:22,807 --> 02:31:25,185
Please take your son and
leave as soon as possible.

2553
02:31:27,912 --> 02:31:29,619
Please go.

2554
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:33,193
You are making a mistake, Kamal ji.

2555
02:31:34,552 --> 02:31:36,725
I made a mistake many years ago.

2556
02:31:57,542 --> 02:31:58,020
Papa!

2557
02:32:00,044 --> 02:32:00,579
Papa...

2558
02:32:05,616 --> 02:32:05,889
I am sorry.

2559
02:32:07,986 --> 02:32:08,862
I am really sorry.

2560
02:32:49,294 --> 02:32:50,671
Isn't this Farah's room?

2561
02:32:51,529 --> 02:32:52,633
She left.

2562
02:32:53,798 --> 02:32:54,868
She got fired.

2563
02:32:56,201 --> 02:32:57,578
She got off an hour ago.

2564
02:33:27,098 --> 02:33:27,940
I need to get off.

2565
02:33:28,299 --> 02:33:29,744
Sir, the ship is
sailing... lam sorry!

2566
02:33:32,137 --> 02:33:32,774
Hello, ma'm!

2567
02:33:33,070 --> 02:33:33,844
I need to get off the ship.

2568
02:33:33,971 --> 02:33:35,143
I am sorry, sir.
You can't get off.

2569
02:33:35,206 --> 02:33:36,184
I don't need to come back.

2570
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,150
I just need to get off the ship.

2571
02:33:37,242 --> 02:33:39,017
Ya, but the ship just pulled out-

2572
02:33:39,076 --> 02:33:40,282
No, no, m'am, you don't understand.

2573
02:33:40,344 --> 02:33:41,914
It's an emergency, I
need to get off the ship.

2574
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:42,890
Please stop the ship & let me off.

2575
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:44,254
It is a security issue...

2576
02:33:45,015 --> 02:33:45,993
I'll give you a security issue,

2577
02:33:46,017 --> 02:33:46,927
just let me off the ship!

2578
02:33:47,318 --> 02:33:48,160
What's the problem, Sir?

2579
02:33:48,252 --> 02:33:48,992
It's an emergency...

2580
02:33:49,087 --> 02:33:50,623
It's imperative I get
off the ship right now.

2581
02:33:50,688 --> 02:33:51,257
Please stop the ship.

2582
02:33:52,023 --> 02:33:53,366
Stop the ship!
- Sir, calm down.

2583
02:33:53,658 --> 02:33:54,693
You don't tell me to calm down!

2584
02:33:55,193 --> 02:33:56,604
Tell him!

2585
02:33:58,963 --> 02:33:59,737
What are you doing?

2586
02:33:59,864 --> 02:34:01,810
Farah has left and they are
not letting me off the ship.

2587
02:34:02,066 --> 02:34:03,204
So get off at the next port...

2588
02:34:03,268 --> 02:34:04,804
The next port is in Greece.

2589
02:34:04,869 --> 02:34:05,870
L-low will I find her, Sunny'?

2590
02:34:06,837 --> 02:34:07,781
What do you mean loco?

2591
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:09,878
Listen, calm down.

2592
02:34:11,275 --> 02:34:12,686
If there is an emergency on the ship,

2593
02:34:13,077 --> 02:34:14,181
they must be having a procedure.

2594
02:34:15,113 --> 02:34:17,059
They won't stop the
ship without a reason.

2595
02:34:18,049 --> 02:34:19,119
Okay?

2596
02:34:28,626 --> 02:34:29,730
I love you.

2597
02:34:33,064 --> 02:34:34,771
Ayesha is getting a divorce...

2598
02:34:53,851 --> 02:34:54,295
Get ready...

2599
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:56,898
We have to do this right now.

2600
02:35:01,692 --> 02:35:02,261
Excuse me, everybody...

2601
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:03,561
I need your attention, please.

2602
02:35:03,895 --> 02:35:06,034
Quiet everyone!

2603
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:07,700
Kabir wants to make a toasts.

2604
02:35:09,567 --> 02:35:10,068
Thank you, Vinod Uncle.

2605
02:35:11,602 --> 02:35:14,048
Actually I am not
here to make a toast.

2606
02:35:14,906 --> 02:35:16,078
I am here to apologize.

2607
02:35:18,743 --> 02:35:19,016
Noorie...

2608
02:35:22,046 --> 02:35:22,990
You are one hell of a woman.

2609
02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:27,193
I love you
and you will always be my friend.

2610
02:35:28,286 --> 02:35:29,697
But I can’t marry you...

2611
02:35:29,754 --> 02:35:31,062
Because I am in love
with someone else...

2612
02:35:40,198 --> 02:35:41,176
I am sorry, Noorie...

2613
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,707
Noorie!

2614
02:35:47,271 --> 02:35:47,840
Noorie...

2615
02:35:49,173 --> 02:35:50,117
You stay away from her.

2616
02:35:51,642 --> 02:35:52,177
Get her here...

2617
02:35:53,711 --> 02:35:54,189
Give her air!

2618
02:35:54,312 --> 02:35:55,188
Please get some water...

2619
02:36:01,719 --> 02:36:02,595
What the hell...

2620
02:36:02,921 --> 02:36:03,899
ls this?

2621
02:36:07,892 --> 02:36:08,529
Kamal...

2622
02:36:08,927 --> 02:36:09,962
Did you know about this?

2623
02:36:10,795 --> 02:36:12,570
He knows nothing about
this, Lalit uncle.

2624
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:14,140
I am really sorry, I-

2625
02:36:14,265 --> 02:36:15,141
You are sorry now?

2626
02:36:15,799 --> 02:36:16,209
You are sorry?

2627
02:36:16,634 --> 02:36:18,011
Sorry it had to happen this way.

2628
02:36:18,970 --> 02:36:20,540
Happen this way, happen that way...

2629
02:36:20,571 --> 02:36:23,609
Kabir, what you have
done is not correct.

2630
02:36:24,809 --> 02:36:26,914
You did this to a sweet
girl like Noorie...

2631
02:36:28,146 --> 02:36:28,920
It's bad!

2632
02:36:30,714 --> 02:36:32,557
I am sorry, I had no choice.

2633
02:36:35,653 --> 02:36:36,961
I respect Noorie too much.

2634
02:36:37,021 --> 02:36:38,967
I can’t lie to her...

2635
02:36:44,796 --> 02:36:47,800
The girl I am in love
with has lost her job,

2636
02:36:48,566 --> 02:36:49,636
asked to get off the ship...

2637
02:36:50,067 --> 02:36:50,738
Because of me.

2638
02:36:53,137 --> 02:36:54,081
I have to go and find her.

2639
02:36:59,243 --> 02:37:01,587
Papa, can I rely on you?

2640
02:37:03,681 --> 02:37:05,820
Papa, can I rely on you?

2641
02:37:08,085 --> 02:37:08,995
Yes...

2642
02:37:09,087 --> 02:37:10,065
Good.

2643
02:37:11,122 --> 02:37:13,159
Because you are my lifeboat.

2644
02:37:14,091 --> 02:37:14,967
What?

2645
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:16,936
Where are you going?

2646
02:37:24,836 --> 02:37:26,315
Kabir, that's not what I meant!

2647
02:37:30,041 --> 02:37:31,645
Noorie!

2648
02:37:56,166 --> 02:37:57,076
Sunny, where is he?

2649
02:37:57,268 --> 02:37:58,008
I don't know.

2650
02:38:00,137 --> 02:38:01,343
Man overboard! Starboard Side.

2651
02:38:05,175 --> 02:38:05,846
Kamal uncle!

2652
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:07,145
There... There he is!

2653
02:38:08,746 --> 02:38:09,087
Stop the ship.

2654
02:38:10,047 --> 02:38:11,287
Go, stop the ship!

2655
02:38:11,548 --> 02:38:11,753
Q Kay-

2656
02:38:15,819 --> 02:38:16,695
Stop engines.

2657
02:38:17,521 --> 02:38:19,660
Oscar! Oscar!

2658
02:38:20,658 --> 02:38:23,195
Starboard side.

2659
02:38:27,665 --> 02:38:29,042
Someone stop this ship!

2660
02:38:29,300 --> 02:38:30,870
Where is this Oscar?

2661
02:38:31,135 --> 02:38:32,546
My child is drowning!

2662
02:38:32,703 --> 02:38:34,808
Oscar means they are
going to send a lifeboat.

2663
02:38:36,006 --> 02:38:36,950
They will save him, Kamal Uncle.

2664
02:38:37,241 --> 02:38:37,878
Lifeboat...

2665
02:38:38,909 --> 02:38:39,887
He said I am his life boat...

2666
02:38:40,177 --> 02:38:40,678
What?

2667
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,022
I'm his lifeboat.

2668
02:38:43,681 --> 02:38:44,216
I have to go!

2669
02:38:45,015 --> 02:38:45,959
The lifeboat is up there.

2670
02:38:46,684 --> 02:38:47,025
There...

2671
02:38:47,184 --> 02:38:47,855
Get it down...

2672
02:38:48,152 --> 02:38:49,222
Do something please, Kamal!

2673
02:38:50,154 --> 02:38:51,633
Just get the lifeboat downl!

2674
02:38:51,755 --> 02:38:53,257
Don't worry, they're coming!

2675
02:38:53,891 --> 02:38:55,131
They will arrest him!

2676
02:38:57,294 --> 02:38:58,295
Just do as I say!

2677
02:38:58,562 --> 02:38:59,734
L-low do we get this down'?

2678
02:39:00,031 --> 02:39:01,169
How?

2679
02:39:01,232 --> 02:39:03,041
Figure it out!

2680
02:39:03,935 --> 02:39:04,913
Pull the rope!

2681
02:39:06,670 --> 02:39:07,705
Lalit, be careful!

2682
02:39:12,977 --> 02:39:14,047
Nothing's happening!

2683
02:39:14,645 --> 02:39:15,555
Check up there.

2684
02:39:23,621 --> 02:39:24,565
Kamal Uncle!

2685
02:39:26,557 --> 02:39:26,898
There!

2686
02:39:27,157 --> 02:39:28,227
Lifeboat!

2687
02:39:31,996 --> 02:39:32,804
Hey!

2688
02:39:33,297 --> 02:39:34,173
Excuse me!

2689
02:39:42,006 --> 02:39:42,882
Stop!

2690
02:39:44,775 --> 02:39:46,584
Officer, I need this boat!

2691
02:39:46,644 --> 02:39:47,714
Sir, you can't enter!

2692
02:39:47,778 --> 02:39:48,950
It's his life, officer!

2693
02:39:48,979 --> 02:39:49,753
Back up!

2694
02:39:49,847 --> 02:39:51,019
I'll pay you as much as you want.

2695
02:39:51,081 --> 02:39:51,923
Back up now.

2696
02:39:52,016 --> 02:39:52,858
They are not listening!

2697
02:40:05,963 --> 02:40:07,670
Sorry officer, nothing personals.

2698
02:40:08,198 --> 02:40:09,074
Just 5 minutes...

2699
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:10,501
Leave me!

2700
02:40:12,836 --> 02:40:13,837
Where are you going?

2701
02:40:14,138 --> 02:40:15,116
I have to take him to the port, Neelu.

2702
02:40:15,539 --> 02:40:16,847
If they catch him, they'll arrest him.

2703
02:40:17,074 --> 02:40:17,848
I have to go!

2704
02:40:17,941 --> 02:40:19,545
Even I'm coming.
- Not right now!

2705
02:40:19,643 --> 02:40:20,246
Then when?!

2706
02:40:20,978 --> 02:40:21,854
Fine! Come!

2707
02:40:24,515 --> 02:40:25,050
Bhaf Saab!

2708
02:40:25,883 --> 02:40:27,590
Should I also come?
- No, no you stay here...

2709
02:40:27,885 --> 02:40:28,955
Look after the guests, okay?

2710
02:40:29,286 --> 02:40:30,526
I'll handle everything here.

2711
02:40:30,588 --> 02:40:31,589
You don't worry.

2712
02:40:38,095 --> 02:40:39,631
Noorie, where's Mom?

2713
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:43,275
Papa!

2714
02:40:44,168 --> 02:40:45,977
Step back!

2715
02:40:46,603 --> 02:40:47,741
Sorry, I've got to go!

2716
02:40:50,641 --> 02:40:51,551
Pluto, out!

2717
02:40:52,609 --> 02:40:53,952
Ayesha, he won't go!

2718
02:40:54,678 --> 02:40:55,247
Are you okay'?

2719
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:56,849
Yes...

2720
02:40:57,148 --> 02:40:57,751
No...

2721
02:40:57,848 --> 02:40:58,918
I don't know...

2722
02:41:00,718 --> 02:41:01,696
Everybody hang on.

2723
02:41:12,663 --> 02:41:13,141
Sunny!

2724
02:41:15,699 --> 02:41:16,871
Will you wait for me?

2725
02:41:19,536 --> 02:41:20,776
Dammit Sunny, say something...

2726
02:41:20,804 --> 02:41:22,078
Will you wait for me?

2727
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:24,046
Forever!

2728
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:47,703
Papa, do you know how this works'?

2729
02:41:47,765 --> 02:41:49,244
I used to drive a truck...

2730
02:41:49,266 --> 02:41:50,142
l-low hard can this be'?

2731
02:41:50,234 --> 02:41:51,076
Kamal, please!

2732
02:42:11,655 --> 02:42:12,793
There he is, Papa!

2733
02:42:15,593 --> 02:42:16,901
Careful Kamal, don't kill my son!

2734
02:42:21,798 --> 02:42:22,503
Kabir!

2735
02:42:41,685 --> 02:42:42,663
Careful!

2736
02:42:51,762 --> 02:42:52,137
Mom!

2737
02:42:52,696 --> 02:42:54,004
Are you crazy!

2738
02:43:06,076 --> 02:43:08,147
Papa, the guards are coming!

2739
02:43:08,579 --> 02:43:10,024
They're coming! Go, go, go!

2740
02:43:11,182 --> 02:43:12,126
<i>Hurry up, Kama“.!</i>

2741
02:43:13,984 --> 02:43:15,258
Come on! Go!

2742
02:43:18,556 --> 02:43:19,557
Why are you not starting?

2743
02:43:19,623 --> 02:43:20,328
What is the problem?

2744
02:43:20,724 --> 02:43:21,634
Mama, please relax!

2745
02:43:21,859 --> 02:43:22,803
You just shut up!

2746
02:43:26,063 --> 02:43:27,098
We need to go, Papa!

2747
02:43:28,332 --> 02:43:29,310
They're almost here.

2748
02:43:29,934 --> 02:43:30,639
Down boy.

2749
02:43:45,649 --> 02:43:47,686
Are they really going to arrest us?

2750
02:43:47,751 --> 02:43:48,661
Obviously, Neelu.

2751
02:43:49,119 --> 02:43:51,258
But after we drop
this fool to the port.

2752
02:44:11,108 --> 02:44:12,985
<i>H wasrYt just Kabir
who got saved today.</i>

2753
02:44:13,611 --> 02:44:15,147
<i>My who/e family has been rescued.</i>

2754
02:44:16,313 --> 02:44:18,554
<i>I had never seen them this happy</i>

2755
02:44:18,615 --> 02:44:21,789
<i>and headed in the
same direction before.</i>

2756
02:44:27,057 --> 02:44:29,867
<i>They say</i> a <i>leopard
can? change his spots</i>

2757
02:44:31,595 --> 02:44:34,974
<i>but man has the power to change.</i>

2758
02:44:37,034 --> 02:44:38,945
<i>Now look at my own family.</i>

2759
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:43,211
<i>Today they've learnt that
love, alone, is not enough.</i>

2760
02:44:43,807 --> 02:44:47,687
<i>If you love someone, you
have to set them free.</i>

2761
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:53,860
<i>Free to be, free to Hve differently.</i>

2762
02:44:54,785 --> 02:44:56,787
<i>Every heart beats to ifs own rhythm.</i>

2763
02:44:57,121 --> 02:44:59,727
<i>Let every heart beat.</i>

2764
02:45:01,158 --> 02:45:03,104
<i>And it doesrft matter that for miles</i>

2765
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:04,901
<i>there is just water around us.</i>

2766
02:45:05,028 --> 02:45:07,235
<i>Or that our boat is really small.</i>

2767
02:45:08,031 --> 02:45:10,671
We are together.

2768
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:12,878
<i>We are for each other.</i>

2769
02:45:14,638 --> 02:45:15,776
What else does one want?

2770
02:46:08,025 --> 02:46:10,631
<i>To each heart, ifs own rhythm</i>

2771
02:46:10,694 --> 02:46:13,300

If emotions melt away

2775
02:46:23,573 --> 02:46:26,076
<i>Let it be so</i>

2776
02:46:26,610 --> 02:46:28,954
<i>If the imagination runs wild</i>

2777
02:46:29,613 --> 02:46:31,854
