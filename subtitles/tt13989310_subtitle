00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,042
'Human's beings 
have the ability to..'

2
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,668
'...imagine and create 
stories from experiences.'

3
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,129
'With both of these, 
they write their own stories...'

4
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,298
'...and through characters they...

5
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,675
...reveal their innermost secrets.'

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,011
'This story begins in a city.'

7
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,389
'A manic city that never sleeps...'

8
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,850
'Here some are high on success...'

9
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,060
'...while some are 
forced to get high...

10
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,104
...to forget their failures.'

11
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:31,318
'On Saturday nights, 
these ordinary people...

12
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,111
...take off their masks...'

13
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,614
'...and set out to temporarily 
forget their reality.'

14
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,118
'Incidents are common in this 
city of glitz and glamour.'

15
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,877
'And to save these vulnerable 
from any danger...'

16
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,715
'...I, Zaran Khan, 
set out incognito.'

17
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,344
'I uphold the Law by breaking it.'

18
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,137
'Tonight I've set out again.'

19
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,807
'The night's young and...restless.'

20
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,060
'As the saying goes, 
a cop's neither a friend nor a foe.'

21
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,356
'And their informers 
never get along with anyone.'

22
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,692
No ticket, no entry!

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
I am sorry!

24
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,702
'The predator is out on the prowl.'

25
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,203
'But be careful...'

26
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,372
'...or the predator 
could turn into the prey.'

27
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,467
- Bro, where's your ticket? 
- What ticket?

28
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,179
- I've got a mobile phone. 
- Mobile phones aren't enough sir.

29
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,389
You need a ticket to get in.

30
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,974
Kailash. Prashant.

31
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,392
- What ticket, guys? 
- Please, sir.

32
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,852
Please, bro, this way.

33
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,714
What is this?

34
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,091
What do you want, man? 
Coke, Energy,

35
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,551
black or white powder? 
What do you want?

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,596
I want to get access 
to the nightclub.

37
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,097
That will cost you 
6000 thousand rupees.

38
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,891
- Hurry up. Be quick... 
- Just a minute.

39
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,643
Everything here has a price tag.

40
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,770
If you've got money 
you've got power.

41
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,688
If you've got power, 
you've got everything.

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,149
I've got you a customer.

43
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,859
The saying fits perfectly...

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,113
Money is above everything.

45
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,450
Everyone is drawn 
to this kind of a place.

46
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,119
It's a heaven for 
people who don't fit in.

47
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,039
Not everyone is given 
access to this kind of place...

48
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,002
...but for those who manage, 
they get anything they want.

49
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,005
One has to be anonymous 
while entering this place.

50
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,134
Because your true identity 
can cost you in here.

51
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:08,684
Something exciting 
happens here every night.

52
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,022
Incidents can change the course 
of your life in a single night.

53
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,400
The repercussions 
of which can impact many...

54
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,279
No one knows the reasons 
or patterns for this ambiguity.

55
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:49,183
"In the city of incidents..."

56
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:55,772
"...someone's gonna arrive tonight."

57
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:02,654
"Either he'll unravel 
the mystery..."

58
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:09,244
"...or become a mystery himself."

59
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:19,296
"In the dark embrace 
of the night..."

60
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,967
"Don't try to unravel 
these mysteries ."

61
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:29,181
"Let the mystery 
unravel itself later..."

62
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,483
"...leave it alone for tonight."

63
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,777
"Is there a crazy 
lover (moth) here..."

64
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:47,074
"...who will risk death 
playing this game with me?"

65
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,254
"Is there a crazy 
lover (moth) here..."

66
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,425
"...who will risk death 
playing this game with me?"

67
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,513
"Who will lose himself in love..."

68
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:14,810
"and will embrace 
this flame in his arms?"

69
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,690
"My flirtatious heart is 
often smitten by beautiful women..."

70
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:24,278
"...yet I search like 
a vagabond for love."

71
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:28,949
"I'm like the aroma of a perfume..."

72
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,451
"...Once touched I filter 
into every heart ."

73
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,121
"I'm a free spirited vagabond, 
a jack of all trades."

74
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,754
"A jack of all trades."

75
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:23,879
"Many come to me..."

76
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,425
"...to cure their restless hearts."

77
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:33,138
"But at the first light of dawn..."

78
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,601
"...they all vanished 
without a trace.

79
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:42,147
"Many come to me..."

80
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,777
"...to cure their restless hearts."

81
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,365
"But at the first light of dawn..."

82
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,328
"...they all vanished 
without a trace.

83
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,166
"When dusk is upon us, 
I'll show you paradise."

84
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,796
"Even at dawn, 
I won't break your heart."

85
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:10,425
"One night spent in my arms 
is unforgetable for a life time..."

86
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:15,889
"I'm a free spirited vagabond, 
a jack of all trades."

87
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,398
"A jack of all trades."

88
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,378
Hey...

89
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,589
One selfie. Nice dance.

90
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,758
Sure.

91
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,805
- Little closer. 
- Hey...

92
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,432
Sorry. Just for a selfie.

93
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,647
Smile, please.

94
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,940
How dare you?

95
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,107
Hey...

96
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,026
Bro, leave her alone.

97
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,653
Who are you?

98
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,988
Leave me, Sardar!

99
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,158
I will let you go.

100
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,952
Leave me alone, bro.

101
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,662
Bro...

102
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,580
I will give you a such a shock,

103
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,542
You will never forget it.

104
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,475
You cheated us!

105
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,479
It's not my fault, Sir. 
You weren't paying attention.

106
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,701
Sorry, sir!

107
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,786
I was bringing him to you, Sir.

108
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,247
- Trying to teach us our job. 
- Sir, I was just...

109
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,665
Sawant, what are you waiting for?

110
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,708
Sir. sir..

111
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,962
Stop. Stop.

112
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,674
What's the matter, brother?

113
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:56,884
There has been a raid here.

114
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,261
I stay close by. 
You can come and take a look.

115
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,429
I am just walking my dog.

116
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,306
This is not a garden 
for walking your dog.

117
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,557
Come on.

118
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,267
You're just wasting my time, 
brother.

119
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,686
Sir will show you who 
is wasting whose time.

120
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,564
It's not my fault, Sir. 
Please...

121
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,150
Sir, this man was loitering outside.

122
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,194
Who is he?

123
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,738
- Is he Vicky Singhania? 
- Sir...

124
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,032
What did I tell you, Wadhkar?

125
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,034
Find Vicky Singhania.

126
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,120
Wadhkar, you're only 
growing around your waist.

127
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,122
I've been trying 
to explain to them, Sir.

128
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,417
Who are you?

129
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:32,085
What is your name?

130
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,170
Sir, Kabir.

131
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,380
Kapoor? YouTube?

132
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,090
Right, sir. Right.

133
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,884
Awaken your Senses

134
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,553
Don't delay, don't be indecisive!

135
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,554
You got it.

136
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,889
It's a fact...

137
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,309
- My daughter Swara... 
- Yeah...

138
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,603
She is a huge fan of yours.

139
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:50,437
Thank you, sir.

140
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,189
She watches all your 
videos and gets motivated.

141
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,857
Thanks to your motivating, 
she even studies!

142
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,526
She just passed an 
exam because of you.

143
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,944
The credit goes to you, honestly.

144
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,153
Thank you. Thank you, Sir.

145
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,030
You also write, don't you?

146
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,782
You wrote that motivating book.

147
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,534
What's the name of your book?

148
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,952
Sir, Do It You Can.

149
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,703
Yes. Yes.

150
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,081
Great. Brilliant.

151
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,582
Thank you.

152
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,458
- Is he yours? 
- Yes.

153
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,376
Charmer.

154
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,418
Charmer, say hi to Sir.

155
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,336
Let it be.

156
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,712
Go on, not to worry. 
Go on.

157
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,797
Thank you, Sir.

158
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,215
Come on, Charmer, let's go.

159
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,264
Wadhkar, Senge, that Vicky 
Singhania gave us the slip...

160
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,057
Sir. 
We've found Vicky Singhania.

161
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,643
Sawant. Wadhkar.

162
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,979
- Take him away. 
- Sorry, Sir. Sorry, Sir.

163
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:42,155
Sir...raid successful, 
but Vicky Singhania is dead.

164
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,135
Sir, want to buy a novel?

165
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,845
Zaraan Khan's newest book.

166
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,096
It is even sexier 
than the previous one.

167
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,097
It's dark and dirty.

168
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,974
Hotter and Sexier than 
Reshma's sexy body...

169
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,392
...and even more bloody 
and violent than The Protector.

170
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,476
Please buy it, Sir.

171
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,105
The publisher of Traffic 
Jam Publications,

172
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,357
who publised writer Kabir 
Kapoor's "Do It You Can"

173
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,777
...has demanded his advance 
monies of five million back!

174
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,655
As per reports, 
Kabir Kapoor had to deliver...

175
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,032
...the sequel of this 
book within six-months...

176
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,534
...but has failed to do so, again, 
and is sighting personal reasons.

177
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,411
After hearing the 
arguments of both sides...

178
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,372
...the judge has given Kabir 
Kapoor a three month extension.

179
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,585
Otherwise, he's been instructed to 
return the advance monies paid to him.

180
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,213
I paid this man an 
advance two-years-ago.

181
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,590
Now he'll come back 
after three months...

182
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,883
...and say he needs 
another extension.

183
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,051
He will say, "I am trying..."

184
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,386
I think he doesn't want 
to write the second part.

185
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,388
Will Kabir Kapoor rise 
up to the situation...

186
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,850
...and "Do it again" 
for his fans or not?

187
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,730
This three-month extension 
can easily turn into three years.

188
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,150
I want to destroy that Kabir.

189
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,861
I can't put my finger on it.

190
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,324
What has been Kabir's source of 
income for the past two years?

191
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,869
Two-years-ago when I divorced him...

192
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,538
...I took everything from him.

193
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,748
He must be writing for someone else.

194
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,084
Do you really believe 
he's writing for someone else?

195
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,878
He's signed an affidavit in court.

196
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,466
If he's writing for someone else, 
and we can prove it...

197
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,929
...then I swear to God we 
will sue him for everything.

198
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,348
Including that old jalopy of his.

199
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,766
I want that too!

200
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,025
Hi, I am Rajiv Paul...

201
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,404
...and you wouldn't believe 
who is with me live today.

202
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,781
Kabir Kapoor's wife...

203
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:52,077
I mean ex-wife Rashmi Kapoor.

204
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,872
Kabir Kapoor is a bloody liar.

205
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:59,543
Before our marriage, he used 
to write short stories in Hindi.

206
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,336
I was the one who got him this deal.

207
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,130
And now he's defaming me.

208
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,487
Oh, God.

209
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,993
Yeah, JV, go on.

210
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:36,163
Finish the book, man. 
Get out of this damn contract.

211
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,541
According to that affidavit, you 
can't even write for anyone else.

212
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,170
If you don't finish this book and 
can't work for anyone else, then...

213
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,007
Please, Kabir, you've been 
writing this book for over a year.

214
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,551
Yeah, and even if you give me one 
more year I won't finish writing it.

215
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,346
I feel like a freaking fraud, JV.

216
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,014
I keep giving advice to everyone...

217
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,474
...but my own advice 
doesn't even work for me.

218
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,603
Always positive. 
Always smiling. Bulls**t, man!

219
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,315
Please, just find a way 
to return Randeep his money.

220
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,025
I see... 
and how do you plan to do that?

221
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,986
After paying the court fee, 
lawyer's fee and your alimony...

222
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:12,824
...you've around 325,034 rupees 
left in your bank. That's it.

223
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,785
She even took your flat in alimony.

224
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,286
So what are you left with?

225
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,622
Oh yes, your family 
bungalow in Panchgani.

226
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,998
Are you planning 
to sell that as well?

227
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,583
Look, I give a damn about her.

228
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,044
I am just interested in your book, 
in your career.

229
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,880
My God. 
This is not about Rashmi, JV.

230
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,549
Can we please leave her out of this?

231
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,217
No, I want to talk about it.

232
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,844
I mean how long will 
you stay in denial?

233
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,179
I was with you that day.

234
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,848
She is not some Saint.

235
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,768
That night she didn't 
just destroy your trust...

236
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,396
...she destroyed your confidence 
and your career too.

237
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,190
I saw you.

238
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,151
If this relationship continues...

239
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,446
...then your second book 
will get published as well.

240
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,950
Come on, dude. 
It doesn't need to be a good book.

241
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,785
It just needs to be a book.

242
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,538
Get it over and done with so 
we can get out of this contract.

243
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,164
Let's get moving, please.

244
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,209
Okay, okay. Fine, JV. Okay.

245
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,718
Come Charmer.

246
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,986
Hey! Have you gone mad?

247
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,196
What are you doing?

248
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,238
There is something 
wrong with the tyre Sir.

249
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,948
Just give me a minute. 
And you will be able to pass.

250
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,533
Take your time. 
Take your time.

251
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,958
Hey! Why did you 
bother stopping here?

252
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,835
You should have just 
driven straight in!

253
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,733
Hey... wait. wait.

254
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,278
Stop!

255
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,724
The backpacker without the bag!

256
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,684
Um yeah...

257
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,602
Did you leave your 
bag in that truck?

258
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,647
Come, I'll give you a lift.

259
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,607
I...

260
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,360
Come on, 
Lady, I am trying to help you.

261
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,362
Come, we'll catch the truck. 
Come on.

262
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,037
Hi, Kabir. That's Charmer.

263
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,374
Hi...

264
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,960
Hi, I'm Suhana.

265
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,011
Shit, I think we lost the truck.

266
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,890
Do you have any idea 
where the truck was headed?

267
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,226
How does it matter?

268
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,520
Where are you headed?

269
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,944
Look, this road leads to Mandavpur 
and that one leads to Panchgani.

270
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,237
I am headed to Panchgani.

271
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,198
Where were you planning on going?

272
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,116
Mandavpur.

273
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,118
Come on lets go to Panchgani!

274
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,634
That's stuck. That's stuck.

275
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,552
If you're feeling 
cold you can use this.

276
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,012
Thank you.

277
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,021
By the way, 
I am sorry we lost the truck.

278
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,773
Why?

279
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,441
Your bag was in that truck.

280
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,819
I never look at what I've lost

281
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,281
I always look at what I have gained.

282
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,535
Don't get me wrong!

283
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,162
By what I lost I mean...

284
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,081
- I lost my bumpy ride! 
- Right.

285
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,875
And by gain, I mean I gained 
a comfy lift and a jacket!

286
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,919
Right.

287
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,284
Sorry, I think you 
were having a nightmare.

288
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,828
Yeah, you rescued 
me by waking me up.

289
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,789
I was having a nightmare.

290
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,666
Isn't it weird?

291
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:18,130
We know everything about 
what's going on in outer space.

292
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:25,095
But we don't know what's going 
on in our mind, our inner space.

293
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:40,652
"Life is short, 
made up of a few moments"

294
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,112
Oh my, God.

295
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,363
Sorry, I just love this song.

296
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,157
Can I just...

297
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,783
Thank you.

298
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,249
"What exists today 
may not exist tomorrow"

299
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:58,295
"When we are together 
life is beautiful."

300
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,466
"Let's enjoy every 
moment to the fullest."

301
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,927
"Leave nothing for tomorrow."

302
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:09,806
"We should love with all we have."

303
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,894
"As a good heart, 
they say, is hard to find."

304
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,523
"We should love with all we have."

305
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:22,236
"As a good heart, 
they say, is hard to find."

306
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,139
Ahead on the left is 
the local transport office.

307
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,976
They have information on all 
the trucks that pass through here.

308
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,353
Wow really?

309
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,438
After this whole journey together

310
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,316
You're still 
thinking of that truck?

311
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,155
Thank you.

312
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,532
Your backpack?

313
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:13,412
It's always more 
fun to travel light!

314
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,998
Learn to move on dude.

315
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,165
Bye Charmer.

316
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,435
Yes, Sir!

317
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:40,480
As soon as I found out that my 
favourite student is back in town...

318
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,650
...I put your name 
down as the chief guest.

319
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:47,237
Kabir, the Rotary Club's 
function is at The Grand Hotel.

320
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:48,614
And you're the Chief Guest.

321
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,241
Oh no, I am really not feeling up to 
it Sir, can we please avoid it.

322
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,951
No way, I will see 
you tomorrow at 5pm.

323
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,787
Including students and members, 
there will just be 50 guests.

324
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:56,997
It's a small crowd.

325
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,833
Uh Ok, but please 
let's not do this again.

326
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,755
He's here. 
He's here.

327
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,806
People hide behind many masks...

328
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,601
Look, Chandu.

329
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,396
Hey Boss who's this?

330
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,192
Why you want to make 
an ID card of his?

331
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,402
Listen, wise guy.

332
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,238
You need to get out 
of town more often.

333
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:34,159
I am not going to 
let this guy out my sight.

334
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,710
Boss...I think my 
close up is better!

335
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:44,962
See...

336
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,840
Honestly, Chandu. 
I don't know why I hired you!

337
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,300
You really know how to wind me up.

338
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,830
Randeep. 
Great work.

339
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,582
Keep an eye on him.

340
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,003
It's all over the newspapers today.

341
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,130
He claims that he left me 
because I was having an affair.

342
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,965
I want to destroy him.

343
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,758
Now listen carefully.

344
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,679
We have bribed the gardener's 
daughter to seduce him.

345
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,682
I want to catch Kabir 
with his pants down.

346
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,601
Her name is Bindiya.

347
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:44,771
So the sexy sultry Bindiya will 
soon be trending all over Facebook.

348
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:49,026
But Randeep, I am really 
going to be pissed off...

349
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,402
...if I don't get my money...

350
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,904
Right?

351
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:55,157
No cash on time, 
then no photos will go online.

352
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,086
- Bindiya... 
- What took you so long?

353
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,963
I've been waiting 
for you since morning.

354
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,798
- How are you? 
- Great.

355
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,425
- All good. 
- Yeah.

356
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,386
And how is that...Ramesh?

357
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,597
Come on, Charmer.

358
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,891
Both our lives have 
met with the same fate.

359
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:23,644
- What? 
- Separation!

360
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,065
Divorce.

361
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,194
- Can I take your bags? 
- No, it's okay.

362
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,487
I'll manage it.

363
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,738
Okay.

364
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,410
Okay, fine. 
You can go and call your father now.

365
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,455
Actually Father had to 
suddenly go to the village.

366
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,999
- Why? 
- A relative met with an accident.

367
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,668
He'll be back in a couple of days.

368
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,505
Until then I am here 
to take care of you.

369
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,679
Come on, Charmer. 
Good boy.

370
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,144
Bindiya, take these pictures down.

371
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,856
And I don't want to see any 
of these old pictures anywhere.

372
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,108
Yes.

373
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,570
You won? see them again.

374
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,713
If you're positive you can do it.

375
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:34,882
You think you can do it?

376
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,258
Stop kidding yourself, 
who are you trying to fool.

377
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,093
Ok but I have to try, let me try.

378
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,556
Always... Always... Always...

379
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:43,849
Always be happy.

380
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,101
Yeah...like you're happy.

381
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,853
I know how happy you are.

382
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,150
"Let it be..."

383
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,819
"Just let it go..."

384
00:28:55,903 --> 00:29:01,450
"Try and smile through the pain"

385
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,452
"Let it be..."

386
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,829
"Just let it go..."

387
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,581
"Try and smile through the pain"

388
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,834
"Don't let the agonies 
of the past bog you down."

389
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:15,005
"They have left you 
sleepless and exhausted"

390
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,928
"...let these teary 
eyes rest for a while."

391
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,679
"Let it be..."

392
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,140
"Just let it go..."

393
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:30,354
"Let go of this suffering"

394
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,606
"Let it be..."

395
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,775
"Just let it go..."

396
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:40,614
"Let go of the poisonous 
residue of this curse"

397
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:45,202
"Let it be..."

398
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,209
"The memories that haunt you."

399
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:57,130
"Silence that cries out loud."

400
00:29:57,256 --> 00:30:01,927
"The enmity you have with light..."

401
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:06,515
"...and your disapproval with life."

402
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,686
"Just let it be..."

403
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:15,607
"Let it go.."

404
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:20,612
"Let it go.."

405
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,825
"Let it go..."

406
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,627
Yes, Sir.

407
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,838
Kabir, where are you?

408
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:40,841
I'll be there, Sir,

409
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,176
I'll be there at 5 o'clock.

410
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,927
It's already 5 o'clock.

411
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,846
What are you waiting for?

412
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,186
I am coming. I'm on my way.

413
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,188
Hurry up, we're all waiting.

414
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,620
- Hi, Kabir. 
- Hey, Sir.

415
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,662
How are you?

416
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,373
- Sorry for being late. 
- How are you doing?

417
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,792
Not a problem. 
Good you came.

418
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,047
These are our fellow Rotarians.

419
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,175
And our P.I Mrs Trupti Sonawane.

420
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,718
Ma'am.

421
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,188
Suhana.

422
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,148
Hi.

423
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,483
Hi...

424
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,487
Kabir. Come on.

425
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,281
I'll be right back.

426
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,912
He's really hot!

427
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,916
- How do you know him? 
- We've met...

428
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,253
I mean we don't really 
know each other well

429
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,587
We met only once.

430
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,799
Actually, he was the one 
who gave me a lift to Panchgani.

431
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,260
Wow.

432
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,262
Hot guys are giving you lifts.

433
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,097
You even got a job.

434
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,766
And my uniform perfectly fits you!

435
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,603
- Now give me your ID Card. 
- What for?

436
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,106
Well it's always required 
for a new employee.

437
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,109
Oh... his jacket.

438
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,028
Can I just return 
this and come right back.

439
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:26,905
Just two minutes. Please.

440
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,745
Yes it's okay. 
I'll call you if I need you.

441
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:40,627
"Awaken your senses"

442
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,254
"Don't delay, don't be indecisive!"

443
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,255
"Awaken your senses"

444
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,965
"Don't just think about it, do it"

445
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:45,966
"Awaken your senses"

446
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,676
"Get out there and 
chase your dreams"

447
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:48,677
"Awaken your senses"

448
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,470
"Then you can conquer the world."

449
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:51,513
"Awaken your senses"

450
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,145
Good evening, Sir. I am Pallavi.

451
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,439
You're such a successful writer.

452
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:03,358
Can you tell us a secret 
formula for success!

453
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:07,321
Look, I'll tell you from 
my personal experience...

454
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,240
...there are two sides to all of us.

455
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,953
One is our decent side 
the one we show to the world.

456
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:17,122
The one that behaves well, 
says good things.

457
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,875
Even if someone humiliates us,

458
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,462
...that side of us just smiles 
and ignores it.

459
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,547
And the other side of us...

460
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,799
The other side is the evil side.

461
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,843
The one we don't show to the world,

462
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,345
...the one we keep concealed within.

463
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,263
The one that might 
not be acceptable.

464
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,018
So if you want to 
be a good writer...

465
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:45,025
... don't only listen 
to the good side of you!

466
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,495
Yeah...

467
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,875
My name is Ricky Rosario.

468
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,794
I am from Goa.

469
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,839
Full-time detective, 
part-time reporter.

470
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:12,845
It's my job to keep 
an eye on that evil side.

471
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,306
I've been following 
you for a while now.

472
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,308
I mean your work.

473
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,352
My question.

474
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:26,608
What if that evil 
side is a violent beast?

475
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,905
A ferocious predator.

476
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,911
Look, Ricky Rosario, right?

477
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:43,876
If there's a beast inside of you, 
then I think you're very lucky.

478
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,547
In fact, I would say, 
you should nurture that beast.

479
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,009
Let it think what it's thinking.

480
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,887
Let it do what it desires.

481
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:59,349
If someone's bothering 
you and you want to kill him...

482
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,602
Kill him!

483
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,065
I mean kill him discreetly.

484
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,612
Let him loose.

485
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,992
But only in your books,

486
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,083
only as a writer, okay!

487
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,772
Autograph, please.

488
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,153
Is this reaction from 
the beast lurking within you...

489
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,949
...or the beast hiding inside?

490
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,996
Mr. Ghost Writer, you're finished.

491
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,583
You filed a false 
affidavit in court.

492
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,921
Do you know how I caught you?

493
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:12,714
I read both your books.

494
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,008
One in English, 
and the other in Hindi.

495
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,678
The writing styles are very similar

496
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,848
I am sorry but I don't 
autograph other writers books.

497
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,683
- Next. 
- Come.

498
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,518
I have another gift for you.

499
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:25,894
- Excuse me, Sir... 
- This photograph of yours.

500
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:26,937
Can I get your autograph?

501
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,730
Excuse me, I haven't finished yet.

502
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,816
- I... 
- Excuse me. Come with me.

503
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,734
- Madam, what for? 
- I'll tell you what for.

504
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,194
Madam, we're the media. 
We're allowed.

505
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,071
- Who invited you here? 
- Who invited us?

506
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,573
The media doesn't need 
any kind of invitation.

507
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,074
Well they need an 
invitation here. Come on.

508
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,450
Don't touch me.

509
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:44,663
What a stubborn a**

510
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:45,914
You should've punched him!

511
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,584
Sorry, Mr. Writer, 
I couldn't wash it.

512
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,377
Sir, can I have an autograph?

513
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:52,087
Thank you.

514
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,883
Sir...Sir...

515
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:07,936
'Mr. Ghost Writer, 
you are finished.'

516
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:27,080
Mr. Khan, hello.

517
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:33,086
There's a journalist 
by the name of Ricky Rosario.

518
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,755
From Goa.

519
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:38,091
He has discovered that 
I write books for you.

520
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,844
He says that he will expose me.

521
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:46,266
Yes, sir... Yes, sir...

522
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,809
Yes...

523
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,073
Bindiya, what are you doing?

524
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:02,824
Do you have a pill?

525
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,909
Huh...

526
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,786
I feel sick.

527
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,372
My entire body's burning.

528
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,706
See... honestly.

529
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:15,379
Father said I should stay here 
with you until he doesn't return.

530
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,215
Can I sleep here tonight?

531
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,466
Yes.

532
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,801
I'm feeling nervous.

533
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:22,135
I can't sleep alone.

534
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,972
Listen, Bindiya, go to the village.

535
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,682
And come back with 
your Father, okay.

536
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,184
Okay. Fine. I am going.

537
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,486
Where are you taking that? 
Leave it.

538
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,488
Give it back. 
Come on.

539
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,409
Now leave.

540
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:59,339
Hey! Why did you 
bother stopping here?

541
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,966
You should have just 
driven straight in!

542
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,596
After this whole journey together...

543
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,432
...you're still 
thinking of that truck?

544
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,853
What a stubborn a** 
You should've punched him!

545
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,740
"I've been a lonely wanderer..."

546
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,951
"...until you came into my life."

547
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,704
"As you graciously shared 
your warmth and love with me..."

548
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:32,497
"I've found happiness and strength"

549
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,041
"And now my lonely days have gone."

550
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,210
"Now nothing seems like before."

551
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,795
"I feel relieved from 
my old miserable self."

552
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:43,550
"I feel happy whenever 
I am close to you."

553
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,018
Come on, Charmer, let's go.

554
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,561
Here, here.

555
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,021
Here. Let's go here.

556
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:57,564
Come on, let's get a hot dog.

557
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,404
Suhana.

558
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,074
Are you stalking me?

559
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,492
No, actually I've been...

560
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,078
...stalking the delicious omelettes 
here since the age of 16!

561
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,375
By the way, I read your book.

562
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,126
Oh, God. I am so sorry.

563
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:22,840
No, books are different.

564
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:24,967
If I like a book I can 
read it over and over again.

565
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,218
- Really? 
- Really...

566
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,679
So will my poor book be one of...

567
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,724
...your read 'over and over' 
again books?

568
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,728
Do you want the truth 
from the inner beast...

569
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:39,314
...or lies from the 
descent outer self?!

570
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,149
What do you want to hear?

571
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,907
'The bright smile 
across your face...'

572
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,326
'...hides the inner 
beast inside you.'

573
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,288
Show me.

574
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,207
You're not Rajnikant.

575
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,292
You're only Chandrakant!

576
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,293
Just take the photos.

577
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,628
You didn't go to school.

578
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,630
Well my dad was in the army.

579
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,301
So that meant every two years 
a new posting, a new cantonment.

580
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,428
So Mum opted to homeschool instead.

581
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,846
Who is this girl?

582
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:13,599
Hey Panchgani's photographer, 
do you know who she is?

583
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,602
And your parents sound really cool. 
I'd love to meet them.

584
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,064
You'll have to go to 
heaven to meet my parents.

585
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,485
God, I am so sorry.

586
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:26,987
No, no, I mean...

587
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:31,950
- We all go to heaven someday. 
- Right.

588
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:37,080
I was very young when 
they met with an accident...

589
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:40,792
...and I realised that 
there are no controls in life.

590
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:44,087
You just have to keep moving ahead.

591
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:45,422
You know...

592
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:46,965
Whatever you come across...

593
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,511
Truck, tractor, scooter, car...

594
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,138
Just take a lift and keep moving.

595
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,937
Anyway, so tell me 
what can I do in Panchgani?

596
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,231
Well...

597
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:06,902
Like mountain climbing, trekking, 
para-gliding, something.

598
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,487
That you wouldn't do!

599
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:13,700
Actually, I used to know 
someone who did all this.

600
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,248
Andre.

601
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:21,416
- Yeah... 
- Andre, yeah.

602
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,877
Okay, so where can 
I find this Andre?

603
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,089
You'll find this 
guy at Harrison's Folly.

604
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,007
Just one card.

605
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,844
When I get my hands 
on that one card...

606
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,721
...it's game over.

607
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,735
Here we are.

608
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:52,489
You look hot in my clothes!

609
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,867
Bye.

610
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,457
Andre! Hey!

611
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,753
Andre! Here!

612
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:39,411
"I've been a lonely wanderer..."

613
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,625
"...until you came into my life."

614
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,339
"As you graciously shared 
your warmth and love with me"

615
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,466
"I've found happiness and strength"

616
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,135
"And now my lonely days have gone."

617
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,763
"Now nothing seems like before."

618
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:00,474
"I feel relieved from 
my old miserable self."

619
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:06,313
"I feel happy whenever 
I am close to you."

620
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:09,983
"Yes... This is love."

621
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,444
"Yes...This is love."

622
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,029
"No one knows it, 
until it happens..."

623
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,405
"No one knows it, 
until it happens..."

624
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,575
"Yes... This is love."

625
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:40,931
"I can't take my eyes off you, 
I wonder why."

626
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:47,396
"I feel this strange effect, 
I wonder why."

627
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:57,197
"I can't take my eyes off you, 
I wonder why."

628
00:44:57,322 --> 00:45:01,994
"I feel this strange effect, 
I wonder why."

629
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,621
"The paths keep telling me..."

630
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,457
"...I had to say this someday."

631
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:12,880
"I feel happy whenever 
I am close to you."

632
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,382
"Yes... This is love."

633
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:16,717
"Yes... This is love."

634
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,178
"Yes... This is love."

635
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:20,846
"No one knows it, 
until it happens..."

636
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,222
"No one knows it, 
until it happens..."

637
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:23,682
"Yes... This is love."

638
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,643
"Yes... This is love."

639
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,022
"Yes... This is love."

640
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,815
"Yes... This is love."

641
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,233
"Yes... This is love."

642
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:35,110
"Yes... This is love."

643
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,196
"Yes... This is love."

644
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,906
"Yes... This is love."

645
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:50,417
Do you want to cause a racket again?

646
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,752
I am looking out for the dog. 
Where is the dog?

647
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:52,878
The dog is with him.

648
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,047
Where is that Bindiya?

649
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:56,924
Bindiya isn't here.

650
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:01,929
Where the hell are you going?

651
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,021
There she is.

652
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,068
She's amazing, boss.

653
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:43,971
- Yeah, tell me. 
- I am inside the house.

654
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,305
Where inside the house?

655
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:48,350
In the living room. 
The main door's behind me.

656
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,769
Go left and keep walking straight.

657
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,229
Okay.

658
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:55,607
There is a work table 
and a typewriter.

659
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:58,652
Go straight and 
you'll see a bathroom.

660
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:01,071
I am in the bathroom.

661
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:02,406
You'll see two doors 
in the bathroom.

662
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:04,533
One on your left 
and one on your right.

663
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,286
But there's a mirror on my left.

664
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,122
Mirror. There was 
never a mirror there.

665
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,206
There was no mirror.

666
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,583
Just...look.

667
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:15,794
Hold on just a minute.

668
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:19,840
This mirror.

669
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,469
This mirror's on a hook.

670
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,850
Yes, there is a door.

671
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,853
Kabir used to spend a 
lot of time in that storeroom.

672
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,105
But he would never let me go in.

673
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,150
I never really trusted him.

674
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,869
It's open.

675
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,787
Oh, yes.

676
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,042
Ricky, find me some information...

677
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,544
...so he has to return my advance.

678
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,254
We don't want the advance back.

679
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:02,216
I want that Panchgani house of his.

680
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:11,725
There are weird things written here.

681
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,227
Murders.

682
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,022
Is he a murderer? 
Does he have a past?

683
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,899
- Like doing time in jail. 
- What?

684
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:24,071
Abducted, raped and robbed 
Where have you brought me?

685
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,572
Kabir is a complete psycho.

686
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:26,907
I can't find the 
light switch either?

687
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,325
This place is completely dark.

688
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,619
Yeah...found the switch.

689
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:37,167
Look for something that 
can be used in the court, okay.

690
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,586
Look for files, a computer.

691
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,093
Come out, come out wherever you are.

692
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:59,731
Come out. 
Come out.

693
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:00,941
Come out.

694
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,456
Laptop.

695
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:18,917
Laptop. Perfect!

696
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,712
Now, what do you want me to do?

697
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:24,798
Check for any kind of financial 
transactions in his name.

698
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,884
It's on. 
Password.

699
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,387
Password? 
Password?

700
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:33,265
Wait. Try Charmer.

701
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:34,975
Charmer.

702
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:38,812
Not working.

703
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:42,065
Cancerian.

704
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,070
Cancerian.

705
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,449
- Got it. 
- Not opening.

706
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,250
Try 661968.

707
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,008
Got it?

708
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:10,385
It's locked.

709
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,304
- What now? 
- Leave it there.

710
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,680
Don't touch it.

711
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,266
Leave it where it was 
and quietly get out of there.

712
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:24,858
Kabir should not find 
out anything about this.

713
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,028
Okay, copy that.

714
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:44,127
When there's darkness 
in your life...

715
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:47,214
...you feel lonely and depressed.

716
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,968
Then someone comes 
in as a ray of hope...

717
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:56,849
...and reminds you that brings 
love and light back in your life.

718
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:00,561
Who is this girl Roshini?

719
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,358
Stupid.

720
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,578
Kabir Sir, 
I hope I am not disturbing you.

721
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:18,871
Did you have breakfast?

722
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:22,165
You see, my Goan aunty, Mrs. 
Writer...

723
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:25,085
...has sent you 
some food for thought.

724
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:26,879
Here are today's headlines.

725
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,840
It's fresh and exciting.

726
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,802
I got the rest from the laptop 
you had hidden.

727
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,638
By the way, 
your secret room was amazing.

728
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,891
But the password 
of your laptop was easy.

729
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:41,727
Because Zaraan Khan 
was on the wall, brother.

730
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:46,648
And here's a small bonus from me.

731
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:47,983
Tasty like dessert.

732
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:53,071
Ego Nightclub, remember. 
I was there.

733
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,615
But I slipped out 
when I saw the Police.

734
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:58,785
Nice picture, isn't it?

735
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:00,120
Paparazzi.

736
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:01,955
You given everyone 
something to be happy about.

737
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,708
By killing Vicky Singhania 
you made the Police happy.

738
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,670
See...even ma'am 
is looking so happy.

739
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:11,465
Ma'am. Good morning. Smile, please.

740
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,300
Photographer. 
Sorry.

741
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:18,388
You got inspired and started 
writing the Zaraan Khan novels...

742
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:23,810
...which inspired five copycat murders 
in different parts of the country.

743
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:25,270
And now the media's happy.

744
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,858
You have done something 
for everyone but nothing for me.

745
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,318
Smile, please.

746
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,320
I've brought a 
partnership deal for you.

747
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:34,780
Look, ma'am.

748
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,324
Randeep and Rashmi offered 
me one million rupees.

749
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,951
I've scrapped that deal, okay.

750
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,702
I'll make a new deal with you.

751
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,121
Two hundred thousand 
for not telling the Police.

752
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:46,500
Two hundred thousand 
for note telling the media.

753
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,168
That makes four hundred thousand.

754
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,754
If you pay in cash then no GST.

755
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:54,007
My phone number's on that 
newspaper, so keep it with you.

756
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,134
Call me when you're ready, huh!

757
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:57,886
I am every ready.

758
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,180
Enjoy.

759
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:02,099
And if anything happens to me...

760
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:07,479
...then my partner will tell 
the Police and media everything.

761
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:23,036
In dark nights...

762
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:25,747
...and lonely streets.

763
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:30,085
Zaraan Khan sets 
out to protect the weak.

764
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,595
This is my real self.

765
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,556
I've made many mistakes in life.

766
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,976
But writing Zaraan 
Khan was not a mistake.

767
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:48,896
People don't know...

768
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:55,360
But when Rashmi left me, 
I was completely shattered.

769
00:53:56,069 --> 00:54:00,240
I was trying to write a 
motivational book, but all in vain.

770
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:04,369
And then...I asked myself one day...

771
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,788
...what do you want to write, Kabir.

772
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,208
What's in your heart? 
Tell me.

773
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,878
And this question 
gave rise to Zaraan Khan.

774
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:17,716
I vented my anger, my frustration, 
everything in these books.

775
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:26,433
I made Zaraan Khan.

776
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,728
But Zaraan Khan saved me.

777
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,815
I should've told you earlier, but...

778
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:36,527
It's okay, I can understand.

779
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,961
Who are the Khan Brothers?

780
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,381
They are my unofficial publishers.

781
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,174
They are from the underworld.

782
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:03,846
They started a publishing house to 
turn their black money into white.

783
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,724
But they have always 
really-really supported me.

784
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,938
I don't read Hindi novels.

785
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:17,317
But the other day when 
Ricky was escorted out...

786
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,487
...some staff member 
left this at the reception.

787
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,953
You know I always wondered...

788
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:31,832
...how romantic novel writers 
would be in real life...

789
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:41,091
When evil starts to spread 
its tentacles in the night...

790
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:47,848
When those of the 
law are incapable...

791
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:51,518
Then comes the night-warrior.

792
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,770
The protector of the weak.

793
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,651
The one who breaks the law 
to uphold it. Zaraan Khan.

794
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:11,163
He was an emperor.

795
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:14,041
And the entire city was his kingdom.

796
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:19,338
That helpless girl immediately fell 
in love with Zaraan.

797
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:21,215
Unconditional love.

798
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,469
Without much effort 
or even breaking into a sweat...

799
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:28,931
...Zaraan Khan taught 
every rabid dog a lesson.

800
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:32,392
Without saying a word, 
using his punches and kicks.

801
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:40,943
He used their own 
weapons to defeat them.

802
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:45,322
He scattered them like 
a bunch of leaves in a storm.

803
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:03,382
She was prepared 
to even die for him.

804
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,220
Once she made a commitment, 
she would never go back.

805
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,266
The protector of the weak.

806
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,893
The protector of the weak. 
Zaraan Khan.

807
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:19,022
Two halves can make 
one complete circle.

808
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:23,527
Kabir, you must 
have millions of fans.

809
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,946
This is just amazing.

810
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:31,034
Okay, listen, announce at a press 
conference that 'I am Zaraan Khan'.

811
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,579
It's the truth. 
It will set you free.

812
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,163
Come on.

813
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,710
No, sweetheart. No.

814
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:42,713
I...

815
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:46,425
I can't...

816
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,724
This...truth will ruin me.

817
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:58,645
I signed an affidavit 
in the court...

818
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,356
...that I'm writing a motivational 
book for Randeep...

819
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,400
...and what am I actually writing?

820
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,030
Zaraan Khan.

821
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:15,078
Actually, 
I could go to jail for perjury.

822
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:16,663
You know what I am saying.

823
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:19,833
Randeep will never 
let me off the hook.

824
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,918
He will keep coming after me.

825
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,170
Be it Ricky or someone else.

826
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:33,347
Okay, I think I have an idea.

827
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,850
Get Ricky Rosario here now.

828
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:42,022
Okay, I've a plan that 
will benefit everyone.

829
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:45,692
We'll call a press conference where 
the Khan Brothers will announce...

830
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:49,238
...that you, Ricky Rosario, are 
Zaraan Khan's ghostwriter.

831
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,114
Ricky Rosario.

832
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:56,787
Right. 
I'll keep writing for you.

833
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,706
And Khan Brothers 
will keep paying you.

834
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:02,709
So you won't just get paid but you 
will also become famous, Ricky.

835
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,461
Don't you get that?

836
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:06,213
It's hard cash on time.

837
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:13,554
Zaraan Khan style copycat killing 
will take Ricky Rosario to...

838
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,229
What do I look like to you?

839
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,231
What do I look like? 
Do I look stupid to you?

840
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,108
Take a closer look.

841
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:28,694
What does copycat mean? 
Someone who copies you.

842
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:32,489
So if someone copied your 
stories to commit a murder...

843
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:33,991
...will the Police come after you?

844
00:59:34,116 --> 00:59:35,284
Exactly.

845
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,203
Pay cash and finish this matter.

846
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:39,705
In short.

847
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,082
You know what I can do.

848
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,502
So imagine if anything 
happens to me...

849
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:46,837
...what I could do to you.

850
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:48,714
Will I let you?

851
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:50,757
Think about it.

852
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,467
Are you threatening me?

853
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:53,760
Okay, okay. 
Relax.

854
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,012
You tell him.

855
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,555
Ricky. one minute.

856
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,766
If we had money we 
would've paid Randeep back.

857
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:01,393
We don't have the money.

858
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,605
Look, there isn't a better option.

859
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,731
Kabir won't go to jail.

860
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:08,150
You'll get fame and fortune.

861
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,778
Hey writer, 
take some lessons from her.

862
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,617
Educate girls and 
you can reform a country.

863
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,453
Okay. Give me time to think.

864
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:22,873
See you.

865
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,382
He is going to ruin me.

866
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:40,224
You? Zaraan Khan?

867
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:50,817
Look...you do know the 
amount of effort it took...

868
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:56,365
...to make this classy, intellectual 
motivator image of yours.

869
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,035
Kabir Kapoor, the thinking 
woman's sex symbol, remember.

870
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:01,578
Yes...

871
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:05,165
If they find out that he 
writes cheap literature...

872
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,334
...that sells on bus stands 
then they will ruin you.

873
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,462
Calm down, 
that's your fourth packet of sugar.

874
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:11,672
You'll get diabetes.

875
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,258
Leave it. Calm down. 
We're bloody finished.

876
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:18,053
Okay, look.

877
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,222
I have a plan.

878
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:21,598
Great.

879
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,434
You just call up Randeep.

880
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:27,521
And tell him that his 
guy's double-crossing him.

881
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,482
I know Randeep. 
He'll finish him.

882
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:33,819
Hey...what's wrong with you?

883
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:36,363
What are you 
talking...finishing him?

884
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:40,784
Boss, please don't turn your 
own life into a Zaraan Khan novel.

885
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,329
I've decided that's 
what we're going to do.

886
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,249
And if Randeep doesn't...

887
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,710
...take any action I've already 
spoken with the Khan Brothers.

888
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:52,504
My publishers, they won't spare him.

889
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:54,006
Wow...

890
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,802
Dude, did I ever know you? 
Do I know you?

891
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,804
You're still Kabir, right?

892
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:02,723
Or have you turned into 
Zaraan Khan completely?

893
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:05,100
Fine, don't be so dramatic.

894
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:07,603
You should've told me earlier.

895
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:09,229
Now let me digest this, okay.

896
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:10,564
Let me think about what to do.

897
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:15,068
You've made a mess of things... 
unnecessarily, man.

898
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,773
Shit.

899
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:33,772
Who's there?

900
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:35,899
Who's there?

901
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,612
Hey.

902
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,197
Who's there?

903
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:52,809
These nails 
Were used to puncture the tyre.

904
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:55,896
Put it in the bag.

905
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:59,233
And the mobile too... fetch 
all the records from it.

906
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,901
Get it fixed.

907
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,278
Show me the register.

908
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,197
Is he a local? 
Does anyone know him?

909
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,907
No, madam.

910
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:09,701
- Did you find any kind of ID? 
- Yes, madam.

911
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,083
He's...

912
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,669
- What's his name? 
- Ricky Rosario.

913
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,463
Ricky Rosario.

914
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:27,886
He's that guy who had come 
to the Police station. Remember.

915
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:29,888
He's from Goa.

916
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,265
I'll tell you.

917
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:32,933
Make a report.

918
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:34,268
And send the body for post mortem.

919
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:35,644
You two come with me.

920
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:36,895
Yes.

921
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,732
Come, Madam's calling you.

922
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,652
Come on. Hurry up.

923
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:49,658
Madam.

924
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:55,539
Parthe, search the entire house.

925
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:58,208
If you find anything 
suspicious don't touch it.

926
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:00,210
Call me. 
Go.

927
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:04,506
I came to ask a few questions.

928
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,301
What happened to your hand?

929
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:09,136
Its just a strain.

930
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,722
I got a flat tyre last night.

931
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,100
Thats weird. There seems to be a lof 
flat tyres in my area these days.

932
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,311
I should've come last evening.

933
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:21,565
Where were you last 
night between 10 and 12?

934
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,567
I went to Pune in the evening.

935
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:26,653
And came back around 11:30.

936
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,698
How can you say so accurately...

937
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:41,710
Hi. What's going on?

938
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,086
Everything is okay.

939
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,547
- I was asking you a question. 
- Yes.

940
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:49,384
You said you came 
back from Pune at 11:30.

941
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,136
Do you have any kind of evidence?

942
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:53,597
Madam, will you tell 
me what's going on?

943
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,182
Do you know Ricky Rosario?

944
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:57,851
Ricky Rosario?

945
01:06:57,976 --> 01:06:59,895
Of course you know Ricky Rosario.

946
01:07:01,813 --> 01:07:03,273
He's been murdered.

947
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:06,735
He came to the Police Station...

948
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,031
...to complain that you 
threatened to kill him.

949
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:14,535
I want to file a complaint 
against Kabir Kapoor, ma'am.

950
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:17,329
I went to interview 
him and he threatened me.

951
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,331
The nation must know!

952
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:20,791
Once again the same question.

953
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:24,586
When you returned from Pune...

954
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:26,672
...did anyone see you?

955
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,299
Do you have any evidence? 
Was someone with you?

956
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:32,511
- Actually, I... 
- He was with me.

957
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:37,224
We went to Pune 
together and later in...

958
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,726
...the night he dropped 
me at the hotel.

959
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:41,228
Right.

960
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:44,565
- What time? 
- Around...

961
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,316
I didn't ask you!

962
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,445
What time did he 
drop you at the hotel?

963
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,072
Tell me.

964
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:54,408
I don't have all day! Hurry up!

965
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:55,158
What time?

966
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:58,161
- Around 11:15. 
- Right.

967
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:03,876
I dropped her at the hotel at 11:15 
and reached home at around 11:30.

968
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:05,919
Smart!

969
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,880
What's your connection?

970
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,506
Relationship?

971
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,269
As of now it's early days

972
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,104
But for now you can 
call me his girlfriend.

973
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,111
Jai Hind, Sir.

974
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:35,240
Sir...we are in the middle 
of the investigation.

975
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:36,700
That's why I am here.

976
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,454
No, Sir. The body has 
been sent for post mortem.

977
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,414
The mobile phone's 
completely broken.

978
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,292
Looks like it was run 
over by some kind of vehicle.

979
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,961
I've sent it for data retrieval.

980
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,714
Yes, Sir. 
Yes, Sir.

981
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,090
I'll come right away.

982
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:53,425
Okay, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

983
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,011
Madam, we didn't find anything.

984
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:57,930
SP Sir has called us.

985
01:08:58,138 --> 01:08:59,431
You two have to come down 
to the Police Station...

986
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:00,807
...to record your statements.

987
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:02,100
- This evening. 
- Yes, of course.

988
01:09:02,226 --> 01:09:03,393
Let's go.

989
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:16,406
Suhana!

990
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,659
Why did you tell the 
Police that you were with me?

991
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:20,160
They will go to the hotel! 
They'll ask around!

992
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:21,870
They'll find out the truth!

993
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,580
Okay, Kabir, calm down.

994
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:25,874
Yesterday I was feeling 
disturbed so I slept early.

995
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,627
I mean I was in my room. 
No one saw me.

996
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:31,088
- You're sure. 
- Yes, I am 100% sure.

997
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:32,673
Why are you so worried?

998
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,133
And what about the time?

999
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,261
How did you find out 
that I had said 11:30?

1000
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:39,096
The inspector said it herself.

1001
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:43,141
You said you came 
back from Pune at 11:30.

1002
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,477
Oh yeah, right.

1003
01:09:46,603 --> 01:09:49,022
Tell me honestly, 
Kabir, did you kill Ricky...

1004
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,276
Are you serious, Suhana?

1005
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:55,195
Sorry...

1006
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:02,995
Wait here, 
I've got something for you.

1007
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,042
Yes, Sir.

1008
01:10:10,836 --> 01:10:12,546
Yes, Sir. One problem has 
been taken care of.

1009
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:15,799
I'll call you back after 
I've dealt with the other one.

1010
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,468
Yes, Sir.

1011
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:20,637
Thank you.

1012
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,516
I got this for you.

1013
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,602
It's my favourite book. 
You'll enjoy it.

1014
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:27,853
It's my favourite book.

1015
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:30,898
Listen, I am so sorry 
I shouted at you.

1016
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,568
Oh my God. 
I have to go to the hotel right now.

1017
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:37,696
There's a guest for the check-in.

1018
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:39,198
See you in the evening.

1019
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:41,408
Listen, I'm going see my lawyer 
in the evening.

1020
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:43,160
I'll call you when I come back.

1021
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:44,244
Yeah.

1022
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:54,338
Hello, do you know 
the Police were here today?

1023
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:55,923
Fine, I am coming there.

1024
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,258
Don't call me again.

1025
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,386
Fine, I'll call you back later.

1026
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:11,813
- Suhana, are you alright? 
- Yeah.

1027
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,440
You've not been 
yourself since morning.

1028
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:14,566
Do you want to see a doctor?

1029
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:17,861
No. 
I am just tired.

1030
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:22,533
Listen, is there a 
photo studio around town?

1031
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:24,952
Yes. Chandrakant photo studio.

1032
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,162
It's located at Siddharth 
Nagar's Shopping Centre.

1033
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:30,707
Why? Do you need your picture taken?

1034
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:33,293
No. One of the guests was asking.

1035
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,420
I see...but it must be closed now.

1036
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,635
Keys...

1037
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,472
I'll just check the room. 
You finish your work, okay.

1038
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:46,765
Yeah.

1039
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:27,139
Give you the pictures? Why?

1040
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,935
We first take pictures 
of the girl...

1041
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,520
...and then take her money.

1042
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:35,272
But we never give pictures.

1043
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,368
If you tell anyone about me...

1044
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:53,832
...then I'll kill you 
first and then Kabir.

1045
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,795
I am only doing what's been written.

1046
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:47,344
Surprise!

1047
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:51,014
I am so sorry.

1048
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:53,308
Are you okay?

1049
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:57,688
Yeah, I was just 
thinking about something...

1050
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,773
God, I am so sorry.

1051
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:01,441
No, no, it's okay.

1052
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:07,447
My love, your idea has set me free.

1053
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:11,702
Remember you said 
let the world know...

1054
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:13,453
...you are ghostwriter 
of Zaraan Khan.

1055
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:15,831
- Right? 
- Yeah.

1056
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:17,624
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah...

1057
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,126
Sorry... yeah.

1058
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:23,005
So I went on my 
blog today and said...

1059
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,299
...I don't just write 
motivational books,

1060
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:27,217
but I also write Hindi novels.

1061
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:30,971
And I challenge all of you 
to guess what book I have written?

1062
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:34,641
And what about the affidavit 
you signed in the court?

1063
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:39,021
Right! So my lawyer turned 
out to be a smooth player.

1064
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:42,983
- Are you sure you're okay? 
- Yeah.

1065
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:46,195
Just...I guess I am just tired.

1066
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:50,657
Okay. So he said don't worry. 
Go home and rest.

1067
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:53,327
I'll prove that you wrote 
this book couple of years ago.

1068
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,454
And gave it to the Khan Brothers.

1069
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:56,663
But they are being published now.

1070
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:58,790
- So you're free. 
- Yeah.

1071
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:01,668
Actually I should be thanking you,

1072
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:04,671
...you idea was amazing.

1073
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:06,924
We're fine.

1074
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,052
Yeah, I just...

1075
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:13,931
I have to go to the bakery to pick 
up something for one of the guests.

1076
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,432
Forget the bakery.

1077
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,350
Let's go home. 
I've got a surprise for you.

1078
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,393
No Kabir, 
I need to go to the bakery, please.

1079
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:19,686
Now.

1080
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,232
What happened here? 
The Police are here too.

1081
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,360
Something's happened here.

1082
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,282
I'll go take a look. 
Wait for me in the car.

1083
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:34,868
Yeah.

1084
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:45,295
What happened here?

1085
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,339
Something terrible happened inside. 
But they aren't telling us anything.

1086
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:48,257
Back. Move back.

1087
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:50,717
Hey you in the yellow T-shirt. 
Step back.

1088
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:55,681
Stay back. Move.

1089
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:00,310
Cash, camera, 
and everything else is untouched.

1090
01:16:00,561 --> 01:16:01,812
This doesn't seem 
like a case of theft.

1091
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,188
There's something 
else going on here.

1092
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:04,523
Madam, I found these.

1093
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:08,735
Where did you find these?

1094
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:09,736
These are all the items 
I found in the alley.

1095
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:11,446
There's more. 
Shall I bring them too?

1096
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:15,033
Parthe, you deal with him.

1097
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:16,702
Shinde, you're unbelievable.

1098
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,414
What is all this? What is it?

1099
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:34,136
What are you doing here?

1100
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:36,013
Chandrakant murdered

1101
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,140
I know. I know.

1102
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:53,697
Look here, Parthe.

1103
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:58,952
There are scratches but 
only this side of the carpet.

1104
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:05,292
Pull this thing. 
Take it out.

1105
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:09,004
Kabir, whoever stopped you 
from writing Zaraan Khan stories...

1106
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:10,506
...end up dead.

1107
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:12,382
Kabir, I am scared.

1108
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,529
Those who were 
blackmailing you are dead.

1109
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,741
I am so sorry this 
is happening because of me.

1110
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,828
You may be the reason but...

1111
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:47,000
...I know that you're not 
involved in it, Kabir.

1112
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:51,672
Who could be behind all this?

1113
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:02,099
Kabir, there's someone... 
There's someone in the house.

1114
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:04,685
There's no one.

1115
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,979
Zaraan Khan. 
Zaraan Khan is in the house.

1116
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:08,647
Zaraan Khan?

1117
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:12,651
- Suhana...there is... 
- There! There!

1118
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,448
Suhana, I'll be fine.

1119
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,272
Hey...

1120
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:51,481
- God! 
- Are you out of your mind?

1121
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:52,691
What are you doing?

1122
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:54,568
What's... What's happening here?

1123
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:55,986
- Here she comes. 
- Wait outside, Suhana.

1124
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,572
- What are you... 
- Not a word from you.

1125
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,200
First things first why 
didn't you two come to...

1126
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:03,702
...the Police Station 
to record your statements?

1127
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:05,621
- We did, Madam. 
- When?

1128
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:07,164
- We came... 
- When?

1129
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,416
We arrived at around 6:45 pm...

1130
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,126
...but we were told you were 
out with your team...

1131
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:12,419
...for an investigation.

1132
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:15,255
Where were you two hours ago?

1133
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:17,716
- In my room. 
- Did I ask you?

1134
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,427
Whenever you two are 
together in your room...

1135
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:22,304
...someone ends up dead outside.

1136
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:24,431
Will you tell us 
what happened, Madam?

1137
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:25,474
What happened?

1138
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:28,769
I've never even had to deal 
with pick-pocketers in my area.

1139
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:32,481
And now two murders are committed 
within twenty-four hours in my area...

1140
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:33,899
...and what happened?

1141
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,484
Nothing, ma'am.

1142
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,779
Just that Chandu the 
photographer has been murdered.

1143
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:40,280
What has happened?

1144
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:43,575
Don't talk amongst yourselves.

1145
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:47,788
First, tell me what is all this, 
this whole charade.

1146
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:50,123
This mask, and this painting, and 
that model sitting behind over there.

1147
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:51,250
What is all this junk?

1148
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,961
Junk? This is not junk, Madam. 
It's research.

1149
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:54,962
- Research. 
- Yes.

1150
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:55,796
What for?

1151
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,423
Ma'am, Kabir is 
actually a ghostwriter.

1152
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,926
He writes Zaraan Khan novels.

1153
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,553
Zaraan...

1154
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:07,808
You mean the detective novels?

1155
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,101
Yes.

1156
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,395
You are Zaraan Khan?

1157
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,688
Yes,

1158
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:15,816
I read your books. 
You write really well.

1159
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:17,526
I've read all your books.

1160
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,113
In all your stories there's 
always a particular murder plan.

1161
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:25,659
Zaraan Khan kills the criminals 
using their own weapons.

1162
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:29,746
And that's exactly how Ricky and 
Chandu have been murdered.

1163
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,712
I found these in Chandu's studio.

1164
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,173
Against you.

1165
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,926
Take a look. 
You too, madam.

1166
01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:46,096
You're looking really 
nice in these photographs.

1167
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:47,848
- Ma'am... 
- Wait.

1168
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,850
And don't you dare tell me that 
there is no connection whatsoever?

1169
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:50,851
Stop giving me a headache.

1170
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:51,810
Now without wasting 
any more of my time...

1171
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:55,022
...tell me what was your connection 
with Ricky and Chandu.

1172
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,858
Will you speak up or do 
I have to force it out of you?

1173
01:20:58,317 --> 01:20:59,526
They were blackmailing me.

1174
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:04,615
They found out that I was 
the ghostwriter of Zaraan Khan.

1175
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:07,201
Fantastic!

1176
01:21:07,326 --> 01:21:10,787
You yourself have admitted 
that they were blackmailing you.

1177
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,497
That's enough motive.

1178
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:15,626
They were blackmailing you, 
so you murdered them.

1179
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:20,255
Now I've a reason, 
a motive, and evidence against you.

1180
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,759
Madam, you are right and 
also wrong at the same time.

1181
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:25,344
How?

1182
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:27,638
Because I confessed 
on my blog today that...

1183
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:29,806
...I am the ghostwriter 
of Zaraan Khan.

1184
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:33,310
So when they have no 
reason to blackmail me...

1185
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:35,562
...I've no motive to 
commit these murders.

1186
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,148
Confession only takes 
the load off your chest...

1187
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,067
...not the suspicion 
from the suspect.

1188
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:41,276
Understand.

1189
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,907
Suhana, these aren't just 
our photographs, are they?

1190
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:48,325
Yeah.

1191
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,787
That's the local operator.

1192
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:55,040
I guess with his daughter's tutor.

1193
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:56,792
And this...

1194
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,628
That's Mr. 
Pankaj with the washerwoman.

1195
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:03,799
I've seen her before.

1196
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:07,553
Mrs. Mehta, with her driver.

1197
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:12,057
This towns real secularism is right 
here in these photographs, ma'am.

1198
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,852
These are cases of adultery 
and extra-marital affair,

1199
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,311
...we will deal with them.

1200
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,438
But what is your case? 
Murder!

1201
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:21,525
You're a murder suspect. 
Do you understand that?

1202
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,735
But I am not your only suspect.

1203
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:26,572
You've dozens of suspects 
here who were being blackmailed.

1204
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:29,491
So maybe someone else murdered them.

1205
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:30,951
Right.

1206
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:35,747
And I've already confessed, 
Madam, so stop bothering us.

1207
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,584
You see...

1208
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:42,296
I admit you're my 
favourite writer...

1209
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,465
...but right now you're 
also my favourite suspect.

1210
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,467
In a murder case.

1211
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:50,804
So you two better come 
down to the Police Station..

1212
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:52,764
...in the morning and record 
your statement.

1213
01:22:52,931 --> 01:22:54,349
Of course.

1214
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:10,115
Sorry.

1215
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:11,992
Sorry, sister.

1216
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,453
Have you lost your mind?

1217
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:15,954
What are you apologising for?

1218
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:20,918
You gave me information about 
this room. You're my informant.

1219
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:25,088
But our job here isn't done yet.

1220
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:29,510
Keep an eye on them and 
keep your mouth shut.

1221
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,345
Understood.

1222
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:39,019
My ghostwriting days 
for Zaraan Khan are over.

1223
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:42,105
It's time to celebrate.

1224
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,483
Yeah...

1225
01:23:56,954 --> 01:24:00,374
Suhana, I want to 
give you something today.

1226
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:12,344
I have never given these to anyone, 
they belonged to my Mother.

1227
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,056
They mean a lot to me.

1228
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,351
Thank you for being there for me.

1229
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:22,062
"Your eyes take my breath away."

1230
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:27,192
"There's nothing 
I can hide from you."

1231
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:33,574
"Your eyes take my breath away."

1232
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:36,451
"There's nothing 
I can hide from you."

1233
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:42,249
"You know all my secrets."

1234
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:45,169
"Blindly I wish to follow you..." 
"I will be there wherever you go"

1235
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,838
"...with my eyes closed."

1236
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:53,260
"I am like a puppet in your hands."

1237
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:58,974
"You're like my dawn, 
you're like my dusk."

1238
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:03,729
"You're my sunshine 
and my everything."

1239
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:07,566
"You mean the world to me."

1240
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:12,196
"You might not believe me..."

1241
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,908
"...but you're my saviour."

1242
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:22,998
"There's nothing more I want..."

1243
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:26,460
"There's nothing more I need..."

1244
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:30,631
"...but you, you're my saviour."

1245
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:35,093
"You might not believe me..."

1246
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:40,766
"...but you're my saviour."

1247
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:45,312
"You are my saviour."

1248
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:02,996
"I can gaze at you for hours."

1249
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:08,919
"With you, I feel alive."

1250
01:26:09,044 --> 01:26:14,466
"I yearn for you when we are apart."

1251
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:19,137
"Whenever I take a breath 
my eyes fill with tears."

1252
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:23,600
"I've no other place to go..."

1253
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:27,563
"...but you're my saviour."

1254
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:32,150
"You might not believe me..."

1255
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:37,823
"...but you're my saviour."

1256
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:41,827
"You are my saviour."

1257
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:46,498
"You might not believe me..."

1258
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:52,296
"...but you're my saviour."

1259
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:57,926
"You are my saviour."

1260
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:07,311
Mahek.

1261
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:13,483
Mahek.

1262
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:15,944
It's okay.

1263
01:27:16,737 --> 01:27:17,946
Mahek.

1264
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:34,796
Its just a bad dream.

1265
01:27:43,514 --> 01:27:45,140
It's alright.

1266
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:49,728
Who is Mahek?

1267
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,355
Did I take Mahek's name?

1268
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,986
Kabir, if we are 
going to be together,

1269
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:00,697
it's important you know about Mahek.

1270
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:06,787
We were not just sisters, 
we were best friends.

1271
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:12,459
And my Mum was an angel.

1272
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:16,463
God made Mums because 
he couldn't be everywhere.

1273
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:20,759
"Sometimes when we cry...

1274
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:23,846
"...it clears our vision."

1275
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:29,726
"just like through the clouds..."

1276
01:28:29,852 --> 01:28:32,980
"...the sun reveals a path for us."

1277
01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:37,693
"Don't ever be afraid to cry."

1278
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:42,030
"When you are down, hum this song."

1279
01:28:42,155 --> 01:28:46,493
"It's the tradition of life..."

1280
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:49,955
"...only after defeat 
comes victory."

1281
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:53,041
We had the most 
amazing time together.

1282
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:57,754
And she always said whatever 
boys can do girls can do too.

1283
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,798
It was the greatest time of my life.

1284
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:04,261
"It's the tradition of life..."

1285
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:09,349
"...only after defeat 
comes victory."

1286
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,701
Hello, girls. 
Look what I got you again.

1287
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:30,037
- Who is this for? 
- Mahek.

1288
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:32,831
- And this? 
- Suhana.

1289
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:34,708
And where is my gift?

1290
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,753
Anyway, how about a cup of tea?

1291
01:29:37,878 --> 01:29:39,046
- Yeah, sure. 
- Chocolate milk?

1292
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:41,381
- The icing on top. 
- My dad was an alcoholic.

1293
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:43,675
He was abusive.

1294
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:45,010
And had a doubting nature.

1295
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:46,762
Ready to mingle.

1296
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:48,931
- What's happening? 
- How are you, Raj?

1297
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:50,974
- Raj... 
- You were saying.

1298
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:53,310
Aditya Uncle was his friend.

1299
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,062
He used to look after us.

1300
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:56,063
I understand everything.

1301
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:57,356
It's not what you think, Raj.

1302
01:29:57,689 --> 01:29:58,774
Call me, Sir.

1303
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:00,275
You're my junior. 
Call me Sir.

1304
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:01,985
- Sir. 
- Sir.

1305
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:03,695
- Sir. 
- Now get out.

1306
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:05,072
Get lost.

1307
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:06,156
Raj.

1308
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:07,157
Get out.

1309
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,536
What are these?

1310
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:13,789
This lovely toys that this uncle.

1311
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,585
What the hell did he get for you?

1312
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:20,295
Give me that!

1313
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:21,672
Get out.

1314
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:27,594
Fights and arguments were common.

1315
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:30,597
But that day it got out of hand.

1316
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:33,058
We were playing 
hide and seek when...

1317
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:36,103
Daddy's back.

1318
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:06,967
Suhana. Sweet Suhana.

1319
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:10,012
Daddy has got a gift for you Suhana.

1320
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:12,556
Suhana.

1321
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:19,146
He kept looking for me.

1322
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:21,732
I hid inside the cupboard.

1323
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,318
- I didn't have the courage to come out. 
- Suhana.

1324
01:31:25,068 --> 01:31:26,653
I could see everything from inside.

1325
01:31:28,488 --> 01:31:34,369
Suhana...Papa is looking for you.

1326
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:40,459
I have been alone since that day.

1327
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:46,882
I started looking for happiness 
outside instead of within.

1328
01:31:47,883 --> 01:31:49,176
Then I met you...

1329
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:53,972
...and I haven't felt lonely since.

1330
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:56,308
You're the best thing 
that happened to me, Kabir?

1331
01:31:57,768 --> 01:31:59,645
And you're the best 
thing that happened to me.

1332
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:05,317
So much happened in your 
life and yet you keep smiling.

1333
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:09,863
I promise you, 
I will never break your trust.

1334
01:32:11,406 --> 01:32:15,702
And I'll give you enough 
love to heal all your wounds.

1335
01:33:51,048 --> 01:33:52,799
Kitty.

1336
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:02,893
Come here baba.

1337
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:35,008
Come here.

1338
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:43,934
Hi...

1339
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,353
Come here.

1340
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:40,490
Suhana. 
Suhana.

1341
01:35:45,454 --> 01:35:46,580
Suhana.

1342
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,207
Wake up...

1343
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:09,019
Suhana.

1344
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:23,158
"The pleasant journey 
and the beautiful weather."

1345
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:28,455
Ba****

1346
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,457
You betrayed me.

1347
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:33,210
I knew you were Zaraan Khan.

1348
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:36,797
It was you, I saw you kill Chandu.

1349
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:38,715
Suhana.

1350
01:36:42,553 --> 01:36:44,096
Suhana.

1351
01:36:51,103 --> 01:36:52,813
Suhana! Suhana!

1352
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:16,920
Help!

1353
01:37:19,715 --> 01:37:21,091
Stop!

1354
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:25,470
Help!

1355
01:38:08,805 --> 01:38:11,391
This was the face you saw? 
This face?

1356
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,229
You said you saw me 
killing Chandu in his shop.

1357
01:38:16,063 --> 01:38:17,231
Tell me.

1358
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:24,613
Did you see this face?

1359
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,744
Kabir, I am sorry.

1360
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:36,083
Kabir...

1361
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:39,920
I am definitely weird Suhana, 
but I am not a murderer.

1362
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:43,215
Sorry.

1363
01:38:43,549 --> 01:38:45,175
I am really sorry, Kabir.

1364
01:38:46,552 --> 01:38:49,930
I heard you talking 
to the Khan Brothers.

1365
01:38:51,598 --> 01:38:52,683
I was scared.

1366
01:38:54,309 --> 01:38:56,478
I didn't want you to 
commit another mistake so...

1367
01:38:56,728 --> 01:38:58,647
...I went to the photo studio and...

1368
01:38:58,814 --> 01:39:02,818
...I saw Zaraan Khan kill 
Chandu with my own eyes.

1369
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:07,948
And he threatened to 
kill you if I told anyone.

1370
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:09,700
I am really sorry.

1371
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,079
It's just that I don't understand, 
what is that room?

1372
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:15,956
What are all these disguises?

1373
01:39:16,331 --> 01:39:17,416
What do you do?

1374
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,251
Wait... Who did you see?

1375
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,961
Zaraan Khan!

1376
01:39:25,549 --> 01:39:28,844
He... He's a 50-year-old guy.

1377
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:31,597
I saw him. I saw him there.

1378
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:38,520
Suhana, I was going 
to tell you everything.

1379
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:42,816
But I didn't know whether you 
would be able to accept it or not.

1380
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:45,152
I am an impersonator, Suhana.

1381
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,654
I change guises and 
go to different places.

1382
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:50,449
I learned all this from my Father.

1383
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:52,743
He was an impersonator. 
A stage actor.

1384
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:54,786
Before I write anything...

1385
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:58,248
...I dress up like that character,

1386
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:01,710
I behave like him, 
try to look like him.

1387
01:40:01,835 --> 01:40:03,754
And then write the book.

1388
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:07,966
I go places where 
that character might go.

1389
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:11,803
I go to red-light areas, 
illegal breweries...

1390
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,847
...I even go to 
criminal's hangouts...

1391
01:40:13,972 --> 01:40:15,182
I go everywhere.

1392
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:16,517
And whoever has 
read my books they...

1393
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:19,353
...say the books are very thrilling.

1394
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:22,731
They feel like they are being 
transported into that fictional world.

1395
01:40:22,856 --> 01:40:25,776
I know... I know it's a bit 
strange, but I love it.

1396
01:40:32,282 --> 01:40:34,201
Okay, leave that.

1397
01:40:34,368 --> 01:40:37,704
Tell me about this guy who 
is calling himself Zaraan Khan.

1398
01:40:38,455 --> 01:40:41,333
He doesn't call himself that, Kabir. 
It was Zaraan Khan.

1399
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:42,334
I saw him.

1400
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:45,170
The anger, the style, his eyes...

1401
01:40:45,295 --> 01:40:46,505
It was him.

1402
01:40:47,214 --> 01:40:51,009
Suhana, I created Zaraan Khan, okay.

1403
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:55,806
He is a part of my imagination. 
He is not alive.

1404
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:57,683
Then how was he there, 
right in front of me?

1405
01:40:58,517 --> 01:40:59,768
Okay...

1406
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:03,063
Okay, fine. 
Can you recognise that man?

1407
01:41:03,188 --> 01:41:04,147
Yes.

1408
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:07,693
Then let's go to the Police 
Station and file a report.

1409
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:09,611
Suhana, we have to do this.

1410
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:10,821
I don't know.

1411
01:41:12,072 --> 01:41:14,408
We have to do this 
for your safety, okay.

1412
01:41:31,466 --> 01:41:33,051
Kabir, I don't know...

1413
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:44,646
Kabir, drive. 
Just drive, just drive.

1414
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:46,106
- What happened? 
- Just drive. Just...

1415
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:03,415
What happened, Suhana?

1416
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,501
That was Zaraan Khan 
outside the Police Station.

1417
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:06,919
That was Zaraan Khan.

1418
01:42:07,044 --> 01:42:09,046
Why didn't you tell me, Suhana?

1419
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:11,465
- I could've caught him. 
- He is dangerous, Kabir.

1420
01:42:11,715 --> 01:42:13,592
- No, we need to get out of here. 
- Who was it?

1421
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:15,093
We need to leave now?

1422
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:17,971
Okay, let's go.

1423
01:42:18,055 --> 01:42:19,932
We'll go and get ready and 
then I'll drop you at the hotel.

1424
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,149
You go inside and wait with Manju.

1425
01:42:29,316 --> 01:42:30,317
- Okay. 
- Kabir...

1426
01:42:30,442 --> 01:42:32,069
I'll make a quick visit 
to the Police Station.

1427
01:42:32,736 --> 01:42:34,530
Suhana, I'll be fine.

1428
01:42:34,696 --> 01:42:36,823
I'll be fine, trust me.

1429
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,325
Okay.

1430
01:42:48,252 --> 01:42:50,045
Suhana saw him.

1431
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:51,964
He just left 10 minutes ago.

1432
01:42:52,047 --> 01:42:53,549
He was some 50-year-old guy.

1433
01:42:53,715 --> 01:42:54,883
He had a beard.

1434
01:42:55,008 --> 01:42:56,969
And maybe he was wearing 
a black buttoned coat

1435
01:42:57,511 --> 01:42:59,972
What the....that pervert.

1436
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:02,850
I was going to charge 
him for molestation.

1437
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:05,310
- What do you mean? 
- He caught a female from behind.

1438
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,354
And was forcing her in his car.

1439
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:08,689
The crowd gathered around.

1440
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:11,859
Later he claimed he forgot 
his glasses and got confused.

1441
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:14,152
Even the girl was sweet.

1442
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,071
Local Panchgani girl.

1443
01:43:16,196 --> 01:43:18,031
She understood and 
took her complaint back.

1444
01:43:18,156 --> 01:43:19,700
Did you take down his information?

1445
01:43:20,826 --> 01:43:22,369
- Yes. 
- What?

1446
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:26,373
The man is a doctor from St. 
Paul's hospital, Bangalore.

1447
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:28,041
Okay.

1448
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:31,545
Dr. Rao.

1449
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,130
He's staying at Green Estate...

1450
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,174
What was the bungalow number?

1451
01:43:35,716 --> 01:43:36,675
Bungalow no. 4.

1452
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,178
Yeah...right. 
He's staying at bungalow no. 4.

1453
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,972
The guy made a fool of you.

1454
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:44,391
Who are you calling a fool?

1455
01:43:44,558 --> 01:43:47,561
Sir, he had a molestation 
charge against him.

1456
01:43:47,686 --> 01:43:50,731
He tried to kidnap someone 
and you just let him go.

1457
01:43:50,856 --> 01:43:53,317
The girl took her complaint back.

1458
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,653
What else could I 
have detained him for?

1459
01:43:56,778 --> 01:43:59,573
Even your girlfriend's crazy? 
She is stupid.

1460
01:43:59,865 --> 01:44:03,076
She saw him. 
She saw that man kill Chandu.

1461
01:44:03,243 --> 01:44:04,786
And yet she didn't inform us.

1462
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:06,330
Nonsense...

1463
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:08,248
- Go away. Leave... 
- Okay, fine.

1464
01:44:08,415 --> 01:44:10,417
Give me your Madam's number, 
I'll talk to her.

1465
01:44:10,584 --> 01:44:11,960
Give him Madam's number.

1466
01:44:13,128 --> 01:44:14,713
- Come on. 
- Go.

1467
01:44:17,549 --> 01:44:19,760
Please, don't make excuses.

1468
01:44:20,385 --> 01:44:24,640
Since you got here you have 
hardly been reporting for your job.

1469
01:44:24,765 --> 01:44:26,266
I am really sorry.

1470
01:44:27,226 --> 01:44:29,394
- Will you do me a small favour? 
- Yes.

1471
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:31,230
Here is a list of all the guests...

1472
01:44:31,396 --> 01:44:32,856
...you just need to enter 
them in the ledger, okay.

1473
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:34,358
- Fine. 
- I'll just freshen up...

1474
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,817
...and be right back.

1475
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:45,577
Suhana!

1476
01:44:46,828 --> 01:44:49,164
I saw you outside 
the Police Station.

1477
01:44:49,957 --> 01:44:51,750
You didn't understand my warning?

1478
01:44:54,127 --> 01:44:57,464
Even the Police cannot save you two.

1479
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:02,970
Suhana, those children 
who don't listen...

1480
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:07,599
...don't live for too long.

1481
01:45:08,892 --> 01:45:10,561
Please. Please. Please.

1482
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:21,780
Suhana!

1483
01:45:36,211 --> 01:45:37,462
Suhana!

1484
01:45:37,754 --> 01:45:39,798
Suhana! What happened?

1485
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:45,345
What happened?

1486
01:45:46,638 --> 01:45:48,140
Zaraan was here.

1487
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:51,310
Suhana, 
we're going to get him, okay.

1488
01:45:52,686 --> 01:45:54,938
The Police know who 
he is and where he lives.

1489
01:45:55,355 --> 01:45:56,440
Okay.

1490
01:45:59,109 --> 01:46:00,611
It's okay.

1491
01:46:05,032 --> 01:46:06,867
Hi, Charmer.

1492
01:46:07,659 --> 01:46:08,785
See who's here.

1493
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:10,204
Come here.

1494
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,374
Don't worry.

1495
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:16,502
You'll be fine here.

1496
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,198
Hello. St. Paul's Hospital?

1497
01:46:46,406 --> 01:46:47,574
(Nurse replies in Kannada)

1498
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:50,285
Hello. Kannada no speak.

1499
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:51,495
Hindi? English?

1500
01:46:51,578 --> 01:46:53,705
English.

1501
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:54,873
Little-Little.

1502
01:46:54,998 --> 01:46:57,876
This is Dr. 
Kapoor, I'm calling from Bombay.

1503
01:46:58,794 --> 01:47:01,755
And I need to speak to Dr. 
Rao very, very urgently, please.

1504
01:47:01,964 --> 01:47:03,841
Rao.

1505
01:47:03,966 --> 01:47:05,342
The patient ran away.

1506
01:47:06,802 --> 01:47:08,512
Patient run away from the hospital?

1507
01:47:08,595 --> 01:47:10,097
Not just hospital.

1508
01:47:10,222 --> 01:47:12,432
It's asylum.

1509
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:14,852
Please Dr. Rao you contact.

1510
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:26,697
Hello, Inspector Trupti Sonawane.

1511
01:47:26,822 --> 01:47:28,448
I can't take your call right now.

1512
01:47:28,574 --> 01:47:30,868
Leave your message after the beep. 
Jai Hind.

1513
01:47:31,034 --> 01:47:34,329
Ma'am, this is Kabir 
Kapoor speaking.

1514
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:40,419
I think I've solved 
Ricky and Chandu's murder.

1515
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:43,130
There is a patient...

1516
01:47:43,839 --> 01:47:46,383
...who escaped from Bangalore's St. 
Paul's asylum.

1517
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:50,012
He is very dangerous. 
Please call me back urgently.

1518
01:47:56,226 --> 01:47:58,353
What is the bungalow number?

1519
01:47:58,729 --> 01:47:59,730
Bungalow no. 4.

1520
01:47:59,855 --> 01:48:02,566
Yes, he's staying at bungalow no. 4.

1521
01:48:06,195 --> 01:48:07,905
So sorry, did I wake you up?

1522
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:12,511
Hey you, how did you get inside?

1523
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:14,721
- What do you want? 
- Who lives here?

1524
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:15,973
This bungalow is empty.

1525
01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:17,099
The owners stay abroad.

1526
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:19,726
- Whose luggage is on the bed? 
- No, Sir.

1527
01:49:19,893 --> 01:49:21,687
I rent the place to tourists.

1528
01:49:21,812 --> 01:49:23,438
I rent the place to tourists.

1529
01:49:23,564 --> 01:49:25,357
I rented the place 
to a tourist recently.

1530
01:49:25,482 --> 01:49:26,441
Where is the key?

1531
01:49:26,567 --> 01:49:28,735
I have a spare key at home. 
I have a spare key at home.

1532
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:29,570
Go get the keys.

1533
01:49:29,736 --> 01:49:31,363
I'll be back in 15 minutes 
before it gets dark.

1534
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:33,031
I'll be right back. 
I'll be right back, Sir.

1535
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:34,491
Run away.

1536
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:51,383
Suhana.

1537
01:49:58,182 --> 01:49:59,683
Suhana.

1538
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:05,189
Suhana.

1539
01:50:05,564 --> 01:50:07,232
Suhana.

1540
01:53:04,117 --> 01:53:05,536
Kabir.

1541
01:53:17,548 --> 01:53:18,882
Hello, Bindiya.

1542
01:53:18,966 --> 01:53:21,260
Kabir. Kabir, he's in the house.

1543
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:22,886
I am coming, Suhana.

1544
01:53:44,324 --> 01:53:46,159
No. No.

1545
01:53:47,244 --> 01:53:49,162
Sorry. 
Sorry.

1546
01:53:49,288 --> 01:53:50,455
Please...

1547
01:53:57,546 --> 01:53:58,922
Suhana.

1548
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:01,008
Suhana.

1549
01:54:01,383 --> 01:54:02,801
Suhana.

1550
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:06,930
Suhana.

1551
01:54:08,307 --> 01:54:09,600
Charmer.

1552
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:11,560
Suhana. 
Suhana.

1553
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:20,652
Everything will be alright.

1554
01:54:24,114 --> 01:54:25,324
Charmer.

1555
01:54:25,532 --> 01:54:26,742
Charmer.

1556
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:38,295
So according to you, Mr. Kapoor...

1557
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:42,674
...the lunatic who escaped 
from St. Paul's is the culprit.

1558
01:54:42,799 --> 01:54:44,301
- Yes. Absolutely. 
- Will he be fine?

1559
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:48,347
And he's the same lunatic 
who killed Chandu and Ricky.

1560
01:54:48,805 --> 01:54:52,184
Because they were doing illegal 
activities, and they were evil.

1561
01:54:52,267 --> 01:54:54,770
They were stopping you 
from writing Zaraan Khan.

1562
01:54:55,395 --> 01:54:57,231
- Yes. 
- Great.

1563
01:54:57,523 --> 01:55:00,526
Look madam, I know it 
sounds strange but please...

1564
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:03,070
Please, believe me.

1565
01:55:03,195 --> 01:55:05,906
I've done a lot of research 
on things like this for my book.

1566
01:55:06,406 --> 01:55:09,535
This man can be a 
patient of schizophrenia.

1567
01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:12,913
Or maybe he has a split 
personality disorder.

1568
01:55:13,288 --> 01:55:15,541
Such people are delusional, 
they hallucinate.

1569
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:17,709
Sometimes they can also get violent.

1570
01:55:17,918 --> 01:55:19,336
Yes, I know.

1571
01:55:19,461 --> 01:55:21,922
- So? 
- So do something.

1572
01:55:22,047 --> 01:55:23,757
What do you think we are doing? 
Nothing?

1573
01:55:23,882 --> 01:55:25,175
That's not what I am saying.

1574
01:55:25,259 --> 01:55:27,511
Fine, you tell us 
what we should be doing.

1575
01:55:27,636 --> 01:55:30,097
- Come on, tell us. 
- CCTV footage.

1576
01:55:30,222 --> 01:55:31,306
From where?

1577
01:55:31,431 --> 01:55:34,476
Madam, that man attacked 
Suhana at The Grand Hotel.

1578
01:55:36,812 --> 01:55:38,105
Huh?

1579
01:55:38,564 --> 01:55:39,565
Someone attacked you?

1580
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,567
- Yes, it's on CCTV . 
- One minute.

1581
01:55:41,942 --> 01:55:43,652
- Were you attacked in the hotel? 
- Yes, Madam.

1582
01:55:43,944 --> 01:55:46,363
Why didn't you tell us 
earlier that you were attacked?

1583
01:55:46,488 --> 01:55:48,031
Ma'am, CCTV footage. 
Will that be enough?

1584
01:55:49,074 --> 01:55:50,325
Let's go.

1585
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:52,494
Yes.

1586
01:55:55,289 --> 01:55:56,206
Yes.

1587
01:55:56,331 --> 01:55:58,959
I want to see 
yesterday's CCTV footage.

1588
01:55:59,126 --> 01:56:00,377
Yes.

1589
01:56:00,502 --> 01:56:02,504
- But, ma'am... 
- Do it.

1590
01:56:05,632 --> 01:56:07,426
Left-click. Left-click, Manju.

1591
01:56:07,551 --> 01:56:08,969
Left...

1592
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,971
- He's saying left. 
- Manju, left-click...

1593
01:56:11,138 --> 01:56:12,723
Ma'am, can I do it, please?

1594
01:56:12,973 --> 01:56:14,308
Come. 
Get up.

1595
01:56:14,808 --> 01:56:16,310
Come.

1596
01:56:19,688 --> 01:56:21,148
Yes, that's the one.

1597
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:22,941
That's the same chair.

1598
01:56:24,776 --> 01:56:26,820
But the face isn't visible here.

1599
01:56:26,945 --> 01:56:28,238
Frontal...

1600
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:30,324
Frontal camera... 
Show me this camera.

1601
01:56:30,532 --> 01:56:31,783
Which one is this camera?

1602
01:56:31,909 --> 01:56:33,660
Actually, 
ma'am, that camera isn't working.

1603
01:56:34,369 --> 01:56:38,290
- We complained about it, but... 
- Are you all stupid?

1604
01:56:39,082 --> 01:56:41,251
Your hotel cameras aren't working.

1605
01:56:42,544 --> 01:56:44,129
- Jai Hind, madam. 
- Jai Hind, Khaade.

1606
01:56:44,171 --> 01:56:48,634
I found Suhana Madam's 
pictures and some books...

1607
01:56:48,842 --> 01:56:50,594
Called Kadambarya.

1608
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:53,180
Don't touch a single thing, Khaade. 
I am reaching in 10 minutes.

1609
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:55,140
- Yes, madam. 
- Jai Hind.

1610
01:56:57,017 --> 01:56:59,853
Garden, restaurant, 
swimming pool, entrance.

1611
01:56:59,978 --> 01:57:02,189
I want you to show 
him all the CCTV footage.

1612
01:57:02,356 --> 01:57:03,482
Co-operate with him.

1613
01:57:03,774 --> 01:57:05,400
I'll be back in 20-minutes.

1614
01:57:08,195 --> 01:57:10,322
You'll be doing time for a while.

1615
01:57:10,447 --> 01:57:11,365
Please, sir.

1616
01:57:11,532 --> 01:57:13,534
Do you know what I think... 
Kabir and that girl are...

1617
01:57:13,825 --> 01:57:15,869
...together playing 
some kind of game.

1618
01:57:15,994 --> 01:57:17,329
- Are they playing games? 
- Yes.

1619
01:57:17,454 --> 01:57:19,581
Then together we'll 
play games with them.

1620
01:57:24,294 --> 01:57:25,462
Why is there a power cut?

1621
01:57:26,004 --> 01:57:27,130
Take a look.

1622
01:57:55,492 --> 01:57:56,660
What happened?

1623
01:57:57,035 --> 01:57:59,454
Tukaram. Parthe.

1624
01:57:59,997 --> 01:58:02,958
Tukaram. Parthe.

1625
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:06,003
Tukaram.

1626
01:58:08,005 --> 01:58:09,798
Sheikh. 
Sheikh.

1627
01:58:09,923 --> 01:58:11,383
What happened, Sheikh?

1628
01:58:11,842 --> 01:58:13,677
Speak up. 
Tell me what happened, Sheikh.

1629
01:58:13,802 --> 01:58:14,720
Tell me.

1630
01:58:14,845 --> 01:58:16,597
- He is here. 
- What happened, Sheikh?

1631
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:28,400
- Yes, Sheikh. 
- The murderer is here.

1632
01:58:28,525 --> 01:58:30,110
Don't worry, I am coming.

1633
01:58:30,277 --> 01:58:32,362
I can see Suhana but not that man.

1634
01:58:32,529 --> 01:58:33,697
Where is the other camera?

1635
01:58:33,822 --> 01:58:35,866
- Where is the other camera? 
- Check-in this file.

1636
01:58:36,992 --> 01:58:39,286
Sister. Sister. Sister.

1637
01:58:39,453 --> 01:58:40,996
Bindiya, what happened?

1638
01:58:42,206 --> 01:58:43,624
That murderer is in my house.

1639
01:58:46,543 --> 01:58:47,920
Sister. Sister. Sister.

1640
01:58:48,045 --> 01:58:50,214
- Let me go. Please let me go. 
- No...

1641
01:58:50,464 --> 01:58:51,507
Inspector.

1642
01:58:51,632 --> 01:58:54,259
- Let the girl go. 
- Lower your gun.

1643
01:58:54,426 --> 01:58:55,552
Let her go.

1644
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:56,553
I said lower your gun.

1645
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:58,013
Don't try to be over-smart. 
Let her go.

1646
01:58:58,138 --> 01:58:58,847
You'll die in vain.

1647
01:58:58,972 --> 01:58:59,932
I am a doctor. 
You can check...

1648
01:59:00,057 --> 01:59:01,308
Let her go.

1649
01:59:02,768 --> 01:59:04,019
Nothing happened, 
the bullet just grazed you.

1650
01:59:04,144 --> 01:59:05,270
- Inspector. 
- It's nothing.

1651
01:59:05,395 --> 01:59:07,689
He's an escaped lunatic.

1652
01:59:23,956 --> 01:59:25,249
Suhana.

1653
01:59:31,547 --> 01:59:34,049
You cannot escape this time, 
Zaraan Khan.

1654
01:59:35,551 --> 01:59:36,426
Suhana.

1655
01:59:36,552 --> 01:59:38,846
No, no... 
Kabir. Move.

1656
01:59:39,054 --> 01:59:40,889
He is Zaraan Khan. He will kill you.

1657
01:59:41,014 --> 01:59:42,850
- Move! 
- Suhana. Suhana.

1658
01:59:42,975 --> 01:59:44,476
I went to the hotel.

1659
01:59:44,601 --> 01:59:49,565
I checked all the CCTV footage, 
Suhana, but there was no one there.

1660
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:52,192
You were alone. 
You were all alone.

1661
01:59:54,152 --> 01:59:56,488
No, the camera must 
be broken, Kabir.

1662
01:59:56,905 --> 01:59:59,032
He was standing in front of me. 
Kabir, move.

1663
01:59:59,157 --> 02:00:00,117
Suhana. Suhana.

1664
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:02,703
I called St. Paul's again.

1665
02:00:04,705 --> 02:00:06,957
I asked them for information 
about the patient.

1666
02:00:07,165 --> 02:00:08,458
And they told me that the escaped 
patient was a female, Suhana.

1667
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:10,794
Suhana, I've checked their website.

1668
02:00:12,379 --> 02:00:16,717
The clothes you were wearing 
when you got down from the truck...

1669
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:19,511
...was the uniform of St. 
Paul's patients.

1670
02:00:20,804 --> 02:00:22,014
He is a doctor.

1671
02:00:22,598 --> 02:00:24,975
Dr. Rao. Your doctor.

1672
02:00:25,726 --> 02:00:26,810
Suhana.

1673
02:00:26,935 --> 02:00:31,523
What happened with Mahek 
and your Mother Vidya was terrible.

1674
02:00:40,741 --> 02:00:44,661
But you only remember 
what happened to them.

1675
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:47,831
You don't remember what 
happened afterwards.

1676
02:00:48,665 --> 02:00:50,125
Try to remember, dear.

1677
02:01:00,135 --> 02:01:04,848
Look, forgetting painful memories...

1678
02:01:05,098 --> 02:01:08,977
...and shutting them 
off like a computer...

1679
02:01:09,645 --> 02:01:13,106
...is your coping 
mechanism, that's all.

1680
02:01:13,232 --> 02:01:15,400
None of this is your fault, dear.

1681
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:19,279
Thoughts, feelings, emotions,

1682
02:01:19,655 --> 02:01:22,908
have no connection 
with actions whatsoever.

1683
02:01:23,242 --> 02:01:25,452
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

1684
02:01:25,953 --> 02:01:27,412
Remember Bangalore.

1685
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,082
St. Paul's hospital. Your room.

1686
02:01:30,582 --> 02:01:32,417
Dr. Uma. Rahim Uncle.

1687
02:01:32,751 --> 02:01:35,045
Sister Julie. Your best friend.

1688
02:01:37,214 --> 02:01:41,218
Together we made you better.

1689
02:01:41,844 --> 02:01:43,178
Remember.

1690
02:01:43,387 --> 02:01:46,557
One day you were sitting 
in the library and...

1691
02:01:46,682 --> 02:01:50,811
...and that new peon 
Raju tried to mistreat you.

1692
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:33,353
The hospital staff 
saw a truck leave.

1693
02:02:33,937 --> 02:02:36,607
I came here looking for you.

1694
02:02:37,065 --> 02:02:38,984
Seeing you outside 
the Police Station...

1695
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:42,654
...I got the information on his 
vehicle and came to Kabir's house.

1696
02:02:44,072 --> 02:02:46,783
Raju always had wrong 
intentions for me.

1697
02:02:46,992 --> 02:02:50,037
But do you know that 
Raju's been arrested?

1698
02:02:50,245 --> 02:02:51,872
He will never bother you again.

1699
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:53,498
You are safe now.

1700
02:02:53,749 --> 02:02:55,125
I don't believe you.

1701
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:57,127
I have always been wronged.

1702
02:02:57,753 --> 02:03:01,006
You are Zaraan Khan, 
not my Dr. Uncle.

1703
02:03:01,215 --> 02:03:05,511
No, Suhana. 
You know that is not the truth.

1704
02:03:06,136 --> 02:03:07,888
I had explained this to you.

1705
02:03:08,013 --> 02:03:11,391
If you keep taking your medicines 
then things will stay in control.

1706
02:03:11,725 --> 02:03:13,018
But you haven't taken...

1707
02:03:13,143 --> 02:03:15,062
...your Risperidone tablets for 
the past couple of days.

1708
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,981
You haven't, have you?

1709
02:03:20,067 --> 02:03:21,860
Since you haven't been 
taken your medication...

1710
02:03:21,985 --> 02:03:27,074
...everything that you read 
or hear becomes a reality for you.

1711
02:03:27,241 --> 02:03:29,993
You cannot differentiate 
between truth and imagination.

1712
02:03:30,786 --> 02:03:32,079
Remember I had explained it to you.

1713
02:03:32,579 --> 02:03:33,872
Alters.

1714
02:03:34,039 --> 02:03:35,499
Another character.

1715
02:03:35,707 --> 02:03:36,959
And then switching.

1716
02:03:37,584 --> 02:03:40,295
This time you've 
imagined Zaraan Khan.

1717
02:03:41,964 --> 02:03:45,300
One moment you're Suhana, 
next moment you're Zaraan Khan.

1718
02:03:46,385 --> 02:03:49,096
And you intentionally 
forget what you don't want.

1719
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:52,599
No. You are Zaraan Khan.

1720
02:03:52,766 --> 02:03:54,226
Not my Doctor Uncle.

1721
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:56,103
Try to remember...

1722
02:03:57,437 --> 02:03:59,565
...what have you done 
in the past couple of days.

1723
02:03:59,690 --> 02:04:01,400
What do you mean, what I did?

1724
02:04:01,984 --> 02:04:07,114
That Ricky and Chandu were being 
unfair and Zaraan Khan killed them.

1725
02:04:07,698 --> 02:04:10,033
They were going to ruin Kabir.

1726
02:04:10,367 --> 02:04:13,036
We even offered them a deal.

1727
02:04:13,161 --> 02:04:17,332
But they double-crossed us 
and went to the Police Station.

1728
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:45,360
Give you the pictures? Why?

1729
02:04:45,736 --> 02:04:47,779
We first take pictures of the girl...

1730
02:04:47,905 --> 02:04:49,072
...and then we take her money.

1731
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:50,657
But never give the pictures.

1732
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:58,290
Zaraan does not spare evil people.

1733
02:04:58,624 --> 02:05:00,459
They deserved it.

1734
02:05:00,667 --> 02:05:05,380
Suhana, give me the gun.

1735
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:09,676
Look, we'll start 
your medications again.

1736
02:05:10,427 --> 02:05:12,095
Everything will be fine, dear.

1737
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:15,474
- Give it. Give it back. 
- I don't want to go anywhere.

1738
02:05:16,433 --> 02:05:19,353
Why did you call the asylum, Kabir?

1739
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:23,440
Even you want me to 
go back to the hospital?

1740
02:05:23,524 --> 02:05:24,816
Sorry.

1741
02:05:25,526 --> 02:05:27,110
Put the gun down.

1742
02:05:27,277 --> 02:05:30,697
The constables posted 
for my security...

1743
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:33,700
...didn't believe us either, Kabir.

1744
02:05:33,825 --> 02:05:35,911
No...I doubt that Kabir.

1745
02:05:36,119 --> 02:05:38,413
These famous people are ba****

1746
02:05:50,551 --> 02:05:52,553
Even Charmer was with them.

1747
02:05:57,724 --> 02:06:01,103
Suhana. Let's go back, dear.

1748
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,980
Let me help you.

1749
02:06:03,146 --> 02:06:04,481
I don't want anyone's help.

1750
02:06:04,565 --> 02:06:06,692
Suhana. Suhana. It's okay.

1751
02:06:07,067 --> 02:06:10,863
Why are you punishing 
me for my father's crimes?

1752
02:06:11,321 --> 02:06:12,948
I hate you!

1753
02:06:13,156 --> 02:06:16,577
We all want the best for you, 
Suhana.

1754
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:18,996
No one cares about me.

1755
02:06:19,121 --> 02:06:21,039
Suhana, please.

1756
02:06:21,248 --> 02:06:23,417
Suhana...

1757
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:26,587
You'll be cured 
if you go back. Okay.

1758
02:06:30,465 --> 02:06:33,760
No. I can't go back.

1759
02:06:34,595 --> 02:06:37,598
I'll just be another 
experiment there.

1760
02:06:38,765 --> 02:06:40,309
No...

1761
02:06:41,268 --> 02:06:44,396
Suhana, please. 
Please put the gun down, please.

1762
02:06:48,775 --> 02:06:50,444
Suhana!

1763
02:07:27,022 --> 02:07:29,566
I won't let our story end this way.

1764
02:07:30,108 --> 02:07:34,488
Call it fate, or coincidence, but...

1765
02:07:34,613 --> 02:07:38,408
...you came into my life 
when I was completely alone.

1766
02:07:40,118 --> 02:07:41,662
How can I leave you alone?

1767
02:07:44,248 --> 02:07:50,045
And if you want to kill yourself 
then you must kill me first.

1768
02:07:51,421 --> 02:07:55,968
Because...I can't live 
without you anyway.

1769
02:07:58,345 --> 02:08:01,473
Suhana, if you trust my 
love then please put the gun down.

1770
02:08:03,392 --> 02:08:05,060
Please put the gun down.

1771
02:08:10,148 --> 02:08:12,192
Please put the gun down.

1772
02:08:14,194 --> 02:08:16,405
Please put the gun down.

1773
02:08:41,513 --> 02:08:42,973
Kabir has finished 
writing his second book...

1774
02:08:43,182 --> 02:08:44,641
Do It We Can.

1775
02:08:44,725 --> 02:08:47,561
And kept his promise 
to the publisher.

1776
02:08:47,728 --> 02:08:49,146
Partners in Crime.

1777
02:08:49,646 --> 02:08:50,981
Together forever.

1778
02:08:51,231 --> 02:08:53,025
They did what they wanted.

1779
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:57,279
Kabir bought a house 
near Suhana's hospital.

1780
02:08:58,322 --> 02:09:01,867
Every morning he would arrive 
at 8am before the gates would open...

1781
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,119
...and he would stay 
with her till evening.

1782
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:06,872
He would return home in the evening...

1783
02:09:07,122 --> 02:09:09,833
...only to eagerly 
wait for the morning

1784
02:09:10,042 --> 02:09:12,002
so he could see Suhana again.

1785
02:09:12,127 --> 02:09:14,463
They knew this was their future.

1786
02:09:15,214 --> 02:09:16,757
But they were happy.

1787
02:09:17,466 --> 02:09:20,177
Their love had bore fruit.

1788
02:09:20,511 --> 02:09:23,639
Together...forever.

1789
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:36,193
What happened? 
What are you thinking?

1790
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:47,704
I am happy.

1791
02:09:48,205 --> 02:09:53,210
There's something to look 
after Suhana and understand her.

1792
02:09:54,336 --> 02:09:57,881
Even the judge accepted 
Suhana and Kabir's appeal.

1793
02:09:58,799 --> 02:10:00,592
Under IPC Section 84...

1794
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:04,388
...if the patient's mental condition 
is unstable while committing a crime.

1795
02:10:04,513 --> 02:10:06,306
...then he cannot be proven guilty.

1796
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:10,060
And you knew that doctor. 
Because you testified for them.

1797
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:15,274
Suhana's tests are due next week.

1798
02:10:16,483 --> 02:10:20,988
If all goes well then Kabir 
can take her out of the campus.

1799
02:10:21,488 --> 02:10:24,491
We slowly want to 
integrate her into society.

1800
02:10:25,158 --> 02:10:26,827
I am sure we'll do it.

1801
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:30,747
I am sorry, Doctor, 
but this case isn't over for me yet.

1802
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:34,418
I see...

1803
02:10:34,543 --> 02:10:39,423
I read Suhana's medical 
records and even statements.

1804
02:10:39,965 --> 02:10:43,302
Everything that Suhana 
said to you and Dr. Suhana.

1805
02:10:43,844 --> 02:10:45,971
Kabir told Suhana 
that he likes to roam...

1806
02:10:46,096 --> 02:10:49,641
...the city in Zaraan Khan's guise.

1807
02:10:50,017 --> 02:10:51,393
Who does that?

1808
02:10:51,643 --> 02:10:54,438
Doctor, I've read Zaraan 
Khan's books myself.

1809
02:10:59,193 --> 02:11:03,405
And there's a mention of 
these incidents in those books.

1810
02:11:05,949 --> 02:11:09,244
I believe that Kabir is Zaraan Khan.

1811
02:11:10,162 --> 02:11:11,413
Yes.

1812
02:11:11,663 --> 02:11:15,834
I am only confused about one 
thing that Kabir, or Zaraan Khan...

1813
02:11:15,959 --> 02:11:18,003
...plans the murders first 
and then writes his stories.

1814
02:11:18,128 --> 02:11:20,881
Or does he plan his murder 
strategies in his stories

1815
02:11:21,048 --> 02:11:22,549
and then commit them?

1816
02:11:22,883 --> 02:11:24,176
You're getting my point?

1817
02:11:25,219 --> 02:11:28,013
If Suhana hadn't murdered 
Ricky and Chandu...

1818
02:11:28,138 --> 02:11:31,308
...then I can guarantee that Kabir,

1819
02:11:31,433 --> 02:11:33,352
who I think is Zaraan Khan...

1820
02:11:33,477 --> 02:11:35,604
...would have killed Ricky and Chandu.

1821
02:11:35,896 --> 02:11:37,356
Trust me, Doctor.

1822
02:11:37,814 --> 02:11:38,857
They are dangerous.

1823
02:11:38,982 --> 02:11:41,860
And the most dangerous 
part is yet to come.

1824
02:11:41,985 --> 02:11:43,070
The case has been closed.

1825
02:11:43,195 --> 02:11:46,073
According to you, 
Suhana will go out of the campus.

1826
02:11:46,198 --> 02:11:48,700
They will both live under 
one roof happily ever after.

1827
02:11:48,825 --> 02:11:52,746
And then Kabir and Suhana together 
will become even more dangerous.

1828
02:11:52,871 --> 02:11:54,289
You understand what I am saying.

1829
02:11:55,832 --> 02:11:59,419
Inspector, Kabir writes fiction.

1830
02:11:59,545 --> 02:12:00,712
Pulp fiction.

1831
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:02,673
I think you've started taking...

1832
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,843
...these things a little too 
seriously like Suhana.

1833
02:12:05,926 --> 02:12:07,094
Be careful.

1834
02:12:09,805 --> 02:12:11,014
Bye.

1835
02:12:11,557 --> 02:12:13,350
Don't be so keen 
to say goodbye, Doctor.

1836
02:12:15,269 --> 02:12:19,106
I feel we'll be seeing 
each other pretty soon.

1837
02:12:19,731 --> 02:12:21,859
Not for my mental health...

1838
02:12:23,861 --> 02:12:25,279
For Suhana.

1839
02:12:28,115 --> 02:12:32,119
Okay. Goodbye for now then.

1840
02:12:35,205 --> 02:12:36,832
Jai Hind.

1841
02:13:13,744 --> 02:13:15,913
If you truly want to 
escape this reality.

1842
02:13:15,996 --> 02:13:18,165
You have do is open a 
book and your imagination.

1843
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:22,711
Books give a soul to the universe,

1844
02:13:23,003 --> 02:13:25,672
...wings to mind, flight 
to the imagination.

1845
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:27,799
And life to every thing.

1846
02:13:27,925 --> 02:13:31,678
Imagination is more 
important than knowledge.

1847
02:13:31,762 --> 02:13:36,683
For knowledge is limited to all 
we now know and understand.

1848
02:13:36,975 --> 02:13:38,393
While imagination embraces...

1849
02:13:38,519 --> 02:13:40,521
...the entire world and all there 
will be to know and understand.

1850
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:42,898
"Face yourself, know your worth."

1851
02:13:43,023 --> 02:13:44,900
"Touch the sky with your courage."

1852
02:13:45,025 --> 02:13:47,152
You have it in you, you're a fighter."

1853
02:13:47,277 --> 02:13:49,571
"Even god is in awe of you."

1854
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,907
"This is your war, your battlefield."

1855
02:13:52,032 --> 02:13:53,909
"Winning or losing, nothing 
to hold you back."

1856
02:13:54,117 --> 02:13:56,161
"Keep treading ahead, keep praying."

1857
02:13:56,286 --> 02:13:58,622
"Don't ever hold back your desires."

1858
02:13:58,747 --> 02:14:00,874
"These are your decisions, your dream."

1859
02:14:00,999 --> 02:14:03,168
"This is your duty, so why pine for it."

1860
02:14:03,293 --> 02:14:07,506
"Don't let the fire in your heart 
and mind burn down or deviatel."

1861
02:14:07,631 --> 02:14:09,842
"Your paths will unravel itself."

1862
02:14:10,008 --> 02:14:12,177
"When you understand what you're doing."

1863
02:14:12,302 --> 02:14:14,429
"Every wish you make to god will come true."

1864
02:14:14,555 --> 02:14:16,723
"You'll be the winner, you'll defeat yourself."

1865
02:14:16,849 --> 02:14:18,892
"Rise up don't think how."

1866
02:14:18,976 --> 02:14:21,061
"Rise up make your dreams come true."

1867
02:14:21,228 --> 02:14:23,355
"Rise up and give your best effort."

1868
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:25,566
"Rise up and conquer this world."

1869
02:14:25,691 --> 02:14:27,860
"Rise up don't think how."

1870
02:14:27,985 --> 02:14:30,070
"Rise up make your dreams come true."

1871
02:14:30,237 --> 02:14:32,364
"Rise up and give your best effort."

1872
02:14:32,447 --> 02:14:35,033
"Rise up and conquer this world."

1873
02:15:05,981 --> 02:15:08,108
"Face yourself, know your worth."

1874
02:15:08,275 --> 02:15:10,402
"Touch the sky with your courage."

1875
02:15:10,527 --> 02:15:12,654
You have it in you, you're a fighter."

1876
02:15:12,779 --> 02:15:14,907
"Even god is in awe of you."

1877
02:15:15,032 --> 02:15:17,242
"This is your war, your battlefield."

1878
02:15:17,367 --> 02:15:19,536
"Winning or losing, nothing 
to hold you back."

1879
02:15:19,661 --> 02:15:21,705
"Keep treading ahead, keep praying."

1880
02:15:21,788 --> 02:15:23,916
"Don't ever hold back your desires."

1881
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:26,418
"These are your decisions, your dream."

1882
02:15:26,543 --> 02:15:28,629
"This is your duty, so why pine for it."

1883
02:15:28,754 --> 02:15:32,966
"Don't let the fire in your heart 
and mind burn down or deviatel."

1884
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:35,302
"Your paths will unravel itself."

1885
02:15:35,469 --> 02:15:37,679
"When you understand what you're doing."

1886
02:15:37,804 --> 02:15:39,890
"Every wish you make to god will come true."

1887
02:15:40,057 --> 02:15:42,142
"You'll be the winner, you'll defeat yourself."

1888
02:15:42,267 --> 02:15:44,394
"Rise up don't think how."

1889
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,647
"Rise up make your dreams come true."

1890
02:15:46,772 --> 02:15:48,774
"Rise up and give your best effort."

1891
02:15:48,899 --> 02:15:51,026
"Rise up and conquer this world."

1892
02:15:51,151 --> 02:15:53,320
"Rise up don't think how."

1893
02:15:53,487 --> 02:15:55,572
"Rise up make your dreams come true."

1894
02:15:55,697 --> 02:15:57,824
"Rise up and give your best effort."

1895
02:15:57,950 --> 02:16:00,744
"Rise up and conquer this world."
