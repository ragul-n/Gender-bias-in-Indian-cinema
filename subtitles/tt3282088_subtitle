Why did you steal the (Jathi) fruit from church's garden 7

24
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,412
You could have just asked for it.

25
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,018
Jathi (Caste) shouldn't be asked for, isn't it 7

26
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,509
Hey !
- Its Done.

27
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,719
Namaste.

28
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,246
Hey Ravi !

29
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,681
What happened, Sadhu?

30
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,855
What about my album 7
Its been so long you haven't finished it yet.

31
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,951
It have to get the lamination done,
rest everything is done.

32
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,282
Don't cheat me.

33
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,761
No ways.
You come by evening.

34
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,824

Come later.
Everything is done.

37
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,710
This would be the final counsel.

38
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,217
You both are sticking
with the same opinion for separation.

39
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,250
Ye s

40
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,749
I have told you what is required.
Trust that's everything, isnt it 7

41
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,659
We don't have that from a longtime.

42
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,265
It took 22 years to realise that 7

43
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,828
You both would have understood each other.

44
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,837
For the first 10 years, we thought
we have understood each other.

45
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,406
Then later realised we were mistaken.

46
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,370
For last couple of years, we realised there is
no use of understanding each other.

47
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,242
We don't have any off-springs or any marital issues.
So thought it would be better to divorce.

48
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,697
I want to talk about something.

49
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,961

63
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,452
Nostalgia !

64
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,793
Can you tell me the way to Cochin 7

65
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,373
Can't you see the board, brother!
- Yes I saw that.

66
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,281
See you.

67
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,918
Your basic cheapness
won't leave you even after growing so old.

68
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,952
I am a feminist, buddy.

69
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,251
Bloody feminist!

Weren't you the one who informed reverend

00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,891
No.
Father had seen you guys running away.

00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,423
Will you tell it to the reverend about
us smoking up "beedi" here 7

No.

86

Do you need a smoke ?
- No

87
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,836
Don't be afraid.
- No I don't want to.

88
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,171
There is no harm.

89
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,342
Have you seen smoke being let out from eyes 7

90
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,515
No.

91
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,345

It would come out now.

00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,351
It came right.
Smoke's from your eyes.

96
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,931
If you say anything at the church.
Next time I'll poke it in your eyes !

97
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,747
What you doing with a pen and paper 7

Its splendid.

113
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,676
I have to give it to her by tomorrow.
- No, you'll loose your respect.

114
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,289
It's not the lovers who pass on these love letters.
It's the messengers.

115
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,151
You give me that letter.

116
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,324

Please be seated.

128
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,629
It looks like you.

129
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,505
I was taking a shower.
- Mum had told.

130
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,169
I really got shocked when you called me, Ravi.

131
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,682
When did you arrive 7
- Its been 2 days.

132
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,514
You both were in touch with each other 7

133
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,885
I can't sleep without scolding him everyday.

134
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,390
Did Raman or Anthony called you 7

135
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,166
<i>QUE'?</i>

136
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,702
Czechoslovakia.
Czech Republic and Slovakia.

137
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,833
What you do 7
- I'm a Planter in Thrissur.

138
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,405
He has got a studio in the junction.

139
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,242
What about you family 7

140
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,521
It's going well.
Just got divorced today morning.

141
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,461
Mom can you prepare some tea.

142
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,797
I'm not feeling well.

143
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,533
Mom is pretty aged.

144
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,226
We figured it out when we met her.

145
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,893
This is my sister's ﬂat.

146
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,368
We can go somewhere out.

147
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,344
We can go to his fann house.

148
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,408
He is free now anyways.
- That would be a good idea.

149
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,758
Is it bluetooth enabled 7

150
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,765
You forget it now.

151
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,581
What was the reason behind divorce 7

152
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,526
Hm
U

153
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,959
She doesn't trust me.

154
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:20,302
If I go out somewhere she would start questioning
about the where abouts and with whom I'm going.

155
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:24,133
Once when she was going out,
I asked those same questions to her.

156
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,309
From there the problem began.

157
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,907
How is Czechoslovakia 7

158
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:38,483
Its nice to say it.
Czecho - Slo-vakia.

159
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,386
It was good.

160
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,725
Just like any other place,
once you start living there you'll start liking it.

161
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,127
Its been 30 years.
Wife and kids are well settled there.

162
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,570
What about you ?
- He is not married, a chronic bachelor.

163
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,297
M?
E

164
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,769
Suppose if I get married,
I'll have kids after some time.

165
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,473
Then my Mom and Dad will thing
I'm that kinda person.

166
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,239
Get lost.

167
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,781
Its hot.

168
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,852
Take.

169
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,791
Smoke it.
- Don't force me.

170
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,370
It's a melting heart.

171
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,617
Madan, what about your childrens 7

172
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,485
I don't have any kids !

173
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,748
<i>Thais better.</i>

174
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:57,398
In school time, my dad was my hero.

175
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:04,170
As time passed I realised he is not that great.

176
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:14,748
After that while addressing dad to my friends
I never use to give any respect.

177
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,157
I realised what does a dad mean,
when I had my son.

178
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,425
What was I saying ?
- Son !

179
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,795
I started understanding my dad
when my son started growing.

180
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:42,437
By the time he had left me.

181
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:49,885
Now I'm at the place of my father and
my son in the place of me.

182
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,956
It seems your son had given you problem.

183
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,861
Yes indeed.
- Smoke this up.

184
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,597
I worked hard and got everyone well settled.

185
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,505
Now I want my life back.

186
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,677
We will search for Raman and Anthony.

187
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,741
When I look back,
I believe I lived only on those days.

188
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,513
We need to go to ldukki once.

189
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:31,683
I want to visit our school again.
And smoke ldukki gold.

190
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,841
Hey Madan what happened 7
You don't want to see Raman and Anthony.

191
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,642
Tell me!
- We shall go.

192
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,370
We will.

193
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,916
Brother, I would be coming back the day before
when you are collecting the honey.

194
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,748
Yes
- Not you.

195
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,259
I will come.
Don't spoil anything.

196
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,593
Hey
- Carry on with the work.

197
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,395
Come.

198
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,149
For a safe journey get in by stepping
with your right leg.

199
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,883
We could have taken the other car.

200
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,781
It's ourfamilys vehicle !
- Madan's vehicle should venture.

201
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,749
Yes !

202
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:15,328
Will Anthony be still there in Fort Cochin ?
- The chances are less but still we can search.

203
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,331
He would have become a renowned person.

204
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,671
If you listen to his talks
you would feel "Bruce Lee" is his father.

205
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:35,749
For many years I used to
check sports magazines to check for his photo.

206
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,252
All India Karate Champion
"Anthony Gonsalves" from Kerala.

207
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:47,185
I used to check for the Obituary column,
not just searching for him but for others aswell.

208
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,299
Get lost, cheap.

209
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,708
Chapter 3 : Ban Plastic.

210
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,586
Chapter 3 : Ban Plastic.

211
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:29,154

Get lost!
- Son of a Bitch!

216
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,264
We are the cousins.

217
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,693
Of Jalaja.

218
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,168
Who is Ravi 7

219
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,838
If you tell us he would be the
only one who would be getting beaten up.

220
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,840
Orelse everyone will get beaten up.

221
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:30,176
Who is Ravi 7
- He is the one, brother:

222
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:01,241
1978, McDowell's releases experimental version

223
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,447
Brother, please come.

224
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,788

225
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,294

He is taken to the church for burial.

231
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,719
Let me see him.

232
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,791
Father, come here for awhile.
- What happened 7

233
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,332
Just for a while.

234
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,130
These three are friends of Anthony master.

235
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,434
They have studied together in the school.
They want to see him for the last time.

236

237

Son, these are your father's friends.

239
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,789
They are coming from far and
want to see him for the last time.

240
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,787
If you confirm we can uplift it.

241
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,890
He was very close to us.

242
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,527
Lift it up!

243
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,382
He is too old.
He is not our Anthony.

244
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:58,312
Don't say we are mistaken,
we'll get thrashed. It's Cochin.

245
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:05,526
It was dad's wish to be dressed in his
karate uniform when he is rested in the coffin.

246
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,723
He used to say that always.

247
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,337
Dad, look your friends have arrived.
please look.

248
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,646
That was scary.
- The crowd would have thrashed us.

249
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,677
Hello, there is no one here.
Water...

No, I was occupied with work.

255
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,347
They are cheap Malayalee's,
if they just want to order tea or coffee,"

256
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,817
...tell them its not available and make them leave

257
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,674
A karate movie played by Bruce Lee.

00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,709
A tournament which is held in an Island.

259
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,772

Then which one is it 7
- It's there on the tip of my tongue.

264
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:03,770
Then turned super star "Jackie Chan"
has done stunt in a fight scene in the movie.

265
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,821
Brother!

266
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,433
You got one foreigner as your wife, lucky person.

267
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,739
Does she know malayalam 7
- I can understand.

268
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,215
Anthony, don't get stuck with Nostalgia!

269
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,482
It's lunch time and peak hour,
I won't be able to manage it on my own.

00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,522
Where are you guys now 7

00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,760
Ravi has got a studio in Thrissur Junction
and I'm a planter.

272
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,469
And Michael...
- Tell him where you from .

00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,770
I'm settled abroad.
- Give the exact location.

274
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,235
Czechoslovakia!

275
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,614
Now its Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Family is settled there.

276
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,322
My son, David.
Son, these are your dad's friends.

277
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:24,917
Did you had your lunch 7

278
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,525
I'm not hungry!
I'll have later.

279
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,529
Ok son.
you may leave.

280
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,861
He had it on the way.

281
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,868
I wished this kinda return someday.

282
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,375
We need to find Raman and visit "ldukki".

283
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,168
Just like old days.

284
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,147
I know it would be trouble but just 2-3 days.

285
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:02,591
It's peak season here.
It would be hard to stay away.

286
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:08,564
You guys go for the trip and
visit me on your return.

287
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:12,229
It's lunch time in the shop.

288
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,071
Please convey my regards to Raman
when you meet him.

289
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,705
ESQ

290
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,373
Do you still practise karate 7

291
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:27,712
I left it, bro.
Karate tricks didn't work out in life.

292
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:42,600
The reason Anthony is not coming is because
he is scared of that foreigner:

293
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,874
He has got his own responsibilities.

294
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:51,678
Out of nowhere if you barge in one day and ask
him to pack his bags to visit ldukki will he come !

295
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:56,808
Even we are going.
That's why I say there shouldn't be any responsibility in life.

296
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,787
We should be free like a bird.
Free birds !

297
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,460
Brother, I didn't get the album till now.

298
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,736
You didn't ?
- No

299
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,565
Everything was done.
That boy didn't hand it over to you 7

300
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,541
Which boy 7
- Free bird got entangled.

301
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:27,774
What did he do !
You wait I'll call him.

302
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:31,285
What is this 7
- You don't worry.

303
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,719
He would get you the album today.

304
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,316
Alright.

305
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,836
Look they are taking snaps of our vehicle.

Hey, Anthony.

Andrea, had taken two guests to the "Kalamandalam".

310
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,530
<i>Mast the “Kahmandalam” had come 'm handy.</i>

311
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,398
Get in .

312
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,156
Stop.

Ms "mam

mum
ESQ

316
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:35,098
You get delicious Rice and Salmon fry there.
Just behind the Hotel is the house.

317
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:41,441
I had been to his place during one summer vacation.
And we had food from the same hotel.

318
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,644
Everyone says you will have memory loss
by smoking cigarettes.

319
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,620
Now tell me how is it.

320
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,059
Let me just wet my feet.

321
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,721
What is this !

322
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:24,187
Why are you so scared of your wife 7

323
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,053
Because I have a wife.

324
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:44,075
Raman's house was just behind this Apsara Hotel.

325
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,645
What might have happened 7

326
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:56,056
Lord, can you please tell us
who are you in real 7

327
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,223
You fool, to find a commrade
we need to search him in Communist Party Office.

328
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,523
Dumb.

329
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,134
Enough.
Come lets go.

330
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,776
Chapter 4: Bhagat Singh of "Cheruthoni".

331
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,719
Party does not need a martyr like Rajan.

332
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:30,621
But the party is proud of the social awareness
the student had possess by going against.

333
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:35,153
...the leaders who are in power.

334
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:44,066
A warm welcome for the Chief of INS to the mid year
elections campaign happening in "Cheruthoni".

335
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,399
Welcome.

336
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,136
To speed up the Progress wheel of Kerala.

337
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:53,840
Lord Krishna of Keralawould be arriving
soon in his white Ambassador.

338
00:52:54,171 --> 00:53:03,421
We would turn his white smile into a black one
who suppressed our people behind the walls of the camp.

339
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:11,692
By gaining appreciation from ten thousands
and breaking all hindrance's he has reached "Cheruthoni".

340
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:17,268
We are the natives of "Kolumban"
who had prevented the heavy flow of rain-water.

341
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:23,505
Who is the Bhagat Singh of "Cheruthoni" 7

342
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,784
Bloods purpose is not just to flow in the veins.

343
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,760
It's for shedding aswell.
- lnquilab Zindabad !

00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,646
Run!

346
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:53,554
In quilab Zindab ad !

347
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:19,410
Hey, get up it's a rubber bullet.
Come.

348
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:24,055
His bloody chants !
Walk !

349
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,830
You understood.
- yes.

350
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:57,123
I have written the address on this.
If you have any doubts you can ask it in the vincity.

351
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,260
Thanks a lot.

352
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,816
Hey Madan,
You know our old Jalaja.

353
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,749
She stays here in Kainagiri.

354
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,524
#2
a

355
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,690
Her husband Shashi is in Fort Cochin.

356
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,254
Just because of you !
Orelse I would have married her.

357
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,362
You got someone else.

358
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,162
You want to meet her 7

359
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,772
What about you 7

360
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:57,135
a'?

361
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:11,591
It rained and waterfall on...
Jalaja (Lotus).

362
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,799
Hey Madan stop !
This is the house.

363
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:35,108
<i>A'?</i>

364
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:39,411
We have her gorgeous figure in our minds.

365
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,689
Yes !

366
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,795
What if suppose it's been disfigured.

367
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:06,510
Due to responsibilities and difficulties
she might have grown old with gray hair and big tummy.

368
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:10,515
No, don't say it brother:
We don't have to meet her, let's leave.

369
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,686
Let's leave.

370
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,281
Full tank diesel.

371
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:59,624
A. R Raman, Thenguthara House
Temple Road, Thayangiri .

372
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,630
Look at the elegance of Thayangiri.

373
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,375
Hey look there.

374
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,324
He looks similar to Raman.
- I can assure it's him.

375
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,159
There he goes.

376
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,824
That's enough.
- You gave the money.

377
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,830
I gave.
- Let's leave.

378
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,753
Don't be afraid.
Go

379
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,797
Let's leave.

380
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:14,267
Dad, I have to leave for Bangalore.
And you don't even know how to prepare tea.

381
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,641
You will be miserable.

382
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,283
Pray to lord Krishna and go ahead.

383
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,571
That's the vehicle.
- Yes, Santro.

384
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,712
Few people say your marriage got delayed
because of horoscope issue.

385
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:05,190
Other few are saying it's because you are fat.

386
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:09,488
There are also few who are saying it's
because you don't have enough dowry to pay.

387
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,227
But Saraswati sister haven't believed all this.

388
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:21,102
Everybody said you had poisoned your husband,
but I didn't believe it.

389
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,274
Yes.

390
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:40,288
Come in.
You didn't get any gift ?

391
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,667
Love ? And to him ?
-Yes !

392
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,770
It's been long but he wasn't saying it
because he was afraid of me.

393
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,678
She is his colleague named Manju.

394
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,785
It's her wedding day today 7
- No, tomorrow.

395
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:08,084
He confessed everything once boozed in the evening.

396
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:25,166
You are revealing it now
after working together for 10-12 years.

397
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,166
I haven't made this decision pondering a lot.

398
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,505
But a stern decision from a stem heart.

399
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,178
I Love you, Manju.

400
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,517
Did Surjeet agree to it 7

401
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,818
He is awaiting us outside.

402
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:53,534
But what would I tell to Policeman
who is coming to marry me tomorrow.

403
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,795
You'll be blessed if you ditch a policeman.

404
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,700
Love is like Chicken-pox.

405
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,178
It'll effect everyone even if it's late.

406
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,605
Aunt !

407
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,748
Aunt, where are you heading to 7

408
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,752
Till my house.

409
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,114
Till your house !
Who are you 7

410
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,778
Get up.
- Let's go

411
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,455
Make it fast.
- They will gather people.

412
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:26,287
Isn't anyone there 7 Come fast.
- Let's leave fast.

413
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,358
Come.

414
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,124
You already became a House Wife 7
- The earlier the better.

415
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,692
Toilet is inside.

416
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,196
Not because of that.
Today we are supposed to collect the honey.

417
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,738
We got all outstation employees
and it would be a mess if I'm not there.

418
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,171
Please infrom them when they wake up.

419
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:55,747
What are you doing 7
It's not water, it's honey.

420
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,222
You won't leave, isn't it 7

421
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:08,788
No, you got many things
like friends, alcohol and weed to enjoy.

422
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,290
You can go anywhere !

423
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:14,194
My world is here.
I won't go anywhere.

424
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,813
What are looking at 7
Carry on with your work.

425
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:50,431
"Tapioca" - It was grown here.
- It's been written over there.

426
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:56,574
Will it be available there ?
- We will try.

427
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,611
I think he is afollower of v.s

428
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,014
What is that 7
- That's Ginger.

429
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,182
It's not that great.
Just for a sake.

430
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,187
#2
E

431
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:15,189
We have a good nursery of Banana Plant's.
- Haven't got the time to look around.

432
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,263
Just a moment.

433
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:29,437
Sometimes we get depressed thinking that,
we are not blessed with any offsprings.

434
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:34,339
At that moment me and Madan will
walk around the backyard.

435
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:42,785
Probably to make us happy
we would always find a new fruit.

436
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:57,630
Is it "ldukki" 7
- No ! Not that great.

437
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:01,070
I have smoked up so many times.

438
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:10,048
Nothing comes close to the "ldukki Gold"
what we used to smoke.

439
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,611
Come see this.

440
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:21,558
It's been with me for last 35 year's.
This photo had got me here from overseas.

441
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:27,289
We look stoned !

442
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,800
We all need to go to "ldukki" together:
I need those days back.

443
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:43,712
Just imagine we all going to the plantation
and smoking "ldukki Gold".

444
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,715
We need to go to the school and see
if the "under-pant" tree still exist.

445
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,749
I want to relax by sitting next to the waterfall.

446
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:59,265
I know all these things will bring joy.
But I have a Party meeting on the 4th.

447
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,228
It can't be avoided.
- Look at him.

448
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,496
I have to register the marriage.
And Surjeet have to leave for Bangalore.

449
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,171
There are too many things to be done.

450
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,269
Even Andrea will be back by tonight.

451
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,540
Boys with responsibilities.

452
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,703
We had a get together:

453
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:16,441
We drank, we smoked up like old times
what else do we need 7

454
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:20,115
And we are not young like old days.

455
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,348
That's the problem.
You all have changed.

456
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:24,582
You have grown old.

457
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:28,661
Look at him the Ghost of old Anthony.

458
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,496
Rama, you are the one who stopped a bullet by your chest.

459
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,259
Get lost.

460
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:38,800
We can catch up later after these busy days
as everyone are residing nearby.

461
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:43,238
No I'm going back.
My Son had called me.

462
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,238
He apologised to me a lot.

463
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,309
Even I have Kids and a Family.

464
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,180
Leave Michael.
Nobody have got the old fire in them.

465
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,378
You can't say that.

466
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,152
The fire inside a communist commrade
would never extinguish.

467
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:02,760
It might get covered with ashe's but won't extinguish.

468
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:06,290
Then go and plant a kiss to that honey-comb.

469
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:14,096
That's not fair !
I don't have to prove it.

470
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:18,267
WEE'?
a

471
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,596
No don't do it. It's dangerous.
- You'll get stung.

472
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:29,112
Bloody Son of a

473
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:52,094
I'm sure he was stung by a bee.
- No !

474
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:57,509
We can't even make out as he got a expression-less face
which won't even change if he is stung by a bee.

475
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:29,631
Hey, we are all going to ldukki !

476
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,695
Anthony, where are you 7

477
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,668
I'm with my friends. Leaving soon.

478
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:05,540
It's been 2 day's, will you shut down this restaurant 7

479
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,713
Anthony, I'm looking after this family with great difficulty.

480
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:18,215
I shall burn down this entire place with kerosene,
if you try to defeat me.

481
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,143
What about "ldukki Gold" then 7

482
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,172
When 7

483
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:24,321
Hey, Anthony met with an accident !

484
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,192
Get up.

485
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,114
Are you Alright 7
- Everything is fine.

486
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:56,247
What did the Doctor say 7
- Nothing serious. He can be discharged tomorrow.

487
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:01,658
We are going to "ldukki".
Probably you won't be able to join due to the situation.

488
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,654
Even I shall join.

489
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,066
Where are you going 7

490
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:14,603
They would pan ways later, but we have our own life !

491
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,198
Don't mess it up.

492
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:30,382
Andrea, I haven't asked you anything ever.
Even the name of David's Father!

493
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,458
I have to leave !

494
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:43,595
Hold it.

495
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,572
Let's go.

496
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,182
Come.

497
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:11,721
The one who left is the real Karate Anthony.
- Here come Nurse Elsamma.

498
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,578
Hey Karate !
- What happend 7

499
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,740
What did you say to her,
that she agreed to leave you 7

500
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,312
I told her I'll quit smoking.

501
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:46,316
Hey , I think they have replaced the old reverend
with an Arc-Bishop !

502
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,687
Look at the arc in the entrance.

503
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,122
Don't crack such cruel jokes.

504
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,668
Be careful.
There are thorn's here.

505
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:10,011
He didn't move after being stung by a bee.
What will happen with a thorn.

506
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,120
Careful.
- Mother !

507
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:31,294
Michael, come here.

508
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,140
If you get hold of it,
make sure you don't leave it.

509
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:37,732
What 7
- Nostalgia.

510
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,049
Will we be able to see other 7

511
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,645
Don't you feel it like our School days 7

512
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,047
There is no signal here.

513
01:21:54,342 --> 01:21:58,620
Don't worry.
We'll go to our old den.

514
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,986
I'll buy you, your favourite stuff.

515
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,292
Brother, we need to visit "Kulumbamb para".
Please open the gate.

516
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,761
No, we can't allow without pennission.

517
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,127
What is the problem ?
- It's Forest Area.

518
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,131
You cannot venture within a 10 km radius
from the dam.

519
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,997
Terrorists are playing "Kabbadi"
within the Parliament.

520
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:49,437
What is the big deal ?

521
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,671
Why are you getting angry on me 7
- Who else is here then.

522
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,277
Madan, what happened 7
- Can't you open it 7

523
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,210
What happened 7

524
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,043
I don't understand
why can't you open the gate ! - Leave

525
01:23:00,408 --> 01:23:02,319
Leave.
- Get lost !

526
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:02,954
Leave.

527
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,318
He thinks he can saying anything as he
is wearing Khaki.

528
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,394
Oh.. Its Sadhu.
- Give it here.

529
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,030
Hey Sadananda, bloody donkey.

530
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,770
It's been 10-15yrs you have been married.
He is cheating you!

531
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:25,441
You didn't understand it till now.
You have lost your Marriage album, dumb !

532
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,310
Hold it.

533
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,314
Get in.

534
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:40,057
Hey, we won't be getting the album.

535
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,045
Hey Anthony, will it come ?

536
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,273
B!
WEE

537
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:08,277
Hey, did your Son call and apologised to you 7

538
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,587
NO!

539
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,159
Hey...

540
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:21,262
Let me know if you are interested in adopting kids.

541
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:27,467
There are 2 Orphan kids whom I know.
- Where ?

542
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:29,301
Look.

543
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:41,385
Brother, look it's coming.
The mist is coming.

544
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,663
Chapter 5 : ldukki Gold

545
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,374
Chapter 5 : ldukki Gold

546
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,035
Look.

547
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:44,572
Who is that 7

548
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,440
Don't talk.

549
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:57,180
M
aim'?

550
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:07,159
Looking at the scribbling's on the rock,
I was sure there are some usual visitors.

551
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,426
Come join.

552
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,420
It's Marijuana, isn't it 7

553
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:34,118
It's a plant just like Basil.

554
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,190
If you grow it from a seed it will slowly grow.

555
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,297
New leave's will sprout.

556
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:48,738
In the mountain terrain of ldukki under mild sunlight
few plant's will bear golden grains.

557
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,638
We native farmers will call it "Neela Cherra".

558
01:27:54,068 --> 01:28:02,112
In summer season, toursit like them who ascend the
hills from Goa have a different name to it.

559
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:11,290
Idukki Gold !

560
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:23,304
They come here to reap it and we would leave them to
either "Kolumbanpara", "Kalyanathand" or "Palkulammetu".

561
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:31,977
ER'?

562
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:37,245
That's manufactured by man and this one created by God.
Whom would you believe 7

563
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,957
We haven't tried it before.

564
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:07,710
Standing at that rock chief of the tribe showed the
spot for the construction of Dam to the Bristisher.

565
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:16,244
There is no other better place to start.

566
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:21,518
Lucky one's.

567
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:59,406
How is the harvest 7
- It's covered in the mist, lets see.

568
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,621
What is the matter 7
- We didn't see you after that.

569
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,962
We are out of stock.

570
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:23,463
Don't come as a group going forward.
The boy will get you the stuff.

571
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:42,045
Hey Madan, at least give me a beedi.

572
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,385
I don't have.
- Even that's not there.

573
01:34:57,558 --> 01:34:59,231
Grass !

574
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:06,635
What is it 7

575
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,143
E
EEG'?

576
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:11,609
Yes.

577
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,271
Hey Rama!

578
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:47,181
Hey Madan, hide the stuff.

579
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:54,117
Is everything ok 7

580
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,586
Kids, do you have any sense 7

581
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:08,259
Do you even think about your parents when
you keep smoking up in the forest and rocks!

582
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:15,504
What would you say to all this 7

583
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:19,269
Age !

584
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,707
What's the matter 7
- To fetch the tiffin.

585
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:33,219
Neither me nor the establishment has the hope that
we can make you disciplined with education.

586
01:37:36,217 --> 01:37:40,029
We have infonned all your families and
they would come .

587
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,150
Leave.

588
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:24,408
We had been asked to leave by
giving the transfer certificate.

589
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:27,935
Can't that demon give us a last chance !

590
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:30,207
We would have changed !

591
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:35,085
My dad will chop me down.

592
01:38:35,976 --> 01:38:39,423
I will be asked to work in the plantation.

593
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:43,926
The question is will we be able to see each other 7

594
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:50,019
We shouldn't leave the one who had betrayed us .

595
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,569
Catch him !

596
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,675
Go fast.

597
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:40,208
Stop there !

598
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:54,352
Beat him !
- Stop there!

599
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:58,526
Catch him !
- Come.

600
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:13,903
Stop there !

601
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:20,347
Beat him up .
- Come

602
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:34,328
I'll kill you.
- Stop there !

603
01:41:36,156 --> 01:41:37,464
Stop there !

604
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:43,402
Come fast !

605
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:47,679
Stop there !

606
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:04,115
Is Ravi serious about it 7
- About what 7

607
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:06,656
About the plantation 7
- Yes indeed.

608
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:08,517
He had gone in search of the guide.

609
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:11,320
Get Lost.

610
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,931
Rama, we had agreed we would be going.

611
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:18,502
That's his romantic fantasies.

612
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,263
Everybody had agreed to it !

613
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:26,544
Hey Madan, its because of your support
that dumb had got so spoilt.

614
01:43:27,134 --> 01:43:28,670
What's wrong with him 7
He is happy.

615
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:32,381
MES]

616
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:36,921
The jeep is ready.

617
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:41,557
It's forest area for some distance.
Then we have to trek for a while.

618
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:46,364
Nobody is coming from here.
It's cancelled.

619
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:53,027
I had told you from the beginning.

620
01:43:55,596 --> 01:44:01,569
You know after so many years after so many incidents still
we have gathered here for one reason.

621
01:44:02,669 --> 01:44:04,671
Because of ldukki Gold.

622
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:09,351
You and me had shared it as a golden breath.

623
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:17,258
From Lord Shiva to Che Guevara had smoked it.

624
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:23,331
You all are not my friends.
They all are dead.

625
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:26,961
Get lost !

626
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:31,103
Leave me.

627
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,912
Bloody Pig, you would have died !

628
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,124
Get Lost!

629
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,523
Press the accelerator.
- Shut up!

630
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:58,458
The driver is experienced he is aware of it.
You please shut up.

631
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:02,258
Don't worry.
- It's usual.

632
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:05,368
Press it.
- Don't scream.

633
01:46:11,665 --> 01:46:14,976
We are over it !

634
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:29,520
It's been too long.
- What happened.

635
01:46:29,983 --> 01:46:33,362
We are about to reach.
We have to halt at the second turn.

636
01:46:33,487 --> 01:46:34,898
We have to trek then, jeep won't go.

637
01:46:35,355 --> 01:46:38,598
We'll reach now.

638
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:43,504
Elephant !
- Where 7

639
01:46:48,435 --> 01:46:49,470
Male Elephant !

640
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,179
Don't worry, it's usual.

641
01:46:52,339 --> 01:46:55,650
He will leave in sometime.
We just have to switch off the light and wait for sometime.

642
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,448
There is nothing to worry about.
It's usual.

643
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:01,320
Don't be scared.

644
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:08,622
He said the lights shouldn't be switched off, isn't it 7
- No it should be switched off.

645
01:47:08,955 --> 01:47:10,593
It should be off.
Shouldn't be switched on.

646
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:13,301
0k.
- Don't talk.

647
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:17,341
Switch on the lights.
- Don't worry, Sir.

648
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:21,177
Run!

649
01:47:23,203 --> 01:47:27,310
Run ! Run! Run!

650
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:51,365
<i>'I?</i>
E

651
01:51:05,358 --> 01:51:09,568
I'm a tourist.
Had come here to see the plantation's.

652
01:51:10,263 --> 01:51:14,177
Leave me.

653
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:59,914
Madan, look they chopped me !

654
01:52:01,514 --> 01:52:05,291
What is this '?
Tell them we had come here to see the plantations.

655
01:52:05,585 --> 01:52:07,326
Keep quiet.

656
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:13,402
We forgot someone.

657
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:20,309
It's his plantation.

658
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:25,346
He recognised us we are trapped.

659
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:40,617
We just came hereto visit ldukki.
No other intension's.

660
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:47,321
As we told it was a mistake made in our young age.

661
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:52,154
Please don't keep that revenge.

662
01:54:56,322 --> 01:54:59,098
We have families.

663
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:03,666
Please don't harm us.
We shall leave.

664
01:55:14,207 --> 01:55:19,418
Michael, you don't have anything to say 7

665
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:32,365
ma:
EU

666
01:55:35,528 --> 01:55:40,273
I'm a ordinary man of ldukki filled with
revenge, hurt and sadness.

667
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:43,078
I haven't forgotten anything.

668
01:55:48,207 --> 01:55:53,452
After you left the school,
it took me months to stand up on my feet.

669
01:55:54,981 --> 01:56:02,923
Father Simon was the only person who cared about the boy,
who lost his parents and home in a land-slide.

670
01:56:06,025 --> 01:56:09,837
Even he abandoned me
for providing Marijuana to you.

671
01:56:11,431 --> 01:56:13,911
I was all alone again.

672
01:56:15,568 --> 01:56:19,607
I climbed the hills with John,
a friend of my father and became a fanner.

673
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:26,152
Then it took years for me to descend the hill
and escape from the loneliness.

674
01:56:32,185 --> 01:56:38,363
There are deep bruises in my body and heart provided
by you which haven't healed yet.

675
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:50,871
It's my day today.

676
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:03,583
No.

677
01:57:07,653 --> 01:57:11,931
Michael, do you remember
I was a poor chap.

678
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:20,271
I realized even I need to have friends after
watching you guys enjoying in the waterfall and forest.

679
01:57:23,336 --> 01:57:28,911
I was dumb who thought you would join me
in your gang one day.

680
01:57:33,212 --> 01:57:39,925
To make friendship with you, all though unwillingly
I delivered the packet to you on John's request.

681
01:57:41,454 --> 01:57:45,925
But that just got me miserie's.

682
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:08,621
There is no way out for those who get
stuck in the plantations.

683
01:58:15,154 --> 01:58:20,502
I lost vision in one of my eye by the
hit given by someone among you.

684
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:24,204
So I won't loose my aim.

685
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:32,041
Madan, have you seen smoke coming
out from the chest 7

686
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:40,981
Son, please tell him !

687
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:49,159
My father won't do anything to you.
He likes you a lot.

688
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,916
He will show you the way.

689
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:59,394
I used to tell him always that you'll return once.

690
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:05,195
The friendship that you
all shared will get you back to ldukki.

691
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:09,002
Take.

692
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:13,408
No need.
- Hey!

693
02:01:15,067 --> 02:01:19,106
We got our ldukki Gold.

694
02:01:35,187 --> 02:01:40,193
The feeling that we got after embrassing him
cannot be found in anything else.

695
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:47,205
Leave.

696
02:02:12,358 --> 02:02:15,168
Kill him !

697
02:02:35,147 --> 02:02:37,491
Hey, if you want pluck two leaves.

698
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:42,060
Why '?
It's just a plant.

699
02:02:43,055 --> 02:02:50,337
And that's how a new lesson was taught by "Behnan"
from ldukki to 55 year old Michael from Czechoslovakia.
