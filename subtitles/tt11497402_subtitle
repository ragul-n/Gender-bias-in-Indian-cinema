00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875


3
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,875
We'll discuss that
on our show today. More importantly...

4
00:01:55,917 --> 00:02:00,417
There is a rain forecast today.
So here's a superb song from 'Budhan'.

5
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:05,875
Enjoy! This is RJ Pavel for Tamizh FM...
Listen, relish.

6
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,792
Bloody darkness!

7
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,875
I'm tired of your hypnotism sessions.

8
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:32,792
Got a napkin?

9
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,708
How long was I in the darkness?
- Not as long as the last session.

10
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,750
I've been coming here for a year and a half.
When will I be cured of nyctophobia?

11
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,875
Come to therapy regularly,
and you'll be cured.

12
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,333
Fear of darkness made me quit my police job
and become a forensic trainer.

13
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,667
I'd have come regularly
if I'd seen some improvement.

14
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,000
Agni, first try to understand your problem.

15
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,958
A phobia is nothing but
 a situation you dread to face.

16
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
It could be a situation or an object.

17
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,292
For example, some people
 are afraid of crowds.

18
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,667
While some others are afraid
of public speech.

19
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,250
Blood, sharp objects, light...
various people have various fears.

20
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,417
And you're afraid of the dark.

21
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,000
You're unable to face it.

22
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,083
Are you done talking?

23
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,625
Nyctophobia cannot be treated
at the drop of a hat, Agni.

24
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,375
There is a procedure to it.

25
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:24,875
So, problems of the mind, like fear,
cannot be treated with medicines. Right?

26
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:28,500
Of course.
Only therapy can heal emotions.

27
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,833
Or you can overcome this fear
on your own.

28
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,083
That's the psychology applied behind
the last hypnotism session you underwent.

29
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,958
But you couldn't survive in that.

30
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,083
What are you getting at?

31
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,208
I had to snap you out forcefully.

32
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,250
So, no improvement.
I've been saying that from the start.

33
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,000
Spare me the lecture.

34
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,000
Agni, don't walk out of a session halfway.

35
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,292
I have more important things to do.
Goodbye.

36
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,542
You don't understand
the importance of these sessions.

37
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,375
Uncle, give me a balloon.

38
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,917
The red one.

39
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Crackpot, check out my balloon!

40
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,667
I'm a crackpot, huh?
Give me that!

41
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,250
Give it back to me!
I'm telling the teacher.

42
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,250
When my father is back,
I'll tell on you...

43
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It is murder.
She's drowned in water!

44
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,958
No, it has to be a suicide.

45
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,542
Stop fighting.
It's neither murder nor suicide.

46
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,833
Murder!
I know it's murder.

47
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,917
I've set it up like you said, sir.
- Thank you.

48
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,792
Rahim, catch!

49
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,083
What is the killer's greatest enemy?

50
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:53,917
The police?

51
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,833
Fathima?
- Sir, catch.

52
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,500
The killer's mistakes?
- No.

53
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,000
It's the blood of the victim.

54
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,833
Blood is our best friend.

55
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,750
A murder has taken place in this room.

56
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,000
Analyse the blood here
and tell me two things:

57
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,917
One- the position from where
the killer attacked the victim.

58
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,500
And two- the weapon used.

59
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,375
Veera...
- Sir?

60
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,208
There is a lot of blood.
Maybe a gun?

61
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,750
Okay... Sudha?

62
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:22,875
An iron rod?

63
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:24,833
Pratap?

64
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,000
That was going to be my answer, sir.

65
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

66
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,417
Where did the attack take place?

67
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,667
The dead body is here.
So, must be here.

68
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,500
Nice. Come on.

69
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,542
Hurry up, guys.

70
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,292
Pay close attention.
Look at the blood splattered.

71
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,875
It's in this direction.

72
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,542
So the attack must have taken place
on the opposite side.

73
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,625
The crime scene is not here...

74
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,208
but here.

75
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,667
Look on top.
The blood is splattered in four lines.

76
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,917
And each line is thinner
than the previous.

77
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,250
The killer must have attacked the victim
four times.

78
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,333
And the blood has hit the ceiling...

79
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:02,833
which means, the back of the weapon
must be sharp, or bent.

80
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,375
Sir, an axe?
- Fantastic.

81
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,667
The weapon is still in the room.
Find it.

82
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,375
Sir?

83
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,750
This is blood-stained.
So the killer must have used this?

84
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,125
Superb.
But...

85
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,333
The killer could leave a decoy weapon
just to divert us.

86
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,583
And that's called staging the evidence.

87
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,750
But the weapon actually used by the killer
is not an axe or a knife.

88
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,833
A forensic examiner needs a detective mind.

89
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,750
You must look at everything as evidence.
Including the dead body.

90
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,208
You'll be the first people
to attend a crime scene.

91
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,292
Your report shall decide
the fate of the case.

92
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:45,250
No matter which of the 38 forensic departments
you end up in, follow these four rules:

93
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,458
Pay close attention.
Your evidence could---

94
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,375
Mr. Agni...?
- Two minutes!

95
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,542
Preserve as much of the evidence
as possible.

96
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,750
Analyse the data thoroughly.

97
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,958
Your answer lies in the data.

98
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,875
Before jumping to conclusions--

99
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,458
Agni, attend to this case.

100
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,167
I can't do field work, sir.

101
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,917
I'm asking you to apply on field
what you're teaching in class.

102
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:05,750
I can't, sir.

103
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,667
Shut up!
Can't you see we're talking?

104
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,500
Hold it!

105
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,458
Did you note his body language?

106
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,792
A person's sight and pointed finger
must be on the same line.

107
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,750
If it's not,
the emotion is not real.

108
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,833
Out of my way!
He's using me to teach his class...

109
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,500
Are you here, doctor?
Wait there.

110
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,208
Is your wife around?

111
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,708
I'll be there in two minutes.

112
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,417
Okay, sir.

113
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,000
Luna, why should we force him?

114
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,458
I told you he won't accept any cases.

115
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,583
Don't waste my time.
You handle this case on your own.

116
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,958
Understood?
- Sorry, sir.

117
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,667
You handle it.
- Give me some more time.

118
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,667
I'll make him take up the case.
Sir...?

119
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,417
Don't sleep at work!
- I'll whack you.

120
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,417
Why do you own a mobile?
- Hi.

121
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,625
Nancy, nice earrings.
- Thank you.

122
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,167
If I don't answer your call,
you send the DD to pressurise me?

123
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,125
I'm tired of turning him down.
- Don't talk too much.

124
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,250
Tell them what you told me.
- Tell whom?

125
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,042
The victim's parents.

126
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,875
Sir...

127
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,042
Our daughter...

128
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,917
Our daughter Narmada...

129
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,000
She has left us, sir.

130
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,500
She was the apple of our eyes.

131
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,583
And now she's gone!

132
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,083
One minute...
Agni!

133
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,583
What? Trying to create sympathy?

134
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,542
You're so infuriating.
Stop!

135
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,458
There is no evidence or witness.
Or motive.

136
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,958
You can handle the case
during the day.

137
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,500
What do you want from me?

138
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:34,833
Tell me.

139
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,500
I killed Narmada.

140
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:44,042
If mobile phones never existed,
we'd have had no problems.

141
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,042
Narmada!

142
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,333
Narmada!

143
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,542
What's this?

144
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,542
I told you to tighten the curtain rods.

145
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,750
Don't change the subject.

146
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,458
I'm talking to you!

147
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,875
You've got some random guy's photo
as your WhatsApp picture.

148
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,500
What's that status?
'Happy birthday dear'?

149
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,958
That's how you talk?
- Where is the clip?

150
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,458
I'm talking to you.

151
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,917
I'll smash your face in.

152
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,417
Men who are just killing time
won't ask any questions.

153
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,667
But I'm serious about you.
How can I not?

154
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,625
I'll beat up the guy.

155
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,958
That's my cousin.
He lives in UK.

156
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,458
I mail a million people at work
saying 'Dear Customer' or 'Dear Sir'...

157
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,792
you'll whack them all?
Don't get hung up on these things.

158
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,833
There's a huge gap between these words
and our life.

159
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,167
It's out of trust that
we're in a live in relationship.

160
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,625
Baseless suspicion...

161
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,958
I'll tell you something?
Frankly, our frigging relationship sucks.

162
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,875
What did you say?

163
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:05,000
I said it sucks.
- No, before that.

164
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,833
So what?
- Tell me what you said.

165
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,208
I said it frigging sucks.
So what?

166
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,625
You think you're the only one
who can swear?

167
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,708
That's your caste speaking.

168
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,750
After that...

169
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,250
things only got tense.

170
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,375
So I left.

171
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,625
I had the pressure to meet targets
at my sales job.

172
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,958
I couldn't get anything done.

173
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,583
This kept running in my head.

174
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,208
I went to her office to speak to her,
but she wasn't there.

175
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,833
Then, I saw her at the road.

176
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,667
You act like you didn't see me!
- What's your problem?

177
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:17,375
I thought we could compromise.
But what you said... irks me deep down.

178
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,958
If you don't like me, leave.
I'll be fine.

179
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,250
Stop making a fuss.
You came here to tell me that?

180
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,958
Go home.
We'll talk later.

181
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:31,167
I cancelled my sales calls
and went home early that evening.

182
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,917
She humiliated me in public.
So I wanted to hurt her...

183
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,167
9/11 reminds us of the Twin Towers,
but that was an eventful day in many ways!

184
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,917
We'll discuss that
on our show today. More importantly...

185
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,083
There is a rain forecast today.
So here's a superb song from 'Budhan'.

186
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:49,667
Enjoy! This is RJ Pavel for Tamizh FM...
Listen, relish.

187
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,708
What's happened?

188
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,333
Narmada!

189
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,583
Wake up!

190
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Wake up!

191
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,917
Narmada, look at me!

192
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:34,917
Look at me!

193
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,375
Nami! Nami...
I'm sorry, love.

194
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,292
Forgive me, my love.
Wake up!

195
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:47,917
Narmada...

196
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,917
Have I killed you
because of my possessiveness?

197
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,708
I killed her.

198
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,000
If I hadn't broken her phone...

199
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,208
she could have called me.

200
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,458
I'll never see her again.

201
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,333
I killed her.

202
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,042
It was me.

203
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
I killed her.

204
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,083
I shouldn't have frigging fought.

205
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,417
You swear a lot?

206
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,500
You swear a lot?
- I don't know.

207
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,083
I don't know.

208
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,417
How long have you been together?

209
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,833
I've known her for four years.

210
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,083
We've been living together
for six months now.

211
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,958
Why didn't you marry?

212
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,625
Her parents are very strict.

213
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,375
Compared to her family...

214
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:09,125
I'm lesser in money, class,
social circle...

215
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,458
I wanted to start my own pharma company.

216
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,917
But I had no money.

217
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,333
I wanted to talk to her parents
after settling down.

218
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,375
But she's no more.

219
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,667
I misunderstood her.

220
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
I did.

221
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,708
Do you want to ask anything?

222
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,833
Do you want to ask anything?

223
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:07,958
Okay, Inba. You may leave.
Keep yourself available for us.

224
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,083
Turn off the cameras.

225
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,875
What is your problem?

226
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,875
Let's go.
- Why?

227
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,500
You ran out of biscuits?

228
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:31,292
I know why you're not showing interest.
Agni!

229
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,208
Agni!

230
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,750
Your problem is not nyctophobia.
It's Blessie.

231
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,708
Yes. It's Blessie.

232
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,375
Fine, I'm sorry.

233
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,792
You're fooling yourself.

234
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,542
You're not even trying
to get over her.

235
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,000
Every change needs a beginning.
Maybe this is the beginning?

236
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,208
Why do you torture me so?

237
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,167
I believed that the love of my life
would be with me forever.

238
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:14,000
At least I want to resist her memories.
Don't keep reminding me, please.

239
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:46,208
Don't worry, be brave and go home.
We'll find the killer.

240
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,042
Doctor, please take them.

241
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:08,667
Sir!

242
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:13,083
Please help me, sir...
- Quiet, the inspector is here.

243
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,458
Sir...
- Why have you made him come?

244
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,833
He came on his own.
- Give him a glass of water.

245
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,958
Don't cry. He will solve the case.

246
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:28,500
Priya's father refuses to leave.
Please have a word with him?

247
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,625
I'll talk to him?

248
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,083
I'll handle it.

249
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,708
Just solve this case for me.
Poor guy.

250
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:41,500
We planned the trip because you said
you'd handle it. What's the confusion now?

251
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,292
Still not found the rascal?

252
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,333
Why do you swear at his mother?

253
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,292
Found any clues?

254
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,875
Even better, I've identified the criminal.

255
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,458
Okay.
- Problem is...

256
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,833
the culprit was killed in an encounter
before the girl died.

257
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:56,333
But all the evidence points to him.
- So what?

258
00:28:57,042 --> 00:29:02,125
It's his flesh between her nails,
and the semen tested positive.

259
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,833
What I find strange is...

260
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:10,125
how could a man who's been dead
for three weeks, murder somebody last week?

261
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,417
Either, he's a ghost.

262
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:16,333
Or there must be a time machine.

263
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,167
There was a power cut for ten days
after the storm, right?

264
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,667
I'll laugh at your joke later.
Now let's solve the case.

265
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,417
Listen, think of the room as a freezer?

266
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:28,500
He could have raped the girl
three weeks ago and stored her body there.

267
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,542
There was a powercut for ten days,
so the ice melted and the body was discovered.

268
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,250
That's why the flesh under the fingernails
must have been preserved.

269
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:38,792
He is the criminal, Luna. Just write that
 in your report and close the file.

270
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,292
Tell Priya's father who the murderer is.

271
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,583
Please don't let him go!

272
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,917
Agni, don't...

273
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:21,500
If I had worked on Priya's case sincerely,
her father would still be alive.

274
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,208
Justice that isn't served on time
is useless.

275
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:29,250
There must be a reason
the case came to me.

276
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,958
I want justice.
- Don't cry.

277
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,375
I understand your pain.
No one gets away with their crime.

278
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,167
I'll find the killer.

279
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,167
The girl has been stabbed in the throat.

280
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,708
We don't know the weapon.

281
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,167
Only that it's penetrated 2 inches deep
and punctured her windpipe.

282
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,875
There is no confirmation
on the exact weapon?

283
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:58,875
No, but it must be a minimum of
5 inches long and 0.5 cm thick.

284
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:04,083
Judging by the force of stabbing,
killer falls between 25 - 30 years of age.

285
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,292
And it's been done without panic.

286
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,083
Any other bruises in the body?

287
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,875
There are no signs of rape
or harassment.

288
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:15,583
Narmada had consumed capsicum on the day
she was killed, and hence a food allergy.

289
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,792
That could be why
she didn't fight back.

290
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,042
Did you track her blood trail?

291
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:25,000
During recovery, most of her blood had clotted
or was absorbed by her clothes.

292
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,375
And the pouring rain
destroyed all possibilities.

293
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,292
All the evidence was washed out.

294
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,917
We searched using grid method
but found nothing.

295
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,167
So we don't know
the exact place of attack.

296
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,417
Going by the report, the murderer fled
before the girl even died.

297
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:45,458
It's not a pre-planned murder.
- Correct.

298
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,333
What could the motive be?

299
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,292
Problem is, there is none.

300
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,417
If it was a murder for pleasure,
the killer must be a psychopath.

301
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,750
The incident has taken place
between 8:20 and 8:40.

302
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,500
Before that?
- She withdrew 1,500 rupees from an ATM.

303
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,458
Out of which, 400 was missing.

304
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,667
Okay...

305
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:08,542
So let's start with the 400 rupees.
Where did she spend it?

306
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:15,417
But she didn't buy it, madam.

307
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,042
* Narmada's debit card got declined.

308
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:23,333
She went to withdraw money, but someone else
picked up the gift she selected.

309
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,833
Was it this man?

310
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:31,625
No, that guy is from around here.
He rides a red R15.

311
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:34,833
Tattoos and piercings all over his body...
he looks strange.

312
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,542
It's hard to miss him.

313
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:41,000
Esquire everyone with a
red R15 in our circle.

314
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:46,875
And WhatsApp me the rider's photographs.
Immediately.

315
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,667
Take a look at the ATM, too.

316
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,875
Javed?
- Tell me, sir.

317
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,500
You've become a forensic trainer now?
Tell me, sir.

318
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:05,292
You covered the V1 case in Mogappair?
- Yes, sir.

319
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,583
Shall I mail you the details?

320
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,542
Sure, data is always useful.

321
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:15,417
More importantly, gel with the public
and report any unusual activities to me.

322
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:16,542
Okay, sir.

323
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:23,000
Agni, the ATM security guard confirmed
what we saw in the CCTV footage.

324
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,250
We have a few photographs.
Let's ask the shopkeeper if it matches.

325
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,208
It's none of these people.

326
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:37,125
Narmada must have paid him 400 rupees
and bought the gift from him.

327
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,167
But she didn't have the gift with her
when she died.

328
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,167
He was the last person to see her.

329
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,000
Who knows?
He could be the killer.

330
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,000
Sir, this is the guy.

331
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,750
Want to eat something?

332
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:14,958
Coffee?

333
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,625
For the both of us?

334
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,458
This is such a depressing place
for us to meet.

335
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,167
Let's go to a coffee shop?

336
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,625
What's your name?

337
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,792
Sid!

338
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,292
And you, beautiful?

339
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,500
Tell me your full name.
- Siddhanandan.

340
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,958
Do you like it?

341
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,500
I mean, my name.

342
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,667
Miss...

343
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,958
Is it 'Miss'?

344
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,208
Where were you
 on September 11th?

345
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,375
September...

346
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,042
A beautiful angel like you...

347
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Answer me!

348
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,708
It was my friend Murthy's engagement.

349
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,542
What a party, fun music...

350
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,958
that was on the 12th.

351
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,042
I was here on the 11th.

352
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,042
My darling!

353
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,083
Good one.

354
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,333
Is this meeting about our love?

355
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,750
Where's my babe?
Love...?

356
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,000
Babe?
- Love?

357
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,792
For two months now.

358
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,208
She didn't love me back.
But still...

359
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,250
It was divine love, you know!

360
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:49,292
So the girl didn't love you back.

361
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:50,958
And you killed her.

362
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,875
I'm so shocked,
I can't even cry.

363
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,625
I swear...

364
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,917
Ask all the women I'm in love with...

365
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:16,375
Once they turn me down,
I feel sorry for their loss and move on.

366
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,875
Don't take me so seriously, madam.

367
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,083
You were the last person to see her.
What did you do to her?

368
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,500
What happened that day, was...

369
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,875
Dude...

370
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:38,500
You should see my hairstyle today.
Mind-blowing!

371
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,333
Will you see me?

372
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Or will you not?

373
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,625
Excuse me!

374
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,333
This is superb.

375
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,250
It's amazing.

376
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,125
So sweet!

377
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,208
How much is that? The other one?
- 400.

378
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,375
Give me that.

379
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,750
Here I come.

380
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,750
Sweets...

381
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,250
When I see this heart, I feel so good!
- PIN number, please.

382
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,250
Can you feel it?
- Card declined, madam.

383
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,458
There's an ATM close by.

384
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,750
That's 400 bucks.

385
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,292
Baby!

386
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,875
She looks like an aunt,
you call her a baby?

387
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,250
Hold on, baby.

388
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:35,458
You wanted to gift me this.
But I surprised you with it!

389
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,292
Narma darling!

390
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,625
I've had it with you.
What is it that you want?

391
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:43,792
It's you I want!

392
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:49,208
You accepted my gift. I'll take it
that you've accepted my love?

393
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,500
Careful.

394
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,292
Darl--!

395
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,667
Darling! Tom and Jerry.

396
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,000
When she flung that gift on my face...

397
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,833
I realised that she wasn't my soul-mate.

398
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,667
So...

399
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,500
Sorry!

400
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:12,750
So? - So I kept those gifts safely to give
to some other girl.

401
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,250
Luna, we can hypnotise
the truth out of him.

402
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:16,917
Please, doctor.

403
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:22,792
Luna!

404
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,083
The coffee?

405
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,083
She'll be serving me?

406
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,208
Hi, doc.

407
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,417
I'm Sid.

408
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,958
You don't have to tell me your name,
but you can give me your hand?

409
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,833
Fine, you keep your hand.

410
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,458
Mannerless people.

411
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,375
I'm going to hypnotise you
to reach your subconscious mind.

412
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,583
You'll reveal the truth on your own.

413
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,375
Close your eyes.
Let's begin?

414
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,875
You and I are alone in this room.

415
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You naughty lady!

416
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,458
Just listen to my voice.
No need to shake your head.

417
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,750
Okay!

418
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:04,542
Pay close attention to your breath.

419
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,417
3... 2... 1...

420
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,625
We're entering your subconscious.

421
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,417
You're going to reveal the truth to me.

422
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,750
Inba is not a good man.

423
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,167
Narmada was in love with me.

424
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,042
He didn't like that fact.

425
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,292
And that's why...
he...

426
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,375
He planned everything.
He shot her!

427
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,083
He shot Narmada!
He's a bloody fool.

428
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:33,208
He shot Narmada!
He did!

429
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,500
Now come back to your conscious state.
- I'm coming back.

430
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,625
Open your eyes slowly...

431
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,000
She's not here, bro?

432
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,542
This is the beat?
- Awesome, bro!

433
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,333
You were not even hypnotised.
Why did you lie?

434
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,458
I wasn't?

435
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,875
But I felt like she did.
- Is it?

436
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,750
Sure?
- Very.

437
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,875
Bro, man-to-man, I'll tell you the truth?
- Tell me.

438
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:51,958
I don't like Inba.

439
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,167
And I just know it,
he must have done it.

440
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,625
What do you know?
- What happened that day...

441
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:06,917
Wait, woman!

442
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,208
You're hanging out
with some other guy?

443
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,833
Why are you behaving like a psycho?

444
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,333
Even if I am hanging out with someone,
what's your problem?

445
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,708
You think I'm a psycho?

446
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,125
Then why are you still with me?
Leave me.

447
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,000
Go and live with
the guy you like.

448
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,125
You don't need to live with a psycho.

449
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:24,333
You don't get to tell me what to do.
I can handle my life by myself.

450
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:27,167
Don't create a scene here.
Go and mind your own job.

451
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,333
Oh, then return all the money
I spent on you.

452
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,625
I will.
Leave now.

453
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,333
Get me my money
from an ATM now!

454
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,500
Why do you act so cheap?

455
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,750
Who? Me?

456
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,167
I know you're not about to cry.
Don't act.

457
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:47,375
Instead of killing me little by little,
just kill me and get it over with.

458
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,542
Wait and see,
 that will happen someday.

459
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,875
What the fish?

460
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,875
He's capable of doing anything when angry.
Don't let him go, bro.

461
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,292
Thanks for the information. You may leave.
- Thanks, bro!

462
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,292
Bro...

463
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,083
I have a doubt.

464
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,958
Narmada's death is quite saddening.

465
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,250
R.I.P.

466
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,542
But we have a party planned in Goa
day after: fun, girls, music.

467
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,750
I won't be required
for this case, will I?

468
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,167
Looking for something?
- My gun...

469
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,625
Oh, you're so funny!

470
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:31,708
That moron didn't sound convincing.
Why did you let him go?

471
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,292
Words and tone are only partly
indicative of the truth.

472
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,708
Their body language will reveal the rest.

473
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,875
There was no lie in his body language.
Definitely innocent.

474
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,333
But I agree, he's a moron.

475
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,542
I'm not saying anything, spare me!

476
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,208
You needn't say anything.

477
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,042
Sir, one Julia has come to see you.

478
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,042
Let her in.

479
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,292
Julia!

480
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:58,958
Who is this girl?

481
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:02,667
A girl? She's Narmada's colleague
and close friend.

482
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,667
We'll find some information.
Let's see.

483
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,333
Don't be nervous.

484
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,583
We're just going to speak casually.

485
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,542
Are you alright?

486
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,292
Who killed Narmada?

487
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,542
I don't know that, sir.

488
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,875
But Inba upset her that day.

489
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,458
Why? What did he do?

490
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:41,083
Narmada's father used his caste influence
and got her into a medical college.

491
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,375
But Narmada turned it down.

492
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:46,375
They yelled and abused her
for that.

493
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,708
She didn't speak to her parents
for two years after that.

494
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,583
She's that sensitive.

495
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,750
Knowing all that,
he swore at her.

496
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,750
Who swore at her?
- Inba.

497
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:02,333
Even in her insurance policy, she's listed
him as her nominee, not her parents.

498
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:04,625
She trusts him so much.

499
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,250
He's a sadist.
He just didn't get her.

500
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,792
She was so hurt.

501
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,750
I compelled her so much,
but she didn't even come to team lunch.

502
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,708
Where did she go then?

503
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,625
You act like you didn't see me!

504
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,500
I really didn't see you!
Why did you come here now?

505
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,875
I thought we could compromise.

506
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,667
But what you said...
irks me deep down.

507
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,292
Why are you blowing up everything?

508
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,000
Are you going to torture me
to death this way?

509
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,792
Wait and see,
 that will happen someday.

510
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,333
I didn't bring it up with her
as I didn't want to hurt her.

511
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,125
Okay.

512
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,500
Do you suspect anyone
other than Inba?

513
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:48,250
Other than Inba...?

514
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,708
I can't think of anyone.

515
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,500
So... Inba must have done it?

516
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,667
I can't say that!

517
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,250
But Inba is very short tempered.

518
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:08,208
He has no control over his actions
when he loses his temper.

519
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:13,167
But then he regrets his actions
and gets restless with guilt.

520
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,500
Maybe Inba could have...

521
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,875
there is a chance.

522
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:42,000
What's with the team? It's just an enquiry.
Won't the two of us do?

523
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:45,250
He's killed his girlfriend for
one million insurance money.

524
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,792
Do you suggest we get his appointment?

525
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,208
You used the read technique.

526
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,875
You asked the witness questions
with answers you wanted to hear.

527
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,083
Naturally, Inba was the only answer.

528
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,667
Then why should all the witnesses
be against him?

529
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,458
He shed crocodile tears at the box.
I saw right through him.

530
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,375
Listen.

531
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,042
When there is pain in the heart,
the left side of the eye tears up.

532
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,417
He wasn't pretending.
- What's your point?

533
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,292
We'll give him the benefit of doubt
and let him go?

534
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,375
It's only a doubt. There's no evidence
 to prove he's the killer.

535
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:16,167
95% of women's killers are
men from their close circle.

536
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:17,292
Which is why I'm here.

537
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:20,500
What if he confesses to killing?
- How?

538
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:23,417
If we give him third degree treatment,
he'll automatically confess.

539
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:26,583
Madam, I think he's inside. I knocked
but there was no answer.

540
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,917
See if there's another entry.

541
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:33,917
Inba!

542
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,292
Inba!

543
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,167
Maybe he escaped?
Shall I break open?

544
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,667
Save your breath.

545
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,458
Inba!

546
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,167
Agni...

547
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,542
Agni...

548
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,333
I think he's dead.

549
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,500
Don't touch anything.
Wait outside, please.

550
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,542
Call up forensics and ambulance.

551
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,750
Rough sketch and finger prints
altered. Photographer on the way, sir.

552
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,083
The house was locked.

553
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,708
No, we haven't disturbed the evidence.

554
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Don't worry, sir.
I'll stay and take care of the checklist.

555
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,417
Agni is working the scene.

556
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,375
The killer could have entered
through the terrace, too.

557
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:28,208
We didn't expect it either, sir.
Looks like a murder.

558
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,708
Narmada's murderer could have killed Inba.

559
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,167
Maybe the same killer
got them both.

560
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,833
This is not a murder.
It's suicide.

561
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,292
Sir, I'll call you back.

562
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,750
What?
- Inba is right-handed.

563
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:44,500
So, the injection mark is on the left.

564
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,917
He's taken an adrenaline booster
to gain courage to die.

565
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,875
It's used by sportspeople.

566
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,833
Being a medical rep,
he could source it easily.

567
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:55,667
What about the other injection mark?
- That's an empty syringe mark.

568
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,750
He injected himself with air,
which formed bubbles in his arteries...

569
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,250
and he's died of a heart attack.

570
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,250
So 'I killed her' is his suicide note?

571
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,042
Poor guy.

572
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:07,875
He feels responsible for her death.

573
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,667
Two consecutive murders in one house.

574
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,375
The media will have a field day.

575
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,542
Media.

576
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:20,208
When something like this occurs,
people hesitate to come forward...

577
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,500
with information
to the media or to us.

578
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:25,042
They wait till we knock on their doors.

579
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,750
Three streets connect the gift shop
with the victim's house.

580
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:43,000
Half the case is solved
if we identify the crime scene.

581
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,958
But it's a large area to cover.

582
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,333
Then let's use straight method
and knock on doors.

583
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,500
I'll go that way.

584
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:52,667
Excuse me, ma'am.

585
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,000
Did you hear any sound
on the day of the murder?

586
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,542
Have you seen this girl?

587
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:03,792
Do you know anything about the murder
in this area?

588
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,125
No. I don't know anything.

589
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:06,417
Thank you.

590
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,833
The noise came from that direction.

591
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,792
You didn't go out to see what was up?
- No, madam.

592
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,583
Sorry, I don't know.

593
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,667
My back is gone!
84 houses!

594
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,875
I've narrowed down the time and location
of the murder in the street.

595
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,417
Based on what we've heard,
it wasn't raining when she was killed.

596
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,000
It started raining later.

597
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:52,167
They heard the scream from that street.
So that's where it must have happened.

598
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,667
You said you missed which house,
in this 200 metres?

599
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:56,792
That one.

600
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,125
I knocked thrice.
No response.

601
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:00,667
You asked the neighbours?

602
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,333
Let's try.

603
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:15,667
Excuse me?

604
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:19,333
I'm running late already.
- Is the house next door unoccupied?

605
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:20,542
Avinashi must be there.

606
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,583
Check in his guest house? If not here,
he'll definitely be there.

607
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,750
Okay? I'm leaving.

608
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,292
Tell me, Javed.
- You'd asked about the V1 case detail?

609
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:31,917
Found something?
- Yes, sir.

610
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:35,250
Street harassment of girls
by men on bicycles...

611
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:40,375
chain-snatching, several such unreported
petty cases, sir.

612
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,042
Even on September 11th,
a man has snatched a chain.

613
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,208
What happened?

614
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,125
Nothing, let's go.

615
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,625
Agni!

616
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,750
Judy, how did you get here?

617
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,292
Come on, baby...

618
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,542
Who are you?
What do you want?

619
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:22,208
We're enquiring door-to-door
about a murder case.

620
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,042
This girl was murdered three days ago.

621
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,583
Do you know anything about this?

622
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:27,917
No, I don't.

623
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,083
Why? You weren't here?

624
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,333
No, no.

625
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,542
I was home, but I had a headache.
So I went to sleep early.

626
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,625
Why?
- Why did you get a headache?

627
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,750
I had drinks.
A lot of drinks.

628
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,917
When did you go to sleep?
- At 8.

629
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,708
Judy! Judy, no...
- Nice dog.

630
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:46,917
Luna...

631
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,125
He seemed to have ready answers
for all our questions.

632
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,083
Not a word he spoke is true.

633
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,125
He's cooking up a story for us.
- Look...

634
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,583
I don't need to lie to you.

635
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:00,833
Get out of my house.

636
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:02,542
Or it will get ugly.

637
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,750
He's not worth it, Agni.
He wouldn't have done it.

638
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:07,333
What?

639
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,417
Get lost!

640
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:09,417
Talking to me?

641
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:11,917
Luna!

642
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,000
I'll kill you when I catch you!

643
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:44,833
Stop!

644
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:45,958
Watch out, Agni.

645
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,125
Tell me.
- Agni, where are you?

646
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:44,833
He's going towards the go-down.
- Don't go alone in the dark, I'm coming.

647
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:06,833
Come on!

648
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,542
No!

649
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,542
Light...

650
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,083
Avinashi!

651
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:52,208
You're afraid of the dark?
Like some child?

652
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,375
Go, go, go!

653
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:39,667
You climb on to the van.

654
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,333
Lift!

655
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:44,917
Be careful...

656
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,417
Make it quick!

657
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,333
Get in!

658
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,083
Fast, get going.

659
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,583
What are you looking at?
Sit.

660
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,083
You'd look so much nicer in a saree.

661
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,417
Why did you run away from us?

662
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,167
You must have done something wrong.

663
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,083
Where were you on September 11th?

664
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,708
You said I'm not worth it?

665
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,708
Is it so obvious?
- Where were you?

666
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:41,125
I'd gone to the hospital to meet Sagi.
- Is she your girlfriend?

667
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,333
What's that to you, woman?

668
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:47,125
If I hit you with a fiber lathi...

669
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:50,042
when you're 40,
you'll die of shriveled nerves.

670
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,583
I know you killed that girl.
Tell me why.

671
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,417
Is this how you beat up
a guy during interrogation?

672
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,125
I can file a case against you
with that recording.

673
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,500
You know that?

674
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:05,500
For which, you'll have to leave this room.

675
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,417
Take your time.

676
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,417
It's my word against yours.

677
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,875
You're wasting your time
on the wrong guy.

678
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:16,125
Is it?

679
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:17,542
Okay.

680
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,083
Sec 177 - intentional omission
to give information.

681
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,167
Sec 179 - refusing to answer question.

682
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:29,500
Okay, I'll file that in my reports then.

683
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:32,250
I said, I didn't do anything.

684
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,458
You have any idea what prison is like?

685
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,958
Your dog won't be there.

686
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:41,708
It's a different world.

687
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,000
A tiny cell, open toilet...

688
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,875
everything you've done so far
in the privacy of 4 walls...

689
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,750
you'll be forced to do
in front of 40 men.

690
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Get ready for it.

691
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,083
What do you want me to say?

692
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:55,167
The truth.

693
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:56,750
I didn't kill her.

694
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:02,125
I didn't kill her.

695
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,208
Hi, Agni.

696
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,583
Feeling better?

697
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,417
Why would you do this?
- What?

698
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,958
You could have been more careful?

699
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,750
Where are you going?
- To my cabin.

700
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:27,583
Meet the DD first.
- Why?

701
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,292
I told you to wait!

702
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,667
Who asked you to
enter a dark room alone?

703
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,083
Was the heroism necessary?

704
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,667
That was nothing.

705
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,000
What did Avinashi say
about the motive for murder?

706
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,750
Ask me what the doctor said.

707
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:42,167
She said I'd get better
with treatment?

708
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:43,958
You never admit your mistakes.

709
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:45,250
How is it my fault?

710
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,708
Don't yell at everyone
to conceal your weakness.

711
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,417
Deepa, we need to meet the DD.
Tell him Agni is here.

712
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,083
Don't glare at me!

713
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:53,333
Sit.

714
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,000
Are you feeling better now?

715
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,375
Look...

716
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,083
Everything that affects our health
starts with the mind.

717
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:10,292
You must believe that nothing
will happen in the dark.

718
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,125
Whatever you believe, will happen.

719
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,750
You must care for yourself,
just the way you care for Sam.

720
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:18,208
Luna...

721
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,667
DD asked you to come in alone.

722
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,250
Tell me, sir.

723
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:37,375
Sorry, madam.
I couldn't speak the other day.

724
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,417
Tell me.

725
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:41,417
Sam kept crying for her father
and became unconscious.

726
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,375
Sometimes, we cannot handle her.

727
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,917
Please come and meet her once.

728
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,125
Please take care of her.
I'll come soon.

729
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,750
You can't hide the truth from her forever.

730
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,708
I should have shot you down
the day I learnt to shoot.

731
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:28,250
I'm packed and ready.
You can't even answer your phone?

732
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,750
Sorry, dude.
I was upset.

733
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,417
What happened, love?

734
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,875
One man, in the station...
forget it.

735
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,417
Is this supposed to scare me?

736
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:39,708
I failed miserably.

737
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:41,417
How did you figure it out?

738
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
Are you such a fancy detective?
- Of course.

739
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,208
Would a killer place the knife perfectly,
drink water from the fridge...

740
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,667
and put the bottle back?
Even the mark is not dried yet.

741
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,833
Don't talk too much,
or I'll shoot you in the mouth.

742
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,875
There's only one gangster in this house,
and that's me.

743
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,458
You know all about knife positions
and water bottles...

744
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,208
do you know what this is?

745
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:05,208
You've pulled some trick with lemon.

746
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,167
Life is full of solving puzzles, right?

747
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,667
Your gun is poking me!

748
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,083
Deal with it.

749
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,250
You're crying, aren't you?

750
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:32,208
When the baby comes,
you won't even notice me!

751
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,875
You're my first child.

752
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,750
Really?

753
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,667
Not really.
- Get lost.

754
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,208
Look at that expression!
Let's take a selfie.

755
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:48,375
You're posing like a baby gorilla!
- Stop shooting a video.

756
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,417
Come on, my little angel.

757
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,500
Dude, the ice cream guy is outside.

758
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,125
We're eating it already.
- You are. What about me?

759
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,083
I don't have change.

760
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,500
You go find us change.
I'll make him wait.

761
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:00,042
This form of nyctophobia is found in
one in twenty million people.

762
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,875
Children get afraid of the dark.
That's natural.

763
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,083
But in adults, that's dangerous.

764
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:09,292
Make sure you're always in
well lit conditions.

765
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:12,792
Agni, you don't need medication for this.

766
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,917
Just come to therapy regularly.
That will do.

767
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,958
Shwetha, let's keep this
between us.

768
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:22,792
What happened?

769
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:24,417
That's how he is.

770
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,708
I'll make sure
he comes to treatment regularly.

771
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,083
Getting angry with the doctor
won't solve anything.

772
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,125
My Blessie is gone.

773
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:37,208
What do I have to live for?

774
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,333
To give life to another person.

775
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,292
So the man who died...?

776
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,000
He was innocent.
Just an ice-cream vendor.

777
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:01,917
He started running
when he heard gun-shots.

778
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:07,042
That's why he ran as I chased him?

779
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,167
Family?

780
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,417
I enquired.
 He only has one girl child.

781
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,458
I don't want anything.

782
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,542
I want my father.

783
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,375
Be a good girl and eat.
Or your father won't come.

784
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:29,917
Agni!

785
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:31,958
Agni!

786
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,375
DD asked you to come.

787
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:36,958
Welcome, Mr. Agni.

788
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:39,958
Sit.

789
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:43,583
Are you okay?
- Of course.

790
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,625
Is it...?

791
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,833
Luna, close this V1 case file.

792
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,042
What?

793
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,417
Why?

794
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:55,167
I interrogated Avinashi.
- But I didn't.

795
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,125
Mr. Agni!

796
01:08:57,417 --> 01:09:00,000
You'll have nothing to do
with this case henceforth.

797
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,125
How could that be?

798
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,708
I'm handling this case.

799
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,500
Luna was supposed to handle this case.

800
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:08,167
She requested me,
 so I let you be on board.

801
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:09,625
You're just a trainer, man.

802
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,208
But I'm handling---

803
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:13,583
The whole world seems to know
about your nyctopobia.

804
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,375
Including Avinashi.

805
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,375
But not our department.

806
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,292
It didn't affect my work in any way.

807
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:26,667
I must detain you for hiding
your medical condition from the department.

808
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,500
They'd have buried you in enquiries
and background checks.

809
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,083
But I've not done that.

810
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:35,208
I'm sending you away with all your
 remuneration and employee benefits.

811
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:36,917
You know why?
You deserve it.

812
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,250
This is the reason...

813
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,708
This is why I refused
every time you brought me a case.

814
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:46,500
Okay, sir.
I'll be leaving.

815
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,250
But I want to know
what Avinashi said.

816
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:52,167
Why should I tell you?
It's not your case anymore.

817
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,542
Why are you getting involved--?

818
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,708
You're the one who said I deserved this.

819
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,292
I deserve to know
who killed Narmada.

820
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:04,417
Show him.

821
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:15,583
How long will you keep me here?
I'm going crazy.

822
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Okay...

823
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:25,792
You want the truth?

824
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:27,917
If I tell you...

825
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:33,708
That night, I was hurrying back home
before it started raining...

826
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:38,708
I saw a figure moving in the dark
as I crossed 2nd Cross Street...

827
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,625
it was moving hesitantly.

828
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,125
I was suspicious...

829
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:46,500
So I followed that figure,
with the knife in my keychain.

830
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,500
That's when I realised it's a woman.

831
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:59,625
I touched her shoulder to ask
 if there's a problem, but she yelled out.

832
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,417
I didn't expect that.

833
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:03,875
My keychain fell on the ground.

834
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,000
And she fell, too.

835
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:09,208
That moment, I didn't understand
what happened.

836
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,500
My hands were covered in blood.

837
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I got scared.

838
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,750
I wanted to get out of there,
but my keychain...

839
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:24,042
she was lying on it!

840
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,875
I took my keychain and left.

841
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:31,542
The photograph you showed...

842
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:33,542
it was that girl.

843
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,667
That's why I ran away from you in fear.

844
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:37,583
Fine!

845
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,292
But he didn't kill her.

846
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,500
I didn't ask for your opinion.

847
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:45,333
Agni!

848
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:49,708
The keys stabbed her neck
while falling down? How?

849
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,917
How is that possible?
- It is not impossible.

850
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,375
What?
- Nothing he says is believable.

851
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,583
He followed a girl at night
and touched her shoulder?

852
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,042
What if it's true?

853
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,833
I've faced the guilt of punishing
an innocent man.

854
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,000
Don't raise your voice!

855
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:04,042
You'd have died
if Luna didn't rescue you yesterday.

856
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,542
Luna will handle it.
You may leave.

857
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:09,292
Both of you are diverting the case...
- Get lost.

858
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,250
Agni!
- Luna...

859
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:17,250
Avinashi's confession is not enough
to hold the case.

860
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:21,458
Agni will cause enough troubles.

861
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,458
We need strong evidence.

862
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:27,542
You put him under surveillance.
He will definitely get caught.

863
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:31,500
Agni is the best man we've got, sir.
Please don't lose him.

864
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,292
Agni...

865
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,542
He's not even the murderer
but you've got him locked up.

866
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:39,083
Just like you, I studied his body language.
He is a pervert.

867
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,708
So what?
I have two days left to sign off.

868
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,375
I'll find the real killer.
- No.

869
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:45,917
You stay out of this, Agni.

870
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,750
Listen to me...
- You dragged me into this.

871
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,875
Now you're pushing me away!

872
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:54,708
Don't you get it? You'll die the next time
 you end up in the dark.

873
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:58,042
Don't make me regret
bringing you on-board.

874
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,208
Look, I have no family
since Blessie left.

875
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,375
You're my only friend.

876
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:04,208
I won't make you feel regret.
Trust me.

877
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,208
Why are you so adamant?

878
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,917
Like you said, every change
needs a beginning.

879
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,667
Maybe this case could be it?

880
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:13,375
What should I do now?
- Let's start from the beginning.

881
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:15,792
We've been doing it right
from the beginning.

882
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,458
If my guess is right,
we've come across our killer.

883
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:21,750
Exactly. But we've missed
some vital information about the killer.

884
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,542
Did we leave something halfway?

885
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,000
Then I went to see her at work...

886
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:34,875
But she wasn't there.

887
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,708
I saw her at the road.

888
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:42,292
I compelled her so much,
but she didn't even come to team lunch.

889
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:47,458
Judging by the force of stabbing,
killer falls between 25 - 30 years of age.

890
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:50,333
It was my friend Murthy's engagement.

891
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,958
What a party, fun music...

892
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,667
that was on the 12th.

893
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,667
I was here on the 11th.

894
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:02,125
Even on September 11th,
a man has snatched a chain.

895
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,792
Javed.
Let's meet the person who lost their chain.

896
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:09,917
Javed?
- Tell me, sir.

897
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,625
You said someone's chain was snatched?

898
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:14,792
Yes, sir.

899
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,917
I need their details.
- I'll send it right away, sir.

900
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,000
The chain-snatcher could be
 the killer, too.

901
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:29,583
Shobha?

902
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:33,375
You never said your chain went missing
on the day of the murder.

903
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:37,333
I told you, this is not a safe area.
It was only gold covering, so I let it be.

904
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:38,542
How did he look?

905
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:40,833
Turn off the TV!

906
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,458
What did you say?

907
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,417
He had a kerchief tied around his face.
He kept circling the street.

908
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:48,333
Suddenly, he snatched it away.

909
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:51,417
I was so furious, I pelted a stone.
It hit his cycle hard.

910
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:52,667
But he got away.

911
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:56,125
I didn't want to bother with the police,
so I let it go.

912
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,917
What cycle was he riding?

913
01:14:58,292 --> 01:14:59,667
The one with these spikes...

914
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,583
Ranger cycle!

915
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:02,667
Mom!

916
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:05,417
It's a geared cycle, mom.
That's the one I wanted.

917
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,083
Can I come in?
Hi.

918
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,125
Give me a glass of water?

919
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:09,417
You're sure?

920
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:12,167
You mean the kind that shifts gears?

921
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:13,167
Does it have--?

922
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,208
The cycle is made of aluminium.

923
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,667
Control Shimano gears.

924
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,750
Front 80mm.

925
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,250
Just Google 'Ducati 729SX'

926
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,542
You'll find everything there.

927
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,125
I can't believe my mother pelted
that cycle with a stone!

928
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,833
The cassette would have
been bent for sure.

929
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:26,750
A cassette?

930
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,958
Yeah, the thing at the back wheel
with all that teeth.

931
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,000
It's a mountain bike.

932
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,958
Very cheap.
Only 150 thousand.

933
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,417
Everyone at the club
goes trekking in it.

934
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:38,292
Mum, enroll me in the club?
- Let's go?

935
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:39,292
No, thanks.

936
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,167
Wear your helmets.

937
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,708
What if he's not here?

938
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:00,167
Then we'll go to the next club.

939
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,833
But someone who knows the nooks and alleys
of Mogappair is likely to be part of this.

940
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Guys, fast!
Tell me.

941
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:09,125
I'm the trek organiser.
How can I help you?

942
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,250
We need to meet the members individually
regarding a murder investigation.

943
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,583
No, that's not possible.
The kids here are children of big shots.

944
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,375
The kind of kids you're looking for
don't come here.

945
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:20,542
We'll decide that.
- Has everyone come in today?

946
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,292
You've already delayed us by half an hour.

947
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:27,667
This is a police investigation.
If you don't co-operate, it won't end well.

948
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,583
Watch out.
- Even the IG's son is here.

949
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:35,625
We have set rules and regulations.
We only organise trainings and trips.

950
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:38,042
We're not responsible for their
individual actions.

951
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,875
Go enquire them at their homes.

952
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:41,583
I won't allow an investigation here.

953
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:50,875
Agni, what happened?
Is there a problem?

954
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:54,833
Sorry, I guess I interrupted your trek.

955
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,875
Two minutes, we'll finish this fast.

956
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:01,250
A boy who chain-snatched in Mogappair
is among you.

957
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,875
We'll catch him and be on our way.

958
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:07,917
Luna...

959
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,083
It's him.
The fluorescent green T-shirt.

960
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,917
Mr. Trainer, I did pay heed to you
and didn't investigate them individually.

961
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:18,375
He's the son of a VIP, sir.
He's not what you think.

962
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,375
Oh, yes.
I can tell from the way he runs.

963
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,583
Sir, talk to his father first.

964
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:25,667
You're creating problems for us.

965
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:28,250
Calm down, brother.
- Get in, boy!

966
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,500
Are you sure it's him?

967
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:33,583
When I was speaking,
everyone else was looking at each other...

968
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,667
But he was looking at the ground,
because he's the one.

969
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:37,958
I'm sure it's him.
- Move!

970
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:40,125
I haven't done anything.
Please let me go, ma'am.

971
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,125
Shut up!

972
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:49,042
I don't know anything.
Please let me go.

973
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,250
Who are you messing with?
You have no ethics?

974
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,500
You may be educated,
but a woman should behave.

975
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,000
Why have you dragged in my son?

976
01:17:56,292 --> 01:17:58,375
It's a chain-snatching case.

977
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:01,625
Since he's a minor, we must interrogate
with his parents around.

978
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,833
Do you know who I am?
Do you know what business I'm in?

979
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:06,417
Do you know the people I know?

980
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:08,708
You're accusing my son of chain snatching?

981
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:13,083
I don't care who the.... you are.
I shall not swear in front of your son.

982
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,125
[swears in Malayalam]

983
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:15,167
What does that mean?

984
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:17,417
Shut up.
[swears in Malayalam]

985
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,042
Where were you on September 11th?

986
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,583
I don't know what you're talking about.
- He says he doesn't know.

987
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:24,958
You speak to my lawyer.
Let's go, boy.

988
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,125
Wait here.

989
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,667
Let's go.

990
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:31,792
You're leaving already?
Let's drink some coffee.

991
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,167
Hold on.
- I said, let's go.

992
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:36,875
Why do you yell?
Relax, you can leave.

993
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:38,583
I can't let your son go.
- Why?

994
01:18:38,917 --> 01:18:41,000
He was caught red handed
while chain-snatching.

995
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,417
Do you have proof?

996
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,083
Check his pocket.
- No, daddy. Why would I do that?

997
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:50,333
No, daddy.
It's not mine, daddy.

998
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:51,875
This is not mine, sir.

999
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:55,667
I don't know how it got here.
I swear, it's not mine.

1000
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:57,542
Shut up and sit down.

1001
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:01,250
Why do you scold him?
He's putting a lot of effort into acting.

1002
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:03,250
Does it hurt?
Poor boy.

1003
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,458
He hit you too hard.
I put that chain in your pocket.

1004
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:11,292
We convinced your father in two minutes.
It's not hard to convince others.

1005
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,542
So tell us.

1006
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:14,167
Why did you do it?
- Sir...

1007
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,750
When we go out of station for trekking,
I need a lot of money to treat my friends.

1008
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:21,500
My parents don't give me enough.
So I do this sometimes.

1009
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:24,833
I won't do this anymore.
Please let me go, sir.

1010
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:28,917
So you committed the chain-snatch
on September 11th.

1011
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:32,125
Narmada saw you, so you attacked her.

1012
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,833
I did snatch that lady's chain.

1013
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:36,542
But I know nothing else.
- You know nothing else?

1014
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,583
What happened after the chain-snatch?

1015
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:40,292
That night...

1016
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,167
I went to pawn it the next day.

1017
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:17,208
But I realised only in the pawn shop
that it's a gold covering.

1018
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:22,583
My friends said a girl was murdered there,
so I didn't go near that area.

1019
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:31,167
Is this the man
you bumped against in the dark?

1020
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:34,708
I didn't see his face in the
dark, but he had glasses on.

1021
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,833
But you said he didn't see his face
in the dark?

1022
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,833
His glasses fell down and broke
when I ran into him.

1023
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:43,208
While he was searching for it,
I ran away.

1024
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:45,000
I know nothing else, ma'am.

1025
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:47,250
Can you show us where the glasses broke?

1026
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:49,167
Good.

1027
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,833
You think we'll find the broken pieces
after so many days?

1028
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:00,750
What if he's cleared it?

1029
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:03,708
In the dark? Not a chance.
It rained that night.

1030
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,167
So the solid particles must be
buried under the sand.

1031
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:08,750
It must be somewhere in this area.

1032
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:10,542
What do we do with it anyway?

1033
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:12,333
Find the killer.

1034
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,042
Okay, get going.
I'll call you once we're done.

1035
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:17,958
Luna...

1036
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,917
Don't file a case against that kid.
Poor boy.

1037
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:24,292
But let his father know that his life
will be ruined if he does this again.

1038
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,375
And warn the pawn shop guy.

1039
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:29,417
Luna...

1040
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,083
They've recovered 72 pieces of glass.

1041
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,375
72?

1042
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:34,833
Superb.

1043
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:38,458
Send this to lab without delay.
I'll see the report tomorrow.

1044
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:42,292
How can we ready report for so many pieces
by tomorrow? - But we need it.

1045
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:45,542
You heard her. Get to work.
- Yeah, quick.

1046
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:52,625
Guys, of all the pieces we searched,
only this was a power lens.

1047
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,625
It's a -4 short sight lens.

1048
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:59,417
This man cannot function
without this lens.

1049
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:00,958
Did you conduct a DNA profiling?

1050
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:06,208
No, since it was buried in the sand,
we could only collect this report.

1051
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:09,125
Excuse me, sir.

1052
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,458
Sam is adamant
that she must see her father.

1053
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:17,083
We don't know how to console her.

1054
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:19,583
Either we must tell her the truth...

1055
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:23,083
or at least you must tell her.

1056
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,500
Tell us what to do?

1057
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,250
These glasses belong
to a girl called Sagi.

1058
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,750
A woman?

1059
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:31,333
But the boy said he ran into a man.

1060
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,917
Do you have an address, sir?

1061
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,333
Address? One minute.

1062
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:40,417
Please understand.
I can't come today.

1063
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,458
You say that every time.

1064
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:44,125
I'll call you back, madam.

1065
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:46,875
Okay.

1066
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,083
Thank you, alright.

1067
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,625
These glasses were received by Sagi.

1068
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,458
But the order for replacement glasses
was placed by...

1069
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,625
guess who...?
- Who, sir?

1070
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:02,917
Avinashi.

1071
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:06,750
What, Agni? Are you still supporting
that boy Avinashi?

1072
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,208
You call me so many times,
what can I do?

1073
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:26,542
Understand my situation. What can I do?
- No, one minute--

1074
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:30,167
How can I tell her I'm the reason
her father died? I'll come anyway. Bye.

1075
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,417
What do we do now, Agni?
We have proof that he did it.

1076
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:40,958
There's a chance that he's done it.

1077
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,833
I don't know if he's brilliant
or I'm careless.

1078
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,000
Sam?
- Yeah.

1079
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:49,083
I'll handle Avinashi.
You go ahead.

1080
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:57,375
Avinashi is still here, right?
- We sent him away long ago, ma'am.

1081
01:23:58,042 --> 01:23:59,917
Who's gone for surveillance?
- I was supposed to go.

1082
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:02,917
What are you doing here then? Go!
- Okay, ma'am. Sorry.

1083
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,250
Listen, Agni.

1084
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,875
We can't keep fooling Sam
that her father will return.

1085
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:15,000
Telling her that he will never return
is the right thing for everyone.

1086
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:18,167
That's why I called you over and over.

1087
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,917
Don't misunderstand.

1088
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:23,292
Buy her something she likes
and explain patiently.

1089
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,833
She will understand.

1090
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:50,833
Sagi?

1091
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,833
Hi. I need to enquire about Avinashi.
Can I come in?

1092
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:55,208
Come.

1093
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:58,125
Do you live alone?
- Yes.

1094
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:00,333
What do you want to know?
- I'll tell you.

1095
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:01,958
Can I get a glass of water?

1096
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:27,708
Thanks.

1097
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,458
Avinashi said his diary was here.
I came to get it.

1098
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,833
In my house?
- Yes, your bedroom.

1099
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,667
He said it's somewhere there.
A brown diary.

1100
01:25:58,292 --> 01:25:59,458
Found it?

1101
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:01,083
I'm searching for it.

1102
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:06,375
I can't find it here.

1103
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:07,917
He told us it was here.

1104
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,333
Keep it aside if you find it.

1105
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:31,958
Yeah, Luna.

1106
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,333
You asked me to call!

1107
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,750
I found the diary.
- What diary?

1108
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:36,167
Come to Sagi's house.
- Sagi's house?

1109
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,083
I don't know how it got here.

1110
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:43,042
Avinashi...

1111
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:50,458
Interesting.
 You're in love with each other?

1112
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:51,542
What?

1113
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,833
It says you're in a physical relationship.

1114
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,250
I'm sorry, I think it's your
personal diary?

1115
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:00,458
He's written that?

1116
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:01,917
I felt sorry for him.

1117
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:05,083
Me? In a relationship with that paedophile?

1118
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,583
Avinashi is a paedophile?

1119
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:07,833
Sit.

1120
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:10,583
He's undergoing treatment at our hospital.

1121
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:13,958
Whenever he's afraid or insecure
that he might be impotent...

1122
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,375
he tries to misbehave with some child.

1123
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:19,292
That's why the neighbours
 don't talk to him.

1124
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,000
I was the only person to understand
his psychological issues.

1125
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,292
And I tried to help him.

1126
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,042
That was my mistake.

1127
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,250
I'm to blame.

1128
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,417
Hi!

1129
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,583
Please sit.

1130
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,875
Did you see him on 11th night?

1131
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:45,375
Yes.

1132
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:48,708
When I said there's no improvement,
he just left.

1133
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:50,708
That's the night Narmada died.

1134
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,917
I thought he might react in anger.

1135
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,375
You never said anything
when we enquired that day...

1136
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,375
In fact...

1137
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,458
you tried to hide this from me.

1138
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,042
But I didn't see it.

1139
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:04,333
How can I speak about something
I've never seen?

1140
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:07,333
It was not my intention
to hide that diary from you.

1141
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,000
I was worried he might have written
something about his child abuse...

1142
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,167
that could be used against him.

1143
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,250
If there had been anything about murder,
I'd have come forward with it.

1144
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,250
I thought of him as a patient.

1145
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:21,250
But he's a criminal.

1146
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:23,292
My house keys.

1147
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,333
Pervert! Did I sleep with you?
- What happened?

1148
01:28:27,458 --> 01:28:29,375
Get out of my house.
- Calm down, Sagi.

1149
01:28:29,417 --> 01:28:30,375
Why are you yelling?

1150
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,667
Avinashi, your problem can be
easily cured. It's nothing.

1151
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,167
What can be cured?
- Your impotency.

1152
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,417
This woman said so?
- Don't you dare speak about me.

1153
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:41,417
Avinashi!

1154
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:42,792
Calm down.

1155
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,292
You be quiet.

1156
01:28:45,167 --> 01:28:46,500
Get out!

1157
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:48,042
Avinashi!

1158
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,167
Listen to me.

1159
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,708
Get inside.
Just get inside!

1160
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,583
You want to see if I'm potent?

1161
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,250
Isn't that your daughter in there?

1162
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:02,417
I'll show you.

1163
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:05,417
You're bleeding!

1164
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:08,292
Let me go!

1165
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:11,042
Sam!

1166
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:14,292
Sam!

1167
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,042
Avinashi...

1168
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,458
Uncle, come here.

1169
01:29:43,917 --> 01:29:46,833
Let me go.
Why are you doing this?

1170
01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:54,833
I'm really scared.
Come quick, uncle.

1171
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,792
Let me go!

1172
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:10,875
Stop shouting.

1173
01:30:32,458 --> 01:30:34,750
Daddy, come save me!

1174
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:40,000
Daddy! Daddy!

1175
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:50,583
Shit!
- Stop shouting.

1176
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,792
Where are you hiding?

1177
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,583
Okay...

1178
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:32,542
Let's play...

1179
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,458
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1180
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:07,583
Avinashi!

1181
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:09,167
Let me go!

1182
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:26,667
Let me go!

1183
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,083
Let me go...

1184
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:34,583
Shut up or I'll kill you.

1185
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,750
Avinashi!

1186
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:43,292
You're afraid of the dark,
and you call me impotent?

1187
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:03,833
Agni!

1188
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,333
Where are you?

1189
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:31,542
Agni!

1190
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:40,042
Are you okay?

1191
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:50,083
Sir, we've got Avinashi.

1192
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:51,875
And Agni?
- He's fine.

1193
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:54,042
Make sure everything is in order.
- Alright, sir.

1194
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:57,250
You're okay?
Let's go?

1195
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,708
Wow, Luna! Look at my move.
I won.

1196
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,417
I won.
Isn't that nice?

1197
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:20,208
Tea!
- Agni, you just missed it.

1198
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,417
You should have seen it.
- Drink up, sir.

1199
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:25,542
You just got your stitches removed.
Get some rest, man.

1200
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:26,583
I'm fine, sir.

1201
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:29,833
All my decisions are
just like this chess move I made.

1202
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:32,292
You must have seen it
in this Avinashi case.

1203
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,417
Sir, he's just mentally affected.

1204
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:36,250
He's a criminal.

1205
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:39,750
Luna, get that report from Sagi
and link it to the case.

1206
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:43,500
Sagi suspects that Avinashi may have
killed Narmada.

1207
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:45,500
But it's not proven.

1208
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:49,250
His signature at the hospital register
checks out, too.

1209
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:50,292
So what?

1210
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,792
The hospital register timings
are hardly an alibi.

1211
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,333
He could have committed the murder
and then gone, too.

1212
01:34:57,083 --> 01:34:59,250
Agni, I'm allergic to lemon, man.

1213
01:35:00,292 --> 01:35:01,417
What did you say?

1214
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:05,750
Narmada had consumed capsicum on the day
she was killed, and hence a food allergy.

1215
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:08,750
Enjoy your meal, sir.

1216
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:11,875
Welcome, sir.
Please have a seat.

1217
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:14,417
I need to see the CCTV footage.
- That's not possible, sir.

1218
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,208
I'm with the police department.
- Oh...

1219
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:17,917
Let me check
with the manager.

1220
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:19,333
Come, sir.

1221
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:32,250
She was the apple of our eyes.

1222
01:35:34,292 --> 01:35:36,417
And now she's gone!

1223
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:42,250
I killed Narmada.

1224
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,583
The girl has been stabbed in the throat.

1225
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:48,083
We don't know the weapon.

1226
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:51,042
Only that it's penetrated 2 inches deep
and punctured her windpipe.

1227
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,208
Inba is not a good man, doctor.

1228
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:56,542
Narmada was in love with me.

1229
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:03,708
Even in her insurance policy, she's listed
Inba as her nominee, not her parents.

1230
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,833
She trusts him so much.

1231
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,042
I saw a figure moving in the dark
as I crossed 2nd Cross Street...

1232
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:12,917
it was moving hesitantly.

1233
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:15,292
I was suspicious...

1234
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,875
So I followed that figure,
with the knife in my keychain.

1235
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:29,792
Sir, I need to see the CCTV footage
of Narmada withdrawing cash from ATM.

1236
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:33,667
Will you never learn?

1237
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:37,167
I really admire your confidence.

1238
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:40,750
Anyway, just like you asked,
I spoke to the highway department...

1239
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:43,167
here are the details collected
at the tollgate.

1240
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:48,125
Thank you, sir.

1241
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:04,792
[speaking Malayalam]

1242
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:07,625
[speaking Malayalam]

1243
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:12,417
[speaking Malayalam]

1244
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,000
Agni, what are you doing
in my cabin?

1245
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:06,750
We just can't handle it
when the unthinkable happens, eh?

1246
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,500
Have the three of them come?

1247
01:38:10,542 --> 01:38:11,958
Who killed Narmada?

1248
01:38:12,042 --> 01:38:14,750
You commit the murder
and ask me like you know nothing?

1249
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:18,250
But interesting expression.

1250
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:22,458
I need to crack the answer
based on the questions you ask them.

1251
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:24,000
Come on.

1252
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:32,583
We need your help
to find your daughter's killer.

1253
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:37,667
Three people will be entering the box.
Using you, we must find the culprit.

1254
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:39,833
Sorry.

1255
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,000
Don't cry, ma'am.

1256
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:00,667
Ma'am?

1257
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:10,042
What's this new setting?
Lot of changes.

1258
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:19,333
Please. Please.

1259
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:23,625
It's okay.

1260
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,333
Sid.

1261
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:28,042
Your name?

1262
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:30,583
Okay...

1263
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:31,875
Wow!

1264
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:33,458
Sid.

1265
01:39:36,542 --> 01:39:39,833
You're not to blame.
It's the ambiance of the room.

1266
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:44,625
The three of you are suspects
in Narmada's murder.

1267
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,250
We've brought you here
to clear that up.

1268
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:48,333
What's Narmada like?

1269
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:52,208
I've already told you.
I know nothing about it.

1270
01:39:53,292 --> 01:39:56,625
Avinashi expresses his anger
at women who are intimidated by him.

1271
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:59,792
And he tries to abuse them.
So I said he may have done it.

1272
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,125
Narmada is one hot girl!

1273
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:11,458
They're jealous.

1274
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:15,458
She didn't have the privilege
of living with me.

1275
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:16,917
Other than that...

1276
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:18,583
in terms of caste...

1277
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:21,167
cash...

1278
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:23,417
and personality...

1279
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:25,042
I'm the right match.

1280
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,333
If it hadn't been for Inba...

1281
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:30,500
I'd have made it with her!

1282
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,167
I'd have made it.
- Shut up and sit.

1283
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:33,208
Thank you.

1284
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:38,792
What can I say about her?

1285
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,083
Narmada was a good girl.
A simple girl.

1286
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:49,542
She fell in love with Inba
 overlooking caste, salary, status...

1287
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,917
She only cared about character.

1288
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:55,042
But Inba never understood that.

1289
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:02,625
Fine. You may go.

1290
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:05,458
I can't watch this.

1291
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,167
Excuse me, ma'am...

1292
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:15,792
One who commits a sin
 and watches innocently is no human.

1293
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:17,250
Not so fast...

1294
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:18,750
Come upstairs.

1295
01:41:21,667 --> 01:41:22,667
Get in.

1296
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:28,833
Weeping won't change anything.
Sit.

1297
01:41:34,042 --> 01:41:35,750
Son, what did I do?

1298
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:37,708
Why have you made me sit here?

1299
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:40,375
You're a good actor.
Understated.

1300
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:41,875
September 11th.

1301
01:41:42,417 --> 01:41:45,667
Narmada got food allergy
because she ate capsicum at a restaurant.

1302
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,500
But she didn't order it.
You did.

1303
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:54,375
You had a big fight with your daughter
at the restaurant that day.

1304
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,000
Over Inba.

1305
01:41:56,208 --> 01:42:00,875
You went straight to meet Inba,
deciding there's no other way.

1306
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:03,792
You were shocked to see Narmada there.

1307
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,417
You followed Narmada
to see what she was up to.

1308
01:42:09,792 --> 01:42:10,875
It's your ill fortune...

1309
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:14,625
that it got recorded
 in the ATM CCTV camera.

1310
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:20,000
Your car with the Doctor symbol crossed
that lane again at 8:25.

1311
01:42:20,917 --> 01:42:24,292
Knowing just where to stab,
you calmly killed her.

1312
01:42:24,417 --> 01:42:25,875
Professional touch.

1313
01:42:27,042 --> 01:42:29,958
5 inches long, 0.5 cm thick.

1314
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:32,125
An off-beat choice of weapon.

1315
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:41,417
You committed the murder and left
 to your hometown like you knew nothing.

1316
01:42:43,042 --> 01:42:46,833
Then you returned to Chennai
on the same day following Luna's call.

1317
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,625
Here is the proof that your car
crossed the toll gate thrice.

1318
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,750
I had to make sure that you did
commit the murder.

1319
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:57,958
So I conducted a small photo test.

1320
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:02,083
Sorry.

1321
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:11,208
You showed no reaction on seeing
your own daughter covered in blood.

1322
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,625
That moment, I knew for sure.

1323
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:16,500
But one thing I just don't understand...

1324
01:43:16,917 --> 01:43:18,583
how could a father...?

1325
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:22,458
Could a father kill his daughter
over a simple love affair?

1326
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:24,625
Then it struck me.

1327
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:28,708
One thing that
every witness stressed upon...

1328
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:32,958
Narmada's father used his caste influence
and got her into a medical college.

1329
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:39,417
I'm lesser in money, class,
social circle...

1330
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:41,333
Caste.

1331
01:43:41,667 --> 01:43:42,917
I got my clue.

1332
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:46,958
I thought the motive for Narmada's murder
could be her inter-caste relationship.

1333
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,833
That's the test you just attended.

1334
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,250
Don't get it?

1335
01:43:50,583 --> 01:43:52,500
Our target wasn't those three people.

1336
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:53,750
But you.

1337
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:57,500
I was observing your reaction
while they gave their statement.

1338
01:43:58,417 --> 01:44:03,208
I saw so much anger in your face every time
they mentioned the inter-caste love.

1339
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,875
You're so obsessed with caste.

1340
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:10,875
You stabbed your daughter to death
for your caste!

1341
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:13,583
An emotional, cold-blooded murder.

1342
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:18,750
If not for the rain,
we'd have caught you sooner.

1343
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:23,167
With today's advanced forensics,
we'd have locked you up in 48 hours.

1344
01:44:25,708 --> 01:44:27,458
Are you finished, son?

1345
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:28,958
Sit.

1346
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,917
What do you have to say?
Tell me.

1347
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:36,292
Son...

1348
01:44:36,792 --> 01:44:38,792
you won't understand this.

1349
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:46,292
What's most important in the society
over wealth and status...?

1350
01:44:47,375 --> 01:44:48,375
Caste.

1351
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:50,750
Narmada is not just my daughter.

1352
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:52,833
She's a symbol of my caste.

1353
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:54,375
How could I lose that?

1354
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:58,208
Only her death could have saved that.
So I killed her.

1355
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:00,417
I'm a doctor.

1356
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:02,542
A surgeon.

1357
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:07,833
Then why did I marry that illiterate woman?

1358
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,750
Like my father always said...

1359
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:17,708
our seeds mustn't fall
on another caste's field.

1360
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,917
This has been passed on to us
generation after generation.

1361
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,208
Nothing is more sacred to me
than the society.

1362
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:29,958
Till this moment...

1363
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:34,125
what I've done,
has been a source of great pride to me.

1364
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,500
None of this feels wrong to me.

1365
01:45:58,458 --> 01:45:59,458
I don't get it.

1366
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:01,458
They fell in love.

1367
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:02,792
What's wrong in that?

1368
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:05,583
That's right.

1369
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:08,375
Even when your child is in deathbed,
on Facebook and Twitter...

1370
01:46:08,417 --> 01:46:11,417
you people say you only want blood donors
from your own caste.

1371
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:12,792
My mistake.

1372
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,083
You know something...?

1373
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:17,125
This case is the greatest lesson
of my life.

1374
01:46:17,375 --> 01:46:20,375
Because I believed that education
erased caste barriers.

1375
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:22,208
I've been such a fool.

1376
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:25,375
You even use education
as a tool to preach your casteism.

1377
01:46:25,542 --> 01:46:27,917
Everything from matrimony
 to renting out houses...

1378
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:30,792
you advertise boldly asking for people
only from your caste!

1379
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:32,125
Aren't you ashamed?

1380
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:37,167
In spite of all this, few people actually
fall in love and get married...

1381
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,708
and you slaughter them in public!

1382
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:40,458
Or you burn down their whole street.

1383
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:44,042
Either fall in love within your caste,
or be afraid of love.

1384
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,500
How long will you spread fear with blood?

1385
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,958
It will change.
It is changing.

1386
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:54,167
This generation is smashing everything
you've set in stone.

1387
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:58,000
Your caste will diffuse in thin air
in no time, sir.

1388
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:00,542
What did you say?

1389
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:02,333
You feel it's not wrong?

1390
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:04,375
You will feel it.

1391
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:06,833
You have a lot of time in prison
before you die.

1392
01:47:07,917 --> 01:47:09,125
You'll definitely feel it.

1393
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:26,458
Sir...

1394
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:27,708
Get going.

1395
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:31,917
He's justifying it!

1396
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,333
He's not human.

1397
01:47:34,375 --> 01:47:37,250
How? How did you live with
a man like him for so long?

1398
01:47:37,375 --> 01:47:40,458
What do you mean how?
For women, culture comes first.

1399
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,667
That's the tool they use
to suppress us.

1400
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,542
In a country like this,
what can a woman even do?

1401
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:57,542
Why did you kill my Narmada?

1402
01:47:58,125 --> 01:47:59,417
Why did you kill her?

1403
01:47:59,958 --> 01:48:01,542
Why? Why? Why?

1404
01:48:01,917 --> 01:48:04,542
What did we ever do to you?

1405
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:08,625
What did we ever do to you?

1406
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:19,250
Why do you thrust your caste
down our loins?

1407
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Murali...

1408
01:48:35,417 --> 01:48:36,417
Narmada...

1409
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:24,958
This dress looks cute on Sam.

1410
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:26,000
I know.

1411
01:49:26,583 --> 01:49:27,333
Here.

1412
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,875
This is boring.

1413
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,083
How about we play a game
of hide-n-seek?

1414
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:55,125
