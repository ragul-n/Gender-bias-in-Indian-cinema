1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
My name is Dharmaraj,
I owns a small biscuit factory.

2
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,280
My daily routine was to bake biscuits
and deliver them to the stores.

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
Raja!

4
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,840
Here I come, dad.

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Come on. All set to go?

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,520
Sit down.

7
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,200
Annachi's shop is here...

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,280
once I deliver the biscuits,
I'll get you everything you need.

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,760
Annachi, the biscuits are hot
straight out of the oven.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
Everything is hot and fresh.

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
Shall I give you packets from each variety?

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm yet to sell the old stock.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,040
New stock will just pile up with no sales.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,720
Obviously it will not sell.
Everyone knows you sell rice...

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,440
but people will know about the biscuits,
only if they see them.

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,560
- You're right about it.
- He's my son, Annachi.

17
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
- Annachi, please give two biscuits.
- Sure.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Brother, give him a biscuit.

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Hey, you're very brilliant.

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm not brilliant.
It's just that you're dumber.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
Hey, you shouldn't disrespect elders.

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,400
Don't take him wrong,
he's a little straight forward.

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
- Raja, come over here.
- Yes, dad.

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,520
Take these and give it to the people
at the orphanage.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Dad, shouldn't we give money
to the less fortunate.

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
Doesn't matter what we offer,
it's the intention that counts.

27
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay, dad.

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
To sting is the nature of a scorpion.

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,880
But staying calm is my nature,
stated by him.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
- That's why--
- Sister, dad send these over.

31
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,400
Hey, how are you?
Your dad sent these is it?

32
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,880
This is Narasimhan...

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,880
he volunteers to do all the work
at the bakery.

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,600
My dearest friend who doesn't
expect anything in return

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Take a picture. Oh, wait!

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,640
Raja, hold this biscuit in your hand.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
What you've been up to?

38
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,520
Can I take a look?

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,440
- You're drawing a monkey, is it?
- Yes, dad.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
Where did you see a monkey?

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,720
I was inspired by looking at uncle.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
Did you mean, Narasimhan?

43
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,240
Hey--  Hey, it's not right to disrespect
your uncle.

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,040
Stop troubling the kid.

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,400
- Did you draw a tail, son?
- I'm sure he'll do it.

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,680
The orders are decreasing by the day.

47
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
The vendors are not placing orders
like before.

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
Narasimha!

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,160
There are many small biscuit companies
just like ours.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,960
To compete, we should come up
with something new.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,880
- I have an idea. Care to listen?
- What is it?

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,560
Let's dump the entire stock at a shop...

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,560
and turn this place
into a ice-cream company.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Raja, is very fond of ice-cream too.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,160
But you don't get it,
when I ask for an ice-cream.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,080
Fever, sore throat...

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,640
injections are things you scare me with.

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,440
Don't you think, the other parents too
will have the same opinion?

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,520
Explain, how will sell ice-cream to them?

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
The kid's got a point!

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,480
Narasimha, let's come up with a plan to
develop Magic Biscuit Company.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,280
Let's not try to fly high.

63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
Flying high is a good thing, dad.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Do you think so?

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,520
- Is that a sparrow?
- Yes, dad.

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,560
- It looks awesome.
- Dad, let's design biscuits in this manner

67
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
It will attract the kids.

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,480
Wow, you're my dearest.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
That's a brilliant idea.

70
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Let's design them as crows and eagles...

71
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
That's what he said.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,160
But he never mentioned about
the crow or an eagle.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,120
- Fine, carry on with the work.
- Sure, sure.

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
That's a very good idea.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,360
Let's follow Raja's idea.

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,400
Biscuits will be biscuits
to the grown-ups.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
But with kids,
biscuits will charm the kids like toys.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
That's a great idea.
Son, you keep drawing them.

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,840
I'll turn you drawings into biscuits.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,760
Start making die cast to his designs.

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,760
Good boy.

82
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,640
Raja's idea may be a small one.

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,640
But it helped in the development of
Magic Biscuit factory.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
You go ahead and unwrap it,
I don't want to do it.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
Don't be scared.

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,200
Keep it here, I'll do it

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
Get me sugar.

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Deprived of sleep.

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,240
It's imperative for the humans to get
eight hours of sleep.

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
- He eluded sleep, thus hyper-tension.
- Good lord!

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,600
- Aren't you sleepy, son?
- No, dad.

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
Come on, sleep on dad's lap.

93
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,520
Dad, please tell me a story.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,000
You want to hear a story?

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,840
Once lived a small mosquito.

96
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Just like you.

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,320
Once its wings grew,
it wanted to fly across the world.

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,000
So, it flew around the world.

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,280
When it returned home,
it asked its father...

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,000
"Dad, looking at my first flight,
humans applauded my success...

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,960
they were so nice to me."

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,600
To which, the father mosquito replied...

103
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,240
"They we're not applauding your success...

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,400
in fact they were trying to kill you,

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
that's why they were applauding," he said.

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
What do you make of the story?

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
We shouldn't trust anyone.

108
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,000
You should always be very careful.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,080
- Okay, dad.
- You should tread cautiously.

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,240
Once you grow up to be a young man...

111
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll make you the General Manager
of my company.

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,000
- That's my wish. Will you do it?
- Sure, dad.

113
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
Sleep.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,520
Dad, please wake up.

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Dad!

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,560
Dad!

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,720
- Dad!
- What is it? What happened?

118
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,200
Hey.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
Dharma!

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Dharmaraj may have died...

121
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,600
but my hard work didn't go in vain.

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Magic biscuits were very popular
in the market.

123
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Business grew larger...

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,440
so did the number of employees.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,440
A small bakery turned into a huge factory.

126
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Do you know who is the Managing director
of the company now?

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,840
'Biscuit'

128
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,160
"Mighty Tamilan in the grasp of victory"

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,720
"Is about to rule this world."

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,920
"You're gracious with your peeps
like they're your family"

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,440
"you shower them generously
with love and wealth."

132
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,720
"Sharp as the blazing sun,
you shine over the people"

133
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,560
"basking them in your shadow
like a guardian angel."

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,360
"Mighty as a warrior
with the heart of gold"

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,080
"you're an embodiment of a warrior
blessed upon us."

136
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,160
Raja was deceived too,
just like you people did.

137
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Raja is just an employee over there.

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,920
Dad, you should always be a support to me.

139
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
Hey, it's going to be fun.

140
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,520
Raja, have you heard the news?

141
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
Hey, he'll take time to finish.
It's better you tell me.

142
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,280
They're changing the dye machine.

143
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,560
We've been given three days leave
until its fixed.

144
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,480
Let's leave before the management
change their mind.

145
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,600
- Come on, let's go.
- Let go of my hand.

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Hey, the biscuit is going off the line.

147
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,480
- It's making too much noise.
- I have no idea.

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
- Ask them check the oil level.
- Okay.

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
Once MD arrives,
I'll get his approval and send the mail.

150
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
What happened, Ganesh?

151
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
Production machine has broke down.

152
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
So, we've blocked it
and ordered a new machine.

153
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,760
Ganesh, if we stop production
for three days...

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,200
that'll incur a huge loss to the company.

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Oh, you think so?

156
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
Come over here and take a look
at this.

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,360
If we dispatch defective product,
company's reputation will be ruined.

158
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Ganesh, the problem is not with
the machine.

159
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,280
The dye is defective.

160
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,240
Moreover, we're going to stop this design
in three months.

161
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,800
It's an unnecessary expense to buy
a new machine.

162
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
You're just a supervisor,
stay within your limits.

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Don't spare your advise to
a Senior Manager.

164
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Sorry, sir.

165
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,800
- You want well-shaped biscuits, right?
- Yes.

166
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
- Give me an hours' time.
- Please!

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
Raja, is it fixed?

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Take a look,
hope they're in good shape.

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,720
Okay, come on, let's go.

170
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
Hurry up, dude.

171
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
Boss, you have to give us...
give us off.

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
And you're the one who can make it happen.

173
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
Ganesh, sir,
you said we'll be give three days off.

174
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Shall we take an extra day as off.

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
- Who said, you're getting off?
- You did.

176
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Stupid, the dye machine has
started working.

177
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
Get to work.

178
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
In fact, clock two hours overtime.

179
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
We should've kept our mouth shut.

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
Raja.

181
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,520
Pah! You reek of beer, damn it.

182
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,120
Getting high right in the morning.

183
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,680
You guys will never learn.

184
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,480
- Son.
- What is it, dear?

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
I can't bear the toothache.

186
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,680
Stop lurking when you have toothache.

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,760
It's better you stay put.

188
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,760
I have to go to the clinic...

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,920
if you can spare 500 bucks,
I'll get to it.

190
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,720
I thought you had toothache,
but that doesn't hinder you chewing peas.

191
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,520
It's better you leave,
before I spit on you.

192
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Making excuses for money to gamble.

193
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,920
Don't you dare, I'll smack you.

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,280
Oh, really?

195
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
You can't dare touch me.

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
- I'll smack you damn it.
- I dare you.

197
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,520
Why do you have to resort to violence
at your old age?

198
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
It's not fair that he's using my underwear.

199
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
This is my underwear.

200
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
I've done a lot of things wearing it.

201
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
- What have you done?
- Dance!

202
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,720
Is this an underwear or a strainer?

203
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,040
It's got too many holes.

204
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,040
For such a silly thing,
you guys are locking horns with each other.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,640
I suggest you guys wear
plastics bags instead.

206
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Damn!

207
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
How are you old man?

208
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,680
Not great, this knee pain is killing me.

209
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,040
I've got you medicines.

210
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,160
Shall I help you apply it?

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,920
Please follow the instructions given
by the physiotherapist.

212
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,840
Why the hell are you bathing
in the kitchen?

213
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,320
Don't mock me.
My hands are shivering.

214
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,640
You were a brat during your childhood...

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,880
don't waste water when there's scarcity.

216
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,880
Here you go, drink using a straw.

217
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Give me that.

218
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,240
How's your fever?

219
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,360
Take these medicines and have fruits.

220
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,880
Gran, you can't keep away from cosmetics,
is it?

221
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,720
- I'm your sister, don't mock me.
- Sister?

222
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,200
- Take them and distribute in the B block.
- Sure.

223
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,200
- Check if everything you need is here.
- Can you breathe?

224
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
- Is it hurting?
- Sister!

225
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,840
- Welcome, Raja. I've been waiting for you.
- Good Morning.

226
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Jesus is always with you.

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,000
- You called me about an emergency.
- I'll explain. It's interesting.

228
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,160
Here you go.

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,560
I called you,
so that you can meet this granny.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,520
They found this old woman standing alone
at the bus stand near Sivan Temple.

231
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,560
She has been staying at that temple
for past 2-3 days.

232
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Last afternoon, she went to the kids
who were playing at the temple...

233
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,440
and asked them if they'd like to
hear a story.

234
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,760
Kids eagerly followed the granny.

235
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Suspecting granny's actions,
people over there caught her...

236
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,680
and inquired about her whereabouts.

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But the granny didn't utter a word.

238
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,520
The people were wondering if they should
complain to the police...

239
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,280
the roof of the temple came down.

240
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Everyone was shell-shocked!

241
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,640
Did the granny knew this in prior
and was saving the kids from it?

242
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,040
Or it was just a coincidence,
remains a question.

243
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,520
In Bible, they're called,
"Guardian Angels."

244
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
God, to convey the impending danger...

245
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,960
uses few signs or prevents them
through other human beings.

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Similarly, she has some kind of
divine power.

247
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Granny!

248
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,120
Gran, where are you from?

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,360
Raja, I have a small request.

250
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Tell me, sister.

251
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm heading to Vellore in regards to
orphanage's land litigation.

252
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,360
It'll be great if you could stay the night
and take care of the place.

253
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,080
I've already arranged for someone.

254
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
But they can only stay until the evening.

255
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,840
- Oh!
- So, please...

256
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
Sister, please don't embarrass me.

257
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,720
- Just order me to stay.
- But still...

258
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
- I'll take care of it.
- God bless you!

259
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Thank you. Thank you.

260
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,920
You people must be surprised
'cause of this sudden board meeting.

261
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,720
I'm here to share three good news.

262
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Raja, I've heard about Sun News
and Jaya News...

263
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
never heard about Good News!

264
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,080
Are they planning to start a new channel?

265
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,360
We're upgrading our factory
as big as this one.

266
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,600
It's a 500 crore project.

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,200
Thank you.

268
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,280
Raja, don't you think it's unnecessary?

269
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,960
Hey, it's a good thing that we're building
a huge factory.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,120
It's hard to clean this small factory.

271
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,680
How do we maintain such a big factory?

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
May be we can tell them you're finding it
hard to clean...

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
and get them to cancel
the 500 crore project.

274
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,880
Do you think,
they'll hear us out?

275
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,280
- Oh, no!
- Whack him.

276
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
The second good news.

277
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,080
My daughter Leah will be the Vice President
of this new factory.

278
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,560
This good news...

279
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm going to choose one among you as
the General Manager.

280
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
That's no one but a person who has worked
hard for this company.

281
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,840
Has been with us day in and out.

282
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
A well-wisher of this company.

283
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
He's been longing to get a good posting.

284
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,480
- Dude, he's talking about you.
- Thanks, dude.

285
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
- That's none other than...
- Come on, let's go

286
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Ganesh!

287
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,080
- Yes!
- Ganesh?

288
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,600
Ganesh, come this side.

289
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Thanks everybody.

290
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,520
Come on, congratulations!

291
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,920
- Take your seat.
- Thank you so much, sir.

292
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,520
Thanks for the responsibility.
I'll definitely keep it up.

293
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,000
Raja, come over here.

294
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,120
- Ganesh, take Raja in your team.
- Sure, sure.

295
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,160
- He's very brilliant.
- Definitely, sir.

296
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,440
Your brilliance has saved the company
from spending 200 crores.

297
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,200
Keep it up.

298
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,320
Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming.

299
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,920
Now, everyone get back to work.

300
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,160
I'm really sorry, dude.

301
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,800
Didn't get you paid yesterday?

302
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,640
It's feels awful to see him
take your place.

303
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,080
What about the old stock?

304
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,560
- Clear them all.
- Sure, I'll do it.

305
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,480
Hey, madam is here.

306
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,560
Congratulations, Ms.Vice President.

307
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,560
Don't wish me like a politician.

308
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,600
Do you know how people wish each other
in London?

309
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,760
- Are you free in the evening?
- What do you have in mind?

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,720
We're meeting at the Park hotel
in the evening.

311
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm meeting all my college mates.

312
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,000
- You have to definitely be there.
- Leah, I can't come.

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,800
You're coming!

314
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
Enjoy!

315
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
- Leah, I'm not coming.
- See you tonight.

316
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Leah!

317
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
People say, "If God closes one door,
he's bound to open another."

318
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,800
It works perfectly in your case.

319
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,480
I don't get it.

320
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,640
Twenty years of your father's hard work...

321
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
was consumed by Narasimha.

322
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,360
Similarly, you gotta consume his 20 years
of hard work.

323
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,840
Hey, moron!

324
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,680
He's not a pill for me to consume.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,480
Guide me the right way.

326
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,600
Raja, this is definitely the right way.

327
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
There'll be booze at the party.

328
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,400
- You make sure to score her tonight.
- Correct!

329
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
Knuckle head.

330
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,640
It's not ethical.

331
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,600
Don't you try out clothes before buying.
It's just like that.

332
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,000
Raja, only if you become MD,
we'll get promoted as GM.

333
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,840
- There's something you need to remember.
- What?

334
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
Here you go.

335
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,840
What do I do with it?

336
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,480
When you return from the party,
fill it with booze.

337
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,000
You were just talking about
an upgrade in life.

338
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,400
- Soon, you stooped low.
- Okay, you don't have to.

339
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,040
Hey, what the hell are you wearing?

340
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Do you wash these clothes
in a washer or a blender?

341
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,320
- They're so skimpy.
- That's party wear and in trend.

342
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,880
I'm throwing a party for becoming
the Vice President.

343
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,320
Do you like it?

344
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,800
It's so loud in here,
doesn't your ears hurt?

345
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,120
Hi, guys. Meet my childhood friend.

346
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,280
- Raja!
- Come on, enjoy.

347
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
- Okay, fatso.
- Cheers!

348
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

349
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,120
Did you study or learn to drink at London?

350
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
You're gulping it down.

351
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,920
Hey, that's how you take a shot.

352
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
Is that so?

353
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,680
So, are you still single or seeing someone?

354
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,880
I'm dabbling around.
But I'm still single.

355
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,800
- Oh!
- Okay, now it's your turn.

356
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
You have to gulp it one go.

357
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,680
- Leah, I'm not used to it.
- Come on, you can do it.

358
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,240
- I don't want.
- Hey, hold him down.

359
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,880
Hey, lock him down.

360
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey--  Hey, Leah please hear me out.

361
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,000
- Leah!
- Come on, Raja, you can do it.

362
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,240
It's freaking burning like hell.

363
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,480
- Come on, Raja.
- You're pouring it like it's medicine.

364
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,520
Come on, let's get on to the dance floor.

365
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,320
"Let the dance go on forever"

366
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,840
"Get drenched in the musical shower"

367
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,640
"Bid farewell to deadlines"

368
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,240
There'll be booze at the party.

369
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,400
You make sure to score her tonight.

370
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,240
Leah, what the hell did you do to me
last night?

371
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,920
Are you looking for this? Here you go.

372
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,480
I think it was your first time, last night.

373
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,080
It was amazing, you nailed it.

374
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
It was a unforgettable night.

375
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,480
I've never enjoyed so much in my life.

376
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
My dear sister...

377
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,960
I did tell  you that we'll get a scapegoat
if we party regularly.

378
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,600
You didn't believe me.
Look at him, we got our scapegoat.

379
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,080
Cheers!

380
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Shame on you!

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,520
That's enough, the prank is over.

382
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,560
Did you just say, prank?

383
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,400
You guys go overboard sometimes.

384
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,520
Defects of collaborations.

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,120
Get out. Get out, damn it.

386
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,160
Hey--  hey, no, no.

387
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,960
- What is the time?
- It's five 'O' clock.

388
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,560
How come it's so bright
five in the morning?

389
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,320
Hey, It's five in the evening.

390
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,760
We wrapped up the party
six in the morning.

391
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,640
Get ready soon.
We have to head to another party.

392
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
They're going to party again?

393
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,160
If I keep this going,
then my liver will cease to function.

394
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
- Hello.
- Hello, Anitha speaking.

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
Who, Anitha?

396
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Nun must've mentioned...

397
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm waiting for you after my morning shift.

398
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,520
When will you be here?

399
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,440
I'm leaving.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

400
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,840
- Hello, please come sooner.
- Sure, I'll be there.

401
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,440
Damn!

402
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
Raja has arrived.

403
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,240
Hey, that's a nice watch.

404
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,960
Did you whisk it from a guy?

405
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,160
What? Hey, hello... you were supposed to
be here at 5pm.

406
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,080
But it's 6pm now,
you're one hour late.

407
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I have to be somewhere.

408
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,680
Listen woman,
don't command me like you're my wife.

409
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,200
You're accusing me as if I was drunk
and couldn't wake up due to hangover.

410
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,360
I had too many meetings to attend
at the office.

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,640
You mean to say, I'm jobless?

412
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,560
I think you might.

413
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,840
You'll either order take out
or create tik-tok videos.

414
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,600
- Hello!
- You're getting a call.

415
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
Hello...

416
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,400
please give the patient medicine
to control the blood pressure.

417
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,000
Once I get there will check
the scan report...

418
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,200
and proceed with the treatment.

419
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,800
Sorry, I'm running late.
I will be there in fifteen minutes.

420
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,880
Oh, no. I messed around with
a Covid warrior.

421
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm sorry. I didn't know you are a doctor.

422
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
Hello, I'm sorry.

423
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Please hear me out.

424
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,320
- Raja!
- Tell me moron.

425
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,520
You've messed with the wrong person.

426
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,840
You have no idea.
She's a very successful doctor.

427
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
Enough, stop waving your hands.

428
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,040
The people at the orphanage are very old.

429
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,280
Please be a bigger person and help us.

430
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
I've told you a million times that
it's a ancestral property.

431
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,400
The old man just gave his word.
It was not registered.

432
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,480
His son has original documents with him.

433
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,240
He's under debt,
so he's selling the property.

434
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,360
Both the buyer and the seller
are giving me a commission...

435
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,240
to vacate the property.

436
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,720
Please let me do my job.

437
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,880
I'll give you a weeks' time.

438
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,320
Vacate the place and get going.

439
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,480
Cold breeze and the sky is filled
with stars.

440
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,640
Beautiful moon though.

441
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,640
If only I get to gulp down a peg,
it'll be great.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,160
Make a wish which suits your age, old hag.

443
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,360
Don't ask for too much that you can't take.

444
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,960
They're composing tunes
through their snores.

445
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,480
He's starting from tor
and he ends with bur.

446
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,760
Whereas  he ends with bur
and begins with dor.

447
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,920
I won't be able to sleep in this noise.

448
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,560
Instead, I'll go deaf.

449
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Let me go outside.

450
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Once there lived a king.

451
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,360
- He worried about not having kids.
- Who's she telling stories to?

452
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,160
- Just then a seer arrived at his kingdom.
- The dogs are howling.

453
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Granny, to whom are you narrating
the story?

454
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm narrating it to my grandson.

455
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Grandson? I don't see anyone over here.

456
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,200
He passed long ago.

457
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
Whenever I think of him...

458
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,360
I narrate a story,

459
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,720
and that gives me peace.

460
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,240
People think I'm crazy.

461
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,200
It doesn't matter to me anymore.

462
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,240
Gran, don't worry about it.

463
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,960
Why don't you consider me
as your grandson?

464
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,880
So, shall I tell you a story?

465
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,440
It's too late for a story.

466
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,880
Fine, go ahead.

467
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,480
In the greatest Kingdom of Ujjain...

468
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,160
there was a place named Hastinapuram.

469
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Earthly resources, water resources...

470
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,320
it was a nation rich and content
with resources.

471
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,280
There once lived a King.

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,880
Just like you.

473
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,320
[Praised Sloganeering]

474
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,840
Hey, be careful the flowers are hurting
my eyes.

475
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,200
Just 'cause I called you a King,

476
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,840
don't start imagining too much.

477
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,920
There was no welcome party.

478
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,280
Neither he was accompanied by soldiers.

479
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,440
In fact, he didn't even a palanquin.

480
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,640
He was a king for namesake.

481
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,960
So, even in stories the name "Raja"
doesn't weigh much.

482
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,600
No, no... he was a potential candidate
to become a King.

483
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,280
Unfortunately, he's reduced to a commander.

484
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,200
Do you know who is the King of that nation?

485
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,360
Please sit down.

486
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,080
- Commander.
- Your Highness.

487
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,000
What is the result if you add six and six?

488
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,240
It's twelve.

489
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,000
If Aaru (river) and Aaru collide,
there will be flood.

490
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,760
Oh, God, that's hilarious!

491
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
Oh, no!

492
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,160
Commander, why aren't you laughing?

493
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,160
Be happy that I didn't smack you
with my shoes.

494
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,360
Are you speaking against his highness?

495
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Hey, fawner. I'm talking to you,
damn it.

496
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,000
Why are you creating a rift between us?

497
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Stop it!

498
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,400
For the crime of controlling
your laughter...

499
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm stripping you off the commander's post.

500
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,360
Your Highness!

501
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,680
Your punishment is to collect horse shit
for the next three days.

502
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,880
What if the horse doesn't shit?

503
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,680
Then he'll have to collect elephant shit.

504
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,320
Oh, no!

505
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,440
To clear your doubt,
you've doubled my punishment.

506
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,360
Your Highness, please crack another joke,
I'll definitely laugh.

507
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
This is my command.

508
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,840
So, is my decree.

509
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,200
I'd rather wipe that shit on your face.

510
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,880
Why should I carry his shit?

511
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,560
Listen, weren't you punished.

512
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Why are you making me do it?

513
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,920
There's lots to collect.
Stop whining and keep moving.

514
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
You don't make any sense at all.

515
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,600
Why the hell are you smelling it?

516
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,120
You should be rightfully ruling
the kingdom.

517
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,040
It's embarrassing to see your collect shit.

518
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,360
It's funny that you don't find your looks
embarrassing.

519
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,520
But you feel embarrassed
'cause I'm collecting shit.

520
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
Mottappa!

521
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,320
Damn, it's a shame.

522
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,880
What the hell are you wearing?

523
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't even dare to appear in front of
Sathyaraj, sir.

524
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
He'll tear you apart.

525
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,560
I don't know what to do.

526
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,720
The hair doesn't grow.

527
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,320
Instead grow a beard and be content.

528
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
Or wear this basket on your head.

529
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Dude, stop it.

530
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
Hazard alarm is blaring. It's a war.

531
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,200
It's a war.

532
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,080
- Help me collect shit, you morons.
- Mighty soldiers are on the way.

533
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,960
You morons, don't try and evade.

534
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
Don't run, damn it.

535
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,040
It's shame they're soldiers of war.

536
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
What happened, Minister?

537
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,440
Kalakayers has waged a war.

538
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,880
Give me that.

539
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,200
If you keep looking,
it'll scare you.

540
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Plan decisively and prepare for war.

541
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,320
Nations loomed by locusts and Kalakayers...

542
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,320
has always been destroyed.

543
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,600
Hey, he's already shit scared.

544
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,800
Don't scare him more.

545
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Kalakayers are dangerous people.

546
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,320
They don't see a difference young or old,
but brutally rape them.

547
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Is it true?

548
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,280
If it's true,
are you planning to join the enemy?

549
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,280
I'll offer you as sacrifice
before we go to war.

550
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,240
Respected Ministers,
call for an emergency meeting.

551
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,080
Inform everyone,
it's the King's order.

552
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,960
Mottappa, how many soldiers do you need
to fight the enemy?

553
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,960
Your Highness, I need 500 soldiers.

554
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,720
Why do you need 500 soldiers to fall on
the enemy's feet?

555
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
It's enough, if you go alone.

556
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,520
Veersimha, care to share an idea.

557
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
It doesn't matter if it's an army
of thousands...

558
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,640
Obviously, it doesn't matter
'cause you'll run and hide.

559
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,600
It's us, who are you going to be
on the front line.

560
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,800
- Former commander!
- Your Highness...

561
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,800
a troop's strength is its commander.

562
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
If we hack the enemy commander's head...

563
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,600
the troops will run haywire.

564
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
Bravo!

565
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,320
That was an interesting idea.

566
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,640
Father, let's follow Rajasimha's strategy.

567
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,400
Okay, let's follow his strategy.

568
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,400
Get all the troops ready for the war.

569
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,760
It's the King's command. Get going.

570
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,720
Hail your Highness!

571
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,480
- Mottappa.
- Tell me

572
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
First let's move the people to safety.

573
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,400
I'll send my family away to safety.
I'll return soon.

574
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,040
- I'll go and wear my underwear.
- Hey, morons!

575
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,280
- Close the main door.
- To hell with it, If I get hurt...

576
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,920
- then I can't answer to my 3rd wife.
- These guys are hopeless.

577
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
I am coming

578
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,160
It looks like horses are running
on a treadmill.

579
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,640
It looks like they're coming from the sky.

580
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,200
It's even emerging from the ground.

581
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,560
It's a new horse brand binoculars.

582
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,320
They're unaware it was just a sticker.

583
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,160
- Are they close?
- Nope they've shrunk.

584
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Damn fawner.

585
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,240
It was a horse sticker on the
new binoculars.

586
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,960
You were unaware and got everyone panicked.

587
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,960
Instead of preparing for war,
you guys are whiling away time.

588
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,080
Welcome, Your Highness.

589
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,160
Do you know what you're trusted commander
has done?

590
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,280
You'll speak high of me.
It's better I'll speak for myself.

591
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,000
I didn't do anything huge.

592
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,560
I just wrote a threatening letter...

593
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,280
- and sent it across through a pigeon.
- You sent a message?

594
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,280
They read the letter and ran away.

595
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,760
Your Highness, he's lying

596
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
Let me take a look.

597
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
Your Highness--

598
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
He's an utter fool.

599
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,880
I don't see anyone.

600
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,280
Has everyone ran away?

601
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
Your highness, it's right here.

602
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,120
Hey, hey...

603
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,640
I appreciate your presence of mind.

604
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,840
Are you talking about the sticker
he chewed on?

605
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,040
If he had encountered the enemy,
he would've chewed them to pulp.

606
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,200
He finished chewing...

607
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,560
not sure when he's going to spit it out.

608
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
- You come this side.
- Sure, you too.

609
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,920
Bravo! For your bravery...

610
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,360
and the way you chased away the enemy.

611
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,720
You'll be the successor to my Kingdom.

612
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,400
Be ready, tomorrow is your coronation.

613
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,800
- Thank you.
- Hail, commander.

614
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

615
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,920
Gran, humanity has lost its course.

616
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
Deceit and betrayal has taken over
the world.

617
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,800
Son, don't think of it like that.
Just sit down.

618
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,240
I'm yet to finish the story.

619
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,680
Do you know what happened
during the coronation?

620
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,360
Who made the arrangements?

621
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
It was me, Highness.

622
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,200
- How's the banner?
- It's fantastic.

623
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,280
Fantastic!

624
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
It's absolutely fantastic.

625
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,400
Cut out--

626
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,440
Hey!

627
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,480
[Bahubali]

628
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,640
Bahubali!

629
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
Firstly clutch the rope.

630
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm wearing a mask 'cause of Corona,
not to pose as Bahubali.

631
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
It's Rajasimha!

632
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,320
Rajasimha!

633
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,440
Bravo, Rajasimha!

634
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,240
- Did you see that?
- Bravo!

635
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,840
Fantastic!

636
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,680
Rajasimha!

637
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,720
Give me your leg.

638
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,960
Hey!

639
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,680
Let-- let go of my leg.

640
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,320
Hey, I said let go of my leg.

641
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,320
Oh, damn. It stinks like shit.

642
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,280
It is shit indeed.
I was waiting to wipe it elsewhere...

643
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,040
but you grazed it on your bald head.

644
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
Let go of it,
it'll stink, damn it.

645
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,240
Rajasimha, please stop.

646
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Oh, no!

647
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
Your Highness,
I have a request to make.

648
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,480
Tell me, Simha!

649
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,280
Just 'cause there are banners erected
at every nook and corner...

650
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
it's affecting the people
and is a danger to life.

651
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,280
It'll be great during your rule,
erecting banners should be banned.

652
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,520
Moreover, a great ruler
doesn't need publicity.

653
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,960
A King's duty is to protect the lives
of his people.

654
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,200
But you've fulfilled it on my behalf.

655
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Bravo, Rajasimha!

656
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,560
Your highness!

657
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,760
I think it's going to rain.
Let's finish the coronation ceremony.

658
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,840
Patience!

659
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Rajasimha, come over here.

660
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,120
Rajasimha, you've worked hard
for this nation.

661
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,760
It's my duty to give you a fair chance.

662
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
That being said, on my birthday...

663
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,920
you two should come up with an idea
for the development of this nation.

664
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll pick the best idea among the two.

665
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,600
And that person will be the successor
to my kingdom.

666
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,320
Until then I'm putting the coronation
on hold.

667
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,120
Your Highness, you've already declared...

668
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,760
This is my command.

669
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,560
So, is my writ.

670
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,640
Everyone was happy on hearing
the King's announcement.

671
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,600
And it was raining money.

672
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
Raining money?

673
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,200
Gran, our city is depraved of regular rain.

674
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,560
We're dependent on water tankers.

675
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,800
Anything can happen in a story.

676
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
It'll be awesome, if things happen
just the way it does in stories.

677
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
Did you hear the bells ringing?

678
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
It's the ice cream guy,
I owe him money.

679
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,600
You please go to bed.

680
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
- How many times should I repeat it?
- MD is calling you

681
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
Tell them, I'm coming.

682
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,640
Don't speak over the phone at work.

683
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,040
Hey, they've summoned us for a meeting.

684
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Sure, let's go.

685
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,360
May I come in, sir!

686
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,880
Hey, close the door, damn it.

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Close the door, damn it.

688
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,200
Hey, what's wrong?

689
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,600
He's asking us to get inside
and then close the door.

690
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,400
Get in!

691
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,680
Close that door, immediately!

692
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Sir, why are you sitting in the dark
like a ghost?

693
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,640
Shall I switch on the light?

694
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,960
No, no... dad just underwent laser surgery.

695
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,800
That's why we're holding the meeting
in dark.

696
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,080
Dude, is this really our company's meeting?

697
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,880
Or it is an illicit meeting?

698
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,920
Don't hurt me.

699
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,560
Baldy, go and get a chair.

700
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,960
What was that noise?
Be careful, it's dark.

701
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,440
Thank goodness,
no one knows it was me.

702
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
It's very dark.

703
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,160
Oh, no!

704
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,120
- I just said to be careful. Was it Manohar?
- Yes, sir.

705
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,240
- Hey, get me some water.
- Okay, sir.

706
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,160
I kept water on the table.

707
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,280
That's my head, damn it.

708
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,080
- Oh, no!
- I regret hiring this moron.

709
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,920
Hey, give it to me.

710
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,400
What is that noise?

711
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
Someone's having tobacco.

712
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,200
Is that Manohar?

713
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,520
Oh, no! That wasn't me.

714
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,760
I holding this meeting,

715
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,680
'cause entire nation has been
affected with Corona.

716
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,200
The stock is piling up
and it will incur major loss.

717
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
I don't what to do.

718
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,080
Sir, it's very simple.

719
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,920
We'll advertise,
if they buy two packs of biscuits,

720
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,760
one cream box will come as free.

721
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,640
People will be drawn to the offer.

722
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,120
That's a great idea.

723
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,120
Marketing team,
how do you like the idea?

724
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,640
It's an awesome idea,
will definitely work.

725
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,640
Sir, it's a silly idea.

726
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,400
This will just clear 50% of the stock.

727
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,240
Instead of giving the cream box as free...

728
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,360
let's use the cream in between the
biscuits and sell them as cream-biscuits.

729
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,800
The entire stock will be sold.

730
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,760
Hey, this sounds even better.

731
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
What nonsense, sir?

732
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,720
Cream-biscuit is an old idea.

733
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,760
It's a great idea to get rid of the stock
without spending extra.

734
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,800
Marketing team, how's the idea?

735
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,320
Okay, sir.

736
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,040
Follow Raja's idea and start working.

737
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Raja, please sit down.

738
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
You've worked hard for this company.

739
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,120
But I've never appreciated you.

740
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,640
I'm going to give you a chance.

741
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,560
In order to develop our new factory...

742
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,840
prepare a plan and make a presentation
on my birthday.

743
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll pick the best among the
two presentations...

744
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,840
and promote them as the General Manager.

745
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,440
Sir, you did declare that I'm the GM during
the board meeting.

746
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,440
It was me who declared, right?

747
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
And now I'm changing it.

748
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,160
You can go.

749
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,880
- Sir!
- What is it?

750
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,560
- Sir, please give me your hands.
- Here you go.

751
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,280
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

752
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,600
- Okay.
- Thanks, sir.

753
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,120
Hello.

754
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Road accident at Chromepet bridge

755
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,280
ATM cash vehicle
Send recovery van urgently

756
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,640
- Sir, sir...
- Please help us.

757
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,040
Sir, please help us with it.

758
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,120
Please pick up the money.

759
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,360
Hey, Lakshmi, look it's raining money.

760
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,840
I'm already on it.

761
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
It was raining money.

762
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
Raining money?

763
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,480
Gran, our city is depraved of regular rain.

764
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,880
We're dependent on water tankers.

765
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,080
Anything can happen in a story.

766
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,520
It's crisp new currency.

767
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,240
Pick them all, no one else should get it.

768
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,880
See, it is flying

769
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,400
Hey, gold coin

770
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Take it

771
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,160
He was a potential candidate
to become a King.

772
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,760
Rajasimha, you've worked hard for the sake
of this nation.

773
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,080
It's my duty to give you a fair chance.

774
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,960
That being said, on my birthday...

775
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,280
you two should come up with an idea
for the development of this nation.

776
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,280
I'll pick the best idea among the two.

777
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,040
And that person will be the successor
to my kingdom.

778
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,720
It'll be awesome, if things happen
just the way it does in stories.

779
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,240
You've worked hard for the sake
of this company.

780
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,000
But I've never appreciated you.

781
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,440
I'm going to give you a chance.

782
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,440
In order to develop our new factory...

783
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,680
prepare a plan and make a presentation
on my birthday.

784
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
I'll pick the best among the
two presentations...

785
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,120
and promote them as the General Manager.

786
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,280
Gran's stories are coming true.

787
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,240
- Granny!
- Raja has arrived.

788
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,800
- Hey... Raja has arrived.
- Don't rush me...

789
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,560
- you guys are behaving like monkeys.
- What did you get us?

790
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,200
We never knew you loved us so much.

791
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,280
You got everything for us...

792
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,560
- granny might be upset, you know.
- Yeah, right.

793
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,000
Didn't you get anything for gran?

794
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,800
Gran is not going to be upset,
but you guys.

795
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,200
Because, I got everything for granny.

796
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,960
- Give it back.
- Oh, damn, it's all gone.

797
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,120
What's in your hand?

798
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,560
- An empty cover.
- You can keep that.

799
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,760
Granny!

800
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,080
Gran, it's all yours.

801
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,400
Eat all you want and tell me
a fun-filled story.

802
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,560
No Raja, I'm busy reading a biography
on a saint.

803
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,480
I don't have time to tell you a story.

804
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,720
The stories you demand can only be narrated
during the night.

805
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,000
Not now.

806
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,240
So, it has to be night.

807
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,480
Hold on a moment.

808
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,840
It's night now, get to bed, damn it.

809
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,280
It goes for you too,
get to bed, damn it.

810
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,880
Look, it's night now.

811
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,400
Everyone has started to sleep.

812
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,800
It does look like night.
Please tell me a story.

813
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,800
I always narrate stories to my grandson
during the night.

814
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,200
I can't tell you a story now.

815
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
Gran, what do you expect me to do
until the nightfall?

816
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,200
- Keep waiting!
- I'll break your jaw.

817
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,760
Enough Raja, you go to bed.

818
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,040
Gran, how can I sleep?

819
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,320
You promised to tell a story.

820
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,880
Oh, yeah, you did ask for a story.

821
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,600
There's no need for a story...

822
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,480
we're really tired. Switch off the lights
and get to bed.

823
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,280
If you're tired, you get to bed.

824
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,400
Why the hell are you striking
weird poses?

825
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,880
- Shall I drown in the pond?
- I can't bear the cold.

826
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,640
Oh, God!

827
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,360
He turns the day into night
and forces us to sleep.

828
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,800
And during the night he's killing us
by not letting us sleep.

829
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,200
- Shut down that barking radio.
- Oh, no!

830
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,520
Gran, you please go ahead.

831
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,480
In our country after the rule
of Britishers...

832
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,960
the hereditary of Royals were destroyed.

833
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,840
The only royal who survived
hailed from Chinnamannur.

834
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,920
The land and estates that royal owned...

835
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,360
was managed by a granny who belonged
to their family.

836
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,960
Three men conspired to kidnap that granny.

837
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,440
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

838
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,600
- The story is no good.
- This story won't work out.

839
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,680
You're right.

840
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,680
Gran, you don't take their reviews
seriously.

841
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,920
The story you just narrated is awesome.

842
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,880
I'm totally fine with the kidnapping.

843
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,640
Shall we make a small change
in the story?

844
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,440
What?

845
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,720
Shall we replace the granny
with a young girl?

846
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,840
Sounds amazing!

847
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,120
Now, that girl has been kidnapped
by a gang.

848
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,760
Lift her

849
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,520
- Get going, before the driver arrives.
- Let go of me, damn it.

850
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Help!

851
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,000
The girl's father is in great distress,
'cause his daughter has been missing.

852
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,320
No!

853
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,320
Someone has kidnapped my daughter.

854
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,240
Hope I'm on the right track, gran?

855
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,280
Don't stress too much, gran.

856
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,480
I'm on track and the flow is right.

857
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,160
What follows next...

858
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,480
I'll tell you.

859
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,800
This is where our Hero makes an entry.

860
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,720
Hey, shit ball!

861
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,680
He can come through the door,
why does he have to enter breaking glass?

862
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,840
A hero demands theatrics.

863
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,640
Why did you summon me?

864
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,640
Usually, madam returns home
before the lights are on.

865
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,680
But today, she hasn't returned yet
and it's past the routine time.

866
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,680
That's why we're worried.

867
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,600
I don't see any confusion in this matter.

868
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,920
You can switch on the lights
once your madam returns home.

869
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,240
Can't believe you called me for this.

870
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,160
Bullet Raja!

871
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,400
I doubt that my daughter has been kidnapped
by someone.

872
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,560
- Has anyone called yet?
- No.

873
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,400
Then, let's wait.

874
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,600
Sir!

875
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,480
- Are you heading over there?
- Yes.

876
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,200
Please pass on this cup to him.

877
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
- Sir, you're heading over there, right?
- Yes

878
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,080
Please pass on this biscuits to him.

879
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,880
- You fool!
- Oh, no!

880
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,560
I am annoyed already

881
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,520
Come on.

882
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,160
Enough of staring,
pick up the phone.

883
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,320
Mr.Narasimhan!

884
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,320
Untie me.

885
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,640
Let go of me.

886
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,880
Raja, I have no idea
who's on the phone.

887
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,360
But he's been continuously laughing.

888
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,800
That confirms he's the kidnapper.

889
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,560
Here I come.

890
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,040
Hello!

891
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,560
Leave me

892
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,800
It's evident now,
that you're the kidnapper.

893
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,440
Please don't waste your time on laughing.

894
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,840
Get to the point.

895
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,320
Sounds like you're choking.

896
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,680
Drink some water.

897
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,800
We've kidnapped the girl,
you've been looking for.

898
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,240
- Talk to her.
- Hello...

899
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,400
- Raja!
- Hello.

900
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,680
- Leah!
- Hello, Raja.

901
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,920
Don't be scared.

902
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,880
- I'm not scared Raja.
- That was for your dad.

903
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,160
- Leah tell me where are you?
- Raja--

904
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,440
No matter how much you try,
you can't find our den.

905
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,520
It's better you get a million in cash...

906
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,280
and head over to the
foundation of Parangimalai.

907
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,800
I'll be there right away.

908
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,360
How long will it take you
to get there?

909
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,080
We'll be there in ten minutes.

910
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,920
So, that mean your hide out is in
Meenambakkam.

911
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,720
Boss, he figured our hide-out.

912
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,480
Useless moron,
give me the phone.

913
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,600
He was bluffing.

914
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,560
It will take three hours for us to
get there.

915
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,560
Don't be late,
'cause I figured it out.

916
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,680
- Damn!
- Get the girl and come sooner.

917
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,320
I'll meet you there with money.

918
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,640
Raja, your life might be in danger
'cause of the kidnappers.

919
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,120
It's best I go there and bring Leah
back home.

920
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,080
No. Keeping your debts in mind,
you can't be trusted with money.

921
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,040
It's better I go.

922
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
He found it correctly

923
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,400
Hero is walking into a plot twist
he's unaware of.

924
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,400
Hey, hands up!

925
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,640
Sir, please don't shoot.
We're here to poop.

926
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,240
It's wrong to have crashed
the action block site.

927
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,120
And you're here pooping as a couple.

928
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,720
- You--
- Oh, no, sir!

929
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,920
Hey, pull down your lungi and run.

930
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,400
- Sure, will do.
- Damn!

931
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,640
Black cap, holding a briefcase in hand.

932
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,080
I think he's the guy I'm supposed
to meet.

933
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,000
Egg came first or the chicken?

934
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,600
In fact it arrived on a truck
from Namakkal.

935
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,120
Are you an egg vendor?

936
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,000
Billa!
King of smuggling.

937
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,120
David Billa!

938
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,400
Hey, I'm here to exchange the briefcase.

939
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,200
You should've checked before
buying it.

940
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,200
Is it damaged or what?

941
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,200
Hey!

942
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,400
Police! Let's run.

943
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,800
Run faster, you're going to get us caught.

944
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,680
Let go. Let go of me.

945
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,040
Raja, how dare you brought the
Police along.

946
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,360
Hey, I didn't bring them along.

947
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,840
They're here to arrest, Billa.

948
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,160
You'll get only this girl's dead body now.

949
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Kill that girl, damn it.

950
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,560
Hey, Leah!

951
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,000
He can't do squat about it.

952
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,360
- Chandru, put her inside the car.
- Raja!

953
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,480
- Leah. Hey, hear me out.
- Escape!

954
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,240
Hey--  Hey, Leah. Hey!

955
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,720
- Raja!
- Leah!

956
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,520
Raja!

957
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,120
- Raja
- Leah.

958
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,680
Billa escaped, but Kazhugu got caught

959
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,040
How was the plot twist?

960
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,120
It's my time to settle score.

961
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,360
Now, there's no chance the hero can save
the heroine.

962
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,200
Doesn't matter if he'll save her or not.

963
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,200
Let's see who'll save you from me.

964
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,280
- Oh, no!
- You're spoiling the story.

965
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,200
You better sleep on the porch.
Don't come inside.

966
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,360
It's really cold out here.

967
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,000
- Cover yourself with sack.
- Oh, no!

968
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
Everyone is barging in
and spoiling the story.

969
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,960
Let's disregard their stories.

970
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,800
Hero steps in fights the bad guys
and saves the heroine.

971
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,960
Okay, right?

972
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,760
- I meant to--
- That's an okay.

973
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,320
Only then, things will happen according to
my plan.

974
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,880
- Raja!
- Don't scream.

975
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,720
Chandru, drive faster.

976
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,080
Raja!

977
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,320
Come on, go faster.

978
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,080
He's blinding me with the mirrors

979
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Don't stop keep driving faster.

980
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,040
You moron, get down.

981
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,880
Hey, stop right there.
Don't try to runaway.

982
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,640
Fight him!

983
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,280
Hey, someone please step forward and fight.

984
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,440
Leah!

985
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,240
Raja.

986
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,400
Leah!

987
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,760
Sky.

988
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,080
Earth.

989
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,760
Here comes the knock!

990
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,120
Leah.

991
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,480
I'm holding it,
why don't you bend down and escape?

992
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,280
Leah...

993
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,240
Leah.

994
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,880
Now, her father will come over there...

995
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,640
rewards the hero with wealth, position
and get her daughter married to him.

996
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,160
How does it sound?

997
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,320
Gran, acknowledge the story.

998
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,360
Please say, okay. Okay, right?

999
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,920
Uh, so, it's okay.

1000
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,000
Where did he vanish?

1001
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,400
Hey, hey, hey!

1002
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,080
Bullet Raja, you saved my daughter
from a grave danger.

1003
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,200
I have faith that you'll take good care
of my daughter.

1004
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,720
So, I've decided to get my daughter
married to you.

1005
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,800
Uh, uncle, you've forgotten
the main aspect here.

1006
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,360
I believe I gave you everything.

1007
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,000
Those are my father's company documents.

1008
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,720
All of my wealth is in here.

1009
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,200
Most importantly, you're the boss of
Magic Biscuit Factory.

1010
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,600
Take this as well with my daughter

1011
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,040
How was the story, gran?
Did you like it?

1012
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,840
Only if you acknowledge,
it'll come true.

1013
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,160
Are you okay with it?

1014
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,640
I'm double, okay!

1015
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,920
- Then, it's okay for me too.
- Yes!

1016
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,520
Gran, acknowledge the story.
Everyone get to bed.

1017
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,200
Oh, God! What about me?

1018
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,360
You can use your hand as pillow.

1019
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,000
Gran, put this pillow under your leg.

1020
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,800
Hope you're comfortable.

1021
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,320
Yes! Tomorrow, everything will come
true and I will be owner of my company.

1022
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,320
Are you sure about Leah getting kidnapped?

1023
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,880
- It's confirmed.
- Okay.

1024
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,960
Why do you need this build- up
at the cost of petrol?

1025
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,160
Dude, it's imperative 'cause
we're going to be in a chase.

1026
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,920
It's been long. And they're not to be seen.

1027
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,720
It's not cinema for them to keep up timing.

1028
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,800
Poor kidnappers.

1029
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,880
It's hard to kidnap someone.

1030
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,560
Why are you feeling sorry
for the kidnappers?

1031
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,840
Yes. Because they're going to change
my fate.

1032
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,680
Then, what about our fate?

1033
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,240
Your fates are rotten.

1034
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,920
Don't worry, I'll take care of you guys.

1035
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,080
- Raja, Raja, Raja!
- Uh, Leah!

1036
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,320
I'm coming.

1037
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,520
Hey, what happened?

1038
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,160
It ran out of gas,
due to continuous revving.

1039
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,480
- Moron. Dude, I'm coming with you.
- Hop on!

1040
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,640
Dude, ride faster.

1041
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,760
Madam, don't be scared. We'll save you.

1042
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,280
Come on, go faster.

1043
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Bump him off the road.

1044
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Do it!

1045
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,160
Dude, my head is scraping.
Hey, stop the bike.

1046
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,440
Damn it, my head is scraping the road.

1047
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,880
- Leah!
- Look over here, he's smudged into balloon.

1048
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,360
- Did you my owner's daughter?
- I saved you.

1049
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,560
Ask your dad to get the documents.

1050
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,640
- I'll explain later.
- Hey!

1051
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,800
Hey, instead of kick him down,
you're talking to him.

1052
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,400
Hold on, it's our boss.

1053
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,280
Hey, why would I kidnap my
own daughter?

1054
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,400
In fact, we got a message that another group
is about to kidnap her.

1055
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,760
So, there's a group involved too.

1056
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,040
Who informed you guys?

1057
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,240
It was Raja, who informed us.

1058
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,960
What is this, Raja?

1059
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,320
Boss, it was Leah who kept screaming
my name.

1060
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,800
I saw you standing so just called out
your name.

1061
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,640
Hey, she just called you.

1062
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,280
Did she ever ask you to come
and break the glass?

1063
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,160
What the hell is this mess?

1064
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,600
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

1065
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,880
Guys, you left me stranded with no money
for gas.

1066
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,240
Boss, as we saved you and your daughter
from the kidnappers...

1067
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,760
what are you going to reward us with?

1068
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,560
So, this was extensively planned?

1069
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,840
You want a reward, right? Here you go.

1070
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,360
Fix the car and bring it home.

1071
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,440
Come on, let's go.

1072
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,160
The other day,
the story came true.

1073
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,520
How come it didn't happen this time?

1074
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,960
Okay, sir.

1075
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,120
- What happened?
- Granny is missing.

1076
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,200
Raja, granny had gone to temple
with three people.

1077
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,640
But she got lost in the crowd.

1078
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,360
I'm really scared, Raja.

1079
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,080
Three men conspired to kidnap that granny.

1080
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,480
So, only the stories said by granny
comes true.

1081
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,120
If that's the case,
who kidnapped, granny?

1082
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,440
- Gran, didn't go missing.
- I don't get it.

1083
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,080
Why are you staring at us?

1084
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,600
Didn't you guys take gran
to the temple?

1085
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,360
Are you accusing us?

1086
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,920
Humanity has lost its course.

1087
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,640
Here you go, the prayer ticket.
Check for yourself.

1088
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,680
And this is temple's offering.

1089
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,200
And this is the restaurant bill
where we had lunch.

1090
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,040
These are the tickets from our travel.

1091
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,120
Take a look.

1092
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,400
Take a good look.

1093
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,040
Take a closer look,
as you don't trust us.

1094
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,520
It's more than enough.

1095
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,080
You've booked four tickets while going
to the temple.

1096
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,760
But you've booked only three tickets
for the return travel.

1097
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,600
- Are you serious?
- Oh, no!

1098
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,160
So, you knew before hand that gran
will go missing.

1099
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,560
Looks like your half baked plan
got exposed.

1100
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,440
- Why the hell did you do it?
- It's all 'cause of you.

1101
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,920
You pamper granny,
but look down on us.

1102
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,160
You do everything for granny.

1103
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,520
Remember how you took away pillow
to rest gran's legs.

1104
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,200
Where did you leave her behind?

1105
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,680
I'll take you to her.

1106
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,680
Granny!

1107
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,560
- Granny!
- Raja, gran is out there.

1108
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,240
- Granny!
- Ah... Raja.

1109
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,040
Thank goodness, you're here.

1110
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,800
The three men who came along with me...

1111
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,240
asked me to wait here,
until they return.

1112
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,240
It's been very long.
Not sure where they went.

1113
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,320
Poor thing, please go and look for them.

1114
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,880
Granny.

1115
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,760
Gran, I'll take care of them.

1116
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,680
Hereafter, you shouldn't leave anywhere
without informing me.

1117
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,960
Sure, I will inform you.

1118
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,400
You too shouldn't leave me forever.

1119
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,680
I won't, gran. I definitely, won't.

1120
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,760
Where's our hero?

1121
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,080
Sir, he's right over there.

1122
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Okay.

1123
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
Hello, sir.

1124
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:30,880
Good morning, sir.

1125
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,800
I heard you chased down the car
to save Leah...

1126
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,040
just 'cause she called out
your name.

1127
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,640
Come on, don't laugh.

1128
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,560
He was being heroic.

1129
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,280
Sir, looks like you're planning something.

1130
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,880
Do you care to share with us?

1131
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,480
Boss, had mentioned to display
ones' skills.

1132
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,440
That explains his heroism.

1133
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, you're competing for the GM's post,
is it?

1134
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,960
If you become the General Manager...

1135
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,120
please take me as your assistant, sir.

1136
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,360
Hey, when the wind blows...

1137
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,040
the paper flies so does a bird.

1138
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,440
Only when the wind subsides...

1139
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,080
one can spot the difference between
a paper and a bird.

1140
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,600
I hope you understood the analogy.

1141
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,320
Hey, it's better you come, do you work...

1142
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,800
and take home your share
of leftover biscuits.

1143
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,680
If you wish to compete for the GM's post...

1144
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,800
I'll tarnish you. Mind it.

1145
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,600
Get back to work!

1146
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,120
For gastric troubles...

1147
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,520
add ginger and cumin seeds.

1148
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,360
What do we do,
if infants suffer from bad stomach?

1149
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,880
You gotta wipe their asses.
Didn't you know that already?

1150
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,680
Grandma, you please go ahead.

1151
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,760
Hello Doctor program has come to an end.

1152
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,520
We'll meet Dr.Anita at
the same time tomorrow.

1153
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,280
Greetings and Thank you.
You can leave now.

1154
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,400
Grandma, he's being difficult.

1155
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,720
Son, give that to her.

1156
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,240
She needs information on country medicine
to attend an exam.

1157
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,880
That's why I was helping her out.

1158
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,320
Gran, please be careful.

1159
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,920
She might make you a proxy
to write her exams.

1160
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,960
You can stare all you want outside.
I'm here to listen to a story.

1161
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,920
You've been nagging like a child
to hear a story.

1162
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,520
Don't you have a presentation to complete?
Why don't you prepare for it?

1163
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,680
Why is doctor going too sweet on me?

1164
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,280
Uh, it's not like it seems.

1165
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,960
I just felt like saying it.

1166
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,760
- When life gives you an opportunity..
- Good night.

1167
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,440
- Hear me out..
- Good night.

1168
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,000
- Let me speak..
- Goodnight.

1169
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,720
Good night.

1170
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,640
Good night, grandma.

1171
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,040
Grandma, let's get to our story time.

1172
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,200
Everyone gather around.
Gran is about to tell a story.

1173
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,160
Hey, moron!
Why the hell are you gathering people?

1174
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,960
Look at this idiot, trying to peep in.

1175
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,840
You guys have done enough damage.

1176
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,880
Get lost.

1177
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,360
Hereafter, it's one- to- one.

1178
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,680
Gran, will tell the story and I'll hear it.

1179
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,720
Grandma, come on, let's go out.

1180
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,320
Oh, no, why do you have to?

1181
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,200
Grandma, please watch your step.

1182
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,680
Oh, God!

1183
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,720
She hasn't lost her charm.

1184
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,080
Grandma, please narrate a beautiful
love story.

1185
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,320
In that story,
heroine falls in love with the hero.

1186
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,360
That love rewards the hero with everything
he has wished for.

1187
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,840
- Love story, is it?
- Yes.

1188
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,440
During the 12th century...

1189
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,640
there lived a beautiful princess in Rome.

1190
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,400
She had a warrior as her bodyguard.

1191
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,800
This Kyron warrior is at your service.
You can ask anything of me.

1192
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,520
Princess, the Persian King is here
to meet you.

1193
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,400
Who the hell is he?
Looks like a bloated mannequin.

1194
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,760
What brings you here?

1195
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,200
We need water.

1196
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,480
You came all the way for water?

1197
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,840
You could've just bought a packet
at the corner store.

1198
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,400
We're not here for the drinking water.

1199
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,400
On his way over here,
his stomach got upset.

1200
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,600
It's hard to believe that Persian King
has an upset stomach.

1201
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,600
Doesn't who it is,
junk food upsets the stomach.

1202
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,400
Agreed!

1203
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,560
Can you or not give us water?

1204
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,520
We will give you water.
Don't get angry.

1205
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,960
So, shall we give it to him?

1206
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,840
Or shall we knock them down?

1207
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,560
Knock them down, indeed.

1208
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,840
Kyron warriors don't
bow down to authority.

1209
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,920
You made a huge mistake!

1210
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,400
You've insulted the Persian King.

1211
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,400
We're going to wage a war against
your kingdom.

1212
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,400
- Hercules!
- Hey, get lost from here.

1213
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,240
Damn you warriors, the issue could've
been solved with a bucket of water.

1214
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,440
But you've dragged a nation to war.

1215
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,680
The Persian King was humiliated...

1216
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,640
so he planned to attack
the Princess of Rome.

1217
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:07,600
Do you know how the Princess rewarded
the brave warrior?

1218
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,880
What did she give him?
Tell me what was it?

1219
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,120
She did!

1220
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,560
Grandma..!

1221
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,360
- Book, is it?
- Yes, she gave him a book.

1222
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,040
I really don't understand your angle.

1223
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,560
Have you never seen any romantic films?

1224
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,120
I've seen few during my childhood.

1225
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,600
The Casanova!

1226
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,560
This situation doesn't call for a book.

1227
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,120
That wasn't an ordinary book.

1228
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,840
Is it a bound one?

1229
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,600
That was her gift of love.

1230
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,760
King of Rome!

1231
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,880
King of Justice!

1232
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,160
Guardian of the people.

1233
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,080
A noble and generous philanthropist.

1234
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,440
Wish you a long life.

1235
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,840
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1236
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,320
Hercules, he looks like someone
who came straight outta garbage.

1237
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,720
I wonder how he's got such
a beautiful daughter.

1238
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,440
Kyron, beauty has to be savored.

1239
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,640
Shouldn't criticize it.

1240
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,560
For instance,
this apple was picked up from trash.

1241
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,600
It still tastes good.

1242
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,040
What do you say, Marco- Polo?

1243
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,560
He's just pretending to spit.
But has been swallowing it.

1244
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,320
Thief!

1245
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,560
In order to develop the Roman Empire...

1246
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,280
I had asked for suggestions from everyone.

1247
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,520
Does anyone have a plan in mind?

1248
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:42,960
I do, Highness.

1249
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,160
Your Highness, this books carries,
warfare, medicine and public welfare

1250
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,600
moreover it has everything required
for the development of an empire.

1251
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,240
So, it's just one?

1252
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,640
I'm here too.

1253
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,440
Kyron warriors don't exaggerate things.

1254
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,560
I'm submitting this book on behalf of
Kyron warriors.

1255
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,560
It's really heavy,
please take it from my hand.

1256
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,640
After going through both the books...

1257
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,320
the person who's suited to run this empire.

1258
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,840
Morpheus!

1259
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,840
- Morpheus!
- No.

1260
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,680
Kyron!

1261
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,280
No, it's Kyron!

1262
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,320
I'm handing over my empire to Kyron...

1263
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,480
also I'm giving my daughters' hand
in marriage.

1264
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,560
Come closer!

1265
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,640
What? What happened?

1266
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,480
Oh!

1267
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,960
Isn't this leftover apple, right?

1268
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,960
Long live!

1269
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,760
He got the empire 'cause of the book given
by the Princess.

1270
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,840
Also he got to marry the princess.

1271
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,880
How's it?

1272
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,400
Grandma, you're awesome.

1273
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,960
This is what I wanted.

1274
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,160
- I'm leaving.
- Hey, sit down.

1275
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,200
I'm yet to finish the story.

1276
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,400
What is left to say?

1277
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,560
On his first day as the King,
he removed all the old people from there.

1278
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,040
King of Rome!

1279
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,640
King of Justice!

1280
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,120
Guardian of the people.

1281
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,320
A noble and generous philanthropist.

1282
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,720
Wish you a long life.

1283
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,640
Apologies,
I have nothing to offer.

1284
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,240
A King can't refuse.

1285
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,800
Shall I make a mark on your face?

1286
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,600
It's high time you change your attitude.

1287
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,200
Your Highness,
you were right about him.

1288
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,920
- Who are you?
- I'm the Statecraft Minister.

1289
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,240
Stand up right away.

1290
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,280
He's taking too much time.
What is your age?

1291
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,720
This August,
I'll be 67 years old.

1292
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,120
I doubt you'll last until August.

1293
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,040
And you've been shamelessly
warming up benches.

1294
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,160
Hereafter, people above 60 years old
shouldn't be in Kyron.

1295
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,800
Ask all the old people to leave
the country.

1296
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,080
Your Highness,
how can we leave at once?

1297
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,080
If given prior notice,
would you have gone to United States?

1298
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,960
Now tell me,
what is with your head?

1299
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,680
It looks like a knife sharpener.

1300
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,920
Hercules, clear out all the old hags.

1301
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,840
Okay.

1302
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,840
- Hey, leave from here.
- Where do we go? We're old.

1303
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,200
- Fine, we're going.
- Get out, damn it.

1304
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,480
- Don't come back.
- Hercules!

1305
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,760
How old are you?

1306
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,680
Your Highness, I’m 60 years old.

1307
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,160
No, I'm 50 years old.

1308
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,800
In fact, I'm 40 years old.

1309
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,320
It's better you leave the nation too.

1310
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,720
- Your Highness!
- Get out, I say.

1311
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,840
Kyron Warriors!

1312
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,120
- It's not right.
- That's how stories are.

1313
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,880
The good becomes bad.

1314
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,360
The bad becomes good.

1315
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,520
Only then it gets interesting.

1316
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,920
I really don't get your stories.

1317
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,640
You always mess up the climax.

1318
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,680
How can you turn a hero into villain?

1319
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,040
Grandma, please consider and change
the climax.

1320
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,120
Raja, I can't change the
story to suit your liking.

1321
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,760
Goodnight, I'm very sleepy.

1322
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,880
Grandma!

1323
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,360
- Grandma!
- Don't wake me up.

1324
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,600
I'm done for the day.

1325
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
Go and sleep.

1326
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,320
I hope you can sell the
entire stock by tomorrow.

1327
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,200
It'll be cleared for sure.

1328
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,520
Don't worry about it.

1329
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,840
I don't have to worry.

1330
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,440
You'll have to,
if you don't clear the stock.

1331
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,280
I'll pass on the order to someone else.

1332
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,200
- No, madam, I'll clear it.
- We'll see.

1333
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,800
Wow!

1334
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,320
Hey, surprise.
I was about to call you.

1335
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,320
What's on your neck?

1336
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,880
There's going to be a huge
action scene out here.

1337
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,640
After which it's going to get mushy.

1338
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,800
I really don't get your jokes.

1339
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,840
Come over here.

1340
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,160
For a while,
I've been wanting to tell you something.

1341
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,920
Is it about love?

1342
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,560
- How did you know?
- It's all in the game.

1343
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,560
Go ahead.

1344
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,600
But I'm quite scared of dad.

1345
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,240
You don't worry about your dad.

1346
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,160
Status wouldn't be an issue.

1347
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,120
It all happened after I got back
from London.

1348
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,800
I always wanted to tell you.

1349
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,280
But you always had company.

1350
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,640
Now that no one is here, tell me.

1351
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,320
In Bangalore...

1352
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,080
I have a boyfriend.

1353
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,520
Boyfriend?

1354
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,640
- Then who am I to you?
- You're my friend.

1355
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,920
You kissed me.

1356
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,000
I did.

1357
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,040
Kiss on the cheeks, is a friend.

1358
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,800
Kiss on the lips, is a boyfriend.

1359
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,200
Lips and cheeks are close to each other.

1360
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,640
Kiss me on the lips and make me
your boyfriend.

1361
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,960
Idiot, everything is a joke to you.

1362
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,400
I'm heading to Bangalore to celebrate
his birthday.

1363
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,120
If dad asks for me,
please make an excuse and handle it.

1364
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,160
Leah!

1365
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,320
Leah, it doesn't matter
if you don't love me.

1366
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,400
At least give me the book,

1367
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,920
which will make me the owner
of the company.

1368
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,040
Hey, why are you standing in middle
of the road?

1369
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,080
Situation calls for it.

1370
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,640
What is this?

1371
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,400
What brings your here?

1372
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,840
I'm here for a medical camp.

1373
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,360
But why are you dressed
all in white?

1374
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,800
It's the dress code.
I have a seminar at noon.

1375
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,000
Buddy, look at that girl in white.

1376
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,000
Oh, no!

1377
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,280
Let's throw the colour to her

1378
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,200
Please don't do it.

1379
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,320
I'm go to seminar

1380
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,640
Please don't do it.

1381
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,840
- I have a seminar to attend.
- Get inside the car.

1382
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,480
Raja, please

1383
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,200
Thank you.

1384
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,320
Okay, you go safe.

1385
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,560
Just wait for a minute.

1386
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,280
What is this book?

1387
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,800
To help you with your
project presentation.

1388
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,200
That was not an ordinary book.

1389
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,600
Hey!

1390
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,240
 I said, get down.

1391
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,320
Hey, can't you hear, damn it.

1392
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,640
Will you or not give us water?

1393
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,000
- Move aside.
- Are you blind?

1394
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,480
They deserve to get water too.

1395
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,440
That was her gift of love.

1396
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,160
- So, it's you.
- I don't get it.

1397
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,000
Are you my beloved Princess?

1398
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,960
Only now you've realized it?

1399
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,360
Kiss on the cheeks, is a friend.

1400
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,720
Kiss on the lips, is a boyfriend.

1401
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,480
"Baby you gotta accept me."

1402
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,120
"Please, you gotta take me in."

1403
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,840
"I'm your honey, my dear."

1404
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,640
"And you're my Queen, dear."

1405
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,480
"Baby you gotta accept me."

1406
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,000
"Please, you gotta take me in."

1407
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,680
"I'm your honey, my dear."

1408
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:44,000
"And you're my Queen, dear."

1409
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,000
"Our hearts have come together as one."

1410
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,520
"And you've approved and signed up
for what we are."

1411
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,000
"Our hearts have come together as one."

1412
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,120
"And you've approved and signed up
for what we are."

1413
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,800
"Baby you gotta accept me."

1414
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,960
"Please, you gotta take me in."

1415
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,200
"I'm your honey, my dear."

1416
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,840
"And you're my Queen, dear."

1417
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,120
"You've smitten me with your smile
and your cute antics."

1418
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:37,480
"You've rolled me up like a crepe
drenched with love."

1419
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,920
"I was a hardcore single."

1420
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,880
"But you've flipped me into a love bug."

1421
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:48,040
"I thought of stealing you away
and keeping you for myself."

1422
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,440
"Baby you gotta accept me."

1423
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,480
"Please, you gotta take me in."

1424
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,680
"I'm your honey, my dear."

1425
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,760
"And you're my Queen, dear."

1426
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,480
"Your eyes are mesmerizing just like
the doughnuts I love."

1427
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:09,400
"Don't you be rough on me
and push me away, dear."

1428
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:15,160
"You're taking me down
like the mighty Gin."

1429
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,200
"If you call me with love,
I'll lay curled under your feet."

1430
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,280
"Nothing comes easy,
you gotta work for it."

1431
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,160
"I'm your unconditional lover,
I'm gonna lift up your spirits."

1432
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,920
"Baby you gotta accept me."

1433
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,680
"Please, you gotta take me in."

1434
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,120
"I'm your honey, my dear."

1435
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,120
"And you're my Queen, dear."

1436
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:47,400
"Our hearts have come together as one."

1437
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,800
"And you've approved and signed up
for what we are."

1438
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,520
"Our hearts have come together as one."

1439
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,920
"And you've approved and signed up
for what we are."

1440
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,560
Thank you.

1441
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,440
So, biscuit is not a staple diet.

1442
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,640
It's a kind of entertainment.

1443
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,200
The reason why I'm
mentioning it...

1444
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,680
'cause the appearance of the biscuit
matter the most.

1445
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,440
Before satisfying the taste buds...

1446
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,400
if we make it attractive to eyes,
our job is done.

1447
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,040
The current generation is addicted to
gaming and mobile phones.

1448
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,600
We have to get them addicted to our
Magic Biscuits.

1449
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,160
So, we're going to add more sweeteners
and coloring agents.

1450
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,320
And more emulsifiers.

1451
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,000
These additives will affect kids health.

1452
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,120
Ma'am we're running a biscuit factory
not a hospital.

1453
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
You're concern for health is unhealthy
for the business.

1454
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,120
Our competitors are way ahead of us
in the game.

1455
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,720
And coming to your concern,
what we could do is...

1456
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,760
basically we can add a small disclaimer
behind the biscuit packet.

1457
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,960
That's about it.

1458
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,520
Our budget for advertisement should be more
than production.

1459
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,160
Appearance of the product
is key to sales.

1460
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,600
Flashy foods, fruitful business.

1461
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Thank you, gentlemen.

1462
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,440
Thank you.

1463
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,480
- How was it?
- Raja, you proceed.

1464
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,240
Good morning.

1465
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Back in the day there food and medicine
were not different things.

1466
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,000
In fact worked as medicine.

1467
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,680
The snacks and savories
our grandmothers made...

1468
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:40,400
comprised of extremely nutritious
and healthy ingredients.

1469
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,200
The food back then worked perfectly
as country medicine.

1470
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,720
Let's get back to our roots.

1471
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,120
Let's stop using the white flour for
making biscuits...

1472
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,520
and start using maize, rye etc
to manufacture them.

1473
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,800
Firstly they discover a medicine.

1474
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,360
Then a disease is invented
to sell that medicine.

1475
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,120
And for people to catch that disease,
they manufacture new type of foods.

1476
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,760
Let's not mirror an international company
in trapping people...

1477
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,240
by producing unhealthy foods.

1478
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,400
Rather let's become a traditional company
that produces healthy foods...

1479
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,160
and saves people from
not catching a disease.

1480
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,520
To put it in simple words...

1481
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,640
let's just tweak the food our grandmothers
used to feed us.

1482
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,360
Let's turn this junk food into .
healthy snack...

1483
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,400
and create magic.

1484
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,200
What the heck.

1485
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,560
Well done, Raja.

1486
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,360
Right time you well spoke

1487
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,640
I thought it's going
to be tough...

1488
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,120
to pick one as the General Manager.

1489
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,320
But it turned out easy.

1490
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,800
Ganesh...

1491
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,560
your idea was definitely
larger than life.

1492
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,960
But, Raja...

1493
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,520
you were very natural about your idea.

1494
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,280
Youngsters these days favor organic food.

1495
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,640
Even the parents choose to feed the same
to their children.

1496
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,000
My friend, Dharmaraj.
Founder of this company.

1497
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,440
If he was alive today.

1498
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,080
Raja, he would've definitely
appreciated you.

1499
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,520
So...

1500
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,280
Ganesh!

1501
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,000
Your idea won't work out.

1502
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,440
You stay put.

1503
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,000
Raja, please come.

1504
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,560
From today, Raja will be your
General Manager.

1505
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,520
I thank everyone present here.

1506
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,920
- Raja, let's go to your cabin.
- Sure, sir.

1507
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,400
Sir, based on this post,
I've taken loans.

1508
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,160
I'll take care of it.
Hold your horses.

1509
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,200
- Let's go.
- Please, sir.

1510
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,120
Hey, your book did
wonders to my career..

1511
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,720
- Congrats!
- Hey, thanks.

1512
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,600
Why do you have your hands in the air?

1513
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,680
I was about to give you a hug.

1514
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,560
But Leah barged in...

1515
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,040
So, you think I barged in, is it?

1516
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,840
Leah, she's my girlfriend.

1517
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,400
Then what do you have to say
about this?

1518
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,760
They're rock hard. Looks like you're
working out.

1519
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,320
I ran a test in the morning.

1520
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,040
You're going to be a father.

1521
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,040
Leah, stop kidding.

1522
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,800
It was you, who was playing with me
last night.

1523
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,440
And now you're asking me not to
play around.

1524
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,640
You're a doctor, right.
Check my pulse.

1525
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,640
Hey, just 'cause she said,
you don't have to.

1526
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,120
Oh, so you don't believe me.

1527
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,040
Coming 30th,
I'll come with a doctor's report.

1528
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,120
Then you can decide to love him or not.

1529
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,200
What shall we name the kid?

1530
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,120
Anitha!

1531
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,320
Anitha Raja. Nice name.

1532
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,920
Hey, Leah!

1533
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,760
I did not suggest the name.

1534
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,400
I was just calling out your name.

1535
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,200
Let's take a call on the 30th.

1536
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,720
There's no 30th in February.

1537
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,920
She was just pulling your leg.
And you believed her.

1538
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,280
I trust you.

1539
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,680
It's not audible,
come a little closer.

1540
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,520
Raja, he's out there.
Let's go.

1541
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,880
I'll be right there.

1542
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,360
I have a small job to tend to.
You carry on.

1543
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,200
- Manohar!
- Why are you calling out everyone?

1544
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:45,840
Look over there.

1545
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,960
I'm surprised how did this happen.

1546
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,200
- Why do we have to do this now?
- Just shut up.

1547
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,360
They should've at least
looked at the presentation.

1548
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,000
- Boss!
- It's in detail.

1549
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,520
Do you remember what you said about
 air, paper and birds?

1550
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,120
I hope now you must've
realized who's who?

1551
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,800
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1552
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,920
Paper!

1553
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,080
You do respond to that name.

1554
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,200
I think this name suits you well.

1555
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,200
Paper!

1556
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,640
Hey, what was that?

1557
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,480
It's a naming ritual which we follow.

1558
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,480
That's right.

1559
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,480
I remember you saying
something else too.

1560
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,520
He asked you to hire him as your assistant.

1561
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,160
In this new project,
you're going to be my assistant.

1562
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,440
Tomorrow get to the factory
construction site...

1563
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,640
and begin the required process...

1564
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,960
then prepare the schedule
and bring it to my office.

1565
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,280
No, you don't have to bring it to me.

1566
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,480
I don't like to see your face.
So, just mail me.

1567
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,360
- Guys, let's enjoy.
- Yes.

1568
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,560
Damn, we have to endure their atrocities.

1569
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,040
Can you tell me,
where is No.5 Anderson Bungalow?

1570
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,280
Thirty years ago,
it was called Anderson Bungalow.

1571
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,760
But now it's called
Isabella Old Age Home.

1572
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,840
Oh, please open the gate.

1573
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,040
This is where Raja gives biscuits

1574
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,080
That's perfect granny.

1575
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,560
I'm happy.

1576
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,600
Ma'am aren't you Raja sir's girlfriend?

1577
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,480
When did this happen?

1578
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,400
Who are you?

1579
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,120
I'm Raja sir's assistant.

1580
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,960
Can you spare me some glue?
I have to stick a court's notice.

1581
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,040
What notice is this?

1582
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,800
We're going to bulldoze the orphanage
in two days.

1583
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,200
That's why our
office has issued...

1584
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,080
a small notice to
vacate this place.

1585
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,120
Are you serious?

1586
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,160
Does Raja know about this?

1587
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,200
It was Raja's order to bulldoze the place.

1588
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,440
In fact after becoming GM,
this is the first order he signed on.

1589
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,360
Raja would never do that.

1590
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,240
We know about Raja's nature.

1591
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,920
They're right.

1592
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,880
If something goes wrong with us...

1593
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,040
Raja is the first person to be here.

1594
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,200
- Can't believe you're speaking ill of him.
- That's right.

1595
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,920
Sir, is on the phone.

1596
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,480
Good afternoon, sir.

1597
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,040
Have you reached the site?

1598
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,960
I'm on the job, sir.

1599
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,720
I don't what you would do...

1600
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,800
make sure you vacate
everyone from there, okay?

1601
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,800
In two days we'll have to demolish
and hand it over to the builders.

1602
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,160
- Understood?
- Absolutely, sir.

1603
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:26,920
Sure, sir.

1604
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,360
Hope you heard him over the phone.

1605
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,760
I'm being respectful of your age.

1606
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,840
By dawn vacate the orphanage
and find some place to crash.

1607
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,800
Get moving.

1608
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,680
I'll take a leave.

1609
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,360
Excuse me, I'm here for Dr.Geeta.

1610
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,680
- Oh, thanks.
- I need that patient's report right away.

1611
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,800
Good morning, doctor.

1612
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,680
- Why aren't you answering my calls?
- Please leave.

1613
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,040
I don't wish to speak to you.

1614
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,600
Anitha!

1615
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,920
Anitha, please stop.

1616
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,960
Anitha, I swear I wasn't aware.

1617
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,960
Is that so?

1618
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,840
Why don't cancel the order to demolish
the orphanage?

1619
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,000
Then you can come and meet me.

1620
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,760
Hey, hear me..

1621
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,240
Raja, sign this document.

1622
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,640
I wanted to discuss about the factory.

1623
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,240
Hereafter, demolishing the orphanage...

1624
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,440
and construction of the new factory.
You'll have to take care of it.

1625
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,320
Dad and I are headed to Japan to purchase
new machinery.

1626
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:36,720
Dad has decided to give you
the power of attorney for that land.

1627
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,640
This is that document,
please sign it.

1628
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:42,840
Sir, is it vital for us to build a factory
by demolishing the orphanage?

1629
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,080
Is the corporation giving you a
hard time?

1630
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,920
Sir, that orphanage is a shelter
to the homeless.

1631
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,920
If we demolish it,
they'll have nowhere to go.

1632
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,320
Please think about it.

1633
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,280
Look, I felt pity and promoted you
as the GM.

1634
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,480
And you're here feeling sorry for them.

1635
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,800
I spent a lot to get that land.

1636
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,440
This is my dream project.

1637
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,720
If everyone is dead,
the land will be orphaned.

1638
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,320
And you don't want me to demolish it.

1639
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,200
Look...

1640
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,080
if you can't do it,

1641
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,800
I'll promote someone else
who's ready to do it.

1642
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,320
It's not just my dream...

1643
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,840
it's your father's dream too.

1644
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,640
Are you going to fulfill your
father's dream...

1645
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,600
or going to run behind these old hags?

1646
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,680
Think about it.

1647
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,840
I'm going to turn this bakery into a
huge company.

1648
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,240
And once you're all grown up,

1649
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,480
I'll make you the GM of our company.

1650
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,680
That's my dream, will you do it?

1651
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,760
Okay, dad.

1652
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,680
Fine, your wish.

1653
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,080
Don't do it what did you thought

1654
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,280
Sir, hold on.

1655
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,320
I'll do it.

1656
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,800
Hey, make sure nothing is left out.
Throw everything away.

1657
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,880
Hey, who's that?
Get out.

1658
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,720
He removed all the old people
from the nation.

1659
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,880
- Go!
- Please spare us, son.

1660
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,200
Oh, no.

1661
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,800
I'll inform you after clear it

1662
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,880
Isn't it wrong?

1663
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,200
That's how stories are.

1664
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,760
The good becomes bad.

1665
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,280
And the bad becomes good.

1666
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,440
That's when it gets interesting.

1667
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,440
Move.

1668
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,320
Demolish it.

1669
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,640
Come on, over here.

1670
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,600
Hey!

1671
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,200
We were together for so many years.

1672
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,720
But you're being atrocious
and chasing us away.

1673
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,000
- Don't do it.
- Hey!

1674
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,760
Don't demolish it.
Please don't demolish it.

1675
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,120
- Please don't demolish it.
- Granny, calm down.

1676
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,080
Hey, Kumar bring the stretcher around.

1677
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,280
Where's the patient?
Where's the patient?

1678
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

1679
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,640
Sir, Narasimhan has fainted...

1680
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,520
I got a call that he's in a
serious condition.

1681
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,320
Who the hell are you
calling a patient?

1682
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,880
I am that Narasimhan, damn it.

1683
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,200
I think you got the wrong address.

1684
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,200
I wonder why Raja called me, then.

1685
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,760
Is it Raja?

1686
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,760
One second.
Speak to him.

1687
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,680
- Raja.
- Tell me, sir.

1688
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,880
Why did you send an ambulance
to my house?

1689
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,320
Once you hear me out,
you'll definitely be in serious condition.

1690
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,880
Stop kidding around.

1691
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,520
Have patience.

1692
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,960
Remember you gave me the power of attorney
on the orphanage?

1693
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,080
I used that power...

1694
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,600
and got that place registered
to the orphanage.

1695
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,640
Are you serious?

1696
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,400
The registration was done successfully.

1697
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,960
Hereafter, neither you...

1698
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,280
nor anyone can do squat about it.

1699
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,240
Thanks a lot, Raja.

1700
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,920
Hey, that was a 500 crore project.

1701
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,280
I'm feeling really feeling
light headed now.

1702
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,280
Hey, ask them to get the stretcher.

1703
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,600
I'm at the right address,
you were just holding it in.

1704
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,040
Hurry up, get me the stretcher.

1705
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,040
Hey, come on take him inside the ambulance.

1706
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,000
- Hello.
- Did you drop the phone?

1707
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,040
Not just the phone,
the entire body fell on the ground.

1708
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,240
He was too arrogant.

1709
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,960
He face looks like a crushed paper cup.

1710
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,320
Oh, no, I thought he'll get a stroke.

1711
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,560
It's true that God always
has a plan for us.

1712
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,200
One more thing,
he's not pleasant to look at...

1713
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,720
I'm sure it's an ugly sight.

1714
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,000
- Take him right away to the hospital.
- Okay.

1715
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,720
Hey, pick up that man.

1716
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,040
Keep moving.

1717
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,600
Throw everything outside.

1718
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:33,920
- Hurry up.
- Keep moving.

1719
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,720
Come on, demolish it.

1720
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,840
Take the left.

1721
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,720
- Hello.
- Hello, Ganesh...

1722
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,840
we've registered the land to the orphanage.

1723
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,800
You don't have to demolish it.
Stop everything right now.

1724
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,920
Hey, move to the other side.

1725
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,720
- Keep demolishing it.
- Ganesh, can you hear me?

1726
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,600
- Hello?
- Hello?

1727
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,440
- Hello?
- Hello, Ganesh, can you hear me?

1728
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,240
- Ganesh, stop demolishing it.
- Sir, I can't hear you.

1729
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,360
- Ganesh, stop everything.
- I can't hear you, sir.

1730
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,440
Hello, I can't hear anything, sir.

1731
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,040
- I can't hear you.
- Hello, hello, Ganesh?

1732
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,040
Hello!

1733
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,520
- Please stop it.
- Demolish it.

1734
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,960
They've demolished it completely.

1735
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,400
- Please don't do it.
- Stop demolishing it.

1736
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,320
Don't destroy our home.

1737
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,680
Please listen to us.

1738
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,200
Please don't do this.

1739
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,760
Oh, God, no!

1740
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,520
- Please don't demolish it.
- Hey, leave from here.

1741
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,360
- Hey, stop screaming.
- Make sure he doesn't get here.

1742
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,240
I'll take care of it.

1743
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,320
He switched off the phone.

1744
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,920
I'll handle this.
You go and get the document.

1745
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,760
Sir..sir

1746
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,920
Boys, beat him to pulp.

1747
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,240
Oh, no

1748
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,240
Who are you?

1749
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,760
You look like a buffalo on stand.

1750
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,200
What's your problem with me?

1751
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,160
The orphanage.

1752
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,800
Don't demolish it.

1753
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,040
Hey!

1754
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,360
- Raja.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1755
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,360
I said, stop it.

1756
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,360
- Ma'am.
- Stop it.

1757
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,560
Stop the work

1758
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,880
What you're doing is illegal.

1759
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,040
Raja has registered the place
to the orphanage.

1760
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,080
Ma'am, but we're almost done.

1761
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,160
Please leave.

1762
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,000
Damn!

1763
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,200
Hereafter you won't have any problems.

1764
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,400
Raja is the best.

1765
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,360
Raja.

1766
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,640
Are you happy?

1767
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,400
Come on, let's pick up our stuff.

1768
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,760
Let's take everything inside.

1769
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:03,880
Come on, hurry up.

1770
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,520
Come on, Raja has arrived.

1771
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,160
Sorry! I don't know what I did

1772
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,560
What you did was correct.

1773
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,320
There's no point in making them homeless
and build a factory.

1774
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,320
Factory can be constructed anywhere.

1775
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:17,760
That's not it.

1776
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,280
The money dad gave,
I'll return that as soon as possible.

1777
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,720
Cool, relax.

1778
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,000
Thanks a lot, Leah.

1779
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,200
I did teach you how to thank
in London style.

1780
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,040
Sir, you're currently in Tamilnadu.

1781
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,520
It's enough that you follow our culture.

1782
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:43,280
My dear Tamil woman,
you don't have anything to worry about.

1783
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,840
I'm just a business partner.

1784
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,160
You're his life partner.

1785
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,640
Raja, please treat us with marriage feast.

1786
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,200
Does early morning 4am works for you?

1787
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,400
We're not getting married now.

1788
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,200
We're going to date for six months.

1789
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,680
That sounds great.

1790
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,280
Please bless us, granny.

1791
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,040
Gran, tell me a story.

1792
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:05,840
Story is it?

1793
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,640
It's said elders are God's equal.

1794
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,000
Elders blessings change the course
of my son's life.

1795
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,160
Despite skilled doctors at work...

1796
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,880
they could not save, Narasimhan.

1797
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:20,320
So, Magic Biscuits full control
was under my son.

1798
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,760
Just like I had dreamt,
my son became the GM of my company.
