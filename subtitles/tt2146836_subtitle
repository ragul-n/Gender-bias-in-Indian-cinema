180
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:02,041
What is as tiny as an ant's mouth?

181
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,333
Food it eats is as tiny
as an ant's mouth!

182
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,333
Understand?

183
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,166
That's a good one.

184
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,833
lf you ask such tiny
questions how will l answer?

185
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,874
Then may l ask a big question?

186
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,874
Shoot.

187
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,374
What's as high as the mountain?

188
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,916
Agree l have lost, tell.

189
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,041
Tree that grows on the mountain!

190
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,416
The tree?
- Yes tree

191
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:30,833
l've got something for you.

192
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,624
Tamil movies, l've tried hard to get them.

193
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,166
Oh, l've seen all these

194
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,124
Still you can keep it

195
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,916
No doctor, seen each of them
five or six times. Please take them.

196
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,583
Lakshmi l love.. to watch Tamil movies.

197
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,041
Alaypayuthe, Mozhi, Paruthiveeran..

198
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:58,833
That's Tamil!

199
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,083
You know something, Tamil
films get released here.

200
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:01,958
Next time you can watch with me.

201
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:08,916
ls it? lf l watch films with friends,
won't be able to concentrate.

202
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,333
l shall go alone. Don't take trouble.

203
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,874
Hello Doctor! Shukur here.

204
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,124
Where are you? l am just getting out.

205
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,374
All are waiting in the club. Come fast

206
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,833
Okay.

207
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:34,999
Bye.

208
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,249
Hello..Dr. Arun speaking.

209
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:04,124
Arun.. lt's me Venu. No news of you.

210
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,166
l was slightly busy

211
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,499
ln room yesterday our
discussion was on Burj Kahlifa.

212
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:20,499
Nobody has seen it close;
They don't believe you live there!

213
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:28,249
l took challenge and came
with four non-believers!

214
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,499
Where have you reached now?

215
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,666
l am at the base. Aren't you in room?

216
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,749
Tell the security men to let us in.

217
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:40,208
Sorry l am in hospital now.

218
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,166
Oh, you are not there?

219
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,666
No, call and come another day.

220
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:54,041
What shall be done with the
food your mom has sent?

221
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,624
Please share them with your friends.

222
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,166
Please don't mind.

223
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,333
Busy with an operation in hospital.

224
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:04,958
Don't worry. We know doctors are busy!

225
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,666
Next time we will call and come.
- Yes.

226
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,958
We missed a good chance to enter in it.

227
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,416
Good Morning sister!

228
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,749
Hi Maya!

229
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,583
No news of you!

230
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:37,208
Usually you come in need of
something. What do you want now?

231
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,958
Nothing. l just felt like seeing you.

232
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,999
And landed straight here.

233
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,499
Nice. How's your boutique coming up?

234
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,583
Furnishing is on. License
formalities almost done.

235
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:51,749
The lady sponsor you
found for me is really helpful.

236
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:53,666
Good morning!

237
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,749
Arun..come

238
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,124
This is Dr.Arun Kumar, my junior.

239
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,833
Maya, my cousin's daughter.

240
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,624
She is from UK.

241
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,874
Started her career
in France. Now in Dubai.

242
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,083
Nice to meet you Maya.

243
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,833
Are you a doctor?

244
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,874
No. l am into fashion designing.

245
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:12,916
Was looking for a personal designer
for myself. Now Maya is here!

246
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,749
Don't make her that personal!

247
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:17,499
She is engaged.

248
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:21,208
Her fiance in Paris would soon join her.

249
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,749
So that chance is also gone!

250
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:27,458
To have tall grandchildren l must
marry a tall girl, my mother says!

251
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,208
These guys in France have let us down!

252
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,666
We can give you compensation.

253
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,749
Get some customers for her boutique...

254
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,499
...we will select a tall girl
among them and give you.

255
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:44,499
Fine. Your word is final!
So all the best Maya!

256
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,666
Bye, l'll see you around.
- See you. Bye

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,833
Hello...hello...

258
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,041
What happened?

259
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:08,833
Asking what happened?

260
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,666
Music in duty time?

261
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,833
Can't hear the phone ringing?
- Sorry

262
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,624
Did you give medicines to patient in 7B?
- Yes, gave at the proper time.

263
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,374
What happened sister?

264
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,458
Music and chocolates in duty time,
l will have to report.

265
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,416
Leave it sister, poor girl!

266
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,458
Not as 'poor' as expected!

267
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,499
Sorry doctor, this is my lunch.
May l finish it?

268
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:32,583
Have your lunch.

269
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:37,249
Her name says 'calm' but she
should have been named 'angry'

270
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,041
She is a bit egoistic.

271
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,749
Doctor...
- Yes.

272
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,624
Hair and ego are connected
you know how?

273
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:52,833
What's that connection?

274
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:57,458
Why is hair given as offering in
Tirupati and Pazhani temples?

275
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,999
People shaving their head? lt's a belief.

276
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,916
Hair is false identity. Ego is the same.

277
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,624
Head will be weightless
once we unload both!

278
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,124
How did you get this philosophy?

279
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,624
My uncle told

280
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:18,999
See, your ego is like your hair.

281
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,666
Both are less!

282
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,749
Holy mother, you are Goddess of...

283
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,249
...words (Saraswathy) not
that of wealth (Lakshmy)!

284
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:34,541
Hello

285
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:41,583
Hello is fine, but why don't you pick
up phone or call back later?

286
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,583
And what about money?

287
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:49,708
Don't behave like a witch,
you're named after Goddess.

288
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,166
Send money fast.

289
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,124
Mother please

290
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,458
What's your problem?
- Nothing.

291
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,958
Be careful. You are in Dubai.

292
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,999
Wasting money is easy.

293
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:10,791
Don't spend for personal comforts.

294
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:14,458
Send money to
build the hospital.

295
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,624
Or l will dead ashamed.

296
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:20,208
Mother...

297
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:23,999
Any problem?

298
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,624
Doctor, this is personal.
Don't take X- Ray of that too.

299
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,624
Please.

300
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:36,291
Sorry.

301
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,291
l am sorry

302
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,833
lt's ok, any real problem at home?

303
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,166
Nothing serious doctor.

304
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,791
lf it's too personal, don't tell.

305
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:28,458
lt's my mother.

306
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,999
After my father died of
no proper treatment.

307
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:39,541
She wished to make me a doctor
and build a hospital in our village.

308
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:46,666
ln my case Goddesses of wealth and
word didn't match, so became a nurse!

309
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,416
l came to Dubai to make
money for the hospital.

310
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,499
And always she yells
'money' over the phone!

311
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:04,124
What do you expect from me?

312
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,916
When l saw your eyes..

313
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:14,499
..your whole body was electrified by
heavy current and relay was cut.

314
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,249
Almost like that.

315
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:17,833
How did you know?

316
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,833
l can understand the disease
of a smart young doctor...

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,124
...like you would have, seeing
a young nurse like me?

318
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:26,249
No Lakshmi. l really feel it

319
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:30,416
Women also have emotions like men.

320
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,624
But if the couple loses control and
gets into trouble women will be blamed.

321
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,291
What are you talking?

322
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,624
l am really serious about you.

323
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,333
Reply me carefully.

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,291
Will an ordinary Tamil nurse like
me be acceptable in your home?

325
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,166
Take me in after enough thought.

326
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,999
Now leave me, at my place!

327
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,291
Lakshmi!

328
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,666
Think a hundred
times before you answer.

329
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:14,333
This is my question for today.

330
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,249
You may answer tomorrow.

331
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:17,958
Till then, salute!

332
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,833
Hi!

333
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,291
Did you think hundred times?

334
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,791
- Yes, hundred and eight times.

335
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:59,166
"ls it fine to touch you touch-me-not?"

336
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:06,874
"May l surround you
without moving away?"

337
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,374
"Express the wish of your heart"

338
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:15,166
"Enough of your game"

339
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:19,333
"Change your ways"

340
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,541
"ln need of love"

341
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:29,666
"ls it fine to touch you touch-me-not?"

342
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:37,541
"lt's better to keep a distance"

343
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,833
"Don't have a bit of love?"

344
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,833
"Wouldn't you look at me?"

345
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,749
"l shall read your palm"

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,583
"Adorn you with bangles"

347
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,541
"And hum a song in your ear"

348
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,083
"Sure l am in love with
desire unspoken"

349
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:42,208
"But, darling let me take my time
Now leave me for a while"

350
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:51,708
"See the rainbow from my shoulder"

351
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:58,749
"Like heaven on earth"

352
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:05,999
"Bent softly and let's merge"

353
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:13,333
"ls it fine to touch you touch-me-not"

354
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:21,374
"lt's better to keep a distance"

355
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:56,499
"Mirror-like heart in front"

356
00:28:57,209 --> 00:29:04,249
"Longing for affection"

357
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:21,958
"Don't you feel the honey

Okay. Cool. Put me in jail,
l am prepared for that.

413
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,666
All right. l'll give three whole

414

Okay?

415

This is your life line and it says you are
going to have coffee with me today.

418
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,541
Are you?

l can drop you home.

421
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:03,041
You are a doctor, why don't you
maintain minimum financial discipline?

422
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,041
Good question, but l've
been thinking about it.

423
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,041
Today is Thursday, isn't it?
- Yes

424
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:10,166
l shall start practicing
discipline from Sunday.

425
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:14,666
Don't make fun of it!
Take life a bit more serious.

426
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,833
But wouldn't get a
second chance with life!

427
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:23,999
Somebody should be there to
control you. Get married fast.

428
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,999
l will. Let it be a financial manager.
Hope you are not married.

429
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,541
Close the loan first.

430
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,499
l don't want to marry a gentleman
who is ready to go to jail at any time!

431
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:42,666
l shall try.
- Yeah!

432
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,708
Excuse me sir, your bill.

Now l know where
all your money is going.

436
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:06,833
What!

437
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,208
Doctor

438
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,249

00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,749
Younger sister passed MBBS, She is the

...or Pediatrics for post-graduation.

443
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,083
What's your opinion?

444
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:30,666
Allow her to choose.

445
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:35,333
Getting lot of proposals, she is adamant
to get a partner from same profession.

446
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,458
Have you seen her photograph?
- No.

447
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,833
See this!

448
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,833

You know you have got a
travel ban. You cannot go.

488
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:05,208
Do one thing.

489
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,374
Meet and convince our credit manager.

490
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,958
He is the one who can
do something about it.

491
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:12,499
He is also a Mallu Mr.Narayanan.

492
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,999

493

Minister has family with him.

496
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:23,208
Money is needed to
look after all of them.

497
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:27,916
Let's include Sooppy Haji, he
will be enthusiastic to give bills.

498
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,041
Will see at club in the evening.

499
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,999
Sorry Dr.Arun, some social networking!

500
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,874
lt's alright sir!

501
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,458
So you have a travel ban.

502
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:41,833
Means to leave the country
you must repay the loan.

503
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:43,874
What to do now?

504
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,624
Do something Sir.
Mother is in hospital

505
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,499
Close to 500,000 Dirhams.

506
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,624
lt's a lot of money.

507
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:57,333
Your mother has any serious illness?

508
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,749
Took loan for that?

509
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,499

510
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,791
Your family?

00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,791
Not yet married. Only mother and me.

513
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:09,291
A smart young bachelor
staying alone in Dubai...

514
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:12,874
...doesn't need much time to
spend that kind of money.

515
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:16,458
ln short salary is divided between banks.

516
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,666
Nothing to spend for oneself.

517
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,583
No use for saying that.

518
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,708
This is a complicated issue.

519
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,166
But let me try.

520
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:26,916
Please sir.

00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,333
l will call you.

00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:47,999

584
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,916
This is a case of Anaplastic Glioma.

585
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,958
You know it's an aggressive tumor.

586
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:32,624
May be secondary.

587
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,249
Who is she to you?

588
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:40,708
Her mother is my cousin.

589
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,249
We just did a primary
symptomatic treatment.

590
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,499
Need to think of future treatment plan.

591
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:51,958
lt'd be good to refer to lndia.

592
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,583
Maya's parents are no more.

593
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,458
Both had CA.

594
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:59,583
There's nobody for her in lndia.

595
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,749
We'll shift her to our
hospital after two days.

596
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:05,833
There are advanced facilities.

597
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:06,749
That's fine.

598
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,916
Her fiance Deepak is in Paris.

599
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,999
l'll speak to him and decide future plans.

600
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,166
You are so lucky!

601
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:30,916
Why?

602
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:34,749
Have a pure water lake for daily
bath, a job in government school...

603
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:41,124
...Parents, friends, native food,
what a life man!

604
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,999
As if someone has forced you into jail!

605
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:44,874
Didn't you decide it?

606
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:48,999
Now l know what all are missed.

607
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,083
When l wander around
hospitals with your mother...

608
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:55,291
...and my mother, l have cursed you.

609
00:47:55,917 --> 00:48:01,124
What's the use of being a doctor,
if it's not for your mother?

610
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:06,458
What's great about
being in a foreign land?

611
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,249
Living in tallest building in the world.

612
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,041
Dashing around in costly car.

613
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,958
Enjoying Dubai's night life
which fades with daybreak.

614
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,374
Leave it and come back..

615
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,416
l'm also bored of the pomp.

616
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:25,166
Can't be back before settling
liabilities incurred by myself.

617
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:30,333
Aren't you coming in?

618
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,958

Let's have it.

619
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:36,999

fortune. Enjoy it yourself!

00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:38,749
Bye.

621
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:44,749
Did you eat?

622
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:49,708
Advised to have no-salt
wheat porridge, had it earlier.

623
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,541
Why take trouble of making
food when not well?

624
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:57,833
Making a little food is no
trouble, a Tamil girl helps out.

625
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:04,166
She, her husband and child
stay at our old out house.

626
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:07,333
Now they are my friends and security.

627
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:16,333
Wedding brokers frequent
here asking your next visit.

628
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,666
Will l be able to see it at least this time?

629
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,041
l am applying for your passport.

630
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:24,958
To take you with me when l go

She seems smart financially too.

They would buy you off!

658
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,333
There will no need for bargaining.

l am not asking why you got such debt.

701
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:50,124
When you went for studies
l stayed with you and troubled a lot.

702
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:55,708
When you got job you
enjoyed your freedom.

703
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,999
You can't be blamed for that.

704
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,833
l don't want this home at my age.

705
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:17,708
Sell it if this burden would
be raised from you.

706
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:23,499
l mean that shouldn't
be a block to get married.

707
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:24,999
What are you saying?

708
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:29,833
l'll manage that, but need sometime.

709
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:34,624
Astrologer said one more
thing while checking match.

710
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,583
lf wedding doesn't happen
now, it won't happen soon.

711
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:42,874
l won't stay long to burden you.

712
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,041

- Keep quiet.

714
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,874
Don't forget to lock the door sir.
- Yes. - Bye.

715
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:18,499
Wait a minute.

716
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:29,999
Take this. Don't give it to anyone.

717
00:55:58,917 --> 00:55:59,458
Arun!

718
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:08,624
Surprise, just thought of
you. This is telepathy.

719
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:14,333
Hello.

720
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,749
Hello Lakshmi, How are you?

721
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,083
Look what you are asking.

722
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:27,458
See such a crack l am,
how's mother's health?

723
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:28,791
She is fine.

724
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:31,833
How's your rural duty?

725
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,666
Village is always village.

726
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,416
People with less education
don't leave village.

727
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:43,499
And those with more learning
go to cities. l realize it here.

728
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:47,166
Only l am speaking.

729
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,624
What happened?
Do you have any health problem?

730
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:52,416
No, just a cold.

731
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,166
Because of weather change.

732
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:58,666
Dubai is just a desert
without you my play boy!

733
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,249
When will you be back?

734
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:05,416
Hello.

735
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:08,041
Lakshmi..

736
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,208
l am sorry.

737
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:17,624
Why sorry?

738
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:21,541
What happened?

739
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:24,374
Hello.

740
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:30,249
Are you there?

741
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:31,999
Nothing.

742
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:32,958
Good night.

743
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,999
Hello.

744
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,166
Your selection is good.

745
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,249
lt's time for the moment.

746
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:02,499
This l got as championship
for state youth festival.

747
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:06,416
Actress Malini Nair got only second.

748
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:10,249
When l became champion,
got offers from films.

749
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,541
But father didn't allow.

750
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:12,916
Really?
- Yes.

751
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,583
l wished to learn dance in
Kalakshetra, Chennai.

752
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,333
Father didn't want me to go out
of state. l went to Kalamandalam.

753
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,541
Let me make
grandma's breakfast ready.

754
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,166

755
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,874
Sweet Sachin!

Good morning Grandma

757
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:35,833
Good morning young boy,
hope you had a sweet night

758
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:36,874
- Yes.

759
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:40,541
You are in Dubai right?
- Yes.

760
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:44,416
l have been there for few hours.
- ls it? - Yeah!

761
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:46,874
When l was coming from London.

762
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:51,041
Rajasree's Grandpa was
chartered Accountant in London.

763
01:00:51,209 --> 01:00:51,708
Really?

764
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,958
- Yes.

765
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,374
Last time. That was in 1979.

766
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,374
We flew via Dubai.

767
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:06,249
My daughter Sumitra, your mother
in-law too is British educated.

768
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,499
Primary level.

769
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,708
Then her father was fascinated by this
land and came to this remote place.

770
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,749
Sumitra went to learn type writing.

771
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:22,499
Gopalan Nair who was a clerk
in post office seduced her.

772
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,333
Doomed love.

773
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:28,249
Then started disaster of this family.

774
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:30,666
Do you like this place?

775
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:31,708
Old house.

776
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,499
Corn flakes ready for you Grandma

777
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:36,666
l don't like their 'Dosa' and 'ldli' you see.

778
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:38,874
Corn flakes in the morning.

779
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:41,374
2 chapathis and a piece
of chicken for lunch.

780
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,374
At night, soup and vegetables.

781
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,374
Started this routine abroad.

782
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:50,041
Pray it lasts till l die.

783
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:52,166
Bye see you.
- Bye.

784
01:01:56,334 --> 01:01:58,291
Where is the battalion of your uncles?

785
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,124
They went yesterday night.

786
01:02:07,584 --> 01:02:10,916
You won't have seen this big a
traditional house before. Right?

787
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,291
Yes, yes. What a huge house!

788
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,749
Uncles are thinking whether to
renovate or disjoint this house for selling.

789
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,999
Are you going to dispose this?
- This is ancestral property.

790
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:24,749
Mother was adamant of selling
it only after my wedding.

791
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,583
And father wanted a
doctor as my husband.

792
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:30,624
All were pacified yesterday.

793
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,666
Mother signed the deed.

794
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,624
We will have a share of the property.

795
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:39,583
Our share is one among 92.
Still it won't be too bad.

796
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:40,916
lt will be enough money?

797
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:42,416
Means?

798
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:45,124
Three and half lakh rupees!!

799
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:45,833
What?!!!

800
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:53,624
Father will see you after breakfast.

801
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,833
He has something to give you.

802
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:06,624
Arun had breakfast?
- Yes.

803
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:10,916
Thinking of giving Arun his
share. Let him be happy.

804
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,624
Yes. That's right.
- Then, call him.

805
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:16,374
He is there, come.
- Right.

806
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,583
This is Usha, my aunt's daughter.

807
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:20,208
See this is me.

808
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,541
Sit.

809
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,624
Call Grandma, let her be happy too.

810
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:31,166
What about that?
- Yes. That's right.

811
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:37,624
As your family is aristocratic,
didn't ask for anything.

812
01:03:38,084 --> 01:03:40,583
lt's our aristocracy to
give before asking.

813
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,083
What is your opinion?
- Yes.

814
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:45,999
Grandma be careful.

815
01:03:51,334 --> 01:03:51,999
Ok, now listen.

816
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,041
10 units of land.

817
01:03:55,667 --> 01:04:00,874
Not costly now but will get
returns when rice is in demand.

818
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,583
lt is made a deed in Rajasree's name.

819
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,333
What about that?
- Yes.

820
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,999
Heard it?
- Yes. Very fine.

821
01:04:08,334 --> 01:04:08,916
Not over.

822
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,208
FD in bank.

823
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,333
25000 rupees in cash.

824
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:21,249
Ownership of the vehicle in courtyard
can be changed to Arun's name.

825
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:25,749
When bought in 1984,
it was brand new.

826
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:35,791
Rajashree would be
taken to Dubai, right?

827
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,749
- Yes, will do the
formalities once l get there.

828
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,874
l haven't gone out of the district.

829
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:49,208
lf you insist we both
shall come to Dubai.

830
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:50,208
That's alright.

831
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,666
During shopping
festival l need a visa too.

832
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:58,124
To see global village.
l will definitely come.

833
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,041
Yeah!

834
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:02,333
Dear, aren't you happy?

835
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:10,666
Let Rajasree take
possession of all these.

836
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:11,999
He might be shy.

837
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,333
Proud youngsters would
not accept dowry.

838
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:16,624
Come.

839
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,166
God!!

840
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:55,958

He reached.

844
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:02,458
Tell her.

845
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:06,666
You forgot to take the money
my father gave. lsn't?

846
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,583
Didn't forget.

847

lt's for you to buy some peanuts.

848
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:10,166
What?!!

849
01:06:10,709 --> 01:06:16,583
Not just you, give it to all at home
uncle- manager Narayanan.

850
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,583
Father is right.

851
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:20,541
About what?

852
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:25,958
That you are too proud! lsn't that
the reason for not liking the dowry?

853
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:28,291
You understood?

854
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:31,666
Who else would understand you?

855
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:35,249

856
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:36,874
- Yes here. l will give.

- Yes mother.

859
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,499
Prepare to take her at the earliest.

860
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:51,916
Don't delay because of me.

861
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:53,083
Okay.

862
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,208
Didn't you like her?

863
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,458
You liked her. lsn't?

864
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:03,916
She is so naive! Keep
talking, Liked her a lot.

865
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:04,666
That's enough.

866
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,833
Please stop here.

867
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:39,124
Basheer, are you in
flat? l don't have key.

868
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:41,291
There is a problem.

869
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,458
Wife and baby came early.

870
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:46,666
Didn't hassle you during wedding.

871
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:48,374
Look for another place.

872
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:51,416
So fast, how will l find?

873
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:54,416
Sorry, it's her father's flat.

874
01:07:54,959 --> 01:08:00,958
lf they know l shared the flat with
someone for pocket money...

875
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,083
...it won't look good.

876
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,166
You can skip the rent you owe me.

877
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,874
l have packed all your stuff.

878
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:07,708
Come downstairs.

01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:22,666
A studio flat, one bedroom is fine.

881
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:28,666
A two bedroom is free 90000
Dirhams per year rent. Single 70000.

882
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,291
Look for a lower range.

883
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:36,916
There's a flat. But will have
to give some key money.

884
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:39,958
Come on, set it up.

885
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:41,041
What's the rent?

886
01:08:41,459 --> 01:08:43,124
We'll wrap it up in 45000.

887
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:48,749

commission. 2000 Dirhams security.

888
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,124
But first 19000 has to be cash.

889
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:53,666
Okay.

01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,999

Sit here Shukur. l'll be back soon.
- Yes.

893
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:53,458
"Flowers are going away"

894
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:02,124
"Spring is a burning memory"

895
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,999
"Why did the dragon fly go?"

896
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:13,708
"Why so quickly darkness came in?"

897
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:22,958
"When colors run
down, desert is silent"

898
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:37,041
"Flowers are going away"

899
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,833
"Spring is a burning memory"

900
01:10:49,084 --> 01:10:52,583
"Why did the dragon fly go?"

901
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:57,749
"Why so quickly darkness came in?"

902
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:00,291
Hi Arun.
- Hi. - Come in.

903
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:01,041
lsn't doctor aunty in?

904
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,124
Savitri, Arun for you

905
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:10,583
A small get together. Come on join us.

906
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,499
lt's fine. l'll come some other time.

907
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,749
Savithri aunty...
- l am coming.

908
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,208
Keep in the other room.

909
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,874
Brother, all is ready?

910
01:11:25,084 --> 01:11:26,666
Anything is clear.

911
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:27,291
Come.

912
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,249
Come

913
01:11:30,459 --> 01:11:31,458
Where will you sleep?

914
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,499
Camp has lot of space.

915
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,249
Big family.

916
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,874
Until you get the flat, try adjusting.

917
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,041
lt's cozy here.

918
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:43,208
l thought labor camp is congested.

919
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:46,833
All that is work of jealousy.

920
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,624
You are tired, take rest.

921
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:53,833
We all have been waiting to
consult you with diseases.

922
01:11:54,334 --> 01:11:55,124
We will see tomorrow.

923
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:56,124
Take rest.

924
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:57,833
Good night.
- Good night.

925
01:11:58,334 --> 01:11:58,999
Bye.

926
01:12:13,084 --> 01:12:17,416
lsn't he the guy we went
to see in Burj Khalifa?

927
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:20,708
Yes. Then he was busy
in Operation Theatre

928
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,583
Let us adjust for him to sleep well

929
01:12:23,584 --> 01:12:27,333
As if you sleep in suite
everyday! Shut up

930
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:36,999
Tallest building is just a fall
away from Earth, isn't it?

931
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:46,333
Don't be jealous, it's just for
two days until he gets a flat.

932
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:52,416
He came to us because
he felt close to us.

933
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,999
Wouldn't he get good hotels to stay?

934
01:12:57,417 --> 01:13:02,333
He can't reduce himself to a labor camp.

935
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,916
Shut up and sleep

936
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:08,833
Come.

937
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,833
Venuetta..come..see

938
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,458
Good morning.
- Good morning.

939
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:19,749
Hello
- Hi.

940
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:35,833
How many times l called,
why didn't you call back?

941
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:40,124
Got a bit busy after coming..
How is your rural duty?

942
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,374
See what you are asking.

943
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:44,999
How will l be there
when you are here?

944
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:47,958
That's duty, this is beauty.

945
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:04,666
The wedding treat can't be limited to
just a sweet, you must give a party.

946
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:13,541
What's she talking?

947
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:18,249
You got married?

948
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:20,583
- Yes.

949
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:46,041
There's an emergency situation.

950
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,666
Please come to the casualty.

951
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:55,791
What happened?

952
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,249
Anaplastic Glioma.

953
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:03,249
l have asked staff to shift
belongings from her room to mine.

954
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:04,624
You want to go there.

955
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:07,124
There could be some valuables.
Please look after it.

956
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,499
Good morning sir.

957
01:17:43,084 --> 01:17:47,999
You wanted this transfer, now you
want to go back to the same place.

958
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:48,833
What happened?

959
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,666
Speak if it's urgent, pick up the phone.

960
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:55,208
lt's fine.

961
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:59,458
What happened? Are you okay?

962
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,208
Nothing doctor.

963
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:07,916
l realized l feel almost at home
while serving the rural clinic.

964
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,541
That's the reason l want to go back.
- Okay.

965
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:10,999
As you say.

966
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:13,624
l'll tell the office.

967
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:16,083
You may go.

968
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:17,166
Thanks.

969
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:25,749
Lakshmi..

970
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:40,583
Why are you looking dull?

971
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:41,874
- Nothing.

972
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,416
You are like Oxygen of
Oncology department.

973
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,958
lf you are dull this place
will go down in energy.

974
01:18:50,584 --> 01:18:51,041
Have it.

975
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,958
Are you missing Rajasree?

976
01:18:55,584 --> 01:18:57,916
Maya is transferred to room.

977
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,166
Poor girl!

978
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,416
Did you see her?
- Yes.

979
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,458
How quick is the change
in peoples life story..isn't?

980
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,166
Story changed earlier.
We got to know now.

981
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,416
What?

982
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:12,666
Disease was diagnosed
some months back.

983
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,583
She got fine with treatment in France.

984
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,333
She didn't tell me any of this.

985
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:21,541
Second generation of elite class
staying abroad has this problem.

986
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,791
They are in touch either
with parents or friends.

987
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:28,708
Won't be connected to
relatives or fellow countrymen.

988
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:31,333
l'm the only close relative Maya has.

989
01:19:31,542 --> 01:19:33,999
l did post-graduation in
UK staying with them.

990
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:39,041
She came to start business
here; to be away from loneliness.

991
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:42,874
Maya is engaged to one Deepak, right?

992
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:43,833
- Yes.

993
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,958
That relation was fixed
when her parents were alive.

994
01:19:47,584 --> 01:19:50,166
Knowing about the illness,
his attitude changed.

995
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:59,666
More than illness
Deepak's change struck her.

996
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:04,333
She found he was avoiding
her because of disease.

997
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,083
Do me a favor.

998
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,249
Maya's depressed.

999
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:22,833
Share your positive attitude towards life
with her - As a doctor, as a good friend.

1000
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:25,499
Sure

1001
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:31,458
Come on doctor

1002
01:20:33,084 --> 01:20:34,999
Look at our smart lady

1003
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,333
Blood parameters are within range.

1004
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,833
When is the final chemo?

1005
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:48,958
Next Wednesday.

1006
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,333
That's the last thing.

1007
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,833
Only follow up is needed later.

1008
01:20:56,584 --> 01:20:58,499
Why are you eager
to get discharged?

1009
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,999
Here is Arun.

1010
01:21:01,584 --> 01:21:02,124
Hello

1011
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:04,041
Hi aunty.
- Hi.

1012
01:21:05,084 --> 01:21:05,624
Maya!

1013
01:21:06,584 --> 01:21:08,916
You carry on, l'll see you later.
- Cool.

1014
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,124
Bye.
- Bye.

1015
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:17,416
So when you are going
to design my costumes?

1016
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:21,833
Couldn't start Boutique..so..
- Now you got more time for that.

1017
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:22,999
You read books?

1018
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,666
Yeah. l love to read.
- Wow!

1019
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:26,124
Got something for you.

1020
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:29,041
Few of my favorites.

1021
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,249
Medicine for the spirit!

1022
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,374
So, l'll get going and see you around.

1023
01:21:39,084 --> 01:21:39,833
Bye.
- Bye.

1024
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:46,249
Tomorrow l'll present the cheque.

1025
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:51,166
Not like in Kerala you know.

1026
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:56,291
No use of getting emotional. Got it?

1027
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,624
So where did we stop?

1028
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:03,583
Talk about cash, yes or no?

1029
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:09,666
l stopped giving money on
passport and blank cheque.

1030
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,166
You have any valuable stuff?

1031
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:16,166
l can give 80% of cost.

1032
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,916
Come and get quick cash.

1033
01:22:25,084 --> 01:22:27,999
Got to go, have a meeting.

1034
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:34,499
Think in that direction, anything to pawn?

1035
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:07,291
The mobile phone you
have dialed is switched off.

1036
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:41,541
Hello.

1037
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:44,291
Hello
- l'm Maya

1038
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:45,583
Hey Maya! How are you doing?

1039
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:47,249
l am fine!

1040
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,916
But...
- What happened?

1041
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:50,208
Nothing.

1042
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:54,166
When l was in hospital
wanted to get out fast.

1043
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,749
But now l miss hospital.
- ls it?

1044
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:03,541
Called doctor aunty, didn't get through.

1045
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:05,374
Today is her surgery day.

1046
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,541
Free in the evening?

1047
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,833
Who? Me?
- Yes.

1048
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:13,333
Yes.

1049
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:15,374
Can we meet somewhere?

1050
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:16,999
Sure.

1051
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,833
Okay. Text me when and where.

1052
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,999
Okay. See you soon.

1053
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:21,791
Thank you.

1054
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,166
Bye.

1055
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:50,583
Since l met you was wondering..
- What?

1056
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:54,833
A doctor, handling serious diseases.
How can he behave so light?

1057
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:55,916
That's very simple.

1058
01:24:56,417 --> 01:24:57,833
l have no regrets about the past.

1059
01:24:58,084 --> 01:24:59,458
l am not anxious about the future.

1060
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:01,124
l am just living in the present.

1061
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:02,833
And this is Dubai.

1062
01:25:03,084 --> 01:25:06,291
May it be happiness or sorrow;
it has a life of 10 seconds!

1063
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:12,249
ln the rush to set up my boutique
couldn't enjoy in Dubai. - ls it?

1064
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:16,791
Now that plan is
dropped, got a lot of time.

1065
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,166
How's Dubai?

1066
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,374
Maya, you know what is Maya?

1067
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:29,833
Maya means illusion, feel
a thing when nothing's there.

1068
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,499
Right?
- That's right.

1069
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:32,916
This city is like that.

1070
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:37,541
When a magician raised his
magic wand, this city was born!

1071
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:41,666
After the spell of magic,
we'll realize it was a dream!

1072
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:44,833
So the happiness and sorrow will vanish.

1073
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,833
Because it's all Maya, Maya!

1074
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:47,958
Hi!
- Check.

1075
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:52,749
ln this world the only real thing is the bill.

1076
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:55,874
To pay the real bill,
need to have real money.

1077
01:25:56,209 --> 01:26:00,166
lf you've real money, this unreal
city can be yours, real Maya!

1078
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:03,833
So pay the bill and let's
vanish into the Maya!

1079
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,874
Hello, l'm in operation theatre.

1080
01:26:39,834 --> 01:26:58,291
"Oh flower of moonlight
Ray of light is coming"

1081
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:05,458
"Let not fragrance dissolve
And honey finish off!"

1082
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:13,041
"Keep burning my flame"

1083
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:20,916
"Oh flower of moonlight
Ray of light is coming"

1084
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,416
"Dance, dance, dance, dance..."

1085
01:28:06,584 --> 01:28:09,666
'Making some dirty,
you are even to me"

1086
01:28:11,334 --> 01:28:12,999
"Dam, dam, dam, dam..."

1087
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:16,333
"Let him to dirty, can you
got to move your feet"

1088
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:05,041
l can understand crowd's reaction.

1089
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:11,833
But doctor, you forgot hair
loss with cancer treatment.

1090
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:16,624
Look who said all those philosophies!

1091
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,708
Everything is Maya, Maya!

1092
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:22,374
Now what happened?

1093
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:25,208
Philosophy would work
among doctor and patient.

1094
01:29:27,334 --> 01:29:28,999
But you are my friend. Right?

1095
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,833
You keep the car.
l'll see you tomorrow.

1096
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:47,541
Okay.

1097
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,041
Thanks for a wonderful evening.

1098
01:29:51,459 --> 01:29:52,083
Take care.

1099
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,166
Forgot.

1100
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:17,083
l am so sorry.

1101
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:17,666
lt's okay.

1102
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:20,416
Okay then. Good night.

1103
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:23,708
Can't ask you to come in,
all messed up here.

1104
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:24,708
Why is it like this?

1105
01:30:26,084 --> 01:30:30,333
Didn't have a mood to
clean up. lt got delayed.

1106
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:32,958
So let's do it now. Come.
- No doctor.

1107
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:36,041
Savithri aunty said she'll get a cleaner.
- No cleaner needed for this.

1108
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:39,666
Catch.

1109
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:41,166
What are you doing?

1110
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,708
Give, l'll do it.

1111
01:30:52,042 --> 01:30:53,749
Settle the stuff in that box.

1112
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:54,499
Okay.

1113
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:16,624
Doctor.

1114
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,999
- Coming.

1115
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,499
Thought of cleaning
after seeing just this room.

1116
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:31,166
So many rooms here.

1117
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,624
For one person, isn't this a bit too much?

1118
01:31:36,334 --> 01:31:37,499
lt's a mistake.

1119
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:41,916
Said yes first with the view and all.

1120
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:49,166
But size of this flat made
loneliness unbearable.

1121
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:52,249
Can't you rent a portion to someone?

1122
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:54,541
lt'd be problematic if
the person is wrong.

1123
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:57,708
Where do you stay?

1124
01:31:58,292 --> 01:32:01,833
l..am looking for a flat.

1125
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:04,166
Now adjusting with friends.

1126
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,916
lf you don't mind, stay here.

1127
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,249
A non-problematic
bachelor is fine with me.

1128
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,708
No, it'll be a burden for you.

1129
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:21,333
And aunty won't like it.

1130
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:24,708
l don't have a clean chit!

1131
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:30,166
Then let's not tell her.

1132
01:32:31,209 --> 01:32:32,499
l need it for a short period.

1133
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,916
Will go when l get a flat.

1134
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:38,874
How much is the rent?

1135
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,583
Let's think about it later

1136
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:42,708
So, l'll be here tomorrow.

1137
01:32:42,959 --> 01:32:44,208
Okay.

1138
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:45,916
Bye.
- Bye.

1139
01:32:51,959 --> 01:32:55,166
"Voice of rain fingers"

1140
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:06,374
"Kindly write a line on sand"

1141
01:33:06,959 --> 01:33:13,249
"A droplet of water be shared"

1142
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:20,791
"Just a good word is needed"

1143
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:24,916
"Wanderlust in the moist air"

1144
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:28,333
"Holding the passion of life"

1145
01:33:28,584 --> 01:33:31,083
"Come oh, flower petal!"

1146
01:33:31,084 --> 01:33:38,249
"Oh, flower of moonlight
Ray of light is here!"

1147
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:16,583
"Come, butterfly of the moment"

1148
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:24,666
"Butterfly of the moment
Come, drink honey"

1149
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:31,999
"Oh, rising ray of light, adorn gold"

1150
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:38,666
"Will a bird chirp by window?"

1151
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:46,124
"Will a river flow in desert?"

1152
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:53,916
"ln a chariot of breeze,
gathering flowers of rain"

1153
01:34:54,209 --> 01:34:56,416
"Come oh, dark cloud!"

1154
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:06,124
"Oh, flower of moonlight
Ray of light is here"

1155
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:20,416
Maya, please bring some water.

1156
01:35:21,417 --> 01:35:21,999
Coming.

1157
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:34,833
What?

1158
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:36,166
- lt didn't dry yet.

1159
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:37,833
One minute.

1160
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:00,166
Maya..

1161
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:18,291
l was staying with
Venuettan in labor camp.

1162
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:20,833
All of them took trouble for me.

1163
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,833
So when Maya said...l...

1164
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:27,583
Does she know you got married?

1165
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:29,499
- No.

1166
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:31,083
Why?

1167
01:36:32,834 --> 01:36:33,916
She didn't ask.

1168
01:36:35,209 --> 01:36:38,124
When you met her, you weren't married.

1169
01:36:39,334 --> 01:36:42,166
Poor thing believes it's the same. lsn't it?

1170
01:36:44,292 --> 01:36:45,249
My God!

1171
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:46,958
She is just a good friend.

1172
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,458
She likes my presence.

1173
01:36:49,084 --> 01:36:49,583
That's all?

1174
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:56,374
l got sense to know where
this relationship will end.

1175
01:36:58,875 --> 01:36:59,666
Tell me the truth.

1176
01:37:00,459 --> 01:37:04,333
While staying together did
anything happen among you?

1177
01:37:05,042 --> 01:37:06,416
l mean, physical..

1178
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:07,249
- No.

1179
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:12,416
Okay. Shift from here today.

1180
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:18,041
Bring Rajasree here soon.

1181
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:19,208
Rent a flat.

1182
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,583
l shall pay for all.

1183
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,583
Are you getting what l said?

1184
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:25,749
- Yes.

1185
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:31,499
l'll tell some lie to Maya.

1186
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:34,916
Don't hurt her now.

1187
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,916
Frequent visits and
phone calls must stop.

1188
01:37:38,417 --> 01:37:39,041
Understand?

1189
01:38:04,834 --> 01:38:07,791
Here vehicles have steering
on the other side. lsn't it?

1190
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:20,499
Your mother was tense
than me about visa.

1191
01:38:20,917 --> 01:38:23,499
She prayed a special
offering in Uthrattoor temple.

1192
01:38:23,709 --> 01:38:27,166
Next day you called saying visa is ready.

1193
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:34,333
l have people in Dubai,
other than uncle and aunty.

1194
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:42,083
(Naming aunts and cousins)
such a lot of people.

1195
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,333
All are waiting for me.

1196
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:50,499
A sister has car and driving license.

1197
01:38:50,709 --> 01:38:53,666
She's asking me to learn driving.

1198
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:56,333
l ride cycle at home.

1199
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:59,708
Would it be easier to get driving license?

1200
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:03,333
Here only cycle balance
is needed for license.

1201
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:15,208
Special jack fruit!

1202
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,291
What all in this?

1203
01:39:19,542 --> 01:39:21,208
That's not for us.

1204
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:26,583
Those are for my
relatives sent from their homes.

1205
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:39,666
Why are you shocked?

1206
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:43,041
Your wife is rich with relatives.

1207
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:45,166
Come..

1208
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:49,124
Uncle! - Daughter!
- All of you are here

1209
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,999
We are not staying long.

1210
01:39:52,334 --> 01:39:55,333
On our way back from
a celebration at club.

1211
01:39:55,542 --> 01:39:59,499
Just came here and thought
of taking stuff sent from home.

1212
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:04,666
We were told about goods coming!

1213
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:10,416
Native root vegetable is also packed in.

1214
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:12,916
Then let's take the whole box.

1215
01:40:12,917 --> 01:40:14,166
Let's unpack it back home.

1216
01:40:14,584 --> 01:40:15,583
Don't waste time.

1217
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,499
Give a hand please.

1218
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:19,791
Oh, my disc has problem. Can't lift.

1219
01:40:20,334 --> 01:40:22,666
Arun, we'll meet later. Bye.
- Okay.

1220
01:40:22,834 --> 01:40:26,333
Don't you hear Arun.
Sudhakarettan..it's not to you, move.

1221
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:27,291
Come..come.

1222
01:40:27,292 --> 01:40:31,333
We'll turn her modern.
Just leave her with us.

1223
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,416
We will manage everything.

1224
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:37,499
You...

1225
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,333
Don't you know?
Now it's different.

1226
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:46,166
Take care of money.

1227
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:49,249
But don't be miserly in treating relatives.

1228
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:54,416
Cheater!, not just me, you cheated
the poor girl and her parents.

1229
01:40:54,709 --> 01:41:00,166
Tell what you just told me in the church
on your left after the round-about.

1230
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,333
You said left after
the round-about, isn't it?

1231
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,291
Right is also fine, that institution
is present on both sides.

1232
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:11,166
Our in-law won't lose his way;
he knows all routes by heart.

1233
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:13,874
Good night.

1234
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:28,624
All of them are here
so l won't feel homesick.

1235
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:30,833
And so affectionate.

1236
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:36,499
That's why they made you carry all
these. Not caring it's your first trip!

1237
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:40,541
Lot's of items!

1238
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:43,833
How can we negate relatives?

1239
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,124
lt's okay. Get some sleep.

1240
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,624
Enough of all this.

1241
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:25,249
Time to go let me go.

1242
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:30,666
Sleep well.

1243
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:32,624
You are going to be fine.

1244
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:41,249
Hello.
- Hello.

Arun, how's Rajasree?

1254
01:43:22,334 --> 01:43:22,916
She is fine.

01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:26,166
Come home with her.

1256
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:26,874

Why aren't you answering my calls?

No. This is my last and final call to
remind you about the payment deadline.

1266
01:44:21,917 --> 01:44:23,083
Why are you keeping mum?

1267
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:26,499
Sir said your wedding is done.

1268
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:28,583

01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:29,874

01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:58,791
Didn't l tell you, this is trendy?

1273
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:03,041
Though costly, it suits well.
Take this also.

01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:07,333
Okay. Where is that piece
l selected first? - lt's here.

01:45:11,334 --> 01:45:11,833
Go.

1277
01:45:13,209 --> 01:45:13,749
- Okay.

1278
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:23,833
Cash or card?

1280
01:45:37,209 --> 01:45:38,666
lt's not working.

1281
01:46:11,084 --> 01:46:11,999
My God!!

1282
01:46:18,042 --> 01:46:18,624
Sorry.

1283
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,333
No card is working madam.

1284
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,666
Don't worry, we'll ask
them to keep it aside.

1285
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:05,291
Come with Arun and take it.

Come.

01:47:24,334 --> 01:47:26,249
There is nothing with
you after shopping?

1289
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:31,499
Where are things they bought for you?

1290
01:47:32,459 --> 01:47:35,291
Why should they buy
when l have a husband?

1291
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:39,666
lt's so shameful! Not a pi in account.

1292
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:47,624
Did you ask anyone before taking?

1293
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:52,708
l thought there'll be money

1294
01:47:53,125 --> 01:47:55,166
Did you ask me before using the card?

1295
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:59,041
Have you come to insult me?

1296
01:48:00,584 --> 01:48:03,499
With those crooked
ladies to support you?

1297
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:12,499
What are you doing?

1298
01:49:02,959 --> 01:49:03,541
l'm sorry.

1299
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:09,583
Couldn't control my anger. Don't mind.

1300
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:19,624
lt's okay. l got insulted in front
of them. That's why. Sorry.

1301
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:21,374
lt's okay.

1302
01:49:22,209 --> 01:49:23,083
l may be late.

1303
01:49:23,542 --> 01:49:24,541
Have dinner and sleep.

1304
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:25,583
Okay.

1305
01:49:44,125 --> 01:49:46,708
The mobile phone you have
dialed has been switched off.

1306
01:50:10,542 --> 01:50:11,083
Hello..

1307
01:50:11,459 --> 01:50:15,333
l need some money to
pay bank. Please help.

1308
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,874
My uncle in Abu Dhabi is not
well. Gave all the money l had.

1309
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:24,749
Sorry.
Come on.

1310
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:26,499
Who you are talking to?

1311
01:50:27,334 --> 01:50:30,041
Does your aunt speak Hindi? Carry on.

1312
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:36,333
Come on.

1313
01:50:37,459 --> 01:50:38,791
Hello Doctor brother!

1314
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,624
Shukur, there's a small problem.

1315
01:50:42,375 --> 01:50:48,249
Some payments are late.
Could you adjust some money?

1316
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:52,333
ln trouble. Three of my
credit cards are pending.

1317
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:55,624
Also, mother keeps calling for money.

1318
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,499
There needs to be
a solution. Very urgent.

1319
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:00,958
Ask other friends.

1320
01:51:01,417 --> 01:51:02,833
All are having problems.

1321
01:51:03,917 --> 01:51:07,166
Why don't you ask Maya?

1322
01:51:07,792 --> 01:51:11,333
Now she is the best to depend.

1323
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:12,458
Did you ask her?

1324
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:13,874
- No.

1325
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:16,041
Do try that.

1326
01:51:16,542 --> 01:51:18,666
What's a friendship if
you can't borrow money?

1327
01:51:20,209 --> 01:51:20,708
Okay.

1328
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:52,166
Hey surprise.

1329
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:53,583
Please come.

1330
01:51:57,334 --> 01:51:59,208
What's this?
Where is the furniture gone?

1331
01:52:01,459 --> 01:52:01,999
Come.

1332
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:05,124
Sit here for now.

1333
01:52:06,834 --> 01:52:09,833
l decided to shift.
- Why? What happened?

1334
01:52:10,417 --> 01:52:13,541
Got a good studio flat.
Small. Beautiful.

1335
01:52:13,709 --> 01:52:14,874
Why didn't you let me know?

1336
01:52:15,167 --> 01:52:17,291
Good! You leave here at that day?

1337
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:19,124
Couldn't find you after that day.

1338
01:52:20,584 --> 01:52:23,166
l called. Was not answered.

1339
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:27,166
Your things were taken by aunty.

1340
01:52:27,667 --> 01:52:30,458
She said you went on training.

1341
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:37,541
Yes. Continued medical Education
training. Couldn't answer phone there.

1342
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:43,374
When you didn't answer,
thought l was bothering you.

1343
01:52:46,917 --> 01:52:50,708
With nobody to share,
this flat is too much.

1344
01:52:51,709 --> 01:52:56,999
Living in Dubai with no
income, it's better to save.

1345
01:52:57,542 --> 01:52:59,249
Small financial control.

1346
01:53:00,084 --> 01:53:02,791
Need petrol to move the
vehicle till it stops.

1347
01:53:22,917 --> 01:53:25,999
Come and help me pack.. come

1348
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:27,833
Come..come..come.

1349
01:53:32,292 --> 01:53:35,166
l was in a cooking experiment.

1350
01:53:35,459 --> 01:53:36,874
Special soup.

1351
01:53:37,584 --> 01:53:39,499
You are today's victim.

1352
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,666
Almost ready.

1353
01:53:42,084 --> 01:53:43,333
Let packing go on.

1354
01:54:15,417 --> 01:54:21,166
Get some valuable stuff.
Will give 80% of market price.

1355
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:52,083
Soup ready.

1356
01:55:05,917 --> 01:55:15,249
l am indebted to two persons for this
second life, Dr. Savithri and Dr. Arun.

1357
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:17,749
Why so?

1358
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:25,041
When the disease recurred
l was totally depressed.

1359
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:30,666
Both of you motivated me out of it.

1360
01:55:33,542 --> 01:55:35,874
Some of the best days in my life.

1361
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:43,083
That's enough until l live.

1362
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,666
Great experiment.

1363
01:56:01,375 --> 01:56:01,833
Thank you.

1364
01:56:04,584 --> 01:56:06,499
This is the last night in this flat.

1365
01:56:08,417 --> 01:56:09,416
Tomorrow l'll move.

1366
01:56:11,584 --> 01:56:12,124
Okay.

1367
01:56:25,292 --> 01:56:26,083
Thanks for coming.

1368
01:57:57,042 --> 01:57:57,541
What happened?

1369
01:57:57,834 --> 01:57:59,374
He took the advance.

1370
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:00,541
Now he'll do it.

1371
01:58:01,542 --> 01:58:02,999
Don't get tensed.

1372
01:58:03,459 --> 01:58:05,583
What use is it to keep
the necklace in her box?

1373
01:58:05,834 --> 01:58:09,124
Let's pawn it with 'Blade
Mathai' and get loan.

1374
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:12,041
ln turn bank will issue a new loan.

1375
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:16,458
With that money we can put
original necklace back in the box.

1376
01:58:17,417 --> 01:58:20,666
lf we take it as theft, it will upset us.
Think it's a week's adjustment!

1377
01:58:24,542 --> 01:58:25,666
No. l don't think so.

1378
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:33,666
Arun..

1379
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:43,874
Arunetta...

1380
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,374
Did you get bored?
- Let's go.

1381
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:52,958
l just took two. Rest l gave
back not to waste your money.

1382
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:28,374
Lakshmi...

1383
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,499
Finished your rural posting?

1384
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:34,333
Lakshmi..

1385
01:59:38,125 --> 01:59:38,999
Leave me alone.

1386
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:05,041
Hello.

1387
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:12,666
lt's me, it's fine you're late to sent
money, but l can't bear your silence.

1388
02:00:13,792 --> 02:00:17,041
l sent you over the sea for
work at marriageable age.

1389
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:22,666
My heart bleeds at night thinking of you.

1390
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:27,249
Dear aren't you fine there?

1391
02:00:28,084 --> 02:00:30,374
Speak at least once a week.

1392
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:34,999
Mother...l'll call later.

1393
02:00:35,209 --> 02:00:35,999
Yes.

1394
02:01:54,792 --> 02:01:56,416
lt's drastically advanced.

1395
02:01:57,084 --> 02:01:58,333
There is no other option.

1396
02:01:58,959 --> 02:02:00,208
Just put her on morphine.

1397
02:02:02,584 --> 02:02:03,416
l am sorry.

1398
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:10,708
Thank you very much for your time.

1399
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:17,749
Accept the reality.

1400
02:02:18,125 --> 02:02:18,833
- Yes doctor

1401
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,166
Hi Arun.
- Hi.

1402
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:24,083
What happened?

1403
02:02:26,417 --> 02:02:27,999
Maya got admitted again.

1404
02:02:28,334 --> 02:02:29,458
lt's a relapse.

1405
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:32,374
This time very advanced.

1406
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:36,999
Was responding well to the treatment.

1407
02:02:38,042 --> 02:02:42,166
She seems to have got a mental
shock, or this wouldn't have happened.

1408
02:02:43,917 --> 02:02:47,749
Only option is to give
morphine for relief from pain.

1409
02:02:55,834 --> 02:02:56,333
lt's ok.

1410
02:03:14,334 --> 02:03:14,833
Hello.

1411
02:03:19,167 --> 02:03:20,999
ls it paining too much?
- Yes.

1412
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:27,166
This injection will lessen pain. Shall l?
- Yes.

1413
02:03:54,834 --> 02:03:55,541
Good night.

1414
02:04:28,167 --> 02:04:29,458
l can't Shukur.

1415
02:04:30,209 --> 02:04:35,041
Bro.. this is your last chance.
Later nobody can do a thing!

1416
02:04:36,667 --> 02:04:40,999
l can't do this cruelty
to that girl on death bed!

1417
02:04:41,375 --> 02:04:43,999
Don't think l am making you do wrong.

1418
02:04:44,334 --> 02:04:45,333
You are my friend.

1419
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:48,166
lf you don't do this today,
you'll be in jail tomorrow.

1420
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:54,041
When everything gets
clear, tell her a sorry.

1421
02:04:54,625 --> 02:04:57,166
She'll forgive once she
knows your problems.

1422
02:04:58,417 --> 02:04:59,333
Hold this.

1423
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:12,166
Everything will be okay man!

1424
02:06:01,292 --> 02:06:01,833
Doctor..

1425
02:06:08,417 --> 02:06:09,083
Didn't you sleep?

1426
02:06:09,459 --> 02:06:10,666
Can't sleep.

1427
02:06:19,917 --> 02:06:22,333
Nurse came and injected just now.

1428
02:06:25,459 --> 02:06:27,333
Don't think l'd be able to sleep.

1429
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:33,124
Will you give one more dose?

1430
02:06:33,125 --> 02:06:35,333
No, lt shouldn't be given.

1431
02:06:38,584 --> 02:06:39,624
Please doctor.

1432
02:06:41,917 --> 02:06:43,791
l need to sleep at least today.

1433
02:06:58,792 --> 02:06:59,499
Please..

1434
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:30,708
Hello.

1435
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:33,458
Yes, l am coming.

1436
02:10:39,334 --> 02:10:39,916
Sorry.

1437
02:10:48,167 --> 02:10:48,958
Doctor.

1438
02:10:58,125 --> 02:10:58,833
Doctor...

1439
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:00,833
Will you please sit here?

1440
02:11:13,834 --> 02:11:14,833
l am sorry.

1441
02:11:17,334 --> 02:11:20,083
Didn't know you got married.

1442
02:11:27,042 --> 02:11:29,541
You didn't mention it to me.

1443
02:11:32,584 --> 02:11:33,166
Maya..

1444
02:11:34,917 --> 02:11:35,458
l...

1445
02:11:40,417 --> 02:11:42,833
Without knowing that...l...

1446
02:11:51,917 --> 02:11:53,833
l feel so guilty...

1447
02:12:15,250 --> 02:12:17,624
l am sorry for coming into your life..

1448
02:12:26,084 --> 02:12:30,124
l feel sorry for her.. your wife..

1449
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,833
Oh my God!

1450
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,083
Dubai Emperor's hospital.

1451
02:13:40,084 --> 02:13:42,208
This is Dr.Arun from
oncology department.

1452
02:13:42,417 --> 02:13:43,999
Hi doctor.
- Hi.

1453
02:13:44,417 --> 02:13:46,958
l am not feeling well,
l'll be on leave for two days..

1454
02:13:47,292 --> 02:13:48,874
Kindly inform the HR department.

1455
02:13:49,334 --> 02:13:51,291
Okay doctor..l will do that.

1456
02:13:51,292 --> 02:13:53,374
Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

1457
02:13:57,459 --> 02:14:01,249
Rajashree..

1458
02:14:10,542 --> 02:14:15,041
Truly l never thought he
would remember my birthday.

1459
02:14:15,584 --> 02:14:20,333
He hid this gift to give a big surprise.

1460
02:14:20,917 --> 02:14:22,833
lt looks very costly.

1461
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,458
We will see now if it's
as costly as it looks.

1462
02:14:25,709 --> 02:14:28,666
My hubby gave me such a
necklace on our anniversary too.

1463
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:31,874
l was showing it off!

1464
02:14:32,292 --> 02:14:34,916
But later l came to know it was not gold.

1465
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:39,833
He's our diamond specialist.

1466
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:40,999
Give the necklace please.

1467
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,833
Good morning sir.
- Good morning sir.

1468
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:02,291
What's the matter?

1469
02:15:02,542 --> 02:15:05,083
Sir they suspect
originality of this necklace.

1470
02:15:06,167 --> 02:15:06,916
Did you check?

1471
02:15:07,125 --> 02:15:09,666
Yes its original.

1472
02:15:12,834 --> 02:15:14,874
lt has the trademark
of our London show room.

1473
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,041
Let me see.

1474
02:15:20,625 --> 02:15:22,999
This is our 'Pride' collection!
Limited edition!

1475
02:15:25,292 --> 02:15:26,291
What will be the price?

1476
02:15:27,125 --> 02:15:30,999
About 70 Lakh in lndian currency.

1477
02:15:35,917 --> 02:15:38,583
That means in this necklace,
only the purest...

1478
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,333
...and most valuable
diamonds have been used.

1479
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:47,291
Now aren't you done with
the doubt and happy? - Yes.

1480
02:15:57,459 --> 02:16:00,333
Please sit. Let me check if he is awake.

1481
02:16:17,834 --> 02:16:20,874
Thank you for this valuable birthday gift!

1482
02:16:21,417 --> 02:16:22,291
When did you take this?

1483
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:26,249
You wanted to surprise me, didn't you?

1484
02:16:26,542 --> 02:16:27,749
l found out. See!

1485
02:16:32,834 --> 02:16:34,541
Didn't you go to hospital?

1486
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,166
Not well. Fever.

1487
02:16:37,167 --> 02:16:38,666
All of them have come..

1488
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,624
All relatives are there.

1489
02:16:43,625 --> 02:16:44,999
Why did they come here now?

1490
02:16:45,584 --> 02:16:50,208
l am dancing at the anniversary
of lndian association.

1491
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:53,583
Union minister and
other VlPs are coming.

1492
02:16:53,834 --> 02:16:55,624
They have come to speak about it.

1493
02:16:55,959 --> 02:16:58,499
lf you are not well,
stay here, l'll call them in.

1494
02:16:59,167 --> 02:17:02,208
He is having fever. Come here please.

1495
02:17:02,459 --> 02:17:07,333
A doctor having fever?
Quite unheard of!

1496
02:17:07,709 --> 02:17:12,833
Though she is married, we won't
allow her talents to go unnoticed.

1497
02:17:13,084 --> 02:17:17,458
Not a small thing to get a
platform with lndian association.

1498
02:17:18,167 --> 02:17:20,208
lt's because of my
hubby's recommendation.

1499
02:17:20,792 --> 02:17:26,541
Make up, other accessories and music
is budgeted around 20000 Dirhams.

1500
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:32,249
Considering the level of exposure this
program has, this is a small amount!

1501
02:17:32,417 --> 02:17:32,916
- Yes, yes.

1502
02:17:32,917 --> 02:17:36,541
lf it's a hit, we will all start
a dance school together.

1503
02:17:36,834 --> 02:17:39,041
Dr. Arun Kumar will
then be known as the...

1504
02:17:39,042 --> 02:17:40,999
...husband of Kalamandalam Rajasree!!

1505
02:17:42,167 --> 02:17:47,124
So to get things rolling you would
need the whole sum with you.

1506
02:17:47,417 --> 02:17:51,833
Can't keep extending like the
credit card payment of bank!

1507
02:17:54,417 --> 02:17:56,333
None of you must be seen
here anymore! Get out!

1508
02:17:57,875 --> 02:17:58,333
Get out!

1509
02:18:01,417 --> 02:18:01,999
Aunty...

1510
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:06,291
Among lakhs of women in the world,
after all why did l get this dumb head.

1511
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:21,666
Hi Doctor!
- Came to see Venuvettan.

1512
02:18:23,334 --> 02:18:24,249
Hello.
- Hi.

1513
02:18:29,834 --> 02:18:30,499
What happened?

1514
02:18:30,667 --> 02:18:31,499
Where is your vehicle?

1515
02:18:32,125 --> 02:18:32,749
Has it got any complaint?

1516
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:35,208
Not the vehicle. l am faulty.

1517
02:18:37,584 --> 02:18:41,541
Engine, gear box..all shattered.

1518
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:46,166
lf you are done today, we'll go together.

1519
02:18:46,584 --> 02:18:47,666
l am coming to the camp.

1520
02:18:48,167 --> 02:18:50,083
Long time since we got together..

1521
02:18:50,792 --> 02:18:51,333
That's fine.

1522
02:18:51,792 --> 02:18:54,374
lt's Chandran's house warming.

1523
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:59,874
There's a booze party.
Hope it's not a problem.

1524
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,749
What's the problem?

1525
02:19:57,959 --> 02:19:58,541
Sorry.

1526
02:20:02,417 --> 02:20:04,083
None of you should respect me!

1527
02:20:05,292 --> 02:20:09,124
l was throwing money away
while all of you toiled for life.

1528
02:20:10,417 --> 02:20:13,166
A doctor is God's assistant.

1529
02:20:14,042 --> 02:20:18,333
But l'm a ruthless scoundrel...

1530
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:25,499
...to pay loan l'll steal or kill as needed.

1531
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:27,833
Now l am that much cruel.

1532
02:20:52,917 --> 02:20:53,708
Sorry.

1533
02:20:55,417 --> 02:21:00,124
Yesterday l lost control!

1534
02:21:00,917 --> 02:21:01,749
That's no issue.

1535
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,541
With these problems inside.. you
should've shared at least once!

1536
02:21:11,167 --> 02:21:16,499
Chandran who gave party
yesterday had to struggle 27 years.

1537
02:21:17,834 --> 02:21:20,416
To buy 3 cents of land
and build a small house.

1538
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:24,083
l'm here for 19 years.

1539
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:28,333
Dubai tempted me.

1540
02:21:30,584 --> 02:21:40,249
Faces of loved ones who wait for
money kept me away from that.

1541
02:21:42,125 --> 02:21:48,333
To travel here, your mother
helped me with money.

1542
02:21:50,417 --> 02:21:54,666
When l'm here, you must not struggle.

1543
02:21:55,292 --> 02:21:58,458
My burden is beyond your capacity.

1544
02:22:14,292 --> 02:22:18,541
l'm unable to shock you
by paying full loan amount.

1545
02:22:18,792 --> 02:22:21,249
Just a try. lt could be a possibility.

1546
02:23:10,875 --> 02:23:12,083
Didn't the problem get settled?

1547
02:23:13,125 --> 02:23:18,749
lt'd take 18 months.

1548
02:23:19,917 --> 02:23:24,166
Bank is not interested in
putting a potential payer in jail.

1549
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:28,999
Discounted 40% of total loan amount.

1550
02:23:29,917 --> 02:23:31,916
A generosity of global recession.

1551
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:32,749
What?!

1552
02:23:33,917 --> 02:23:37,333
You can pay back in 18 months.

1553
02:23:38,042 --> 02:23:40,833
l paid the first installment now.

1554
02:23:43,334 --> 02:23:44,166
Here's the receipt.

1555
02:23:46,084 --> 02:23:48,124
You may please be shocked a little!

1556
02:23:49,292 --> 02:23:49,999
How is this possible?

1557
02:23:50,334 --> 02:23:57,666
Our hard earned money came handy
to start squander rescue mission!

1558
02:23:58,625 --> 02:24:02,083
Pay without fault from next month.

1559
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:30,999
Where were you yesterday?

1560
02:24:31,834 --> 02:24:33,333
An emergency in hospital.

1561
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:37,624
Sorry didn't feel like telling you.

1562
02:24:38,417 --> 02:24:40,416
Get me a tea. Have to go out again.

1563
02:24:40,917 --> 02:24:44,791
Get ready while l am
back. Come along later.

1564
02:24:46,542 --> 02:24:47,958
l will get a tea.
- Okay.

1565
02:25:35,667 --> 02:25:36,166
Maya...

1566
02:25:38,834 --> 02:25:39,333
Sorry.

1567
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,791
lt was told you're on sick leave.

1568
02:25:48,042 --> 02:25:49,958
Are you okay?
- Yes. l am ok.

1569
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:52,916
Know what happened
when you were away?

1570
02:25:54,042 --> 02:25:56,083
Maya was critical
with Morphine overdose.

1571
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,333
That donkey of a girl
Lakshmi was on duty.

1572
02:25:59,917 --> 02:26:00,833
Such carelessness.

1573
02:26:01,125 --> 02:26:02,541
Management dismissed her.

1574
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:07,166
Maya?
- She went away.

1575
02:26:07,542 --> 02:26:07,999
What?!

1576
02:26:08,417 --> 02:26:11,374
lt was a narrow escape from overdose.

1577
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:13,333
She left hospital yesterday.

1578
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:16,916
She didn't succumb to my pressure.

1579
02:26:17,834 --> 02:26:21,041
Adamant not to waste
rest of her time in hospital.

1580
02:26:23,334 --> 02:26:24,541
You won't believe Arun..

1581
02:26:25,625 --> 02:26:30,333
...when she said bye it didn't seem
she was down with the disease.

1582
02:26:31,417 --> 02:26:35,208
Her face held a glow as
if final flame of a dying lamp.

1583
02:26:39,167 --> 02:26:40,958
lt's time for rounds.

1584
02:26:41,250 --> 02:26:42,249
Are you joining today?

1585
02:26:42,417 --> 02:26:43,374
- No, tomorrow.

1586
02:26:43,792 --> 02:26:45,583
Forgot something.

1587
02:26:46,417 --> 02:26:48,791
Maya gave to give you.

1588
02:26:52,209 --> 02:26:54,291
She specified it should
be given to Rajashri.

1589
02:28:18,334 --> 02:28:19,666
Shall we go? lt's time.

1590
02:28:24,084 --> 02:28:29,208
Lakshmi, if l've hurt you
unknowingly, don't keep it in mind.

1591
02:28:29,625 --> 02:28:30,166
Okay.

1592
02:28:58,625 --> 02:28:59,166
Where?

1593
02:28:59,625 --> 02:29:00,291
Back home.

1594
02:29:02,125 --> 02:29:05,166
lf it's because of the
overdose, you need not go.

1595
02:29:05,917 --> 02:29:06,749
l've done it.

1596
02:29:07,917 --> 02:29:09,166
l shall tell them.

1597
02:29:10,292 --> 02:29:13,458
l'd decided to go back earlier.

1598
02:29:13,834 --> 02:29:15,958
This is just a reason.

1599
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,916
You must go, isn't?
- Yes.

1600
02:29:24,417 --> 02:29:25,249
l'll drop you.

1601
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:26,583
No. l'll go in taxi.

1602
02:29:59,417 --> 02:30:03,624
Get in.

1603
02:30:46,084 --> 02:30:46,666
Lakshmi...

1604
02:30:48,375 --> 02:30:49,333
Please don't curse me.

1605
02:30:53,084 --> 02:30:54,458
l never hated you.

1606
02:30:57,125 --> 02:30:57,999
Won't forget either.

1607
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:02,916
Bye.

1608
02:31:03,292 --> 02:31:03,708
- Bye.

1609
02:31:57,250 --> 02:31:57,666
Hello.

1610
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,083
What have you kept in my bag?

1611
02:32:00,917 --> 02:32:02,208
l know you won't
accept it direct from me.

1612
02:32:02,834 --> 02:32:03,874
That's why l kept it in bag.

1613
02:32:05,584 --> 02:32:08,499
Your mother sent you for a big goal.

1614
02:32:09,459 --> 02:32:10,833
Should not leave empty handed.

1615
02:32:12,042 --> 02:32:13,291
lt costs a lot.

1616
02:32:14,625 --> 02:32:17,458
lt contains the amount needed to fulfill...

1617
02:32:17,459 --> 02:32:21,333
...your mother's dream of a
hospital for your villagers.

1618
02:32:23,334 --> 02:32:24,499
l don't need the virtue.

1619
02:32:25,709 --> 02:32:26,999
lt belongs to the person who gifted it

1620
02:33:06,917 --> 02:33:08,749
Hi, can l ask you something?

1621
02:33:09,167 --> 02:33:09,791
Sure.

1622
02:33:10,375 --> 02:33:12,416
What makes you so detached from life?

1623
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:15,208
You think l'm detached from life?

1624
02:33:15,792 --> 02:33:16,333
- Yes.

1625
02:33:17,792 --> 02:33:18,749
l've lived my life

1626
02:33:25,459 --> 02:33:30,708
l have no regrets about the past,
l am not anxious about the future.

1627
02:33:31,375 --> 02:33:32,666
l'm living in the present.

1628
02:33:54,917 --> 02:33:55,458
Beautiful.

1629
02:33:55,917 --> 02:33:56,416
- Yes.

1630
02:33:57,250 --> 02:33:58,416
You meant this necklace, isn't it?

1631
02:34:01,792 --> 02:34:05,541
You like this necklace more than
anything in this world. Don't you?

1632
02:34:05,875 --> 02:34:06,333
- Yes.

1633
02:34:06,709 --> 02:34:07,541
More than me?

1634
02:34:09,917 --> 02:34:11,874
Why did you ask such a question?

1635
02:34:13,792 --> 02:34:18,333
Have you ever loved me
as much as this necklace?

1636
02:34:51,167 --> 02:34:51,666
Sorry.
