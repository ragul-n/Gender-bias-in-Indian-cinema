1
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,500
Where are you going?
- Shopping.

2
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,958
Janu, we are getting late.
- I'm coming.

3
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,250
Aunty, I'm going.
I'll call you after landing.

4
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,500
Take care of the house.

5
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,750
We need to go today only,
by the time we reach,

6
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,958
the child would be born and
would be going to school.

7
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,250
Shouldn't I tell everyone
we are going to Delhi in flight?

8
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:55,250
You boasted about going in flight.
- What else do I've to boast about?

9
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,625
Have you kept your certificates?

10
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,292
I'm sending you to Delhi
because of bad influences here.

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Your elder brother has arranged
this interview after great effort.

12
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,500
Don't answer them arrogantly.

13
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,167
Even Gandhiji and Bose too worked
in their times.

14
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:21,042
I'm talking to you only.
- Is it?

15
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,667
Son!
- Mother!

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
What's this mom?
- Your certificates.

17
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,167
I kept it before God
and offered prayers.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,292
You may not believe in God,
I'm sure you'll get the job this time.

19
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,042
I don't like to work for salary.

20
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,667
I didn't want to hurt him
so only I agreed.

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm going mom.

22
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,917
I'm seeing article on
'Shining Star' Chandrakanth.- So what?

23
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm a great of him.
Can I read it?

24
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,542
Why to see in newspaper?
Watch him live there!

25
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,667
Tell me director, I'm in airport.

26
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,542
BY then be ready with
everything for the climax.

27
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,917
I want to take a photo with him, sir.

28
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,417
Use a helicopter.

29
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,917
Take a photo with me first.
- Are you an actor?

30
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,125
There must be hundred people...

31
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,125
Get lost man!

32
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,375
Do you know who that man is?

33
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,708
Why not?
- Who is he?

34
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,500
Isn't he the man who acts as
father-in-law of the heroine in TV soap?

35
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:59,875
Silly woman!
He's Central Minister Suryasekhar.- Is it?

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,625
Watching him all the day on TV,
I thought he might be an actor.

37
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,000
Fasten the seat belt.

38
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,208
Sir, is it you?

39
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,083
I'm Subba Rao.
I'm your great fan.

40
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,375
I'm mad about fights in your films.

41
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,083
In a recent film you rip out your
enemy arm and hit him with it.

42
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,875
And then punch dialogue you deliver,

43
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,875
'If you put hand on me,
because you've one, I'll rip it out'.

44
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,083
How nicely you ripped his hand sir.

45
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,583
It really blocked my mind, sir.

46
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,750
You look more handsome
in person sir.

47
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,375
Guess, who is sitting next
to me in flight?

48
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,375
You want a clue?

49
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,750
My wife is asking for a clue.

50
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,250
The hero who lifts Sumo car
and rotates in air,

51
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,625
and throws it on ground
to blow it up. That hero!

52
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,458
She guessed it right sir.

53
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:19,458
My wife is mad about you sir.
Say hello to her.

54
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,958
Did you hear that?

55
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,250
He's busy now.
I'll take a photo with him later.

56
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,625
That's mine!

57
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,500
Do you still read such books?
I used to read in my teens.

58
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,250
Why do girls always read only
English novels while travelling?

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We'll be travelling together for
3 hours, so just a friendly inquiry.

60
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,875
I would speak the same even if
an old lady was sitting in your place.

61
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,750
Are you a software Engineer?

62
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,333
I feel like that watching
your attitude.

63
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:26,208
I think I've seen you before.
- May be seen me on TV.

64
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,375
I'm great Astrologer, Gemology genius,
Dr. Narayana Shastry. PhD.,

65
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,542
You appear in astrology
program every morning, right?

66
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,167
Yes, it's me.

67
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:46,542
What is your specialty?
- I'm en expert in horoscopes.

68
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:53,042
Face reading or Numerology,
when I predict, it really happens.

69
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,542
That's my specialty.

70
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,542
From Manmohan Singh to
Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

71
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:02,042
nobody does anything without
taking my advice, you know that?

72
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,042
You know hero Prabhaas?

73
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,417
His first two films flopped,
third film was a super hit,

74
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,750
how could it become a hit?

75
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:14,042
I advised him to add another
'A' in his name spelling.

76
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,042
That film too got an 'A' certificate.

77
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,250
Are you going to Delhi?

78
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,542
No, she'll get down in Nellore.

79
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,917
What are you looking at?
This is also a type of meditation.

80
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,417
Shooting?
Isn't the heroine coming with you?

81
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,542
Tamannah would be perfect with you.
That too for 3 years only.

82
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,542
After that she'll fit perfectly
for your mother's character.

83
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,917
Had you been to Bollywood,
it would've been great.

84
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,125
You would've given the stars
there a run for their money.

85
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,042
What happened?

86
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,042
He tried to become an hero.

87
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,792
He's right.

88
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,292
Bhai! Let's decide after landing.

89
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,792
What's he doing?

90
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:44,417
It has a hijack message code from
which the control tower can know it.

91
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,667
Give it to him.

92
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,292
You can buy another one.

93
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,542
He gave it right,
why are you beating him then?

94
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,417
No more questions!
Both are true.

95
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,917
Who are you?
- We don't need to tell you.

96
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,042
If you all co-operate,
we'll not harm you anyone.

97
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,792
If not, just a press of button
can blow up this plane.

98
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,417
Hijack shock to India,
terrorists strike terror again.

99
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,125
Starjet flight from Chennai
to Delhi has been hijacked.

100
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:34,417
It has landed in Tirupathi
with hijackers in full control.

101
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,292
But we've not yet received
any information of human loss.

102
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,625
Minister Suryasekhar is also
travelling in the hijacked flight.

103
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:45,792
Still yet to know if it happened
unexpectedly or planned earlier.

104
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:50,417
Hijack which has rocked Delhi,
yet to know who is behind it.

105
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:55,417
There's information of impending
spate of hijacking many more flights.

106
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,000
Hijackers have refused to
negotiate with airport authorities.

107
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:05,000
A team lead by NSA Krishnamurthy
has reached Tirupathi airport.

108
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,167
Who are the hijackers, sir?

109
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,500
Who are the hijackers, sir?
What are their demands?

110
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,167
They wanted me to take the flight
to Rawalpindi in Pakistan.

111
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,292
What could be their demands?

112
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,875
US President is coming to India
next month, may be to stop that visit.

113
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,667
Is the kidnapped Minister safe?

114
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,375
Don't you know the difference
between hijack and kidnap?

115
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:54,417
Minister isn't kidnapped,
the flight has been hijacked.

116
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,167
They've good knowledge
in aeronautics too.

117
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,375
Let's talk about it later not now.

118
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,708
Is the Government ready to fulfill
any demand from the hijackers?

119
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,208
It depends on their demands.

120
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,708
Prime Minister said last month about
not giving in to terrorist's demands.

121
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,208
Can't you ask responsible questions?
Don't you've any responsibility?

122
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,500
We've an advantage,
the flight is still in India.

123
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,625
That's a good chance for our people.
- Why?

124
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,583
Why haven't the NSG commandos
arrived yet?

125
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,750
I'll come back to you later.

126
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,875
Don't worry unnecessarily dear,
nothing will happen to us.

127
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,583
We're in the abode
of Lord Venkateshwara.

128
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,375
No aunty, I came without
informing my husband.- Why?

129
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,875
We're having differences,
we're at loggerheads.

130
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,375
I thought a split would be better.

131
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,083
If I tell him, he'll not
accept it, that's why...

132
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,250
That's why I left a message
for him and walked out.

133
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
Now I feel guilty.

134
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,458
What's your name?

135
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,458
Where are you from?
- From Pakistan.

136
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,625
We came to Chennai for
her heart operation.

137
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,750
She was under treatment
for 3 months here.

138
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,250
With the grace of Allah,
she's fine now.

139
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,250
We're going back to our country.

140
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,750
From Delhi to Karachi.

141
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,625
Aren't you a Telugu man?
You can talk to me in Telugu.

142
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,250
Do you know to speak in Telugu?

143
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,125
I can speak in all the languages
seen on the currency note.

144
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,000
Look passengers...
- All are safe including the Minister.

145
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,000
How many of you are there?
- You may lose count of it.

146
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,333
I asked how many of you're
there in the flight.

147
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't waste time asking questions
which I won't answer.

148
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,500
Light up entire airport so that
we can see every inch of it.

149
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,333
Nobody must come near the flight
without my permission.

150
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,125
Anyone breaking this rule,
we'll blow up the flight.

151
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,000
What's your demand?

152
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,333
Yusuf Khan!

153
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,208
100 passengers.

154
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
Along with hero Chandrakanth.

155
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,875
Are you from Chennai?

156
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,708
Look, we're in a hijacked flight,

157
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,000
we don't know if we can
go out alive from here,

158
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,708
so it's better let's all
stick together. Got it?

159
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,250
Should've finished that bastard.

160
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,750
Feeding him with three square meals
and looking after him carefully, why?

161
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,083
To hand him over to them safely.
Are we caretakers?

162
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,750
It seems they created trouble
for not serving them biryani.

163
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,750
The fun part is that a film was
released last month on it,

164
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,375
by hero Chandrakanth who is now
in the hijacked flight,

165
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,375
actually he arrests Yusuf Khan
in the film.- Is it?

166
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,875
You know how? Taking great risk.

167
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,583
Yusuf Khan is escaping
in a helicopter.

168
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,083
Our hero leaps from a tall building
roof into the helicopter and...

169
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,875
What's all this nonsense?

170
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,750
Ask me what happened after that.

171
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,250
What else? He would've got hurt.

172
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,958
He didn't but it hurt the
film's collections.

173
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,750
But one thing is good,
the man who acted as Yusuf Khan,

174
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,750
he's spitting image of Yusuf Khan.

175
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,750
You're planning something, right?

176
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,958
I know it.

177
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,625
Just five people,
they're nothing to you.

178
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,958
You're waiting for
the opportune moment.

179
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,250
They don't know that you're
a gentleman in appearance only,

180
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,958
but a Spiderman if you fly!

181
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,500
What is your name?

182
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I don't have any name.
I'm just a soldier of Allah.

183
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,125
I'm hungry-

184
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,333
Please wait for some more time.
We'll arrange something.

185
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,625
Why are you doing this?

186
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,000
This is holy war.
- You mean?

187
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,500
Why are you scaring all these people?

188
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,000
It's an order from Allah.

189
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,833
Will Allah scare everyone
including me?

190
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,833
You're a gift of Allah.

191
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,500
All these people are our enemies.

192
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:12,500
But these people treated me back
to health and took great care of me.

193
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,875
All doctors are good.

194
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,208
How nice it would be
if you were also a doctor!

195
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,875
The time now is 6 pm, nobody has
eaten anything since morning.

196
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Nothing will happen if you
don't eat for a day, Captain.

197
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,708
It may affect us
but there are kids...

198
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,000
If anything happens to the passengers,
it'll be a problem to you only.

199
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,375
We know, what to do and when.

200
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,375
Those are church bells,
there's a church near by.

201
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,750
A small request.

202
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,875
This is lent season for us,
very important days,

203
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:13,583
if you permit me,
I'll pray reading Bible. - No way.

204
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,583
At least give me a Quran if you've,
I'll read it.

205
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,583
All religions are same.

206
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,458
We'll also listen,
read it aloud, Father.

207
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,250
Jehovah is my protector...

208
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,458
Terrorists have demanded
the release of Yusuf Khan.

209
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,125
Where is Yusuf Khan now?

210
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,250
What's the past of world's most
wanted terrorist Yusuf Khan?

211
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Watch tonight at <i>8</i> pm in a special
bulletin the dark past of Yusuf Khan.

212
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,500
Should we've to meet every time
in crisis only? - Can't avoid it, right?

213
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,333
<i>We're meeting after 28! 11 Mumbai masts.</i>

214
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,250
Food packets are being delivered now.

215
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,000
They want 100 crores in cash
and bring Yusuf Khan here.

216
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:00,083
They'll shift the passengers
into that flight.

217
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,375
What about this flight?
- We've promised to get it repaired.

218
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,708
They refused.

219
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,208
We're supplying power.

220
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,000
They're threatening to
blow up the flight.

221
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,875
How could so many weapons
get into the flight?

222
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,208
Anyone of them could've joined
hands with hijackers.

223
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,208
They would've taken the
weapons into the flight.

224
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,208
Yes, tomorrow evening 5 pm.

225
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,208
Midnight attack is right.

226
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,750
I was tensed seeing you silent,

227
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:47,083
then I remembered the punch dialogue
delivered by you sir,

228
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,375
it's then I understood the
reason for your silence.

229
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,625
What dialogue?

230
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,875
My vision may be silent,
if I react it's very violent.

231
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:06,083
When I think of their plight,
I'm worried about them sir.

232
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,083
What would our government do now?

233
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,375
It depends on their demands.

234
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,583
They'll ask an assurance
of passengers' safety.

235
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,458
Then they'll ask them to release
at least women and children.

236
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,625
Can't they do it first?

237
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,958
Why? You want to escape first?

238
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,958
They'll not agree to release anyone.

239
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:37,250
They know that people outside would
know details from released passengers.

240
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:42,250
Even now they'll eat only after
an hour once we finish eating.- Why?

241
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,250
What if the food is drugged?

242
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,125
We've checked the entire video
of Chennai airport security camera.

243
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,750
But didn't find any clue.

244
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,500
Have you checked the addresses
of all the passengers?

245
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,333
Two addresses are fake till now.

246
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,833
Can't they plan some
commando operation?

247
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,833
We can see that only in English films.

248
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
TV media says they've planned to
hijack ten flights simultaneously.

249
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,625
It's nothing but sensationalism, sir.

250
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,625
We can't ignore it.

251
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,125
Don't know...if this problem is solved,

252
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:28,125
I've made a vow to walk to
His abode and tonsure my head.

253
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,125
What's the bomb they're carrying,
it's very different.

254
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
This is not the bomb you see in films,

255
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,708
we can blow up this flight
with 250 grams of it.

256
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
How much they could be
carrying now, sir?

257
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,875
Though Yusuf Khan was born in Kashmir,

258
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,875
information says he went with his
family as kid to settle in Afghanistan.

259
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,375
The world came to know about this
dreaded terrorist after London bomb blasts.

260
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:15,000
After that...- The world is waiting
eagerly for the decision of Indian Govt.

261
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:25,875
Enough of it!

262
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,875
All of you sleep without talking.

263
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,375
Please don't forget to wake me up.

264
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,083
Why should I wake you up?

265
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,375
I got it sir.

266
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,750
Heroes always do it solo and
kill everyone single handedly.

267
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,083
Have you runaway from home?

268
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,375
You said sorry to dad
feeling sad now, right?

269
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,625
Are you eavesdropping?

270
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:05,875
You're shouting near my ear
and say I'm eavesdropping.

271
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,625
What's the problem in home
that has forced you to runaway?

272
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,625
My cousin is getting
married in Delhi.

273
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,250
Dad told me to wait for few days,
let's go together.

274
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,750
I didn't listen to him and
left home stubbornly.

275
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,625
Poor dad, he would've come to Tirupathi
watching the news on TV.

276
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,625
How many problems he had
to face because of me?

277
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:32,125
Anyway why am I telling you all this?

278
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,250
I expected a love story
but daddy sentiment.

279
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,125
Aren't you scared?

280
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,333
I do... do you snore?

281
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,125
You do, right?

282
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,000
Didn't you do anything last night, sir?

283
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,333
Oh no! I didn't do anything.

284
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,333
Without anything, media has written
about an affair with actress Kalashri.

285
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,000
What's this sir?

286
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm asking about saving us and
you're blabbering something else.

287
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:28,125
What can I do man?
- Why not sir? You're a hero!

288
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,333
Can't you bash up just 5 men?

289
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,875
Do you've any sense?
They're terrorists!

290
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,375
So what sir?
You caught Yusuf Khan, right?

291
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I beg you, please don't say it loudly.

292
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,500
If they overhear you,
they may think it's true.

293
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,875
Isn't it true then sir?

294
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,375
You silly man!

295
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,875
That's movie!

296
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,875
What about jumping from
roof top to catch him?

297
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,875
That isn't me, it was my dupe.

298
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,750
Then he's the original
and you're a dupe.

299
00:30:56,708 --> 00:31:00,000
What we do in films
we can't do it in real life.

300
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,708
But what about love which you do
more in real life than in films.

301
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:07,875
What have I done to you man?
Do you understand the situation here?

302
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,458
They are terrorists.
Nobody can bash them up.

303
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,375
Agreed you can't beat them,

304
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:20,083
you changed the hearts of terrorists
in a film by talking to them, right?

305
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,583
Why not try that here?

306
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:26,583
They were junior artistes,
not real terrorists.

307
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,083
They'll listen to me.

308
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:32,083
If I talk to them,
they'll kill me and hack me.

309
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,583
That's also a big lie!

310
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,250
Can't you do anything?

311
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,000
Waste fellow!

312
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,833
That is...
- Shut your gob!

313
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,375
Discussion is going on.
- Still?

314
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,375
Are you discussing munching
cashews and savouries?

315
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:56,250
How important is Yusuf to you,
passengers safety is to us.

316
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,625
But we do have rules
and regulations.

317
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,125
We need to consider people, opposition,
media before taking a decision.

318
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,625
Prime Minister has just
returned from Germany.

319
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,750
So, Cabinet meeting is going on,

320
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:13,458
let it get over, till then, please release
women and children from the flight.

321
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,750
People would trust you.

322
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,750
We're not bothered about
trust of your people.

323
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,458
Are we going to fight elections here?

324
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,750
We'll not release anyone
till our demands are met.

325
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,958
If you don't release Yusuf Khan
before 5 pm today,

326
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:28,750
our guns will talk,
Minister may be the first victim.

327
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,625
He knows what we are eating here.

328
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,500
A small request.

329
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Unable to enter the toilet.
It's stinking.

330
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,833
Can you please get it cleaned?

331
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What if passengers get sick?

332
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:02,000
Let them first think about our demands,
we'll think about you then.

333
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,000
Why are you talking like a mad man?

334
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,125
Am I asking you to send me out?

335
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,000
What's the link between your
demand and cleaning the toilet?

336
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,125
You're talking too much,
go to your seat.

337
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,333
We know what to do and when to do.

338
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Can we at least know your demands?

339
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,708
If your govt. releases our Yusuf Khan,
we'll free you.

340
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,875
We've demanded them to free
Yusuf Khan by 5 pm today.

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What if they don't?

342
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,500
Cleaning the toilet may
not be necessary.

343
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,083
Who is this Yusuf Khan?

344
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,708
Though 24 hours have passed
since the flight was hijacked,

345
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:43,208
but the deadline set by terrorists
will end today at 5 pm.

346
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,000
Discussion at the highest level
is still going on.

347
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:51,000
Friends and relatives of the
passengers have reached Tirupathi airport.

348
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,708
Still thinking about what
to negotiate with terrorists?

349
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,000
Why do we need all this
science and technology then?

350
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,708
What do you want us to do?

351
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,083
The govt. trains us for
such operations only.

352
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,917
But the same govt. which trained you
wants you to wait.

353
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,250
What can we do for it?

354
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,417
How is my son Subhash in flight?
I don't know anything.

355
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,250
If anything happens to the
passengers in the flight,

356
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,542
this govt. must take
the responsibility.

357
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,750
He's saying something,
let's hear him.

358
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:27,542
Along with food packets
our commandos too would go,

359
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,042
as soon as air hostess
opens the door...

360
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,542
How? There are over 100 passengers inside.
One of them is a Central Minister.

361
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,042
My wife is in that flight.

362
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,917
Earlier six terrorists were releases
to free a Minister's daughter.

363
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:45,417
Now there are 100 passengers inside,
can't they release one terrorist?

364
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:50,292
You said it very easily,
but we've to answer to the people.

365
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,417
Tell them sir, it's better than
bowing before the terrorists.

366
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:57,417
Do you know what would happen
if it was in Israel or America?

367
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,292
They would've stormed the flight
and finished by now.

368
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:02,125
We're different from them.
- That's what I'm also saying.

369
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,917
Do you know how many died
to send him to jail?

370
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,125
If he comes out now,
he'll kill thousands.

371
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:11,292
Our leader Central Minister Suryasekhar
in the hijacked flight,

372
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:16,917
if anything happens to him
the consequences will be dreadful.

373
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,917
Elections are just 3 months away,

374
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,292
if they blow up the flight,
how can we face the electorate.

375
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:28,167
Not only that Minister's supporters have
announced state wide picketing tomorrow.

376
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:36,542
He knows nuclear science.

377
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,667
Countries around the world dread
if he comes out.

378
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:44,500
You're worried about elections,
pickets and answering to people.

379
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:56,292
We are not the deciding authority.
We just follow orders from higher authority.

380
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,792
We win always fighting the terrorists,

381
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,542
but we always lose to
your indecisiveness.

382
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:17,542
Have cashew nuts.

383
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,917
We need a helper,
there's lot of work in home.

384
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,917
Greetings.
- Greetings.

385
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:59,250
I'm from census dept.
What's your name?

386
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,250
How many elders?
- Two.

387
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,042
Greetings.
- Greetings.

388
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,542
I'm from census dept.
- What's your name?

389
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,917
Your age?

390
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,417
Who is that?
- From census dept.

391
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:17,042
Are you married?
- We're all bachelors.

392
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,750
What's the name of the house owner?
- There's no owner here.

393
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:28,667
Why did you come again?

394
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,917
Help!

395
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,542
Release Yusuf Khan
otherwise I'll kill her.- Stop!

396
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,917
I'll kill her. Free Yusuf Khan.
- Help!

397
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,625
Drop the guns down.

398
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:29,792
Free Yusuf Khan!
- Help!

399
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:22,292
Demands from one side and
pressure from other side.

400
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,000
Isn't there any end to it?

401
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,167
I don't know what to do.

402
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:33,667
Relatives of passengers are
picketing near PM's house.

403
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,167
Minister's supporters are
going on rampage here.

404
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:37,792
Terrorists are threatening
to kill the Minister.

405
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,292
Minister will not be harmed.

406
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,375
If they kill the Minister,
they know we'll enter the flight.

407
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,375
But our people are not ready
to take that risk.

408
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,667
Cabinet meeting is still going on.

409
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,875
Our people are bothered about
elections not the country.

410
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,042
My blood is boiling sir.

411
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,875
I lost my colleague in
catching Yusuf Khan.

412
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:01,667
How many more lives will
get sacrificed?

413
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:03,667
Isn't there any value to their lives?

414
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,042
Will you release Yusuf Khan?

415
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,500
It's not in our hands.

416
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:23,625
Did you see? If you go against us,
you'll die like him.

417
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:29,917
Sit down!

418
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:37,417
Your deadline ends at 5 pm only, right?
Why did you kill him then?

419
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,125
We are following the TV news,
discussion is still going on.

420
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:43,417
We're not responsible
for media speculation.

421
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,792
You're not giving any responsible reply,
we too can't go on discuss.

422
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,792
That's why I shot a man
who tried to escape.

423
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:51,000
This is just a sample.

424
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,500
If the response isn't
positive by evening,

425
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,375
the next body will be the Minister's.

426
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,792
Editor is going hammer
and tongs on phone.

427
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,792
Why? We are reporting fine, right?

428
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,500
What are you reporting? We are showing
what everyone else is showing.

429
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,292
Our TRP will rise only if we
something exclusive, right?

430
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:10,292
It'll be sensational if you manage
to get footage of the hijacked flight.

431
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
How can I sir? Too much of police,
can't even enter the airport.

432
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:14,667
Can't you see it?

433
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:18,000
Do something,
they've filmed in Rajbhavan too.

434
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,167
His name is Aslam,

435
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,542
he cleans the flight toilets in Chennai
before it leaves the airport.

436
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:33,667
But he's missing now.

437
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:51,167
Who is Yusuf Khan
- He's our leader.

438
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,875
Is he a terrorist?

439
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:55,667
No, our enemies say like that.

440
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,542
But he has killed many people, right?

441
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:05,167
No, he didn't kill.
Their sins killed them.

442
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,542
But many small children like me
also got killed, right?

443
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,042
It happens sometimes like
that in holy war.

444
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,917
You're a terrorist,
will you kill me too?

445
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:19,417
No.

446
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:30,917
Aslam is traced in Red Hills,
Tamil Nadu police are after him.

447
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,542
Let's also go.

448
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,417
If we catch and interrogate him,
I'm sure we'll get a lead.

449
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,417
Till then continue your negotiations
with the terrorists.

450
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:43,750
How far is Red Hills?

451
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:11,792
Where is he?
- In a bar, sir.

452
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,667
Do you've a match box?

453
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
When did you tonsure your head?

454
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,875
Don't come near, I'll jump down.

455
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,875
Don't act mad!

456
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:36,792
Don't come.

457
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,042
If you come near, I'll jump.

458
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,042
Don't come near me, I'll jump.

459
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,167
Why is he calling me Ganesh?
- Please listen to me.

460
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:52,042
We know you're not connected
with the theft of jewels.

461
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,375
Your brother has told the truth.

462
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,542
No case has been registered on you.

463
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,250
We just want an information only.
Just tell, where's Raju? We'll leave you.

464
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,917
Don't die unnecessarily.

465
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,042
Think about your wife and children.

466
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:12,042
You haven't done anything wrong,
why are you scared then?

467
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,417
Don't come near me, I'll jump down.

468
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:16,542
I'm telling you, won't you believe me?

469
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,542
I told you not to fire at him, right?

470
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,250
Go back.

471
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,542
I don't have time to talk to you.

472
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,625
Just answer my questions,
it'll help you.

473
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,625
If not you'll hit the headlines
of tomorrow's newspapers.

474
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:44,667
Along with your photo.

475
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,625
That you've become approver of police.

476
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,792
Do you know what will happen then?

477
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:54,917
They may spare enemies but
never one who betrays them.

478
00:48:55,125 --> 00:49:00,625
Not only you, your father, mother,
sister, they'll not spare anyone.

479
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:04,792
Tell me the truth,
I'll ensure your safety.

480
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,292
How many are in that flight?

481
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,792
I don't know sir.
I saw two people, sir.

482
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,292
How long you know them?
- For the past 6 months.

483
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,917
I met them in Mosque.

484
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,417
They said many things and
showed me many videos.

485
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,042
What did you take into the flight?
- I placed a parcel inside.

486
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,792
I don't know what was in that parcel.

487
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,167
Why would he answer
if you ask like this?

488
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,167
Don't you know you'll get
caught by police?

489
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,792
I believed them sir.

490
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
They told me to go
underground for few days.

491
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:37,667
They gave me Rs.2 lakhs and
promised me job in Dubai.

492
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:41,750
For the past 3 days I didn't know
where to go, and went hiding,

493
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,667
they gave me a phone number,

494
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:47,167
I came out to make a call
to that number.

495
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:50,042
But no such phone number
is existing, sir.

496
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:53,792
What's the size of the parcel?
- About this size.

497
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,542
Parcel may not have machine guns but
it can have pistols and hand grenades.

498
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,667
May be it had plastic explosives.
- I'm sure it had.

499
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:16,375
Don't let the officers know this,
the may get worried.

500
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,042
Is he saying the truth?

501
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:20,875
He's not smart enough to lie.

502
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:33,167
We discussed...
- With whom?

503
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,167
With Home Minister and
Prime Minister...

504
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:41,042
They suggested to discuss and...

505
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,542
That is...please tell him sir.

506
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:51,042
High command feels commando
action is risky.

507
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,625
We shouldn't attack them, Ravi.

508
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,750
They're threatening to blow
the flight if we launch attack.

509
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,750
Is your discussion any useful?

510
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:03,792
We can't take such a big risk,
we're facing elections in 3 months,

511
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:09,542
if anything happens,
it'll damage country's image.

512
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,250
I don't get one thing sir, won't the
release of Yusuf Khan damage the image?

513
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:52,125
Cockroach!

514
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,167
Govt. has decided to release Yusuf Khan
to save the passengers.

515
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:22,000
Is it right to release Yusuf Khan
who has killed many thousands?

516
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,667
Till now you said Govt.
hasn't done anything,

517
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:26,167
now when it is releasing him,
you ask why?

518
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:29,167
Don't sensationalize issues
for your TRP ratings?

519
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:38,000
They've promised to bring
Yusuf Khan here by tonight.

520
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:41,500
After that we'll free all of
you as early as possible.

521
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,500
Congratulations brother!

522
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:51,375
What has happened now
to clap and feel happy?

523
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:53,375
In the excitement of going home
after he's released...

524
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:55,167
This is not a matter to
get excited about.

525
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:59,042
Do you know how many people
Yusuf Khan has killed?

526
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:02,375
Our govt. is releasing such
a dreaded criminal for our sake.

527
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:08,167
I don't mind if you don't feel sad,
but please don't feel happy.

528
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:19,542
Can you get the toilets
cleaned at least now?

529
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:29,750
Understand now, what if I had
done something listening to you?

530
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,250
There are situations and
circumstances to show heroics...

531
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,167
If anything happens to my mother,
I'll send an ambulance,

532
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:43,917
if anything happens to my motherland,
I'll come myself.

533
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,667
This is also one of your punch dialogue.

534
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,042
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

535
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,042
What's your name?

536
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:04,542
You enter the flight and clean
the toilets as you do usually.

537
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:11,125
Just check how many terrorists are there
and the weapons they're carrying.

538
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:13,417
You've to observe this
while cleaning the toilets.

539
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,417
They mustn't get any doubt.
- Okay sir.

540
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,792
Anyway they've decided to release him,
why this surveillance now?

541
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:26,667
Let them do as they wish,
but we must also be ready, right?

542
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,792
Couldn't get a prisoner safely?

543
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:09,500
If press know this,
they'll haul and maul us.

544
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,500
Have you thought about what next, sir?

545
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:14,500
Does the press know about this?

546
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,792
Not yet but how long can we keep it secret?
- We must keep it a secret.

547
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,042
What if they find it out?

548
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:32,667
We've only one option to attack
before they know it and save passengers.

549
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,875
But how? Commando operation
is possible at night only.

550
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,667
Their deadline ends by evening 5 pm.

551
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,542
What am I to tell them?
- Tell them something,

552
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,375
tell them there's a little delay
in bringing Yusuf Khan here.

553
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:43,375
What if they don't agree?
- Make them agree.

554
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:45,875
Tell them there's rain
or some storm hit them.

555
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,542
Tell the same thing to press also.

556
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,667
I don't think it's practically possible.

557
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,125
What?

558
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:09,750
We received information just now.

559
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:12,042
We want Yusuf Khan only
not any information.

560
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,792
Not like that, please listen to me.

561
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:17,625
It's snowing heavily there,
very difficult for helicopter to go there.

562
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,917
They've travel by road
for some distance.

563
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,417
It'll be night before Yusuf Khan
reaches this place.

564
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:24,042
You're lying!

565
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,167
I don't have any need to lie to you.

566
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:28,917
I don't think you've taken us seriously.

567
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,917
Look, we're helpless
if you threaten us.

568
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,250
You've waited till now,
just few more hours only.

569
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,250
We'll wait.
But we've a limit.

570
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:45,417
If you fail to produce Yusuf Khan by night,
you will be responsible...

571
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:50,792
If you try any commando operation,
we'll not keep quiet.

572
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:08,625
He's entertaining us even
in this serious situation.

573
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:20,625
Your govt. isn't worried about you.

574
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:24,417
They're not here to save you but
for Tirupathi temple offering.

575
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,000
Yusuf Khan is getting released, right?
What else you want?

576
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:29,500
Yusuf Khan should've been here by now,

577
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:32,792
but they're acting with tactics
like snowing and rain.

578
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,500
Didn't you cheat us coming like
passengers and hijacked all of us?

579
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:39,500
Isn't that cheating?

580
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:43,667
This is not for you,
we are waging a war. Holy war!

581
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:45,500
Why are you waging war
in the name of Allah?

582
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:46,792
What's so holy in war?

583
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
There is, that's why all women
are still safe here.

584
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:01,792
No use in going to America or London
after studying computers.

585
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,792
Go to Kashmir and see, you'll know
what your country has done.

586
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,542
You too go to Bombay,
Coimbatore, Hyderabad

587
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,042
and see women who have lost their
husbands for terrorist attacks,

588
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,042
and you can see orphans
and mass graves.

589
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,042
Enough!

590
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:21,042
If Yusuf Khan doesn't reach here by
tonight, I'll one every 30 minutes.

591
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,625
Who will he start with?

592
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,375
If he starts with children,
you'll be the last man.

593
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,167
If he starts with seniors,
you'll be the first man.

594
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:57,917
Sit down!

595
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:27,250
Even if you're doctor,
why did you treat him?

596
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:28,917
That's my responsibility.

597
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:31,292
But he's a terrorist.
- But I'm not a terrorist, right?

598
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:35,125
As a doctor what he did is right.
You sit down silently sir.

599
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,917
Are you really a doctor?
- Why?

600
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,792
You don't appear like a doctor.

601
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,417
Do you want me to be with
a stethoscope always like in films?

602
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:51,417
I believe what you say.

603
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:07,125
Relatives of the passengers
are creating a problem.

604
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:08,625
Very difficult to deal
with them, sir.

605
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:12,292
I feel it'll be better
if higher officials talk to them.

606
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:31,167
At times I feel they are
right in their argument.

607
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:36,000
You mean?
- It means...

608
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:40,375
Think if I kidnap you for 10 days,

609
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,292
after 4 or 5 days,
you'll identify yourself with me,

610
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,000
you'll start liking me,

611
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:50,000
if anyone comes to save you,
you'll see them as your enemy.

612
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:53,000
This psychology is known
as Stockholm syndrome.

613
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,042
I'll never like you even if I stay
with you for 10 years.

614
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,792
Thank God, I'm saved.

615
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:04,667
A small request.

616
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:09,875
There are many old people here,
legs are paining sitting in one place,

617
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:12,167
if you permit,
we'll stand there for sometime.

618
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:14,875
But only two people at a time.

619
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,042
Come.

620
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:24,542
I've seen you somewhere.
- Don't you know him?

621
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:31,667
He's blabbering without knowledge.
You don't worry, carry on sir.

622
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:32,667
Go sir.

623
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,750
If you blabber again, I'll kill...

624
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:40,417
Will you beat me? Will you beat me to
prove yourself as action star?

625
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:43,917
My wife beats me, do you know my 4
years old son too beats me?

626
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:45,750
Will you beat me?

627
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:26,625
What does he know?

628
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,625
Leave it sir.

629
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,917
He's a military man,
he'll talk like that only.

630
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:39,917
We thought Yusuf Khan will come and
everything will go as we expected,

631
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,625
but should he meet with
an accident on the way?

632
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,125
I didn't listen to my father's advice,

633
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:48,625
I stubbornly joined IAS,

634
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:52,417
he told me I can never go
the toilet also peacefully.

635
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:13,500
I've captured flight footage in camera.

636
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,500
I'll send it immediately.

637
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,500
I've to be here for some more time.

638
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:22,292
I've got sensational news.

639
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:27,000
Our channel which brings news
as it happens to the viewers,

640
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,000
we bring to light truth
without any fear.

641
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:32,500
This exclusive bulletin is
one such sensational news.

642
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:40,542
This is the Starjet flight that
was hijacked three days ago.

643
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:49,167
We've news that the vehicle bringing
Yusuf Khan has met with an accident.

644
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:59,667
Some reporter has managed to give
a slip to security and entered the airport.

645
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,667
Before he comes to know everything.

646
01:07:08,542 --> 01:07:09,375
One minute,

647
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,542
can I see that gun?

648
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:17,875
It's my childhood wish to hold a gun.

649
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:43,417
We've news that the vehicle bringing
Yusuf Khan has met with an accident.

650
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,417
What's happening?

651
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:49,917
Will you tell me or not?

652
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:52,042
A small problem...

653
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,042
A small accident on the way...

654
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,417
He's fine.

655
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:02,042
Doctors are checking him.

656
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,917
Is it a joke?

657
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:07,917
Please answer my question.

658
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,625
You too have a family like us, right?
are you right in doing this?

659
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,750
Oh he has killed him unjustly!

660
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:24,958
What was his mistake?
- Why did you kill him unjustly?

661
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:28,625
We are not here to judge anything,
Yusuf Khan must come here,

662
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,125
anything can happen till then.

663
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,125
If you've courage fight face to face,

664
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,625
you all are cowards!

665
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,125
I'm not a man to get scared with guns.

666
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,500
I would've died in Kargil war.

667
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:52,333
Angels, please help him!

668
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,333
Angels, please appear before him.

669
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:01,000
Christ, who has called you,
may you be with him.

670
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:06,833
May angels take you to the Lord!

671
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:29,375
May the soul who died today
reach your holy feet, amen.

672
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,875
Are you happy now?
A man lost his life because of you.

673
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:08,583
Something like this could've happened
even if you'd attacked them.

674
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,375
It would've some meaning.

675
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,750
Now, it's complicated.

676
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:21,250
Taking time to decide and
then taking wrong decision.

677
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,000
What else can I do?
You can understand only this language.

678
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,250
We had promised to release
Yusuf Khan, right? What else you want?

679
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,375
If you behave as you wish,
it's not good for you.

680
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,583
Don't waste time thinking
about what's good for us.

681
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,500
Think about the safety of
your people's lives.

682
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,875
We'll throw a body every 30 minutes
till Yusuf Khan is here. Got it?

683
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,750
Are you threatening me?

684
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:51,125
I'm warning you, if you kill
any one passenger from now,

685
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,250
you will not get even
the body of Yusuf Khan.

686
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,250
We can bring Yusuf Khan only after
the doctors give the clearance.

687
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:57,958
Do what so ever you can do!

688
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,958
Why are you getting tensed?
What if he kills another passenger...

689
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,625
I'll shout like this only.

690
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,458
If not you take charge.

691
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,958
Face PM and press,
and discuss with them.

692
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,750
I've killed my son.

693
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,958
My son...

694
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:29,625
Leave me...leave me please...
My son...

695
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,625
Terrorists have challenged the govt.

696
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:40,000
They've killed a passenger Subhash
brutally and threw his body out.

697
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,333
Answer the call.

698
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,375
Same anger, talk to them
in the same tone. Go.

699
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,375
What?

700
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,125
You must believe me.

701
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,000
It'll take 10 hours.

702
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,375
What did he say?

703
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,375
He wants proof that Yusuf Khan is alive.

704
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:26,375
He wants to see him on TV.

705
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:33,000
Meanwhile other terrorists groups have
welcomed the release of Yusuf Khan.

706
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,708
Do something.

707
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:40,875
How?

708
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:43,708
We must attack them
when they least expect.

709
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:46,375
We don't have it now.

710
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,708
Even if they get any
suspicion of attack...

711
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,875
No more food packets too till
we provide the proof.

712
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,583
This is not the time to discuss
who is right and who is wrong.

713
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,250
What was that film's name?
- Which film?

714
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,750
The film in which you told me
Chandrakanth catches Yusuf Khan.

715
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,250
Kashmir is our dream.

716
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:56,625
Anyone who is against this
is enemy of Islam.

717
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:01,625
It's not sin to kill such an enemy.
It's responsibility, holy war!

718
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,250
Holy war!

719
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,500
You're gouging out eyes for dreams.

720
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,375
My motherland is more important
than my life.

721
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:16,833
Don't Muslims read Hindu paper,
aren't Hindus eating Mughal biryani?

722
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:23,625
Our victory to India is more
powerful than your holy war cry!

723
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,125
He's a spitting image of Yusuf Khan.

724
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:34,833
I want this actor, film's director,
cameraman, make-up man here.

725
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:38,333
We had intercepted Yusuf Khan's
phone calls, right?- Yes.

726
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,708
You've entered the airport
without permission,

727
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:17,250
that too in a police uniform,

728
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,458
that's why I'm quite,
if not you would feel the heat.

729
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:28,208
A passenger died because of you,
you know that?

730
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,875
Safety of passengers is your duty,
you failed in your duty,

731
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,708
taking the truth to people is my duty,
I'm did it perfectly.

732
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
Is it for people or TRP rating?

733
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:43,875
Vietnam war ended because
of a journalist's photo.

734
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:48,583
Princess Diana was killed
by one of your folks.

735
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,875
What sort of man you are?

736
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:52,875
Will you do anything for sensation?

737
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,125
Don't you've responsibility
in safe guarding the country?

738
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,083
Won't you help the govt.
In such situations?

739
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:01,250
We are not govt. servants.
Media is always opposition.

740
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,750
It's not out job to work for the govt.

741
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,750
I'm not saying for govt.
but work for the country.

742
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:09,750
It's not journalism to peep
into bathrooms and bedrooms.

743
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:12,750
I don't want your advises,
it's better for you to send me out.

744
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:13,875
If not...

745
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,375
What will you do man?
Will you complain on me?

746
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:20,375
Will you file a case on
for stifling press freedom?

747
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,958
But you can't go out from here.
- I must go...

748
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,458
If you create any problem...

749
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,458
Even your body will not be found.

750
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:35,750
Arrest him.

751
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,250
My phone...

752
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,958
How could you find I'm not
a real police?

753
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,750
This red colour must be
on top, you fool!

754
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:09,000
A small request.

755
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:13,500
People here would've families.
And responsibilities too.

756
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,000
But I don't have anyone.

757
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:17,625
Except Jesus!

758
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,333
My only responsibility
is to serve God.

759
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,333
If you want to kill anyone,
please kill me.

760
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,000
Tell the dialogue once.

761
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,500
Hello elderly man! When are you
getting your daughter married?

762
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,500
We mustn't keep banana plant and
unmarried girl in home for long time.

763
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,000
Go to your position.
- Okay sir.

764
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,875
Get it ready man!
Watching fun around. Do it fast.

765
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,583
Unmarried girl...banana plant...

766
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,375
Go fast!
- Okay sir.

767
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,958
Nasty people come to act.

768
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:31,250
What's this man?
See where did he go way?

769
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:32,750
Go and see where he is?

770
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,875
People come to take my life.

771
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,583
Where's the manager?

772
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,083
What did they tell you
before bringing here?

773
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,458
They said ad film shooting.

774
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:05,250
You?- Told me to come with make-up kit
to transform a man into Yusuf Khan.

775
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:06,583
That's okay,

776
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,375
I was waiting in bus stop,
they've brought me to Tirupathi,

777
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:10,958
snatched away my cell phone too.

778
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,625
I've a story discussion
with Mohan Babu.

779
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,250
Moreover I've a problem with my wife,
she's suspecting me unnecessarily.

780
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,750
That I've an affair with Parvathi.
- Who is Parvathi sir?

781
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:20,625
Why do you want to know?

782
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,125
She's a maid servant
in heroine's house.

783
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,458
What's your name?
- Ranganath.

784
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,750
From which place?
- Srisailam.

785
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,750
What have you done?
- B.A. Mystery...sorry History.

786
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:44,250
Do you know to speak Hindi?
- No sir.

787
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,958
Just delivered the dialogues by heart.
That's all.

788
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:49,625
I just did the role of Yusuf Khan Sir.
That's all.

789
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:53,625
I don't have any connection with him sir.
It was a lousy film, sir.

790
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:59,333
After the film's release
even kids are laughing at me sir.

791
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
I didn't want to be an actor, sir.

792
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,500
I wanted to become a police officer.

793
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:07,000
I was jobless, a friend who worked
as assistant director,

794
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:12,000
he said I'll look perfectly
like Yusuf Khan with make-up,

795
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,625
and took me to this fool...

796
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,833
took me to him sir,

797
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:22,125
he was my make-up man,
I don't know anything sir,

798
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,125
right now I'm doing a priest's role,

799
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:27,833
wearing dhoti, applied mark on forehead,
just only one dialogue,

800
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:36,708
banana plant and unmarried girl
in home, keep them or not for long...

801
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:40,208
I forgot the dialogue in tension, sir.
I don't know anything sir.

802
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:44,208
We'll not harm you,
just do as we tell you. Okay?

803
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,750
Turn him into Yusuf Khan.
- Okay sir.

804
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:53,125
You don't worry, you're doing
a great service to this nation.- Okay?

805
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,375
Are you the director?

806
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,500
That is...- Tell him that you're not
and I'm the director.

807
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,208
Yes sir, he's the director.

808
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:17,375
We'll put up a hospital set,

809
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:21,333
in that film a scene on Yusuf Khan
I mean Ranganath on bed, that's enough.

810
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:28,750
What's the concept, story and screenplay?
I must know it, right?

811
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,083
Can I know why you're
making us do this?

812
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,250
It's enough if you do
as you're told.

813
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,875
As a director I must know what to...

814
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:49,250
I must know what I'm doing.
- We can't tell you the details now.

815
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:53,250
You'll know after it's over.

816
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,750
Go man!

817
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:21,958
Child!

818
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,125
Don't talk to me.

819
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:29,375
Go away...mummy, tell him
to go away. I'm scared.

820
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,000
Dear!
- What happened?

821
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:41,333
Dear!

822
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:16,125
For God sake please go away,
she's scared of you.

823
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:17,500
Please go away.

824
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,833
Dean"

825
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,000
Tears are our foremost enemy.

826
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,000
Second is sentiment.

827
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,375
We've to move towards Holy war
after killing them. Got it?

828
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,375
This is holy war, a command from God.

829
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,375
This is holy war, a command from God.

830
01:23:58,375 --> 01:23:59,375
Greetings sir.

831
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:24,250
Will this work out, Ravi?
- May work out, just a hope,

832
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:29,250
many world leaders had
doubles for security,

833
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:31,458
Saddam Hussein too had body doubles,

834
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,875
it's been two years since the
world has seen Yusuf Khan, 835.

835
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:42,125
Not only that we've no other choice.

836
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:48,250
Yusuf Khan will be lying on bed
holding today's newspaper,- Why?

837
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,625
We must have proof that it
has happened today only.

838
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,125
What happened today?

839
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:57,458
Shoot the news paper for long time
and then show Yusuf Khan.

840
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,458
Where is the creativity, sir?
Why a news paper?

841
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,250
Show a lion or tiger
and pan to Yusuf...

842
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:08,125
I've stopped it.

843
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,958
He must look into the camera and say this
is holy war, a command from God. 844.

844
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:17,000
I didn't get what you said now.
How can people understand it?

845
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:23,625
I had called you here because
you've made a film on Yusuf Khan,

846
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,625
you would know in which
angle Yusuf will appear good,

847
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:29,125
the entire episode must appear
like a TV news report.

848
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,333
Yusuf Khan must look into
the camera angrily and...

849
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:34,000
Are you the director or me?

850
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:36,333
If you direct the entire scene,
why am I here then?

851
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
You may a commando
but I'm the director.

852
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:41,333
Leave the performance
part of it to me.

853
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,125
Listen to me...
- I got ruined listening to a man.- Who?

854
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:50,000
Just before climax prior
to the commando action,

855
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,000
he wanted an item song by Namitha,

856
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:54,125
I begged him not to insist for it,
he didn't listen to me,

857
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:58,000
he wanted it and what's the result?
We're finished!

858
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,000
If you're so knowledgeable,
how could Yusuf Khan speak in Telugu?

859
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:04,000
If you think so logically,
we can't make films in India.

860
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,625
Did you see film 'Roja'?
- I did.

861
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,375
Don't terrorists speak in Telugu?

862
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,000
Audience have accepted it.
It's okay if the do.

863
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,500
Till then we must make such films...
- Do what you've been asked to do.

864
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:21,375
You're taking a big risk.
He's very bad actor.

865
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:39,000
This is holy war, a command from God.

866
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:45,708
Our job is over,
we'll take leave now.

867
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,875
No, all three of you must be here only.

868
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,583
We too have work,
it's not fair to detain us.

869
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,083
But when will he be here?

870
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,375
He needs another scan, as soon as
doctors clear him, he'll be here.

871
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:08,875
He'll be here by tomorrow night.

872
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:15,250
This is the flight that
will bring Yusuf Khan.

873
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,750
On seeing Yusuf Khan,

874
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:21,875
terrorists will shift the passengers
from this flight to this flight,

875
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,125
we'll attack them
when they're passing midway,

876
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:32,000
Amongst so many passengers
and crew...

877
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,833
To succeed in this mission...

878
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,750
There's a retired Colonel
in the passengers list.

879
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,958
We've to send a cell phone
inside for that purpose.- How?

880
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:56,458
Oh no! I did it once!
I can't do it again sir.

881
01:27:56,625 --> 01:28:00,250
I'm terribly scared, sir.
Please leave me, I'll go back to Srisailam.

882
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:02,625
How could you dream of
becoming a police officer?

883
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:06,458
After watching films.
Police come in the last scene, right?

884
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:11,250
I thought its easy job.
But I got disqualified there too.- Why?

885
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,833
I faint quite often.

886
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:15,625
Yes sir.

887
01:28:15,833 --> 01:28:20,500
They asked me to go around the ground,
I fell unconscious unable to do.

888
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,500
When will this all happens?

889
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:26,500
When I'm tired or scared,
or if dogs chase me.

890
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,333
I think I'll faint now, sir.

891
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,333
You're police man, how can you cry?
- Police?

892
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,625
Who?
<i>'</i> Y0u!

893
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,125
You're a police officer from this moment.
- Really sir?

894
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:38,833
I'll get you an appointment
order immediately.

895
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:44,000
Concentrate on what I'm telling you.
- No sir, I'll resign.

896
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,500
Will you be a junior artiste
all your life?

897
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,125
Living for living sake
is not life at all.

898
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,833
If you listen to me,
I'll make you a hero in one day.

899
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,708
You'll never get such a chance again.

900
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,708
Everyone who laughed at you
in Srisailam will salute you.

901
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,500
I'll do as you order sir.

902
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:13,708
Today is my birthday.

903
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Is that why they're releasing
Yusuf Khan today?

904
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:22,875
Nothing, prisoners get released
on VIP's birthday, right?

905
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:42,875
Look, lives of hundred people
are in your hands. Got it?

906
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:46,875
I know sir, my father was
a police constable.

907
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:50,583
He died while on duty.
I'll do it correctly sir.

908
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:44,208
We're planning a rescue
operation tonight,

909
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,708
we need Col. Jagadish's help
who is in the flight,

910
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,208
food packets will be
delivered today morning,

911
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,375
one food packet will have
a red rubber band,

912
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:59,375
there will be a cell phone in it,
it must reach Col. Jagadish,

913
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,458
and please inform about this
to Colonel before itself,

914
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:32,250
Why did you take so long?
- I've a problem.

915
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:35,083
What's the problem?
- Little problem...

916
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,625
What's the problem?
What did you do for so long time inside?

917
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:10,125
If you faint again...

918
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:14,958
I'm dead scared sir.
I'm not used to this.

919
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:17,958
We've all our hopes on you.

920
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:22,958
Why are you crying like
a baby irresponsibly? Look at this!

921
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:31,125
Did you see? They were all
ordinary people like you.

922
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,458
People who came to buy
vegetables in market,

923
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,958
children who were going to school,

924
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,750
women who were visiting temple,
look at them carefully,

925
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,458
people who did this have
hijacked that flight,

926
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,000
if we leave them,

927
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:49,833
they'll plant bombs in the bus you go
or in train your father is travelling,

928
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,333
if your mother or sister was in that flight,
will you behave like this only?

929
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:55,833
Don't you get angry seeing this?

930
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,000
We've been fighting with them
for 4 days now,

931
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:06,125
you are our only hope now,

932
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:08,500
don't get scared,
we are with you.

933
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:16,833
Okay sir, I'll come trusting you.

934
01:34:58,708 --> 01:34:59,625
Remove your leg.

935
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,375
Remove your leg.

936
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:12,750
Doubt cleared?

937
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:14,125
We love 'Shining Star' Chandrakanth!

938
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:17,958
If he comes out safely, we'll get
our heads tonsured in temple.

939
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:24,458
But just a small fear.
- Scared of fainting?

940
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:25,958
You won't faint and
you mustn't faint.

941
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:27,625
Anyway what do you do
when you faint?

942
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,458
Last time a man placed an iron
rod in my hand, I recovered.

943
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:36,000
Then, we'll take you in a wheelchair,
hold the handle tightly.

944
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:38,833
The problem isn't that,
you're still Ranganath.

945
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
You must transform into Yusuf Khan.

946
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:42,625
You must show the same body
language as in that film.

947
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:48,333
I'm scared on seeing you sir.
Ask my director to say, I'll do it.

948
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:58,833
Was my film rotten?

949
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,500
Let this get over, I'll see your end.

950
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,625
If I see you anywhere near Filmnagar,
I'll squeeze you out.

951
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:08,625
I'll kill you.

952
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:16,000
You're not Ranganath now
but Yusuf Khan.

953
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:19,500
You're now the world's
most dreaded terrorist.

954
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:23,708
Do you know at the mention of
your name entire globe shivers?

955
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:27,208
You've killed many mercilessly.

956
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:31,208
If you've headache,
you use bullets as tablets.

957
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:34,583
At the mention of your name,
even dead bodies will shiver.

958
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:41,708
Overacting with me...
making faces... Shut up!

959
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:53,458
Tonight as soon as Yusuf Khan arrives,
you'll be shifted to another flight,

960
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,458
while shifting I'll give you a signal,

961
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:58,250
all of them must sleep on ground,

962
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,750
I think you will understand this.

963
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:07,625
Inform all passengers and
hijackers mustn't know about it.

964
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,125
I trust you can do this.

965
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,458
Not only that number of hijackers
in the flight,

966
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:16,250
and the weapons they're carrying,
we must know the details.

967
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:39,833
You say hand grenades,
what if they detonate it?

968
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,125
I'll not give them so much time.

969
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:47,833
They'll get alerted.

970
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,625
We must think of a signal
which will not alert them.

971
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
That's our signal!

972
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:13,000
Take it out!

973
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,375
Sit in your seat.

974
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:53,875
Where's the cell phone?
- Inside the socks.

975
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:08,125
Sources say Yusuf Khan's flight will
be reaching Tirupathi anytime now,

976
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:14,000
and we expect hijackers would release
women and children after that.

977
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:16,625
Flight carrying Yusuf Khan
will land at <i>8</i> pm,

978
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:20,125
we must get into that flight by 8.10 pm,
that's 10 minutes,

979
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:23,500
the countdown begins with the first
passenger getting down from this flight.

980
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:25,333
Why?
They're releasing Yusuf Khan, right?

981
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:28,333
We must be ready for any eventuality,
we mustn't trust them blindly.

982
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,833
Let anything may happen to us,
we mustn't lose this battle.

983
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,333
If we've to blow up this flight
in 10 minutes,

984
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,500
I'll have the remote with me.
- If everything goes on well.

985
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,625
This is our last and final warning.

986
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:52,208
Can I ask you a thing?

987
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:56,208
Do you think they're carrying
just one hand grenade?

988
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:07,208
If it goes off, nobody will survive.
- How then?

989
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:12,125
Okay, keep it secret.
Trust me.

990
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:38,583
Greetings sir.

991
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:56,750
My address is with make-up man,
if anything happens to me...

992
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,875
Please inform my parents, sir.

993
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:03,583
I'll feel proud if it happens
while on duty.

994
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:06,500
Nothing will happen to you, go.

995
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:33,750
Ask all of them to get down.

996
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,500
Take your hand bags and get down.

997
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:58,958
Mummy, my doll!
- Dear!

998
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:14,625
Stop! What happened?

999
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:17,458
I forgot the gift given
by Subhash uncle.

1000
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:24,750
Dear, I too have a gift for you.

1001
01:49:32,083 --> 01:49:34,500
One press of button and
all of you would die.

1002
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:51,750
Act as if you're having fits.
- I'm not getting it, sir.

1003
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:53,958
Just act like that.

1004
01:49:56,125 --> 01:49:58,250
If he comes near, he'll kill you.

1005
01:50:19,125 --> 01:50:22,250
Are you mad?
He may die without medical help.

1006
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,125
Don't come near.

1007
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,083
I must get into that flight.
If not I'll kill everyone.

1008
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:23,208
Ranganath, act as if you've fainted,
let anything happen don't move.

1009
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:28,375
Hey! Look at him!

1010
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,375
He may die.

1011
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,333
What happened?

1012
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,000
We didn't find the bomb.

1013
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:51,833
We checked thoroughly all the 5 terrorists.
It's not with anyone of them.

1014
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:53,708
It's not in the flight too.

1015
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:58,708
I'm sure it'll be somewhere
here only.

1016
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:25,250
Who gave you this dear?

1017
01:55:26,125 --> 01:55:29,958
Uncle gave this as gift inside the flight.
- Take her away.

1018
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:34,250
Is there time to defuse this bomb?

1019
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:38,250
No time.

1020
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:54,208
Can we clap now?

1021
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Did I overact?

1022
01:57:04,208 --> 01:57:07,208
No, you can join the
duty immediately.

1023
01:57:47,083 --> 01:57:48,583
Take care.

1024
01:57:48,875 --> 01:57:50,250
Bye.
- Bye.

1025
01:57:50,375 --> 01:57:53,250
Please do come to my country.
- Definitely.

1026
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:05,250
Let's meet again.

1027
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:12,958
If we don't have such things.

1028
01:58:28,625 --> 01:58:30,625
Can you please give your phone number?

1029
01:58:36,958 --> 01:58:39,000
How could you come so late
from shopping?

1030
01:58:42,458 --> 01:58:45,333
It's not Parvathi,
she has nothing to do with it.

1031
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:49,500
Flight was hijacked, right?
I'm in Tirupathi.

1032
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,500
They took away my cell phone
and gave it back just now only.

1033
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:55,000
I'm talking to you after
they gave the cell phone,

1034
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:58,125
I don't have any affair
with Parvathi, my dear...Believe me.

1035
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:03,625
No my dear...

1036
01:59:03,833 --> 01:59:06,125
They took my cell phone
and gave it back just now.

1037
01:59:06,333 --> 01:59:08,625
I didn't have time to call you,
that's why I didn't call you.

1038
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:14,833
What?- I was here for two days,
this is union rate card,

1039
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,833
who will pay me sir?
What's this sir?

1040
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,208
Can I take a photo with you sir?

1041
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,875
No?

1042
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,625
Okay?

1043
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:35,125
Put your hand on my shoulder sir.

1044
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:37,708
You're a real hero sir.
Click it.

1045
01:59:39,375 --> 01:59:40,708
Greetings.

1046
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:41,708
What?

1047
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,708
You've been blessed with a grandson.

1048
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:45,500
What great news! Lord Venkateshwara.

1049
01:59:45,708 --> 01:59:47,000
Your husband?- Yes uncle.

1050
01:59:53,875 --> 01:59:55,375
Are you the owner of this flight?

1051
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,000
The colour is not good as per
the building almanac.

1052
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,875
Better to change it.
Bye.
