00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,680
Ehtesham Khalid. Sociology professor
at the university.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
Professor is booking
a room in a hotel.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,160
Perfect, let's track him.
- How long will this go on?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
How far did you go with those girls?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,080
I made a mistake.
- And 2013, the harassment case?

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,240
We ran away together 15 years ago.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,480
We've been together ever since.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,280
Both of you should marry
two brothers.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,080
We are enough for each other...

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,640
For everything!

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,120
Mr and Mrs Karim Ali. - They didn't
have children of their own.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
How dare you come here!

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,840
I thought...
- She ran away when she was 15.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
They are in love with each other.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Abort. We won't do anything.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,640
So you will lie to Shehnaz?

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,640
Hello, Shehnaz?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,680
{ an3}Sara!

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm doing a TV serial, it's a small
role, but the TRPs are great!

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,200
And I've also met someone.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,000
Just like my parents...

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,600
you betrayed me too.

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,720
"I am a witch."

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,240
"My eyes cast black magic."

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,360
"I wander in the darkness of night."

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,920
"My aura will instil fear in you."

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
"Witch.
- It's my reincarnation."

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,240
"Witch.
- It's the end of your story."

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,720
'CHURAILS'

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
5. BOUNDARIES...

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
If you want to die, you cut
vertically, not horizontally.

32
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,840
Who the fuck wants to die?

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm just addicted to the pain.
- What a drama queen!

34
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
I will leave in a couple of days.

35
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,480
No one is going anywhere.

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,160
Just go back to sleep.

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Grumpy!

38
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,240
'The upward swing in Karachi
Stock Exchange continues.'

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,000
'And the trading has seen
an increase in 100 Index'

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
'of over 550 points.'

41
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,280
'Index has crossed the 36,000 mark.'

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
'Housewife turns butcher!'

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
'A 50 year old woman,

'brutally murdered her husband,'

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
'severed his leg'

46
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,880
'and cooked 'nihari'
(stew) with it.'

47
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,760
'Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
'Nihari!'

48
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
{ an3}Boss.

49
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,640
Hmm?

50
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
Boss...

51
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
What is it?

52
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,560
That 'nihari' lady...

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,760
has lost her mind.

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
She's talking about ghosts
and 'churails' (witches).

55
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,000
You handle her.

56
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
'Churails.'

57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,440
What did you say?

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,920
Witches.

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
'Churails.'

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
I haven't seen them.

61
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,760
Then how did you meet them?
- Halal.

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
Men will suffer.

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
Halal, men will suffer.

64
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
What is she saying?

65
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,760
I don't know,
boss, you deal with this.

66
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,920
Is she drunk?
- Halal Designs.

67
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
That's the name of the shop.

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
The women working in that shop...

69
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,040
have taken advantage of my client's
fragile psychological state.

70
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,280
They forced her into murdering
her husband.

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
Wow, madam!

72
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
She slaughtered him,
cooked him and ate him.

73
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,760
But witches are to be blamed.

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
{ an3}Nice!

75
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
{ an3}Boss.

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
'The number you've called is
currently switched off.'

77
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,200
'Please try again later.'

78
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,840
"MEN WILL SUFFER"

79
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Sir.

80
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,280
I need a search warrant issued.

81
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
Appears to be a clothing store,
but it might be...

82
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,080
more than what it appears to be.

83
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
The name of the shop
is Halal Designs.

84
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
And the building this shop is in...

85
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,240
Belongs to Jamil Khan.

86
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,920
Welcome to my kitty party.
Ooh, is that a Gucci bag?

87
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,400
Did you know slaves die for this?

88
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,240
Yes, This diamond swag.

89
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,920
Owners and employees on one side,
everyone else vacate this place.

90
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,400
The shop will be closed
for a little while.

91
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
Hurry up and leave!

92
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,120
Go out.

93
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Blow your husbands' cash
some place else!

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
Dear Afzal!
- Yes, sir.

95
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
You'll confiscate everyone's
phones...

96
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,560
and other dear officers will search
every corner of this shop.

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Thank you for your co-operation.

98
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,200
What is happening?
- Give me your phone.

99
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,680
What's going on madam,
is that we've a warrant...

100
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,040
to search the property...

101
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,480
and to confiscate any electronic
equipment...

102
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,360
including phones,
computers as evidence.

103
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,640
You know whose wife I am?

104
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,560
I do,
that's why I've come here myself.

105
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,840
Else in this scorching heat,
all I want to do...

106
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,640
is lie butt naked in a freezer.

107
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,640
Leave no stone unturned, boys.

108
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,400
Afzal.
- Yes, sir?

109
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
Madam's mobile phone.

110
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
{ an3}Boss!

111
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
There is a basement here!

112
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,840
Come and check this out!

113
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Well...

114
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,160
What does Shehnaz Khalid
have to do with you?

115
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,160
Shehnaz Khalid.

116
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,040
That cannibal? I saw it on the news.

117
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
{ an3}News?

118
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,640
May I suggest something?

119
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
Until the investigation is over...

120
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Keep your shop closed.

121
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,640
Thank you for the suggestion but
until you charge us for a crime...

122
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
it will be business as usual here.

123
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,880
Shehnaz's lawyer will plead
impairment due to grief.

124
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,160
Insanity defence.

125
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,320
The blame will be shifted to us.
The police will come knocking.

126
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,120
But they won't find
anything here.

127
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,080
Chop, chop!

128
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,200
The one having the betel quid...

129
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
God damn!

130
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,400
Boss, aunty's eyes are
burning with madness.

131
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
She'll fuck you up.

132
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,560
Imran...

133
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,240
All my life,
I've been searching for a woman...

134
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,040
who'll fuck me up, good and proper.

135
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
She'll do that, boss.

136
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,040
Call your media guy.

137
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,920
Boss, then...

138
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,720
They'll shit bricks.
- Yes.

139
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
That's how the truth will come out.

140
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,400
Hello? Yes, Chand Nawab.

141
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
Viewers...

142
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,920
Welcome to 'Be Parda' once again.

143
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
I am your friend, your host...

144
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,480
Anees Qadri.

145
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,200
Just a few minutes ago,
we broke exclusive news to you.

146
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Cannibal Shehnaz didn't turn her
house into a slaughterhouse...

147
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
all by herself.

148
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,600
Right now, our team is present
outside a clothing shop.

149
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Halal Designs.

150
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Dilbar...

151
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We're fucked.

152
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,160
Make sure you report
about this properly.

153
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,960
"Stop, where are you going?"

154
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,480
Ma'am, answer us.
- You stay back.

155
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,240
Ma'am, how are you connected
to Shehnaz Khalid?

156
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,360
'Two women are behind this shop.'

157
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,720
'An infamous socialite,
Jugnu Chaudhry,'

158
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,160
'and Sara Khan.'

159
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,920
'Whose husband Jamil Khan is
a renowned politician.'

160
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,560
'He's been an MNA for TIT party.'

161
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,360
'Working with them was
a seasoned criminal,'

162
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
'Batool Hussain.'

163
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,280
'Men Will Suffer.'

164
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,200
This slogan can be seen...

165
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,040
everywhere across the city.

166
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,800
'In our society where women are
exemplified for their innocence'

167
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,680
'why did these women plot this
conspiracy against men?'

168
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
Infamous socialite?
I'll fucking kill these people!

169
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Boss, a jeep is here for you.

170
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
Jamil.

171
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
You, me and Batool will exit
from the front door.

172
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
The rest of you, take the back exit.

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,920
No, we will go together.
- No, honey.

174
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Back door. Now!

175
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Get going, we need to hurry.

176
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Come on.
- We want answers.

177
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,760
You have to answer us.

178
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Are you involved?

179
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,880
A random girl rocks up with
absolutely no proof...

180
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,320
says what she wants,
and you believe her.

181
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
You all should be reporting real,
actual news.

182
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
So her claim that Jamil Khan
harassed her is false?

183
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,920
It's completely false!

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,920
My husband can never
do such a thing.

185
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,320
Ma'am, didn't you think...

186
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,880
that this could sabotage your
husband's political career?

187
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,160
Ma'am! You have to answer!

188
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,440
You cannot leave without answering,
ma'am!

189
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
Ma'am, tell us!

190
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,520
Hell!

191
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,880
Ma'am please answer.

192
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,600
You have to respond.

193
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,560
You know what I find real ironic?

194
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,040
For all of this anti-male
propaganda...

195
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,120
who do you think saved the
poor damsel in distress?

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,040
It was her husband!

197
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
We don't know that.
- Of course we do!

198
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,520
That was his car.
Those were his men.

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,920
Sometimes I think,
it's convenient for you...

200
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
to use men however you feel...

201
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,640
Junaid, whatever happened to
'innocent until proven guilty'?

202
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,600
'At this point,
it's all conjecture.'

203
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,240
'Nothing so far links them
either to the murder'

204
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,520
'or to the 'Men Will
Suffer' campaign.'

205
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,040
What was the need to send
an army of guards?

206
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,840
'Why do you think that the police
was there in the first place?'

207
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,920
Is it true?

208
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Is this true?

209
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
I'll ask you this once.

210
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,080
Tell me the truth.

211
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,640
With that girl...
- Of course not!

212
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
{ an3}Okay.

213
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,040
It'll be my word against hers.

214
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,800
I was alone. There is...

215
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,440
No alibi. I...

216
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
I got you, baby.

217
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
I got you.

218
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,640
It's nothing like that,
we are running a small boutique.

219
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,000
I should've known better.

220
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
I shouldn't have given
you the permission.

221
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,200
Who asked for your permission?

222
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,680
You'll shut down this
boutique immediately.

223
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Fine, I'll until the investigation
is complete. - No!

224
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,640
I mean shut it down for good.

225
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,800
No chance in hell. - Sara,
what the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,600
That building is under my name,
it's gonna fuck my career!

227
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
So, you'd rather fuck mine?

228
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,800
I am not your enemy!

229
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,480
Then don't ask me to leave
the one thing...

230
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
that truly belongs only to me.

231
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,040
I need this, Jamil.
I need this more than I need you...

232
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,000
more than I need my kids and
that is the honest truth.

233
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,920
{ an3}Fine.

234
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,640
At least tell me how I can help you.

235
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,560
Just let me do my job.

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Okay.
- Thank you.

237
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,400
'The number you've called is
currently switched off.'

238
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,600
Who are you calling?

239
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,440
The one whose name we
don't take any more.

240
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Sheila?

241
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,560
Sara will fire me if
she comes to know.

242
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,080
But I thought, now that everything
is coming to an end...

243
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,000
she might help me get an audition.

244
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,400
Oye, little one!

245
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
Now you'll go do vulgar dances
in films? Fuck that!

246
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,040
Better than being a whore,
dancing around in beds.

247
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,920
Here, with all of you, for
the first time, I felt...

248
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,240
That I had a purpose.

249
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,120
Let me tell you.

250
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,680
This bitch of a life we live...

251
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,520
is designed to keep us
away from happiness.

252
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
Just when happiness is
almost in our reach...

253
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,840
the universe shoves a long
shaft up our asses.

254
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,360
So what? You enjoy shafts up your
ass. - I knew you'd say that!

255
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,800
Cheap lesbo!

256
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,800
You tell me, what does the universe
have to do with any of this?

257
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
We are enough to fuck each other up.

258
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,040
Right? Why are people so awful?

259
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,840
Munni,
even I don't have an answer to that.

260
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,200
Why do you take so much fatigue?
Here, have this.

261
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Watch the waves.

262
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,760
Enjoy.

263
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,560
You won't find anything in
the computers and phones.

264
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,080
Because there is nothing to find.

265
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Ma'am...

266
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm not done talking.

267
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
{ an3}Talk.

268
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,520
If it's about medal or promotion...

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,560
and you need a scapegoat for that,
I'm at your service.

270
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
Arrest me...

271
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Punish me.

272
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,960
But don't...

273
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,040
humiliate the others.

274
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,880
Indeed, you're a scapegoat for them.

275
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,800
You have a family, boss?

276
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,000
I have a father...

277
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,520
a mother, a brother...

278
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,120
I don't have a wife.

279
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
God willing, I'll have one soon.

280
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
I had parents too.

281
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,920
I lost them.

282
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I had a husband...

283
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
A daughter...

284
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,840
I lost them too.

285
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,760
Now that I'm about to
lose my third...

286
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,080
and last family, I've realised...

287
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,320
That we keep repeating the same
mistakes, again and again...

288
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,640
Going around in circles.

289
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
And then one day we die.

290
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,640
Then, no mistake...

291
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,040
and no circle.

292
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,080
We need to rectify the mistake.

293
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,920
I mean, infamous socialite?

294
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Infamous socialite!

295
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
What a tragedy darling, I swear.

296
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,520
Honestly! I mean, I was just like...

297
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,040
Ask him.
Ask him! You know. I mean...

298
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I was in tears.
Literally, natural tears.

299
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
I was like,
'Bitches, do you even know,'

300
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
'Jugnu Chaudhry is to Pakistan'

301
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,560
'what Kim Kardashian
is to the West.'

302
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
'Or Khloe, or Kendall.'
- Kendall's far too young.

303
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,600
Oh, that is so sweet, boys.

304
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,680
And, I know this is totally bizarre
and I hate to have asked...

305
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,880
but us queens should've each
other's backs, right?

306
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Oh honey, literally.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,520
We're really glad that
you came to us.

308
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Look, we can't really hand
over the weddings to you.

309
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,600
Our clients want the personal...

310
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,920
Ro and Ho touch.

311
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
But you can take over
the smaller projects.

312
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,440
We will of course take a
tiny percentage from it.

313
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
But you'll have complete
creative freedom.

314
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,840
This is...
- 'Khatna' party.

315
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
Beg your pardon?

316
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,240
They're all the rage these days!

317
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,400
What kind of celebration is that?

318
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Circumcision! Get with it!

319
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,680
You know, snip, snip!

320
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,600
Think 'Aqeeqah' 2.0.

321
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,360
Oh, I like that.
- Yes. Me too, me too!

322
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,360
Listen,
can you keep this too please?

323
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,200
The table is right there.

324
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,680
Yes.
- You leave it there.

325
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Thank you.

326
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,120
Can I take a picture with you?

327
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,160
Oh! Sure.

328
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,040
This...

329
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,600
How are you doin'?

330
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,560
Did it hurt?

331
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,600
No pain, no gain, little one.

332
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Anyway...

333
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,080
Congratulations!

334
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,920
Here, your...
- Take a full length.

335
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
{ an3}Okay.

336
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,200
My sister used your service
to catch her husband.

337
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,320
Um, I don't know...

338
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I know we're not supposed
to talk about it here.

339
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
But he suffered.

340
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,960
It was good.

341
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,840
He finally learnt a lesson.

342
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,760
May God bless you and your sisters.

343
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
You heard that?

344
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,440
But you're going to grow up
to be a good one, right?

345
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
Really good one.

346
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,920
"A WIFE BRUTALLY MURDERS
HER HUSBAND."

347
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,480
Laptops, mobile phones...

348
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
are all clean.

349
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
There's been no push back
from the higher powers.

350
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,480
If Jamil Khan's wife was
really involved...

351
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,680
he wouldn't have stayed quiet.

352
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,000
Sir, I think before everyone
starts saying...

353
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,240
that we've framed innocent
women in a fake case...

354
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Let's bury this here.

355
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,480
Our entire department will
be slandered, Jamshed!

356
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,880
Sir, before matters get worse...

357
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,640
a little humiliation now would do.

358
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
What do you say?

359
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
You did it for me?

360
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Shehnaz Khalid's claim against Halal
Designs has been proven wrong.

361
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,920
Our entire police force...

362
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,600
apologises to the respectable
ladies of Halal Designs...

363
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,920
who have come under undue scrutiny
due to our investigation.

364
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,760
I request public and media both...

365
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,400
to not focus much on any news
against Halal Designs.

366
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
'Now, now, Hania, I know
what side you're on,'

367
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,040
'but one has to ask.'

368
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,920
What kind of pressure has Jamil Khan
put on the police department...

369
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
'for them to take a
u-turn like this?'

370
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,320
'Oh, well. Here we go again with
the conspiracy theories.'

371
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,480
I can't remember when you put this.

372
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't know. I guess...

373
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,800
Two years ago.

374
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,600
You were in London.

375
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
Oh, yeah!

376
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,440
It's pretty.

377
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,120
We need to call Dr Hansotia.

378
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,880
Why? Is the baby okay?

379
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
{ an3}Yeah.

380
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,760
The baby is fine.

381
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,920
'I for one am very happy
that these...

382
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,640
women have been proved innocent.'

383
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,880
The boutique is reopening today.

384
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
'That's all for now, folks.'

385
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
'Join us next week,
for some more Frank Talk.'

386
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,880
They won't stop hounding
you so easily.

387
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Nor you.

388
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,000
What fun is politics without
some scandal?

389
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Go.

390
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,040
I got you.

391
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
Stop firing the gardeners.

392
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
As per the police,
Halal Designs and its owners...

393
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,880
didn't conspire with
Shehnaz Khalid.

394
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,520
Then why are the public
protesting today?

395
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,720
Is some aspect of the investigation
being hidden from us?

396
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,880
Or is this a plan orchestrated by
Jamil Khan's political opponents?

397
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,520
To find out, keep watching Rise
News. - Churails! - Down with them!

398
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,920
Churails!
- Down with them!

399
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,440
Churails!
- Down with them!

400
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,840
Churails!
- Down with them!

401
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,080
Churails!
- Down with them!

402
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
Everyone move back!
Please, you move back!

403
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,960
Churails!
- Down with them!

404
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,440
Move back, man!
- Churails! Down with them!

405
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Churails! Down with them!
- You've come here to save them?

406
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,200
Who the fuck are they to you?
- Go back!

407
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,040
Is your mother or sister in there?

408
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,480
Churails!
- Down with them!

409
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,040
Churails!
- Down with them!

410
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,160
Leave it, I'll sort him out!

411
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
It's strange.

412
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,800
You men just stood there?

413
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,920
Yes, boss.

414
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,120
As men, we didn't want to be
an obstacle for the women.

415
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,920
This was their battle.

416
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Churails!
- Down with them!

417
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
Churails!
- Down with them!

418
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,280
Churails!
- Down with them!

419
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,520
Churails!
- Down with them!

420
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,280
Churails! - Down with them!
They've challenged our honour...

421
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,680
and provoked our women.

422
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,600
Damn this pseudo feminism!
Condemn them.

423
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,880
Churails!
- Down with them!

424
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,200
Churails!
- Down with them!

425
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
Churails!
- Down with them!

426
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Churails!
- Down with them!

427
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,000
Churails!
- Down with them!

428
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,080
'They cast the first stone.'

429
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,160
Viewers, our team is currently
outside Halal Designs...

430
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
where the peaceful protest is now
taking a turn for the worse.

431
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,440
'Few unidentifiable women'

432
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,360
'draped in burkas, have suddenly
emerged out of Halal Designs.'

433
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,640
Churails!
- Down with them!

434
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
Churails!
- Down with them!

435
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,520
Churails!
- Down with them!

436
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,640
Churails!
- Down with them!

437
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,760
Strike!

438
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,280
Hit them!

439
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,880
Hit!

440
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,640
Leave it, you fuck! Leave it!

441
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
You fucker!

442
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,360
Go away!
- She has lost her mind.

443
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,400
You're mad!

444
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,760
Get the fuck out from here!

445
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
You asshole!

446
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,160
You wanna mess with me?

447
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,440
You can see how many
people behind me...

448
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
are hitting each other!

449
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Look at them fight. - Ma'am,
why are you causing so much terror?

450
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,800
This is our home.

451
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
And it's our duty to
defend our house.

452
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,840
Come here now!

453
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,320
Who else wants a piece of this?

454
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,040
Who else?

455
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,880
Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's move!

456
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Hey, go away!

457
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,480
Step back.

458
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,880
Batool, ma'am...

459
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,640
Our public is hot-blooded.

460
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,040
They will boil for a few days...

461
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,080
and eventually simmer down.

462
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,760
Until then,
you should put the shutter down.

463
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,400
And hire a security company.

464
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,080
'Why are you causing so much terror?
- This is our house.'

465
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,360
'And it is our duty to defend it.'

466
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,360
Oh, thank God!

467
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,480
Are you kids okay?

468
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,640
We're fine.
- Where's mommy?

469
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,520
She'll be back home soon.

470
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,440
Grace, can you get the meal ready?

471
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Sir,
there's a mob of people outside.

472
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
I know.

473
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Ifti...

474
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,440
Talk to Jugnu.

475
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,040
I'll talk to Sara.

476
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,040
It's gone too far.

477
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,200
If we hire security for our
protection... that means we lost.

478
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,200
We don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

479
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,120
You've to admit, it was a bad
idea to reopen shop so soon.

480
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,480
You don't show a sheep
how to be a wolf...

481
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,480
and then force it to
be a sheep again!

482
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,880
For the first time in life,
we are having so much fun.

483
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
And to say no to fun is a sin!
- You guys have lost your mind.

484
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,200
We will guard ourselves... In turns.

485
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,160
Yes,
tonight Babli, Dilbar and I'll stay.

486
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,480
Tomorrow, Shams...
- Babli won't stay.

487
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,880
I'll stay! - The inspector was
also... - You don't say a word.

488
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,880
I'll stay too.
- It's not fucking safe!

489
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,360
I will stay the night!

490
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,440
{ an3}Fine!

491
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,000
That's it!

492
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,000
You will not stay here.

493
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,080
Don't behave like a man with me.

494
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,640
Whore!

495
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,760
Do you love me?

496
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,080
What sort of love doesn't give you
the courage to stay away from me?

497
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,840
I don't give a fuck about courage!

498
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
You get scared without me, silly!

499
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,840
Yes, that's because I've never
seen anything without you.

500
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,160
Never done anything without you.

501
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,480
Now I will.
- Really?

502
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
You've the nerve to try it?
Show me!

503
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,920
You don't think I've something
going on with Munni, do you?

504
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,800
Get lost! Go die!
- I swear to God...

505
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,880
It's nothing like that.

506
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,520
I'm going to live and
die in your arms.

507
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,040
Right?

508
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,840
I'll be back in an hour.

509
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,160
I'll call, keep the shutters down.
- Yes, boss.

510
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,840
We can leave all this behind
and start a new life.

511
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,080
But just boxing and I,
might not be enough for you.

512
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,240
Don't say that.

513
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,000
It'll be enough.

514
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
I mean, almost enough.

515
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,400
All of you've this itch
to conquer the world.

516
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,240
And I'm crazy about that itch.

517
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,000
Why can't all men be like you?

518
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,200
If everyone was like me...

519
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,640
wouldn't you floozies
go out of business!

520
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
Be quiet!

521
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
Hello, uncle.

522
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,080
What brings you here?

523
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,640
You don't return my
calls or visit me.

524
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,640
What am I supposed to do?

525
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,800
What is all this ruckus for?

526
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,040
There's no ruckus.

527
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,520
There is a shop.

528
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,040
It's just a bunch of us trying
to live our lives.

529
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Shouldn't be that difficult,
should it?

530
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Hmm!

531
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,960
That's the thing, you know.

532
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
I mean...

533
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,840
Don't get me wrong, I love women.

534
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,600
No one loves women the
way I love women.

535
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,040
But you...

536
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,840
Not just you, all of you.

537
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,080
You've got a thing about notions.

538
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,600
You know?

539
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
The notion of...

540
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,120
wanting more,
being more, deserving more.

541
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,520
All of this gets inside you.

542
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
And reason just flies
out of the window.

543
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,240
I'll leave some guards outside.

544
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,920
No, thank you.

545
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,400
I won't keep your guards.

546
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,960
Since reason has already
flown out of the window.

547
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
Visit your father.

548
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,080
He is not keeping well these days.

549
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,080
You visiting him is enough.

550
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,840
We won't let them go!
We need a verdict against them!

551
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,200
We're not going to leave them!

552
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,240
We won't stop! Give us answers!

553
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,680
We need a verdict! We need answers!

554
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,280
Madam?

555
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,800
We want an answer."

556
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,840
We will decide. We need answers.

557
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,120
The night this girl is
talking about...

558
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,200
I'd an emergency appointment with
my gynaecologist, Dr Hansotia.

559
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,160
Jamil was with me.

560
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,400
You can check the clinic records.

561
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,280
ow is that possible? Why were we
not told about this earlier?

562
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,600
If I can reach that girl through
the media... - Be quiet.

563
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,200
I would like to request her...

564
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,920
to stop harassing my family and take
back the false accusations.

565
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,600
Where are the kids?
- Oh thank God, you made it!

566
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,960
Where are the kids?

567
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
Since afternoon, there's been a
mob... - Where are the kids?

568
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,920
The kids are inside.
They're asleep. They're fine.

569
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,600
I have risked all your lives!

570
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,080
I really don't know what
I was thinking. - Hey!

571
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,040
I don't know.
- Hey! It's okay.

572
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Our guards are outside.
I've made a few calls.

573
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
Everything will settle down by
tomorrow. - I'll take care of you.

574
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,840
I'm just here to change.
I've to go back.

575
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,720
No, no, no, you can't!

576
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,320
Haven't you seen the situation
outside? They're out for your blood.

577
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,120
They're waiting for me, Jamil.
- No.

578
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,840
If you go back...
- Please, I've to go.

579
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,680
Do you understand...
- At least think of the kids!

580
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,440
Fine, I'll just call them.

581
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
It's fine.

582
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,240
We are here, we will manage.

583
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,360
You rest.

584
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
Okay? Bye.

585
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,040
Jugnu boss?

586
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,560
No, Sara.

587
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,080
She said she can't get
out of her house.

588
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,040
You like Jugnu a lot, right?

589
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,040
Does everyone know?

590
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,640
Yes.

591
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Love has made you stylish.

592
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,760
Any fucker can change
his outer appearance.

593
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,680
But what's inside...

594
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,040
What can we do about that?

595
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,920
But a man is allowed to dream.

596
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
{ an3}So...

597
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,960
Let's dream!

598
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,880
Oh, I was wondering when
you'd show your face.

599
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,920
You lied.

600
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,120
Your husband was not with you.

601
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,360
You went to the doctor
alone that night.

602
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,080
Believe me.

603
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,760
All I've got is humiliation
by going public.

604
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,200
And humiliation is all you'll get.

605
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,920
You can open your filthy mouth to
the media as much as you want...

606
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,720
but they'll only print cartoons
about you in the papers.

607
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,560
You'll be discredited,
called a whore, made a mockery of.

608
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,960
You, your family, your job
will all go up in smoke.

609
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Why are you doing this?

610
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,560
Because I'll go to any
length for my husband.

611
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,920
Now go and sit on your bike...

612
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,920
And leave for good.

613
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,720
Oh, fuck!

614
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,880
Babli!
- Babli, open the door. Babli!

615
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Babli!

616
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,080
Oh my, Sheila. Sexy superstar!
- Babli!

617
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,240
Babli, hurry up and open the door!

618
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,920
Babli!

619
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,480
Babli, please open the door!

620
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,560
Babli, come out, let's go!

621
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,200
Babli!

622
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,160
Dilbar, back door!

623
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,800
Babli!

624
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,480
Dilbar! Dilbar!

625
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,000
"Lock the door baby,
and awaken the desire in me."

626
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,040
"Quench your thirst with me.
Oh, my loverboy!"

627
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, fuck!

628
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,760
Munni!

629
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,840
Fuck!
- Babli!

630
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,520
Babli!

631
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,960
Babli!

632
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,760
Babli, get up! Babli!

633
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,840
Babli, open your eyes!

634
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
Babli, wake up! Babli, are you okay?

635
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,240
Sheila and I were flatmates.

636
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,080
She was beautiful.

637
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,680
So she kept getting work.

638
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,680
Stage shows, TV series.

639
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,160
Have you watched the movie 'Jawaani
Kahin Nahi Jaani'?

640
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,320
There was an item song
in the movie...

641
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,760
'Lover Boy'.

642
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,880
Sheila was a background
dancer in it.

643
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,520
She looked great in it.

644
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,760
Anyway...

645
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,920
it has been a month now...

646
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,280
And I have not heard from her.

647
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,320
The agency has no answers.

648
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,240
Her entire stuff is at our place.

649
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Talk to Sheila's family.

650
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,600
They don't have a clue either.

651
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,200
I don't know how I can help you.

652
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,120
Ma'am...

653
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,400
You've helped women before.

654
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,600
Sheila told me.

655
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,640
Please find her.

656
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,360
Please.

657
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,760
Sorry, there's nothing I can do.

658
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,160
"Who should I discuss?"

659
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,720
"This issue with?"

660
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,720
"Who should I discuss?"

661
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,960
"This issue with?"

662
00:51:52,200 --> 00:52:00,040
"Don't you meet?"

663
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,760
"Don't you meet?"

664
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,080
How bad is it?

665
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,560
Bad!

666
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,040
Are you coming?

667
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,160
Me?

668
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,400
No.

669
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,080
Jugnu, this was...

670
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,560
I was meant to be there. I was...

671
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,120
How will we get through this?

672
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,800
"Why don't you assuage?"

673
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,000
"My feelings."

674
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,120
I don't know, Sara.

675
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,120
I don't know.

676
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:01,800
"I have just one talent."

677
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:16,440
"I have just one talent."

678
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:26,920
"Annoy everyone you meet!"

679
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:39,080
"Annoy everyone you meet!"

680
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:54,000
"Keep meeting like this..."

681
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,480
"So..."

682
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:08,840
"The height of betrayal.."

683
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,920
"is this."

684
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,480
"Don't you meet?"

685
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:37,120
"Don't you meet?"

686
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,760
'You think you've figured us out'

687
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,440
'but you haven't.'

688
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,520
'We've been in hiding,
far away from your rejections,'

689
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,400
'accusations and judgments.'

690
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,280
'Our bodies, our minds'

691
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,400
'our desires...'

692
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,360
'Hiding it all from you.'

693
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,920
My daughter.

694
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,360
I need to find her.

695
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
'And now if we break
down the walls,'

696
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,520
'pull back the curtains...'

697
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,440
'And reveal everything to you...'

698
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,160
'Will your fragile ego,
be ready for our rebellion?'
