1
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,167
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY!
HAVE A SPIRITED LIFE!

2
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,208
You did not heed my words!

3
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,583
He's still inside me…

4
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,417
and urges me to cause harm.

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,083
I'm so terrified!

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,208
Don't look him in the eye!
He's pure evil.

7
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,167
I just can't take it anymore!

8
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,167
Hello!

9
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,500
Hello.

10
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,250
<i>Why haven't you met him yet?</i>

11
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,208
<i>I've been pleading with you
for the past couple of days.</i>

12
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,417
<i>Why aren't you meeting him?</i>

13
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,333
I was caught up with some work.

14
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,417
<i>I beg of you. Please meet him today.</i>

15
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,125
<i>Can't you feel my agony?</i>

16
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,750
I'm running low on cash.

17
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,833
<i>Just meet him and convey the message.
He'll pay you enough.</i>

18
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:43,750
Sure.

19
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,417
<i>How are you, brother?</i>

20
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,583
I'm fine. What about you?

21
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,833
<i>I'm good.</i>

22
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,417
<i>I was at the library,
yesterday but you weren't there.</i>

23
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,167
Sorry, I was at the hospital.

24
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,458
It's about the book, right?

25
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,500
I just came in.
I'll have it ready for you.

26
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,958
<i>Thanks, bro.
Do you remember the name of the book?</i>

27
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,292
<i>Days that are gone.</i>

28
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,208
<i>Yeah, that's the one.</i>

29
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,125
-Selvam.
-Sir?

30
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,250
-Make an entry for these books as well.
-Sure, sir.

31
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,542
Selvam, are you preparing for your exams?

32
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,042
Will you clear it at least this time?

33
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,417
Hopefully, sir.

34
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,958
Leave him in peace, buddy.

35
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,667
-See you, Selvam.
-Okay, sir.

36
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,417
-See you, buddy.
-Okay.

37
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,792
Bro!

38
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:16,917
There is some leftover pizza in the box.

39
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,042
Have it.

40
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,500
Thanks.

41
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,125
-Hello.
-<i>Hello, sir.</i>

42
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,667
<i>We received a complaint
regarding your phone.</i>

43
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,375
<i>This is a verification call
regarding the same.</i>

44
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>Is the line clear now?</i>

45
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,458
Yes, it's fine now.
They fixed it last evening itself.

46
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,875
<i>Can I update your complaint status
as resolved?</i>

47
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,208
The line is clear

48
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,792
but the technician who came
in has taken away my phone

49
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,667
replacing it with
an old model phone.

50
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,917
It's like an old rotary.

51
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,792
Can it be replaced?
It's a huge task to dial each time.

52
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,167
<i>I get it.</i>

53
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,542
<i>But honestly speaking,
no one uses landline these days.</i>

54
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,667
<i>And even if they did, they
usually buy cordless phones.</i>

55
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,250
<i>That's why you might've
got some old instrument.</i>

56
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,125
<i>I'll surely update your request, sir.</i>

57
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,167
<i>We'll get the telephone replaced soon.</i>

58
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,708
-Okay, sir. No problem.
-<i>Hello, sir!</i>

59
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,750
<i>How would you rate our
service on a scale of one to ten?</i>

60
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,250
Eleven-fifteen.

61
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,208
<i>Sir?</i>

62
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,083
<i>Hello?</i>

63
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,542
<i>Sir?</i>

64
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,750
What happened?

65
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,375
He's disconnecting the call.

66
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,250
Does he have any other number?

67
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,583
I called his landline number
since his mobile phone is switched off.

68
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,125
He disconnecting that as well.

69
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,250
He'll come. Let's wait.

70
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,875
It was a pretty long sleep.

71
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,667
To be precise, it took eight
months and thirteen days

72
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,583
for you to wake up.

73
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,875
But, we were all very hopeful.

74
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,167
Relax.

75
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,542
Don't try to talk and strain yourself.

76
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,708
Your voice box was so badly
damaged that it had to be extracted.

77
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,167
You've lost your voice.

78
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,458
But there are many alternatives.

79
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:18,458
We are looking into it.

80
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,667
You want to know about the discharge?

81
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,625
We'll see about that later.

82
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,792
All you need now is, rest.

83
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,167
Okay.

84
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,958
Something unexpected had happened.

85
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,833
Before coming to your clinic…

86
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,875
the assailant had gone to your place.

87
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,750
No one survived.

88
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,750
You've helped so many to cope
up with grief through counseling.

89
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,042
But now…

90
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,667
You know better.

91
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:03,875
Here.

92
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,083
Have this.

93
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:06,917
Drink this.

94
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,250
Yeah, it's Dr. Vasanth.

95
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,500
Is Harish there?

96
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,750
This is the "Truevoice" electrolarynx.

97
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,333
Best in the market.

98
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
From now on, this is going
to be the voice of Dr. Indran.

99
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,458
Initially it will take him some time

100
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,208
but eventually, he'll get used to it.

101
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,333
There are tons of tutorial
videos on YouTube as well.

102
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,292
Okay.

103
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,583
So, when can I take him home?

104
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,083
I can't say anything as of now
as he has just woken up.

105
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,458
He needs to be kept under
observation for a few days.

106
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,667
We need to monitor him closely.

107
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,333
Besides that…

108
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,333
Dr.Indran's license has been
temporarily suspended by the council.

109
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,917
All of us know that
he was shot by his own patient.

110
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,125
The council has concerns about
Dr. Indra's treatment methods.

111
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,375
And since he's been in
a coma for such a long time,

112
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,000
they have doubts about
his ability to practice as well.

113
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,958
The council can take a walk.

114
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,375
Don't you know he's the best we have?

115
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,458
It's the council's decision.

116
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:05,458
Not mine.

117
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,875
And also, there's something you
need to know as his only guardian.

118
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,833
The bullet that entered his throat…

119
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,708
has also affected his CNS
and part of his cerebral cortex.

120
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,958
This in turn, has reduced his
reasoning capacity.

121
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,792
Classical case of post traumatic stress.

122
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,708
Correct!

123
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,917
But his anger and anxiety
levels are way higher.

124
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,917
So much that, there's no big
difference between him and his assailant.

125
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,792
Just because you're
authorized to treat him…

126
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,958
you think, you can say as you please?

127
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,292
Do you know his repertoire?

128
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,625
Dr. Indran, is almost an idol.

129
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,250
In fact, he's the one who recommended me
for my master's scholarship.

130
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,333
I want to see him get back
to his practice as well.

131
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,750
He needs help.

132
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,625
It reacts actively and
yields Phosphorous acid…

133
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,250
"Acid." It's "C" and not "S".

134
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,167
And Hydrogen Chloride.

135
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,583
The number of electrons in the…

136
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,125
Okay, guys.

137
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,292
Your next class is right
after your first exam.

138
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,292
Your first exam is Physics.

139
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,917
We've already revised quite a lot.

140
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,917
In case you have any doubts, you
can call me anytime.

141
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,875
Okay?

142
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,375
All the best. Do well.

143
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,792
Bye.

144
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,917
Thank you, teacher.

145
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,708
Move a little forward.
To your right. Yes.

146
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,833
Why didn't you go with your friends today?

147
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,792
I have some work in T. Nagar.

148
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,083
It's your third attempt, right?

149
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,167
Have you prepared
well at least this time?

150
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,375
Regardless of how much I try

151
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,292
I go blank during my exams.

152
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,083
<i>What work do you have in T. Nagar?</i>

153
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,375
<i>Do you need to buy something?</i>

154
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,333
<i>I have to get money from someone.</i>

155
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,542
<i>You could've asked me for it.</i>

156
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,917
<i>Why are you going that far?</i>

157
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,250
<i>No, I'm not going to borrow money.</i>

158
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,917
<i>It's my fee.
I get paid for my services.</i>

159
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,292
But, he insists on
meeting the boss in person.

160
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,625
<i>What kind of service is it, Selvam?</i>

161
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,833
<i>It's something similar to a postman's job.</i>

162
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:42,875
Okay, sir.

163
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,208
<i>Who writes letters these days, Selvam?</i>

164
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,917
<i>That's why, I deliver messages
for the people who can't write.</i>

165
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,250
Yes, please.

166
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,750
Sir, my name is Selvam.

167
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,208
I have an important message for you.

168
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:08,250
Go ahead, please.

169
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,583
Sir, it is something personal.

170
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,708
If someone else is here besides you…

171
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,292
can you…

172
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,833
Prem.

173
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,583
-Give us two minutes.
-Sure.

174
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,625
Go on.

175
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,958
Sir…

176
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,417
yesterday morning, your mother…

177
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:54,000
Sir, please tell him
to go and check for himself.

178
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,750
I'm telling you the truth.

179
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,042
Ask him to--

180
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,292
Mom!

181
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,167
Mom!

182
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,875
<i>The number you are
calling is either switched off</i>

183
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,958
<i>or not reachable at the moment.</i>

184
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,750
<i>Please try later.</i>

185
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,250
<i>Hello.</i>

186
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,917
<i>Why haven't you met him yet?</i>

187
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,667
<i>I've been pleading with
you for the past couple of days.</i>

188
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>Why aren't you meeting him?</i>

189
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:04,000
<i>I was stuck with some work.</i>

190
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,875
<i>I beg of you. Please meet him today.</i>

191
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>Can't you feel my agony?</i>

192
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,250
<i>I'm running low on cash.</i>

193
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,375
<i>Just meet him and convey the
message. He'll pay you enough.</i>

194
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,875
<i>Sure.</i>

195
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,125
Number 416.

196
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:23,708
Resolved.

197
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,333
Hi, Vinod.

198
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,375
-Hi.
-How're you?

199
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,458
I am fine. Sorry, I got delayed.

200
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,833
I got a call while I
was just about to leave.

201
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,542
-How are you?
-All good man.

202
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,667
So, what's with the new look?

203
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,958
Just like that.

204
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:15,917
Shall we leave?

205
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,667
The table won't wait for us.

206
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,875
As if the table could read the time.

207
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

208
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,375
Nothing.

209
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,000
First of all, wear your
seat belt properly.

210
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
Okay. See you.

211
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:14,833
We don't mind waiting.

212
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,125
You may finish your work and come back.

213
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,750
No, it's okay. It will take time.

214
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,458
-I'm in town until weekend. Call me.
-Yeah.

215
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,750
-Bye.
-Bye.

216
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,667
He doesn't even have my number.

217
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,333
How will he call me?

218
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,500
He's much better now.

219
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,833
There's a huge improvement,
ever since his former doctor returned.

220
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,458
Don't you remember?

221
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,458
We consulted a doctor from Nungambakkam.

222
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,000
It's the same doctor.

223
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,458
He doesn't scream like before.

224
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,792
And he eats properly.

225
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,875
He seems to enjoy the view.

226
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,292
He smiles as well.

227
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,125
So? How have you been?

228
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,208
How is your work going on?

229
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:58,792
It's going well, sister.

230
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,375
I get to train the kids.
That is a pretty good job.

231
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,917
Hey, I'm in the middle of cooking.

232
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,750
Give me ten minutes.
The dinner will be ready.

233
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,042
Okay.

234
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:08,958
Hey, Vinod.

235
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,708
Take him inside, please.

236
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,375
Sister!

237
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,083
Sister!

238
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,208
Vinod?

239
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:48,167
How did he get here?

240
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,792
How is he standing?

241
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,417
Pradeep!

242
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:57,833
Pradeep!

243
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,042
Pradeep!

244
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,458
How did this happen, Vinod?

245
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,375
I just can't believe this.

246
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,333
In the past eight months,
he's not even moved a finger.

247
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,333
You're here and this happened.

248
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,875
I have to inform the
doctor about this right away.

249
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,542
Hello! Doctor?

250
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,917
It's me, Pooja speaking.

251
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,458
About five minutes back,
Pradeep stood up all of a sudden.

252
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,917
All by himself.

253
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,125
I'm telling you again.

254
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,000
Just leave everything and come with me.

255
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:39,875
Won't you listen to me?

256
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,750
Let it go!

257
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,583
If you step in, you won't be
able to get over those memories.

258
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,125
That's why I'm here.

259
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:42,958
<i>Hello?</i>

260
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,542
Leela's room is locked.

261
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:45,875
I'm unable to open it.

262
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:46,875
I don't know about it.

263
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,125
It might be jammed
due to the lack of use.

264
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,125
Where's the key?

265
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,208
I agreed to everything you said
because you were so adamant.

266
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,875
<i>Now listen to me and
leave alone the room.</i>

267
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:56,792
Key!

268
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:57,958
Don't you hear me?

269
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,917
Why do you complicate
things unnecessarily?

270
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,958
<i>Be right there. I'm coming.</i>

271
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,542
<i>I want the key!</i>

272
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,000
When have you ever listened to me?

273
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,542
You need the key, right?

274
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,250
<i>It's over the fridge.
Get lost!</i>

275
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,667
Good morning.

276
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,292
I'm Selvam. Third attempt.

277
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,000
Selvam, it's me.

278
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,333
Teacher?

279
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,333
How come you are here?

280
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,625
You know I'm a
government employee, right?

281
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,167
That's how I'd enrolled
myself as a scribe.

282
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,667
You're lucky that I'm your
scribe for today's exam.

283
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,417
Have you prepared well?

284
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,458
Yeah, sort of.

285
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,083
"State any three characteristics
of electromagnetic waves?"

286
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:51,500
Lepton. No, it's neutron.

287
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,833
"What is the unit of--"

288
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:58,125
The rays are deflected
by an electric field…

289
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,958
"What is the ionization
energy of an atom?"

290
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:09,625
"Describe the principle, structure and
functioning of a tangent galvanometer?"

291
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,750
I don't know, teacher.

292
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,458
I don't remember properly.

293
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,667
Give it a try, Selvam.
This is the last question.

294
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,708
It carries ten marks.

295
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,833
You need to score at least
seven more marks to clear the exam.

296
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,458
I really don't remember, teacher.

297
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:34,042
Okay, listen to me.

298
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,500
You keep talking as if
you're giving me the answer.

299
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,125
And I will myself write the answer.
We don't have an option.

300
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,208
I can't do that.

301
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:41,667
It's not right.

302
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,958
Then you'll definitely fail.

303
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,250
That's alright.

304
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,375
I'm content with the marks I deserve.

305
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,417
Please don't do that.

306
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,417
Or else, there won't be
any difference between you…

307
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,167
and the cheats who hand
out paper to me as currency.

308
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,833
I did my best as a teacher, right?

309
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,250
Or at least, you
could've listened to me.

310
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,125
No one would have come to know about it.

311
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,833
You might have helped me now

312
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,042
but in the next exam…

313
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,000
I'll expect the same
from someone else.

314
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,042
This is not necessary.

315
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,708
It's okay to fail.

316
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,500
We can at least face it boldly.

317
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,458
But if we do something wrong…

318
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,042
the guilt will stare right at us.

319
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,292
Even if you look away.

320
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,750
My dad was a Brake Inspector
in the Traffic department.

321
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,875
He was an honest man like you.

322
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,792
We never got anything but just the salary.

323
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:56,208
One day, while I was on my
way to the college, he called me…

324
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:00,292
and asked if I could bring his
helmet that he'd left in my bike.

325
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,667
But I said that I was already late

326
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,708
and asked him to manage
without it for just that day.

327
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,792
He agreed to it and left.

328
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,375
But of all days, he met
with an accident on that day.

329
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:14,958
Head injury.

330
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,708
He died instantly.

331
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,083
I couldn't tell this to anyone
and suffered in silence.

332
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,375
But every time when
someone at the funeral said that…

333
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,667
my father would've been
alive if only he'd worn a helmet

334
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,542
my guilt killed me even more.

335
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:37,917
I finished college and got my
father's job on compassionate grounds.

336
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:42,000
Now everyday I go to his office,
and sit on the same seat he sat

337
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,917
only to be filled with
guilt that still haunts me.

338
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,375
You are right, Selvam.

339
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,875
We can run far from our mistakes.

340
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,417
But we can never escape them.

341
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:05,083
If you would ever want to
ask something to your father

342
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,083
what would it be?

343
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,667
<i>The number you're
calling is either switched off</i>

344
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,583
<i>or not reachable at the
moment. Please try later.</i>

345
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,958
How many times do I have to call you?

346
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:21,375
It has been switched off since morning.

347
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:22,833
I don't have a phone.

348
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,000
Since when?

349
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,667
It got damaged in the rain last week.

350
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,833
So what?

351
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,042
Does that mean you will not buy
a new phone?

352
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,333
Can't you keep your house clean?

353
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,583
It's such a mess.
Just like a dungeon.

354
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,417
Enough!

355
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,792
What's the occasion?

356
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,333
Why is your brother in town?

357
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,375
His friend is getting married.

358
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,667
He's come on a three days leave.

359
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,167
He was hell-bent on meeting you.

360
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,083
That's why, I had to bring him.

361
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,083
Oh.

362
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,708
What kind of a reaction is this?

363
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,167
Amid his busy schedule,
he made time to meet you.

364
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,167
But you didn't even
talk to him properly.

365
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,583
What's wrong with you?

366
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:09,958
Nothing's wrong with me.

367
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:10,917
I'm okay.

368
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,583
If that's the case, then why did you
walk away when he offered to wait?

369
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,917
How rude!

370
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,083
Look here, Vinod.

371
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,750
You've changed a lot
in the past eight months.

372
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,583
And we've grown apart.

373
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,667
I don't think it's working

374
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,625
At least, let's decide
the next step, Vinod.

375
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,417
There's immense pressure at home

376
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,417
and my dad…

377
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,292
How do I make you understand?

378
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,333
I really don't have--

379
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,583
What?

380
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,167
What happened?

381
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What happened?

382
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,750
Vinod!

383
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,792
Why are you behaving like this?

384
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,292
Vinod!

385
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,083
Who is it?

386
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:09,875
Tell me what it is!

387
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,125
Vinod?

388
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,417
What's wrong with you?

389
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,792
Don't move! Just stay still.

390
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,750
I need to see your feet.

391
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,708
-What?
-Didn't you hear me?

392
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,167
-Hey!
-Leave me!

393
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,333
Hey!

394
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,583
What are you doing, Vinod?
It's hurting! Leave me!

395
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,875
Vinod, leave me!

396
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:29,625
Leave me!

397
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,125
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

398
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,125
Have you gone nuts?

399
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,500
What have you become, Vinod?

400
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,583
I'm done with all this.

401
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,625
Go to hell!

402
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,833
I am already in hell!

403
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,167
Please open the gate.

404
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,125
What?

405
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,625
My office is inside.

406
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,500
Sir, I know nothing.
I'm newly appointed here.

407
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,792
Please call the office
for further details.

408
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,125
My clinic is inside.

409
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,083
I don't know, sir.

410
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,292
Please inquire at the office.

411
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,083
I've been meaning to
tell you at the right time.

412
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,167
After that incident…

413
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,417
the police had sealed off your clinic.

414
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,333
And later the building was sold as well.

415
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,042
They didn't even give a
proper eviction notice.

416
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,833
I heard that the new owner
wants to build a mall over there.

417
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,083
So, technically the
building is shut down now.

418
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,417
That means I have to find
a new place for the clinic.

419
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,042
We'll see about that later.

420
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,792
What you need right now, is rest.

421
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,542
No!

422
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,000
I need to start my practice.

423
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,833
My rehab and therapy is my practice.

424
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,000
Without that, I'll go mad.

425
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,125
Listen to me.

426
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,750
We need to submit an
evaluation report to the council

427
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,667
to prove that you're
physically and mentally fit.

428
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,458
Only then you can start practicing.

429
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,750
What's the problem in that?

430
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,208
Don't I look fine?

431
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:20,042
You look fine but you're not.

432
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,208
Or else, how would you've failed
to clear the evaluation thrice?

433
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,625
You don't remember it, right?

434
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,500
-May be… may be, the medicines.
-Whatever!

435
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,458
I'm telling you again.

436
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:34,708
Please understand.

437
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,250
You can't start practicing
without clearing the evaluation.

438
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,125
The Council is very clear.

439
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:45,458
I've sacrificed a lot for this career.

440
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,708
I had a late marriage and children.

441
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,250
I gave my best until now.

442
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,417
Is this what I get in return?

443
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,625
If they suspend me from practicing…

444
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,125
then I will not spare anyone!

445
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,833
Daddy, I'm leaving.

446
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,250
Yeah, okay.

447
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:12,917
I'm sorry.

448
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,875
-I lost my--
-See!

449
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:17,750
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

450
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,667
Have you ever reacted like this before?

451
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,750
Your mind is not in your control.

452
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,917
Be a little patient until
you clear the evaluation.

453
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,792
Just give it some time.

454
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:29,167
How's it possible?

455
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,125
You need to remember that you're
a patient and not a doctor.

456
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,208
Everything is possible.

457
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,500
This is all I could
retrieve from your clinic.

458
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,208
The investigation team and the
press had totally ransacked your clinic.

459
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,000
-Thanks.
-That's okay.

460
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,000
Remember what I said.

461
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,167
Next week we are
taking a trip to Ooty.

462
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,625
P.K will also join us there.

463
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,500
Take good rest. Bye.

464
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,458
Bye.

465
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,375
Selvam! Come with me.

466
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,292
Brother?

467
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,042
Your wait for a kidney donor is over.

468
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,500
Perfect match!

469
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,583
I was with the doctor
when he went through the file.

470
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,833
I checked with him and
struck a deal right away.

471
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:35,833
Thanks, bro.

472
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,750
If you could shell out 80,000 rupees,

473
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,583
then we'll make sure your name
gets to the top of that list.

474
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,250
The surgery will be done in the
next ten days. What do you think?

475
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,292
-How will I get the money?
-That's not my lookout

476
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,625
but get the money ready.

477
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,542
Listen to me.

478
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,917
You are already
undergoing dialysis twice a week.

479
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,167
Just think about the cost involved.

480
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,417
If you add that up for another six months,
it will be more than 80,000 rupees.

481
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,083
Do you think you'll last that long?

482
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,250
And soon you might have to
undergo dialysis everyday

483
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,333
and get admitted here.

484
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,292
Then, who's gonna pay your bills?

485
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,458
You'll be left alone to rot and die.

486
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,792
I'm trying to help you out of pity.

487
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,208
You better decide soon and
let me know by Wednesday.

488
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,417
Okay? See you.

489
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,958
There's no one who sees
the world better than you.

490
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,583
Your bills are due, Selvam.

491
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,917
I will clear that in a week's time.

492
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,875
Please make sure that you do it soon.

493
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,625
Plantain stem juice!

494
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:45,542
Have three glasses of juice
every day for a month

495
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,792
and you would've grown a new kidney.

496
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,042
It's a grave sin to go under the knife.

497
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,583
Did people get operated
thousand years ago?

498
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,958
Stay away from this sham.

499
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:03,958
Sir.

500
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,583
This is the one, right?

501
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,167
Exactly!

502
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,708
There was a Judgment in 1956

503
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,292
which is going to be
the base of my argument.

504
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,083
Good Lord.

505
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,458
Thanks, Selvam.

506
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,125
Sir.

507
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,167
Tell me, Selvam.

508
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,583
Do you remember what I told you
about my operation?

509
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,583
If I get around 80,000 rupees…

510
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:26,667
Sorry, Selvam.

511
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,292
I'm so broke that I don't
even have 80 rupees to fill fuel.

512
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,583
They've hiked the price by two rupees.

513
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,583
I think I'll have to walk
to the court everyday.

514
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,250
What will you do if you don't find me?

515
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:45,750
Will you search for me?

516
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:49,792
Have it.

517
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,000
Good shot!

518
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,875
I'm not mad at you but
just a bit worried for you.

519
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,375
I get it.

520
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,958
But you know what I've been through.

521
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:33,000
Don't you ever mention
Pradeep's name again.

522
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,542
He's a total psycho.

523
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,167
Even if you hadn't given him that
book, he would've found it.

524
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,500
You have to come out of this.

525
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:46,042
You need to forget everything and
become confident.

526
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,417
We can always get some help,
if you need it.

527
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,042
What do you mean?

528
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,042
A psychiatrist.

529
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,042
No.

530
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,042
I don't need it.

531
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,917
Please listen to me.

532
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,083
Psychiatrists are trustworthy.

533
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:01,083
You can trust them.

534
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,375
They can help you deal
with your fear and confusion.

535
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:09,292
You might even find
another side to yourself through them.

536
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,083
What do you mean?

537
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,542
What if you're a
cricket trainer by day

538
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,292
and a bloodhound at night

539
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,667
who calls random
people and kills them?

540
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,958
Hey, I'm just kidding.

541
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:25,292
Why are you so serious?

542
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:26,625
Look at you!

543
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,417
-<i>Hello!</i>
-Dr. Indran?

544
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,917
<i>Yeah, speaking.</i>

545
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,833
Doctor, I need…

546
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,417
an appointment…

547
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,833
for consultation.

548
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,042
Why? What's the issue?

549
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,208
Since the past few days, I have been
sensing a weird presence in my room.

550
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,500
I keep getting intrusive thoughts.

551
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,167
I become angry for no reason

552
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:50,833
and think of unwanted stuffs.

553
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,625
Sometimes, I lose control over myself.

554
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,750
I'm scared if things would
soon get out of hand.

555
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,333
Then, let's not waste time.

556
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:00,458
Let's start the consultation today itself.

557
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,417
Evening 8:00 p.m. at your place.

558
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,083
Please text me your address.

559
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,292
Sorry, doctor, I don't have a
cellphone. I only have a landline.

560
00:44:09,667 --> 00:44:11,708
Tell me your address. I'll note it down.

561
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:12,958
Vinod.

562
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,125
298, Jayalaxmi apartments

563
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,500
Anna Nagar, west

564
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:17,542
Chennai 101.

565
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:32,542
Hello!

566
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,792
Hello.

567
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:39,250
<i>You should've never given me that book.</i>

568
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,292
<i>That's where it all started!</i>

569
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:43,667
Pradeep?

570
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:49,042
<i>That's why, even the
end is coming for you.</i>

571
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:54,333
<i>Don't think that you
have hidden your trail.</i>

572
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:57,458
I know I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

573
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:02,958
<i>No matter where you run or
however hard you try to hide</i>

574
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,958
<i>you can never escape from this.</i>

575
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,625
Pradeep? Hello!

576
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,917
Please pick up.

577
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,125
Sir, number 297?

578
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:48,917
-It's the next door.
-But it's locked?

579
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:07,250
Here's 2,100 rupees.
Keep this for now.

580
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,625
I've been asking around.
So, don't lose hope.

581
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,458
I already owe you a lot.

582
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,292
I don't know how I'm
going to pay you back.

583
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:20,667
That's alright.
I wish I could give you more.

584
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,833
But wishing alone isn't enough, right?

585
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:25,417
How much more do you need?

586
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:27,250
Somewhere around…

587
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,417
75,000 rupees.

588
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,167
What shall we do?

589
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:35,875
If we had your father's
manuscripts, we could've made some money.

590
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:40,375
But I've destroyed them
and there's nothing left behind.

591
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,833
But how is it of any use anyway?

592
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,750
There was a publication that
wanted to publish them as a book.

593
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:48,958
They offered a large amount
but your dad didn't budge.

594
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,875
Even the owner kept pestering.

595
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,792
The publication was called Broadway.

596
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,292
It was in Triplicane.

597
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,208
Don't worry, Selvam.
We will find a way out.

598
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,542
-Selvam!
-Sir.

599
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,542
Aren't you leaving?

600
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,083
No, sir. I need to take a backup
of the journal entries.

601
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,125
I'll leave soon.

602
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,792
I have a wedding to attend.

603
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,542
I'm leaving. Be careful.

604
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,417
-Take care.
-Okay, sir.

605
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,333
Dear, light up the mosquito coil.

606
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,250
Okay, sir.

607
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,250
Come on, faster.

608
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,208
Hello!

609
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,417
Where have you been?

610
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,083
I've been trying to reach you all day

611
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:18,583
but your phone was busy.

612
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,875
Sorry. I just got back from coaching.

613
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,250
The receiver was not placed properly.

614
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,375
I called you this morning
at around 11:00 a.m.

615
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,458
The phone kept ringing but
no one attended the call.

616
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:32,167
I wasn't home.
I was at the hospital.

617
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,833
What happened?
Is Pradeep not feeling well?

618
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,042
Vinod.

619
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,708
Pradeep passed away this morning.

620
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,250
What are you saying?
Did he die?

621
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,917
How did this happen?

622
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,792
<i>It was around 10:15--</i>

623
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,375
I got a call exactly ten minutes after
I left for work.

624
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,375
<i>I was informed that
he jumped off the terrace.</i>

625
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,917
I always keep the doors locked.

626
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,250
<i>I don't know how he managed to get out.</i>

627
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,833
<i>What could've made him do so?</i>

628
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:07,208
Hello?

629
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,250
What time did it happen?

630
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,083
<i>It was at 10:15 a.m.</i>

631
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,792
Are you sure about it?
Can you please try and recall?

632
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,708
Vinod, is it something
that I would forget? Please!

633
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,208
Sorry, sister.

634
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,792
I'm too confused right now.

635
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,083
<i>It's okay.</i>

636
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,333
Do you have his phone book in your room?

637
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,583
I need his contacts to inform them
about his death.

638
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:29,583
<i>It's okay, sister.</i>

639
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,083
We used to share
the same phone book.

640
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,208
I know his handwriting.

641
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,917
I'll inform his contacts.

642
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,625
<i>Thanks, Vinod.</i>

643
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,708
Okay. Take care.

644
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:46,375
Hello!

645
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:49,458
Sir, I'm your batchmate
Pradeep's friend, Vinod.

646
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,792
I got your number
from his phone book.

647
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,458
There's a bad news.

648
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,833
Pradeep passed away this morning.

649
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,417
Around 10:15 a.m.

650
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,083
It was unexpected.
No one saw this coming.

651
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:01,958
Sure, ma'am.

652
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:03,375
I'll convey this to his sister.

653
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,083
Thank you, sir.

654
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,958
I don't have the exact details.
But it was an accident.

655
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:13,750
I met him recently and
he seemed absolutely fine.

656
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:48,542
Hello!

657
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,625
Hello?

658
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,083
<i>Tell me.</i>

659
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:57,250
Sir, I'm Pradeep's friend, Vinod.

660
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:00,125
I found your number in his phone book.

661
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,292
There's a bad news.

662
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,333
<i>What is it?</i>

663
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:07,500
<i>Did you call to say that
you're behind your friend's death.</i>

664
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:11,708
Hello, who's this?

665
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:16,375
<i>You think, you can hide your crime,
just like that piece of paper?</i>

666
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:18,792
How do you know about this?

667
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:22,417
<i>No matter how many pages you tear</i>

668
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,083
<i>but your name is etched
in every single page.</i>

669
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,417
Who are you?

670
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,625
<i>Open your door.</i>

671
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,542
Sorry, I'm late. Is the doctor here?

672
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,500
Hey.

673
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:22,833
Why are you here with the bat?

674
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,167
-What's happening?
-Nothing.

675
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,250
Did you see someone going this way?

676
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,250
No, I didn't.

677
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:29,833
Hey!

678
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,292
Did the doctor come or not?

679
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:33,625
No. I don't think he'll come.

680
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,292
How do you know that?
He might be stuck in traffic.

681
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:40,292
-He'll come. Let's wait.
-Not here. No!

682
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,083
Why?

683
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:43,583
I'll tell you.
It's a bit weird.

684
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:44,875
What if the doctor comes?

685
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,625
Doesn't matter.
Let's leave from here first.

686
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,333
-Hey, tell me!
-Come!

687
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,708
I don't get it.

688
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,500
You're saying that he
died around 10:00 a.m.

689
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:54,833
How will he call you at 11:00 a.m.?

690
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,000
Do you remember the exact time?

691
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,333
I was late to the coaching by an hour.

692
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,292
That's when I got the call.

693
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,792
How can this be possible?

694
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,583
I somehow feel…

695
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,792
you're imagining things.

696
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,458
How can someone
imagine to this extent?

697
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,125
Don't get me wrong.

698
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,833
There are so many stuffs like
hallucination, lucid dreaming and so on.

699
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,708
Did you really call the doctor?

700
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,167
If I didn't, how would I
get his appointment for 8:00 p.m.?

701
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,042
I was at your place on time
but he didn't show up.

702
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,167
You didn't allow me to call him as well.

703
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,750
Tell me honestly.

704
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,333
Is this all your imagination?

705
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,667
Won't you ever believe me?

706
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,125
Why don't you call
and check for yourself?

707
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,625
Fine! Give me the number.

708
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:39,875
Nine, eight, eight…

709
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,708
four, two…

710
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,333
eight, six, double two, nine.

711
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:46,917
Sorry.

712
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,375
Two, one, nine.

713
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,292
<i>The number you are
calling is either switched off</i>

714
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,125
<i>or out of network coverage area.
Please try later.</i>

715
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,708
It is not reachable.

716
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:07,458
Is this really his number?

717
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,708
Why do you doubt me?

718
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:13,667
I don't know if this
is all true or your imagination.

719
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,750
Then, what about the person,
who threatened me over phone?

720
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,833
Who's he? Is he also my imagination?

721
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,833
What if you'd really got
the doctor's appointment

722
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,625
and he is a character you
created to stop you from meeting him?

723
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,125
So, you're fully convinced
that I'm a total nutcase.

724
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,125
No! Not actually.

725
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:56,042
Doctor.

726
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,750
We never expected
that you'd ever come back.

727
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,083
If you'd informed us,
we would've come.

728
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:04,250
That's okay.

729
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:08,250
Since the clinic is under renovation,
I visit my patients at their place.

730
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,833
From now on, I will be coming on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:00 p.m.

731
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,458
I'll be here.

732
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:17,208
But considering
that you were in a coma

733
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,792
and that you might not practice again,

734
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:22,708
we've already started
consulting another doctor.

735
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:25,792
He is not as renowned as you
but he's also quite competent.

736
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,750
The waiting time is less
and fees is also affordable.

737
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:33,208
If my fees is your
concern, I can even waive it.

738
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:36,417
My practice and my patients
are more important to me.

739
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,917
But doctor, how could we
just switch over like that?

740
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,583
Besides, there's a lot of
improvement after visiting him.

741
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,542
-He even walks without--
-Coffee?

742
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,292
I just can't believe this, doctor.

743
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,458
How is it possible in one day?

744
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,792
It has the exact amount of sugar
that I would prefer.

745
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:32,375
He used to make such a coffee
when we were newly married.

746
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,000
It was around 20 years ago.

747
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,000
But…

748
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:41,000
how does he remember it now?

749
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,083
Memory!

750
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
It's a monster.

751
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:46,458
There are ways to unleash it.

752
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,375
Most importantly…

753
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,750
it should be handled only by
the person who can control it.

754
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:55,167
Well we're done with the first session.

755
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,792
Just wait until the
end of seven sessions.

756
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,500
There will be remarkable changes.

757
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,000
You'll see it.

758
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,167
No one reads books these days.

759
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,250
The only book in demand
today is <i>Facebook</i>.

760
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,917
With the advent of internet and stuffs,

761
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
we've even tried printing porn.
But no one bought them.

762
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:22,917
Imagine the plight of
ghosts and paranormal stuff.

763
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,917
20 years ago, I'd approached your father
when these stuffs were popular.

764
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,792
Had he accepted, we could've
made some quick bucks.

765
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,333
He refused to it.

766
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:35,917
Poor guy met his doom. He lost his
house and suffered a tragic death.

767
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,375
The house is still there.

768
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,208
I still live there.

769
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:44,333
The one in Royapettah?

770
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:45,875
Yes, sir.

771
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,083
Good Lord! Isn't it worth millions?

772
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,542
What are you doing here
with this worthless junk?

773
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,000
The house is the only thing
I have in my father's memory.

774
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:58,375
Many wanted to buy at the cost
I demanded for.

775
00:59:58,833 --> 00:59:59,875
But I refused.

776
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,167
So, what do you do for a living?

777
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,458
I'm a clerk in the government library.

778
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,292
Aren't you interested
in your father's field of work?

779
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,417
It's not that, sir.

780
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,208
At times, I act as a medium.

781
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,250
Oh.

782
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:13,667
So, can you communicate with the souls?

783
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,375
Impressive!

784
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:19,417
I have a task for you.
Let me know if you're interested.

785
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:25,083
One of my friends wanted to build
a shopping mall in downtown

786
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,542
and bought an old building.

787
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:30,375
Only after buying, he realized there's
some sort of a presence in there.

788
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,500
It's haunted.

789
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:36,833
He was spooked by an occultist who ranted
about vengeful spirits and demons.

790
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:39,833
He hired few exorcists
to purge the building.

791
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:40,958
But nothing worked out.

792
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:44,542
If you can do this,
then he will pay you 1,00,000 rupees.

793
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:46,875
I'll surely try, sir.

794
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:50,083
I can't rely on that.
Have you ever done something like this?

795
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,583
I haven't, but as a kid I've
accompanied my father many times.

796
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,042
Are you a novice?

797
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:59,958
You know nothing about darkness.

798
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,667
I've known nothing, but darkness.

799
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:07,833
I'll handle it.

800
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,542
Sir, I think this book might be in
the second rack of the upper deck.

801
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,750
The clerk hasn't turned up today.

802
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:19,042
Either come tomorrow
or try finding it yourself.

803
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,292
Please!

804
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,500
Okay, sir, thank you.

805
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,958
Sir, please leave the bag and go.

806
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,250
Selvam, you said you wanted a day off.

807
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,000
But you're here already!

808
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,458
I got done with my work.

809
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:38,958
-That's why, I came in.
-Thank God, Selvam.

810
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,292
There's been tons of returns today.

811
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,583
I was struggling to do it manually.

812
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,542
I am not a computer savvy like you.

813
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:48,208
So, what's with the bag?

814
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,375
It's just books

815
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,083
-for my evening class.
-Okay.

816
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:00,375
Did you find the book, sir?

817
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,000
No, sir. I didn't.

818
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,583
Come tomorrow.
I'll keep it ready for you.

819
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:06,000
What book, sir?

820
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:09,208
-It's a Leo Tolstoy's book.
-Oh!

821
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,292
It's a good book.

822
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,042
-But it's name--
-Is it <i>War and Peace</i>?

823
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,083
Am I that dumb?

824
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,667
What about <i>Anna Karenina</i>?

825
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,042
It's just a single word.
What was its name?

826
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:20,625
<i>Devil</i>?

827
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,833
Yes! That's the one.

828
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,042
How did I forget that?

829
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Hello?

830
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,583
Hello, who's this?

831
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,375
<i>Are you sure you want to know?</i>

832
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,958
Yes. Who the hell are you?

833
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:53,167
<i>I was a human like you.</i>

834
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,208
<i>But now, I'm not.</i>

835
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:56,792
Don't you have a name?

836
01:02:56,875 --> 01:03:00,500
<i>I had a name but not anymore.</i>

837
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,833
Is that why you annoy me to death?

838
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:05,792
<i>I haven't done anything to you yet.</i>

839
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,875
Listen. I don't know who you are.

840
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,750
You aren't telling me as well.

841
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:15,708
Either you're deliberately
pulling a prank on me.

842
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,792
Or a psycho, calling random
numbers and torturing them.

843
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:23,375
<i>Doesn't matter. But you're
my right pick for a wrong guy.</i>

844
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:25,167
What do you want?

845
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,417
<i>I want to talk</i>

846
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,792
<i>that too with the soul
of a weakling like you.</i>

847
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,625
Am I a weakling? What nonsense!

848
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,208
<i>Yes. You are a weakling.</i>

849
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:37,542
That's okay. Let me be.

850
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:39,667
<i>I won't.</i>

851
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,042
<i>Not until I free your wonderful
soul from your frail cage of a body.</i>

852
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,958
Hey, are you crazy?

853
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:49,917
Reciting lines from some stupid soap!

854
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,500
<i>You might've heard
your soul recite the same everyday.</i>

855
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,792
<i>But today for the first time,
you're hearing it in my voice.</i>

856
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:03,500
<i>The right to bind your soul and
control it, is not yours anymore.</i>

857
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,875
Who are you to say this?

858
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,667
<i>I'm your soul's representative.</i>

859
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,875
<i>Gone are the days when your
soul begged you for freedom.</i>

860
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:12,958
<i>Henceforth, I'll be
talking to you on its behalf.</i>

861
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:18,583
<i>And I will not stop until your
soul is set free from it's weak cage.</i>

862
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:21,625
You think you're invincible?
I have your number.

863
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:24,708
The cyber cell would track you in seconds.

864
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:28,750
Do you think you are man enough
just because

865
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:32,167
you crouch in a dark corner of a dirty
room and talk to strangers in riddles?

866
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:35,750
<i>Add a defunct green
refrigerator to your description.</i>

867
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:17,250
Yeah, that's right.

868
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:25,917
Hey.

869
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,292
This way.

870
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,542
Careful, dear.

871
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:32,542
Okay, I've got to call you back.

872
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,458
Hey, take him to the room.

873
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:47,500
Okay, sir.

874
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:50,708
Be careful.
There's a staircase.

875
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,250
Hey! Who the hell is he?

876
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,875
Why him of all people?

877
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,417
Do you think the spirit is going
to show mercy on the blind boy?

878
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,292
Sir, don't judge him by his looks.

879
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:22,917
His father used to be an expert occultist.

880
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,167
He even crossed the high
seas to cast out a white devil.

881
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,917
Trust me. He'll surely do it.

882
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Are you nuts?

883
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,875
Do you remember what happened
to the others who came here?

884
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:33,000
Despite bribing the cops and press,

885
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,250
it took six months for me
to hush up things.

886
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,917
Who will be answerable
if something goes wrong?

887
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:39,542
Will you?

888
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,042
So what?

889
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Do we hold a funeral if a dog
gets killed in an accident?

890
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:45,125
Don't we run over the
carcass and move ahead?

891
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:48,083
Nobody's going to be bothered
about him. Let him try.

892
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,250
What are we going to lose?

893
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,750
I have lost 5,00,000 rupees until now.

894
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,208
We'll pay that only if the job is done.

895
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:55,375
But, you took your
share beforehand, right?

896
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,292
Sir!

897
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,875
That's why you're inside
the car with the AC on

898
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,208
while I am serving you
under the scorching sun.

899
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,083
Hello!

900
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,000
I've pressed the button.

901
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,417
You just have to go
inside and close the door.

902
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,583
The lift will automatically
take you to the sixth floor.

903
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:49,208
Go straight. You have to go
to the last room.

904
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,083
Here is the room key.

905
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,292
-Hello.
-I am here at a place.

906
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,625
Can you call me exactly in seven
minutes without any questions?

907
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,500
Where? Whose number?

908
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,333
I'll tell you.
Note down the number.

909
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:29,708
Okay, tell me.

910
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:30,833
Two, four, two, two…

911
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,458
-Okay.
-four, four, nine, two.

912
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,042
Call me exactly in seven minutes.

913
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:36,458
Okay, I will.

914
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:25,542
I know there's someone out here.

915
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,292
But you're not supposed to be here.

916
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,042
You know that as well.

917
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,167
If you're trapped here…

918
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,917
or dwell here…

919
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:42,167
then I'm here to pacify you
and to set you free.

920
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:01,250
If you trust me and have
the desire to free yourself…

921
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:05,458
then stand on this chakra
and reveal your presence.

922
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:26,417
I asked you to call me!
Why didn't you call me?

923
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:28,583
I specifically asked you
to call me in seven minutes.

924
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:30,792
I did call to that number.
Whose number is that?

925
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,000
Why? What happened?

926
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,542
Someone spoke over the phone and
said you're in some sort of a danger.

927
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,708
What's all this?

928
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:37,667
<i>What's happening, Vinod?</i>

929
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,667
<i>Vinod?</i>

930
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,208
-I'll call you later.
-<i>Hello?</i>

931
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,333
Oh.

932
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:22,875
So, there's one more of you.

933
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:24,875
I'm here to--

934
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,917
Hey, go and open the gate!

935
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,042
Go and get the car!
Shut down the power!

936
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,667
No one can be here.
Go!

937
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,292
Wait, I'll call you.

938
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:55,125
It's me.
What happened?

939
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,833
I couldn't do it.

940
01:15:58,542 --> 01:15:59,583
I need some more time.

941
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,125
Careful.

942
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:06,125
Here, take this.

943
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:08,875
Get some medicines.
I'll call you later.

944
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:21,875
Why did you step
out of your car, sir?

945
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:25,250
Did you see that?
He hardly lasted for ten minutes.

946
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,167
What sort of an exorcist is he?

947
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:33,292
Sir, do you remember that Nambhoodri with
30 years of experience from Kerala?

948
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:36,000
He went inside with a magical
scroll, with spells cast for 144 days.

949
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:39,333
But we just found
the scroll in the end, right?

950
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:42,417
It took us a day to scrape
out his body from that wall.

951
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,000
But this boy has
come out alive, right?

952
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:47,250
He's promised to be back.
He will! Trust me.

953
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:04,208
<i>Sir, do you remember that Nambhoodri with
30 years of experience from Kerala?</i>

954
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:06,750
<i>But we just found
the scroll in the end, right?</i>

955
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,542
Thank you for letting me into your mind.

956
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,750
Human mind, a labyrinth of mysteries.

957
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,708
Things you can see, hear
and feel are alien to this society.

958
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:33,000
That's why people consider you crazy.

959
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:36,958
But every day, I enter your
mind and people call me…

960
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,167
doctor.

961
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,792
There's nothing wrong with you.

962
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,875
In other words, there's
nothing right with them.

963
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,500
This society that pretends
and camouflages by the minute

964
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:52,042
and considers money, fame, and
women as the only source of happiness

965
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,083
has no answer for your
joy, that needs no source.

966
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,042
Yet, it brands you as
crazy, insane, unstable

967
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,917
and crushes you through humiliation.

968
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,250
It's foolish to expect them
to be fair and understanding

969
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:07,625
because the sole reason the
world invented the sixth sense

970
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,292
is to just put up a facade.

971
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:14,500
This mob that hides its body in
robes and identity under masks

972
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:18,125
perceives you as mere
animals that need to be chained.

973
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:24,292
But what they've forgotten is the history,
when these animals used to rule the world.

974
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,667
You need a world that respects you

975
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,125
does not humiliate you

976
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,125
and alienate you.

977
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,292
A world where there is balance.

978
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:38,167
The world that sees your scribblings as
paintings and setbacks as achievement

979
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:43,083
is the perfect last page that makes all
the other pages of your life, meaningful.

980
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:50,042
That's where I am going to take
you all, by breaking your shackles.

981
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,500
Not one after another

982
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,208
but all at the same time.

983
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:56,375
For that, you need to be patient

984
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,167
and follow my command.

985
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,333
From now on, you have to
stop worrying about this world

986
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:05,167
and be mindful of the
honor and joy that await you.

987
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:09,208
If you do so, I'll take
you to that world real soon.

988
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:10,458
Trust me!

989
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,708
You're in for a
journey of a life time.

990
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,708
<i>This is Chepauk railway station.</i>

991
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,042
<i>Selvam!</i>

992
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:15,792
<i>The solution to all your
problem is chasing you in a bottle.</i>

993
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:17,208
<i>Be careful.</i>

994
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:25,792
<i>The solution to all your problems is
chasing you in a bottle. Be careful.</i>

995
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:38,458
<i>The solution to all your problems--</i>

996
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:41,417
<i>Selvam!</i>

997
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:45,958
<i>The solution to all your
problems is chasing you in a bottle.</i>

998
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,250
<i>Be careful.</i>

999
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:46,333
Hello?

1000
01:22:46,417 --> 01:22:49,875
<i>You seem to be very
inquisitive to know about me.</i>

1001
01:22:49,958 --> 01:22:52,875
How does it matter to me?
Stop calling me.

1002
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:55,333
<i>Then stop knocking on wrong doors.</i>

1003
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,667
What are you talking about?

1004
01:22:58,458 --> 01:22:59,458
I didn't go anywhere.

1005
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:03,750
<i>Then what were you doing
climbing up the ladder and peeping in?</i>

1006
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,292
I went there to convey
my friend's death news.

1007
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,875
-I tried to reach the--
-<i>Listen to me.</i>

1008
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:12,917
<i>Don't think I'd keep calm,
and let you do whatever.</i>

1009
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:16,667
Okay.

1010
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,167
Henceforth, I'll not bother you
and you will also stop calling me.

1011
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:22,750
Let's end this here. Okay?

1012
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:27,750
<i>Why do you sound so low today?</i>

1013
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:29,917
<i>This is my first breakthrough.</i>

1014
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,083
Why do you torture me?
What have I done to you?

1015
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,042
<i>Didn't I tell you yesterday itself?</i>

1016
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:38,333
<i>I'm here to liberate
your soul from your weak--</i>

1017
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:40,000
Hello!

1018
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,875
<i>Why did you disconnect
the call, you coward?</i>

1019
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,500
I'm not a coward.

1020
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,083
The call got disconnected.

1021
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:57,417
<i>Then why are you trying
to hide behind that book?</i>

1022
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,500
I'm not hiding from anyone.

1023
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:07,125
This is not a normal book.

1024
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,042
<i>It might mean anything to you.</i>

1025
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:13,625
<i>But to me, it's just a
book with 1266 pages.</i>

1026
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:14,833
<i>That's it.</i>

1027
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:19,958
<i>Like any other book
this one has a last page.</i>

1028
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:23,875
<i>You can try and hide behind it</i>

1029
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:26,875
<i>but what will you do
when you run out of pages?</i>

1030
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,333
If you're man enough,
then why did you end the call?

1031
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:32,833
Hello, chief!

1032
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:34,583
Sorry. Have you been waiting for long?

1033
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:36,375
No. I just came in.

1034
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:38,708
So, how are you?

1035
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,000
I expected you last week.

1036
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:42,667
You missed your session, chief.

1037
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,125
Yeah I was a bit busy.

1038
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:49,250
I was trying to be away from everything
just the way you told me.

1039
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,083
I think Dr. Vasanth would've told you.

1040
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:53,583
As you might know chief, the council--

1041
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,042
I need to start my practice.

1042
01:26:57,708 --> 01:27:00,458
There's nothing you don't know.
The council is very strict.

1043
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:02,083
They will not change their decision.

1044
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,667
But I don't care about them.

1045
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,167
How can you say so, chief?

1046
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:09,208
I even exempted you from counseling
and directly gave you the questionnaire.

1047
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,375
Not once, but thrice.
But you didn't clear it.

1048
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,750
Then I even tried entering
your subconscious mind

1049
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:18,708
but that didn't work as well.
You're too strong, chief.

1050
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:22,833
Then concede defeat and
clear my evaluation report.

1051
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:24,833
It's not my fault.

1052
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:27,750
A patient's cooperation is
crucial in the healing process.

1053
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,708
But you still behave more like a
doctor than a patient.

1054
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:34,167
Now you've accepted that I
am a doctor and not a patient.

1055
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,167
You're too good, chief.

1056
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:38,875
But if you attend just two more sessions

1057
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,125
I'll surely enter your mind,
no matter what.

1058
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:45,625
I'm telling for your own good. Don't!

1059
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,208
Do you think I can't?

1060
01:27:49,042 --> 01:27:50,417
I'm saying you shouldn't.

1061
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:55,833
When was the last
time you visited a zoo?

1062
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,042
While I did my Master's in the U.S.

1063
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,958
The Columbus zoo. Why?

1064
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:05,583
Were there any tigers?

1065
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:07,958
Yes.

1066
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:10,583
There were seven or eight
of them inside a big cage.

1067
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:13,958
What did you see when
you looked into the cage?

1068
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:16,125
What else? Tigers, of course.

1069
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,417
What did you look like to the tigers?

1070
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:23,333
How else would I look?
Just like any other person.

1071
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:25,750
Now imagine!

1072
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,667
You're inside the tiger's cage.

1073
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,375
What would you see now?

1074
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:33,125
Obviously, tigers.

1075
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:38,083
And how would you
look like to the tigers now?

1076
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:46,708
<i>Doctor, your lunch is ready.</i>

1077
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:49,250
I'll call you.

1078
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,708
That was a wild one, chief.

1079
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:55,500
I didn't see it coming.

1080
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,708
Now, let's turn the tables.

1081
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:04,667
If you were inside the tiger's cage,
how else would you appear to them?

1082
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,167
Master!

1083
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:19,583
Please take everything
and get out of my sight.

1084
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,667
How many times I've told
you not to get into this stuff?

1085
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,208
How did you get this book?

1086
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:28,333
You only said that we could
sell my father's book.

1087
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:29,708
That was just a thought!

1088
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:32,208
But why do you want
to know what's inside?

1089
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:34,208
Have you forgotten all that's
happened to your dad and me?

1090
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:37,167
He lost everything and died. And I--

1091
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,417
I'm made a scapegoat for someone's crime.

1092
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,417
And I can't even use my real name.

1093
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,875
I rot here in this run
down theater, doing nothing!

1094
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:44,583
I thought you were sweeping, Uncle.

1095
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:46,125
Oh, you think it's funny?

1096
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:48,500
I'm telling you again.
Don't get into all this.

1097
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,875
Your life will become a mess if
you try to know what's inside the book.

1098
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,125
I don't have an option, Uncle.

1099
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,500
I have to go through
this suffering and die.

1100
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,708
I'd say that's a better option.

1101
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:11,083
Go! You're adamant just like your dad.

1102
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:12,458
That's why you pay
no heed to my words.

1103
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:19,500
Hey, fool!

1104
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:21,042
Since you've decided to die…

1105
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:23,250
come and have a meal at my place.

1106
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,458
Selvam, don't think
I'm being unreasonable.

1107
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,750
I am actually worried for you.

1108
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,833
You might not realize it now.

1109
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:35,875
But, trust me…

1110
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:38,333
there's nothing worth
seeing in this world right now.

1111
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:40,833
You might not understand now but someday

1112
01:30:40,917 --> 01:30:43,250
you'll realize.

1113
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,500
This is just the same.

1114
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:49,792
Though it looks like a
blessing, but it's a curse.

1115
01:30:50,542 --> 01:30:51,417
You don't need this.

1116
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:57,625
Uncle!

1117
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:02,667
If I don't go back home today, I
have no one to look out for me.

1118
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,500
Even if something happens to me,
there's no one who'd be bothered.

1119
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:11,333
Despite all this, do you
know why I want to live?

1120
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,792
A son's duty is to take care of
his parents during their old age.

1121
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:20,833
But I have none.

1122
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:24,750
The least I could do is to
protect the house they lived in.

1123
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,333
For that, I have to
somehow manage to live on.

1124
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,500
Despite eating what you've cooked.

1125
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,333
Passport or full size, sir?

1126
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,458
Maxi.

1127
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:15,083
Chin down, please.

1128
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,833
A little to your left.
A little. Okay.

1129
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,625
Just a second.

1130
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:27,583
Chin up!

1131
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:29,958
Okay.

1132
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,458
When can I collect the photo?

1133
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:33,333
It will be ready in about 30 minutes.

1134
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:02,625
Won't you even pick up the newspapers?

1135
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:13,917
How would I know?
I hardly step out of the house.

1136
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,708
But Harish told me that
you visited him recently.

1137
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,750
Yeah. But, that was a few days back.

1138
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,292
-I would've come along with you.
-I didn't want to disturb you.

1139
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:25,125
Anyway, there's only
two more sessions left

1140
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:29,625
-and the evaluation will be done.
-Alright. Coming to the point.

1141
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:32,167
Did you decide anything
about the Ooty trip?

1142
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:34,208
You think I need a vacation?

1143
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:36,958
I'm already on one.

1144
01:33:37,417 --> 01:33:38,875
-Drink?
-No, I have to drive.

1145
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:43,750
Hello!

1146
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:46,542
<i>Hello, doctor.
It's me Pooja.</i>

1147
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:49,917
<i>Pradeep stood up about five minutes back</i>

1148
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,083
<i>all by himself!</i>

1149
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,708
<i>I just don't know how.</i>

1150
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:55,208
<i>Doctor, can you please come immediately?</i>

1151
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:58,250
<i>It'd be great if you
could check on him now.</i>

1152
01:33:58,667 --> 01:33:59,625
Okay.

1153
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:01,875
Who's it?

1154
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:03,500
The insurance company.

1155
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:08,000
They need clarification on few bills.
Asked me to mail them.

1156
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,375
Okay.

1157
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,625
I stopped by to give you this.

1158
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,292
Kavitha has cooked for you.

1159
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,542
Have it.

1160
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:17,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

1161
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:42,125
Try visiting often, Vinod.
Pradeep will feel a lot better.

1162
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:43,417
Sure, I will.

1163
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,208
Hello, doctor. Good evening.

1164
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:48,375
Thanks for coming
in such a short notice.

1165
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,125
It's okay. Not a problem.

1166
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:54,333
This is Vinod.
He is Pradeep's schoolmate.

1167
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:55,333
He's come to visit him.

1168
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:56,250
-Hi.
-Hello!

1169
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:59,000
In fact, I think Pradeep's
got all excited on seeing him.

1170
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:01,625
Interesting!

1171
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:04,792
Doctor, please go in.
Pradeep is in his room.

1172
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:07,167
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Alright, bye!

1173
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:17,208
-What's wrong with his voice?
-Didn't I tell you?

1174
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:18,375
No.

1175
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:21,667
He was shot by his own patient.
It's a horrible story.

1176
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:25,083
-Shot him?
-Poor guy. His whole family got wiped out.

1177
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:26,583
When did this happen?

1178
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:30,583
About a year back.
It was all over the papers.

1179
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:31,708
Sad.

1180
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:38,083
-From this book?
-Yes.

1181
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:41,167
-It seems very old, Selvam.
-Yes. It belongs to my father.

1182
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:42,625
<i>Yaksha Thandhiram.</i>

1183
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:44,333
Which page in this?

1184
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:46,542
It's somewhere in the middle.

1185
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:51,375
There's an image of a chakra.
Is it from there?

1186
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,417
Please go to the next page.

1187
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,917
There's a goat-like image.

1188
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,417
-Yes, that's the one.
-Okay.

1189
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,167
And the next four pages after this.

1190
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,083
Is it urgent?

1191
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:04,458
Absolutely.

1192
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,958
Hey, somebody dropped this for you.

1193
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:56,667
Hello! I heard that you require a room.

1194
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:58,292
It's a 400 square feet flat.

1195
01:36:58,375 --> 01:36:59,958
It's a small room, but it
can accommodate two.

1196
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:01,917
There's no extra cot, sir.

1197
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,875
Hello?

1198
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:11,750
<i>It's a tug-of-war</i>

1199
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:15,708
<i>That we play within</i>

1200
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:17,583
This is the one.

1201
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:19,792
No, sir. There's no covered car parking.

1202
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:21,875
Sir, North facing?

1203
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:24,708
I don't know, sir.
I've to check and find out.

1204
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:26,583
Sir, pets?

1205
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,708
I've no problem
with your food habits.

1206
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,042
There's no air-conditioner.
But there's a ghost to give you chills!

1207
01:38:02,958 --> 01:38:05,083
I don't think the candidate
is going to turn up now.

1208
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:06,958
You may leave if you wish.

1209
01:38:07,042 --> 01:38:08,917
It's okay, sir.
I'll wait for a while.

1210
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,167
Okay.

1211
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:28,083
<i>The door shuts down but the cold rushes in</i>

1212
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:33,458
<i>He knows the poles of new moon
And never misses his mark</i>

1213
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:39,750
<i>In the flicker of the dying light</i>

1214
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:44,667
<i>He emerges out of the dark</i>

1215
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:50,750
<i>Will he come?</i>

1216
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:56,458
<i>Will he come?</i>

1217
01:38:56,542 --> 01:39:02,333
<i>Will he come?</i>

1218
01:39:02,417 --> 01:39:07,125
<i>It's only time he drops his guise</i>

1219
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:12,333
<i>As I await with gazing eyes</i>

1220
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,292
<i>The time is running out</i>

1221
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:25,125
<i>And darkness is his clout</i>

1222
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:31,208
<i>It's only time he drops his guise</i>

1223
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:36,625
<i>As I await with gazing eyes</i>

1224
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:42,792
<i>The time is running out</i>

1225
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:48,583
<i>And darkness is his clout</i>

1226
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:05,250
Hi, I'm Dr. Vasanth

1227
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:08,125
I am Dr. Indran's friend.

1228
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:10,250
I'm here for an evaluation.

1229
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,125
Can I please take a few minutes of yours?

1230
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:15,500
-Sure, please come in.
-Thank you.

1231
01:40:20,083 --> 01:40:21,917
How is the patient related--

1232
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,833
Okay.

1233
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,792
How long have you been
consulting with Dr. Indran?

1234
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,833
About two years back

1235
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:30,375
we had consulted him
for my brother's depression.

1236
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,750
His condition improved

1237
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,208
and he got better.

1238
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:36,750
But eight months ago,
when he became like this

1239
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:38,708
we once again tried reaching the doctor.

1240
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:41,875
Only then we got to know about
the incident and his hospitalization.

1241
01:40:42,333 --> 01:40:45,583
But ten days back

1242
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:47,250
he called up and came to our house.

1243
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,417
Like a Godsent.

1244
01:40:49,917 --> 01:40:51,792
There's a lot of improvement now.

1245
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:53,250
How many sessions has he completed?

1246
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,625
Four, including today.

1247
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:57,708
Do you see any improvement
after these four sessions?

1248
01:40:57,792 --> 01:40:58,833
Definitely!

1249
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:01,208
Earlier, he used to scream a lot.

1250
01:41:01,292 --> 01:41:04,125
It would be hard to control
him but not anymore.

1251
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:05,500
He's become very calm now.

1252
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,292
I just hope he gets better.

1253
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:10,000
Okay.

1254
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:17,833
Hello?

1255
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:42,625
I know you're
using my fear to confuse me.

1256
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:46,208
If the phone came forward, it
might be due to a loose screw.

1257
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:48,208
I might've forgotten,
finishing the card castle.

1258
01:42:48,292 --> 01:42:49,583
How can you claim it's your work?

1259
01:42:49,958 --> 01:42:51,542
You're just feeding on my fear.

1260
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:54,833
If you're all that powerful, tell
me what card I've got in my pocket.

1261
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:56,958
<i>Are you testing me?</i>

1262
01:42:57,042 --> 01:42:59,208
Cut to the chase and
answer me, you fraud.

1263
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:00,917
<i>I might even be a fraud</i>

1264
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,792
<i>but never a joker like you.</i>

1265
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:07,417
I knew that you'll come
up with some nonsense.

1266
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,583
Now I clearly know who you are.

1267
01:43:09,667 --> 01:43:11,417
<i>Check the card</i>

1268
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:14,042
<i>and you'll know who you are.</i>

1269
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:14,667
Hey, Manasi.

1270
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:17,083
I sent you a photo, right?
Can you tell me what card I was holding?

1271
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:20,167
Are you nuts to call me
at midnight to ask this?

1272
01:44:20,833 --> 01:44:22,000
<i>It was a joker.</i>

1273
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,958
Don't lie to me.

1274
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:28,208
It was eight of spades, right?

1275
01:44:28,292 --> 01:44:30,208
<i>Why do you call me if
you don't believe me?</i>

1276
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:32,083
The card was of a joker.

1277
01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:34,708
<i>But if you'll spare me the
pain, I'll go with eight of spades.</i>

1278
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:27,250
-Enough, please!
-<i>Hello?</i>

1279
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:30,958
-<i>Who's this? Hello?</i>
-Please leave me alone.

1280
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:35,708
-I agree that I am I'm nothing.
-<i>Hello, sir!</i>

1281
01:47:35,792 --> 01:47:38,042
<i>What do you want, sir?
Who are you?</i>

1282
01:47:39,583 --> 01:47:41,542
-Who are you?
-<i>My name is Manoj, sir.</i>

1283
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:44,417
<i>Have you ever been to the recharge
shop near Meenakshi college?</i>

1284
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,708
<i>I work there.</i>

1285
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:49,375
I don't know.

1286
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,458
<i>Then you might've dialed wrongly.</i>

1287
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:52,542
No.

1288
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I need to know who you are.

1289
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:57,583
Please give me your number.

1290
01:47:57,667 --> 01:48:00,167
<i>Why do you need my number?</i>

1291
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:02,500
<i>Besides, if you want to
talk, can't you talk now?</i>

1292
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:03,792
No.

1293
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:06,375
Not on this phone.

1294
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,167
I'll call you myself.

1295
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:14,042
My whole life depends on you.
Please help me.

1296
01:48:14,667 --> 01:48:17,208
<i>Sir, honestly I don't
understand what you're saying.</i>

1297
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:19,750
<i>Alright, anyway</i>

1298
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:21,833
<i>please note down my number.</i>

1299
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:23,792
-<i>Ninety, eight…</i>
-Just one second.

1300
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:26,792
<i>Ninety, eight…</i>

1301
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,583
<i>This is my number.</i>

1302
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:45,500
Thanks.

1303
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:48,792
I'll call you tomorrow.

1304
01:48:49,917 --> 01:48:50,958
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

1305
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,458
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

1306
01:49:12,417 --> 01:49:13,542
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Hello!

1307
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:14,792
Sir, it's me, Selvam.

1308
01:49:15,625 --> 01:49:17,417
I've completed the task successfully.

1309
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,458
What are you saying?

1310
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:20,167
Are you sure?

1311
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:23,083
Yes, sir. You can
even have it checked.

1312
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:24,208
Just hold on for a second.

1313
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:31,667
The boy says he's cleansed the place.
Get it checked.

1314
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:34,333
So, where are you right now?

1315
01:49:34,417 --> 01:49:36,792
I'm in the by-lane next
to Saravana Theater.

1316
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:39,667
Just wait there.
My guys will pick you in ten.

1317
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,833
<i>Sir, shall I wait inside the theater?</i>

1318
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:43,333
It will be easy for them to spot me.

1319
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:46,417
<i>Alright. Wait there and don't go anywhere.</i>

1320
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,000
-<i>See you soon.</i>
-Okay, sir.

1321
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:11,500
Is this how you hold the tape?

1322
01:50:14,833 --> 01:50:16,458
-Yeah, tell me.
-<i>The dog is calm.</i>

1323
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:18,333
Looks like the place is clear.

1324
01:50:18,417 --> 01:50:22,167
Treat the dog to a few biscuits and
buy a sweet box for the owner.

1325
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:23,250
Sure.

1326
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:24,625
Rocky! Come on.

1327
01:50:37,583 --> 01:50:38,583
Uncle!

1328
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:41,417
Uncle!

1329
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:46,500
Uncle!

1330
01:50:53,583 --> 01:50:54,458
Hello?

1331
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:55,792
Uncle, where are you?

1332
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:57,792
I'm at the market for some work.

1333
01:50:58,167 --> 01:51:00,333
<i>You're at the theater, right?
I'm running late.</i>

1334
01:51:00,917 --> 01:51:02,583
<i>Open the counter and
start issuing tickets.</i>

1335
01:51:02,667 --> 01:51:04,458
-<i>I'll join you soon.</i>
-How long will you take, Uncle?

1336
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:05,667
I will be back.
What's the matter?

1337
01:51:06,542 --> 01:51:07,542
Uncle…

1338
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:09,333
I…

1339
01:51:09,417 --> 01:51:10,833
I've caught it.

1340
01:51:11,917 --> 01:51:12,750
Caught what?

1341
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,792
The one I told you about the other day.

1342
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:18,042
I've caught that in a bottle.

1343
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:20,833
Bottle? How did you do that?

1344
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:24,583
I found the technique
in the book I bought.

1345
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:25,958
Are you out of your mind?

1346
01:51:26,042 --> 01:51:27,917
I asked you to not do such a thing!

1347
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,792
<i>But you never listen to me!</i>

1348
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:31,042
Where did you bury it?

1349
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:33,708
Bury?

1350
01:51:34,542 --> 01:51:36,500
There was nothing
mentioned about burying.

1351
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:37,458
It's still with me.

1352
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:38,917
What the hell are you doing with it?

1353
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,333
When did you catch it?

1354
01:51:40,417 --> 01:51:42,667
Around fifteen to twenty minutes ago.

1355
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,083
Be precise, you moron!

1356
01:51:44,167 --> 01:51:46,208
You can control it for one <i>naazhigai</i>.

1357
01:51:46,292 --> 01:51:48,125
-What does that mean?
-24 minutes.

1358
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:49,833
It has to be buried along
with salt within that time.

1359
01:51:49,917 --> 01:51:53,333
Or else, it will try to come out
and things will unfold in its favor.

1360
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,125
I'll go bury it
somewhere right away.

1361
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:02,750
-Don't worry. I'll be back in an hour.
-Hello!

1362
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:20,375
Who's that?

1363
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:21,625
Who's that?

1364
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:23,375
Mr. Ravi had sent us.
Come, let's go.

1365
01:52:23,458 --> 01:52:25,458
I need to go.
Tell him that I'll call later.

1366
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:26,958
That can wait.
For now, come with us.

1367
01:52:27,292 --> 01:52:28,542
Hey, listen to me.
I can't come now.

1368
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:31,208
-Yes, boss.
-<i>Did you find the boy?</i>

1369
01:52:31,292 --> 01:52:33,917
Yes, sir but I guess he sensed something.

1370
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:35,958
We'll be there in an hour.

1371
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:38,250
<i>No need for that.
The job is done.</i>

1372
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:40,417
Just make him sign the documents.

1373
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,292
-Hey, am I clear?
-Yes, boss.

1374
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:44,542
Hey! I have to go!

1375
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:53,333
Is this what you ran for?

1376
01:52:54,042 --> 01:52:55,083
Come, let's get him.

1377
01:53:00,958 --> 01:53:01,792
Guys!

1378
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,417
Look at his choice of weapon!

1379
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:20,750
Please spare me.

1380
01:53:20,833 --> 01:53:21,833
I won't spare you!

1381
01:53:34,667 --> 01:53:35,583
Hey!

1382
01:53:35,917 --> 01:53:37,250
Is there any medicine in the car?

1383
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:41,042
Or, go find a pharmacy
and get me a bandage.

1384
01:53:43,542 --> 01:53:45,167
What are you looking at?

1385
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:46,958
Don't create a scene like you're dying.

1386
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:48,625
What do you know about pain?

1387
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:50,000
It is a deep cut!

1388
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:53,375
Hey!

1389
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:54,833
Won't you guys go?

1390
01:53:54,917 --> 01:53:55,875
Won't you?

1391
01:53:56,667 --> 01:53:57,583
Saravana!

1392
01:53:58,333 --> 01:53:59,625
Tell them to go!

1393
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:04,583
Why did you stab him?

1394
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,042
Who asked you to do it?

1395
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:14,167
You, moron!

1396
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:26,875
Go and get the
documents from the car.

1397
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,667
Just go, man!

1398
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,667
Hey.

1399
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:42,833
I'll wait in the car.

1400
01:55:10,833 --> 01:55:11,792
Hey!

1401
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:13,000
It's left thumb.

1402
01:55:36,917 --> 01:55:38,458
Come, let's go.

1403
01:55:43,417 --> 01:55:44,292
Hey!

1404
01:55:45,292 --> 01:55:46,333
Hey!

1405
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:47,750
What do I do with this?

1406
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:49,833
It's up to you.
Do as you please.

1407
01:55:58,167 --> 01:55:59,750
My house…

1408
01:56:01,583 --> 01:56:03,000
You punk! Die!

1409
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:04,375
Die!

1410
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:06,458
I will…

1411
01:56:06,917 --> 01:56:08,333
Just wait and watch
what happens to you now!

1412
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:39,000
<i>In the whirl…</i>

1413
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:43,042
<i>Of darkness…</i>

1414
01:56:44,875 --> 01:56:48,292
<i>Sleeps…</i>

1415
01:56:49,417 --> 01:56:52,333
<i>A weary dream</i>

1416
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:55,750
<i>A memory cries</i>

1417
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,083
Hey!

1418
01:56:58,583 --> 01:56:59,500
Hey!

1419
01:57:00,708 --> 01:57:01,750
Enjoy the movie.

1420
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:04,250
It's 3D.

1421
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:08,750
<i>And becomes a sheer poetry</i>

1422
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:51,875
<i>On a quest to save humanity's day,</i>

1423
01:57:53,917 --> 01:57:56,917
<i>we play hide and seek with life.</i>

1424
01:57:58,125 --> 01:58:01,167
<i>While fear clouds the sunny day…</i>

1425
01:58:02,125 --> 01:58:05,333
<i>the twilight rules at the end of the day.</i>

1426
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:09,333
<i>It is called an ungrateful soul.</i>

1427
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:13,750
<i>Yet we try to grapple and hold.</i>

1428
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:18,333
<i>Yet we try to grapple and hold.</i>

1429
01:58:19,167 --> 01:58:22,458
-<i>every suffering becomes a myth.</i>
-What are you doing here?

1430
01:58:22,542 --> 01:58:23,458
Hey!

1431
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:24,792
Hey!

1432
01:58:24,875 --> 01:58:25,917
Don't you want to go home?

1433
01:58:27,792 --> 01:58:28,667
Hey, Selvam!

1434
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:30,917
Hey, Selvam!

1435
01:58:31,542 --> 01:58:32,792
Selvam!

1436
01:58:34,667 --> 01:58:35,833
Selvam.

1437
01:58:35,917 --> 01:58:36,875
Selvam!

1438
01:58:38,292 --> 01:58:39,375
Selvam!

1439
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,417
<i>In the whirl…</i>

1440
01:58:46,667 --> 01:58:49,167
Have you met that boy before?

1441
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:50,500
-No, sir.
-Hey!

1442
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,167
The opposite cycle shop guy
told me that he used to come here often.

1443
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:56,750
I might've seen him a couple
of times while issuing tickets, sir.

1444
01:58:56,833 --> 01:58:58,875
Other than that, I
know nothing about him.

1445
01:58:58,958 --> 01:59:02,292
Come on, man! Don't you
have a better answer?

1446
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:04,792
How else can we find his identity?

1447
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:08,333
Wasn't there any address
or details in his pocket?

1448
01:59:11,292 --> 01:59:16,083
They've completely wiped out
everything from him, heartless animals.

1449
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,542
Get his name, address
and phone number.

1450
01:59:21,542 --> 01:59:24,875
-Has Jeyapal left the station?
-Yes, sir. He's on his way.

1451
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:27,708
You'll have to come
to the station tomorrow.

1452
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:29,917
-Don't leave town.
-Okay, sir.

1453
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,417
Or else, we'll have to come after you.

1454
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:34,375
Sukumaran.

1455
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:36,000
Are you from Kerala?

1456
01:59:36,083 --> 01:59:37,167
Yes, sir.

1457
01:59:38,333 --> 01:59:39,417
I will take your leave.

1458
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:43,708
<i>I melt away like</i>

1459
01:59:43,792 --> 01:59:47,458
<i>The waning moon, mindlessly</i>

1460
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:51,958
<i>I'm swept away by</i>

1461
01:59:52,042 --> 01:59:55,708
<i>A dark tide, ruthlessly</i>

1462
01:59:56,333 --> 02:00:00,500
<i>I fade away</i>

1463
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:04,500
<i>Without a trace, unfairly</i>

1464
02:00:04,583 --> 02:00:08,000
<i>Of darkness…</i>

1465
02:00:08,708 --> 02:00:12,250
<i>Sleeps…</i>

1466
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:16,375
<i>A weary dream</i>

1467
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:21,208
<i>A memory…</i>

1468
02:00:21,292 --> 02:00:25,042
<i>Cries</i>

1469
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:29,625
<i>To awaken it</i>

1470
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:33,708
<i>And becomes sheer poetry</i>

1471
02:00:34,292 --> 02:00:37,417
Do you have a photo of him?

1472
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,333
I don't have anything, sir.

1473
02:00:39,417 --> 02:00:40,667
How old is he?

1474
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:43,000
Twenty five.
Visually challenged.

1475
02:00:43,083 --> 02:00:45,875
How would I know who
called me from your phone, sir?

1476
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,833
It was you who spoke
to me over the phone.

1477
02:00:48,167 --> 02:00:52,000
And also, you say that
there's just you in that room.

1478
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:53,917
What if it was a cross talk?

1479
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,708
No way. That's not possible.

1480
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,750
I saw the number
dialing with my own eyes.

1481
02:00:59,083 --> 02:01:00,958
Have you searched everywhere thoroughly?

1482
02:01:01,042 --> 02:01:03,708
Most of the missing people
end up being in a friend's house.

1483
02:01:03,792 --> 02:01:06,667
No, sir. We've looked around thoroughly.

1484
02:01:07,333 --> 02:01:09,917
Besides, he's got nobody.

1485
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,833
He never goes out
without informing his friends.

1486
02:01:13,375 --> 02:01:16,375
About four days ago, he
spoke to him over phone.

1487
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,833
Since then, we have no news about him.

1488
02:01:19,708 --> 02:01:23,083
Have you lost someone
dear to you recently?

1489
02:01:23,167 --> 02:01:24,917
Four days ago…

1490
02:01:25,417 --> 02:01:27,708
a report of an unidentified body
was recorded at the Triplicane station.

1491
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:28,833
He was of the same age you'd mentioned.

1492
02:01:28,917 --> 02:01:31,250
-Take a look at it for formality--
-It's not necessary, teacher.

1493
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:33,042
It won't be him.

1494
02:01:33,375 --> 02:01:36,458
Sir, is this the way you handle
a missing person's case?

1495
02:01:36,792 --> 02:01:37,958
Recently…

1496
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:41,750
about eight months
ago, I lost my friend.

1497
02:01:41,833 --> 02:01:42,708
Selvam.

1498
02:01:44,792 --> 02:01:46,667
Do you know the Maternity Hospital
at Royapettah?

1499
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:50,417
-Yeah.
-He lived in an old bungalow near that.

1500
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:51,667
Manoj…

1501
02:01:52,083 --> 02:01:54,458
can you please wait at the bench outside?

1502
02:01:55,125 --> 02:01:57,792
I'll file a complaint and join you.

1503
02:01:57,875 --> 02:01:58,917
Okay, teacher.

1504
02:02:03,958 --> 02:02:04,792
Sir.

1505
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:07,625
It's his birthday in three days.

1506
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,250
We've even ordered a cake to surprise him.

1507
02:02:11,583 --> 02:02:14,667
Please find him for us.

1508
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,042
What happened, sir?

1509
02:02:25,125 --> 02:02:27,875
He was murdered.
I don't know what went wrong.

1510
02:02:27,958 --> 02:02:30,750
He was brutally stabbed with a
broken bottle in broad daylight.

1511
02:02:31,208 --> 02:02:32,583
You might've read it in the newspapers.

1512
02:02:36,833 --> 02:02:38,583
Where was your friend working?

1513
02:02:38,667 --> 02:02:41,250
Do you know the government library
opposite to the passport office?

1514
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:42,792
Yeah, the old one.

1515
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:46,250
He was working there
as a clerk for four years.

1516
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,625
Do you know Selvam's phone number?

1517
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:51,083
Yes, I do.

1518
02:02:51,625 --> 02:02:54,125
Two, four, two, two--

1519
02:02:54,208 --> 02:02:55,458
Four, four, nine, two.

1520
02:02:55,542 --> 02:02:56,667
Correct, sir.

1521
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:59,083
It's the same number.
How did you know?

1522
02:02:59,167 --> 02:03:00,333
I'll tell you.

1523
02:03:00,417 --> 02:03:02,250
Do you have a photo of him?

1524
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,250
Do you have a group photo?

1525
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:07,417
We don't have photographs in Braille.

1526
02:03:10,917 --> 02:03:14,208
Can I use your phone?
Need to call my office urgently.

1527
02:03:14,292 --> 02:03:15,583
Sure. Go Ahead.

1528
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:25,875
Until yesterday, it was
just an unidentified body.

1529
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:29,208
But today, it's got a name.
Selvam.

1530
02:03:29,667 --> 02:03:33,208
The empathy you both have
showed as a teacher and as a friend

1531
02:03:33,542 --> 02:03:36,542
has surely made the face on
the photo an unforgettable one.

1532
02:03:41,083 --> 02:03:42,625
Sorry, I couldn't connect.

1533
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:44,917
Thanks.

1534
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,917
Sir, one minute.

1535
02:03:46,542 --> 02:03:49,542
Sir, you dialed Selvam's number
instead of your office, right?

1536
02:03:52,083 --> 02:03:53,375
I know.

1537
02:03:53,458 --> 02:03:55,125
Even I call that number
every now and then.

1538
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,958
It used to ring continuously.

1539
02:03:57,875 --> 02:03:59,833
Sometimes I've even felt
as if someone picked my call.

1540
02:04:00,417 --> 02:04:01,458
I know he's not around…

1541
02:04:02,667 --> 02:04:05,250
but somehow, I still feel his presence.

1542
02:04:05,875 --> 02:04:07,292
How do you know Selvam?

1543
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:09,042
Is he your school friend?

1544
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,667
No.

1545
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:11,583
Call friend.

1546
02:04:30,708 --> 02:04:32,500
Does he always
sit in front of the TV?

1547
02:04:33,292 --> 02:04:35,042
No, doctor. Not until recently.

1548
02:04:36,625 --> 02:04:40,000
When I met him recently, I
found a lot of changes in him.

1549
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:41,708
He spoke with a lot of clarity.

1550
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:45,500
Also, he never mentioned about
meeting you until I asked him.

1551
02:04:45,583 --> 02:04:47,542
But then I grew
suspicious and followed him.

1552
02:04:47,875 --> 02:04:50,167
I found that he's been
visiting his old patients

1553
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:51,708
without a license!

1554
02:04:51,792 --> 02:04:53,458
How many times has
Dr. Indran visited him?

1555
02:04:53,958 --> 02:04:55,500
Twice, I think.

1556
02:04:56,917 --> 02:04:58,917
Do you notice any
abnormal changes in him?

1557
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:00,833
He seems a lot happier these days.

1558
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:04,292
Something is not right, Harish.

1559
02:05:04,667 --> 02:05:05,792
What's the status of his evaluation?

1560
02:05:05,875 --> 02:05:06,792
Two sessions are over.

1561
02:05:07,125 --> 02:05:08,917
There are high chances
that he might clear in the next--

1562
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,833
No! Don't clear him.

1563
02:05:11,833 --> 02:05:13,375
He shouldn't practice.

1564
02:05:13,458 --> 02:05:15,125
Something terrible is going to happen.

1565
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,125
Is that why you look disturbed?

1566
02:05:19,125 --> 02:05:20,833
That doesn't matter now, Harish.

1567
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,542
I visited all of his patients.

1568
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:26,250
There's a drastic
improvement in all of them.

1569
02:05:29,292 --> 02:05:30,458
That's not normal.

1570
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,875
I doubt if this was possible
even while he was practicing.

1571
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:35,625
See, that explains everything.

1572
02:05:36,042 --> 02:05:37,917
-He's back.
-No, Harish.

1573
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:40,375
His patients seem really happy.

1574
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:43,417
Why do you complain about the good things?

1575
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,333
-Laughter yoga, laughter therapy--
-You'll understand only if you see them.

1576
02:05:47,208 --> 02:05:48,333
Not just one or two.

1577
02:05:48,750 --> 02:05:51,000
But all five of them had
that same peculiar smile.

1578
02:05:51,583 --> 02:05:52,875
That laughter…

1579
02:05:52,958 --> 02:05:54,292
How do I say it?

1580
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,083
It's a weird smile.

1581
02:05:58,792 --> 02:06:00,208
It looked as if…

1582
02:06:00,667 --> 02:06:01,833
It…

1583
02:06:31,958 --> 02:06:33,958
Now you can also smile.

1584
02:06:42,083 --> 02:06:44,708
Did you try calling the
doctor after that day?

1585
02:06:44,792 --> 02:06:48,292
There's a lot happening around.
I forgot about it.

1586
02:06:50,958 --> 02:06:53,750
What is this place?
Why did you bring me here?

1587
02:06:54,417 --> 02:06:57,333
Nobody can hear us amid the noise.

1588
02:06:57,833 --> 02:06:58,958
What is it?

1589
02:07:00,708 --> 02:07:03,125
I've found out who he is.
His name is Selvam.

1590
02:07:03,708 --> 02:07:05,333
He used to work as a clerk
in the government library.

1591
02:07:05,667 --> 02:07:07,958
Eight months ago, he
was murdered by someone.

1592
02:07:08,042 --> 02:07:09,000
How did you find it?

1593
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,667
His friend told me over the phone.

1594
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:14,458
How did you know his number?

1595
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:17,792
I don't know his number,
but I spoke to him.

1596
02:07:17,875 --> 02:07:19,125
That's what I'm asking, how?

1597
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,583
The phone dialed by itself
and the call got connected.

1598
02:07:23,125 --> 02:07:24,833
I know where this is heading.

1599
02:07:24,917 --> 02:07:26,958
First, it was the phone
that moved by itself.

1600
02:07:27,042 --> 02:07:29,792
Then it was the cards
that arranged on its own

1601
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,542
And now you're telling me that
the phone dials by itself.

1602
02:07:32,625 --> 02:07:35,500
People spend millions to do
all this in graphics.

1603
02:07:35,583 --> 02:07:38,042
-Are you not going to believe me?
-How can I believe you?

1604
02:07:38,792 --> 02:07:41,333
If he's torturing you so much,
why are you living in that room?

1605
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:44,000
And even if you are living there,
why don't you mind your own business?

1606
02:07:44,375 --> 02:07:46,500
Why are you calling random people?

1607
02:07:46,583 --> 02:07:49,333
If someone attacks you directly,
you can identify him and avoid him.

1608
02:07:49,417 --> 02:07:51,792
But I know nothing
about him or his motive.

1609
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:54,417
And he knows everything about me.

1610
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,333
Then, why are you still there?

1611
02:07:56,417 --> 02:07:58,042
Do you think he'll spare me
if I try to escape?

1612
02:07:58,125 --> 02:07:59,708
Should I give you an instant solution?

1613
02:07:59,792 --> 02:08:02,542
Go to the shop and buy a new mobile phone.

1614
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:03,917
Matter solved!

1615
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,292
I can avoid the landline at home.

1616
02:08:05,667 --> 02:08:07,583
But if I have a mobile phone,
it will always be with me.

1617
02:08:07,667 --> 02:08:08,917
You seem to have a
problem for every solution.

1618
02:08:10,792 --> 02:08:12,833
Until now, I thought
you're stuck in this game.

1619
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:15,792
But now I realize that you're after it.

1620
02:08:16,125 --> 02:08:17,708
That's why you
don't want this to end.

1621
02:08:17,792 --> 02:08:21,292
Do you know what my coach
said during my first day of practice?

1622
02:08:21,375 --> 02:08:22,375
"Play till the end."

1623
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:24,625
Didn't the same coach tell
you another important thing?

1624
02:08:25,042 --> 02:08:26,125
"Know your opponent."

1625
02:08:26,458 --> 02:08:28,250
Correct. And I'm almost there.

1626
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:32,000
I know his name, number
and the house that he lived in.

1627
02:08:32,083 --> 02:08:35,750
But now I'll know his motive
and the reason for his outrage.

1628
02:08:36,167 --> 02:08:38,917
I will find him and know him
in ways an opponent shouldn't.

1629
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:40,625
I will!

1630
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,333
<i>7th May, 2019.</i>

1631
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,583
<i>Third day of the lunar month.</i>

1632
02:10:03,667 --> 02:10:05,083
<i>It's 9:13 p.m.</i>

1633
02:10:05,875 --> 02:10:07,375
<i>Number 426.</i>

1634
02:10:09,083 --> 02:10:12,042
<i>Until now, I've never
spoken to anyone for my sake.</i>

1635
02:10:12,542 --> 02:10:13,667
<i>This is the first time.</i>

1636
02:10:14,708 --> 02:10:17,542
<i>And this is not for me but for my teacher.</i>

1637
02:10:18,458 --> 02:10:19,458
<i>It's for your daughter.</i>

1638
02:10:19,917 --> 02:10:21,083
<i>Pooja?</i>

1639
02:10:21,167 --> 02:10:22,333
<i>What happened to her?</i>

1640
02:10:23,167 --> 02:10:26,000
<i>Her mind is always disturbed.</i>

1641
02:10:26,375 --> 02:10:28,042
<i>Why? What's the reason?</i>

1642
02:10:29,708 --> 02:10:30,833
<i>It's a small thing.</i>

1643
02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:34,833
<i>But your answer to her question
may help her overcome her grief.</i>

1644
02:10:35,417 --> 02:10:37,667
<i>What is it? Please tell me.</i>

1645
02:10:38,083 --> 02:10:42,333
<i>She thinks she is the reason behind
your death</i>

1646
02:10:42,417 --> 02:10:43,708
<i>and regrets it every single day.</i>

1647
02:10:44,667 --> 02:10:46,667
<i>She wants to know if
you'll forgive her for that.</i>

1648
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:47,625
<i>My God!</i>

1649
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,208
<i>It was not at all her mistake.</i>

1650
02:10:50,292 --> 02:10:53,042
<i>It was me who forgot to wear a helmet.</i>

1651
02:10:54,167 --> 02:10:58,500
<i>I don't know why
but my mind was restless that day.</i>

1652
02:10:59,042 --> 02:11:00,708
<i>I didn't even realize that
I jumped the traffic signal.</i>

1653
02:11:01,375 --> 02:11:03,042
<i>It was entirely my mistake.</i>

1654
02:11:03,542 --> 02:11:04,500
<i>Poor girl.</i>

1655
02:11:04,583 --> 02:11:08,875
<i>Rather, she is doing a job that
has nothing to do with her dreams</i>

1656
02:11:08,958 --> 02:11:11,125
<i>and shoulders the
family responsibilities.</i>

1657
02:11:11,542 --> 02:11:13,125
<i>It's she who has
to forgive me for that.</i>

1658
02:11:14,125 --> 02:11:16,542
<i>Can you please pass
my message to her, son?</i>

1659
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,167
<i>I love her and I'll always
be watching over her.</i>

1660
02:11:21,167 --> 02:11:23,042
<i>Number 426.</i>

1661
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,208
<i>Resolved.</i>

1662
02:11:54,417 --> 02:11:56,625
Yeah, I remember meeting the boy.

1663
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:59,333
You're right. About ten days ago…

1664
02:11:59,417 --> 02:12:02,250
he was here with his father's books
to get them published.

1665
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:05,583
But, I talked some sense
into him and sent him back.

1666
02:12:06,667 --> 02:12:10,083
But he's written in his journal
that you had offered him a job.

1667
02:12:10,667 --> 02:12:13,792
Yeah, I offered him a job
of a lift operator.

1668
02:12:13,875 --> 02:12:16,750
But he refused the offer.

1669
02:12:16,833 --> 02:12:18,208
What happened to that boy?

1670
02:12:19,042 --> 02:12:21,542
He died five days back.

1671
02:12:21,958 --> 02:12:23,000
What?

1672
02:12:23,583 --> 02:12:24,583
Poor guy.

1673
02:12:25,583 --> 02:12:27,292
It's unbelievable.

1674
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:28,792
How did it happen?

1675
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:30,333
Somebody…

1676
02:12:30,792 --> 02:12:33,458
for some unknown reason has murdered him.

1677
02:12:34,042 --> 02:12:35,042
My God!

1678
02:12:36,375 --> 02:12:38,167
Can I help you with some
money for his funeral?

1679
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:40,375
No, sir. I'll leave now.

1680
02:12:44,708 --> 02:12:46,875
Why is your company's
board hanging outside his gate?

1681
02:12:48,917 --> 02:12:51,375
How else am I supposed to recover
the money from him?

1682
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:52,625
What else did he have?

1683
02:12:52,958 --> 02:12:56,167
By the way, who are you?
How are you related to him?

1684
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:57,333
I'm his teacher.

1685
02:12:57,417 --> 02:12:59,000
Only students can raise questions.

1686
02:12:59,083 --> 02:13:00,917
Teachers should just mind their business.

1687
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:04,417
If you still need an answer,
ask the dead guy to come over.

1688
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:06,417
I'll answer him.
Now get lost!

1689
02:13:07,125 --> 02:13:08,708
Get lost!

1690
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:13,417
Hey, who's at the Royapettah house?

1691
02:13:13,833 --> 02:13:16,417
Some girl had been there and
is asking me unwanted questions.

1692
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,125
Send somebody and have it checked.

1693
02:13:23,583 --> 02:13:24,667
Hello!

1694
02:13:25,042 --> 02:13:26,833
<i>Doctor, your friend is here.</i>

1695
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:29,917
He doesn't like me smiling.

1696
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,833
<i>Doctor?</i>

1697
02:13:34,667 --> 02:13:37,000
I feel bad since he is my friend.

1698
02:13:37,333 --> 02:13:38,917
But he won't feel any pain.

1699
02:13:39,542 --> 02:13:40,375
Okay.

1700
02:13:40,917 --> 02:13:41,750
Proceed.

1701
02:13:41,833 --> 02:13:42,708
Thanks, doctor.

1702
02:13:51,208 --> 02:13:53,458
I'm sending your approval letter
to the council right away.

1703
02:13:53,917 --> 02:13:56,167
I'll also be mailing you
the list of my patients.

1704
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:58,458
<i>Please take good care of them.</i>

1705
02:13:58,542 --> 02:13:59,625
Sure.

1706
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,375
Hello!

1707
02:15:11,458 --> 02:15:12,917
What do you think of yourself?

1708
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,375
Do you think I'll tolerate you forever?

1709
02:15:14,458 --> 02:15:17,750
<i>Is that why despite living a pathetic life</i>

1710
02:15:17,833 --> 02:15:19,792
<i>you wanted to record it and watch?</i>

1711
02:15:19,875 --> 02:15:23,750
I know who you are! You are Selvam!

1712
02:15:23,833 --> 02:15:27,292
Why are you ruining my life
if you got killed?

1713
02:15:27,375 --> 02:15:30,750
<i>Even if you rewind every frame of
the 28 years of your worthless life</i>

1714
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:35,083
<i>and recall every single
face that you've seen</i>

1715
02:15:35,167 --> 02:15:37,792
<i>you'll still never get
close to finding me.</i>

1716
02:15:38,167 --> 02:15:39,375
<i>Not even my shadow.</i>

1717
02:15:39,458 --> 02:15:43,542
<i>I know that you'll never
have the guts to face me.</i>

1718
02:15:43,875 --> 02:15:45,625
Hello!

1719
02:15:46,167 --> 02:15:47,125
Selvam!

1720
02:15:48,667 --> 02:15:50,583
If you have the guts,
then come and face me!

1721
02:16:44,208 --> 02:16:45,375
Car parking is that way.

1722
02:16:46,375 --> 02:16:48,667
The place is well ventilated.

1723
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:10,417
Please wait downstairs for five minutes.

1724
02:17:19,417 --> 02:17:20,542
What the hell are you doing?

1725
02:17:21,792 --> 02:17:22,958
Time and again

1726
02:17:23,042 --> 02:17:24,583
it's become your habit to humiliate me.

1727
02:17:25,708 --> 02:17:27,458
Why have you stuck
papers all over the room?

1728
02:17:27,917 --> 02:17:29,083
Like always.

1729
02:17:30,042 --> 02:17:31,250
What do you mean?

1730
02:17:31,333 --> 02:17:33,458
Did he come to your room and do this?

1731
02:17:35,042 --> 02:17:36,583
Just say something!

1732
02:17:56,708 --> 02:17:58,042
It's not what you think.

1733
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:01,167
When I was about to
break the camera in anger…

1734
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,208
I think it accidentally got recorded.

1735
02:18:05,208 --> 02:18:06,208
Did you try breaking the camera?

1736
02:18:06,625 --> 02:18:07,917
Is that what you do when you get angry?

1737
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,125
The camera is mine!

1738
02:18:09,208 --> 02:18:11,167
Exactly. That's why I didn't break it.

1739
02:18:11,625 --> 02:18:13,333
If it was mine, I would've
definitely broken it.

1740
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:16,083
But why didn't I break it?
What stopped me?

1741
02:18:16,542 --> 02:18:18,375
A "purpose" that
I have to return it to you.

1742
02:18:18,792 --> 02:18:20,667
That's the kind of "purpose",
I don't have in my life.

1743
02:18:21,333 --> 02:18:23,583
This is what he's been
highlighting all along.

1744
02:18:24,125 --> 02:18:25,958
And I'm ruining my
life without realizing it.

1745
02:18:26,042 --> 02:18:27,375
What does he gain out of this?

1746
02:18:27,458 --> 02:18:29,458
Because he wants to
break me into pieces.

1747
02:18:29,542 --> 02:18:31,792
He gets pleasure out of it.
A cheap thrill!

1748
02:18:32,208 --> 02:18:34,667
The one who tried to break
the camera was "him".

1749
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:36,667
And "I" am the reason for my anger.

1750
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:38,208
This camera is my life.

1751
02:18:38,708 --> 02:18:41,250
So, he's trying to use my anger
as a medium to destroy my life.

1752
02:18:41,917 --> 02:18:42,958
That's his master plan.

1753
02:18:44,583 --> 02:18:45,458
Don't you get it?

1754
02:18:45,542 --> 02:18:48,083
He could've done anything
to me as and when he wanted.

1755
02:18:48,417 --> 02:18:51,083
He could've even dropped the fan on
my head and killed me while I was asleep.

1756
02:18:51,167 --> 02:18:53,792
But he didn't because
that's not his intention.

1757
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:57,208
Every action has
an equal and opposite reaction.

1758
02:18:57,292 --> 02:18:59,708
So, he decides my reaction
and acts accordingly.

1759
02:19:00,333 --> 02:19:02,583
There's only one way to get to him.

1760
02:19:02,667 --> 02:19:04,458
I shouldn't display the
reaction that he needs.

1761
02:19:04,542 --> 02:19:08,250
To destroy a bowler, you don't need
to hit fours and sixes on every ball.

1762
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:10,208
You just need to play
defense with disdain.

1763
02:19:10,292 --> 02:19:11,250
He'll be finished.

1764
02:19:11,333 --> 02:19:14,292
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I've decided to step out of the house.

1765
02:19:17,125 --> 02:19:19,667
The guy waiting outside is calling me.

1766
02:19:20,208 --> 02:19:21,167
I am leaving.

1767
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:25,667
For heaven's sake, please don't
carry the phone along with you.

1768
02:19:57,125 --> 02:19:58,208
Hello?

1769
02:19:59,292 --> 02:20:00,208
<i>How are you, teacher?</i>

1770
02:20:01,333 --> 02:20:02,500
S-Selvam?

1771
02:20:03,208 --> 02:20:06,458
<i>The roadkill rodents
that you see everyday</i>

1772
02:20:06,958 --> 02:20:09,417
<i>were once safe inside a house.</i>

1773
02:20:09,917 --> 02:20:13,208
<i>The day it got curious
to see the outer world</i>

1774
02:20:13,292 --> 02:20:15,250
<i>it died.</i>

1775
02:20:15,333 --> 02:20:17,083
Thanks. Now, buzz off.

1776
02:20:17,167 --> 02:20:19,083
-<i>What if I say "No"?</i>
-Doesn't matter.

1777
02:20:19,167 --> 02:20:20,792
You can't stop me from anything.

1778
02:20:24,292 --> 02:20:26,083
Do you think you can
scare me with all this?

1779
02:20:26,583 --> 02:20:28,958
I'm leaving this house.
Try stopping me!

1780
02:20:34,958 --> 02:20:36,375
What's all this, Selvam?

1781
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:39,292
What's happening?
How're you talking on the phone?

1782
02:20:39,375 --> 02:20:43,458
<i>I'm talking to you in the same
way I talked to your father.</i>

1783
02:20:43,542 --> 02:20:44,542
Hello!

1784
02:20:44,958 --> 02:20:45,917
Hello!

1785
02:20:48,083 --> 02:20:50,083
Watchman! Help!

1786
02:20:50,167 --> 02:20:52,208
Watchman! Please!

1787
02:20:52,292 --> 02:20:53,875
Who did this to you, Selvam?

1788
02:20:54,208 --> 02:20:56,542
Please tell me.
It's the press owner, right?

1789
02:20:57,375 --> 02:20:58,375
<i>No, teacher.</i>

1790
02:20:58,958 --> 02:21:01,125
<i>My situation forced me to do this.</i>

1791
02:21:01,583 --> 02:21:03,375
<i>That's how I died.</i>

1792
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:10,417
<i>The number you're calling is
not reachable at the moment.</i>

1793
02:21:13,333 --> 02:21:14,333
<i>Hello!</i>

1794
02:21:14,417 --> 02:21:15,292
Sister, it's me, Vinod.

1795
02:21:15,375 --> 02:21:16,917
<i>Tell me, Vinod. How're you?</i>

1796
02:21:17,625 --> 02:21:19,292
Can you please come to my place?

1797
02:21:19,375 --> 02:21:20,500
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

1798
02:21:21,458 --> 02:21:22,917
It's an emergency.

1799
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,375
<i>What is it?</i>

1800
02:21:24,458 --> 02:21:25,875
I'll tell you in person.

1801
02:21:26,417 --> 02:21:28,875
<i>Okay. I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

1802
02:21:28,958 --> 02:21:31,292
-Okay, sister. Thanks.
-<i>It's okay. Bye.</i>

1803
02:22:34,958 --> 02:22:36,042
Change!

1804
02:22:41,167 --> 02:22:42,167
Change!

1805
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,833
Eight!

1806
02:23:16,583 --> 02:23:20,167
Why didn't you ever tell me
that you were a medium?

1807
02:23:20,792 --> 02:23:22,000
<i>I'm not the medium, teacher.</i>

1808
02:23:22,708 --> 02:23:26,125
If you weren't the medium,
then how did you talk to spirits?

1809
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:29,042
<i>It's because the phone is the medium.</i>

1810
02:23:30,333 --> 02:23:32,167
<i>That's how I was able to
communicate with the spirits.</i>

1811
02:23:32,583 --> 02:23:34,292
<i>Otherwise, I was
just an ordinary person.</i>

1812
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,833
<i>The spells and occult stuffs</i>

1813
02:23:36,917 --> 02:23:39,333
<i>are things I picked up from my father.</i>

1814
02:23:39,958 --> 02:23:41,167
<i>That's where it went wrong.</i>

1815
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,625
Were you in lot of pain
during your final moments?

1816
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:45,875
Did you suffer?

1817
02:23:45,958 --> 02:23:47,542
<i>More than my death…</i>

1818
02:23:48,417 --> 02:23:51,292
<i>my inability to protect my
father's house was painful.</i>

1819
02:23:54,125 --> 02:23:55,542
You need to do something for me.

1820
02:23:55,875 --> 02:23:56,708
Will you do it?

1821
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:03,667
Lock the room.

1822
02:24:21,958 --> 02:24:23,000
Who's that?

1823
02:24:23,083 --> 02:24:25,167
Vinod, its me Pooja.
Open the door.

1824
02:24:25,250 --> 02:24:27,417
Sister, the door is
locked from outside.

1825
02:24:28,083 --> 02:24:29,875
Is there a spare key
with the neighbor.

1826
02:24:30,375 --> 02:24:31,458
The key is with me.

1827
02:24:31,792 --> 02:24:34,292
I'll throw it through the window.
Can you open it?

1828
02:24:34,375 --> 02:24:35,583
Throw it.

1829
02:24:42,667 --> 02:24:45,083
-What happened, Vinod?
-Give me your phone.

1830
02:24:45,875 --> 02:24:47,458
Tell me what it is! Vinod!

1831
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,042
Who are you calling? Vinod!

1832
02:24:56,917 --> 02:24:58,333
How do you have his number in your phone?

1833
02:24:59,875 --> 02:25:01,125
Selvam!

1834
02:25:02,083 --> 02:25:03,500
Selvam was my student.

1835
02:25:03,958 --> 02:25:05,083
How do you know him?

1836
02:25:05,458 --> 02:25:06,958
This is the guy I was searching for.

1837
02:25:07,042 --> 02:25:08,625
He's the one calling me and torturing me.

1838
02:25:08,958 --> 02:25:10,292
How can he call you?

1839
02:25:10,667 --> 02:25:12,375
It's been eight
months since he died.

1840
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:48,250
Hello!

1841
02:25:51,292 --> 02:25:52,333
Hello!

1842
02:25:52,417 --> 02:25:53,250
Selvam?

1843
02:25:53,333 --> 02:25:54,625
<i>Hello, teacher.</i>

1844
02:25:54,708 --> 02:25:56,083
<i>Please ask Vinod to
go away from this place.</i>

1845
02:25:57,083 --> 02:25:59,958
What's happening here, Selvam?
How do you know him?

1846
02:26:00,042 --> 02:26:03,750
<i>We don't have much time.
Just get him out of here. Please!</i>

1847
02:26:04,542 --> 02:26:06,333
I don't understand a thing.

1848
02:26:06,417 --> 02:26:09,167
Why are you calling Vinod?
Why should he go?

1849
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:12,292
<i>It's not important right now.
I'm here to protect Vinod.</i>

1850
02:26:13,875 --> 02:26:16,292
Protect him from what?
What's the problem?

1851
02:26:16,917 --> 02:26:19,500
<i>Teacher, he is in grave danger.</i>

1852
02:26:19,583 --> 02:26:22,417
<i>Please save him.
Take him away.</i>

1853
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:24,542
What are you saying?
Who's after him?

1854
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:43,958
Hello! Hello?

1855
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:03,542
Tell me!

1856
02:27:03,625 --> 02:27:06,042
Who is more powerful?

1857
02:27:06,125 --> 02:27:08,583
Didn't I tell that I'd find you?

1858
02:27:10,417 --> 02:27:12,417
I've ended your menace with one shot!

1859
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:14,083
With just one pull shot!

1860
02:27:14,167 --> 02:27:16,292
Do you know what's the irony?

1861
02:27:16,375 --> 02:27:18,625
That is my freaking weakest shot!

1862
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:22,208
What can you do now?

1863
02:27:23,375 --> 02:27:27,500
You're nothing but a goddamn dead phone!

1864
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,458
How did this phone come here?

1865
02:27:38,708 --> 02:27:40,042
Do you know whose phone is this?

1866
02:27:40,125 --> 02:27:42,042
I know! It's your student, Selvam's phone.

1867
02:27:42,625 --> 02:27:44,750
Two weeks back, this
came in as a replacement.

1868
02:27:44,833 --> 02:27:46,542
Since then all hell broke loose.

1869
02:27:46,625 --> 02:27:48,625
He kept calling me and drove me crazy.

1870
02:27:50,667 --> 02:27:54,167
I roamed around streets searching for him.

1871
02:27:54,250 --> 02:27:56,125
Only then, I found that he was dead.

1872
02:27:56,208 --> 02:27:58,208
But he kept stalking me!

1873
02:27:58,292 --> 02:28:00,875
Finally, only a minutes
before you arrived

1874
02:28:00,958 --> 02:28:03,542
I found that the number I was
searching for belonged to this phone.

1875
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:06,417
When I called to this
phone from your number, I found

1876
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:08,917
that he's been inside the phone all along.

1877
02:28:09,292 --> 02:28:11,042
That's why I finished him
with one single blow.

1878
02:28:11,125 --> 02:28:13,458
Let me see what he can do now!

1879
02:28:13,542 --> 02:28:15,167
Do you know what you've done?

1880
02:28:15,583 --> 02:28:19,292
He was only trying to help you
but you never realized.

1881
02:28:19,375 --> 02:28:20,667
You may believe that.

1882
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:23,875
If he's good, why did he call
and torture me for no reason?

1883
02:28:24,458 --> 02:28:26,167
Don't you get it?

1884
02:28:26,875 --> 02:28:28,333
That phone is the medium.

1885
02:28:28,417 --> 02:28:31,625
Any dead person can talk through it.
Just like a channel.

1886
02:28:31,708 --> 02:28:34,458
If the phone is the medium, he
should've talked to me on the phone!

1887
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,917
He can't call to this number.

1888
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,583
That's what I'm asking, why?

1889
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:42,000
Because Selvam is here.
He is in your room.

1890
02:28:51,875 --> 02:28:53,042
In my room?

1891
02:28:53,708 --> 02:28:54,542
Why?

1892
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:56,042
I don't know about that.

1893
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:00,417
He said that someone's after you
and he's protecting you.

1894
02:29:00,958 --> 02:29:03,875
Just when he was about to tell me
who it was, you broke the phone.

1895
02:29:04,708 --> 02:29:07,625
Who could be after me?

1896
02:29:08,125 --> 02:29:09,375
You should tell me.

1897
02:29:09,458 --> 02:29:12,000
Who might be so mad at
you that he wants you dead?

1898
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:13,625
But…

1899
02:29:13,958 --> 02:29:15,708
Selvam told me something.

1900
02:29:16,083 --> 02:29:17,625
The person knows both of us.

1901
02:29:18,375 --> 02:29:19,625
I wonder who he is.

1902
02:29:20,042 --> 02:29:21,042
What do we do now?

1903
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:24,292
We need to talk to Selvam.

1904
02:29:24,625 --> 02:29:26,667
There's only one way to do it.

1905
02:29:27,250 --> 02:29:28,875
We need to somehow get this phone fixed.

1906
02:29:29,208 --> 02:29:30,875
Okay. Let's not waste time.

1907
02:29:31,292 --> 02:29:33,792
Grab the phone and come.
I'll go get the car.

1908
02:29:33,875 --> 02:29:34,917
Come on, let's go.

1909
02:29:46,667 --> 02:29:49,042
Today is your final session.

1910
02:29:50,417 --> 02:29:53,000
After this, you'll be free.

1911
02:29:53,708 --> 02:29:57,875
Until now, you might've seen
this world through a little window.

1912
02:29:58,542 --> 02:30:02,875
But now, it's time to break
free and fly away from your cage.

1913
02:30:04,667 --> 02:30:06,167
I know you're a special child.

1914
02:30:07,292 --> 02:30:11,667
That's why, out of all others,
I've come to see you.

1915
02:30:14,083 --> 02:30:15,167
It's time.

1916
02:30:17,417 --> 02:30:21,458
<i>This journey will begin
exactly in two minutes.</i>

1917
02:30:22,917 --> 02:30:24,833
<i>Don't be scared about going alone.</i>

1918
02:30:25,708 --> 02:30:29,958
<i>Just like you, there are many
other patients awaiting freedom.</i>

1919
02:30:30,667 --> 02:30:32,125
<i>They'll accompany you.</i>

1920
02:30:33,167 --> 02:30:38,083
So, it's time to say goodbye
and welcome freedom.

1921
02:30:51,875 --> 02:30:52,833
Hello!

1922
02:30:54,375 --> 02:30:56,083
How about my neighbor, Jayakumar

1923
02:30:56,167 --> 02:30:59,000
who died in 2007.
You know him, right?

1924
02:31:00,125 --> 02:31:02,917
Yeah but we never had a problem.

1925
02:31:03,625 --> 02:31:04,708
Your batchmate…

1926
02:31:05,167 --> 02:31:06,500
The girl who committed
suicide last year?

1927
02:31:06,583 --> 02:31:08,167
-Suhasini?
-Yeah.

1928
02:31:08,958 --> 02:31:11,458
Not possible.
The voice is not a lady voice.

1929
02:31:12,833 --> 02:31:15,125
Then, who else could it be?

1930
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:16,833
Pradeep?

1931
02:31:17,458 --> 02:31:21,250
What am I even thinking?
He's your best friend.

1932
02:31:22,375 --> 02:31:24,625
Who else could it be?
It's just me thinking about it.

1933
02:31:24,708 --> 02:31:26,167
Come on, keep thinking.

1934
02:31:34,792 --> 02:31:35,917
This phone needs to be repaired.

1935
02:31:36,667 --> 02:31:38,542
-How can I repair this?
-Please, sir.

1936
02:31:38,625 --> 02:31:40,125
Give it a try. We need it urgently.

1937
02:31:40,208 --> 02:31:42,625
Are you from any cinema company?
Do you need it--

1938
02:31:42,708 --> 02:31:44,750
Nothing like that.
Please understand

1939
02:31:44,833 --> 02:31:47,458
-I'm expecting a call on this phone.
-Why do you want to repair this phone?

1940
02:31:47,542 --> 02:31:48,667
We have phones at throwaway prices--

1941
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:50,583
Just tell us how much it
would cost to repair this.

1942
02:31:50,667 --> 02:31:52,667
Ma'am, it's shattered into pieces.

1943
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:54,375
I have to check
what all parts are missing.

1944
02:31:54,458 --> 02:31:56,250
It may cost at least a thousand rupees.

1945
02:31:56,583 --> 02:31:58,667
Get it ready in half an hour, okay?

1946
02:31:59,333 --> 02:32:00,958
Please wait. I'll see what I can do.

1947
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,375
Tell me.

1948
02:32:05,542 --> 02:32:07,542
-Sir, have you parked your car outside?
-Yes.

1949
02:32:07,625 --> 02:32:09,417
The tow truck is here.

1950
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:11,042
Park it in the parking zone.

1951
02:32:11,125 --> 02:32:13,125
-I will go and check.
-Okay, sister.

1952
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:17,500
Sir, you can come back in a while.
It will take some time.

1953
02:32:17,583 --> 02:32:18,958
No, its okay. I'll wait here.

1954
02:32:19,042 --> 02:32:21,125
Don't worry, sir.
I'm not going to steal your phone.

1955
02:32:21,667 --> 02:32:22,792
I wish you did.

1956
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:41,792
<i>Hello!</i>

1957
02:32:41,875 --> 02:32:43,708
<i>Can I speak to Shiva?</i>

1958
02:32:43,792 --> 02:32:45,333
<i>Priya?</i>

1959
02:32:45,417 --> 02:32:48,458
-<i>Hello, who's that?</i>
-<i>Does it matter?</i>

1960
02:32:48,542 --> 02:32:50,042
<i>Can I speak to Shiva?</i>

1961
02:32:50,125 --> 02:32:51,917
<i>I'm Shiva speaking. And you?</i>

1962
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,375
-<i>Shiva!</i>
-<i>Priya?</i>

1963
02:32:53,458 --> 02:32:54,958
<i>Hi Shiva, how are you?</i>

1964
02:32:55,042 --> 02:32:57,958
-<i>Priya, who spoke to me?</i>
-<i>It was me.</i>

1965
02:32:58,042 --> 02:32:59,417
-<i>Really?</i>
-<i>Yes!</i>

1966
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:02,542
-<i>Was it really you?</i>
-<i>Yes, I changed my voice while talking.</i>

1967
02:33:02,625 --> 02:33:04,375
<i>Wow! You're so talented.</i>

1968
02:33:08,542 --> 02:33:09,375
<i>Hello!</i>

1969
02:33:09,458 --> 02:33:11,875
I have found out the guy
who's been driving me crazy.

1970
02:33:12,250 --> 02:33:13,792
<i>I know who he is!</i>

1971
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:16,500
Yeah, you told me that it was Selvam.

1972
02:33:16,583 --> 02:33:18,667
No. It's not Selvam.
He's a good guy.

1973
02:33:19,167 --> 02:33:23,083
It's Pradeep who's behind all this.
I am sure!

1974
02:33:23,167 --> 02:33:26,500
If it's Pradeep, how did
you not recognize his voice?

1975
02:33:26,583 --> 02:33:28,833
That's where the twist is.
After all he's a ghost, right?

1976
02:33:29,250 --> 02:33:31,000
-He can do anything.
-So what?

1977
02:33:31,083 --> 02:33:32,542
Are you saying that the ghosts
are good at mimicry?

1978
02:33:32,625 --> 02:33:34,333
<i>Why would he want to hurt you?</i>

1979
02:33:34,417 --> 02:33:36,250
That's what even I don't understand.

1980
02:33:36,792 --> 02:33:39,958
What did I do to him?
I don't know what he is up to.

1981
02:33:40,333 --> 02:33:43,500
I hope you realize that I'm not
his psychiatrist to answer that.

1982
02:33:44,458 --> 02:33:45,458
Correct!

1983
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:49,083
Dr. Indran, a psychiatrist
was treating him at his home.

1984
02:33:49,167 --> 02:33:50,958
<i>Probably, he might
have some answers.</i>

1985
02:33:51,042 --> 02:33:53,583
-I'll call you later. Bye.
-Hello?

1986
02:33:59,708 --> 02:34:03,458
<i>The number you are calling is currently
out of service.</i>

1987
02:34:04,917 --> 02:34:07,083
<i>It's not reachable at the moment.</i>

1988
02:34:07,167 --> 02:34:09,500
Bro, is there an internet center nearby?

1989
02:34:09,583 --> 02:34:11,375
-Go straight and there's one in the left.
-Thanks.

1990
02:34:13,083 --> 02:34:17,625
The 808 Sparks car that you've
locked in the next street belongs to me.

1991
02:34:17,958 --> 02:34:19,625
I was asked to come here.

1992
02:34:19,708 --> 02:34:23,250
The officer has just gone out for tea.
Wait for him.

1993
02:34:23,333 --> 02:34:26,167
But you have the keys, right?
Please unlock the car.

1994
02:34:26,250 --> 02:34:27,833
I can't open it with this key.

1995
02:34:27,917 --> 02:34:29,708
Money is the only key to unlock your car.

1996
02:34:30,042 --> 02:34:31,125
Hope you understand.

1997
02:34:31,208 --> 02:34:33,917
I'm also a government official,
working for the Traffic department.

1998
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,125
Please unlock it.

1999
02:34:35,458 --> 02:34:38,208
He'll rip me apart if
I unlock it, ma'am.

2000
02:34:38,292 --> 02:34:41,042
I didn't lock that car since it belongs
to a doctor.

2001
02:34:41,417 --> 02:34:43,833
But that creep locked that car himself.

2002
02:34:43,917 --> 02:34:46,000
You better wait and meet him.

2003
02:34:59,375 --> 02:35:00,417
Where is that boy?

2004
02:35:44,625 --> 02:35:49,583
<i>It's like giving a solution that
you already have.</i>

2005
02:35:49,667 --> 02:35:52,500
<i>For example it's like reading time from</i>

2006
02:35:52,583 --> 02:35:54,708
<i>your watch and telling
you what time it is.</i>

2007
02:35:55,208 --> 02:35:57,458
<i>That's it. Very simple.</i>

2008
02:36:01,042 --> 02:36:03,667
<i>For instance, you may search
for the key everywhere.</i>

2009
02:36:04,458 --> 02:36:06,542
<i>But finally, you might end
up finding it in your own pocket.</i>

2010
02:36:07,625 --> 02:36:12,083
<i>Likewise, the solution to a
problem might be around us, near us</i>

2011
02:36:12,417 --> 02:36:13,625
<i>or right in front of us.</i>

2012
02:36:14,875 --> 02:36:16,708
<i>But many a times we ignore it.</i>

2013
02:36:18,292 --> 02:36:19,125
Vinod!

2014
02:36:19,208 --> 02:36:21,208
We missed out Dr. Indran.

2015
02:36:28,042 --> 02:36:31,583
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2016
02:36:32,375 --> 02:36:35,875
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2017
02:36:36,542 --> 02:36:40,292
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2018
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:44,042
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2019
02:36:50,917 --> 02:36:51,875
Sir!

2020
02:36:53,500 --> 02:36:56,583
<i>In the womb of darkness
Begins the dawn of the death</i>

2021
02:36:56,667 --> 02:37:01,833
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2022
02:37:01,917 --> 02:37:05,000
<i>It's the spark of life that tries
To awaken the distant dream</i>

2023
02:37:05,083 --> 02:37:10,250
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2024
02:37:10,333 --> 02:37:13,917
<i>Here, I come</i>

2025
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,708
<i>For the final showdown</i>

2026
02:37:18,792 --> 02:37:22,917
<i>The play will end and curtains will fall</i>

2027
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,083
<i>You'll lose your guise
Amid an empty hall</i>

2028
02:37:27,167 --> 02:37:31,250
<i>The play will end and curtains will fall</i>

2029
02:37:31,333 --> 02:37:35,583
<i>You'll lose your guise
Amid an empty hall</i>

2030
02:37:39,750 --> 02:37:44,042
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2031
02:37:44,125 --> 02:37:47,958
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2032
02:37:48,292 --> 02:37:53,625
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2033
02:38:17,833 --> 02:38:21,083
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2034
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,500
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2035
02:38:26,167 --> 02:38:29,708
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2036
02:38:30,375 --> 02:38:33,958
<i>Who ever knew?</i>

2037
02:38:36,958 --> 02:38:39,083
<i>Do you think I'll go away
if you break the phone?</i>

2038
02:38:39,167 --> 02:38:42,292
<i>I'll rise from every
single part you break.</i>

2039
02:38:42,375 --> 02:38:45,458
<i>Even if you turn every part into
pieces, every piece into splinters,</i>

2040
02:38:45,542 --> 02:38:47,625
<i>every splinter into particles,
and every particle into dust,</i>

2041
02:38:47,708 --> 02:38:49,375
<i>I'll come rising from that.</i>

2042
02:38:49,458 --> 02:38:50,500
I know.

2043
02:38:51,167 --> 02:38:54,458
A coward who can't even reveal his name
is only worthy as particles and dust.

2044
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:59,375
You have been escaping until now
since I don't know your real name.

2045
02:38:59,458 --> 02:39:02,292
-This is Vinod, Pradeep's friend.
-Hello. Interesting.

2046
02:39:02,375 --> 02:39:03,417
<i>What's wrong with his voice?</i>

2047
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:05,000
But now, I know who you are.

2048
02:39:05,583 --> 02:39:06,750
You are Dr. Indran.

2049
02:39:07,917 --> 02:39:12,083
The one who killed all his
patients in the name of treatment.

2050
02:39:12,708 --> 02:39:13,875
You call yourself a doctor?

2051
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:15,792
Shame on you!

2052
02:39:15,875 --> 02:39:19,208
<i>What I did is not, "killing"
but "social sterilization".</i>

2053
02:39:19,917 --> 02:39:22,333
<i>You guys are nothing
but a menace to this society.</i>

2054
02:39:22,417 --> 02:39:24,417
<i>Scums that resort to anything
from rape to murder and</i>

2055
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:27,792
<i>get certified as mentally
ill and walk Scot-free.</i>

2056
02:39:27,875 --> 02:39:30,708
<i>You think your crimes could be
washed away that easily?</i>

2057
02:39:30,792 --> 02:39:34,042
<i>That's why, I decided to
eliminate you all from this society</i>

2058
02:39:34,125 --> 02:39:36,125
<i>and visited each and
everyone's house, personally.</i>

2059
02:39:36,208 --> 02:39:38,417
<i>And gave them the
freedom they needed.</i>

2060
02:39:39,833 --> 02:39:41,583
<i>They deserved every bit of it.</i>

2061
02:39:42,083 --> 02:39:43,458
Who are you to decide all this?

2062
02:39:44,458 --> 02:39:45,500
How are you entitled to do this?

2063
02:39:45,583 --> 02:39:47,750
<i>I'm entitled as a victim.</i>

2064
02:39:47,833 --> 02:39:50,458
<i>I dedicated my whole
life for guys like you.</i>

2065
02:39:50,542 --> 02:39:52,083
<i>Dr. Indran is almost an idol.</i>

2066
02:39:52,167 --> 02:39:54,000
<i>But what did I get in return?</i>

2067
02:39:54,958 --> 02:39:57,667
<i>I lost my family, my
practice, my voice</i>

2068
02:39:57,750 --> 02:39:59,292
<i>and finally, my life.</i>

2069
02:39:59,375 --> 02:40:02,875
How are they responsible
for your accident?

2070
02:40:03,250 --> 02:40:04,583
<i>Accident?</i>

2071
02:40:04,667 --> 02:40:06,167
<i>How did you think I died?</i>

2072
02:40:07,042 --> 02:40:09,917
<i>Do you remember the day
you called me for an appointment?</i>

2073
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:14,167
-<i>Doctor, I need an appointment.</i>
-<i>Text me your address.</i>

2074
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:16,917
<i>Sorry, doctor, I don't have a cellphone.</i>

2075
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,542
<i>Then, tell me.
I'll note it down.</i>

2076
02:40:18,625 --> 02:40:19,500
<i>298…</i>

2077
02:40:20,125 --> 02:40:21,667
-<i>Jayalaxmi apartments.</i>
-One minute.

2078
02:40:22,375 --> 02:40:23,792
The signal is weak here.

2079
02:40:24,208 --> 02:40:25,333
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

2080
02:40:26,542 --> 02:40:28,000
<i>Go ahead!</i>

2081
02:40:28,083 --> 02:40:29,208
<i>47th street.</i>

2082
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:30,958
Which street?

2083
02:40:31,042 --> 02:40:32,208
<i>47th street.</i>

2084
02:40:35,542 --> 02:40:36,750
Yeah, go on.

2085
02:40:37,375 --> 02:40:38,417
<i>Anna nagar west.</i>

2086
02:40:39,583 --> 02:40:40,750
<i>Chennai 101.</i>

2087
02:40:42,500 --> 02:40:43,625
Yeah, okay.

2088
02:40:44,208 --> 02:40:45,792
<i>Doctor, my house is in the interior.</i>

2089
02:40:46,458 --> 02:40:47,417
A little hard to locate.

2090
02:40:47,500 --> 02:40:48,667
-Shall I--
-No.

2091
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:49,750
<i>Not necessary.</i>

2092
02:40:50,125 --> 02:40:53,792
<i>No matter where you are, I'll
certainly come to your house.</i>

2093
02:40:54,125 --> 02:40:56,458
<i>Eight o'clock. I'll be there.</i>

2094
02:41:06,875 --> 02:41:09,625
Yes! You only manipulated him
to kill himself, right?

2095
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:12,958
That's why he jumped
on you and died.

2096
02:41:13,833 --> 02:41:15,833
That's the justice you deserved.

2097
02:41:17,083 --> 02:41:18,875
What did the poor boy do to you?

2098
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:20,833
<i>He was indeed a poor kid.</i>

2099
02:41:20,917 --> 02:41:22,667
<i>The one that died was your friend.</i>

2100
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:24,083
<i>But the one who jumped on me--</i>

2101
02:41:24,167 --> 02:41:26,042
<i>I can't take this anymore!</i>

2102
02:41:26,125 --> 02:41:28,000
<i>It was the spirit of my other
patient who was within Pradeep.</i>

2103
02:41:28,333 --> 02:41:30,750
<i>He was the one who shot me
in the clinic and killed himself.</i>

2104
02:41:30,833 --> 02:41:31,792
<i>I survived</i>

2105
02:41:31,875 --> 02:41:34,292
<i>but his evil spirit
remained trapped in my clinic.</i>

2106
02:41:34,375 --> 02:41:35,917
<i>It's haunted.</i>

2107
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,042
<i>Here is the room key.</i>

2108
02:41:37,125 --> 02:41:39,042
<i>That's how Selvam came to my clinic.</i>

2109
02:41:39,625 --> 02:41:42,167
<i>And captured the
evil spirit in a bottle.</i>

2110
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:43,667
You can only control it
for only one <i>naazhigai</i>.

2111
02:41:43,750 --> 02:41:45,042
-<i>It went all wrong.</i>
-What do you mean?

2112
02:41:46,875 --> 02:41:48,458
-Die!
-<i>Selvam died.</i>

2113
02:41:48,542 --> 02:41:51,208
<i>That's when the spirit
escaped from the bottle</i>

2114
02:41:51,292 --> 02:41:53,375
<i>and was searching for a shelter.</i>

2115
02:41:53,458 --> 02:41:58,125
<i>Pradeep was invoking the spirits
in your room with the book you gave.</i>

2116
02:41:58,208 --> 02:42:00,000
<i>So, he possessed Pradeep.</i>

2117
02:42:02,542 --> 02:42:05,125
<i>The vengeful spirit came
into my life once again</i>

2118
02:42:05,208 --> 02:42:08,792
<i>as Pradeep, who
was already my patient.</i>

2119
02:42:08,875 --> 02:42:11,625
It's the same doctor we used to consult
previously, from Nungambakkam.

2120
02:42:11,708 --> 02:42:15,250
<i>While I treated Pradeep, I
didn't know that he was inside him.</i>

2121
02:42:16,333 --> 02:42:18,833
<i>But the evil spirit inside him</i>

2122
02:42:18,917 --> 02:42:21,583
<i>waited for the right moment
and exacted revenge on me.</i>

2123
02:42:21,667 --> 02:42:22,708
<i>That's how Pradeep died.</i>

2124
02:42:22,792 --> 02:42:24,333
Pradeep passed away this morning.

2125
02:42:24,792 --> 02:42:26,833
<i>But, you know what tops it all?</i>

2126
02:42:26,917 --> 02:42:28,750
<i>You are the origin for all these events.</i>

2127
02:42:28,833 --> 02:42:32,292
<i>It was you who gifted that
book to Pradeep on his birthday.</i>

2128
02:42:33,333 --> 02:42:34,875
Is that why you want to kill me?

2129
02:42:35,250 --> 02:42:37,333
<i>Even though it seems like a good reason,</i>

2130
02:42:37,417 --> 02:42:39,750
<i>there's one more thing
that you'd forgotten.</i>

2131
02:42:40,083 --> 02:42:42,792
<i>You were the one to
get my final appointment.</i>

2132
02:42:43,167 --> 02:42:45,083
Eight o'clock. I'll be there.

2133
02:42:45,167 --> 02:42:46,958
I was at your place by eight
but he didn't show up.

2134
02:42:47,042 --> 02:42:50,750
<i>In 19 years of my career, I've
never missed a single appointment.</i>

2135
02:42:50,833 --> 02:42:53,000
<i>How will I miss yours?</i>

2136
02:42:53,083 --> 02:42:56,417
<i>That's why I kept my appointment time and</i>

2137
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:58,458
<i>talked to you first,
at eight o'clock, sharp.</i>

2138
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:00,583
There's a bad news.

2139
02:43:00,667 --> 02:43:03,417
<i>You called to say you're
behind your friend's death?</i>

2140
02:43:03,833 --> 02:43:05,000
Hello, who's this?

2141
02:43:05,083 --> 02:43:08,208
<i>Like I used my voice
to control my other patients,</i>

2142
02:43:08,292 --> 02:43:13,208
<i>I kept talking to you and almost
brought you under my influence.</i>

2143
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:18,000
<i>But that wretched Selvam</i>

2144
02:43:18,083 --> 02:43:22,042
<i>stayed in your room and kept
helping you to find me in many ways.</i>

2145
02:43:22,125 --> 02:43:24,250
Someone spoke over the phone and
said you're in some sort of a danger.

2146
02:43:25,125 --> 02:43:27,042
I saw the number
dialing with my own eyes.

2147
02:43:32,375 --> 02:43:36,208
-That's what I want to know!
-Because, Selvam is here, in your room.

2148
02:43:36,625 --> 02:43:37,458
Wait.

2149
02:43:37,542 --> 02:43:38,958
Why should Selvam help me?

2150
02:43:39,500 --> 02:43:40,792
What role he's got in this?

2151
02:43:41,125 --> 02:43:43,500
<i>His role is deeper
than you can imagine.</i>

2152
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,542
<i>Where did you get the book
that you gifted Pradeep?</i>

2153
02:43:46,958 --> 02:43:48,042
The clerk hasn't turned up today.

2154
02:43:48,125 --> 02:43:50,667
Either come tomorrow or you can find
it yourself.

2155
02:43:50,750 --> 02:43:52,458
Okay, sir. Thank you.

2156
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:58,792
Sir, please leave the bag and go.

2157
02:44:08,625 --> 02:44:11,250
Sir, found the book you needed?

2158
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:13,000
No, sir, I didn't.

2159
02:44:13,625 --> 02:44:15,125
Come tomorrow.
I'll keep it ready for you.

2160
02:44:16,292 --> 02:44:18,208
-What book, sir?
-It is…

2161
02:44:18,625 --> 02:44:21,333
a Leo Tolstoy's book.
It's a good one.

2162
02:44:21,417 --> 02:44:23,500
-But, its name…
-Is it <i>War and Peace</i>?

2163
02:44:23,583 --> 02:44:25,542
Am I that dumb?

2164
02:44:26,083 --> 02:44:27,417
It's just a single word.

2165
02:44:27,917 --> 02:44:28,750
<i>Devil</i>?

2166
02:44:28,833 --> 02:44:31,125
Yes! That's the one.

2167
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:34,417
<i>You stole one of Selvam's
books from the Library</i>

2168
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:36,542
<i>and gifted it to
Pradeep on his birthday.</i>

2169
02:44:37,083 --> 02:44:40,625
<i>But, somehow Selvam's soul felt
responsible for the consequences</i>

2170
02:44:40,708 --> 02:44:43,250
<i>and stayed in your
room to protect you.</i>

2171
02:44:46,292 --> 02:44:48,500
<i>There were only two things
that ever mattered to him.</i>

2172
02:44:48,583 --> 02:44:50,333
<i>First was his house.</i>

2173
02:44:50,417 --> 02:44:52,917
Our house is the only thing I
have in my father's memory.

2174
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,833
How come your company's
board is hanging outside his gate?

2175
02:44:54,917 --> 02:44:58,000
<i>He somehow managed to
exact revenge and reclaim it.</i>

2176
02:44:58,542 --> 02:45:00,042
<i>Secondly, this phone</i>

2177
02:45:00,125 --> 02:45:02,750
<i>which he managed to bring
to your house.</i>

2178
02:45:02,833 --> 02:45:05,667
-Do you know whose phone this is?
-It belongs to Selvam.

2179
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:07,958
-Has it been replaced?
-It's an old model.

2180
02:45:08,042 --> 02:45:09,708
<i>Sometimes, I've even felt
as if someone picked my call.</i>

2181
02:45:09,792 --> 02:45:12,750
<i>I roamed around the
streets searching for him.</i>

2182
02:45:12,833 --> 02:45:16,667
<i>But he never expected me to take
control of his phone and talk to you.</i>

2183
02:45:16,750 --> 02:45:19,083
<i>Once he knew, he started opposing me</i>

2184
02:45:19,167 --> 02:45:20,708
<i>But he could do nothing about it.</i>

2185
02:45:20,792 --> 02:45:23,583
<i>You know why I'm telling
you all this, right now?</i>

2186
02:45:23,667 --> 02:45:27,000
<i>Since you've come to the right place,
you have to make the right decision.</i>

2187
02:45:27,083 --> 02:45:27,917
<i>Jump.</i>

2188
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,708
You can't do anything to me.

2189
02:45:29,792 --> 02:45:31,167
<i>What makes you so sure?</i>

2190
02:45:31,250 --> 02:45:33,750
<i>Have you gotten bold since
you're out of your dungeon?</i>

2191
02:45:33,833 --> 02:45:36,333
<i>Selvam isn't here to protect you.</i>

2192
02:45:36,417 --> 02:45:37,750
I'm already here!

2193
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:43,125
<i>Hey, Selvam!</i>

2194
02:45:43,208 --> 02:45:45,958
<i>Why do you keep coming in my way?</i>

2195
02:45:46,417 --> 02:45:48,042
<i>Why did you get inside him, you fool!</i>

2196
02:45:48,125 --> 02:45:51,083
If you can come out of dust,
then, why can't I get inside him?

2197
02:45:51,167 --> 02:45:53,167
Now, listen up!
Leave him and go away.

2198
02:45:53,250 --> 02:45:56,292
<i>Its not that simple.
He's the last person in my list.</i>

2199
02:45:56,625 --> 02:45:58,917
<i>My soul won't rest
until I destroy him.</i>

2200
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,583
That will not happen until I'm here.

2201
02:46:00,667 --> 02:46:03,750
<i>You couldn't save yourself!
How will you save him?</i>

2202
02:46:03,833 --> 02:46:05,917
Not me. It's you who saved him.

2203
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,250
He's not the same Vinod
who sought your appointment.

2204
02:46:08,333 --> 02:46:11,500
The old Vinod died the
moment he stood up against you.

2205
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:15,542
His life was in darkness, filled with
laziness, dejection and depression.

2206
02:46:15,875 --> 02:46:17,708
If only you hadn't
shown him what fear is

2207
02:46:18,042 --> 02:46:20,458
he wouldn't have come
this far in search of light.

2208
02:46:20,792 --> 02:46:22,458
<i>You're talking about light?</i>

2209
02:46:22,542 --> 02:46:24,000
<i>Have you ever seen it?</i>

2210
02:46:24,583 --> 02:46:26,667
I know nothing about light.

2211
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:28,667
But I know everything about darkness.

2212
02:46:29,083 --> 02:46:31,125
Darkness is the absence of light.

2213
02:46:31,208 --> 02:46:33,833
I was not fortunate enough to see
even one speck of that in my lifetime.

2214
02:46:34,167 --> 02:46:36,083
And it's because of you that he has
started realizing things.

2215
02:46:36,458 --> 02:46:38,833
Let this be one good deed,
done by you. Go away!

2216
02:46:38,917 --> 02:46:40,625
<i>You think I'll take orders from you?</i>

2217
02:46:40,708 --> 02:46:43,625
<i>If you try to help him,
I'll destroy you as well.</i>

2218
02:46:43,708 --> 02:46:45,208
<i>You're not aware of my power.</i>

2219
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:47,333
Can you drop a coin in a phone

2220
02:46:47,417 --> 02:46:50,167
dial a number and talk
to someone you love?

2221
02:46:50,625 --> 02:46:53,625
You can't! It's because now we
are nothing but voices.

2222
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,083
And that too only
until this phone is intact.

2223
02:46:56,875 --> 02:46:58,625
<i>Hey, what are you doing? Stop it!</i>

2224
02:46:58,708 --> 02:47:01,792
<i>Do you know what will happen if
you dismantle the phone?</i>

2225
02:47:01,875 --> 02:47:06,375
<i>You'll lose your connection with
this world and get lost into oblivion.</i>

2226
02:47:07,167 --> 02:47:10,750
It's better to be lost,
than to lose your path.

2227
02:47:10,833 --> 02:47:12,875
<i>Do you think everything
will change so easily?</i>

2228
02:47:13,375 --> 02:47:15,417
<i>Wait for another half an hour.</i>

2229
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:17,417
<i>you'll see the whole
city plunge into darkness.</i>

2230
02:47:21,750 --> 02:47:22,708
I don't think so.

2231
02:47:22,792 --> 02:47:24,792
<i>Hey, Selvam, don't!</i>

2232
02:47:40,375 --> 02:47:42,250
How many times should I
keep calling the customer care?

2233
02:47:42,708 --> 02:47:45,125
Why do you charge me every
month for a phone I don't use?

2234
02:47:45,708 --> 02:47:46,750
No need.

2235
02:47:46,833 --> 02:47:49,417
Just remove the phone and
refund my deposit amount.

2236
02:47:49,875 --> 02:47:51,250
Jobless idiots.

2237
02:48:18,208 --> 02:48:19,125
Pandiya!

2238
02:48:25,875 --> 02:48:28,667
Hey, Pandiya!
