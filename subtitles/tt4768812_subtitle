00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,503


3
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,158
...l keep my smallest dream before you.

4
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,068
“Hail Lord Hanuman.“

5
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,980
Stop!

6
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,980
Mallesha.
- Boss.

7
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,885
Fund collection
for Lord Ganesha festival..

8
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,322
...and Rajostava is also over..

9
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,959
"Someone has installed
Lord Bajarangabali statue.

10
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,860
There is something fishy.
I want to know what it is.

11
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:17,027
Priest! Come here!

12
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,995
When we were drinking here last night,
this place was vacant. - Yes.

13
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,100
Why have you now installed
Lord Bajarangabali statue here?

14
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,771
We have planned to build temple here.

15
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,611
We are also collecting
donations from donors.

16
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,851
Then the entire place will be occupied.

17
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,547
In that case, you will
pay us 30 percent from the funds.

18
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,750
We are not building
temple with ill intentions.

19
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,955
Before I abuse you, give us our share.

20
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,190
Otherwise, I won't spare you. Tell him.

21
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,790
You must not ask for donation money.

22
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,894
Priest, this entire world belongs
to God, why does He need money?

23
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,065
Our boss is asking
for 30 percent, give it.

24
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,974
Hey! You know He is a bachelor,
don't you?

25
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,912
As if He needs money
to gamble or visit cabarets?

26
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,145
Hey, mother, guru and god..

27
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,083
...this world exists because of them.
Don't commit sin.

28
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,087
God will never forgive you.

29
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:16,651
Priest, shut up. Other than in movies,
have you ever seen god for real?

30
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,896
I have seen.
- You did see..

31
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,488
...when you were drunk last night.

32
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:26,869
Hey! Advice the devotees
who come to the temple for oblation.

33
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,101
You sinner, if you take away
god's money, you will be destroyed.

34
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,009
He has been annoying me constantly.

35
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,172
Where is your god?
Call Him, I want to see Him.

36
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,683
Is He there?
ls He there? ls He here? Call Him!

37
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,276
Stop desiring to see god..

38
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,614
...if He comes,
you will die, you will be perished.

39
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,559
Kid, I have heard
the dialogue somewhere.

40
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,722
The mountain will tremble when he comes.

41
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,732
He will come tear opening the sea.

42
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:59,225
He will bring thunder storm along,
he will bring tornado.

43
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,771
He will surely come.

44
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,535
Boss, the dialogue is
from the film 'Bajarangi'.

45
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,203
I watched the film five times.
- Hey!

46
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:10,840
Not dialogue from the film 'Bajarangi',
it is Bajarangi himself who is coming.

47
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,545
Where are you, Bajarangi?

48
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:27,890
Hail Bajarangi!

49
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,617
Run! Boss! Let's go! Run!
- Run!

50
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:55,058
Lord, You gave your weapon
to destroy the enemies..

51
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,822
...and brought us eternal
success and fame.

52
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,295
Let your blessings
continue to be upon us.

53
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,106

miss the timing though I am late.

Mother, good morning.
- Good morning. - Here, have decoction.

104

Go wake up your father.
- It will be my next work. Yeah.

105
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,691
Good morning, dad.
- Good morning.

106
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,195
Though the sun shines on the window..

107
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,697
...l was wondering why our son..

108
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,755
...who brings brightness in our
lives hasn't come before me yet.

Good morning, Bharat.
Come on, wake up. Go swim.

115
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,181
I am doing it, brother.

116
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,719
You will gain reward only
if you do things at the right places.

117
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,011
What did you say?
- Let it be. Go swim.

118
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,080
Brother.

Thank you so much for reminding.
Okay. Bye.

125
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,704
Mother!
- What is it?

126
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,037
Happy mother's day!

127
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:48,239
Thank you handsome!
- You are welcome.

128
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,679
Mother, happy mother's day!

129
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,084
Thank you, sweetheart.

130
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,989
Madam, happy mother's day!
- Thank you, madam.

131
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,853
Mother's day!

132
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,492
Happy mother's day!
- I want to feed her!

133
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,871
Everyone is wishing on mother's day..

134
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,275
...why isn't my elder son not wishing me?

135
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,943
Has he forgotten or
doesn't want to wish me?

136
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,777
Monday is Lord Shiva's day.

137
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,216
Tuesday is Lord Ganesha's day.

138
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,981
Wednesday is Lord Venkateshwara's day.

139
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,613
Thursday is Lord Raghavendra's day.

140
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,088
Friday is Goddess's day.

141
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,819
Saturday is Lord Hanuman's day.

142
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,293
We perform veneration to
all the gods the entire week.

143
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,686
Mother is the only god who is visible..

144
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,657
...is one day enough in the
whole year to seek blessings from her?

145
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,873
Mother, when people are
asked about their house deity..

146
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,677
...they tell the names of all the gods"

147
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,573
...but when someone asks me
who is my house deity, believe me..

148
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,808
...l say my mother is my house deity.

149
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,916
When a mother gives birth to a baby,
the baby is born..

150
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,784
...but it is a rebirth for a mother.

151
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:16,931
Mother prays for us everyday,
every moment for our well-being..

152
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,233
...but we child disrespect her..

153
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,871
...but on some day,
we express our love to her..

154
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,633
...and some people say
our mother has grown old..

155
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,044
...we cannot look after her
and leave her in some old age home..

156
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:34,813
...but on a day like this,
they meet her and cut cake for her.

157
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,552
Is this what you call mother's day?

158
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,021
According to me,
the woman who gives life..

159
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,923
...should be loved more than life.

160
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,658
That's mother's day.

161
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:57,733
However, if the mother feels happy
if she is wished on this day then..

162
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,107
...happy mother's day, mother.

163
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,816
When you say such things,
they make more meaningful.

164
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,954
You are so right, son.
- Thank you, dad.

165
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,983
None of you have common sense like him.

166
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,195
Hello. Yes. Okay.

167
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,495
I will come along, wait.

168
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,570
Why wasn't I fortunate
to give birth to such a son?

169
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:36,144
Not only saying that,
don't even think about it.

170
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,210
He knows he is not our
son and we also know it..

171
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,889
...but he is still the
eldest son of this family.

172
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,859
He is my dearest son.
- Our son.

173
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,001
Okay. Just 10 minutes. I'll be there.

174
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,043
Brother! - Okay, I'll come. Okay.
- What is it? - Brother..

175
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,177
Brother, I want a help from you.

176
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,179
You want I-pad, don't you?
I'll get it in the evening, okay?

177
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,476
No, brother..
- Hurry up.. - Wait, I'm coming.

178
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,040
Here, you take whatever you want.
Okay, bye. - Brother..

179
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,811
Brother, those guys...
- Okay, bye. - Brother?

180
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,589
Brother, listen to me.
- Bye, see you. - Brother!

181
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,759
Hi babe..
- Hey, Sweetie! - Hi!

182
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,901
Scoundrels. They don't have
better work to do. - Hey, babe.

183
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,701
You want to come for a ride?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,674
Both the brothers are useless.
- This is not right, baby.

185
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,074
Isn't there anyone who
would make them see sense?

186
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,146
Oh god, she is looking at me, dude.

187
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,982
Oh, she's smiling at me, dude.

188
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,730
Hi babes" hi dudes"

189
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,033
Your English is bad
and western body language.

190
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,970
You show expressions of
a lover boy from your filthy face.

191
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,670
Please, speak two lines in Kannada.

192
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,646
Hey baby, we too celebrate it every year..
what is it called?

193
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,545
Kannada Rajostava.
- Yes.

194
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,978
What?
- Rajostava.

195
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,885
Shame on you. That is Kannada Rajoisava.

196
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,820
Hey, why are you becoming violent?

197
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,518
I am not violent or silent.
I am thinking about your next moment.

198
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,124
When you made mistake
in talking Kannada..

199
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,892
...Kanteerva entered here.

200
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:38,060
Hey, you don't know about me.
- Do you know about my power?

201
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,195
If you know our power, you'll get burnt.

202
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,263
Shut up. What power, will power,
heart power, money power..

203
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,167
...political power, or cable power?

204
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,240
May be your father was an
electrician before by climbing poles.

205
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,779
But the power I am talking
about is powerful than the power.

206
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,976
Mega power.

207
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,213
Powerstafls brother.

208
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,280
Who is it?
- One and only.. - Shivraja!

209
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,117
Hey, who is it? Who is it?
- Hey?

210
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,597
The entire Karnataka says..

211
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,495
...even you turn behind and see,
you'll also say" - Who is it?

212
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,029
Uncle, uncle..
I am sorry, uncle. - What?

213
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,234
Uncle? You? I'll not spare you!

214
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:22,070
Uncle, don't do that.. Uncle please!
Uncle.. - How dare you call me uncle?

215
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,705
You wear knickers
and put up a show here?

216
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,613
Sir, please sir.. please sir.
- Hey, leave me. Apologize to her.

217
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,148
Sorry, sister.

218
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,889
Don't try to act smart.
Just say, 'sorry friend'.

219
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,021
Sorry, my dear friend.

220
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,122
Lakshmi, you go.

221
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,963
Bye, brother.
- Bye.

222
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,101
Why? Why do you behave like loafers?

223
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,934
Sir, we are not loafers.

224
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,236
We all are decent.
We've come from a good family.

225
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,034
Sir, your sister misunderstood us..
- Hey! - Sir..

226
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,202
Look, you can't tease a girl..

227
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,112
"Show her your style
and fall in love with her.. - Sir..

228
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,740
Think about your future
instead of following girls..

229
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,685
...if your life is good,
girls will fall for you. Understand?

230
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,254
Okay, sir.
- Enough of chorus now.

231
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,717
Sorry, I hit you hard, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,058
Here, fix this wiper..
Okay? Bye, bye. - Bye, sir.

233
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,122
Brother, come here..
- I have an important work.

234
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,600
Give this file to the auditor. - Brother,
there's more important work here.

235
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,830
Father will scold me
if he learns about this.

236
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,997
No, he won't. - Give this file to him.
- You come with me.

237
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,698
I will come and meet father later.
Okay? - Brother, come, come.

238
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,243
Bharat, you are too much.

239
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,008
I had lot of work in the office.
You don't do any work.

240
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,554
Why did you bring me here?

241
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,489
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,085
I thrashed four guys
yesterday as the did the same.

243
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,597
Brother, they are loafers.
We are decent.

244
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,961
When I hit them,
they said the same dialogue.

245
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,023
Oh no brother,
we come from a good family.

246
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,569
Repeat, repeat.. repeat..

247
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,195
He said the same thing.
- Brother, one minute.

248
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,603
Hey, I will leave..
- Only one minute.

249
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,572
Leave me.
- Brother, my girlfriend is here. Look!

250
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,094
Oh no, she is my brother's girlfriend.

251
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,022
Is it her?

252
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,059
Not her, the one who's
getting down from the car.

253
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,266
Yuck! - What?
- I mean, that girl?

254
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,570
Who is this tall girl?
- Brother, she is not tall.

255
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,908
The one who's wearing a blue dress,
she is my girlfriend.

256
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,542
Forget about the blue dress girl,
who is she?

257
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,782
Brother, she is her friend.
- Move aside.

258
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,851
Brother..

259
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,835
“My life.. isn't the same.“

260
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,809
“Towards the sky, falling so high.“

261
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,816
“Why are you laughing?
Why are you killing me like this?“

262
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:17,685
"Since I saw you, the bulb went off.
- Lights off."

263
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,590
“My body was strong,
but it got weak when I saw you.“

264
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,755
“lf we become a couple, we'll rock.“

265
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,064
“Listen, twinkle twinkle little star,
you are my superstar.“

266
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,630
“I am your prince.“

267
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:41,201
“No problem, if you are a little tall.“

268
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:48,242
“No problem, ifl am in
your waiting list. No problem.“

269
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:55,589
“lf you give me some place in your
heart, I will sit in it for lifelong.“

270
00:21:56,048 --> 00:22:00,963
“My body was strong,
but it got weak when I saw you.“

271
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,594
“lf we become a couple, we'll rock.“

272
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,536
“Everybody listen to my long song.“

273
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,870
“I am lost and my heart is singing.“

274
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,967
“I don't want,
but still I am falling in love.“

275
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,842
“Shivraj Kumar has fallen for a girl.“

276
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:29,156
“lf you become a teacher in the school
of love. - You are my life, girl.“

277
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:34,028
“I will be the student
sitting in the front bench.“

278
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:38,728
“Sita belonged to Ram.
Geeta belongs to Shivu.“

279
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:46,106
“You belong to me. Come let's
eat ragi balls in the military hotel.“

280
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:50,944
“No problem.. - No problem.
- If you have a flashback.“

281
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:56,214
“No problem.. - No problem.
- If you make me as your ATM.“

282
00:22:56,275 --> 00:23:01,020
“No problem.. - No problem.
- If your parents reject me.“

283
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,586
“I will fall on their
feet and convince them.“

284
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:10,628
“My body was strong,
but it got weak when I saw you.“

285
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:15,503
“lf we become a couple..“

286
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,993
“I will become headphone for
your cell phone. - You are my, girl.“

287
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:43,727
“I will take a loan to pay your bills.“

288
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,568
“The girl of my dreams.
Enter into my heart.“

289
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:55,977
“You don't need a ladder.
We both will cross the river together.“

290
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,643
“No problem..
- No problem. - You are very fair.“

291
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:05,917
“No problem.. - No problem.
- You are an Arabian horse.“

292
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:10,688
“No problem.. - No problem.
- If you don't accept my love..

293
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,993
...l will come live on TV and cry.“

294
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:20,159
“My body was strong,
but it got weak when I saw you.“

295
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:26,540
“lf we become a couple. We will rock.“

296
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,774
Brother is sleeping.

297
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,841
Brother, does your heart feel like
the life has become colorful..

298
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,147
...and you feel dancing crazily?

299
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:41,021
No.. “Her smile, her face, that girl
was very beautiful“. - Superb, brother.

300
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,220
Brother, where did
you both meet each other?

301
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,025
On the road.. no..

302
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,623
Coffee Day, Mall..

303
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,294
Coffee Day? Hey! Hey! Hey!

304
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,696
She didn't see me.
- Brother, what are you saying?

305
00:24:55,761 --> 00:25:00,642
You are following her and she hasn't
seen you.. she doesn't know who you are.

306
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,540
Is it?
- My head!

307
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,808
The fielder caught the ball
and has gone out of the field..

308
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,110
...but there's doubt if he is out or not..

309
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,651
...ask me why.. - Why?
- What if the empire says, it is no ball?

310
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,888
I didn't understand.
- Me too, I said it in a flow.

311
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,619
Brother, you go and tell your
feelings to her. - Really? - Yes.

312
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,499
Brother, was this style
necessary for this scene?

313
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,090
Brother, are you going for a fight?

314
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,569
Be cool.. cool.

315
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,263
I will give you an idea.

316
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,099
Darling..
- Yes, sweetheart?

317
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,672
Do it.. - No..
- Brother, do it.

318
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,706
Hey.. I told you to tell the dialogue.

319
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,683
Is it?
- Yes.

320
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,758
Hey, I love you babe.
- I too love you.

321
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,560
You are upset with me and
you are telling 'I love you too' to him?

322
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,860
Go and clean the dishes.

323
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,228
This is called 'inviting
trouble for oneself'.

324
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,860
Brother, let's not do it here.

325
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,132
Let's go out and try..
- No, I won't.. - Brother, come with me.

326
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,209
You try to woo my wife..
where did you learn this from? - What?

327
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,839
What happened?
- Look there.

328
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,848
What took you so long?

329
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,823
Do you speak Telugu?
- Yes. - Brother..

330
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,085
...she speaks Telugu.
She doesn't know Kannada.

331
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,560
You can practice your dialogue here.

332
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,889
With her?

333
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,794
When you find a tape recorder,
don't look for a CD.

334
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:28,923
Play the cassette instead.

335
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,228
What cassette are you talking about?

336
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,629
Will you play it on A side or B side?

337
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,831
Whichever side. Wait here.
- Hey.

338
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,800
She is ready. Brother..

339
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,971
...you were saying something inside.
Now tell it in front of her.

340
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,838
Is it?
- Yes.

341
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,077
Sun, the moon,
the rainbow in the sky.. - Oh god.

342
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,512
...nothing more beautiful than your eyes.

343
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,790
With everything else is a lie..

344
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,522
...you are the heaven which makes,
it's worst to die..

345
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,029
...in so many words,
if you don't find a clue..

346
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,825
...all I am trying to
say is you are my love.

347
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,298
She understood..
- Hold this for a minute. - What?

348
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:11,970
Twinkle twinkle little star..
how I wonder what you are..

349
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,905
Cassette got over. You leave.

350
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,980
Come later.. I told her to get spinach.

351
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,782
You idiot..
you said you will give a good idea?

352
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,048
No need.. I will think of something.

353
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,157
You go and change your dress.
- Go away! You idiot.

354
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:29,822
Did she leave?

355
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,763
Wow brother, you walk like Royal lndra..

356
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,500
...you look like Ragad Rudra..

357
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,542
...the goggles and suit
that you are wearing..

358
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,668
...you look like Rajnikanth's
movie 'Robot'.

359
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,271
Baba black sheep,
don't try to fool me.

360
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,780
Brother, what are you doing? If you go
wearing this, your lover will see you..

361
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,116
...and think you are cartoon
from the Pogo channel. - Why?

362
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,621
Brother, I will tell you one thing,
remember this.

363
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,156
Don't wear goggles after dark..

364
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,818
...and people with good
body shouldn't wear coat.

365
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,794
Remove your filthy coat
and law and parliament..

366
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,262
...to enforce it corporation
of cutting tea..

367
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,793
Go straight!
- ls it?

368
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,731
Yeah.
- Hold this.

369
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,466
Well done.
- Take this.

370
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,964
Superb. Brother, you are going..

371
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,871
...hold a bucket in your hand with style.

372
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,044
That's not bucket, it is bouquet. Move.
- Did they change the spelling?

373
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,548
Wow..

374
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,783
We shall work on those lights.
- Yeah.

375
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,860
Again, wow.

376
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,702
Can I get the menu card, please?
- l..

377
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,199
I an": sorry? - Will you get the
menu card? I need to place an order.

378
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,108
Hello? I need to place an order.

379
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,849
Oh no.. did she think I was a waiter?
- ls he alright? - Excuse me.

380
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,677
Where are you going?

381
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,654
I need to place an order.
- I finished my duty. I am going home.

382
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,453
Sir, I need to place an order.

383
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,924
What's wrong with him?

384
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:13,890
Oh no!

385
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,496
Brother, why did you
take idea from that monkey?

386
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,597
It is not my fault.
These girls are like red ants.

387
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,073
Sometimes they won't come
out even if you put sugar..

388
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,804
...but sometimes they come out when you
put pesticides powder. What can I do?

389
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,744
Finally, you liked a girl.
- I don't want.

390
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,181
You've grown old,
I don't know what will happen. - Father!

391
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,644
Not you..
I said we've grown old. - Okay.

392
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,688
We can see that on your faces.

393
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,658
Hey! - I said,
no one can guess your age. - Okay.

394
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:43,751
Slip of my tongue.

395
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,694
Your brother told me
everything about that girl.

396
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,163
He even showed her photo to us. - l..

397
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,894
<i>She is, my friend and business partner,
RK Rae's daughter.</i>

398
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,228
I've invited them for our wedding
anniversary tomorrow.

399
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,129
They are coming here.

400
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,035
When they come here,
we'll talk about marriage.

401
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,835
Give me the chocolate.
- Yeah!

402
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,939
Mother..

403
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,584
Brother, are you out of your mind?

404
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,277
If your girlfriend sees
you holding these glasses.

405
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,647
"She'll think you are a supplier.

406
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,691
Oh my god..
- She is coming.

407
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,283
Where?
- There.

408
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,073
Welcome Mr. Ra. - Happy anniversary.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

409
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,779
My son, Veeraj. My friend, Mr. Ra.
- Hello. - Hello.

410
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,321
Lalitha..
- Greetings. - And my daughter..

411
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,749
Geeta.

412
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,819
I really liked your name.

413
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,817
Excuse me for a minute.
I'll be back. Okay?

414
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,695
I've seen you somewhere.

415
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,857
She has a good memory power.

416
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,629
Wait a minute.. wait a minute..

417
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,029
In the coffee shop.
Isn't it? Right? Yes!

418
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,733
Actually the thing is..
I wore that dress without realizing.

419
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,172
I didn't know that waiters
wear same kind of dress in that hotel.

420
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,078
Oh I am sorry, sorry, sorry..

421
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,277
I misunderstood you as waiter.
I am really sorry.

422
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:16,913
Come on.
- Please excuse me. I am sorry"

423
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,183
Why are you apologizing to me
so many times? One sorry is enough.

424
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,923
Did you like the guy?

425
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,161
He is perfect pair for Geeta.

426
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,542
Oh Mr. Ra.
- Kulkarni?

427
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,603
What a pleasant surprise.
- Yes.

428
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,651
These days you are seen in every party.

429
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:52,815
A daughter's parents have
to attend party and functions. - Yes.

430
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,254
Tell me, which guy have you selected?

431
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,551
Look there..

432
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,155
Veeraj?
- Yes.

433
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,868
He is my close friend's son..
he is a very lucky fellow.

434
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,233
In fact, after he came,
my friend became wealthy.

435
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,077
He is a good guy.
Smart, well-cultured, and educated.

436
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,741
But poor guy.. he hasn't
seen his parents. He is an orphan.

437
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,549
My friend has one son..

438
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,216
...and one daughter.. but..

439
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:29,922
...he loves him more than them.

440
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:36,063
Though he knows Veeraj is an orphan,
he loves him more than his own children.

441
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:41,026
Even he.. loves them as his parents.

442
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,067
Veeraj is handling his
business and his health.

443
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,145
Your daughter is not only
good at general knowledge..

444
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,706
...but she has a good sense of humor too.

445
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,711
Thank you. - Mr. Ra, I need
to talk to you something important.

446
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,722
Tell me, Avinash.

447
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,987
We want to make Geeta,
the daughter-in-law of this house.

448
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,925
You just took words from our mouth.

449
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:10,191
We will take care of your
daughter very nicely. Are you happy?

450
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:15,705
We agree.. Avinash, before that,
please ask your son once.

451
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:19,266
Veeraj, what say? - Father, whatever
you say" - Avinash, don't get me wrong.

452
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,678
I told you to ask your son.

453
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,741
He is my eldest son.
- We are talking about your own son.

454
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,082
What are you saying?

455
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,781
One needs to see a good
family to make relationship.

456
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,556
We don't know which family he belongs to..
how can we make him our son-in-law?

457
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,185
You are crossing your limits!

458
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:43,024
One needs to see heart, love and trust
for a marriage.. - Don't get angry.

459
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,930
If the slippers are in the AC room,
can you keep them on your head?

460
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:53,770
Not only that, the dog that we buy,
we first find out which breed it is.

461
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,938
He doesn't know about his family,
religion, or even his initials..

462
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,307
...how can we make him our son-in-law?

463
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,981
If you utter a word more, I will
raise my hand on you. - Oh my god.

464
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,688
Hey, go away!

465
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,690
Hey, don't shout.

466
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,555
You wanted to build
relationship with us.

467
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,754
Hey, to hell with your relationship.

468
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,625
We don't care if you don't agree.

469
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,996
I don't give a darn, I say" You say
he is my adopted son. What do you mean?

470
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,864
Patient has come to his senses.

471
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,735
He is calling his eldest son.
Send him inside. - Okay.

472
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,941
Veera.. Veera.

473
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,973
Veera..

474
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:17,258
Veera, gO-- 9°!

475
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,027
What are you thinking, Veera?

476
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,870
Brother, somebody came..

477
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,731
...and said you are an orphan,
why do you believe them?

478
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,774
Brother, those who don't have
parents are not called orphans..

479
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,909
...the one who don't value
their parents are called as orphans.

480
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:43,981
Have we ever told you
that you are not our brother?

481
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,980
Since we have born and grown up..

482
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,524
...you are the only one
who we called as brother.

483
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:55,564
No matter who says what,
you are the eldest son of our family.

484
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,660
For instance, I or Lakshmi..

485
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,027
...if we are not there,
father will tolerate..

486
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:07,267
...but if you are not there,
father won't live.

487
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,013
Brother, go.. go and meet father.

488
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,949
Go.. Go brother..
- Go, Veeru.

489
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,540
Father, what is this?

490
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:21,744
You took tension for a petty matter
seriously and you are lying in ICU.

491
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,786
I can't believe it. The doctor said"

492
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:29,015
...he is fit and fine.. this might
have occurred because of office pressure.

493
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,595
You don't worry.. hereafter,
I will handle the officer work.

494
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,262
From tomorrow,
you come for jogging with me.

495
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:40,129
I will go to office.. I mean,
I'll go and pay the hospital bill.

496
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,068
You be ready.

497
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,582
Veera, why are you looking at the
walls and windows while talking to me?

498
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,215
Look into my eyes once and tell me..

499
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,656
...l will come with you right away.

500
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,235
Father..

501
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,876
Father..

502
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,817
Forgive me, father.. forgive me.

503
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,111
All this happened because of me.

504
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,650
You are my son..
eldest son.. you showed love on me.

505
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,162
I forgot that I was an orphan.

506
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,123
I expected more than my status.

507
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,260
You brought us up so honestly..

508
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,063
...why did you fall sick hearing
about the truth of my life?

509
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,210
What wrong did they say?
They said I was an orphan..

510
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,270
...that's true, isn't it, father?

511
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,508
Veeru, you are not an orphan.

512
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,518
I know.. I am not an orphan.

513
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,559
You and mother are with me.
How can I be an orphan?

514
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,962
No, you..
- Father, it's okay.. calm down.

515
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,995
You are really not an orphan.

516
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,170
Father, I am telling the same"
you and mother are with me..

517
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,934
Even if we are not with you,
you are not an orphan.

518
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,002
You have a village.

519
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,477
You have a family.

520
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,080
Your father is sitting
in millions of hearts.

521
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,949
...like a king, in the kingdom of love..

522
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,654
...he is a very good man.

523
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,789
You used to call me father so lovingly..

524
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:51,657
...but this sinner tried
to kill your real father.

525
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,933
'Jungle Kanive.'

526
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,201
People who live with
fear on the border area..

527
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:04,577
...it is hometown for namesake
but for the neighboring villages..

528
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,112
...it is a Lanka of demons.'

529
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,681
'Here law and government are slaves..

530
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,747
...and policemen are guards
for illegal businesses.'

531
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,592
'Every child born here
will live here and die here.'

532
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,222
'This is a custom that
has been going on for decades.'

533
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,731
The main occupation here is growing
chillies, that's only for namesake.

534
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,567
Dealing with illegal weapons
is the main business here.

535
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:42,109
No matter where crime takes place,
the boss is only one.

536
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:47,117
He is Havana, Kansa, Keechaka.

537
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,557
Huzur.

538
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:03,206
In Huzur's period..

539
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,707
...the two words called
love and intercaste marriage..

540
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,908
...were the reasons for
the deaths of many people.

541
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,104
Wherever intercaste
marriages were held..

542
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,616
...it used to get buried
under Huzur's feet.

543
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,108
Goddess Durga,
She was the deity of that village.

544
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,911
People here are so unfortunate that..

545
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:53,183
...they had no right to even
see the Goddess they were worshipping.

546
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,292
Amidst such people
who bowed down with fear..

547
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,561
...there came a man from somewhere..

548
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,591
...and he stood with his
head held high before Huzur.

549
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,865
He is Veera Pratap Simha.

550
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,227
Peace lover.

551
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,268
Huzur, whom should
I perform veneration for?

552
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,033
Even a cruel man like
Huzur had a weakness.

553
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,604
And that is..
- My daughter Lakshmi.

554
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:45,105
The entire Huzur clan lived for
bloodshed, enemies, revenge and death.

555
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:50,707
The surrounding villages
often waged attack against Huzur.

556
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,809
But Huzur was not only born
as a sword that beheads people..

557
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,782
...because Huzur is
someone who won over death.

558
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,736
Veera Pratap Simha..

559
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:53,773
...was a great man who had
put his life at stake for the people.

560
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,906
He visited every single
village and town..

561
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:01,280
...and provided help, education, taught
them about culture and tradition..

562
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,019
...he used to share
his knowledge with people.

563
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,551
Lakshmi liked his quality very much.

564
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:13,018
Because of the love that
Huzur had for his daughter..

565
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,725
...though the surrounding
villages were his enemies..

566
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,199
...he was still looking
for a in-house son-in-law.

567
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:23,604
But Lakshmi wanted to
marry a man with self-respect.

568
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:28,540
So, Lakshmi went after her
dream without her father's knowledge.

569
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,273
That self-respected
man was Veera Pratap Simha.

570
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,277
While leaving to the other
village after completing work here..

571
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:39,084
...Lakshmi confessed her love.

572
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,624
He was thinking about
accepting her as his wife..

573
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,952
...while the villagers told him
to save her from her father like demon.

574
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,866
Veera Pratap Simha who
was born in an ordinary family.

575
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,263
Without even thinking
about the consequences.

576
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,136
...he married Lakshmi
in Goddess Durga temple.

577
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:08,079
Huzur who lost his daughter,
lost his sleep and peace.

578
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,585
He made his men look
for his daughter everywhere.

579
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,179
All he heard was Veera
Pratap Simha's name..

580
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,657
...but he couldn't find him.

581
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,103
Father!

582
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,894
No, father!

583
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,741
No, father!

584
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,211
No!

585
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,933
Father!

586
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:12,160
Father. I very well know..

587
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,100
...that you won't spare him.

588
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:18,163
I beg of you, please don't
do anything to him before me.

589
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,734
I will feel guilty all my life.

590
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,939
Please don't do anything, father.

591
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,913
Please don't do anything, father.

592
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,711
Father.

593
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,847
Father.

594
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,901
Take him away and bury him alive.

595
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:50,904
Okay, Huzur.

596
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,752
And also kill the child.

597
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,754
Father, please don't.

598
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,723
That's my child, my life, father.

599
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,156
He is my blood, father.

600
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,888
Not ours,
he is this wretched man's blood.

601
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:18,194
Please listen to me. Let go, father.

602
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:26,167
Father, let go! Father!

603
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,114
Father.

604
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,716
He is the son of the great man
who gave life for thousands of people.

605
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,090
He is the son of the great man.

606
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,856
He doesn't deserve death.

607
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,761
What are you saying?

608
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:28,030
I don't know why, even since the child
came into my arms, I'm feeling guilty.

609
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,972
My heart is pounding.

610
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,833
For the first time
I have developed sympathy.

611
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:40,206
I'm feeling pity for this child. Don't.

612
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,311
Let it live somewhere
without Huzur's knowledge.

613
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:48,887
Hey! We are slaves! We will
be alive only if we obey Huzur's order.

614
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,957
If you cannot kill that child..

615
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,258
...give it to me, I will kill it.

616
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,828
No.
- Otherwise, I will kill him first.

617
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,984
Sir, don't be afraid.
I'm with you. Don't be afraid.

618
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,213
Hail Lord Hanuman!

619
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,984
Hail to the messenger of Lord Ram!

620
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,049
Hail Lord Hanuman!

621
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,254
Hail Lord Hanuman!

622
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:05,266
Please.. please save my child.

623
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,765
Sir! Hereafter, the responsibility
of this child will be mine.

624
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,502
Even if I have to put my life at stake"

625
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,010
...l will protect it.
I will protect it, sir.

626
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,510
Sir?

627
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,720
Veera, go.

628
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,985
Go. Go.

629
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,786
My mother..

630
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,030
...is she alive?

631
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,930
Tell me, father? ls she alive?

632
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:19,973
She probably must be alive.

633
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:52,640
“Is it good news or bad news?“

634
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:58,236
“I left to see the
surprise called mother.“

635
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:04,583
“A curiosity to see the brightness
that I have never seen.“

636
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:11,491
“I'm slowly crawling to your laps.“

637
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:18,156
“You are my life, mother.“

638
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:23,638
“You are my life, mother.“

639
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:30,145
“You are my life, mother.“

640
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,946
“You are my life, mother.“

641
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:41,579
“ls it good news or bad news?“

642
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:47,528
“I left to see the
surprise called mother.“

643
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,713
Rather than giving birth
to ten children..

644
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:10,843
...your mother has given birth
to a generous son like you.

645
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:14,019
She is really fortunate.

646
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:19,494
“Is it good news or bad news?“

647
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:26,626
“I left to see the
surprise called mother.“

648
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,169
Here.
- Don't you have change, sir?

649
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,765
Never mind, keep the change.

650
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,967
Hey! Idiot!
- Not that one!

651
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,070
Get away!
- Don't beat me!

652
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:15,982
I will beat you if I get angry!
- How dare you? Get away!

653
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,510
You rascal!

654
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,078
People in my hometown don't
offer water though they have it..

655
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,783
...you have no water in your village
but you still throw it on my face?

656
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,087
You idiot!

657
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,020
Boss!

658
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,129
Wait a minute!

659
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,189
Me?
- Yes, you.

660
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:36,102
I need your help. You look
like the king of this motherland.

661
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,070
Boss, hold this.

662
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,041
I need your help.

663
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:43,635
Help? - Please cooperate
for two minutes.

664
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:47,078
Cooperate? - Yes.
But you must not get angry and beat me.

665
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,683
Take a look for once, it is very good.

666
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,946
Please cooperate.

667
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,554
Hey!

668
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:55,680
Turn around.
- I told you not to get angry.

669
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,659
Take a look for once.
It is very good. Take a selfie.

670
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,156
Be honest.
Does you really expect me to look at it?

671
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:04,927
Boss, don't waste time.
There is no one around, please.

672
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,628
Please, boss.
- I will beat you to death.

673
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,566
Naughty. - Stay away. - Take a look for
once. If you don't like it, never mind.

674
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,503
Show it.
- Good boy.

675
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,669
Take it off.
- Take off what?

676
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,739
Take off my t-shirt.

677
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,983
Be careful, the belt is lose.

678
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,154
What is this?
- That's a big flashback, boss.

679
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,484
Tell me.

680
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:29,919
After my master got drunk..

681
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,153
"Instead of drawing the route
for the treasure on a paper..

682
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,718
...he drew it on my back.

683
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,889
Forget that. Tell me something.

684
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,490
The position that I'm standing in,
is it okay for you?

685
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,068
Yes, tell me.

686
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,231
Boss, Nagaland in the front,
Island in the middle..

687
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,137
...and Kutub Minar at the back,
can you see them?

688
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,774
Look at the map.
- Okay.

689
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,149
Boss, if you look a bit down..

690
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,253
...can you see two black rocks?

691
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:03,853
The secret route in between
the two rocks that is really wonderful.

692
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:07,552
Rocks? - No, boss!
- I will thrash you!

693
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:10,565
What have I done?
- Take the bag!

694
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,965
Stop! Get in!

695
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,467
Thank you, boss.
- Get inside!

696
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,999
He is cooperating.. Will you cooperate?
- Come inside.

697
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:21,236
Will you see it from here?
- Hey, I'll thrash you. Get inside.

698
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,876
Hey, something is pricking me. Oh..

699
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,608
Where have I got stuck?

700
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,710
He left his camera here. Hello! Hey!

701
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,683
Press? This idiot works for press.

702
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,061
What shall I do with this?
Okay, I'll keep it.

703
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:05,019
Hi.. You can leave.

704
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,069
Please, save me.

705
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,762
Who is that girl?

706
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,001
Oh god..

707
00:59:57,027 --> 01:00:00,565
Who were they? Why did I hit them? You..

708
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,238
Who are you?

709
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,277
Why were they after you?

710
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,777
I an": asking you.

711
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:29,298
They are demons. They don't
care whether somebody is young or old.

712
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,702
They don't spare anyone
whether it is six years old girl..

713
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,673
...or 60 years old woman".

714
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,903
...they catch them and sell them.

715
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,613
You came like god and saved me.

716
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,174
300 kms from here..

717
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:44,742
...is my village.

718
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:48,222
I will be with you till then.

719
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,089
I am going another way.

720
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,783
I am looking for my mother.

721
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,622
Please, don't refuse.

722
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:56,864
Let anything happen. Let's go.

723
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,897
Hey Bajrangi Bhaijan!
Come and have food.

724
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,232
Who told you my name was Bajrangi?

725
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,969
I got to know by seeing you.

726
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,102
Wonderful. Let's go.

727
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,771
Hey, come. Let's go and have food.

728
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,974
No..
- Why are you getting scared?

729
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,813
Iam not hungry.
- I am with you. So you need not fear.

730
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,874
No.
- Let's go.

731
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,585
Come on.

732
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,890
Listen, sit here.

733
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,194
Why are you getting tensed? I am here.

734
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,733
What happened to you? Are you okay?

735
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,569
Sir, tell me.

01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,775
...two stuffed breads, put some
butter on it, onions, green chillies"

739
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,646
...and a spicy buttermilk
with cumin seeds powder.

740
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,584
What do you want?
Why are you surprised? What do you want?

741
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,547
Give me two rolled breads.
- Enough?

742
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:58,615
Yes.
- Get two rolled breads for her. Go.

743
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:02,729
"O wind, spread fragrance everywhere.“

744
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:05,824
“You show me where the
girl with open tresses is.“

745
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,766
Eat soon" come on.

746
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,976
Forget it. This is common.

747
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:22,245
In Bangalore, if you go to MG Road,
commercial street, or Avenue road..

748
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,577
...all the girls are
using touch screen phones.

749
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,187
Don't take tension. Have food.

750
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,917
Do you want egg scramble?
- No. - I will eat it. No problem.

751
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,255
Look, some people are crazy
and some have wrong intentions"

752
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:39,830
...if they have wrong intentions,
they will try holding your hand..

753
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,267
...and if they try to do it..

754
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:48,235
...they will be out of their minds"
you eat.

755
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,153
He is here.. He is here.

756
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,133
They don't let us have
food in peace.. - Oh god.

757
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,821
My name is Shaitaan.
My work is to do wrong.

758
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:44,895
Who took away my girl?

759
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:47,526
Did you tell breaking news on the TV..

760
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,764
...or it was DD News,
I couldn't understand.

761
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,000
Boss, it will be better if
you talk in Kannada. I am a Kannadiga.

762
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:57,671
Who is this comedy piece?
- Okay.

763
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,770
Let's come to the matter seriously.

764
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,577
We all fight for her..

765
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,811
...stitches and hospital charges,
no need for that.

766
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,820
You want to touch her, don't you?

767
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,082
All Kabaddi champions,
welcome to the play ground.

768
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,624
Who will get whom, we all will do disco.

769
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,259
Who will touch her first?
ls it the boss or them?

770
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,020
No, no.. let boss touch her first.
Boss, boss..

771
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:19,625
...you touch her first.
Entertainment is yours.

772
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:25,635
Start. Kabaddi..
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. - Hey!

773
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,902
Kabaddi.. Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..
- Whatever you told about him..

774
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,841
...l thought he was a big fighter.

775
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:33,014
He is just a supplier.
- Kabaddi..

776
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:36,016
He is getting the girl to us.
- Kabaddi.. Kabaddi..

777
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,609
Take the girl with you.

778
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,920
Hey, wait! Wait!
Don't hit him in group. Don't hit him.

779
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,527
Baldy is fully confused.
Come on, countdown begins.

780
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:35,035
1, 2, s, 4, 5..

781
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,252
Hey, two people don't hit him at once.
- Hey, Baldy!

782
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,593
You haven't stopped counting yet?

783
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:45,506
Boss"
- Scoundrel, idiot!

784
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,803
You can't escape from us.

785
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,544
You are making an earning
by selling girls..

786
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:56,675
Scoundrel,
you have put hands in our business..

787
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,753
...and you are making our
people change our law? - Sir..

788
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,217
Sir, please don't.

789
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,018
This deal has taken place
after a wait of three years.

790
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,549
Just because he intervened
and we kill him..

791
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,722
...this issue will increase
and we may have to stop our business.

792
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:11,230
We won't get any money, sir.

793
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,558
I will keep him in
my custody for one week..

794
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,603
...and will kill him an encounter.

795
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:19,572
Sir.. sir, please don't shoot him.

796
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,507
Sir, leave him. Please.
- Take him!

797
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,909
Hey, you can do anything if
you are alive. Let's go.. Let's go!

798
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:34,713
Hey, who are you? Who are you?

799
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:37,651
He takes photo and publishes in paper.
He is from press.

800
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,153
I am not from the press.
- Stay quiet.

801
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:45,996
Boss, he is from the press. He has
seen everything that took place here.

802
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,092
It is not good to let him go from here.

803
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,969
We'll stop getting stuff from outside.

804
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,039
Hey, kill him.
- Sir!

805
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,077
We can't kill him.

806
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,004
I will be in trouble
if I keep him in my lock-up.

807
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:01,876
He is from the press.

808
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:07,684
Sir, until our deal gets over,
you keep him in your house.

809
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:11,489
We'll decide later whether
to kill him or leave him.

810
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:16,125
Hey, take him along.

811
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,064
Take me along.. you!
- Hey, stop.

812
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:21,602
He is from the same
village that you want to go.

813
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,194
It is better you go with them.

814
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,235
Is it? - Yes.
- You? - I will go.

815
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:28,801
Okay, I will come.

816
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:32,176
Hey.. hey, leave me.
- Hey, she is not related to me.

817
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,482
Leave me.
- She is not related to me!

818
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,997
Listen.. hey.. get down.

819
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,954
Hello, what is it? What happened?

820
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,174
Silence!

821
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,780
He is my grafldPa-

822
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:24,223
Hey, why are you sitting down?
- Oh no, sit down.

823
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,282
He will kill you.. sit quietly.

824
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,663
You handed over Kalia to the
police and now you are standing here.

825
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,624
You are not worth
to be called as my son.

826
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:37,830
The one who brought
me here was my uncle.

827
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:39,202
Hey, just look down.

828
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:41,765
I sent the lion to hunt..

829
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:44,107
...but the lion gave
the prey to the dogs.

830
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:49,683
If the dogs bark,
we should throw the bones at them..

831
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,716
...not our food.

832
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,857
Listen to me, sit down..
- Wait, I'll go and tell them hi.

833
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,858
No.. listen"

834
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,623
Huzur, forgive him.

835
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,629
He doesn't know about you.
- This is..

836
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,528
...the way of apologizing.

837
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:13,864
There's a ritual to touch Huzur's feet.

838
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,067
You see God in the sky..

839
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,039
...but on land,
you should see Huzur's feet.

840
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:22,802
Hey, which lane rat it is?

841
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,141
When we met Kalia, he was there.

842
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,205
He is from the press,
this matter shouldn't get revealed..

843
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,073
...so police ordered us to
keep him in the mansion.

844
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,145
Hey filthy press man!

845
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,079
Which place are you from?

846
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:37,684
Which religion do you belong to?

847
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:43,296
What about your mother, father?
Which gutter were you born from?

848
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:48,166
The one who doesn't know about his
family, you know what he is called as?

849
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,902
He is called as illegitimate child.

850
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,651
This village is small,
but the cemetery is big.

851
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:10,180
You won't know if someone
is sleeping or dead.

852
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,117
If you stay quiet,
you'll go out of this mansion"

853
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,026
...you'll be the only one.

854
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,793
If not, you will be buried here.

855
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:24,203
Hey Khende! He is your responsibility.
Put him in the dark house.

856
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:35,046
Oh no! You left me and went away,
darling.

857
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,276
Where's the guy from the press?

858
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,644
Will he come now or come on
the first death anniversary?

859
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,949
He is a vagabond..
Where will we find him?

860
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,048
Hey, you find the things that are lost.

861
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:47,651
Not our boss..
the one who comes violently is Rambo..

862
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,195
...the one who comes
with sound is Mogambo.

863
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,527
Brother!

864
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:07,274
Move aside"
I am Mogambo, director Dijango.

865
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,175
You can't cry for
the people who die daily.

866
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,809
Whoever applies powder,
I can't click everyone's photo.

867
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:15,253
My dear, my darling.. side please.

868
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,517
Where? Where's the body?

869
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,925
Looks like a flower has grown in fire.

870
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,656
It has got burnt so much.

871
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,064
Should I click his photo? - Yes, boss.
- Okay, I am ready. Are you ready?

872
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:29,169
Smile please" I am unable to focus.

873
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:31,698
Boss, remove the cover.
- Oh no.

874
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:33,968
Small mistake"
sorry brother, once more please.

875
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,533
I an": still unable to focus.

876
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,510
My mistake"
- Boss, we haven't brought the chips.

877
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:39,840
You drunkard.

878
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:43,142
Have we come here to drink liquor?
Nonsense.

879
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:46,749
Boss, the chips in
which we store photos.

880
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:50,848
Why are you shouting? I've clicked
many photos without putting reel in it.

881
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:54,884
Shut up, you dog.
I am ready. Sorry sir, sorry please.

882
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,195
Ready. Smile, sir.

883
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:00,030
Who is he?

884
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,865
Boss, he is Beral Naga..
- Beral Naga (Finger Naga).

885
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,605
Where did he put his finger?

886
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,175
You are very naughty.

887
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:18,084
Turn off the lights.

888
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:34,532
He's put his finger in
a hurry to consummate. Idiot.

889
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,730
Look here, if you are born,
you are destined to die..

890
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:40,774
...you shouldn't do
bad things in between.

891
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:43,671
His finger is burnt,
but why is his mouth burnt too?

892
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,838
Where did he..
- Boss, he is Beral Naga's wife.

893
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,609
Oh poor lady, she couldn't consummate.
I will go and talk to her.

894
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:53,711
Oh.. madam, please don't cry.
Calm down.. calm down.

895
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,221
So what if Beral Naga is dead..

896
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,781
...you can keep his hut.

897
01:16:57,847 --> 01:16:59,884
He has left many vessels, keep them.

898
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,930
He has so many acres of land, keep it.

899
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:06,756
Is that not enough, I am free, keep me..

900
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,859
What did you say?

901
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:13,938
You! - You scoundrel!
- Oh god!

902
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,499
How dare you!
- Hit him.. - Hey, leave me.

903
01:17:16,566 --> 01:17:18,512
Hit him.
- What did I say?

904
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,207
Keep me like your brother..

905
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,212
...l wanted to tell this,
when I took a pause, you all hit me.

906
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,180
YOu!

907
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,848
Boss, you can give
anything in this village..

908
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,219
...but don't give a pause.

909
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,221
Why?
- Hey!

910
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,893
I an": planning to marry her,
but you want to keep her?

911
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,022
Give me the sword!
- on!

912
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,674
He)!' filthy paper!

913
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:54,244
Me? - Yes.
- Come and have food.

914
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,240
Listen, come.

915
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,916
I am getting home
food for the first time.

916
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,795
Hey, go out!

917
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:20,470
Why?
- Cows and horses have food here.

918
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,839
Sit there..
- Here?

919
01:18:23,566 --> 01:18:26,137
When did you come?
- They won't allow us inside.

920
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,238
Come, sit.

921
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:32,678
You are very fast.
- Here, take this!

922
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,748
Couldn't he give it to me with love?

923
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:43,960
Oh, you've grown up like a glutton.

924
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:48,501
He's like a pumpkin. ls this
your legs or pillars of the mansion?

925
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,798
Hey poet, have your food.

926
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,134
Okay, serve me.

927
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:54,772
You don't bend down. - Why?

928
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,537
Get a shirt or a blouse
stitched for yourself first.

929
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:57,943
You just have your food. - Oh no.

930
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,810
He is bending. Bending..

931
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,607
Go away.. enough, you leave.

932
01:19:03,873 --> 01:19:05,511
They don't have sense at all.

933
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:08,847
I don't know if there are
good people in this village..

934
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,152
...but there will be rotten mutton.

935
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,796
You've been brought up lavishly..

936
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,469
...are you feeling bad
to eat food like a beggar?

937
01:19:24,694 --> 01:19:26,640
This is a temple where my mother stays.

938
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:30,772
People who come to eat the oblation
at temple are not called as beggars.

939
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:32,706
They are called devotees.

940
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:49,021
Hey, hey, don't go inside.

941
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:52,259
Oh, they will come. You come out!

942
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,564
Hey! Hey!

943
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,701
Listen to me, come out.
- Wait a minute.

944
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,245
You are not listening to me.

945
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:10,142
There's a thief inside the house.
Where are you?

946
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,549
They'll come inside.
- Leave me.

947
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,718
If they catch us, they'll kill us.

948
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:15,881
Listen, let's go.

949
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:17,820
Iam telling you.

950
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:20,989
Oh, please come.

951
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,550
Hey filthy paper!
Why did you come inside!

952
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,678
Actually, house..
photo.. - Go out! - Let's go.

953
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,975
Hey, go away!
If you ever enter inside again..

954
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:22,089
Why? What happened?

955
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:29,621
When everyone called me as an orphan..

956
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,861
...it used to prick me like a thorn.

957
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:39,797
But today.. after seeing my mother..

958
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:44,738
...the entire world
is in the word 'mother'.

959
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,213
I saw my mother face today..

960
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:53,210
...l am very happy.. Enough..

961
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,187
Enough for my whole life.

962
01:21:56,211 --> 01:22:01,217
True.. the one who doesn't have
mother knows the value of a mother.

963
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,959
Go inside and tell
her that you are her son.

964
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:07,926
Are you scared of Huzur?

965
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,131
I'm not Huzur's man to fear him..

966
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,236
...l'm the devotee of Lord Hanuman.

967
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:19,739
The anger in me and the
humiliation to my mother..

968
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:23,773
...and anger of my father's death,
if these three are combined..

969
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,584
...l will become a volcano..

970
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:29,885
...and will burn this
entire village to ashes.

971
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,117
That's not a big deal for me.

972
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:36,855
Hanuman who burnt Lanka..

973
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:40,626
...left Ravan alive,
not because he feared him..

974
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,660
...but because he had devotion on Ram.

975
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,736
If I tell the truth..

976
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,834
...there'll be bloodshed here.

977
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,041
I will have to raise
my hand on my grandfather.

978
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:55,806
My mother will feel bad thinking..

979
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,784
"She gave birth to such a son.

980
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:00,646
I don't wish to hurt her.

981
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:06,960
I will show mother's love to
grandfather, I will take my goddess..

982
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,591
...with me from here.

983
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,269
Hey, there's lightening.

984
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:23,075
There's lightening without the rain,
it means our Tikli is coming.

985
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:25,942
She would've known
that filthy paper is here.

986
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,270
He is dead now.

987
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:09,153
Hey, Matap and Pratap!
- Madam!

988
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:12,886
Somebody has come into this village.

989
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:17,727
Where there will be death,
either insects or I should be there.

990
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,892
If someone else comes here..

991
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:23,535
...l get irritated.

992
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:27,165
Who is it? Come out immediately
and stand here, if not, your body..

993
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,766
You idiot! Come out.
Come out. Come out.

994
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:32,278
I an": here.. I an": here.. I an": here..
- Oh god.

995
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:34,205
Matap and Pratap.
- Yes?

996
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:37,916
Who is this chilly chicken
in this red hot sun?

997
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:40,954
Is she the queen of any stupid gang?

998
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:45,091
I am not your cat.
I am a player of Karnataka.

999
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:48,824
Wherever I keep my feet,
our area begins from there.

1000
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:52,222
Wherever I see, our ruling begins.

1001
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:54,632
Understand? Better you understand.

1002
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:57,603
Hey, don't raise your voice. No English.

1003
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,537
Do you know who I am?

1004
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:02,266
Just by hearing my name,
bullet fires without a gun..

1005
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:04,533
...and the head gets severed
without the blade.

1006
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,671
There's only one lightening
of this chilly village.

1007
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:08,043
Rum Dun": Ragad Guthka
(Chewing tobacco).

1008
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,573
I am Pataka (cracker) Parvati!
- Oh no! - Why?

1009
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,052
You said, you were chewing tobacco.
That has been banned in our state.

1010
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,715
May be you don't know who I am.

1011
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:18,156
If I tell my name..

1012
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,658
...the fruits will fall from
the tree without hitting stone..

1013
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:22,093
...and you'll deliver baby,
without anyone touching you.

1014
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:24,722
Keep distance.. keep distance.

1015
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,790
I am devotee of Lord Hanuman.

Here it is, my game and my rules.

Madam, what are you doing?

1043
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,604
Give that to me.. If Huzur learns
about this, we are dead..

1044
01:27:13,629 --> 01:27:14,903
Madam, why did you come out?

1045
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:24,506
Won't you eat if I serve?
You want madam to serve you?

1046
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,109

Keep watching. Step by step,
I will unite with my mother.

Mother! - Give water!
- Water!

1053
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:21,105

Don't scream. I'm bringing.

...you talk about relationship?

1061
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:53,640
You will address people here as 'sir'.

1062
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:55,003
Sir, please let go.

1063
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:57,740
Call 'sir '.

1064
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,113
What will you call them?
- Sir. - What?

1065

Sir!

1066
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:31,137
I'm Mogambo, director Dijango!

1067
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,638
Are you the new person here?
- Yes, Veeraj.

1068
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:38,251

Why? What happened?

1071
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,491
It is a cruel flashback.

1072

Let go.
- Matap and Pratap!

1073

Who is he?

01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,754
He is Mogambo, director Dijango!

1075
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:55,962
Hey Dijango,
you will cast me in your movie.

1076
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:58,527
Madam will be the heroine.

1077
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:00,968
What happened? Why are you laughing?

1078
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:03,738
Look at our madam.

1079
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:05,836
She looks like Katrina Kaif.

1080
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,710
Look at her from this angle.

1081
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,248
She looks like Deepika Padukone.

1082
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:13,884
Look at her in the dark. - She looks..
- She looks like Sunny Leone. - Oh god.

1083
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:17,057
Your madam looks like Bombay heroine.

1084
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:19,149
Hey, stop mocking!

1085
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:20,618
I will hack you!

1086
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:25,858
...don't take me to be
Subash Ghai or Johnny Lever.

1087
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,798
I'm not such a big director.

1088
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:29,961
If I direct your film..

1089
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,062
...l will get release myself. I'm sorry.

1090
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,733
Give him some advance money.
- Okay , madam.

1091
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:43,106
Enough. The advance money is enough.

1092
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:45,751
I don't need payment.

1093
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:47,650
Sister, who is the hero?

1094
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:48,813
I'm the hero.

1095
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:52,885
Who laughed?
- The horse.

1096
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:54,721
Be quiet.

1097
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:57,662
Villain is more important for a film.

1098
01:30:57,853 --> 01:31:00,697
For putting me to shame..

1099
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,996
...l will torture him.

1100
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:06,067
Who is the villain?
- Veeraj!

1101
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:08,936
Please become the villain.

1102
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:10,670
I will become the villain.

1103
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,141
Sir! Okay.

1104
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,683
Director Mogambo is happy!

1105
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:20,652
But there is a small problem.
- What is it again?

1106
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:24,115
There are two guards
to keep a watch on me.

1107
01:31:24,513 --> 01:31:26,686
I can't come anywhere
without their knowledge.

1108
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:30,863
You don't worry, brother.
The two guards"

1109
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,263
...l will give them good
characters and trick them.

1110
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:37,035
They are your bodyguards
but you are my lifeguard.

1111
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:41,170
Director Dijango.
- Tell me.

1112
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:43,140
I spare you.
- Thanks.

1113
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:47,946
Oh god.
- What getup is this?

1114
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,244
Don't say 'cut' just say 'action'.

1115
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,744
I swear by your mother..

1116
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:54,583
...l will suck your blood!

1117
01:31:54,643 --> 01:31:57,214
Let's get started! Action!

1118
01:31:57,279 --> 01:31:59,759
What? It's a Hindi film?

1119
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:00,953
I can't give dates.

1120
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,622
It's Kannada, AK 77.

1121
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:07,193
Matap, Pratap.

1122
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:08,700
He is winking at me.

1123
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:12,000
He is hero, let him do anything.

1124
01:32:13,962 --> 01:32:16,568
Maptap, Pratap, he is trying to kiss me.

1125
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:19,009
Naughty boy.
He never missed the opportunity.

1126
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:20,171
This is too much.

1127
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:23,215
Madam, where you are standing"

1128
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,582
Stone? - No. G..
- Grass?

1129
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,781
No.
- Oh god. Hey!

1130
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:32,826
Take the gun and shoot him.
Am I right?

1131
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:35,285
That's even worse.
Shoot him, madam.

1132
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:40,830
He doesn't get scared at all.

1133
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:43,028
Ever since I was a child. Shoot me.

1134
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,230
Shoot me. Shoot me.

1135
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:55,011
Oh no! Madam, the director is
bleeding but he is still doing his job.

1136
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,311
Wonderful. Take position, come on.

1137
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,878
Shoot me here.
- Let go.

1138
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,945
Here! Shoot there!

1139
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:06,982
Shoot there!
- Hey!

1140
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:14,693
Director,
there's smoke coming from your mouth.

1141
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:20,129
If smoke is coming out from chimney,
it means the kitchen is on fire.

1142
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:23,500
0h god!

1143
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,009
It was already resting"

1144
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:31,539
...now, he put it to rest permanently.
- But you can't say 'cut'.

1145
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,051
Okay. Action!

1146
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,082
Matap, Pratap.

1147
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:40,219
Oh my god. He is creating the mood.

1148
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:43,694
Why he had to shoot me now?

1149
01:33:45,554 --> 01:33:46,760
Cut!

1150
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:49,735
Cut! - Madam is there,
you can't say 'cut'.

1151
01:33:49,891 --> 01:33:52,633
Adjust a bit.
- Cut! - Hey!

1152
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:53,999
Only action!

1153
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:56,142
Don't be shy.
- Cut! - Hey!

1154
01:33:56,164 --> 01:33:58,110
Madam is there, you can't say 'cut'.

1155
01:33:58,166 --> 01:33:59,907
Look at your madam.

1156
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:04,314
He is molesting her.

1157
01:34:04,573 --> 01:34:06,314
Oh my god.
- Director.

1158
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,847
What does it mean?

1159
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:10,856
I will tell you clear cut.
He is raping your madam.

1160
01:34:10,912 --> 01:34:13,188
Really?
- What? Oh my god!

1161
01:34:13,548 --> 01:34:15,255
Matap, Pratap, see here.

1162
01:34:15,517 --> 01:34:17,758
They are going for duet.

1163
01:34:17,819 --> 01:34:20,493
He might do something to your madam. Go.

1164
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:22,501

“Don't. Don't mess with a witch.“

1170
01:35:17,779 --> 01:35:22,194
“Don't. I'm the
lightening of the jungle.“

1171
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,094
“You are a naughty girl.“

1172
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:29,999
“You are a shrew.“

1173
01:35:56,851 --> 01:36:01,823
“Beautiful girl, come let's dance.“

1174
01:36:03,692 --> 01:36:08,198
“Naughty Bajarangi, I can't, get away.“

“Let me tell you something,
stop tormenting me.“

1178
01:36:23,545 --> 01:36:27,721

1181
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:40,905
“Damsel.“

1182
01:36:42,998 --> 01:36:47,037
“Damsel. My heart beats for you.“

1183
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,571
“My sweet naughty girl,
my sweet damsel.“

1184
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:18,235
“You drama queen, let's go outing.“

“I hate you, so get away.“

1186
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:31,219
“You are a damsel, I'm your man.“

1187
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:35,655
“Don't mess with me,
you will be finished.“

1188
01:37:35,717 --> 01:37:39,790
“I'm hero,
you are villain, I'm like a serpent.“

1189
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:44,064
“lf you mess with me, I will bite you.“

1190
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:47,129
“You are a naughty girl.“

1191
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,839
“You are a shrew.“

1192
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,755
Sir, whom should I
perform veneration for?

1193
01:38:18,026 --> 01:38:20,063
For my daughter Lakshmi.

1194
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,937
I want her to be happy.

1195
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:30,236
What happened?
- Nothing.

1196
01:39:30,498 --> 01:39:33,206
He is exhausted since he
was observing fast. Hold him.

1197
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:41,681
“Hail Goddess Kaali.“

1198
01:40:25,887 --> 01:40:28,800
Who are you? Why have you come here?

1199
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:31,064
We are here to kill.

1200
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:33,135
Who else is here?

1201
01:40:33,728 --> 01:40:39,770
Nobody. If we missed him here, there are
men waiting in the jungle to kill him.

1202
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,284
Guru!

1203
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:43,105
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1204
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:14,162
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1205
01:43:10,485 --> 01:43:13,796
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1206
01:43:32,273 --> 01:43:36,016
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1207
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:42,650
No! Not me! There!

1208
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:51,002
By now, there must
be mourning in the jungle.

1209
01:43:51,859 --> 01:43:54,703
By now, the dogs must
be ripping Huzur's body..

1210
01:43:55,096 --> 01:43:58,908
...and feeding upon it. Am I right?

1211
01:44:00,869 --> 01:44:02,849
The kingdom belongs to us now.

1212
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,851
Sage, lay the shells"

1213
01:44:06,007 --> 01:44:08,817
...tell me when I will get good luck.

1214
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:11,787
Tell me.
- Hail Goddess Jakkamma.

1215
01:44:12,947 --> 01:44:16,156
2, 4, s, s.

1216
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:21,123
No. Good luck was coming
your way but took u-turn.

1217
01:44:21,823 --> 01:44:25,236
Actually,
death is knocking at your door.

1218
01:44:49,984 --> 01:44:51,224
Get started. Quick.

1219
01:44:51,286 --> 01:44:56,065
Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Krishna!

1220
01:44:56,824 --> 01:45:00,203
Sir, if Huzur finds out,
he will kill me.

1221
01:45:00,561 --> 01:45:02,165
I have a family.

1222
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:06,705
I become greedy for money. Forgive me.

1223
01:45:07,035 --> 01:45:11,108
Forgive me. - The one who fears,
not only in this business..

1224
01:45:12,206 --> 01:45:13,981
...there will be no place
for him even in this world.

1225
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:18,957
You are trying to build throne in hell..

1226
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:20,924
...you are not an ordinary man.

1227
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:24,555
What is your relation with Huzur?
Who are you?

1228
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:27,166
Birth itself is an alms.

1229
01:45:28,022 --> 01:45:35,031
My father considered people's support
as strength, he lived only for people.

1230
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:38,806
My father is a great man who safeguarded
people putting his life at stake.

1231
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:41,910
To hunt animals..

1232
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:47,652
...we carry blood on ourselves,
ours is a powerful clan.

1233
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:52,751
I'm determined like Lord Ram,
powerful as Lord Hanuman..

1234
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:55,084
...for Goddess Sta..

1235
01:45:56,684 --> 01:46:00,131
...l'm Vajrakaya who has
come to shake the mountain.

1236
01:46:00,988 --> 01:46:02,695
<i>Vaflrakaya .</i>

1237
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:34,962
Tell him to come.

1238
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:01,789
Hey inspector, I have been living in
the well of death even since my birth.

1239
01:47:03,017 --> 01:47:05,258
I have written the deaths of my enemies.

1240
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:09,896
Death itself bows down before me.

1241
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:15,664
There's conspiracy going on around me.

1242
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,141
What is it?

1243
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:21,203
Huzur, no one can conspire against you.

1244
01:47:21,469 --> 01:47:22,846
No one has the courage.

1245
01:47:22,904 --> 01:47:26,010
Huzur, you have a power
which you are unaware of.

1246
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:36,519
That power is safeguarding you.

1247
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,668
Whether it is a traitor or your enemy..

1248
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:46,235
...no one can confront that power.

1249
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:53,601
Until you have that power, forget
humans, even demons can't harm you.

1250
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:59,548
The one who is safeguarding you,
protecting you..

1251
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:03,052
...is Vajrakaya, Huzur. Vajrakaya.

1252
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:09,016
<i>Vaflrakaya .</i>

1253
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:29,178
<i>Vaflrakaya!</i>

1254
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:46,828
We won!

1255
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:50,801
Yeah!
- Come on!

1256
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:54,495
Damsel. My dear flowerpot.

1257
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:57,901
Dear, your parents
and grandpa are there..

1258
01:48:57,965 --> 01:49:01,037
...and you are here?
- Get away!

1259
01:49:01,102 --> 01:49:03,582
For the people and by the people.

1260
01:49:03,638 --> 01:49:05,515
Madam, people are..
- Be quiet.

1261
01:49:05,573 --> 01:49:10,181
People's girl. For the people,
from the people, by the people.

1262
01:49:11,145 --> 01:49:13,216
Come on.

1263
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,054
Why? - Don't touch me.
- Why?

1264
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:18,118
Wait a minute. Touch me.

1265
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,894
Touch me.

1266
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,498
Touch me.

1267
01:49:26,793 --> 01:49:28,534
I suffered shock.

1268
01:49:28,595 --> 01:49:31,667
I'm power, I'm generator.

1269
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:34,976
Forget that. ls it a funfair?

1270
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:39,039
Our village..
- The game will get over.

1271
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:40,980
World cup of our village.

1272
01:49:44,612 --> 01:49:46,956
Local Olympics. Men's sport.
- Okay.

1273
01:49:47,014 --> 01:49:48,516
Then why are you here?

1274
01:49:48,582 --> 01:49:50,152
What did you say?
- Cool.

1275
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:53,165
Matap, Pratap,
which sport is this? Tell me.

1276
01:49:53,221 --> 01:49:54,962
I will tell you.
- Tell me.

1277
01:49:55,022 --> 01:49:58,003
The three heaps of sand there..

1278
01:49:58,058 --> 01:50:02,632
...the contestant must come
on the horse and poke them with stick.

1279
01:50:02,696 --> 01:50:04,801
No one can do it.
It is really difficult.

1280
01:50:04,865 --> 01:50:08,540
After poking them,
before crossing the line..

1281
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:10,947
...one has to hit that target.

1282
01:50:11,005 --> 01:50:13,076
No one has done it since three years.

1283
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,142
If anyone hits the target.

1284
01:50:15,209 --> 01:50:17,280
...he will become
the king of our village.

1285
01:50:17,545 --> 01:50:19,115
My grandpa will then give anything.

1286
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,683
Will he give anything?
- Land, wealth, money.

1287
01:50:21,749 --> 01:50:23,751
He will give anything.
- He will also give you our madam.

1288
01:50:23,817 --> 01:50:29,096
Give madam too?
- Yes. - Go. Go bring the horse.

1289
01:50:29,156 --> 01:50:32,626
Will you hit the target?
- Yes. - Will you hit the target?

1290
01:50:32,693 --> 01:50:35,936
Bring my Raja.
- Bring it. - Hey.

1291
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:38,273
Give him the wild horse.
He will see sense.

1292
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:41,972
Go. - What is it?
- Nothing.

1293
01:50:57,117 --> 01:50:59,097
What happened to this horse?

1294
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:41,039
My heart beat and your
heart beat are the same.

1295
01:51:41,729 --> 01:51:45,302
I hope you understand my struggle,
my pain..

1296
01:51:45,766 --> 01:51:49,612
...and my tears which nobody can see.

1297
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,048
God may have not granted
speech to animals..

1298
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:54,810
...but he has given
them hearts to understand.

1299
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:56,782
You need to understand..

1300
01:51:57,110 --> 01:52:00,091
...you need to support me.
Support me for once.

1301
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:05,553
I will tear into the wind
and hit the target like Lord Ram did.

1302
01:52:05,619 --> 01:52:11,501
Rama! Rama! Rama!

1303
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:13,698
Hail Lord Ram!

1304
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,006
As per the custom of our village..

1305
01:53:58,065 --> 01:54:01,672
...we give woman,
wealth and land to the winner.

1306
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,749
Tell me what more do you want?

1307
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:09,521
Will you give me anything I ask for?

1308
01:54:10,778 --> 01:54:13,657
Oh no, he will ask for me.

1309
01:54:13,714 --> 01:54:20,029
Rather than addressing people in
your house as sir, can I address them..

1310
01:54:21,121 --> 01:54:23,567
...brother, sister and mother?

1311
01:54:25,826 --> 01:54:31,742
Tell me. Can I address them as brother,
sister and mother?

1312
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:38,249
Tell me.

1313
01:55:01,795 --> 01:55:05,572
Oh no. Matap, Pratap,
let's go from here.

1314
01:55:05,632 --> 01:55:07,043
Oh my god.

1315
01:55:08,002 --> 01:55:10,107
Lift me.
- Come on.

1316
01:55:12,673 --> 01:55:14,744
Hey, come fast.
- Okay, go.

1317
01:55:15,142 --> 01:55:16,917
You could've asked for your mother?

1318
01:55:16,977 --> 01:55:18,854
The time for it has not come yet.

1319
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,255
I will win everyone's hearts first..

1320
01:55:20,514 --> 01:55:23,825
...and then I will surely
take my mother along. Come.

1321
01:55:27,488 --> 01:55:29,798
The game was quite exciting.
- I want to ride horse too.

1322
01:55:33,627 --> 01:55:35,800
Hey you, is your body aching?

1323
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:38,274
Not at all. By the way..

1324
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:40,503
...l don't see anyone around.

1325
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:42,012
Where is Huzur?
- He left after the game.

1326
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:43,946
Where did he go?
- What is it to you?

1327
01:55:44,004 --> 01:55:47,213
He expects us to tell him everything
because he won the game. - Go.

1328
01:56:00,888 --> 01:56:02,526
Mother!

1329
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:17,674
What did you say?
- Can.. can I call you mother?

1330
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:40,932
When you addressed me as mother,
I felt something inside my heart.

1331
01:56:43,063 --> 01:56:46,169
When I saw you,
when you came close to me..

1332
01:56:46,934 --> 01:56:48,971
...looks like you are one of us.

1333
01:56:49,903 --> 01:56:53,146
Consider me as your son.

1334
01:56:57,577 --> 01:56:59,147
My child..

1335
01:56:59,746 --> 01:57:02,920
...l lost him before
he could call me as mother.

1336
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:05,758
He is..

1337
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,928
...my own child.

1338
01:57:10,491 --> 01:57:12,835
Every day, every moment..

1339
01:57:13,927 --> 01:57:16,669
...l keep looking at my husband's photo..

1340
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:20,103
...but no matter how much I try..

1341
01:57:21,735 --> 01:57:23,976
...l am unable to see my child's face.

1342
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:29,013
Only once..

1343
01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:31,519
...l have to see him..

1344
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:34,024
...that's my only wish.

1345
01:58:08,782 --> 01:58:10,693
Hey, why did you come inside again?

1346
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:12,859
Brother, forgive me.
- Brother?

1347
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,194
Yes, brother..

1348
01:58:15,689 --> 01:58:17,965
Grandma, how are you?

1349
01:58:19,626 --> 01:58:21,731
Sister, how are you?

1350
01:58:21,795 --> 01:58:23,775
Aunt, how are you?

1351
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,104
Oh no.

1352
01:58:25,165 --> 01:58:27,202
I don't whether he'll address me
as elder sister or younger sister.

1353
01:58:27,234 --> 01:58:29,009
Madam, hide.

1354
01:58:30,771 --> 01:58:32,512
How are you brother-in-law?

1355
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:44,486
Why are you still angry?

1356
01:58:44,518 --> 01:58:46,054
Brother, I told you to forgive me.

1357
01:58:53,894 --> 01:58:57,068
I escaped from Pataka
and have crossed the forest.

1358
01:58:57,264 --> 01:59:01,906
I will go to Bombay and
become a director now. Oh god.

1359
01:59:05,939 --> 01:59:07,646
Who.. who are you?

1360
01:59:09,009 --> 01:59:14,516
Haseena..
- I am Paseena (sweat).

1361
01:59:14,815 --> 01:59:18,490
Is your mother AC
or OC (for free)? - Hey!

1362
01:59:18,552 --> 01:59:21,055
What did you say? - Looks like
you both are going somewhere.

1363
01:59:21,121 --> 01:59:24,728
Actually, we want to go
to Bombay and get a photo shoot..

1364
01:59:24,992 --> 01:59:26,767
To become a heroine?
- Yes.

1365
01:59:29,963 --> 01:59:31,943
You don't trouble yourself.

1366
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:34,478
I am the director.. yeah.

1367
01:59:34,534 --> 01:59:38,141
Yeah.. I was going there to direct
a movie, you came on the right time..

1368
01:59:38,205 --> 01:59:39,775
...and at the right place.

1369
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,151
I will give you a good life.
- Then, see soon. - See.

1370
01:59:43,176 --> 01:59:45,588
You silly girls.

1371
01:59:45,812 --> 01:59:46,950
Show me.

1372
01:59:47,948 --> 01:59:49,120
You naughty.

1373
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:51,788
Will you see?
- Show me. - You want us to show you?

1374
01:59:51,852 --> 01:59:52,990
How will we show you
without any sound?

1375
01:59:53,053 --> 01:59:54,999
There's always background music
in the movies.

1376
01:59:55,155 --> 01:59:57,260
Start the sound, action!

1377
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:07,140
“What's behind the blouse?“

1378
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:12,009
“What's behind the blouse?“

1379
02:00:12,806 --> 02:00:16,982
“What's under the scarf?“

1380
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:20,047
“My heart is in the blouse.“

1381
02:00:20,113 --> 02:00:22,684
“My heart is in the scarf.“

1382
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:25,025
“My heart is in the blouse.“

1383
02:00:25,085 --> 02:00:27,588
“My heart is in the scarf.“

1384
02:00:27,654 --> 02:00:34,299
“I will give my heart to my beloved.
To my lover.“

1385
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:39,201
The song was good, but it was too far.

1386
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,843
Isn't there anything new
that is in the front and down?

1387
02:00:47,674 --> 02:00:51,747
“My name is Sheila. Sheila's youth.“

1388
02:00:51,812 --> 02:00:56,625
“I am too sexy for you.
You can't get me.“

1389
02:00:56,883 --> 02:01:01,229
“No, no..
My name is Sheila. Sheila's youth.“

1390
02:01:01,287 --> 02:01:06,259
“I am too sexy for you.
You can't get me.“

1391
02:01:07,561 --> 02:01:10,770
For this Sheila,
I will take loan and make a movie.

1392
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:13,504
But you need to know Kannada.

1393
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:15,707
I know.
- Which one?

1394
02:01:39,059 --> 02:01:40,800
This is too good.

1395
02:01:40,861 --> 02:01:43,273
But a very high voltage song than this..

1396
02:01:43,529 --> 02:01:46,066
...don't you have it?
You have? Then play it!

1397
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:47,270
“Tornado.“

1398
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:50,044
“Tornado.“

1399
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:54,277
“Tornado.“

1400
02:01:54,541 --> 02:01:57,021
“Play the drums for this guy.“

1401
02:02:00,713 --> 02:02:02,215
Go where the wind takes you.

1402
02:02:02,582 --> 02:02:05,756
Iam going.. I am going.

1403
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,899
Hey, Matap and Pratap? It is you?

1404
02:02:10,957 --> 02:02:13,665
Hey, leave me.
- Hey!

1405
02:02:13,827 --> 02:02:16,706
You can't escape from our madam.

1406
02:02:16,763 --> 02:02:22,042
Pick.. pick..
- Hey, pick him up! - Please, leave me.

1407
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:31,890
Oh god.

1408
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:38,128
What's the matter?

1409
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:41,131
Aunt Rukmini who used
to serve food to Huzur died.

1410
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:42,664
She died?

1411
02:02:42,856 --> 02:02:44,199
Yes, brother.

1412
02:02:46,926 --> 02:02:50,738
Hey, grandma is alive.

1413
02:02:50,797 --> 02:02:52,071
She is breathing.

1414
02:02:52,666 --> 02:02:55,875
She is in the verge of dying.

1415
02:02:56,569 --> 02:02:59,641
She won't live. She will die.

1416
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:02,949
If she is breathing,
it means she is still alive.

1417
02:03:03,009 --> 02:03:04,579
Take her to the hospital.

1418
02:03:04,645 --> 02:03:05,589
She is your mother.

1419
02:03:05,645 --> 02:03:07,591
How long for the old man to die!

1420
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,857
Stop your old drama.

1421
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:19,962
Instead of giving her water or milk,
you want to kill her?

1422
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,239
Vardan, get the car.

1423
02:03:22,829 --> 02:03:25,810
Mother.. mother!

1424
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:29,105
Hey, cremate that old woman there!

1425
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:43,551
She won't live much..

1426
02:03:51,191 --> 02:03:53,000
Grandma.. grandma..

1427
02:03:53,727 --> 02:03:55,570
I an": a city thief..

1428
02:03:55,729 --> 02:03:57,231
...l met the doctor now.

1429
02:03:57,297 --> 02:03:59,106
Nothing happened to you.

1430
02:03:59,132 --> 02:04:01,578
Why did you save my life?

1431
02:04:02,902 --> 02:04:05,576
You are troubling yourself.

1432
02:04:05,738 --> 02:04:08,241
I will not live. Leave me.
- Grandma.

1433
02:04:09,543 --> 02:04:11,580
What happened to you?
Why are you giving build-up?

1434
02:04:12,012 --> 02:04:14,014
You have tonic for
your death in your smile..

1435
02:04:14,581 --> 02:04:16,527
...and you are making everyone cry.

1436
02:04:16,883 --> 02:04:18,521
Grandma, you are too much.

1437
02:05:49,142 --> 02:05:50,143
Mother?

1438
02:05:52,679 --> 02:05:54,750
Brother, how is this possible?

1439
02:05:54,948 --> 02:05:57,224
Even god cries for mother.

1440
02:05:58,117 --> 02:06:00,154
But He won't sit quietly like you.

1441
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:03,627
In anger or to explain you..

1442
02:06:04,056 --> 02:06:05,626
...parents tell everyday..

1443
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:08,767
...that you won't know their
value until they are alive.

1444
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:11,474
It is true.
You need mother to do household chores..

1445
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:13,234
...you need mother to
look after your children..

1446
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,907
...but you don't need her pain.

1447
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:18,039
I don't know if your mother
will be alive for 10 minutes"

1448
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:20,649
...or 10 years..

1449
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:22,744
...but hereafter every moment..

1450
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:25,680
...please take care of her.

1451
02:06:28,248 --> 02:06:32,719
Mother..
- When no medicine worked..

1452
02:06:32,886 --> 02:06:36,857
...his speech,
his encouragement, and his trust..

1453
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:39,092
...it brought me back to life.

1454
02:06:39,893 --> 02:06:42,271
He is not a common guy.

1455
02:06:43,229 --> 02:06:45,106
He is incarnation of God.

1456
02:06:45,565 --> 02:06:47,135
He is incarnation of God.

1457
02:06:49,502 --> 02:06:50,537
Brother..

1458
02:06:57,944 --> 02:06:59,582
Hey Matap and Pratap.

1459
02:06:59,779 --> 02:07:01,281
Why is your madam standing here?

1460
02:07:01,548 --> 02:07:05,655
For the first time,
you made me ashamed of myself.

1461
02:07:05,718 --> 02:07:08,961
Why? - My madam is three..
three.. - Three months.

1462
02:07:09,021 --> 02:07:11,126
I just touched her..
- Shut up!

1463
02:07:11,591 --> 02:07:14,037
Do you think my feelings
as comedy? - No.

1464
02:07:14,093 --> 02:07:17,836
I can hear engine sound
in my heart instead of heartbeat.

1465
02:07:18,097 --> 02:07:19,667
Will you hear it?

1466
02:07:20,901 --> 02:07:23,507
Come, come..

1467
02:07:27,674 --> 02:07:30,154
Even I hear engine sound.
- Hey! - Really.

1468
02:07:30,476 --> 02:07:32,956
Go away.. try to understand.
- Yeah.

1469
02:07:35,982 --> 02:07:39,759
Hey, what is this? - Our madam
has done everything. - Shut up!

1470
02:07:39,886 --> 02:07:41,524
Look, I can't tolerate it.

1471
02:07:41,587 --> 02:07:42,998
I an": telling you from the heart..

1472
02:07:43,056 --> 02:07:46,526
...you are the driver of
my life and the owner of my heart.

1473
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:48,605
Father of my children.

1474
02:07:48,662 --> 02:07:50,903
Totally, you are my lover.

1475
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:52,237
I love you.

1476
02:07:53,032 --> 02:07:54,705
Did you give so much
build-up to tell this?

1477
02:07:54,834 --> 02:07:56,074
I love you.

1478
02:07:56,236 --> 02:07:57,806
I love you too.

1479
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:58,746
Take this.

1480
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:02,520
You cunning girl.

1481
02:08:05,278 --> 02:08:06,655
Rhino!

1482
02:08:08,648 --> 02:08:10,650
Serve me food soon.
- Get up.

1483
02:08:11,451 --> 02:08:12,691
What?
- Get up, brother.

1484
02:08:12,752 --> 02:08:15,198
Brother?
- People like you shouldn't sit here.

1485
02:08:15,455 --> 02:08:16,593
You live here.

1486
02:08:16,656 --> 02:08:17,896
Brother, come inside.

1487
02:08:17,957 --> 02:08:20,870
You both have changed.
- Brother, please come inside.

1488
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,868
If Huzur learns about this..
- We know how to escape from him.

1489
02:08:24,531 --> 02:08:26,841
This place is not suitable
for people like you.

1490
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:30,105
Come brother.
- Get up.. - Brother, please come.

1491
02:09:01,968 --> 02:09:07,714
“My dear mother. My lovely mother.“

1492
02:09:07,874 --> 02:09:13,722
“My mother.“

1493
02:09:14,113 --> 02:09:19,791
“Keep me safe and put me
to sleep by singing lullaby.“

1494
02:09:19,852 --> 02:09:25,530
“I will tie a swing for you.“

1495
02:09:25,592 --> 02:09:31,008
“God has written you
in my destiny as a mother.“

1496
02:09:43,977 --> 02:09:49,689
“My dear mother. My lovely mother.“

1497
02:09:49,883 --> 02:09:55,856
“My mother.“

1498
02:09:56,256 --> 02:10:02,207
“My mother, live long.“

1499
02:10:02,262 --> 02:10:07,905
“Sing lullaby.“

1500
02:10:07,967 --> 02:10:13,849
“Shall I touch your feet
or ward off your evil eye?“

1501
02:10:13,906 --> 02:10:19,913
“You are goddess in my life.“

1502
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:25,895
“I am very fortunate
to have you in my life.“

1503
02:10:25,952 --> 02:10:28,694
“My life is complete.“

1504
02:10:28,755 --> 02:10:34,706
“You brought courage, patience..

1505
02:10:34,761 --> 02:10:37,640
...mercy, and love in my life.“

1506
02:10:37,697 --> 02:10:43,648
“I am the path of your life.“

1507
02:10:43,703 --> 02:10:49,847
“Mother, sleep on my lap.“

1508
02:11:13,666 --> 02:11:20,015
“Mother, will you sing lullaby for me?“

1509
02:11:29,615 --> 02:11:30,992
Veeraj..
- Yes?

1510
02:11:32,518 --> 02:11:34,759
What is it?
- Why are you delaying?

1511
02:11:35,187 --> 02:11:38,657
You've got everyone's
love and you've saved a life.

1512
02:11:39,025 --> 02:11:41,232
You've become the
happiness of this mansion.

1513
02:11:41,961 --> 02:11:45,534
Go to your mother and
tell her that you are her son.

1514
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:50,773
Tell her that you
are in love with Pataka.

1515
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:54,911
People love you,
so they won't refuse to accept you.

1516
02:12:11,958 --> 02:12:13,835
Whatever I said is final.

1517
02:12:16,763 --> 02:12:18,640
The alliance is fixed.

1518
02:12:18,697 --> 02:12:21,541
Don't fear.
Tell the chief of your village to come.

1519
02:12:21,701 --> 02:12:23,772
Make all the preparations
for the wedding.

1520
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:26,542
Okay, father.
- Go.

1521
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:34,286
Rhino, what's going on here.
- Brother, you won't know.

1522
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:37,558
They've looked for an alliance for me.

1523
02:12:37,617 --> 02:12:39,790
They say that the
wedding is in one week.

1524
02:12:40,152 --> 02:12:42,291
But I will marry only you.

1525
02:12:42,521 --> 02:12:44,967
Look, I have come
here with different aim.

1526
02:12:45,024 --> 02:12:47,732
Please, listen to me.
- I don't care.

1527
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:49,602
You became close to my family.

1528
02:12:49,662 --> 02:12:52,836
If you think you'll convince my grandpa,
that's your illusion.

1529
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:55,075
Just because his
daughter loved someone..

1530
02:12:55,134 --> 02:12:57,136
...he didn't think about his daughter..

1531
02:12:57,870 --> 02:13:01,545
...and killed her husband.
My grandpa is so cruel.

1532
02:13:02,008 --> 02:13:06,013
I don't have the courage
to live with my husband's memories.

1533
02:13:07,847 --> 02:13:10,191
If something happens to you..

1534
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:14,093
"This Parvati will lose
her life the very moment.

1535
02:13:14,587 --> 02:13:16,533
We both are leaving tomorrow.
That's it.

1536
02:14:48,514 --> 02:14:51,791
Who told you to do this? Tell me.

1537
02:15:14,507 --> 02:15:16,783
Veeraj, what are you doing?

1538
02:15:16,842 --> 02:15:18,788
He is my father.

1539
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:22,553
Are you out of your mind?
lam telling you, Veeraj, leave him!

1540
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:23,958
Please, leave him.

1541
02:15:24,016 --> 02:15:27,225
Veeraj, listen to me. He is my father.

1542
02:15:37,696 --> 02:15:41,143
We made a mistake by letting
this dog inside the mansion.

1543
02:15:42,001 --> 02:15:43,912
Hit him!

1544
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:51,852
No, leave him. Don't hit him.

1545
02:15:52,078 --> 02:15:53,580
Don't hit him!

1546
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:56,157
Leave him! Leave him.

1547
02:15:57,783 --> 02:15:59,091
Hey, leave him!

1548
02:15:59,151 --> 02:16:02,223
I knew this situation would arise.
You didn't listen to me.

1549
02:16:02,254 --> 02:16:04,165
They all are demons.

1550
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:07,727
They don't value love.
They won't understand our love.

1551
02:16:08,661 --> 02:16:09,867
Mother!

1552
02:16:13,833 --> 02:16:16,507
How dare you fall in
love with my granddaughter?

1553
02:16:17,002 --> 02:16:18,948
Kill him!

1554
02:16:27,513 --> 02:16:28,821
No.

1555
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:33,087
Don't do anything to him. Father!

1556
02:16:34,887 --> 02:16:36,696
Father..

1557
02:16:52,738 --> 02:16:55,116
Scoundrel! How dare you hit my daughter?

1558
02:17:33,179 --> 02:17:35,853
How dare you touch my daughter?

1559
02:17:36,949 --> 02:17:38,929
Father, don't.. father..

1560
02:17:39,618 --> 02:17:40,995
She is my blood.

1561
02:17:41,053 --> 02:17:43,158
I am here to take care of her.

1562
02:17:43,222 --> 02:17:44,667
Father, listen to me.

1563
02:17:44,723 --> 02:17:48,796
Who are you to show sympathy
towards her? You scoundrel!

1564
02:17:48,861 --> 02:17:50,704
For God sake, don't hit him.

1565
02:17:50,863 --> 02:17:52,740
Don't hit him!
- Grandpa, don't hit him.

1566
02:17:52,798 --> 02:17:54,835
I an": feeling very bad for him.

1567
02:17:55,234 --> 02:17:56,611
Father..
- Don't hit him.

1568
02:17:57,637 --> 02:17:59,810
Father, don't hit him. Leave him.

1569
02:18:00,539 --> 02:18:02,951
Father, when you are hitting him..

1570
02:18:03,209 --> 02:18:05,815
...it looks like I am losing my life.

1571
02:18:06,646 --> 02:18:08,819
If I hit him, you will lose your life?

1572
02:18:16,455 --> 02:18:18,992
A mother feels the pain
when somebody hits her own child.

1573
02:18:20,192 --> 02:18:21,694
What did you say?

1574
02:18:22,028 --> 02:18:24,235
A mother feels the pain
when somebody hits her own child.

1575
02:18:27,633 --> 02:18:31,604
You asked me which religion
I belonged to, who are my parents..

1576
02:18:35,207 --> 02:18:37,118
"This Veeraj was born in Rajgarh,
in Raj dynasty..

1577
02:18:37,176 --> 02:18:38,780
...with their blood flowing in his veins.

1578
02:18:40,179 --> 02:18:41,988
Father is Veera Pratap Simha!

1579
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:47,487
Your daughter is my mother.

1580
02:18:49,054 --> 02:18:50,829
She is only a daughter to you..

1581
02:18:52,258 --> 02:18:54,101
...the courage in my voice..

1582
02:18:54,894 --> 02:18:56,805
...the life in this body..

1583
02:18:57,095 --> 02:18:58,836
...the blood flowing in my veins..

1584
02:18:59,899 --> 02:19:02,004
...is given by my Goddess to me.

1585
02:19:02,535 --> 02:19:04,014
It is given by my Goddess.

1586
02:19:04,169 --> 02:19:06,080
She is my own mother.

1587
02:19:06,972 --> 02:19:08,952
She is my mother!

1588
02:19:16,582 --> 02:19:18,721
Veera Pratap Simha..

1589
02:19:19,451 --> 02:19:21,624
...is his heir still alive?

1590
02:19:23,122 --> 02:19:26,569
Their shadow shouldn't
fall on our mansion"

1591
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:29,963
...the same shadow has
come in front of me like death.

1592
02:19:30,529 --> 02:19:32,509
Kill him!

1593
02:19:37,937 --> 02:19:40,975
Father.. don't..
- Father..

1594
02:19:41,006 --> 02:19:43,953
Don't do anything to him. No.

1595
02:19:44,176 --> 02:19:45,655
Don't do anything to him.

1596
02:19:46,245 --> 02:19:47,952
Father..

1597
02:19:48,547 --> 02:19:50,720
Father..
- Father, don't!

1598
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:52,661
Don't!

1599
02:19:53,252 --> 02:19:54,993
Don't do anything to him.

1600
02:19:57,589 --> 02:19:58,795
No!

1601
02:19:59,591 --> 02:20:02,071
No, no..

1602
02:20:09,501 --> 02:20:10,912
Leave my daughter's hand.

1603
02:20:14,172 --> 02:20:15,947
What are you watching?

1604
02:20:16,809 --> 02:20:19,551
If your daughter is important for you,
it is the same for me too.

1605
02:20:19,945 --> 02:20:21,515
My daughter is important for me.

1606
02:20:23,782 --> 02:20:25,728
But the only difference is..

1607
02:20:25,884 --> 02:20:28,558
...like you, ours is not blind love..

1608
02:20:29,288 --> 02:20:31,894
...you killed your daughter's husband..

1609
02:20:31,957 --> 02:20:35,632
...and pray to God
that she should be happy.

1610
02:20:36,161 --> 02:20:39,108
You always wished that
she should stay close to you..

1611
02:20:39,297 --> 02:20:41,675
...but you never wiped her tears.

1612
02:20:41,934 --> 02:20:44,847
Your daughter became a
widow in front of your eyes..

1613
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:47,812
...you could tolerate it, but not I.

1614
02:20:47,973 --> 02:20:51,648
Not only that..
no father can bear to see this.

1615
02:20:52,277 --> 02:20:53,984
Even ifl had gone looking
in ten villages..

1616
02:20:54,046 --> 02:20:55,787
...l wouldn't have found a gem like him.

1617
02:20:57,115 --> 02:20:59,959
I feared that I may lose him..

1618
02:21:00,552 --> 02:21:02,930
...l tried to kill that girl.

1619
02:21:03,755 --> 02:21:05,257
I became selfish.

1620
02:21:07,593 --> 02:21:11,131
I will not spare the people who become
a hurdle in my daughter's happiness.

1621
02:21:11,730 --> 02:21:15,041
Whether it is my kin or my own father..

1622
02:21:15,767 --> 02:21:17,610
...l Will kill them.

1623
02:21:20,705 --> 02:21:21,843
Father!

1624
02:21:27,913 --> 02:21:31,156
“Hail Lord Hanuman.
Hail to the son of wind, Hanuman.“

1625
02:21:31,216 --> 02:21:35,665
“You are mighty. Ease us from burden.“

1626
02:21:36,588 --> 02:21:37,760
No.

1627
02:21:40,692 --> 02:21:42,603
I can't bear to see..

1628
02:21:43,095 --> 02:21:45,006
...anymore bloodshed here.

1629
02:21:46,198 --> 02:21:50,977
My husband was a godly man,
but he lost his life because of me.

1630
02:21:51,937 --> 02:21:54,577
My innocent child..

1631
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:58,544
...went away from me
and lost his mother's love.

1632
02:21:59,011 --> 02:22:02,925
If someone asks me what I lost in life..

1633
02:22:03,748 --> 02:22:06,319
...l have thousands of answers.

1634
02:22:07,686 --> 02:22:11,498
If they ask me what I achieved,
I have only one answer.

1635
02:22:14,693 --> 02:22:18,072
You.. my father.

1636
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:21,904
Father, I became a widow..

1637
02:22:22,034 --> 02:22:25,675
...and I endured so much
of pain in this mansion"

1638
02:22:27,005 --> 02:22:31,147
...l know that you have endured..

1639
02:22:31,209 --> 02:22:32,847
...much more than that.

1640
02:22:33,211 --> 02:22:38,183
Father, I could've killed myself..

1641
02:22:39,651 --> 02:22:41,653
...the day I lost
my husband and my child.

1642
02:22:41,887 --> 02:22:47,064
But I lived.. only for you.

1643
02:22:47,759 --> 02:22:51,730
The day you leave me,
I will die the very next moment.

1644
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:57,001
Father, I will not go anywhere.

1645
02:22:58,002 --> 02:23:01,575
All these years I thought
I don't have a son..

1646
02:23:02,807 --> 02:23:06,152
...but he is standing
in front of me today.

1647
02:23:07,579 --> 02:23:12,824
Father, I would like to
ask one last thing from you.

1648
02:23:14,219 --> 02:23:16,221
Just one minute..

1649
02:23:18,757 --> 02:23:22,534
...leave my hand. I will go near him..

1650
02:23:23,128 --> 02:23:25,506
...look at him..

1651
02:23:25,664 --> 02:23:27,905
...and I will come back.

1652
02:23:29,134 --> 02:23:31,580
Father, then you can send him.

1653
02:23:32,004 --> 02:23:35,850
For god sake,
please don't do anything to him.

1654
02:23:37,008 --> 02:23:39,511
Father, leave my hand for one minute.

1655
02:23:42,113 --> 02:23:45,754
I beg of you. Please, leave my hand.

1656
02:23:48,553 --> 02:23:50,226
Father, leave my hand.

1657
02:23:53,958 --> 02:23:55,835
Father, leave my hand.
