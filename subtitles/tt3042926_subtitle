00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,728
Attarintiki Daredi
<i> Which path leads to my aunt's house? </i>

2
00:01:15,393 --> 00:01:17,767
Who are you?

3
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,786
Leave me... leave me...

4
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,642
Do you've tissues?

5
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:46,059
First settle your issue.

6
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,393
Why did you bring me?

7
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,726
Didn't bring but kidnapped you.

8
00:01:58,642 --> 00:01:59,393
Why?

9
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,642
Why do we eat biryani?

10
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:01,809
For strength!

11
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,435
Why do we kidnap?

12
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,393
For money!

13
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:05,642
Unable to get the call through.

14
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,874
Till the man who engaged us
to kidnap you comes here,

15
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:12,851
please tell your story
to pass the time.

16
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:14,268
I'll tell if you give me phone.

17
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,309
You want phone?
Don't you want police station address?

18
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,143
Take it.

19
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:21,462
But don't make any call.

20
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,642
No SMS too.

21
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,976
He came to my home 3 months ago...

22
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:33,059
I thought he loves me.

23
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,059
I eloped with him.

24
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:38,017
But now he says he came
for my mother.

25
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,393
For mother?

26
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,642
Have tea.

27
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:46,334
Tell clearly.

28
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:56,309
This story started in Milan
3 months ago...

29
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,184
Where is it?

30
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,559
Italy!

31
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,059
Where is that?

32
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:10,393
Europe!

33
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,476
Where is that?

34
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,393
Do you want geography of
the place or my history?

35
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:19,226
Tell me.

36
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,435
There's a super rich family
known as Nandas!

37
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:31,184
There's an old man known as Raghunandan
in the 11th floor of that office.

38
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:53,976
Did you love him?
- I loved his grandson!

39
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,934
Is he rich?

40
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:57,642
Rs.1 lakh crores!

41
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,600
One lakh crores?!

42
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:01,767
How many zeroes?

43
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,851
You gang can settle down in life
if you sell his wrist watch, okay?

44
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,476
That's why he's so proud.

45
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:08,393
Do you remember ISF?

46
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,184
That's investment fund, right?

47
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:13,517
It holds 7% of shares
in our company.

48
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:15,393
A man known as Praveen Nalla
has bought it.

49
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,934
What does he want?

50
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,435
That chair, father!

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,559
Oh!

52
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:26,184
Tell him to buy spending 60 Euros.

53
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:28,684
He's buying our shares spending
100 millions.

54
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,600
Threatening, those who refuse to sell.

55
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:33,684
To tell the truth,
he's stooping down to hooliganism.

56
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:38,726
Whatever he may do, our family
holds 60% shares in this company.

57
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:42,726
40% only, father.
20% belongs to your daughter Sunanda.

58
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:46,809
She didn't any attend board
meeting in 25 years.

59
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,726
Didn't claim ownership.

60
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:53,059
That's why he started
buying our shares.

61
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,393
Talk to him.

62
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,767
He owns a yacht,

63
00:04:55,976 --> 00:05:00,976
he lives in it, neither he picks
calls nor attends meeting.

64
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:06,143
How do we catch him?

65
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:08,143
How is he getting our details?

66
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,268
To let in fresh air,
we open doors, father.

67
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:13,559
Dust too enters along with it.

68
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,851
Why don't you tell Gautham?

69
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,767
So many of us couldn't do anything,
what can a lone man do?

70
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:23,393
Hey, bullet is just half an inch!

71
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:26,351
But it kills a six foot man!

72
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:30,435
How would it be if the bullet
is six foot tall?

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,226
My grandson Gautham Nanda
is like that!

74
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,642
Raghu, no... Raghu...

75
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,517
Hey... ssshhh!
This meeting is over.

76
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:46,934
Hey... hey...

77
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,351
I am seeing him!

78
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,309
I got him!

79
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,017
Yeah, it's him... it's him.

80
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,476
He's unarmed.

81
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:04,726
He looks dangerous.

82
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,517
Go down... go down...

83
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,851
Hey, hands up! Don't move...

84
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:26,143
Don't move!

85
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,851
Crap! I don't know what happened!

86
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:01,934
Rewind and see!

87
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,059
Okay.

88
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,351
Do you think it's great
to kidnap me from my boat?

89
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:29,517
Do you think it's great to buy
my company's shares clandestinely?

90
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,351
You can get energy if you eat
the apple on your table.

91
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,351
But if you try to steal
another's apple,

92
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,642
look, you've to be brought
here by force.

93
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:42,976
May I ask you a question?

94
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,351
What do you get buying my company?

95
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,976
Happiness.

96
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:52,976


97
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:55,726
Yes, this is fear!

98
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,226
This is pain!

99
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,559
How would happiness be?

100
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,517
Find it.

101
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:06,059
Is it in money?
Is it in clubs with girls?

102
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,726
Or is it in the soap the girls use?

103
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,393
Till you find it,
don't ever dare look at us.

104
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,600
There's a chance you may find
happiness if you go searching.

105
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:21,600
If I kill you,
no one can find your body too.

106
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,017
Hey, don't play with mane of lion
because it is sleeping,

107
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:36,309
likewise don't dare get yourself
photographed with it.

108
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,726
Did you ask him,
what happiness is?

109
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:09,393
But, do you know
what my happiness is?

110
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,559
Umm...

111
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,726
All these chairs must be filled.

112
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:33,851
With my daughter, son-in-law
and granddaughters.

113
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:37,976
This room must get filled
with their laughter.

114
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:43,143
Then, my heart would be
filled with happiness.

115
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:47,143
In 3 months, I'll turn 80!

116
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I used to get a gift for you
on your every birthday.

117
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:03,726
Will you get me a gift this time?

118
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,017
Will you bring your aunt here?

119
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,268
Will you stand up?

120
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:11,767
Eh?

121
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,017
You've been restricted to
a wheel chair for 2 years now.

122
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,184
Will you get up from it?

123
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,309
You can't get up,
he too can't bring her here.

124
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,684
Hey...

125
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,017
You sent her away,
why are you shouting on me now?

126
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:31,184
Yes, I got angry since she married
against my wishes,

127
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:32,642
I sent them away,

128
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,393
now I want them back.

129
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,559
You've been thinking about her
for 25 years,

130
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,393
did she ever call you at least once?

131
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,642
She's a girl, she'll have pride.

132
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,559
I'm your son, father,
I too have anger.

133
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:51,226
We came here leaving motherland
to make him forget about her.

134
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,476
Where else can I take him,
so that she'll leave him alone?

135
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,851
Father... father... umm...

136
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,476
Father, like we're facing a problem,
a village got flooded,

137
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:10,726
a man started swimming to other bank
with his wife and children,

138
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:14,059
unable to carry the weight,
he dumped his wife,

139
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:15,976
then dumped his daughter,

140
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:18,435
lastly he dumped his son too,

141
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:20,642
he reached the shore alone,

142
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:27,143
but all his life, he thought of the
three people he dumped,

143
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:28,726
and spent his life in tears.

144
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:35,767
Whether it is luck or not,
we're still carrying him,

145
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:38,767
shall we dump him midway?

146
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:42,600
Or shall we carry the distance with
difficulty and live happily thereafter?

147
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,767
She won't come, it's your madness,
she'll not come.

148
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:54,767
Every year we send clothes,
jewels and flowers on her birthday,

149
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,435
they come back to us
withered and crumpled.

150
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:01,268
He shuts himself in his room
for 10 days disappointed.

151
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:06,517
Banging his door continuously,
my hands and heart have become hard.

152
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:09,934
We don't need her.

153
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,726
No need to think of her.

154
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,059
Father!

155
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:22,767
Father!

156
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:39,017
I got up!
I'm standing on my legs!

157
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,767
Will you bring your aunt here?

158
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:02,892
In search of cloud that
has migrated from sky...

159
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:08,268
The sky itself is going
to foreign...

160
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:15,435
In search of the rain drop
that fell from the peak...

161
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:20,851
It has left residence
to go into exile...

162
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:36,268
Is he mighty, archer, sun
or a demon?

163
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,435
He's a man of steel...

164
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,184
He's powerful lightning...

165
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:46,268
Is he protector or defender or
is he expert to test fire itself?

166
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,435
A strange war without an enemy...

167
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,184
A wound down deep in heart...

168
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:55,268
A walking courage...

169
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:59,642
An epitome of bravery...

170
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:06,226
A tough heart to take any poison...

171
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:09,476
He's a six feet bullet...

172
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:14,726
He's a rocket fired by courage...

173
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,851
Bill, please.

174
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,976
He paid the bill.

175
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,059
Thank you.

176
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:32,600
He paid for our lunch.

177
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:47,435
He's the sound of silence of
rays of fire that engulfs the world...

178
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:57,517
He's the unseen hailstorm
that lashes the earth...

179
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:07,226
He's the fury of rough sea
hidden inside a conch...

180
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,726
He's King Ashoka to
overcome sorrows...

181
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:15,059
He's a six feet bullet...

182
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:20,435
He's a rocket fired by courage...

183
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,600
He shows the place of origin to the
branches that left roots to grow...

184
00:17:55,726 --> 00:18:00,726
He shows east to the Sun which changes
direction to set in west...

185
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:10,393
Is he Ravana or Rama or
Krishna to win over hearts...

186
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,017
Is he a soldier or worker
or a man to do impossible...

187
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,393
He's a six feet bullet...

188
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:23,393
He's a rocket fired by courage...

189
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:40,268
In search of cloud that
has migrated from sky...

190
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:45,517
The sky itself is going
to foreign...

191
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:52,726
In search of the rain drop
that fell from the peak...

192
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:58,143
It has left residence
to go into exile...

193
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,268
This is Hyderabad, sir.

194
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:22,393
Traffic is too bad,
Goddess Peddamma Talli is famous god.

195
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,476
Sir, she's your aunt Sunanda.

196
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:29,851
She was thin earlier
but now little fat and strong.

197
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,642
He's your uncle Rajashekar.

198
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:36,393
He had curly hair,
got rich and lost the curls.

199
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,143
They used to have a 3 star hotel,

200
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:41,559
now they've a 5 star hotel,
which is running into loses,

201
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:45,351
your uncle is lawyer in court,
your aunt is the judge in home,

202
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,600
they have two children,
two brothers and two wives.

203
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:48,476
Eh?

204
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,726
I mean each have one wife.

205
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,517
Tell me about my aunt
not about useless things.

206
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,268
Without knowing these details,
how can you plan and take aunt home?

207
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,851
Rama planned to build a bridge
after reaching sea,

208
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,226
he didn't plan a bridge in forest
before coming to sea.

209
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,476
I didn't mean like that sir.
- Will you please keep shut?

210
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:06,435
For your good...

211
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,684
Why not just put a plaster
to his mouth?

212
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,268
Sorry boss, didn't get that idea.

213
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:16,393
Did you get hurt, Balu?
- No problem, sir.

214
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,017
Umm...

215
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:20,976
He says no problem,
what if anyone attacks me?

216
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:21,767
Eh?

217
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:22,726
Ummm?

218
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:23,934
That's okay, where's uncle's house?

219
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:26,309
It's in Jubilee Hills,
but he's in that bus.

220
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,517
That bus?

221
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,600
He's returning from Chennai.

222
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,226
Where are you going, sir?
- To follow.

223
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,393
Then?

224
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,017
Hey Balu...
- Sir!

225
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,435
Did I write any book on
'How To Bring Aunt Home'?

226
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,726
Just do whatever you feel like doing.

227
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:45,226
Is there anyone to receive us or not?

228
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:46,892
A new batch is waiting for us, sir.

229
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,143
Come.
- Come.

230
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:20,184
I want a car urgently.
- Car...?

231
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:26,684
Hey, that's my car!
- How much?

232
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:29,226
Is it taxi to ask about fare?
- What's the price?

233
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:30,934
Rs.70 lakhs!

234
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,017
Pay him, Balu.

235
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,059
What's this man?

236
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:37,600
Take American Express cheque
that's equal to cash.

237
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:38,851
Would I give car if you pay cash?

238
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,184
Should we give a warning too?

239
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,268
Taxi!

240
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,726
Thanks.
- Eh?

241
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,268
Sir!

242
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,059
What happened, sir?

243
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,017
I think he's having an heart attack,
need to take him to hospital immediately.

244
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,184
A small suggestion.
- What?

245
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:43,268
He'll die in 5 minutes, after that
your aunt would become a widow, right?

246
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,767
It's very easy to convince
a widow and take her home.

247
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,059
What do you say?

248
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:09,268
Rajarathnam, I need little time
to settle your loan.

249
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:12,184
Would 50 years be enough, madam?

250
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,767
I too have eyes,
I too can see angrily.

251
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,309
Be on the job.

252
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,476
I think we need some dignity here.

253
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:25,642
When you sought loan,
I want 10 crores and 25 crores,

254
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,351
you speak very well
in chaste Telugu,

255
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,517
when I ask you to repay,
you start speaking in English.

256
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,517
You build this hotel with my money.

257
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:34,559
They want us also to pay bill
for a coffee here.- Hello...

258
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,101
They'll not repay the loan.

259
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,184
Madam, your husband is
in James Hospital.

260
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:40,726
He had an heart attack.

261
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:46,059
Am I narrating Benhur film
as a ballad?

262
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:48,309
Why am I blabbering alone?

263
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:55,268
Jesus! Why should I lend money
and get hurt?

264
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,143
When good people are hurt,
they cry.

265
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,851
When bad people like me are hurt,
they'll make others cry.

266
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:05,559
I'll wait for the time she has
no kerchief and make her cry.

267
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,351
There's much better hospital
5 kms away from here,

268
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:41,309
why didn't you take him there?

269
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:44,767
Cemetery is just 2 kms away only.

270
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,351
Had he delayed by few minutes,
you'd have gone there.

271
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:49,517
He brought him here at right time.

272
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:51,268
You better thank him.

273
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:07,517
I expected she would
thank you profoundly,

274
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,851
but why is she holding collar
and scolding you?

275
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,435
If she's a person to pause
for a moment and think,

276
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,268
why would we come this far, Balu?

277
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,059
How are you now?

278
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,517
The man who brought me here...

279
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:33,351
Murthy!
- Madam!

280
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:36,517
Tell driver to bring
my briefcase from car.

281
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,017
Take a lakh from it and give him.

282
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:40,059
Okay, madam.

283
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:43,268
You gave up billions to live with me.

284
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:47,393
But today I'm still alive
because of that man,

285
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,976
can giving money show
our gratitude, Nandu?

286
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,559
Hello!

287
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:56,017
Madam is calling you.

288
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:56,851
Umm..

289
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,143
One minute...

290
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,435
Keep the phone on, you'll know
what I'm talking to them inside.

291
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Okay, sir.

292
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,726
Don't be sleepy, be alert.
- Okay, sir.

293
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:20,393
Your name?

294
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,851
Siddharth... Siddhu!

295
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:28,059
What do you do?

296
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,851
Call ambulance driver.

297
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:30,851
Driver, sir.

298
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,393
What's a driver doing in airport?

299
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,059
That is...
- My fiancé is in Dubai.

300
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:39,143
I was working in Dubai,
just now came to India.

301
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:41,351
Did you come for short period
or for good?

302
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:48,351
Actually, there was a fire
accident in the place I work,

303
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:53,226
actually I saved my boss Sheikh,
his wife and kids.

304
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,017
If you save anyone,
you must get a raise in pay,

305
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:56,600
why would anyone fire you?

306
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:01,184
Actually according to Dubai rules,
since I saw their women,

307
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:03,684
they said sorry and sent me away
spending as much money as possible.

308
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:06,809
Firing me as their driver
and send me away.

309
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:10,351
Without bothering about money,
send the driver away.

310
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:12,393
Why are you telling this
so many times?

311
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,517
To make us understand.

312
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:15,767
Driver!

313
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,226
Excuse me.

314
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,101
If you deliver this suitcase,
what would you get?

315
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,517
What else? I'll get salary this month
also as I get every month.

316
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:24,017
If you give it to us,
you'll get a 70 lakh worth car.

317
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,351
Why are you thinking?

318
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:27,476
You're talking
but not giving the keys.

319
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:28,726
Take it.

320
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,017
Take it.

321
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,351
Why did you bring it?
What happened to the driver?

322
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,017
He left the job.
- Why?

323
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:38,726
He said he would buy a 70 lakh car
but not work for you.

324
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,726
By the way, who are you?
- Patient on that bed.

325
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,226
Sir!
- Eh?

326
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,642
You can't have children anymore.
- I know.

327
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,851
I think he left the job for you.

328
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:59,393
If you don't have any objection,
you can join us as driver.

329
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:03,017
I'm in difficulties losing my job,
why would I've any objection, sir?

330
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:06,767
If you're in difficulties,
it's like Ambani is begging.

331
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,726
Appointing him without knowing
his credentials...

332
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,851
Murthy!
- Madam!

333
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,934
You're damn lucky!
Salary expectation?- As you wish.

334
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:25,435
To pay him, your entire family
must rob a bank.

335
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,017
Day after tomorrow is
auspicious day, join the duty.

336
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:30,600
Okay sir.
- Come.

337
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:31,642
Bye, sir.

338
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:39,435
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

339
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:46,934
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

340
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:54,268
He's enemy of demon King Ravana...
Most valiant Lord Rama...

341
00:28:56,435 --> 00:29:01,435
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord...

342
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:17,517
Like waves of fragrance of
millions of flower filling the air...

343
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:24,184
He moved like breeze with smile...

344
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:31,143
To move stones with the
wetness of warmth...

345
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:37,809
He came down like the
benevolent rain God...

346
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:43,059
He's sky, a never ending void...

347
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:46,393
Melting clouds are his domain...

348
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,767
He's the one who burns
down the differences...

349
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:52,684
His eyes are illuminating the world...

350
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,559
Protecting relationships
and lives are his forte...

351
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

352
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:12,017
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

353
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:19,517
He's enemy of demon King Ravana...
Most valiant Lord Rama...

354
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,559
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord...

355
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,059
Wow...

356
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:34,059
Morning, sir... morning.
- Thanks.

357
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:35,726
Why are you watching so intently?

358
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,517
They dance for us, right?
- Is it?

359
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:40,517
Bend your head... bend!

360
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:42,226
I'll pluck out your eyes.

361
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:43,934
If you're so possessive,
don't have daughters.

362
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,976
If you do, then don't teach
them to dance.

363
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:48,684
If they show it is glamour,
if we see it's vulgar.

364
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,976
People are taking our lives.
- Am I?

365
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,476
Madam! May I?

366
00:30:54,642 --> 00:30:56,059
Sure... sure...
- Thank you.

367
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,476
Aah!

368
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:01,143
Hey... hey...

369
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:02,101
What's this?

370
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:05,435
This is a home with girls,
why are you taking so much liberty?

371
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,268
Be careful.

372
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:12,184
You chide like this and get her
married to some sadist from IIT.

373
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:14,517
He'll use all his intelligence
to torture them.

374
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:15,393
You'll know then.

375
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,684
Who is he?
- He's...

376
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,934
I'm Siddhu.
- Nice meeting you.

377
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,143
Pleasure is mine, madam.

378
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:22,476
Why are you shaking hands with driver?
Leave her hand.

379
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:23,393
You come, madam.

380
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,184
It's okay!

381
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:26,435
Thank you, madam.
- So, cool.

382
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,435
Nice!

383
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,059
Your dance very nicely.
- Thank you... thank you...

384
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:32,726
Your eye brows were like
reverse Nike symbol,

385
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,017
you moved it fantastically
up and down!

386
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,517
Are you really a driver?

387
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,726
I'm...
- He's returned from Dubai, come sir.

388
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:42,351
You go.
- This way... this way...

389
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:43,143
Enough of seeing her.
- Bye.

390
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,059
I'm telling you,
9 to 5 is your duty hours,

391
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:46,393
Saturdays and Sundays are holidays,

392
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,559
no holidays for festivals
and no bonus too.

393
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,017
When madam presses this bell twice,
you must come immediately.

394
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,642
If she presses the third time?
- Another driver will come in your place.

395
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,351


396
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,017
Oh my God!

397
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:01,976
Can't you see a man falling down?

398
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:05,184
Why should you shake hands
with a driver?

399
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:07,684
You...

400
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,435
You won't long last.

401
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,184
Really?

402
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:12,393
Let me see!

403
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,642
Who is he?
- New driver.

404
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:21,226
Is it you who took my brother
to hospital?

405
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:23,393
He doesn't look like a driver.

406
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,268
So, use him for household work also.

407
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,559
What's the priest doing here?

408
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:32,143
Women have taken a vow to offer
prayer if brother comes home safely.

409
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,642
Give the list to me.

410
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:37,892
Incense sticks?
- Got it.

411
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:39,476
Flowers?
- Keeping it there.

412
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:40,976
Camphor?
- Got a kilo!

413
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:42,476
Betel leaves?
- Ready.

414
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:44,351
Coconuts?
- In store room.

415
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:46,600
Why are you looking at me?
Am I so handsome?

416
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,851
No... he said coconuts are
in room, get it.

417
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,517
Why are you looking perplexed?
Didn't get me?

418
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:53,017
Why are you still here?
Go!

419
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,642
Oil, nine grains, flower garlands,
well made list.

420
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,517
Don't know whatever I eat
gets stocked here!

421
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:15,851
Thank you.
- Welcome, madam.

422
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:19,059
What happened?

423
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:20,684
Who is he?
How could he enter my room?

424
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,684
Who asked you to enter her room?

425
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:25,059
You told me to get coconuts
from upstairs...

426
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:26,767
Coconuts are in store room.

427
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:29,017
He pointed the finger up...

428
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:31,684
Pointed up?
Will you go wherever I point?

429
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:34,268
I would show up for God,
will you go up there also?

430
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:38,517
Why are you making it a big issue?
Shameless girl!

431
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,017
He made the mistake,
why should I be ashamed?

432
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,184
Why did you do like that?
You appear to be a good man.

433
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:47,600
I didn't know putting zip is
such a grave mistake, madam.

434
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,934
If I hurt you so much...
I can correct it immediately.

435
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,393
How?
- How?

436
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,851
Like this!

437
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:56,642
Aaah!

438
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,559
Will you zip up and
down madam's dress?

439
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,642
Is she a mannequin in shop?
Get out... get out.

440
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,393
Hey... what happened?
- What am I to tell you, sir?

441
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,351
Your second daughter Sashi's dress,
he zipped and unzipped...

442
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,642
I can't tell that, sir.

443
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:08,476
He doesn't know
where the coconuts are?

444
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:11,059
He knows where my heart is, right?

445
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:16,726
There are girls in this house,
how could you behave like this?

446
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,143
Remove him.
- What's this trouble in prayers?

447
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:19,351
That's it, sir.

448
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:23,226
Whatever you may think,
he's not right for this home.

449
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:26,435
She's the one to decide
what's right or wrong to this home.

450
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:37,767
Fill up the tank.

451
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:51,017
It's like bringing home a snake.

452
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,059
What can we do?

453
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:53,017
Hello, madam!

454
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,642
You are...?
- Nurse!

455
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:55,600
Nurse?
- Yes.

456
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,017
I expected a lady as nurse.

457
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:01,393
Ladies are becoming
expecting mothers, so I'm here.

458
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,226
Are you disappointed?
- No, nothing like that.

459
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:07,809
Oh crap!

460
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:11,017
It's like a heroine taking bath in oil
and coming out without wiping it.

461
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,017
Use olive oil.

462
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:14,393
For lunch make omelettes
with egg whites only.

463
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,017
Add milk with spinach,
it's good for heart.

464
00:35:17,226 --> 00:35:19,017
Okay, what should I cook for you?

465
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:19,934
That list was for me.

466
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:21,517
How would I know what patient's
requirement is?

467
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:22,726
Please ask him.

468
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:24,517
Oh!

469
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,726
Why are you giving pose
like Pedarayudu?

470
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:36,559
Do you consider yourself
a big business magnate?

471
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,517
Why are you acting like a billionaire?

472
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:42,934
Why is he silent?

473
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,851
You don't have the
body language of a driver.

474
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:48,309
Do you know that?

475
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:53,851
Drivers used caps like this
in 1960's, sir.

476
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,642
In 1980's caps disappeared.

477
00:35:57,642 --> 00:36:00,184
Now they put caps on owners
and drive the cars.

478
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,351
Are they item girls to show bodies?

479
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:05,934
Where's the body language?

480
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,517
I've planned that too, sir.

481
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:11,476
NTR as driver in film 'Taxi Ramudu'!

482
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:14,642
Oh I see... get in...

483
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,726
Good day... good taxi...

484
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,059
I'll tell you the story
on the way, come...

485
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,600
ANR in the film 'Donga Ramudu'.

486
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:26,017
Drop the kids in school.

487
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,767
Driver is new, show him the way.

488
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:36,059
Who will pay the taxi fare?
Would your father pay?

489
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:39,059
You're a driver,
show some respect.

490
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,934
Get my luggage.
- Who is he?

491
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:43,517
He's Chiranjeevi.
- He's doing it very well.

492
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,351
He's not acting anymore, sir.
- Why?

493
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:46,809
His son is acting now.

494
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:48,268
What are you doing then?

495
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:51,435
I'll mix all this and fix it.

496
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,309
You get me ice pack.

497
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,851
Any progress in aunt's matter, sir

498
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,600
Very good.

499
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,226
If my uncle comes home drunk
every night and beats her,

500
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:03,934
she would cry for leaving her family,

501
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:05,351
but the matter here isn't that,

502
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,517
they've made her sit on
a golden throne!

503
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,726
Bloody progress!

504
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:14,017
Why would aunt or uncle come
if you act like driver or cleaner?

505
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:15,476
They won't come.

506
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:23,143
Do you've any idea?
- No...

507
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,809
Don't criticize without an alternative.

508
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:27,017
They'll get angry.

509
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:28,809
My uncle isn't keeping good health,

510
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:30,726
if he knows the reason of
my coming here,

511
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,184
won't he kick the bucket in shock?

512
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:33,351
I'm sure he would.

513
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,226
Is my relationship with aunt any good?
It's worse!

514
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:37,642
Won't she throw me out
if I tell her?

515
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:38,726
She'll surely.

516
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,642
I must tell her at
an opportune time, right?

517
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:41,976
You must tell at right time.

518
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:43,600
To tell her, I must be in
their home, right?

519
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,017
You must, sir.

520
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:47,851
To stay there, other than as driver,
what else can I do?

521
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,684
Nobody can do anything,
you've to be a driver.

522
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:52,143
Tell that to him.

523
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,393
Extra-ordinary, sir.

524
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,143
There's no truth in it.

525
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,559
I swear, sir.

526
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:59,517
There's no feeling in your praise.
- How can it be, sir?

527
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:01,726
Only fear rules in
situations like this, sir.

528
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,351
If you pass comments on people
who pay you salaries,

529
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:05,184
your live will turn
upside down, bloody idiot!

530
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:06,934
Got it?
- Got it, sir.

531
00:38:07,143 --> 00:38:08,642
Get the fool down.

532
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:13,934
I'm like a knife, I can cut
vegetables as well as necks.

533
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,809
I don't have emotions, only duty!

534
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:19,559
This dialogue isn't matching
this scene, sir.

535
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,517
Does Mephistopheles beard suit you?

536
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:24,059
Are we not tolerating it?
Shut your gob and listen.

537
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:25,309
Good night, sir.

538
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,976
Sir, this is your daughter's
Harvard application form.

539
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,976
These are bank account
statement details.

540
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:45,351
This is scholarship form.

541
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:48,476
I need 10 latest photos of
your daughter, sir.

542
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:51,184
Is it okay to give like this, father?

543
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,476
Why are you getting tensed?

544
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:59,476
I didn't commit any murder.
Just got married, that's all!

545
00:39:01,226 --> 00:39:04,976
Father, he's Shekar,
he did Master of Law.

546
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:08,268
He said he would die
if I don't marry him.

547
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,476
I threatened him that
you would die if you marry me.

548
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,226
He didn't get scared.

549
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,143
He asked I'm an ordinary advocate,

550
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:19,184
would your rich family accept
me as their son-in-law?

551
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:21,767
I told him my father too came
from ordinary family.

552
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,559
My father loves me dearly.

553
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:26,017
I told him my father wouldn't
say no to me.

554
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:29,351
He would watch like fool
whatever I do,

555
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:31,559
I don't give him a damn,

556
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:35,934
if you want, see it,
did you marry to show him this?

557
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,934
Father, that is...

558
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,642
I hugged you when you cried,

559
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,726
but if you go against,
I'll rip you apart.

560
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:45,976
Just got married...
just got married?

561
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:49,726
I'm planning to send you to Harvard.

562
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:52,767
Why did you make me stand here?

563
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:57,268
I wanted to make you sit next
to me in board meetings.

564
00:39:58,184 --> 00:39:59,767
But you tonsured my head cleanly.

565
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:05,435
I'm conducting a sacrifice
for your well being,

566
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,059
and you're taking my life here.

567
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:09,642
Father!
- Who is your father?

568
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:14,934
I hoped you wouldn't say a word
if I married him.

569
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:19,767
If you really had trust on me,
you shouldn't have come after marriage,

570
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:22,684
you should've come to me
with him before that,

571
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:24,435
you should've sought my permission,

572
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,184
I'll not accept,
you must make a plea,

573
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:31,559
it'll take a year,
2... may take 4 or 5 years also.

574
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:35,517
You must wait till then,
and then marry him.

575
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,642
That's what you should've done
if you really had trust on me.

576
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,851
Didn't you find anyone
better than him?

577
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,642
He can't even be an assistant
to a junior lawyer in my office.

578
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:51,684
Father, look from my side.

579
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:56,184
I can see future with him,
I can see a family!

580
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:57,726
I can see your ruination!

581
00:40:57,934 --> 00:40:59,517
Why don't you please listen
to her, Raghu?

582
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,184
He too is advising me because of you.

583
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:08,767
Go!

584
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,642
Go... go... go away!

585
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,476
What are you looking at? Go away!

586
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,435
Go!

587
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,268
Go!

588
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:30,642
I wanted to you to share my wealth
equally with my son,

589
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,934
you removed me like a speck of dust.

590
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:38,726
What's this, father?
- Stop the sacrifice.

591
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,476
I mustn't hear her footsteps
in this house.

592
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:45,393
I mustn't see her smile
on these walls.

593
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,851
Nothing she likes or her clothes,

594
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:54,559
her connection with this family,

595
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,476
her right to be heir of this family,

596
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,101
her blood relationship
with this family,

597
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:59,517
nothing must remain!

598
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,642
Remove it!

599
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:10,642
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

600
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:29,476
Sir, dust!
- No problem, Balu.

601
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:35,934
Looks like that male nurse has seen it,
what am I to tell him?

602
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:37,017
Let's tell him the truth.

603
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:38,393
He would understand it.
What's in it?

604
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,309
I can understand Telugu
very well, tell me.

605
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:46,435
Nothing, I'm not a driver
but Sunanda's nephew,

606
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:49,517
we own many steel factories
in Spain,

607
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,684
I'm here to convince my aunt and
take her to my grandfather.

608
00:42:52,892 --> 00:42:54,351
You like her elder daughter Pramila,

609
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:55,934
if she says yes,
you'd marry her too, right?

610
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:58,143
Am I right?
- Wow Guru!

611
00:42:58,351 --> 00:42:59,851
That's it.
- How could you?

612
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:02,351
Because I'm also a billionaire like you.

613
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:03,934
I sell plastics in France.

614
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:07,476
I've joined as nurse there to marry
their younger daughter Sashi.

615
00:43:07,642 --> 00:43:09,559
Wow! What a coincidence!
- What?

616
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,476
I mean coincidence!

617
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:13,976
That's why steel and plastic
have mixed so well.

618
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:15,143
Right, isn't it?

619
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,017
I'll beat you with slippers.

620
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:20,017
You'd have missed your bus,
he would've given you lift,

621
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:21,767
door would've got stuck,
he would've opened it for you,

622
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,726
seeing dust on your pant,
he would've dusted it.

623
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,476
For that why to lie about steel factories
in Spain and Sunanda's relative.

624
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:28,517
I'll get angry.

625
00:43:28,726 --> 00:43:31,059
I'm telling you,
you own this car,

626
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:32,517
you're their driver,

627
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:34,101
what I say is final!

628
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:36,143
Why are you dressed like
marriage band?

629
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:39,059
Change it,
I'm getting irritated.

630
00:43:39,268 --> 00:43:41,559
Why did he brush it off
as marriage band?

631
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:47,892
Did you get it now? The world never
believes if you tell the truth.

632
00:43:48,517 --> 00:43:52,184
Be brave, I'll go to work.
- Okay sir.

633
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:04,435
Madam!

634
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,476
Sorry, it happened unwittingly.

635
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:11,393
Actually Murthy, accountant Murthy,
he guided me wrongly,

636
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,351
it happened like that,

637
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,059
I'm really sorry... sorry.

638
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:18,226
You?

639
00:44:18,435 --> 00:44:20,642
Siddhu, your driver.

640
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,726
Look Siddhu!

641
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:28,351
If that chair hurts my leg,

642
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:31,393
taking a photo of the chair,
keeping it in my bedroom,

643
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:34,851
would I decide to take revenge on it?

644
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:37,726
Why would we get angry on chairs?

645
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:38,642
Isn't it?

646
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:40,351
You too are like that to me.

647
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:45,517
Why would I get into trouble with
chairs, sofas, drivers and servants?

648
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,726
Go... go, mind your business.

649
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:02,726
Aunty, geyser isn't working.
- I know.

650
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:06,517
Why?
- No power.

651
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:08,268
I want hot water.

652
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:09,726
Ready!

653
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:13,351
I'm in bath towel, send it up.

654
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:15,559
I'm working, I can't come now.

655
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:17,226
I'll not accept if you don't bring it.

656
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:19,268
Your husband will get it for you.

657
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:20,268
Eh?

658
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:25,809
If I had husband,
he'll not only bring water,

659
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,851
he would apply soap to me also.

660
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,851
Send it up!

661
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:36,268
Why did you come here?

662
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:38,226
Bucket was lying downstairs.

663
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,351
If so, would you bring it?

664
00:45:40,517 --> 00:45:42,351
They told me to do any job
on joining day, right?

665
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:43,767
That's why!

666
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:46,517
Would you murder if asked to?

667
00:45:46,726 --> 00:45:50,642
What can be more comfortable
than murdering in a lawyer's home?

668
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,351
Aren't you ashamed to enter
a lady's bathroom?

669
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,851
Look at that lizard!
How it is ogling at you!

670
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,642
Would you stop taking bath
because that lizard is seeing?

671
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:04,393
Lizards, insects and drivers like me,

672
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,268
you mustn't bother about them,

673
00:46:06,476 --> 00:46:09,642
without bothering about them,
take a good bath.

674
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,976
I'll wait here only, if you want
I'll get another bucket.

675
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:15,435
Are you daring to take on me?

676
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,851
I'll get you thrown out
from here in a week.

677
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:23,393
Many make great effort to make
others laugh with their jokes,

678
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,351
but when you get angry,
you make me laugh out loud!

679
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:29,184
Are you making me laughing stock?

680
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:31,517
I'm not afraid, I'll take bath.

681
00:46:34,486 --> 00:46:36,944
But I don't look at men taking bath.

682
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,778
Hey...

683
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:41,194
How could you get a heart attack?

684
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,486
You take good care of yourself.

685
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:45,444
What happened really?

686
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:50,652
That day after I had lunch,
I was feeling little uneasy,

687
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,778
moreover flight journey,

688
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:58,152
feeling heaviness in chest,
thought it could be gastric trouble,

689
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:01,861
after getting down,
I had Eno salt,

690
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:07,070
when I was driving, there was
a severe pain in my left hand,

691
00:47:07,444 --> 00:47:10,028
I understood,

692
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,903
I felt I'm finished,

693
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:16,152
I wanted to open the door,
I wanted to open the lock but...

694
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:18,819
I felt if someone had come
to my help.

695
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:20,819
But I couldn't do anything.

696
00:47:21,028 --> 00:47:23,235
I was not able to do anything.

697
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:27,235
Then, he came at the right moment.

698
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,070
Breaking the window and taking to
hospital is like a dream to me,

699
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:36,819
my wife, my children,

700
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:37,986
my brothers,

701
00:47:38,152 --> 00:47:40,194
their children,

702
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:41,652
all are very young,

703
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,402
not one of them is married,

704
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:50,694
only that was in my mind,

705
00:47:52,694 --> 00:47:55,486
strength of a thread is
known only when it snaps,

706
00:47:57,152 --> 00:47:59,694
value of relationships are
realised only when we leave,

707
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:01,903
it's true,

708
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:06,903
not just for me,
he came for my entire family,

709
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,819
thank you... thank you...

710
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,694
What else can I tell other than this?

711
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:17,819
Had my mother been alive,
she would've built a temple for you.

712
00:48:19,444 --> 00:48:23,611
What would your family have
done in this situation, mummy?

713
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:31,402
I don't have anyone,
they're all dead and gone.

714
00:49:02,194 --> 00:49:03,486
Brother!

715
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,903
If you go out,
get me two cigarettes.

716
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,694
Buy few beedies too.

717
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,028
What?
- Buy beedies, don't feel shy.

718
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:09,986


719
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:10,778
Beedies?

720
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:11,778
You too get cigarettes.

721
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,361


722
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:15,028
Why are you beating me?
- Should I get you cigarettes?

723
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:16,152


724
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,652
Do you know with whom
you're talking to?

725
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:20,194
You're not worth even to wipe my shoes.

726
00:49:20,402 --> 00:49:22,694
Should I get you cigarettes?
Come... come out!

727
00:49:22,903 --> 00:49:25,486
Come... come...
- I asked you friendly.

728
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:26,402
Please listen to me, sir.

729
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:27,819
Did you see that coffee shop?
- I've seen it.

730
00:49:28,028 --> 00:49:29,235
Was it there yesterday?
- No.

731
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:33,277
I don't know what coffee I would've,
American, filter or anything.

732
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:34,611
It was opened for my sake only.
- Is it?

733
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:35,402
For me only!

734
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:36,986
How dare you ask me to
get cigarettes!

735
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:38,194
Will you buy beedies for me?

736
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:39,361


737
00:49:39,527 --> 00:49:40,611
Come here.

738
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:41,778
Did you see that shop here yesterday?

739
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:42,569
No!

740
00:49:42,778 --> 00:49:45,402
If they ask for vegetables or coconuts,
I don't know to shop,

741
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:46,903
so thi s shop is being run
for me only.

742
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:48,819
They'll keep everything
packed and ready.

743
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,361
What did you ask me to do get now?
Buy cigarettes for you.

744
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:52,986
If I get cigarettes for you,
will you gift beedies to me?

745
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,569
Come here,
did you see cans in his hands?

746
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:57,819
Did you see?

747
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,569
One has diesel and
another has petrol,

748
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:01,277
I don't know what to fill in which car,

749
00:50:01,486 --> 00:50:03,778
when I apply the brake,
they'll come and fill it up,

750
00:50:03,986 --> 00:50:06,277
they'll fill up the tank,
what did you ask me?

751
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:08,569
Should I buy cigarettes for you?
Cigarettes?

752
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:11,486
So many are working for me
to keep me a driver,

753
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:12,986
are you telling me to work for you?

754
00:50:13,152 --> 00:50:15,569
Already they say we're dead.
- Is it?

755
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:17,694
How would an extra large sixed
man feel in small size?

756
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:18,819
I don't know, sir.
- Show him.

757
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:20,819
Why is coming behind me?
What's he going to do?

758
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:22,569
I'm getting suffocated!

759
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:25,111
I'm too had the same feeling.
Same feeling.

760
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:26,152
Should I buy you cigarettes?

761
00:50:26,361 --> 00:50:27,070


762
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:29,402
Why are you beating him, sir?
Ask them to beat him.

763
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,486
Were paying salaries.
- That's true.

764
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:32,444
Yeah.
- Go ahead.

765
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:33,402
Come on, beat him.

766
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:34,903
Sir... sir... please move, sir...

767
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:38,652
Sir... sorry, sir!
I thought you were joking.

768
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:41,611
Are you my brother-in-law to joke?
- No sir.

769
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:45,652
Balu!
- Sir!

770
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,652
Compared to my earlier days,
I'm cooler now, right?

771
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:49,652
You're much better compared
to early, sir.

772
00:50:49,861 --> 00:50:52,694
You've calmed down.
You're cool now.

773
00:50:52,903 --> 00:50:56,986
Right, I too noticed it.
- Yes... yes...

774
00:50:57,152 --> 00:50:58,361
Pay and send him.

775
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:02,194
Give it all.

776
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:03,986
Sir, its Rs.10 lakhs,
he can't handle it.

777
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:06,070
Oh!

778
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:09,903
Sir... sir... thanks, sir...

779
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,028
What's the number, brother?

780
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:23,486
You were right, Balu.
He can't handle too much money.

781
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:27,819
If anyone give Rs.10 lakhs,
break it open and take it,

782
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:29,819
why are you asking the number?

783
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:35,778
Hey, luck is knocking your door, Padhu!

784
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:38,194
But bad luck is firmly locked
inside your bedroom.

785
00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:41,111
So, manage with this Rs.1000 for now.

786
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:42,486
Enjoy!
- Enjoy?

787
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:43,361
Do festival!

788
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:44,527
Festival?
- Yes.

789
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,652
Bye... bye...

790
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:49,944
Hey, Gaurav!
- I don't want, mummy.

791
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:12,277
Where are you going?

792
00:52:12,486 --> 00:52:14,652
I told you about Wednesday party, right?

793
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:27,402
The line mustn't be seen.

794
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,402
Can I wipe it, mummy?

795
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:31,402
I'll kill you.

796
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:36,028
If I mean shouldn't seen,
wear a dress covering it.

797
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,444
Go!

798
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:38,486
Please...

799
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:40,277
Go!

800
00:52:43,152 --> 00:52:45,361
Playing fool with me.

801
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:49,611
Siddhu, we need to go out.

802
00:52:49,819 --> 00:52:50,903
Where to?

803
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:52,402
Fire in eyes!

804
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:54,569
Oh my God! Are you going to a party?

805
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:55,819
Yes.

806
00:52:56,028 --> 00:52:58,028
But you promised to go by evening.

807
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:01,778
Mother asked us to change the dress.
We got late.

808
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:05,903
I've been waiting here for you
since long time.

809
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:19,028
Madam, if you don't mind,
can I say something?

810
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:22,111
I'm finding it difficult to hold it.

811
00:53:22,277 --> 00:53:25,111
You're going to a party with
such long dresses,

812
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:27,361
what a traditional family yours is!

813
00:53:27,861 --> 00:53:29,235
We can hardly find anyone like this.

814
00:53:29,444 --> 00:53:31,152
I'm really very proud, madam.

815
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,527
To get associated with your family,

816
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:37,611
it's the good deeds of my early life to
get associated with a family like yours.

817
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:47,569
Siddhu!
- Madam... madam...

818
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:48,903
See on the left side!

819
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:51,235
Mother goes regularly that side
to reach her club.

820
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,819
Is it, madam?
- Look on the right side...

821
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:55,194
Look at that coffee shop...

822
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,028
Sister loves to have coffee there only.
- Oh, wonderful, madam.

823
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,361
That's on my daddy's office route.
- Yes madam.

824
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,194
If you go that side,
we'll reach our hotel.

825
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:02,070
This too.

826
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:04,652
Can you the building on left side?
I learn to play piano there.

827
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:05,986
Fantastic, madam.

828
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:08,569
Wonderful, madam...
wonderful, madam.

829
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:16,111
Hey!

830
00:54:17,444 --> 00:54:19,361
Did you change dress while
telling me address?

831
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:21,402
Are you disappointed in missing it?

832
00:54:21,611 --> 00:54:23,402
Why are you inciting him?

833
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,652
Siddhu, have your dinner
and wait for us.

834
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,986
Sure, madam... sure.
- Come.

835
00:54:28,152 --> 00:54:28,986
Go... go...

836
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:13,652
Hello!

837
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:17,486
Whom do you want?

838
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:21,028
Sashi... somewhere here only...

839
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,569
I'm Sashi!

840
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,152
Poor man may be here for us.

841
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:30,152
He won't come in the way
unless he gets ragged.

842
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:34,152
The Sashi I'm searching will
be half of you.

843
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:36,694
Am I so fat?

844
00:55:36,903 --> 00:55:39,903
I was saying about height.

845
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:43,111
How am I?
- Very good.

846
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:44,652
That's all?

847
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:47,819
You're beautiful too.
- That's it.

848
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:49,486
You're sexy too.

849
00:55:50,235 --> 00:55:51,194
What's your name?

850
00:55:51,402 --> 00:55:52,694
Siddhu... Siddhu...

851
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:54,361
Siddhu!

852
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,361
Did we meet before?

853
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:03,361
No... never...
Promise, this is the first time.

854
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,861
I mean it.
- Come with me.

855
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,986
Why are you man handling me?

856
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:08,277
Please... Oh God!

857
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:09,152
Yuck!

858
00:56:09,486 --> 00:56:11,111
What are you drinking?

859
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:12,152
Vodka.

860
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,903
Oh... excuse me.

861
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:16,778
Yuck!

862
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:19,402
What's this?
- Cocktail.

863
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,111
Have you stopped having plain water?

864
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:21,986
Umm!

865
00:56:23,611 --> 00:56:25,111
Oh my God!

866
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:37,194
Oh my God! What a boy!

867
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:44,070
He has filled my heart without
leaving a millimeter place...

868
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:50,861
Like a terrorist with dagger like eyes...

869
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,569
Like a sorcerer with hypnotic eyes...

870
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:59,778
He's troubling me...
catch him... catch him...

871
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:08,152
It's time to party now...

872
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:11,694
It's time to party now...

873
00:57:13,194 --> 00:57:16,819
Sing whatever you can mouth...

874
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:20,152
Dance whatever your body can...

875
00:57:20,361 --> 00:57:21,986
It's time to party...

876
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:24,028
It's time to party...

877
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:27,861
Drink whatever your hands lay on...

878
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,235
World is a swing,
swing to your heart...

879
00:57:31,444 --> 00:57:33,152
It's time to party...

880
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:34,986
It's time to party...

881
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:38,819
Come on... come on...
chill it... chill it...

882
00:57:39,028 --> 00:57:42,277
Come one... come on...
let's rock it!

883
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:46,070
Come on... come on...
let's rock it, shake it...

884
00:57:46,235 --> 00:57:49,986
Come on... come on...
let's have the fun!

885
00:57:50,152 --> 00:57:52,694
It's time to party now...

886
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,486
It's time to party now...

887
00:57:55,694 --> 00:57:57,277
Come O girl...

888
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:01,028
It's time to party...
let's rock it...

889
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:02,819
It's time to party, now...

890
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:04,652
Come O girl...

891
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:08,111
Are Tatas and Birlas greater than us?

892
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:12,694
Oh my God! What a boy!

893
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:20,111
He has filled my heart without
leaving a millimeter place...

894
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:26,861
Like a terrorist with dagger like eyes...

895
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,569
Like a sorcerer with hypnotic eyes...

896
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:35,778
He's troubling me...
catch him... catch him...

897
00:58:53,277 --> 00:58:56,652
I'm like the filament in Edison's bulb...

898
00:58:56,861 --> 00:59:00,194
Your mere touch can switch me on...

899
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:03,986
I'm silent fire like microwave...

900
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:07,402
If you give me your heart,
I'll show you my talent...

901
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,111
It's time to party...

902
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:10,986
It's time to party...

903
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:14,903
Hey boy! Are you a clone of love code?

904
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:18,486
Hey girl, so much following
for just one look...

905
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:21,277
It's time to party now...

906
00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:24,152
It's time to party now...

907
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:25,819
Come O girl...

908
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:29,819
It's time to party now...
let's rock it...

909
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:02,986
My name is Margareta,
I was born like a cocktail...

910
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:06,778
Steal my beauty with your eyes...

911
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:10,361
Youth is a garden of flower
without a watchman...

912
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:13,861
If you invite,
I'll land like a dragon fly...

913
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,486
It's time to party...

914
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:17,361
It's time to party...

915
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:19,235
Hello... hello...

916
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:21,235
Hey boy, should we invite you?

917
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:22,986
Baby... baby...

918
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,986
Hey girl, don't you want me
to enter the arena?

919
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:27,778
It's time to party now...

920
01:00:28,903 --> 01:00:30,652
It's time to party now...

921
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,235
Come O girl...

922
01:00:32,444 --> 01:00:36,486
It's time to party now...
let's rock it...

923
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,194
It's time to party...

924
01:00:41,527 --> 01:00:43,652
It's time to party...

925
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:49,111
It's time to party...

926
01:00:55,152 --> 01:01:00,152
My red dupatta is flying in wind...

927
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:05,694
My red dupatta is waving in air...

928
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:07,986
Hey!
- What?

929
01:01:08,152 --> 01:01:09,194
Why did you stop us?

930
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:11,402
I'm off duty now, right?

931
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:14,986
Start the car.
Have you gone mad?

932
01:01:15,152 --> 01:01:16,152
Huh?

933
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:17,861
Have you gone mad?

934
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,819
Who would be madder than you?

935
01:01:20,028 --> 01:01:20,819
Hey!

936
01:01:21,028 --> 01:01:23,152
Do you feel you're a great beauty?

937
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,277
Here comes Queen Victoria!

938
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:31,486
While creating Lord Brahma took
lunch break and left you half done.

939
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:32,402
That's why you're so...

940
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:34,277
Hey, I'll kill you!

941
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:35,652
Hey... hey...

942
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:38,277
Pramila madam, please come here.

943
01:01:39,444 --> 01:01:42,152
Wow!

944
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:43,694
Look how docile she is.

945
01:01:43,903 --> 01:01:44,694
Look at her patience.

946
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:46,319
That cuteness.

947
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:47,819
Look at those big eyes!

948
01:01:48,028 --> 01:01:53,028
Any man would love to fall
into it and take a swim.

949
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:54,361
Thank you.

950
01:01:54,569 --> 01:01:58,611
Don't look down,
fans like me would get hurt.

951
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:01,111
Why are you feeling so shy?

952
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,402
He's scolding me.
- He's not beating, be happy for it.

953
01:02:03,611 --> 01:02:04,903
Be happy.

954
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:06,152
Moreover he's drunk.

955
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:07,694
Indeed.

956
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:09,277
Give the keys.

957
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:11,694
You're off the duty, right?
Give the keys.

958
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,986
I'll get you fired from job.

959
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:15,486
Oh mother!

960
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:19,903
If I lose my job, how would
I eat food and take bath?

961
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,194
I'm really scared, mother.

962
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:26,028
If half built house like you
is so proud,

963
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:28,152
I'm tall like a seven story building,
how proud should I be?

964
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,986
What do you say, onlookers?

965
01:02:33,778 --> 01:02:35,861
Hey Sashi, soot of the house!

966
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,486
She's crying!

967
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:40,152
Start the car, for my sake.

968
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:45,111
Not just car for you,
I can take her life also, madam.

969
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:48,778
Come.

970
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:50,111
Sashi, come.

971
01:02:50,444 --> 01:02:52,652
What do you feel on seeing
the eldest girl?

972
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:54,569
I feel the dress is too short.

973
01:02:54,778 --> 01:02:57,194
I feel she would become
our madam in short cut.

974
01:02:57,402 --> 01:02:59,486
You mean they...
- Enough, let's move.

975
01:03:02,152 --> 01:03:03,611
Oh God!

976
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:05,111
Oh God!

977
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:06,778
Good morning, madam.

978
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,611
Yes... you only madam.

979
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:15,070
Do you remember
what you said last night?

980
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:17,194
It wasn't me, madam.

981
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:19,111
Oh!
- Umm...

982
01:03:19,277 --> 01:03:20,652
I'll tell my mother
about last night's incident.

983
01:03:20,861 --> 01:03:23,819
Not only this, you'll lose job
and roam on streets.

984
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:25,402
Please madam, don't hit my livelihood.

985
01:03:25,611 --> 01:03:28,111
I've only one job,
I don't have money also.

986
01:03:28,277 --> 01:03:28,986
Mother!

987
01:03:29,152 --> 01:03:29,986
Madam, please, madam...

988
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:30,986
Madam...
- Mother...

989
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:34,111
Don't hit the livelihood
of a worker, madam.

990
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:36,694
Don't hit his livelihood,
it's wrong, madam.

991
01:03:37,819 --> 01:03:40,569
Mother, last night Siddhu
created a big scene.

992
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:41,944
Okay, call him.

993
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,111
Siddhu... Siddhu...

994
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:44,986
Siddhu!

995
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:46,569
Mummy is calling you.

996
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:48,736
Madam.

997
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,402
Take out the car, need to go out.
- Sure, madam.

998
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:52,569
Bye madam.

999
01:04:15,194 --> 01:04:17,277
I thought hotel owner means
very old woman.

1000
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:18,903
She's very young.

1001
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:22,819
Those who took loan are young
but lender is getting old.

1002
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:24,652
I'm not refusing to repay the loan.

1003
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,028
How will you repay it?

1004
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:30,652
I'm discussing a deal with
a software company,

1005
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:35,028
if deal is okay,
for next 3 years we'll 40% occupancy.

1006
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:36,778
That'll not materialize, madam.

1007
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,152
Simple, your hotel would get
raided tomorrow,

1008
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:43,152
we'll catch few call girls,

1009
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:45,152
company would tear the
contract and walk out.

1010
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,861
Don't unnecessarily go against ego.

1011
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,402
Look at my face,
do I look like a egoistic man?

1012
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:53,028
If I remove my beard,
I'll be like Amul baby.

1013
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:54,903
Really, sir.

1014
01:04:55,111 --> 01:04:58,028
She need not repay me,
I'll pay 25 extra,

1015
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,694
tell her to give the hotel to me.

1016
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,028
Am I asking too much?

1017
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:04,111
Never heard any better deal
than this in my life, madam.

1018
01:05:04,277 --> 01:05:06,861
Jesus! Are you ready?
I'm ready.

1019
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,986
If you're adamant like this,
my man is short tempered.

1020
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:13,277
Unnecessarily in angry mood
he may harm your husband.

1021
01:05:13,486 --> 01:05:14,694
Why would I not get angry?

1022
01:05:14,903 --> 01:05:16,861
When I eat salt and spice!
I'll get angry.

1023
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,986
I'll do something,
I'll cut something.

1024
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:21,986
Cutting this or someone's neck
aren't much different.

1025
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,235
That will move when I cut
and this will not.

1026
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:25,361
That's the only difference.

1027
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:06,903
Go to road number 12!
- Madam!

1028
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:20,694
What you're doing is wrong, sir?

1029
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,861
Keep your hands on heart and think.

1030
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,486
I'll never keep hands on heart
except while sleeping.

1031
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:29,819
Who are you, man?
- Me? I'm a driver.

1032
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,903
Why are you discussing with a driver?
Throw him out.

1033
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:01,986
When an ACP is here,
how dare you beat my men!

1034
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:04,652
I'll kill you!
Are you a goon?

1035
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,028
You mad man!
Have I come to any exhibition?

1036
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:08,444
To watch if you fire at me!

1037
01:07:08,652 --> 01:07:10,903
One who fears will shout
and brave will bear it.

1038
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,569
No need to tell which category
you belong to.

1039
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,569
Are you a great man
if you beat four men?

1040
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,444
I'm old city Parameshwar!

1041
01:07:17,652 --> 01:07:21,028
Every Sunday I play card game
with Home Minister.

1042
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:22,694
State or central?

1043
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:24,819
Call him.
- Sir?

1044
01:07:25,028 --> 01:07:25,986
He told you his name, right?
Call him.

1045
01:07:26,152 --> 01:07:27,652
Sir... sir... I'll call him.

1046
01:07:29,028 --> 01:07:29,652
Hello...

1047
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:31,694
What? What's that built up?

1048
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:33,235
Who that man is in half suit?

1049
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:35,152
Who are you calling now?

1050
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,486
Will you settle things on phone?

1051
01:07:36,694 --> 01:07:38,152
Should we accept your
phone settlement?

1052
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:41,152
My hair has turned gray,
I'm using dye.

1053
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:42,152
You'll get the call.

1054
01:07:45,486 --> 01:07:46,277
Hello!

1055
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:52,111
Who is it, brother?

1056
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:55,569
What happened, brother?

1057
01:07:55,778 --> 01:07:58,361
Down your gun!
Down it.

1058
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,611
Sorry, sir.

1059
01:08:01,819 --> 01:08:03,819
I don't have any connection
with him, sir.

1060
01:08:04,028 --> 01:08:06,444
They invited me for marriage and
offered chicken, so I came.

1061
01:08:06,652 --> 01:08:08,070
Chicken isn't tasty too.

1062
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:09,444
What happened, brother?

1063
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,194
Asking me, what had happened?

1064
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:12,319
I'm finished.

1065
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:13,986
Before calling me for any settlement,

1066
01:08:14,152 --> 01:08:17,111
know the back ground of
people you're facing!

1067
01:08:17,277 --> 01:08:18,819
Call from central Home Minister.

1068
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:22,152
Gave me a lesson on phone.
He wants me in Delhi by tomorrow.

1069
01:08:23,569 --> 01:08:26,152
Are you watching any film?

1070
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:29,277
You'll die man!
He's dinosaur, run away!

1071
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:34,903
Sir, am I still in the post
or dismissed?

1072
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,611
You come here, sir.
I'll find and tell you.

1073
01:08:45,028 --> 01:08:46,569
If you give loan, should they've
to sell their hotel to you?

1074
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:47,778
If not will you kill them?

1075
01:08:51,444 --> 01:08:53,361
If they sell, buy it,
that's business.

1076
01:08:53,652 --> 01:08:55,694
Don't try to usurp it.
It's outrageous!

1077
01:08:57,861 --> 01:08:59,694
I'm here to protect her.

1078
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,235
Who is there to save you from me?

1079
01:09:07,152 --> 01:09:08,986
Sir, he may die in fear.

1080
01:09:09,152 --> 01:09:11,903
My anger isn't easing,
what am I to do?

1081
01:09:13,277 --> 01:09:14,070
Come here.

1082
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:16,527
Hey you!

1083
01:09:18,861 --> 01:09:20,694
Where's my hand and
where your cheek is?

1084
01:09:32,527 --> 01:09:34,111
I'll not beat you this time.

1085
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:39,986
If the torn agreement doesn't
reach her hands in 30 minutes.

1086
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:43,111
Lord Jesus! Please don't finish
that sentence.

1087
01:09:43,277 --> 01:09:45,486
I'll not give you that opportunity.

1088
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:47,070
Trust me.

1089
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:49,152
Do you've paper and pen?

1090
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:55,611
To respectable sister Sunanda,

1091
01:09:56,778 --> 01:10:00,444
madam, you're like a sister to me!

1092
01:10:00,652 --> 01:10:02,319
Madam, you're like a sister to me.

1093
01:10:02,527 --> 01:10:05,444
It was my mistake to behave
like that with you.

1094
01:10:05,652 --> 01:10:10,235
Here's the agreement you singed.
I'm giving it back to you.

1095
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:16,903
If you need any help in future,
I'll do it as your brother.

1096
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:20,819
For whatever had happened...
- I'm ashamed of.

1097
01:10:21,111 --> 01:10:22,652
What do you say for forgive
in Telugu?

1098
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:24,111
Please forgive me, madam.

1099
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:25,819
What happened?

1100
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:28,694
An hour ago, Satan took over me, madam.

1101
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:30,152
I wanted your hotel.

1102
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:32,319
Now, Jesus is in my heart!

1103
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:33,736
I'm returning it to you.

1104
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:35,235
Why did you change dramatically?

1105
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:38,444
When I got her to sign by force,
nobody asked me why?

1106
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,194
Now I'm reformed and returning it,
why are you asking so many questions?

1107
01:10:42,402 --> 01:10:46,778
Yes, no need of details
when rogues reform.

1108
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:49,152
Not that...
- Madam!

1109
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:52,819
There's a great power behind you, madam.

1110
01:10:55,944 --> 01:10:59,235
Till that is with you,
nobody can dare touch you, madam.

1111
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:02,194
Lord Jesus!

1112
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:28,694
Why was he looking at you, Siddhu?

1113
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:30,402
Nothing like that.

1114
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:31,861
He did!

1115
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,152
Keep quiet, don't say like that, Pramila.

1116
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:45,111
I'm sacred, Pramila.

1117
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:51,402
There's some magic in you!
Anyone would fall for it.

1118
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:08,235
She rolled her eyes like top...
She rolled her curls...

1119
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:12,569
She made me roll over her sexy waist...

1120
01:12:12,778 --> 01:12:17,778
Oh God! She's Bapu's girl...
Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig...

1121
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:23,152
She took the colour from
rubber bangles...

1122
01:12:23,361 --> 01:12:25,319
She applied red colour
on her cheeks...

1123
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:29,652
She flew me like a kite
with her ribbon...

1124
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:33,569
Oh God, is her sight gum?

1125
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:38,319
Oh God, she's an enchantress...

1126
01:12:38,527 --> 01:12:42,402
She felled me with her rosy lips...

1127
01:12:42,611 --> 01:12:46,819
She won over me waging a war
without swords...

1128
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:50,652
She danced on my heart...

1129
01:12:50,861 --> 01:12:55,361
Watching her dance steps,
I lost my sleep...

1130
01:12:55,569 --> 01:13:00,569
Oh God! She's Bapu's girl...
Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig...

1131
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:26,486
Humming a song while drying
clothes on the terrace...

1132
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:31,361
She sang a song to
squeeze my heart out...

1133
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:37,152
While serving me with
a glass of coffee...

1134
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:39,194
Touching me with her gentle body...

1135
01:13:39,402 --> 01:13:44,402
She electrified me with inciting desires
with the live wire of passion...

1136
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:52,444
She seasoned me like they do
while cooking vegetables...

1137
01:13:52,652 --> 01:13:56,694
Wherever she looks,
it appears like she's seeing me...

1138
01:13:56,903 --> 01:14:00,986
She stitched into my heart the thread
used for making flower garland...

1139
01:14:01,152 --> 01:14:05,028
She imprisoned me with sari end...

1140
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:07,235
She says hello early morning...

1141
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,361
She invades my dreams as night falls...

1142
01:14:09,569 --> 01:14:13,569
All her memories haunt
as far as she goes away...

1143
01:14:13,778 --> 01:14:18,778
Oh God! She's Bapu's girl...
Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig...

1144
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:05,070
She gently pushed into some
magical world...

1145
01:15:05,235 --> 01:15:09,903
She locked the door
and lost the keys...

1146
01:15:13,527 --> 01:15:17,819
She carried my heart
to the clouds...

1147
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:22,903
Without making noise,
she took away the ladder...

1148
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:31,070
She took my heart in her hand
and closed the fist...

1149
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:35,361
The wind of her beauty raised me
back into life again...

1150
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:39,652
She imprinted many a sweet
nothings with her thoughts...

1151
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:43,569
She put goggles of love
to my eyes...

1152
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:47,861
Princess of Kosala, a beautiful girl
who raked up desires in me...

1153
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:52,194
She made me a garland of beads
and wore it around her neck...

1154
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:57,402
Oh God! She's Bapu's girl...
Oh my God, she's a jasmine twig...

1155
01:16:30,277 --> 01:16:32,111
Eating ice cream...

1156
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:34,402
Don't tell my mother
about eating ice cream.

1157
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:36,527
She fears I may put on weight.

1158
01:16:40,903 --> 01:16:43,152
I don't like smoking.

1159
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:45,111
Come closer, I'll tell you a story.

1160
01:16:45,527 --> 01:16:47,402
Two thieves from Stuartpuram
went to steal a home,

1161
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:48,611
both of them faced each other,

1162
01:16:48,819 --> 01:16:51,444
if anyone of them shouts,
inmates would wake up,

1163
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:53,028
they'll thrash them,

1164
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:55,070
so both of them cleverly
did one thing,

1165
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,903
both shared equally the booty,

1166
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,111
and went away as they came.

1167
01:16:59,277 --> 01:17:01,486
What's the moral of the story, dear?

1168
01:17:01,694 --> 01:17:04,028
When you have an ice cream,
I'll close my eyes,

1169
01:17:04,194 --> 01:17:06,944
when I smoke cigarette,
close your nose.

1170
01:17:10,861 --> 01:17:12,070
Mind your business.

1171
01:17:23,028 --> 01:17:23,819
If you want, take it.

1172
01:17:24,028 --> 01:17:25,361
Do you know them, Pramila?

1173
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:26,944
Umm?
- No.

1174
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,486
Why are you beating up
while talking to her?

1175
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:32,778
What were you talking to her?

1176
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:36,694
Her ear rings were nice,
inquiring about where she bought it..

1177
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,277
Mummy bought it.

1178
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:40,986
Who are you calling?
- Her mummy.

1179
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:42,778
To know where she bought it.
- No need.

1180
01:17:42,986 --> 01:17:43,652
No?

1181
01:17:43,861 --> 01:17:46,569
When you don't need it,
why were you asking silly things?

1182
01:17:46,778 --> 01:17:49,152
There's a rule to tell lies too.

1183
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:52,111
At least one of the gang appears
like buying an earring.

1184
01:17:52,277 --> 01:17:53,778
Everyone appears like a thief!

1185
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:57,194
He may get hurt, Siddhu!

1186
01:17:57,402 --> 01:18:01,152
Mad Pramila!
What are you saying?

1187
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:04,361
I hit to hurt them, right?
Strongly!

1188
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:05,486
Driver!

1189
01:18:08,611 --> 01:18:09,611
Siddhu!

1190
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:14,944
That's why people have names.

1191
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:20,319
Instead of rings and bangles,
buy something useful to men.

1192
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:22,778
Am I right, Pramila?
- Umm...

1193
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:58,111
Move!

1194
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:46,152
Take care of him!

1195
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:53,986
Rajesh, get the bike.

1196
01:19:54,277 --> 01:19:56,152
What are you looking around?
Sister must be with me in 5 minutes.

1197
01:19:56,361 --> 01:19:57,028
Do something.

1198
01:19:57,194 --> 01:19:58,152
Hey... hey...

1199
01:20:52,028 --> 01:20:54,611
Still got 2 more minutes
in the time you gave me,

1200
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:55,944
get your sister, go.

1201
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:58,903
He's near her.

1202
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:02,028
He doesn't have courage
to kill anyone,

1203
01:21:02,194 --> 01:21:04,194
he doesn't have commitment
to die too.

1204
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:05,361
Get her!

1205
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:07,486
Go.

1206
01:21:14,486 --> 01:21:17,111
Who are they?
- I don't know, father.

1207
01:21:17,277 --> 01:21:18,861
Can you recognise them?
- No.

1208
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:20,361
Why didn't you go to police?

1209
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:21,986
We mustn't leave such incidents simply.

1210
01:21:22,152 --> 01:21:25,486
It's time for wedding invitations
not court summons.

1211
01:21:25,694 --> 01:21:26,569
Well said.

1212
01:21:26,778 --> 01:21:27,819
We mustn't go public over such issues.

1213
01:21:28,028 --> 01:21:30,486
We must cover such incidents
under the carpet.

1214
01:21:30,694 --> 01:21:33,194
Don't arrange felicitations
to Siddhu for saving her.

1215
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:34,903
By the way, what happened to Siddhu?

1216
01:21:35,111 --> 01:21:38,152
He beat them, how can he get hurt?

1217
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,361
He may have beat them,
he brought you home safely.

1218
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:44,819
Call Dr.Navin here.
- Okay, brother.

1219
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:24,903
When he was angry,
my father used to do just like this.

1220
01:22:26,111 --> 01:22:30,361
My brother used to tease me
that I too have the same habit.

1221
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:37,194
When I left home,
he had a son of this height.

1222
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:43,152
He was very intelligent.

1223
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:49,361
When I say fill the tank,
any driver would ask for money,

1224
01:22:50,028 --> 01:22:51,569
he won't leave with the keys,

1225
01:22:52,944 --> 01:22:54,611
he doesn't know that,

1226
01:22:56,361 --> 01:22:59,486
I and your father grew up
together for 20 years,

1227
01:23:00,903 --> 01:23:02,361
I can see him in you,

1228
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:06,819
when you speak,
I can hear your grandfather,

1229
01:23:08,152 --> 01:23:09,778
can't I recognise you?

1230
01:23:12,778 --> 01:23:16,486
He can throw out his daughter
from home every easily,

1231
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:20,277
but I can't even dismiss
a car driver.

1232
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:23,778
That's why you're still here.

1233
01:23:25,903 --> 01:23:29,486
Has your grandpa lost
his grip due to old age?

1234
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:31,778
Did he ask you to bring me?

1235
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:37,111
He didn't send me happily
after I got married,

1236
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:40,903
he sent me away with
my husband bleeding.

1237
01:23:50,028 --> 01:23:52,778
Is that all you can do, father?

1238
01:24:02,652 --> 01:24:04,819
When police said about
threat from my enemies,

1239
01:24:05,028 --> 01:24:07,611
Father, let's sit and talk it out.
Father, please!- I know!

1240
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:10,361
But my enemy was born
in my home.- Father!

1241
01:24:10,569 --> 01:24:12,277
I raised her myself.
- What are you doing, father?

1242
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:13,361
Father!

1243
01:24:13,986 --> 01:24:15,611
I'll wipe her out myself.

1244
01:24:16,277 --> 01:24:17,111
Father!

1245
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,152
This is what I can do!

1246
01:24:21,736 --> 01:24:22,402
Shekar!

1247
01:24:22,611 --> 01:24:23,486


1248
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:26,903
Father!

1249
01:24:28,194 --> 01:24:29,402
Shekar!

1250
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:34,361
Shekar!

1251
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:40,361
We didn't come here expecting
you'd welcome us, father.

1252
01:24:42,152 --> 01:24:43,652
I thought you'd understand us.

1253
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:47,402
I know you'd shout at us.

1254
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:49,611
I thought of enduring it.

1255
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:52,361
I expected your anger, father.

1256
01:24:53,486 --> 01:24:58,486
But I couldn't expect your hatred.

1257
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:07,070
You killed me there.
You died here.

1258
01:25:08,944 --> 01:25:13,944
The place where my husband's blood
spilled is cemetery to me.

1259
01:25:17,152 --> 01:25:17,944
Come.

1260
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:24,611
Please Nandu, listen to me.

1261
01:25:25,778 --> 01:25:30,778
Don't worry brother,
I'll not file a case on father.

1262
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:32,611
Come.

1263
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:38,235
I'm not angry on you.

1264
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:42,778
Because I've to remember
you for that.

1265
01:25:43,444 --> 01:25:44,694
I don't like it.

1266
01:25:46,028 --> 01:25:48,486
I don't lose anything
if you stay here.

1267
01:25:49,235 --> 01:25:50,694
It isn't of any use to you.

1268
01:25:54,486 --> 01:25:59,486
But one thing, Shekar got a heart
attack as soon as you came.

1269
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:02,152
You saved him.

1270
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:06,402
Hotel is in problems,
you solved it.

1271
01:26:07,861 --> 01:26:11,402
Today Pramila got kidnapped,
you saved her.

1272
01:26:13,694 --> 01:26:15,694
If these incidents had
happened naturally, it's okay.

1273
01:26:16,861 --> 01:26:21,861
If it was planned
and solved by you,

1274
01:26:23,652 --> 01:26:27,694
impressing us and were planning
to take us to your grandpa,

1275
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:32,819
I too have a gun and
license for it.

1276
01:26:34,861 --> 01:26:37,361
But I won't miss the target
like your grandpa.

1277
01:27:08,736 --> 01:27:11,652
I saw everything sir.
You both had a good talk.

1278
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:12,694
Who?

1279
01:27:13,486 --> 01:27:14,778
You both!

1280
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:18,611
Who were talking?
- She talked, sir.

1281
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:19,611
Why did you say both then?

1282
01:27:19,819 --> 01:27:23,986
I thought you'd convince your aunt
and take her to your grandpa.

1283
01:27:24,152 --> 01:27:25,611
Grandfather?

1284
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:28,152
She was talking,
how could she get convinced by it?

1285
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:30,903
But she knew I was Gautham.

1286
01:27:31,111 --> 01:27:34,028
We got caught playing hide and seek
in a floodlit stadium.

1287
01:27:34,194 --> 01:27:34,903
Like fools!

1288
01:27:35,111 --> 01:27:39,694
Did your aunt chide you
in front of entire family, right?

1289
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:42,361
If we were just two,
why would entire family be there?

1290
01:27:42,569 --> 01:27:44,986
Bloody idiot!
- Thank you, sir.

1291
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,444
You're not fit to talk anyway,
you're unfit to get angry with too.

1292
01:27:48,652 --> 01:27:52,861
Sir, if you promise not to beat,
I'll say something.

1293
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:54,111
Cry it off!

1294
01:27:54,277 --> 01:27:57,652
Nobody else knows that you're her
nephew other than your aunt, right?

1295
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,152
No, she won't tell anyone.

1296
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:01,444
Take advantage of it and use it.

1297
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:04,111
Don't beat around the bush,
come to the point directly.

1298
01:28:04,277 --> 01:28:07,152
Tell you love her with aunt's
elder daughter Pramila.

1299
01:28:07,361 --> 01:28:09,235
Would she follow me if I say so?

1300
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:13,277
She's crazy about you, sir.

1301
01:28:13,986 --> 01:28:16,819
She'll die for you, sir.

1302
01:28:17,028 --> 01:28:22,028
On hearing your name,
she'd say beau... beau...

1303
01:28:24,986 --> 01:28:26,986
Balu, finish it quickly.

1304
01:28:27,152 --> 01:28:28,986
I'm dying with tension
to hear rest of it.

1305
01:28:29,152 --> 01:28:29,986
Tell me what's next?

1306
01:28:30,152 --> 01:28:32,611
She loves you very much, sir.

1307
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:36,277
She'll eat you alive with
her eyes, sir.

1308
01:28:37,361 --> 01:28:39,028
Just go to her and
say I love you.

1309
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:42,903
She'll immediately follow you
like a Pomeranian dog.

1310
01:28:43,111 --> 01:28:47,486
Your aunt will also follow you
in the next flight.

1311
01:28:47,819 --> 01:28:50,111
Balu, you did make
a valuable suggestion.

1312
01:28:50,277 --> 01:28:51,611
I want to kiss you.

1313
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:02,611
I lost my confidence hearing
my aunt's chiding remarks.

1314
01:29:03,402 --> 01:29:06,152
Balu, I need little encouragement.

1315
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:13,361
Ummm... ummm...

1316
01:29:13,569 --> 01:29:14,486
Ummm...

1317
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:15,861
What do you want, son?

1318
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:18,986
If Pramila sees me?
- She'll get tempted.

1319
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:21,361
If I talk to her?
- She'll melt.

1320
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:23,694
If I touch her?
- She'll get connected.

1321
01:29:23,903 --> 01:29:26,070
Ummm... ummm...

1322
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:29,028
If you stay here, you'll get late.

1323
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:30,277
Ummm...

1324
01:29:39,486 --> 01:29:42,819
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop!

1325
01:29:43,028 --> 01:29:44,736
Why did you stop me?
- Why do you want to kill yourself?

1326
01:29:44,944 --> 01:29:46,819
Why should I live?

1327
01:29:47,111 --> 01:29:48,694
Will you stop asking questions
and answer me?

1328
01:29:48,903 --> 01:29:51,652
Why should I live when I don't
get what I like?

1329
01:29:52,903 --> 01:29:54,819
I think she knows I'm going away.

1330
01:29:55,486 --> 01:29:58,736
Why will you not get it?
What you like is right before you!

1331
01:29:58,944 --> 01:30:00,028
It's yours any day.

1332
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,486
Not mine.

1333
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:04,611
She's feeling because I'm a driver.

1334
01:30:05,111 --> 01:30:08,402
Prami, I'm not a driver as you think.
- Yes, you're a rogue.

1335
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:11,070
You separated me from my lover.

1336
01:30:14,402 --> 01:30:15,611
Aah!

1337
01:30:18,028 --> 01:30:19,694
Lover?

1338
01:30:20,235 --> 01:30:23,028
Who is he?
- Rohit, the man you beat in mall.

1339
01:30:23,194 --> 01:30:25,361
He kidnapped you, right?

1340
01:30:25,569 --> 01:30:27,402
Had he kidnapped me,
I would've shouted, right?

1341
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,903
We love each other for 3 years now.

1342
01:30:35,028 --> 01:30:38,111
We had decided to run away
today and marry.

1343
01:30:38,778 --> 01:30:41,611
You spoiled everything.
Are you happy now?

1344
01:30:42,194 --> 01:30:44,152
He's getting married tomorrow night.

1345
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,903
He's getting married night, right?

1346
01:30:47,778 --> 01:30:48,861
I'll bring him by morning.

1347
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:51,152
He has been taken away
by the marriage party.

1348
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:52,694
Where?

1349
01:30:54,194 --> 01:30:54,944
Hmm..

1350
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:00,361
Neelamani weds Rohit!

1351
01:31:01,028 --> 01:31:04,361
Siddappa Naidu is village head
of that place.

1352
01:31:04,569 --> 01:31:07,361
One daughter and two sons.

1353
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:10,235
Second son is very violent.

1354
01:31:13,402 --> 01:31:15,819
He cut the hand for stealing
his daughter's bag.

1355
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:19,277
Can you bring my future
husband from such a house?

1356
01:31:20,152 --> 01:31:22,486
I'll bring.
- Will you go now?

1357
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:28,611
I need little time to recover
from such shocks.

1358
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:29,778
I need time.

1359
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,070
Meanwhile, you take a bath in the tub.

1360
01:31:33,235 --> 01:31:34,986
Use drier to dry your hair.

1361
01:31:35,152 --> 01:31:38,277
But don't join both, please!

1362
01:31:39,028 --> 01:31:41,152
It's my responsibility
to unite you both.

1363
01:31:41,361 --> 01:31:42,611
My responsibility!

1364
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,778
I can see the marriage canopy...

1365
01:31:55,986 --> 01:31:58,903
The auspicious time to unite...

1366
01:31:59,111 --> 01:32:02,694
Did you hear, sir?
What a situational song!

1367
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,694
Open the suitcases.

1368
01:32:10,402 --> 01:32:12,111
Continue the stay in hotel.

1369
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,152
Keep plane in parking bay.

1370
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:17,111
Take me to a hospital.

1371
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:18,903
Seenu!
- Sir!

1372
01:32:19,111 --> 01:32:20,611
I want to go to Chittoor,
get me a vehicle.

1373
01:32:20,819 --> 01:32:22,861
One of you come with me.
- For driving, sir?

1374
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,986
To get scolded and
beaten up when I'm angry.

1375
01:32:25,152 --> 01:32:28,819
Someone wants to go to Chittoor,
a group fell on my feet.

1376
01:32:29,028 --> 01:32:33,819
You know, I'm very sentimental,
he'll drive, I'll show directions.

1377
01:32:34,028 --> 01:32:36,361
This is Rohit's photo.
I'll give their address.

1378
01:32:36,569 --> 01:32:38,152
He's not that great.

1379
01:32:38,361 --> 01:32:39,903
Bad photography.

1380
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:41,694
Your choice too is bad.

1381
01:32:42,361 --> 01:32:44,152
Please bring him carefully.

1382
01:32:45,277 --> 01:32:47,152
She's not saying at least go carefully.

1383
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,486
Eh?
- Nothing.

1384
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:57,486
Okay... okay!

1385
01:32:57,861 --> 01:32:59,361
I'm sure they've stolen something.

1386
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:00,152
Mummy...

1387
01:33:00,361 --> 01:33:04,361


1388
01:33:06,277 --> 01:33:07,111
Umm?

1389
01:33:07,903 --> 01:33:08,486
Umm...?

1390
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:11,819
Umm?

1391
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:13,361
Umm... umm...

1392
01:33:13,694 --> 01:33:14,277
Umm..

1393
01:33:17,778 --> 01:33:20,652
I don't have any complaint
in life without you...

1394
01:33:27,486 --> 01:33:29,111
Girls have no taste.

1395
01:33:29,277 --> 01:33:32,111
He's like a TV tower wearing shirt.
She loves him.

1396
01:33:32,277 --> 01:33:36,486
She's much better, the younger one
will surely select a terrorist.

1397
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,694
What are your sweet memories with her?

1398
01:33:38,903 --> 01:33:41,569
Nothing sir, recently she said
I lost my purse,

1399
01:33:41,778 --> 01:33:42,736
and asked did you take it?

1400
01:33:42,944 --> 01:33:43,819
Why didn't you hit back with slippers?

1401
01:33:44,028 --> 01:33:48,361
When I asked why? She said purse
rhymes with nurse, so I asked you.

1402
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:49,152
Rhyming?

1403
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:51,402
If she loses a tractor
would she ask a doctor?

1404
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:53,569
No need to think of her, sir.

1405
01:33:53,778 --> 01:33:56,694
Seeing her is bad omen and
crossing her path is death.

1406
01:33:58,903 --> 01:34:00,111
Looks just like her.

1407
01:34:01,778 --> 01:34:02,819
Oh my God!

1408
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:20,402
Do you've to travel so long
to reach from there to here?

1409
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:21,235
Respect?

1410
01:34:21,444 --> 01:34:23,486
You didn't get hurt, did you?

1411
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:38,694
Order two dosas, please.
- Two dosas, brother.

1412
01:34:41,861 --> 01:34:43,652
I think she would've fallen
into jeep from balcony.

1413
01:34:43,861 --> 01:34:45,694
She has lost her mind.

1414
01:34:45,903 --> 01:34:47,694
It's amnesia, Padhu.

1415
01:34:47,903 --> 01:34:50,152
When will she remember her past?
- 3 pesarattu.

1416
01:34:50,361 --> 01:34:52,402
How would I know?
- Pesarattu!

1417
01:34:52,611 --> 01:34:53,861
Isn't it?

1418
01:34:54,028 --> 01:34:55,111
What happened to me?

1419
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:58,070
Nothing, your parents didn't
agree for our marriage.

1420
01:34:58,861 --> 01:35:01,319
Add onions in pesarattu.
- Why?

1421
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:03,028
You're my aunt's daughter.

1422
01:35:03,194 --> 01:35:05,111
Our families are at loggerheads.

1423
01:35:05,277 --> 01:35:07,194
That's why we've eloped.

1424
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:09,819
Don't use oil, use ghee.

1425
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:12,194
Don't I have sisters?

1426
01:35:13,861 --> 01:35:17,277
You've a sister, she loves someone.

1427
01:35:17,819 --> 01:35:19,694
A sand laden lorry hit him.

1428
01:35:20,652 --> 01:35:22,903
It's not wrong to add
cashew nuts too for them.

1429
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:25,235
Who is he?
- Doctor!

1430
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:28,361
He prescribed medicines for you, right?
Isn't it, doctor?

1431
01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:29,861
Clever boy!

1432
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:31,652
Where's his stethoscope?

1433
01:35:31,861 --> 01:35:34,111
I sold it to buy diesel.

1434
01:35:34,444 --> 01:35:35,611
Don't bill them.

1435
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:36,694
Beau!

1436
01:35:40,694 --> 01:35:41,361
Eh?

1437
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,277
You're my beau, right?

1438
01:35:47,361 --> 01:35:48,070
Right!

1439
01:35:49,235 --> 01:35:52,694
When she addresses me like that
I'm overcome with feelings.

1440
01:35:52,903 --> 01:35:55,986
Beau! You're rich, right?

1441
01:35:56,152 --> 01:35:58,652
Problem must be in your home,
why are we facing it in my house?

1442
01:35:58,861 --> 01:36:02,778
She has forgotten the past
but not logic.

1443
01:36:03,569 --> 01:36:06,070
A fear the rich kids have bad habits.

1444
01:36:06,402 --> 01:36:07,277
Naturally!

1445
01:36:07,486 --> 01:36:10,486
But you don't look like that, beau.

1446
01:36:12,694 --> 01:36:13,694
Thank you.

1447
01:36:13,903 --> 01:36:18,028
Actually your grandpa is the only
one to agree for our marriage.

1448
01:36:18,194 --> 01:36:21,736
Is he any less?
He has left billions for you.

1449
01:36:21,903 --> 01:36:23,361
No need to talk about that now, Padhu.

1450
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:25,819
Just for information, right?

1451
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,903
Sashi!
- Beau!

1452
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:40,235
Would you like to speak
to your grandpa on phone?

1453
01:36:40,444 --> 01:36:42,152
Umm... umm... umm..

1454
01:36:44,277 --> 01:36:45,486
You sit as it is.

1455
01:36:46,194 --> 01:36:48,028
Grandpa! - Talk!

1456
01:36:52,277 --> 01:36:53,070
Hello!

1457
01:36:53,361 --> 01:36:54,235
Give phone to grandpa!

1458
01:36:54,444 --> 01:36:56,277
Sir, Gautham.

1459
01:36:58,152 --> 01:37:00,111
How are you, sunny?

1460
01:37:00,277 --> 01:37:01,861
Would you like to speak
to your granddaughter?

1461
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:04,986
Would she speak to me?

1462
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:05,819
Talk to him.

1463
01:37:07,527 --> 01:37:09,903
Grandpa, I'm Sashi here.

1464
01:37:11,028 --> 01:37:12,152
How are you, dear?

1465
01:37:12,361 --> 01:37:16,152
I'm fine, grandpa.
But my parents didn't approve it.

1466
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:19,486
How can they accept so easily?

1467
01:37:20,444 --> 01:37:22,611
What has happened wasn't
a small issue, right?

1468
01:37:23,111 --> 01:37:25,819
Whether it is big or small,
it's over, right?

1469
01:37:26,028 --> 01:37:27,986
Why should we hang on
to it for years?

1470
01:37:28,152 --> 01:37:30,611
Though you're young,
what you said is right.

1471
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:32,694
Is it wrong to marry uncle's son?

1472
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:34,152
Marriage?

1473
01:37:34,361 --> 01:37:37,402
Nothing, grandpa.
- Playing fun with aunt's daughter?

1474
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:38,903
Something similar.

1475
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:40,778
Shall I call you later?

1476
01:37:45,028 --> 01:37:48,903
I felt like crying on
hearing grandpa's voice.

1477
01:37:52,194 --> 01:37:54,694
Everything will be fine.
- Thank you, beau.

1478
01:37:55,486 --> 01:37:56,486
Great!

1479
01:37:58,361 --> 01:37:59,778
Please get up, dear.

1480
01:38:00,152 --> 01:38:01,111
He's here.

1481
01:38:03,028 --> 01:38:03,903
What's this?

1482
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:06,903
Your love story may be old,
but this sari is new,

1483
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:09,986
before they finish eating pesarattu
please wear this sari.

1484
01:38:10,152 --> 01:38:10,778
Eh?

1485
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:13,402
Take it.

1486
01:38:15,194 --> 01:38:15,819
Thank you.

1487
01:38:16,028 --> 01:38:16,694
Go!

1488
01:38:25,194 --> 01:38:30,194
My pulse rate raced on seeing you...

1489
01:38:31,194 --> 01:38:33,694
Why is it so?

1490
01:38:34,444 --> 01:38:39,402
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1491
01:38:39,611 --> 01:38:43,028
Why did it do like that?

1492
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:54,903
Go that side..

1493
01:39:02,152 --> 01:39:07,152
My pulse rate raced on seeing you...

1494
01:39:08,194 --> 01:39:10,611
Why is it so?

1495
01:39:11,277 --> 01:39:16,277
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1496
01:39:17,319 --> 01:39:19,903
Why did it do like that?

1497
01:39:20,986 --> 01:39:25,986
Don't know what it is... what magic
you spread with just a look...

1498
01:39:27,152 --> 01:39:32,152
Don't know what it is... you gave me
a disease with your body shake...

1499
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:38,361
Like a drowning flood, burning fire,
you took my life, dear...

1500
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:41,111
On seeing you....

1501
01:39:42,111 --> 01:39:44,611
My little heart...

1502
01:39:45,194 --> 01:39:50,070
My pulse rate raced on seeing you...

1503
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:54,194
Why is it so?

1504
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:59,361
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1505
01:40:00,444 --> 01:40:02,486
Why did it do like that?

1506
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:16,611
Once more with feeling!

1507
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:21,903
Oh no!

1508
01:40:31,652 --> 01:40:36,652
Such a vast sky... endless blue...

1509
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:41,152
How could you fill all that
in your little fish eyes?

1510
01:40:41,361 --> 01:40:43,569
You rocked me!

1511
01:40:43,778 --> 01:40:48,778
It's true that gold is hidden
inside earth...

1512
01:40:49,569 --> 01:40:54,569
But growing on earth and moving,
you've re-written the history...

1513
01:40:56,486 --> 01:41:01,486
When you break into a jig in sari...
Shall I follow you like an ant?

1514
01:41:02,486 --> 01:41:07,486
When you move swinging like a boat...
May I follow you like wind?

1515
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:13,861
Let's be together like Radha-Krishna
and pain-sadness...

1516
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:19,486
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1517
01:41:20,444 --> 01:41:24,652
Why did it do like that?

1518
01:41:31,235 --> 01:41:34,402
Daughter-in-law without
mother-in-law is great lady...

1519
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:38,402
Mother-in-law without
daughter-in-law is great lady...

1520
01:41:40,486 --> 01:41:45,486
Daughter-in-law... son's wife!
Where's cream in fresh milk...

1521
01:41:47,194 --> 01:41:51,277
Where's moonlight in hot milk...

1522
01:41:53,486 --> 01:41:54,819
Please dance, yaar!

1523
01:42:19,277 --> 01:42:24,277
Who so ever may have painted
the picture of Mona Lisa...

1524
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:28,694
I'm sure he hasn't seen the
milky beauty of you...

1525
01:42:28,903 --> 01:42:31,194
What's the use?

1526
01:42:31,444 --> 01:42:36,444
One who took away the Kohinoor
diamond may be a King...

1527
01:42:37,778 --> 01:42:42,778
Poor man doesn't know the shine
of that diamond is in you...

1528
01:42:43,861 --> 01:42:46,819
If you're born and
brought up like this...

1529
01:42:47,028 --> 01:42:49,486
How much can I sing
in praise of you?

1530
01:42:49,694 --> 01:42:54,694
I've used all the words I know
in Telugu to write this song...

1531
01:42:55,861 --> 01:43:00,861
Like Sirivennela's songs and Veturi's
lyrics, you're so sweet, my dear...

1532
01:43:02,028 --> 01:43:03,903
On seeing you....

1533
01:43:04,986 --> 01:43:07,152
My little heart...

1534
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:13,111
My pulse rate raced on seeing you...

1535
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:15,903
Why is it so?

1536
01:43:17,194 --> 01:43:22,194
Without seeing you my eyes went
hammer and tongs on each other...

1537
01:43:23,361 --> 01:43:26,611
Why did it do like that?

1538
01:43:49,361 --> 01:43:53,611
Why have we come here, dear?
- To take a small parcel.

1539
01:43:54,486 --> 01:43:56,152
Shall I wait here?

1540
01:43:56,611 --> 01:43:57,778
Will you wait?

1541
01:43:58,944 --> 01:44:00,111
My sweet darling, come.

1542
01:44:00,944 --> 01:44:04,611
What will you do waiting here?
You promised to marry me.

1543
01:44:04,819 --> 01:44:05,778
Will you marry me?
- I do.

1544
01:44:05,986 --> 01:44:08,361
I think you'd go on honeymoon before
that marriage happens, come.

1545
01:44:08,569 --> 01:44:09,819
You go, I'll follow.

1546
01:44:10,028 --> 01:44:11,194
Come.
- Shall I go?

1547
01:44:11,402 --> 01:44:12,444
Will you wait?
- It's not nice, let's go.

1548
01:44:12,652 --> 01:44:14,569
Come... come...

1549
01:44:14,778 --> 01:44:15,652
Beau!

1550
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:17,903
He'll come back, not going away.

1551
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:20,486
He'll come back in few minutes.

1552
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:24,903
Come... why are you getting ready?

1553
01:44:25,111 --> 01:44:27,694
Getting ready to fight?
Wait, I'll settle this issue.

1554
01:44:27,903 --> 01:44:28,652
How?

1555
01:44:28,861 --> 01:44:32,152
Asking me how? You said you're
a billionaire, did I believe it?

1556
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:33,903
Let me use the same formula here.

1557
01:44:34,111 --> 01:44:36,819
If they ask, let's tell them we're
here to take away the groom.

1558
01:44:37,028 --> 01:44:39,611
They'll offer sweets and
send us in.- Come.

1559
01:44:39,986 --> 01:44:41,070
Do something.

1560
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:43,986
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1561
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:44,903
Give it.

1562
01:44:45,611 --> 01:44:47,819
Take sweets.

1563
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:50,152
You are...?
- I'm bride's second brother.

1564
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:51,903
He's elder brother.

1565
01:44:53,152 --> 01:44:55,986
You are...?
- We're here to kidnap the groom.

1566
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,986
Didn't I tell they'll not
believe the truth?

1567
01:45:00,152 --> 01:45:03,361
The groom up there doesn't
like your sister,

1568
01:45:03,569 --> 01:45:04,903
he loves another girl,

1569
01:45:05,111 --> 01:45:07,111
he sought our help
and we're here.

1570
01:45:07,277 --> 01:45:09,277
Padhu, they didn't ask all that details.

1571
01:45:09,486 --> 01:45:11,569
Truth isn't a DVD movie!

1572
01:45:11,778 --> 01:45:13,611
To press pause button
as and when you feel!

1573
01:45:13,861 --> 01:45:14,652
It's a film in theatre!

1574
01:45:14,861 --> 01:45:18,070
Once the titles start, curtains
mustn't come down till it is over.

1575
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:20,194
Where's the groom?
- Upstairs.

1576
01:45:20,402 --> 01:45:21,361
This way, sir.

1577
01:45:21,569 --> 01:45:25,235
Didn't I say sweets? They don't
believe if I tell truth also, fools.

1578
01:45:27,402 --> 01:45:30,694
Truth is like fire.

1579
01:45:30,903 --> 01:45:34,361
One who says my feel the burn but
one who hears will feel its warmth.

1580
01:45:35,819 --> 01:45:37,361
Keep those things there!

1581
01:45:40,986 --> 01:45:43,235
They say there's more in
a marriage that will stop!

1582
01:45:43,444 --> 01:45:46,611
Infact I feel pity for these guys!

1583
01:45:56,028 --> 01:45:56,944
Don't know what it is!

1584
01:46:04,861 --> 01:46:06,235
Why are you dull?

1585
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:09,235
I should be marrying her
but I'm marrying her.

1586
01:46:09,444 --> 01:46:11,152
How would I be other than dull?

1587
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:13,694
Stop crying like a girl
and come with us.

1588
01:46:13,903 --> 01:46:15,319
If they know, they'll kill us.

1589
01:46:15,527 --> 01:46:17,152
They gave your address.

1590
01:46:18,111 --> 01:46:20,652
Look at this long hair man,
he's very good man.

1591
01:46:20,861 --> 01:46:21,903
He offered sweets too.

1592
01:46:22,111 --> 01:46:24,402
Who among you is the leader?

1593
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:26,694
Padhu sir leads in everything!

1594
01:46:26,903 --> 01:46:28,111
For what?

1595
01:46:28,444 --> 01:46:29,819
Why are you looking at me furiously?

1596
01:46:30,235 --> 01:46:31,361
Will you beat me?

1597
01:47:03,152 --> 01:47:04,819
He appears like a good man!

1598
01:47:05,028 --> 01:47:05,819
Elderly man!

1599
01:47:07,611 --> 01:47:08,277
Oh my God!

1600
01:47:14,778 --> 01:47:16,277
One second delay I would've lost
my head instead of hair.

1601
01:47:16,486 --> 01:47:17,235
Oh my God!

1602
01:47:17,444 --> 01:47:19,986
Did you get it now?
Truth burns both teller and listener.

1603
01:47:20,152 --> 01:47:21,778
Oh my God! They're following us!

1604
01:47:58,861 --> 01:48:00,611
Hey!

1605
01:48:01,235 --> 01:48:04,611
Oh no! They're closing in!

1606
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:11,111
They're closing in!

1607
01:48:19,028 --> 01:48:23,819


1608
01:48:24,028 --> 01:48:25,361
Go fast!

1609
01:48:25,694 --> 01:48:30,694


1610
01:48:38,028 --> 01:48:39,277
Go... go...

1611
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,070
No road, don't go!

1612
01:48:57,903 --> 01:48:59,402
I should be in home,
how did I come here?

1613
01:48:59,611 --> 01:49:01,652
She got back her past!

1614
01:49:01,861 --> 01:49:05,070
Oh God!

1615
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:09,986
They're closing in, go fast!

1616
01:49:15,402 --> 01:49:16,486
Where am I?

1617
01:49:16,819 --> 01:49:19,111
Don't leave them, come on, boys!

1618
01:49:20,861 --> 01:49:24,277
They're coming!
- Didn't he kidnap my sister?

1619
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:30,070
Who changed my dress?

1620
01:49:30,235 --> 01:49:33,152
I'm coming to kill you.

1621
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:35,486
What's this?
Tell me who changed this?

1622
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:37,194
Tell me!

1623
01:49:41,152 --> 01:49:46,152
Come... come with me.
- You did something...

1624
01:49:46,361 --> 01:49:48,986
So many people are coming!
What's this trouble for?

1625
01:49:51,111 --> 01:49:51,986
Who are you?

1626
01:49:52,152 --> 01:49:55,235
You don't know,
I'm really serious, tell me now!

1627
01:50:32,486 --> 01:50:34,361
Who is father of the
running away man?

1628
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:36,903
Who is the father of unconscious man?

1629
01:50:37,194 --> 01:50:38,111
Umm..

1630
01:50:39,486 --> 01:50:44,486
Hey beating up my son, how dare you
are talking to me leisurely!

1631
01:50:45,402 --> 01:50:49,070
Look, in chess board
King is an old man just like you,

1632
01:50:49,235 --> 01:50:52,903
Just one step this side or that side.

1633
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:55,444
But why do people call him as king?

1634
01:50:55,652 --> 01:50:59,402
Because Minister is next to him.
That's his strength!

1635
01:51:02,277 --> 01:51:03,111
Who is your strength?

1636
01:51:03,277 --> 01:51:04,652
Who gives you the power
to twirl your moustache?

1637
01:51:04,861 --> 01:51:06,277
Whose muscles make you boast?

1638
01:51:06,486 --> 01:51:08,277
Whose courage makes you
take out a dagger?

1639
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:09,652
Who is he?

1640
01:51:09,861 --> 01:51:14,569
He can bring down an elephant
with one punch!

1641
01:51:14,778 --> 01:51:17,486
He's my man!
My bull!

1642
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:22,486
This is my pride!

1643
01:51:25,402 --> 01:51:26,778
If you touch it,
it's like beating me,

1644
01:51:26,986 --> 01:51:28,778
if you wear it,
it's like I'm dead.

1645
01:51:29,819 --> 01:51:32,611
Wow! Good timing!

1646
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:33,652
If you touch it,
it's like beating me,

1647
01:51:33,861 --> 01:51:35,235
if you wear it,
it's like I'm dead.

1648
01:51:35,444 --> 01:51:37,486
Why not add a good rhythm to it?
It could become a good song.

1649
01:51:37,694 --> 01:51:42,694
Hack him in the name of
Ahobhilam Lord Narasimhaswamy!

1650
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:04,569
Never step on snake's hood
because it's resting.

1651
01:52:04,778 --> 01:52:08,819
Are you a great man
if you beat one man?

1652
01:52:09,028 --> 01:52:14,028
Each one of my men will play swing
with live wires.

1653
01:52:14,527 --> 01:52:16,444
But never play with power plant!

1654
01:52:16,652 --> 01:52:18,070
You'll get blown up!

1655
01:53:59,652 --> 01:54:01,194
One must catch their own thing!

1656
01:54:02,111 --> 01:54:05,111
Never try to catch another one's,
this will be the result.

1657
01:54:05,277 --> 01:54:07,361
What? Be careful!

1658
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:11,986
How can he take him?
He must marry my daughter.

1659
01:54:12,152 --> 01:54:15,235
Agreed it's your daughter's marriage
but death to another daughter.

1660
01:54:15,444 --> 01:54:17,402
Which is more difficult?

1661
01:54:18,152 --> 01:54:19,652
There's clarity in my question.

1662
01:54:19,861 --> 01:54:22,402
Would there be surety
in your answer?

1663
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:24,028
Listen to me, Siddappa!

1664
01:54:24,194 --> 01:54:27,111
If useful, use here only.

1665
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:29,444
Use wherever you can
if you remember.

1666
01:54:29,652 --> 01:54:31,277
I'm like lion.

1667
01:54:31,486 --> 01:54:35,361
It can't shave and I can.
That's the only difference.

1668
01:54:35,527 --> 01:54:38,486
All other characters are same!

1669
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:44,402
Kick of having the last laugh
is terrible!

1670
01:54:45,277 --> 01:54:46,694
Get in!

1671
01:54:46,903 --> 01:54:48,361
Get in quickly, he may beat me.

1672
01:54:56,611 --> 01:55:00,028
Before taking such a big decision,
you've guts to discuss with driver,

1673
01:55:00,194 --> 01:55:01,819
but don't you've the sense
of telling your parents?

1674
01:55:02,028 --> 01:55:03,402
No sir...
- What no?

1675
01:55:03,611 --> 01:55:04,986
Who is he? What does he do?

1676
01:55:05,152 --> 01:55:06,694
How would he look after you
after marriage?

1677
01:55:06,903 --> 01:55:09,028
Don't you want to know anything?
What do you say, Nandu?

1678
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:11,611
If you love, we'll kill,

1679
01:55:12,152 --> 01:55:13,903
if you marry, we'll burn you,

1680
01:55:14,861 --> 01:55:16,694
we're not that foolish
to say like this.

1681
01:55:19,569 --> 01:55:22,402
But we love you.

1682
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:25,111
We respect your love.

1683
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:32,903
You've so much respect for
your daughter's love,

1684
01:55:33,111 --> 01:55:37,152
that man has got no respect
for my daughter's marriage.

1685
01:55:38,986 --> 01:55:42,402
I wanted her marriage feast to spread the
delicious smell to 10 villages around.

1686
01:55:42,611 --> 01:55:44,736
But this trouble has reached
100 villages.

1687
01:55:44,944 --> 01:55:46,235
How embarrassing!

1688
01:55:46,444 --> 01:55:48,652
His father took the dowry,
he dishonoured me.

1689
01:55:48,861 --> 01:55:52,028
My life has become
good for nothing.

1690
01:55:52,194 --> 01:55:55,361
It seems you're a famous lawyer,
please do justice to us.

1691
01:55:55,569 --> 01:55:56,778
Tell me!

1692
01:55:58,277 --> 01:55:59,361
Have it, sir.

1693
01:56:08,527 --> 01:56:11,486
The lady who served you
buttermilk is my sister.

1694
01:56:12,111 --> 01:56:16,986
My brother-in-law left her for festival
promising come back for her in 10 days,

1695
01:56:17,152 --> 01:56:20,486
30 festivals have passed since then,
he didn't turn up, sir.

1696
01:56:23,402 --> 01:56:25,611
If food is left, servants will eat it,

1697
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:30,486
if a girl remains in home,
you can never eat a meal peacefully.

1698
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:36,361
You're at loss if you force
your daughter as his wife.

1699
01:56:36,861 --> 01:56:38,611
Your name...
- Siddappa!

1700
01:56:39,444 --> 01:56:40,486
Siddappa!

1701
01:56:40,861 --> 01:56:44,152
Tell me what did you spend
for the marriage?

1702
01:56:44,611 --> 01:56:47,986
I'll take it as my daughter's marriage
and bear the entire cost.

1703
01:56:49,028 --> 01:56:52,361
What? Will you pay me?

1704
01:56:52,569 --> 01:56:55,277
Are you such a great man
to buy the honour of Siddappa?

1705
01:56:55,486 --> 01:56:56,486
Hey!

1706
01:56:59,028 --> 01:57:00,903
Who said that? Show me!

1707
01:57:01,111 --> 01:57:02,652
How dare you raise weapon at him!
Bring it down.

1708
01:57:02,861 --> 01:57:05,235
Hey... hey... put it down.

1709
01:57:05,444 --> 01:57:08,486
This is for cutting crops.
Not to cut throats!

1710
01:57:08,652 --> 01:57:10,070
If you wish to beat, hit this man.

1711
01:57:10,819 --> 01:57:13,944
He agreed to the marriage
without asking his son.

1712
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:19,235
Why are they after comedian in
the fight between hero and villain?

1713
01:57:21,402 --> 01:57:24,194
They're good people, that's why
they're still talking to us, father.

1714
01:57:24,402 --> 01:57:26,903
Had they been like us,
they would've got us thrown out!

1715
01:57:28,028 --> 01:57:29,070
Sorry sir.

1716
01:57:29,861 --> 01:57:31,361
In sorrow my father...

1717
01:57:44,861 --> 01:57:47,819
I'm asking forgiveness on his behalf.

1718
01:57:49,235 --> 01:57:52,111
It was his mistake to offer your money.

1719
01:57:53,694 --> 01:57:55,903
For the loss of your honour,

1720
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:57,652
honour of my home,

1721
01:57:59,111 --> 01:58:02,111
we'll give our second daughter
in marriage to your younger son.

1722
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:05,694
Take her with you, brother.

1723
01:58:21,277 --> 01:58:25,277
Give her, I'll consider her
as my daughter.

1724
01:58:25,611 --> 01:58:27,070
I'll look after her well.

1725
01:58:27,235 --> 01:58:32,235
My wife too isn't here to offer you
traditionally turmeric and vermillion.

1726
01:58:35,778 --> 01:58:36,611
No problem.

1727
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:38,070
Give her.

1728
01:58:41,903 --> 01:58:43,652
I don't think you're not
here to take your aunt.

1729
01:58:43,861 --> 01:58:46,028
But to arrange her daughters' marriages.

1730
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:03,986
I didn't understand why they fired you
in Dubai after saving their family.

1731
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:07,194
Why should anyone give up a good man?

1732
01:59:07,903 --> 01:59:09,277
I've started to understand now.

1733
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:11,861
We offer prayers to Pipal tree
and call it as God,

1734
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:14,819
but it grows on our house wall,
we cut it.

1735
01:59:18,111 --> 01:59:19,652
Marriages are happening
because of you.

1736
01:59:20,861 --> 01:59:24,277
But if that elderly man gets
irritated with you,

1737
01:59:24,486 --> 01:59:25,903
marriages would get cancelled.

1738
01:59:27,194 --> 01:59:30,819
Siddhu, you're like medicine.

1739
01:59:32,694 --> 01:59:34,361
It too has expiry date.

1740
01:59:38,652 --> 01:59:40,402
I think you'd have understood me.

1741
02:00:20,694 --> 02:00:21,402
Hello!

1742
02:00:21,903 --> 02:00:22,694
Father!

1743
02:00:23,152 --> 02:00:24,694
Grandpa is not well!

1744
02:00:25,277 --> 02:00:28,111
BP is fluctuating rapidly
for the last two days.

1745
02:00:28,277 --> 02:00:31,569
Since morning he's struggling
to breathe.

1746
02:00:31,778 --> 02:00:32,819
He's being given oxygen.

1747
02:00:38,486 --> 02:00:39,694
Come back, Gautham.

1748
02:00:40,277 --> 02:00:41,944
Forget your aunt,

1749
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,277
at least be here to see your
grandpa for the last time.

1750
02:00:46,611 --> 02:00:48,944
No use in me seeing him,
he must see aunt.

1751
02:00:49,611 --> 02:00:50,652
I'll bring her.

1752
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:53,070
I'll bring aunt on his birthday.

1753
02:00:53,694 --> 02:00:55,361
I'll keep up my promise.

1754
02:00:55,611 --> 02:00:58,277
Tell him to stay alive till then
and keep his word.

1755
02:01:00,652 --> 02:01:02,486
Can you hear me?
Tell this in his ears.

1756
02:01:02,694 --> 02:01:04,778
Tell him to stay alive
till I come back.

1757
02:01:06,402 --> 02:01:07,778
Tell him to stay alive!

1758
02:01:15,028 --> 02:01:16,778
One opportunity!

1759
02:01:18,944 --> 02:01:19,903
Just one!

1760
02:01:26,028 --> 02:01:28,652
He brought me as simple as
bringing a suitcase, Prami.

1761
02:01:28,861 --> 02:01:31,235
Thank you, Siddhu.
Thank you... thank you, so much.

1762
02:01:31,444 --> 02:01:32,778
Why are you praising him so much?

1763
02:01:32,986 --> 02:01:34,819
As if he won a war against Pakistan.

1764
02:01:35,028 --> 02:01:37,111
Why are you so jealous?

1765
02:01:37,402 --> 02:01:40,361
Stay here for few more minutes,
your husband will get jealous. Go!

1766
02:01:40,652 --> 02:01:44,111
You're number one is
spoiling any occasion.

1767
02:01:47,986 --> 02:01:50,819
Sashi, please reduce your anger.

1768
02:01:51,028 --> 02:01:53,070
Because your fiancé is little mad.

1769
02:01:53,903 --> 02:01:55,652
So, better cool it off.

1770
02:01:56,194 --> 02:01:57,402
Whom should I marry then?

1771
02:01:59,527 --> 02:02:00,652
Whom should I marry?

1772
02:02:01,611 --> 02:02:04,235
Should I marry one who takes me
into his lap and talks?

1773
02:02:05,486 --> 02:02:07,819
Should I marry one who feeds me fondly?

1774
02:02:08,361 --> 02:02:10,611
Surprised to know
how I remember all this!

1775
02:02:10,819 --> 02:02:11,611
Yes.

1776
02:02:12,778 --> 02:02:14,778
Beat that nurse and he...

1777
02:02:14,986 --> 02:02:17,361
Do you know what my problem is?
You!

1778
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:22,402
The day you entered home,
I liked you!

1779
02:02:26,402 --> 02:02:27,903
I fell flat on first sight!

1780
02:02:28,277 --> 02:02:30,778
What do you want, Sashi?

1781
02:02:31,111 --> 02:02:32,778
Little peace of mind.

1782
02:02:33,028 --> 02:02:34,152
Umm... okay.

1783
02:02:40,527 --> 02:02:41,903
Bloody eyes!

1784
02:02:42,361 --> 02:02:44,402
Though I don't want,
it's entering my dreams too.

1785
02:02:44,611 --> 02:02:46,778
Can I marry a driver for that?

1786
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,277
My sister is marrying an MBA!

1787
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:52,694
Her children would study in Oakridge!

1788
02:02:53,527 --> 02:02:55,819
Will my children study
in Municipal school?

1789
02:02:57,652 --> 02:02:59,986
That's why I used to shout
at you wantonly.

1790
02:03:01,402 --> 02:03:04,111
Go away man!
From my heart and my home!

1791
02:03:04,861 --> 02:03:09,861
When I come near you,
I'll get strange dirty thoughts!

1792
02:03:12,944 --> 02:03:14,361
My heart beat races!

1793
02:03:16,778 --> 02:03:18,486
Cheeks turn warm!

1794
02:03:19,778 --> 02:03:20,903
Legs start shivering.

1795
02:03:21,111 --> 02:03:22,111
Now also!

1796
02:03:22,402 --> 02:03:25,402
I'm wearing long skirt,
nobody can see it.

1797
02:03:25,569 --> 02:03:27,235
I didn't want to tell you.

1798
02:03:27,569 --> 02:03:29,070
Anyway you don't have
an entry into my home.

1799
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:32,402
There's no way we can meet again.
That's why I told you.

1800
02:03:33,611 --> 02:03:35,235
I've to tell you one more thing.

1801
02:03:38,486 --> 02:03:39,611
Close your ears!

1802
02:03:40,861 --> 02:03:43,070
I said I want to tell.
Did I say you must hear it?

1803
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:48,944
I love you!

1804
02:03:49,861 --> 02:03:51,611
No, go to hell!

1805
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:14,611
Oh my God, I can't believe
you said that!

1806
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:16,819
Or am I dreaming that I might
just hear that...

1807
02:04:17,028 --> 02:04:18,986
My heart is racing like Cheetah...

1808
02:04:19,152 --> 02:04:21,944
So, I want to sing this new song...

1809
02:04:39,819 --> 02:04:44,152
Hey girl! You knocked me out with
just a slip of tongue...

1810
02:04:44,402 --> 02:04:48,819
Hey Monster princess, you said
I love you biting your teeth...

1811
02:04:49,028 --> 02:04:53,235
You laid a beautiful trap...
Your love gun shot hit my heart...

1812
02:04:53,444 --> 02:04:57,986
Which is right and which is left...?
I'm intoxicated without having a drink...

1813
02:04:58,152 --> 02:05:02,486
Like using cat ball to spread jasmine...
Like a bomb blew under my shirt pocket...

1814
02:05:02,694 --> 02:05:04,402
I'm getting crazy ideas...

1815
02:05:04,611 --> 02:05:09,611
You made me go bonkers...

1816
02:05:11,569 --> 02:05:16,569
You made me go bonkers...

1817
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:39,152
Oh my God, I can't believe
you said that!

1818
02:05:39,319 --> 02:05:41,361
Or am I dreaming that I might
just hear that...

1819
02:05:41,569 --> 02:05:43,486
My heart is racing like Cheetah...

1820
02:05:43,694 --> 02:05:45,569
So, I want to sing this new song...

1821
02:05:45,778 --> 02:05:49,611
Your lips are strawberries...
Your words are Cadbury...

1822
02:05:50,194 --> 02:05:55,111
You're a walking nursery of
flowers of beauty...

1823
02:05:55,277 --> 02:05:59,277
Colourful gallery of dreams
in my eyes...

1824
02:05:59,486 --> 02:06:04,194
Your mischievous eyes are
filled with intoxicants...

1825
02:06:04,402 --> 02:06:06,402
Aunt's daughter has spread
charm of fragrance...

1826
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:09,652
Offer diamonds on your
beautiful smile...

1827
02:06:09,861 --> 02:06:13,070
I'll hug as new found love
is taking over me...

1828
02:06:13,235 --> 02:06:18,235
You made me go bonkers...

1829
02:06:20,152 --> 02:06:25,152
You made me go bonkers...

1830
02:06:47,486 --> 02:06:52,152
I'm in chaos like sound blast
in Goddess kali festival...

1831
02:06:52,361 --> 02:06:56,778
I'm feeling like I've had
drug laced Bengali sweet...

1832
02:06:56,986 --> 02:07:01,235
Wearing a cowboy's dress...
Riding the horse of Rayalu...

1833
02:07:01,444 --> 02:07:05,778
Staying put on earth...
I feel like stepping one moon...

1834
02:07:05,986 --> 02:07:08,194
Getting incoming calls in
a cell without SIM card...

1835
02:07:08,402 --> 02:07:10,402
Using coal of Singareni
as face powder...

1836
02:07:10,611 --> 02:07:12,444
I'm getting such crazy ideas...

1837
02:07:12,652 --> 02:07:17,652
You made me go bonkers...

1838
02:07:19,486 --> 02:07:24,486
You made me go bonkers...

1839
02:07:49,569 --> 02:07:52,652
Unlike me, tie your husband
to apron strings like your mother.

1840
02:07:52,861 --> 02:07:55,569
You won't spare sister-in-law
even in blessing.

1841
02:07:55,778 --> 02:07:59,070
Isn't it little difficult to bless
for someone who scolds always?

1842
02:07:59,235 --> 02:08:01,361
Murthy!
- Madam!

1843
02:08:02,070 --> 02:08:03,361
You keep pounding!

1844
02:08:04,694 --> 02:08:05,361
Hello!

1845
02:08:05,569 --> 02:08:07,486
It's me Siddappa!

1846
02:08:07,694 --> 02:08:10,235
I called to tell you something.

1847
02:08:10,444 --> 02:08:11,861
Tell me, brother.

1848
02:08:12,070 --> 02:08:15,235
Bhaskar, my brother's son.

1849
02:08:16,194 --> 02:08:18,569
He's coming to your house
tomorrow morning.

1850
02:08:18,778 --> 02:08:22,277
He must conduct this marriage.
That's it!

1851
02:08:22,486 --> 02:08:23,736
Baddam Bhaskar!

1852
02:08:23,944 --> 02:08:25,861
He went to Uganda with just
Rs.2 lakhs investment,

1853
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:27,652
he bought a 10 acre farm,
he ploughed the land,

1854
02:08:27,861 --> 02:08:29,152
he hit a diamond mine!

1855
02:08:29,361 --> 02:08:30,694
With one shot, he hit big time.

1856
02:08:30,903 --> 02:08:34,903
That's all, in 5 years he made
nearly Rs.50000 crores.

1857
02:08:37,277 --> 02:08:38,235
Thank you.

1858
02:08:44,611 --> 02:08:46,778
Dry and use it! Don't lose it!

1859
02:08:46,986 --> 02:08:47,611
Okay?

1860
02:08:47,861 --> 02:08:48,778
Rs.2 lakhs as tip!

1861
02:08:48,986 --> 02:08:50,611
Why are you surprised for this?

1862
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:53,028
He has a wish to win
the coveted Oscar too.

1863
02:08:53,194 --> 02:08:54,152
No way!

1864
02:08:54,361 --> 02:08:57,986
So, he instituted Bhaskar Award
and produced a film.

1865
02:08:58,152 --> 02:08:59,569
Film? What's the film?

1866
02:08:59,778 --> 02:09:02,694
Inspired by Gladiator,
he made a film Radiator!

1867
02:09:02,903 --> 02:09:04,694
How dare you show your back to me!

1868
02:09:04,903 --> 02:09:07,736
Slave, remove your helmet
and tell your name to me.

1869
02:09:07,944 --> 02:09:10,652
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius.

1870
02:09:10,861 --> 02:09:12,569
Father to a murdered son,

1871
02:09:12,778 --> 02:09:14,361
husband to a murdered wife,

1872
02:09:14,569 --> 02:09:16,861
and I'll have my vengeance
in this life,

1873
02:09:17,944 --> 02:09:19,486
Or the next!

1874
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:24,402
He's the director and
he's the hero!

1875
02:09:24,611 --> 02:09:27,819
Our bad luck is,
he plays the heroine's role too!

1876
02:09:28,486 --> 02:09:29,778
Look at that dirty thing!

1877
02:09:38,778 --> 02:09:42,611
If I didn't have my mom and
dad's blessings,

1878
02:09:42,861 --> 02:09:44,486
I wouldn't have reached this stage,

1879
02:09:45,361 --> 02:09:47,111
when people who watched this film,

1880
02:09:47,277 --> 02:09:52,028
and said each scene was like a diamond.

1881
02:09:54,861 --> 02:09:56,152
Tear are rolling down from my eyes.

1882
02:09:56,361 --> 02:09:57,152
Why will you not cry?

1883
02:09:57,361 --> 02:10:00,361
You had to sell 60 diamonds
to finish the film, right?

1884
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:07,778
You must know another
detail about him.

1885
02:10:07,986 --> 02:10:08,778
Madam!

1886
02:10:08,986 --> 02:10:12,486
Rs.2 lakh investment
he stole it from this home only.

1887
02:10:13,778 --> 02:10:15,819
He worked in your place only.

1888
02:10:19,944 --> 02:10:22,152
Boss, I've news for you.

1889
02:10:22,361 --> 02:10:23,986
Some Bhaskar is coming and

1890
02:10:24,152 --> 02:10:27,152
people here are tensed
he may cancel the marriage.

1891
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:29,611
Now, your aunt will know the
value of our boss.

1892
02:10:34,778 --> 02:10:36,694
What would we get if she's sad?

1893
02:10:36,903 --> 02:10:39,111
She must realize and
must come with us.

1894
02:10:39,277 --> 02:10:40,694
That's our goal, right?

1895
02:10:40,903 --> 02:10:42,402
Balu!
- Sir!

1896
02:10:42,611 --> 02:10:45,277
Who can stop us if we enter aunt's
house along with Bhaskar?

1897
02:10:45,486 --> 02:10:47,402
Who can stop us?
Nobody can stop us.

1898
02:10:47,611 --> 02:10:48,611
That's why, do one thing.

1899
02:10:48,819 --> 02:10:49,903
What do you want me to do, sir?

1900
02:10:50,111 --> 02:10:53,444
As soon as Bhaskar lands in India,
we must buy a job with him.

1901
02:10:53,652 --> 02:10:55,070
Difficult, sir.

1902
02:10:56,486 --> 02:11:00,652
Difficult but we can buy, before I could
complete, why did you slap me?

1903
02:11:02,903 --> 02:11:04,819
I'm getting irritated
for giving a pause,

1904
02:11:05,028 --> 02:11:08,277
how dare you give
an explanation for that!

1905
02:11:08,611 --> 02:11:09,778
Bloody fool!

1906
02:11:20,819 --> 02:11:22,486
The home where I worked once!

1907
02:11:25,444 --> 02:11:26,903
People who threw me out!

1908
02:11:29,028 --> 02:11:31,319
Why are they looking at me surprised?

1909
02:11:31,527 --> 02:11:33,361
Looking at you!

1910
02:11:33,819 --> 02:11:35,028
What are you doing here?

1911
02:11:35,194 --> 02:11:37,819
That is...
- He? He's my personal.

1912
02:11:38,028 --> 02:11:39,694
He was working with us
till recently.

1913
02:11:39,903 --> 02:11:42,652
If he quits job with you,
he'll become a good man like this.

1914
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:46,903
If you throw anyone out,
he would become a great man like me.

1915
02:11:47,569 --> 02:11:48,819
Have it.
- Why?

1916
02:11:49,028 --> 02:11:51,152
I got rank!
- Is it?

1917
02:11:51,361 --> 02:11:52,903
I'll throw up if I eat this.

1918
02:11:53,111 --> 02:11:56,028
Just wait, Rs.2 lakhs!
Buy new clothes.

1919
02:11:56,194 --> 02:11:58,111
Sir, that's Rs.2 lakhs!

1920
02:11:58,819 --> 02:11:59,986
After all Rs.2 lakhs!

1921
02:12:00,152 --> 02:12:02,986
You stole the same amount from this
house and got kicked out, right?

1922
02:12:03,152 --> 02:12:05,194
If you kick, gate too would
return in double speed.

1923
02:12:05,402 --> 02:12:08,486
This is Bhaskar!
That's why I came with this speed.

1924
02:12:12,235 --> 02:12:15,235
I love music!
- I love women!

1925
02:12:15,778 --> 02:12:16,819
Every man has his wish!

1926
02:12:17,028 --> 02:12:18,903
Making a statement for it.

1927
02:12:20,070 --> 02:12:20,986
Have it.

1928
02:12:21,152 --> 02:12:23,861
How come your cheeks have
become so chubby?

1929
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:26,402
Using any medicine?
- Yes, I'm using Homeo.

1930
02:12:26,611 --> 02:12:27,819
Continue it.

1931
02:12:28,194 --> 02:12:29,361
All the best.

1932
02:12:29,903 --> 02:12:32,569
Bhaskar sir is very naughty.

1933
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:33,944
Coffee.

1934
02:12:35,861 --> 02:12:37,611
How many children?
- Two!

1935
02:12:37,819 --> 02:12:39,486
You're maintaining body very well.

1936
02:12:39,986 --> 02:12:41,819
Why are you struggling?
What happened?

1937
02:12:42,028 --> 02:12:42,778
It's paining.

1938
02:12:42,986 --> 02:12:45,986
Won't I feel pain if I hold? Go!

1939
02:12:48,486 --> 02:12:50,652
Says painful, don't I know that?

1940
02:12:50,861 --> 02:12:55,861
Sir, I've understood now why people clap
for hero when he beats the villain.

1941
02:12:57,986 --> 02:12:59,611
Hair rising!

1942
02:12:59,819 --> 02:13:01,486
Really?
- Yeah!

1943
02:13:03,486 --> 02:13:06,235
Hey, Bhaskar! How are you?

1944
02:13:07,111 --> 02:13:08,361
Please hold this!

1945
02:13:10,611 --> 02:13:12,152
I think she's coming to hug you, sir.

1946
02:13:12,361 --> 02:13:13,986
It's better to put finger in plug.

1947
02:13:14,152 --> 02:13:15,611
It's been years since I saw you.

1948
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:18,235
If I knew you'd miss me so much,
I'd have sent my photo.

1949
02:13:18,444 --> 02:13:19,486
Carry on with your cooking.

1950
02:13:19,694 --> 02:13:21,944
Thank God, she's gone.

1951
02:13:31,361 --> 02:13:34,277
She was really ugly as
a little girl in gowns.

1952
02:13:34,486 --> 02:13:37,402
How come she has grown
to be so sexy!

1953
02:13:38,986 --> 02:13:39,903
Eh!
- What's that?

1954
02:13:41,402 --> 02:13:44,402
I'll give only expressions,
you must do the job.

1955
02:13:46,486 --> 02:13:47,903
Wait, I'll clear it.

1956
02:13:53,277 --> 02:13:56,903
Hello Bhaskar!
- Greetings, madam.

1957
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:59,819
How do you do?
- Doing fine, madam.

1958
02:14:14,944 --> 02:14:16,694
I've little work, I'll be back.

1959
02:14:16,903 --> 02:14:18,361
Okay, madam.

1960
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:20,652
Why did you do that, sir?

1961
02:14:20,861 --> 02:14:22,444
What did I do?
- You bowed to her.

1962
02:14:22,652 --> 02:14:25,235
I did it involuntarily.

1963
02:14:30,028 --> 02:14:33,694
Bhaskar, your uncle Siddappa
told about you on phone.

1964
02:14:33,903 --> 02:14:36,361
You must conduct the marriage.
- Really? Hey...

1965
02:14:37,694 --> 02:14:40,152
How much are you expecting from me?

1966
02:14:42,444 --> 02:14:43,694
Little bit of civility!

1967
02:14:45,611 --> 02:14:46,527
Civility?

1968
02:14:46,694 --> 02:14:48,652
Goddess of Wealth wants
to enter his home,

1969
02:14:48,861 --> 02:14:52,277
why is he talking about rules,
regulations and signals?

1970
02:14:52,486 --> 02:14:55,028
He insulted you and hurt us, sir.

1971
02:14:55,194 --> 02:14:59,111
That's why we stop this marriage
and celebrate it.

1972
02:14:59,277 --> 02:15:00,402
Have some water.

1973
02:15:00,611 --> 02:15:02,111
Did you see the younger daughter?

1974
02:15:02,277 --> 02:15:04,569
You love her?

1975
02:15:05,652 --> 02:15:06,652
I want her!

1976
02:15:06,861 --> 02:15:08,986
If you want her,
you need to meet a man.

1977
02:15:09,152 --> 02:15:09,944
Who?

1978
02:15:43,652 --> 02:15:46,819
With a smile and
blessing the devotees...

1979
02:15:47,028 --> 02:15:49,652
And love his devotees...

1980
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:54,861
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1981
02:15:55,277 --> 02:15:57,986
Changing lungis and
wearing it as shirt...

1982
02:15:58,152 --> 02:16:00,736
When you bend down...

1983
02:16:00,944 --> 02:16:05,944
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1984
02:16:06,611 --> 02:16:10,111
Life without you is nothing
but darkness...

1985
02:16:11,778 --> 02:16:15,611
If you don't smile,
I'm in chaos...

1986
02:16:17,819 --> 02:16:22,028
A bottle of scent or a bottle of liquor
is nothing compared to your eyes...

1987
02:16:22,194 --> 02:16:23,611
You're one of a kind
in this world...

1988
02:16:23,819 --> 02:16:28,819
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1989
02:16:29,277 --> 02:16:34,277
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1990
02:16:46,111 --> 02:16:47,944
Move... move... move...

1991
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:54,070
Plantain leaf for food...
tobacco for lime...

1992
02:16:54,819 --> 02:16:58,778
Touch Swamy's holy feet
for washing off sins...

1993
02:16:58,986 --> 02:17:01,361
Plantain leaf for food...
tobacco for lime...

1994
02:17:01,569 --> 02:17:04,402
Touch Swamy's holy feet
for washing off sins...

1995
02:17:04,611 --> 02:17:07,111
Plantain leaf for food...
tobacco for lime...

1996
02:17:07,277 --> 02:17:10,111
Touch Swamy's holy feet
for washing off sins...

1997
02:17:10,277 --> 02:17:15,277
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1998
02:17:15,569 --> 02:17:20,569
You're rocking... O Babaji....

1999
02:17:36,861 --> 02:17:37,986
What's that tree?

2000
02:17:38,152 --> 02:17:40,319
Baba got enlightened under that tree.

2001
02:17:40,527 --> 02:17:42,694
That's why it is known as Wisdom tree.

2002
02:17:43,152 --> 02:17:46,235
Friends, devotees of God!
- Lord!

2003
02:17:47,028 --> 02:17:50,611
People plough to raise paddy!
But you ploughed to get diamonds.

2004
02:17:50,819 --> 02:17:51,819
What else do you want, son?

2005
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:55,235
Just because hunger is satiated,
do we stop begging, Swamy?

2006
02:17:55,444 --> 02:17:57,361
I've three wishes.
- What's that?

2007
02:17:57,569 --> 02:17:59,694
I'm here to attend a marriage.

2008
02:17:59,903 --> 02:18:03,402
Sashi... she mustn't get married!

2009
02:18:03,611 --> 02:18:04,736
It won't happen!

2010
02:18:04,944 --> 02:18:06,111
I want her.

2011
02:18:06,277 --> 02:18:10,402
She'll marry which no one can imagine,
is it okay to you, son?

2012
02:18:10,611 --> 02:18:14,194
Since I won't imagine she'll
marry me, so she's all mine.

2013
02:18:14,402 --> 02:18:16,152
Eh?
- Yeah!

2014
02:18:16,361 --> 02:18:17,152
What else?

2015
02:18:17,361 --> 02:18:20,652
My mines and my diamonds,
my currency and my arrogancy,

2016
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:22,111
they must always be with me.

2017
02:18:22,277 --> 02:18:25,986
What you started with would
always be with you, Baddam!

2018
02:18:26,152 --> 02:18:27,569
Son Baddam!
- Swamy!

2019
02:18:27,778 --> 02:18:31,819
To make all your wishes come true,
the tree must be in your home.

2020
02:18:32,778 --> 02:18:33,486
Tree?

2021
02:18:33,694 --> 02:18:35,611
Almond tree in the backyard
of Bhaskar's home!

2022
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:38,486
It'll lift you up from difficulties!

2023
02:18:38,694 --> 02:18:40,111
Well said... well said...

2024
02:18:40,277 --> 02:18:43,778
Car can't hold it, Swamy!
- It'll come in air.

2025
02:18:44,819 --> 02:18:47,652
Ever since I came I've seen only
applying dot and combing hair,

2026
02:18:47,861 --> 02:18:49,444
I'm yet to see your face, Swamy!

2027
02:18:49,652 --> 02:18:53,861
Show mercy on me and
show your face once...

2028
02:18:54,070 --> 02:18:55,070
I beg you!

2029
02:18:55,235 --> 02:18:57,111
Can you bear if I turn?

2030
02:18:57,277 --> 02:19:00,194
I'm turning now!
- Turning!

2031
02:19:00,402 --> 02:19:03,486
Don't blame me for the consequences.
- I'll not.

2032
02:19:06,819 --> 02:19:08,444
I can't see anything.
- Me too!

2033
02:19:08,652 --> 02:19:11,319
New devotee has been blessed
with Baba's divine glimpse!

2034
02:19:11,527 --> 02:19:14,235
Hail Baba!
- It's your good fortune!

2035
02:19:14,444 --> 02:19:16,235
You had the glimpse of Baba
on your first visit.

2036
02:19:38,903 --> 02:19:40,070
Why so many covers?

2037
02:19:46,277 --> 02:19:50,402
If you lie, leaves will fall,
you'll die!

2038
02:19:50,903 --> 02:19:51,778
Let me test it.

2039
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:53,694
I look like Mahesh Babu.

2040
02:19:57,611 --> 02:19:58,986
Leaves fell, sir.

2041
02:19:59,152 --> 02:20:02,819
I can see it.

2042
02:20:03,028 --> 02:20:06,361
I'm very intelligent.

2043
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:08,903
Fell again.
- Fell, you lied.

2044
02:20:11,778 --> 02:20:13,652
I'm an idiot!
- That's true, sir.

2045
02:20:14,194 --> 02:20:16,152
Not a leave fell, so...
- I can see that.

2046
02:20:16,361 --> 02:20:16,986
Why are you telling me?

2047
02:20:17,152 --> 02:20:20,652
Why did you come here?
Go away from here.

2048
02:20:24,444 --> 02:20:25,694
I don't want you.

2049
02:20:27,070 --> 02:20:29,111
No... go away!

2050
02:20:29,903 --> 02:20:30,903
May I go away?

2051
02:20:33,028 --> 02:20:34,819
Where do you want me to go?

2052
02:20:35,652 --> 02:20:36,819
Go away!

2053
02:20:37,819 --> 02:20:39,111
I hate you.

2054
02:20:41,277 --> 02:20:42,111
Go away!

2055
02:20:43,861 --> 02:20:44,903
Who is there?

2056
02:20:47,028 --> 02:20:48,194
What? What happened?

2057
02:20:48,402 --> 02:20:49,444
Asking me what happened?

2058
02:20:49,652 --> 02:20:51,319
Is it respectable house
or public garden?

2059
02:20:51,527 --> 02:20:53,486
What happened, sir?
- Asking me what has happened?

2060
02:20:53,694 --> 02:20:55,986
A girl about to marry
is romancing servant...

2061
02:20:56,152 --> 02:20:59,486
Why are you looking shocked?
Am I narrating any epic?

2062
02:20:59,694 --> 02:21:00,861
They both were in each other's hug.

2063
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:02,736
I think people watching it
would die getting suffocated.

2064
02:21:02,944 --> 02:21:04,819
What? What's your problem?

2065
02:21:07,527 --> 02:21:08,486
You were saying something.

2066
02:21:08,694 --> 02:21:09,986
Your girl is fire!

2067
02:21:10,152 --> 02:21:11,152
Leaves didn't fall, sir.

2068
02:21:11,361 --> 02:21:12,402
I was wrong.

2069
02:21:12,611 --> 02:21:14,194
Did you observe one thing?
- What's it?

2070
02:21:14,402 --> 02:21:16,152
Leaves fell without wind blowing.

2071
02:21:16,361 --> 02:21:19,486
That too when you were talking
about a topic.

2072
02:21:19,694 --> 02:21:22,778
It didn't fell earlier and
then later, did you observe this?

2073
02:21:23,028 --> 02:21:25,235
I heard about mad people but seeing
them for the first time in life.

2074
02:21:25,444 --> 02:21:26,070
I think he said something.

2075
02:21:26,235 --> 02:21:29,444
Nothing, your madam is calling.
- Is it? Coming, madam.

2076
02:21:29,652 --> 02:21:32,819
Is it false that girl and our boy
were hugging each other, sir?

2077
02:21:33,028 --> 02:21:34,903
It could be a lie.

2078
02:21:35,361 --> 02:21:40,194
But what I'm planning to do
with Sashi tonight is real.

2079
02:21:40,402 --> 02:21:42,028
Bhaskar loves arts.
- Is it?

2080
02:21:42,194 --> 02:21:43,194
Lalitha... Kala...
- Who are they?

2081
02:21:43,402 --> 02:21:47,028
It means fine arts not girls, sir.

2082
02:21:47,194 --> 02:21:50,486
Since you said fine arts, I mean games
like medley of songs and tombola...

2083
02:21:50,694 --> 02:21:52,402
How about gilli, marbles and others!

2084
02:21:52,611 --> 02:21:54,444
These are not arts!

2085
02:21:54,652 --> 02:21:55,694
Theatre!

2086
02:21:55,903 --> 02:21:57,235
It's on the verge of extinction.

2087
02:21:57,444 --> 02:21:58,319
We must give a new life to it.

2088
02:21:58,527 --> 02:21:59,986
He wants to get the second one to bed.

2089
02:22:00,152 --> 02:22:03,652
I too love theatre, sir.
- I'll make you perform it.

2090
02:22:03,861 --> 02:22:06,986
What's the play's name, sir?
- Ahalya is innocent girl!

2091
02:22:07,152 --> 02:22:08,194
Then, we must find two girls.

2092
02:22:08,402 --> 02:22:10,694
Ahalya and innocent are
not two girls.

2093
02:22:10,903 --> 02:22:12,694
Ahalya is innocent.

2094
02:22:12,861 --> 02:22:16,111
So much twist in title itself!
You cunning fellow!

2095
02:22:16,277 --> 02:22:19,070
I've plenty of twists in the story!

2096
02:22:19,235 --> 02:22:20,152
What's the concept, sir?

2097
02:22:20,361 --> 02:22:22,903
Gautham and Ahalya are a couple,

2098
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:27,402
Indra loves Ahalya since a long time,
- Isn't it wrong, sir?

2099
02:22:27,611 --> 02:22:30,070
If he asks, Ahalya too would
say the same,

2100
02:22:30,235 --> 02:22:31,569
he made a plan,

2101
02:22:31,778 --> 02:22:34,569
before dawn breaks at 5 am,
by 4 am...

2102
02:22:37,819 --> 02:22:38,778
...he cooed like a rooster!

2103
02:22:38,986 --> 02:22:43,028
Gautham as usual took the towel
and left to river bank for bath.

2104
02:22:43,194 --> 02:22:46,652
Taking this opportunity,
Indra disguises himself as Gautham,

2105
02:22:46,861 --> 02:22:48,235
and goes to Ahalya,

2106
02:22:48,444 --> 02:22:51,194
seeing Ahalya with carnal desires,

2107
02:22:51,361 --> 02:22:54,819
he patted sleeping Ahalya
on shoulder to wake her up.

2108
02:22:59,486 --> 02:23:02,028
Enough of seeing me,
deliver your dialogue.

2109
02:23:03,402 --> 02:23:06,152
Swamy! Didn't you go to the river?

2110
02:23:06,361 --> 02:23:09,486
When you're in the room,
why would I go to river?

2111
02:23:09,694 --> 02:23:11,986
Saying this he pushed her on the bed,

2112
02:23:12,152 --> 02:23:14,111
he passionately occupied her.

2113
02:23:19,527 --> 02:23:20,694
Hey!

2114
02:23:22,444 --> 02:23:24,152
You went to take bath, right?
Why did you come so early?

2115
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:27,694
Are you blind?
I took the towel but forgot soap.

2116
02:23:27,903 --> 02:23:29,694
I took a dip and came back.

2117
02:23:29,903 --> 02:23:32,028
Take the soap and
have a good clean bath.

2118
02:23:32,194 --> 02:23:32,903
What?

2119
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:36,235
I said take the soap and
have a good clean bath.

2120
02:23:36,444 --> 02:23:38,361
What would you do with
my wife meanwhile?

2121
02:23:38,569 --> 02:23:40,152
I'm Indra, I can do anything.

2122
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:42,778
Then, I'm Gautham.
I too can do anything.

2123
02:23:42,986 --> 02:23:46,694
I'll punch... pinch... bite...

2124
02:23:59,152 --> 02:24:02,361
Only one man beat me but
why do I feel like many hands?

2125
02:24:03,277 --> 02:24:04,361
Something wrong.

2126
02:24:05,152 --> 02:24:08,986
Roles... reverse.

2127
02:24:16,944 --> 02:24:18,778
Ahalya, where's my towel?

2128
02:24:26,111 --> 02:24:27,486
Patting shoulder...

2129
02:24:28,111 --> 02:24:30,028
If you pat as and where you wish,
why do you need me or script?

2130
02:24:31,402 --> 02:24:34,611
She got serious when I patted,
why is she laughing when he does it?

2131
02:24:35,152 --> 02:24:36,277
Swamy!
- Devi!

2132
02:24:36,486 --> 02:24:37,611
Didn't you go to the river?

2133
02:24:37,819 --> 02:24:40,111
You're in my heart,
how can I go to the river?

2134
02:24:41,361 --> 02:24:41,986
Good!

2135
02:24:42,152 --> 02:24:43,486
We used room in script, right?

2136
02:24:43,694 --> 02:24:44,736
I think he has improvised it.

2137
02:24:44,944 --> 02:24:46,152
Didn't you do it by patting
on buttocks?

2138
02:24:46,361 --> 02:24:48,444
How can you compare him with me?

2139
02:24:48,652 --> 02:24:50,986
I'll show what improvisation is!
- Come, my dear...

2140
02:24:51,152 --> 02:24:52,652
I'm unable to bear this
separation, dear.

2141
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:54,819
Please imprison me in your arms.

2142
02:24:55,028 --> 02:24:56,444
What's this?
- Please do something.

2143
02:24:56,652 --> 02:24:59,235
What's this?
Leave her!

2144
02:25:00,152 --> 02:25:01,486
What's this?

2145
02:25:01,694 --> 02:25:04,235
Didn't you take bath in river?
- Am I like you?

2146
02:25:04,444 --> 02:25:06,819
No bath, I just washed my face,
that's all.

2147
02:25:07,444 --> 02:25:08,819
Why didn't you show this
intelligence before?

2148
02:25:09,028 --> 02:25:10,903
What are you saying?

2149
02:25:11,111 --> 02:25:14,986
You've such a big watch on hand,
if rooster cocks,

2150
02:25:15,152 --> 02:25:17,152
if you leave a sleeping wife,
- So what?

2151
02:25:17,361 --> 02:25:18,861
People like me would get
into the bed with her, right?

2152
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:21,277
What are you blabbering?

2153
02:25:21,444 --> 02:25:22,569
What's that?

2154
02:25:22,778 --> 02:25:23,986
What's that?

2155
02:25:24,152 --> 02:25:27,778
Why are you raising your voice?
- I'll raise my hand also.

2156
02:25:29,444 --> 02:25:34,152
Why are you beating me?
- Not just beat, I'll bite you.

2157
02:25:34,361 --> 02:25:36,235
Oh no!

2158
02:25:52,861 --> 02:25:54,152
This time, I'll play Ahalya.

2159
02:25:54,361 --> 02:25:55,611
Fight and kill yourselves.

2160
02:25:55,819 --> 02:25:58,694
You get up... get up... go...

2161
02:26:01,277 --> 02:26:02,194
Has it dawned so quickly?

2162
02:26:02,402 --> 02:26:04,070
Why are you still sleeping, Ahalya?
Where's my towel?

2163
02:26:06,070 --> 02:26:07,611
Pat on the shoulders.

2164
02:26:08,194 --> 02:26:09,402
Should you pat him also there?

2165
02:26:09,611 --> 02:26:11,611
What sex appeal does he have?

2166
02:26:11,861 --> 02:26:14,694
Didn't you go to river, Swamy?

2167
02:26:14,903 --> 02:26:18,194
When you're in room,
what would I do in the river?

2168
02:26:18,652 --> 02:26:19,819
Devi!
- Yes.

2169
02:26:20,028 --> 02:26:21,152
Come.
- You come closer.

2170
02:26:21,361 --> 02:26:22,361
Hey...

2171
02:26:23,070 --> 02:26:24,402
Hey...

2172
02:26:24,778 --> 02:26:25,861
With whom you're having an affair?

2173
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:28,111
With whom you're having an affair?
- Didn't you go to take bath, Swamy?

2174
02:26:28,277 --> 02:26:31,402
I did go but suspected you're having
an affair with someone I came back.

2175
02:26:31,611 --> 02:26:32,652
Come, this side.
- Okay.

2176
02:26:32,861 --> 02:26:33,486
Why don't you beat him?

2177
02:26:33,694 --> 02:26:36,569
I'll beat him but first I'll beat you.

2178
02:26:36,778 --> 02:26:39,028
I'll beat him later but
tell me one thing,

2179
02:26:39,194 --> 02:26:39,778
What's it?

2180
02:26:39,986 --> 02:26:43,152
You're my wife for 25 years, right?
- Yes.

2181
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:46,277
If so, can't you differentiate
between husband and paramour?

2182
02:26:46,486 --> 02:26:48,652
I mean...
- You mean? Go ahead.

2183
02:26:48,861 --> 02:26:51,235
I mean...
- You're crossing limits.

2184
02:26:51,444 --> 02:26:54,152
Do you know what would I do
with women like you?

2185
02:26:54,361 --> 02:26:55,861
Do you know what would I do?
- What will you do?

2186
02:26:56,070 --> 02:26:57,235
May I tell you?
- Tell me.

2187
02:26:57,444 --> 02:26:59,486
I'll tell you... I'll tell you...

2188
02:26:59,694 --> 02:27:01,152
Not just beat, I must bite you.

2189
02:27:01,361 --> 02:27:02,652
Bite... bite...

2190
02:27:09,152 --> 02:27:11,611
Do you need the role of Ahalya
for your beauty?

2191
02:27:11,861 --> 02:27:13,694
Why this dangerous desire at this age?

2192
02:27:15,361 --> 02:27:16,778
I got it now.

2193
02:27:17,527 --> 02:27:20,652
I'm just a spectator!
Fight and kill yourselves.

2194
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:23,402
Please entertain me.
That's all!

2195
02:27:27,152 --> 02:27:29,569
Dawned so quickly?
Where's my towel?

2196
02:27:43,194 --> 02:27:45,194
I'll see how he can beat me!

2197
02:27:45,402 --> 02:27:46,944
I'll also see, sir.

2198
02:27:48,694 --> 02:27:51,070
She's senseless anyway!
What happened to you?

2199
02:27:51,235 --> 02:27:52,152
You know she's not your wife, right?

2200
02:27:52,361 --> 02:27:56,361
Will you beat her now?
- Not her but you... you...

2201
02:27:59,444 --> 02:28:01,944
Actually I mustn't beat you.

2202
02:28:03,152 --> 02:28:05,277
Hello Baddam, sir!

2203
02:28:06,778 --> 02:28:10,028
Do you know what's happening here?
- I wrote the play, right?

2204
02:28:10,194 --> 02:28:11,277
Right?

2205
02:28:11,486 --> 02:28:14,652
Is he her husband?
- No, he's Indra.

2206
02:28:14,861 --> 02:28:16,319
In such a scene,

2207
02:28:16,527 --> 02:28:21,070
Ahalya, the man who has come now
is not your husband Gautham,

2208
02:28:21,235 --> 02:28:23,152
he's treacherous rogue Indra,

2209
02:28:23,361 --> 02:28:25,152
instead of telling her the truth,

2210
02:28:25,361 --> 02:28:28,652
pushing your pot belly up and
pushing everything else behind,

2211
02:28:28,861 --> 02:28:31,194
what are you watching legs
wide spread and moving it?

2212
02:28:31,402 --> 02:28:34,903
Will you beat me for this point too?

2213
02:28:35,111 --> 02:28:38,152
I'll beat you on any point.

2214
02:28:38,361 --> 02:28:41,152
The nation is facing so much flak
because of people like you.

2215
02:28:41,361 --> 02:28:42,486
Thrash him!

2216
02:28:44,819 --> 02:28:48,652
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2217
02:28:48,861 --> 02:28:51,694
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2218
02:28:51,903 --> 02:28:54,444
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2219
02:28:54,652 --> 02:28:57,569
Great hunter, I trust you...

2220
02:28:57,778 --> 02:29:00,486
Great hunter, I trust you...

2221
02:29:00,694 --> 02:29:05,694
O lord, you rule over me...

2222
02:29:06,194 --> 02:29:07,986
You mauled the devil with anger...

2223
02:29:08,152 --> 02:29:11,986
Taking on the might...

2224
02:29:12,235 --> 02:29:16,903
O lord, you rule over me...

2225
02:29:17,569 --> 02:29:22,569
You appeared and
vanished in a flash...

2226
02:29:23,819 --> 02:29:28,819
You gave Vedas to Brahmins...

2227
02:29:29,903 --> 02:29:34,903
O lord, you rule over me...

2228
02:29:35,152 --> 02:29:37,070
You mauled the devil with anger...

2229
02:29:37,235 --> 02:29:41,235
Taking on the might...

2230
02:29:41,444 --> 02:29:46,444
O lord, you rule over me...

2231
02:29:47,944 --> 02:29:50,736
I beg you, madam,
I think he'll kill me.

2232
02:29:50,944 --> 02:29:52,277
Please send him out., madam.

2233
02:29:52,486 --> 02:29:54,944
Why are you raising hell?
Come here, Bhaskar.

2234
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:01,277
I want to talk to you,
please come in.

2235
02:30:11,861 --> 02:30:13,194
What are you up to?

2236
02:30:13,611 --> 02:30:16,235
If Bhaskar gets irritated
he may tell his uncle,

2237
02:30:16,444 --> 02:30:18,070
and stop this marriage,

2238
02:30:18,235 --> 02:30:20,486
can you take that responsibility?

2239
02:30:21,694 --> 02:30:23,361
You want Sunanda.

2240
02:30:24,152 --> 02:30:27,070
But the woman here
is Sunanda Shekar.

2241
02:30:28,361 --> 02:30:32,361
Shekar won't get separated from my name,
Sunanda will not come to your home.

2242
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:39,111
Go away... from this home
and our lives!

2243
02:31:06,486 --> 02:31:08,861
Did you get the entire list, Priest?
- Yes, sir.

2244
02:31:09,070 --> 02:31:11,111
Why aren't you still ready?

2245
02:31:11,778 --> 02:31:13,319
Groom's people would be here
in an hour.

2246
02:31:13,527 --> 02:31:15,028
Does she really like this marriage?

2247
02:31:15,194 --> 02:31:17,486
You're not having any
secret twists, right?

2248
02:31:18,361 --> 02:31:20,611
Why don't you answer your uncle?

2249
02:31:21,611 --> 02:31:25,486
Alarm failed to ring,
why are you getting tensed for this?

2250
02:31:27,736 --> 02:31:28,819
Amulu, come here.

2251
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:31,819
Saris are upstairs...
- Madam...

2252
02:31:32,028 --> 02:31:32,819
Okay.

2253
02:31:33,361 --> 02:31:34,235
Definitely.

2254
02:31:34,861 --> 02:31:35,819
I'll come.

2255
02:31:36,569 --> 02:31:38,402
I said I'll come.

2256
02:31:38,694 --> 02:31:39,694
Okay.

2257
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:41,111
Cut it.

2258
02:31:41,361 --> 02:31:42,402
Cut the call.

2259
02:32:06,361 --> 02:32:08,111
Sashi sister is missing.

2260
02:32:08,277 --> 02:32:09,652
Her clothes and jewels too
are missing.

2261
02:32:09,861 --> 02:32:11,861
What else?
She would've eloped with Siddhu.

2262
02:32:14,944 --> 02:32:16,903
How do you know?

2263
02:32:18,402 --> 02:32:20,361
Like this, she said that before me.

2264
02:32:20,569 --> 02:32:22,611
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

2265
02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:27,819
I thought she would forget her love
and marry the man chosen by family...

2266
02:32:35,569 --> 02:32:38,361
Earlier he took away future
son-in-law now future daughter-in-law.

2267
02:32:38,527 --> 02:32:40,861
You said you sent him out of home.

2268
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:43,194
Who brought him here again?

2269
02:32:45,152 --> 02:32:46,611
I know a thing.

2270
02:32:46,819 --> 02:32:48,111
But I don't know if it is true or false.

2271
02:32:48,277 --> 02:32:50,694
Tell me the thing,
I'll give the explanation.

2272
02:32:50,903 --> 02:32:52,861
If it's lie, leaves will fall, uncle.

2273
02:32:53,070 --> 02:32:56,194
What do you lose if leaves fall?
Tree will die.

2274
02:32:56,402 --> 02:32:58,111
If tree dies,
I too would die, uncle.

2275
02:32:58,277 --> 02:32:59,235
What's that nonsense?

2276
02:32:59,444 --> 02:33:02,277
Not nonsense, I and tree are
one and same.

2277
02:33:02,486 --> 02:33:04,986
We're connected with
each other, you know.

2278
02:33:06,652 --> 02:33:09,444
If you kill a bird with it,
you can at least eat it.

2279
02:33:09,652 --> 02:33:10,861
What will you get if you fire at me?

2280
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:12,861
If kept, I'll stink and
if you burn, just ash.

2281
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:14,694
If you don't tell
what really had happened,

2282
02:33:14,903 --> 02:33:17,694
people will tell tales about you.

2283
02:33:22,694 --> 02:33:24,486
Why are you so dull?

2284
02:33:24,861 --> 02:33:26,235
Your mother told me to leave home.

2285
02:33:27,903 --> 02:33:30,028
Shall we both go away together?
- Where to?

2286
02:33:30,194 --> 02:33:32,402
Chennai.
- How?

2287
02:33:33,028 --> 02:33:33,736
Catch a train.

2288
02:33:33,944 --> 02:33:36,402
They'll know from my hotel desk
if it is flight.

2289
02:33:38,194 --> 02:33:40,277
Can you live with a driver like me?

2290
02:33:40,903 --> 02:33:42,194
Any doubt?

2291
02:33:42,944 --> 02:33:44,152
I don't want anything.

2292
02:33:45,070 --> 02:33:45,694
True!

2293
02:33:47,111 --> 02:33:50,819
4 or 5 crores is enough.
- 4 or 5 crores?

2294
02:33:51,277 --> 02:33:52,111
We need to live, right?

2295
02:34:03,527 --> 02:34:04,861
I didn't tell any lie now, right?

2296
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:08,361
It didn't fall for your lies
but Siddhu used this remote control.

2297
02:34:10,111 --> 02:34:10,903
Thimmapur

2298
02:34:11,111 --> 02:34:13,652
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2299
02:34:13,861 --> 02:34:16,986
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2300
02:34:17,152 --> 02:34:22,152
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2301
02:34:32,402 --> 02:34:34,152
What are you thinking?

2302
02:34:34,361 --> 02:34:36,569
There are many cars in Chennai
for you to drive.

2303
02:34:36,778 --> 02:34:39,152
There are many buildings
for me to design.

2304
02:34:39,361 --> 02:34:40,611
Don't worry.

2305
02:34:43,235 --> 02:34:45,652
If we don't find any job,
if we sell this necklace,

2306
02:34:45,861 --> 02:34:47,361
we can live recklessly for a year.

2307
02:34:47,569 --> 02:34:49,402
You don't get tensed.
Okay?

2308
02:34:49,611 --> 02:34:52,819
Without wasting time,
if we've a son or daughter,

2309
02:34:53,028 --> 02:34:56,778
and send their photo,
my parents will come for us.

2310
02:35:56,361 --> 02:35:58,611
Sir, please give me alms!

2311
02:36:22,235 --> 02:36:24,778
A ticket to Mumbai please.
- This train goes to Madras.

2312
02:36:26,944 --> 02:36:27,903
Give me a ticket to some place, sir.

2313
02:36:28,111 --> 02:36:29,694
If you don't I may die in suffocation.

2314
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:40,070
Do you know to read Urdu?

2315
02:36:40,402 --> 02:36:42,277
After seeing him beating our men,

2316
02:36:42,486 --> 02:36:45,361
I've learnt Chinese and painting too.
Sit here.

2317
02:36:47,152 --> 02:36:52,152
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2318
02:37:00,444 --> 02:37:05,444
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2319
02:37:10,361 --> 02:37:15,361
Hail Lord Murugan!
Hail Lord Murugan!

2320
02:37:31,152 --> 02:37:35,277
Lord Jesus! I'm seeing him for
the first time in my life.

2321
02:37:35,903 --> 02:37:40,903
I made vow to visit Velankanni
Mary church on my knees.

2322
02:37:42,527 --> 02:37:43,861
These are my tickets.

2323
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:47,235
This is certificate of
physically handicap.

2324
02:37:47,819 --> 02:37:49,736
You beat me recently, right sir?

2325
02:37:49,944 --> 02:37:51,486
I lost two teeth.

2326
02:37:52,235 --> 02:37:55,402
Losing anything which God gave
would make me handicap, right?

2327
02:37:55,611 --> 02:37:57,861
That's why I got this certificate, sir.

2328
02:37:58,070 --> 02:38:00,694
Can I board the train?
Thank you.

2329
02:38:00,903 --> 02:38:02,652
God bless you, my son.

2330
02:38:03,277 --> 02:38:03,861
Siddhu!

2331
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:05,277
Flight is ready, sir.

2332
02:38:05,486 --> 02:38:07,194
Why flight?
Waste of money for flight.

2333
02:38:07,402 --> 02:38:09,861
No need to buy tickets, he owns flight.

2334
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:12,694
It is ready on runway now.

2335
02:38:14,486 --> 02:38:16,194
We've taken permission to
bring cars on platform, sir.

2336
02:38:16,402 --> 02:38:17,611
No need.

2337
02:38:17,778 --> 02:38:19,111
Isn't Siddhu a driver?

2338
02:38:19,277 --> 02:38:21,903
After seeing us, if you're
asking us this question,

2339
02:38:22,111 --> 02:38:23,986
I don't know if you're mad or foolish!

2340
02:38:33,819 --> 02:38:35,778
Boss, they're here!

2341
02:38:38,152 --> 02:38:39,361
Balu!
- Sir?

2342
02:38:39,569 --> 02:38:41,361
I want this station for 15 minutes.

2343
02:38:41,569 --> 02:38:44,194
If you ask suddenly now...

2344
02:38:44,402 --> 02:38:45,986
There's a price for everything, buy it.

2345
02:38:46,152 --> 02:38:47,152
What about the passengers?

2346
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:48,569
Send them by special flights.

2347
02:38:48,778 --> 02:38:50,277
If there are no airports,
send them by cars.

2348
02:38:50,486 --> 02:38:52,736
Send a message to Ministry,
request the station master.

2349
02:38:52,944 --> 02:38:55,194
Threaten him if he refuses,
if still he refuses, kill him.

2350
02:38:55,402 --> 02:38:58,152
This meeting is very important
for me... very important.

2351
02:38:58,361 --> 02:39:00,944
I'm giving you 5 minutes.
5 minutes!

2352
02:39:32,194 --> 02:39:33,569
You want my daughter?

2353
02:39:33,778 --> 02:39:35,361
Come here... come...

2354
02:39:35,861 --> 02:39:39,986
Nobody can bridge the distance
between front and back seat of a car.

2355
02:39:40,152 --> 02:39:42,070
Aren't you ashamed of eloping
with a driver?

2356
02:39:42,235 --> 02:39:43,361
Leave her.

2357
02:39:43,569 --> 02:39:46,319
See who is holding whom
and then speak!

2358
02:39:46,527 --> 02:39:50,402
How dare you answer me!
I'll kill you!

2359
02:39:50,611 --> 02:39:52,361
I'll kill you!
- Hey, move...

2360
02:39:53,694 --> 02:39:56,361
I'll kill you.

2361
02:40:04,569 --> 02:40:08,361
You'd be having a theory why a car
driver shouldn't marry your daughter,

2362
02:40:08,569 --> 02:40:12,652
why a penny worth lawyer shouldn't
marry his daughter,

2363
02:40:12,861 --> 02:40:15,903
her father shouldn't have
a theory, right?

2364
02:40:16,861 --> 02:40:19,652
You can go to his home after marrying.

2365
02:40:19,861 --> 02:40:22,694
But you can't bear to see
your daughter with a suitcase.

2366
02:40:25,361 --> 02:40:27,861
You'll exile a family for
getting shot on shoulder,

2367
02:40:28,070 --> 02:40:30,652
but you can point a gun on my head!

2368
02:40:30,861 --> 02:40:34,070
Yours is love and
what others do is desire!

2369
02:40:34,611 --> 02:40:37,694
If you do it is role model,
if others do, it's haste!

2370
02:40:37,903 --> 02:40:41,152
If you shout, it is affection,
if my grandpa shouts, it's arrogance.

2371
02:40:41,861 --> 02:40:42,694
Isn't it?

2372
02:40:43,861 --> 02:40:44,861
Who are you?

2373
02:40:45,070 --> 02:40:49,111
The lady you married, I'm her nephew.

2374
02:40:49,361 --> 02:40:52,277
A man who is burning with
the memories,

2375
02:40:52,486 --> 02:40:53,778
I'm his son!

2376
02:40:54,194 --> 02:40:58,070
Grandson of a man is fighting death.

2377
02:40:59,070 --> 02:41:02,152
Thousands of crores,
factories in 10 countries,

2378
02:41:02,361 --> 02:41:04,152
one lakh workers,

2379
02:41:04,361 --> 02:41:06,652
nothing of this gives us content,
we're just poor people.

2380
02:41:06,861 --> 02:41:08,277
Heir of Nandas!

2381
02:41:10,194 --> 02:41:11,819
What has changed since then, aunt?

2382
02:41:12,028 --> 02:41:13,778
It was in grandpa's hand
and now he's carrying it.

2383
02:41:14,028 --> 02:41:15,277
That's the only difference, right?

2384
02:41:17,444 --> 02:41:20,319
If my grandpa was wrong then,
what you did now is also wrong,

2385
02:41:20,527 --> 02:41:21,778
leave your daughter,

2386
02:41:22,861 --> 02:41:23,903
I'll take her with me,

2387
02:41:24,778 --> 02:41:27,611
if you're right now,
then he was right that day!

2388
02:41:27,819 --> 02:41:29,778
You come with me,
I'll take you with me.

2389
02:41:31,028 --> 02:41:33,819
I'm telling you this to convince
with my intelligence, aunt.

2390
02:41:34,028 --> 02:41:36,861
My aim is to tell you and
grandpa both were wrong.

2391
02:41:37,861 --> 02:41:41,070
If the price of his haste
is losing you,

2392
02:41:41,235 --> 02:41:43,819
the price of your anger is losing
parents' home for 25 years.

2393
02:41:45,778 --> 02:41:49,152
The day you left home,
had you turned for a second, aunt,

2394
02:41:49,361 --> 02:41:51,070
you'd have heard another shriek,

2395
02:41:55,444 --> 02:41:57,111
had you heard that shriek,

2396
02:41:58,486 --> 02:42:00,486
these 25 years would've
been different, aunt.

2397
02:42:01,194 --> 02:42:02,277
Totally different!

2398
02:42:04,861 --> 02:42:09,861
You don't worry, brother.
I'll not file any case on your father.

2399
02:42:10,861 --> 02:42:11,402
Come.

2400
02:42:12,903 --> 02:42:14,070
What has happened to me?

2401
02:42:15,402 --> 02:42:18,070
Am I God if I make some money?

2402
02:42:19,611 --> 02:42:21,694
Would I shoot my own daughter?

2403
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:26,152
Man like me mustn't live.

2404
02:42:27,569 --> 02:42:30,611
I'll die!

2405
02:42:31,194 --> 02:42:33,486
I'll die!
- Stop, father!

2406
02:42:34,569 --> 02:42:37,694
Enough of the disaster
this house has seen today.

2407
02:42:37,903 --> 02:42:40,152
If I die...
- No, father...

2408
02:42:40,361 --> 02:42:42,778
Please don't stop me.

2409
02:42:42,986 --> 02:42:45,986
No, father...
- Don't stop me... don't stop me!

2410
02:42:46,152 --> 02:42:46,986
Please father...

2411
02:42:47,152 --> 02:42:49,361


2412
02:43:06,028 --> 02:43:06,944
Janani!

2413
02:43:10,152 --> 02:43:12,486
Janani!

2414
02:44:07,194 --> 02:44:09,986
You left grandpa for hurting
uncle's shoulder,

2415
02:44:10,152 --> 02:44:12,778
what should I do with grandpa
who killed my mother, aunt?

2416
02:44:13,861 --> 02:44:16,277
Why did a gun fire
which was silent for 10 years?

2417
02:44:16,486 --> 02:44:17,694
Isn't it because of you?

2418
02:44:17,903 --> 02:44:20,486
How much I should hate you
and that old man?

2419
02:44:20,861 --> 02:44:22,361
But I didn't do like that.

2420
02:44:22,819 --> 02:44:25,028
I grew up holding his hand.

2421
02:44:25,194 --> 02:44:26,819
Just because he asked me,

2422
02:44:27,028 --> 02:44:30,111
I came to you as your driver
and opened the door for you.

2423
02:44:30,277 --> 02:44:32,277
Can't you come and open the
door of his home, aunt?

2424
02:44:34,444 --> 02:44:37,569
Every problem in life
gives us two ways,

2425
02:44:37,778 --> 02:44:40,694
One is filled with love
and another with hatred.

2426
02:44:41,819 --> 02:44:44,694
I chose the first and
you chose the second way.

2427
02:44:45,903 --> 02:44:47,903
Come to my way once, aunt.

2428
02:44:48,361 --> 02:44:49,361
Just once!

2429
02:44:55,819 --> 02:44:58,903
As a child I didn't know
why I had no mother,

2430
02:44:59,861 --> 02:45:01,611
didn't understand why you won't come,

2431
02:45:02,611 --> 02:45:04,402
I used to be very angry, aunt,

2432
02:45:06,235 --> 02:45:09,402
I used to wage invisible war
with unseen enemy, aunt.

2433
02:45:09,611 --> 02:45:11,611
Invisible war!

2434
02:45:19,152 --> 02:45:21,486
Living good isn't living away,

2435
02:45:21,819 --> 02:45:23,819
live happily with relatives!

2436
02:45:24,861 --> 02:45:27,903
Though we earned a lot, we could never
fill the void left by you, aunt.

2437
02:45:30,569 --> 02:45:32,694
Still we keep a plate on dining table,

2438
02:45:33,028 --> 02:45:34,277
a room in our home,

2439
02:45:34,611 --> 02:45:36,903
25 paise of every rupee we earn,

2440
02:45:37,444 --> 02:45:38,944
we've kept it for you, aunt.

2441
02:45:41,611 --> 02:45:43,611
We love you so much, aunt.

2442
02:45:44,569 --> 02:45:49,569
Just say one word, I'll stand guard
against all your difficulties.

2443
02:45:50,527 --> 02:45:55,527
For one mistake, we've been saying
sorry for 25 long years, aunt.

2444
02:45:56,152 --> 02:45:57,611
We're saying sorry!

2445
02:45:58,903 --> 02:46:00,903
We can't wait anymore, aunt.

2446
02:46:01,402 --> 02:46:02,611
Can't wait anymore.

2447
02:46:03,277 --> 02:46:06,486
If possible forgive us
or else punish us.

2448
02:46:07,361 --> 02:46:12,361
But please recognise us
for God's sake, aunt!

2449
02:46:40,611 --> 02:46:42,070
Make a call, Gautham.

2450
02:46:44,861 --> 02:46:46,903
I want to talk to father.

2451
02:46:51,944 --> 02:46:53,277
I'm worried.

2452
02:46:59,569 --> 02:47:03,819
Where you win isn't great but
where to bend makes you greater!

2453
02:47:18,611 --> 02:47:21,694
Gautham... come.

2454
02:47:21,861 --> 02:47:24,070
He's no more a mother less child!

2455
02:47:24,402 --> 02:47:25,694
He has mother now.

2456
02:47:34,903 --> 02:47:39,070
Shekar, my nephew!

2457
02:47:41,486 --> 02:47:42,611
Our son-in-law!

2458
02:47:56,486 --> 02:47:58,444
He's right.
- No!

2459
02:47:58,652 --> 02:47:59,778
He's great!

2460
02:48:00,903 --> 02:48:02,819
What? What great?

2461
02:48:03,028 --> 02:48:05,736
Will he use my love
to convince my mother?

2462
02:48:05,944 --> 02:48:09,111
Let him use it,
how did you know his history?

2463
02:48:10,652 --> 02:48:14,486
There's internet on phone,
his name gives hundreds of pages.

2464
02:48:15,486 --> 02:48:17,778
Why did you kidnap me?

2465
02:48:18,111 --> 02:48:20,986
They didn't do it,
I engaged them to do it.

2466
02:48:22,070 --> 02:48:23,028
Bhaskar?

2467
02:48:23,277 --> 02:48:24,111
Sashi!

2468
02:48:27,235 --> 02:48:29,694
We don't want your jewels
or your money.

2469
02:48:29,903 --> 02:48:30,611
Come, boys.

2470
02:48:32,028 --> 02:48:35,152
Please give me your watch, brother.

2471
02:48:35,361 --> 02:48:37,611
Why?
- As your memorabilia, brother.

2472
02:48:37,819 --> 02:48:38,694
Is it?

2473
02:48:39,152 --> 02:48:40,152
Okay.

2474
02:48:41,028 --> 02:48:41,778
Take it.

2475
02:48:42,861 --> 02:48:44,194
Bye, brother.
- Bye, brother.

2476
02:48:44,402 --> 02:48:46,694
Your bad time will vanish
and good time will arrive.

2477
02:48:49,194 --> 02:48:49,903
Sashi...

2478
02:48:50,881 --> 02:48:51,952
Where are you going?
Hey!

2479
02:48:51,952 --> 02:48:52,498
- Sir.

2480
02:48:52,569 --> 02:48:55,152
I'll sell a mine and see their end.

2481
02:48:55,361 --> 02:49:00,361
Uganda President announced that private
diamond mines would be nationalized.

2482
02:49:02,819 --> 02:49:05,070
In the train accident...

2483
02:49:05,235 --> 02:49:10,235
Rocking... my entire street
was rocking...

2484
02:49:12,152 --> 02:49:13,277
Is it an item song?

2485
02:49:13,486 --> 02:49:14,486
Oh God!

2486
02:49:14,986 --> 02:49:16,694
I thought it was a devotional song.

2487
02:49:17,611 --> 02:49:18,444
Hey you fake Swamy!

2488
02:49:18,652 --> 02:49:23,652
Though I'm a fake Swamy,
didn't I fulfill your 3 boons?

2489
02:49:24,152 --> 02:49:24,986
Did you?

2490
02:49:25,152 --> 02:49:26,903
May I?
- Tell me.

2491
02:49:27,861 --> 02:49:29,611
Her marriage must get stopped.

2492
02:49:31,028 --> 02:49:31,694
It got stopped, right?

2493
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:34,111
Marriage was cancelled.

2494
02:49:35,235 --> 02:49:37,235
She'll marry a man
you can never imagine.

2495
02:49:37,444 --> 02:49:39,944
Did you imagine it would be?
No, right?-  It's Okay.

2496
02:49:40,111 --> 02:49:40,694
Now!

2497
02:49:42,028 --> 02:49:45,152
My currency, my arrogancy
must always be with me.

2498
02:49:45,361 --> 02:49:49,277
What you started with would
be with you only.

2499
02:49:50,903 --> 02:49:53,028
After losing your mines
and spending all your money,

2500
02:49:53,194 --> 02:49:54,569
you're left with Rs.2 lakhs.

2501
02:49:55,152 --> 02:49:56,819
How can you appoint
your grandson as CEO?

2502
02:49:57,028 --> 02:49:58,152
He's crazy.

2503
02:49:58,361 --> 02:50:00,694
It's not right to keep so many
people's future in his hands.

2504
02:50:00,903 --> 02:50:04,070
I own 60% of this company.

2505
02:50:04,235 --> 02:50:05,819
How dare you suggest to me!

2506
02:50:06,028 --> 02:50:09,402
40% only, sir,
Sunanda who owns 20% isn't here.

2507
02:50:09,611 --> 02:50:11,819
She'll never come.

2508
02:50:55,486 --> 02:50:57,361
Sunanda, what I'm saying is...

2509
02:50:59,444 --> 02:51:00,277
Please sit down.

2510
02:51:05,152 --> 02:51:08,361
I propose Gautham as CEO!

2511
02:51:10,444 --> 02:51:11,944
Any objections? Eh?

2512
02:51:15,028 --> 02:51:16,111
Hey, Yaji!

2513
02:51:16,486 --> 02:51:17,903
Do you have anything to say?

2514
02:51:21,694 --> 02:51:23,361
The devil is back!

2515
02:51:35,986 --> 02:51:37,694
Lost crores but left with coat.

2516
02:51:46,569 --> 02:51:51,569
A small spark on the edge of dark...

2517
02:51:53,194 --> 02:51:58,194
A victory of dream coming true...

2518
02:52:00,152 --> 02:52:05,152
A sweet call on the edge of lip...

2519
02:52:07,028 --> 02:52:12,028
A turn for good in the
barrenness of separation...

2520
02:52:13,861 --> 02:52:16,986
Like a breaking dawn in the east...

2521
02:52:17,152 --> 02:52:20,319
Happiness spread around like light...

2522
02:52:20,527 --> 02:52:25,527
Weather is spring forever to
make flowers of happiness bloom...

2523
02:52:27,444 --> 02:52:32,444
Hearts have come together
to make life sweeter...

2524
02:52:33,778 --> 02:52:38,778
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

2525
02:52:41,152 --> 02:52:46,152
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord....

2526
02:52:48,652 --> 02:52:53,652
He's enemy of demon King Ravana...
Most valiant Lord Rama...

2527
02:52:55,652 --> 02:53:00,652
Worship lord of the lords...
O glorious lord...

2528
02:53:34,152 --> 02:53:37,861
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2529
02:53:38,070 --> 02:53:40,986
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2530
02:53:41,152 --> 02:53:43,819
Katamarayudu... Kadiri Narasimha...

2531
02:53:44,028 --> 02:53:46,861
Great hunter, I trust you...

2532
02:53:47,070 --> 02:53:49,986
Great hunter, I trust you...

2533
02:53:50,152 --> 02:53:55,152
O lord, you rule over me...

2534
02:53:55,486 --> 02:53:57,361
You mauled the devil with anger...

2535
02:53:57,569 --> 02:54:01,486
Taking on the might...

2536
02:54:01,694 --> 02:54:06,694
O lord, you rule over me...

2537
02:54:07,028 --> 02:54:12,028
You appeared and
vanished in a flash...

2538
02:54:13,152 --> 02:54:15,986
You gave Vedas to Brahmins...

2539
02:54:16,152 --> 02:54:19,028
You gave Vedas to Brahmins...

2540
02:54:19,194 --> 02:54:24,194
O lord, you rule over me...

2541
02:54:24,527 --> 02:54:26,402
You mauled the devil with anger...

2542
02:54:26,611 --> 02:54:30,486
Taking on the might...

2543
02:54:30,694 --> 02:54:35,694
O lord, you rule over me...
