1
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:24,138
We Indians...

2
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:30,708
in the name of
our Gods...

3
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:36,755
hereby solemnly pledge,
that henceforth...

4
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:45,121
every deed of ours shall be
for the Motherland...

5
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:53,395
for the welfare of humanity,
irrespective of caste and creed.

6
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:58,775
Victory to India!

7
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,948
He wants to know not
the religion you follow

8
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:30,162
But God will certainly want to
know what deeds you have done

9
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:14,044
You are our religion,
our faith

10
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,045
We mean everything to you

11
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:20,418
And you mean everything to us

12
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,357
August 15;
India's Independence Day.

13
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:49,836
Everything we shall do,
for you, beloved nation

14
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,907
Our hearts are for you

15
00:03:54,184 --> 00:04:00,783
We shall lay down our lives
for you, too

16
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,016
Our hearts, we have given you

17
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:10,823
We shall give you our lives, too,
beloved Motherland

18
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:29,601
You are the one I do my deeds for;
you are the one I have faith in

19
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,040
You are my self-respect

20
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:42,906
We shall sacrifice ourselves
for you, O Nation

21
00:05:54,996 --> 00:06:02,868
Live and die, we shall...
for you, O beloved nation

22
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:58,988
Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs
and Christians...

23
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:03,686
We share this country;
we are one

24
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,659
What tries to
separate them...

25
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:20,940
is not religion;
but the feelings of the devil

26
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:30,108
Live we shall, for you;
and die for you too, beloved nation

27
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:22,991
These fires and devastation;
these bullets of hatred...

28
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:32,766
Hoodlums, they are;
robbing dreamy-eyed brides

29
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:43,753
They shed their own blood
and call it a festival

30
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:52,017
Live and die, we shall for you,
beloved nation

31
00:08:54,097 --> 00:09:01,696
We have given our hearts to you;
we shall lay down our lives, too

32
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:07,672
For you, beloved nation

33
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,853
There are two types
of criminals.

34
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:28,522
The ones who turn criminals due to
poverty and circumstances.

35
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,029
Dharma, for instance,
belongs to that category.

36
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,497
And there are those for whom
crime is a profession.

37
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,870
Dr. Dang, for instance, who
belongs to the latter category.

38
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:41,267
It's believed that you've appealed to
the Government for Dharma's release.

39
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,775
Yes, that's true.

40
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:49,811
Six years ago, Dharma had
come to the jail...

41
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,743
to serve a life sentence
for murder.

42
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,746
Do you know why he had
committed the murder?

43
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:59,817
Because his younger brother was
battling for his life...

44
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,548
in the hospital, around the same
time that this incident took place.

45
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:06,557
My brother is lying unconscious
in the hospital, Sir.

46
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:09,230
I must rush these bottles of blood
for his operation.

47
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,897
Please let me go.
My truck is parked far away.

48
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,899
Go and park yourself
far away, too. Go away!

49
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,969
Don't be so stone-hearted.

50
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:19,301
Should I not reach there in half
an hour, my brother will die!

51
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:22,133
Let me do my duty. You may come
when your turn comes. Go away now.

52
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,809
Sir, please come here.

53
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,653
Are you in a hurry?
- Yes.

54
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:38,148
D'you have 300 Rupees on you?
- No. I'd have 20 or 25 Rupees.

55
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,151
20 or 25 Rupees is not enough.
Go and stand in the queue. Come on!

56
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:42,996
Go away, I say!

57
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:47,566
My brother will die!
- How can I help it? Go away!

58
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:53,700
Scoundrel! This blood was
meant for my brother.

59
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,742
This blood was meant to
save my brother's life.

60
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:00,202
You're a killer.
I won't spare you!

61
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,677
How would you describe
a crime of this nature?

62
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:14,148
I tried on my part, and
instead of a life imprisonment...

63
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:18,162
Dharma lived behind the bars
for four years.

64
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:24,625
Today, he's leading an honourable
life in his village.

65
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,162
What is your opinion about
a criminal like Dr. Dang?

66
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:33,734
On the strength of their power
and wealth, these foreigners...

67
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,708
want to cause disturbances
and unrest in our country.

68
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:42,709
These terrorists, who kill thousands
of innocent children and people...

69
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,720
should be termed as not just
criminals, but as demons.

70
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:51,059
It's the prime duty of every
religion and every human being...

71
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,795
to eliminate such demons.

72
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:59,694
And we will surely give these
demons a fitting reply.

73
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,812
We've arrested Dr. Dang.

74
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:19,220
The well-known international leader
of terrorists, Dr. Michael Dang...

75
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:25,214
who was also the chief of Operation
Black Star has been arrested.

76
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,791
Dr. Dang will be taken to a secret
place under tight police security.

77
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,234
Wonderful!
This is going to be great fun.

78
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,240
Where's Rana Vishwapratap Singh,
your jailor?

79
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,079
It's very nice meeting you.
I've heard a lot about you.

80
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,139
You've penned some
wonderful novels.

81
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:32,243
Your knowledge of crime
and criminals is amazing.

82
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:40,722
As I said, I'd heard of the Sitaram
Central Jail, while in Germany.

83
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:51,295
Wonderful! This is going to be fun.

84
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,306
In the 50 years of my career,
I've visited the whole world.

85
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,777
I've been in nearly all the jails,
but only for short periods.

86
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,873
There must hardly be a jail where
I've stayed for even one week.

87
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,712
I must've spent 2 or 3 days at most,
and was out in that much of time.

88
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,249
The jailer of every such prison has
always accorded respect to me.

89
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,748
I was taken care of
all the while.

90
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:19,990
This fellow speaks as if he's not
a prisoner, but a minister!

91
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:28,068
Please arrange for some cushioned
beds, a writing table, and...

92
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,740
a telephone too. But please
do not forget flowers.

93
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:41,045
This chamber is too small. It's a
matter of only a few days anyway.

94
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:44,315
I'll send a list of all the
things that I might need.

95
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,983
The painting in this room
is very ugly.

96
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:49,723
Please arrange to have
this room painted.

97
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:07,740
Angry old man!
This is going to be fun.

98
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:17,144
It's very important to know in which
jail Dr. Dang has been lodged.

99
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,143
By arresting Dr. Dang...

100
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:23,925
the Indians are posing a
serious threat to our plans.

101
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:26,649
We'll give a fitting reply
to their challenge.

102
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,796
We are ready for a showdown.

103
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,134
You'll have to tell us
the name of the Indian jail...

104
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,774
where Dr. Dang, our boss,
has been lodged!

105
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,604
I will not reveal it.

106
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,875
I just need to say 'Go'
on this telephone...

107
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,214
and your whole family in Delhi will
be wiped out in one single blast.

108
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,021
At least the nation
will be saved.

109
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,535
This DSP was in-charge of the
security of Minister Tripathi.

110
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:16,064
Tripathi played a crucial role
in the arrest of Dr. Dang.

111
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,539
Mr. Tripathi is here!

112
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,683
Greetings, sister-in-law!
- Greetings to you!

113
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,215
Ever since you've become a Minister,
you've forgotten that we exist.

114
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:37,291
You're right. To carry out a
Minister's responsibilities...

115
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,790
one is compelled to neglect
domestic responsibilities.

116
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:42,226
What a life! I travel a lot
between my home and New Delhi.

117
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,896
My respects to you!
- May you live long!

118
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,565
Grandpa!
The Minister has arrived!

119
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:55,103
My dear daughter! You haven't
given me a kiss since this morning.

120
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:58,735
So I can't see
or hear anything.

121
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:04,548
I suppose you remember the engagement
ceremony scheduled for Monday.

122
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:08,049
I do. But I'm sorry to say
that I won't be able to attend.

123
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,547
But, I promise that I'll
surely attend the marriage.

124
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,156
Why even attend the marriage?
What for?!

125
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:16,991
You'd better come when Anil
becomes a father...

126
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,156
and his son grows up too.
Or arrive when his son gets married.

127
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,865
There! Here comes the jailor
with a staff in his hand!

128
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,569
If Uncle doesn't attend,
I won't get engaged.

129
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:28,237
Don't you commit
this mistake ever!

130
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:32,804
Had I depended on this chap,
I'd never have got married.

131
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:36,137
It would've been a lot better.
Your wife would've blessed me.

132
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:39,116
She would've been spared
a life of bondage with you.

133
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:47,182
Don't be carried away by his talks.
He thrives on the gift of the gab.

134
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:53,187
He was famous for his
speeches in college...

135
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,294
while I was famous
for my action... my deeds.

136
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,968
That's why you became an employee
while I became a Minister.

137
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:08,569
What do you mean?
- You've lost the bet.

138
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:11,945
Didn't I tell you, the Government
would reject your application?

139
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,239
It has been rejected.
- Which application?

140
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:19,147
Just because he has written
a couple of books on criminals...

141
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:21,612
he's now obsessed with
this new idea.

142
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,780
He sent the Government
the scheme...

143
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:27,017
under which he wants to release
a few dangerous criminals...

144
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:29,628
and wants to reform them
with love.

145
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:32,195
And by forming an army
of such criminals...

146
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:36,968
he intends to eliminate criminals
and terrorists in the nation.

147
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:40,633
If your Government hasn't paid
heed to my request...

148
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:43,206
it's the Government which
is the loser, not me.

149
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,479
But did the Government not award you
with a gold medal for your book?

150
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,274
That's an old habit
of the Government.

151
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,651
It confers a gold-medal even if
it doesn't approve of something.

152
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:53,809
But they did honour you!
- They did, all right.

153
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,683
At least you accept something!
- You too will accept it.

154
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,947
What'll I accept?
- You'll attend Anil's engagement.

155
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:01,491
And if you don't attend...
- But please listen to me...

156
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,152
To hell with everything!

157
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,626
The Commissioner is on the phone.
- I'll be back.

158
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:13,627
Uncle! You're his only friend.

159
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:16,634
If you don't attend,
we'll all be hurt.

160
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:29,211
I sent you a request for a sofa,
a chair and a writing table.

161
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,679
Your request has been turned down.
- Why?

162
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,447
Because this is a jail,
not a hotel.

163
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,453
Love for other criminals,
and hatred for me, eh?

164
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,186
What's the reason?

165
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,528
They turned to crime
due to circumstances.

166
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,966
Whereas, you're among those
who create such circumstances.

167
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,470
I can't understand why the
Government lets you live...

168
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,474
and allows you to carry on
spreading the poison?

169
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,481
How big is your family?

170
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,680
I mean how many children
do you have?

171
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:14,728
900 million.

172
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:19,762
I asked you about your children,
not about India's population.

173
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:25,033
You might look at it as population.
But for me, they are my children.

174
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,767
They are the children of
the family of India.

175
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,043
Don't you feel that you're
too much of a patriot?

176
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:35,013
Every true Indian
ought to be a patriot.

177
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:41,010
Each of your Indian can be
bought over for two pennies each.

178
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,783
You may even try to
buy me over then.

179
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,788
You're here. And I'm here, too.

180
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,797
Try it out.

181
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:05,765
Greetings, Uncle.
- May you live long. Congrats!

182
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:09,273
My brother and sister-in-law
have arrived too.

183
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,510
Telephone your father, and ask him
to come home immediately.

184
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,047
He's always busy
with his official work.

185
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:21,114
Father...
- Yes, son?

186
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,089
Uncle and aunty have
already arrived.

187
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,790
I'm coming.
I'm busy with my work.

188
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,791
Mother's terribly angry, father.
- Pass over the telephone to her.

189
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,960
Mother's not willing
to talk to you.

190
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:39,296
Just do as I say.
Give her the phone.

191
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,211
Just listen to me...

192
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,105
The sound of your bangles tells me
that you're angry.

193
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:55,583
What did you say?

194
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,324
Deliberately? ...Me?!

195
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,519
Do you know that C.B.I. Officers
from Delhi are here on a visit?

196
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,093
I've to prepare a report,
and submit it to them today.

197
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,189
How much time will I take?

198
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,665
At least an hour.

199
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:18,538
He's arrived.

200
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:21,734
Greetings.

201
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,107
How about a bet?
- Bet on what?

202
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:28,617
An officer being bashed up.
There she is!

203
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,848
That Dang harassed me like crazy.

204
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:40,759
The thing is... before
everybody present...

205
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:43,698
Go upstairs and
get dressed quickly.

206
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:52,864
A difficult question, this one.
It comes up time and again

207
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:59,912
At this age, my wife still asks me
if I love her

208
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:06,849
My asks me...
do you love me?

209
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,457
And what did you say?

210
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:16,689
I've been saying it for years!
I love you...

211
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:23,594
Every day and every moment,
I've said, I love you

212
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:28,169
Day in and day out...
even as I work, I love you

213
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,868
When I get back home every evening,
I say, I love you

214
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:37,508
I sleep and eat, drink
and walk... I love you

215
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:41,920
My wife still asks,
do you love me?

216
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,614
I keep repeating...

217
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,920
I love you

218
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,491
I've sired three sons.
And yet...

219
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,690
I love you

220
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,228
I'm an officer everybody respects.
But...

221
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,504
I love you

222
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,866
I throw my weight around everywhere.
And yet...

223
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:06,165
I love you

224
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,841
I'm scared, when I step
into the house

225
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,253
There's one song I sing for you,
darling... just this song

226
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:32,930
Everything I shall do, darling.
Just for you

227
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:42,943
I've given you my heart.
I shall give you my life, too

228
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:29,953
No other promise matters.
Nothing else does

229
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:39,558
There is nothing more
precious than your love

230
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:51,006
I shall live and die...
just for you, darling

231
00:25:52,609 --> 00:26:00,482
I've given you my heart.
I shall give you my life, too

232
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:33,002
You come first

233
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:38,016
Everyone else comes
after you

234
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:47,015
You have been my effort;
you shall be my outcome

235
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:58,902
Live for you, I do.
Die for you, I will, darling

236
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:08,001
I've given my heart to you.
I'll lay down my heart for you, too

237
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,899
Dr. Dang creates war!

238
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,099
This is the first time ever that
somebody has slapped Dr. Dang!

239
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:04,085
Did you hear the
echo of this slap?

240
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:13,085
You also will hear
the echo of this echo.

241
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:18,089
You'll surely hear it.

242
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:24,100
Till as long as you live,
you'll continue to hear it.

243
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:30,908
I'll never forget your slap.

244
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:33,977
You should surely not forget it.

245
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:38,146
I'm glad that you've realised the
impact of an Indian slap.

246
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,144
Just remember that it was
only one hand at work.

247
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:47,593
And then, you're quite an
intelligent person yourself.

248
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:18,189
Give him two of these tablets
with some turmeric-laced milk.

249
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:24,726
You'll recover completely
by tomorrow.

250
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:28,630
You've got to dance
at Anil's marriage.

251
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,966
You must dance
and make merry.

252
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:33,896
You were the source of joy at his
engagement, and the wedding...

253
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:37,035
What happened?
- I'll go and check.

254
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:54,244
The PSO has attacked the jail!
Please stay in here!

255
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:57,057
No.
- Do as I say.

256
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,741
Hurry up!

257
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,125
Madam! Please don't go
any further!

258
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,987
Mother...

259
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,421
Grandpa! Grandpa!

260
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:36,609
Greetings.

261
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:41,145
Take that away!

262
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:59,534
She's got to carry my message
to Rana Vishwanath Pratap Singh.

263
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:05,139
Madam, please deliver my
message to him.

264
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:12,745
Tell him that this is me...

265
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:15,481
and this is him...

266
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,484
Mother!

267
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:19,486
And these are the children
of India, your Motherland.

268
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:21,489
Mother!

269
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:16,703
Mr Sharma!

270
00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,946
God Almighty...

271
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,558
What happened?
And how did it happen?

272
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,889
It was the PSO...

273
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:32,938
Now you will hear the
echo of this echo, too.

274
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:35,946
The echo!

275
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,072
Rukmani...

276
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,572
How did it happen?
Where are our children?

277
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:45,209
Father!

278
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:53,451
C'mon!

279
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:55,536
Anil is still breathing.

280
00:37:56,048 --> 00:38:01,451
Don't you lose courage, okay?
We'll go to the hospital.

281
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,984
Everything will be fine.

282
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:21,700
The terrorists have killed them.

283
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:25,408
The poor woman lost her elder son.
The younger one is dead, too.

284
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:27,539
Move back, will you?!

285
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:30,836
What're you doing standing here?
They've already gone inside.

286
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:32,704
Go on!

287
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,483
Where are you taking her?
She has not been harmed.

288
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:42,824
The wounded have already gone inside.
- She has lost her speech.

289
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:45,721
What?
- She has lost her speech.

290
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:49,720
Lost her speech?

291
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:21,057
For you, beloved nation...

292
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:35,429
Mother went there to administer
medicines to a sick prisoner.

293
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,036
I had accompanied her.

294
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,600
What kind of people were they?

295
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:44,475
Don't be afraid. Think again.
Please try to remember.

296
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,546
Calm down, please.

297
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,119
Why do you ask her?
What can she say?

298
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:57,789
Her young sons have been killed.
She had a full family.

299
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:07,801
Mr. Tripathi?

300
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:17,472
Where's Rana?
- He's sitting over there.

301
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,610
How could you resign your job?

302
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:27,077
What do you want to prove?

303
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,683
Do you want to prove
to the world that...

304
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:34,851
a person like Dr. Dang
has crushed your courage?

305
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:40,862
Not at all.
- Then why have you resigned?

306
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:45,866
I've resigned because...

307
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:54,871
only I will now fight the
battle with Dr. Dang.

308
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,641
All alone?
- Yes.

309
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:03,382
No. We're all with you.

310
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,180
I've been discussing this with
the Ministry for four days.

311
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,860
The Government has rejected
your resignation.

312
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:15,594
But they've accepted your
proposal for an experiment.

313
00:41:18,669 --> 00:41:20,864
Here's your letter of approval
from the government.

314
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:23,631
You can now choose whichever
three criminals you wish...

315
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:27,867
and embark on whatever secret
mission against PSO and Dr. Dang.

316
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,610
You've chosen three criminals
from a list of 72 prisoners.

317
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,373
Do you know, all three of them
have been sentenced to death?

318
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,443
I know that.

319
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:15,612
According to intelligence
reports...

320
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:20,450
all three are sentimental fools
and terribly mean-minded, too.

321
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:24,920
They're hardcore criminals;
not worthy of being trusted.

322
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:32,927
Can I meet these three criminals?
- Sure.

323
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:37,507
This is your first prisoner,
Baiju Thakur.

324
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,604
The High Court has sentenced him
to be hanged...

325
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,770
for having killed four people.

326
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:46,576
He's presently lodged
at the Nasik Jail.

327
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,928
Let me explain this in short.

328
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:11,931
I've no interest in you,
not in your country...

329
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,775
not in the friends or enemies
of your country.

330
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,946
I'm not even interested
in myself.

331
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,944
Have you come to
grant me life?

332
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:28,445
Not to grant you life,
but to ask you for life.

333
00:43:28,957 --> 00:43:32,688
You mean there is death
on both sides.

334
00:43:32,994 --> 00:43:35,827
If you die here,
it'll be a shameful death.

335
00:43:36,498 --> 00:43:39,990
And if you die there,
you'll be declared a martyr.

336
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,435
Which means, death is
certain, isn't it?

337
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:44,829
No.

338
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:50,006
If you survive and return,
you'll be respected by the world.

339
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,771
Now, that's something.

340
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,447
This is a nice opportunity
to make the slip.

341
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:01,953
Sir... you've shown me
the right path.

342
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:05,852
Shall we go?

343
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,756
After choosing a prisoner
from the Nasik jail...

344
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,361
Mr. Rana has gone to
the Hyderabad Jail.

345
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:15,460
The prisoner that he has gone
to meet is a former terrorist.

346
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:20,631
Before he was arrested, the PSO
smashed his right hand.

347
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:26,003
They broke my hand! The bastards
made an invalid out of me!

348
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,573
They made me use this hand to fire
on kids of innocent people!

349
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,509
I was a blind fool!

350
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:40,146
I trusted them.

351
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:45,755
And one day, they told me that
I have to commit a murder.

352
00:44:47,097 --> 00:44:49,031
I have to murder Heena.

353
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:54,559
I had to kill Heena,
my sweetheart!

354
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:58,496
She was a policeman's sister.
I refused.

355
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:09,574
So they killed Heena.

356
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:13,015
They then cut off my hand!

357
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:24,496
Rexson is a stooge of
Dr. Dang... the scoundrel!

358
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:30,367
I'd change my name if I don't feed
his flesh to the vultures.

359
00:45:31,905 --> 00:45:35,499
But, Sir... you can go away.

360
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:38,770
I don't vibe well
with the government.

361
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:41,069
It's futile. Go away.

362
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:48,577
The trouble is that you follow
your heart, not your mind.

363
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:53,521
Today is the 16th of September.
- I know.

364
00:45:53,992 --> 00:45:56,426
You'll be hanged to death
on the 21st of September.

365
00:45:57,595 --> 00:45:59,586
You will depart from this world.

366
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:04,033
On the same night, Rexson and
Dr. Dang will celebrate your death.

367
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:11,032
You will be buried with your
ambitions in this very jail.

368
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:18,603
What you say is right.

369
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,517
I really follow my heart,
and not my mind.

370
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:26,912
I've always been close to those
who follow the heart.

371
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:31,824
Do you trust me?
- They have betrayed your trust.

372
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:35,590
I know for sure that you
will not betray my trust.

373
00:46:40,936 --> 00:46:42,927
He can save you
from the noose.

374
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:47,507
Really? Can you save me
from being hanged?! How?

375
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:50,606
If you obey all that
Mr. Rana wants you to.

376
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,103
Mr Rana!

377
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,145
In that case, you are my God!
And I'm your devotee.

378
00:46:56,716 --> 00:47:00,777
My Master, my Lord, my Boss!
Save me, please!

379
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:04,079
I swear upon the dust on your shoes.
Please save me.

380
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:10,859
I'm speaking the truth. Ever since
the judge passed the sentence...

381
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:13,531
I've been imagining a dirty cloth
hanging by the pole...

382
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:15,724
and I've been hanged to death!

383
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:18,392
My neck has been stretching
like this, ever since!

384
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,902
My Lord! Please save me!
I'm very scared of death.

385
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:24,332
This is my first time!
And I'm not used to dying.

386
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:26,908
What say? Please tell me.

387
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:31,604
Shall I switch on the light?
- First let go of my feet.

388
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:32,940
Here goes!

389
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,778
Please switch on the light,
my Lord.

390
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,854
You'd better understand
one thing clearly.

391
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,925
I'll have the right over the life
that is being granted to you.

392
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,830
You'll have the right.
I'll consider myself dead.

393
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,169
I'll live my life exactly
as you want me to.

394
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:03,840
I'll sit when you ask me to.
And get up, when want.

395
00:48:04,113 --> 00:48:05,444
I swear!

396
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:32,334
Why have our foreheads been
marked with the sacred mark?

397
00:48:34,608 --> 00:48:36,803
Have you ever seen a goat being
marked on its forehead...

398
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,342
before it is slaughtered?

399
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:41,443
You should understand.

400
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:56,784
Take care of your sister.

401
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:03,333
I'm taking one of your belongings
with me.

402
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:06,531
This...

403
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:12,002
You won't be there. But your
voice will be with me.

404
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:24,913
Whatever you say,
you've changed our appearance.

405
00:49:33,396 --> 00:49:35,364
Who's playing the banjo?

406
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:37,931
Anil, my younger son.

407
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:41,796
Wonderful! By the way,
I play banjo very well, too.

408
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:44,668
I know. That's why I've
brought one for you.

409
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,907
Fantastic!
May you live long.

410
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:51,402
Hear that? Dada Thakur has
brought a banjo for me.

411
00:49:52,346 --> 00:49:54,712
Want me to play
something on this?

412
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:02,712
Dada! You said we've got
to travel thousands of miles.

413
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:05,984
Do we have hear such boring
devotional songs all the way?

414
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:08,485
Why don't you play
a film song?

415
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:18,437
This is not a devotional song.

416
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:21,465
It's a song written
by my wife.

417
00:50:23,475 --> 00:50:26,468
We used to sing this song
together at prison jail.

418
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:17,491
I consider myself fortunate
that you've visited me.

419
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:22,054
But I cannot control my tears
upon hearing the ghastly news.

420
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:25,055
You'll have to
control your tears.

421
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:33,665
The tears will remain our secret
till we have achieved our goal.

422
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:36,532
This secret I shall keep
in my heart, Mr. Rana.

423
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,805
Don't call me Rana.
Call me Dada Thakur.

424
00:51:40,547 --> 00:51:42,810
That's right. Dada Thakur.

425
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:48,543
This is the Indian border.

426
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:50,821
Before Dr. Dang's arrest...

427
00:51:50,957 --> 00:51:53,926
the PSO and their trucks
often frequented the place.

428
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:55,826
But not anymore.

429
00:51:57,029 --> 00:52:01,989
This is the place from where several
infiltrators have entered our nation.

430
00:52:05,804 --> 00:52:11,504
The PSO is said to have organised a
very huge camp across the border.

431
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:18,382
We're thrilled at your arrival.

432
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,677
I suppose you've understood
the game plan?

433
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:25,020
Greetings.
- Greetings.

434
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:27,055
This is Mr. Laxminarayan.

435
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,788
Mr. Laxminarayan is a
very good friend.

436
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,551
He's a leading official in the
Indian Government.

437
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:34,460
He wants to join our gang.

438
00:52:34,564 --> 00:52:37,056
We've deposited 50,000 dollars
in his account.

439
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,558
I suppose you've told him the
rules of joining us, Kittam Kittu?

440
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,393
Yes, I've explained it to him.

441
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:43,871
Before joining the PSO,
we take a holy pledge.

442
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,473
The pledge has to be taken there.
And here's the coconut.

443
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:47,804
Where's the coconut?

444
00:52:47,944 --> 00:52:49,934
Here's the coconut. Go and break
it there. It'll mean that...

445
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:52,605
you've taken the pledge, and
you've joined our group. Go on.

446
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:54,576
I see...

447
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:57,379
God is Great!

448
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,558
You're a fool, Rexson.
- What do you mean?

449
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:11,058
He didn't come to meet me,
but to ruin us.

450
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:13,556
He was from the CID in India.

451
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:20,900
Indian revolutionaries had
killed my father in 1947.

452
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:24,806
It was on that day, that I'd
sworn to ruin India one day.

453
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:30,377
I'll break India into
pieces within a year.

454
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:33,414
God is Great!

455
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:37,611
I want a powerful man like you
to sit on that throne.

456
00:53:38,524 --> 00:53:40,458
God is Great!

457
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:45,922
For this purpose, there should
be powerful leaders like you.

458
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:48,622
I trust you completely.

459
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:53,463
That's why the PSO has decided to
make tunnels in your forests...

460
00:53:53,871 --> 00:53:57,636
so that our arms and ammunition
can be easily transported to India.

461
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:03,409
My jungle is your jungle.
Easy... that's no problem.

462
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,578
Where did he get hold of
such wild men?

463
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,321
Go away. Take it away.

464
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:42,644
Tulsi!

465
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:46,643
How long will you continue to break
your head at the temple?

466
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,649
Who'll wash the utensils
and the clothes?

467
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:53,950
Today was the final fast
for Monday. I've completed it.

468
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,828
Goodness! Whether you undergo a
penance for 16 Mondays...

469
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:00,966
or 16 Fridays, you will never
find a husband for yourself.

470
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:04,626
I get worried whenever
I see your problems.

471
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:07,404
How long can I continue to be
a burden on you?

472
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:10,465
Last night, Lord Shiva
appeared in my dreams.

473
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:12,474
That's enough. Now you'll start
chattering away.

474
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:16,637
Come on. Go home and work.
I'll go and buy some soap.

475
00:55:18,717 --> 00:55:20,650
Nice village. Isn't it, buddy?

476
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,384
Why do you start glowing
whenever you see a girl?

477
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,648
It was my mother's last wish
that I should have a family.

478
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:33,054
Dada Thakur will fulfill the
last wish of your mother. He will!

479
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:36,393
Let's go and lie down.
- There you go.

480
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:42,394
To turn from a criminal
to a policeman...

481
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:47,972
it's very important for them to
learn certain rules and disciplines.

482
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:52,708
Yes. To fight the Kauravas, one must
possess the strength of Pandavas.

483
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:56,050
Their training for the battle with
death should begin from tomorrow.

484
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,710
Hear that?
- I'm hearing.

485
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,914
The old man wants
martyrdom for us.

486
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:06,651
He's a naive fool.
- How's that?

487
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,964
He trusted us too easily.
- What do you mean?

488
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:14,659
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

489
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,533
What is that?
- About escaping from here.

490
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:26,702
Shall I ask you something?
- What?

491
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:29,709
How do two scoundrels
think alike?!

492
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,418
I was also plotting
an escape from here.

493
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,052
How will that be?
- Look over there.

494
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:41,022
When I was in the circus,
I used to play 'animals'.

495
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:42,721
C'mon! Let's get cracking.

496
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:45,728
They're missing since morning.
Looks like they've escaped.

497
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:56,906
Don't fire!

498
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,803
A bear! The bear!

499
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:04,838
Why don't you understand
that I'm human?

500
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:07,712
Please don't shoot.
I beg of you.

501
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:09,976
Look how I shoot now...

502
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,982
Where the hell is he?

503
00:57:15,726 --> 00:57:18,057
She's crazy...
I must find a place to hide!

504
00:57:21,531 --> 00:57:24,728
Look! A bear! Run!

505
00:57:39,014 --> 00:57:41,107
Well, cutie pie?

506
00:57:42,651 --> 00:57:46,610
I told you several times not
to fire, but you don't listen!

507
00:57:47,421 --> 00:57:49,548
Don't you have any sense?

508
00:57:49,857 --> 00:57:52,553
Shall I tell you what's there
inside this skin?

509
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:56,786
And where are you going away?
Look at me before you leave.

510
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:03,395
We were playing 'animals'.

511
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:06,005
Idiot! Scoundrel! Loafer!

512
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:10,398
Don't get abusive.
I'm a crazy fellow, you see!

513
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:13,473
Worthless man! Do you
know who I am?

514
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,976
You're a rude, useless
and an arrogant girl.

515
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,540
I'm the daughter of the
owner of this jungle.

516
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:21,616
Daughter of the owner
of his jungle?

517
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:24,620
You look like the daughter of
a wild animal of this jungle.

518
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,592
It's necessary that...

519
00:58:39,803 --> 00:58:42,432
a wild girl be
treated savagely.

520
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:46,799
The name is Baiju.
Understand?

521
00:58:48,044 --> 00:58:50,035
Hurry up! C'mon!

522
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,815
Come on! The moment you see a girl,
you start glowing all over.

523
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,783
We're running away in an officer's
uniform. Somebody could catch us!

524
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,790
Nobody can catch us.
- Let's carry on!

525
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:12,555
Careful!
The terrorists are here!

526
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:22,798
Run!
The terrorists have arrived!

527
00:59:55,907 --> 00:59:59,343
Your life and death
are in my hand.

528
01:00:01,546 --> 01:00:02,535
C'mon!

529
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,716
You've landed us in a soup!
You and your crazy ideas.

530
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:09,615
Hey! Stop!

531
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:34,933
The crow's are making a lot
of noise. Do I bump them off?

532
01:00:35,377 --> 01:00:38,938
Let them be. The scoundrels
have realised their folly.

533
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,540
Yes, they've returned.

534
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:46,944
Such scoundrels ought to be shot.
They're savages!

535
01:00:47,456 --> 01:00:48,753
They're not savages.

536
01:00:48,957 --> 01:00:53,950
They've come as the officers
of our jungles. From Delhi.

537
01:00:55,997 --> 01:00:57,555
From Delhi?

538
01:00:58,432 --> 01:01:00,923
Radha, go upstairs.

539
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:04,369
But Uncle...
- I said, go on!

540
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:12,935
I wonder what kind of training
they're receiving on the hills.

541
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:17,678
God is Great!

542
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:31,956
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

543
01:01:37,001 --> 01:01:38,832
Where will you go?

544
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:43,838
I made six rounds. The fourth round
was incorrect. The rest was fine.

545
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:48,135
That's your shortcoming.
Use your brains.

546
01:01:49,013 --> 01:01:53,745
Before speaking to the enemy,
estimate his strength and weakness.

547
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:58,020
Think, understand...
and then launch an attack.

548
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:03,322
Hear what he says?
- What?

549
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,791
Think, understand, estimate...

550
01:02:06,295 --> 01:02:09,787
By then, the enemy will gun us down!
The old man's going to get us killed!

551
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:26,311
Greetings.
- Greetings.

552
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:29,441
It's my bad luck, really.

553
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,744
You officers arrived in my area,
but I couldn't welcome you.

554
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,013
It's my bad luck.

555
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:39,754
My name is B.M.S. Kittam Kittu.

556
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:42,860
He owns this jungle.
The moment he learnt...

557
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:46,030
that you've newly arrived here,
he came rushing here.

558
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,034
He's very fond of
government officials.

559
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,535
He's a very religious person.
The entire village respects him.

560
01:02:58,343 --> 01:03:00,834
Please don't say that.
God is Great!

561
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:03,014
I'm a small man.

562
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:08,010
Please visit my house.
- Pardon me?

563
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,684
A small party at my home?

564
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:14,752
We've just arrived. We haven't
even started our work as yet.

565
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,756
These officers will first
get trained and then...

566
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,292
What training, sir?

567
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:27,698
You must be knowing about...

568
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:33,498
the wild animals in the jungles
around the border.

569
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,038
That's why I want you
to come to my guest house.

570
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,776
Very big house! Very safe house!

571
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,082
He has asked me to open
the guest house for you.

572
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:49,082
My humble house also
belongs to you, Sir.

573
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:55,825
Your house is my house.
My house is your house.

574
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:00,767
Please do visit my house!
We'll organise a party.

575
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,460
Good-bye.

576
01:04:10,678 --> 01:04:15,046
That chap in the lungi
appeared to be a bastard!

577
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,051
You'd better do something.
- Yes?

578
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:23,083
Keep an eye on his guest house.

579
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:27,090
Should he create mischief,
do I take him on?

580
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:29,924
Just do what I say.

581
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:42,100
This is just one gold necklace.

582
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:45,907
If you get Tulsi married to Somu...

583
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:49,107
I'll weigh you in gold.

584
01:04:50,114 --> 01:04:51,411
Really?

585
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,843
I'll have to show Tulsi
a dream to convince her.

586
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:01,052
What're you saying, Aunty?
- It's the truth.

587
01:05:02,593 --> 01:05:06,791
Last night, Lord Shiva had
Himself appeared in my dreams.

588
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,854
What did he say?

589
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:13,828
He said the first boy I come across
on the banks of the river Parul...

590
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,534
on the Sankranti day,
will be my husband.

591
01:05:17,273 --> 01:05:19,537
Really?
- Has Lord Shiva ever lied?

592
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:21,935
No. But...
- But what?

593
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:25,709
I'll see you off
as a bride!

594
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:40,589
I'm sure, smugglers are carrying
gold in the palanquin.

595
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:53,329
I nab the smugglers...
And Dada Thakur's gonna be happy!

596
01:05:54,007 --> 01:05:55,770
Out, smuggler!

597
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:15,520
What's this?

598
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:20,855
Lord Shiva's orders! You're
my husband and I'm your wife.

599
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:24,324
My wife?
- Yes.

600
01:06:25,336 --> 01:06:26,928
What drama is this?!

601
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:31,569
The first man I meet today on
the banks of river Parul...

602
01:06:31,842 --> 01:06:34,675
will be my husband.
That's our destiny.

603
01:06:35,346 --> 01:06:37,575
This girl will sure take me
to the wrong places!

604
01:06:38,782 --> 01:06:41,342
She's touching my feet too!
Run away... let me scram!

605
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:44,008
Listen!

606
01:06:56,532 --> 01:07:01,332
The garland! I can't let is lose!
It will emerge victorious, Tulsi!

607
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:05,332
No! This garland is not
meant for you. It's for him.

608
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:08,608
He's a fake. I'm the original.

609
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:11,676
Get in now. Your aunty
is waiting for you.

610
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:14,345
My aunty?
- Yes. Carry the palanquin.

611
01:07:23,357 --> 01:07:26,348
You're my bride. And you're
still acting tough with me.

612
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,652
I don't like your tantrums.

613
01:07:37,003 --> 01:07:39,664
Where are you going?
No! Please don't!

614
01:07:46,078 --> 01:07:48,409
What's going on?

615
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:52,410
If the girl is not willing,
why are you using force?

616
01:07:53,518 --> 01:07:57,716
She's my fiance.
But who the hell are you?

617
01:07:58,089 --> 01:08:01,353
You'd better get lost.
- Me? Who am I?

618
01:08:06,363 --> 01:08:08,854
The name is Johny.

619
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:13,668
You're hitting me?

620
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:15,871
He's hitting me!

621
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:18,931
Take this, you scoundrel.

622
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:21,741
He was hitting me!

623
01:08:21,844 --> 01:08:25,405
No! Don't mess with them.
They're not nice people.

624
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:31,913
Go and sit in the palanquin.

625
01:08:35,557 --> 01:08:37,548
Glory to Lord Hanuman.

626
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:09,751
Baldy! What're you doing?!
Set me down!

627
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:18,252
I'll die!
Where are you flinging me?

628
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:25,426
Well? What are you doing here?
- I was waiting for you!

629
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,274
Look! Isn't he turning
into a monkey?

630
01:09:37,482 --> 01:09:39,746
If you want to fight,
do it properly.

631
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:19,019
Take this! And this!

632
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:23,879
Don't spare the baldy!

633
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:26,082
Don't spare him.

634
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:33,556
Scoundrels! Get your guns out!
Finish them!

635
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:41,871
See? Plenty of guns around!

636
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:55,580
They were molesting
the girl, Khairu!

637
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:13,560
There are rats hidden in
each and every corner.

638
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:22,334
This is my hand. Do you know
why it was broken?

639
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:29,073
Because I've used this hand
a shoot a lot of rounds.

640
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:32,344
I've committed several murders.

641
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,885
They can have the bullets later.
But what do we do with the nuisance?

642
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,620
Send her home first.
- Sure. Go ahead.

643
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,388
Why send her alone?

644
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:44,465
These brothers will
escort their sister home.

645
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,403
C'mon. Take your sister home.

646
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,873
Move it, guys.
Carry the palanquin.

647
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:58,638
They will also beg her
for forgiveness!

648
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,303
Speak up, children!

649
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:03,572
Forgive us, sister!
- Speak up!

650
01:12:06,954 --> 01:12:09,387
Forgive us, sister!

651
01:12:26,772 --> 01:12:29,639
And what could we've done?
Allowed the girl to be raped?

652
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:34,911
The first good deed of my life!
And I get a scolding for it!

653
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,474
Oh no. Violence is a good thing.
Carry on!

654
01:12:38,883 --> 01:12:41,317
Be prepared. They'll return
with knives and choppers.

655
01:12:41,485 --> 01:12:45,649
We'll face them. Let them come.
We'll chop them into pieces.

656
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,983
You cannot make enemies if you want
to achieve what you propose to.

657
01:12:52,696 --> 01:12:54,664
There's a lot of hanky-panky
at the circuit house.

658
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:57,700
It'll make things easier for us.
- I swear.

659
01:12:58,702 --> 01:13:00,602
Fools, all of you!

660
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:06,632
To know the secrets of your enemy,
you must first befriend him.

661
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:10,637
There's only one way now
of setting this matter right.

662
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:16,946
One of you will go to
Kittam Kittoo and apologise.

663
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:21,952
All right. If you insist, I'II...

664
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,858
Not you. You won't go there.

665
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,250
You'll go to him, Birju.

666
01:13:27,395 --> 01:13:27,952
Me?

667
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,658
And ask for pardon. Politely.

668
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:35,535
Didn't I tell you that
the boss has gone out?

669
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:38,672
Why're you being rude?
Speak softly.

670
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:43,398
I've urgent work with him.
- My boss has no time for loafers.

671
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,701
How dare you call me a loafer?!

672
01:13:46,013 --> 01:13:48,947
One slap, and I could paste the
map of Nashik jail on your face!

673
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:51,715
This is the same man
who was playing a bear!

674
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:54,552
Forgive me, Sir.
- That's more like it.

675
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,383
That's what I'm here for.
Do you understand?

676
01:13:57,723 --> 01:13:59,554
I'll leaving now.

677
01:14:09,668 --> 01:14:10,793
Quiet.

678
01:14:37,726 --> 01:14:39,557
Just watch Radha's act.

679
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:40,990
Yes?

680
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:44,563
Whom do you want to see?

681
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,734
Aren't you the same?

682
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:51,467
I understand.

683
01:14:51,774 --> 01:14:55,039
I'm not the one, you think I am.

684
01:14:55,676 --> 01:14:56,644
Then?

685
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:01,010
I'm Radha, Reeta's twin sister.

686
01:15:03,718 --> 01:15:06,550
Yes. That's Reeta.

687
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:14,725
People are often mistaken.

688
01:15:15,562 --> 01:15:19,464
Damn it!
It's a double role!

689
01:15:21,735 --> 01:15:26,535
You had me confused! This is what
happens in our movies, you know!

690
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,741
You play the sitar very well.
You sing well, too.

691
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,746
My mother used to sing very well.

692
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,546
As for me, I play the banjo.

693
01:15:38,851 --> 01:15:40,784
That's nice indeed.

694
01:15:41,052 --> 01:15:43,043
Yes. It's nice indeed.

695
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:46,984
May I go now?
- Very well.

696
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,784
And yes!
- Yes?

697
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:55,561
When Kittam Kittoo,
your uncle, returns...

698
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,628
tell him that I'd come
to ask for pardon.

699
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:00,063
Sure!

700
01:16:00,337 --> 01:16:02,328
I'm leaving now.
- All right.

701
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:09,234
What say?

702
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,744
How dare you get
in there by force?

703
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:18,618
I came to ask for pardon.
- This isn't your father's house!

704
01:16:19,354 --> 01:16:21,755
Don't you drag
my father into this!

705
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:24,385
Who the hell is your father?

706
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:31,492
I'd only come to
ask for forgiveness.

707
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:44,642
Is this how you ask
for forgiveness?

708
01:16:44,912 --> 01:16:47,812
I'd gone there to ask for
forgiveness, but that bastard...

709
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,817
Now what if I ask you
for forgiveness?

710
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:03,985
I haven't come across prisoners
more disciplined and calm

711
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:07,459
They sing your patriotic song
day in and day out

712
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:09,596
Don't worry about me

713
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:12,463
My destination maybe far;
but it is not unachievable

714
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:16,535
I hear that our Minister is
coming to attend a party here

715
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:22,804
Ask him to act like a stranger
with me. Not to talk with me

716
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:26,806
Why must I talk to him?
I'll only watch.

717
01:17:29,653 --> 01:17:31,644
Tripathi is said
to be arriving.

718
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:35,654
Dr. Dang wants our coconut
to be gifted to him.

719
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,827
Very well, sir.
But when are you arriving?

720
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:42,024
I'll arrive the next day
after the party.

721
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:49,861
You're attending Kittam Kittoo's
party. Take the boys along, too.

722
01:17:50,372 --> 01:17:52,864
Such tramps have no place there.
- Exactly!

723
01:17:53,342 --> 01:17:55,867
They create trouble
everywhere they go.

724
01:17:56,711 --> 01:17:59,704
It's an insult to
take such chaps along.

725
01:18:00,448 --> 01:18:02,439
Keep them here, in your company.

726
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:08,313
There will be several
big guys at the party.

727
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:12,816
First teach them etiquette.
Then we'll take them along.

728
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,228
A man of etiquette indeed!

729
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,701
If only our mother were alive...
- Mother!

730
01:18:25,505 --> 01:18:27,870
Your mother is still here.
Come with me.

731
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:33,008
If he can make a gentleman out of
Khairu, I can do so out of you!

732
01:18:33,879 --> 01:18:35,710
This is Jolly Jagga's cupboard.

733
01:18:35,881 --> 01:18:38,315
Which area does the bandit operate in?
- He's not a bandit.

734
01:18:38,617 --> 01:18:40,608
He's Dharma's brother.

735
01:18:40,886 --> 01:18:43,877
Whenever he goes abroad,
he leaves his clothes here.

736
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:49,350
Dresses? What do we do with them?
Exchange them for utensils?

737
01:18:50,896 --> 01:18:52,522
I'll tell you.

738
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:55,699
I have influential guests
from Delhi and abroad.

739
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:57,935
Thank you, Mr. Tripathi.

740
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:08,577
Our area is very peaceful.
You can ask Dada Thakur.

741
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:12,875
This is an official visit. I must
make sure everything's all right.

742
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:17,614
It's the custom here to give the
guests a traditional welcome.

743
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,618
Radha. Give the guests
the prasadam.

744
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,557
This is my daughter, Radha.

745
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:29,557
This is a sacred coconut from
the sage of the Himalayas.

746
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,561
Take it home, and keep it
in your room of worship.

747
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,897
It'll bless you with
peace and prosperity.

748
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,605
His underlings aren't here yet.

749
01:19:50,317 --> 01:19:54,309
Me's Johny, from Jhansi.
That's Baiju. From Mumbai.

750
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:57,614
He's trying to be funny.
- No funny! He's Johny!

751
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:11,960
What is she saying?
- She says you're handsome.

752
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:19,004
Dada Thakur has asked the two of
you to get the hell out of here.

753
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:22,776
Tell Dada Thakur that we'll
stick to this quiet corner.

754
01:20:23,015 --> 01:20:25,006
We won't create any scene.

755
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,782
No liquor. No violence.
And no abuses.

756
01:21:13,027 --> 01:21:15,461
This is whiskey, ma'am!
- Just do as I say.

757
01:21:15,763 --> 01:21:17,753
Some people prefer it neat.

758
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:23,764
Excuse me,

759
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:27,705
You're my guests.
To welcome you...

760
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:32,038
No liquor, thank you!
- Not liquor.

761
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:33,943
This is orange juice.

762
01:21:35,582 --> 01:21:37,549
We drink plenty of juice.

763
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:41,513
This is our own orange juice!

764
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:46,781
Let's have another
of that juice!

765
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:51,526
I don't see your
twin-sister around.

766
01:21:51,864 --> 01:21:54,661
She hasn't come.
She's gone hunting.

767
01:21:55,267 --> 01:21:56,825
She belongs there!

768
01:21:59,704 --> 01:22:02,195
What a difference between
the two girls!

769
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:35,830
Aim your camera at the man there,
and take your pictures.

770
01:23:08,268 --> 01:23:10,896
Didn't I tell you to keep
quiet and just watch?

771
01:23:11,271 --> 01:23:13,761
Where have I said anything?
I'm just watching.

772
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:32,522
The rains pouring outside...

773
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:37,627
What makes the ocean;
and what makes this wine?

774
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:43,323
What life is this?

775
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:46,928
This is no life!

776
01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:51,599
Let me put the bottle
to my mouth and take a swig

777
01:24:03,653 --> 01:24:07,282
It's after ages that
I've got to see the stuff...

778
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,955
Give it to me...
give me the booze

779
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,486
It's after ages that I have
got my hands on the stuff

780
01:24:13,795 --> 01:24:17,595
Blow us out of our senses,
give us the booze

781
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:22,599
Give it to me,
give me the booze

782
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:29,336
Long live, Baiju!

783
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:40,919
When I've had a few drinks

784
01:24:41,355 --> 01:24:43,915
it'll make things
go haywire

785
01:24:44,357 --> 01:24:48,919
Let us drink...
let us cry and laugh

786
01:24:58,404 --> 01:25:02,669
It will do away
with all formalities

787
01:25:03,342 --> 01:25:07,675
It will weigh everyone
for what they are worth

788
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,945
We're called bad guys...

789
01:25:16,354 --> 01:25:18,845
But we're true at heart

790
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,351
Kill us, if we're lying

791
01:25:29,366 --> 01:25:32,665
It's after ages that
we're getting to drink

792
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:37,996
Give it to me,
give me the booze

793
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:41,835
Long live, Johny

794
01:25:56,458 --> 01:26:00,723
We've just come to our senses

795
01:26:01,362 --> 01:26:05,764
We're getting into
the spirit

796
01:26:06,434 --> 01:26:11,166
To set water on fire

797
01:26:11,538 --> 01:26:16,407
We have got to
know something

798
01:26:27,653 --> 01:26:29,917
The kick has begun to tell

799
01:26:30,222 --> 01:26:32,622
The lady will take the
veil off her face

800
01:26:32,957 --> 01:26:35,256
We haven't yet landed
a blow or two...

801
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:38,726
It's days since we've
been into a brawl

802
01:26:41,667 --> 01:26:45,193
We're gonna beat up someone
today... after we're drunk

803
01:26:45,603 --> 01:26:47,935
Give it to us,
give us the booze

804
01:26:48,273 --> 01:26:51,730
It's days since we've
drunk the stuff

805
01:27:04,421 --> 01:27:05,409
Sir!

806
01:27:08,425 --> 01:27:10,824
The birds have
flown the coop

807
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:13,961
As if every promise
has been broken

808
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,624
There... the gentleman
is cross with us!

809
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:06,440
There are men here...

810
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,737
They're fair of skin...

811
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:14,779
But black at heart

812
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:22,282
They strike up
shady deals with strangers

813
01:28:22,493 --> 01:28:25,155
And betray people
their own

814
01:28:30,967 --> 01:28:37,964
All those enemies and traitors...
we shall teach a lesson

815
01:28:38,508 --> 01:28:40,942
They will never forget us

816
01:28:44,548 --> 01:28:50,816
Go on, give it to us...
give us the booze

817
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,819
It's days since we've
gulped down some stuff

818
01:29:16,843 --> 01:29:19,244
Long live Kittam Kittu

819
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,741
Give us the booze,
Kittam Kittu

820
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:09,889
He told us not to drink!
And now we're sweating it out!

821
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:18,934
Spare me... please!

822
01:30:33,949 --> 01:30:36,645
Left, right... my foot!
He won't do it himself!

823
01:30:36,852 --> 01:30:38,786
Attention!

824
01:30:49,664 --> 01:30:52,656
Look who's here, Dada Thakur!
My brother!

825
01:30:53,034 --> 01:30:55,968
Didn't I tell you he's achieved
a lot in Europe?

826
01:30:58,471 --> 01:30:59,495
Good morning, sir.

827
01:30:59,706 --> 01:31:03,642
Brother tells me that you were
our father's friend in Lahore.

828
01:31:04,277 --> 01:31:06,642
More than friends,
we were brothers, my son.

829
01:31:07,647 --> 01:31:09,478
Is this is the brother
for whom...

830
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:11,912
Yes. I went to prison for him.

831
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,482
Touch his feet.

832
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:18,656
You ought to touch the feet
of your God-like brother.

833
01:31:18,956 --> 01:31:20,924
He has granted you a new life.

834
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:29,662
Who are they?
- Our officers.

835
01:31:30,668 --> 01:31:32,966
They are here to inspect
the jungle.

836
01:31:37,642 --> 01:31:41,202
You come and go in a jiffy.

837
01:31:41,645 --> 01:31:44,408
It would be better if you
stayed for a few more days.

838
01:31:46,282 --> 01:31:48,476
Before I leave, I'll
tell you something.

839
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:51,480
It's not advisable to let
strangers stay at home.

840
01:31:51,652 --> 01:31:53,642
They're not strangers.
They're our own people.

841
01:31:54,387 --> 01:31:57,150
You're a naive man.
- So be it.

842
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:01,125
Time will tell who are our people,
and who are strangers.

843
01:32:01,626 --> 01:32:03,593
My obeisances.
- May you live long.

844
01:32:04,194 --> 01:32:06,593
Return soon.
And eat on time!

845
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,620
How often have I asked you
not to come at this post?

846
01:32:09,765 --> 01:32:12,630
The baby's crying, she wanted to
come here. So I brought her along.

847
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:16,464
Go home, my child.
I'll return soon.

848
01:32:18,771 --> 01:32:21,466
This post... how come?

849
01:32:22,073 --> 01:32:24,064
It has been set up
a few days ago.

850
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:36,113
I must say, Rana. I haven't seen
more patriotic men.

851
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,814
Now listen, politician!
Don't instigate my wife against me!

852
01:32:41,253 --> 01:32:45,187
God save you now.
- I want to talk to her.

853
01:32:45,723 --> 01:32:48,384
I was praising you, too.

854
01:32:48,726 --> 01:32:51,454
Here you are.
He's eager to talk to you.

855
01:32:56,129 --> 01:32:57,687
Hello! Rukmini!

856
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:02,632
This chap is a pessimist!
Don't let him con you!

857
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:06,101
Everything's all right
out there, isn't it?

858
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,107
Say something...

859
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:24,114
I get it! All right, I do!

860
01:33:24,715 --> 01:33:29,674
I can hear your bangles.
Did you think I won't?

861
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:40,691
Of course... you want to know
how I am. Right?

862
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:44,527
I'm fine. Absolutely right!

863
01:33:46,564 --> 01:33:48,690
What was that? Come again.

864
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,498
I'm always missing you, darling.

865
01:33:57,271 --> 01:33:59,569
Don't ask me that again!

866
01:34:08,211 --> 01:34:11,668
I have always said,
I love you

867
01:34:19,019 --> 01:34:21,680
A father of three...
and I love you

868
01:34:36,732 --> 01:34:41,497
Now listen, Rukmini. How can I
continue, if you act like this?

869
01:34:42,234 --> 01:34:44,202
I'll be a shattered man.

870
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:50,399
Don't forget... it was you
who saw me off on the mission.

871
01:34:52,743 --> 01:34:55,733
I'll return soon.
And I'll return victorious.

872
01:34:56,178 --> 01:34:57,736
Rana Vishwapratap!

873
01:34:59,747 --> 01:35:04,682
If we get to know where he's
disappeared after resigning...

874
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:07,117
it would be great fun.

875
01:35:07,686 --> 01:35:12,678
But Tripathi was saved this time.
- Never mind. We'll get him again.

876
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:16,351
Why're the prisoners standing here?
- They're our new prisoners.

877
01:35:16,726 --> 01:35:19,353
They're refusing to work
on the new tunnel.

878
01:35:23,029 --> 01:35:27,021
What is this I hear?
You're Indian boys, after all.

879
01:35:27,433 --> 01:35:30,230
What would you lose if
you dig a tunnel?

880
01:35:30,969 --> 01:35:33,436
And remember, we've special
principles for prisoners.

881
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:36,732
If you work, you'll be
given bread to eat.

882
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:40,173
If you don't, you'll be
given bullets.

883
01:35:52,516 --> 01:35:56,315
Several of our officers have been
caught or killed by them.

884
01:35:56,786 --> 01:36:01,085
If we visit the jungles of Lahariya,
we must go there together.

885
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:03,452
Now where has Baiju gone?

886
01:36:03,724 --> 01:36:07,215
He's went with his instrument
this morning.

887
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:12,425
Hear that? Banjo!
Pamper him some more!

888
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:17,026
Your admirer is playing
the banjo outside.

889
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:43,473
Hey, girls! Who do you
think you are?

890
01:36:43,951 --> 01:36:45,475
Do I look like a beggar?

891
01:36:45,952 --> 01:36:48,442
Do kings and emperors play
musical instruments on the streets?

892
01:36:48,955 --> 01:36:51,149
What kind of girls you are?
You don't even know that...

893
01:36:51,258 --> 01:36:53,248
one can express his devotion by
playing musical instruments.

894
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:59,290
No. It's not nice to make
fun of devotees.

895
01:36:59,962 --> 01:37:02,896
There! Look at you!
And this girl... bless her!

896
01:37:03,098 --> 01:37:05,258
But how can we believe
that he is a devotee?

897
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,561
Which God do you worship?
- I believe in... well!

898
01:37:09,002 --> 01:37:11,526
Radha...
Which God do you worship?

899
01:37:11,904 --> 01:37:16,204
She worships Lord Ram.
- I'm a devotee of Lord Ram, too!

900
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:19,204
The principled Lord Rama!

901
01:37:19,943 --> 01:37:22,467
But Radha's deity
was Lord Krishna.

902
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:24,201
Lord Krishna?

903
01:37:27,948 --> 01:37:31,940
Actually, Lord Ram was
very simple and innocent...

904
01:37:32,286 --> 01:37:35,447
while Lord Krishna was very
clever and practical.

905
01:37:35,953 --> 01:37:41,186
If I search within myself, I'm
more inclined towards Lord Krishna.

906
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,949
What say, Miss Radha?

907
01:37:43,226 --> 01:37:45,954
They're all lying.

908
01:37:46,962 --> 01:37:50,623
Actually, I worship
Goddess Santoshi.

909
01:37:50,997 --> 01:37:54,954
Santoshi Maa!
It ran 50 weeks in Bombay.

910
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:57,424
I've seen it 21 times myself.

911
01:37:57,703 --> 01:38:00,897
I don't even know how many Fridays
I've fasted to appease the Goddess.

912
01:38:01,138 --> 01:38:04,936
To be honest, I'm a devotee
of Goddess Santoshi Maa.

913
01:38:06,474 --> 01:38:09,270
What's there to laugh about?
Glory to Goddess Santoshi Maa!

914
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:17,611
Look what's happening there!

915
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:21,506
We're on duty! And he's
busy romancing... the Romeo!

916
01:38:21,952 --> 01:38:24,044
Trying to impress the girl
with his banjo!

917
01:38:24,954 --> 01:38:25,613
C'mon!

918
01:38:28,957 --> 01:38:33,255
My Lord has arrived, you see.
Glory to Mother Santoshi!

919
01:38:37,262 --> 01:38:39,253
Johny's lying!
I was only...

920
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,430
Get in.

921
01:38:45,535 --> 01:38:47,526
Shut up, you fox!

922
01:38:51,073 --> 01:38:56,008
If he carries on like this,
the truth about us will be exposed.

923
01:38:56,242 --> 01:38:58,403
People will get to know
our true identities.

924
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:06,507
Stop the truck!
Look! The post is up in flames.

925
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:19,958
How did this happen?
- The same thing again, Sir.

926
01:39:20,392 --> 01:39:25,487
Terrorists from across the border
blew up the post with dynamite.

927
01:39:26,029 --> 01:39:29,293
There was peace for a while,
but their atrocities have resumed.

928
01:39:29,999 --> 01:39:31,989
They're spreading terror...

929
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:45,308
They've burnt down the post today.
It could be our house tomorrow.

930
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:48,341
You took time
to understand.

931
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:51,168
They're called terrorists.

932
01:39:52,314 --> 01:39:55,510
Which means we'll have
more careful now.

933
01:39:56,050 --> 01:40:01,452
It's important that the boys
take turns to stand guard...

934
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:06,012
and see what kind of people
and goods enter the village.

935
01:40:06,657 --> 01:40:10,387
You're right. They are likely
to notice us anytime now.

936
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:14,290
Yes. More so because we're
government officials. What say?

937
01:40:14,496 --> 01:40:16,487
Certainly. You do appear
to be a government official.

938
01:40:18,065 --> 01:40:20,658
Yes, I do.
That's because I do my duty!

939
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:22,897
I don't play banjo like you do!

940
01:40:23,068 --> 01:40:26,366
All right... I'll make a
nice banjo out of you soon.

941
01:40:26,704 --> 01:40:29,069
Really? Go ahead then!
Go on!

942
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:39,311
Hello there! Whom were you
looking for?

943
01:40:40,112 --> 01:40:41,943
I was looking for my aunt.

944
01:40:42,248 --> 01:40:44,112
Is it the aunt...
or is it uncle?

945
01:40:44,282 --> 01:40:46,545
I know. I know everything.

946
01:40:46,951 --> 01:40:48,942
You're looking for Gyaneshwar
Prasad, aren't you?

947
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:51,451
He's gone to the jungles
to kill a partridge.

948
01:40:52,121 --> 01:40:55,715
By the way, he praises you a lot.
- Does he?

949
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:01,058
Yes, but the poor chap cannot
make you his wife.

950
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:05,887
Why not?
- He was right when he said that...

951
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:09,058
a bachelor needs a house
if he has to become a husband.

952
01:41:09,266 --> 01:41:11,665
And to buy a house, one needs
money. And he has no money.

953
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:12,899
What then?

954
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:16,902
If he had money, there'd be a home.
And love. And a beloved.

955
01:41:17,138 --> 01:41:19,128
But what will the poor guy do?

956
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:21,067
So?
- What else?

957
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:27,106
You know better. He needs money.
Without it, he can't marry.

958
01:41:30,513 --> 01:41:33,448
You're in so much of trouble,
my love.

959
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:36,884
Why didn't you tell me about it?

960
01:41:37,252 --> 01:41:39,446
What a fool I am!

961
01:41:49,126 --> 01:41:52,458
Love is meant for
good-for-nothings.

962
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:58,122
I haven't seen a more lazy
animal than someone in love.

963
01:42:02,936 --> 01:42:04,904
How would you know?

964
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:12,369
When love reigns, even the
heavens tremble.

965
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,870
May I ask you something?

966
01:42:19,547 --> 01:42:22,106
You loved Heena a lot,
didn't you?

967
01:42:26,551 --> 01:42:32,113
A lot? And still do? Tell me.
C'mon.

968
01:42:35,126 --> 01:42:37,957
You must be missing her a lot.

969
01:42:40,394 --> 01:42:42,362
I haven't forgotten.

970
01:42:44,564 --> 01:42:46,758
What do I tell you?

971
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:52,062
Love and romance have
no place in my destiny!

972
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,562
How would you? You don't
know how to love.

973
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,339
Don't I love you guys?

974
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:08,338
Love? This is not love.
It's your helplessness.

975
01:43:09,514 --> 01:43:14,007
Helplessness? Am I begging
you for something?

976
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:17,519
You son of a scoundrel!
Do I not love you?

977
01:43:17,887 --> 01:43:20,319
Shall I tear open my heart
and show it to you?

978
01:43:20,556 --> 01:43:22,523
Hey! Look who's come!

979
01:43:25,225 --> 01:43:28,683
My God!
Why doesn't she leave me alone!

980
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:36,828
Know what, guy? Go over...
She's brought the green stuff too!

981
01:43:39,569 --> 01:43:44,562
She seems to be a good girl.
Don't betray her.

982
01:43:46,574 --> 01:43:49,565
Today, whatever I say,
will be the truth.

983
01:43:52,911 --> 01:43:54,901
What is it?

984
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:57,370
Actually...
- You see...

985
01:43:57,614 --> 01:44:00,515
You're bringing me
a lot of bad name!

986
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:03,383
It's you who's bringing
me to disrepute.

987
01:44:03,685 --> 01:44:05,550
When Lord Ram was in distress...

988
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:08,554
didn't He share his
grief with His consort?

989
01:44:08,755 --> 01:44:10,346
What do you mean?

990
01:44:10,556 --> 01:44:14,889
You need money for a home, don't
you? I've brought this for you.

991
01:44:20,396 --> 01:44:22,386
Where did you get it from?

992
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:25,895
My late mother had kept this
for my marriage.

993
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:30,559
And when your Aunty gets to know
about it, she'll skin you alive.

994
01:44:31,571 --> 01:44:33,697
I'll bear it, but your grief...

995
01:44:33,939 --> 01:44:37,566
Grief?
You're adding to my grief!

996
01:44:39,376 --> 01:44:42,606
Remember! I'm not
what I appear to be.

997
01:44:42,945 --> 01:44:47,346
I'm dangerous. And a fraud, too.
And I cannot be of any use to you.

998
01:44:56,855 --> 01:44:58,343
Shut up and get lost!

999
01:44:59,689 --> 01:45:04,284
I'll leave, if you want me to.
But keep this...

1000
01:45:11,564 --> 01:45:16,556
What does she think I am?
A cheat? A fraud?

1001
01:45:17,602 --> 01:45:19,569
Am I eyeing her money?

1002
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:22,861
Here... this is how I can
make money!

1003
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:31,440
When Lord Ram was in distress...

1004
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:34,602
didn't He share his grief
with His consort?

1005
01:45:39,516 --> 01:45:41,279
Aren't you getting sleep?

1006
01:45:43,353 --> 01:45:45,343
Drink this and go to sleep.

1007
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:48,249
We've to leave for
the forests tomorrow.

1008
01:45:53,693 --> 01:45:59,994
Lord! What mistake have I made?
He still refuses to accept me!

1009
01:46:00,598 --> 01:46:02,565
That's because you're a fool!

1010
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,430
I...

1011
01:46:06,602 --> 01:46:09,935
Is your aunt at home?
- She's not in.

1012
01:46:11,339 --> 01:46:13,898
Last evening, I was...
- Yes. I was drunk.

1013
01:46:16,175 --> 01:46:18,438
What I meant to say is that...

1014
01:46:19,879 --> 01:46:24,871
I am... with you...
How should I say it?

1015
01:46:27,617 --> 01:46:30,608
Gawd! Why can't I speak
those romantic lines?!

1016
01:46:31,285 --> 01:46:36,779
You see... this is the letter.
Read it. I'm leaving.

1017
01:46:38,657 --> 01:46:39,623
Listen...

1018
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:45,355
I belong to you.
And you belong to me

1019
01:46:45,696 --> 01:46:50,154
But my life is ridden with danger.
I'm not sure if I'll return

1020
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:53,259
If I return, I'll be yours.
Or else, it's a good-bye

1021
01:46:59,672 --> 01:47:03,868
Don't go away...

1022
01:47:15,617 --> 01:47:21,917
Oh my darling, don't cry...
I'm going to die

1023
01:47:25,155 --> 01:47:27,123
Bye-bye

1024
01:47:54,744 --> 01:47:59,702
Don't go away...

1025
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:05,639
Do not hurt my feelings

1026
01:48:06,651 --> 01:48:12,315
My love... do not go away

1027
01:48:12,655 --> 01:48:17,489
No, no! Don't sing
a sad song

1028
01:48:18,092 --> 01:48:20,389
Don't say such sad things

1029
01:48:20,727 --> 01:48:25,389
I'll never leave you.
Impossible

1030
01:49:15,065 --> 01:49:20,160
My heart is a temple
of your love...

1031
01:49:20,767 --> 01:49:25,203
my heart is a temple
of your love...

1032
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:34,209
come, live in my heart

1033
01:49:34,478 --> 01:49:40,209
O mischievous soul...

1034
01:49:41,315 --> 01:49:45,216
why must you wander
aimlessly?

1035
01:49:48,387 --> 01:49:54,221
My love, do not go away

1036
01:50:16,773 --> 01:50:21,766
If the lovers are separated...

1037
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:32,773
if this bond of
love is severed...

1038
01:50:38,821 --> 01:50:44,257
I'd go crazy in your love...

1039
01:50:45,326 --> 01:50:49,318
And you'd get word of it

1040
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:58,822
My love... don't go away

1041
01:51:14,545 --> 01:51:18,276
Don't hurt my feelings

1042
01:51:19,817 --> 01:51:26,777
My love... I've come to you

1043
01:51:28,322 --> 01:51:33,314
Do not go away

1044
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:42,821
Wake up, Johny.
We're home.

1045
01:51:56,674 --> 01:51:58,504
Go home, dear.

1046
01:51:59,577 --> 01:52:02,806
As for you...
come in.

1047
01:52:05,848 --> 01:52:09,304
I swear! I was only spying.
Didn't you ask me to

1048
01:52:09,516 --> 01:52:11,142
One has to do many things
for that!

1049
01:52:11,251 --> 01:52:14,811
One has to sing, woo a girl,
even enter the girl's home.

1050
01:52:15,253 --> 01:52:18,814
A no-win situation for me!
I get the boot, no matter what!

1051
01:52:19,323 --> 01:52:21,813
She's a nice girl.
- What?

1052
01:52:22,293 --> 01:52:24,817
She's a nice girl.
- A nice girl?

1053
01:52:25,328 --> 01:52:29,820
A very nice girl. You can't find
a better girl in the whole of U.P.

1054
01:52:31,498 --> 01:52:34,831
I'm thinking of discussing
your marriage with her.

1055
01:52:37,368 --> 01:52:41,497
Godfather! Better do that!
That'll end the whole controversy.

1056
01:52:42,705 --> 01:52:45,867
But what will you say?
- I'll say...

1057
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:50,537
that I'm sending you back
where I brought you from.

1058
01:52:51,378 --> 01:52:53,868
And where did you bring me from?
- I brought you from here.

1059
01:52:54,880 --> 01:53:02,478
Have you forgotten?!
- You had promised me a new life!

1060
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,650
But you're sending me back
to the gallows!

1061
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:06,651
I was only talking about
love and romance.

1062
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:08,813
Now listen carefully.

1063
01:53:09,457 --> 01:53:12,823
You will stop spying and
romancing with immediate effect.

1064
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:19,293
Neither does it serve any purpose,
nor can I bear it any cost.

1065
01:53:19,497 --> 01:53:20,464
But...

1066
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:25,100
you'll give me a report
on all the activities...

1067
01:53:25,301 --> 01:53:28,291
and also where the roads in
jungle lead to. In 3 days.

1068
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:39,033
This jungle is the private property
of Kittam Kittoo.

1069
01:53:40,045 --> 01:53:43,036
Entry is strictly prohibited.

1070
01:53:46,049 --> 01:53:52,474
Believe it or not! But the key
to our problems is Kittam Kittoo.

1071
01:53:53,053 --> 01:53:56,045
Don't utter that name,
damn you!

1072
01:53:56,389 --> 01:53:58,380
Every time you do that
it reminds me of Radha.

1073
01:53:58,625 --> 01:54:01,024
This job can be done.
- How?

1074
01:54:03,027 --> 01:54:06,553
I'm talking of
the same Radha.

1075
01:54:08,031 --> 01:54:09,691
Once you become Radha's husband,

1076
01:54:10,066 --> 01:54:14,023
Kittam Kittoo will be our in-law.
What say?

1077
01:54:15,036 --> 01:54:17,697
You guys won't change?
- No.

1078
01:54:19,038 --> 01:54:20,596
Scoundrels, really!

1079
01:54:21,306 --> 01:54:24,639
Kittam Kittoo is very busy today.
I told you...

1080
01:54:25,043 --> 01:54:28,637
you cannot meet him.
- Can we meet his niece, Radha?

1081
01:54:29,345 --> 01:54:30,709
Why not?
- Because...

1082
01:54:31,047 --> 01:54:34,038
she's just returned from a hunt
and is bathing in the pool.

1083
01:54:38,084 --> 01:54:39,483
Returned from hunting?

1084
01:54:40,086 --> 01:54:41,746
Radha has returned from the hunt!

1085
01:54:42,687 --> 01:54:48,090
You see, we're letting you into
a secret, and you aren't listening.

1086
01:54:57,431 --> 01:54:59,421
Go and fetch my clothes.

1087
01:55:10,307 --> 01:55:12,298
Yes? Oh! Hello!

1088
01:55:13,242 --> 01:55:16,039
Did you go hunting?
- Not at all.

1089
01:55:17,478 --> 01:55:21,470
What're you doing here?
- I was praying.

1090
01:55:23,215 --> 01:55:26,341
Where's Reeta?
- She must be in there.

1091
01:55:27,085 --> 01:55:30,416
I'll convey your idea
to Kittam Kittoo.

1092
01:55:31,488 --> 01:55:35,082
I cannot come out into the
open and speak to you.

1093
01:55:35,357 --> 01:55:39,417
Who's the girl in the nude?
- That's Radha.

1094
01:55:41,362 --> 01:55:43,522
And where's Reeta?
- Reeta who?

1095
01:55:44,096 --> 01:55:47,395
Radha's twin sister!
- Radha has no sister.

1096
01:55:48,099 --> 01:55:52,398
Kittam Kittoo has only one niece.
- I see.

1097
01:55:53,235 --> 01:55:56,635
All right then. At the temple.
- Yes. We'll surely meet.

1098
01:55:57,138 --> 01:55:59,401
I'll meet you there.
- Sure!

1099
01:56:04,444 --> 01:56:08,311
He loves Radha as much as
he hates Reeta.

1100
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:12,281
What are you saying?
- I swear it.

1101
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:13,748
Don't swear. Just speak the truth.

1102
01:56:14,083 --> 01:56:17,348
I'm speaking the truth.
Radha and Reeta are the same girl!

1103
01:56:17,685 --> 01:56:21,085
She's pulling your leg by
playing a double role.

1104
01:56:22,689 --> 01:56:23,655
I see...

1105
01:56:25,324 --> 01:56:29,692
Now just see how I start
pulling that girl's leg.

1106
01:56:47,139 --> 01:56:48,970
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1107
01:56:49,508 --> 01:56:51,476
You responded to my greetings
with a greeting?

1108
01:56:52,143 --> 01:56:54,133
Why? Do you want
something from me?

1109
01:56:54,211 --> 01:56:59,476
No. In fact, I'm in a fix today.
And I need your help desperately.

1110
01:57:00,081 --> 01:57:02,208
You need my help?
- That's right.

1111
01:57:02,716 --> 01:57:06,311
Tell me. What is it?
- The thing is, last night...

1112
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:10,649
I married your sister Radha
in the temple.

1113
01:57:12,324 --> 01:57:14,417
Married her?
- I swear it.

1114
01:57:17,027 --> 01:57:20,961
She told me that she would
return with her clothes.

1115
01:57:21,263 --> 01:57:22,924
But she hasn't returned yet.

1116
01:57:26,133 --> 01:57:28,123
Did you hear what he said?

1117
01:57:28,334 --> 01:57:31,564
He says that last night he married
my sister, Radha, in the temple.

1118
01:57:35,206 --> 01:57:37,139
You're laughing?!

1119
01:57:37,974 --> 01:57:40,464
I'm turning a widower...
and you're laughing?

1120
01:57:41,043 --> 01:57:42,532
Stop this merriment!

1121
01:57:42,644 --> 01:57:46,635
Don't you act smart, mister!
And listen carefully.

1122
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:50,637
I'm Reeta and I'm Radha, too.
Now stage your act elsewhere.

1123
01:57:52,151 --> 01:57:55,641
You? Radha? You're not
half as good as Radha.

1124
01:57:56,254 --> 01:57:58,653
Radha is a Goddess,
while you're a witch.

1125
01:57:59,188 --> 01:58:02,589
Radha is brilliance,
you are darkness.

1126
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:07,093
Better watch your tongue.
- It cannot be controlled now.

1127
01:58:10,196 --> 01:58:12,959
Attention, everybody!
Listen to my sad story!

1128
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:15,631
Ask the priest who got me married.

1129
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,532
Ask the horse which I rode on.

1130
01:58:19,303 --> 01:58:23,964
Ask my friend who is witness
that Radha is my wife.

1131
01:58:24,439 --> 01:58:27,930
I want nothing but my wife!

1132
01:58:30,143 --> 01:58:33,634
You need not insult me by screaming
like this in the marketplace.

1133
01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:36,646
If it is revenge you want,
take me to some other place.

1134
01:58:37,047 --> 01:58:40,447
It's you who's insulting me
and my love for Radha.

1135
01:58:41,184 --> 01:58:45,312
We got married, we had
our nuptials together.

1136
01:58:46,188 --> 01:58:47,449
He's on the right track.

1137
01:58:47,556 --> 01:58:53,185
We even decided to name our
son Prem Kumar Thakur.

1138
01:58:54,526 --> 01:58:57,358
You're crossing the limits.

1139
01:58:57,962 --> 01:59:00,896
Didn't I tell you that I'm the same
girl whom you believe is Radha?

1140
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:03,858
You? Then was I dreaming?

1141
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:07,134
You've gone mad.
You've gone insane.

1142
01:59:08,135 --> 01:59:09,864
Really?
- Yes.

1143
01:59:10,137 --> 01:59:11,933
There's the Shiva temple.

1144
01:59:12,138 --> 01:59:14,971
Come with me, and speak on
oath that you're Radha.

1145
01:59:15,507 --> 01:59:16,496
Let's go.

1146
01:59:18,176 --> 01:59:22,611
I swear upon Lord Shiva that Radha
and Reeta are the same girl...

1147
01:59:23,046 --> 01:59:24,877
and I'm that girl.

1148
01:59:25,447 --> 01:59:32,180
Then speak on oath that the girl
who is Radha, used to hate me.

1149
01:59:33,187 --> 01:59:35,881
What do you mean?
- It means that...

1150
01:59:36,254 --> 01:59:38,449
you don't love me.

1151
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:43,184
Lord Shiva! Why isn't she
taking the oath?

1152
01:59:44,994 --> 01:59:47,188
It means that she...

1153
01:59:47,462 --> 01:59:50,022
It only means that...

1154
01:59:57,269 --> 01:59:59,236
Since you left, sir...

1155
01:59:59,504 --> 02:00:02,496
Dada Thakur's men have created
havoc in the village.

1156
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,504
They harass us girls a lot.

1157
02:00:09,645 --> 02:00:12,942
They won't harass you henceforth.
But you'll have to do something.

1158
02:00:13,247 --> 02:00:14,235
What is that, Sir?

1159
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,905
Plant yourself like a pest
in Dharma Mansion.

1160
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:20,240
Use this tape-recorder
as one of your ears.

1161
02:00:21,319 --> 02:00:25,516
Also inform me every day,
what is cooking there.

1162
02:00:26,256 --> 02:00:28,087
As you wish, Sir.

1163
02:00:29,925 --> 02:00:33,382
This is not good.
Dada Thakur will be very angry.

1164
02:00:34,995 --> 02:00:37,486
I swear, Khairu.
Radha is a very nice girl.

1165
02:00:37,998 --> 02:00:39,988
Then don't cheat her.

1166
02:00:41,299 --> 02:00:44,564
First tell her who you are,
and why you have come here.

1167
02:00:45,668 --> 02:00:48,001
Then see how much she loves you.

1168
02:00:48,337 --> 02:00:52,295
My father was killed by terrorists
in this very jungle.

1169
02:00:52,673 --> 02:00:54,641
Why?
- Because he was a patriot...

1170
02:00:54,742 --> 02:00:56,732
and an honest human being.

1171
02:00:58,578 --> 02:01:00,977
I too want to tell you
the truth about myself.

1172
02:01:01,313 --> 02:01:03,576
The purpose of my visit here...

1173
02:01:08,084 --> 02:01:11,246
I don't even know if
I'll remain alive for you.

1174
02:01:12,988 --> 02:01:16,547
No! Don't utter another word.

1175
02:01:18,124 --> 02:01:19,682
Radha! Come here!

1176
02:01:26,997 --> 02:01:31,558
He's a loafer! And you're
a rich man's daughter!

1177
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:33,295
Before that...
- Shut up!

1178
02:01:34,068 --> 02:01:36,627
If you meet him again,
I'll shoot both of you!

1179
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:47,603
You must forget that girl!

1180
02:01:49,045 --> 02:01:52,139
I've got to know about it.
- There's no doubt about that, sir.

1181
02:01:52,547 --> 02:01:56,038
This is cheating.
A betrayal!

1182
02:01:57,151 --> 02:01:59,983
Betrayal? It's my destiny
that has betrayed me, sir.

1183
02:02:00,286 --> 02:02:03,254
You have written this
destiny for yourself!

1184
02:02:03,622 --> 02:02:05,589
Remember. We have a mission.

1185
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:09,289
If we face any kind of storm
before we accomplish that...

1186
02:02:09,626 --> 02:02:11,616
you alone will be
responsible for it.

1187
02:02:12,929 --> 02:02:15,920
And you won't even have the
opportunity to seek forgiveness.

1188
02:02:16,364 --> 02:02:17,626
Sir!

1189
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:25,632
My love...

1190
02:02:31,307 --> 02:02:34,639
sweetheart...

1191
02:02:37,612 --> 02:02:43,640
Do not poke fun at me
like this

1192
02:02:47,518 --> 02:02:54,011
I'm in no way what
your sweetheart should be

1193
02:02:56,926 --> 02:03:03,624
Become like him.
That's what you must do...

1194
02:03:04,429 --> 02:03:10,298
or make me the way you are

1195
02:03:16,305 --> 02:03:20,967
I have sought you from God

1196
02:03:21,376 --> 02:03:25,835
Come, make me your bride,
O beloved

1197
02:03:27,178 --> 02:03:31,341
Come and make me your wife

1198
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:37,114
I have sought you from God

1199
02:03:48,927 --> 02:03:53,487
Do not give up the
riches of your love...

1200
02:03:54,364 --> 02:03:58,663
for this worthless
toy of clay

1201
02:05:03,945 --> 02:05:08,846
Lovers, in this world...

1202
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:15,343
forsake all that is theirs

1203
02:05:16,987 --> 02:05:21,888
They forsake their world

1204
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:56,404
Tell me once...
to come to you

1205
02:05:56,915 --> 02:05:58,905
Come to me

1206
02:06:00,384 --> 02:06:06,343
If I do not come at your call,
I shall be called unfaithful

1207
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:17,892
I'm a poor, homeless
wandering soul...

1208
02:06:24,067 --> 02:06:28,399
who shall ever manage
to keep pace with me?

1209
02:07:46,222 --> 02:07:50,453
There will be times
when I miss you

1210
02:07:51,226 --> 02:07:55,924
And that will
take away my life

1211
02:07:56,863 --> 02:08:01,060
How could you seek that, my love?

1212
02:08:01,934 --> 02:08:06,130
For, I haven't given you
the right to die

1213
02:08:18,278 --> 02:08:22,838
Live a hundred years,
I will, for you

1214
02:08:23,447 --> 02:08:27,906
Or else, I'll poison myself

1215
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:35,280
I have sought you from God

1216
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:40,452
Come, make me your bride

1217
02:08:41,827 --> 02:08:46,194
I have entrusted to you
my body and soul

1218
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:50,922
You have bought me over

1219
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:56,495
I have sought you
from God

1220
02:08:57,239 --> 02:09:03,175
We shall never break, O Lord

1221
02:09:04,743 --> 02:09:11,908
Separate, we might...
but not in souls

1222
02:10:07,018 --> 02:10:09,281
Why did you do it, sir?

1223
02:10:10,221 --> 02:10:11,653
It was necessary.

1224
02:10:12,622 --> 02:10:14,317
Listen to me, sir.

1225
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:18,620
Let them return to
their world of love.

1226
02:10:20,328 --> 02:10:21,692
They want to live, sir.

1227
02:10:22,028 --> 02:10:25,020
Your companions are supposed
to be soldiers; not lovers.

1228
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:30,692
Love is a gift of God, sir.

1229
02:10:33,103 --> 02:10:37,038
Should anything be achieved at
the cost of love and emotions...

1230
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:41,534
it will not be acceptable to God.
- They made some promises to me.

1231
02:10:42,176 --> 02:10:46,076
The promises will be fulfilled.

1232
02:10:47,079 --> 02:10:49,570
I'm with you.

1233
02:10:51,649 --> 02:10:55,379
Blow my head away...
and, by God, I will not complain!

1234
02:10:57,419 --> 02:11:01,012
Grant them their life, sir.
Release them.

1235
02:11:01,555 --> 02:11:07,617
You seem to have forgotten that
I've left behind my office.

1236
02:11:09,027 --> 02:11:11,517
But I still realise
my responsibilities.

1237
02:11:12,029 --> 02:11:15,589
And there is no place for cheap
behaviour in my scheme of things.

1238
02:11:22,103 --> 02:11:26,402
You're speaking just
like a politician.

1239
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:32,405
Who, seated on his chair...

1240
02:11:34,412 --> 02:11:38,744
thrusts thousands into a war,
for his own ego and pride...

1241
02:11:40,081 --> 02:11:42,072
and calls them soldiers.

1242
02:11:43,083 --> 02:11:48,577
All he sends the soldier's widow
and folks, later...

1243
02:11:49,087 --> 02:11:53,751
is a letter of consolation,
a little money and a medal!

1244
02:11:55,091 --> 02:11:59,083
You are an ignorant man.
Keep your views to yourself.

1245
02:12:00,397 --> 02:12:03,023
For, every soldier knows...

1246
02:12:04,065 --> 02:12:11,333
that his uniform can even be
his shroud.

1247
02:12:12,204 --> 02:12:14,193
How right you are!

1248
02:12:15,572 --> 02:12:18,564
And should he wish to escape
the shroud of death...

1249
02:12:19,142 --> 02:12:22,338
leaders like you would
bury him alive!

1250
02:12:23,612 --> 02:12:26,079
But Johny and Baiju
are not even your soldiers!

1251
02:12:27,648 --> 02:12:30,581
They're merely prisoners.

1252
02:12:31,084 --> 02:12:33,517
Whom you have granted
life in charity.

1253
02:12:34,018 --> 02:12:37,249
You have. As a jailor.

1254
02:12:39,389 --> 02:12:42,084
For a jailor, a prisoner's life
is as precious...

1255
02:12:42,357 --> 02:12:45,121
as that of a goat
in a slaughterhouse!

1256
02:12:45,493 --> 02:12:48,461
They are slaughtered every day...

1257
02:12:49,395 --> 02:12:52,386
but no one casts a look of
sympathy at their plight.

1258
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:58,635
They want to cry...
they want to live!

1259
02:13:00,304 --> 02:13:03,465
As for these prisoners, they
aren't even sheep for you.

1260
02:13:04,073 --> 02:13:07,735
You think they're dogs...
mere dogs!

1261
02:13:09,443 --> 02:13:14,310
Only to have another medal added
to your already decorated uniform!

1262
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:18,205
Only because these dogs
can avenge for you...

1263
02:13:18,449 --> 02:13:21,077
the death of your
children!

1264
02:13:41,566 --> 02:13:43,533
Now listen to what I have to say.

1265
02:13:44,134 --> 02:13:46,567
My name is Vishwapratap Singh.

1266
02:13:49,204 --> 02:13:51,137
Singh means a lion.

1267
02:13:51,472 --> 02:13:56,465
I've lived like a lion,
and I'll die like a lion.

1268
02:13:57,742 --> 02:14:03,112
And a lion does not need dogs
to protect his children.

1269
02:14:04,115 --> 02:14:05,944
He can take revenge
on his own.

1270
02:14:06,148 --> 02:14:09,514
I can forget fools like you...

1271
02:14:10,151 --> 02:14:14,109
but I cannot forget those
380 prisoners in the prison...

1272
02:14:14,488 --> 02:14:17,115
who were dear to me
like my children...

1273
02:14:17,690 --> 02:14:22,125
and who were shot to death by
the PSO within those four walls.

1274
02:14:24,128 --> 02:14:26,960
I will fight for them.

1275
02:14:28,363 --> 02:14:33,356
I will go to the enemy
on my own.

1276
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:37,134
I don't want those
weak-kneed lovers...

1277
02:14:37,437 --> 02:14:40,427
who drop their weapons
as soon as they fall in love.

1278
02:14:41,339 --> 02:14:42,533
I don't want them.

1279
02:14:54,515 --> 02:14:57,176
The PSO told me the same thing.

1280
02:14:58,451 --> 02:15:00,680
Rexson told me the same thing.

1281
02:15:02,254 --> 02:15:04,949
He told me to kill my emotions!

1282
02:15:05,389 --> 02:15:08,118
They asked me to pick up
the gun and slay Heena!

1283
02:15:09,191 --> 02:15:12,353
What's the difference
between you and Rexson then?

1284
02:15:15,063 --> 02:15:18,588
We're prisoners, after all.
And prisoners we will be!

1285
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:23,293
We can never get our freedom!
We will never be freed.

1286
02:15:24,168 --> 02:15:26,534
When a man goes blind...

1287
02:15:27,204 --> 02:15:30,171
he can't tell the difference
between night and day.

1288
02:15:30,705 --> 02:15:37,165
But there will be a day when
realisation will dawn upon you...

1289
02:15:38,311 --> 02:15:41,177
and you'll be able to
see the difference.

1290
02:15:54,389 --> 02:15:59,188
Vishwanath Pratap Singh will
take on the enemy, all alone!

1291
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:03,127
I don't need such
frivolous lovers...

1292
02:16:03,495 --> 02:16:06,430
who give up arms the
moment they fall in love!

1293
02:16:18,238 --> 02:16:20,603
I want Rana's men...

1294
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:23,401
dead or alive!

1295
02:16:27,645 --> 02:16:29,635
What have you decided?

1296
02:16:32,181 --> 02:16:33,614
Revolt.

1297
02:16:36,184 --> 02:16:40,676
And you?
- Just what you have decided.

1298
02:17:06,504 --> 02:17:14,500
You come first;
everyone else comes after you

1299
02:17:16,178 --> 02:17:24,174
You are my effort
and my culmination

1300
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:32,214
I shall live and die for you,
O love...

1301
02:17:44,231 --> 02:17:46,596
I've brought this shawl for you.

1302
02:17:49,634 --> 02:17:53,626
Muniyatai said you're
running a fever.

1303
02:17:56,238 --> 02:17:58,570
Tell her, I'm all right.

1304
02:18:00,208 --> 02:18:02,402
I will not die so easily.

1305
02:18:03,278 --> 02:18:07,212
Aren't you coming home?
Muniyatai has made food for you.

1306
02:18:09,215 --> 02:18:12,546
What's the point in talking
about such things?

1307
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:23,623
I got carried away last night
and spoke a bit too much.

1308
02:18:33,298 --> 02:18:36,232
If we were your sons,
wouldn't you have forgiven us?

1309
02:18:48,275 --> 02:18:50,833
Go home, Dada Thakur.
Please.

1310
02:18:51,643 --> 02:18:54,270
I'll bring them home, too.

1311
02:19:07,853 --> 02:19:09,480
It's no use, Sir.

1312
02:19:09,956 --> 02:19:13,823
They've been drinking the whole night.
They've knocked off three bottles.

1313
02:19:14,226 --> 02:19:16,216
They won't wake up
for another 5 hours.

1314
02:19:45,614 --> 02:19:47,604
I've seen it all.

1315
02:19:49,415 --> 02:19:51,212
Give me that remote control.

1316
02:19:54,285 --> 02:19:56,276
Now that you've seen it...

1317
02:19:56,487 --> 02:20:01,287
you must realise that how
close death is.

1318
02:20:01,958 --> 02:20:06,586
I can see and understand
the tricks of the enemy.

1319
02:20:08,096 --> 02:20:13,054
They've handed over guns
to our children...

1320
02:20:13,332 --> 02:20:17,859
so that they can fire
at our own kith and kin.

1321
02:20:18,202 --> 02:20:22,002
I don't want you. I want those
three prisoners you've brought.

1322
02:20:22,272 --> 02:20:24,330
They're not prisoners;
they are my sons.

1323
02:20:24,474 --> 02:20:26,464
I've pledged to kill them.

1324
02:20:26,975 --> 02:20:29,534
And I've pledged
to protect them.

1325
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:31,570
You'll be dead, too.

1326
02:20:31,979 --> 02:20:34,172
Now that we see our own
children turn terrorists...

1327
02:20:34,347 --> 02:20:36,541
which parent would want
to live anymore?

1328
02:21:00,598 --> 02:21:02,088
Wake up!

1329
02:21:02,332 --> 02:21:05,165
Dada Thakur's life is in danger!
And you're sleeping?!

1330
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:16,506
Damn this hand!

1331
02:21:28,017 --> 02:21:31,382
Bastards! Twenty of you
against one man?!

1332
02:21:35,388 --> 02:21:39,380
Open the bloody door,
if you're man enough!

1333
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:45,851
Dada Thakur!
Open the door!

1334
02:21:46,162 --> 02:21:48,220
Get away from
that window, Khairu!

1335
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,990
Open the door, Dada Thakur!

1336
02:22:38,432 --> 02:22:40,227
How did this happen?!

1337
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:51,430
You're okay, aren't you?

1338
02:22:53,007 --> 02:22:54,998
Have you had a dream?

1339
02:22:57,044 --> 02:22:58,533
Don't worry.
Your husband will be all right.

1340
02:22:59,445 --> 02:23:01,208
Want to go to him?
You can't.

1341
02:23:01,382 --> 02:23:04,372
Not till my husband returns
from Kanpur, I can't let you go.

1342
02:23:54,449 --> 02:23:55,916
Doctor?

1343
02:23:57,919 --> 02:24:00,852
I'm sorry. I cannot say
whether he will survive.

1344
02:24:01,422 --> 02:24:04,856
Can't you say?!
And how will he not survive?!

1345
02:24:06,292 --> 02:24:08,725
What kind of a doctor are you
to say, you're not sure?!

1346
02:24:08,926 --> 02:24:11,120
Of what use is this
bloody hospital?!

1347
02:24:11,428 --> 02:24:14,192
Throw away that white coat!
Burn down this hospital...

1348
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:16,262
if you cannot save
even one patient!

1349
02:24:16,465 --> 02:24:19,262
Do we bring a patient here
to give up hope?!

1350
02:24:19,534 --> 02:24:22,434
Calm down.
- I'll see how he doesn't survive!

1351
02:24:23,170 --> 02:24:25,433
Let's pray to God.
- He'll have to live.

1352
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:12,961
You are my faith;
you are my religion

1353
02:25:13,437 --> 02:25:18,896
I mean everything to you
and you mean everything to me

1354
02:25:42,791 --> 02:25:47,489
Every deed of mine...

1355
02:25:48,061 --> 02:25:52,497
shall be for you,
dear nation

1356
02:25:53,532 --> 02:25:58,490
My heart is already yours

1357
02:25:59,135 --> 02:26:03,763
I will also lay down
my life for you, O Motherland

1358
02:26:04,172 --> 02:26:11,975
I've given my heart to you.
I'll give my to you, too

1359
02:26:40,831 --> 02:26:43,230
God isn't great this time, sir!

1360
02:26:43,765 --> 02:26:46,232
Dada Thakur has regained
consciousness. And I'm in a soup!

1361
02:26:49,702 --> 02:26:52,364
I'm coming over to you, Dr Dang.

1362
02:26:52,771 --> 02:26:55,968
It's not safe for me to
stay here anymore.

1363
02:26:56,974 --> 02:26:59,703
I'm telling you the truth!

1364
02:27:20,123 --> 02:27:22,819
We only want Dr. Dang's
whereabouts.

1365
02:27:23,259 --> 02:27:25,249
I'll tell you!

1366
02:27:25,894 --> 02:27:27,690
You cannot meet Dada Thakur.

1367
02:27:27,895 --> 02:27:32,354
They've come from a far off place.
It's very important to Dada Thakur.

1368
02:27:32,766 --> 02:27:34,700
The visiting hours for the
guests is already over.

1369
02:27:34,768 --> 02:27:35,893
They're not guests.

1370
02:27:35,968 --> 02:27:38,435
Tell him that his wife and his
son have come to meet him.

1371
02:27:38,837 --> 02:27:41,099
Do you wish to see Dada Thakur?
- Yes, Doctor.

1372
02:27:41,271 --> 02:27:43,364
Come along.
I'll take you to him.

1373
02:27:43,773 --> 02:27:46,707
Stay here.
- Go on. And come back soon.

1374
02:28:01,686 --> 02:28:05,815
What's all this?
Why is it dark in here?

1375
02:28:22,132 --> 02:28:27,330
You're as shocked to see me here
as I am glad to meet you.

1376
02:28:29,005 --> 02:28:31,131
Well? You've been enjoying it,
haven't you?

1377
02:28:32,373 --> 02:28:35,364
Don't you worry! I haven't
come here to kill you.

1378
02:28:36,375 --> 02:28:39,469
I want to keep you alive.
For a long time, too.

1379
02:28:41,045 --> 02:28:45,003
Till such time as every
desire in you...

1380
02:28:46,049 --> 02:28:49,643
and your sense of pride
is buried with you.

1381
02:28:52,053 --> 02:28:55,544
I want to keep you alive,
till your tricolour...

1382
02:28:56,056 --> 02:28:59,991
of which you are so proud,
goes down on its own.

1383
02:29:01,126 --> 02:29:07,120
You probably take the tricolor to
be a yard of mere cloth, Dr Dang.

1384
02:29:09,132 --> 02:29:12,258
It has taken the blood of millions
of martyrs to take its form.

1385
02:29:14,401 --> 02:29:17,165
It's the pride of
a billion Indians.

1386
02:29:19,039 --> 02:29:24,634
Try to touch it,
and you'll burn to ashes.

1387
02:29:25,309 --> 02:29:26,571
Ashes?

1388
02:29:31,347 --> 02:29:34,542
It was I who showed you
the ashes, Rana.

1389
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:39,040
At the crematorium...

1390
02:29:40,652 --> 02:29:48,352
the remains of your children;
your prisoners and your ideals.

1391
02:29:49,291 --> 02:29:51,555
Have you already forgotten
the sight?

1392
02:29:52,062 --> 02:29:54,495
The funeral-pyre? The ashes?

1393
02:29:57,564 --> 02:30:05,333
The ashes you speak of have
already turned into dynamite.

1394
02:30:06,102 --> 02:30:07,229
Dynamite?

1395
02:30:09,105 --> 02:30:12,541
You mean your three prisoners,
who are here to eliminate me?

1396
02:30:13,442 --> 02:30:16,103
Those apes are heading
towards my camp.

1397
02:30:16,444 --> 02:30:18,673
To be blown up by the
explosives I've laid.

1398
02:30:19,013 --> 02:30:22,469
Which means they have
reached the evil empire.

1399
02:30:22,748 --> 02:30:24,112
Sure, they have.

1400
02:30:24,282 --> 02:30:27,410
They're taking the
Holy Mother with them, too.

1401
02:30:28,418 --> 02:30:31,113
Would you like to know
which Holy Mother?

1402
02:30:31,587 --> 02:30:33,521
Give him a glimpse.

1403
02:30:51,167 --> 02:30:52,498
You scoundrel!

1404
02:30:59,172 --> 02:31:00,935
Leave him alone!

1405
02:31:02,442 --> 02:31:04,602
Let me go! You scoundrel!

1406
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:07,102
No! Don't kill him!

1407
02:31:07,412 --> 02:31:09,936
He must stay alive,
I say!

1408
02:31:10,180 --> 02:31:13,114
To weep! And to burn the bodies
of his children, his prisoners!

1409
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:15,417
I want him to die
a painful death.

1410
02:31:16,251 --> 02:31:24,247
I want to remind him of
the echo of the slap.

1411
02:31:26,191 --> 02:31:28,488
The echo of the slap!

1412
02:31:30,328 --> 02:31:34,922
Every time we meet...

1413
02:31:36,165 --> 02:31:41,157
and we will meet.
We will meet very often.

1414
02:31:58,547 --> 02:32:00,673
I'm speaking from
the Electric House.

1415
02:32:01,182 --> 02:32:03,411
Please send the
jeep over quickly.

1416
02:32:18,393 --> 02:32:19,985
Stay here, okay?

1417
02:32:21,163 --> 02:32:22,992
What happened?
- It's all happening!

1418
02:32:23,164 --> 02:32:25,393
Hands up, and take us
to your den!

1419
02:32:29,168 --> 02:32:31,636
Dada Thakur asks us to
understand things...

1420
02:32:31,969 --> 02:32:33,936
and then head
for the enemy base.

1421
02:32:34,172 --> 02:32:36,468
C'mon... show us your base.
- Come on!

1422
02:32:37,173 --> 02:32:40,505
Gyaneshwar!
Here I come!

1423
02:32:40,975 --> 02:32:42,169
You?!

1424
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:45,670
Khairu! She's going to be
the end of us!

1425
02:32:46,246 --> 02:32:48,214
Go away!

1426
02:32:49,581 --> 02:32:51,572
Get lost, silly girl!
- Hang on...

1427
02:32:52,217 --> 02:32:53,649
Tulsi... come here.

1428
02:32:55,219 --> 02:32:58,050
Officer are cautioned that
secret agents of the enemy...

1429
02:32:58,288 --> 02:33:00,152
are trying to enter
our base.

1430
02:33:00,388 --> 02:33:03,153
Officers must show their
identity cards on demand.

1431
02:33:06,460 --> 02:33:07,427
Go!

1432
02:33:10,361 --> 02:33:12,352
Everything okay?
- Okay, sir.

1433
02:33:24,405 --> 02:33:27,203
He's had a heart attack!

1434
02:33:43,219 --> 02:33:45,049
He's been dead
for half-an-hour.

1435
02:33:46,554 --> 02:33:48,885
Who brought him in here?

1436
02:33:54,226 --> 02:33:56,524
Victory to India!
- Victory to India!

1437
02:33:59,130 --> 02:34:01,029
No one will come in or go out!

1438
02:34:03,232 --> 02:34:05,097
Are they already in?

1439
02:34:05,233 --> 02:34:10,192
No, sir. There's nobody on the
CC-TV. They're all our men.

1440
02:34:10,836 --> 02:34:12,235
Show me the prisoners section.
Quick.

1441
02:34:17,308 --> 02:34:22,209
Long live Nihal Singh!

1442
02:34:44,393 --> 02:34:46,258
Look at me carefully.

1443
02:34:47,395 --> 02:34:49,954
Indian forces have gained entry.

1444
02:34:50,264 --> 02:34:52,129
What?
- Victory to India!

1445
02:35:00,571 --> 02:35:04,529
The security officers are
on alert to welcome Dr. Dang.

1446
02:35:08,510 --> 02:35:11,205
They will escort Dr. Dang inside.

1447
02:35:18,584 --> 02:35:21,210
At a little distance from here
is the Red Tower...

1448
02:35:21,486 --> 02:35:23,477
which contains so much
of explosives...

1449
02:35:23,588 --> 02:35:26,555
that the PSO can fight for
16 days at a stretch.

1450
02:35:27,255 --> 02:35:29,951
If this building is blown up,
the PSO will be wiped out.

1451
02:35:34,395 --> 02:35:37,022
Why drink so much of beer that
you lose control over yourself?

1452
02:35:40,265 --> 02:35:44,029
What happened?
- We often have a power failure here.

1453
02:35:44,268 --> 02:35:46,531
I've intimated the Red Tower.

1454
02:35:47,102 --> 02:35:51,265
Since work on the tunnel is on,
power failure is common occurrence.

1455
02:36:03,247 --> 02:36:06,215
Where had you hidden
this precious diamond?

1456
02:36:15,255 --> 02:36:20,022
Fools! Asses! To have bound you
in these chains!

1457
02:36:20,525 --> 02:36:25,257
This beautiful body ought to be
adorned with gold jewellery.

1458
02:36:26,063 --> 02:36:29,999
Your body is beautiful...
and indeed intoxicating.

1459
02:36:32,067 --> 02:36:36,264
Release her.
And bring her to my chamber.

1460
02:37:02,754 --> 02:37:08,088
I have sought you from God

1461
02:37:09,260 --> 02:37:13,490
Make me your bride,
my love

1462
02:37:22,868 --> 02:37:24,267
He's Rana's man!

1463
02:37:41,247 --> 02:37:43,306
Don't, Baiju! They'll kill you!

1464
02:37:46,518 --> 02:37:47,814
No!

1465
02:37:51,454 --> 02:37:52,978
Hold it, Baiju!

1466
02:37:58,826 --> 02:38:01,419
I beg of you!
Please let him go!

1467
02:38:04,297 --> 02:38:06,093
Please let him go.

1468
02:38:08,066 --> 02:38:10,727
Spray those bullets in his chest!
- No!

1469
02:38:12,035 --> 02:38:14,026
Hold the fire!

1470
02:38:14,304 --> 02:38:16,498
We've got to find his
two other friends.

1471
02:38:35,318 --> 02:38:38,310
Call out to your colleagues.

1472
02:38:42,355 --> 02:38:45,119
Must I?
- Of course. Call them!

1473
02:38:47,359 --> 02:38:48,257
Friends!

1474
02:38:49,593 --> 02:38:55,155
I'm a poor son of India!
A prisoner!

1475
02:38:56,565 --> 02:38:59,556
I have pledged to Dada Thakur...

1476
02:39:00,501 --> 02:39:05,938
that I will take this devil's
head to my soil...

1477
02:39:06,639 --> 02:39:13,236
and every drop of my blood will
call out till the end...

1478
02:39:13,509 --> 02:39:15,170
Victory to India

1479
02:39:15,278 --> 02:39:16,905
Victory to India!

1480
02:39:17,113 --> 02:39:20,013
Victory to India!

1481
02:39:37,127 --> 02:39:38,558
Hold it!

1482
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:50,067
No! Don't, Khairu!

1483
02:39:55,573 --> 02:39:58,700
Khairuddin Kisti.
Remember that!

1484
02:40:14,018 --> 02:40:16,508
Count till five.
We won't wait any longer.

1485
02:40:23,558 --> 02:40:27,617
Five, six, seven and eight!
My Lord! I'm coming over!

1486
02:40:28,696 --> 02:40:33,290
God Almighty! Don't do this!
I was about to surrender anyway!

1487
02:40:33,632 --> 02:40:39,626
I'm a very poor man. These
bastards talked me into trouble!

1488
02:40:40,669 --> 02:40:43,229
To hell with Johny!
And to hell with you!

1489
02:40:43,572 --> 02:40:45,471
He said that we'd play
'soldier soldier'.

1490
02:40:45,673 --> 02:40:49,631
But I don't want to be a soldier!
Here's the cap... and the uniform!

1491
02:40:50,177 --> 02:40:57,080
I swear, sir! By your mother!
I'm not lying!

1492
02:40:57,313 --> 02:40:59,372
Send me back home...
I was very happy back there!

1493
02:40:59,683 --> 02:41:04,210
I beg of you... let me return!
Release me!

1494
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:06,450
Let go of my feet.
- I won't!

1495
02:41:06,687 --> 02:41:09,553
I want to live!
I'm scared of death!

1496
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:14,081
I have little children, a mother,
my sisters. I beg of you, Sir!

1497
02:41:15,627 --> 02:41:18,619
Don't you move,
you son-of-a-crow!

1498
02:41:26,935 --> 02:41:31,200
Ask your guys to
drop their guns!

1499
02:41:31,504 --> 02:41:34,495
Drop your guns!

1500
02:41:35,108 --> 02:41:39,668
Move now... with your arms raised
and legs on the ground! Move!

1501
02:41:42,311 --> 02:41:47,338
The tables have turned!
Wow!

1502
02:41:47,982 --> 02:41:53,111
Had my mother been around, she'd
have been thrilled with me!

1503
02:41:53,687 --> 02:41:57,985
Now, guys... you will repeat
just what I want you to!

1504
02:41:58,690 --> 02:42:01,282
Dr. Dang... Shame! Shame!

1505
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:07,618
Gentlemen! Some of your
dear ones are our guests!

1506
02:42:08,664 --> 02:42:10,494
Meet them first!

1507
02:42:11,965 --> 02:42:13,432
Look carefully.

1508
02:42:13,932 --> 02:42:19,097
There are bombs tied to their hands.
And I hold the remote control.

1509
02:42:19,904 --> 02:42:22,337
You guys are now in control.

1510
02:42:24,141 --> 02:42:27,667
You can let them die, if you wish.
Or let them live, too.

1511
02:42:28,276 --> 02:42:32,268
Wisdom now lies in releasing me.

1512
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:38,176
We'll have to let him go.

1513
02:42:55,630 --> 02:43:03,499
Every deed we shall do,
for you, beloved nation

1514
02:43:17,077 --> 02:43:21,239
This is my battle.
You must not get involved.

1515
02:43:22,413 --> 02:43:24,380
You have done your job.

1516
02:43:25,882 --> 02:43:28,406
No family with a
traitor like Jagga...

1517
02:43:29,019 --> 02:43:31,384
can ever think it has
done its job.

1518
02:43:31,886 --> 02:43:35,150
Such families are finished.
My job begins now.

1519
02:43:35,457 --> 02:43:37,219
Dada Thakur...

1520
02:43:37,958 --> 02:43:40,425
Khairu has sent this
note for you.

1521
02:43:42,994 --> 02:43:46,451
What are you guys doing?!
Throwing a girl like that?

1522
02:43:46,896 --> 02:43:48,454
Get out, fools!

1523
02:43:59,906 --> 02:44:06,536
Now look, Radha. You love a guy
who loves his nation.

1524
02:44:07,911 --> 02:44:10,242
And I... I love you.

1525
02:44:11,079 --> 02:44:13,070
It's love at first sight.

1526
02:44:13,482 --> 02:44:18,475
Indian girls have always
been my weakness.

1527
02:44:19,018 --> 02:44:21,008
They do things to me.

1528
02:44:21,887 --> 02:44:24,879
I'll let them go.
I'll do just as you say.

1529
02:44:27,125 --> 02:44:32,891
But, for once... you must
be my Queen.

1530
02:44:33,963 --> 02:44:36,396
It'll be great fun. What say?
Okay?

1531
02:44:46,938 --> 02:44:48,905
Hey, lady!
What're you doing here?

1532
02:44:49,072 --> 02:44:51,404
I've come to look for my husband.

1533
02:44:51,975 --> 02:44:54,943
The villagers say
you're holding him captive.

1534
02:44:55,177 --> 02:44:56,940
How did you cross the border?

1535
02:44:57,078 --> 02:44:59,875
That man in the bus
gave me a ride.

1536
02:45:06,451 --> 02:45:08,214
Come on out, whoever's in there!

1537
02:45:15,224 --> 02:45:18,020
Go back from here.
Hurry up!

1538
02:45:21,561 --> 02:45:23,393
Victory to India!

1539
02:45:52,382 --> 02:45:55,943
O love...

1540
02:45:57,219 --> 02:46:05,147
To make my love come true,
I'm willing to stand any test

1541
02:46:06,959 --> 02:46:11,417
For, the life of a nightingale,
belongs in the gardens

1542
02:47:15,939 --> 02:47:19,499
I'm fire. I'm lightning

1543
02:47:20,009 --> 02:47:24,307
I'm out to stake my life

1544
02:47:29,582 --> 02:47:33,984
To set the enemy on fire

1545
02:48:32,558 --> 02:48:36,994
No one in the world
has known me yet

1546
02:48:37,996 --> 02:48:42,294
I'd rather have myself beheaded,
then bow to someone

1547
02:48:49,404 --> 02:48:53,567
I'd rather die
for India

1548
02:48:59,176 --> 02:49:03,305
The nightingale, after all,
lives for its land

1549
02:49:12,987 --> 02:49:14,816
Victory to India!

1550
02:49:43,239 --> 02:49:45,230
Fire! Fire!

1551
02:49:49,043 --> 02:49:51,876
Call the fire brigade!
Put out this fire!

1552
02:49:58,049 --> 02:50:01,177
Khairu's dead. His body's lying
in the compound.

1553
02:50:26,103 --> 02:50:34,099
Every deed of ours shall be
for you, O Motherland

1554
02:50:35,242 --> 02:50:42,941
Our heart is yours;
we'll give you our lives, too

1555
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:05,087
Who's bombing us?
- It's an Indian carrier.

1556
02:51:54,163 --> 02:51:57,461
Step aside, Sardar.
And send the girl over to me.

1557
02:51:57,898 --> 02:51:59,161
You bastard!

1558
02:52:00,934 --> 02:52:01,798
You scoundrel!

1559
02:52:04,402 --> 02:52:05,391
Run away!

1560
02:52:09,274 --> 02:52:10,398
Oh God...

1561
02:52:13,876 --> 02:52:15,365
Send the ammunition immediately!

1562
02:52:16,144 --> 02:52:17,133
C'mon!

1563
02:52:17,712 --> 02:52:20,703
That's the red tower, which
stocks 90°/° of the explosives.

1564
02:52:21,147 --> 02:52:22,910
Who told you?
- Nihal Singh.

1565
02:52:23,149 --> 02:52:26,140
If the building is not blown up
in 15 minutes, we're in danger.

1566
02:52:26,652 --> 02:52:28,642
But how do we blow it up?

1567
02:52:31,588 --> 02:52:33,180
There is a way.

1568
02:52:33,489 --> 02:52:35,354
We're sending the
explosives, sir.

1569
02:52:40,393 --> 02:52:41,451
Who's that?

1570
02:52:51,935 --> 02:52:53,925
Why is our truck returning?

1571
02:53:05,143 --> 02:53:08,805
Where are you taking the truck?
- To blow up the Red Tower.

1572
02:53:10,082 --> 02:53:12,549
We're carrying explosives
in this truck, Khairu!

1573
02:53:13,083 --> 02:53:16,075
We'll be blown up with the tower!
- Not you... it'll only be me.

1574
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:20,551
No, Khairu!
Let's find another way.

1575
02:53:20,722 --> 02:53:23,155
There is no other away.
Get down, both of you.

1576
02:53:23,490 --> 02:53:25,480
No, Khairu! If you go,
we come with you!

1577
02:53:25,591 --> 02:53:28,787
Don't talk like a fool! You've got
to save mother and the others.

1578
02:53:29,294 --> 02:53:31,591
How about your life?
- Don't worry about my life.

1579
02:53:31,762 --> 02:53:33,592
I have no one.

1580
02:53:33,863 --> 02:53:37,593
You guys have to settle down!
You have promises to keep!

1581
02:53:39,134 --> 02:53:40,761
This is where my
promise ends.

1582
02:53:40,903 --> 02:53:42,870
No!
- No!

1583
02:53:44,104 --> 02:53:46,094
Get down, I say!
- No!

1584
02:53:53,244 --> 02:53:54,607
Stop the truck!

1585
02:53:54,711 --> 02:53:58,111
Get down, I say!
- No! I won't let you go alone!

1586
02:54:49,683 --> 02:54:51,513
You have cheated us!

1587
02:54:53,084 --> 02:54:55,074
This is a betrayal!

1588
02:55:04,559 --> 02:55:06,492
No, don't cry.

1589
02:55:07,027 --> 02:55:09,654
We'll do what he was
supposed to do.

1590
02:55:10,663 --> 02:55:13,153
We will not spare them!

1591
02:55:17,401 --> 02:55:21,302
We swear on your love!

1592
02:55:22,671 --> 02:55:27,504
We'll raze Dr. Dang's
evil empire to ashes!

1593
02:55:35,314 --> 02:55:39,510
Alert the Red Tower immediately.
And when is my plane arriving?

1594
02:55:39,717 --> 02:55:41,150
In 15 minutes, Sir.

1595
02:55:46,754 --> 02:55:49,723
Dr. Dang has never
conceded defeat.

1596
02:55:50,324 --> 02:55:53,223
In a matter of 15 minutes,
everything will turn to ashes.

1597
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,711
Do you hear the echo?

1598
02:56:38,523 --> 02:56:40,013
Do you?

1599
02:56:42,192 --> 02:56:44,716
It's the echo of the explosives...

1600
02:56:45,262 --> 02:56:48,718
you showered on the unarmed
inmates of my prison.

1601
02:56:50,598 --> 02:56:56,466
It echoes the cries of the orphaned
children and the widows!

1602
02:56:59,570 --> 02:57:05,507
This is the echo of India...
whom you wanted to destroy.

1603
02:57:06,143 --> 02:57:11,135
And today, you are in
India's clutches, Dr Dang.

1604
02:57:38,264 --> 02:57:41,597
Well, Dang?
Was that fun?

1605
02:57:43,134 --> 02:57:47,762
Did you really believe that you
could destroy the country?

1606
02:57:49,472 --> 02:57:51,439
Did you really think so?

1607
02:57:51,773 --> 02:57:54,536
No! It's impossible.

1608
02:57:56,342 --> 02:57:57,536
Impossible!

1609
02:57:59,112 --> 02:58:02,705
Whenever demons like you
set foot on our soil...

1610
02:58:03,148 --> 02:58:06,707
our tricolour will make sure
it wipes them out!

1611
02:58:19,759 --> 02:58:20,726
Brother!

1612
02:58:32,767 --> 02:58:34,200
You swine!

1613
02:58:40,040 --> 02:58:42,030
You're in my hands today!

1614
02:58:42,774 --> 02:58:45,766
Don't shoot, Johny!

1615
02:58:49,513 --> 02:58:52,776
You've done a wise thing
by not killing me.

1616
02:58:53,515 --> 02:58:58,577
Perhaps you forget that your
wife and child are in my custody.

1617
02:58:59,987 --> 02:59:02,579
They'll be dead in
another 4 or 5 minutes...

1618
02:59:02,922 --> 02:59:04,718
when my time bomb explodes.

1619
02:59:05,357 --> 02:59:08,257
Come to your senses!
You're a brave soldier.

1620
02:59:09,926 --> 02:59:14,190
Go to your son.
He's waiting for you.

1621
02:59:14,930 --> 02:59:16,328
Go on! Won't you?

1622
02:59:32,442 --> 02:59:33,431
Mother!

1623
02:59:37,678 --> 02:59:40,168
Could you find Mother?
- No, I couldn't.

1624
02:59:40,515 --> 02:59:43,107
Look over there.
I'll search this side over.

1625
03:00:03,263 --> 03:00:04,252
Mother!

1626
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:10,126
My son!

1627
03:00:10,768 --> 03:00:12,291
Mother!

1628
03:00:55,265 --> 03:00:56,492
Good-bye, Rana!

1629
03:02:16,621 --> 03:02:18,248
You have amply proved...

1630
03:02:18,355 --> 03:02:20,687
that man assumes greatness
only with his deeds.

1631
03:02:21,091 --> 03:02:26,049
Be it a criminal or a soldier.
- Everyone thirsts for love.

1632
03:02:26,594 --> 03:02:29,084
Have you given them
your love then?

1633
03:02:29,630 --> 03:02:32,097
They've received a
new lease of life.

1634
03:02:32,365 --> 03:02:35,094
They can go wherever they wish.
It's a big world.

1635
03:02:37,669 --> 03:02:40,501
What do you mean?
Where will we go?!

1636
03:02:41,571 --> 03:02:43,095
Did you hear that, Mother?

1637
03:02:43,239 --> 03:02:45,934
When we wanted to run away,
he locked us up!

1638
03:02:46,108 --> 03:02:48,667
He forced us to have milk;
and scolded us, too.

1639
03:02:49,110 --> 03:02:51,100
Now that we want
to stay at home...

1640
03:02:51,278 --> 03:02:54,110
he asks us to go away
in the big, bad world.

1641
03:02:54,446 --> 03:02:56,209
This isn't fair.

1642
03:02:56,448 --> 03:02:59,438
You have given us a new life,
and lots of love, too.

1643
03:03:00,083 --> 03:03:03,052
Tell us on oath that you didn't
consider us to be your sons?

1644
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:13,991
Did you see how cunning
they are?

1645
03:03:15,561 --> 03:03:17,551
Come on!
- Where to?

1646
03:03:18,096 --> 03:03:19,120
Over there!

1647
03:03:25,502 --> 03:03:30,698
I'll fulfill Khairu's
dream for you.

1648
03:03:32,439 --> 03:03:40,105
Live and die for you,
I shall, O love

1649
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:46,271
I've given you my heart

1650
03:03:46,482 --> 03:03:52,476
I will lay down
my life for you, too
