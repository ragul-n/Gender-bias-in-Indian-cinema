1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,662
Hey, here towards the screen.

2
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:14,958
Hey you! Yeah you turn this side.

3
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,990
Look, I will tell you one thing,
I'll tell you just once.

4
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:19,566
Don't over react after I say.

5
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,099
Don't consume alcohol and
smoke cigarettes, you'll die.

6
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,087
[birds chirping]

7
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,196
Mr. Sekhar...
[chuckles]

8
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,250
Reading paper, huh?

9
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,917
[sarcastically]
Nah! I'm milking a cow.

10
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:42,625
Can't you see, I'm reading the newspaper?

11
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,755
Here.

12
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:48,250
Holy offering from the Lord Lakshmi
Narasimha temple in Arunachalam. Take it.

13
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:52,349
When did Lord Lakshmi Narasimha
shift to Arunachalam from Simhachalam?

14
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,464
Oh my god!

15
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,445
-Priest.
-Yes?

16
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,980
A lizard fell on my son.
You should do something about it.

17
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,407
-A Lizard?
-Yes.

18
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:00,590
-On your son?
-Yes.

19
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,011
[chuckles]
[pressure cooker hisses]

20
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:06,264
These lizards have no other
business but to jump around.

21
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:10,259
First give these Vibhuti
from Shivakanchi to your son.

22
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,001
-He'll get to the safe zone.
-Hmm...

23
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,395
With that you will have
enough money for this month.

24
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,944
Madam, put this Vibhuti
on your son and come back.

25
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,653
He might turn me into
ashes in the mean time.

26
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:22,097
Priest, was the holy offering
made in the temple or at home?

27
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,114
Oh, Lord! No!

28
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,162
Ugh, mom! What is this?

29
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,816
Your face is glowing, son.
My cute little munchkin!

30
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:30,625
Stop it, mom!

31
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,131
Priest, my son's face started
glowing as soon as I applied Vibhuti.

32
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,837
Did you apply fair
and lovely by accident?

33
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,457
Ah, come on!

34
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,162
I don't know what you're
going to do, priest.

35
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,845
My son has to get
married as soon as possible.

36
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,227
A perfect alliance
comes calling for your son.

37
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,625
Yeah, sure. Look. Your phone's ringing.
[phone rings]

38
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,583
It's not mine. It's yours.

39
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:50,667
Hello.

40
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,125
Okay.

41
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,167
Alright...

42
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,290
Ask them to send me her
picture on my Whatsapp.

43
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,606
Okay. Thank you.

44
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,816
Who was that, dear?

45
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,930
-My colleague from the Bank, Ramesh.
-Yes.

46
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,459
I asked him to find an
alliance for our son giving his photo.

47
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,746
He showed our son's photo
to someone. They like him.

48
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,151
They want to arrange the alliance
at the earliest.

49
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:12,724
-Is it?
-Yes.

50
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,421
Thank you, Lord!
[chuckles]

51
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,417
Hi, sister. Hi, brother-in-law.

52
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:17,963
Hello, Mr. Crooked Priest.

53
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:18,977
-Hey, Sunny,
-Yes?

54
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,204
Abhi had been offered
an alliance just now.

55
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:21,708
He's in trouble.

56
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,430
You talk to them first and arrange a meet.

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,640
I'll do it in a snap.

58
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,875
-Marriage?
-Yes.

59
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,329
Priest, how do you say we proceed now?

60
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,777
As per your son's horoscope...

61
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,167
He'll have a blissful marriage only
if the alliance is held at your place.

62
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:34,542
What? Is the alliance for me?

63
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:37,000
Priest, we couldn't
understand your chants up until today.

64
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,669
-Now I can't even understand your words.
-That means...

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,437
You don't have to visit
their house for the meet up.

66
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:43,881
-They'll be coming here...
-Damn! How can I get married so soon?

67
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,102
Anyways, I've seen things much weird.

68
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,167
Mom!

69
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,720
Dear, what are you waiting for?

70
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,209
Call them right now and invite them home.

71
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,240
Mr. Sasthry... Generally, the bride
offers everyone coffee at an alliance.

72
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,876
Generally bride servers coffee
when we visit her house for matches.

73
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:56,376
Yes.

74
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:57,525
Is the groom going to do it in this case?

75
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,635
It feels really weird to be visiting
your house for the alliance.

76
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,318
Isn't it?

77
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,810
But the priest suggested
we do it at our house.

78
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,732
Who's this guy?

79
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:10,709
My brother...

80
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:19,499
By God's grace, if everything goes as per
plan, he'll be getting married next.

81
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:20,854
God won't be gracious with him.

82
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,789
Sister, no! Sister, no!
[laughs]

83
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,621
He's Abhi's uncle but
they're really close buddies.

84
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,686
Oh. Just like Rama and Laxmana.

85
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,335
Nah. More like Hanuman and his tail.

86
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:33,516
[laughs]

87
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:34,764
Sister, no!

88
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,122
Marriage is waste, damn it!

89
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,329
Buffalo looks upset.

90
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,404
-Abhi...
-Yeah?

91
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:41,579
How long are you going to take?
Everyone's waiting for you downstairs.

92
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:42,613
No uncle! I'm not coming.

93
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,223
Alright. I'll go down and tell them.

94
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:45,128
Uncle...

95
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:45,940
What?

96
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,465
I'll be there in 5
minutes. Don't bother me.

97
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:50,298
He's taking so long to shower.
I wonder what he does in bed.

98
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:52,395
[door creaks]

99
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:54,707
Aunty, where's the washroom?

100
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,153
-It's right there, dear.
-Oh.

101
00:05:58,203 --> 00:05:59,125
I'll go with her, aunty.

102
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,625
Hey! Actually,
I've been trying to tell you something.

103
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,999
Did you notice this? One daughter
is Pooja and the other Archana.

104
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,587
Do your parents visit the temple daily?

105
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,906
Imagine if you had another
brother they would name him as Prasad,

106
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,034
and if another sister they
would name her Harathi.

107
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:18,084
Hmm. That covers all the prayer material.
[chuckles]

108
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,298
You're so funny!

109
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:26,100
I said I'm coming right?
If they can't wait...

110
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,407
Ask them to come to my room,
we can have the alliance here itself.

111
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:38,459
You?

112
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,361
Okay then.
Shall we have the alliance here?

113
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:43,834
Sorry.

114
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:45,250
Hmm.

115
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,459
So you didn't even
take a look at my photo.

116
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,018
I'm Pooja.

117
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,875
Oh, crap! Abhi.

118
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,125
Abhishek.

119
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,000
You have all my details.

120
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:55,834
I've checked them at school.

121
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,919
That scar...

122
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,600
2009... No, wait.

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
Umm... may be 2010.

124
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:04,605
Inter school football tournament...

125
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,356
You banged to the
goal post while blocking a goal.

126
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,875
Deep cut and 2 stitches.

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,625
You were the man of the match.

128
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,000
What the...
How do you know so much about me?

129
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,792
Because I'm also from
Johnson Grammar High School.

130
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,167
Johnson Grammar High School...

131
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:20,625
You wouldn't remember me.

132
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,750
I looked kind of different back then.

133
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:28,680
I had big glasses and
wearing braces on my teeth.

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,417
Okay.

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,681
Well you know the parents'
usual rules, don't you?

136
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,875
Once the girl turns 25,
they will kill us to get married.

137
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,625
I got around
3-4 alliances each day.

138
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,750
And then I came across your
photo yesterday. I agreed right away.

139
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,250
What?

140
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:46,385
-To the alliance, I mean.
-Okay.

141
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:47,000
Sister...

142
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,042
everyone's waiting for you.

143
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,242
Abhi really loves lemon rice.
Do you like it too?

144
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:56,965
I wonder what else Pooja likes.

145
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,538
-She loves to sleep and bunk work.
-Is it?

146
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,815
And she loves watching late
night movies more than anything.

147
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,235
[chuckles]
Good habits.

148
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:06,583
[beeps]

149
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:09,615
Hello, Abhi.

150
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,056
Hello, Abhi.

151
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,488
Hi, Pooja.

152
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:22,497
What are you doing?

153
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,053
Texting you.

154
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:27,644
Really?

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,155
Alright, What's up?

156
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,215
I want to watch a movie, I'm so bored.

157
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,225
I'll text back in an hour.

158
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,128
[phone rings]

159
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:06,443
Hello.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Don't you feel sleepy?

161
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,000
I do.

162
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,957
But I'm doing the
best thing to stay awake.

163
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,949
Really? What's that?

164
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:19,389
I'll tell you something.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

165
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,084
Okay.

166
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,779
You shouldn't judge me.

167
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,187
I won't. Tell me.

168
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,781
Actually, I was surfing something.

169
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,541
A weird link popped up.

170
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,530
And I clicked on it out of curiosity.

171
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,856
A movie named 'Come tonight,
Karate Champ' started playing.

172
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,560
[laughing]
Oh, my god!

173
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:43,875
It's some crazy stuff.

174
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,197
Are you feeling sleepy?

175
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,061
I'm fully awake with that.

176
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:51,319
What are you thinking?

177
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:53,033
Nothing.

178
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,072
Good boy!

179
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,631
-Go study now.
-Alright. Bye.

180
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,185
You go enjoy 'Come tonight, Karate champ'.

181
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:01,009
Hey!
[laughing]

182
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,280
Don't make me hit you.

183
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:05,825
-Okay, bye!
-Bye.

184
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,215
Ping me if you need anything.

185
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,968
-Sure.
-Bye.

186
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,259
I expected the hero to kill the villain.

187
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:16,770
But the heroine killed the hero instead.

188
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:17,850
Something new, isn't it?

189
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,741
-That's how Hollywood movies are.
-Oh, really?

190
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,377
Did you like the movie?

191
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,448
Hmm... I'm not sure.

192
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:27,740
Exactly!

193
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,356
We should either like
the movie or hate it.

194
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,552
I hate it when it's confusing.

195
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,367
What?

196
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,088
Nothing.

197
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:43,238
I was just checking if
you've changed with time.

198
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,292
So, what do you think?

199
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,366
I couldn't understand.
You're the same but different.

200
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,040
You were more mischievous back then.

201
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,852
Everything changes with time, Pooja.

202
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,879
[gasps]
Everything!

203
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:57,301
[chuckles]

204
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,026
Abhi... Carry on.

205
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:05,431
See... You look better like this.

206
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,858
[chuckles]
Yeah!

207
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,125
I'll tell you something.

208
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:14,125
I'm not going to repeat it.

209
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,125
I don't want you to pull my leg once I do.

210
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,250
Okay.

211
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:22,125
I had a huge crush on you...
Since 7th grade.

212
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know why but I really liked you.

213
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,875
I would also imagine you
as my husband sometimes.

214
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,459
That's it.
Let's not talk about this ever again.

215
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:38,500
-Okay?
-Done!

216
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:40,500
Okay, Abhi.

217
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,250
Pooja, I too have something to confess.

218
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,750
You look lovely in this dress.

219
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,500
Thank you.

220
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:55,189
I thought you wouldn't notice.
[chuckles]

221
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,880
Sister, mom just called.

222
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,491
Bye...

223
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:04,042
Bye...

224
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:05,590
Shall I leave then?

225
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah. I think you have
to go. It's getting late.

226
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,584
Let's go.

227
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,542
He's supposed to ask
if we shall meet again.

228
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,500
Or would have told me when
we'll see each other again.

229
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,500
Does that mean he doesn't like me?

230
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:24,569
It means you like him, huh.

231
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,694
[laughing]
Shucks!

232
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:28,042
She sounded so sweet, Abhi.

233
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,250
She's a girl after all.
Anything she says would sound sweet.

234
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,667
Swear on your hair and tell me.
Don't you think she sounded sweet?

235
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,375
Why do you bring up my hair now uncle?

236
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,542
Because no one lies when
their hair is at stake.

237
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,292
-Swear on your hair.
-Not on my hair, please.

238
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,125
Tell me. What do you think about her?

239
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:43,250
Don't look so moody.

240
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,157
Look at sister and brother-in-law.
How they're really worried about you.

241
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:47,625
Make a decision.

242
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,042
Why don't you two meet casually
and get to know each other?

243
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,142
You can think of marriage later.

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,625
Change that expression
on your face, sister.

245
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:02,625
Lunch, huh?

246
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:03,532
[gasps]

247
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,476
I see he wants to pick you up.
[chuckles]

248
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,714
He wants to take you out on a date.
[chuckles]

249
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,276
So he's going to be my brother-in-law.
[laughing]

250
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,917
"Is this really me I'm looking at?"

251
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:42,375
"I lose track when I'm with you"

252
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:49,601
"Is this you casting a spell on me?"

253
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:52,875
"My heart has never felt this way"

254
00:13:56,886 --> 00:14:02,832
"I cannot let a minute without you"

255
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:09,500
"I see you work magic in my dreams"

256
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:16,729
"I fall short of words to express"

257
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:23,500
"I'm looking for you in your presence"

258
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:27,334
"Love is like the skies"

259
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,084
"It goes beyond the physical"

260
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:37,935
"Your love keeps me mesmerized"

261
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,675
"As the stars tumble
and sparkle in my eyes"

262
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:51,912
"Distance fades as your
touch caresses my soul"

263
00:14:56,305 --> 00:15:02,304
"A moment when love comes
calling out of the blue"

264
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:09,403
"You're a companion who
crossed my path of oblivion"

265
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,249
"I can't speak my heart"

266
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:22,292
"Your fascination keeps me bound"

267
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,400
"I can't admire you enough"

268
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,875
"Be the apple of my eye"

269
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:55,587
"Is this how love feels?"

270
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:58,584
"I hadn't realized until I fell for you"

271
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:06,084
"Is this how you're feeling as well?"

272
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,334
"Heart is pounding swiftly with time"

273
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,432
"I feel so restless and lost all the time"

274
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:26,125
"I can't get over this
enchantment of yours"

275
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:33,376
"I fall short of words to express"

276
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:40,000
"I'm looking for you in your presence"

277
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,917
"Love is like the skies"

278
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:47,643
"It goes beyond the physical"

279
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:54,417
"Your love keeps me mesmerized"

280
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,250
"As the stars tumble
and sparkle in my eyes"

281
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:08,292
"Distance fades as your
touch caresses my soul"

282
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,417
Have the sweet, dear.

283
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:21,443
-Hey, I suppose the interview went well.
-Yes.

284
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,021
Hi...

285
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,287
[chuckles]
Come sit, dear.

286
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,125
You know how interviews
go, brother-in-law.

287
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,440
-Abhi...
-Yes, uncle.

288
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,790
22nd and 25th of
this month are auspicious.

289
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,625
If you tell us which is
convenient to you we'll plan the rest.

290
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,245
-What do you say, brother-in-law?
-Absolutely.

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,667
I need to talk to Pooja
before we fix anything.

292
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,414
[chanting prayers]

293
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:53,750
All okay, Abhi?

294
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,375
Pooja,

295
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,167
Before we fix on things...

296
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,167
I need to tell you something.

297
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:02,542
What's that?

298
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,875
I was deeply in love with a girl.

299
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,167
I was in love with her.

300
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:11,375
Suryakantham.

301
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:40,917
"Suryakantham!"

302
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,625
"Suryakantham!"

303
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,000
"Suryakantham!"

304
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,417
"Suryakantham!"

305
00:18:56,296 --> 00:19:01,132
SURYAKANTHAM

306
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:02,409
[camera captures]

307
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:10,259
[camera captures]

308
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,653
[camera captures]
Shucks! Are you done?

309
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:13,719
[chuckles]

310
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,709
Come on, mom!
This photo shoot is a little too much.

311
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:20,834
Don't say that.
Do you know, how cute you look?

312
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,857
I've been waiting from many days,

313
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,782
to make you dress as your
grandma and click photos.

314
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,319
Just two more photos.
Please! Please! Please!

315
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,709
Wow! What an emotion, mom!

316
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,625
What a dialogue delivery and action...

317
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,000
Your Oscar's right here.

318
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,269
-Let me give it to you.
-Are you making fun of me?

319
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,784
Anyways, dressing up as
grandma doesn't make me your mom.

320
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:38,471
What did you say?

321
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,322
-Nothing. Go ahead.
-Thank you. Thank you.

322
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:43,959
Have you thought about marriage as well?

323
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,459
Marriage? Marriage? Marriage?

324
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:49,250
Mom, I'll run away if you
talk about marriage again.

325
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,209
Not with some guy.
I'll run away all alone.

326
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,709
What happened now?

327
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:55,500
How many times have I told
you? Marriage is not my thing.

328
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,192
Poor guy! I feel sorry for him.

329
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:01,375
Which guy?

330
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:02,606
My son-in-law.

331
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,945
-He has no idea about you.
-Shucks!

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,400
[sighs]

333
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:08,109
He ordered Gulab Jamun in
Swiggy and he is waiting.

334
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,209
Wait... we both will see you later.

335
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,811
I don't care what you do.
[phone rings]

336
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:13,562
[camera captures]
Just talk like that only.

337
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:16,763
A guy will come and leave
that Gulab Jamun and marry you.

338
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,292
Yeah, sure.

339
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:23,750
-Yeah. I just gave it and came.
-What? Are you here to marry me?

340
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:26,495
[laughing]

341
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,709
-Hello...
<i>-Hello?</i>

342
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,515
Hey! Where are you going?
You think I'm done yelling?

343
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,959
I'm still frustrated.

344
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,637
She shouldn't have called at this hour.

345
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,500
-Huh?
-And you shouldn't have laughed. Wait...

346
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,879
<i>Oh! Are you busy? I'll hang up.</i>

347
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,513
Shut up and tell me why you even called.

348
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,334
<i>We planned on meeting this evening.</i>

349
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:45,042
Yeah, I remember.
07:30 at our coffee shop.

350
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,579
I'll only take 10 minutes.
You better be on time.

351
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,709
<i>Alright then. I'll hang up.</i>

352
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,667
I'll hang up before you do.

353
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,292
What are you still doing here?

354
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,084
You asked me to wait, remember?

355
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,709
Does that mean you'll listen to me?

356
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,625
I'll ask you to clean the
roads. Will you do it for me?

357
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,084
Have you got nothing else to do?

358
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,709
Why not? I've got a lot to do.

359
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,750
Oh, really? Tell me one thing.

360
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:08,125
That's right. So you're jobless.

361
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:10,334
Unlike you, I've got a
lot to do. You leave.

362
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you still out there?

363
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,542
Err... No! I left.

364
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,084
What does Suryakantham want now?

365
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:25,334
Money? A new smart phone?

366
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,584
Tickets to another vacation?

367
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:30,085
Ah! What's this?

368
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,915
-Consider this my marriage, mom.
-Okay.

369
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,591
-Now this is my life.
-Huh!

370
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,084
Don't make it gloomy mom.

371
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,500
Let me live it my way.

372
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,954
Where do you spin all the logic from?
[chuckles]

373
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,407
Is this the coffee shop?
[cicadas chirping]

374
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,042
Why did I come here?

375
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,042
I wonder how she'll react seeing me.

376
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,625
I better put a cap on.

377
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,737
[humming]
I think it's her.

378
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:12,492
[gasps]

379
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,375
Want some coupons? Coupons?

380
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,946
Er... you would win car or bike...

381
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,381
-Why don't you take them?
-Hello, brother.

382
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,750
What are you doing here?

383
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,250
I'm distributing coupons.

384
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:55,917
I mean I needed to find a job, so...

385
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:58,875
Drop the act.
You sucked at it and exposed yourself.

386
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,708
Why are you wearing a
cap at night? Style, huh?

387
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,498
-No...
-Are you bald?

388
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:03,375
Hell, no!

389
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:08,292
Heroes in English films wear
caps to hide their identity, so...

390
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:11,483
Still, you know that the one who
is wearing cap is the hero, don't you?

391
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:13,625
Er... Yes.

392
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,875
Then don't you think the people
in the film don't get it?

393
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,167
So what?

394
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,750
You should not take those
cinematic things too seriously.

395
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,625
First tell me what
are you doing are here?

396
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,375
I'm also thinking the same.

397
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,625
Umm... I'm here to apologize
for laughing at you yesterday.

398
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,568
Are you here to apologize?
Or meet me in the name of an apology?

399
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,571
Oh. I guess that's why I'm here.

400
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,283
-Will you apologize or should I beg?
-Oh god! I'm so sorry.

401
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,219
What is this sorry
for? For earlier or now?

402
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,625
This is for now. It wasn't for earlier.

403
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,250
And the next sorry is for earlier.

404
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:43,250
Sorry?

405
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:44,375
Sorry.

406
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:46,661
Uff...
[phone rings]

407
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:49,203
-Hello.
<i>-I'll take another 10 minutes.</i>

408
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,805
Shame on you! Not just calling me,
you should be on time too.

409
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:53,250
<i>-Coming. Coming.</i>
-You're dead in my hands.

410
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,500
-I've got to be somewhere. I'll leave.
-Hey, wait! I didn't say a word.

411
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,542
-You come fast.
<i>-Okay. Okay.</i>

412
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,824
Actually... I was being cautious.

413
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,417
Cautiousness doesn't suit you

414
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,625
I know you've got nothing to do. Sit.

415
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:07,750
What are you looking at?

416
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:10,500
You think I stopped you to
pass time until my friend comes?

417
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:12,625
-Not at all.
-That is why I've made you sit.

418
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:14,753
Okay. Tell me.

419
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,125
What do you want me to say?

420
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,375
How do you know I'll be here at this time?

421
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:21,125
[chuckles]
A flash cut.

422
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,875
07:30 at our coffee shop.

423
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,125
-Oh, so you heard me.
-Yes.

424
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,628
You heard the time and place.

425
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,622
But how did you know it
was this coffee shop?

426
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:29,926
I didn't mention the name on the phone.

427
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,750
[chuckles]
Another flash cut.

428
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,625
I'll only take ten minutes...

429
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,125
Why did you play it thrice?

430
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,542
I wanted the hint to register.

431
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,375
This is the only coffee shop within
10 minutes radius of your house.

432
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,750
Hey, wow!

433
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:45,917
You don't have the courage to approach me.
But you get sneaky and follow me around.

434
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:48,000
You're smart in this area, I must admit.

435
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,875
Okay. Tell me about you.

436
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:52,917
My name is Abhi.

437
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm 26 years old.

438
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,843
I'm the topper of my college.
When I played football...

439
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:58,792
Hey Stop!

440
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,000
It reminds me of that ad, you know?

441
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:04,500
Umm... My name is Mukesh.
I chewed tobacco till an year ago.

442
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:07,417
You should sound interesting
when you're talking to a girl.

443
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,625
Start again.

444
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:09,875
I'll be good this time.

445
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:11,735
My name is Abhi.

446
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:12,749
-I am 26...
-Enough.

447
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:15,018
-There's no point in knowing more.
-What the...

448
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:16,930
Okay. My friend's here. You leave now.

449
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,625
Hi!

450
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:19,250
Who's this?

451
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,188
Some random guy distributing coupons.
Do you want some?

452
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,125
Hey, no.

453
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,320
She said no. Leave.

454
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:26,542
Can I know your name?

455
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,125
I mean... I want to get to know you.

456
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,373
Hmm!

457
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,625
If a Friday follows this
Thursday, we shall meet again. Go!

458
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,743
[cicadas chirping]

459
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:41,792
What a girl!

460
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,500
I feel the same uncle.

461
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,750
Uncle, what a girl she is...

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,167
Hey, I asked what kind of a girl she is.
She is crazy man.

463
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,792
Uncle...

464
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,792
That girl is interesting.

465
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,875
Does anyone yell on their first meet?

466
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,375
Girls are like YouTube thumbnails.

467
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,875
It reads 'This video will shock you'.

468
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:01,500
But there's nothing in it when opened.

469
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,375
This is similar too, so I am advising you,
shut your mouth and sit in home.

470
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,625
Uncle...

471
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,334
She sounded so good!

472
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:11,366
Every time she yelled at
me, it sounded like a song...

473
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:13,125
You've gone mad.

474
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,375
Even a flop film seems
good on the first day.

475
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:17,875
This is just the same.
Don't annoy me!

476
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,880
Uncle, her eyes...

477
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,500
-I said don't annoy me.
-Uncle you wait.

478
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:23,667
What's your problem?
Why don't you listen what he says?

479
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,128
Uncle, tell me. I'll listen.

480
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:28,428
Hey, it's better if you stay
away from such characters.

481
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,392
You feel like admiring a few girls.

482
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,750
And then you feel like
getting rid of a few.

483
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,292
She is of the second type.

484
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,042
You should let her go
but not bring her home.

485
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,375
Women did cause many wars in history.

486
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,250
But girls like her
cause catastrophes, man.

487
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Uncle, but I want to meet her again.

488
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,108
I want her to yell at me uncle.

489
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,542
Oh, damn! Don't annoy me.

490
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,125
Uncle, no listen to me.

491
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,769
Hey! Oh!

492
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:58,625
He's annoying me
again. I want to kill him!

493
00:26:58,773 --> 00:26:59,980
Wait. Uncle...

494
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:00,981
-I'll kill him!
-Hey!

495
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:02,475
-What follows a Thursday?
-Hey, leave me.

496
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:03,047
Friday.

497
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,542
She said she'd meet me, on Friday.

498
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,042
Looks like you'll choke me to death.
Please let go.

499
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:37,834
Is this your car?

500
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,709
I didn't really notice. Sorry.

501
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,334
What's this sorry for?
[vehicle starts]

502
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,834
I'm really sorry.

503
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,084
Hey! Someone is taking your car.

504
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,292
Did I say that was my car?

505
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:52,917
Why did I apologize then?

506
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,542
-Because you've got no brain.
-Ah-ha!

507
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:55,792
Okay, I have to go. Bye.

508
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:56,709
Excuse me...

509
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,417
You said we'd meet again.

510
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,917
-We did meet, right?
-Then... I'll drop you.

511
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,084
-I'll walk home.
-Then I'll give you company.

512
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,167
Okay.

513
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:08,167
Come on, start.

514
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:09,167
What?

515
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:14,292
Umm... You will ask unnecessary questions
just for the sake of talking right?

516
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:16,917
Do you have a boyfriend?

517
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,406
I'm so happy and that
says I don't have one.

518
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:19,908
Yes!

519
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:22,417
What's your name?

520
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:23,834
What will you do knowing my name?

521
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:26,121
-Will you name your kids after me?
-What the...

522
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:27,965
I mean...

523
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,834
I need to know what to call you.

524
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,390
Call me whatever you want. I'll respond.

525
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,292

That was a bad joke. Forget it.

It doesn't matter who's asking.

590
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,834
Is there some rule stating
I should get married at 25?

591
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,917
Am I going to be locked
up for staying unmarried?

-Trying to preach me the rule of 25?

25 years back I too was 25!

00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:08,251
Oh no! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

701
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:10,126
Why are you supporting them?

702
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,501
They teased you and I hit them.
You should be supporting me, right?

703
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,417
You should tease them
back when they teased me.

704
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,542
Why did you hit them?

705
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,834
Anyway, they didn't harm me.

706
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,642
-I was just checking how you'd react.
-Huh!

707
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:25,508
[groans]

708
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:33,126
Hey! Do I look like a joker to you?

709
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:35,376
Or do you think life's a reality show?

710
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:37,667
Creating situations
and capturing reactions.

711
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,751
-Oh god!
-I didn't expect you to react this way.

712
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,001
How else do you expect me to react?

713
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:45,507
When someone messes with
the people I love and care for...

714
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:46,656
This is how I react.

715
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:48,959
Don't repeat this again, okay?

716
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:51,501
What? Okay or not?

717
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:52,792
What okay?

718
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,292
You just proposed to me indirectly. Idiot!

719
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,751
I'm being direct now.

720
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,682
-I love you.
-I'll kill you. Huh!

721
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:02,391
<i>Auto...</i>

722
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:05,413
-What? Aren't you going to answer me?
-Shucks!

723
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:07,079
I'll tell you tomorrow.

724
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,792
Okay. Where shall we meet?

725
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,251
There where the
destiny brings us together.

726
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:15,351
I didn't see her for
another 6 days after that.

727
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,542
I didn't know what to do.

728
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:20,582
[phone rings]

729
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:25,584
I'd assume every
unknown call was from her.

730
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,917
Then, what happened next?

731
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,512
[door creaks]

732
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,334
Err... Aunty, hello.

733
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:39,876
Her name...

734
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,834
Aunty, that girl...

735
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:43,334
Abhi?

736
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:44,751
Yes, aunty.

737
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:46,792
Come in.

738
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,967
-So she didn't even tell you her name?
-Yes.

739
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:02,107
It's Suryakantham.

740
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,042
-It is my mother's name.
-Suryakantham?

741
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,647
Is she home, aunty?

742
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:10,584
-Shucks! No, she isn't available.
-Where did she go?

743
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,542
No idea. I wish I knew.

744
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,417
Come on, aunty!
Where would she go without telling you?

745
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,876
She meets me one day
and disappears the next.

746
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:20,660
I have no idea where she'll show up again.
[laughing]

747
00:39:20,888 --> 00:39:23,334
She's literally crazy, aunty.
She's messing with my mind.

748
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,001
Are you drunk?

749
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:27,209
I was frustrated...

750
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,042
Kantham is unlike any other girl.

751
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:35,542
She can't be understood so easily.

752
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:38,292
She only does what her heart wants.

753
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,334
She doesn't change for anyone.

754
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,709
She doesn't want anyone
to change for her either.

755
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,751
She puts herself above anyone else.

756
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,876
The place we stay at the most is home.

757
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,834
A home isn't just four walls.

758
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,700
It's a place where mom
and dad live happily.

759
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:02,084
Her dad and I couldn't
give that space for her.

760
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:05,793
Ours was a love marriage.

761
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:08,667
We believed we were in
love and got married.

762
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:11,126
By the time she was born,

763
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:15,167
slowly we realized we
were totally different.

764
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:18,173
We would yell and get
physical for every damn thing.

765
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:24,522
We could stop our fights
in the name of divorce but...

766
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:28,709
the damage caused to
her was beyond repair.

767
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:30,751
She has become a completely new person.

768
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,792
She's simply can't stay put at a place

769
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,417
She doesn't trust people easily.

770
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,876
She lost her belief in a relationship.

771
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,376
She comes home when she feels like it.

772
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,178
Leaves home when she's disturbed.

773
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,889
I'm the reason she is coming back home...

774
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,961
[sobbing]
But when I am gone...

775
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,376
I'm worried about her.

776
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:05,251
No matter how long she's
home, I can't have enough of her.

777
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,626
She doesn't even stay home for long.

778
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:13,292
That is why I capture
her in these photographs.

779
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:16,042
When she's not home...

780
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,934
These pictures are my company.

781
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,421
The reason I'm telling you this is...

782
00:41:24,595 --> 00:41:27,764
After her friend Meera,
you're the only person she spoke of.

783
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:29,312
I think she likes you.

784
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:30,662
I don't know why.

785
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,724
Every time she talks about you,

786
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:35,804
there's a spark in her eyes.

787
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:37,389
A brightness.

788
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:40,292
Will you promise me something?

789
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,084
Tell me, aunty.

790
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:45,709
I don't know how your
relationship is going to evolve.

791
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:49,225
But I can't live forever.

792
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,381
When I'm gone,

793
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:53,793
will you be her person to go home to?

794
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,167
Will you give her a
happy place called home?

795
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:00,417
Sure, aunty.

796
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,202
[chuckles]

797
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:22,834
Hi.

798
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:29,334
I'll get it.

799
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,250
What are you doing here?
Did you go to my place?

800
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,086
-She told everything?
-Yeah.

801
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,959
How was the journey, Kantham?

802
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:39,667
Ah! I can't blame you
but I've to blame my mom.

803
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,750
Okay. Why did you come today?

804
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,825
It's my wish. My trip is over
and I came back. What wrong?

805
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:46,917
-I know why you came back.
-Alright. Whatever.

806
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,084
You're back to surprise
me on my birthday, right?

807
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,084
I really didn't know, if I
knew, I would've never come.

808
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,909
-Maybe this is what called destiny.
-Yeah, right. Destiny brought you here.

809
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,000
-No. No.
-Yes.

810
00:42:56,455 --> 00:42:58,584
Alright. Anyway, I'm here now. Take this.

811
00:42:58,746 --> 00:42:59,750
Get my bag.

812
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,026
Come to club in the evening,

813
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,672
party is mine but you have
to pay the bill. Okay?

814
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,989
[crowd cheering]

815
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,078
[crowd cheering]

816
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,167
"Welcome everybody!"

817
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,875
"We welcome all the teens to 2019"

818
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:27,542
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

819
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:31,125
"Go crazy. Just go crazy"

820
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,917
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

821
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,417
"Go boozy. Just go hazy."

822
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,614
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

823
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:46,048
"Let's dance and have some shots."

824
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,959
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

825
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:55,090
"Let's touch the horizon of skies"

826
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:08,692
"Hey, baby! Go crazy."

827
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:10,583
"Hey, baby!"

828
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:15,334
"Let's erase all the data on our minds"

829
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:18,834
"Let's groove like it's
the end of the world"

830
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,875
"As you do a bottoms up,
rediscover yourself"

831
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:26,584
"You must be suffocating,
Open the windows of your soul"

832
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:30,292
"Dance hard and make the floor sweat"

833
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:33,959
"Let's halt time like
it's the happy hours"

834
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,667
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

835
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,917
"Go crazy. Just go crazy"

836
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,146
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

837
00:44:45,564 --> 00:44:48,637
"Go boozy. Just go hazy"

838
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:52,784
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

839
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:56,106
"Let's dance and have some shots"

840
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:59,958
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

841
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:03,561
"Let's touch the horizon of skies"

842
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,542
"Hey, baby! Go crazy"

843
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:10,125
"Hey, baby!"

844
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,375
"Come on and drink to your taste"

845
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:18,042
"Don't rush it because we have all night"

846
00:45:18,653 --> 00:45:21,917
"Don't drink and drive.
Call your driver instead"

847
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:25,625
"You can booze and smile at the bar"

848
00:45:25,997 --> 00:45:29,459
"You've got Uber and Ola,
Don't welcome chaos"

849
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:32,959
"Let's make clouds of smoke,
Let's have it raining over us"

850
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:36,750
"Let's prove Darwin's formula wrong
for every shot"

851
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,417
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

852
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:43,750
"Go crazy. Just go crazy"

853
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:47,958
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

854
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:51,399
"Go boozy. Just go hazy"

855
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:55,515
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

856
00:45:55,737 --> 00:45:58,694
"Let's dance and have some shots"

857
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,726
"Friday night baby!
Party night baby!"

858
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:06,446
"Let's touch the horizon of skies"

859
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:15,650
I want an answer.

860
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,250
Short answer or long answer?

861
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:20,667
I mean... I want clarity on
the last night's happening, Kantham.

862
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:22,608
Turn a news channel on.

863
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,590
-You'll get a lot of clarity.
-Shucks! Kantham, I'm serious.

864
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,500
Okay, Abhi. Let me explain.

865
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,417
You've never restricted me until now.
That is why I think you're cute.

866
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,750
In a relationship, we need to
change according to the other person.

867
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:35,959
I'll not change or ask
you to change yourself.

868
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:38,500
In simple words, I'm like tsunami.

869
00:46:38,703 --> 00:46:40,834
Even I'm not sure when,
how and why I'll show up.

870
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:42,252
As far as I know...

871
00:46:42,452 --> 00:46:44,972
You have no problem with love or marriage.

872

It's one crazy ritual.

I know, it's a crazy ritual. I'm the
only one that's required to stay pure.

1012
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,771
-Me alone.
-Okay, I got it.

You don't have to repeat it so many times.

1014

How long is this ritual going to last?

1015

The bottle dropped and made it's noise

1033

He smoked a cigarette and
coughed, that's okay too.

1034
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:11,765
But how come the plates clanked?

1035

-Uncle.
-Yes?

-Mom...

Damn!

1039
00:59:22,374 --> 00:59:24,386
That means are you
going to ruin this as well?

1040
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:26,607
Are you going to sit
here, looking all gloomy?

1041
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:29,203
Are you going to marry her,

back at this point of time?

00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:53,290
and lots of gold to Pooja.
Out of daughter-in-law sentiment.

1051
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,573
[sobbing]

1052
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,876
Your mom's giving such a lengthy dialogue.

1053
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:00,900
Why don't I see an
expression on your face?

1054
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:02,444
"Great actress!"

1055
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:05,084
-Mom, it's going to be okay. Calm down.
-You don't talk.

1056
01:00:06,276 --> 01:00:08,497
Tell me this.
Does Pooja know about Kantham?

1057
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:09,454
She knows.

1058
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:13,220
-Does Kantham know about Pooja?
-No.

1059
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:13,782
Oh!

1060
01:00:14,452 --> 01:00:16,172
-Does Pooja know Kantham's here?
-No.

1061
01:00:16,372 --> 01:00:17,274
Oh!

1062
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:20,266
Does Kantham know you
two are getting married?

1063
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:21,277
Don't know.

1064
01:00:21,757 --> 01:00:22,754
Do you know how Kantham's
going to react if she found out?

1065
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:23,450
Don't know.

1066
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,828
Do you know how Pooja's
going to react to this?

1067
01:00:25,868 --> 01:00:26,593
Don't know.

1068
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,160
Do you at least know
what you have to do now?

1069
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:30,928
Don't know.

1070
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,265
Do you have any idea
what you're supposed to do?

1071
01:00:32,465 --> 01:00:33,437
-Me?
-Yes.

1072
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:34,407
I don't know.

1073
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:35,429
Okay...

1074
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:36,505
Say something uncle.

1075
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,780
How will I have an idea when you don't?

1076
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,010
Why did you ask so many
questions when you don't know it?

1077
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:42,397
I asked for the same reason you did for.

1078
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,030
Oh!

1079
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:47,263
"What you're left with at last"

1080
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:55,353
Bro, do you have a cigarette?

1081
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,317
People usually ask for a matchbox.

1082
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:00,149
Why are you asking for a cigarette?

1083
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:02,131
-Please, bro.
-I don't have it.

1084
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:03,741
Give me money then. I'll buy one.

1085
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:07,544
Who the hell are you?

1086
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:09,625
Bro, if you buy me a cigarette...

1087
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:12,478
-I'll be your friend from today.
-I don't need a friend. Get lost!

1088
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:14,371
[vehicle honks]
But I need a cigarette bro.

1089
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:18,282
Hey! I'm really tensed.

1090
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:20,493
I'll kill you if you don't
get the hell out of here.

1091
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,368
Are you tensed, bro?

1092
01:01:21,993 --> 01:01:24,645
Come with me.
Have a cigarette and you'll feel better.

1093
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,158
-You, rascal!
-What happened bro?

1094
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,359
-Did you drop any money?
-Wait there.

1095
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,218
Abhi!

1096
01:01:32,785 --> 01:01:33,966
Have you been waiting for long?

1097
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,787
Sorry. There was a lot
of traffic. Let's go.

1098
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,927
[indistinctive chatter]
Excuse me, brother.

1099
01:01:42,185 --> 01:01:43,147
Show me that dress, please.

1100
01:01:46,026 --> 01:01:46,633
The other one as well.

1101
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:50,361
[indistinctive chatter]

1102
01:01:50,461 --> 01:01:52,304
Abhi, did you eat anything?

1103
01:01:52,598 --> 01:01:53,750
You're comfortable, right?

1104
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,055
Excuse me.
Can you get us some juice, please?

1105
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,467
[indistinctive chatter]

1106
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:00,657
How does this colour look on me?

1107
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:02,208
It's really good.

1108
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,388
[phone rings]

1109
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,640
Did she have to call now?

1110
01:02:14,286 --> 01:02:15,981
Let's buy matching colours then.

1111
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,446
[phone rings]

1112
01:02:21,768 --> 01:02:23,493
-Hello.
-Ugh! Abhi.

1113
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:25,049
How many times do I have to call you?

1114
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:27,176
I was in a meeting.

1115
01:02:27,296 --> 01:02:30,548
Whatever. I'm really bored.
I'm on my way to meet you.

1116
01:02:30,756 --> 01:02:31,865
Text me the place, okay?

1117
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,131
Do we have to meet now?

1118
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:37,297
Don't ask me that.
I'm already halfway there.

1119
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:38,285
Tell me where to come.

1120
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,546
Err... Let's meet in KBR park.

1121
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:41,756
I'll come pick you up.

1122
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,361
Alright then. Bye.

1123
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:46,561
Abhi...

1124
01:02:47,105 --> 01:02:47,599
I'm done.

1125
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:49,241
Shall we go shop for you?

1126
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,902
I just received a call from work.
[vehicle honks]

1127
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,246
I need to submit some papers.

1128
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,039
So, I'll take some time.

1129
01:02:58,128 --> 01:02:59,007
Abhi.

1130
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:01,851
-Abhi, everything's okay, right?
-Yeah, absolutely.

1131
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:03,362
Bye.
[sighs]

1132
01:03:03,582 --> 01:03:04,391
See you.

[vehicles honking]

1134
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:09,621
Hi!

1135
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:11,406
You can't ask me to come out of the blue.

1136
01:03:11,606 --> 01:03:13,348
I was shopping for my engagement.

1137
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:14,949
Engagement shopping?
Who's getting engaged?

1138
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:16,588
My friend.

1139
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:17,307
Which friend?

1140
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:18,531
Some friend.

1141
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:20,360
I know all your friends. Which one is it?

1142
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:22,879
-He's not a friend. He's my uncle.
-Hey! Say it clearly.

1143
01:03:23,013 --> 01:03:23,813
Be clear. Is it your friend or uncle?

1144
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,741
Uncle who's like my friend.
Friend who's like my uncle.

1145
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:27,401
It's my uncle.

1146
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:29,522
Your uncle is getting engaged?
Why didn't you tell me?

1147
01:03:30,075 --> 01:03:31,024
Where is he now?
[sighs]

1148
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:33,966
-He's not here.
-What are you doing here without him?

1149
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:36,069
I came to shop for him.

1150
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:38,171
-Okay. Let's shop together. Come on.
-No, Kantham.

1151
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:39,480
-Listen to me.
-Come on, Abhi.

1152
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,361
[chuckles]

1153
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,744
-Buy a few shirts for yourself.
-Okay...

1154
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:51,735
Excuse me.

1155
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,443
Excused!

1156
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:54,901
What are you doing here?

1157
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,446
-I just had a cigarette.
-Who gave it to you?

1158
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:00,230
Why do you care about his cigarette?

1159
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:00,914
That is...

1160
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:02,337
When you don't have the
heart to give me a cigarette...

1161
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:04,195
You also don't have the
right to ask me about it.

1162
01:04:04,496 --> 01:04:05,222
-Hey!
-What?

1163
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:07,041
Sir understood it madam.

1164
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:10,438
Shut the hell up and show
me a nice shirt in purple.

1165
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,929
-Why purple?
-Pooja loves purple. It suits her.

1166
01:04:13,195 --> 01:04:14,331
-Who's Pooja?
-Ah!

1167
01:04:19,046 --> 01:04:19,526
Fiance.

1168
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,104
Oh. Your uncle's fiance, huh?

1169
01:04:22,304 --> 01:04:23,152
I hate my life!

1170
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:24,811
Something like that.

1171
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:26,496
Something like that?

1172
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,251
Isn't the engagement confirmed yet?

1173
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:31,270
Or do you lack clarity?

1174
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:32,681
Why do you even care?

1175
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:35,686
I feel it's better to have some clarity.

1176
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:37,979
We're pretty clear.
First show us a nice matching shirt.

1177
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:40,750
Why do you want a matching
shirt like it's some uniform?

1178
01:04:41,037 --> 01:04:43,141
-Show something in contrast.
-No! No! No!

1179
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,411
Why are you so tensed?

1180
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:48,096
Uncle wanted a matching shirt, so...

1181
01:04:48,576 --> 01:04:51,216
Forget him. He would've been long
married if he had a sense of fashion.

1182
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:53,728
Why isn't he present for
his engagement shopping?

1183
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:54,902
-I don't know.
-Who are you talking about?

1184
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:56,689
Uncle...

1185
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:57,661
You?

1186
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,313
-What are you doing here uncle?
-I came to watch a movie.

1187
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:02,135
I came here because it was bad.

1188
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:03,595
-I'm done for
-Are you out of your mind?

1189
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,886
Poor thing,
he's really tensed about the engagement.

1190
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:07,519
But you're roaming around in the mall.

1191
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,097
Did he tell you about the engagement?

1192
01:05:09,277 --> 01:05:11,225
Hey! Bloody mosquito!

1193
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,133
Didn't you feel like telling me about it?

1194
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,256
Why do I publicise other's news?

1195
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:17,098
Huh! Something's wrong.

1196
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:19,269
You haven't had a cigarette for so long.

1197
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:19,894
-What?
-Come here.

1198
01:05:20,094 --> 01:05:21,928
Show me your hand. Here you go. Go out.

1199
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:23,925
-Get lost!
-Thank you. Excuse me.

1200
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,943
Hey, hold on a minute.
Why do you need 500 bucks for a cigarette?

1201
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:27,646
Take this. Go!

1202
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:29,880
Where were you all these days?

1203
01:05:30,184 --> 01:05:31,169
-Do you know one thing?
-Yes, uncle...

1204
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,134
Don't just stand here,
apologize to Kantham.

1205
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,026
-Yes.
-Why do I have to apologize?

1206
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:36,215
Why should I apologize
about the engagement?

1207
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:38,547
You should apologize because
the engagement is fixed.

1208
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:40,882
You didn't tell me you
were getting engaged.

1209
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:42,276
-Apologize for that.
-Point!

1210
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:46,801
Sorry.

1211
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:47,860
Shucks! One more time.

1212
01:05:49,769 --> 01:05:51,430
-I'm extremely sorry.
-Excused uncle!

1213
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:55,585
-Come. Let's go buy shirts.
-Are the shirts for me?

1214
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:57,944
You're getting engagement.
Of course the shirts are for you.

1215
01:05:58,469 --> 01:05:59,354
-Kantham,
-Yes?

1216
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:00,570
act like you know shit though you don't.

1217
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:01,714
I'll act like I don't
know shit though I do.

1218
01:06:02,235 --> 01:06:02,776
What?

1219
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:04,943
It's my engagement after all.
I'm pretty tensed.

1220
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,311
Kantham, I have a small work at office.

1221
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:13,081
Now that uncle's here, go home with him.

1222
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,086
-I'll talk to you tonight, okay?
-Er...

1223
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:19,098
Actually, can you come to Meera's
place tonight? I need to talk to you.

1224
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:20,351
Okay. Done.

1225
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,253
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1226
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:24,044
-Love you.
-Love you too.

1227
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,521
How does it look?
I'll wear this suit at my engagement.

1228
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,280
[phone beeps]
[indistinctive voices]

1229
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,413
Hello, Pooja. Where are you?

1230
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:34,842
<i>Where are you, Abhi?</i>

1231
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,456
<i>Do you know how many times I called you?</i>

1232
01:06:37,055 --> 01:06:38,144
<i>Why is your phone not reachable?</i>

1233
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:40,888
Err... I'm just done with my work.

1234
01:06:41,321 --> 01:06:44,067
I don't have good reception here.
I'm at my office. I'm on my way.

1235
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:46,181
<i>I'm right at your office.</i>

1236
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,468
You were on a leave the whole week.

1237
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,593
What was so important that you lied to me?

1238
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:01,301
Pooja, actually... Err...

1239
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:02,426
Abhi...

1240
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,885
I hate situations like these.

1241
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:09,218
Feeling guilty and lying
to me about things...

1242
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:12,218
You're not behaving normal at all.

1243
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:14,718
Something's bothering you.

1244
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:16,801
And you're hiding it from me.

1245
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,176
Tell me! Tell me right now!

1246
01:07:20,343 --> 01:07:21,510
Actually...

1247
01:07:26,926 --> 01:07:28,260
Suryakantham is back.

1248
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:35,676
When did she come?

1249
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,801
3 days back.

1250
01:07:38,093 --> 01:07:40,301
What's there in this to hide?

1251
01:07:40,843 --> 01:07:43,593
I was afraid about how you'd react.

1252
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,510
This is nothing to worry about, Abhi.

1253
01:07:47,218 --> 01:07:48,301
She's back.

1254
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:49,968
So what?

1255
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,260
Look, Abhi.

1256
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,468
You don't have to hide things from me.

1257
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:59,593
Get all stressed about
it and live with guilt.

1258
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,593
Whatever it is,
I want you to be transparent with me.

1259
01:08:02,676 --> 01:08:04,760
No matter what,
we'll deal with it together.

1260
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,221
You took so much stressed
about this, these many days?

1261
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:21,968
You're crazy!

1262
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:25,510
Where is she now?

1263
01:08:25,843 --> 01:08:29,742
Let's meet up once,
I want to meet your first crush.

1264
01:08:29,974 --> 01:08:31,441
[chuckles]

1265
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:43,584
Hi.

1266
01:08:57,035 --> 01:08:58,121
Want some pizza?

1267
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:01,285
Isn't Meera home?

1268
01:09:01,868 --> 01:09:03,701
Actually, she had to be somewhere.

1269
01:09:03,785 --> 01:09:05,035
I think she'll join us.

1270
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:06,660
Oh. Okay.

1271
01:09:09,564 --> 01:09:13,960
[music mutes voice]

1272
01:09:18,576 --> 01:09:20,868
It's really nice, Abhi.
Being here with you.

1273
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,910
I really missed you, man.

1274
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:29,487
[cicadas chirping]

1275
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:32,743
-Actually, I want to tell you something.
-Actually, I want to tell you something.

1276
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:38,493
I never thought I'd do this in my life.

1277
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:52,035
I love you, Abhi.

1278
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:01,683
[pukes]

1279
01:10:02,785 --> 01:10:03,891
Abhi!

1280
01:10:04,624 --> 01:10:07,420
[cicadas chirping]

1281
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:12,839
[pukes]
[dog barking]

1282
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:16,993
Are you okay?

1283
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:26,576
Don't tell me I'm the
mother of your child.

1284
01:10:26,776 --> 01:10:28,755
[laughing]

1285
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:31,368
My marriage is fixed, Kantham.

1286
01:10:36,368 --> 01:10:38,035
I'm getting engaged in 2 days.

1287
01:10:40,723 --> 01:10:42,493
I wasn't shopping for my uncle today.

1288
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:44,368
It was for me.

1289
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,910
Are you fine with this marriage?

1290
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:53,451
Why were you acting crazy about me then?

1291
01:10:53,576 --> 01:10:55,785
You said you like me.
You also said 'I love you'.

1292
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:58,701
How could you find
someone else when I was gone?

1293
01:10:59,076 --> 01:11:00,826
Is this your revenge?

1294
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,451
It's not like that, Kantham.
Actually, what happened was...

1295
01:11:03,576 --> 01:11:05,993
It's been a year since you were
gone. I didn't know what to do.

1296
01:11:12,326 --> 01:11:13,743
Look how red you've turned.

1297
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:20,285
I already know about your engagement.

1298
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:24,493
I was just kidding
around to see your reaction.

1299
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:35,448
Are you okay with this?

1300
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,896
Am I? Shucks!

1301
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:43,118
I'm so happy for you, Abhi.
Congratulations!

1302
01:11:45,618 --> 01:11:46,535
Who's the girl?

1303
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,201
-Her name...
-Do you have her photo?

1304
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,701
-Photo? Give me a minute.
-Shucks! I'll look at it later.

1305
01:11:51,868 --> 01:11:53,201
Actually, Abhi... Can you go?

1306
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:54,618
What's wrong?

1307
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:56,951
Girl things. You won't get it. Leave.

1308
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:08,901
Kantham...

1309
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,826
-Pooja wants to meet you once.
-I'll meet her, Abhi.

1310
01:12:23,854 --> 01:12:24,742
[vehicle honks]

1311
01:12:32,243 --> 01:12:34,076
A beer is supposed to be chilled, man.

1312
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:37,201
Hey!

1313
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,201
Hey, what's up with the sudden meeting?

1314
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:43,951
Umm... What do you want?

1315
01:12:44,035 --> 01:12:45,618
Beer, Rum or Whiskey?

1316
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:48,951
Would you like a breezer?
Typical girl drink.

1317
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:51,664
Is Pooja your fiance?
[laughing]

1318
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,701
Pooja and I are in love since 2 years.

1319
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,785
We're in a serious live-in
relationship since 3 years.

1320
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:59,277
[slap]
Hmm...

1321
01:13:00,993 --> 01:13:02,326
Pick one of these two.

1322
01:13:03,785 --> 01:13:05,326
Do you have to come
all the way for this?

1323
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:08,201
You should've asked me
to pick over Whatsapp.

1324
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,493
I wouldn't have hit you
if you picked this finger.

1325
01:13:11,618 --> 01:13:13,035
So are you going to beat me again?

1326
01:13:14,408 --> 01:13:16,910
Oh god! I get it.

1327
01:13:17,368 --> 01:13:19,785
I'm facing the
consequences for Abhi's lie.

1328
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,868
Why didn't you tell me about Pooja?

1329
01:13:21,951 --> 01:13:23,243
It's not good manners.

1330
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,951
This isn't good manners too.

1331
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,631
[sighs]

1332
01:13:36,326 --> 01:13:37,368
Abhi said,

1333
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:39,451
'She's my fiance.'

1334
01:13:39,951 --> 01:13:40,951
That means...

1335
01:13:41,368 --> 01:13:42,701
She is going to be his wife.

1336
01:13:43,493 --> 01:13:44,785
That's what he asked me to tell you.

1337
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:48,910
Hey, stop!
It's my cheek and not a drum to smack.

1338
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,035
Hey, Kantham!

1339
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:51,076
That's enough.

1340
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,743
Tell me. How does Pooja look?

1341
01:13:53,743 --> 01:13:55,660
Hey! She doesn't even look like a girl.

1342
01:13:55,826 --> 01:13:58,785
She's heavier and dark skinned than
me. On the whole, she looks like crap.

1343
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,410
I still don't get how
Abhi said okay to her.

1344
01:14:03,326 --> 01:14:05,201
Oh... I get it.

1345
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,118
She's taller than you.

1346
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:11,035
Has a much fairer
complexion. And she has long hair.

1347
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:12,701
But she doesn't go to bars like you.

1348
01:14:16,817 --> 01:14:18,153
[sighs]
Shucks!

1349
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:20,785
I'm sorry uncle.

1350
01:14:21,576 --> 01:14:23,951
You tell me who's right
for Abhi. Me or Pooja?

1351
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,295
Hey! Shucks!

1352
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:27,660
He's supposed to
decide who's right for him.

1353
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,743
How can I?

1354
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:32,326
He's getting engaged
because he already decided.

1355
01:14:32,743 --> 01:14:33,618
Hey, no!

1356
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,326
He's only engaged. He's not married yet.
[metal pipe clinks]

1357
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:38,701
It's not too late now.
We still have a chance.

1358
01:14:38,785 --> 01:14:39,868
We can proceed.

1359
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:41,660
Pick one finger.

1360
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:44,285
You hit me already. You don't have to
show me the finger now. Just hit me.

1361
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,535
-This is for a different reason.
-What's that?

1362
01:14:45,618 --> 01:14:46,910
Who's better amongst us two?

1363
01:14:47,326 --> 01:14:48,743
You, of course.

1364
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:50,493
Yes! I knew it.

1365
01:14:51,035 --> 01:14:52,576
This is Pooja and this is me.

1366
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:54,660
I'm perfect for Abhi. Bye!

1367
01:14:55,868 --> 01:14:57,451
You'd hit me no matter what I pick.

1368
01:15:18,326 --> 01:15:19,243
Hi.

1369
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:20,951
Suryakantham, huh?

1370
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:23,535
Pooja, this is Suryakantham.
Suryakantham, this is Pooja.

1371
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:24,951
Hi.

1372
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,201
Hi, Kantham.

1373
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,576
You can call me Suryakantham.

1374
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,701
Come on!

1375
01:15:31,785 --> 01:15:33,785
We don't have to be so formal.

1376
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:34,993
Hmm.

1377
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,576
You look absolutely gorgeous.

1378
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:41,368
If I were a boy,
I would've been staring at you.

1379
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:43,660
I love the way you're dressed up.

1380
01:15:44,451 --> 01:15:45,493
Thank you.

1381
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:49,201
Where did you find Abhi?

1382
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:51,118
My family was looking for alliances.

1383
01:15:51,535 --> 01:15:54,039
I came across Abhi's photo one day.
[chuckles]

1384
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,066
I agreed right away.
[chuckles]

1385
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:57,618
What if you didn't come across the photo?

1386
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,410
I would've waited until I did.

1387
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:02,035
I had been waiting for a while.

1388
01:16:02,826 --> 01:16:04,743
Hmm. How come?

1389
01:16:06,118 --> 01:16:08,576
I loved him back during our school days.

1390
01:16:08,743 --> 01:16:10,160
He's my first crush.

1391
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:12,035
And my only crush.

1392
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:14,785
We went to the same school.

1393
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,826
I'm really happy that you're back.

1394
01:16:17,993 --> 01:16:19,618
I would think to myself sometimes.

1395
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,160
We'd feel complete if
you attend our wedding.

1396
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,410
I know you're really
important in Abhi's life.

1397
01:16:28,035 --> 01:16:29,368
Now that you're here...

1398
01:16:29,576 --> 01:16:31,326
And now that I noticed
your dressing sense...

1399
01:16:31,618 --> 01:16:33,326
I'm giving you a responsibility.

1400
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,160
Please help Abhi buy the engagement ring.

1401
01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:39,701
I'm very sure you'd make a good selection.

1402
01:16:39,993 --> 01:16:40,743
Me?

1403
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:41,576
Yeah.

1404
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:46,718
How is this ring?

1405
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:54,051
Is this good?

1406
01:16:54,474 --> 01:16:56,634
Does exchanging rings
mean you're committed?

1407
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,926
Exchanging rings
doesn't mean we're committed.

1408
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:02,426
But the rings are
reminders to our commitment.

1409
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:04,737
In that case,
you shouldn't be exchanging rings.

1410
01:17:04,974 --> 01:17:06,260
You lose them with a little soap.

1411
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,196
You should tattoo each
other's names instead.

1412
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:10,988
Let's do that for your wedding.
We are good with rings.

1413
01:17:11,188 --> 01:17:12,568
Shucks! Forget that. First tell me.

1414
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,883
-Is this good?
-No

1415
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:17,100
-How is this?
-No.

1416
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:18,926
This one?

1417
01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:20,884
-And this one?
-I like this one.

1418
01:17:21,084 --> 01:17:21,551
Hmm...

1419
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:24,922
It'll look great on a girl's
hand sir, try it on ma'am for once.

1420
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:36,718
This isn't right for you.

1421
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:38,218
Shucks! Why not?

1422
01:17:41,259 --> 01:17:42,134
Here you go.

1423
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:48,384
We like this.
Can you pack it for me, please?

1424
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:01,345
[laughing]

1425
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:05,885
-Ah?
-Oh-ho!

[indistinctive voices]

1432
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:23,676
What's the ring?

1433
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:25,835
Where's Kantham, mom?
[camera captures]

1434
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:28,384
Kantham!

1435
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,456
-Kantham!
-Kantham!

1436
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:33,499
Hmm!

1437
01:18:52,801 --> 01:18:53,968
Kantham!

1438
01:18:55,748 --> 01:18:56,884
You found out all the history, right?

1439
01:18:57,395 --> 01:18:58,718
Why is she acting like this?

1440
01:19:03,165 --> 01:19:05,509
Pooja, relax. I'll talk
to her. Please relax.

1441
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,343
Crazy girl! How could she
hide the ring? Give me that.

1442
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:11,801
Do you really want to
attend the engagement?

1443
01:19:13,828 --> 01:19:15,759
Is it going to stop if I don't?

1444
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:22,416
[balloons burst]
[applaud]

1445
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:10,689
Huh? What are you searching for?

1446
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:12,367
Hey, no Kantham...

1447
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:14,068
Shucks! No...

1448
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:15,413
Don't drink stop it.

1449
01:20:15,676 --> 01:20:16,691
[cough]
Give it to me.

1450
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,681
[cough]
Hey!

1451
01:20:21,004 --> 01:20:22,591
No, Kantham don't drink.

1452
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:24,944
Stop it. Listen to me...

1453
01:20:25,144 --> 01:20:27,903
Kantham, stop it please.

1454
01:20:28,438 --> 01:20:30,109
I am telling you to stop right?

1455
01:20:31,068 --> 01:20:32,612
It's enough please...

1456
01:20:45,778 --> 01:20:48,634
"My love's lost,
my luck has messed me up"

1457

"My love's lost,

"My life has been side tracked?"

1462
01:21:11,235 --> 01:21:14,051
"Entering my life as an innocent?"

1463
01:21:14,574 --> 01:21:17,539
"He had shown off pretty well"

1464
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:20,218
"He made me his ex now"

1465
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,301
"He changed his status to married"

1466
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:28,210
"Men are quite dangerous, they
ditch you by the time you fall for them"

1467
01:21:32,224 --> 01:21:34,968
"My life is one big mess"

1468
01:21:35,409 --> 01:21:38,218
"My life is one big mess"

01:21:38,631 --> 01:21:41,426
"My life is one big mess"

"My life is one big mess"

1471
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:19,593
"He followed me around
and flattered me"

1472
01:22:20,245 --> 01:22:22,718
"He left me drowning
in a pool of chaos"

1473
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:26,176
"He said I was his cute baby"

1474
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:29,134
"He left me hanging from a thread"

1475
01:22:29,854 --> 01:22:32,301
"A little space is all he asked for"

1476
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,634
"Wonder how he replaced me so easily?"

1477
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:38,801
"He said I didn't have
to take his surname?"

1478
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:41,759
"But it's not my name in his
wedding card anymore?"

ditch you by the time you fall for them"

[cicadas chirping]
Abhi!

1498
01:23:58,218 --> 01:23:59,426
Hey, Abhi!

1499
01:24:00,343 --> 01:24:01,593
-Abhi!
-Ah!

1500
01:24:02,593 --> 01:24:03,636
[panting]
Abhi!

1501
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:06,332
-Are you Abhi?
-Are you drunk?

1502
01:24:06,532 --> 01:24:07,799
[slaps]
Confirmed. You're drunk.

1503
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,735
-Abhi!
-Hey! Don't shout.

1504
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:10,830
[slaps]

1505
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:13,051
-Abhi! Abhi!
-You can take me aside and hit me.

1506
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:16,796
-I can't help that he's engaged...
-Call him here uncle.

1507
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:19,468
-Hi, Abhi.
-Buddy...

1508
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:21,926
She's drunk, man.
Handle her carefully.

[cicadas chirping]

1510
01:24:23,356 --> 01:24:24,426

Kantham, are you drunk?

1511
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:25,552
-Shh...
-Shucks!

1512
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:27,468
What's going on, Kantham?

1513
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,759
I'm in pain, Abhi. Pain!

1514
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:31,676
They call it 'Dard' in Hindi.

1515
01:24:31,926 --> 01:24:33,551
-I guess you're totally drunk.
-Shh... Shh...

1516
01:24:33,884 --> 01:24:35,968
Don't talk. Let me look.

1517
01:24:36,544 --> 01:24:40,509
You look like James Band...
sorry James Bond in this suit, you know?

1518
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:42,540
-Kantham!
-Hey!

1519
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:44,134
I asked you to stay quite right?

1520
01:24:46,134 --> 01:24:47,301
So this is it?

1521
01:24:47,468 --> 01:24:49,718
-Are you engaged officially?
-Shucks! Kantham.

1522
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,259
[cicadas chirping]

1523
01:24:52,847 --> 01:24:54,634
You'll not care about me anymore.

1524
01:24:55,009 --> 01:24:57,801
You'll be busy with
your life and your Pooja.

1525
01:25:00,134 --> 01:25:02,759
Abhi, remember the first time we met?

1526
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:04,134
In front of my house.

1527
01:25:04,752 --> 01:25:06,785
Blue shirt, torn jeans...

1528
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,136
[chuckles]

1529
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:11,426
Second time was at the coffee shop.

1530
01:25:12,051 --> 01:25:13,884
Black hoodie, black cap...

1531
01:25:14,384 --> 01:25:16,884
You were hiding from me. So cute!

1532
01:25:18,176 --> 01:25:20,343
I noticed the colour
of your eyes that day.

1533
01:25:20,884 --> 01:25:21,926
Brown!

1534
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:24,051
I don't know, Abhi.

1535
01:25:24,468 --> 01:25:26,468
Every minute spent with you...

1536
01:25:26,825 --> 01:25:28,343
I remember all of it in detail.

1537
01:25:28,968 --> 01:25:31,468
From the clothes you wore
and to the roads we explored.

1538
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:35,801
The coffee shops, weather,
your shoes, watch, perfume...

1539
01:25:35,884 --> 01:25:36,884
Everything!

1540
01:25:37,843 --> 01:25:41,718
But you're pretending like
there's nothing between us.

1541
01:25:42,134 --> 01:25:43,259
F***, man!

1542
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:48,134
Even I thought of pretending like you.

1543
01:25:49,301 --> 01:25:50,509
But I couldn't.

1544
01:25:51,384 --> 01:25:54,163
Did you get over me in a couple of months?
[cicadas chirping]

1545
01:25:54,363 --> 01:25:55,551
Or just few days?

1546
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,301
334 days!

1547
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:02,051
I can calculate the hours,
minutes, seconds and tell you.

1548
01:26:06,343 --> 01:26:09,468
Just like you remember
all our moments in detail...

1549
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:11,051
And with that...

1550
01:26:12,259 --> 01:26:16,301
I remember all my
moments of pain since you left.

1551
01:26:18,357 --> 01:26:19,384
I didn't know what to do.

1552
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:22,218
In the play area the other day...

1553
01:26:23,187 --> 01:26:24,384
I thought we had a moment.

1554
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:26,718
But you left the very next day.

1555
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:30,426
I waited for you like a mad person.

1556
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:34,093
I waited all day hoping you'd come.

1557
01:26:34,634 --> 01:26:36,176
And all night bearing the pain.

1558
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:42,081
Days flew by.
[chuckles]

1559
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:43,634
Like it's shown in the movies,

1560
01:26:43,845 --> 01:26:47,055
drinking and smoking, I tried them too.

1561
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,444
Huh! I don't know why.

1562
01:26:50,316 --> 01:26:53,364
But I felt a sense of
satisfaction when I hurt myself.

1563
01:26:57,328 --> 01:26:58,835
You should've seen my mom and dad.

1564
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,990
When I was suffering in pain,
they were going through hell.

1565
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:07,269
You should've waited for
me few more days, Abhi.

1566
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:11,222
If I had any hope of you coming back,

1567
01:27:12,706 --> 01:27:14,948
I would've waited a lifetime.
[sighs]

1568
01:27:16,395 --> 01:27:18,476
Have you ever done
anything to make me feel hopeful?

1569
01:27:18,713 --> 01:27:22,044
-Do you know why I left?
-Why are we even talking about this?

1570
01:27:24,842 --> 01:27:28,188
I can't take the fact that
you're not mine anymore, Abhi.

1571
01:27:29,335 --> 01:27:31,887
You won't be around, calling me Kantham.

1572
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:35,409
I can't see this spark in
your eyes after tonight.

1573
01:27:36,803 --> 01:27:38,505
Don't you belong to me anymore, Abhi?

1574
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,212
[cicadas chirping]
Don't you belong to me anymore?

1575
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:49,365
If Pooja hadn't come into your life...

1576
01:27:51,051 --> 01:27:53,381
If I had come back sooner...

1577
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:28,282
Abhi!

1578
01:28:29,401 --> 01:28:30,276
Abhi... Abhi... Abhi...

1579
01:28:30,898 --> 01:28:32,426
Wake up quickly.
I'm really hungry.

1580
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,460
Let's go. Please.

1581
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:35,087
Come.

1582
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:40,024
[radio playing]

1583
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:52,035
Abhi, I'm so sorry.

1584
01:28:52,323 --> 01:28:54,264
I was so drunk last night I
didn't know what I was saying.

1585
01:28:54,464 --> 01:28:55,581
Don't take it to your heart.

1586
01:28:55,901 --> 01:28:58,103
You two take these
tickets and go for a trip.

1587
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,980
If you take these,
it's like accepting my apology.

1588
01:29:01,297 --> 01:29:02,996
Think of it as a gift to your engagement.

1589
01:29:03,662 --> 01:29:04,766
Please take it.

1590
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:36,075
I'm very happy, Abhi.

1591
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,397
Thank you so much for the surprise!

1592
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:41,440
Pooja...

1593
01:29:42,272 --> 01:29:43,360
Can I ask you something?

1594
01:29:43,793 --> 01:29:44,754
Hmm. Sure.

1595
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,055
Are you comfortable with Kantham?

1596
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:50,611
Shucks! Abhi!

1597
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,926
No, Pooja. I'm serious. Please tell me.

1598
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,362
[birds chirping]
Okay, Abhi.

1599
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,080
I'll tell you something.
I'll only tell you once.

1600
01:30:02,543 --> 01:30:04,093
I don't want you to bring this up again.

1601
01:30:04,736 --> 01:30:07,258
No, Abhi.
I'm not comfortable with Suryakantham.

1602
01:30:09,395 --> 01:30:11,095
But because she's important to you...

1603
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:13,911
She's important to me as well.
[chuckles]

1604
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,543
Surprise!

1605
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:21,626
Hi! Hi!

1606
01:30:27,835 --> 01:30:29,628
Abhi, I'll just be back.

1607
01:30:32,921 --> 01:30:35,172
What?
You think I'm here for your birthday?

1608
01:30:37,025 --> 01:30:39,694
I just couldn't bear the
thought of you two being alone.

1609
01:30:40,705 --> 01:30:42,784
Anything can happen on
these holidays, you know.

1610
01:30:43,126 --> 01:30:44,699
-We didn't plan anything yet.
-Shut up!

1611
01:30:45,345 --> 01:30:46,376
I didn't mean it that way.

1612
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:50,115
You might fight,
have differences and part ways.

1613
01:30:50,275 --> 01:30:51,280
-What?
-Shucks!

1614
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:55,156
-Er... Kareena Kapoor.
-Okay.

1615
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:57,321
-Shahid Kapoor.
-Okay.

1616
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:58,335
Saif Ali Khan!

1617
01:30:58,668 --> 01:30:59,907
Oh god!
[laughing]

1618
01:30:59,999 --> 01:31:01,349
Tell me. What do you think?
[chuckles]

1619
01:31:01,585 --> 01:31:02,156
What?

1620
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,335
Are you sharing any secrets?

1621
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:06,215
Er... Secrets...

1622
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:09,511
You're here on a holiday, so...

1623
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:12,876
I can be the wedding photographer
and click some pictures for you guys.

1624
01:31:13,126 --> 01:31:15,001
-No. No. No.
-Huh?

1625
01:31:15,585 --> 01:31:16,789
Sounds good.
[chuckles]

1626
01:31:18,753 --> 01:31:24,688
[birds chirping]
[chuckles]

1627
01:31:25,793 --> 01:31:28,142
Happy birthday to you!

1628
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,582
To you!

1629
01:31:29,835 --> 01:31:32,313
Happy birthday to Abhi!

1630
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:39,879
Happy birthday!

1631
01:31:46,927 --> 01:31:47,935
Thanks for the surprise.

1632
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,918
Excuse me.

1633
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,172
-Abhi,
-Umm?

1634
01:31:52,267 --> 01:31:53,091
you have to taste this.

1635
01:31:59,028 --> 01:32:00,397
This is also yummy.
You have to taste this.

1636
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:05,869
Abhi!
[fork clinks]

1637
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:08,918
Er... I see a fly.

1638
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:13,626
Okay. I'll use another fork.

1639
01:32:14,251 --> 01:32:16,793
Abhi, I saw a fly in the bowl.

1640
01:32:17,001 --> 01:32:18,293
Not on the fork.

1641
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:21,501
That's okay.

1642
01:32:21,751 --> 01:32:23,126
I'll clean up and come.

1643
01:32:23,668 --> 01:32:24,691
Okay. Let me come with you.

1644
01:32:45,728 --> 01:32:49,045
"A part of my heart"

1645
01:32:50,074 --> 01:32:53,170
"Left me behind"

1646
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:57,736
"The rest of my heart"

1647
01:32:57,936 --> 01:33:01,356
"Doesn't listen to me at all"

1648
01:33:03,223 --> 01:33:07,409
"But heart"

1649
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:10,804
"Can't accept this fact"

1650
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:15,137
"It can't let go of memories"

1651
01:33:15,337 --> 01:33:19,027
"Doesn't it let go of him?"

1652
01:33:20,354 --> 01:33:23,566
"How do I get along..."

1653
01:33:24,195 --> 01:33:28,426
"...with this separation?"

1654
01:33:29,008 --> 01:33:32,479
"How will this agony of my heart..."

1655
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:36,978
"...leave me?"

1656
01:33:37,543 --> 01:33:41,751
"I'm not myself anymore,
I'm not with him anymore"

1657
01:33:42,139 --> 01:33:45,585
"Heart ceases to beat"

1658
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:50,460
"I see no wounds
but I'm perishing"

1659
01:33:50,668 --> 01:33:54,126
"Pain is killing me from within"

1660
01:33:56,876 --> 01:33:58,835
"It's breaking my heart"

1661
01:33:59,229 --> 01:34:00,918
"It's breaking my heart"

1662
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:04,668
"It's breaking my heart, my love"

1663
01:34:05,585 --> 01:34:07,543
"It's breaking my heart"

1664
01:34:07,793 --> 01:34:09,751
"It's breaking my heart"

1665
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,104
"It's breaking my heart, my love"

1666
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,618
Hey! What are you doing here all alone?

1667
01:34:45,202 --> 01:34:46,452
Let's play some game.

1668
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:48,297
Abhi, come.

1669
01:34:52,035 --> 01:34:53,827
So guys, these are the game rules.

1670
01:34:54,368 --> 01:34:57,243
Each one of us gets a shot glass.

1671
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:59,660
Whoever this empty
bottle stops pointing at...

1672
01:35:00,058 --> 01:35:02,577
...has to drink the
shot and choose truth or dare.

1673
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:04,028
Clear?

1674
01:35:04,618 --> 01:35:06,785
Is vodka a compulsion in this game?

1675
01:35:06,989 --> 01:35:09,535
Shucks! It helps with both truth and dare.

1676
01:35:09,785 --> 01:35:11,743
We're on a holiday anyway.

1677
01:35:12,809 --> 01:35:14,286
Come on, guys! Let's have some fun.

1678
01:35:16,558 --> 01:35:17,368
Okay.

1679
01:35:27,243 --> 01:35:28,243
Truth or dare?

1680
01:35:28,827 --> 01:35:29,561
Truth.

1681
01:35:30,882 --> 01:35:32,868
Tell me two things no one knows about you.

1682
01:35:33,828 --> 01:35:36,743
One, I smoke when I'm really stressed.

1683
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:40,160
Two, I put my arms and legs
on the person lying next to me.

1684
01:35:40,743 --> 01:35:42,035
I know these two things about you.

1685
01:35:43,452 --> 01:35:44,702
Only you know.

1686
01:35:44,902 --> 01:35:48,570
[cicadas chirping]

1687
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,993
Truth.

1688
01:35:57,327 --> 01:35:59,410
What's your favourite memory with me?

1689
01:36:01,077 --> 01:36:02,160
In the play area...

1690
01:36:02,535 --> 01:36:03,952
That's my favourite memory.

1691
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:14,895
Truth.

1692
01:36:15,868 --> 01:36:17,285
How many guys did you kiss?

1693
01:36:18,452 --> 01:36:19,493
Just one.

1694
01:36:19,868 --> 01:36:20,868
Only Abhi.

1695
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:27,493
Truth.

1696
01:36:28,202 --> 01:36:29,285
Your first kiss?

1697
01:36:29,577 --> 01:36:30,577
It was with you.

1698
01:36:35,493 --> 01:36:36,535
Let me ask.

1699
01:36:41,535 --> 01:36:42,243
Truth.

1700
01:36:42,368 --> 01:36:45,535
A secret between you
two which no one knows?

1701
01:36:46,729 --> 01:36:48,827
Not just one, Pooja. Let me tell you two.

1702
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:50,014
Since I returned,

1703
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:51,502
-I proposed to Abhi twice.
-Kantham!

1704
01:36:51,993 --> 01:36:54,243
And the reason I'm
here is to break you up.

1705
01:36:54,327 --> 01:36:55,743
-Abhi knows that too.
-Kantham!

1706
01:36:55,827 --> 01:36:58,160
Has he ever told you this in
your transparent relationship?

1707
01:36:58,465 --> 01:37:00,493
-Even this trip is olanned by me.
-Pooja can we...

1708
01:37:00,868 --> 01:37:01,702
Pooja!

1709
01:37:02,035 --> 01:37:03,452
Pooja, listen! Pooja.

1710
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,782
[door creaks]
Pooja, please listen to me once.

1711
01:37:12,549 --> 01:37:13,700
Is she telling the truth?

1712
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,285
Pooja, actually...

1713
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,702
First tell me if it's the truth or not.

1714
01:37:20,745 --> 01:37:24,057
[sobbing]
You hid things from me again.

1715
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,491
Pooja,
please give me one chance to explain.

1716
01:37:27,691 --> 01:37:29,505
There's nothing left to explain, Abhi.

1717
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:31,404
You're feeling guilty.

1718
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,984
And I'm feeling cheated.
Damn!

1719
01:37:34,202 --> 01:37:35,223
Shucks! Pooja!

1720
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:37,868
And knowing that she
came here to separate us...

1721
01:37:38,693 --> 01:37:40,710
...you still entertained her till now.

1722
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:42,065
No, Pooja.

1723
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,675
What were you thinking, Abhi?

1724
01:37:45,013 --> 01:37:46,111
Have you kept your options?

1725
01:37:46,924 --> 01:37:48,262
You wanted to choose?

1726
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,540
-Pooja, listen...
-Were we two choices to you?

1727
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,527
It's not like that.

1728
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:54,743
Do you get how this is making me feel?

1729
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:57,827
Pooja...

1730
01:37:58,452 --> 01:37:59,836
Don't talk to me.

1731
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,134
I'm not in a state to
understand anything you say.

1732
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:04,977
Please just leave me alone!

1733
01:38:05,673 --> 01:38:06,354
Pooja!

1734
01:38:10,803 --> 01:38:12,890
[glass breaks]

1735
01:38:20,836 --> 01:38:21,857
[glass breaks]

1736
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:29,621
[music]

1737
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,612
Pooja!

1738
01:38:51,836 --> 01:38:53,572
Pooja! Pooja!

1739
01:38:54,021 --> 01:38:55,125
Pooja!

1740
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,834
Bro, follow her. Follow her.

1741
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:35,256
Pooja! Pooja!

1742
01:39:36,029 --> 01:39:38,012
Pooja, what is this? Where are you going?

1743
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:40,568
Don't create a scene here, Abhi.

1744
01:39:41,855 --> 01:39:43,670
I'll yell at you if you
stay here for a while.

1745
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:46,159
[sobbing]
I can't stop crying.

1746
01:39:48,339 --> 01:39:51,799
I'm afraid I'll begin to hate you.

1747
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:54,759
I not liking myself like this, Abhi.

1748
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:57,185
Pooja, I know what I've done isn't right.

1749
01:39:57,385 --> 01:40:00,037
But before you leave,
please give me one chance to explain.

1750
01:40:00,197 --> 01:40:01,080
Just one chance.

1751
01:40:03,357 --> 01:40:03,940
[sighs]

1752
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:05,803
Pooja...

1753
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:07,892
I went to tell her about us that day.

1754
01:40:08,441 --> 01:40:11,098
She's afraid of
commitment and relationships.

1755
01:40:12,322 --> 01:40:14,967
Pooja... but I now realized...

1756
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,071
She didn't go away to part ways from me.

1757
01:40:19,154 --> 01:40:21,343
But to grow close enough
to never go away again.

1758
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:26,158
When she came back
and said she loved me...

1759
01:40:26,634 --> 01:40:29,967
I'm supposed to jump around like
a crazy person and hug her tight.

1760
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,509
But do you know how bad I reacted?

1761
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,592
Even I didn't understand why.

1762
01:40:37,894 --> 01:40:39,092
Then I realized...

1763
01:40:40,692 --> 01:40:41,842
I fell hard for you.

1764
01:40:43,925 --> 01:40:45,925
More than the joy of finding her love...

1765
01:40:46,894 --> 01:40:49,634
I felt afraid of losing you.

1766
01:40:51,509 --> 01:40:53,092
Then tell her, Abhi.

1767
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:57,273
Ask her to leave us and you alone.

1768
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,407
She'll suffer, Pooja.

1769
01:41:00,866 --> 01:41:02,467
I promised her mom.

1770
01:41:03,384 --> 01:41:04,634
She's really important to me.

1771
01:41:05,967 --> 01:41:07,175
I can't hurt her.

1772
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,009
Give her some time.

1773
01:41:10,509 --> 01:41:11,675
This is just a phase.

1774
01:41:12,374 --> 01:41:13,759
She'll understand.

1775
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,134
And I want you with me in this.

1776
01:41:18,097 --> 01:41:19,467
What if she doesn't understand?

1777
01:41:24,092 --> 01:41:25,425
That's what I fear.

1778
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:29,838
I'm also a girl, Abhi.
I can't live with this insecurity.

1779
01:41:30,038 --> 01:41:31,955
You don't say a word
no matter what she does.

1780
01:41:32,365 --> 01:41:33,535
That means you're confused.

1781
01:41:34,634 --> 01:41:36,009
That is why I'm leaving.

1782
01:41:37,233 --> 01:41:39,717
It's not right for us to get
married amidst the confusion.

1783
01:41:40,031 --> 01:41:41,842
So, I'm cancelling our wedding.

1784
01:41:42,392 --> 01:41:45,559
Will you let me go, or leave her for me

1785
01:41:46,846 --> 01:41:47,887
It's up to you.

1786
01:41:57,027 --> 01:42:01,134
"All the love hidden in the heart"

1787
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:05,384
"There's no point in abandoning it"

1788
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:10,175
"Love that is desperate for attention"

1789
01:42:10,505 --> 01:42:13,759
"It can compel you to surrender"

1790
01:42:23,932 --> 01:42:27,717
"Love that sacrifices life for another"

1791
01:42:28,492 --> 01:42:31,717
"It can make you question your will"

1792
01:42:32,925 --> 01:42:37,092
"Love that defies the purpose of wait"

1793
01:42:37,494 --> 01:42:41,217
"It returns like a curse"

1794
01:42:41,861 --> 01:42:45,800
"What do any of our hearts hold?"

1795
01:42:46,513 --> 01:42:50,425
"How will the pain ever subside?"

1796
01:42:50,966 --> 01:42:54,925
"What happened in the meanwhile?"

1797
01:42:55,495 --> 01:42:59,467
"Time refuses to stand testimony"

1798
01:43:00,081 --> 01:43:04,009
"Go away, my love"

1799
01:43:04,494 --> 01:43:08,134
"Isn't love all about sacrifice?"

1800
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:13,050
"Go away, my love"

1801
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:16,550
"Isn't love all about compromise?"

1802
01:43:21,055 --> 01:43:22,882
[phone rings]

1803
01:43:26,386 --> 01:43:27,092
Abhi...

1804
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:29,759
<i>What happened son?</i>

1805
01:43:30,967 --> 01:43:31,925
Dad...

1806
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,509
Are you okay with any decision
I make regarding my marriage?

1807
01:43:36,754 --> 01:43:38,717
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

1808
01:43:39,237 --> 01:43:40,425
I can't explain everything now dad.

1809
01:43:41,413 --> 01:43:42,505
Just tell me if you're okay with it.

1810
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:45,598
We're okay with any
decision that keeps you happy.

1811
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:47,235
<i>This is your marriage.</i>

1812
01:43:47,435 --> 01:43:50,776
The most personal and
selfish decision in your life.

1813
01:43:51,237 --> 01:43:54,055
What we and others think doesn't matter.

1814
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:56,467
<i>What are you thinking?
What do you want?</i>

1815
01:43:57,473 --> 01:43:59,800
Think a hundred times
before making the decision.

1816
01:44:00,589 --> 01:44:03,092
Once you've decided,
don't be confused anymore.

1817
01:44:03,759 --> 01:44:04,842
Because...

1818
01:44:05,467 --> 01:44:06,675
It's about life.

1819
01:44:21,186 --> 01:44:22,550
Abhi, what are you doing?

1820
01:44:22,842 --> 01:44:24,217
Come. Come, sit.

1821
01:44:25,146 --> 01:44:26,384
-Tell me.
-What?

1822
01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:28,322
Tell me. What's the plan? Huh?

1823
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,342
Pooja left me.

1824
01:44:30,923 --> 01:44:32,960
[chuckles]
We broke up just like you wanted.

1825
01:44:33,444 --> 01:44:35,217
It's just you and me now. Tell me!

1826
01:44:35,885 --> 01:44:38,634
Why are you silent?
I'm expecting something from you.

1827
01:44:39,455 --> 01:44:40,967
-Actually...
-Let's get married.

1828
01:44:43,964 --> 01:44:45,259
You and me.

1829
01:44:45,925 --> 01:44:48,178
Let's get married.
[birds chirping]

1830
01:44:51,939 --> 01:44:52,717
Alright.

1831
01:44:53,269 --> 01:44:54,134
Let's get married.

1832
01:44:54,725 --> 01:44:55,592
But...

1833
01:44:56,259 --> 01:44:57,884
I want a stable family life.

1834
01:44:58,663 --> 01:44:59,717
I want kids.

1835
01:44:59,992 --> 01:45:01,009
And I want commitment.

1836
01:45:01,175 --> 01:45:03,009
You should always be with me.
Right next to me.

1837
01:45:03,414 --> 01:45:04,461
Can you do that?

1838
01:45:04,661 --> 01:45:06,217
I know how marriage works, Abhi.

1839
01:45:06,803 --> 01:45:09,509
I won't leave your side for a second.

1840
01:45:10,035 --> 01:45:11,171
Okay?

1841
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:16,561
Okay.

1842
01:45:16,885 --> 01:45:17,782
So what's the plan?

1843
01:45:18,065 --> 01:45:19,759
Let's get married right now.

1844
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,925
In some registrar's office.

1845
01:45:22,424 --> 01:45:23,431
What about mom and dad?

1846
01:45:23,663 --> 01:45:24,759
What about mom and dad?

1847
01:45:25,495 --> 01:45:26,634
Both of us are fine with this, right?

1848
01:45:27,251 --> 01:45:28,392
We can meet them later.

1849
01:45:28,592 --> 01:45:29,878
We're talking about marriage, Kantham.

1850
01:45:30,078 --> 01:45:31,217
You might not have a family. But I do...

1851
01:45:34,869 --> 01:45:36,760
[birds chirping]

1852
01:45:38,676 --> 01:45:40,523
Sorry. That wasn't my intention.

1853
01:45:41,018 --> 01:45:43,602
No, Abhi. You're hundred percent right.

1854
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,926
Because I don't have parents,
the thought never struck my mind.

1855
01:45:47,868 --> 01:45:49,533
I'll talk to aunty and uncle.

1856
01:45:50,865 --> 01:45:52,551
Let's get out of here first. Come.

1857
01:45:52,751 --> 01:45:54,338
"Heart is a mystery"
ABHISHEK WEDS POOJA

1858
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:56,693
"Man changes with time"

1859
01:45:57,061 --> 01:46:00,140
"He tends to falter"

1860
01:46:01,565 --> 01:46:05,592
"Soul reaches a standstill,
she crosses paths with me"

1861
01:46:06,036 --> 01:46:09,009
"What is this pain called?"

1862
01:46:09,496 --> 01:46:14,327
"It is beyond comprehension"

1863
01:46:21,745 --> 01:46:25,800
"Go away, my love"

1864
01:46:26,369 --> 01:46:29,509
"Isn't love all about sacrifice?"

1865
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:34,675
"Go away, my love"

1866
01:46:35,365 --> 01:46:38,425
"Isn't love all about compromise?"

1867
01:46:43,217 --> 01:46:45,300
We better call Pooja and family.

1868
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,084
Oh.

1869
01:46:47,716 --> 01:46:49,117
I guess they're inside.

1870
01:46:50,494 --> 01:46:51,700
You wait right here.

1871
01:46:52,318 --> 01:46:54,242
I'll go talk to them and be back.

1872
01:46:54,844 --> 01:46:56,325
You don't worry, Abhi.

1873
01:46:56,825 --> 01:46:58,242
We won't have a problem.

1874
01:47:16,075 --> 01:47:17,075
Hi, Pooja.

1875
01:47:17,409 --> 01:47:18,200
Hi, aunty.

1876
01:47:24,452 --> 01:47:26,740
Actually, I came wanting to say a lot.

1877
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:29,994
But after standing here,
I feel a little nervous.

1878
01:47:32,983 --> 01:47:34,701
I'll take a minute's time.

1879
01:47:38,324 --> 01:47:41,016
Pooja, will you come closer to me?

1880
01:47:42,175 --> 01:47:43,979
I want to ask you something personally.

1881
01:47:56,084 --> 01:47:57,881
Will you let go of Abhi for me?

1882
01:48:00,693 --> 01:48:03,282
[chuckles]
I was just pulling your leg. Sorry.

1883
01:48:07,594 --> 01:48:08,728
I'll tell you something.

1884
01:48:08,928 --> 01:48:10,070
I'll only tell you once.

1885
01:48:10,289 --> 01:48:11,639
I don't want you to show off, okay?

1886
01:48:14,054 --> 01:48:15,659
I'm very sorry, Pooja.

1887
01:48:17,728 --> 01:48:19,627
I loved Abhi unexpectedly.

1888
01:48:20,742 --> 01:48:21,736
And...

1889
01:48:23,492 --> 01:48:25,587
I disturbed you both on purpose.

1890
01:48:26,241 --> 01:48:27,258
I'm so sorry.

1891
01:48:28,764 --> 01:48:31,158
I really love Abhi, Pooja.

1892
01:48:32,242 --> 01:48:33,825
As much as...

1893
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:38,450
I love my mom.

1894
01:48:40,612 --> 01:48:44,851
Every time Abhi was with
me, I'd feel like a Princess.

1895
01:48:46,254 --> 01:48:48,550
I wanted that feeling for a lifetime.

1896
01:48:50,215 --> 01:48:53,409
But I have a bloody
useless commitment phobia.

1897
01:48:55,701 --> 01:48:59,305
Every time Abhi came
closer, I'd feel afraid.

1898
01:48:59,872 --> 01:49:00,989
I'd run away.

1899
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:03,350
That's what I did last time.

1900
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:08,325
I thought I was running
away from situations. But...

1901
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:11,227
I never thought I was
running away from Abhi's life.

1902
01:49:14,444 --> 01:49:18,659
I took a long time to digest the fact
that Abhi isn't in my life anymore.

1903
01:49:19,745 --> 01:49:21,325
I couldn't take it at all.

1904
01:49:21,698 --> 01:49:23,867
I didn't know what to do
or whom to share with.

1905
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:27,992
Everyone's love has a
period of time, Pooja.

1906
01:49:29,421 --> 01:49:30,534
This isn't my period of time.

1907
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,736
That doesn't mean I'm not in love.

1908
01:49:39,149 --> 01:49:42,570
Actually, Abhi could've cut me
off long back if he wanted to.

1909
01:49:45,518 --> 01:49:46,617
But he didn't do it.

1910
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:48,992
He was very clear about you.

1911
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:52,200
He let me go through this phase.

1912
01:49:53,722 --> 01:49:56,284
I was playing a game I lost ages ago,
Pooja.

1913
01:49:57,075 --> 01:49:58,200
I won't play anymore.

1914
01:50:00,801 --> 01:50:03,115
I hate you, Pooja! For what you are.

1915
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:05,289
How can you be so perfect and beautiful?

1916
01:50:05,489 --> 01:50:06,909
Inside and out.

1917
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:10,733
Abhi wants you.

1918
01:50:11,094 --> 01:50:12,094
You want Abhi.

1919
01:50:12,447 --> 01:50:14,165
Who the hell am I to say no?

1920
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,767
I'll go and send him to you.

1921
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:27,659
If Abhi sheds a single
tear because of you...

1922
01:50:28,349 --> 01:50:29,414
I'm with him.

1923
01:50:29,614 --> 01:50:30,748
Don't forget that.

1924
01:50:30,948 --> 01:50:32,263
[chuckles]

1925
01:50:32,811 --> 01:50:36,653
I never guessed I'd get to
say this dialogue in real life.

1926
01:50:40,866 --> 01:50:42,944
Will you do me a favour, Pooja?

1927
01:50:44,344 --> 01:50:46,671
Can you not read this and give
it to Abhi when he comes in?

1928
01:50:48,723 --> 01:50:49,670
Thanks.

1929
01:50:51,891 --> 01:50:53,286
I realized something, Pooja.

1930
01:50:53,944 --> 01:50:55,719
Love isn't always about being together.

1931
01:50:56,643 --> 01:50:58,847
It's also about letting go when needed.

1932
01:51:11,829 --> 01:51:12,992
Then I realized.

1933
01:51:14,525 --> 01:51:15,700
I fell hard for you.

1934
01:51:17,898 --> 01:51:19,867
More than the joy of finding her love...

1935
01:51:20,742 --> 01:51:23,409
I felt afraid of losing you.

1936
01:51:24,088 --> 01:51:26,263
Then tell her, Abhi.

1937
01:51:26,647 --> 01:51:29,486
Ask her to leave us and you alone.

1938
01:51:56,937 --> 01:51:58,016
Why do you look so dull?

1939
01:51:58,975 --> 01:51:59,992
Look at you.

1940
01:52:01,003 --> 01:52:02,242
You've turned all red.

1941
01:52:05,865 --> 01:52:07,650
Why are you so tensed, Abhi?

1942
01:52:08,701 --> 01:52:09,813
Don't worry.

1943
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:12,848
I set everything right for you.

1944
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:17,253
It's about their
daughter's wedding after all.

1945
01:52:19,117 --> 01:52:24,081
They got serious at first
but slowly understood.

1946
01:52:24,825 --> 01:52:27,476
They're waiting for you. Go in.

1947
01:52:31,842 --> 01:52:32,908
Abhi!

1948
01:52:38,112 --> 01:52:39,356
I totally forgot.

1949
01:52:53,469 --> 01:52:53,991
Pooja...

1950
01:52:55,592 --> 01:52:56,093
Pooja...

1951
01:52:57,034 --> 01:52:58,658
Actually I was...

1952
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,492
I'll tell you something.
I'll only tell you once.

1953
01:53:07,999 --> 01:53:09,427
I don't want you to show off, okay?

1954
01:53:10,592 --> 01:53:11,846
I love you, Abhi!

1955
01:53:14,832 --> 01:53:16,142
She asked me to give you this letter.

1956
01:53:21,241 --> 01:53:22,159
Abhi!

1957
01:53:56,303 --> 01:54:00,414
"Go away, my love"

1958
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:03,872
"Isn't love all about sacrifice?"

1959
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:09,444
"Go away, my love"

1960
01:54:09,762 --> 01:54:13,121
"Isn't love all about compromise?"

1961
01:54:24,059 --> 01:54:25,090
[music mutes voice]

1962
01:54:28,314 --> 01:54:29,338
Shucks!

1963
01:54:34,261 --> 01:54:35,300
<i>Abhi...</i>

1964
01:54:35,676 --> 01:54:37,224
<i>I know what you want.</i>

1965
01:54:37,795 --> 01:54:40,243
<i>Didn't I tell you?
I set everything right for you.</i>

1966
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:42,756
<i>Pooja is a great girl.</i>

1967
01:54:43,496 --> 01:54:46,523
<i>A perfect example of how a girl should be.</i>

1968
01:54:47,563 --> 01:54:50,384
<i>I'm so sorry for
troubling you this whole time.</i>

1969
01:54:50,909 --> 01:54:53,517
<i>I'll tell you something. Don't panic.</i>

1970
01:54:54,798 --> 01:54:56,486
<i>This might be a bit shocking to you.</i>

1971
01:54:57,475 --> 01:54:58,924
<i>I don't have much time Abhi</i>

1972
01:54:59,367 --> 01:55:02,284
<i>That is why I wanted to
spend maximum time with you.</i>

1973
01:55:03,114 --> 01:55:04,095
<i>I did.</i>

1974
01:55:04,482 --> 01:55:05,950
<i>Now I want to go peacefully.</i>

1975
01:55:07,024 --> 01:55:08,557
<i>I'm telling this to you alone.</i>

1976
01:55:09,309 --> 01:55:10,575
<i>Don't come looking for me.</i>

1977
01:55:11,303 --> 01:55:12,678
<i>This is how I want you to be.</i>

1978
01:55:13,476 --> 01:55:14,678
I left writing that...

1979
01:55:16,948 --> 01:55:18,427
Abhi was my best memory.

1980
01:55:21,591 --> 01:55:23,364
Sister, do you have cancer?

1981
01:55:25,212 --> 01:55:31,191
<i>"Radio: Jab Hum Jawan Honge song
is been played from the film Betaab"</i>

1982
01:55:33,137 --> 01:55:34,235
Did you believe me?

1983
01:55:34,814 --> 01:55:36,677
If you did,
Abhi would believe much easily.

1984
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:39,770
You don't have cancer?

1985
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,621
Why did you say all that then?

1986
01:55:44,053 --> 01:55:45,666
Because I don't want him
to come looking for me.

1987
01:55:46,852 --> 01:55:48,427
Because I don't want him to wait
for me to return.

1988
01:55:48,826 --> 01:55:49,717
[sighs]

1989
01:55:50,248 --> 01:55:52,681
-My foot!
-Watch your tongue, man!

1990
01:55:53,176 --> 01:55:54,525
There's a city called Hyderabad.

1991
01:55:54,725 --> 01:55:56,643
I'll smack you here and the sound
will echo there.

1992
01:55:57,182 --> 01:55:58,551
Sister...

1993
01:56:00,655 --> 01:56:03,013
Hi, Abhi...

1994
01:56:03,662 --> 01:56:04,854
When did you come?

1995
01:56:05,187 --> 01:56:07,404
I came when you were explaining
your climax in detail.

1996
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:09,835
Oh! You found out, huh?

1997
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,374
Bloody hell! You have cancer, huh?

1998
01:56:12,618 --> 01:56:15,120
-Abhi! Abhi! Abhi! Please!
-Stop there.

1999
01:56:16,078 --> 01:56:18,603
-I didn't know what else to write.
-What? What did you say?

2000
01:56:18,703 --> 01:56:21,244
I felt all cinematic and used
my creative mind. Sorry.

2001
01:56:21,344 --> 01:56:24,126
Do you get these ideas from your
brain or the lice in your hair?

2002
01:56:24,539 --> 01:56:26,302
[chuckles]

2003
01:56:33,834 --> 01:56:34,780
Hey, Kantham!

2004
01:56:35,252 --> 01:56:36,431
I can't run anymore. Stop!

2005
01:56:45,062 --> 01:56:47,964
I can't give highly emotional
and philosophical dialogues now.

2006
01:56:48,792 --> 01:56:50,417
I'm getting married. Come on.

2007
01:56:51,014 --> 01:56:53,054
Shucks!
Abhi, why are you doing this right now?

2008
01:56:53,404 --> 01:56:54,557
What will Pooja think about this?

2009
01:56:54,757 --> 01:56:58,117
Just like Pooja doesn't have a problem
with mom, dad and Sunny uncle...

2010
01:56:58,471 --> 01:56:59,551
She has no problem with you.

2011
01:56:59,926 --> 01:57:02,561
They're my family and so are you. Okay?
