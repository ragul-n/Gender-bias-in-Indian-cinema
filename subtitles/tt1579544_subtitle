What's your problem?
- Family problem!

35
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,389
My father promised
my grandpa that...

36
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,856
l would getmarried with my cousin
during my childhood stage!

37
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,188
After grandpapassed away,

38
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,922
my father and my aunt were
parted becauseof arrogance!

39
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,862
No terms between ourtwo families
forthepast 10 years!

40
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:09,693
Aboveall...

41
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,700
Whenever mymarriage topic is discussed,
my father's response is only one...

42
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,008
lfyou show thephotos and horoscopes of
girls once again, l will kill you!

43
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,147
l promised my father thatl would get her
married with myniece!

44
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,873
Don't you understand ifl said once?
How many times should l tell you?

45
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,984
lf so, you can go and ask them, can't you?

46
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,175
Why should l ask them?

47

That's whyweplanned to stop from expressing

53
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,836
lt's a whileguess!

54
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,202
lf she also loved someoneand
was waiting like you...

55
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,537
Therewill be no problem ifshedid so!

56
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,872
Sayingthat as a reason, l will make
my father agree for our marriage!

57
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,017
So...if she also loves someone,

Your friend Divyaloves a guy!
Shelikes him very much...

1482
01:49:47,881 --> 01:49:50,441

01:49:57,557 --> 01:49:59,752
When your friend is missing
such a well qualified guy...

1489
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,722
ln fact, as she is missing her life...

1490

ls it correct to roam hither andthither
withoutanyintention?

lf so...Should l tell herthat you are a
good guy and not to miss you?

1493
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:11,466
lt's correct ifit's seen directly...

1494
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:14,504
But ifit's seen in a longway...
- Shesaid correctly about you!

But... whats the relationship
between Ganesh and you?

1990
02:21:54,606 --> 02:21:56,733
Thereis no relationship
between him and me!

1991
02:21:56,941 --> 02:21:57,999
Onemore thing...

1992
02:21:58,209 --> 02:22:02,270

Why does he hit us without
anyrelationship?

1997
02:22:18,096 --> 02:22:19,620
Actually...who is he?

1998
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:28,131
As if you sent rowdies to
Express Towers to fight...

1999
02:22:28,339 --> 02:22:29,806
...a girl byname Divya

What superman?

2003

Being a superman, why can't you
resolve your love problem?

2004
02:22:42,587 --> 02:22:44,350
Superman! Spiderman! Batman!

2005

Get out, l say... Go!

2017
02:23:31,369 --> 02:23:33,132
Divya! ln Gandhiji's autobiography...

lfweread the first 30 pages,
we feel that he is the thief!

2019

You said thatwe feel that he is a
greatman ifweread the full book, right?

2020
02:23:40,078 --> 02:23:42,706
As it is so, without knowing
fully about Ganesh...

2021
02:23:43,181 --> 02:23:43,806
Hey...

2022
02:23:44,082 --> 02:23:45,811
Don't you understand as
l asked you to get out? Get out!

2023
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:47,814
Do you know who actually Ganesh is?

2024
02:23:49,087 --> 02:23:51,885
Hey...walk out first! Walk on!

2025
02:23:53,925 --> 02:23:54,550
Move...

2026
02:24:05,503 --> 02:24:08,131
lf you want, you takeoneweek time!

2027
02:24:08,339 --> 02:24:11,069
Butsay, 'Okay' uncle!
- Hey...you!!!

2028
02:24:11,275 --> 02:24:12,833
Move away from here...
Get out!

2029
02:24:17,015 --> 02:24:19,176
Father! That is...
- Shut up your mouth!

2030
02:24:19,384 --> 02:24:20,442
As l did not know your drama...

2031
02:24:20,652 --> 02:24:22,210
...l suspected mynieceand
insulted my sister!

2032
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,682
You are the reason for everyfhing...

2033
02:24:23,888 --> 02:24:25,253
lt's nothe, uncle!

2034
02:24:25,957 --> 02:24:27,254
You arethereason!

2035
02:24:28,393 --> 02:24:29,257
Yes, uncle!

2036
02:24:29,494 --> 02:24:31,758
As you scolded when auntytalked
about an alliance...

2037
02:24:31,963 --> 02:24:34,523
...he fearedwhat you might do if
hetalked about his love!

2038
02:24:35,133 --> 02:24:37,931
Children should have lovetowards
their parents, but not fear!

2039
02:24:38,136 --> 02:24:39,933
This all happened as itwas missing...

2040
02:24:40,571 --> 02:24:42,198
Whatwrong havethey done, uncle?

2041
02:24:42,407 --> 02:24:44,136
Theyboth loved each other and
request you to get them married! ls itwrong?

2042
02:24:44,342 --> 02:24:45,673
What do theylove?

2043
02:24:45,877 --> 02:24:47,742
Do we get them married to
spoil their lives?

2044
02:24:47,945 --> 02:24:49,378
Wethink in 100 ways before
gettingthem married...

2045
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:51,207
You maythink in 100 ways
before marriage!

2046
02:24:51,416 --> 02:24:53,111
But nobody thinks before
falling in love...

2047
02:24:53,317 --> 02:24:55,478
Because...lovedoesn't
blossom with permission!

2048
02:24:55,687 --> 02:24:56,779
lt blossoms, that's it!

2049
02:24:56,988 --> 02:24:59,081
Even thearranged marriages
arenotworking out...

2050
02:24:59,290 --> 02:25:01,121
Will this love marriage be
working out?

2051
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:02,291
lt will definitelywork out!

2052
02:25:02,627 --> 02:25:06,290
lfthereis dying loveoverthere...
it will work out!

2053
02:25:06,497 --> 02:25:09,398
lfthereis dareenough to rebel
against anybody for his lover...

2054
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:10,396
lt will work out!

2055
02:25:10,601 --> 02:25:13,297
lfthebelieftheyhavewhilelove
till the lastbreath...

2056
02:25:13,504 --> 02:25:15,472
...then it will definitely work out!

2057
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:17,937
Uncle! There is no such big difference
between you and us...

2058
02:25:18,142 --> 02:25:19,666
You ask us to understand after
getting married!

2059
02:25:19,877 --> 02:25:22,471
Wesaythatweget married
after understanding!

2060
02:25:22,714 --> 02:25:24,375
You think whatis better!

2061
02:25:24,849 --> 02:25:26,407
Buta small request, uncle!

2062
02:25:26,617 --> 02:25:29,313
Notto deny...you think to accept!

2063
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:31,784
Not as a father! Think as a friend...

2064
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:33,820
Everyfhing will beseen positive!

2065
02:25:35,326 --> 02:25:37,123
He is the reason for
all these, sister...

2066
02:25:37,328 --> 02:25:41,196
Ganesh did all theseto combine
him and his lover!

2067
02:25:41,399 --> 02:25:44,835
As l did notknow that...
...l talked wrongly!

2068
02:25:45,503 --> 02:25:46,834
Forgive me, sister!

2069
02:25:47,038 --> 02:25:49,666
l don't understand ifto feel
happy for our familyunion

2070
02:25:49,874 --> 02:25:54,174

Divya's matter!

2071
02:26:34,452 --> 02:26:37,888
Hey... Don'tthink that
l am supporting Ganesh!

2072
02:26:38,089 --> 02:26:40,649
He was liked bythechildren!

He pretended as ifhe was the friend
of Ganesh that day, right?

2084
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:09,583
Didn't you feel that
it was cheating then?

2198
02:35:35,959 --> 02:35:39,019
A girl told methat she would dieif she
couldn't marrytheguy sheloved!

2199
02:35:39,229 --> 02:35:41,424
l feltit's not wrong to pretend as ifl

2200
02:35:41,632 --> 02:35:43,031
...so, l did so!

2201
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:46,767

Though you knew the fact,
you don't want to believeme!

2205
02:35:53,911 --> 02:35:55,139
You closed youreyes by seeing onelie...

2206
02:35:55,346 --> 02:35:57,610
...and gaveup seeing 100 truths,
that's not correct!

2207
02:35:58,682 --> 02:36:00,584
Nobody can provethelove

2208
02:36:00,584 --> 02:36:02,609

without foreign knowledge!

2211
02:36:07,524 --> 02:36:09,549
Why don't you know aboutme, Divya?

2212
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:12,895
You think that you can forget our
love ifyou go far away from me!

2213
02:36:13,097 --> 02:36:15,395
l think that l love you though l stay
far away from you!

2214
02:36:15,599 --> 02:36:17,157
That's whyl am going...

2216
02:36:20,104 --> 02:36:21,969
Why don't you believeas l

2217
02:36:23,173 --> 02:36:24,470
l don't listen to anybody else now!

2218

You don'task anybody else

l don't know how pain aperson feels
when he is aboutto losehis life, Divya!

2224

Butwhen l part from you now, l feel that

2225
02:36:47,297 --> 02:36:48,662
One morething, Divya!

2226
02:36:49,867 --> 02:36:53,667
The onewho knows to
forgive can love more!

2227

You close your eyes and
talk with your heart!
