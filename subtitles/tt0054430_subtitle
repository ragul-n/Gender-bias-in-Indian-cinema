1
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,400
"Nandu... wake up, son"

2
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,178
Why do you wake me up
"so early, Ma?"

3
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,515
"The sun is up, son."
And I have to go out too

4
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,784
Freshen up and have bread.
- Bread...?

5
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,121
Bread and...?
- Jaggery

6
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:40,122
Damn! Jaggery everyday.
I'm not eating

7
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,291
""If I had my way,""
I would buy you cream everyday

8
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,466
""Well, if you don"t like jaggery,""
go and buy some yogurt

9
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,598
Take the money

10
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,474
Come soon.
- In a jiffy

11
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:13,152
Farida! Get your chunk
out of my way! Move

12
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,393
I won"t.
- No?

13
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:23,166
Nandu! You pushed me on purpose.
I"ll go and tell your mother

14
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,367
""Go on, complain!""

15
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,423
Whose shoes did you steal today?
- Who cares? It"s mine now

16
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:55,564
It"d fetch enough to watch a movie.
- Sneak! Someday you"ll get thrashed

17
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,264
My foot!

18
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,472
Yogurt for one anna.
- Wait till l"m through with her

19
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,215
Quick

20
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,218
Help!

21
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:20,890
Can"t you see a horse? Are you blind?
- You"re blind as a bat!

22
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,230
Who do you think you are?
- Stop yelling and get lost

23
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,590
Get off if you dare!
I"m not Nandu unless I rip your belly

24
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,233
Watch your tongue!
- What"s the matter?

25
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,905
""What is it, Nandu?""
- Look at this wrestler

26
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,110
Firstly he runs his horse over us
and then he yells at me

27
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,007
""Well fatso, what"s up?""
""- Don"t meddle, Khairati. I warn you""

28
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,319
""Really? Trying to scare a child, eh?""
Try taking me on

29
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,918
I warn you! Don"t drag this matter.
- You think that scares me?

30
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,057
I challenge you. Get your men too.
- Really? So let"s fight it out

31
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,597
Why are you crying?
Are you hurt?

32
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,009
My yogurt spilled

33
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,941
You"re crying for such a little thing?
""Come, let me buy you yogurt""

34
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,283
Get up

35
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,555
Stop counting those papads!
Do you want something else?

36
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,952
""Sardarji, yogurt for one anna.""
""Less curd, more cream""

37
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,092
Smart boy

38
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,965
I"ve never seen you here before.
- l"m from Ambala

39
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,736
I have come here to visit my uncle.
- I see. What"s your name?

40
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,666
Kamli.
- Kamli is a nice name. I"m Nandu

41
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,101
""Nice name, isn"t it?""
- Take your yogurt

42
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,112
Let"s go

43
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,645
Careful

44
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,653
""Easy, easy""

45
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,095
That"s my house

46
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,828
You come to buy yogurt everyday?
- Yes

47
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,728
""Come tomorrow, l"ll give you guavas.""
- Okay

48
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,769
Shall I leave?
- You want to go?

49
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,804
""Yes. It"s quite late,""
aunt will scold me

50
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,337
""Okay, bye.""
Go on

51
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,547
The yogurt.
- Oh yes. Here you are. T ake care

52
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,617
Come here

53
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,924
Yes?
- Are you engaged?

54
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,162
Get lost!

55
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,968
500 principal. And only 1000 bucks
""interest amount has accrued, manager?""

56
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,813
Kamli. Return 2 paise

57
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,774
2 paise...?
- Right

58
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,119
""But uncle, I bought yogurt""
for one anna

59
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,790
Yogurt worth anna...? Why? I told
""you to buy only for 2 paise, didn"t l?""

60
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,126
Get lost

61
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,320
You were told to buy yogurt only for
2 paise. Why did you buy for an anna?

62
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,066
Why are you scolding her?
- She spent an entire anna for yogurt

63
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,636
Brother is angry.
""- lt"s his habit. Come, my child""

64
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,073
But what made you so late?
""- Know what happened today, aunt?""

65
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,415
What happened?

66
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,410
What happened? Tell me.
""- Nothing, Ma""

67
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,985
Then why are you bruised all over?
I"ve told you not to get into fights

68
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:40,086
""l did nothing, Ma. Uncle Khairati""
got into a brawl with that wrestler

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,258
I got caught in between.
- Khairati is acting too smart of late

70
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,223
""Let him come, l"ll fix him""

71
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,096
Where"s the yogurt?
- Yogurt...? I forgot

72
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,634
And where"s the container?
- The container...? Yes...

73
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,772
I left it at uncle Khairati"s place.
I"ll get it right away

74
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,118
""Kamli, where are you going?""
- To aunt Paro

75
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,253
""Come with me, let"s play in the
swing.""
""- Not now, Farida""

76
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,287
My aunt wants me back soon.
- Will you come in the afternoon?

77
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,129
We"ll go to the orchard
and pluck berries

78
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,195
Sure.
""- You must come, l"ll wait for you""

79
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,694
All right

80
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,810
Uncle...

81
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,014
""what happened, uncle?""

82
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,151
You"re very naughty. You started
the fight and then you vanished

83
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,926
Who says? Would I ever desert you?

84
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,162
Don"t fool me.
You were nowhere around

85
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,492
Who says? Who snatched his stick?
You would have got your skull split...

86
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,498
were it not for me.
""- Bravo, son""

87
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,941
""Uncle, looks like you got beaten""
black and blue

88
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,904
I"m invincible.
- Well said

89
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,113
Let go! Lay off

90
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,318
""Uncle, is it hurting?""
""- Very badly, son""

91
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,180
Every inch is bruised.
- Then let me have 2 annas

92
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,187
I"ll get such a salve that
will ease the pain in no time

93
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,929
You think you can fool your uncle?
""You"ll vanish with the money, I know""

94
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,134
""lf I lie, may your pain increase.""
- Now don"t kill me. Take the money

95
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,540
Take it and get lost

96
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,535
""l"m taking this container, uncle.""
- Take it! And get lost!

97
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,345
Kamli

98
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,856
""Aunt, where is Kamli?""

99
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,754
She has gone to the station.
She"s going back to Ambala

100
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,224
Why?
- Kamli"s father is sick

101
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,570
He had sent a telegram

102
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,296
There! The thread broke again. Wonder
what"s wrong with the machine today

103
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,776
Nandu

104
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,723
Where are you?

105
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,434
Farida...
- Yes?

106
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,203
""Hold the rooster, l"ll be right back.""
- My hands are not free

107
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,631
""Hold it, will you?""
- How disgusting!

108
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,152
Where were you? I"ve been yelling
for you since an hour

109
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,320
I"ve been here since an hour.
- Liar. You"re grown up now

110
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,127
Will you get on to some job now?
Or have fun and play all your life?

111
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,462
Where"s the time for fun
""and play, Ma? I"m off. It"s urgent""

112
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,991
Listen...
""- No time, Ma""

113
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,329
Give it to me.
""- Conned your Ma, didn"t you?""

114
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,731
I"ll tell her where you go everyday.
- What did you say? You will tell Ma?

115
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,506
Want me to shove you into the water?
- No! I won"t tell her. Let me go

116
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,345
Apologise.
- l"m sorry. Let me go now

117
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,681
Go on

118
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,685
I"m not sorry.
- Damn you!

119
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:13,826
Girdhari"s rooster is ready.
- We"ll know now

120
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,531
Fighting Nandu"s Noora is not easy.
""- Girdhari, are you ready?""

121
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:22,272
""l"m all set. Nandu, are you ready?""
- Cent percent ready. Come on

122
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,337
Here goes mine.
""- Go on, son""

123
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,223
""Kill him, Rakha""

124
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,066
""Bravo, Noora. That was great""

125
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,733
Wonderful. Bite him again

126
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,842
""Bravo, my tiger""

127
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,556
Are you trying to escape?

128
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:24,398
""Noora, great! Bless you! Save Rakha,""
Girdhari. Or he"ll lose face

129
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,897
I"ll have your blood
""if you say that again, Nandu!""

130
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:09,611
""Let"s go on and on,""
""till the road ends""""""

We light up the world

We bring Spring along the way

""Move it, sonny""

147
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,999
Drinking 5 glasses of lassi is no
big deal. Let"s see if you can have 6

148
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,370
""Yes, come on!""
- Drink it up

149
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,013
""Go on, drink it up!""
- Bravo

150
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,851
Give me 8 annas.
- I bet only 4 annas

151
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,195
It was 8.
""- I said, 4 annas""

152
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,029
Horseman!
- Who the hell...?

153
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,396
Get your cart out of the way?
- Does the road belong to you?

154
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,297
""Shut up! You"re no pprince, are you?""
- Do you know who I am?

155
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,041
I"ve dealt with many of your types.
""- Then come on, try me out""

156
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,270
Don"t argue with them. Take the

""l"ll deal with you next time, sonny.""
""- My foot, you will!""

158
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,247
Bloody crook

159
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,516
What did you say?
- Scoundrel

160
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,381
Forget it.
- She calls me a scoundrel

161
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,059
Forget it. Don"t argue with a girl.
- Girl...? Is she?

162
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,834
Brother...

163
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,763
""l have no one now, brother.""
""- Don"t say that, Geeta""

164
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,402
I"m still alive. I won"t let
anything worry you

165
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,473
Kamli!
- Aunt!

166
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,745
I could die for such a beauty.
You"re so grown up

167
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,749
You kept me waiting.
But why did you come by this train?

168
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:50,756
The train we were supposed to take
""was full of soldiers, so we left it""

169
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,759
Good you didn"t take that one.
- Will you just keep talking?

170
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,762
Won"t you take them inside?
""- Come on in. Come, Geeta""

171
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,098
""Geeta, I hope the jewellery is safe.""
- Yes brother. Here you are

172
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:15,950
Goodness!

173
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,519
""You had me scared! What"s this,
Nandu?""
""- Look what l"ve got for you, Ma""

174
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:25,455
""A shawl, and...""
close your eyes first

175
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,127
""Close your eyes, please""

176
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,333
Wonderful. It looks so good on you

177
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:43,137
I can see everything so clearly now.
""Nandu, you look more handsome, son""

178
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,152
And...
- Let me see

179
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,021
Show me your hand.
- Here

180
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,155
Take it.
- My necklace? How did you release it?

181
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,496
I paid the moneylender in cash.
He did no favour

182
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,167
""May you live a million years, son""

183
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,636
But Nandu... where did you
get so much money?

184
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,671
""Ma, I made good bucks""
at the cock fight

185
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,742
What did you say? You gambled?
You bought all these with that money?

186
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,982
""Who gambled, Ma?""
It was an even contest

187
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:28,182
You think l"m a fool? Today it was a
""cock fight, tomorrow you"ll play cards""

188
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,520
""And soon, you"ll end up as a thief.""
- Nonsense. You"re getting me wrong

189
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:38,868
Think. Uncle Khairati earns from his
""horse-cart, you stitch clothes...""

190
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,540
to earn two square meals a day. What"s
the big deal if I use a rooster?

191
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,674
""No matter what you say,""
it doesn"t befit a decent family

192
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:54,484
I thought you"d grow up and find
a lucrative job and be my support

193
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:00,320
But... I"m hurt at the signs
you have begun to show

194
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,459
""l"m certain, you"re on the wrong
path.""
- Ma!

195
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:17,398
I don"t want anything that illegal
money buys. I hate to even touch it

196
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,257
What is it?
- I promise not to gamble again. Never

197
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,388
You promise?
- I swear

198
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,393
My darling!
Your words l"ll treasure

199
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,070
Now come and eat

200
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,776
Daddy will kill me if he finds out.
- How will he know?

201
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,277
We"ll return before sunset.
- You said that last time too

202
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,953
I"m not buying that. And why will
I go with you? Who are you to me?

203
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,954
We"ll be related soon.
Why don"t we make the most of it?

204
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,956
Uncle!
- Goodness!

205
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,959
Damn you! What is it?
- l"m going to the temple

206
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,302
Don"t you take the cart!
- l"m not going sightseeing

207
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,097
""Stop! Stop it, will you?""

208
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,672
Vazira! You!

209
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:43,577
""Nandu, catch you later.""
- Thief! You"re expanding your business

210
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,389
You"ve reached the temple now.
- This is how I earn my bread

211
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,851
Give me the shoes! Else...
- Hush! If l"m caught...

212
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,721
I"ll be thrashed. Take it.
""- Come here again, and l"ll thrash you""

213
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,400
My shoes! This is the limit! These
thieves don"t spare the temple too

214
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:07,208
My brand new shoes!
My wife is not going to spare me

215
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,739
There"s the thief. Get him

216
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,351
Would a thief come walking to you?
I grabbed your shoes from the thief

217
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,888
Where are my shoes?
- Must be here. Take a look

218
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,929
So it"s you?

219
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,998
I had no idea you were adept
at thieving too

220
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:37,232
""Lady, watch your tongue.""
Know who you are talking to?

221
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,509
To a thief.
- Come again!

222
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,574
Didn"t you hear? I"m talking
to a thief. Bloody thug

223
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,950
""My, my!""

224
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,149
Say it again.
- lnsolent!

225
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,119
I could die for that.
- l"ll get you thrown behind bars

226
00:24:55,494 --> 00:25:01,057
""Go on, do it. But I must say,""
you look prettier when you"re in rage

227
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:08,798
Where"s the other shoe?
- You must have forgotten at home

228
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,947
""Lady, the cart is ready.""
- Let"s go

229
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,481
Scoundrel

230
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,128
""Who is the scoundrel, lady?""
- That one. He steals shoes

231
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,024
He also has a foul-tongue.
""- That one? He is Nandu, lady""

232
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,130
Who...?
- Nandu. Paro"s son

233
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,168
""He"s not a thief. Yes, he is a bit""
naughty. He"s the talk of the town

234
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,671
Nice boy. He"s a simpleton

235
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,513
Where to? Where...?
- To the moneylender"s house

236
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,733
Goodness!

237
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:56,375
""So lady, have you brought the police?""

238
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,181
Is aunt Paro in?
- No

239
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,850
I want to get a dress made.
- She"ll b4e back in the evening

240
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,791
Listen... where are you going?
""- I told you, come back in the evening""

241
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,262
Can"t you talk properly? Is this
how you treat clients?

242
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:23,165
That"s right. This is how I treat
people like you. Any message for Ma?

243
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,939
Yes

244
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,280
Tell aunt Paro that Kamli
had come here

245
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,630
""Kamli had come, really?""
Such Kamlis come here everyday

246
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,966
""You are Nandu, aren"t you?""
- Any doubts?

247
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,978
Don"t you recognise me?
- Why should I care?

248
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:09,086
I"m Kamli. Remember
""those times, Nandu? You saved me...""

249
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,945
from being knocked off by a horse.
You bought me yogurt. Remember?

250
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,457
You remember nothing?
- I don"t

251
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:26,131
""l fell off a hill, you see. Ever
since""
""l lost my memory, albeit I survived""

252
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,375
""ls it...? When aunt returns,""
tell her I was here

253
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,153
Hey lassie...

254
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,017
Iisten

255
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,704
Are you engaged?

256
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,899
Get lost!

257
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,504
Kamli...?

258
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,522
""Lassie, I won"t spare you""
during the festival of colours

259
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,059
""Please, let me paint you...""
- Uncle!

260
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,901
Damn you!
""- Come on, let"s play Holi""

261
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,776
Farida...
- Nandu? What are you doing here?

262
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,441
Where is Kamli?
- How would I know?

263
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,112
Don"t be vain. Tell me.
- Honestly?

264
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,574
""Yes, tell me.""
- She went back to Ambala

265
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,779
Kamli has gone back to Ambala...?
- Yes. She took the morning train

266
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:33,997
""She told me,""
""l"m going, take care of Nandu...""

267
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,466
Where to...?
- Let me go

268
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,600
Listen...
- Let me go

269
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,532
""Oh, how will l? Won"t you""
sprinkle colours on me?

270
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,435
No! I don"t play Holi with strangers

271
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,222
It was fun!
- We coloured the girls all over

272
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,327
You aren"t better off

273
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,496
My bangle...?
- What happened?

274
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,830
""My bangle is missing, Farida.""
- Where did you lose it?

275
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,004
I must"ve dropped it
while playing

276
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,445
Or did you give it to Nandu?
- Don"t be funny. Get my bangle back

277
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,322
I...? No way.
I don"t want to get into this hassle

278
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,490
""You are my good friend, aren"t you?""
Please get my bangle back

279
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,330
Let"s go and ask him.
""- Go on, l"ll stay here""

280
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,393
Then l"m not going

281
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,330
""All right, let"s go""

282
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,879
Go on

283
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,881
Move it

284
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,513
""No, l"m not going.""
- Why are you scared?

285
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,878
What if aunt sees me...?
- She"s at the temple. Go on

286
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:11,658
I"ll sneeze if I see her coming.
""- No, l"m not going to him""

287
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,894
Damn you! Coward

288
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:39,790
Goodness!

289
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,588
""You were running away from me, right?""
What makes you come running to me?

290
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,726
Return my bangle.
- What bangle? I don"t have it

291
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:56,630
Don"t lie. Return my bangle.
- You mean this?

292
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,542
Yes. Give it to me

293
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,740
""Give it to me, please.""
- On one condition

294
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,607
What condition?
- Promise to come to the lake tomorrow

295
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,746
I won"t.
- Then l"m not giving it to you

296
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:14,282
Please return my bangle.
- After you promise

297
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,952
""All right, I promise. Give it to me.""
- Swear by me

298
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,458
I swear.
""- Swear by me, I said""

299
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,171
All right.
- What?

300
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:33,134
I swear by you

301
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,314
I"m dead!
- What happened?

302
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,778
Your mother is coming.
That"s why Farida sneezed

303
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,652
Get inside!

304
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,667
""Farida, I hope all"s well?""
- Absolutely not

305
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,670
It seems you"ve caught cold
playing colours

306
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,004
I think so. But I had to come here.
- What"s the matter?

307
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,275
My Mother wants the scissors.
- It must be in Nandu"s bedroom

308
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,751
Aunt! Come home first.
Mother wants you

309
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,821
Let me take the scissors.
""- No, come home first""

310
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:29,029
The scissors will come later.
""- It won"t come walking, will it?""

311
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:34,363
I hope you aren"t running a fever?
- Fever...? Not yet

312
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,435
But it"s going to grip me soon.
- Silly girl

313
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,539
""Nandu, what are you upto?""
""- Nothing, Ma""

314
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:53,323
""What are you looking for, Farida?""
- Scissors

315
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,726
What"s wrong with you today?
Why will I keep the scissors there?

316
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,392
It"s in the trunk.
- Why do you need scissors?

317
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,391
Farida"s mother wants it.
""- But it"s in your bedroom, Ma""

318
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,735
""No, I remember keeping it here.""
""- No, l"ve seen it myself""

319
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,833
I"ll find it for you.
- What was that?

320
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,400
""Nothing, Ma""

321
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,681
""Kamli, all clear.""
Get out of it

322
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,090
Damn you! You almost got me killed!
- Hush. Just get out of here

323
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,442
""What"s the matter, Farida? Why are""
you both sneaking away like a thief?

324
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,505
""lt"s nothing, uncle""

325
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,247
""l told you,""
the scissors is in your room

326
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,715
Who"s that girl?
""- She is Kamli, aunt""

327
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,460
Kamli...? The moneylender"s niece?
- Right. She went home to see me

328
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,798
""Not finding me there, she came here.""
- Very good

329
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,795
""But Farida, you don"t live here.""
- What do you mean?

330
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,800
I saw you both coming out together.
""- Are you drunk, Khairati?""

331
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,134
Farida was here alone. Kamli
must"ve have come looking for her

332
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,947
""Do you remember me, dear?""
- Yes. How wouldn"t I recognise you?

333
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,414
But I didn"t recognise you.
You"ve grown up

334
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,551
""Nandu, come outside.""
Look who is here

335
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,857
Who is it?
- lt"s Kamli

336
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:42,824
""Kamli...? Who is that, Ma?""
- Hear that? You don"t remember her?

337
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,170
The moneylender"s niece.
Your childhood friend

338
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,504
That girl with a small nose? The one
who cried when her yogurt spilled?

339
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,173
""You"re great, son.""
As if you don"t know her...

340
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,443
Vazira is throwing a party tonight.
""- Are we going, nephew?""

341
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,510
""Yes, of course.""
- Come on

342
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,178
Don"t mind Nandu. He"s got
mischief running in his veins

343
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,351
""Farida, l"ll get the scissors""

344
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:35,272
""With desires rising within me, I wait""
""for you, with my arms stretched out""""""

345
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:42,283
""My love, my throbbing heart""
""beckons you... come to me""""""

346
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:16,075
My heart holds me back
""to say...""""""

347
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:20,554
""that I must meet you in secrecy,""
""away from prying eyes""""""

348
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:25,093
You and I alone
""will make my heart blossom""""""

349
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:33,331
""With desires rising within me, I wait""
""for you, with my arms stretched out""""""

350
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:40,334
""My love, my throbbing heart""
""beckons you... come to me""""""

351
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,043
Deep in delightful thoughts
""of our meeting...""""""

352
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,508
""l wait for you, my love...""

353
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,745
as the garden desirously
""expects the Spring""""""

354
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:31,390
""With desires rising within me, I wait""
""for you, with my arms stretched out""""""

355
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:38,400
""My love, my throbbing heart""
""beckons you... come to me""""""

356
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:27,676
The war has begun again.
Inflation is on the rise

357
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:32,984
And the Rupee is falling. Now you
""tell me, Mr Ramlal, at this rate...""

358
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:39,020
wouldn"t my business incur losses?
""- You"re right, Lala-ji""

359
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,456
The situation seems really bad.
- Exactly. If you could help me...

360
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,271
""rake some money, l"d buy""
some things and stack them up

361
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,740
""Why not, why not? War has made""
millionaires out of paupers

362
00:41:55,112 --> 00:42:01,142
""Besides, you have a booming business.""
Getting you money is not difficult

363
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:06,885
So find some scapegoat
and get me the loan

364
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,155
I"ll try

365
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:16,163
""l"m not lying, in the last 20 years""
I have handled money in millions

366
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,164
Not a single soul has complained ever.
- That is why I have picked you

367
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,498
""As for your brokerage, you will""
have it the moment I get the money

368
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:32,614
""Lala-ji, who is that lass?""
- She"s my niece. Kamli

369
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:38,181
She"s pretty. You"re very fortunate.
- My foot!

370
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:43,016
""The war is going on,""
and l"m worried about her wedding too

371
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,520
Do not worry. Listen...

372
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,209
What is it?
- Forgive me. I know you"re furious

373
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,953
Why would I be furious?
- I kept you waiting at the lake

374
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:17,817
Wrong. I never went there.
- Granted. As I was about to leave...

375
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,389
I saw Ma shivering with fever.
- Is aunt unwell?

376
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,168
She was. She"s fine now. That"s why
l"m going to make offerings to God

377
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,569
Where are you going? Listen...
- What is it?

378
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,240
I have many things to tell you.
Will you see me at the lake tomorrow?

379
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,046
I don"t have the time.
- Strange girl. Haven"t I apologised?

380
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:41,373
Yet you"re so vain.
""- I told you, I don"t have the time""

381
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,587
""Busy, eh? All right, l"m busy too.""
You need not come

382
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,606
For you

383
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,612
Come...
come on

384
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,692
With a lilting beat
""of the raindrops...""""""

385

Geeta...
- Yes brother?

410
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,788
Here are some sweets.
- Who gave them?

411
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,323
I bought it. Today is the festival
of Baisakhi. While returning...

412
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,188
from the temple I thought
of buying sweets for you

413
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,995
""Sister-in-law, have a sweet.""
""- No, let Kamli have it first""

414
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,010
Your uncle got sweets for you

415
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:06,422
Only two?
""- Here, take one more""

416
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:11,359
""No, give me two more, Ma.""
""- All right, here"s one more""

417
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,703
Where are you going?
- T o Farida. We"re going to the fair

418
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,040
Come back soon

419
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,453
""Neelu, you came alone?""
Come with me

420
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,463
The shoes!
- l"ll pay for it

421
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,063
My love...
- Return the shoes!

422
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:59,307
Where were you? I"ve been
looking for you. Come on

423
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,350
And Farida?
- She"ll follow. Come on

424
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,254
What"s your problem?
I don"t understand

425
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:19,095
Not only did Ramlal tell me about the
""Subedars, l"ve also done the enquiry""

426
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:24,907
They are very decent and rich too.
""As for the boy, he"s in the army""

427
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,503
""He holds a nice position,""
earns well too

428
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,108
These days parents ask their children
about their daughters" wishes

429
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,915
They ask who can"t tell
what"s good and what"s bad

430
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:38,516
Forget Kamli"s choice. I gave a good
thought before choosing this family

431
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:43,588
She"ll rule like a queen. She"ll
forever play in golds and silver

432
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,927
But...

433
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,534
""lf I heed you,""
l"ll end up in the asylum

434
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,129
""l tell you, not to interfere""
in my matters

435
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,483
Listen...

436
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,155
What is it?

437
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,978
You won"t talk to me?

438
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,751
Then l"m off

439
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,356
Nandu! Listen to me

440
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,000
Are you cross with me?
- l"m not talking to you

441
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,034
Wait.
- What is it?

442
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:10,004
May I say something? You look
more handsome when you"re furious

443
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:15,710
And this dress on you!
I could die!

444
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,455
""You won"t refuse me, will you?""

445
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,217
""You won"t annoy me, will you?""

446
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,327
You will?
- Never

447
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,528
And you won"t
""stay away from me, will you?""

448
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,570
I"ll never stay away from you. Never

449
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,543
""Honestly, Kamli?""

450
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,842
I don"t understand
what"s come over me

451
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:54,749
""When l"m with you,""
I feel like staying with you forever

452
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,255
When I am away...
- What do you feel then?

453
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,266
I feel like coming to you

454
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,369
You"ve made me happy

455
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,276
""Nandu, let me go""

456
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,050
Yes?

457
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,649
Come here

458
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,420
Sweets? For whom?
- For you

459
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:14,336
Not like this. Feed me

460
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,340
Else I won"t eat

461
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,061

01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:06,425
""She"s a kid, she doesn"t understand""
the delicacy of the situation

483
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:12,300
Now that she"s going to marry
into the Subedar family...

484
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:18,107
I don"t want any rumours
to reach the boy"s father

485
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:24,743
""l agree, Mr Ramlal. You won"t have""
complaints anymore. I"ll see to it

486
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,312
I hope you don"t mind.
""- Oh no, not at all""

487
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,656
I"m happy that you considered her
your own daughter and advised me

488
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,457
I must leave now

489
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,330
Why was Ramlal here?
- To complain

490
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,462
About whom?
- About Kamli

491
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:49,331
He saw her dancing with the girls.
- What"s the big deal?

492
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,039
It"s the festival.
""- You will stand by her, I know""

493
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,274
You never spare a thought for...

494
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:04,943
Where have you been? Tell me. Aren"t
you ashamed to dance before everyone?

495
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:08,484
Don"t make an issue out of it.
""Go on, l"ll make her see reasons""

496
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:14,125
""Get this clear, Kamli. You will not""
step out of this house anymore. Dig?

497
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,699
If I get complaints.
you"ll have to face it

498
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,032
You"re grown up yet you"ve no brains.
Don"t you have any regard...

499
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,704
for the family"s honour?
""- Come off it, Geeta""

500
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:32,312
""Kamli, your uncle thinks in your""
interests. That"s why he felt bad

501
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:37,186
""Well, you"re mature enough""
to understand the ways of the world

502
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,455
You have a horse-carriage
and you make a rupee or two everyday

503
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,455
Hey you... make a yogurt-shake.
Quick!

504
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,458
""Ramlal, don"t instigate me too much.""
""Else, l"ll get married right now...""

505
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,066
even if I have to sell the carriage!
""- Hello, Kartar Singh""

506
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,734
Make some yogurt-shake for me.
""- Nandu, you look very happy today""

507
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:04,705
""Yes, l"m very happy today, Uncle.""
l"ve got the moon and the stars

508
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,481
You are incomparable.
- lsn"t he Paro"s son?

509
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:12,485
""Oh yes, he"s the one.""
Large-hearted young man... Iike me

510
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,489
What do you do for a living?
- Work...? Nothing

511
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,489
Give me that yogurt-shake.
- So you"re unemployed?

512
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,496
An able bodied man like you
goes without work?

513
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,495
You do look healthy and strong.
You also look fearless

514
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:29,502
Why don"t you join the army?
- The army?

515
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:33,102
""Yes, join the army...""
and your life will be made

516
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,506
What did you say?
- Nothing... I said nothing!

517
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,114
When did I ask you
to join the army?

518
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,109
Get lost!
- Good God!

519
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:46,118
""Nandu, you"ve ruined it all.""
""- What"s up, uncle?""

520
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,520
I was getting married.
""- Married...? Bless you, uncle!""

521
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,119
""l"m ruined, l"m doomed.""
""- l"ll have you married, uncle""

522
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,534
You...? You won"t let me down?
- Not at all

523
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,133
""Kartar Singh, get that""
yogurt-shake quick!

524
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,806
Mother...
""- Come, son. Had you been to the fair?""

525
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,538
""Oh yes, Mother. It was great fun.""
- I see

526
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,950
Why must you take the trouble?
Step aside... I"ll get it out

527
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,156
Step aside

528
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,557
Let me keep it.
""- What"s up, son?""

529
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,559
You"re taking a lot of care today?
""- You need rest, Mother""

530
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,569
But who will help me
when you"re out all day?

531
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,567
I"ve made arrangements for that.
- Really?

532
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:44,578
Let me know what you"ve arranged.
""- You"ve often said, mother...""

533
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:48,578
that you find the house very lonely.
I thought about what you said

534
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,188
The house is indeed very lonely.
- Nandu boy...

535
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:57,185
Iooks like you"ve found a wife.
""- Yes, Mother""

536
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,188
How did you guess?
- How did l?

537
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:03,594
""Who"ll know how the son thinks,""
if not his mother?

538
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,601
Quickly tell me who she is.
- That crooked-nosed girl...

539
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,195
who started crying.
- Kamli?

540
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,599
Yes.
- You"ll make a nice couple

541
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,209
Let me go. I"ll fall

542
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,614
Mad!
""- l"m a mad-hatter, all right""

543
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,619
""But, my son...""
""- No buts, Mother""

544
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,624
Go and talk to Lalaji. I"ll ask
the priest to fix a date

545
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,229
""Have patience, mad boy.""
What"s the hurry?

546
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,630
You don"t decide on such things
at night-time

547
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:44,232
I"ll arrange it with Lala tomorrow
and we"ll go to the priest then

548
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,639
""Very well, mother""

549
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:03,252
""You"re right, Lala.""
We are indeed very poor

550
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:08,662
""But I assure you, Kamli will be""
dearer to me than my daughter

551
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,664
She"ll rule my family.
- Rule indeed!

552
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:16,260
""Rule that dilapidated hut,""
with rags for beds?

553
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:21,273
And she"ll be queen to that wastrel
who hasn"t earned a penny till today!

554
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,978
Had Kamli been your daughter...

555
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,907
would you have married her
to a loafer like Nandu?

556
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:31,917
""Lala! You think he"s a loafer,""
but Nandu is my son

557
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,289
Silence! You dare talk back at me!

558
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,285
How dare you even bring
this proposal to me?

559
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,291
""Go away, or l"ll have you""
thrown out!

560
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,516
Mother...

561
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,819
""what happened, mother?""

562
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,323
What is the matter?
Won"t you tell me?

563
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:20,094
What do you want me to tell you?
How they treated your mother...

564
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:24,738
how she was slapped in the face
and humiliated?

565
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,333
""What are you talking about, Mother?""
What for?

566
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,339
Because my son is a wastrel and
hasn"t earned a penny on his own

567
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,145
The one I treat like
the apple of my eye...

568
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,356
is known as a loafer
in the whole village

569
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,888
Strange games destiny plays with me

570
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,768
Parents bring up their children
with such great hopes

571
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,773
They go through so many difficulties
to give them a good upbringing

572
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,780
They see such beautiful dreams...

573
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:10,041
that their sons will grow up
to be educated men...

574
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,378
and be a support in their old age

575
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,393
I had a dream for my son too

576
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:24,798
But I had to be humiliated
for my dream today

577
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,446
Where had you been? You haven"t
even eaten all day

578
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,846
Why aren"t you answering me?

579
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,464
Where are you going?

580
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,864
What"s happening here?
Where are you going?

581
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:41,139
""Are you angry with me, my son?""
""- No, Mother""

582
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:52,886
I"ve found a job. I"m leaving.
- Leaving...? Leaving me?

583
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,889
""l can"t help it, Mother.""
- No

584
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,495
You don"t have to take up the job.
I"m still alive

585
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:04,895
I"ll work hard to feed you.
- That"s just what I don"t want

586
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,510
I know I have hurt your feelings

587
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,911
I spoke so much of nonsense
in a fit of rage

588
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,507
""Forgive me, my son.""
""- Don"t make me feel guilty, Mother""

589
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,920
My heaven lies at your feet.
- So promise me...

590
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,524
that you"ll never leave me.
Promise me

591
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,517
""l"ve decided to leave, mother.""
- What for?

592
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:39,531
You feel so bad at what I said?
""- No, mother""

593
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:43,533
You did me a favour by telling me all
that. You opened my eyes to reality

594
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,038
I want to achieve something now.

595
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,205
So you can proudly hold your
head high in the future

596
01:10:55,584 --> 01:11:00,180
""Please don"t go away, my son...""
I can"t live without you

597
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,557
Please don"t leave me

598
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,956
""Don"t be upset, mother.""
l"ll come back soon

599
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,567
My son...

600
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,971
Meet him once before
""he leaves, Kamli""

601
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,575
How can I even face him?

602
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,579
My uncle treated his mother
so badly

603
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,983
What will Nandu think of me?
- He holds no grudge against you

604
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,984
Come with me

605
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,589
Come

606
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:53,006
""Kamli, where are you going?""
Come on inside

607
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:21,625
I can"t see Kamli"s suffering.
She thinks you"re angry with her

608
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:26,035
""You"re not angry with her, are you?""
- Whom am I to be angry with her?

609
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,634
""For God"s sake, don"t break her
heart.""
She loves you very much

610
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,646
You mean the world to her.
She lives only for you

611
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,049
Farida!
""- lt"s true, Nandu""

612
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,050
""Whatever happens, she"ll wait for
you.""
I hope you return soon...

613
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:45,650
with lots of money to
silence her greedy uncle

614
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,663
""Farida, you have really""
given me courage

615
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,659
I will surely return.
And very soon

616
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,105
Heard the latest?
- What?

617
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,040
Another group of soldiers has arrived.
- Where are they?

618
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,712
In the barracks next to ours

619
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,724
Oh yes!

620
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,760
No...

621
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,164
You...?
- Nandu!

622
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,161
""Whenever shoes are stolen,""
be sure you"re around!

623
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,169
And you come along to spoil
the show for me everywhere!

624
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,170
How long have you been here?
- A year

625
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,774
A year? The training
is only 6 months

626
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,776
The Commander made me stay back.
- Have you passed?

627
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,402
""No, l"ve failed""

628
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,784
That"s the bugle... hurry up!
- My shoes!

629
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,182
""Sorry, but hurry up""

630
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:04,197
You"ll be taught to stand to attention
and stand-easy positions

631
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:15,208
""To revert to your earlier position,""
this is what you"ll do

632
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,816
You will now practice this step

633
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,643
You"ve put on weight.
Do some exercises

634
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,933
You"re getting engaged
""today, my child""

635
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:20,935
But...

636
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:28,932
I am told that you don"t approve
of the proposal l"ve brought

637
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,945
""My child, I have brought you up""
like my own daughter

638
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,352
I have always cared
for your happiness

639
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,352
""And even today, I want""
you to be happy

640
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,950
""lf you don"t approve of this
alliance,""
it"s okay. I"ll refuse them

641
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:53,357
I accepted the alliance because
it would make your life easier

642
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,303
""Besides, we can also repay the loans""
your father and I had accrued

643
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,977
But you needn"t care for me.
My house will be auctioned

644
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:06,379
What will I do with the house
when I don"t have any respect?

645
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:10,974
But at least you will be happy
and that is what I want

646
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:17,381
Even if I have to commit suicide.
- Uncle...

647
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,987
I have told you the truth.
You are a wise girl

648
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,999
I don"t want to put any sort
of pressure on you...

649
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,163
I leave the decision
""to you, my child""

650
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:07,441
You have put in a lot of hard work
in the last six months of training

651
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:12,437
You are on a leave of
21 days from today

652
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:19,443
Those of you who want to go home
can visit your folks

653
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:28,051
Aren"t you coming?
- Who do I have there?

654
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,065
You go on.
- What will you do here?

655
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,469
I"ll take my orders
and proceed to the regiment

656
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:39,063
I"ll spend my vacations there.
- Could you give me my shirt?

657
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,477
Can"t you pick it up on your own?
- Aren"t you my friend?

658
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,477
Friend indeed! You"re always
ordering me around

659
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,480
Hurry up.
- This is not fair

660
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,487
Lovely knife... may I keep it?

661
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,490
""Oh, get lost. This isn"t a knife,""
it"s my life

662
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,492
I"m your life too.
- How come?

663
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,099
You"re my buddy.
- Wow!

664
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,103
""So long, feller.""
- Go on

665
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:10,171
Listen...

666
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,772
""you"re returning, aren"t you?""
- Sure

667
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,500
""Don"t lie to me. He"s a liar,""
he"s always fibbing

668
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:18,513
""And look at me, l"m not""
even taking a holiday

669
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,122
See you at the regiment

670
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:36,119
Nandu! Give my regards to your mother.
- Sure

671
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,534
Convey my regards to Uncle Vilayati

672
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,473
Hey Nandu! Listen...

673
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,475
""Give that to me, uncle""

674
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,157
So you"re back!

675
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:16,162
""Hold this, let me play""
a prank on your mother

676
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,163
Sister-in-law...
""- What is it, Khairati?""

677
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,172
I want to ask you something.
- what?

678
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:27,178
What do you love most in the world?
- What a silly question

679
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:31,584
I love nothing more than my son Nandu.
- Suppose I brandish a wand...

680
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:36,187
and produce Nandu right here?
""- You aren"t drunk, are you?""

681
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:40,589
Try the magic on yourself first
""- Listen to me, sis-in-law...""

682
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,197
My son!
- Mother

683
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,199
My darling son!

684
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,610
Wow! You do look like a gentleman

685
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:01,613
You scared me!

686
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:07,616
You really look human now.
- Uncle...

687
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,624
here you are.
- What is it for?

688
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,558
Your fare

689
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,629
You pay me fare?
Aren"t you ashamed?

690
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:21,629
""You just said he looks human,""
but he"s still an animal!

691
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,371
He pays me fare.
- Uncle...

692
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,568
""forgive me, uncle.""
- Forgive you?

693
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,641
""lf I were angry, l"d have""
given you a slap!

694
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,250
What are you staring at me for?
Pick up your stuff and go in

695
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,647
And listen... come to
the liquor den this evening

696
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,280
""Nice day you"ve arrived, son.""
Today"s the festival of Diwali

697
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,676
Great! I"ll bring a lot of
firecrackers. We"ll have fun

698
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,284
Where are you going?
- l"ll be back soon

699
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,284
Listen... Nandu...

700
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:24,799
Aunt...

701
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,696
What is it?
- Has Nandu returned?

702
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,930
""Yes, and he went out immediately.""
- That"s terrible

703
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,307
I wonder what will happen now

704
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,314
Listen...
- God!

705
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,310
Is Lalaji in there?
- They"ve gone out

706
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,976
Everyone?
""- No, Kamli"s upstairs""

707
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:46,380
""l"ve looked for you everywhere,""
and you"re hiding here?

708
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,782
""Take a look, Kamli.""
l"ve returned so soon

709
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,388
Why aren"t you talking to me?
Look at me

710
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,788
Like my uniform?

711
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,794
I"m a big man now.
I earn a huge salary

712
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:08,391
Nobody can snatch you from me anymore.
Hey... what happened?

713
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:12,796
Are you angry with me?
Look... what l"ve got for you

714
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,404
Won"t you talk to me?
All right

715
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,039
Are you engaged?

716
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,428
Yes

717
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,830
I"m engaged

718
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:41,833
Can"t you see...?

719
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,065
the shawl of silk?

720
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,580
Where have you been?
I"ve been waiting for you...

721
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:12,576
to come and light the first lamp.
""The house is so dark, Nandu""

722
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,013
""Let the darkness remain, Mother""

723
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,601
""Put out the lamp, mother""

724
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:40,614
I can understand how
""hurt you are, my son""

725
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,611
I know what you"ve been through

726
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:51,020
But that doesn"t mean
a man must give up hope in life

727
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:56,619
Man is lost in the darkness
""of his sorrow, mother""

728
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,923
""Don"t say such things, my son.""
Do not be disheartened

729
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:04,631
I"ll bring you a bride
better than her

730
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,639
Bride...? For me?

731
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:15,047
You"ve drunk again?
""- Yes, mother""

732
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:22,645
I"ve had liquor today. Lots of it.
For my broken heart

733
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,057
Coward! Has liquor ever put
a broken heart together?

734
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,992
I feel ashamed to say
that you"re my son

735
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,664
""Don"t talk like that, mother.""
- I will!

736
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:38,062
You have hurt my feelings.
You are not my son!

737
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:42,666
""Mother... kill me, mother!""

738
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:51,345
But don"t ever that l"m
not your son. Mother...

739
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,096
""Greetings, aunt.""
""- May you live long, my child""

740
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:11,330
""You"re cooking great things, I see?""
- My son has returned after many days

741
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:14,105
Mustn"t I make even so much?
- Why not?

742
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:17,108
Where is Nandu?
- He came late last night

743
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:20,404
He"s still sleeping.
- l"ll go and wake him up

744
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,118
How long will you sleep?
Wake up

745
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:34,528
Aunt!

746
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:37,128
What happened?

747
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:41,034
What is the matter?
Why are you crying?

748
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,737
What letter is this...?
I can"t read

749
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,741
Where"s Nandu?
""- He has gone away, aunt""

750
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,736
Gone away...? Without
even meeting me?

751
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,781
No... that"s impossible

752
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:01,744
Nandu... my son!

753
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:16,167
""Listen, l"m a new recruit.""
Where do I report?

754
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,772
Meet the Havaldar in
the quarters there

755
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,216
Havaldar saheb...

756
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,193
Go to the office and report
to the Company Commander

757
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:45,126
""Where is the office, sir?""
- On the left. Fifth room

758
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:56,207
""Hello, Ram Singh.""
- Kulwant Singh! Welcome

759
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,207
You"re all set

760
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,144
You look very eager to leave
for your marriage

761
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,214
Not at all. I"ve got to make
arrangements there

762
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,216
How many days are you on leave?
- Few days

763
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,344
Leaving by this evening"s train?
""- Yes, at 4""

764
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:11,817
Don"t forget to bring
your marriage-sweets for me

765
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:13,826
Certainly.
- God bless you

766
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,833
Nandu! Great to have you back!

767
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:24,570
How did you return early?
Why aren"t you answering my question?

768
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:27,007
What"s wrong?
What have I done?

769
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,644
""Nandu, tell me...""
what wrong have I done?

770
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,176
What"s gotten into you?

771
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:42,247
""lf you"re angry with me, here you
are.""
Slipper me

772
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,848
But at least talk to me.
...so you won"t?

773
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:48,259
All right. Don"t talk

774
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,869
Your folks all right?
- Yes

775
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:03,272
Khairati Uncle must still be
""plying his horse-cart, eh?""

776
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:11,283
Aunt! How I miss her!
She used to make terrific yogurt-shake

777
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,890
I"m the only one talking...
am I out of my mind?

778
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:21,289
""Don"t talk to me, it"s all right.""
- Listen...

779
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,897
What is it?

780
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,303
Here you are.
- The knife? You"re giving it to me?

781
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:33,304
But you loved it so much.
""- Yes, I did""

782
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:47,315
What one loves need not
necessarily be with him always

783
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,358
Kamli... open the door

784
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,122
""Open the door, my child""

785
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:35,959
""lt"s me, Kamli...""
open the door

786
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:40,637
""lt"s me here, Kamli...""

787
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:47,379
""Kamli dear, open the door""
- What is the matter?

788
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:51,977
Kamli isn"t opening the door.
What am I to do?

789
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,986
The bridegroom has arrived.
- Go on downstairs...

790
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:56,983
I"ll bring her there

791
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:06,993
""Open the door, my dear""

792
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:12,005
""Open the door, my child.""
""lt"s me, Nandu"s mother""

793
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,407
Open the door

794
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,183
Open the door

795
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,355
""Kamli, my child...""

796
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,437
I know your predicament

797
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,439
But there are times in the
life of a woman...

798
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:59,052
when she does not know
what to do

799
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:04,057
I know what a severe test
you are being put to

800
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:12,461
""But may I say something, my child?""
There is great peace in giving

801
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,059
If your sacrifice is going
to break a heart...

802
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:20,073
""but save the honour of many,""
my child...

803
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:23,477
Iet him be heart-broken

804
01:36:57,778 --> 01:37:00,508
""Look, my child. I have brought""
a bridal-dress for you

805
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:06,518
""Many years ago, a little girl""
came to my house...

806
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:09,122
and I promised her...

807
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:17,797
I couldn"t make her my daughter-in-law
and take her to my house

808
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,529
But God is kind. He gives me
the pride...

809
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:27,129
of seeing off my daughter today.
- Aunt!

810
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,550
""Get ready quickly, my child""

811
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,285
I"m not keeping well

812
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:08,867
""My respects, aunt.""
""- May you live long, my child""

813
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:12,238
Why are you sad? What
are you thinking about?

814
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:16,639
My heart was divided in two parts

815
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:24,249
""One left me, and the other...""
I entrusted to another man

816
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:27,650
""Do not be disheartened, aunt.""
This is all a matter of destiny

817
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:34,661
""True, my child. Had I been fortunate,""
I wouldn"t have seen this day

818
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:37,270
Haven"t you lit the oven today?

819
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,275
For whom will I light it?
- Aunt...

820
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,274
""if you keep crying like this,""
you"re going to fall sick

821
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,409
I"ll get some food for you

822
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:01,957
I wonder what"s gotten
into Nandu nowadays

823
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:06,288
""Yes, he"s an absolutely changed man.""
He fights over everything

824
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:10,296
We nearly got into a brawl yesterday.
- You"re always fighting with everyone

825
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:14,305
With everyone around!
- You"re Nandu"s old friend

826
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:19,709
""Hi, Nandu. Come on...""
- Who are you talking about? Forget it

827
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:24,316
""He always wears a long face, as if""
his fiance has eloped with someone

828
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,336
Not me... what have I done?

829
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,972
What"s happening here?
""- lt"s the Havaldar, Nandu!""

830
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,514
Why"re you hitting him?

831
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,350
You"re the one l"m talking to
Answer me!

832
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:01,349
I have nothing to say.
- Really? Come with me

833
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:04,350
I"ll teach you a lesson for
breaking the discipline. Come!

834
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:10,561
The Company Commander gives you
2 hours of extra duty

835
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:12,659
You"ll do that right now

836
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,189
""l don"t have any right to say this,""
but you are an able soldier...

837
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:50,598
and the army has hopes pinned on you.
Your behaviour is therefore very wrong

838
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:57,708
I have received a telegram.
Your mother is ill

839
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:27,638
""Nothing to worry about, is there?""
""- No, she"s all right""

840
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:31,034
But remember one thing.
She must not receive any shock

841
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:35,647
She"s very weak at heart. And give
her the medicines l"ve prescribed

842
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:43,647
Sensational news!
Japan launches an attack

843
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,658
The Japanese are quickly advancing.
- The war is hotting up

844
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:54,256
What happened?
- The Japanese have bombed Singapore

845
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:56,060
Thousands have been killed

846
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:58,931
Our country is in danger
of being attacked too

847
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:52,719
""Nandu, mother has sent food for you.""
Come and eat it quickly

848
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,726
""No, l"m not hungry.""
- My son...

849
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:01,323
""go and eat, my son. You haven"t""
eaten anything all night

850
01:44:01,702 --> 01:44:03,727
""Go on, son. Eat""

851
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:14,343
""How are you now, aunt?""
""- l"m all right, my dear""

852
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:17,349
The two of you have taken
such good care of me

853
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:21,351
I"ve done nothing. Nandu was the
one who was always at work

854
01:44:21,888 --> 01:44:23,753
God will bless you for this

855
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:27,023
The doctor says you must
eat a lot of fruits

856
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:30,761
""Farida, could you come here please?""
""- Take a look, dear...""

857
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:33,366
""he isn"t short of bread, is he?""

858
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,369
""What is it, Nandu...?""
Haven"t you eaten yet?

859
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:45,369
""l"m terribly worried, Farida.""
I don"t know what to do

860
01:44:45,746 --> 01:44:48,374
What is it about? Your mother
is absolutely all right

861
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:51,707
It isn"t about her.
I must return immediately

862
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:56,386
But you arrived only four days ago.
- My leave has been cancelled

863
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,790
I"ve received a wire to
report to Ambala immediately

864
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:03,723
What for?
- Maybe l"ll have to leave for war

865
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:07,060
For the war...? What are
you talking about?

866
01:45:07,734 --> 01:45:10,396
Have you considered what
will happen of your mother?

867
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,797
That"s just what is
making me nervous

868
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:19,803
""Farida, I have no one but you...""
- No

869
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:27,080
I"m an enemy to you. I can"t
do this anymore. Not anymore

870
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:39,126
""l understand, Farida. If mother gets""
""to know that l"m going to war, she...""

871
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:43,835
""What crisis is this, Allah?""
What happens now?

872
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:47,838
""However you do it, you will""
have to hide it from mother

873
01:45:48,475 --> 01:45:50,841
She must never get to know that
l"ve gone to the battlefield

874
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:54,842
""Farida, he isn"t short of bread is
he?""
""- No, aunt""

875
01:45:57,651 --> 01:45:59,846
Go and sit with mother

876
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:34,475
Where are you going
in that uniform?

877
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:38,487
""My leave is over, mother.""
l"ve got to return

878
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:42,893
I haven"t even had enough time
with you and you"ve got to return?

879
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:47,889
""This time l"ll return soon, mother.""
""- Do that, my son""

880
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:51,129
Take a leave of at least
a month the next time

881
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:54,070
""Certainly, mother""

882
01:46:56,543 --> 01:46:58,511
I must leave now

883
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:01,510
May God protect you

884
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:04,512
May you live long

885
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:18,531
""What is the matter, son?""
Why have you stopped?

886
01:47:19,065 --> 01:47:23,525
""l don"t know, mother. I don"t""
feel like leaving you

887
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:28,940
""l understand, my son. But you"re""
not going away forever

888
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:34,536
""Farida, are you crying there?""
""- No, aunt""

889
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:38,539
""Don"t cry, my child.""
Nandu will return soon

890
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:03,565
""Aunt, may I see Nandu off?""
""- Of course, dear. Go on""

891
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:12,984
I think of the hardships you have
""to put up with, for my sake""

892
01:48:16,122 --> 01:48:20,582
But I have no one except you.
I"m leaving mother in your care

893
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:23,262
Do look after her

894
01:48:25,632 --> 01:48:27,600
I must leave now

895
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:34,004
I know Kamli has hurt
""you a lot, Nandu""

896
01:48:35,141 --> 01:48:39,009
""But Allah knows, she"s innocent""

897
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:43,373
Her greedy uncle inflicted
so many atrocities on her

898
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:47,017
He threatened her that if she
did not agree to the wedding...

899
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:54,617
he would commit suicide. On one hand
was her world and her dreams...

900
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:58,624
on the other was the fear
of her family being ruined

901
01:48:59,332 --> 01:49:01,630
What can a girl do after all?

902
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:05,297
""For the sake of her family,""
she sacrificed her own happiness

903
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:13,635
""l understand her difficulties,
Farida.""
Maybe this is what was pre-destined

904
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,676
May Allah protect you

905
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:50,080
""l feel as if, in the next birth...""

906
01:51:22,809 --> 01:51:25,778
How is your mother?
- She"s fine

907
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:28,171
She misses you very much

908
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:36,186
""Nandu, you"re back?""
How"s your mother?

909
01:51:36,823 --> 01:51:37,790
She"s fine

910
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,453
This is my wife

911
01:51:46,332 --> 01:51:50,200
""Nandu, she"s greeting you.""
""- The Major wants you, Havaldar""

912
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,310
Nandu...

913
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:08,816
you"re leaving for war

914
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:14,485
Do look after yourself.
And...

915
01:52:16,362 --> 01:52:17,829
And?

916
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:21,834
And look after my husband

917
01:52:58,538 --> 01:53:06,274
Ask the soldier that leaves...
""where he is going?""""""

918
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:31,301
Love kills life...

919
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:36,907
in blood is written
""its story""""""

920
01:53:43,516 --> 01:53:47,919
Memories of the
""innocent childhood...""""""

921
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:53,325
haunt a shortlived youth

922
01:53:54,127 --> 01:53:59,326
""Ask the soldier that leaves,""
""where he is going?""""""

923
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:27,357
Everything around is cautious...

924
01:54:28,628 --> 01:54:32,359
everyone walks in fear

925
01:54:39,339 --> 01:54:43,366
Youth is being slain...

926
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:48,977
everything is reddened
""in blood""""""

927
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:56,386
""Ask the soldier that leaves,""
""where he is going""""""

who is it that consoles
""her hungry children?""""""

The stench of burning bodies...

makes life worse
""than hell""""""
