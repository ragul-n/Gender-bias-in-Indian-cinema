00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:07,444
You Tube search name - Anarkali - 1953

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:26,790
Blow gently, oh Easterly...

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,060
for Anarkali rests here

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,620
With dreams of Salim in her eyes,
Anarkali rests here

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,380
This is the tomb of those
martyred for love

7
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,970
Blow with respect
while you are here, oh breeze

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,910
Maybe you forget

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,210
I remember her story

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,900
I still remember the moment...

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,260
when she attracted his eye

12
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,050
Her beauty stood against the Taj

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,270
Their love stood up
to the regime

14
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,270
Salim said, with all his love...

15
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,310
to his beloved Anarkali...

16
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,210
I shall bring the stars
for you, if you so wish

17
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,570
I shall abdicate, if you so wish

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,800
What winds were they
that blew then?

19
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,090
Salim is no more,
nor is Anarkali

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,620
But this tomb bears testimony
to their love

21
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,570
Of their labor of love

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,360
Waiting for the bee...

23
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:44,850
lies here the bud of
the pomegranate tree

24
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,530
Blow gently, oh Easterly

25
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,860
Not every memorial to love
is a Taj Mahal.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,430
This tomb is a tear
from the eyes of lovers...

27
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,620
that the world's contempt has
not been able to destroy.

28
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,290
As someone once said...

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,490
these ruins have seen Spring earlier.

30
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,540
The one who rests here was once
the spirit of the Spring.

31
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,210
She fell in love with Salim,
taking him to be only a soldier.

32
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,430
Little did she know that the soldier
was the crown prince of Hindustan.

33
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,160
True life is his...

34
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,510
who gives himself up
to someone else...

35
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,550
and loses himself in love

36
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,370
This Spring, this moment...

37
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,470
asks us to fall in love...

38
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:50,770
to make our hearts
pine for the beloved

39
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,620
Life is unfaithful...

40
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,660
so enjoy the pleasures of love,
while you can

41
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,020
True life is his...

42
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,500
who gives himself up
to someone else...

43
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,670
and loses himself in love

44
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,930
My heart is pounding,
but that is all right

45
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,150
Do not keep a count

46
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,420
When again will we have
such times for ourselves?

47
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,220
When again will we enjoy
such lovely nights and days?

48
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,430
I implore you...

49
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,460
to give yourself up
to the pleasure of the moment

50
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,890
True life is his...

51
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,290
who gives himself up
to someone else...

52
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,530
and loses himself in love

53
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,670
Splendid!

54
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,980
Was that a voice or the mesmerizing
song of a nightingale?

55
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,170
Follow me. I must see who
this beautiful girl is...

56
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,300
whose voice has
enthralled Emperor Akbar.

57
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,570
Who are you?

58
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,340
Who are you? Who?

59
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,200
I beg your pardon for
appearing without notice.

60
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,910
- How was I to know...
- What brings you here?

61
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,960
I did not come on my own. It was
your voice that drew me here.

62
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,240
I'd like you to sing
the same song again.

63
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,920
Why must I sing it?
Sing the song again.

64
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,436
Beware, lady!

65
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,130
You ask a girl to sing a song
and even flex your muscles?

66
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,850
- Aren't you ashamed?
- I seek forgiveness on his behalf.

67
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,320
Indeed! You consider yourself
royalty and look down on me!

68
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,090
As if you are an Emperor!

69
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,390
What can I say to you?

70
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,200
- Go away!
- What if I refuse to leave?

71
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,300
- I'll have to report you.
- To whom?

72
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,200
To Emperor Akbar.
I'll ask him to punish you.

73
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,140
Please don't do that.
I fear Akbar's sense of justice.

74
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,240
- Your Majesty...
- What news do you bring?

75
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,190
We've looked everywhere for
Prince Salim, at your behest.

76
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,890
But I wasn't fortunate enough
to catch a glimpse of him.

77
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,430
Wherever he is,
take my orders to him.

78
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,530
Mercy, Emperor! Mercy!

79
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,080
I've committed a blunder!
I've been insolent, Your Majesty

80
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,380
I am pleased with you, girl.
Very pleased.

81
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,210
- You don't mind singing now, do you?
- How will I sing?

82
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,610
Why not?

83
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,850
It's not I who sings.
It's my love that sings.

84
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,700
It isn't I who dances. It's my heart
that dances for someone.

85
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,230
And that can happen only when
my beloved is with me.

86
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,790
Your love is indeed laudable.
It is so sacred.

87
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,040
Does your beloved
love you as much, too?

88
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,690
- Much more.
- No.

89
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,370
- It's true, Your Majesty. He does.
- His is a weak love.

90
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,340
- He's selfish.
- His is a selfless, sacred love.

91
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,510
- Do you know why he left?
- No, Your Majesty.

92
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,000
He was scared of me.
So he ran away.

93
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,550
If the fear of you
can scare him away...

94
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,860
my love can bring him back, too.

95
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,990
Losers never return.

96
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Do not challenge
those in love, Emperor.

97
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,890
You will lose the bet.

98
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:01,960
May the sanctity of love
be preserved

99
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,070
Come to me

100
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:14,970
If you do not return...

101
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,680
love...

102
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,410
might have to hang
its head in shame...

103
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,510
before the world

104
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,220
So, come to me, my love

105
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,680
Come to me, oh sweetheart

106
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,570
Let's prove to the world
the power love wields

107
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,080
Let's lay the world
at the feet of our love

108
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,490
Come to me, oh love.
Come to me, sweetheart

109
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,310
You'll have to come to indulge me

110
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,500
You have loved me.
You must keep every promise

111
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,110
Let's even stake our lives
for the sake of our love

112
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,950
Let's lay the world
at the feet of our love

113
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,340
Come to me, oh love.
Come to me, sweetheart

114
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,010
Let's face every storm
of love together

115
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,410
Break every shackle and norm
to return to me

116
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,980
If you are a true lover,
give up everything for your love

117
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,060
Let's lay the world
at the feet of our love

118
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,400
Come to me, oh love.
Come to me, sweetheart

119
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,380
My beloved is afraid.
He waits somewhere

120
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,600
Somewhere in the recesses of royalty
lies hidden my love

121
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,580
Make royalty itself
bow to our love

122
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,160
Come to me, my love

123
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,220
Let's make royalty bow to us

124
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,010
Come to me, my love

125
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,030
He's here!
The lord of my music is here!

126
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,770
My love has won!
My love has triumphed!

127
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,980
- Where is he?
- Right before my eyes.

128
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,610
Didn't I tell you, Emperor?
Do not challenge those in love.

129
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,070
You have lost, Emperor!
You have lost!

130
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,700
I will gladly accept defeat.

131
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,850
But can you prove your
beloved's presence here?

132
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,880
This is the hand that
lovingly touches me.

133
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,230
These are the feet I kiss.

134
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,420
- Do you believe me now, Emperor?
- Oh yes, I do.

135
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:12,050
Someone who cowers in such fear
can only be your beloved.

136
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,760
You must bow before
true love, Emperor.

137
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,880
Love has triumphed today.
And you have been defeated.

138
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,350
I bow my head, girl.
And the whole of Hindustan...

139
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,180
bows to your sacred love.

140
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,460
For the first time in my life,
I have been humbled today.

141
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,140
I realize that there is a power
even greater than the throne.

142
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,670
The power of love.

143
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,170
I shall give you a reward today.
As long as the world exists...

144
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,190
as long as the name of
the Moghuls lives...

145
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,420
as long as the names of Babar, Humayun,
Akbar and Akbar's courtiers live...

146
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,990
your name shall also
be remembered by all.

147
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,210
Seek! What do you want?

148
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,030
The pomegranate flower, Emperor.

149
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,219
Bless you! Had you wished, you could
have sought Hindustan's treasures...

150
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,600
or even my empire from me!
But you sought something that is...

151
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,760
far more beautiful and immortal
than wealth and power!

152
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,560
And I shall bestow upon you
the wealth, girl.

153
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,239
I give you the title
of the Pomegranate Flower.

154
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,310
You shall be known by this name
for as long as the world exists.

155
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,890
And people shall admire
my tastes for the fine arts.

156
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,100
- Long live the Pomegranate Flower.
- Long live the Pomegranate Flower.

157
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,370
Long live Emperor Akbar.
Long live the Moghul kingdom!

158
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,680
Do not go away, soldier.
Do not go away.

159
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,520
Stay right here.
I'll be back very soon.

160
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,880
- Really?
- Oh yes.

161
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,130
- You won't be late, will you?
- No.

162
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,080
I hope I don't keep
waiting for you and...

163
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,830
Don't you believe me?

164
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,610
I do, I do, soldier.

165
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,100
Go.

166
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,460
- May God protect you.
- May God protect you.

167
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,110
However, I always dread...

168
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,700
you are a soldier and I am a gypsy.

169
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,926
If we are separated, it will be
difficult for us to meet.

170
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,860
No, Nadira. That will never happen.

171
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,690
Until you return...

172
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,200
my eyes shall be waiting for you.

173
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,700
Go on, soldier. Go on.

174
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,470
Gulnar?

175
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,400
His Majesty is waiting for you.
He's angry.

176
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,810
That's what I've been
waiting here to tell you.

177
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm grateful to you.

178
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,720
To serve you, is my good fortune.

179
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,200
- Shekhu hasn't arrived yet, Queen.
- He should be here any moment.

180
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,490
- Your Majesty...
- Where have you been, Shekhu?

181
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,480
- What has happened to my child?
- I've suffered an injury, Mother

182
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,460
It's just a scratch.

183
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,370
You must never tell your mother
when you're hurt.

184
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,770
Mothers have weak hearts.

185
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,550
I regret, you could not
go out with me today.

186
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,260
I happened to see a miracle today.
A very strange thing.

187
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,080
Have you been to the
pomegranate gardens here?

188
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,060
Yes. Excuse me, Your Majesty?

189
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,630
Your Majesty?

190
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,920
- Raja Man Singh...
- Yes, Your Majesty?

191
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,640
I have just one son.
I yearn for him to call me father.

192
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,990
But he never seems to forget
that I am an Emperor.

193
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,960
Brother, is that the son's fault?
Or is it the father's?

194
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,760
I bring word to His Majesty.
The troops are ready.

195
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,960
Your Majesty, I await royal orders.

196
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,870
Raja Man Singh, I wish to send
Prince Salim with you...

197
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,930
- on your sojourn through Kabul.
- Father!

198
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,570
- Your Majesty.
- My Lord...

199
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,850
you have considered my son worthy...

200
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,320
of bearing the burden of the Empire
with you.

201
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,510
- My son has grown up today.
- Our son has grown up today, Queen.

202
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,010
It's going to be a very
difficult journey, Your Majesty.

203
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,030
When there are other daring men,
why risk the heir to the throne?

204
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,680
However difficult the journey
is going to be...

205
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,510
to keep one's own son
safely protected...

206
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,790
while others brave the odds,
is an act of selfishness.

207
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,240
I can make no concessions
to myself.

208
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,300
Before winning over nations...

209
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,810
Emperors have to first
strengthen their hearts.

210
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,040
Very well. My son shall go the
battlefield and display his valor.

211
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,530
- You will, won't you, son?
- Mother...

212
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,440
He certainly will.

213
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,820
Soldier!

214
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,730
Soldier!

215
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,800
Soldier

216
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,200
Where are you, soldier?

217
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,800
Where are you?

218
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,240
Desires met with disappointment.

219
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,130
There was the caravan of
Anarkali's shattered joys...

220
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,670
and the never-ending search
following the separation.

221
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,630
The caravan wound its way through
the hills, across the deserts...

222
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,210
and soon crossed the borders
of the empire.

223
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,520
If Anarkali pined here...

224
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,090
Salim was in agony,
tormented by the separation.

225
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,040
One night...

226
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,030
A golden bird!
Grab her!

227
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,820
Far away from Hindustan,
across the border...

228
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,120
watching this sickening sight
of perverted men...

229
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,710
there rose in Anarkali's heart
a cry for her beloved.

230
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,580
As they say, a heart reaches
out to a heart.

231
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,710
Perhaps her agonizing cry would
reach Salim's heart.

232
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,260
Was I saying anything wrong?

233
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,080
Now listen to the mesmerising
songs of this nightingale...

234
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,830
and watch her tantalizing dance.
She is incomparable.

235
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,600
She is beyond compare
in the whole world!

236
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,920
Dance... and show your admirers
your beauty.

237
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,870
You won't sing?

238
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,470
Come to me...

239
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,460
come at least now

240
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,320
Come to me, save me

241
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,080
You who will buy my destiny,
come to me

242
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,800
Come to me, save me

243
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,580
You who will buy my destiny,
come to me

244
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:37,790
Love is on auction
in the market place

245
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,270
Come to me

246
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,200
Everyone makes his bid,
his eyes filled with lust

247
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,040
But I belong to you,
although the world does not know

248
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,960
The cruel ones who bid for me are
naively deceived. Come to me

249
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,050
Come to me, save me

250
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,240
You who will buy my destiny,
come to me

251
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,800
My youth is full of desire,
beauty and charm

252
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:44,660
Wondrous dreams fill my heart

253
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:18,010
My world is about to be shattered,
come to me

254
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,870
Come to me, save me

255
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,540
You who will buy my destiny,
come to me

256
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,820
Name the price, gentlemen.

257
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,670
- One thousand.
- Two thousand.

258
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,420
- Three thousand. - Four.
- Five. - Six. - Ten thousand.

259
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,460
- 15 thousand.
- 15 thousand?

260
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,270
For this beauty from paradise,
just 15,000?

261
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,820
Either a king knows the worth
of a pearl, or its finder.

262
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,380
15,000, once.
15,000, twice.

263
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,720
50,000!

264
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,620
- 60,000!
- 70,000!

265
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,760
- 80,000!
- 100,000!

266
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,610
- 110,000!
- 200,000!

267
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,820
200,000? Only 200,000
for this beauty from paradise?

268
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,440
Where are those who admire beauty?
Where are those with large hearts?

269
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,210
200,000!
200,000, going once.

270
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,830
200,000 twice.
Sold for 200,000!

271
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,790
Welcome, sir.

272
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,230
This way, please.

273
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,290
Let me go! Leave me alone!

274
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,100
My daughter!

275
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,800
- Have you seen my daughter?
- No, who is she?

276
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,700
My daughter, Nadira. The one to whom
the Emperor gave the title of Anarkali.

277
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,390
- The Emperor?
- He gave your daughter a title?

278
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,150
She's out of her mind.

279
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,420
Feeling shy? All right.

280
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,240
Your lovely voice...

281
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,770
your eyes that are
lowered with modesty...

282
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,380
your beauty, your youthfulness...

283
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,500
you are incomparable!

284
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,560
No, let me go!

285
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,310
Mercy! Have mercy on me!

286
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,920
Why? Have I inflicted
any tyranny on you?

287
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,440
I have spent so much money on you.
To save you...

288
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,170
I've taken on a dozen men. All alone.
I didn't even care for my life

289
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,890
I won't have you sin.
I will marry you.

290
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,820
Do you agree?

291
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:19,670
I wish you knew. A woman takes the
hand of only one man in her lifetime.

292
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,640
He's the one she worships,
after God.

293
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,580
- Nice excuse you've found to escape.
- Please don't think it's an excuse.

294
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,800
If you don't believe in my love,
you might as well strangle me.

295
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,220
You will see that in every cry of
agony, I will cry for my beloved.

296
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,490
Every word you utter is as
beautiful as your body.

297
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,840
But it has no effect.

298
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,010
If your love is true, why does
it not strike my heart?

299
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,899
Lord Almighty...

300
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,110
you are the protector
of those in love.

301
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,499
Have mercy on me.

302
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,070
Show me the light, Lord.
Show me the light.

303
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,720
What is love?

304
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,630
You shall know when
you fall in love

305
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:52,620
When you shed tears,
when you smile for love

306
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,630
The firefly burns...

307
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,980
but for what does he burn?

308
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,660
If you must know the secret...

309
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:33,300
you should burn
in the fires of love

310
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:40,670
Do not ask me
what my love offers me

311
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,850
It's a flame
that I hide in my heart

312
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:24,350
With love in my heart,
with my desires...

313
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,890
I have brought the wilderness alive

314
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,960
Do not ask me
what my love offers me

315
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,970
That which the world
looks forward to destroying...

316
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:14,430
is a memory I hold to my bosom

317
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:27,840
Do not ask me
what my love offers me

318
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:00,690
I swear it on my love, to those
that look at me with lustful eyes

319
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,140
It is the sweet ache of love
for which I've forgotten the world

320
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,990
Do not ask me
what my love offers me

321
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,380
Enough, Anar, enough!

322
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:33,330
My Anar,
I'm your soldier! It's me!

323
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,670
I'm back!

324
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,320
Soldier!

325
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,850
- Raja saheb...
- Follow me quietly.

326
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,750
- Raja saheb...
- Your absence...

327
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,850
and what I saw here
cannot be forgiven.

328
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,040
She's the girl upon whom the Emperor
bestowed the title of Anarkali.

329
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,220
- There's no need to say anything more.
- Mercy on our innocent love!

330
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,720
Look at her. She's asleep after days
of waiting for me.

331
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,830
For the sake of my love, she has
endured so many atrocities.

332
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,580
Have mercy on us, Raja saheb!

333
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,770
An empire runs not on mercy.
It runs on laws.

334
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,460
- The law is your prerogative.
- And the Emperor's justice?

335
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,830
- You can reason with him.
- How about my duties?

336
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,720
- And what is your duty?
- To take you away from here.

337
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,620
- Should I refuse to go?
- You will be arrested!

338
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,420
And this girl who has driven
you to rebel will be killed.

339
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,976
In that case, you will
take me dead. Not alive!

340
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
- Prince! This is a rebellion!
- This is the justice of love!

341
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,176
- Don't compel me to fight back!
- You are doing that!

342
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,876
Raja Man Singh won't tolerate rebellion!

343
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,220
And I can't bear to see my
beloved being separated from me!

344
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,210
Soldiers! Arrest him!

345
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,510
Take him away!
Go on.

346
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,600
Soldier!

347
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,780
Where are you, soldier?
Where are you?

348
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,100
Nargis!

349
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,560
I can't live without him!
I can't!

350
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,220
Soldier!

351
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,980
A strange unconsciousness.
This medicine never fails.

352
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,290
May God protect him.
His face is drained.

353
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,380
- His pulse is weakening.
- So do something, physician.

354
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,750
Find a medicine to bring him
to consciousness.

355
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,750
All my medicines have failed,
Your Highness.

356
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,470
No medicine can bring him
back to consciousness.

357
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,130
That cannot be true!
It is not true!

358
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,860
There must surely be a medicine?
A cure?

359
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,230
I am helpless, Your Majesty.

360
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,330
To bring the Prince back to consciousness
is beyond my capacity.

361
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,280
Are you telling me that Shekhu
will never regain consciousness?

362
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,010
The medicines have all been tried.
The patient now needs prayers.

363
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,150
- Raja Man Singh...
- Your Majesty?

364
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,460
Arrange for charity immediately.

365
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,510
Give away all the royal treasure
to the poor and the orphans.

366
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,460
Release all prisoners,
also those sentenced to death.

367
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,580
Implore everyone to beg for
the life of Prince Salim.

368
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,750
Ask the Hindus to pray in temples.
Ask Muslims to offer prayers.

369
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,180
Ask our subjects to beg for
the life of their crown prince!

370
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,820
True life is his...

371
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,230
who gives himself up
to someone else...

372
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,090
and loses himself in love

373
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,420
Lord, my son is regaining consciousness.

374
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,010
That very voice...

375
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,040
It's the magic of that very voice!
Let her in!

376
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,370
Come immediately.
The Emperor has sent for you.

377
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,870
Anarkali!

378
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,040
Lord!

379
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,390
Thanks to your voice, the Prince
has seen a ray of hope.

380
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,020
You have perhaps appeared
in answer to our prayers.

381
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,200
As an errand of mercy,
save my son's life!

382
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,840
- Delay it no more! Please!
- Please come, Anarkali.

383
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:46,440
Having heard your voice, my son
has called me Mother after ages.

384
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,830
Maybe you will give my son
back to me.

385
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,520
I am helpless! Give me back
the one I live for, Anarkali.

386
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,940
Sing, Anarkali. Please sing.

387
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,730
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

388
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:14,050
Pray to God

389
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:29,550
Spread your hands in
helplessness and despair

390
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,740
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

391
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,900
Appeal to God

392
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:50,050
Let lightning not strike
these palaces

393
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:55,370
Let it instead
strike my humble abode

394
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,710
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

395
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,280
Pray to God

396
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,550
May you live forever.
May I lose my life

397
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:25,830
Let at least this be the excuse
that gives me death

398
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:34,000
What will I do
with a few more breaths?

399
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,180
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

400
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,400
Pray to God

401
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,360
What will I give you?

402
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,140
Everything I possessed
has been snatched away

403
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,540
What have I,
save for a few prayers?

404
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,400
God is the one support
the poor have

405
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:52,680
And yet, I beg You...

406
00:48:53,810 --> 00:49:00,640
do not break my heart,
now that it has found succor

407
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,720
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

408
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,890
pray to God

409
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,880
Spread your hands in
helplessness and despair

410
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,990
Pray, oh sorrowful heart

411
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,250
Appeal to God

412
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,660
- Shekhu...
- My son...

413
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,130
Long live the Prince!

414
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,920
Long Live Prince Salim

415
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,000
Long live the Crown Prince!

416
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,460
Where is she?

417
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,160
Anarkali...

418
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,120
Your Majesty?

419
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,270
The Prince wishes to see you.

420
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,170
- What is the matter?
- Please grant me your leave.

421
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,930
Stop her, Mother. Please stop her.

422
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,240
Please come here, my child.

423
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,320
Long live the Prince!

424
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,990
Long live Prince Salim!

425
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,100
Anarkali, what are you grieving?

426
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:25,680
You were in love.
You were always so happy.

427
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,650
- My beloved was with me then.
- And now?

428
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,320
Now...

429
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,700
he has become a very
big man, Your Majesty.

430
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,090
- He has become too powerful.
- However powerful he has become...

431
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,610
I will bestow upon you royal riches
and make you even richer.

432
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:58,330
No, Your Majesty.
He has gone too far away from me.

433
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,010
I'll have the whole of
Hindustan searched...

434
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,020
and have him brought to you.

435
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:13,030
In the hope of meeting him,
I have lived through these days.

436
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,630
But he will never return
to me ever again, Your Majesty.

437
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,810
May God give your prince
a long life.

438
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,010
- Please grant me your leave now.
- How can I do that?

439
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:41,950
Make an announcement.

440
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,270
The prince's recovery
will be widely celebrated.

441
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,870
Don't be afraid, girl.
I am Raja Man Singh.

442
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:06,310
Raja saheb?

443
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,410
Although this is against
royal protocol...

444
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,170
helplessness has driven me to come here.

445
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,740
I don't understand.

446
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,390
I hope you will understand
without having to utter a word.

447
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,720
I? I don't understand anything.

448
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,080
Really? Or do you refuse
to understand anything?

449
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,370
Don't talk in riddles, Raja saheb.

450
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,770
Tell me clearly
whatever you have to say.

451
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:43,360
I admire your audacity, girl.
But it could even take your life.

452
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,550
The emperor might believe it,
even the world may believe it...

453
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,310
that you're only a tribal girl
who wandered into the Capital.

454
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,770
But I won't believe it.

455
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,590
I know the secret of your love.

456
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,170
What do you know?

457
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,500
I know you're an ant
that tried to climb a mountain.

458
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,370
That despite being a gypsy, you dared
to ensnare a prince in your trap.

459
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:15,590
To become the Queen of Hindustan,
for all its comforts and luxuries!

460
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,290
You've been driven
by your lust for wealth!

461
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,630
Here is the wealth!

462
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,190
Go away from here and sate your lust!

463
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,800
You may keep your wealth!

464
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,830
It's the rich who lust for wealth.
Not poor folks like us.

465
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,990
I don't want your wealth, nor do I seek
the comforts and luxuries of the palace.

466
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,210
All I want is my love.
Not from the Prince...

467
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:49,280
I want love from the soldier in whose
garb your prince feigned love for me.

468
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,850
He betrayed me.

469
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,800
He played with my feelings
and ruined my life to sate his lust!

470
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,480
And today, he lives in the palace!

471
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,230
I ask, is it a sin for the poor
to fall in love with the rich?

472
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,800
In that case, isn't it a sin for
the rich to deceive the poor...

473
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,630
in order to sate their lust?

474
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,160
Does your law have a punishment
for this crime?

475
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,850
Why are you silent, Raja saheb?
You're a law-abiding general!

476
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,170
Tell me, can you punish your prince
for his crime?

477
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,730
I am ashamed of myself, girl.

478
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,910
But for your own welfare,
I'd still advise you to go away.

479
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,870
- Or calamity will strike.
- Calamity?

480
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:45,760
What bigger calamity can I face
than my beloved betraying me?

481
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,770
My beloved has betrayed me!

482
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,600
You can, however, rest assured.

483
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,880
Why leave after the celebration?
Why not leave now?

484
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,691
I ask, why leave after the celebration?
Why don't you leave right now?

485
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,320
The Emperor's orders...

486
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,190
Go away! The shackles of love
have broken.

487
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,950
You are ruined. So what
are you waiting for?

488
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:44,370
Waiting? No, I wait for nothing.

489
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:49,180
You can deceive yourself,
not me.

490
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,450
I see a ray of hope
in your eyes.

491
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,250
- Yes. Maybe he will return.
- No, he's not returning.

492
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,210
Your world is plundered.

493
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,670
He has forgotten you!
He's gotten over you, Nadira.

494
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,120
- No! He was in love with me!
- Love?

495
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,570
A prince falling in love
with a nomad?

496
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,380
That is a cruel joke!

497
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,370
You've been subjected
to a cruel joke, Nadira!

498
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,640
A prince falling in love
with a nomad?

499
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:55,080
You've been subjected
to a cruel joke, Nadira!

500
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,170
What a joke!

501
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,130
Anarkali?

502
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,810
She suddenly took ill and
couldn't attend, Your Majesty.

503
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,150
Her absence at an occasion like
this would appear to be ominous.

504
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,340
Let the celebrations begin.

505
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,010
Wonderful! That was splendid!

506
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,810
Anarkali!

507
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,860
Khan-saheb, please begin.

508
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:03,430
Awaken the sweet ache of love

509
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,120
Let my heart pine...

510
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:17,960
with the high notes of
your tears

511
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:46,420
It took one gaze from you...

512
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,910
to put the world to sleep

513
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:55,890
This world is deep in slumber

514
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,420
The skies are deep in slumber

515
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:05,410
In deep sleep is your love

516
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,240
Awaken the sweet ache of love

517
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,640
Awaken, awaken

518
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,680
To whom shall I tell my story?

519
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:50,620
To whom shall I show my broken heart?

520
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:55,600
Where shall I go?
Till far away...

521
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,240
there is no light leading me

522
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:19,510
The fires have turned into ashes

523
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,930
Let my heart pine...

524
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,860
with the high notes of your tears

525
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:33,670
Awaken the sweet ache of love

526
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:02,140
Such were the winds
of misery that blew

527
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:06,330
They turned my world upside down

528
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:20,350
All joy has turned away from me

529
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,570
Serpents of sorrow
continue to bite me

530
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,230
Awaken the sweet ache of love

531
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,240
Let my heart pine...

532
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,750
with the high notes of your tears

533
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,000
Splendid, Anarkali!

534
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:24,030
In the eyes of the Almighty
and the justice of the Emperor...

535
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,960
everyone is an equal.

536
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,790
But an evaluation is
indeed necessary.

537
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:32,590
I must say, Anarkali has stood out
in today's contest.

538
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,780
I accord Anarkali the status
of the royal courtesan.

539
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,040
Long live Anarkali

540
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,130
Come here, Anarkali.

541
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:11,690
I am convinced that in keeping
with the royal edict...

542
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,720
Anarkali's beloved is present
here in the royal court.

543
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,910
Stand up.

544
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,600
Stand up without a fear.

545
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,850
If his love is true,
I want to see him.

546
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:07,490
Deceit. Betrayal. Lies.

547
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,200
How long shall I carry on with my life
with the support of such lies?

548
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:21,689
Oh, unfortunate Nadira!

549
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:30,090
You shall find no peace
and rest in this world.

550
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:38,040
Only despair. And darkness.

551
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:49,249
- What has happened to you?
- Mother, let's go away.

552
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,680
How can you say such things?
Think about it.

553
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:57,220
Why must we suffer again?
We have every comfort here.

554
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,720
There is peace and happiness.

555
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:07,770
Mother, you will have to pay for
this peace and happiness with my life.

556
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,310
Do you want me to live, or die?

557
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,130
- No, my child.
- So let's go away, Mother.

558
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:19,710
You have no idea what might happen.
Have faith in your daughter.

559
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,580
I'm not deceiving you.
I'm not lying to you.

560
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:28,650
Please listen to me, Mother.
Take me away from here.

561
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,710
As you wish, my child

562
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,380
Before we leave, let's at least
meet the womenfolk...

563
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,280
- and thank them.
- No, Mother.

564
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,960
You can go and see them.
I'm not going.

565
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,770
Parvez! Anarkali is leaving!
Anarkali is going away!

566
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,470
- I'm losing my life!
- Oh really.

567
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:06,786
Your heart is sinking.
It's a sign of pining, Prince.

568
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,240
- You're thinking of jokes?
- It's time for jokes, Prince

569
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,320
Love, they say, is an
affliction of the mind.

570
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,000
Don't poke fun at my love.
Give me a solution, if you can.

571
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:23,300
There are so many solutions, Prince.
But I'm afraid, my head might roll.

572
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,810
- Is that why you call yourself a friend?
- I'm not scared of losing my life.

573
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,660
If you kill me, you'll be
very compassionate about it.

574
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,770
But the Emperor will be very
merciless when he pronounces my death.

575
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,880
- To die a merciless death?
Not very appealing.

576
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:44,260
The Emperor? All right, you are
helpless before the Emperor, too.

577
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,790
And I'm helpless
because of his terror.

578
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,070
Anarkali is going away,
so let her go away.

579
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:57,230
Who will stop her?
Salim? That disrespectful Salim?

580
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,890
The unfortunate crown prince
of Hindustan!

581
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,370
How I wish I could fall in love
like a common man!

582
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,880
I could lay down my life
for your tears.

583
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,880
Well? What message shall I carry?

584
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,280
How will you reach her?
How will the message be delivered?

585
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:18,080
I have found him!
Just give me the message, Prince.

586
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,810
- Who'll deliver it?
- Just give it to me!

587
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,890
Go to the courtesan's chambers...

588
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,210
and give this letter to
the most beautiful...

589
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:31,110
the most bewitching women
of them all.

590
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,810
The one who makes the Moon blush,
who is the envy of the stars.

591
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:40,530
Go and give her
the Prince's heart.

592
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,760
What madness is this? What if the
letter falls in someone's hands?

593
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,180
Rest assured, Prince.
It's my deer.

594
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,070
It's no less than its master
in recognizing a true beauty.

595
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,710
Dearest sweetheart...

596
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,390
the one you condemn to death
with your departure...

597
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,590
seeks from you
the right to live.

598
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:43,700
If you want to put my love
to a test...

599
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:51,330
light a lamp tonight
and wait for me.

600
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:57,460
If I arrive, our love is true.

601
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,000
Or else, the dawn following the night
is not meant for me.

602
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:16,550
- She's not going away.
- Why not?

603
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,890
Something is wrong.

604
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,240
Go and find out. Go on.

605
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,350
I wait...

606
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:55,470
I seek to meet him

607
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:03,750
This lamp burns...

608
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:12,300
and I feel distraught

609
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,610
Love is a feeling...

610
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:24,220
that is beyond explanation

611
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,550
On the lips, the restlessness
of the heart...

612
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,030
is never brought out

613
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:03,910
Come to me...

614
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:09,510
my eyes yearn to see you

615
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:30,300
A desire like mine...

616
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:35,580
you must not spurn

617
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:38,270
My heart worships
the very ground you tread on

618
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:50,570
The state of lovers...

619
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:56,020
is not to be revealed

620
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,980
Love is a feeling...

621
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,460
that is beyond explanation

622
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,740
Silence! It's me.

623
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,640
- What have you come here for?
- I've come to you, Anar!

624
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,790
To me?

625
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,700
To seek your forgiveness
for the sins I've committed.

626
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,410
What sin have you
committed, Prince?

627
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,520
For you, it's no sin to play with
the feelings of a gypsy girl.

628
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:51,780
You have played with my love.
You have toyed with my desires.

629
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,690
I must thank you for playing
this game with me, Prince.

630
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,200
- Hear me out...
- Don't touch me, Prince!

631
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:04,030
I've had enough of this game!
What else do you want now?

632
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:08,210
God and His angels are witness.
I have played no games with you.

633
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,670
- Did you really love me?
- Yes.

634
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:15,110
Do not insult the sacred word, Prince.
Call it your lust!

635
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,830
- Anar!
- You remember my love today?

636
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:22,920
Where was your love when you played
with me for a couple of days...

637
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:26,350
and disappeared? I kept
suffering in your memory.

638
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,560
I was even sold in the marketplace!
I bore every tyranny.

639
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:33,620
I ask, where was your love then?

640
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:39,060
Go away, Prince! The word love
does not sound nice when you utter it.

641
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:43,740
But you have taught me to love, Anar.
I beg for your forgiveness!

642
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,170
What a big joke!

643
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,540
The crown prince begs a slave
for forgiveness!

644
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,340
You're not a slave.
You're the Queen of my heart.

645
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,380
And I'm no crown prince.
I'm your slave.

646
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,340
Forgive your slave, Anar.

647
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,856
It's lust that makes
you flatter me.

648
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,460
Do not call my love, lust.
Look into my eyes.

649
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,260
- Aren't my tears proof of my love?
- I've been deceived long enough.

650
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:10,480
You even call my tears a deceit?

651
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:15,120
- How can one trust a prince's tears?
- I can give up everything for you!

652
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,640
- That's a lie!
- How will I convince you?

653
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,360
I want to go away...

654
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:23,930
away from this world of
deceit and betrayal!

655
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,880
My love is nothing but lust,
my tears are deceit?

656
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,580
My intentions are evil?

657
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,050
Very well, then.
Leave, if that's your wish.

658
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,170
But remember, your picture
is etched on my heart.

659
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,796
- I won't be able to live without you!
- That's what you think, Prince.

660
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,220
That is the truth! I can lay down
my life to prove that my love is true.

661
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:48,900
Those that threaten,
do little, Prince.

662
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,580
So you want proof, Anar?
You want proof?

663
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,260
Soldier! What are you doing?

664
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:11,060
In my death, you would have
believed my love to be true.

665
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,590
Soldier, my dear soldier.

666
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:18,430
You won't go away now, will you?

667
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:22,900
- How can I ever leave you?
- Anar!

668
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,560
It's dawn, Anar.
I must leave now.

669
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:35,410
- Prince...
- I'll come again.

670
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,840
Every day, every evening.

671
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,810
Light a lamp in the moonlight
every evening and wait for me.

672
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:48,740
I will return with all my love.

673
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,720
Girl!

674
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:15,050
So what I heard is true. You have
to decided to stay on in the palace.

675
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,550
Why haven't you left?

676
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,590
It was the Emperor's order.

677
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,170
Didn't you want to leave,
despite the Emperor's orders?

678
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:29,560
I've changed my mind.

679
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:34,080
It looks like you've met
with Prince Salim already.

680
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:37,100
If I deny that?

681
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:41,150
You can't deceive me. Raja Man Singh
can very well see the truth.

682
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,720
How dare you disobey my order?
Who is the criminal who supports you?

683
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:49,880
Criminal? And what is
his crime, Raja saheb?

684
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:55,330
That he deceived you. He showed you
fancy dreams, a pack of lies.

685
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:00,250
If what he said is lies,
what is the truth, Raja saheb?

686
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,730
The truth is you're a slave.

687
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:08,290
And the crown prince of Hindustan
can never wed a slave!

688
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,570
- Why not?
- It's the custom.

689
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:20,220
In that case, he's not the criminal.
You're the criminal, Raja saheb.

690
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,610
Silence, insolent girl!
Don't cross your limits!

691
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,520
I beg your pardon, Raja saheb,
but you are the criminal...

692
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,260
who weighs love in
the scales of wealth.

693
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:33,550
God made us all equals.

694
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:37,220
It was people like you who created
the classes...

695
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,560
and erected barriers between them.

696
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,810
The royal laws are as firm
as God's rules.

697
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,370
I can give you no help
in this respect.

698
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:49,380
I have no hopes of you, Raja saheb.
I pin my hopes on him...

699
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,320
who's a human being,
despite living in a palace of gold.

700
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:56,060
He's the one with the heart,
who loves me...

701
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:00,640
- and compels me to requite his love.
- He is a fool! He is blind.

702
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,550
He's ignorant of the consequences
despite knowing everything.

703
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,870
In the garb of love,
he's playing with your life!

704
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,460
My life belongs to him.
He can very well play with it.

705
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,110
- Why must you worry?
- I don't!

706
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:15,880
If you want to live in the palace
at the risk of your life, you may.

707
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:24,500
But remember, you will be watched.
I'll be told of everything you do.

708
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,770
So watch your step.

709
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,110
One wrong step,
and it'll be your last.

710
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:37,480
Even death at my beloved's feet
shall be a celebration of life.

711
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,700
A life full of love
lasts but a few moments

712
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:04,270
Even if it's too little,
it lasts a lifetime

713
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:25,740
Thrones and riches
of the world...

714
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:31,650
nothing is bigger than love

715
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:44,220
A life full of love
lasts but a few moments

716
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:50,280
Even if it's too little,
it lasts a lifetime

717
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,030
Anarkali goes to meet someone
secretly in the night.

718
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,740
It'll be dealt with.

719
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,640
He has fled.

720
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,080
Whatever you do...

721
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,750
you cannot escape my clutches.

722
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:17,580
A life full of love
lasts but a few moments

723
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,850
Even if it's too little,
it lasts a lifetime

724
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,510
Where two hearts full of love
beat together...

725
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,620
it's the most beautiful
celebration of love

726
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:58,260
A life full of love
lasts but a few moments

727
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:26,870
Anar, your love shall await you
in the garden tonight.

728
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,280
Salim?

729
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:35,760
The prince and Anarkali?
No, this is impossible!

730
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:38,850
I'm ruined!

731
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:44,010
Anarkali has robbed me
of everything I had!

732
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,980
Don't cry, Gulnar.

733
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:55,190
Yes, if there is courage,
there is life.

734
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:00,930
Revenge! Vengeance!

735
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,940
Something that will be a testimony
of Gulnar's love!

736
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,510
- What are you going to do, Gulnar?
- She will wait for him tonight.

737
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,870
- But I will show her the way.
- What?

738
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:19,660
The way to death.
I'll lead her to the tunnel...

739
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,920
where the prince has his
man-eating lion.

740
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,860
Anarkali will not get to know.
She will receive my letter...

741
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:33,360
and go to the tunnel to meet Salim.
There she will confront the lion!

742
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,310
Anarkali's bloodstained remains
will give succor to my heart.

743
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:13,590
It's very late, Parvez.

744
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:19,170
When you're waiting for someone,
time does pass slowly, Prince.

745
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,750
She has come, Prince!

746
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,120
- You may leave now.
- God protect you.

747
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,700
I shall stand guard so
the Prince's fun isn't ruined.

748
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:48,680
Guess who it is.
Tell me.

749
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,350
Answer me.

750
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,700
I'm not the one you think I am.

751
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,430
Why don't you speak?

752
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:18,370
Oh yes, it's right too.
There's silence everywhere.

753
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:24,510
Why must we speak either?
Come, let's sit quietly somewhere.

754
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:29,230
Prince...

755
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:34,770
Anar! Who are you?
Gulnar!

756
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:39,216
Yes, it isn't Anar.
It's the unfortunate Gulnar!

757
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,540
Let me go!

758
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:45,346
Do not separate me from yourself!
Even if it was by deceit...

759
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:49,970
your embrace was wonderful!
It's so soothing, so peaceful.

760
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:51,210
You dare!

761
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,056
If I'm a slave who dares do this,
she, too, is.

762
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,530
Silence, shameless woman! How can you
ever equal Anarkali's sacred love?

763
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:02,610
- You aren't even the dust on her feet!
- Why?

764
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:07,160
Because her love is successful?
And mine has failed?

765
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,430
Prince...

766
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,450
- Leave me alone!
- Prince!

767
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,920
- Stay away!
- Prince!

768
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:22,100
Do not humiliate me, Prince.
Do not humiliate me like this!

769
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:27,170
There's no telling what
a scorned woman might do.

770
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,660
- She might do anything!
- You're threatening me?

771
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,000
No, Prince. No.

772
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:41,380
I'm begging you... for love.
For one moment of love.

773
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:45,140
For one moment of love,
give yourself unto me.

774
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,630
- This moment belongs to me! To me!
- Insolent woman! Get out of my sight!

775
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:58,890
You have seen Gulnar's love.
You will now see her revenge.

776
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:08,670
With all my love,
I lay myself at your feet.

777
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,950
But you have spurned me.
You have humiliated me!

778
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,940
I'm not the one you kicked.
You kicked your own destiny!

779
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,116
- What can you do to me?
- I can expose your secret...

780
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,300
- to the whole empire!
- What secret?

781
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:27,110
- What proof do you have?
- A very big proof, too.

782
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:33,970
There were birds flying in the skies.
Your pigeons and my falcons.

783
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,990
I have in my possession
your letters.

784
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,730
And those letters
can change destiny.

785
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:46,010
It can restore to me
my lost pride...

786
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:49,450
and it can make you
a slave to me!

787
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:53,820
But I don't even want you
as my slave.

788
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:56,790
I hate you, Prince! I hate you!

789
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:01,090
Hatred seeks revenge and this
revenge shall come from Anarkali!

790
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:11,000
You know, it's enough for the
letters to reach the Emperor.

791
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,090
Anarkali will then be thrust
into the dungeons.

792
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:20,850
She'll be subjected to tyranny.
She'll be sentenced to death.

793
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,510
And I'll stand by and laugh.

794
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:32,740
You'll come to me in tears.
You'll fall at my feet.

795
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:38,730
You'll say, Gulnar, take
away everything from me...

796
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:41,820
but please save Anarkali's life.

797
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:46,970
And I will kick you,
as you kicked me.

798
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:52,760
And I will say, I want death.
Only death! Anarkali's death!

799
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:57,290
She has snatched everything from me!
My status, my position...

800
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,070
my love and my life!

801
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,140
Anarkali's death will mean life to me!

802
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:31,940
You want to kill me?
No! You can't kill me!

803
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,460
It's Emperor Akbar's rule!
He's the one who'll pass justice!

804
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:40,540
Don't come any closer! I'll scream!
It'll bring the guards here...

805
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:43,900
and you'll be shamed!
You will be shamed! Come no further!

806
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,380
Before you succeed in
your evil designs...

807
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:52,050
I will finish you!

808
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:59,270
No, a death like this one is
too easy for a sinner like you.

809
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:01,990
I'll throw you to my lions!

810
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,510
They'll calm your fire of revenge
with your blood!

811
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:09,520
They'll maul you! They'll wipe
out every trace of you!

812
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,990
Prince!

813
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:33,990
- Get out of here!
- What are you doing, Prince?

814
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,900
I'll protect your life
by giving her death!

815
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,850
If her death gives me life,
I don't want to live at all!

816
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:46,160
- What are you saying. Anar?
- It's the truth.

817
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,200
I wish you knew, my love
means the life to me.

818
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,700
And that has nothing
to do with death.

819
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:54,260
While I live, your enemies
cannot be left alive!

820
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,880
Beware! If you take another step...

821
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:02,090
it'll be as good as
strangling my love.

822
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,960
Let her go.

823
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,360
I have a request to make of you.

824
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:26,540
If possible, please turn
this hatred into love.

825
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:33,530
Forgive me, sister!
Forgive me for my sin!

826
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:35,670
Don't say that.

827
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:42,870
You don't know.
I'm so ashamed of myself!

828
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,210
Lord, if there's anything in my heart
other than love for Anarkali...

829
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:53,390
may I burn in the fires of hell!
May I not find peace even in my grave!

830
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,440
Let's go, Anar.

831
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,230
Where's the letter?

832
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:17,540
I swear, it's not with me.

833
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:20,270
All right.

834
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,320
It's not with me!
So why're you running away?

835
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,950
Will you give it to me
or must I find it myself?

836
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,390
I'm getting it for you!

837
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:47,870
Anar, you don't know what
a dangerous woman Gulnar is.

838
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:53,750
- She's a venomous snake.
- God protects those in love.

839
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,840
- I've made up my mind, Anar.
- What?

840
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,640
It's time now for the Emperor
to get to know about my love.

841
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:07,510
- Really? And how?
- The Emperor's birthday approaches.

842
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:11,050
On that day,
he forgets the worries of the world...

843
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,550
and gives himself up to
joy and merriment.

844
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:16,740
Where the Empire goes to sleep,
love is awakened.

845
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:20,450
- Will you then?
- No.

846
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:24,086
At the celebrations
in the Glass Palace...

847
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:27,020
an Anarkali, high on love, will dance
and to regale the gathering.

848
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:32,020
Everything in the world will be
swaying and dancing.

849
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:35,460
All the courtiers
and distinguished elders...

850
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,590
even the Emperor himself will
come alive to the revelry.

851
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,090
At a time like that,
I will ask him for your hand.

852
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,090
- And he won't be able to refuse you?
- No, never!

853
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:51,840
The Glass Palace will bring for us
the message of a new life.

854
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:55,830
The Glass Palace will bring for you
not the message of life...

855
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,990
but the message of death.

856
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,350
You're kicking up a storm today.

857
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,960
Wait till she gets ready.
Then you'll see.

858
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,470
The charm, the airs...

859
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,620
whom is the lightning
going to strike?

860
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,820
If I have permission,
may I dress her up?

861
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:43,430
She's ready already.
See if there's something missing.

862
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:55,550
No one survives this intoxication.
Go on.

863
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,020
Once the drug takes effect,
her feet will falter...

864
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:06,860
her eyes will glaze over and
the secret of her love will be out.

865
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:34,740
Where has my destiny...

866
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:41,080
brought me today?

867
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:47,170
Glass everywhere...

868
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:54,740
makes a mockery of me

869
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:03,390
Anarkali, get a hold on yourself.

870
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:28,850
Do not blame me...

871
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:35,560
for passing out

872
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:42,900
It would be an insult...

873
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:48,560
to my helpless love

874
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:57,770
In my love, my feet stagger...

875
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:02,180
and the world thinks
I have arrived drunk

876
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,790
One who sheds tears
all day and night...

877
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:40,450
is ordered to make people laugh

878
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:49,400
The world thinks
I have arrived drunk

879
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:09,550
Helplessly in love with someone...

880
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:14,330
I have walked to him,
but he does not come to me

881
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:23,390
The world thinks
I have arrived drunk

882
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:47,690
The one for whom
I have ruined my life...

883
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,220
sits there, with the heart
he has stolen from me

884
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:00,700
The world thinks
I have arrived drunk

885
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:26,960
For how long shall you hide?
Look at me in the eye

886
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:29,340
Meet my gaze

887
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:36,060
But you wouldn't even care
if I lost my life

888
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:44,800
The world thinks
I have walked in, drunk

889
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:55,930
In my love, my feet stagger...

890
01:48:56,050 --> 01:49:00,170
and the world thinks
I have arrived drunk

891
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:03,790
Anarkali!

892
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,050
It's only about love.

893
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,200
Take her into custody!

894
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,050
Take away everything from me!
The throne of Hindustani...

895
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:41,040
the luxuries of the palace
and the riches! I want nothing!

896
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:45,490
I want only Anarkali! I will think
you have given me everything!

897
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:49,560
- What if your father does not agree?
- You can tell him then...

898
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,510
that he won't find me alive.
He'll find my corpse tomorrow.

899
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:57,340
He can then take out a procession
of my funeral and have his way!

900
01:49:58,310 --> 01:50:00,120
You want me to give
Anarkali to Salim?

901
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:02,570
And make a courtesan
the Queen of Hindustan?

902
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:05,220
You know what a queen is?

903
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:07,900
She's a goddess of virtue
and sacrifice.

904
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:11,330
She's a mother to her subjects,
Like you are, Queen.

905
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,940
Not a tramp, a woman who is
nothing but a plaything!

906
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,790
I wholeheartedly agree
with what you say.

907
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:25,390
But if you had any idea
of what I am going through.

908
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,620
What's the matter?
Tell me.

909
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:35,940
I'll rescue you. Then we'll
not be so helpless and distraught.

910
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:41,000
Love shall be free again.
And there will be only you and me.

911
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:48,570
That's what you always say.
You're a prince, after all.

912
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:54,030
- That's your compulsion.
- Compulsion? Because I'm a prince?

913
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:59,340
The only son of Jalaluddin Akbar.
The only heir to the Moghul throne!

914
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:01,600
The heir to Hindustan's throne!

915
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,480
Is that is why you've been
tied in chains, Anar?

916
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,560
I swear it on you! I will
bring about a bloodbath!

917
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:15,206
This regime will exist no more.
The Moghuls will cease to be!

918
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:17,906
- There will be no Akbar, no Salim...
- Come to your senses, Prince!

919
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:21,650
What are you talking about? Those in
love don't talk about bloodshed.

920
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:23,450
Don't say such things, Anar.

921
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,070
It's precisely this attitude that has
weakened my resolve.

922
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:29,130
Whether the regime exists or not,
whether the empire exists or not...

923
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,900
whether Salim becomes the
emperor or not...

924
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:35,280
you and I will live and die together.
That is what I have decided.

925
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:36,950
- This is a rebellion!
- No.

926
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,620
It's the call of love!

927
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:45,470
- Your Majesty...
- You dare!

928
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:50,180
The Prince has declared
a rebellion against you.

929
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,570
He's leading troops
to attack the royal palace.

930
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,180
Salim has rebelled?

931
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:04,410
Man Singh!

932
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,900
- Hear that, Queen?
- Salim is still a child.

933
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:16,060
He doesn't know many youngsters
of his age.

934
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:18,280
I'll go and placate him.

935
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:23,220
What have you done, Shekhu?

936
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:29,600
A son brings pride to his mother
before his father.

937
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:37,180
And you make me bow my head
in shame forever.

938
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:42,090
Defeat! Defeat for Akbar!

939
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:46,370
Defeat for the Moghul empire!
From whom?

940
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,300
From a trampish slave!

941
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:54,440
For the sake of a slave, he wants
to fight against his parents.

942
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,920
He wants to wipe out
the Moghul empire.

943
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:00,450
- At your service, Sire.
- Man Singh...

944
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:05,670
take royal troops to combat Salim.
Bring him here, dead or alive.

945
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:08,350
No, brother!
You are Salim's uncle!

946
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,950
Do not kill my son!

947
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:17,250
- It's the order of the Emperor, sister.
- Don't be so cruel, Emperor!

948
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:19,700
How will Salim ever fight
the royal forces?

949
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:22,846
- I will brook no rebellion.
- It isn't anyone else...

950
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:25,450
who's rebelling. It's our
own flesh and blood, Salim!

951
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:28,850
Even if he brings his troops,
captures us and kills us...

952
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:31,690
he'll still remain our son.
We are his parents.

953
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,480
We'll lay down our lives
for his happiness.

954
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:39,250
Is that a Rajput woman speaking?
A lioness? The Queen of Hindustan?

955
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:44,810
Yes. Because I'm a mother first.
Everything else comes afterwards.

956
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:49,080
A mother can give away all she has
for the sake of her son's life.

957
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,580
I don't want the regime.
I don't want these luxuries!

958
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:57,860
All I want is my son!
Only my son!

959
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:00,480
You had once yourself told me...

960
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:04,620
that the scales of our justice must
never waver, even for our son.

961
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:09,640
Do you want history to say that
when the occasion arose...

962
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:15,490
Akbar's life was blotted
with the love of his son?

963
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:20,310
You say that because you are
only an Emperor. Not a father!

964
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,670
Give it a thought.

965
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:30,020
Did we seek favors at
temples and mosques?

966
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:33,230
Did we invoke the Gods for a son...

967
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:37,160
so that our own forces would one day
turn his enemies?

968
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:43,840
Think of those days when
Salim used to fall ill...

969
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:49,280
and we spent days and nights
sitting at his bedside.

970
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:52,290
We used to pray for his life.

971
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:56,450
Was it so that our royal forces
will claim his life today?

972
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:03,170
Very well, Queen.

973
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:08,400
I will personally go
to battle with Salim.

974
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:12,810
All alone, at that.

975
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,880
No, Emperor, you cannot go!

976
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:20,380
Salim is a rebel.
His blood is boiling.

977
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:24,000
He might raise his hand at you!
No, I'm not letting you go!

978
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,310
What do you want me
to do, Queen?

979
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:30,610
Your decisions are all
very strange, Emperor.

980
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:34,960
You want to gift me my son and
snatch my husband's life from me.

981
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:40,350
But a Hindu woman has forever
sacrificed her son for her husband.

982
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:48,040
Man Singh, the Queen of
Hindustan orders you.

983
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,370
Take the royal forces to combat
the rebellion started by Salim.

984
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,650
Bring that worthless boy here,
dead or alive.

985
01:55:55,730 --> 01:56:00,100
The Emperor of Hindustan wishes to
go to battle himself, Queen.

986
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:03,860
If Salim, with Moghul blood in his
veins, can get down to a rebellion...

987
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:06,390
he is also the son
of a Rajput woman.

988
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:10,370
His eyes will certainly show respect
and honor for his father.

989
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:14,780
What father and what son
in a battle, Emperor?

990
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,530
Whose life will I pray for?

991
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:20,590
Your husband has a request
to make of you, Queen.

992
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:26,880
You must pray for Salim's life.
It's okay if I die.

993
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:29,810
But if something happens to Salim...

994
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:33,070
the Moghul empire's heir
will be wiped out!

995
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:47,780
- To Salim, the Emperor of Hindustan.
- Glory be!

996
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:52,320
To the Moghul empire, glory be!

997
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,060
Amen.

998
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:42,320
My dear man, you have taken the most
important step of your youth today.

999
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:44,830
I want to congratulate you.

1000
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:49,180
One who comes alone either
comes with a message of peace...

1001
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:52,660
or wishes to prove his supremacy.

1002
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:58,110
No, Emperor Akbar has come to test
the daring of a rebel.

1003
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:00,880
You can test my daring
only in the battlefield.

1004
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:05,210
Salim, to fight the Moghul forces
is not an easy task.

1005
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:10,570
As a father, I do not want my son
to face defeat in the battle.

1006
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:13,340
I want to see you succeed, Salim.

1007
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:16,160
But Salim will not capture
a lone man...

1008
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:18,580
and insult his bravery!

1009
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,980
Insult for a rebel?

1010
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,120
A successful rebel
is not a rebel!

1011
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:27,190
True, but success you will have...

1012
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:30,720
only when you apply your
father's blood on your forehead.

1013
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:36,580
Shekhu, your mother wishes to
light lamps for your success.

1014
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:41,530
Go and light those lamps.
Give her the news of your success.

1015
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:43,700
Pick up your spear, Shekhu!

1016
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:51,250
A father's chest eagerly awaits
his son's spear to pierce it!

1017
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,410
This is the chest on which
you once rested your head, Shekhu.

1018
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:23,020
Oh soldiers of Emperor Akbar,
you have been misled.

1019
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,310
Your chief is helpless.

1020
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:34,630
To Jalaluddin Akbar,
the Emperor of Hindustan...

1021
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:36,110
Glory be!

1022
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:46,310
Present the offenders in court.

1023
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:18,010
My child!

1024
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:40,440
The accused Nadira,
alias Anarkali...

1025
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:46,290
is accused of treason,
ensnarement and rebellion.

1026
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:50,770
The accused Salim.
Crown Prince...

1027
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:54,460
- son of Jalaluddin Akbar...
- Hold it.

1028
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:56,890
I have no parents.

1029
02:00:58,350 --> 02:01:01,440
It is my misfortune
that I have no parents.

1030
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:05,810
If I had any parents, they would
have been here with me.

1031
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:10,340
Like that mother there.
Sorrowful, grieving...

1032
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:14,480
at her daughter's plight,
almost going mad.

1033
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:19,450
If she could, she would bite open
the shackles at her daughter's feet.

1034
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:22,330
Else, she'd bang her head on the
ground and give up her life.

1035
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,600
My son!

1036
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:31,080
Please enter it in the records.
The accused Salim has no father.

1037
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,900
I'm a rebel! I know a rebel
gets a death sentence!

1038
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:37,720
So give me a death sentence!

1039
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:41,620
No! The confession to a crime
is not evidence of the crime.

1040
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:47,680
My Lord, what would the accused have
gained from a rebellion?

1041
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:53,130
Riches, throne? What was it
that he did not have...

1042
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:59,090
or that he did not have a right to?
So why would he rebel?

1043
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:00,850
- For the sake of love.
- Exactly.

1044
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:05,470
For the accused, the rebellion
was an act of emotions.

1045
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,330
He did take up arms,
but out of innocence.

1046
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:13,340
His rebellion is nothing more than
an act of rebellion against a father.

1047
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,030
Parents do always forgive their
children's trespasses, Lord.

1048
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:20,570
The accused is indeed at fault,
but he's not guilty.

1049
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:25,100
I beg the royal court for a pardon
to the accused Salim, Lord.

1050
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,270
What do the other courtiers
have to say?

1051
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:41,590
Lord, the accused Salim
should be released.

1052
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:45,880
- He may be forgiven.
- He may be spared, Lord.

1053
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,930
Issue the orders, Lord!

1054
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:51,310
Issue the order
for his release, Lord.

1055
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:57,540
To acquaint the court with the truth,
I will now tell you...

1056
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,940
something that goes against
the grain of the Rajputs.

1057
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:03,550
But it's a question of
Hindustan's future.

1058
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:06,090
May God forgive me.

1059
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,670
It's Anarkali who instigated
Salim into a rebellion!

1060
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,780
That's a lie!
A fabrication!

1061
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:17,500
Silence. You may carry on.

1062
02:03:18,370 --> 02:03:21,910
She's the one who committed the crime,
who wouldn't relent despite warnings.

1063
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:24,840
But she thought a rebellion
was a better option.

1064
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:27,440
She had strung dreams
around the rebellion...

1065
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,690
and she encouraged Salim to rebel,
so that her dreams would be fulfilled.

1066
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:36,720
- Anarkali is the offender, not Salim!
- Justice, Emperor! I want justice!

1067
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:39,380
Everyone saves his own kin.

1068
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:42,680
But to be compassionate with others
is the hallmark of a emperor.

1069
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:46,560
You know what your son has done.

1070
02:03:47,190 --> 02:03:49,970
But it is my blood that runs
in my daughter's veins.

1071
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:54,680
I swear it on that blood!
She is not guilty!

1072
02:03:55,590 --> 02:04:01,150
She's the one to whom you gave riches,
but she rejected them.

1073
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:07,470
If she wished, she could even
have asked you for your throne.

1074
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:09,840
And you couldn't have refused her.

1075
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:13,250
But she wouldn't even take
love as charity.

1076
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:17,150
If she is guilty,
I ask the world...

1077
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:21,950
who is innocent? What is law?
Where is justice?

1078
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:28,840
Before you declare my daughter
a criminal, you must...

1079
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:29,970
Mother!

1080
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:34,710
Before you snatch my daughter from me,
you must snatch a son from his mother!

1081
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:36,940
No, Mother! Don't say that!

1082
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:42,070
No one is the criminal.
Not the prince, not I.

1083
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:46,090
But if love is a crime,
we are indeed criminals.

1084
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,640
But I ask you, Emperor...

1085
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,350
why do you hold me guilty
of this crime?

1086
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,530
It's because you don't
like the idea of my love.

1087
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:00,580
The love of a slave
with a prince.

1088
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:03,210
The love of the poor
with the rich.

1089
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:07,450
But I ask you again, Emperor,
are the poor not human?

1090
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:10,470
Was it God who made differences
between the rich and the poor?

1091
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:15,560
Do not grief and sorrow affect
the rich and the poor alike?

1092
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,940
Is the blood of the rich, blood?
And ours, water?

1093
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,760
So why these differences between
the rich and the poor?

1094
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,440
Why do we face these consequences
when we fall in love?

1095
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:31,140
If there is a law that declares
such a love to be a crime...

1096
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,540
it stands on a foundation of injustice.

1097
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:36,186
It is the duty of human beings
to fight against it.

1098
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:38,860
Girl! You will be punished with death
for offending the law.

1099
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:42,650
I will say it again,
at the top of my voice!

1100
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:46,320
Ours was not a rebellion!
It was the call of love!

1101
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:50,060
It was a struggle for justice!
It was a war against tyranny!

1102
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,220
Oh Lord of Justice...

1103
02:05:56,210 --> 02:06:00,670
before you pass sentence,
do remember...

1104
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:05,450
that this is not the final court.

1105
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,280
There is a court far greater
than this court.

1106
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,660
The Court of God.

1107
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:20,330
There, you shall be asked
to account for your justice.

1108
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:32,870
Lord Almighty, grant unto me
strength and wisdom.

1109
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,600
I find myself to be a weak father.

1110
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:41,520
It is proved that the accused
Salim and Anarkali...

1111
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:46,980
showed no faith in royal justice,
took the law into their hands...

1112
02:06:47,170 --> 02:06:49,890
and staged a rebellion
against the regime.

1113
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:58,610
The accused Salim and Nadira
are guilty of treason, disobedience...

1114
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:05,400
contempt of court and insult
to the Emperor Akbar.

1115
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:22,890
Both are sentenced to death.

1116
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:15,890
Lord, the courtiers seek
an audience with you.

1117
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:38,720
Queen, stay with me.

1118
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:59,740
The courtiers have assembled here
to request Your Majesty...

1119
02:09:00,030 --> 02:09:03,810
to reconsider your decision.

1120
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:10,980
Should it be considered then that the
Emperor did not issue the decision...

1121
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:14,680
after due consideration?

1122
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:19,510
We come only with a petition
of mercy, oh Queen.

1123
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:23,530
But rebels have always been
given a death sentence.

1124
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:28,150
There is a difference between the prince
and other rebels, Your Majesty.

1125
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,790
- Why?
- He's dear not only to you...

1126
02:09:31,110 --> 02:09:34,470
he's dear to all of us. He's the heir
to the throne of Hindustan.

1127
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,270
In the eyes of the law, however,
he is a criminal.

1128
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:41,750
There is no law for
kings and emperors, Lord.

1129
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,130
Is that what the courtiers
of Akbar say?

1130
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:52,470
Nobody is above the law.
Not you, not I, not my son.

1131
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:56,900
Undoubtedly. But the laws have to be
compromised at times...

1132
02:09:57,310 --> 02:10:00,830
- to save the situation.
- What does that mean?

1133
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:05,400
The Prince is the only heir
of the Moghul empire.

1134
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:08,040
If he does not live,
the lineage will cease to exist!

1135
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:12,900
- This empire will cease to exist.
- It isn't families that run empires.

1136
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:18,920
It's principles that run it.
To save my family...

1137
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:21,610
I cannot ignore the law.

1138
02:10:22,910 --> 02:10:25,710
I cannot betray my conscience
and compromise my integrity.

1139
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,810
God has given me the power
to sit in justice.

1140
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:34,520
Will I be able to face God
on the Day of Reckoning?

1141
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:41,210
My forefathers' souls
will heap ridicule on me.

1142
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:44,920
They will say that I killed justice
for the sake of my son's life.

1143
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:47,160
- But...
- I don't want to listen to anything!

1144
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,880
Even if the name of Moghul
is wiped out...

1145
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:52,280
it's impossible for me
to spare Salim's life.

1146
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:53,710
That is not possible!

1147
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:58,000
As much right as you have to Salim,
we Rajputs have a right, too.

1148
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,070
Salim is a symbol of
Hindu-Muslim unity.

1149
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:04,500
The Rajputs gave their daughter
to marry you...

1150
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:09,350
because the son of the Rajputs and the
Moghuls would be the ruler of Hindustan.

1151
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:12,440
And the Rajputs had put their swords
back in their sheaths.

1152
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:14,960
You want to wipe out that
fact from history.

1153
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:17,000
But we Rajputs won't
let you do that.

1154
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:20,816
The Rajputs might very well draw
their swords again to save him...

1155
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:22,140
Raja Man Singh!

1156
02:11:24,090 --> 02:11:25,590
Do not cross your limits.

1157
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:47,150
Emperor, Queen, we have erred
only out of emotions.

1158
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:51,380
Don't get carried away
by your emotions.

1159
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:58,490
Look at the Emperor's state.

1160
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:09,020
At daybreak tomorrow, his only son
will be delivered to death.

1161
02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:17,160
You may leave now.

1162
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:32,130
Prince, give me death!
I'm the reason for your ruin!

1163
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:35,350
I was the one that exposed
your secret!

1164
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:40,390
I am the one who's responsible
for your impending death!

1165
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:46,840
Kill me! Please!
Deliver me from this life!

1166
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:53,820
No! A few moments after our death,
Anar and I will be united again.

1167
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:58,780
We shall be rid of the world.
Forever and forever.

1168
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,360
Away from the eyes
of a filthy woman like you!

1169
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,100
I don't want to kill you. Else, your
soul will follow us even there!

1170
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:09,330
Go away, Gulnar.
You shall live on.

1171
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:12,340
- All alone.
- No, Prince! No!

1172
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:20,710
I'm in love with you, too.
I can't live without you!

1173
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:23,780
Exactly! You will live and
burn in the fires of hell!

1174
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,490
- No, Prince.
- Soldiers!

1175
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:28,320
- Don't separate me from you!
- Take her away!

1176
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:31,620
I'll go mad, Prince!
I'll go mad without you!

1177
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,940
I'll go insane!

1178
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:58,330
Life is rendered helpless

1179
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:04,280
All we have is despair

1180
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:12,330
Are we the only ones
who suffer this fate?

1181
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:18,870
Or is God above watching us?

1182
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:37,370
Oh Lord, what has
life brought us to?

1183
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:46,610
Why is life a story of
sorrow and helplessness?

1184
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:58,920
Even as You watch...

1185
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:03,590
the world continues to punish us

1186
02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:11,830
ls love a crime?
Do please tell me

1187
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:43,820
Why is our happiness plundered
even as we reach our goal?

1188
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:52,820
Oh Lord, what has
life brought us to?

1189
02:15:54,100 --> 02:16:02,100
Why is life a story of
sorrow and helplessness?

1190
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:31,560
I have just this request
to make of You...

1191
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:40,530
Allah, do keep alive in the world
the name of lovers

1192
02:17:04,010 --> 02:17:12,010
Or else, death is the only
consequence for those in love

1193
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,180
Anar...

1194
02:17:50,570 --> 02:17:51,670
Prince...

1195
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:55,400
It's time for us
to travel together.

1196
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,880
I'm fortunate...

1197
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:03,000
that you spared the time for me.

1198
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:14,750
A slave isn't worth the price
you're paying for me.

1199
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,750
This is too little, Anar.
I'm ashamed...

1200
02:18:21,139 --> 02:18:24,689
I have nothing more precious
than life to give away for you.

1201
02:18:26,350 --> 02:18:27,450
Soldier!

1202
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:32,530
I have been so unlucky for you.

1203
02:18:32,830 --> 02:18:39,030
Don't say that. Unless love is
painted in the hues of blood...

1204
02:18:39,889 --> 02:18:41,289
it's not worthwhile.

1205
02:18:45,469 --> 02:18:48,999
- You ought to be happy.
- Yes.

1206
02:18:51,049 --> 02:18:53,699
On the one hand, I'm happy
to have your heart.

1207
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:56,740
On the other...

1208
02:18:57,480 --> 02:18:59,930
I can't be happy to take your life.

1209
02:19:01,139 --> 02:19:02,439
Don't grieve, Anar.

1210
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:08,920
Lovers are often star-crossed.

1211
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:15,260
It's a matter of pride
that I walk with you.

1212
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:18,499
You must congratulate me
for my loyalty.

1213
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:23,560
That's what I'm thankful for.

1214
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:28,740
But how I wish you
were unfaithful.

1215
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:32,429
Are you afraid of
the journey ahead?

1216
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:36,000
Of death? Not at all.

1217
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:39,680
That you are with me...

1218
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:50,220
your memories, your thoughts,
are all with me.

1219
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:59,510
Go away now.
Someone might overhear us.

1220
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,040
May God protect you.

1221
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:06,540
May God protect you.

1222
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:15,860
To those who are to die...

1223
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,720
may God be the protector.

1224
02:21:21,370 --> 02:21:24,870
Has the Queen been widowed
even as Emperor Akbar lives?

1225
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:29,670
No, Emperor.
My husband still lives.

1226
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:34,130
- So what makes you wear that attire?
- It's my son's wedding.

1227
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:39,490
Present the offenders.

1228
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:02,000
The mother may bid her son farewell.
I give her permission.

1229
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:09,750
Shekhu!

1230
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:24,800
My son!

1231
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:33,520
Look at the mother who comes
to bid farewell to her son.

1232
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:42,980
But where are you going anyway, my son?
From one mother's lap to another.

1233
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:50,000
Mother, my son has been brought up
with a lot of love and care.

1234
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:52,820
Take good care of him.

1235
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:10,560
My son, remember your
mother's helplessness.

1236
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:16,270
It'll make your journey easier.

1237
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:45,970
To the lord of riches,
and everyone present here...

1238
02:23:47,590 --> 02:23:52,480
I extend my congratulations
on this happy occasion.

1239
02:23:54,450 --> 02:24:00,470
The Prince, whom everyone
in this great land...

1240
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:06,240
wished to see some day on the
throne of the mighty Moghuls...

1241
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:12,800
to keep the justice of the Emperor
alive, is being sacrificed today.

1242
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:20,590
Perhaps there are some who doubt
the Emperor's sense of justice.

1243
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:28,950
They are mistaken. Because the
Emperor never makes a mistake.

1244
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:33,740
Man Singh, this is no time
for sermons. Obey my command.

1245
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:39,480
Obey!

1246
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:42,220
Obey!

1247
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:44,630
Obey!

1248
02:24:45,950 --> 02:24:48,070
What do I see, Man Singh?

1249
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,520
Silence?

1250
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:55,570
A silent rebellion?

1251
02:24:58,560 --> 02:24:59,960
But that won't happen!

1252
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:03,360
Akbar's orders shall
not be disregarded!

1253
02:25:07,290 --> 02:25:08,490
Shahbaz Khan!

1254
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,790
Jashn Singh!

1255
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,670
Obey my orders!

1256
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:24,900
Man Singh, I entrust this
task to you.

1257
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:29,920
Emperor, we Rajputs wield the swords
only on the battlefields.

1258
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:33,190
Please spare us the torture
of those that behead.

1259
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:38,020
Man Singh! I will blow
this conspiracy to smithereens!

1260
02:25:38,570 --> 02:25:41,840
I will trample this dangerous
uprising under my feet!

1261
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:46,430
Emperor Akbar shall not see
the walls of the mighty Moghuls...

1262
02:25:46,470 --> 02:25:53,520
crumble, while he lives! My faith
shall not crumble before my eyes!

1263
02:26:02,390 --> 02:26:07,660
Raja Man Singh, I will today write a
new chapter in Hindustan's history.

1264
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:11,461
I will myself take this sentence of
justice to its logical conclusion.

1265
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:32,380
Allah, Your humble servant...

1266
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:38,280
strives to uphold
Your laws on earth.

1267
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:43,920
If my voice be Your voice,
if my verdict be Your decision...

1268
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:48,280
grant strength to my hands
and courage to my heart.

1269
02:26:49,190 --> 02:26:50,290
Amen.

1270
02:26:51,070 --> 02:26:55,230
Emperor, your prayer has
the same effect...

1271
02:26:55,290 --> 02:26:58,560
that Hazrat lbrahim's prayer had,
when he sacrificed his son.

1272
02:26:59,270 --> 02:27:03,870
History is witness to how the son
accepted death with a smile.

1273
02:27:04,490 --> 02:27:06,630
And history shall bear testimony
to the fact...

1274
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:09,390
that a son today yearns to fulfill
his father's sense of justice.

1275
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:13,350
Step forward, Emperor. If it is
my face that prevents you...

1276
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:15,880
if it is the blood of your son
that weakens you...

1277
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:19,340
blindfold your eyes and mine.
It will make the sacrifice easier.

1278
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:42,470
Allah! The pride of Emperor Akbar
is reflected in a criminal's eyes.

1279
02:27:53,280 --> 02:28:00,530
That I face defeat in my endeavor
is proof of my wrong decision.

1280
02:28:02,210 --> 02:28:07,640
My weak admission loses
to your resolve.

1281
02:28:10,290 --> 02:28:12,060
I set you free.

1282
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:27,050
Release the poor Anarkali, too.

1283
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:41,960
Where is Anarkali?
Where have they taken her?

1284
02:28:42,660 --> 02:28:45,490
- Why don't you speak?
- I don't know, sire.

1285
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:49,490
Orders were to take her
to an isolated place...

1286
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:53,270
- to be buried alive.
- Allah!

1287
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,560
Go immediately and look everywhere!
Set her free, wherever she is.

1288
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:02,700
Those are the royal orders!

1289
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:46,730
True life is his...

1290
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:51,300
who gives himself up
to someone else...

1291
02:29:51,610 --> 02:29:55,410
and loses himself in love

1292
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:21,820
Hearts that could not meet
in this world...

1293
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:26,070
shall meet in God's world

1294
02:30:26,830 --> 02:30:30,950
Love shall blossom...

1295
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:34,630
in God's paradise

1296
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:51,160
Even if life is lost in love,
it matters not

1297
02:30:52,090 --> 02:30:56,330
True life is his...

1298
02:30:56,870 --> 02:31:00,810
who gives himself up
to someone else...

1299
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:05,010
and loses himself in love

1300
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:30,980
My story shall make them weep

1301
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:35,380
So will the lamp
that is lit on my tomb

1302
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:43,700
Even in the wilderness
shall this bud blossom

1303
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:57,420
Do not call this a tomb

1304
02:31:57,580 --> 02:32:01,550
It's a palace of love

1305
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:06,000
True life is his...

1306
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:10,310
who gives himself up
to someone else...

1307
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:14,500
and loses himself in love

1308
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:47,020
Twilight, I welcome

1309
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:51,970
I embrace this evening
of my life

1310
02:32:56,030 --> 02:33:00,760
In you, I shall immerse myself

1311
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:09,720
I shall forget the world

1312
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:15,900
If only I could see him once

1313
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:20,800
I'd say good-bye

1314
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:26,590
Good-bye, good-bye

1315
02:33:29,230 --> 02:33:31,390
Adieu

1316
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:35,890
Farewell

1317
02:34:36,830 --> 02:34:42,630
This grave is a symbol of love

1318
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:50,050
Of the poignant saga of love

1319
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:57,040
Of the wait for the bee...

1320
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:06,420
lies here Anarkali
