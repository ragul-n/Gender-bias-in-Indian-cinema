Here in the 8th Block,
inexperience is not an issue at all.

10
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,417
The supervisor here is a good man..

00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,992

Greetings..

29
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,972
What is this guy with a plant and all?

30
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,913
The chief has given permission for that..

31
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,115
A nice boy..

32
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,577
Open..Hmmm..

33
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,586

- Greetings..

36
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,809
Yes I did..

37
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,809
New warden Sir has joined..

38
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:54,943

00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:55,875

00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,123
Greeeetings...

42
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,091
For a greeting, so much
of emotions isn't required..

43
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,092
Sir, it is not emotions..

44
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,765
He has corns on his sole..

45
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,038
What is he saying?

46
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,047
He is the masseurforthe prisoners here..

47
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,708
If you have any breaks
or sprains in your body..

48
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,047
He would massage
and set them right is what he meant..

49
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,847
Massaging is all fine..

50
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,854
Ages back he while massaging on someone,

51
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,527
His hands slipped and landed
right at the jugular..

52
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,853
That guy's life ended there itself..

53
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,998
Now he is going through
this hell forthat accident..

54
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,435
Hey Kottaram... you have got your hearing
today..
Go... Get ready quickly..

55
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,198
Supervisor, me and today's judge
do not have a great relationship..

56
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,133
Even if I go to the court or not..

57
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,205
Let me tell you my fate..

58
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,135
I will be inside..

59
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,070
Should I go today?

60
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,143
Get lost...

61
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,747
Sir, whichever house he breaks into..

62
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,512
Only when the time is 12 midnight
will he start stealing.

63
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,254
Hey..Corny..

64
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,249
Everyjob has its schedule of working..

65
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,886
OthenNise will need to be in jail like you..

66
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,719
My Sir...thus in one house
he waited for 12 midnight to strike..

67
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,759
Where he waited was beneath the car..

68
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,053
He dozed of there..

69
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,130
So what if I dozed off..

70
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,460
Morning itself the landlord shook me awake..

71
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,735
And said, "lets go"..

72
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,096
I said, "fine"

73
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,738
He brought me right here..

74
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,906
Only later did I come to know..

75
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,266
He was a Magistrate..

76
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,472
That was just great...

77
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,937
Without wandering around the court premises,

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,147
he could reach his wife's home.

79
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,110
Cooo...

80
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,078
Waste of time...

81
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,218
- Sir, count is 24
- Yes..

82
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,143
- Sir, this is opened the last always..
- Why?

83
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,149
This is Bullet Raghavan's cell.

84
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,189
Hey...

85
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,621
Wake up and state your count..

86
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,193

88
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,059
Sir, stand aside..

89
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,933
He is a bit crooked..

90
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,102
Must have snorted some stuff in the morning..

91
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,100
Sir, please leave..

92
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,171
Sir, count is 24

93
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,140
Is it correct?

94
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,579
Yes, it is OK..

95
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,182
- I will change the duty and sign off..
- Ok..

96
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,747
- See you, supervisor
- Ya...

97
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,080
So then..all step out..

98
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,186
Lets go..

99
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,756
People in the 8th block..

100
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,297

101
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,998
People in the 8th block..

The cutting istoday here

103
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,169
Supervisor, Bullet Raghavan mentioned
about cutting something..

104
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,307
Oh Really..
And then have him cut something of mine..

105
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,208

106
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,976
Get a head that
could be the auspicious one for cutting..

107
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,009
In Jail!! Auspicious head!!..

108
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,774
- Take..
- This... Is it a head!

109
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:55,953
Supervisor..

110
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:56,887
He?

111
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,719
He is some Arab native.

112
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,290
Came here for treatment..

113
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,197
- The money he had and his passport someone
robbed
- Ohh...

114
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,336
- Someone from the embassy needs to come..
- Oh..

00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,761
Till then he will be here..

116
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:08,906
A good singer he is!

117
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,798
But the songs are all in Arabic..

118
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,772
Some face to look at..
Give me the mirror, dude

119
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,017
Shit...What are you doing?

120
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,158
You will never ever leave this place..

121
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,160
- Someone never seen water..
- I will go with you..

122
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,301
What...

123
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:37,865
What nonsense...

124
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,304
Would you stand aside and drain..

125
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,212

128
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:25,880
Krishnan Nair..

129
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,212
Is this to kill them orto pet them?

130
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,286
Throwing this way is to kill..

131
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,217
Why so?

132
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,322

00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,453
If it hits, the pigeon will die..

134
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,919
A piece can be thrown our way too..

135
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,030
We too are mute creatures..

136
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,891
If this Nair goes, what
would these pigeons do?

137
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:42,897
Even the pigeons will go..

138
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,929
Krishnan Nair, aren't the pigeons eating
Chapathi?

139
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,199
He is like this..

140
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,106
Every morning the chapathi
he gets gives it to these pigeons..

141
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,349
Apart from born criminals and criminals taken
on hire

00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,911
Amongst the ordinary ones about 60%

143

Have their own justification for
the actions they took, Sir..

144
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,887
But then those are not looked at by the law..

145
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,894

185
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,359
Go away

186
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,071
What is it..

187
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,609
Poor kid..

188
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,816
Su pervisor..what is his case?

189
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,618
Eloping with the girl he loved is the case

190
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,226
The father ofthis boy's
girl is not her real father..

191
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,917
His second wife is her mother

192
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,922
He had an eye on this girl..

193
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,927
One day he chased her...

194
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,427
Since these two were close
she ran into his house..

195
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,337
That man bribed the policemen and the case
was converted into attempt to molest

196
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,300
The boy gotjailed..

197
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,206
Man..Go and water the plant.

198
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,111
For that matter... there are
many stories to talk about

199
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,974
Here, each and every person has a story.

200
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,890
Trust you are fine..

201
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,185
Ya..nothing worrying..

202
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,225
Ah..that is what I do not like

203
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,488
Here...

204
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,998
A son for namesake...

205
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,132
In reality of no use..

206
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,932
Man..isn't this always the case

207
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,905
The son never picks up..

208
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,374
Taking away others time..

209
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,271
Stand aside..

210
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,277
Aren't you reaching?

211
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,078
Ok then lets not call today..

212
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,080
Some other time..

213
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,144
That would be better..

214
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,478
Ya..That is good..

215
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,478
Leave..

216
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,420
Here..

217
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,323
Next one..

218
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,925
Here...

219
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,272
- Hello..dear daughter..
- Dad..

220
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,370
Aren't you well, dear?

221
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,634
Mom always picks fight with me

222
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,679
Don't take all that seriously..

223
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,413
Daddy would be stepping out soon..

224
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,907
lwish to see you dad

225
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,684
Shall I come?

226
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,982
No dear..l will come over..

227
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,988
Still shall I come to see you, dad?

228
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:00,987
Leave all that..

229
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,421
Today being Deepavali,
did you visit the temple?

230
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,127
Hey..hey.. Enough..

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:05,626
Hang up and leave..

232
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:06,430
Time is over..

233
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,359
Sir, a second please..Please..

234
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,034
His one second...

235
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,036
Dear.. Daddy will come soon..

236
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,261
-It is timeto hang up..
-Your second is done

237
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:16,967
Take this..

238
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,370
Who isthe next second..Come...Come..

239
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,206
Daughter...appears to be scared..

240
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,407
Nothing to be scared..

241
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,685
Isn't she with her mother..

242
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,328
Man..You need to come over..

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,140
Sir, 
 just came to meet that supervisor..

244
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,808
- Supervisor
- Supervisor

245
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,239
There is an interview

246
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,344
In the interview ha

..

247
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,810
Hearing him one could thinkthat
for some Government job the interview is on..

248
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,814
To dig into this poor's deadness
and cause pain some idiot has come prepared..

249
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,085
Come on...

250
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,654
Come this way..

251
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,155
Leave me..

252
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,697
Hey.. Hey...

253
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,696
Sir

254
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,765
Get lost Sir..

255
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,235
Supervisor

256
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,371
You get up and get lost..

257
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,476
This was not needed!

258
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,858
Beat him

259
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:40,596
Beat him up...

260
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,456
Beat him

261
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,282
Kathrina...Kathrina..

262
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,314
Please Come

263
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,865
Sir...there is nothing in it..

264
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,694
Just medicine and bathing soap..

265
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,869
Nothing else...

266
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,264
Number it and keep it aside..

267
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,735
Alex supervisor’s sister..

268
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,537
Further, Superintendent John's
permission is also there..

269
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,402
For Supervisor to speak with his sister
outside..

270
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,476
Whatever is there do it..

271
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,735
Don't take much time..

272
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,380
Yes..Sure..

273
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,721
Why are you crying?

274
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,562
To see my brother likethis...

275
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,326
Wasn't it for me too..

276
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,700
What is it you are saying?

277
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,038
Where is he? Varghese?

278
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,878
No.. He has not come till now..

279
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,743
A useless person's coming is of no use too..

280
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,809
Every time you come I say this same thing..

281
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,076
Do you get to see my son?

282
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,048
Would it be possible to get him along here?

283
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,785
Not possible I know..

284
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,020
How is brotherAbdul?

285
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,027
Pretty long time since I saw him.

286
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,557
Unable to walk..

287
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,896
Yet keeps talking about coming here..

288
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,396
His not coming leaves me
without any local news..

289
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,701
Dear brother, have you ever hated me?

290
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,046
What is this you are saying?

291
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,477
A good part of life...

292
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,720
Inside this..

293
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,382
Having lost everything

294
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,123
When I think...

295
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,787
Feel I will lose my stability

296
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,855
Don't you have any job?

297
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,691
These are fate, dear..

298
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,496
If you are going to stand and cry like this..

299
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,431
Don't come..

300
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,130
I don't like all this crying and emotions..

301
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,773
Supervisor...

302
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,173
Time...

303
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,012
lam not worrying you, brother..

304
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:41,984
lam leaving..

305
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:25,457
What is it?

306
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,595
In reality who is this Alex supervisor?

307
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,527
Who is he?

308
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,820
From Pala when I reached Adivaram
with my father Pullakunnel Philipose

309
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,250
lwas all offourteen...

310
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,820
What is it? What happened?

311
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,994
- Got beaten..
- Why...

312
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,059
That MattukattaSadashivan

313
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,891
Because I asked the wages
for having worked on his land

314
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,927
He hit me in front of his
house like beating a dog

315
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,500
We can't allow that guy free any longer..

316
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,997
Anything needs to be done immediately..

317
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,205
Take him to the hospital immediately

318
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,136
Come"

319
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,508
Those days the entire Adivaram
was under Mattukatta Sadhashivam

320
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,122
till our last breath.."

321
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,189
Don't be afraid..Come..

322
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,713
For our parents we are four children..

323
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,714
lam the youngest..

324
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,185
Red Salute!

325
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,921
Red Salute!

326
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:57,709
Like our Jesus Christ that person
is someone who sacrificed himself forthe poor.

327
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,317
Here also there are many poor people

328
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,949
When a filth Mattakata Sadhasivan
controls the Valley,

329
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,020
Our poor Christ alone ain't enough

330
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,055
Dynamic Krishna Pillai is needed

331
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,028
Blood for Blood must fall!

332
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,030
This when I hold in my hand,

333
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,636
Not sure how...
but like a phython crawling.

334
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,699
Courages crawls in

335
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,370
Not Mattukattai...

336
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,971
Give a damn to any bigwig then!

337
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,739
Hey, stand there

338
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,341
Come

339
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,775
Dad, Elephant!

340
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,953
If not Elephant, will your forefathers
come to the woods then?

341
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,051
Hold this

342
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,722
Dip it

343
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,351
Dip I say

344
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:48,961
Dad!

345
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,061
Come

346
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,865
Come here if dare!

347
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,968
Don't expect you can graze here!

348
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,336
Come if you dare

349
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,042
(laughing)

350
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,180
Don'ttry to frighten us!

351
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,781
lwill burn you down

352
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:06,945
Get away

353
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,876
Say boldly!

354
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,751
Any rogue elephants can come if dare!

355
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,853
G o away.

356
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,319
Get away

357
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,758
Get away

358
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,727
Get away

359
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,094
Hold it

360
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,105
No Elephant can stand against a
man's defiance!

361
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,071
This strength you musterfrom the jungle

362
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,103
Until you have it, no one can defeat you!

363
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,480
How long are we
going to live in fear of those rogues?

364
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,312
Don't we need a change in this?

365
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,284
So we should stand together

366
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,016
Those words provided me the confidence

367
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,923
Dad was becoming an entire village's
inspiration

368
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,963
Against Mattukatta Sadashivam
who was doing injustice towards labourers

369
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,098
my dad united the workers!

370
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,385
Under dad's leadership,
a flagstaff arose there

371
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:21,981
That was the workers' organisation's first red
flag
bearing flagstaff in Adivaram!

372
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,306
Hey, Your bloody communism!!

373
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,773
This is Mattukatta Sadasivan's territory

374
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,979
This place does not need your party or flag

375
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,306
Take it and get lost

376
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:45,879
Hell with him!

377
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,312
Remove all

378
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:48,943
Hey you!

379
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,153

388
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,910

Long live revolution

407
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,991

Dad!

413
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,486
For every drop of blood revenge we shall seek

414
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,252
Police Atrocity, down down

415
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,929
Police Atrocity, down down

416
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:45,062
Running from amidst protesters
holding my dad and crying

417
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,103
the Kathrina being my little sister
I learntjust that day

418
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,264
ldidn't ask dad anything

419
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,305
In front of hertears,

In this hill-farmers' sweat soaked
soil ofAdivaram...

425
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,354
The first person to hoist a red flag here,

426
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,500
was Comrade Philipose with his brave hands!!

427
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,934
Our dearest Comrade Philipose,

Long live revolution

433
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,352
Go over there and play dear

434
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,622
lf mom comes to know about her...

435
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,714
Before knowing the truth about Kathrina,
Mom left us

436
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,015
Followed by Dad

437
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,185
"Death will come once"

438
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,355
"Bearin mind you mortals"

439
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,386
"Go along with you"

440
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,615
"all actions in your life"

441
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:54,196
"Do good deeds without being lazy"

442
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,629
"Death will come once"

443
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,564
"Bearin mind you mortals"

444
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,102
"Go along with you"

445
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,104
"all actions in your life"

446
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:10,269
"Do good deeds without being lazy"

447
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,176
Body is being taken to the church

448
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,645
Is there anyone left to see the body?

449
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,247
Yes, there is!

450
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,419
Kathrina!

451
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,455
Go..

452
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:32,127
Dad!

453
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:39,634
Dear come

454
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,441
Don't cry, come.

455
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,842
Brother, our dad..

456
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,230
Are you sending her away,

457
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,868
Or you want us to leave?

458
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,429
She neither has a dad nor mom

459
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,536
Leaving her on the roads,
will not be forgiven by the Lord

460
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,140
What about the deceit dad did to mom?

461
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,310
Is that forgivable one?

462
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,273
Don't forgive

463
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,413
Supporting a wrong
is a greater wrong than the wrong done

464
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,615
What do you want me to do now?

465
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,744
Leave it, brother! I will go away

466
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,715
Don't quarrel amongst you because of me.

467
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:57,785
You keep quiet

468
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,715
To have all of you reach this far..

469
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,223
land dad toiled hard in the forests ofAdivaram,
not for one or two years

470
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,394
But for 16 long years!!

471
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,790
Because we spent days and nights
without food and sleep and built all these,

472
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,134
that had you all get these nice
people as husbands!

473
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,730
One more thing

474
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,563
This house was built with my sweat too

475
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,567
Who stays or leaves, I decide!

476
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,233
Alex, then do one thing, give our share

477
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,376
Brother-in-law's share was
given at her marriage itself

478
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,408
75 Soverigns!

479
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,705
Similar 75 and 100 Sovereigns...

480
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:23,938
All of you have got.

481
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,282
If more is wanted, I will give you

482
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,654
Here.. the will father wrote
before his death!

483
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,727
Enough for three of you!

484
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,257
Take

485
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,267
And this is my share..

486
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,264
This also three of you divide and eat.

487
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,570
And I'm taking her

488
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,703
Dad's blood, isn't she?

489
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,740
I own little land there..

490
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,908
We will live there.

491
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,276
Get in, dear..Go.

492
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,221
Why are you worrying?

493
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,453
Dad is also no more.

494
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:11,989
Who else do l have now?

495
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,556
Then who am 
?

496
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,432
Now on, I'm your dad and mom, understood?

497
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:17,958
Don't worry

498
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,461
Okay

499
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:21,828
Look at m e.

500
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,674
This brother is with you, got it?

501
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,407
(Fight)

502
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,751
Only Pullakunnel Philipose is dead

503
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,756
His son is still alive

504
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,495
My dad hoisted this flag

505
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,489
lf dare touch this flag

506
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,725
I will hoist another flag
smeared with your blood!

507
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,959
You keep yourflag and I will keep myflag

508
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,864
That's enough

509
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:53,920
"Red Salute..."

510
00:39:54,625 --> 00:40:03,124
"A red dawn is awakening,
listen to the call comrades"

511
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:13,467
"Time to rewrite history, young bravehearts"

512
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:21,448
"Though enslaved, destroyed,

514
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:34,799
"spread come along holding high the red flags
on the paths of a new era"

515
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,461
"Red Salute..."

516
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:06,930
"Even when chests weighed heavy
never we let the flag fall"

517
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:16,764
"Toiling and sweating is the group we are"

518
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,599
"Red Salute..."

519
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:27,149
"To guide, to partner,
a red flag's shade is present"

520
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:36,917
"A mass with hot blood gives life, hold the flag"

521
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:44,765
"Slavery on the planet swept
away by the red flag"

522
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:53,934
"A red dawn is awakening,
listen to the call comrades"

523
00:41:54,979 --> 00:42:04,115
"Time to rewrite history, young bravehearts"

524
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:12,118
"Though enslaved, destroyed,
they the ones woke up"

525
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:18,268

526
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:27,135
"spread come along holding the red flags

527
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,606
"Red Salute..."

528
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,283
Praise the Lord, father

529
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,184
Yes Alex, started harvesting Pineapples?

530
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,620
Yeah Father..it's the first crop..

531
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,887
So let this be forthe Church

532
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,595
That is great..Come

533
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,028
Why giving it to the Church?

534
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,703
Offering I guess!

535
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,031
As far as I know,

536
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,835
Philipose chettan even to take shelter from rain
hasn't stepped into the church

537
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,770
Even though he didn't want the Lord,

538
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,312
He was a gentleman of goodness and love!

539
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,845
What is the noise there, Father?

540
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,179
It's a final rehearsal

541
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,945
- Margam Kali(Christian Dance)
- Oh

542
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,783
Church festival must rockthis time!

543
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:15,956
See you then

544
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:37,647
(Christian Traditional dance)

545
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,882
What is all this? Dance-drama?

546
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,607
No, Isn't this Kuchipudi?

547
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,943
Shut up you. This is Bhartanatyam

548
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,256
-
t's not Bharatnatyam
- Then?

549
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,317
No..?

550
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,048
This is Margam Kali(Christian Dance)

551
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,023
If so, then give a different name for it

552
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,389
Didn't like it?

553
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,861

How can you go away like that?

663
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,816
Shouldn't the girl have a look ofthe boy?

664
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,488

Marry her and come

682
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,617
Shouldn't her brothers agree?

683
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,080
She is their dearest sister

684
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,380
If she tells a word,
next day they will perform the marriage

685
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,249
No need.

686
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,152
First you get married,
then I will think about mine

687
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,623
No way. Meet Varkeyacchayan tomorrow
and discuss the matter

688
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,261
And then come back home

689
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,914
Alex, how is the food?

Tapioca and buffalo meat is super super!!

692
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:38,217
Did Annie make it?

693
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,523
She has got Mom's gift!

694
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:41,416
Really?

695
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,351
Then, letAlex marry her

696
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,688
While we can eat Tapioca
and buffalo meat every day!

697
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:48,889
Let Alex say

698
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,457
lfAnnie is interested, then I'm interested

699
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,370
No, I'm not interested

700
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,835
I'm serious lass!

701
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,267
I'm also serious

702
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,345
She must have joked

703
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:11,714
You eat

704
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,957
Would anyonejoke in marriage matters?

705
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,254
Hey Alex

706
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,788
I know both of you are close to each other

707
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,355
Then why did you reject him?

708
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,486
My brother loved you immensely

709
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:22,987
"0 love, sprouting as leaves and flowers,"

710
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,888
"Hereafter you are with me"

711
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,496
"- Entwined with me"

712
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:42,371
"The damp sunlight is coming
to my door today for the first time"

713
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:57,290
"The dawns, days and nights are unusually
sweet"

714
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,826
"...nights..."

715
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:25,977
Dead

716
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:29,649
This is the reason.

717
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,013
And it's not that I don't love you

718
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:45,126
"You strung my heart in a twine of golden
thread'

719
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:54,604
"You wrote dreams in my blooming eyes"

720
00:56:54,911 --> 00:57:04,411
"Now it is winter in these melting creepers"

721
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:19,764
"The dawns, days and nights are unusually
sweet"

722
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:48,496
"Now there is company in rain and snow"

723
00:57:48,731 --> 00:58:03,169
"0 heart, will you sing softly, sweetly"

724
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:14,048
"The dawns, days and nights are unusually
sweet"

725
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:40,039
(Prayers)

726
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,046
Amen!

727
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,054
You carry on praying, I will be back now

728
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,820
He fled! Don't spare him

729
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,826
Hurry up..Catch him

730
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,128
A church and 300 Doors ...!

731
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,271
Stop..

732
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,129

733
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,934
- What is the problem?
- I don't know

734
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,041
Never let me live peacefully

735
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,304
Hey stop

736
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,621
Move..Move fast

737
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,326
Catch him

738
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,591
Don't leave him

739
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,529
For doing a good deed,
does one need to be chased like this?

740
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,929
- You can't catch me
- Stop..Stop

741
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,293
Stop I say

742
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,304
lam telling you..Stop

743
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:50,346
-Where was he running to?
- I don't know..

744
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,877
Police and Army all are behind him

745
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,317
What is the issue..
Police and Army are here..

746
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,157
Weren't you aware of it?

747
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,190
How will I know?

748
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,349
He visits once in a year during holidays

749
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,161
That Varghese is no.1 fraud!

750
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,027
Toddy, Ganja, Women..

751
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,030
As it's a Church, I'm not saying anything more.

752
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:06,894
He..the other day..

753
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,071
Ouch my leg.

754
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,206
Assaulted a Major ofthe Army!

755
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,274
It is forthe Court Martial,
they have come to arrest him

756
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:14,905
Court Master!! Who is that?

757
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,942
Who is this silly guy! Like Police

758
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,374
Even Army has a law and Court

759
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:19,906
Except one difference

760
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,582
Ourthrashings go a bit soft

761
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,351
And in theirs that would be missing!

762
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,913
If they land their hands on him..

763
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,849
What shall we do now, Alex?

764
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:33,856
What to do, lkka?

765
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,032
Because of that rascal,
my children's rituals have become a mess!

766
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,267
Don't worry

767
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,170
I'll go and enquire

768
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:02,191
Katherina..Dear Katherina

769
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,385
Slept off?

770
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,191
Hasn't she returned home?

771
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,377
Katherina, your colonel has come..

772
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:29,284
- Thanks bro-in-law!
- For what?

773
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,383
I should have got this little earlier

774
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,914
Listen...Don't..make a fool of me..

775
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,716
lam saying this on my heart..

776
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:41,023
Do you know, it was after offering of
golden crucifix to Malayatoor Church,

777
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,390
- l was born..
- That I understood now..

778
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,298
You are the one crucifying us!!

779
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,201
Everyone love, pampered and spoilt me!

780
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,971
I've never known hardship in my lifetime

781
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,173
Ask her if you want

782
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,808
l have given a lot of worries, dear?

783
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,207
Please forgive me

784
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:04,478
Sister-in-law, you also know that it
bro-in-law alone who looks after all of us

785
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,145
Do you think I would have done all that?

786
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,017
Are you asking that to me

787
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,156
Got to ask!

788
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,882
Got have asked that, bro-in-law!

789
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,328
Should have scolded me! I swear

790
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,957
No one corrected me

791
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,730
Never tried to mend me either!

792
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,166
At least now beat me, bro-in-law!

793
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,360
Let me reform

794
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:23,172
Ask him to hit me

795
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,036
Not hitting me?

796
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,344
Army..

797
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,507
Please don't have me over

798
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,177
lt's Court Martial!
Look at the way they come

799
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,941
lf get me, they will hammer me..

800
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,449
lsn't you who said getting
beaten would mend you?

801
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,286
They will thrash nicely
And you can also reform

802
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,184
Please bro-in-law!
I will go somewhere and survive

803
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,756
- Where to?
- Canada...

804
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,859
Canada!! Forget Canada,
they will not let you cross this Kaloopara,

805
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,392
Without serving the punishment!

806
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:48,057
Could I see my daughter?

807
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:48,923
She slept

808
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:51,726
Rascal! Are you coming out
or shall we come in?

809
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,402
- We knew that you will be in here
Come out-Go..

810
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:55,496
Aren't they calling to reform you

811
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:56,495
Pull him out

812
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,168
For long he has been making us run around..
Take him..

813
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,034
- Dear!- Hubby!

814
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,207
Sir, release him only after he reformed

815
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,877
Move..rascal Walk..

816
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,819
You don't worry.
Could be only for one or two years..

817
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,180
Later they will set him free.

818
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:13,986
Let him come back after serving punishment

819
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,817
Whetherto Canada or America,
I will send him wherever he wishes to!

820
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,352
Good if he changes to better!

821
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,195
Come

822
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,568
Oh! Katrina! Look who is coming!

823
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,884
- Lost yourjob, is it?
- Yes

824
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,416
Then why walk around in that Uniform?

825
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,217
Still my desire is not fulfilled!

826
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,822
That's why didn't remove it

827
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,188
Tea!

828
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,189
Get in

829
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,488
Drink tea!

830
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,089
Let the weariness of the war disappear!

831
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,994
Ain't sweet!
Milk too would've been fine

832
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,268
Ain't sweet. Milk would've be fine

833
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:39,430
What next?

834
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,900
No plans

835
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,233
Drink tea and survive, is it?

836
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,241
Want to survive

837
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,190
To send Varappan to Canada,
why mortgage this house and property?

838
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,194
Katrina also owns 3 acres of land, isn't it?

839
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,196
Can't you mortgage that?

840
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,197
Katrina did tell me that

841
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:05,993
Let's not pledge that

842
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,293
Don't you know Varappan's nature?

843
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:08,902
If he doesn't repay the loan,

844
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,333
My sister and child will be on the streets

845
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,068
You also have a wife and child

846
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,074
Don't get angry

847
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,368
ljust told you the fact

848
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,898
Carry it carefully

849
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,002
This is the passbook

850
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,232
lwill neverforgetthis help, bro-in-law

851
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,501
I don't mind you forgetting this help

852
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,138
But please don't forget to send
money to repay the installments

853
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,041
Bless you with a good life!!

854
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,544
I can only afford to do this much!

855
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,016
Vargheese, didn't gone any where

856
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,683
The entire cash gone after
joined hands with Sudarshan

857
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:17,032
(Blabbering...)

858
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,403
Hey Vargheese! Pour some more

859
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:22,735
Yes I poured!

860
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:24,346
Enough"

861
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,538
Sir doesn't matter, how much
ever you wish, I will pour

862
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,347
I'm full free

863
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,749
-You pour
- Here I did!

864
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:35,952
I'm okay

865
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,319
Drink guys! Why keep watching?

866
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,689
Let the liver cook well!

867
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,233
- Best..This is best..the best..
- Okay

868
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,009
This year's profit of our society is

869
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,410
Two lakhs thirteen thousand
eight hundred fourteen

870
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,119
Yes, 213814]-

871
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:12,026
This amount to be used for the proposed
Committee office building's foundation

872
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,627
and floor construction is
what the Committee has decided..

873
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:16,356
Comrade!

874
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:17,224
Yes Chandraetta!

875
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,369
From our Society's fund, lend a little money
and help me

876
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,434
It is for my son's college admission

877
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:23,705
One lac will be enough

878
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,007
As a security, I will give you my land
documents!

879
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:31,344
That Chandretta... for personal needs not to
use
the society funds is the rule!

880
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,275
Your bloody rule!

881
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,418
Then why the hell form a Committee for?

882
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,119
You needn't talk more

883
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,014
Please be seated Chandraetta

884
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,380
For sitting I will come..

885
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,315
When a person is in need..

886
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,423
He will say all that..

887
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,493
Society funds should not
used for any other purpose!

888
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,446
Where is mom?

889
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,340
-Mom
- I'm here

890
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,578
Water ,Ai fluid, drink

891
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,521
-What is this?
- The Manager had met at the junction

892
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,551
Can't give any more time he said

893
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,452
Want some tea?

894
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,285
Mom, what is the synonym for house?

895
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,293
lfthere is a house,
only then can there be synonym

896
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,858
Didn't you say Agricultural Society fund is
available?

897
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,429
For a short period, adjusting from that..

898
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,866
That transaction is not possible.
No rule for that.

899
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,137
Can I change the rule for me alone?

900
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,330
Not only for the Party

901
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,567
In a home too are certain responsibilities!

902
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,544
To sell, that vehicle is the only thing remaining!

903
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,679
lf sold, it may fetch just scrap value!

904
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,285
Stay cool, Annie! Some way will open up

905
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,384
What way?

906
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,347
Not a petty amount,

907
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,418
It is in Lakhs!!

908
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:02,429
Pledge these ornaments

909
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:03,763
Get about 50000 Rupees

910
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,572
Remit that in the bank

911
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,637
And ask for one month's grace

912
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:08,766
Don't worry.

913
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,272
At least now don't only support
brother-in-law and sister

914
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,244
Start working for yourself too..

Case is totally different

999
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,578

You rascal! You are hell bent
to ruin my family, is it?

1009
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,146

in farms and fields..

01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,146
Is what! have given him,

1011
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,580
That because of concern for them!

1012
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,488
You will never reform!

1013
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,018
A big Communist!

1014
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,826
What is wrong with a Communist?

1015
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,931
If you are that idealistic,
why did you bribe here?

1016
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:01,626
- Hey you..
- You come here

1017
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,469
God will punish him

1018
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:07,633
Is he a human being!

1019
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:08,842
You come here

1020
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,579

1021
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,880

1022
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,019
Chandraetta.. Don't get provoked..

1023
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,918
What did you say? You spoke of
your rule the other day, didn't you?

1024
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,125
Don't make a fuss in the Party office

1025
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,519
Is this Party office your ancestral home?

1026
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,124
You please go away

1027
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,864
When I asked a loan for my son,
What did he say?

1028
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,124
That's why I asked you to go

1029
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:33,926
Here he comes!

1030
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:35,861
Stop..Stop the Jeep

1031
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,238
When asked money for
my son's college admission,

1032
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,234
What did you say?

1033
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,134
Then there is no rule for that.

1034
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,137
Now when your brother-in-law
was caught in ganja case,

1035
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:48,875
To get him off you utilised Society funds..

1036
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,007
Don't stare

1037
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,814
Your brother-in-law himself conveyed this to
me

1038
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,752
Comrades walking around to cheat people!!

1039
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,857
Get away

1040
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,989
Comrades working for country's welfare!!

1041
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,865
-Are you not getting down
- No

1042
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,069
You paid the loan?

1043
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:46,933
Hmm..Yes

1044
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,140
Where did you pay?

1045
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,835
In the Bank or Forest Office?

1046
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,611
Learnt to tell lies also, haven't you?

1047
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,282
What else do I do? Isn't she my sibling?

1048
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:56,174
Sibling!!

1049
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,945
Always it is about your
sister and herfamily!!

1050
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:01,514
You love your sister..He
p her..

1051
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,051
ldidn't stop you, did I?

1052
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:05,986
This is not Love but Madness!!

1053
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:06,956
Complete Madness!

1054
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,055
Despair and hardship are not
only for your Sister

1055
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,290
Even others have!

1056
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,526
When she is in danger,
What should I do you say?

1057
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:16,633
What danger!

1058
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:18,828
Did they meet with any accident?

1059
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,338
Or got hospitalised for any illness?

1060
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,941
The person smuggling ganja
with family beside him..

1061
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,841
Before even having him in the family
you should have given a thought.

1062
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:30,675
Even otherwise here...

1063
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,051
What is the point of talking that again?

1064
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,150
I made a mistake

1065
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,791
No, It's me who made a mistake

1066
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,193
Despite knowing my illness, you gave me life,

1067
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,331
I started loving you immensely.

1068
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,995
l obeyed whatever you said

1069
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,169
Now I understood

1070
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,638
It's not for love you married this sick woman

1071
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,200
Annie, don't talk crap

1072
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,842
Words once spoken cannot be retrieved

1073
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:55,975
What's wrong if I talk?

1074
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:57,975
You took advantage of my illness

1075
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,838
My family life and child is
your beneficence towards me!

1076
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,278
And you can live as you please

1077
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,854
You also know I will live like
a slave irrespective of what you do

1078
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,690
Isn't that why you gave the
entire property to your sister?

1079
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,686
And the house and fields, you pledged at
bank for saving your brother-in-law

1080
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,154
Whenever anyone comes asking for help,

1081
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,025
You have given whatever you had to people!

1082
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,197
What have you given to yourwife and child?

1083
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,163
Tell me

1084
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,863
Only this sacred thread is left on me

1085
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:23,967
You want this also?

1086
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:24,934
Take it

1087
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,369
Otherthan walking around as a Comrade,
trying to find out about people's concerns

1088
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,677
Have you everfound out whether
I have clothes to change and wear?

1089
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,342
Your loving son's school fees
is yet to be paid

1090
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,085
Please be patient

1091
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,184
Give me some more time..

1092
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,287
lwill bring everything in order..

1093
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:40,851
Time?

1094
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:41,954
Isn't it 8 -10 yrs now?

1095
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,214
Isn't that time enough?

1096
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:44,726
Now everything is over!

1097
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,061
We can move on to the road..

1098
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,193
And beg

1099
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,158
Will you stop it?

1100
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,390
lf sister alone was enough,
then why marry me?

1101
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,391
Can't you hug and sleep with her?

1102
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,302
How dare you..

1103
01:17:58,373 --> 01:17:59,169
Talking nonsense..

1104
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,365
Been controlling myself...

1105
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,208
Even othenNise I'm standing on fire..

1106
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,173
Amidst that..

1107
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:46,446
Uncle

1108
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:47,885
Uncle

1109
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,788
- Uncle
-Yes son..

1110
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,383
What

1111
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,385
What happened?

1112
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,956
Dad..Dad..

1113
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:56,960
Tell the matter

1114
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:57,961
Dad killed mom

1115
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,094
Eh!

1116
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,497
Lisie, Annie is in trouble

1117
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,163
Where, son?

1118
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:05,033
Overthere

1119
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,056
Hey you..

1120
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,058
-Why did you..
- You killed her, is it?

1121
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,060
You killed our sister, is it?

1122
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:35,503
You rascal, you killed her, is it?

1123
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,874
Vargheeachha...Our loving sister

1124
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,881
See whatAlex has done!

1125
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,985
Somebody lift him up

1126
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:19,845
Supervisor, what happened?

1127
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,477
Why are you covering your ears?

1128
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:38,292
When my son shouted that Dad killed Mom,

1129
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,058
My heart was broken

1130
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,201
All my relations are broken after
my Annie is gone.

1131
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,907
One by one was broken like that.

1132
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,208
It is said that all relationships are bindings.

1133
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,614
It is better not to have any relations.

1134
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,144
Now lfeel better.

1135
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:03,620
Here I am only locked with this key

1136
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:07,991
Supervisor!

1137
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:15,592
Sir!

1138
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,836
- I came with glad news forAlex.
- What is it, Sir?

1139
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,405
Supervisor, your parole is sanctioned.

1140
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,973
You should be having
good hold with higher officials.

1141
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:22,971
I don't have any hold with them.

1142
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:23,973
Is it true?

1143
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,611
The order has come. You can leave tomorrow.

1144
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,550
Krishnan Nair! My parole has been sanctioned!

1145
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:33,182
Supervisor, you should offer
a coconut to Lord Ganapati in here.

1146
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,252
I had vowed for that.

1147
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,354
Of course, I will

1148
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:36,952
Dude Aravind!

1149
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,623
My parole has been sanctioned!

1150
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:42,196
Monis! Hey Kottaram! Hey Aani!

1151
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,921
My parole has been sanctioned!

1152
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,292
So, you can leave tomorrow!

1153
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:52,302
Sir, is ittrue? Not to trick me, right?

1154
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,598
lam very happy, Sir

1155
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:03,974
It was good thatAlex's Police report
was favourable

1156
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,152
Supervisor’s credibility and good behaviour,

1157
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,255
along with that our support helped for it too.

1158
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,362
Vinod! l have signed all the files.

1159
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,533
Please release him fast finishing
all the proceedings.

1160
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,527
Sir, l have sent his wage details
to the accounts.

1161
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:22,596
Tell them to approve it fast,

1162
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,235
and transfer the money to Alex's account ok?

1163
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,539
Hey Supervisor, I heard the news.

1164
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,580
- You are going out on parole today, aren't you?
- Yes.

1165
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,648
Dude Kili! Give his civil to him, C101

1166
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,181
101?

1167
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:42,518
Yes. Please sign here.

1168
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,521
- Supervisor!
- Yes

1169
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,630
Don't try to return immediately.

1170
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,228
Won't the police men look for me?

1171
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,968
There is an idea for that.

1172
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:56,965
After you reach home,

1173
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,672
call the Jailor and tell him
that you have resigned.

1174
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,373
How long you have been living here.

1175
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:03,544
It is enough.

1176
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,508
Anyway, for whom are you saving
all this money?

1177
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:07,739
Sir, has he not recovered yet?

1178
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,243
Only sometimes he feels
like missing something.

1179
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,386
After some time, he becomes normal.

1180
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,350
Now, he is missing something, am I right?

1181
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,046
Not only me, you too Sir.

1182
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,552
What should I bring for you
when I come back?

1183
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,258
Can you bring a mobile phone
with good range?

1184
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:23,658
I did a mistake by asking you.

1185
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,262
Don't waste your time talking to him.
You go.

1186
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:27,230
Ok then.

1187
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,233
Give that to me!

1188
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:35,103
Good man! But went out on parole.

1189
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:47,388

"Brother is on parole today"

1194
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,772
"It is festival forjail"

1195
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,803
"Forthe lock of iron bars and
the strong walls"

1196
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:12,338
"Bro, it is laughter like blooming sparklers"

1197
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,414
"Brother is on parole today"

1198
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,245

"We want dance in the front gate"

01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,675
"We want songs from lathi's lips"

1203
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,812
"We want rhythm on our plates"

1204
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,808
"We want dance in the front gate"

1205
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,845
"We want songs from lathi's lips"

1206
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,381
"We want rhythm on our plates"

1207
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,559
"If the superintendent pleases to smile"

1208
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:01,523
"We can make the party a grand success"

1209
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,562
"If the superintendent pleases to smile"

1210
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:07,461
"We can make the party a grand success"

1211
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,535
"On the steps of thejail, there is play"

1212
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,571
"The jailor Sir is also jumping with joy"

1213
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:19,644
"Parole period, a good parole period"

1214
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:26,447
"lt's parole period, for brother

1215
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:35,094
"If it spreads to the village

"And when the lock-up story is served"

01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,367
"These people will let theirtongues loose"

1218
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,402
"If it spreads to the village
and becomes superb"

1219
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:47,439
"And when the lock-up story is served"

1220
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:50,610
"These people will let theirtongues loose"

1221
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,679
"Brother is on parole today"

1222
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,578

"lt's parole period, for brother
it's parole period"

1225
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,390
l was also very happy like this,

1226
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,124
when I went out on parole for the first time

1227
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:17,404
But they had to call the army
to bring me back.

1228
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,637
What a fantastic memory!

1229
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,569
You should not do like that,

1230
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:21,570
you should come back, ok?

1231
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:22,707
Sure, I will come back.

1232
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,211
Please visit my house when you have time.

1233
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:26,209
And please see my daughter.

1234
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,712
lwill do that. lwill go to
his house also.

1235
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,814
I need to visit his parents

1236
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:35,416
and also the girl who has been
waiting for him. Ok then

1237
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,420
Supervisor, I don't have
any one to enquire about me.

1238
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,624
Once a person is injail,

1239
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:41,226
not even his relatives like him.

1240
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,556

 feel happy when 
 see people
going out of this place.

1241
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:44,390
That's enough for me.

1242
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:45,293
Ok then

1243
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,967
Ok, Ok

1244
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:03,278
Sir,

1245
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:09,721
Alex, the whole Central jail
is celebrating your parole.

1246
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:11,587
This is thefirst time a person,

1247
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,294
is sent on parole with music and dance.

1248
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:15,690
You are happy, aren't you?

1249
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,264
Sir, thank you for all the help
you have done for me.

1250
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:24,632
We, officers are always
good friends to loyal prisoners.

1251
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:25,897
Don't waste time, you can leave.

1252
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,467
I will take leave then.

1253
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,206

Alex, no need to tell you.
Come back on time.

1256
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:43,881
I will surely reach, Sir.

1257
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,259
When you come back,

1258
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:47,553
- then also you should look happy like this.
- I know.

1259
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,320
Or we will be in trouble.

1260
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:51,891
Sir, lam leaving.

1261
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,824
Sir, shall I deductAlex from the Count?

1262
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,264
Yes sir, okay sir

1263
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,337
Alex! One minute.

1264
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:01,968
Superintendent is calling you.

1265
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:04,473
Go quickly

1266
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:17,252
Sir, you called me as when
everything was done

1267
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,949
and ljust stepped out ofthejail

1268
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:21,792
Alex, I called you..

1269
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:23,554
Sir, whatever you ask me to,

1270
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:24,697
I will leave only after I finish the job.

1271
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:26,332
To polish your shoes, iron the shirts

1272
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,560
or to arrange the files, whatever you say.

1273
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,297
Is there any work in the quarters?

1274
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,705
Not that Alex.

1275
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:39,508
Then what?

1276
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:43,046
I received the FAX message
cancelling your parole.

1277
01:28:58,599 --> 01:28:59,566
On certain occasions,

1278
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,665
parole can get cancelled naturally.

1279
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:06,602
lfthere is a threat to the person
who is released on parole

1280
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:11,301
Or if that person is a threat to someone else,

1281
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,070
In that case, parole can get cancelled.

1282
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:17,641
In this case, your son did it.

1283
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:20,419
Is it true?

1284
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:24,090
Could it be that someone else
used his signature for that?

1285
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,591
That can't happen, right?

1286
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,931
Policemen won't do anything against me.

1287
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,335
Then, lam going back to the cell.

1288
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,501
l have to give these clothes back.

1289
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:42,800
He is the one, isn't he?

1290
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,580
Sir, It's sad.

1291
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,984
This is the saddest incident in my service.

1292
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,861
ls his son that much troublesome?

1293
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:03,095
May be.

1294
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,392
What can we do when there is a report

1295
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:08,094
that he is a threat to his son.

1296
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,187
Supervisor!

1297
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,493
Did you come back so quickly after parole?

1298
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,602
What a show off you did!

1299
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:18,931
Dance and songs, isn't it dude?

1300
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:21,067
Did you bring any beedi?

1301
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,508
Please share one with me if you have.

1302
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:28,712
Why are you looking at?

1303
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,326
Sir!

1304
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,294
Have you send request to camp?

1305
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,130
Yes Sir!

1306
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,889
Please do the formalities immediately.

1307
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,793
- Don't make it late.
- Ok Sir!

1308
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:55,828
Alex!

1309
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:56,731
Sir, why did you call me?

1310
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:57,996
Who is this Abdu?

1311
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,639
He is a friend in my village

1312
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,267
He has sent a message here.

1313
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:04,902
l enquired about it,

1314
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:07,010
And confirmed it a while ago.

1315
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,616
Don't worry.

1316
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:14,287
Your sister Katrina passed away this morning.

1317
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:22,689
Abdu said the burial
will be happening today itself.

1318
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:32,669
Please write an application for escort parole,

1319
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:35,665
Then you go and see your sister.

1320
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:42,178
Hello, yes, sir,

1321
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:45,277
Ok,

1322
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:52,190
I don't think we can get anyone
from cam p tomorrow for escort duty.

1323
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:55,695
It is because of the President's visit.

1324
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:02,365
Alex! Then we cannot do anything

1325
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:04,136
but cancel the escort parole.

1326
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:08,038
Then, I can't see my Katrina, isn't it, Sir?

1327
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:12,910
You can't take me near her, can you?

1328
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:19,876
lam not even allowed to
put a handful of sand on her coffin.

1329
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:13,435
(Prayer in Arabic)

1330
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:34,998
- How are you?
- I am good.

1331
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:39,239
- What's up?
- Fine Sir.

1332
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:42,639
Are you still carrying on with your old things?

1333
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:44,575
Who are you? I didn't recognise you?

1334
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:48,149
Doctor, please reduce his medicine dose.

1335
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,260
Tell me,Alex.

1336
01:38:58,132 --> 01:38:59,963
Sir, my sister.

1337
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,064
I heard about it.

1338
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:04,398
The prisoners' worries are ours also to some
extent.

1339
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:08,165
Wearing this uniform, I too am not able to do
anything beyond a limit

1340
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,639
I want to help you, Alex.

1341
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:11,677
Sir,

1342
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,512
Can we putAlex name
once again in parole board?

1343
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:16,205
Let us see
if it is passed by the Advisory board.

1344
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,009
Ok, let us see.

1345
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:20,413
Will it work? Last time it didn't work.

1346
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:22,383
It will, be positive

1347
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:25,688
Request once again for the police report!

1348
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,528
Get one more application from Alex.

1349
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:29,388
Ok Sir,

1350
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,390
Everything will be fine.

1351
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,508
Report has come

1352
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,307
Oh, Alex's police report is favourable.

1353
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:54,214
Supervisor, don't have to say good bye today.
You can leave.

1354
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:57,354
Four people to court, five to Medical college,
and me too

1355
01:39:57,558 --> 01:39:59,423
- Please reduce 10 people from your count.
- Ok.

1356
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,355
Tomorrow there is case for Aani and lsalman,
Please don't forget about it.

1357
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:03,029
I will take of that.

1358
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:04,355
Ok then

1359
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:11,695
Sir!

1360
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,232
Sign over here, Alex

1361
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:19,773
Isn't there any music or dance this time?

1362
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:20,773
No Sir.

1363
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:29,786
Don't forget about the date
you need to come back.

1364
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:33,021
10th of next month, before 5pm

1365
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,758
Also, be careful
not to get involved in any case.

1366
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:37,361
I will take leave.

1367
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:29,179
Sir, lam Alex. I came out ofjail on parole.

1368
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:30,075
I came here to sign.

1369
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:32,615
That old valley case!

1370
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,287
Go inside and see Sl sir.

1371
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:35,352
You can sign after that

1372
01:41:37,157 --> 01:41:41,184
Ok, I will call

1373
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:43,292
Alex.

1374
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:47,259
Good behaviour in jail,
should be seen here as well.

1375
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:50,364
- Its only for 15 days you know?
- I know Sir.

1376
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:53,699
Don't create any issue,
with any person related to your case.

1377
01:41:55,909 --> 01:41:56,876
Then you can sign and leave.

1378
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:18,527
Alex.

1379
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:28,374
Why didn't you let me know
that you are coming?

1380
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:29,667
Isn't this better?

1381
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:33,680
Haseena, see who's here?

1382
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,348
-Come.
- I am coming.

1383
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:36,378
Come inside.

1384
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,212
Did you recognise him?

1385
01:42:42,589 --> 01:42:43,351
No

1386
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:45,385
He is our Alex

1387
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,349
He always talks about you.

1388
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,722
Come and sit, sit

1389
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:52,227
Sit here.

1390
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,734
You both talk, I will make some tea.

1391
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:00,703
She is a distant relative of mine.

1392
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,775
My relatives fixed the marriage
and thus it happened.

1393
01:43:07,581 --> 01:43:08,275
Dear, come here.

1394
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:12,641
Do you know her?

1395
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:17,287
Of course. She looks just like Katrina.

1396
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:18,219
What class are you studying?

1397
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:19,255
Grade11

1398
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:23,827
After Katrina died,
Varghese has become an alcoholic.

1399
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:26,362
He is brewing at home itself.

1400
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:29,559
Policemen come there often.

1401
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:31,433
As agirl,

1402
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:34,237
I thought it was not proper
for her to stay there.

1403
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:35,806
I brought her here.

1404
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:39,270
Katrina might have died
worrying about his deeds.

1405
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:41,214
Does he come here?

1406
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:43,280
He visits sometimes, to see her.

1407
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:44,245
Tea

1408
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:50,785
Dear, come

1409
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:06,800
This is all her works.

1410
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,701
We celebrate Christmas for her.

1411
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:15,341
Oh, the comrades are here.

1412
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:20,578
Comrade, just came to know at the junction.

1413
01:44:20,821 --> 01:44:22,652
Then, we closed the shop and came.

1414
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,422
After my legs got injured,

1415
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:26,354
they handle the business.

1416
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,527
How is your leg now?

1417
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,423
It hurts badly when I walk

1418
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,430
Then, I will take leave.

1419
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:32,530
I need to take bath.

1420
01:44:32,733 --> 01:44:33,700
Then need to go and see my son.

1421
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:34,992
l have only 15 days in hand.

1422
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:37,893
Where are you going? Stay here.

1423
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:40,670
In that case, shall we have a Party.

1424
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:43,703
These guys are just waiting
for a chance to drink.

1425
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,002
Then we will have brandy.

1426
01:44:58,558 --> 01:45:04,554
Its been 8 years since I saw
the sky and stars without a barrier.

1427
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:06,056
Not even in my dreams

1428
01:45:06,433 --> 01:45:07,832
that l everthought about seeing
you guys again.

1429
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:08,693
Forget about that, comrade.

1430
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:10,426
Here, take it.

1431
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,570
No dude, I got to see my son.

1432
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:14,604
lfl go there drunk,

1433
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:18,504
he will ask whether
he brought me outside for this?

1434
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:20,007
Why don't you tell him that,

1435
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:21,312
it's because of the happiness
about seeing him?

1436
01:45:21,515 --> 01:45:23,415
- Drink! Here!
- No No

1437
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:24,584
Drink!

1438
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:27,545
No no.

1439
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:29,688
Didn't you hear Abdukka saying not to drink?

1440
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,551
If they will throw you out ofjail for drinking,
let them.

1441
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:33,453
Okthen, bring it here

1442
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:36,557
May 
 drink?

1443
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:58,773
I want to see my son.

1444
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:00,418
- Now?
- Yes, now.

1445
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:02,752
He must be waiting for me.

1446
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:06,083
Hey Alex, don't go to see him drunk.

1447
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:08,392
I shall tell him about it.

1448
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:11,731
That his dad got drunk
feeling happy about seeing him.

1449
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,092
He will bear it.

1450
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:14,092
If any of you want tojoin me,
then come

1451
01:46:14,468 --> 01:46:15,594
Or I will go alone.

1452
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,118
There are so many people over there.

1453
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:45,124
-Alex! Dude! Alex!
- What?

1454
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:48,566
Its very noisy there. Don't go now.

1455
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:49,732
What if I go?

1456
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,705
Don't fightwith him now.

1457
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,541
Come! Let's go.

1458
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:16,390
Get into the car. Come! Let's go.

1459
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:30,200
It seems Alex has come!

1460
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:31,566
- Where?
- Over there.

1461
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,137
Please hold the child

1462
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:35,748
What's it, dear?

1463
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:40,545
- Come
- Where?

1464
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:41,448
Over there.

1465
01:47:42,589 --> 01:47:43,715
- Did you see?
- Yes.

1466
01:47:52,599 --> 01:47:54,624
- No one's here
- 
 just saw him here.

1467
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:55,857
Is it true?

1468
01:47:56,169 --> 01:47:56,863
Is he alone?

1469
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:58,162
They are all with him.

1470
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:03,235
- Maybe you just felt like that.
- Not that.

1471
01:48:27,767 --> 01:48:30,565
Won't let this red flag down,

1472
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:32,601
Till we die

1473
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:37,567
Won't let this red flag down,

1474
01:48:38,879 --> 01:48:40,813
Till we die

1475
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:44,177
Won't let this red flag down

1476
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:54,283
My father Pullankunnel Philipose
shouted this slogan

1477
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:57,263
l have repeated it so many times.

1478
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:01,763
Won't let this red flag down,

1479
01:49:02,636 --> 01:49:03,933
Till we die

1480
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:06,070
Won't let this red flag down

1481
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:11,641
My father left, my Katrina left

1482
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:13,305
My Annie left,

1483
01:49:14,614 --> 01:49:17,310
The institution close to my
heart disowned me,

1484
01:49:20,086 --> 01:49:22,987
Com rade Alex had turned into PrisonerAlex.

1485
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:27,287
But, even then, I will shout,

1486
01:49:28,795 --> 01:49:31,593
Long live revolution

1487
01:49:31,798 --> 01:49:32,196

Long live revolution

1492
01:50:01,861 --> 01:50:02,725
Kill him!

1493
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,135
lfl draw a line, you will be finished.

1494

Have come to take revenge
after waiting for 5-8 years!

1495
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:13,767
Get lost!

1496
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:19,907
l have come on parole for 15 days,
to see my son.

1497
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,238
If you stand on my way,

1498
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:25,011
I will forget
that you are Annie's brothers.

1499
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:30,349
Here they have come with a knife,
to shave.

1500
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:38,360
lshould have bundled you up
in a corner and kick.

1501
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:42,133
Just because the jailor said that
you were well behaved in jail,

1502
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:43,165
lam letting you to go.

1503
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:47,873
lfyou do something again
till your parole period is finished,

1504
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:48,870
Sir, its not me.

1505
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,768
They hit me at the cemetery..

1506
01:50:49,943 --> 01:50:50,409
Stop it

1507
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:52,401
Don't takethe pain of explaining more.

1508
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:56,237
Once again if I get to see you here...

1509
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:57,239
Get lost!

1510
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:04,150
Did you really have to do that?

1511
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:06,189
I told you then itself.

1512
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:09,420
They are all finding ways to trap you.

1513
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:13,730
To whom are you showing your discomfiture?

1514
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:17,165
Its been 8 years since I met my son.

1515
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:18,899
He got me out on parole.

1516
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:20,365
It's already 2 days I am here

1517
01:51:21,074 --> 01:51:23,269
When I ask you about my son,
you guys arejust fooling me.

1518
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,744
Why are you hiding from me?

1519
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,674
I know what to do.

1520
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:31,316
Alex, stop there.

1521
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:33,741
You please listen to me.

1522
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:38,415
Where is the Principal's room?

1523
01:51:38,792 --> 01:51:39,781
It's over there.

1524
01:51:45,965 --> 01:51:46,454
Come in!

1525
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,758
- What is it?
- I want to meet my son.

1526
01:51:48,968 --> 01:51:49,764
What is his name?

1527
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:51,664
Shine Philipose.

1528
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:53,930
Oh! Shine Philipose!

1529
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:57,904
I came to know about his studies.

1530
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:00,442
He is not here now,
has gone for a football tournament.

1531
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:02,448
Will be back only after 2 days.

1532
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:03,777
Ok

1533
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:05,084

Come! What happened? Did you see him?

1536
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,479
No

1537
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:47,992
Come, let's eat!

1538
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:53,856
lfeel sad when 
 see you like this.

1539
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:57,794
The teacher said that he has gone
for a football tournament.

1540
01:52:58,338 --> 01:52:59,464
Anyway, I am going there.

1541
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:02,808
- Don't go alone. Take them with you.
- Ok

1542
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:13,182
Dude Pass!

1543
01:53:14,587 --> 01:53:17,886
Sir, can I see the children
from Mary Matha school?

1544
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:19,455
They have gone to hostel after the match.

1545
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:21,191
They will stay in hostel
till the tournament is over.

1546
01:53:21,394 --> 01:53:22,326
Where is the hostel?

1547
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:24,292
It's about 5km from here.

1548
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,032
Ready boys!

1549
01:53:31,037 --> 01:53:34,200
Brother, they have gone out.

1550
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:35,203
Do you know when they will be back?

1551
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:36,534
Don't know that.

1552
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:37,467
Let's go.

1553
01:53:51,925 --> 01:53:55,190
Brother! Brother!

1554
01:53:55,929 --> 01:53:57,226
Is there any bus to the valley?

1555
01:54:00,099 --> 01:54:02,465
Yes, the last bus is yet to come.
Will it stop here?

1556
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,464
Not here. Go around the corner
and wait there.

1557
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:56,121
Is he lying here?

1558
01:54:57,523 --> 01:54:58,285
Alex!

1559
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:00,889
Alex!

1560
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:02,287
Alex!

1561
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:03,928
When did you come?

1562
01:55:04,197 --> 01:55:05,391
Why didn't you call?

1563
01:55:05,632 --> 01:55:06,894
Are you sleeping on floor?

1564
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:10,501
-Lying on the floor! lam used to it now.
- Come in!

1565
01:55:10,703 --> 01:55:11,931
It was really late when I came.

1566
01:55:12,205 --> 01:55:13,934
Thought of not disturbing you,
so slept here

1567
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:16,300
Come inside, it is very cold here.

1568
01:55:19,178 --> 01:55:24,878
Dear, tell mother to make tea for us.

1569
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:26,175
lwill.

1570
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:31,123

01:55:31,357 --> 01:55:33,917
It happened last night at Kottamam junction.

1572
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,525
The robber has not been identified yet.

1573
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:37,328
Here it is very common now.

1574
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:40,658
The police men are checking the
CCTV visuals with the help of cyber police.

1575
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:44,333
The security who has been attacked,
is in a critical condition.

1576
01:55:44,537 --> 01:55:47,995
The district police head said that
the culpritwill be identified soon.

1577
01:55:56,015 --> 01:55:58,381
What's up? Why are you not saying anything?

1578
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:00,914
Don't try to play your old tricks again.

1579
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:01,643
Have to get the money.

1580
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:04,319
Whichever way possible. You understand?

1581
01:56:06,759 --> 01:56:07,657
Whom do you want to see?

1582
01:56:08,227 --> 01:56:09,194
To see my son.

1583
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:12,494
Hey Stop there..Hey.

1584
01:56:14,734 --> 01:56:15,496
Move

1585
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:19,127
Stop there, I said, Stop..

1586
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:25,337
Stop there..stop..

1587
01:56:27,714 --> 01:56:30,376
Hey..Hey..Stop there..

1588
01:56:32,685 --> 01:56:37,315
Hey..Hey..Stop there..

1589
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:49,261
How fast is the kid running?

1590
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:52,637
He escaped this time as well.

1591
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:53,563
What is this Sir? What happened?

1592
01:56:53,773 --> 01:56:54,740
He is a student ofthis school.

1593
01:56:55,108 --> 01:56:56,575
Selling cannabis is his main job.

1594
01:56:56,776 --> 01:56:57,572
Very difficult to catch..

1595
01:56:57,777 --> 01:56:59,745
Otherwise we would have handed
him overto police long time back.

1596
01:57:00,113 --> 01:57:00,738
What to do?

1597
01:57:01,114 --> 01:57:02,411
His father wenttojail killing his mother.

1598
01:57:02,615 --> 01:57:05,175
Hmm..Children get spoiled even
when parents take care of them well.

1599
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:07,250
Then how can an orphan?

1600
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:50,127
How was your trip? Did you see him?

1601
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:53,529
Was it him?

1602
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:55,792
Let's not think about it anymore.

1603
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:58,803
That's why I asked you not
to go there to meet him.

1604
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:00,764
Will this parole go waste?

1605
01:58:05,445 --> 01:58:06,844
Abdukka, turn on the TV please.

1606
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:09,111
You turn on the TV.

1607
01:58:23,796 --> 01:58:26,230
Attack on ATM. CCTV visuals are out.

1608
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:28,832
Security guard who was attacked has died.

1609
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:32,203
Visuals of the accused are now available.

1610
01:58:32,572 --> 01:58:35,564
Police has said that the accused
is a convict who is in parole.

1611
01:58:35,808 --> 01:58:39,676
DGP said a new investigation team has been
set up to further investigate this case.

1612
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:41,680
What am I seeing?

1613
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:47,519
Whose is this?

1614
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:48,414
This..

1615
01:58:55,728 --> 01:58:56,695
Take care ofthe mobile phone.

1616
01:58:56,896 --> 01:58:58,261
I will tell you more once I get back.

1617
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:03,698
Are you out in parole to kill and loot?
Isn't it? Come.

1618
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:05,536
I had already warned you.

1619
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:08,298
You should not have appeared in front of me.

1620
01:59:08,508 --> 01:59:09,270
Get in.

1621
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:14,677
Abdukka.

1622
01:59:15,715 --> 01:59:16,545
- Sir..
- What happened?

1623
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:18,512
He is in custody. lwill take him there soon.

1624
01:59:18,718 --> 01:59:19,742
Hmm..OK.

1625
01:59:22,755 --> 01:59:26,521
What is happening? I can't understand
anything, my god.

1626
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:44,269
- Is he inside?
- Yes.

1627
01:59:46,245 --> 01:59:47,269
Put your hands down.

1628
01:59:50,383 --> 01:59:53,250
Alex, CCTV visuals are against you.

1629
01:59:54,287 --> 01:59:55,379
Do you have anything to say?

1630
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:56,417
I didn't do it.

1631
01:59:56,756 --> 01:59:57,518
Then who?

1632
01:59:57,723 --> 01:59:58,587
Two guys on bike.

1633
01:59:58,791 --> 01:59:59,883
How do you know that?

1634
02:00:00,293 --> 02:00:01,157
I saw it.

1635
02:00:01,394 --> 02:00:02,258
What did you see?

1636
02:00:02,461 --> 02:00:04,520
Two guys on bike attacking the security guard.

1637
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,534
Can you recognise that bike or those two
guys?

1638
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:13,701
What man? Are you about to lie?

1639
02:00:13,906 --> 02:00:15,271
- No, sir.
- Then what?

1640
02:00:15,741 --> 02:00:18,437
You said you saw their faces
when helmet was removed.

1641
02:00:18,878 --> 02:00:20,573
Yes,just got aglimpse.

1642
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:22,838
Just a glimpse? Can you recognise them?

1643
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:25,517
You should recognise them.

1644
02:00:27,587 --> 02:00:29,578
Call the witness.

1645
02:00:29,822 --> 02:00:31,221
Get inside

1646
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:39,794
Did you take the injured security guard
to the hospital,

1647
02:00:39,999 --> 02:00:41,432
who was attacked by this man?

1648
02:00:41,634 --> 02:00:44,262
Yes, we took him to the hospital. But..

1649
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:44,959
Yes, speak up.

1650
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:46,797
We didn't see him attacking.

1651
02:00:47,006 --> 02:00:48,268
But he was there.

1652
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:51,669
Hmm. Do you know him from before?

1653
02:00:51,877 --> 02:00:53,276
No sir, seeing forthe first time.

1654
02:00:53,813 --> 02:00:55,007
Why did you come that way?

1655
02:00:55,381 --> 02:00:56,678
If we go that way,

1656
02:00:56,882 --> 02:00:58,611
we can reach temple two and a half hours
earlier.

1657
02:00:58,818 --> 02:00:59,716
That's why.

1658
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:03,448
OK. You can go now.
We will call you if needed.

1659
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:04,849
- Yes, sir.
- Ok. Go now.

1660
02:01:05,491 --> 02:01:06,355
God save us.

1661
02:01:07,627 --> 02:01:10,653
Alex, because you are a convict out in parole,

1662
02:01:10,863 --> 02:01:13,832
We had doubt seeing you in CCTV visuals.

1663
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,599
We couldn't take the death statement
of the security guard.

1664
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:19,805
Visuals of a motor bike passing
through there has been received.

1665
02:01:20,006 --> 02:01:22,804
Same bike has also been found in
CCTV visuals of nearby petrol pump.

1666
02:01:23,509 --> 02:01:27,001
If we can find who there are,
you can be safe for the time being.

1667
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:29,981
OK. You can go now.
We will call you if needed.

1668
02:01:50,503 --> 02:01:54,701
Alex, after you were taken away by police,

1669
02:01:54,907 --> 02:01:56,966
so many calls came in to this phone.

1670
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,068
I didn't pick up.

1671
02:02:01,447 --> 02:02:05,543
But, I want to know some otherthing now.

1672
02:02:09,121 --> 02:02:11,316
You didn't say anything about it.

1673
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:15,059
Hit him!

1674
02:02:16,429 --> 02:02:19,023
Save me.

1675
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:25,561
Break his head.

1676
02:02:26,505 --> 02:02:29,099
Leave him..

1677
02:02:34,747 --> 02:02:35,441
Who are you?

1678
02:02:36,749 --> 02:02:42,119
Let's go..Get in to the vehicle.

1679
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,425
Get up. Get up.

1680
02:02:47,059 --> 02:02:49,584
Stop the vehicle, stop please.

1681
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:52,494
Someone attacked him, take him to
the hospital please.

1682
02:02:52,732 --> 02:02:54,097
What happened?

1683
02:02:54,467 --> 02:02:57,834
Someone hit him. Please help.

1684
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:01,732
My ribs are broken

1685
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:02,703
Oh my God!

1686
02:03:02,908 --> 02:03:04,967
Don't worry. They are pilgrims.
They will take you.

1687
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:06,076
Start the Car

1688
02:03:06,445 --> 02:03:07,742
Oh god!

1689
02:03:24,897 --> 02:03:27,024
Out of thetwo people on bike,

1690
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:31,035
one was Shine, my son.

1691
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:38,701
My god! What are you saying?

1692
02:03:42,748 --> 02:03:44,409

 always get calls from this number.

1693
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,413
Why are you not picking the call?

1694
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:53,680
lam tired of calling.

1695
02:03:54,059 --> 02:03:55,617
I did all this believing you.

1696
02:03:56,028 --> 02:03:57,723
After doing everything,
now you are not taking my call.

1697
02:03:58,197 --> 02:03:59,129
You saw the news, rig ht?

1698
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:01,131
lam very much tensed.

1699
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,828
lam going to tell everything to Dad.

1700
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:04,695
You just see, you will be trapped.

1701
02:04:08,073 --> 02:04:09,973
Our last hope is this mobile phone.

1702
02:04:10,443 --> 02:04:11,808
Anyways, it is in our hand now.

1703
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:15,171
The police will find the bike
tracing the CCTV visuals.

1704
02:04:15,781 --> 02:04:18,181
Before that we have to identify the caller.

1705
02:04:19,185 --> 02:04:20,880
Or my son will be jailed for murder.

1706
02:04:21,153 --> 02:04:23,553
My God. That should not happen.

1707
02:04:23,756 --> 02:04:25,155
Somehow, we need to save him.

1708
02:04:26,025 --> 02:04:30,121
Maybe it's her decision, Annie's.

1709
02:04:30,529 --> 02:04:34,021
Otherwise, how could this mobile phone
reach your hands?

1710
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:37,758
l have only 10 more days left.

1711
02:04:38,871 --> 02:04:41,066
I need to find my son within that time.

1712
02:05:10,636 --> 02:05:12,001
What is it, Varghese?

1713
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:13,836
I came to pick my daughter.

1714
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:17,231
I can't let her live
in this house with prisoners.

1715
02:05:18,043 --> 02:05:19,533
Here also there is a well.

1716
02:05:19,778 --> 02:05:21,905
Wells are his weakness.

1717
02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:24,281
She is the only one left for me now.

1718
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:26,676
Varghese, if you came to meet
your daughter, meet her and leave!

1719
02:05:26,886 --> 02:05:27,716
Dead

1720
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:30,247
Pappa!

1721
02:05:31,524 --> 02:05:33,617
Dear, did you hear about your uncle's news?

1722
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:37,128
He killed that security guard
soon after getting out ofjail.

1723
02:05:37,329 --> 02:05:38,591
He will go back soon.

1724
02:05:38,898 --> 02:05:40,160
It is not safe to stay here now.

1725
02:05:40,533 --> 02:05:41,500
You start quickly. Let's go.

1726
02:05:41,667 --> 02:05:43,066
Uncle will not kill anyone.

1727
02:05:44,537 --> 02:05:47,062
The Police have got all the evidences.

1728
02:05:47,573 --> 02:05:51,134
They will charge him with
all those, you know?

1729
02:05:51,544 --> 02:05:55,173
I don't know who are going
to be hit by him.

1730
02:05:55,681 --> 02:05:58,514
Anyways, you start quickly, let us go.

1731
02:05:58,717 --> 02:05:59,775
lam not coming anywhere.

1732
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:01,109
Aren't you hungry?

1733
02:06:01,654 --> 02:06:02,746
If you want something,
come inside and wait.

1734
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:04,011
I will cook something for you.

1735
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:14,995
Then fry to eggs for me.

1736
02:06:15,668 --> 02:06:17,033
Or bullseye is also fine.

1737
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:21,738
The people and politicians of Kottamam
are all agitated now.

1738
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:24,942
The Police is after the bike in the CCTV.

1739
02:06:33,986 --> 02:06:35,010
Note this number.

1740
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:36,313
Ok

1741
02:06:40,192 --> 02:06:43,992
Hello, Hello, why didn't you call me back?

1742
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:46,257
Why are you not saying anything?

1743
02:06:46,799 --> 02:06:48,596
I will give you time till tomorrow evening.

1744
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:52,136
This might be the guy with Shine
on the bike.

1745
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:53,360
In that case, we need to find him.

1746
02:06:53,739 --> 02:06:56,333
Another guy is also calling in between,
we need to find him also.

1747
02:06:57,743 --> 02:06:59,802
Is there any Mosque nearby?

1748
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:03,009
There is one nearby, about 2km farfrom here.

1749
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,612

 used to go there before.

1750
02:07:05,818 --> 02:07:08,309
After my legs got hurt,
ljust pray at home only.

1751
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:12,347
There is another mosque at Chittatumukku,
about 5-6km far.

1752
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:13,316
What's the matter?

1753
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:17,185
While he was talking,
I heard the prayerfrom a mosque.

1754
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:20,324
I think he is somewhere near one of those
mosques.

1755
02:07:20,833 --> 02:07:22,323
We need to find him before tomorrow evening,

1756
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:23,362
or we will be in trouble.

1757
02:07:23,836 --> 02:07:25,030
Till he picks up the call,

1758
02:07:25,237 --> 02:07:26,864
we need to call on that number
from a public booth.

1759
02:07:27,106 --> 02:07:28,073
Rest, I will take care.

1760
02:07:32,378 --> 02:07:33,777
See you dear, I will come tomorrow.

1761
02:07:35,214 --> 02:07:35,908
Stop there!

1762
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:53,631
You couldn't be a good husband
and there is no time for that.

1763
02:07:54,767 --> 02:07:56,325
But you can be a good father.

1764
02:07:56,702 --> 02:08:00,263
If you take good care of her,
she will be of use when you get old.

1765
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:02,734
Don't spoil yourself drinking.

1766
02:08:03,108 --> 02:08:05,269
You don't have to be good
just because I told you to.

1767
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:07,104
I will go back after 10-15 days.

1768
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:09,877
If you do, your sins will be forgiven.

1769
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:12,146
Please..

1770
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:16,882
Come.

1771
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:52,716
What's up?

1772
02:08:52,925 --> 02:08:55,052
There isn't any of his schoolmates living
nearby.

1773
02:08:55,527 --> 02:08:57,222
Let's check at Chittatupallimukku.

1774
02:08:57,429 --> 02:08:58,293
Get into the vehicle.

1775
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:07,169
When I saw yourface in the news,
I understood everything.

1776
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:08,805
You should be working hard to save the boy.

1777
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:11,440
But the time is very less now.

1778
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:15,769
Yes, but I have decided to save my son.

1779
02:09:16,048 --> 02:09:17,140
l have to do that somehow.

1780
02:09:21,019 --> 02:09:21,849
Abdukka,

1781
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:24,382
Ok, alrig ht.

1782
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:25,749
It is Abdukka,

1783
02:09:26,024 --> 02:09:27,355
Police had come for enquiry.

1784
02:09:27,526 --> 02:09:30,290
You need to go to the police club
for identification parade.

1785
02:09:42,241 --> 02:09:43,037
Ok, call him.

1786
02:09:43,408 --> 02:09:44,204
Alex!

1787
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:55,183
Come! See if the person riding
the bike is there among these?

1788
02:09:57,222 --> 02:09:59,383
One criminal may have like
towards another criminal.

1789
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:00,785
Don't do that here.

1790
02:10:01,059 --> 02:10:02,151
Go and look carefully.

1791
02:10:27,519 --> 02:10:28,178
Who out ofthese?

1792
02:10:30,022 --> 02:10:32,217
- None of these Sir.
- Did you see carefully?

1793
02:10:32,424 --> 02:10:33,186
Yes Sir.

1794
02:10:34,526 --> 02:10:35,891
Ok, you may go.

1795
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:42,057
Alex, you stop there.

1796
02:10:45,537 --> 02:10:47,402
Do you know this guy?

1797
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:51,207
Do you know this guy?

1798
02:10:59,518 --> 02:11:00,883
Do you know him?

1799
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:01,915
Tell me!

1800
02:11:05,958 --> 02:11:07,186
Don't you know him?

1801
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:09,351
Sir, he is my son.

1802
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:33,142
Your act, pretending like
you don't know your own son, is great.

1803
02:11:33,452 --> 02:11:34,248
You are smart.

1804
02:11:39,391 --> 02:11:44,090
Alex, the bike in the CCTV and the
one on which he came, are similar.

1805
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:52,434
You are the only witness of guard's attack.

1806
02:11:53,272 --> 02:11:54,204
What do you say?

1807
02:11:56,041 --> 02:11:57,201
According to your statement,

1808
02:11:57,409 --> 02:12:00,640
the guard had clutched on to
one person's neck during the attack.

1809
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:02,309
Yes Sir.

1810
02:12:02,447 --> 02:12:05,075
Did he clutch with left or right hand?

1811
02:12:06,551 --> 02:12:07,518
I don't remember exactly.

1812
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,047
I understand that you are lying now.

1813
02:12:10,255 --> 02:12:11,483
But it's of no use.

1814
02:12:12,457 --> 02:12:16,052
Look, he has got a nail scratch
scar on his neck.

1815
02:12:20,532 --> 02:12:24,127
If your statement and this is related,

1816
02:12:24,937 --> 02:12:27,929
then it will be a god's signature
against the accused.

1817
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:31,403
Tomorrow, we will receive the forensic report.

1818
02:12:32,344 --> 02:12:36,246
lfthe tissues under his nails belong to him,

1819
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:38,641
then you have lot to worry.

1820
02:12:40,552 --> 02:12:43,350
It is my duty to investigate this case.

1821
02:12:44,222 --> 02:12:45,086
You can go now.

1822
02:13:02,574 --> 02:13:03,404
What happened?

1823
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:06,234
I saw my son.

1824
02:13:11,416 --> 02:13:14,681
Did you hide him
from me all this time, forthis?

1825
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:18,582
Did I wait all this time
to see him like this?

1826
02:13:19,558 --> 02:13:21,082
You could have told me.

1827
02:13:30,268 --> 02:13:31,098
Alex.

1828
02:13:44,549 --> 02:13:46,744
What are you thinking about, Alex?

1829
02:13:50,355 --> 02:13:52,414
lam losing control of my mind.

1830
02:13:53,592 --> 02:13:55,423
Thinking about my son...

1831
02:13:56,261 --> 02:13:58,092
Nothing will happen to him.

1832
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:00,530
I shouldn't have come out ofjail.

1833
02:14:01,566 --> 02:14:03,591
It's even worse outside than inside the jail.

1834
02:14:04,703 --> 02:14:06,034
Here is the money.

1835
02:14:11,643 --> 02:14:12,610
What happened?

1836
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:16,440
lgotthis phone unlocked in afriend's shop.

1837
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:18,081
These are the numbers I got from it.

1838
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:20,079
Calls are coming continuously from two
numbers.

1839
02:14:20,285 --> 02:14:24,415
Yes, this guy called many times
on the day of incident and next day.

1840
02:14:24,589 --> 02:14:26,216
About 12 times.

1841
02:14:26,558 --> 02:14:27,252
Did you find his house?

1842
02:14:27,459 --> 02:14:29,393
We enquired near Chittattumuku mosque area.

1843
02:14:29,828 --> 02:14:31,625
There are two children who
study in Shine's school.

1844
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:33,127
Out ofthem, one is a girl.

1845
02:14:33,498 --> 02:14:34,260
And the other?

1846
02:14:35,167 --> 02:14:37,260
That was a police man's house.
So, we came back.

1847
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:39,300
Why should we get into trouble unnecessarily?

1848
02:14:41,139 --> 02:14:42,128
His name is Benoy.

1849
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:45,673
This Benoy and my friend's son usually
come to the ground to play football.

1850
02:15:09,134 --> 02:15:10,465
- Sir!
- What?

1851
02:15:10,669 --> 02:15:11,658
Did you come to influence me?

1852
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:13,495
No, I came to see you.

1853
02:15:21,313 --> 02:15:24,214
You told me about the God's
signature against the culprit,

1854
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,111
That's what you are listening to now.

1855
02:15:27,385 --> 02:15:33,449
Here is the list ofthe calls that came
from morning on the day of incident

1856
02:15:33,658 --> 02:15:37,219
till one hour before the incident,
To the mobile which fell off culprit's pocket.

1857
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:42,123
Next day also, calls have come after
knowing about the guard's death news.

1858
02:15:45,737 --> 02:15:47,398
Shall I tell you one more thing?

1859
02:15:47,706 --> 02:15:54,111
As you said, ifthe tissue
under guard's nail belong to my son,

1860
02:15:54,312 --> 02:15:55,540
then this guy will also become accused.

1861
02:15:59,818 --> 02:16:02,446
the guard died as he hit his head on the wall

1862
02:16:02,654 --> 02:16:04,884
lam the only witness for all these.

1863
02:16:05,924 --> 02:16:08,392
Hope you understood now
who shall also be accused with him.

1864
02:16:08,593 --> 02:16:11,118
Who are you to teach police about
investigation?

1865
02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:13,263
lam not teaching you about investigation.

1866
02:16:13,465 --> 02:16:14,932
I need to save my son.

1867
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,165
That too within limited time.

1868
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:20,400
Being the investigation officer,
only you can do something.

1869
02:16:20,572 --> 02:16:23,700
Don't considerthese as words of a prisoner,
but a request from a father.

1870
02:16:24,442 --> 02:16:27,206
If you investigate in the right way,
both our children will be trapped.

1871
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:29,404
Don't send them to jail.

1872
02:16:29,581 --> 02:16:32,448
lam saying this as I know about
all the difficulties in jail.

1873
02:16:33,185 --> 02:16:34,447
You please think about it and take a decision.

1874
02:16:48,633 --> 02:16:54,572
Alex, there is one more secret
that I hid from you till now.

1875
02:16:56,308 --> 02:17:00,267
It is true that Shine signed
the paper for your parole.

1876
02:17:00,912 --> 02:17:04,780
But he demanded Rs.25000 to me for that.

1877
02:17:05,984 --> 02:17:07,713
l arranged that money

1878
02:17:08,987 --> 02:17:11,615
He gave that money to Sudarsan,

1879
02:17:11,823 --> 02:17:14,621
To buy cannabis and cannabis oil.

1880
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:18,725
Now he is in such a situation
that he will do anything for money.

1881
02:17:19,397 --> 02:17:22,457
Knowing thatthere is no use in advising him,

1882
02:17:22,734 --> 02:17:27,728
I tried to get Sudarsan caught by police.

1883
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:39,309
This is the gift he gave me forthat.

1884
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:44,816
Do you know that Shine Philipose?

1885
02:17:45,457 --> 02:17:46,788
Tell me what all things you have done.

1886
02:17:47,025 --> 02:17:48,959
Shine Philip is my friend.

1887
02:17:56,701 --> 02:17:58,669
Dad, I don't know what to do.

1888
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:23,392
Sir, why are you here?

1889
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:24,721
I came to see Alex.

1890
02:18:25,063 --> 02:18:25,791
What is the matter?

1891
02:18:25,997 --> 02:18:27,794
You have to present your son,

1892
02:18:28,066 --> 02:18:29,556
We need to get some details from him.

1893
02:18:29,768 --> 02:18:31,531
But he is in your custody, isn't he?

1894
02:18:32,037 --> 02:18:34,562
No, I sent him with your advocate.

1895
02:18:34,773 --> 02:18:36,400
I didn't send any advocate.

1896
02:18:36,574 --> 02:18:37,700
Then, where is he?

1897
02:18:41,446 --> 02:18:43,710
Sir, lwill find my son.

1898
02:18:44,616 --> 02:18:46,413
But you have to make a promise

1899
02:18:48,453 --> 02:18:52,014
That you will save him
along with your son.

1900
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:30,123
Where is my son?

1901
02:19:35,633 --> 02:19:36,930
He won't be coming now

1902
02:20:26,584 --> 02:20:28,484
l have only few more hours left
before I go back.

1903
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:31,614
So, I will repay all the debts.

1904
02:20:32,624 --> 02:20:40,656
Also, I shall repay for what you had done
to Abdukka, who is like a brotherto me.

1905
02:20:41,966 --> 02:20:43,490
I shall forgive you for what you did to me.

1906
02:20:44,536 --> 02:20:46,697
But if I forgive you
for what you did to my son,

1907
02:20:47,872 --> 02:20:49,464
My Annie will not forgive me.

1908
02:20:56,681 --> 02:20:59,741
Keep this, it will be useful to walk.

1909
02:21:11,863 --> 02:21:13,023
Take him to thejeep.

1910
02:21:19,804 --> 02:21:20,634
Get up

1911
02:21:23,508 --> 02:21:24,566
Take him to the jeep

1912
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:28,738
Alex!

02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:30,975
lgot the accused.

1915
02:21:36,621 --> 02:21:39,556
The accused has been arrested
with the help of CCTV visuals.

1916
02:21:39,757 --> 02:21:41,452
The investigation officer informed that the
accused will be presented in court tomorrow.

1917
02:21:41,626 --> 02:21:43,992
The officer told the media

1918
02:21:44,195 --> 02:21:48,131
that they will not disclose the details
of the accused forthe time being.

1919

Did the police hurt you physically
when you were taken to custody?

1923
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:12,750
No

1924
02:22:14,158 --> 02:22:15,591
Anything else to say?

1925
02:22:16,661 --> 02:22:17,753
l have not committed any crime.

1926
02:22:18,062 --> 02:22:19,029
lam innocent.

1927
02:22:22,534 --> 02:22:25,697
Your honour, the accused may be
remanded to thejudicial custody.

1928
02:22:29,741 --> 02:22:33,734
Abdukka, Dad didn't do that.

1929
02:22:34,879 --> 02:22:36,005
lam the one who did mistake.

1930
02:22:37,181 --> 02:22:38,739
Dad hasn't done any mistake.

1931
02:22:41,185 --> 02:22:45,622
Before also, he has gone to jail
without committing any crime.

1932
02:22:46,291 --> 02:22:49,055
- Your dad did not kill your Mom.
- Then?

1933
02:22:49,294 --> 02:22:51,285
She fell into the well,
with seizures of epilepsy.

1934
02:22:51,729 --> 02:22:53,788
He could not save her.

1935
02:22:54,999 --> 02:22:57,126
As Varghese gave a wrong statement,

1936
02:22:57,335 --> 02:22:58,734
That day your dad was declared guilty

1937
02:22:59,003 --> 02:23:02,302
Abdukka, somehow save my father ..

1938
02:23:04,709 --> 02:23:09,612
The accused is remanded to judicial custody
for 14 days.

1939
02:23:10,982 --> 02:23:13,678
The accused is remanded to judicial custody
for 14 days.

1940
02:23:28,099 --> 02:23:29,623
Sir, it was very dramatic that the accused...

1941
02:23:29,834 --> 02:23:30,630
Move them away..

1942
02:23:30,835 --> 02:23:32,962
Move! Move! What?

1943
02:23:45,083 --> 02:23:50,680
Sir, l have been jailed for 8 years
fora crime l have not done.

1944
02:23:51,089 --> 02:23:52,613
I am not worried about that.

1945
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:57,350
Because I hit my Annie once, whom
I had never hurt even in a small way.

1946
02:23:58,229 --> 02:24:00,720
When she died falling in the
well with epilepsy,

1947
02:24:01,065 --> 02:24:02,794
I couldn't save her.

1948
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:05,164
I didn't defend myself in the court.

1949
02:24:06,704 --> 02:24:10,162
But I always felt that I had committed
a very big mistake towards her.

1950
02:24:11,075 --> 02:24:13,168
I never wished for a life without her.

1951
02:24:13,645 --> 02:24:16,079
But when I think about my son,

1952
02:24:16,781 --> 02:24:19,045
l have a wish to come back to life.

1953
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:22,711
I want to save my son somehow.

1954
02:24:24,222 --> 02:24:27,658
Before I came out, without my knowledge,

1955
02:24:27,892 --> 02:24:30,053
he had been in a gang,
from where he can never be saved.

1956
02:24:30,895 --> 02:24:32,123
lwant to save him.

1957
02:24:32,897 --> 02:24:34,728
lwant to bring him back to life.

1958
02:24:35,466 --> 02:24:36,797
He is the only one left for me.

1959
02:24:38,436 --> 02:24:39,801
lfyou save him,

1960
02:24:40,071 --> 02:24:43,268
You have to, don't say you can't,

1961
02:24:44,308 --> 02:24:47,175
Or I will make your son criminal.

1962
02:24:48,413 --> 02:24:50,347
If you charge case against my son,

1963
02:24:50,682 --> 02:24:52,206
Your son will be joint-accused.

1964
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:54,149
If you want, you can

1965
02:24:55,053 --> 02:24:58,079
But I will not give witness against my son.

1966
02:24:58,423 --> 02:25:00,220
I haven't seen him, and I don't know him.

1967
02:25:01,492 --> 02:25:04,325
If you just want an accused, I will come.

1968
02:25:04,495 --> 02:25:05,393
I will become accused.

1969
02:25:06,064 --> 02:25:09,056
I will agree with the crime, in front of you.

1970
02:25:09,701 --> 02:25:12,261
But if my son understands me,

1971
02:25:12,437 --> 02:25:14,029
He will not give witness against me.

1972
02:25:15,006 --> 02:25:16,906
If you make my son accused,
I will also not give the witness statement.

1973
02:25:18,009 --> 02:25:19,408
I will confess the crime in the court.

1974
02:25:20,378 --> 02:25:22,869
But you need to take care ofthe rest.

1975
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:37,995
Alex, we have been late to know the truth.

1976
02:25:37,995 --> 02:25:39,155
Please forgive us.

1977
02:25:39,363 --> 02:25:41,854
We will take care of your son,
without getting into danger.

1978
02:25:54,545 --> 02:25:55,375
Uncle!

1979
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:03,084
Uncle!

1980
02:26:07,258 --> 02:26:08,088
Dad!

1981
02:26:11,262 --> 02:26:11,921
Dad!

1982
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:27,502
Dad! Please forgive me.

1983
02:27:17,028 --> 02:27:19,394
lam leaving, after returning

1984
02:27:19,564 --> 02:27:21,293
my son's life which
he was about to lose.

1985
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:23,400
Don't know for how long
I will have to wait,

1986
02:27:23,868 --> 02:27:25,358
but I am sure

1987
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:27,561
I will have my son waiting for me

1988
02:27:28,239 --> 02:27:29,831
and also, my Annie's memories.

1989
02:27:29,855 --> 02:27:48,855
