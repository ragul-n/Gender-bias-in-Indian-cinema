The stars and their orbits
are the studded pearls.

00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:06,195
The fragrance of sandalwood
in the air is the temple incense

12
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:19,810
..and the wind is the fan.

By making this universe, earth.

30

..and this world nature
has really blessed us

31
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,935
But we..

32
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,976
We are disrespecting it.

33
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,979
We are being proud of it.

34
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,981
We are insulting it.

35
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,986
Mind your step!
Keep distance.Keep distance!

36
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,918
Please walk carefully.

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,256
Look down when you walk by.

38
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:23,833
Mind your Step! Keep away from here.

39
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,907
You Crazy man!

40
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,239
People are celebrating
Janamashtmi here.

41
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,974
..and you have plonked yourself
like a pole in the middle of the road.

42
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,902
Move away!

43
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,884
Oh Ofﬁcer! The treasure
is lying open, I am protecting it!

44
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,920
Here Bhagam ji, it was a great trouble
arranging for this wooden board.

45
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,010
Here the job is done, keep the bricks.

46
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,012
Bhagam ji the bricks have been placed

47
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,993
Now that the treasure is covered,
there is nothing to fear.

48
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,991
If anyone would have fallen
into this it would have been fatal.

49
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,025
Forgive me!
I mistook you for someone else

50
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,960
It's all right,
usually people misunderstand.

51
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,929
Wham did you think, I am insane?

52
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,839
I must be mad to be standing here..

53
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,944
..and guarding this manhole
for the last ﬁve hours.

54
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,881
It doesn't matter, now that the job
is accomplished, let's go. Come on.

55
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,988
O good man, stop, stop!
Leave me at the College

56
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,889
Rickshaw ride costs money,
do you have any?

57
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,857
Yes, I do..How much will you charge?

58
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,925
Exactly two rupees and ﬁfty paisa!

59
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:31,033
Ok I will pay what you demand, but
ﬁrst let me collect this cow dung"

60
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:37,936
"ﬁlth and refuse if delivered
at the right place turns into wealth.

61
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,851
Picking up ﬁlth and wants
a rickshaw ride, English Sir!

62
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,980
The job is done.

63
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:49,982
He left!

64
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,896
When did I say I was
not going to pay for the ride?

65
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,899
Oh great! A horse carriage is here,
an open ride.

66
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,026
Stop please, halt..halt..

67
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,927
Yes

68
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,963
I want to go to the college

69
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,843
Do you study or teach at the college?

70
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,071
I am as yet a student.

71
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,845
"but you tell me what will
you charge for taking me there?

72
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,904
Exactly 5 rupees.

73
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,977
0k, I will pay you ﬁve
rupees but I have a condition"

74
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,013
We will halt on the
way several times.

75
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,016
Wherever I spot cow dung,
pebbles and stones"

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,058
..we will pick them up as we go along.

77
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,952
I agree, but I too have a condition"

78
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,058
..that I won't take you to
the college but to the mental asylum.

79
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:30,966
Ok.

80
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,003
Bhagatji we have been looking
all over for you for so long..

81
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,862
...please sit on the scooter
and let's go the college

82
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,865
I never sit on a scooter:

83
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,904
If I had my way, I would stop the
very manufacturing of motor vehicles

84
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,951
Come, we will also go walking

85
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,951
Go get some water.

86
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:07,971
Bhagam ji. - Greetings

87
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,940
We are waiting for you
with garlands and bouquets.

88
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,942
"but you are busy scattering manure.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,949
The ﬂowers in these garlands and
bouquets sprout from this very manure.

90
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,911
You watch the ﬂowers that bloom
from these rows where I have put..

91
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,045
"the manure will be more fragrant!

92
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,959
Bhagam ji, water. - Give. Good.

93
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,955
Bhagat ji, only if everyone
of us could start thinking like you..

94
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,901
Then why don't you? It costs nothing!

95
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,564
Let's go.

96
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,963
Yes let's proceed.

97
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,911
No my son..the job is done..lets go

98
00:07:56,008 --> 00:08:01,959
lam a servant who is a
mere broom at the Guru's house.

99
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,086
..and I serve at the Pingalwar

100
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,061
That you stood waiting
for me with garlands..

101
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,933
..i thank you for that..my
deepest gratitude

102
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,033
But once broken off the stem,
the fragrance of a ﬂower dies.

103
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,005
..and I want.

104
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,076
"that fragrance should
live forever omnipresent.

105
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,888
..it should live forever:

106
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,896
Now don't you think"

107
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,934
"that I am here to preach you.

108
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,973
No, I am here to converse with you

109
00:08:53,933 --> 00:09:01,078
Because the heaviest
of burdens of the heart.

110
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,983
..and the gravest of problems can be
sorted through candid conversations.

111
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:21,027
These values were given
to me by my mother"

112
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:33,076
..my mother used to tell
me that son walk carefully.

113
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:39,012
..or you might crush the ants and..

114
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,951
God resides in the ants too,
the earth belongs to them too.

115

<i>Ram '31.</i>

Watch else you will fall my son!

120
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,036
<i>Ram '31.</i>

121
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,944
Oh, you hurt yourself.

122
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,986
O see you made the
little ant spill her ﬂour.

123
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,056
Now what will the poor ant do..

124
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,926
..she was going to knead it into dough
and make chapattis for its children.

125
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,005
The ant has been hurt badly or you?

126
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,937
Of course, the ant, mother.

127
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,067
Yes, the ant has got injured.

128
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,104
In case someone had not
left the stone lying carelessly"

129
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,073
..my Ram ji won't have tripped.

130
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,940
..and fallen and the ant
won't have spilt her ﬂour.

131
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,041
Isn't it so?

132
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:48,057
That is why whenever you encounter
bricks, stones or nails in your path"

133
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,993
..pick them up and leave them aside

134
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,028
So that..- Aside?

135
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:57,966
Ye; so that neither anyone
falls on the road like Ramji..

136
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,038
..nor the ant spills its ﬂour.

137
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,094
Isn't that right?

138
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:07,035
But people arejust walking by,
no one picks up the stones and bricks.

139
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,112
But my dear son for every good deed..

140
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,972
..someone has to take the initiative,
isn't it?

141
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,104
My dear, son

142
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,272
"Your mother adores you to the moon.."

143
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:19,018
"Your mother adores you to the moon.."

144
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,956
Ramji, my son can
you bring the lamp here.

145
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,961
Mother, I am coming.

146

To spread light.

152
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,019
..the glass must be wiped
clean of all the soot and blackness.

153
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,985
Isn't it?

154
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,147
0k, listen, do you know..

155
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,060

light live together in the same lamp.

They are not going to become quiet.

They look forward to your
feeding them with your own hands.

00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,993

grains on the terrace.

174
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,100
..and then I will sit you in
my lap and feed you something special.

175
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,044
Mother, what special thing?
Sweet chapatti.

176
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,047
Yes sweet chapatti.

177
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,038
But ﬁrst the feed.

178
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,143
No. First sweet chapatti.

179
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,975
First the feed.

180
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,044
First the feed.
- No. First sweet chapatti.

181
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:11,154
First feed the birds then
sweet chapatti. Here, hold this.

182
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:19,034
Move.move.move.run-run, gOngO

183
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,061
COME"

184
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,936
COME"

COME"

186
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,970

COME"

188
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:39,073
Hail to God, hail to God.
Hail to almighty, hail to almighty

189
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:44,144
Hail to God, hail to God.
Hail to almighty, hail to almighty

190
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:50,124
Hail to God, hail to God.
Hail to almighty, hail to almighty

191
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:57,937
Hail to God, hail to God.
Hail to almighty, hail to almighty

192
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,008
Give this son.

193
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,977
May you live long dear son.

194
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,107
May God bless you with a long life,
there is lasting peace.

195
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,043
..and may you get
the best of education

196
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,046
Did you see how many blessings
you received from Bab

197
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,112
Babaji, please give me the bell.

198
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,150
Here you go boy,
now remember Bhole Namh (Lord Shiva).

199
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,988
He never used to sleep until every
living creature on this earth was fed.

200
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:35,168
Hail to God, hail to God.
Hail to almighty, hail to almighty

201
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,949
Are you feeling good?

202
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,084
Wham have you been sent
by your mother to beg for today?

203
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:57,124
Elder mother! My mother has
made and sent this sweet pudding.

204
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,161
Oh really? Now what is the happy
occasion that your 'curse' like mother?

205
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,975
It's my birthday today.

206
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,069
'It's my Birthday!' 'lNlwy were
you even born you illegitimate child.

207
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,117
If I have my way, I would not let
both mother and son enter this house.

208
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,144
What is this entire ruckus about?

209
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:22,057
Co-wife has sent this sweet
pudding to rub salt into my wounds

210
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,093
What nonsense are you blabbering?

211
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,095
All she has done is
sent some sweet pudding.

212
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,999
This very sweet pudding
is venom for me

213
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,103
Tell this boy to go away from here
and he should not confront me again

214
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:39,006
You bastard, didn't you hear
what my mother said get lost.

215
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,169
You don't know how to talk.

216
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,070
Ramji, give me the sweet pudding.

217
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,006
Mehtab.

218
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,078
Are you leaving the house for good?

219
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,050
I want to earn my own living.

220
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,112
Gulping all the insults
and abuses was not enough for you?

221
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,057
Now you want to go and
wash people's dirty utensils?

222
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,099
The entire business has
been destroyed by the epidemic.

223
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,158
How will we organize
funds to educate Ramji?

224
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,139
You should have considered this"

225
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,776
...before giving birth
to him against my wishes.

226
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,133
By saying so you
are insulting my womb.

227
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,809
I am not insulting,
just making you realize.

228
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,809
...that the path you
have chosen to walk".

229
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,817
...don't assume that
I will support you.

230
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,160
But I am left with no other option.

231
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,129
Let me make one thing
Absolutely clear.

232
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,122
Tomorrow if you reconsider and
think about returning to this house.

233
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,103
Be certain and assured of this thing"

234
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,831
"that neither me nor my son will
ever return to be a burden on you.

235
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,838
Yes.

236
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,177
..
 will remain indebted
to you forever..

237
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,793
..for allowing me to
bring my child into the world.

238
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,844
Son, you are a piece of my heart.

239
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,883
"the reason I live.

240
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,850
...If I had my way I won't
let you out of sight for a minute".

241
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,186
..but I won't let my maternal
instinct enslave me to the extent.

242
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,224
"that I ruin your life.

243
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,831
"that is why I am admitting
you to this hostel.

244
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,802
Mother! You will clean
people's dirty utensils?

245
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,145
I will sweep the ﬂoors.

246
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,872
No, why would my son sweep ﬂoors?

247
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,174
You are my prince.

248
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,180
Mother, is getting an
education very important?

249
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,225
Son..Whether education is
important or not, I do not know..

250
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:50,866
..for sure, all I want is that my
son must complete his matriculation.

251
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,800
You will do it, won't you?

252
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,796
Come let me drop you
at the hostel, come..

253
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,866
Lets go.

254
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:09,744
Mehtab Kaur, your son has grown
up into a good looking young man!

255
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,774
But since he has returned
why is he looking so distraught?

256
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,685
Failing in the matriculation
exam is weighing on his heart.

257
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,850
My dear son, God creates
good avenues to earn a living"

258
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,821
"even for the one who
fails to be a matriculate!

259
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,665
Dhanwant Kaur, if the boy's
heart does not lie in education.

260
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,669
"then let him ﬁnd a vocation.

261
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,865
Boy, if you want to get a job..

262
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,643
..then make sure you
let me know by the evening.

263
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,777
You sit with your son Mehtab Kaur,
he has returned after a long time.

264
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,789
...I will get something
to eat and drink.

265
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,681
Come sit here and both
mother-son chat up. - Okay.

266
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,661
Mother I have failed to
fulﬁl every single wish of yours.

267
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,800
My son, all my wishes are with you.

268
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,675
Moreover the matriculation exam
is not like the great Kumbh festival..

269
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,839
"That recurs after
a span of twelve years.

270
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,684
Come next year,
you can re-appear for the exam

271
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,780
Mother, neither I feel like reappearing
in the exam, nor I want to work..

272
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,746
..and I don't even want
to return to our native village

273
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,879
You don't even mention
the name of the native village.

274
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,689
What should I do then mother?

275
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,789
I can't stay with you
and I can't keep you with me..

276
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,732
...all I see is darkness all around.

277
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,735
I am not able to understand a thing.

278
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,797
Neither I nor you have a home

279
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,702
My son, God's home
is everyone's abode.

280
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,682
When the road ahead is not clear,
the thread must be turned over to God.

281
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,821
He will light up the way
and show us the right path.

282
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:19,867
Meet me, O my Dear Beloved.

283
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:25,808
Wthout You, I am totally dishonored

284
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:32,812
Meet me, O my Dear Beloved.

285
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:38,794
Wthout You, I am totally dishonored

286
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,894
The sleep does not come in my eyes

287
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,796
Son, once you were very sick.

288
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,831
The fever just refused to go down.

289
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:57,745
..and then I prayed to the Almighty
to bless you with a long life.

290
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,746
He will see to your matters.

291
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,752
..you have not failed my son,
only I had forgotten.

292
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:12,795
Waheguru, I hand over my son to You..

293
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,791
..if You are there
then I have no fear.

294
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,889
Meet me, O my Dear Beloved.

295
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:29,872
Wthout You, I am totally dishonored

296
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,696
I have no desire for food or waten.

297
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,789
..and i am dying from
the pain of separation.

298
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:55,839
'Without my husband lord,
how can I find peace?

299
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:01,761
I offered my prayers to the Guru;
if it pleases the Guru,

300
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,843
he shall unite me with himself.

301
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,918
Mother..your forehead is burning.

302
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,732
Yes my son,
the fever is refusing to let go.

303
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,799
But I am constantly
thinking about you.

304
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,707
Even I was anxious over there

305
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,881
Last night mother,
I kept dreaming of you.

306
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,874
It seemed you were calling out to me

307
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,854
I was actually calling for you my son.

308
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,915
Come mother, let me take
you to Dera Sahab Gurdwar.

309
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,727
...I will serve and
look after you daily.

310
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:57,766
There is no way out anymore.

311
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,712
But without working..

312
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,678
I don't want to be
a burden here anymore.

313
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,819
Come on dear sister,
don't say like that?

314
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:18,811
Wham burden?

315
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,849
Joy and pain are inseparable
pans of the body.

316
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,728
You have been a great support.

317
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,795
"but now it seems..

318
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,862
"but now it seems
as if my time has come.

319
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,839
Don't make such
disheartening statements.

320
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,773
You have to live long.

321
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,871
This son of yours needs you.

322
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,839
Good son,
you must look after your mother.

323
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,843
If you need something,
don't ever hesitate in asking.

324
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:54,756
Mother, now I won't leave
you alone for even one moment.

325
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,855
Son, just once..

326
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,826
..for one last time,
take me to my village Rajewal.

327
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,868
Don't know why..

328
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,939
..Mother is insisting on going
to Rajewal instead of the hospital.

329
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,854
Oh..God.. oh..

330
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,745
We got so lame reaching Rajewal..

331
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,776
...and found the main
door of the house locked.

332
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:58,876
Elder Mother!

333
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,790
Please open the door to us.

334
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,781
Elder mother, please open the door!

335
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,886
Open the door.

336
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,760
Mother".

337
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,762
Wham happened, mother?

338
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,736
Oh God.

339
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,751
Some of money is lying
deposited with Mahant Teja Singh.

340
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,880
Swear by my milk..

341
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,759
..that you will not spend a single
paisa from that amount on yourself.

342
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,798
I am a sinner, I am a witch.

343
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,926
No, mother.

344
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,829
You don't know..

345
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,775
...I was a virgin widow..

346
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,790
"Your father gave me shelter..

347
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:46,861
..and made me promise that
I will not bear him a child, ever.

348
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:54,926
Thrice he compelled me to abort.

349
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:07,849
But when you were in my womb..

350
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,913
"than time"

351
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,891
..a plague had enveloped the village

352
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,888
I had got this medicine for you,
why haven't you consumed it yet?

353
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,889
L..l didn't have
it and I won't have it.

354
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,856
Wham do you imply?

355
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,896
Don't force me.

356
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,600
Remember our pact Mehtab.

357
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,870
Your pact has made me a murderer
instead of being a mother

358
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,600
I have told you that you
will not give birth to this child.

359
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:09,867
Life and death are matters best
left in the hands of the Almighty.

360
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,872
That a child will not be
born from your womb in my house..

361
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,609
..was our decision.

362
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,609
It was your decision.

363
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,884
For god sake change your decision

364
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,960
Look outside.

365
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:31,898
...there are corpses
being burnt in every field..

366
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,565
...people are begging
for every breath.

367
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:43,606
..and you want to murder my
child before it comes into this world?

368
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:52,616
I don't want to bury anymore
of my womb's ﬂesh and blood.

369
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,885
In the name of God, at least
let this child come into the world.

370
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,924
It's 0k,
but this child will never be my..

371
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:09,904
...legal heir, it will get
no share of my assets. That <i>is</i> final!

372
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,934
Mother" Mother" mother

373
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,654
Son..why are you sitting here?

374
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,665
Sai ji..Mother is gone.

375
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,934
Yes, I just came to know.

376
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,677
Sai ji..mother was
very sad when she departed.

377
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,983
Did she speak to you of anything?

378
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,622
I wish..she had spoken
to me about them a long time ago.

379
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,680
"I have not yet tasted divine love,
O beloved"

380
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,720
"I have not yet tasted divine love,
O beloved"

381
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,606
From the guru's blessed kithcen.
"I have waited so long for this love"

382
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,737
From the guru's blessed kithcen.
"I have waited so long for this love"

383
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,010
From the guru's blessed kithcen

384
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,672
\Mth both hands.

385
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,682
From the guru's blessed kithcen

386
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:06,745
WaheguruJ have been seeing
you serving here for years now!

387
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,023
This service has been assigned
to me from God's own abode.

388
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,720
I am God's appointed orderly here

389
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,685
May God reward you
for your selﬂess services

390
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,791
What is your good name?

391
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,660
My Elder mother had named
my elder brother Ramji.

392
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,697
So my mother used to call me Ram ji..

393
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,769
..you both are like mother's to me,
call me what you wish.

394
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,701
Here take some bread.

395
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,737
Kheer WahegurujL.

396
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,650
little one, will you have some kheer.

397
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,720
This poor child is invalid..

398
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,784
..he can't eat with his own hands

399
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,652
We have just brought him
here to leave him at the orphanage.

400
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,628
Waheguru.

401
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,738
We want you to admit
this child into the orphanage.

402
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:05,773
Who is this child?

403
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,615
This child is our responsibility.

404
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,775
His mother passed on two months ago..

405
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,723
..and his father left
him with us and ran away.

406
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,717
We don't know now what to do.

407
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,693
We walked along way to get here.

408
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,720
That is all right.

409
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,629
"but our orphanage is meant
to be a home for the orphans.

410
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,727
..we have no special arrangements.

411
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,727
..to take care of a
child with disabilities

412
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,801
That is why we cannot admit him here,
this is our compulsion.

413
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,669
Where should we take him then?

414
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,751
You will have to make
arrangements for him elsewhere.

415
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,782
What to do with him now? This
problem is now stuck to us like glue

416
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,754
Yes buddy.
If we return home with him..

417
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,632
..our families are going
to turn us out on the streets.

418
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,667
Let us leave him
here somewhere midst.

419
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,725
"the beggars and walk
away..what do you say?

420
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,738
Moreover,
the crippled don't live too long.

421
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,799
He will pass on within a year or so.

422
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,708
Then why don't we
ﬁnish him off and leave

423
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,745
The matter will be
sorted for once and all.

424
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,781
Why should we partner in sin.

425
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,743
The Gurdvvara people
will manage themselves.

426
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,711
..if they don't the
sin will be theirs.

427
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,791
Ji Giani Ji.

428
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,797
Guru's beloved, you have served
the Guru's house for many years.

429
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:44,703
You have spared no effort in serving
the poor, the sick and the needy.

430
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,649
Looking at the selﬂess
service that you have rendered..

431
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,654
...I thought of you today.

432
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,776
Just order me

433
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,656
VWth the shelter and support
of Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji..

434
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,695
"today, I am entrusting
you with a big responsibility.

435
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,766
You will raise this child".

436
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,657
ha.

437
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,739
My good fortune Giani ji.

438
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,768
Now on, you are his
mother and father both.

439
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,750
It is my mother's fourth
death anniversary.

440
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:38,698
..and you have given
me an invaluable gift.

441
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,707
May WaheGuru bless!

442
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,837
I will give this child
as much love and affection.

443
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,682
..as my mother had given me

444
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,373
"I have not yet tasted divine love,
O beloved"

445
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,686
"I have not yet tasted divine love,
O beloved"

446
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,850
Come, please come. Come Very good.

447
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:09,791
"I waited so long for this Love"

448
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:15,803
"I waited so long for this Love"

449
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,833
Come let us take a bath.

450
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:28,715
Dear let's have a bath.

451
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,687
And then eat sweetmeats.

452
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,782
Dear has taken a bath
and will now eat sweetmeats

453
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,799
What do you keep thinking
sitting alone my son?

454
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,717
To be a virgin widow is a curse..

455
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,686
..and to be a co-wife suffering.

456
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,656
Who are you referring to?

457
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,663
Mother".

458
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,725
My mother..

459
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,763
My mother suffered so much grief.

460
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,743
"Swallowed so many insults.

461
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,712
She lived in pain and anguish.

462
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,756
"but never let go of her motherhood.

463
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:56,669
..those sins were not earned by my
mother, those were my father's sins.

464
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,801
..not my mother's.

465
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,841
Mother I will look upon
every woman as a mother"

466
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:24,823
Your little arms around my
neck and I sway to the tune of love".

467
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:31,773
I sway to the tune of love.
For my dear baby

468
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:36,829
for your pure love my baby

469
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:44,683
I would give my heart,
my spirit, everything

470
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:51,751
for your pure love my baby

471
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:05,773
Pyara is.. Pyara is
not.. Pyara is..Pyara is not.

472
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,064
Pyara is.. Pyara is
not.. Pyara is..Pyara is not.

473
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:12,802
Pyara is.. Pyara is
not.. Pyara is..Pyara is not.

474
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,874
Sai ji this is my toy.

475
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,743
God has given me atoy.

476
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:28,695
Waheguru, Waheguru True King..

477
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,801
I pray for a long
life of this invalid..

478
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,866
..he is my toy..

479
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,777
..and I can't live without him.

480
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,875
I desire nothing except
for this invalid boy.

481
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,753
I want nothing more..

482
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,883
..and won't ever need anything more.

483
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,763
Blood stained Rabab?
Where is the Rabab's owner Sai Ditta?

484
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,790
The rioters appeared from nowhere.

485
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,838
..and killed Sai Ditt

486
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,851
I was sitting next to his body,
holding the Rabab..

487
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:02,721
..when Muslim rioters
happened to come by.

488
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:10,824
Perhaps they mistook me
for a muslim and spared my life..

489
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:17,737
then the police came, the army
came and took his body away somewhere.

490
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,836
Oh Pyare, oh Pyare!

491
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:25,870
<i>Sal Dika</i>

492
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,738
Oh come my dear Pyare

493
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,765
You clean the rabab
and keep it inside.

494
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,746
..in case we both
are destined to die..

495
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,788
...I wish God takes away first..

496
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:14,821
..so that I can save your corpse
from the feeding crows and dogs

497
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,787
Waheguru.. Waheguru.. Waheguru

498
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,893
Sitting in WaheGuru's house don't
speak such disheartening things"

499
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,829
..it is not the time to
mourn but to exhibit courage.

500
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,867
Yes

501
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,755
It appears there will be
no relaxation in the imposed curfew.

502
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,949
It is the third day and the children
are suffering because of hunger.

503
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,883
No Giani ji, you don't worry,
I will manage the situation somehow.

504
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:48,830
...I will take Gurmukh
Singh to the langar hall..

505
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,788
..we will cook chapattis and
serve them to the hungry with pickle.

506
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:51,888
Okay.

507
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,800
This situation seems to be getting
worse. Come on that is better.

508
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,769
<i>Gummkh singh '31 -Yes.</i>

509
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,759

510
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,830
I will prepare the dough. - Good.

Are you ﬁne?

513
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,815
Come..Come. Nothing will happen..

514
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,886
Bhagat ji, all arrangements have
been made for your travel to Amritsar

515
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,789
Taxi is here,
food is ready at my home.

516
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,868
..and you cannot leave without
having a meal at my house

517
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:06,808
Principal Sir,
I don't travel in motor vehicles".

518
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:13,747
..they pollute the environment,
we will walk to your residence

519
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,873
Moreover,
the station is not far from here.

520
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,842
..we will walk to the station also.

521
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,822
Thank you, it was a great experience.

522
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:27,760
Let us go. Come let's go. Everything
was good and we had a good experience.

523
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,829
Welcome Bhagat Ji..

524
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,838
Dear, please tell your
aunt to lay the table. - Okay.

525
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,903
My good fortune that you
have stepped into a poor man's home

526
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,870
Poor man's home?

527
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,873
It appears more like
a store house for wood.

528
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,819
So much use of wood?

529
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:56,949
My children were keen on
a lot of woodwork in the house.

530
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,858
Sol got it done all over the house,
you please sit and enjoy the meal.

531
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,866
Eat, I won't even take
a sip of water in this house.

532
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,589
"eating food is out of question.
- What happened Bhagam ji.

533
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,825
At least tell me
what wrong have I done?

534
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,804
Wrong?

535
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,907
You have ripped out
the lungs of the poor..

536
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,569
..and adorned the walls
and ﬂoors of your home..

537
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,813
..have you ever planted
a sapling with your own hands?

538
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,870
God forbid if you need it tomorrow"

539
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,579
..you will spend money
and buy the oxygen you need.

540
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,854
How will the poor breathe?

541
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,980
Children were keen, what a great fool!

542
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,858
Bhagam Ji. - Bhagam ji.

543
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,896
Bhagat Ji. Bhagat ji.

544
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,854
Foolish man, the children insisted.

545
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,562
...and he calls himself a teacher.
- Bhagat ji.. please listen.

546
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:10,922
Bhagatji you walk so briskly,
I had to literally run to catch up.

547
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:18,635
Oh madam that is why I never
hail a rickshaw, they move so slow.

548
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,933
In ﬁt of rage, you came
without eating, please eat now.

549
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:29,612
No madam you eat,
I will eat anywhere on the way.

550
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,880
I manage all right
even if I don't eat.

551
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:37,949
Bhagam ji, I don't cut down tree;
please eat my meal.

552
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,656
You don't know madam.

553
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,625
..the way we are continuously cutting
down trees, and we are destroying.

554
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,903
..we are inviting ﬂoods and nature's
wealth wrath to be fall on us

555
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,904
We are beckoning death.

556
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,634
You preach day and night, people
will start to understand gradually

557
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:02,583
Oh no, people will
understand all right.

558
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,682
"but these literate
fools will never learn.

559
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,956
Now let go of all your
concerns for a while and eat.

560
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,994
Staying hungry like this
equates to an invitation to death

561
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,965
H ere, eat.

562
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:23,694
Okay, give me.

563
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,974
You worry about me a lot.

564
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,649
You too, worry about everyone

565
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,007
Bhagat ji,
when I reach home and tell..

566
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:43,617
..everyone that I met you, my whole
family is going to be so pleased.

567
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,959
May God bless you with a long life,
you have great values

568
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,734
Bhagam ji,
I will come to see the Pingalwar

569
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,606
ls it a zoo that
you will come to see it?

570
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,008
It is a home for the homeless.

571
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:09,747
If you wish to come,
then come to serve and not to see.

572
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:35,666
Come Sardar sir,
Come here come come, Come

573
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,603
Please move a bit.

574
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:48,745
Come, gentleman

575
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,759
Don't hesitate, come and sit.
Come..come..come.

576
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,705
Why are you carrying
this broken glass?

577
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,780
So that it does not
hurt my mother's foot..

578
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,759
..or leave anyone
bleeding and injured.

579
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,763
Great, but who are you?

580
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,698
I mistook you were someone else?

581
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,736
Often people think I am someone else..

582
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,641
..and later become my friends also.

583
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,768
We became friends the moment we sat
together and struck a conversation.

584
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,614
"but your clothes
your cauldron, your style?

585
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:48,741
Original, isn't it.

586
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,688
Why do you wear a
bell round your neck?

587
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,655
So that you would ask..

588
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,787
..see it pleases everyone.

589
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:06,725
But please tell me the actual reason,
why do you wear it?

590
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:12,672
I ring this bell
and attract people's..

591
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,777
..attention towards my Pingalwar.

592
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:21,646
..and to seek help for
the sick and the disabled

593
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,708
So you are Bhagam Puran Singhji.
Glad to meet you.

594
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,747
No, no, just hail 'victory
be to God' greetings, greetings.

595
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,621
I am Surjeet Singh Barnala, Advocate.

596
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:31,817
That's nice

597
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,629
lam a big admirer of
your service to mankind..

598
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,755
..but I have met you
in person for the ﬁrst time.

599
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:38,722
Can I ask you a question, Bhagat Ji?

600
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:43,760
Yes, you are an advocate, of course
you will question..go ahead ask.

601
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,709
Where did you get the thought
of setting up the Pingalwara?

602
00:52:54,771 --> 00:53:00,687
An invalid in Lahore had
become a garland around my neck..

603
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:08,719
"after the partition of 1947
when we crossed over to this side..

604
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,790
In refugee camp of Khalsa
College I saw that there was..

605
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,702
..no arrangements for
the handicapped and the sick.

606
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:20,835
They were going hither and thither:

607
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,777
Here you go, you can go to the camp

608
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,775
Greetings..- Greetings..

609
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:35,780
Yes young man,
get your details and of your family.

610
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:39,725
..the property and possessions
left behind and your savings notiﬁed

611
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:44,757
I have one rupee and ﬁve
anas in my pocket for savings

612
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,823
Even if you did not
have that one person.

613
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:50,704
it would not have mattered,
any other relations or family members?

614
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,677
I had a mother who can no
longer be conﬁned by borders..

615
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:01,740
..she left for the heavenly abode,
this invalid here on my shoulders.

616
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,777
..my Pyara, he is my everything.

617
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,653
He was four years old..

618
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,691
..and ever since I wear him like
a precious necklace around my neck

619
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:17,688
This old man is unwell,
he hailed me as a son and like a son.

620
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,756
I got him here.

621
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,737
You did a good thing.

622
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,766
Here you go,
proceed to the camp further ahead.

623
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,671
We request to all the
people who sheltered"

624
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,807
..in Khalsa college refugee camp..

625
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,722
That due to sudden increase
in strength of people.

626
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,659
"We urgently required some
volunteers to come forward and help us

627
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,858
'Ne request to all brothers and sister
that Please come forward to help us.

628
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,837
Oh..

629
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:12,676
What happened Babaji,
why are you sitting so listless?

630
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,755
Are you feeling all right? If
you need something then let me know?

631
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:21,718
I am not feeling well son,
my heart seems to be sinking.

632
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,759
I will be very grateful to you
if you can bring me a sip of juice.

633
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,803
Please order me, I am here to serve

634
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,673
Take these two rupee;
go and grab a bottle ofjuice.

00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,680
I will get it in ajiffy.

636

Let's go Pyare ji, Lets go..
Go go go..

637
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,745
Let Pyara's horse run..Pyara's
horse goes like this.

638
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,775
Here you go babaji,
chilled juice for you to drink.

639
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,789
I got a little lame because
I had to go up to Putlighan.

640
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,759
..you must be wondering that
I ran away with your 2 rupees.

641
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,885
<i>Come Pyare '31.</i>

642
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:34,835
Wham happened babaji, are you
angry with me, why don't you speak?

643
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,672
Let me serve you this chilled juice
and your temper will cool down too.

644
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,710
Babaji..

645
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,775
Babaji..

646
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:53,847
Bab.

647
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,802
I have some savings.

648
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,834
..and you must swear by my milk that"

649
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,770
..you will not spend even a single
paisa out of that money on yourself.

650
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,848
Mother today I realized.

651
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,828
..why you strictly forbade
me from using the money..

652
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,756
..you had kept aside
for your own cremation

653
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:50,704
Wham should I do with the
rest of this old man's money mother?

654
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,706
Gurmukh Singh..

655
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,861
I have some money with me

656
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,794
..they belong to an
old man who passed away.

657
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,864
I was wondering what to do with it?

658
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,812
I remembered Gurmukh Singh,
please keep the money sister..

659
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,747
"You will be able to fulfill
some needs of the children

660
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,841
No brother; your needs are no less.

661
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:44,850
And I am using it for the
needs of my sister's children

662
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,853
Keep it sister, keep it.

663
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,732
God will take care.

664
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,597
The refugee camps
of 1947 have long ended..

665
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,735
"but there is no end to
the suffering of the refugees

666
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:34,732
Oh God, so much
Bloodshed and killing..

667
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,739
..has the country attained
freedom or has been destroyed?

668
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,639
Since the partition no one
seems to claim the responsibility.

669
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,742
..for these cripples and invalids

670
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,651
They are rendered homeless
and are suffering.

671
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,725
Neither they will remain
homeless nor crippled.

672
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:56,389
God has assigned me
to build a home for them

673
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,394
Bhagat Ji. -Yes

674
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:02,758
Aml right Pyare?

675
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,707
O Pyara is Pyara, Pyara is not Pyara

676
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,717
To arrange for chapattis I had
to go and plead from door to door..

677
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,718
...but now I don't have to wait".

678
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,780
"Now people have started giving
chapattis each morning and evening.

679
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,783
Yes brother..

680
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:30,696
"encouraged by your efforts
I have also been able to serve them

681
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,755
But BhagatjL.

682
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:37,394
..you have washing their dirty
clothes of patients for years now..

683
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,667
..and you never even
let us touch them.

684
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,734
I don't see any filth in them.

685
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,773
"their suffering is what
I see and it reminds me of my mother.

686
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,412
Taking care of them
and cleaning their clothes

687
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,726
I have never felt any repulsion.

688
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,752
I look for my mother
in these cripples".

689
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:11,462
..and I see my incomplete
brothers and sisters in invalids.

690
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,408
..who had to die before
they were born into this world.

691
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,745
Bhagat Ji I will go
and arrange for chapattis

692
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:23,773
Bhagat Ji, it is going to be cold and
we don't have enough warm clothes.

693
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,776
..how will we manage?

694
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:27,777
<i>OK.</i>

695
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,783
But I have only one bank, God's Bank..

696
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,423
..the only hitch is that
He issues a cheque at his will.

697
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,459
All right Bhagatji I take your leave

698
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,734
..you leave Pyara with Bhano.

699
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,735
I will pick him up on my return

700
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:51,434
Come my lonesome goat,
your buddies have already moved on.

701
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:01,421
Here you go madam Bhano.

702
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,516
Today, once again I am
leaving my Pyarawith you.

703
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,785
Oh he is our darling Pyara too"!

704
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:15,759
Come dear son, I have cooked
these especially for you.

705
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,559
Oh great, its treat for you!

706
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,769
In fact he keeps us amused..

707
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:25,802
..and watching all the hustle and
bustle on the road, he keeps busy too.

708
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:30,511
That's good. Wham to do..

709
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,548
I can't leave him alone..

710
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:36,548
..and to collect alms I
have to travel great distances.

711
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,456
If I don't speak to him for a while,
he gets annoyed.

712
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,469
Pyare, I will be back..Should I go?

713
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,562
Dog..dog..dog

714
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:03,576
Oh pyary. oh pyara pyara pyar.
Kanna manaa kurrrr.

715
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:09,853
Let him go son,
he has to collect donations for you.

716
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:14,518
I am indebted to you for this favor.
How will I ever repay you?

717
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,486
You take such good
care of my Pyara every day.

718
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:22,502
Why do you say like than,
It's you who does selﬂess service..

719
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:25,596
..and if for a little
while he stays with us here..

720
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,566
..it's no big deal at all.

721
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:35,447
You don't worry at all, he remains
happy like our corn here..isn't it?

722
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:41,572
\M

- OK. I'll leave.

723
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,525
Sure, sure

724
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:52,591
My dear..darling popcorn
will you have some?

725
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,636
Make donations for the lame,
the invalids, Waheguru will bless you.

726
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,596

O Come Bhagat, come, come..

729
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,477
I knew you would not have
eaten anything like everyday..

730
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,453
..here eat something.

731
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:19,550
O no my brother..my children

733
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:31,561
Whose child is this"?
Who is with him..?

734
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,596
No one.he is an orphan..

735
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,634
..someonejust left him
here at the station yesterday

736
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,476
Okay.

737
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,103
In that case he is my child.

738
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:45,608
In that case he is my child.

739
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,580
Come my child. come my dear child.

740
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,521

Come my child.

01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,460
..he hasn't even turned
over or spoken anything.

743
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:03,626
He must be hungry,
quickly give something to eat.

744
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,571
Here you go Bhagat.

01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,645
He says, he has eaten
food and drink water.

..he won't have been
dumped here like this"

You have to vacate this building.

The society refuses to
take their responsibility?

your head that TB is curable".

..and the patients
can be healthy again"

816
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,554
..if I contracted TB
would my mother abandon me.

817

..and if it took me one year instead
of a month to die from the disease.

strangled me to death?

the limitations of the government.

821

And in case your government".

822
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,694
"can't understand the
helplessness of my patients.

thousand rupees.

I don't care for
your hundred thousand

..the least we can do for
them is ﬁnd them a place to live.

839

..so that they can die with dignity

840
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:45,587
Okay.

with the government".

where you can build the Pingalwar.

burlap sacks are saying"

"either put some ﬂour
or don't touch and stay far.

Wow..Now the sacks have turned poetic.

"then we must ﬁnd
some ﬂour for them

847
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,764
But Bhagat Ji where will
we arrange for the ﬂour from.

01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:35,647
Don't worry,
we will also sound our bell..

850
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:42,552
..come on my heart, now people have
started addressing you 'devotee'..

851
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,626
..and its time to act like one,
pick up your cauldron.

852
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,562
..and sound the bell.

853
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,152
\Mth an iron cauldron in hand

854
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:56,569
\Mth an iron cauldron in hand

855
01:14:56,692 --> 01:15:01,698
And a brass bell around the neck.

856
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:07,773
\Mth an iron cauldron in hand

857
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:13,609
And a brass bell around the neck.

858
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:19,753
The hungry,
helpless, old and the crippled.

859
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:25,697
The hungry,
helpless, old and the crippled.

860
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:31,568
look towards you with hopeful eyes

861
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,699
You must go on to
seek alms for them.

862
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,743
O Chain Singh..will you come here

863
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,670
Coming, Bhagatji. -Come, come

864
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:41,737
I was feeling a bit tired.

865
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,675
Till we continue to breath.

866
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,777
..we can neither be exhausted
nor distraught, understood?

867
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,776
Bhagam Ji, you have created
a huge pile of these bricks..

868
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,723
..and stones that
you pick from the roads.

869
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,751
My good man, there are two
things I do with great interest.

870
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,663
..picking up stones
and bricks from the roads..

871
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:02,701
..so that no one gets
injured or knocked down..

872
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,629
..and secondly picking up
lame and crippled from the roads.

873
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,763
..so that no one knocks them down.

874
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,607
That is allright Bhagam ji

875
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,580
"but what do you intend
to do with these bricks and stones?

876
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:18,635
Hey, silly boy..these will
be the foundation of the Pingalwar

877
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:19,744
Wow bhagam ji wow..!!

878
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,691
Good..good..

879
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:32,616
that the homeless have a home

880
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:37,798
and they have some name

881
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:43,794
Every time he prays to
God to bless the sufferers.

882
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:56,655
"And pain with a heart
overﬂowing but pockets empty"

883
01:16:56,712 --> 01:17:02,594
"and pain with a heart
overﬂowing but pockets empty"

884
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,723
"there is no other way"

885
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:10,787
"you must go out
to seek alms for them"

886
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:19,611
"you must go out
to seek alms for them"

887
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,737
Please give

..you keep coming back,
don't you feel ashamed when you beg.

890
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,724
..you are strong and able-bodied,
God has given you hands and feet.

891
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,415
..go earn aliving.

892
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:38,728
God has blessed me with hands
and feet but not my family members.

893
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:43,396
Wham do you mean?
How big is your family?

894
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:50,641
Must be around 150 members lame and
disabled, sick and diseased, crippled.

I want to go out and play.
- What happened sister?

925
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,754
What new is going to happen?

926
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,787
She is a little mad, poor girl..

927
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:47,793
"this man feeds her like
a dog and locks her in every day..

928
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,817
...he is as heartless as an executioner.

929
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:54,767
You do me a favor sister,
Somehow get her to the Pingalwar

930
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,764
What are you saying?

931
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,429
How can we break
into someone's house.

932
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,461
..and send his wife to the Pingalwara?

933
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:00,803
I want to go out and play.

934
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:02,830
But what to do now?

935
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,437
Men go off to work.

936
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,548
..and we have to listen
to her wails and shrieks all day.

937
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:13,412
Now what to do?
Poor girl is expecting child also.

938
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,543
oh my God!

939
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:19,458
Someone should kill a man like this

940
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:44,275
Bhagat Ji We have come
from the Sadar police station

941
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,253
A complaint has been
Registered against Pingalwar

942
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,181
How dare you bring my wife
to the Pingalwara forcibly?

943
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,091
O brother, Pingalwara has been built"

944
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,217
for the homeless,
the needy and the destitute

945
01:20:56,218 --> 01:21:00,223
She doesn't need your support
I am there to help her.

946
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,224
But who are you?

947
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,226
That is what I have come to tell you

948
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,231
Bhagam ji we hold you in high esteem.

949
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,244
..you please return his wife to him
and he will withdraw his complaint.

950
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,268
The matter will be settled
for good here and now.

951
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:19,106
Till you don't give him his wife back,
we will not go from here.

952
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,108
I will eat chapamtL.

953
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,154
Madam, tell me one thing"

954
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,148
How can this woman be his wife

955
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:31,119
Did he marry her in a Gurdwara?
Has he actually married her?

956
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,188
I will keep her as I wish
who are you to interfere.

957
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,327
..moreover this is my personal affair.

958
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:41,106
Now it is not your personal
matter..it is a matter of humanity.

959
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:47,097
...this 25-26 year old woman
has a brain of an <i>8</i> year old child".

960
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,148
...she is unaware of herself..

961
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,116
..and you have pushed
her into motherhood.

962
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,275
..does she even know
who her husband is?

963
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:57,244
But I know that..l am her husband.

964
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:00,317
O what husband's duties
have you discharged?

965
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:03,289
I picked her from the street

966
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:07,156
brought her home,
gave her shelter and two square meals

967
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:10,134
O great..bravo..great.

968
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,263
In exchange for two chapatis you've
fed on her like a beast, isn't it?

969
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,165
And you don't marry her..

970
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:21,268
..so that you can push her
out of your house at your convenience

971
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,249
She is carrying my child.

972
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,109
She will deliver a
child courtesy your lust.

973
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,278
..she does not need lust,
she needs compassion.

974
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:35,125
..she does not need your
conﬁnement..she needs a hospital"

975
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,117
...tell me one thing..

976
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,223
..why don't you take her
to a mental asylum a hospital"

977
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,255
..and get her treated?

978
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,190
I am not responsible for all than.

979
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:47,298
But I have taken the responsibility.
I will get her treated.

980
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:51,235
...she is not a helpless animal..who
will succumb to your lust..

981
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,146
..she is a daughter;
daughter of Pingalwar

982
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,308
Bhagatji don't make
things worse like this"

983
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:02,276
...else we will have to use force.

984
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:07,124
Look Inspector sir..l have said
it that she is pingalwara's daughter..

985
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:10,184
..and if pinga
wara's
daughter will leave from here

986
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,252
she will leave after
he duly marries her with

987
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:17,134
a proper ceremony and
we will send her off happily.

988
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:20,104
What does she know of ceremonies,
she is mad?

989
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,232
O she isn't mad, you are..

990
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,132
..who thinks this helpless woman

991
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,170
has to bear your children
for merely two chapattis.

992
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,168
Bhagam ji listen.

993
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:32,140
O madam..you too listen carefully.

994
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:37,248
..you squat here.protest..
eave
aside the police, get the army..

995
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:41,181
I will not hand over
this girl to that beast.

996
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,219
Bhagam ji,
then how will we resolve this matter?

997
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:52,194
0k, in case he does
not want to marry her

998
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,199
then he must write a will that
her child will inherit his assets.

999
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,242
L..how can I do that?

1000
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,143
O you can't do a thing"

1001
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:03,212
Mohindro.. - Yes.

1002
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,172
Take our daughter in.

1003
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,245
Ye; Bhagam ji..get up child.

1004
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:14,316
Oh Inspector sir, you go
ahead and follow your procedures

1005
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:19,198
arrest me..

1006
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,266
put me behind bars.

1007
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,203
Do what you have to,
it does not matter,

1008
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:27,106
what matters is the one thing
that I have made clear to you,

1009
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:32,202
that Pingalwara's daughter
will not go from here.

1010
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,310
Let's go Sardar sir,
we will ﬁnd some other solution.

1011
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:52,286
Here you go madam
I have done as you had instructed

1012
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:56,258
boiled the nipple in water
before pouring the milk in the bottle

1013
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:57,301
This is very important,

1014
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,227
by following this the baby
will not fall sick. - okay.

1015
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:03,175
Keep the nipple covered
and protected from ﬂies.

1016
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,198

Yes

1024
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:25,285
Bhagatji I feel this place
is in dire need of nurses.

1025
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:29,289
Madam the needs and
requirements are plenty.

1026
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:33,193
This Pingalwara doesn't need employees

1027
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,329
but people who are willing
to serve with a pure heart.

1028
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,274
Yes

1029
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,275

01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,176
You have tied this bandage so neatly.

1031
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,283
Have you done a course in nursing?

1032
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,152
Nursing and medicine too.

1035
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:59,219

Pingalwara needs to come and serve

1036
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,320
Bravo!

1037
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:04,235
Bhagam ji our entire
family worships you

1038
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,294
My father has a clinic in Sangrun.

1039
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,328
Sangrun.

1040
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,363

I am..a Pingalwara donation
box has been installed at the clinic".

1044
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:22,342
Whenever your workers
come in to take the collections

1045
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,289
They leave lots of literature

1046
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:28,215
and our entire family reads
every word carefully, contemplates

1047
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,321
and then we try to
follow your teachings.

1048
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,166
I am glad you told me -Yes

1049
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:34,324
My worker informed me

1050
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,358
that at your house,
the needs of the needy are met - Yes

1051
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,339
and there is a round the clock langan

1052
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:44,334
This is the inﬂuence of
your teachings only, Bhagat Ji.

1053
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,172
Bravo!

1054
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:51,206
After meeting you madam,
I am eager to meet your famiy.

1055
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:55,345
It will be our great fortune
if you set foot in our house.

1056
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,278
Ok tell me one thing -Yes.

1057

1061
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:37,326
Oh Bhagat ji is sitting here..

1062
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:41,990
My respects - Bhagam

1063
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,339
Bhagat Ji I have
come to make a donation

1064
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,964
of 1
akh rupees to the Pingalwar

1065
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,309
Sit down..

1066
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:05,008
Chain Singh,
tell cashier to get the receipt book.

1067
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,016
Bhagat Ji, I am in no hurry to
take the receipt. I can take it later.

1068
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,291
Please keep.

1069
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:17,268

akh rupees and

1070
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,298
get me a receipt made for 5lakh.

1071
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:28,270
"after I get the receipt,
I will send another 1
akh to you.

1072
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:37,015
Have you come here to make
a donation or commit a tax theft.

1073
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:41,349
It's not that Bhagat ji,
actually I got to know

1074
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:45,292
that the Pingalwara is
going through a bad phase

1075
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,326
Difﬁcult not bad.

1076
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:55,974
Ok then let's do this on the land
right next to Pingalwara on GT road.

1077
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:59,071
I will construct a market place.

1078
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,344
You will have a regular income source

1079
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,409
and I will open afew shops,
what do you say?

1080
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:13,113
Oh good man, Pingalwara
runs on grants and donations

1081
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,320
not with shops.

1082
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,354
I would prefer to ask for
1 rupee each from a 1
akh people

1083
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,001
than taking a 1
akh from one person

1084
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:31,367
I am highly obliged that
you spared your precious time

1085
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,374
and came to the Pingalwar

1086
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:37,380
Bhagt ji, perhaps you did
not understand what I meant.

1087
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:43,079
The thing i; the day I start
worrying about the Pingalwar

1088
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:48,059
God will stop worrying about it.

1089
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,991
I take your leave Bhagam ji.

1090
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:07,100
Sister, don't lose heart..you
will be better in 2-4 days.

1091
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:11,379
Bhagat ji someone has left this baby
at the doorstep of the Pingalwar

1092
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:15,381
Bring her here..

1093
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:21,388
Great, wow..

1094
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,032
Mohendro, a daughter has arrived

1095
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:40,102
She is very tiny..bare
y two,
three days old,

1096
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:44,047
Bhagat ji how are we going
to raise this motherless child?

1097
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,139
Oh no, once she has
arrived at the Pingalwara

1098
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,177
how can she be without
a mother anymore?

1099
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:59,062
She is starving..she can't take
a top feed..hand her to me Bhagat Ji

1100
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:02,055
Why are you making my daughter cry..
why are you making my daughter cry?

1101
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,093
Let go of her, what are you doing?
- leave her.

1102
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,033
Wait Mohendro.

1103
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:16,444
Bhagam ji she is mad,
she might drop and kill the baby.

1104
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:19,142
She is not mad,

1105
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,150
She is a mothen.

1106
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:27,081
..her Ruhani died a month ago
but maternal instincts don't die.

1107
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,030
Maternal instincts don't die.

1108
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:11,194
Come, step upﬁhagatji
is going to solve your issue..

1109
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,137
Come here.

1110
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,141
Stand here and let me talk"

1111
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:24,208
Bhagat ji he is asking
for an advance and leave too.

1112
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,083
Give him

1113
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,156
But Bhagatji he is 
ying..

1114
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:37,094
He had taken a leave and an
advance too, six months ago also..

1115
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,122
Six months ago also
his mother had expired

1116
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,258
and today again his
mother has expired - Really!

1117
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,166
Do one thing -Yes.

1118
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,067
Sanction him both the
advance and the leave, it

1119
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:55,101
Okay.- must be some serious compulsion

1120
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:57,139
that he has killed his
mother for a second time.

1121
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:01,143
<i>But Bhagam '31 he is the same man</i>

1122
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:06,157
who instigated the employees against
you and to proceed on a strike.

1123
01:33:08,182 --> 01:33:11,129
That was his misconception,

1124
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:14,097
I thought he was my son

1125
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:18,159
and he thought I am the
owner and he is a mere employee.

1126
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,193
The relationship of father and son.

1127
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:23,096
Oh this too had to happen now.

1128
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,099
You can't depend on the power supply.

1129
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:30,047
Please call up and ﬁnd
out when will they resume supply.

1130
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:31,081
Okay.

1131
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:33,083
Come let's go.

1132
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:59,201
Bhagat ji, there is no electricity
supply anywhere in the city

1133
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,172
and the phone lines
have gone dead too.

1134
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,206
ls that so?

1135
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:10,155
Bhagat ji, the army has
surrounded the Golden Temple,

1136
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,056
A curfew has been clamped

1137
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,084
And everything has
come to a standstill.

1138
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:20,065
That is most unfortunate.

1139
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:26,092
Heavily armed troops of the
Indian army stormed into the premises

1140
01:34:26,093 --> 01:34:28,161
of the historic golden temple.

1141
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:32,165
But they immediately
faced a barrage of gun ﬁre

1142
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,068
from either side of the stair case.

1143
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:38,238
The army commanders
who did manage to descend

1144
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,207
were halted by more ﬁring

1145
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:44,144
from the southern
side of the sacred pool.

1146
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:47,247
Their attempts were thwarted
and they were forced

1147
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:49,215
to retreat their steps

1148
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:54,054
The ﬁerce gun battle and
the heavy cross ﬁre that ensued

1149
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:56,160
resulted in major casualties.

1150
01:34:56,257 --> 01:35:02,037
Many militants commanders
and civilians perished.

1151
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:12,150
On seeing and hearing these
brutal conditions all around..

1152
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:16,087
..and to show my protest
against the government.

1153
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:24,153
...I have decided to
return my Padarn Shri honor..

1154
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:47,107
Bhagatji, the mistakes have
been marked on this advertisement

1155
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:48,178
How many copies have to be primed?

1156
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:53,157
All right,

1157
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,059
Print 5000 copies

1158
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:56,193
Ok Bhagat ji.

1159
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:04,100
Bhagat Ji ..Bhagam ji.. -Yes.

1160
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:07,138
This madam has come
from Delhi to interview you

1161
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,139
Greetings

1162
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,133
Greetings.sit..

1163
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:19,049
Please ask your questions

1164
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:25,155
Bhagat ii--.

1165
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:28,281
..by returning such a huge
honour bestowed by the government,

1166
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:31,092
aren't you expressing your
support for the terrorist movement?

1167
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:39,227
O madam, I only support the destitute,
the diseased and the crippled

1168
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:41,299
and will continue to do than.

1169
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:47,178
And as far as the issue
of terrorists is concerned

1170
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:52,117
my question to them is that

1171
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:57,247
where is the harvest of Sikhism?

1172
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:01,116
That they are trying
to protect with their guns.

1173
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:03,195
Then who are you supporting?

1174
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:09,134
The one who believes in
saving lives not taking them

1175
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,168
And all that is happening around?

1176
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:19,168
It is most unfonunate.very bad.

1177
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:23,269
Mistakes were committed
by the militants,

1178
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,205
mistakes were committed
by the armed forces,

1179
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,207
mistakes were committed
by those in power

1180
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:29,119
the politicians and opportunists..

1181
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,211
and who lost their lives?

1182
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,279
Who perished.

1183
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,124
The innocent and the faultless

1184
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:41,154
In the ﬁelds, in homes,

1185
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:43,260
In buses, in markets and universities

1186
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:47,205
where the blood of
the youth was shed. Why?

1187
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:52,131
But Bhagatji, Hindus are
being pulled out of homes, shops

1188
01:37:52,132 --> 01:37:55,204
buses, being singled out and killed.

1189
01:37:57,104 --> 01:38:01,280
O madam, Hindu Sikh!!

1190
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,248
O madam I was born in a Hindu family

1191
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:11,127
The values my mother inculcated
in me in my childhood.

1192
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,255
They were meant to conjoin
the religions not to separate them.

1193
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:18,259
This sapling of Sikhism
was planted in my heart

1194
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,070
by the service rendered to the poor,
the suffering

1195
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:25,166
the diseased and the
crippled and it just grew.

1196
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,180
I draw strength and take shelter
in Guru's teachings and His home.

1197
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,119
To return the honor,
was your decision,

1198
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:40,181
but what is the deepest regret
and who are you most unhappy with?

1199
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:51,159
Oh the insult inﬂicted
on the respected Golden Temple

1200
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:54,260
The violation of
its sanctity and purity

1201
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:57,140
the government is wholly
solely responsible for than.

1202
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:04,206
Madam my discontent and protest
is not directed against one person.

1203
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:08,219
It is against the ruling government.

1204
01:39:09,143 --> 01:39:13,182
Against all the politicians.

1205
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:29,699
Bhagat ji.. Ruhani used to
go to school enthusiastically.

1206
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,968
...but today she is insisting
she won't go to school.

1207
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:38,982
I won't go..no,
I won't go to school ever again

1208
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,650
Oh God bless.

1209
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:47,717
"Would never go to school".

1210
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:56,567
Let me also know why my
daughter won't go to school.

1211
01:39:56,991 --> 01:40:01,667
At school..at school
all the kids tease us that"

1212
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:06,600
..we are orphans,

1213
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:12,741
..at times they ask for mother's
name and at others father's name.

1214
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,583
a particular teacher also says than.

1215
01:40:19,646 --> 01:40:23,719
"Only orphans come to the Pingalwar

1216
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:31,634
Greetings Bhagatji

1217
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,604
Greetings madam

1218
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:41,636
Madam, this girl was
barely three days old..

1219
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:45,650
..when someone left her at
the doorstep of the Pingalwar.

1220
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:50,619
ls it this poor girl's fault?

1221
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:53,780
If child cannot be born
without a mother and a father..

1222
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:56,625
..then how can she be an orphan?

1223
01:40:57,684 --> 01:41:02,599
Those parents are bastards
who give birth and dump the child".

1224
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,600
..without giving their name

1225
01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:06,759
I apologize Bhagat
jiuactually the other kids..

1226
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,572
Madam..you are a teacher:

1227
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:13,608
It is your responsibility
and your moral duty

1228
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:17,740
to educate children and safeguard
their tender hearts from being mauled.

1229
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,677
..these destitute children
have both a mother and a father.

1230
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,653
..who is very much alive..

1231
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:29,592
Write it in your record
register permanently

1232
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,718
BHAGAT PU RAN SINGH..

1233
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:37,792
And now it means.

1234
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:42,731
for our children we will
have to open our own schools.

1235
01:41:58,612 --> 01:41:59,647
Bhagat ji you got really late"

1236
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:01,590
Pyara is very annoyed with you..

Oh my Pyara,

Greetings.

1284
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:29,725
Sir, I needed foodgrain supplies

1285
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:32,736
Take as much as you desire,
regard it as your own shop.

1286
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:35,637
That is all right sir,

1287
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:40,702
"but kindly remove this
signboard that says "NO CREDIT"

1288
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:42,668
If you ask me, the truth..

1289
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,740
...Is that you are the
reason for hanging this board

1290
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:48,718
please pay the outstanding
bill and then take supplies..

1291
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:49,844
"against cash payment.

1292
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:56,623
Bhagam Ji I rushed as
soon as I received your letter

1293
01:45:56,817 --> 01:45:58,728
why was the letter so sad?

1294
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:04,625
I was worried,
what is the reason was such sadness?

1295
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:12,800
These days I feel,
I am going to be paralyzed..

1296
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:16,714
..or a leg in an accident.

1297
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:20,719
..and die languishing on the roads

1298
01:46:21,775 --> 01:46:22,810
So that what was eating you inside,

1299
01:46:23,744 --> 01:46:25,690
Bhagam Ji,
nothing will happen to you..

1300
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:28,817
Neither paralysis nor an accident.

1301
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:34,687
Are you sure...?

1302
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:37,692
Yes I am certain,

1303
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:41,696
because even God is aware that
if something ever happens to you,

1304
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:44,639
He will have to
'serve' in your place".

1305
01:46:44,765 --> 01:46:46,711
...and God does not
have that much of time..

1306
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:49,703
For no reason.

1307
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:53,741
...a four year".

1308
01:46:56,676 --> 01:46:58,747
child has awakened inside me

1309
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:03,661
from whose hands
someone had snatched.

1310
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:05,697
.. a bowl of sweet
pudding and thrown away..

1311
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:13,727
Mother"
my mother's memories came alive".

1312
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:19,776
She used to embrace Triveni
and cry her heart out.

1313
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,683
<i>Wham happened Bhaga.</i>

1314
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:10,743
Wham happened?

1315
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:12,690
Devastation,

1316
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,717
Destruction

1317
01:49:21,788 --> 01:49:23,790
Destruction

1318
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:32,868
The earth is going bare,
the trees are rotting,

1319
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:35,805
rivers are drying,

1320
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:40,681
birds and animals are perishing,

1321
01:49:42,842 --> 01:49:46,722
the emissions from vehicles.

1322
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:50,726
..is suffocating the earth.

1323
01:49:52,886 --> 01:49:59,701
On the top the ozone layer".

1324
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:02,774
..is punctured.

1325
01:50:04,864 --> 01:50:10,678
What can the poor roof do Bhagat Ji,
it needs repairs.

1326
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,685
You mindless people, can't you see?

1327
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:19,713
You will remain sleeping,
won't you awaken even now?

1328
01:50:19,779 --> 01:50:22,692
Bhagat Ji exactly four
hours remain before we awaken

1329
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:28,791
but you will not rest,
picking the nails and bricks

1330
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:30,698
distributing pamphlets,

1331
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:35,739
Bhagat Ji, God must be
taking a day off sometimes?

1332
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:39,868
But you have no leave
assigned in your account.

1333
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:45,841
It is because I am the emperor.

1334
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:49,753
Emperongreat.

1335
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:54,850
A cauldron in hand,
bell around your neck,

1336
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:57,690
a turban on the head,
Pyara by your side,

1337
01:50:57,751 --> 01:51:01,893
you have an absolutely
royal grace, totally!

1338
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:06,693
Now that I am concerned
for the whole world,

1339
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:14,735
does it not make me
the emperor of the world?

1340
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:23,753
Lalaji, why did you refuse
to give ration to the Pingalwara?

1341
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:27,746
Lala Ji I never refused to
give ration, I refused to give credit.

1342
01:51:27,747 --> 01:51:28,748
If that is the reason Lalaji

1343
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,824
Then here are the documents
of ownership of my house, value it

1344
01:51:38,825 --> 01:51:41,704
and here take the list of supplies.

1345
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:44,708
weigh the ration and get
it delivered to the Pingalwar

1346
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:46,744
Now this is what I call good dealing,

1347
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,870
You please proceed,
the ration will follow soon

1348
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:50,710
Ok Lalaji. - Mangu..

1349
01:51:54,741 --> 01:51:59,884
Oh True God, you never feel hungry

1350
01:52:01,748 --> 01:52:03,887
But your mortals do,

1351
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:12,702
see I have handed you the control;

1352
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,808
though you can perform
countless miracles

1353
01:52:19,799 --> 01:52:22,746
Can infuse life in stone;

1354
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:25,815
Then why should I worry.

1355
01:52:27,774 --> 01:52:32,848
Then why should i worry,
what do you say Pyar.

1356
01:52:34,781 --> 01:52:40,754
Our problem is sorted,
the job is done,

1357
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,800
'Ne have got our answer".

1358
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:49,764
..in Pyara's divine smile.
I know your divine smile.

1359
01:52:51,798 --> 01:52:55,837
I am crazy to be..

1360
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:59,908
"Worrying for the ration

1361
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:01,909
You are there

1362
01:53:04,844 --> 01:53:09,520
You are the one..always with me.

1363
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:13,830
My shie
d..My suppomMy faith

1364
01:53:15,555 --> 01:53:20,868
In my childhood my mother revealed
Your presence, Your vision in all beings

1365
01:53:22,562 --> 01:53:26,533
and I continue to
see You in all beings

1366
01:53:29,903 --> 01:53:33,817
How many birds have
taken ﬂight in all directions

1367
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:37,522
time has passed unnoticed

1368
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:48,559
Mother, you won't even know that.

1369
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:50,868
..someone had left me outside
the Pingalwara door..

1370
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:54,533
"When I was three days old..

1371
01:53:56,596 --> 01:54:03,571
..and then you embraced
me like your own child,

1372
01:54:05,905 --> 01:54:09,910
You don't know your motherhood

1373
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:14,585
through your milk is now in my blood

1374
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:24,596
and now I am a college going grown up.

1375
01:54:26,626 --> 01:54:29,607
But how do I make
you understand all this,

1376
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,904
How do I make you understand, mother?

1377
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,601
Shall we play?

1378
01:54:49,649 --> 01:54:50,889
Ruhaani my daughter;

1379
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,892
She is no longer your mother

1380
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,567
Now you are her mother..

1381
01:55:03,663 --> 01:55:03,729
..and she is your daughter:

1382
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,573
..and she is your daughter:

1383
01:55:06,633 --> 01:55:10,581
Understand? Yes.. Good..live long

1384
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:19,579
Come lets go..

1385
01:55:25,952 --> 01:55:34,667
For so many incarnations
I have been separated from You, Lord

1386
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:46,548
For so many incarnations
I have been separated from You, Lord

1387
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:52,557
I dedicate this life to You.

1388
01:55:52,645 --> 01:55:58,618
I dedicate this life to You.

1389
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:03,718
Says Ravi Daas: placing
my hopes in You, I live

1390
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:10,664
It is so long since I have gazed upon
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.

1391
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:15,577
It is so long since I have gazed upon
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.

1392
01:56:40,693 --> 01:56:49,738
There is none as forlorn as I am,
and none as Compassionate as you;

1393
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:58,678
There is none as forlorn as I am,
and none as Compassionate as you;

1394
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:04,661
what need is there to test us now?

1395
01:57:04,717 --> 01:57:09,717
May my mind surrender to your word

1396
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:15,690
please bless your humble servant
with this perfection.

1397
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:21,696
I am a sacriﬁce,
a sacriﬁce to the Lord.

1398
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:31,645
O Lord, why are you silent?

1399
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:42,666
If someone were to ask me,

1400
01:57:46,759 --> 01:57:49,706
who would have thought that
when I started the Pingalwara,

1401
01:57:53,633 --> 01:57:55,579
did I expect.

1402
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:07,782
God to be so kind

1403
01:58:10,817 --> 01:58:13,661
or that such good souls
would join in to serve.

1404
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:15,596
Bhagam Ji, please keep lying down..

1405
01:58:16,622 --> 01:58:18,602
...talking will increase your pain.

1406
01:58:20,626 --> 01:58:21,730
O no..

1407
01:58:23,763 --> 01:58:25,674
Waheguru..

1408
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:32,716
with my mother's temperament

1409
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:43,584
Madam lnderjit Kaur is
here to serve the Pingalwar.

1410
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,691
God choose you to serve..

1411
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:56,673

1412
01:59:02,702 --> 01:59:03,680

1413
01:59:11,677 --> 01:59:17,684
My precious baby cradled in my lap..

1414
01:59:17,783 --> 01:59:22,783
"the moon concealed in the clouds

1415
01:59:24,657 --> 01:59:30,630
for your pure love my baby

1416
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:35,796
I would give my heart, my spirit,
everything for your pure love my baby

1417
01:59:56,722 --> 02:00:01,722
Your little arms around my neck,

1418

and I sway to the tune
of loveuakkde bakkde

1419
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:11,612
for your pure love my baby

1420
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:13,776
Many years ago Bhagat Puran Singh..

1421
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,754
"begged on roads

1422
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:21,781
He tolerated insults
disregard, disrespect and hunger.

1423
02:00:22,648 --> 02:00:25,652
He planted a Pingalwar

1424
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:28,766
And today it has become a huge tree.

1425
02:00:29,689 --> 02:00:32,057
Its shelter and branches
have spread far across

1426
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,696
Its shelter and branches
have spread far across

1427
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,706
Bhagam Ji used to say that.

1428
02:00:36,762 --> 02:00:38,673
..the suffering humanity has no caste,
no religion

1429
02:00:39,632 --> 02:00:43,774
The Pingalwara will never be
associated with politics or business

1430
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:47,708
but will forever be connected
with the suffering, the crippled,

1431
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:51,619
and the homeless

1432
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:02,533
God resides in us.

1433
02:01:03,122 --> 02:01:05,534
God resides in us.

1434
02:01:06,459 --> 02:01:10,464
may our God always smile,

1435
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:15,569
God resides in us.

1436
02:01:15,635 --> 02:01:19,447
God resides in us.

1437
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:22,610

may our God always smile,

1439
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:33,029
may our God always smile,

1440
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:44,532
For us Bhagam Puran Singh
is the epitome of our God.

1441
02:01:44,664 --> 02:01:47,645
And he has compassion
in his heart for each one of us

1442
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:54,251
For us Bhagam Puran Singh
is the epitome of our God.

1443
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:57,344
And he has compassion
in his heart for each one of us

1444
02:01:57,443 --> 02:02:04,292
Any one who feels an overwhelming
pain.. he rushes to him

1445
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:07,354
may our God always smile,

1446
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,555

Our God resides in us..may
His divine smile live forever,
