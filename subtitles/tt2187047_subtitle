1
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:37,970
Quick. Take him in.

2
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,679
You cannot go inside.
Please wait.

3
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,516
'lf we keep giving in to
the demands of our family...'

4
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,576
'...we will start
greying in our youth.'

5
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:50,053
'Both of you so easily said it.'

6
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:52,022
'But the way
the situation is at my place...'

7
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,059
'...l cannot even think
about going against my family.'

8
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,218
'Convince your families.'

9
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:56,818
'Otherwise our Pure Punjabi Band...'

10
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,023
'...will always remain
an unfulfilled dream.'

11
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:31,559
Doctor, is my son alright?

12
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,659
The patient is now
stable but unconscious.

13
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,024
You can go and meet him.

14
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,271
He has suffered a lot of
injuries on his back and his head.

15
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,273
He is in coma
because of the head injury.

16
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,843
l will only be able to say something
when he regains consciousness.

17
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,498
My son...

18
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,708
'What can we say about dreams?'

19
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:24,038
'They come when we close our eyes...'

20
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,778
'...and end when we open them.'

21
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,025
We live by our own rules.

22
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:46,571
We do as we please.

23
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,472
No one can bound us.

24
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,032
We rise like the sun.

25
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:56,946
We pay no heed to anything.

26
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:02,715
No matter what his status his.

27
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:10,787
We live by our own rules.

28
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:14,525
We do as we please.

29
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,811
We can die for our friends.

30
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,007
We live for our friends.

31
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,642
We date girls we like.

32
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:35,152
We sing fulfilled songs.

33
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,882
The place where death hovers...

34
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,255
...is the place where we go.

35
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,990
The place where our rules rule...

36
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:46,259
...is the school where we study.

37
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,060
We live by our own rules.

38
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,936
We do as we please.

39
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,214
We live by our own rules.

40
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,577
We do as we please.

41
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,155
We are not intoxicated by youth.

42
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,827
Which doesn't last forever.

43
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,427
We keep on moving forward.

44
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,837
We never lose courage.

45
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:31,501
We are not intoxicated by youth.

46
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:34,045
Which doesn't last forever.

47
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:36,638
We keep on moving forward.

48
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,115
We never lose courage.

49
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,744
We live in the present.

50
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,220
We don't worry about future.

51
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,822
We celebrate grandly.

52
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:50,692
We never fear losing.

53
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,060
We don't fear unchartered territory.

54
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,696
We don't fear danger.

55
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:02,070
We someone asks affectionately...

56
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,735
We are ready to risk our lives.

57
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,210
We are like flowers
towards our friends...

58
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:09,812
And like swords for our enemies.

59
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,407
We can mingle in the atmosphere.

60
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:15,044
We are like the colors of spring.

61
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,687
We live by our own rules.

62
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,662
We do as we please.

63
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,830
We live by our own rules.

64
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:36,238
We do as we please.

65
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,575
Come on, man.

66
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:49,619
Oh no.

67
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:51,180
What happened?

68
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:53,149
Why have you
tattooed a lion on your arm?

69
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,824
Brother, l am brave soldier's son.

70
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,451
This is what that lion represents.

71
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,518
And this gun?

72
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,493
Brother, this is an animal after all.
lt cannot be trusted.

73
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,194
You know never know what it will do.

74
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,103
Param, what does this web
tattoo on your arm represent?

75
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,663
What should l say?

76
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,207
The place where we went
to get the tattoo done...

77
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,966
He made the tattoo on his arm...

78
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,908
...and kept checking
the machine on my arm.

79
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:20,611
Oh my!

80
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:22,887
Fireworks!

81
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:24,718
Wow.

87
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:46,435
Son, don't get into trouble.

88
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:48,510
Girls talk in English these days.

89
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:54,049
Prem. Prem Chopra.

90
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,011
Let their dangerous
English go to hell.

91
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:58,717

92
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:00,790

Excuse me. Hello.

You...you...
Would you like to model for it?

102
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:24,516
Wow. My foot.

Very beautiful indeed.

104
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,908
Your foot.

105
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,551
Should l take out my sandal?

106
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:30,883
You can. You can.

107
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,886
You have to start from somewhere.

108
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,785
By the way, can l say something
if you don't mind?

109
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:38,419
Your dress is very nice.

110
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,163
What do you think about it?

111
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,030

Pinky!

115
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,767
Why do you need to call Pinky?

116
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,468
You are very pink yourself.

117
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:52,544
Pinky!

118
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:58,210

Thank You. Thank You.

130
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,670
No Entry. No Entry.

131
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,079
He thinks he is...

132
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,981
You are flirting with girls here?

133
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,609
Come on then, get
'Ready' to turn red.

134

No. No, no, no. No, brother. No.

135
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:38,750
You can ask your sister.

136
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,458
No. No. Not your sister.

137
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:43,050
Their sister.

138
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,523
Save your... Sister.

139
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:48,463
Damn you. You will be left alone.

140
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,528
Help! You...

141
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,537
When friends are here, no fear.

142
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,599
No, no, no.

143
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,541
You...

144
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:08,911
Run, Prem, run.

145
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,816
Today, your honor is at stake.

146
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:12,921
l have already lost
my honor, scoundrels.

147
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,116
Oh, God. lt hurts.

148
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,128
Don't joke.

149
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,529
l think l won't be able to
have any children.

150
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:22,690
That cannibal ruined the mood.

151
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,768
Why do you worry about the mood...

152
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,938
...when country liquor is
easily available in Manali.

153
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,269
Okay, buddy. We found
a cure for your pain.

154
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,739
That cannibal's mother...

155
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:40,850
Scoundrel, sister's Bodyguard.

156
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:45,614
lsn't 'Bodyguard'
Salman Khan's movie?

157
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:51,291
Scoundrel. He thinks
he is Salman Khan.

158
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,497
Param. Param.

159
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,796
Yes?
- What happened?

160
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,199
What are you thinking about?

161
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:04,067
Whenever l see someone working hard...

162
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,670
...l start seeing my
hard working father's face.

163
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:10,005
Yes.

164
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,008
l too feel it.

165
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:14,547
Yes.

166
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:21,153
But we...we aren't
doing anything wrong.

167
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,758
They sent us with so much confidence.

168
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,664
And we...

169
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:42,172
Look Param, l am not rich.

170
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:45,849
But to make sure your
education doesn't stop...

171
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:53,013
...l worked hard day and
night on the land that l have.

172
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:59,220
This illiterate man
didn't even realize...

173
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,892
...when started
joined a medical school.

174
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,566
Vijay, l know that you
have all the qualities...

175
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,629
...of being a good singer,
a good actor and VJ.

176
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:11,573
Let's go.

177
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:17,510
But you must have heard the saying...

178
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,979
...once bitten twice shy.

179
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,214
Raj, it is a soldier's
duty to sacrifice...

180
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,756
...each drop of his
blood for his country.

181
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:32,021
Look, son, don't worry about money.

182
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,224
Eat, drink and enjoy as you please.

183
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,966
But get a medical degree for me.

184
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:39,628
Make me proud, son.

185
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,497
l have always had a dream for you.

186
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:45,966
That my son should become a doctor.

187
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,909
Son, perhaps you don't know.

188
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:52,176
Your grandparents died
of serious illnesses.

189
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,611
There was no doctor in the village.

190
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,792
Son, now you should become a doctor...

191
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:06,126
...and turn my dream into a reality.

192
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:11,995
l spent the golden years of
my life in acting and theater.

193
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,969
But whenever a good
opportunity came up...

194
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:20,734
...they favored relatives
and the ones with references.

195
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:27,582
Duffer actors snatched the
opportunity with the help of money.

196
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:30,553
Galti (mistake). Galti.

197
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,022
You said duffer and father called.

198
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:35,119
See you, uncle. l will make a move.

199
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,057
l made a mistake.

200
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,221
See you, uncle.
- Galti.

201
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:44,025
No problem, father.
l will come and talk to you.

202
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,568
So, where was l?

203
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,469
You were talking about duffer actors.

204
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,200
Look, Vij.

205
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,641
l don't want you to
nature this desire...

206
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:58,979
...and live a life of
poverty and helplessness.

207
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:03,549
l want you to be a doctor.

208
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,916
You should become a doctor
and join BSF.

209
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,491
And treat our country's soldiers..

210
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,757
who get injured at the battlefield.

211
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,427
To serve our country
is our family history.

212
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,732
That is why l don't give
all my time to my house...

213
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,465
...but used to it to serve the nation.

214
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,869
Son, you, too, should do the same.

215
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:27,735
l can send you abroad.

216
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,004
l can start a business for you.

217
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,915
l have started factories
and made a lot of wealth...

218
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,019
...but l am still
called an illiterate.

219
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:40,157
lt hurts whenever
someone calls me illiterate.

220
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,687
Son, get rid of this label on me.

221
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:44,891
Become a doctor just once.
That is it.

222
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,465
Father, you just sign over here.

223
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,724
Sign? l will try.

224
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:52,498
Son...

225
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,806
My hands still shiver
whenever l sign.

226
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,106
l can't write a single
alphabet properly.

227
00:14:58,677 --> 00:14:59,609
l will sign.

228
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,709
Just a minute.

229
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,160
Wow. Wow.

230
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,793
Three monkeys of
their respective fathers.

231
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:27,027
Now you are acting so innocent.

232
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,975
As if you are very obedient sons.

233
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:36,475
Didn't you think about this when
instead of medical college's form...

234
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:41,550
...you got them to sign
on art college's form?

235
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:47,153
Scoundrels, you made
me miss my father.

236
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,487
You ruined my mood again.

237
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,530
l think we will have
to drink some more.

238
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:54,587
Come on. Come on.

239
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,793
Brother, stop your lectures.

240
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,103
We have to go to
college day after tomorrow.

241
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,130
l wonder what lectures
we will get to hear there.

242
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:05,073
Welcome to arts college.

243
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,670
l am Satyawadi.

244
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,208
Principal Satyawadi.

245
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:14,178
l will help you
fulfill all your dreams.

246
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,652
But let me also tell you
that teaching is my profession.

247
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,592
But spying is my hobby.

248
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,758
lt is my passion to find and
get rid of the bad habits...

249
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,827
...and lies among my students.
- What is it?

250
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,862
Look there.

251
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,036
l see better than an owl...

252
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,801
...and can smell better than a fox.

253
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:40,543
Pinky's sister is here.

254
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:41,905
Yes.
- Yes.

255
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,171
l hate lies.

256
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:45,477
Wow.

257
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,115
l worship truth.

258
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,218
Prem, what are you doing?

259
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:53,121
Today is the first day of college.
- Remember...

260
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,453
You will get us into trouble.

261
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,517
l can send each
student's character report...

262
00:16:57,028 --> 00:17:00,964
...and mark sheet to
his house if need be.

263
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:03,864
Stand up.

264
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,134
Stand up you four idiots.

265
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,730
What is happening?

266
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:11,707
Nothing.

267
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,968
What are you doing?

268
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:14,638
Listening to you, sir.

269
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,770
Then can you tell me
what l was saying?

270
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:17,711
Yes.

271
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,207
You.

272
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,108
l?

273
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,787
Sir... Sir, it is nothing.
- What nonsense.

274
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,693
Sir. Sir, he just saw 'Golmaal 3'.

275
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:35,091
Shut up.

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,867
l won't let you fool
around in this college.

277
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:43,699
By the way, it was a nice movie.

278
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,839
Johnny Liver did a good job in it.

279
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,209
But he used to keep
forgetting things.

280
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:51,942
Yes.

281
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,012
So what was l saying?

282
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,885
Forgetfulness.

283
00:17:58,022 --> 00:17:58,852
Shut up.

284
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:01,449
l have already told you..

285
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:03,956
that
l can see better than an owl...

286
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:05,655
...and can smell better than a fox.

287
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:07,796
Now you can go to your classes.

288
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:16,371
Munni embraced defamation,
darling, just for you.

289
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:20,304
Sheila got young,
darling, just for you.

290
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,509
What is the hurry, my love?

291
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:30,053
You too get a little defamed.

292
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,455
Come on.

293
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:32,849
Dance for brother.

294
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:35,684
And get rid of
all the trouble year around.

295
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,425
He thinks he is 'Shaktimaan'.

296
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,435
Shaktimaan.

297
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,898
Sorry, Shaktimaan.

298
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,930
But you are wrong.

299
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,868
We don't dance.
We make others dance.

300
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:54,138
l think you are very vigorous.

301
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,344
We are not just vigorous...

302
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:59,544
...we also know how
to calm people down.

303
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,549
Son, you have just grown up.

304
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:03,615
You should take care.

305
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,617
You might end up dead, soon.

306
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:06,753
Hey...

307
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,961
l think you have dealt
with only cold-blooded people.

308
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,362
Prem. Prem. Prem.
What are you doing?

309
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,297
This is our first day in college.
Have you gone crazy?

310
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:17,925
lt is better if you dance today...

311
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,698
...otherwise l will make you dance
all year around in such a way...

312
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:23,297
Let go. You will make me dance.

313
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:24,432
l say let go of me.

314
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:26,374
l am enough for them.

315
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,036
l am very strong.

316
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,977
l said let go of me.

317
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,911
What are you looking at down there?
Look up.

318
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:34,076
l will nail you into the ground.

319
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,853
Scoundrel. One punch and
you will break your jaw.

320
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,546
l said let go of my hand.

321
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,487
Let go of me.

322
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:40,990
l said let go of me. Don't stop me.

323
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,822
Let go of me. Let go of me.

324
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:45,386
You...

325
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:47,856
Kabir, madam is here.

326
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:56,703
Kabir, you are in the classroom?

327
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:59,666
Thank you very much for
entering the classroom.

328
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:02,571
Madam, why are you embarrassing me?

329
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,347
You know l busy l stay
in my music classes.

330
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:07,743
l know.

331
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:08,817
And they?

332
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,615
Madam, we have a band.

333
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:12,449
A band cannot survive on one person.

334
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,123
See you, madam. Goodbye.

335
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:17,017
Come on, let us go and
teach a lesson to someone.

336
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:20,731
He is in the same class
since the last four years.

337
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:22,594
l wonder what will happen of them.

338
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:24,398
Hi, students.

339
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,458
l am Kiran.

340
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,561
l mean your teacher, Kiran.

341
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,466
K...K...Kiran?

342
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:30,800
How sweet.

343
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:33,502
Yes, ma'am. You are very sweet.

344
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:35,873
Yes. Speak up, students.

345
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:37,073
Hot!
- Keep quiet.

346
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,476
Who is that?
- He's!

347
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,023
Who is it?

348
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:59,735
l am your peer. My name Potu Shah.

349
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:02,500
l mean Mastram, sir. Mastram.

350
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:03,801
Stop your nonsense.

351
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,736
Go and get all the staff
members' signatures on this register.

352
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,375
l will get the sign, sir.

353
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,537
But have you ever
asked for signs of those...

354
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,974
...who wrote this on my arm?

355
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,110
That l don't know acting.

356
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:17,719
Mastram.

357
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,353
How did you like my acting, sir?

358
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:22,158
Mastram.

359
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:25,926
Your acting was very good.
- Thank you, sir.

360
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,988
You valued a super star, sir.

361
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,057
Go. Go and get their signs.

362
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,864
Go.
- l will get them right away, 'Pa'.

363
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:45,844
Hey.

364
00:21:58,996 --> 00:21:59,724
Sorry.

365
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,798
This is a very interesting college.

366
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:02,662
True.
- Yes.

367
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,598
The teacher is
involved with the principal.

368
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:07,561
And our principal,
in order to impress her...

369
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,840
...changes his clothes
three to four times in a day.

370
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,340
Record it. Record it.

371
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,604
Look where you are going, Principal.

372
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,373
Sorry.

373
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,444
Sorry.

374
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,450
Sorry.

375
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,129
They are hitting a helpless man.

376
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,024
lf we get into trouble,
our parents will be called.

377
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,761
We will see about that later.

378
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,501
We cannot live in fear.

379
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:16,469
Didn't anyone tell you
what relationship...

380
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,040
...do l have with Meher?

381
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:22,642
lf anyone even looks at
Meher by mistake then Kabir...

382
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,890
Get your revolvers and riffles.

383
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,761
We have to take possession.

384
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:43,799
Get them.

385
00:23:58,049 --> 00:23:59,038
Sir has here.

386
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,790
Embrace me. Principal is coming.

387
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,120
l will behead you some other day.

388
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,022
Kabir, what is happening here?

389
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,422
Nothing, sir.

390
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:16,726
New students are here.
We were introducing ourselves.

391
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:17,593
Right?

392
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:18,862
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

393
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:21,934
Meet me at home once
the introduction is over.

394
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:22,665
Okay.

395
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,674
l want to talk to you
about something important.

396
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:25,671
Okay.

397
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,890
Father, l have brought milk for you.

398
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:42,790
Father?

399
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:45,488
Where are you, father?

400
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:48,961
Father.

401
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,095
What is this?

402
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,425
You scared me.

403
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:55,628
Why are you acting like
a spy wearing Kabir's clothes?

404
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:59,773
Dear, fathers have to turn
into spies when kids grow up.

405
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:02,844
Well, l can see better than an owl...

406
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:05,409
...and can smell better than a fox.

407
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,949
A mice has challenged me
and entered the cupboard.

408
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,616
l am spying it since
the last three days.

409
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:13,651
Father, you should have milk.

410
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,885
lt has right the amount of sugar
and is just as warm as l want.

411
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,996
How do you know?

412
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,427
Satyawadi can see a flying bird...

413
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:27,670
...and know from where
did she get the grain.

414
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,601
You just went to the
kitchen and checked the milk.

415
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:34,967
Father, l thought that it
might not be sweet enough.

416
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:41,008
Owl's eyesight and a fox's nose...

417
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,619
Both fail in front of Satyawadi.

418
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,926
Shit.

419
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:57,329
A father always stays a father.
And a sons always stay a son.

420
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:03,039
Whenever l form a maze,
you try to break it.

421
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,102
Other than Arjun...

422
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,110
only Abhimanyu can pass
through the maze, father.

423
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,409
But always remember, Kabir...

424
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,484
...Abhimanyu got trapped in the maze.

425
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:16,417
Enough.

426
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:18,385
Don't argue today.

427
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,516
Come on, go to your rooms.

428
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,323
l am going to sleep.

429
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:27,088
Me too.

430
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:34,628
And l too will go and
take a round of the hostel.

431
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:40,808
Perhaps, someone's some
mistake is waiting for me.

432
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,591
Her waist measures 28 inches.

433
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:06,829
She weighs 47 kilos.

434
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:09,101
Girl, you should agree quickly.

435
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:10,634
Don't delay it.

436
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,771
Whether or not you know this,
but l hate love stories.

437
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,377
How do l say how much l love you.

438
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:17,974
Move aside, season three.

439
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,013
lf your feelings stay
hidden in your heart...

440
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:23,716
...then moving on...
My heart is crazy.

441
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:26,047
And the one who loves
shall take the girl away.

442
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:27,090
Keep quiet.

443
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:30,589
Before l am in love becomes
Why did l fall in love?...

444
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,058
...darling, you
should try to understand.

445
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:33,756
Why should you feel
scared when you are in love.

446
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:35,731
Hey, girl. Don't pay heed to them.

447
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,967
Once upon a time in Jalandhar...

448
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:40,069
Love, sex and deceit.

449
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:44,465
Come on, boys.

450
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:47,001
Let us go and...
- Propose.

451
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,378
Fill your heart with
love and spread your arms.

452
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:03,623
Dear, here l am, in front of you,
say something with your eyes.

453
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:09,022
Fill your heart with
love and spread your arms.

454
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:12,091
Dear, here l am, in front of you,
say something with your eyes.

455
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:17,399
Beautiful, we hold a beautiful
rose in our beautiful hands, and...

456
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:21,436
We propose to you.

457
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:24,538
We propose to you.

458
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:27,376
We propose to you.

459
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,818
We propose to you.

460
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:35,082
We propose to you.

461
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:38,454
We propose to you.

462
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,359
We propose to you.

463
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:44,492
We propose to you.

464
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:03,082
Your eye deceit us.

465
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,289
Each style of yours is liked by us.

466
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,326
We worship the path you take.

467
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:12,691
Whether you stand,
walk or turn at the corner.

468
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:16,723
We like every pose
of yours, beautiful.

469
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,030
We...

470
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:22,695
We propose to you.

471
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:25,833
We propose to you.

472
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,772
We propose to you.

473
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:32,109
We propose to you.

474
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,653
We propose to you.

475
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,746
We propose to you.

476
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,684
We propose to you.

477
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,923
We propose to you.

478
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:57,403
Pushpa, why can't l see anything?

479
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:02,069
Relations, love,
faithfulness are meaningless.

480
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,079
Why should we bother about them?

481
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:05,410
lt is all a lie.

482
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:14,389
Sir is here.

483
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:23,533
l had said a few things to
you on the very first day.

484
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:27,364
That Satyawadi can see
better than an owl...

485
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:29,872
...and can smell better than a fox.

486
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,643
l can still smell alcohol on you.

487
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,674
Honestly, sir.
l have a lot of fun last night.

488
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,882
Friends gave me to drink.
l couldn't come back.

489
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,711
l really enjoyed it, sir. A lot.

490
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:44,151
Wow. That is great.

491
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:45,720
You enjoyed.

492
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,615
Very good. Very good.

493
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,050
And son, where were you?

494
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:53,190
l am asking you, Krishan.

495
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:54,822
Where were you?

496
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,735
Sir, l, too, enjoyed a lot with him.

497
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:00,860
No, sir. He is trying to save me.

498
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,497
He doesn't drink, sir.

499
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,072
A senior citizen hadean road accident.

500
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:08,342
He was with him in the hospital,
all night long, sir.

501
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,771
Okay.

502
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,039
He is lying.

503
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,045
He is lying to Satyawadi.

504
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:18,715
l suspends you for seven days.

505
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:25,523
Pay a fine of Rs. 700 for non
presence on the seventh day.

506
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,432
Or else, l can even expel you.

507
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,562
Waive off his fine, sir.
- Come here.

508
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:33,792
Give me Rs. 700.

509
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:37,464
Hurry up.

510
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:48,951
Son, l am not expelling you
because you told the truth.

511
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:52,779
But as you drank alcohol,
you will pay his fine.

512
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:55,315
Kids, at our principal's behest...

513
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:59,322
...Master Salim is being
a guest lecturer for you.

514
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,390
Do you know who is coming with him?

515
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,360
Music director of this generation.
Mr. Gulmohar.

516
00:32:04,934 --> 00:32:08,563
He will share his life
experiences with you.

517
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:11,670
So, come on, let us welcome,
Master Salim.

518
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:16,106
How are you, Students?

519
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,237
Fine.

520
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:19,572
Mr. Salim, l am a big fan of yours.

521
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:21,173
l'm a table fan of yours.

522
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,445
Sir, we want to
progress in rock music.

523
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:28,052
Tell us, what should we do for it.

524
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:30,991
First of all, you need to have
knowledge about classical music.

525
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:32,493
All the music in the world.

526
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:36,020
All the music made in the world
has its base in classical.

527
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:39,166
Mr. Salim, how do you sing
so well and melodiously?

528
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:42,204
l just sing. You know
better if it is melodious.

529
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:45,205
My father Ustaad Puran Shah Koti...

530
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:49,342
...always say that Ustaad
Bade Gulam Ali Shah has said...

531
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,307
...that you need to be
strong to sing in tune.

532
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,117
Mr. Salim, l want to make a request.

533
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,517
Your song, 'Mera Pir
Jane Meri Peer'...

534
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,088
...is my favorite song.
Will you sing that for us, please?

535
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:03,148
Sure, Mr. Singh.
Whatever you say.

536
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:05,256
l will surely sing it.

537
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:12,391
How do l make you read
what hides in my eyes?

538
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:17,196
How do l show you what
is write on my heart?

539
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:22,203
How do l make you read
what hides in my eyes?

540
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:27,214
How do l show you what
is write on my heart?

541
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,944
What thoughts occupy
my mind these days.

542
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,747
l often question my heart.

543
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:34,218
What makes me love her?

544
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,554
What make me follow her?

545
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:40,560
l cannot find the cause.

546
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,323
Only my Lord knows how l feel.

547
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:45,627
She is unaware.

548
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:47,993
Sir, autograph.
- Thanks.

549
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:50,165
Ok, bye God bless you.

00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,199
Whose is it?

551
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:55,433

552
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:57,344
lt is my father's call.
l will go and answer it.

553
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:59,677
You always think the opposite.
- What wrong did l think?

554
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:02,076
That is how their brains work.
- Come on, hurry up.

555
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:03,080
Come on.

556
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,619

564
00:34:22,338 --> 00:34:23,930
You should hurry up, father.

565
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:29,702
Actually, son, your
mother was a little unwell.

566
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:31,640
That is why it got delayed.

567
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,306
Mother? What happened to her?

568
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:35,612
How did she fall sick?
Make me talk to her.

569
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:36,610
Sure.

570
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:39,286
Savita. Get up.

00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,182
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

572
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:47,595
Don't worry, son.

573
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:50,456
My stupid age is such.

574
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,162
l keep getting fever off and on.

575
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:56,962
Mother, you shouldn't worry much.

576
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,465
You know how much l worry about you.

577
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:01,933
Son, stop worrying about me.

578
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:04,311
Concentrate on your studies.

Okay?

Okay, mother. Bye.

l think he is worried
about tomorrow's exam.

584
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,100
Keep a watch outside.

585
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,727
Father always take
a round at this hour.

586
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:31,997
Okay. Okay.
l can't see anyone outside.

588

This time l will also get

Hurry up. - Father says
l should be a judge.

591
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:45,017
Boy has been to
prison a number of times.

592
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:54,485
Son, for what crimes
are you punishing me?

593
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,534
lf anyone in college finds
out that Satyawadi's son...

594
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:04,699
...is not just
good-for-nothing but also a thief...

595
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:08,237
Oh, God.

596
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,282
Hello.

597
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:18,518
How are your studies going on?

598
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:19,450
Yes. Yes.

599
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,283
My studies are going on just fine.

600
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,181
Tomorrow is my first exam.

601
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:27,055
Son, there is electricity
only for four hours here.

602
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:31,133
Good that you went
to the city to study.

603
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,431
Son, when you return as a doctor...

604
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:35,661
...l will get a generator installed.

605
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:39,335
And then l do farming heart's content.

606
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:40,406
Yes, father.

607
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,170
l will make sure
that such a day comes. Don't worry.

608
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:46,140
You don't look good worrying.

609
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:49,751
Son, when you will
come home as a doctor...

610
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:55,179
...my worry lines will turn
into the lines of good fortune.

611
00:36:55,558 --> 00:37:00,257
And people will say, Thayal Singh
is the father of a doctor.

612
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:03,365
Yes, son.

613
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,901
You should
concentrate on your studies.

614
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:11,501
Your mother is saying don't just
concentrate on your studies...

615
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:14,507
...pay attention
towards your health as well.

616
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,140
After all only are our only son.

617
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,680
She is worried about you.

618
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:22,645
Bye, son.

619
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:24,976
Bless you. Enjoy.

620
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:27,219
See you, son.

621
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,020
Param.

622
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,051
What happened, buddy?

623
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:32,453
Who was on the line?

624
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:34,454
You are crying?

625
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:36,960
Param? What happened?

626
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,031
Chill, man.

627
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:40,728
l hope everything is
fine at your place.

628
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:42,434
Everything is fine at home.

629
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:45,936
But what l am doing with
my family is not right.

630
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:49,600
l could hear
helplessness in my father's voice.

631
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:55,112
l couldn't tolerate it.
We have a small piece of land.

632
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,152
And to top that there is
shortage of electricity and water.

633
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,887
Still, l don't how he is paying
for my education through a loan.

634
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:03,483
And l am lying to him.

635
00:38:06,996 --> 00:38:10,090
Param, you cry at the drop of a hat.

636
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:11,458
Be a little strong.

637
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,594
Param, the day our dream,
our Pure Punjabi Band...

638
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,668
...will rule the world, all
our dreams will come true.

639
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:23,645
And dude, then our
parents will feel proud of us.

640
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,345
Come here. ldiot.

641
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:27,973
Listen to me, stupid.

642
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:30,315
We are Pure Punjabis.

643
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:34,954
And we know how to reach our
destination through hard work.

644
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:36,222
Got it?

645
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,083
Come on, come here.

646
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:40,993
Oh, God.

647
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:42,425
You are under your mother's oath.

648
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:44,227
Please let me fair well in the exams.

649
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:48,093
Oh, Goddess.
Please let me fair well in the exams.

650
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,965
l will fast for seven Mondays.

651
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,639
All those students who
haven't paid their fees...

652
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,172
...should pay it by tomorrow.

653
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:55,676
Tomorrow it the last date.
Okay?

654
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:57,210
All the best.

655
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,284
Kabir, the paper is different.

656
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:05,320
l don't know.
l had taken out the right paper.

657
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,146
How did this happen?

658
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:13,653
Son...

659
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:17,295
A father will always be a father
and a son will always be a son.

660
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:34,606
Yes?

661
00:39:35,484 --> 00:39:37,008
He was acting smart, wasn't he?

662
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:39,011
l will teach him a lesson, today.

663
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:44,155
Chit.

664
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,161
Chit.

665
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,623
Don't worry, son.
Let me handle father first.

666
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:58,435
Everything is under control?
- Yes, sir.

667
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:01,005
Everything is under control.

668
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:03,568
l think you are not.

669
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,504
Mr. Sukhpal.

670
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:06,612
Mr. Amit.

671
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:07,641
Come here.

672
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:09,275
Frisk Kabir.

673
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:10,982
Stand up.

674
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:21,761
No, sir. l didn't find anything.

675
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:23,396
No, sir. l didn't find anything.

676
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:26,430
Okay.

677
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,470
lf a father will always be a father...

678
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:37,111
...then the son is also like him.

679
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:42,215
There he is.

680
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:43,181
Vijay.

681
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:49,183
Get up, Param.

682
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,352
Why don't you get up?

683
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:54,391
Why are you testing us?

684
00:40:56,031 --> 00:40:56,963
You know...

685
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:59,663
You know that
we cannot stay without you.

686
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,103
Buddy, you were only one...

687
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:07,605
...whose weird talks used to give
us courage during troubled times.

688
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:10,610
Have patience.

689
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:13,341
The patient is recovering
at a great speed.

690
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,349
His condition is
quite stable than before.

691
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,455
Oh, God.

692
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,551
Thank You very much.

693
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:36,395
Buddy, your song still
provides us a lot of courage.

694
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,698
You remember...

695
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:41,442
...when l had lost
courage and was going home?

696
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,274
Yes?

697
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:49,217
Where are you going all dressed up?

698
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:51,046
Why are you alone?

699
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,184
Buddy, where are you going, alone?

700
00:41:55,424 --> 00:41:56,254
No where.

701
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:58,688
l was just going out for a stroll.

702
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,460
Which aunt are you going to meet?

703
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,460
Wherever you are going, take us along.

704
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:04,260
No where. l was just
going out for a stroll.

705
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,198
What did you think?
That you will just leave?

706
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:08,593
And we will think that you
have just gone out for a stroll?

707
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,704
You think we are stupid?

708
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:15,944
Buddy, we together
in joys and sorrows.

709
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:17,143
Pure Punjabi.

710
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:18,641
We are not poseurs.

711
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:21,142
When we can have fun together...

712
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,013
...then we can share
our sorrows as well.

713
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:26,147
What problem is our friend facing?

714
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:28,351
You are leaving without telling us?

715
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,615
Father called.

716
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:35,562
He said that he couldn't
arrange for the fees.

717
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:38,256
He will, soon.

718
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,499
Then what is the problem?

719
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,739
l know he will take a loan.

720
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:47,436
That too at a high rate of interest.

721
00:42:48,377 --> 00:42:50,572
Only for a dream to make me a doctor.

722
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:52,707
Which is not even true.

723
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:56,946
That loan will became
like a backache to him.

724
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:03,184
And l will feel guilty thinking
about the loan, all my life.

725
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:04,585
l will feel guilty.

726
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:10,260
Vijay, don't you trust
yourself and your talent?

727
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:12,533
l do. l trust it.

728
00:43:14,536 --> 00:43:16,936
But when the time and the
condition are not right...

729
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,506
...you don't get the money, right?

730
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:25,312
Look at him. Our foolish friend.

731
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,608
Come on, first arrange for his fees.
- Yes.

732
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:34,746
Give it to me.

733
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,284
We have managed to
get half the amount.

734
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,420
And we will test our band
for the rest of the money.

735
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:56,136
We had a blast everyday.

736
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:58,938
We lived our youth everyday.

737
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,607
We did antics everyday.

738
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,981
Everyday a new prank.

739
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:06,417
We went on rides together.

740
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,122
We threatened many.

741
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:12,488
Don't open the knot.

742
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,423
Don't open it.

743
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:18,090
We are stringed together.

744
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:22,595
Buddy, please don't wobble.

745
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,333
Buddy, please don't wobble.

746
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:28,501
We are standing with you.

747
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:33,307
Buddy, please don't wobble.

748
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:36,078
Buddy, please don't wobble.

749
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,520
We are standing with you.

750
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:57,404
We don't wish to break and scatter.

751
00:44:58,373 --> 00:45:03,470
We don't want to part with you.

752
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:08,014
We don't wish to break and scatter.

753
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:13,351
We don't want to part with you.

754
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:20,090
Buddy, we don't want to cry
thinking of you everyday.

755
00:45:20,729 --> 00:45:25,063
Don't waste your life.

756
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,928
Don't waste it.

757
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:32,029
You have a lot of admirers.

758
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:35,037
Buddy, please don't wobble.

759
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,601
Buddy, please don't wobble.

760
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,638
We are standing with you.

761
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:59,930
l have torn jeans of yours with me.

762
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:05,167
Your old shoes are precious to me.

763
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,704
l have to return your Ray Ban.

764
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:10,343
l have promised to return them.

765
00:46:10,612 --> 00:46:14,548
l have to take Rs. 500 from you.

766
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:18,518
You have always given
excuses not to pay up.

767
00:46:20,522 --> 00:46:25,926
Don't forget this.

768
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:30,158
We have a good memory.

769
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:33,963
Buddy, please don't wobble.

770
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:36,527
Buddy, please don't wobble.

771
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:39,631
We are standing with you.

772
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:01,324
l heard their song.

773
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:03,662
They have good control.

774
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:08,027
One cannot fly just
by dreaming about it.

775
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:10,703
You need wings to fly.

776
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:15,204
And if anyone tries to fly in
the sky that belongs to Kabir...

777
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,009
...then he will produce
so much heat in the sky...

778
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:21,172
...that their dream
will turn to ashes.

779
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:27,955
Black clouds and lightening
look good only for a while.

780
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:32,393
Whenever such lightening
has fallen close to Kabir...

781
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:36,058
...they ended up being
tunes of Kabir's guitar.

782
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:48,309
Which country's satellite
signal are you trying to catch?

783
00:47:51,113 --> 00:47:53,980
Scoundrel, l am
trying to write a song...

784
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,881
...which will set
the life of our band.

785
00:47:58,153 --> 00:48:00,280
Did something come out?
l mean did you write something?

786
00:48:00,455 --> 00:48:02,480
Nothing is coming in my mind.

787
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:05,587
Your Highness, why are
you troubling your mind?

788
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:07,287
Let us trouble ours.

789
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,261
Param, do one thing.

790
00:48:10,899 --> 00:48:12,332
Try thinking on your feet.
- Yes.

791
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:14,401
Yes.
- On your feet. Come on.

792
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,002
Get on this table. Come on.

793
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:16,901
Come here.

794
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:18,631
You...you will get great ideas.

795
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:21,406
Give me that.
- Here you go.

796
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:22,374
Give a pen.

797
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:23,502
Try your best.

798
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,475
Param, did you come up with anything?

799
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,510
No.

800
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,219
Param...

801
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:37,992
Should l get water?

802
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:41,995
Uncle, if you sit
like this for long...

803
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:44,965
...then if not songs,
something else will surely come out.

804
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:47,161
Shut up. You scoundrels.

805
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:49,328
Sorry. Sorry.
- l will play the drums now.

806
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:51,970
Sorry.

807
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:53,536
Make fun of me as much as you want.

808
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:55,303
One day our band Pure Punjabi...

809
00:48:55,377 --> 00:48:57,402
...will become
famous because of my song.

810
00:48:57,913 --> 00:49:00,143
Let go of it. - Then you will
say our friend has written it.

811
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:01,375
Scoundrel.
- Let go.

812
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:24,068
Music won't stop.

813
00:49:24,138 --> 00:49:25,969
Drinking won't stop either.

814
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,337
The world might not care.

815
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:29,338
But our lights will
remain switched on.

816
00:49:32,346 --> 00:49:34,041
Music won't stop.

817
00:49:34,115 --> 00:49:35,844
Drinking won't stop either.

818
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:37,213
The world might not care.

819
00:49:37,284 --> 00:49:39,013
But our lights will
remain switched on.

820
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:40,586
We are young birds.

821
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:42,347
We enjoy our lives.

822
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:47,084
Our CD always plays in the disco.

823
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:50,728
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

824
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:53,790
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

825
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:57,162
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

826
00:50:10,317 --> 00:50:12,114
Boys from Punjab are with me.

827
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:13,676
They sing well. They are great.

828
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:15,619
Look how nice l look in a turban.

829
00:50:23,664 --> 00:50:25,188
Not eleven.
Not twelve.

830
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:26,961
l am 18.

831
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:30,128
God helps hearts unite.

832
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,433
Not eleven.
Not twelve.

833
00:50:35,676 --> 00:50:36,836
l am 18.

834
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:39,937
God helps hearts unite.

835
00:50:40,014 --> 00:50:41,811
Youth is beautiful.

836
00:50:41,882 --> 00:50:43,372
They it will go away.

837
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:48,184
This generation is
getting romantic...

838
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:50,587
...drinking the nectar of love.

839
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:56,590
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

840
00:50:56,664 --> 00:50:59,724
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

841
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:03,030
Our party won't end.
lt will go on 24/7.

842
00:51:22,356 --> 00:51:23,186
Keep quiet.

843
00:51:23,724 --> 00:51:24,418
Pammi Bai.

844
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:27,386
Excuse me.

845
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:28,750
Hello.

846
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:37,168
You look better when you smile.

847
00:51:38,772 --> 00:51:39,431
As you wish.

848
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:41,368
You don't look less
beautiful when angry.

849
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:43,410
You were looking like
the 8th wonder last night.

850
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:44,803
What do you mean?

851
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:47,073
l mean the 8th wonder.

852
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:49,609
You attended our party.

853
00:51:49,683 --> 00:51:51,241
l thought l should thank you.

854
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,846
By the way, you were looking
more beautiful than necessary.

855
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:55,684
Why?
Am l not looking beautiful now?

856
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,249
Mister, how dare you say such a thing.

857
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,992
l was just...
You took it seriously.

858
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:03,823
l didn't mean that.

859
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:06,230
Then what was it?
What do you want to say?

860
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:08,792
l want to have coffee with you.

861
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:09,901
Why?

862
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,332
Why do you want to do so?

863
00:52:11,705 --> 00:52:12,694
Just like that.

864
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:14,097
Just for company.

865
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:16,036
Do you feel scared alone?

866
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,009
Are you a kid?

867
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,271
No. l am not a kid.

868
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:24,613
But l feel like behaving
like a kid when l see you.

869
00:52:26,053 --> 00:52:28,317
Look, mister, you are
new to this college.

870
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:32,256
lt is better for you if you stay away.

871
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:37,225
lf my brother sees
you offering coffee...

872
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:40,926
...he will make you start
hating coffee, for life.

873
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:52,577
You will slowly fall in love, fool.

874
00:52:56,016 --> 00:52:57,005
Superman?

875
00:52:58,352 --> 00:52:59,216
Ms. Meher.

876
00:53:00,654 --> 00:53:01,313
Yes?

877
00:53:02,756 --> 00:53:06,214
l want to talk about
some personal matter.

878
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:11,765
Then why did you have
to dress up like this?

879
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:14,323
The topic is such that...

880
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:17,796
That you have to
part your hair and come?

881
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:24,911
Look, mister...
What did you say your name was?

882
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:27,880
Well...l still haven't
told you my name.

883
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:28,673
Why?

884
00:53:28,749 --> 00:53:30,182
ls it something to feel shy about?

885
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,343
That you are so shy to tell me?

886
00:53:33,053 --> 00:53:33,712
Raj.

887
00:53:34,054 --> 00:53:35,146
Wow!

888
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:37,051
ls there a secret?

889
00:53:37,124 --> 00:53:37,920
No.

890
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:41,094
My name is Raj.

891
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:42,321
You must have heard the name before.

892
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:43,886
What do you want to talk about?

893
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:47,099
What l want to talk about?
- Yes. What?

894
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:49,632
l think you came
here to say something.

895
00:53:50,337 --> 00:53:52,202
Personal!

896
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:54,040
Actually l want to...

897
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,834
l want to have coffee.

898
00:53:58,178 --> 00:53:59,736
You get coffee in the canteen.

899
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:00,745
Not here.

900
00:54:00,814 --> 00:54:03,783
You are not available in the canteen.

901
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,210
Do l look like Karan Johar?

902
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:10,215
That every one wants to
have 'Coffee with Meher'?

903
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,257
No.

904
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,852
May God never turn your
beautiful face into Karan Johar's.

905
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:20,290
You should get his habits, at all.
- Shut up.

906
00:54:22,403 --> 00:54:24,064
What have you done, girl.

907
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:27,000
You have turned me from Shah
Rukh Khan to Meher Mittal.

908
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:37,672
Meher, l think another coffee
invitation is walking towards you.

909
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:39,810
l think he is one of those guys.

910
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:43,387
Hi, l am Vijay.

911
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,416
So?

913
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,721
l was thinking that
l shouldn't have it alone.

914
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:54,066
You want to have coffee?

915
00:54:55,035 --> 00:54:56,366
Then what are you doing here?

916
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:57,900
This isn't a Coffee House.

917
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:01,938
Anyway, you are not alone.

918
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:04,702
You are wearing two-colored shoes.

919
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:06,211
You are wearing headphones.

920
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,805
There is radio in you mobile.
There are RJs.

921
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:11,043
And you are Vijay.

922
00:55:12,252 --> 00:55:14,311
You are not alone. - No.

923
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:19,724
l wanted to enjoy coffee
with a special personality.

924
00:55:19,993 --> 00:55:22,052
l wanted to enjoy coffee
with a special personality.

925
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:24,791
So, kiddo. How are you?

926
00:55:25,232 --> 00:55:27,359
You seem busy with the girls, today.

927
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,764
l...
- Brother, he is new to this college.

928
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:32,965
He wanted coffee.

929
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,098
Canteen was closed.

930
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:36,039
So, he was asking
where could he get it.

931
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,304
That is all?
- Yes.

932
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:40,904
Come, new birdie. Let
me teach you how to fly.

933
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:42,782
l will make you drink such a coffee...

934
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,215
...that you will never forget it.

935
00:55:44,284 --> 00:55:45,717
Come with me.

936
00:55:46,186 --> 00:55:47,915
Come, l will treat
you with a cappuccino.

937
00:55:47,988 --> 00:55:49,979
He...he...

938
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:54,083
He took me to a roadside
restaurant where truckers come.

939
00:55:55,095 --> 00:55:58,064
Over there the drivers...

940
00:55:58,132 --> 00:56:00,760
What? Disgusting.

941
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:06,036
You guys have a dirty mind.

942
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:10,071
Over there, at the restaurant...

943
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:17,874
Make one cup of tea.

944
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:20,280
He should forget coffee.

945
00:56:20,654 --> 00:56:21,712
Give it to him.

946
00:56:31,198 --> 00:56:32,688
The tea was so bitter...

947
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,599
The tea was so bitter...

948
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:36,664
My head is still spinning.

949
00:56:39,273 --> 00:56:40,638
Keep it down.

950
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:42,267
You...

951
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:45,073
Hey!

952
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:46,703
Hey, where are you going?

953
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,247
You got scared of the girl?

954
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:49,673
Let go of me.

Let go of me.

956
00:56:51,819 --> 00:56:53,582
l cannot go to that wild cat.

957
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,086
So, buddy, now you got it.

958
00:56:56,857 --> 00:56:58,620
Four of us going for the same girl.

959
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:03,558
Come on, son, you too try your luck.

960
00:57:03,764 --> 00:57:05,231
He thinks he is Pink Panther.

961
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,566
Uncle, you are looking
like a Pink Panther.

962
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:08,927
At least lift him up.

963
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:09,967

969
00:57:16,877 --> 00:57:17,775

970
00:57:18,278 --> 00:57:19,643
No. - Oh no. She is here.
Let's go. Let's go.

971
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:21,578
She is here.
- Come on. Come on, hide.

972
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,583
Coffee?

973
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,945
You want to have coffee with me.

974
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:30,857
No.

975
00:57:30,924 --> 00:57:33,825
l am a simple boy
who has milk and buttermilk.

976
00:57:34,328 --> 00:57:35,386
What do you mean?

977
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:37,293
You mean l am not simple?

978
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,359
No. You are.

979
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,635

980
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:43,633

And you drink buttermilk.

982
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,934
Buttermilk?

What can go wrong with my health?

988
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:02,987
City boys like tea and coffee.

989
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:04,588
No problem.

990
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,827
Now that you are in the city
you should change your taste.

991
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:10,589
And then, buttermilk
doesn't suit all occasions.

992
00:58:11,665 --> 00:58:14,031
Mister...
- Paramjeet Singh.

993
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,792
You can call me Param.

994
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:17,996
So, Mr. Param...

Let's go for coffee.

996
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:21,803

Lucky. Lucky. Lucky.

1002
00:58:35,355 --> 00:58:37,755
Our drummer went to
have coffee yesterday.

1003
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:39,151
He isn't back as yet.

1004
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:41,394
Forget it. Look there.
- Show me.

1005
00:58:42,095 --> 00:58:43,062
Look at her waist.

1006
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,392
Look at her waist.

1007
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,892
She has a nose like your father's.
She must be your sister.

1008
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,696
Why do you always
say such dirty things?

1009
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:49,767
You are back?

1010
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:51,761
Had your coffee?

1011
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:53,964
You won't get a chance to
get it out of your system.

1012
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:55,133
lt is not so.

1013
00:58:56,143 --> 00:58:57,804
She read all my songs.

1014
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:00,269
She has become a good friend of mine.

1015
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:08,151
Okay, our today's canteen
bill has been taken care of.

1016
00:59:08,288 --> 00:59:10,654
Why? Did you father send
the money early today?

1017
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:13,123
What do you mean?
- You ask a lot of meanings.

1018
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,625
Bring your ears closer.
- You too come closer.

1019
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:20,760
Come on, let's fool him.

1020
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,165
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1021
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,108
May His Highness
achieve great heights.

1022
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:30,676
Damn you.

1023
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:32,302
May destiny always favor him.

1024
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,046
Your aunt is jealous.

1025
00:59:34,147 --> 00:59:36,638
May he always hold his head high.

1026
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,183
Your uncle will fall ill.

1027
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:41,152
May your kingdom stay intact.

1028
00:59:41,355 --> 00:59:43,186
Don't hit me. Kids are watching.

1029
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:47,284

Okay, dude, give me some money then.

01:00:01,842 --> 01:00:03,104
You idiot. You will ruin it.

What happened to the Comedy Circus?

01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:29,727
So that l cannot neither
move my hand nor use the pen.

1067
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,727
You always say the wrong thing.

1068
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:34,299
Param, what is this?

1069
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:37,895
This mug has the other

Hey, he is busy over here.

1071

01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,693
So, to be my buddy
repeat this three times.

1081
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:11,870
l accept...
- l accept... - You...

1082
01:02:11,938 --> 01:02:12,802
Calm down.

1083
01:02:12,873 --> 01:02:14,204
l accept...
- l accept...

1084
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:16,171
l accept...
- l accept...

1085
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:18,905
So Ms. Meher, now you
are my friend for life.

1086
01:02:19,312 --> 01:02:21,712
Now l will recite
a poem for my new friend.

1087
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:25,708
Beautiful face, pink lips.

1088
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,117
They make me restless.

1089
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,754
They make me intoxicated.

1090
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,355
Wonderful.
- Wonderful.

1091
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:32,785
Wonderful, sir. Wonderful.
- Wonderful.

1092
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:34,326
Did you hear our friend's poem?

1093
01:02:34,761 --> 01:02:36,729
lt goes straight to the heart.

1094
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,392
Why are you telling me?

1095
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:39,428
Did l ask you?

1096
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,729
Ms. Meher, what is
a friend's friend called?

1097
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:45,628
Simple. A friend.

1098
01:02:45,672 --> 01:02:46,969
So, hence proved.

1099
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,802
According to the theorem,
l am also your friend.

1100
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,866
Here you go then.
Ms. Meher, let's shake hands.

1101
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:52,941
Prem.

1102
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:58,143
My name is Prem.

1103
01:02:58,251 --> 01:02:59,183
Meher.

1104
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:00,675
My name is Meher.

1105
01:03:00,754 --> 01:03:04,918
Whatever l touch creates music.

1106
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:06,318
Really?

1107
01:03:06,726 --> 01:03:09,661
Tunes reside in my breath.

1108
01:03:09,863 --> 01:03:10,693
Really?

1109
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:12,325
Music is in my soul.

1110
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:15,926
And l am made up of tunes.

1111
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:17,700
Really?

1112
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:19,168
What l say becomes a song.

1113
01:03:20,073 --> 01:03:21,597
And whenever l open my eyes...

1114
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,942
l don't know about your eyes...

1115
01:03:24,244 --> 01:03:27,407
...but if you keep
crushing my hand...

1116
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:29,308
...then l will surely yell.

1117
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:44,289
You didn't see this.

1118
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:46,188
Did you see?

1119
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:53,773
Give me my cup.

1120
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:57,841
My cup!

1121
01:04:03,149 --> 01:04:05,174
His condition is much better.

1122
01:04:05,685 --> 01:04:08,017
l think we don't need to
keep him in the lCU any longer.

1123
01:04:08,255 --> 01:04:10,348
We will soon shift
him to another ward.

1124
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:13,954
Param.

1125
01:04:15,662 --> 01:04:16,321
Param.

1126
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:22,763
Param.

1127
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:24,863
Param, look...

1128
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:26,201
Param.

1129
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:27,968
Open your eyes and look.

1130
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,140
Meher is here to see you.

1131
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,102
Param, open your eyes.

1132
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:37,239
Look...look, Param,
Meher is here to see you.

1133
01:04:37,817 --> 01:04:38,977
Param, open your eyes.

1134
01:04:39,185 --> 01:04:41,312
Param. Param.

1135
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,618
Oh no.

1136
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:50,660
Param. Param. Look what is happening.

1137
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:58,303
Fearing you...fearing you my
eyes started peeing, Param.

1138
01:04:59,172 --> 01:04:59,934
Param.

1139
01:05:01,308 --> 01:05:02,297
Get up, Param.

1140
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:03,808
Get up, Param.

1141
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:14,778
Everyday in my college...

1142
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:17,282
l don't know why.

1143
01:05:18,725 --> 01:05:21,853
l wish if once she send me...

1144
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:23,926
Send me hi.

1145
01:05:24,297 --> 01:05:25,696
Send me hi.

1146
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,861
But she doesn't even look at me.

1147
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:31,703
l think she is shy.

1148
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,265
l wish if once she send me...

1149
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,004
Send me hi.

1150
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,077
Every time l sleep on my bed.

1151
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:47,775
l find my angel in my dreams alive.

1152
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:49,787
But then l wake up in the morning...

1153
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:50,982
Then l think.

1154
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,124
That was that a dream
or was she really there.

1155
01:05:55,295 --> 01:06:02,064
Damsel, your love has made me crazy.

1156
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:08,330
l feel l don't belong
to this world anymore.

1157
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:11,669
ls this love?

1158
01:06:11,978 --> 01:06:15,106
What is this love?

1159
01:06:15,582 --> 01:06:22,579
Come and have a look at my state.

1160
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,991
Every time l sleep on my bed.

1161
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:30,359
l find my angel in my dreams alive.

1162
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:34,063
Then l wake up in the
morning and think...

1163
01:06:34,134 --> 01:06:37,365
Was that a dream or
was she really there.

1164
01:06:38,104 --> 01:06:39,935
Because she is my angel.

1165
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:51,779
Handsome, your love
has made me crazy.

1166
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:57,957
l feel l don't belong
to this world anymore.

1167
01:06:58,024 --> 01:07:01,118
ls this love?

1168
01:07:01,594 --> 01:07:04,927
Yes, this is love.

1169
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:12,267
l am in the same state you are in.

1170
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,138
Scoundrels.

1171
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:18,233
l had just reached closer to Meher.

1172
01:07:18,912 --> 01:07:20,140
You pulled the ladder.

1173
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:26,078
l was romancing with Meher.

1174
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,719
Prem, don't fly too high.

1175
01:07:28,922 --> 01:07:31,755
The higher you fly
the more hurt you will be someday.

1176
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:32,917
Yes, uncle.

1177
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:35,218
Grapes are sour.

1178
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,354
lt is not about that, Prem.

1179
01:07:37,597 --> 01:07:39,292
We are getting calls
from our families.

1180
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,634
And what are we doing
for our band Pure Punjabis.

1181
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:42,825
Nothing at all.

1182
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:45,300
We will do something.

1183
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:48,070
lt has hardly been some
time since we joined college.

1184
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:50,903
When will you do it?
You are wasting your time on Meher.

1185
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:53,679
Look, Prem, she is just
a good friend of ours.

1186
01:07:53,913 --> 01:07:55,710
Don't try to stretch
that relationship.

1187
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:58,113
Don't think of a future.
What if she comes to know?

1188
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:00,215
What do you mean?

1189
01:08:00,753 --> 01:08:02,118
What will Meher find out?

1190
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:03,621
Param is right, Prem.

1191
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,089
Things have not gone far.

1192
01:08:05,558 --> 01:08:07,788
lf Meher finds out that
we have lied to our parents...

1193
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:09,988
...have come to Arts college
instead of medical...

1194
01:08:10,063 --> 01:08:12,190
...by deceitfully making
them sign the forms...

1195
01:08:12,265 --> 01:08:13,698
...then what will she think?

1196
01:08:13,766 --> 01:08:14,994
And what about Satyawadi?

1197
01:08:15,068 --> 01:08:17,969
lf this comes out,
he will never tolerate this lie.

1198
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:19,128
Get this straight.

1199
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:21,071
l don't care if they find out.

1200
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:22,898
We are not committing a crime.

1201
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:48,667
You all are
rusticated from my college.

1202
01:08:49,035 --> 01:08:51,230
For breaking my faith,
your parents' faith...

1203
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:53,332
...and the discipline
of this institution.

1204
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,401
Sir, we agree that we made a mistake.

1205
01:09:00,546 --> 01:09:01,513
We lied.

1206
01:09:03,116 --> 01:09:06,210
But, sir, what we did
isn't such a big crime...

1207
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,418
...for which you are giving us
such a big punishment.

1208
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:11,851
Sir...

1209
01:09:13,126 --> 01:09:14,559
Our lives will get ruined, sir.

1210
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:17,389
Mister, you ruined
your life the day...

1211
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:20,825
...you made your
parents deceitfully sign...

1212
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:24,199
...Arts college form
instead of Medical college.

1213
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:25,762
This is a crime.

1214
01:09:26,506 --> 01:09:28,098
That too an unpardonable one.

1215
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:32,611
To fool parents who are spending
their hard earned money...

1216
01:09:33,246 --> 01:09:35,510
...on you is a crime.

1217
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:38,843
And there is no place for
cheats in Satyawadi's world.

1218
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:41,747
Forgive me, sir.

1219
01:09:43,656 --> 01:09:45,851
You shouldn't give so much
freedom to your children...

1220
01:09:46,492 --> 01:09:48,153
...that you lose control over them.

1221
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:12,080
My name is Kabir Satyawadi.

1222
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:15,849
There can be only one band
in this college. Kabir's.

1223
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,817
Others will have to meet dust.

1224
01:10:19,358 --> 01:10:21,792
Tell this to your
romantic friend, Prem.

1225
01:10:22,495 --> 01:10:26,295
Forget Meher, if he even
thinks about Meher's shadow...

1226
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,656
...then this is just a preview.

1227
01:10:29,869 --> 01:10:31,336
There is more to come.

1228
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:40,602
Give it to me, father. l will turn
the direction of the water flow.

1229
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:43,247
Ramu.
- Yes, sir.

1230
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:45,316
Water is here only for
limited period of time.

1231
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:50,385
lf the flow isn't changed on time,
all the harvest will be ruined.

1232
01:10:51,157 --> 01:10:52,522
He has already ruined it.

1233
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:56,360
Son, you should take
care of the harvest.

1234
01:10:56,762 --> 01:10:57,592
Okay, sir.

1235
01:10:57,864 --> 01:10:59,764
l already owe a lot.

1236
01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:07,232
What have you thought about Raj?

1237
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,705
Where do you want to get him admitted?

1238
01:11:10,743 --> 01:11:14,804
l thought that if you could
extend your leave for 2-3 days...

1239
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:18,544
Jasleen, if l, too,
start disobeying my orders...

1240
01:11:19,452 --> 01:11:22,114
then there won't be any difference
left between me and your Raj.

1241
01:11:22,355 --> 01:11:24,585
And your son doesn't need
admission in a medical college...

1242
01:11:24,724 --> 01:11:26,316
...he needs a medical checkup.

1243
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,228
Father...

1244
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:34,325
Jasleen, l don't have time to waste.

1245
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,425
lt is time for me to leave.
l am make a move.

1246
01:11:36,736 --> 01:11:38,203
But please, at least let me...

1247
01:11:38,638 --> 01:11:39,570
Complete...

1248
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:45,303
So, mister, start practising
in the ground from today itself.

1249
01:11:45,845 --> 01:11:47,437
l will make you join the army.

1250
01:11:47,747 --> 01:11:49,305
You couldn't become a doctor.

1251
01:11:49,682 --> 01:11:51,377
You might as well become a constable.

1252
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:56,219
Constable's father, lG Hardeep Singh.

1253
01:11:57,456 --> 01:11:59,083
You doubted my capability...

1254
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,521
...that you started
doing such things?

1255
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,064
Perhaps...

1256
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:13,561
Our love has spoilt you.

1257
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,667
You deceitfully made me sign it.

1258
01:12:21,447 --> 01:12:23,347
Vijay's mother.
- Yes.

1259
01:12:25,251 --> 01:12:27,116
Start giving him a
tiffin from tomorrow.

1260
01:12:27,486 --> 01:12:28,714
He will come with me.

1261
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:34,357
He should know...
what being a clerk means.

1262
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,116
So what...

1263
01:12:37,129 --> 01:12:39,427
...if l made him sign it to be
an artist instead of a doctor?

1264
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,090
l, too, have a life of my own.

1265
01:12:42,168 --> 01:12:42,896
Your life.

1266
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:46,531
And you wish to start it with a lie.

1267
01:12:46,872 --> 01:12:47,566
Yes.

1268
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:50,136
As if you would have agreed
if l would have told the truth.

1269
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:52,234
Fine, then you will go to
the factory from tomorrow.

1270
01:12:52,778 --> 01:12:55,178
l wanted to educate you,
make you a doctor...

1271
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:57,111
...and open a big hospital for you.

1272
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:01,144
You were anyway not going to serve
the people by opening a hospital.

1273
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:04,552
You were going to
exploit people, Mr. Mittal.

1274
01:13:04,857 --> 01:13:06,848
So according to you
doctors exploit people?

1275
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:10,856
No one make his child a doctor...

1276
01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:14,299
...thinking that he will
make him proud one day.

1277
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:17,862
Everyone can see the money
they will get in the future.

1278
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:20,369
And you?

1279
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:22,502
You, too, have the same dream.

1280
01:13:23,309 --> 01:13:25,243
l won't let my dream die.

1281
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:29,338
One day our Pure Punjab Band
will be famous across the world.

1282
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:33,676
And that day...you will
hold your head high and say...

1283
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:37,348
...Yes. Yes, my son,
Prem made the right decision.

1284
01:13:37,423 --> 01:13:38,447
Stop your nonsense.

1285
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:42,826
You will handle the Focal Point
factory from tomorrow.

1286
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:43,789
That's it.

1287
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:27,466
Shall we leave, Vijay?
- Yes, father.

1288
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:28,796
Galti.

1289
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:31,233
Galti.

1290
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:34,140
Galti.

1291
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:36,181
Galti.
- Father is here.

1292
01:14:36,282 --> 01:14:37,681
Damn you.
- Yes.

1293
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,446
l bought a new CD player
just day before yesterday.

1294
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:44,385
You ruined that as well, scoundrel.
- What do l do?

1295
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:47,253
You didn't let me do
what l wanted to do.

1296
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:51,226
l wanted to be an engineer.
You ruined my career.

1297
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:51,888
Galti.

1298
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:55,357
No. lt's Galti. Galti. Galti.

1299
01:14:55,434 --> 01:14:56,867
Yes. Galti.
- Yes.

1300
01:14:57,103 --> 01:14:59,264
You cannot even talk properly.

1301
01:14:59,405 --> 01:15:01,373
And you want to be an engineer.
- Hear that.

1302
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:03,499
You don't need to speak
properly to be an engineer.

1303
01:15:03,676 --> 01:15:05,268
You need brains.

1304
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,372
My enemy.

1305
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,042
Stop.
- Yes.

1306
01:15:09,115 --> 01:15:10,844
You didn't become an engineer.
- Yes.

1307
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:12,448
And yet you are making us
suffer a loss.

1308
01:15:12,518 --> 01:15:14,247
lf you would have
become an engineer...

1309
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,288
...then l wonder what
you would have done.

1310
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:17,719
He wants to be an engineer.

1311
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:20,258
lt's engineer.

1312
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,188
You understood me, right?
- Yes.

1313
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:23,159
Why can't l?

1314
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:25,527
That's why l said you need brains.

1315
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,783
Sir, boss is calling you.

1316
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:46,681
Come on.

1317
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:58,261
Mr. Roshanlal, leave the job
if you cannot do the work.

1318
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:01,595
Otherwise l would have to
send your report to my seniors.

1319
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:04,060
Why is your mind these days?

1320
01:16:04,403 --> 01:16:07,702
l have been hiding your
mistakes since last one year.

1321
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:08,740
One year.

1322
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:11,234
You always make
mistakes in the calculations.

1323
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:13,345
You always make some
mistake in the calculations.

1324
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:16,145
Today, if l wouldn't
have checked it then...

1325
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:19,513
...l too would have to suffer
its consequences along with you.

1326
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:24,347
Take this file.
And get your glasses checked.

1327
01:16:25,591 --> 01:16:28,059
l...will be careful.

1328
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:38,268
Hi. Hi, Prem. lt's Meher.

1329
01:16:38,671 --> 01:16:41,196
Oh. Meher.

1330
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:43,640
So you have started missing me...

1331
01:16:43,876 --> 01:16:45,400
...my dream killer?

1332
01:16:46,412 --> 01:16:47,379
Shut up.

1333
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:50,077
Prem, stop flirting.

1334
01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:52,078
l didn't call you for that reason.

1335
01:16:52,284 --> 01:16:52,875
Hello.

1336
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:55,412
l too don't enjoy flirting with you.

1337
01:16:57,156 --> 01:17:01,092
And l came to know that our
dreams were killed because of you.

1338
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,521
l...l know.

1339
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:05,220
But you know what?

1340
01:17:05,297 --> 01:17:06,764
You are responsible
for that we well.

1341
01:17:07,366 --> 01:17:09,630
lf you wouldn't have spoken
about me in the music room...

1342
01:17:10,135 --> 01:17:11,625
...Kabir wouldn't have
heard it and...

1343
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:15,171
...he wouldn't have told
father everything about you.

1344
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:18,237
Lives of the other three is
getting ruined because of you.

1345
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:21,240
What?

1346
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:23,339
You are blaming me for it?

1347
01:17:24,116 --> 01:17:25,208
lt is your mistake.

1348
01:17:25,484 --> 01:17:28,282
Our dreams were killed
because of you.

1349
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:30,179
And you are blaming me for it.

1350
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:31,188
That is great.

1351
01:17:31,423 --> 01:17:33,050
Enough. Stop it now.

1352
01:17:33,492 --> 01:17:37,451
Your phrases and your ways
of proposing are the same.

1353
01:17:38,464 --> 01:17:39,260
Okay.

1354
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:42,200
You didn't like the way l proposed.

1355
01:17:42,601 --> 01:17:44,193
Then dear tell me...

1356
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:49,100
...did you at least like the guy?
- Prem, don't talk nonsense.

1357
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:53,402
Look, l tried calling
Param a number of times.

1358
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,237
He isn't taking my calls.

1359
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:57,614
l think he is angry with me as well.

1360
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:00,816
Prem, you should give
courage to your friends.

1361
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:05,283
Get them together and
lead them to your dreams.

1362
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:08,384
l think the other
three have lost courage.

1363
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:13,697
l don't know about them but you...

1364
01:18:13,766 --> 01:18:15,495
...seem to have
become very courageous.

1365
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:18,035
Beware if you try to
keep any relationship...

1366
01:18:18,103 --> 01:18:19,730
...with those scoundrels, henceforth.

1367
01:18:20,472 --> 01:18:22,030
l will be your worst enemy.

1368
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:30,482
lf you permit, can l come in?

1369
01:18:31,483 --> 01:18:32,450
Father, you?

1370
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:37,116
l have come to tell you that...

1371
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,251
...factories don't run by keeping...

1372
01:18:39,325 --> 01:18:40,815
...your foot on the desk
in your office.

1373
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,254
They run on hard work.

1374
01:18:42,595 --> 01:18:45,325
You need to get behind the
workers and make them work hard.

1375
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,088
They run on cooperation.

1376
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:49,330
Learn to respect work, son.

1377
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:50,830
Learn to respect work.

1378
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:55,634
And come to me with the today's
records within half an hour.

1379
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:04,674
Hello.

1380
01:19:04,817 --> 01:19:06,250
How are you, Pure Punjabis?

1381
01:19:06,318 --> 01:19:09,344
Buddies, what has my
father got me into?

1382
01:19:10,255 --> 01:19:11,620
Yes, l agree.

1383
01:19:11,857 --> 01:19:14,155
But what father says
isn't wrong either.

1384
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:16,190
My father doesn't say anything.

1385
01:19:16,762 --> 01:19:18,457
Whenever l look at him, he looks away.

1386
01:19:18,664 --> 01:19:22,327
My father says that he has taken
a lot of loan for my education.

1387
01:19:22,468 --> 01:19:24,436
Father says so.
Father says so. Father says so.

1388
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:26,531
We can at least meet, right?

1389
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:27,901
Or does father say
something for that as well?

1390
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,613
Be a man, son.

1391
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:45,816
Don't be scared of girls.

1392
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:50,294
Everyday you do some
new mischief in college.

1393
01:19:50,629 --> 01:19:52,722
Daddy says so. Daddy
says so. He says so.

1394
01:19:52,798 --> 01:19:54,789
Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so.

1395
01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:58,826
l am sad. When will you pass?

1396
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:03,537
You couldn't clear a single
class in all these years?

1397
01:20:03,609 --> 01:20:06,169
Daddy says so to me.
Daddy says so. He says so.

1398
01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:07,735
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1399
01:20:08,113 --> 01:20:10,104
Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so.

1400
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:12,412
He says so.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1401
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,455
You keep loitering around.

1402
01:20:23,529 --> 01:20:25,588
This won't help you survive.

1403
01:20:25,731 --> 01:20:30,293
Like a leech,
you have sucked all my blood.

1404
01:20:30,502 --> 01:20:32,231
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1405
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:34,499
Daddy says so.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1406
01:20:34,573 --> 01:20:36,598
Whose child are you?

1407
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:38,836
There is no pleasure or joy.

1408
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:43,672
l haven't a moment of
peace after your birth.

1409
01:20:43,749 --> 01:20:45,376
Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so.

1410
01:20:45,451 --> 01:20:47,919
He says so to me.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1411
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,254
Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so.

1412
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:52,313
He says so to me.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1413
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,436
When you take your
Enfield for a round.

1414
01:21:12,544 --> 01:21:14,842
You ask for Rs. 500 and
you fuel it up for Rs. 20.

1415
01:21:15,214 --> 01:21:16,875
You are fooling your father.

1416
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:19,208
You splurge with my
hard earned money.

1417
01:21:19,284 --> 01:21:21,115
Sometimes notices, sometimes fines.

1418
01:21:21,186 --> 01:21:23,177
You are the talk of the town.

1419
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:27,415
Son, l can no longer
bear your expenses.

1420
01:21:27,726 --> 01:21:29,717
Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so.

1421
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:32,093
He says so.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1422
01:21:32,264 --> 01:21:34,289
Getting together with perverts...

1423
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:36,559
...you have ruined my reputation.

1424
01:21:36,635 --> 01:21:38,660
With a bowl in my hand...

1425
01:21:38,771 --> 01:21:41,137
...you have made me a beggar.

1426
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,399
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1427
01:21:43,475 --> 01:21:45,409
He says so to me.
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1428
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:47,638
Getting together with perverts...

1429
01:21:47,713 --> 01:21:49,681
...you have ruined my reputation.

1430
01:21:49,748 --> 01:21:52,114
With a bowl in my hand...

1431
01:21:52,184 --> 01:21:54,448
...you have made me a beggar.

1432
01:21:54,686 --> 01:21:56,449
Daddy says so. Daddy says so.

1433
01:21:56,522 --> 01:21:58,513
He says so to me. Daddy
says so. Daddy says so.

1434
01:21:58,724 --> 01:22:00,624
You keep changing your hair style.

1435
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:03,091
Sometimes spikes, sometimes curls.

1436
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:07,724
l don't understand your
strange fashion sense.

1437
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,161
Daddy says so. Daddy says so to me.

1438
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:16,498
Daddy says so to me. father says so.

1439
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:21,507
Daddy. Daddy.

1440
01:22:22,214 --> 01:22:22,873
Daddy.

1441
01:22:23,115 --> 01:22:25,811
My daddy.

1442
01:22:26,318 --> 01:22:28,684
My dear father.

1443
01:22:29,121 --> 01:22:30,315
No.

1444
01:22:30,556 --> 01:22:32,353
Are we at someone's condolence meet?

1445
01:22:32,825 --> 01:22:36,226
ldiots, l came running
from my father's machines.

1446
01:22:36,562 --> 01:22:38,189
Thinking that l will meet you all.

1447
01:22:38,463 --> 01:22:39,760
l will recall old memories.

1448
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:42,526
And you are behaving as if...

1449
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:45,301
As if Meher has become
your sister-in-law.

1450
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:47,365
lt is not funny.

1451
01:22:47,472 --> 01:22:48,734
Son, you lost your touch.

1452
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:50,667
Now you know?

1453
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:53,645
What the machines
in the factory have done to me?

1454
01:22:54,446 --> 01:22:55,640
Convince your families.

1455
01:22:56,248 --> 01:22:57,442
Otherwise our Pure Punjabi Band...

1456
01:22:57,516 --> 01:22:59,609
...will always remain
an unfulfilled dream.

1457
01:22:59,852 --> 01:23:00,784
You are right.

1458
01:23:01,153 --> 01:23:04,350
lf we keep giving in to
the demands of our family...

1459
01:23:04,456 --> 01:23:06,447
...we will start greying
in our youth.

1460
01:23:06,658 --> 01:23:08,250
Both of you so easily said it.

1461
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:10,821
But the way the situation is
at my place...

1462
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:13,463
...l cannot even think
about going against my family.

1463
01:23:13,732 --> 01:23:14,460
Yes.

1464
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,698
l, too,
have stopped thinking about this.

1465
01:23:16,768 --> 01:23:19,362
Now l am concentrating
on farming with my father.

1466
01:23:20,606 --> 01:23:21,800
And he is happy with that.

1467
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:23,333
But are you happy?

1468
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:26,067
We studied together.

1469
01:23:26,478 --> 01:23:27,638
We like same things.

1470
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:30,807
ln our school why did God
only give us this talent?

1471
01:23:31,283 --> 01:23:33,114
Why did only
we think of making a band?

1472
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:35,584
Because we were fools, son.
That's why.

1473
01:23:36,855 --> 01:23:41,087
Think. Why don't we want to be a
doctor, an engineer or a businessman?

1474
01:23:42,527 --> 01:23:44,825
Because God hasn't made us for that.

1475
01:23:46,164 --> 01:23:48,223
We souls are linked to music.

1476
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,396
Our heart has always told us
to do something different.

1477
01:23:51,536 --> 01:23:54,630
Do something different.
- Enough. You might be right.

1478
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,207
You are right.

1479
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:58,468
But my parents are like God to me.

1480
01:23:58,543 --> 01:24:00,272
And l can't hurt them any more.

1481
01:24:02,314 --> 01:24:04,373
l, too, cannot see
my father sad any more.

1482
01:24:06,218 --> 01:24:07,583
What can we say about dreams? '

1483
01:24:09,054 --> 01:24:10,578
They come when we close our eyes...

1484
01:24:12,691 --> 01:24:14,158
...and end when we open them.

1485
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:26,128
'Think. Why don't we want to be a
doctor, an engineer or a businessman? '

1486
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:28,398
'Because God hasn't made us for that.'

1487
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,440
'We souls are linked to music.'

1488
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:43,287
Oh ring, l shine and polish you.

1489
01:24:43,355 --> 01:24:46,153
Sons are like sweet
cake for mothers.

1490
01:24:46,258 --> 01:24:48,692
May God bestow all
mothers with them.

1491
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,695
Listen to me, oh, ring. Oh crow.

1492
01:24:51,763 --> 01:24:55,597
Mothers are like
the acacia shade in the desert.

1493
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:58,625
Father, why do you
always sing this song?

1494
01:24:59,037 --> 01:25:03,030
Son, it is great. Gurdas Maan
has sung such a nice song.

1495
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:07,042
He showed a glimpse
of Punjab's heritage.

1496
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:11,237
lf one has to write
a song it should be like this.

1497
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:15,251
And if one has to sing a song,
he should sing it like this one.

1498
01:25:26,797 --> 01:25:27,889
Here you go, sir.

1499
01:25:28,032 --> 01:25:28,999
Here's your tea.

1500
01:25:29,867 --> 01:25:31,664
Did you give it to my son?

1501
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:34,031
Sir, l called him long back.

1502
01:25:34,205 --> 01:25:35,194
Where is he?

1503
01:25:35,773 --> 01:25:37,638
You should take care of him.

1504
01:25:37,975 --> 01:25:39,203
He is sad.

1505
01:25:40,077 --> 01:25:41,977
He lost his childhood friends.

1506
01:25:42,313 --> 01:25:43,905
You are right, sir.

1507
01:25:44,215 --> 01:25:46,046
What you are right?

1508
01:25:46,283 --> 01:25:47,841
l asked where is he?

1509
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:50,785
He... Sir, he is sitting
under that tree.

1510
01:25:56,861 --> 01:26:00,092
l think he is writing
a letter to his friend.

1511
01:26:00,631 --> 01:26:03,099
Stupid, why would he write a letter.

1512
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:05,665
This is the mobile generation.

1513
01:26:06,237 --> 01:26:08,797
He can talk his friends
whenever he wants.

1514
01:26:10,107 --> 01:26:13,406
Let me check, has my son really...

1515
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:17,078
...forgone worldly pleasures
and became a farmer.

1516
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,012
l am so stupid.

1517
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:23,013
l didn't speak to him properly
ever since he has come back.

1518
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,296
What are you doing, Param?

1519
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:42,163
Father, when l was small you
used to often sing a song.

1520
01:26:42,339 --> 01:26:44,705
Today when l saw you
working in the field...

1521
01:26:44,842 --> 01:26:46,139
...l recalled that song.

1522
01:26:46,343 --> 01:26:48,402
So l wrote it down in my song book.

1523
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:49,644
Look at it.

1524
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:53,650
Aren't you satisfied getting
me insulted in the college?

1525
01:26:54,285 --> 01:26:56,048
That you are taking that path again?

1526
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,813
l wonder at what inauspicious
hour did l sing that song...

1527
01:26:59,657 --> 01:27:01,284
...that you became a writer.

1528
01:27:02,226 --> 01:27:03,921
l will end this forever today.

1529
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:06,659
l don't know what
crime l had committed...

1530
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:10,928
...that l was given
such a stubborn child.

1531
01:27:12,203 --> 01:27:15,229
l was better off being childless
than having such a child.

1532
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:16,329
No.

1533
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:20,902
No, please, father.

1534
01:27:21,178 --> 01:27:23,772
No, father.
No, father. Please. Please.

1535
01:27:24,181 --> 01:27:26,240
Father, this is my dream. Father...

1536
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:27,247
Father!

1537
01:27:27,418 --> 01:27:28,248
No!

1538
01:27:33,057 --> 01:27:35,753
'l was better off being
childless than having such a child.'

1539
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,891
'Think. Why don't we want to be a
doctor, an engineer or a businessman?'

1540
01:27:40,197 --> 01:27:42,028
'Because God hasn't made us for that.'

1541
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,233
'We souls are linked to music.'

1542
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:47,836
'l was better off being childless.'

1543
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,271
Raj.
- l will go and call the doctor.

1544
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,048
All of you, please go out.

1545
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:03,980
Nurse...
- Come on. - Hurry up.

1546
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,959
'l don't know what
crime l had committed...'

1547
01:28:14,798 --> 01:28:17,926
'...that l was given
such a stubborn child.'

1548
01:28:18,903 --> 01:28:21,303
'l was better off being
childless than having such a child.'

1549
01:28:21,372 --> 01:28:23,806
'No, father.
This is my dream. Father...'

1550
01:28:24,108 --> 01:28:25,166
Mr. Dayal Singh?

1551
01:28:31,081 --> 01:28:32,673
Patient is out of danger now.

1552
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:36,183
He has regained consciousness.

1553
01:28:36,253 --> 01:28:37,777
But there is a bad news.

1554
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:42,920
Due to the impact on
the spinal cord...

1555
01:28:43,327 --> 01:28:45,887
...Param lower body is not reacting.

1556
01:28:47,965 --> 01:28:51,264
Doctor, my Param will get well, right?

1557
01:28:53,103 --> 01:28:55,799
Look, l cannot say anything.

1558
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,137
But there is nothing to worry about.

1559
01:28:58,442 --> 01:29:00,137
lt can take a month or two.

1560
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:01,970
lt is possible...

1561
01:29:02,213 --> 01:29:04,408
Yes. But it is expensive.

1562
01:29:05,015 --> 01:29:07,677
You should arrange for
money at the earliest.

1563
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:24,330
Our Lord answers all prayers.

1564
01:29:25,035 --> 01:29:36,970
Those who take
His name wins all battles.

1565
01:29:42,052 --> 01:29:47,354
Oh mortal being...

1566
01:29:48,025 --> 01:29:52,018
Why are you sad?

1567
01:29:54,798 --> 01:29:57,824
Oh mortal being...

1568
01:29:58,135 --> 01:30:02,037
Why are you sad?

1569
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,942
lf He closes one path,
He opens many more.

1570
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:12,347
He opens many more.

1571
01:30:12,883 --> 01:30:15,147
You look for Him outside.

1572
01:30:15,219 --> 01:30:18,882
He speaks from within you.

1573
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,154
He speaks from within you.

1574
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:28,162
He is always with you.

1575
01:30:28,866 --> 01:30:32,393
Oh mortal being...

1576
01:30:33,937 --> 01:30:38,237
Why are you sad?

1577
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:40,809
Oh mortal being...

1578
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:41,876
Father...

1579
01:30:43,213 --> 01:30:44,840
l am in urgent need of money.

1580
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,313
Otherwise my friend
will become a handicap.

1581
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:50,081
Since how many days have you
been working in the factory?

1582
01:30:51,055 --> 01:30:52,613
lf we treat you as the manager...

1583
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:56,350
...you have already taken more money
from the factory than your salary.

1584
01:30:56,927 --> 01:30:58,895
You owe the factory some money.

1585
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:03,329
My friend is struggling for his life.

1586
01:31:06,203 --> 01:31:07,932
And you are tallying accounts with me?

1587
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:13,437
While making money have you
forgotten that l am your son.

1588
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:15,069
l am not a worker.

1589
01:31:15,145 --> 01:31:16,305
So what should l do?

1590
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,677
l am not here to give charity.

1591
01:31:19,049 --> 01:31:22,849
l gave birth to you so that you
grow up and expand my business.

1592
01:31:23,354 --> 01:31:24,150
Son...

1593
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:27,453
l donate money to orphanages
and welfare homes every month.

1594
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:30,820
And as far as considering you a son
or a worker is concerned...

1595
01:31:31,295 --> 01:31:33,456
Son, l have given
you a lot of luxuries.

1596
01:31:35,132 --> 01:31:36,360
l got insulted as well.

1597
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,831
Because of your dramatic friends.

1598
01:31:42,106 --> 01:31:43,095
One more thing.

1599
01:31:48,812 --> 01:31:50,074
Those who perform...

1600
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:58,744
They are given some
money to keep evil away.

1601
01:32:00,924 --> 01:32:03,085
And not cheques
amounting to millions. Here.

1602
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:22,042
Dayal Singh,
your small piece of land...

1603
01:32:22,179 --> 01:32:24,147
...was in the middle of my land.

1604
01:32:25,716 --> 01:32:29,174
l tried buying it out from you had
a higher price a number of times.

1605
01:32:29,386 --> 01:32:30,910
Why all of a sudden today...

1606
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:05,018
l wouldn't have...
dared to sell you...

1607
01:33:06,423 --> 01:33:09,017
...my food providing mother.

1608
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:12,887
But this helpless...

1609
01:33:14,231 --> 01:33:20,761
...and circumstance
driven Dayal Singh's son...

1610
01:33:21,705 --> 01:33:27,803
...is on the verge of
becoming handicap, Mother.

1611
01:33:31,281 --> 01:33:37,083
Accept it as His desire.

1612
01:33:37,454 --> 01:33:40,719
Accept whatever He does.

1613
01:33:41,725 --> 01:33:44,125
Whether He gives you joy or sorrow.

1614
01:33:44,194 --> 01:33:47,789
Accept it gracefully.

1615
01:33:47,965 --> 01:33:51,059
Accept it gracefully.

1616
01:33:52,069 --> 01:33:55,272
Be His follower.

1617
01:33:55,272 --> 01:33:59,834
Oh mortal being...

1618
01:33:59,977 --> 01:34:04,073
Why are you sad?

1619
01:34:04,248 --> 01:34:08,378
Oh mortal being...

1620
01:34:08,952 --> 01:34:13,685
Why are you sad?

1621
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:22,020
Raj!

1622
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,201
Why are you punishing yourself?

1623
01:34:28,772 --> 01:34:30,069
Why are you crying, mother?

1624
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,208
lf a father who
belongs to an army family...

1625
01:34:32,276 --> 01:34:34,904
...has a son who is a weak singer...

1626
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:37,939
...then people will
mock lG Hardeep Singh.

1627
01:34:38,682 --> 01:34:40,877
That is why your son
will have to be strong.

1628
01:34:41,852 --> 01:34:42,841
You leave.

1629
01:34:43,153 --> 01:34:45,053
Your tears will weaken me.

1630
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:49,089
Don't...misunderstand your father.

1631
01:34:49,293 --> 01:34:50,988
He is not your enemy.

1632
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,958
My destiny is my enemy, mother.

1633
01:35:00,337 --> 01:35:01,770
Let's go, father.

1634
01:35:11,782 --> 01:35:12,714
Mother...

1635
01:35:13,216 --> 01:35:15,377
From the time brother Vijay
has returned from college...

1636
01:35:15,886 --> 01:35:17,148
...he has changed completely.

1637
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:20,683
lt feels as if he has become mature.

1638
01:35:21,325 --> 01:35:24,294
He neither talks, nor laughs,
nor goes anywhere.

1639
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:28,261
He just stays so quiet.

1640
01:35:32,202 --> 01:35:34,227
lt is very difficult to
kill your desires, dear.

1641
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,707
And my Vijay is suffering inside.

1642
01:35:42,145 --> 01:35:43,976
He is punishing himself.

1643
01:35:44,348 --> 01:35:50,378
Accept whatever He does.

1644
01:35:50,921 --> 01:35:53,890
Accept whatever He does.

1645
01:35:54,691 --> 01:35:57,159
Whether He gives you joy or sorrow.

1646
01:35:57,227 --> 01:36:00,685
Accept it gracefully.

1647
01:36:01,031 --> 01:36:03,761
Accept it gracefully.

1648
01:36:05,202 --> 01:36:09,969
Be His follower.

1649
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:15,041
Oh mortal being...

1650
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:19,942
Why are you sad?

1651
01:36:20,017 --> 01:36:23,043
Oh mortal being...

1652
01:36:23,286 --> 01:36:27,780
Why are you sad?

1653
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,888
Hello, brother.

1654
01:36:41,805 --> 01:36:43,966
Galti.
- Yes, father?

1655
01:36:44,274 --> 01:36:45,400
Where are you going?

1656
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:47,804
l am going for some work, father.

1657
01:36:47,944 --> 01:36:49,002
What work?

1658
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:50,842
And is this the time to go to work?

1659
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:53,312
Father, l have
started my own business.

1660
01:36:53,383 --> 01:36:54,782
l can go whenever l want.

1661
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:57,043
And all you want is money. Money.

1662
01:36:57,254 --> 01:37:01,213
l have decided that l will
please you by making money.

1663
01:37:01,391 --> 01:37:02,221
Lease?

1664
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:04,760
No, please.

1665
01:37:05,328 --> 01:37:06,886
Please.
- Yes. Yes.

1666
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:10,796
l will please you, son. A beating...
- Lalit.

1667
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:12,097
Yes, brother?

1668
01:37:12,169 --> 01:37:14,160
Why are you after him day and night?

1669
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:16,866
lt's nothing, brother.
He doesn't do any work.

1670
01:37:16,973 --> 01:37:18,634
He makes me suffer a loss everyday.

1671
01:37:18,809 --> 01:37:20,140
Now he is saying that
he is going to work.

1672
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,700
Tell me, is this a time
to go to work?

1673
01:37:21,778 --> 01:37:24,008
Look, he is naïve.

1674
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:26,239
You shouldn't scold him all the time.

1675
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:29,384
Go. Go and see.
He might end up doing something wrong.

1676
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,353
Go.
- Okay, brother. - Very good.

1677
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:34,054
Prem...

1678
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:37,419
What have you decided?
- Tell me, when do you want to go.

1679
01:37:40,297 --> 01:37:42,026
l don't feel this is right.

1680
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:46,827
lt's not about how you feel, Vijay.

1681
01:37:47,437 --> 01:37:49,371
lt is the question
of our friend's life.

1682
01:37:51,808 --> 01:37:53,708
l don't think
anything will happen there.

1683
01:37:57,781 --> 01:37:58,645
l agree.

1684
01:38:00,383 --> 01:38:03,113
Okay, if not for Param,
then come for me.

1685
01:38:19,169 --> 01:38:20,193
Meher.
- Yes?

1686
01:38:21,304 --> 01:38:23,295
What is it, dear?
Why aren't you eating anything?

1687
01:38:24,274 --> 01:38:26,105
Father, l was
thinking about something.

1688
01:38:26,343 --> 01:38:27,207
About what?

1689
01:38:28,345 --> 01:38:30,210
Father, have you read Bhagavad-Gita?

1690
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,704
Yes. Why?

1691
01:38:32,382 --> 01:38:34,350
ln that Lord Krishna has
said that if we want...

1692
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:39,150
...we can find peace
even in a battlefield.

1693
01:38:39,389 --> 01:38:40,720
Yes. Right.

1694
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,185
You too could have
found another solution.

1695
01:38:43,693 --> 01:38:46,218
Dear, which
battlefield am l a part of.

1696
01:38:46,897 --> 01:38:48,922
ln the battlefield of your principles.

1697
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:51,157
You defeated those four boys.

1698
01:38:52,169 --> 01:38:53,067
No, dear.

1699
01:38:53,436 --> 01:38:55,927
l defeated a lie with my principles.

1700
01:38:56,173 --> 01:39:00,132
This is also a fact that music
runs in their veins, father.

1701
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,138
And if a lie makes someone's life...

1702
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,077
...and leads someone
to his destination...

1703
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:07,082
...then that lie isn't a lie, father.

1704
01:39:14,024 --> 01:39:16,288
Dear, l just did my duty.

1705
01:39:18,028 --> 01:39:20,656
l expelled them from
college because of their mistake.

1706
01:39:22,432 --> 01:39:23,330
But yes...

1707
01:39:25,101 --> 01:39:27,228
if anything wrong has happened
to them because of me...

1708
01:39:28,672 --> 01:39:30,697
then l will bring them back.

1709
01:39:31,808 --> 01:39:32,968
Applause.

1710
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:36,103
Thank you, friends.

1711
01:39:36,379 --> 01:39:38,813
You applauded for me.

1712
01:39:39,082 --> 01:39:44,019
A true artist like me
hungers nothing but one.

1713
01:39:44,154 --> 01:39:45,485
Applause?
- No.

1714
01:39:46,056 --> 01:39:46,886
Money.

1715
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:53,420
l mean your applaud is my
biggest wealth and treasure.

1716
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:54,831
Applause.

1717
01:39:54,998 --> 01:39:57,899
Devdas. Devdas. Devdas.

1718
01:39:57,968 --> 01:39:59,697
Devdas. Devdas. Devdas.

1719
01:39:59,769 --> 01:40:02,329
l object, Your Honor. l object.

1720
01:40:02,906 --> 01:40:05,340
Principal, we won't let it die.

1721
01:40:05,976 --> 01:40:08,206
We won't let our dreams die.

1722
01:40:08,445 --> 01:40:10,413
Till when will you keep us quiet?

1723
01:40:10,747 --> 01:40:11,645
Till when?

1724
01:40:11,915 --> 01:40:13,906
Why do you want to
turn us into machines?

1725
01:40:14,017 --> 01:40:14,813
Why?

1726
01:40:15,085 --> 01:40:21,923
Till when will we keep going
in circles like a scared bull?

1727
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:22,990
Till when?

1728
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:29,988
Till when will we endure
the whip of forced dreams?

1729
01:40:30,133 --> 01:40:30,997
Till when?

1730
01:40:31,334 --> 01:40:33,666
Now we won't let our dreams die.

1731
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:35,431
No!

1732
01:40:37,307 --> 01:40:38,239
Mastram!

1733
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:44,409
lt is not just difficult to
break Satyawadi's principles.

1734
01:40:45,148 --> 01:40:46,172
lt is impossible.

1735
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:50,781
And you...have broken
the discipline of Satyawadi.

1736
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:54,414
Henceforth peon Mastram
won't be allowed to enter...

1737
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:56,125
...this opera auditorium.

1738
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,093
But drama instructor
Mastram will be allowed.

1739
01:41:13,843 --> 01:41:15,902
l will call you later.
Okay? Love you. Love you.

1740
01:41:16,913 --> 01:41:19,245
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

1741
01:41:19,316 --> 01:41:21,147
Have a seat.

1742
01:41:21,318 --> 01:41:22,250
Thank you.

1743
01:41:23,386 --> 01:41:25,684
l should thank you.

1744
01:41:25,889 --> 01:41:28,187
l got to hear such great music.

1745
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:29,881
Your song is so nice.

1746
01:41:30,093 --> 01:41:31,993
My friend...

1747
01:41:32,062 --> 01:41:33,962
Don't wobble.

1748
01:41:36,766 --> 01:41:37,323
Okay.

1749
01:41:37,434 --> 01:41:39,994
So Rs. 25 lakhs.

1750
01:41:43,173 --> 01:41:45,767
Okay. Whenever you feel is right.

1751
01:41:47,043 --> 01:41:49,477
So, okay, what about the advance?

1752
01:41:49,946 --> 01:41:50,708
What?

1753
01:41:50,847 --> 01:41:52,178
Give it whenever you want.

1754
01:41:52,682 --> 01:41:55,310
Not give it. Take it. Take it.

1755
01:41:56,219 --> 01:41:58,244
Yes. Yes. l got it.
We will take it.

1756
01:41:58,788 --> 01:42:00,847
We will take it whenever you give it.

1757
01:42:00,924 --> 01:42:01,788
No problem.

1758
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:05,985
l think there is a confusion.

1759
01:42:06,062 --> 01:42:09,793
l mean you have to
give me 50% advance.

1760
01:42:09,866 --> 01:42:12,198
That is Rs. 12.5 lakhs.

1761
01:42:15,005 --> 01:42:16,029
50-50...

1762
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,938
We have come to sell our project.

1763
01:42:22,812 --> 01:42:25,246
You have come to sell your
project in a company in Punjab?

1764
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:27,945
Get up.

1765
01:42:29,052 --> 01:42:30,076
Get up.

1766
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:31,718
Can you see that door?

1767
01:42:32,389 --> 01:42:33,651
Go. Go.

1768
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:35,722
Go. Go.

1769
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,351
They want to sell the project.

1770
01:42:44,267 --> 01:42:45,928
Hi, Simmi darling.

1771
01:42:46,236 --> 01:42:48,227
Where is 50-50?

1772
01:42:48,438 --> 01:42:50,201
Today l will turn him into 50.

1773
01:42:50,807 --> 01:42:53,401
Because of his deceit
l have lost half of my land.

1774
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:55,937
Neither did people get my cassettes...

1775
01:42:56,046 --> 01:42:57,946
...nor did l get famous.
Let go of me. Let go

1776
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,683
Happy now?
- Hey, man.

1777
01:43:01,818 --> 01:43:02,910
What do you mean?

1778
01:43:03,486 --> 01:43:04,817
Happy about what?
- Don't fight, man.

1779
01:43:04,988 --> 01:43:07,684
Happy about what?
l told you, nothing would happen.

1780
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:09,455
Oh no.

1781
01:43:10,894 --> 01:43:12,088
You slapped me?

1782
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,425
l won't spare you today.
- You...

1783
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,024
lt hurts.

1784
01:43:20,503 --> 01:43:22,733
Hey, don't pull my hair. lt hurts.

1785
01:43:22,806 --> 01:43:24,865
You too come on.
- You...

1786
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:41,622
The journey would be
pleasant with your company.

1787
01:43:42,559 --> 01:43:47,997
We will reach the destiny,
if we are together.

1788
01:43:48,932 --> 01:43:55,201
We are followers of love.
We are...

1789
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:00,841
Param...

1790
01:44:04,214 --> 01:44:06,580
That is enough, buddy. Enough.

1791
01:44:09,519 --> 01:44:11,146
l, Prem Mittal...

1792
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:15,921
...used to think that
l am very strong.

1793
01:44:19,529 --> 01:44:22,054
But...but today,
even l have shattered.

1794
01:44:24,534 --> 01:44:26,695
That is enough, Param. Enough.

1795
01:44:28,037 --> 01:44:28,833
Enough.

1796
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:35,000
Hi, Param. How are you?

1797
01:44:35,778 --> 01:44:36,802
Feeling better?

1798
01:44:37,847 --> 01:44:40,680
Param will get better
faster after having this tonic.

1799
01:44:46,055 --> 01:44:46,749
Param.

1800
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:48,552
Param.

1801
01:44:54,697 --> 01:44:55,857
Put it in this.

1802
01:45:04,807 --> 01:45:08,174
May God always keep
your love and friendship.

1803
01:45:08,878 --> 01:45:12,439
Param, you have such nice friends.

1804
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:15,480
You cannot be ill-fated.

1805
01:45:15,718 --> 01:45:19,484
Make me your friend once you get well.

1806
01:45:20,723 --> 01:45:23,749
So? You will, won't you?

1807
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:28,188
Hello.
- Hi.

1808
01:45:28,431 --> 01:45:29,864
My name is S.K. Malhotra.

1809
01:45:30,233 --> 01:45:32,463
l had fixed today's
appointment with you.

1810
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:33,498

l have read your proposal.

1812
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,737
lt is a very nice proposal.
- Thank you.

1813
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:41,169
lt is good that our
college's band will...

1814
01:45:41,244 --> 01:45:43,508
...get a chance to reach
the international level. - Yes.

1815
01:45:43,813 --> 01:45:45,144
Good.
- Yes. Right.

1816
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,778
Our company, Batra Showbiz...

1817
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:52,147
...will make your college band
compete with other college bands.

1818
01:45:52,822 --> 01:45:54,949
The winning band will get
Rs. 1 crore as the prize money.

1819
01:45:55,124 --> 01:45:58,059
They will get a chance to
give music for our new movie...

1820
01:45:58,394 --> 01:45:59,861
...'Rabba lshq Na Hove'.

1821
01:45:59,996 --> 01:46:03,693
And we will launch
your band internationally.

1822
01:46:03,933 --> 01:46:06,424
Very good.
That is very good.

1823
01:46:06,502 --> 01:46:07,969
lt feels good to hear that.
- Yes.

1824
01:46:08,137 --> 01:46:10,765
But Mr. Malhotra,
keep one thing in mind.

1825
01:46:11,441 --> 01:46:14,569
l don't want any swindling
taking place in our college...

1826
01:46:14,644 --> 01:46:15,133
Yes.

1827
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:17,042
...which might ruin
our college's reputation.

1828
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,647
You don't worry at all.

1829
01:46:18,881 --> 01:46:20,849
Everything will
happen in front of you.

1830
01:46:20,917 --> 01:46:22,509
And it will be legal.

1831
01:46:22,685 --> 01:46:24,949
Very good. Then
consider this deal fixed.

1832
01:46:25,822 --> 01:46:27,653
Thank you so much.
- You are welcome.

1833
01:46:29,425 --> 01:46:31,416
lt would have been great
if the Pure Punjabi guys...

1834
01:46:31,494 --> 01:46:33,189
...would have been in
our college now.

1835
01:46:33,563 --> 01:46:35,758
Yes perhaps it may be.

1836
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,591
We will all to to see.

1837
01:46:39,836 --> 01:46:42,737
Yes, we'll go.
- C'mon.

1838
01:46:56,853 --> 01:46:57,683
Hello.

1839
01:47:07,196 --> 01:47:10,097
Your friendship is
greater than your lie.

1840
01:47:13,436 --> 01:47:15,563
Make your friendship your strength.

1841
01:47:17,573 --> 01:47:18,767
l have found...

1842
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:22,143
...a way for your dream.

1843
01:47:24,847 --> 01:47:27,782
Come on, boys.
You are still my students.

1844
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:37,088
l want you to win this competition...

1845
01:47:38,094 --> 01:47:39,789
...and fulfil your dream.

1846
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:43,632
l will talk to your parents.

1847
01:47:44,934 --> 01:47:45,628
Okay?

1848
01:47:49,472 --> 01:47:50,131
Hello.

1849
01:47:52,608 --> 01:47:53,632
All the best.

1850
01:47:56,646 --> 01:47:58,739
Look, Param.
Look at this.

1851
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:00,979
The doorstep to our dream.

1852
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:05,045
We will cross this and
rule the world, Param.

1853
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:07,986
Today, we need your song...

1854
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:11,393
...which you used to say would
be sung by the world one day.

1855
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:13,160
Yes, Param. Write.

1856
01:48:13,563 --> 01:48:15,724
Look, one doesn't get
such opportunities often.

1857
01:48:15,965 --> 01:48:18,399
God has sent us this opportunity.

1858
01:48:19,802 --> 01:48:20,769
He won't write.

1859
01:48:21,104 --> 01:48:23,504
He is still angry because
we used to make fun of him.

1860
01:48:24,741 --> 01:48:29,440
Look, Param, if not for us,
write for your father.

1861
01:48:29,846 --> 01:48:32,406
He...he is regretting it.

1862
01:48:32,749 --> 01:48:34,410
For how long will you punish us?

1863
01:48:34,684 --> 01:48:36,151
Get up. Write.

1864
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:39,578
Look, one doesn't get
such opportunities often.

1865
01:48:39,922 --> 01:48:41,082
What do you think?

1866
01:48:41,657 --> 01:48:43,522
We will always endure your tantrums?

1867
01:48:43,893 --> 01:48:47,420
Look, Param...if we get angry...

1868
01:48:48,765 --> 01:48:50,960
...you will never get
friends like us again.

1869
01:49:14,223 --> 01:49:15,554
Here you go, son.

1870
01:49:23,232 --> 01:49:27,498
l took away these songs
and the pen from you, right?

1871
01:49:30,173 --> 01:49:32,073
Write, son. Write.

1872
01:49:33,743 --> 01:49:36,211
Write down all your desires.

1873
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,072
l won't stop you.

1874
01:49:47,557 --> 01:49:49,491
Write, son. Write.

1875
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:19,952
We have started
walking on the path of life.

1876
01:50:20,022 --> 01:50:24,015
Our desires found light.

1877
01:50:27,797 --> 01:50:35,465
Let everyone know.
We will now touch the sky.

1878
01:50:35,538 --> 01:50:37,267
We have found a new life.

1879
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:39,133
The dark night ended
and the new day has come.

1880
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:42,507
We have found a new life.

1881
01:50:42,945 --> 01:50:46,472
We will...
- Reach our destination.

1882
01:50:46,649 --> 01:50:50,176
We will...
- Fulfil our desires.

1883
01:50:50,419 --> 01:50:54,048
We will...
- Not get disappointed.

1884
01:50:54,123 --> 01:50:58,423
We will...
- Now have fun.

1885
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:06,829
We will...

1886
01:51:09,538 --> 01:51:10,903
We will...

1887
01:51:13,843 --> 01:51:17,609
Our heart has seen new light.

1888
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:22,174
We are confident we will win.

1889
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:29,123
We have no fear or worries.

1890
01:51:29,191 --> 01:51:32,922
We will win the world.
Let everyone hear this.

1891
01:51:32,995 --> 01:51:34,895
Hold my hand, my friend.

1892
01:51:34,964 --> 01:51:36,829
Let us walk towards
our destination now.

1893
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:40,096
Hold my hand, my friend.

1894
01:51:40,169 --> 01:51:44,003
We will...
- Reach our destination.

1895
01:51:44,073 --> 01:51:47,873
We will...
- Fulfil our desires.

1896
01:51:47,944 --> 01:51:51,710
We will...
- Not get disappointed.

1897
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:55,842
We will...
- Now have fun.

1898
01:52:01,791 --> 01:52:03,952
l am happy with your loyalty,
Naseebchand.

1899
01:52:04,894 --> 01:52:07,727
Don't worry.
Let them come.

1900
01:52:09,065 --> 01:52:11,533
l have a solution to them.

1901
01:52:12,635 --> 01:52:13,727
l have a solution to them.

1902
01:52:13,803 --> 01:52:15,862
l didn't know we had to.
- Watch out! - Hey! - Oh no.

1903
01:52:17,006 --> 01:52:17,734
Hey!

1904
01:52:18,174 --> 01:52:19,573
What is it? Do you wish to die?

1905
01:52:19,642 --> 01:52:21,200
Couldn't you park
the car at a corner?

1906
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:35,450
Prem, that's Kabir.
- Yes.

1907
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,524
What is this?

1908
01:52:46,168 --> 01:52:47,726
You know today is the
day of the competition.

1909
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:49,464
We haven't done anything as yet.

1910
01:52:50,072 --> 01:52:51,096
But we will, now.

1911
01:52:51,941 --> 01:52:56,469
l thought we should compete
a little before the competition.

1912
01:52:56,612 --> 01:52:58,546
We would have
fulfilled this wish of yours...

1913
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:00,608
...but we are falling
short of time, today.

1914
01:53:00,683 --> 01:53:03,481
Not just time, you are
also falling short of life.

1915
01:53:03,853 --> 01:53:06,686
Look, Kabir, it is not
nice to say such things.

1916
01:53:06,922 --> 01:53:10,153
You have hardly seen anything yet.

1917
01:53:10,626 --> 01:53:12,025
You won't change, will you?

1918
01:53:13,062 --> 01:53:15,462
lf you are thinking of fighting...

1919
01:53:16,565 --> 01:53:18,829
...then remember
l know how to fight back.

1920
01:53:20,036 --> 01:53:23,699
Son, l think l will have
to take care of you first.

1921
01:53:23,939 --> 01:53:25,839
Come here, band player.

1922
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:48,391
Other college's teams have
performed before Kapil Batra.

1923
01:53:48,597 --> 01:53:50,531
Now it is our college's turn.

1924
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:55,566
The team performing first
is called Hell's Angels.

1925
01:54:03,145 --> 01:54:08,139
l've loved you real

1926
01:54:18,727 --> 01:54:26,566
You spoiled me.

1927
01:54:37,179 --> 01:54:42,082
l won't without you.

1928
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:13,742
You spoiled me.

1929
01:55:31,033 --> 01:55:33,228
This was our
college's first performance.

1930
01:55:33,636 --> 01:55:36,070
Now it is Fire and lce Band's turn.

1931
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:38,106
That is Kabir's band.

1932
01:55:45,681 --> 01:55:47,046
Where is Pure Punjabi Band?

1933
01:55:47,483 --> 01:55:48,973
l can't see Kabir anywhere either.

1934
01:55:50,953 --> 01:55:52,818
l will just go and check, sir.

1935
01:55:58,060 --> 01:55:59,550
l will call for them twice.

1936
01:55:59,628 --> 01:56:02,188
Kabir and his friends,
wherever you are come on the stage.

1937
01:56:02,464 --> 01:56:04,432
Otherwise they will get disqualified.

1938
01:56:06,869 --> 01:56:08,564
Please. l am calling
for them once again.

1939
01:56:08,637 --> 01:56:11,629
Kabir and his friends, wherever
you are please come on the stage.

1940
01:56:40,803 --> 01:56:44,830
My Jugni's knots are strong.
Jugni cuts the thread...

1941
01:56:44,907 --> 01:56:46,738
Jugni cuts the
thread with her teeth.

1942
01:56:46,809 --> 01:56:50,472
The one who...
The one who is in love...

1943
01:56:50,546 --> 01:56:52,377
My brother, my Jugni...

1944
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:54,581
Brother, Jugni says so.

1945
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:58,017
She chants Ali's name.
She chants Sai's name.

1946
01:56:58,487 --> 01:57:01,479
She chants Lord's name.

1947
01:57:19,608 --> 01:57:23,544
Speak.
Why aren't you speak.

1948
01:57:23,746 --> 01:57:25,543
Speak.
