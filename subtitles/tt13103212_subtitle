1
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,083
Oh, no!

2
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,375
<i>The person you are</i>
<i>calling is currently busy.</i>

3
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,208
<i>Please call again later.</i>

4
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,833
Hello?

5
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,916
<i>Hi, Alex.</i>

6
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,583
<i>Sorry. I was busy with the calls.</i>

7
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>I have a hearing at the court tomorrow.</i>

8
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,666
That's okay. Where are you?

9
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,416
<i>I'm at the office now.</i>

10
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,125
<i>I have to handle the clients myself</i>
<i>since sir is not here.</i>

11
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,916
<i>Today's a nightmarish day, Alex.</i>

12
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,291
I woke up because of a nightmare.

13
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,916
I've been calling you since then,
but you didn't answer the call.

14
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,625
<i>What nightmare are you talking about?</i>

15
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,583
I'm trying to forget it myself.

16
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,500
<i>Tell me!</i>

17
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,541
No! Let's not dwell on nightmares.

18
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,291
<i>Where are you now, Alex?</i>

19
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,208
I'm almost reaching at my office.

20
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,916
-Archana.
-<i>Yes.</i>

21
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,125
Are you free in the evening?
Can we meet?

22
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,166
<i>I will let you know.</i>

23
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,875
<i>Alex, I'm getting a call.</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

24
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,291
-<i>I'll call you back.</i>
-What time in the evening?

25
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,333
Hello?

26
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,041
Hello?

27
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,791
IRUL
ALEX PARAYIL.

28
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,291
-Alex, right?
-Yes.

29
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,625
Can I get your autograph, sir?

30
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,125
Your novel is selling like hot cakes, sir.

31
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,875
Then, why are so many copies still here?

32
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,541
-Can I get a pen?
-Pen…

33
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,416
What's your next book, sir?

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,583
-I'm still planning on the same.
-Okay.

35
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,083
Do you need any help, sir?
I work here.

36
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,541
-Can you make a bill of these?
-Okay.

37
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,750
Thank you.

38
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,583
-Alex!
-Yes.

39
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,250
Sorry. I couldn't get out in time.
I had a lot of work to do.

40
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,375
That's alright.

41
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,333
I got bored. So, I came in here.

42
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,166
I was wondering why we're meeting here.

43
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,916
Since you're here, let me
buy you a copy of <i>Irul</i>.

44
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,000
I've ordered my copy, Alex.

45
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,916
I'll read it once I get free.

46
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,125
I'll read it when it's just the two of us.

47
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
That's what you've been telling me.

48
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,583
If not a copy, then, how about a coffee?

49
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,125
-What do you think?
-Why not?

50
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,250
Come.

51
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,666
I'll just pay the bill.

52
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,541
After you.

53
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,625
Ma'am, your cappuccino.

54
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,041
-Sir, yours.
-Thank you.

55
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,083
You're welcome.

56
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,750
You seem to have a lot of fans, Alex.

57
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,291
Hello.

58
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,958
Yes. The case was called,
but it was adjourned.

59
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,750
So, the next hearing is on the 23rd.

60
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,666
Hello?

61
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,833
Yes.

62
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,458
Hello?

63
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,666
Just a minute.

64
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,333
Okay.

65
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,666
Bring the required documents
to the office now.

66
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,583
No. We'll be filing for
one more stay order.

67
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,958
Okay.

68
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,041
You can sign it when
you bring the documents.

69
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,875
Okay. Call me if you need any help.

70
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,666
Sorry!

71
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,083
You look restless, Alex.

72
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,750
Really?
Why do you say so?

73
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,375
It's become a regular habit now for you

74
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,041
to wake up in shock from your nightmare.

75
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,166
I don't know why but
I'm unable to sleep alone.

76
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,916
Really?

77
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,250
Wouldn't that be a problem?

78
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,875
You have zero plans to help me, right?

79
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,166
Of course, I'll help.
That's why I am here!

80
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,208
What was your nightmare about?

81
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,625
I'd rather not talk about it.
It was disturbing.

82
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,750
You know, they say that…

83
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,125
dreams are certain chapters from the
novel that our soul is writing about us.

84
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,125
Since you write about dark subjects,
you're bound to have nightmares, right?

85
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,375
I would suggest you read my novel
and then give your opinion.

86
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,916
I said that I'll read it.

87
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,791
You've been saying
that for a long time now.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,208
Actually, the reason I'm here is for…

89
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,125
I was thinking…

90
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,416
-Hello?
-<i>Hi.</i>

91
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,541
Yes.

92
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,791
No.

93
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
No.

94
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,791
Sir is on leave, but I'll be there.
I'll handle it.

95
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,125
No. Everything is sorted, so…

96
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,125
There won't be any problem.

97
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,375
Alex.

98
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,416
No, sir.

99
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,916
Yeah.

100
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,541
Okay.

101
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,375
Okay. I'll call you if there's anything.

102
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,875
<i>Alex?</i>

103
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,500
<i>Yes.</i>

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,208
You're upset with me, right?

105
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,500
No.

106
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,583
What's up?

107
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,708
I know you're upset.

108
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,125
What can I do, Alex?

109
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,416
This is my job!

110
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,666
You know how it works.

111
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,041
You've seen how busy
I was during your case.

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,958
It's okay.

113
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,291
You can call me once you're free.

114
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,000
And even if you don't, it's alright.

115
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,541
Alex, it's been a month
since I had a break.

116
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,666
I'll be free by the next week.

117
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,833
<i>Then I'm fully yours, okay?</i>

118
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,250
I'll be with you the whole time.

119
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,458
I assure you the same.

120
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,625
Promise?

121
00:09:58,875 --> 00:09:59,833
<i>Promise.</i>

122
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,583
We'll go somewhere?

123
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,541
Let's go somewhere far away.

124
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,416
Actually, that's why I wanted to meet you.

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,625
How about this weekend?

126
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
Like you said, just the two of us.

127
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,750
I'd love that!

128
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,750
I want to go somewhere without
phones or internet.

129
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,416
Don't carry your phone.

130
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:24,958
I can switch it off.

131
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,666
If you switch it off,
you can turn it back on.

132
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,750
But if you don't bring it…

133
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,375
Let's try it.

134
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,708
I won't carry my phone as well.

135
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,791
Okay, fine.

136
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,250
Thank you.

137
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,750
Are you still upset?

138
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,541
<i>A little less.</i>

139
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,583
By the way…

140
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,291
I have a surprise for you.

141
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
Surprise?

142
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,666
What is it?

143
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,291
You'll come to know about it.

144
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,208
I'll plan the rest and let you know.

145
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,375
Okay.

146
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,875
Okay.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,125
-Good night.
-<i>Good night.</i>

148
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,416
-Okay.
-<i>Bye.</i>

149
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,125
-Bye!
-<i>Bye!</i>

150
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,375
Alex…

151
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,166
Alex!

152
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,791
Yes.

153
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,916
Where are we going?

154
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
It won't be a surprise anymore
if I reveal it.

155
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,875
What are you looking for?

156
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,625
I am checking if I carried my phone.

157
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,833
Did you?

158
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,166
This is a good idea.

159
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,250
A weekend getaway.

160
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,166
A holiday mood.

161
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,750
No work! No internet!

162
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,166
No cell phone!

163
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,916
No cell phone!

164
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,125
Just you and me!

165
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,916
You're always busy on your phone.

166
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,833
So, I had to make a plan like this.

167
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,666
You convinced me pretty well.

168
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,833
It wasn't so easy.

169
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,708
I've been planning this for a while now.

170
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Alex…

171
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,291
Do you miss me?

172
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,625
The car…

173
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, no!

174
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,916
Forest, rain, a broken down car…

175
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,875
So, was this your surprise?

176
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,708
Come on!

177
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,583
-Come on!
-Don't break the car!

178
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,041
Let me try.

179
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,541
To break it?

180
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Alex?

181
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,708
I was just getting the umbrella.

182
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,875
I'll go and check.

183
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,416
-You're drenched.
-Yes, a little.

184
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,083
Are there any more surprises?

185
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,416
Yes.

186
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,833
I don't think I'll be able to fix it.

187
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,583
We'll have to call a mechanic.

188
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,750
But, how will we call?
We don't have our phones.

189
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,833
Shit!

190
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,666
We don't have our phones!

191
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,208
I can see a light there.
Looks like a house.

192
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,291
-Yeah.
-Right?

193
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,083
Shall we go there and ask for help?

194
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,958
Should we?

195
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
If there's someone in the
house, we can make a call, right?

196
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,416
What if there is no one?

197
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, it's not going to
start on its own, right?

198
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,750
-Not really.
-Then, let's go.

199
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,250
Well…

200
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,458
Archana! What happened?

201
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,625
My leg!

202
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,750
Are you hurt?

203
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,166
No, I'm fine.

204
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,375
Hello?

205
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,041
Hello?

206
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,500
Alex!

207
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,875
Nothing! Just kidding!

208
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,708
Don't scare me, Alex.

209
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,041
See?

210
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,291
That's enough!

211
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,541
There's no one in here.

212
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,458
Stop it.

213
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,875
There's no one here.

214
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,958
I hope there are no dogs here.

215
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,833
Let me check.

216
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,666
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

217
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,041
Wait. I'll be right back.

218
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,041
-Alex!
-You scared me!

219
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,250
Come.

220
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,833
Let's go back to the car.

221
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,333
Give me a moment.

222
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,875
People living in such houses
generally keep the keys here.

223
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Right?

224
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,041
Let me check.

225
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,583
There's nothing here.

226
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,750
What are you doing?

227
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,125
I'm checking.

228
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,625
Shall we go?

229
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,166
Who are you? I mean… sorry.

230
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,291
Shouldn't I be asking that question?

231
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,750
After all, I'm on this side of the door.

232
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,416
Who are you?

233
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,500
Actually… our car broke down. So…

234
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,458
Can we use your mobile phone?

235
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,041
I don't have one.

236
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,958
What about a landline phone?

237
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,750
In this weather, even that…

238
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,666
If you don't mind, can we try?

239
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I do mind…

240
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,583
but you're welcome to try.

241
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,708
This way.

242
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,083
Close the door.

243
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,333
Okay.

244
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,625
It's dead.

245
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,333
Can we wait here till it stops raining?

246
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,916
Sure, why not.

247
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,125
Do you need dry clothes?

248
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,833
No, it's okay. I'll manage.

249
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:34,458
You can change if you want.
I mean, you're drenched.

250
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,458
Do you…

251
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:38,916
There's a room upstairs.

252
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,750
Go ahead.

253
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:44,916
Okay.

254
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,291
Thanks for the clothes.

255
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,791
Thank you.

256
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,125
-Is it working?
-No.

257
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,416
We'll try again once the rain subsides.

258
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,500
Whose dress is this?

259
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It belongs to my mother.

260
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,541
Where is your mother?

261
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,791
She's dead.

262
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,958
We rarely see people who don't
use mobile phones these days.

263
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,666
So, when you said
you don't use one…

264
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,541
Is that a crime?

265
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,625
No. I didn't mean that.

266
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,416
It's just surprising.

267
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,708
I tried using it once.

268
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,041
I couldn't get accustomed to it.

269
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,166
So, do you stay here alone?

270
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,125
Nice house. How many…

271
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,416
As your host,

272
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,041
I reserve the right to ask you
the questions.

273
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:11,416
And as my guests, I'm more
than excited to hear your answers.

274
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,458
So, I'll ask the questions.

275
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,875
What's your name?

276
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,458
Archana.

277
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,125
Just Archana?

278
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,625
Archana Pillai.

279
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,583
Archana…

280
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,916
You're not a married couple, right?

281
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,166
Why do you say so?

282
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,208
It's just an observation.

283
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,875
Moreover…

284
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,541
you haven't known
each other for that long.

285
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:42,708
At the most… two or three months.

286
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:45,958
Three months.

287
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,333
How did you know?

288
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:48,875
Observation.

289
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:51,833
The space between you two…

290
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,083
makes it clear.

291
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,416
Apart from going on
trips with your boyfriend…

292
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,541
do you do anything else?

293
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,125
Yes.

294
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,791
I'm a lawyer at the High Court.

295
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,833
Really?

296
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,166
People who convert
lies to truth for a living.

297
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,041
Do you have something against lawyers?

298
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,666
Not against lawyers…

299
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,416
but against lies.

300
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:24,291
Whether something is a lie or
truth, the court decides, not the lawyers.

301
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,416
Nor does the public
have the right to say it.

302
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,875
Your truth could be a lie
for someone else, right?

303
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:33,916
I don't understand.

304
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,583
See…

305
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:39,458
something that is common
between truth and lies are facts.

306
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:43,083
Lawyers try to bring forth those facts!

307
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you saying that there's no
difference between truth and lies?

308
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
There is!

309
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,208
One can say the whole truth.

310
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,125
But not a complete lie.

311
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,750
There is some truth in every lie.

312
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,208
Do you agree to that…

313
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,291
Mr. Alex?

314
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,250
Yes.

315
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,375
Why?

316
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,958
Lies are the masks all use
to hide the truth…

317
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,041
right?

318
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,041
-Impressive!
-Thank you.

319
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,458
Are you also a lawyer?

320
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,916
No. I'm not a lawyer.

321
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,208
I'm a writer.

322
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,208
Are you a writer?

323
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,291
Yes.

324
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,041
Tonight's guests are quite exceptional.

325
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,125
Alex…

326
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,041
Parayil. Alex Parayil.

327
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,791
I might have read it if
it's a Malayalam book.

328
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,458
It's a Malayalam book.

329
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,583
But you may not have read it, sir.

330
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,458
I've written only one book.

331
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,375
And it was published very recently.

332
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,916
What's the name of your novel?

333
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,708
<i>Irul.</i>

334
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:52,916
<i>Irul.</i>

335
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,208
Darkness.

336
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,458
Absence of light.

337
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,166
Did you have the courage
to read his novel, Archana?

338
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,708
No.

339
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,833
You won't believe me when I say this.

340
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,625
I've had the courage…

341
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,083
and good fortune of reading it.

342
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,875
You've read it?

343
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,041
Definitely.

344
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,125
What did you think?
What's your opinion?

345
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,708
Nothing. I have a very bad opinion.

346
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,000
What's your opinion about wine, Archana?

347
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,083
Wine?

348
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,583
Very good opinion.

349
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,291
You can help yourself.

350
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,541
What's your poison?

351
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,625
Whiskey.

352
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:46,833
Why did you say so?

353
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,125
-What?
-That you have a bad opinion.

354
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,416
That character in your novel…

355
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,000
The serial killer?

356
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,333
Yes.

357
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,666
Your novel is based on the murder
which happened several years ago, right?

358
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,833
Yes.

359
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,291
It was all over the news back then.

360
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,208
May I make a criticism?

361
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:05,750
With your permission?

362
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,416
In your opinion…

363
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,416
the six murders that he committed…

364
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,583
Not six.

365
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,791
Five murders.

366
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,500
-Five murders.
-Yes.

367
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,250
What was the motive
behind those murders?

368
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,416
Vengeance.

369
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,666
Against whom?

370
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,833
Against women.

371
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,416
Vengeance against women.

372
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,125
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

373
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,500
All five victims… were women.

374
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,666
They were brutally tortured.

375
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,208
Apart from that, their hair.

376
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,833
He had shaved off the
hair of all five women.

377
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,583
And to go to such lengths,

378
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,416
what else could it be, other
than vengeance or hatred?

379
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,625
Maybe.

380
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,666
But the motive behind his vengeance…

381
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,250
is not clear in your novel.

382
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,541
And I have a keen
interest in psychology.

383
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,541
Thank you.

384
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,625
That's my mother.

385
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,083
In vino veritas.

386
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,916
Wine makes you speak the truth.

387
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,000
Mr. Alex…

388
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,083
psychologically speaking, there
are shortcomings in your novel.

389
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,458
The motivation of
the killer is not clear.

390
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,416
First of all, it's a crime thriller.

391
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,166
Not a psychological thriller.

392
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,500
It's clear in the novel that
the motive is vengeance.

393
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,958
None of the readers
had an issue with it.

394
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,583
Mr. Alex…

395
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,333
a conversation with an
upcoming writer like you,

396
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,458
is something I've
been looking forward to.

397
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,000
I have certain notions.

398
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,833
That killer in your novel…

399
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,875
can be any one of us.

400
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,541
If so… their voices shouldn't go unheard.

401
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,250
If vengeance against women is
the motive behind those murders,

402
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:26,125
you must make it clear.

403
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,125
Humiliation.

404
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,583
Humiliation from women.

405
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,583
That's possible.

406
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,250
Apart from vengeance, there
could be other motives as well.

407
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,250
What are those other motives?

408
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,583
Curiosity.

409
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:56,666
Inquisitiveness.

410
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,041
About the female body.

411
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,250
About their psyche.

412
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,916
I read about these
murders in the newspapers.

413
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,708
And then, in your novel.

414
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:09,750
As per my understanding…

415
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,541
the motive behind the
murders is not vengeance.

416
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,083
It is curiosity.

417
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:22,041
I don't think curiosity
can make a person kill someone.

418
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,875
What if it's a sexual problem?

419
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,708
No.

420
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,125
None of the victims were raped.

421
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,541
Nor was there any
indication of sexual assault.

422
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,125
In this case, that's not a motive.

423
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:37,958
Then, what was the motive?

424
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,916
I wrote this novel after
an in-depth research.

425
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,833
My research hasn't gone wrong.

426
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,833
What kind of research have you done?

427
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,000
As per the forensic reports,

428
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,375
those women died after
bleeding profusely for several days.

429
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,916
That means, the intention
was not just to kill them,

430
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,208
but to hurt them.

431
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,125
There were cuts of all
sizes on their bodies,

432
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,291
made with blades and knives.

433
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,375
There were marks of rope
on their bodies.

434
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,583
That proves that they were
tied up and hung.

435
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,166
They were killed slowly and painfully.

436
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,708
Curiosity-- No!

437
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,625
This is madness.

438
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,375
Is the killer a mad man now?

439
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,416
Definitely.

440
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,208
One who murdered five women…

441
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,708
and evaded being captured by the police…

442
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,083
is he just a mad man?

443
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,333
An intelligent mad man!

444
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:28,958
I think he's brilliant.

445
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,291
Alright.

446
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,625
If so, what should be done with him?

447
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,291
What does the law say?

448
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,666
What do we know about the
circumstances that drive a person to kill?

449
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,708
We can only imagine their state of mind.

450
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,375
I think these people have to be studied.

451
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:53,791
And…

452
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,583
that knowledge should
be used for their treatment.

453
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,333
I misjudged you, Ms. Archana.

454
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,083
Now, I have much to
look forward from you.

455
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,083
I apologize for what I said earlier.

456
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,208
But in Alex's novel…

457
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,000
that murderer is killed at the end.

458
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:16,833
Am I right?

459
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,958
If a patient has cancer,
should he be killed?

460
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,250
Sometimes, the cancerous
parts are chopped off.

461
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,916
My intention was that such people
should be eliminated from the society.

462
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,250
How can that be done?

463
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:39,833
They should be killed.

464
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:42,916
Stop it, Alex.

465
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:44,958
He's just joking.

466
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,375
After all, he's a writer.

467
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,125
His imagination runs a bit wild.

468
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,333
That's the thing.

469
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,458
Imagination!

470
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,166
That's exactly what
I didn't like in Alex's novel.

471
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,791
How can someone write a
story without imagination?

472
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:06,958
Experience!

473
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,791
All artistic creations are born…

474
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,458
out of experience.

475
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,208
So, you're saying that…

476
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,833
if Alex is writing about a killer,

477
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,833
then, he should be a killer himself?

478
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Absolutely.

479
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,958
At least, he should understand
the killer's state of mind.

480
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,666
May I ask you something, Alex?

481
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,291
Is writing your bread and butter?

482
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,250
No. Writing is a passion.

483
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,666
I have a business.

484
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:39,833
What kind of business?

485
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,625
Hospitality.

486
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:42,750
Tourism.

487
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,500
He's the owner of FEESAN
Group of Companies.

488
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:50,916
Partner.

489
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,500
May I ask you something else?

490
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,625
Despite having another
source of income,

491
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:02,666
you became a
writer, to satisfy your curiosity.

492
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,500
Couldn't it be the same for a killer?

493
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,250
Like an artist…

494
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,750
for self-fulfillment?

495
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,041
Like a sculptor…

496
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,875
carving a sculpture from stone?

497
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,750
We've been talking for so long.

498
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,916
You haven't introduced yourself yet.

499
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,541
Who are you?

500
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,125
-Alex?
-Yes.

501
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,458
Archana?

502
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,958
Why do you have so many candles in here?

503
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,041
I am afraid of the dark.

504
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:26,583
Where's the main switch?

505
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:28,958
I don't know.

506
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,750
Really?

507
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,625
I don't even know
where the kitchen is.

508
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,125
I have servants to do all my work.

509
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,083
Do you have a torch?
We can look for the main switch.

510
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,333
Is there a basement?

511
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,958
Yes. I don't go there.

512
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:50,958
I think the main switch could be there.

513
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,875
Shall we go and check?

514
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,208
I'll be right back.

515
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,625
Alex?

516
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:35,916
Alex?

517
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:38,916
Alex!

518
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:49,708
Alex?

519
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
Alex?

520
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,500
Alex!

521
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,416
Alex!

522
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,250
Actually…

523
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,666
What happened to him, Alex?

524
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,750
Archana, move!

525
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,125
Alex, what's going on?

526
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,208
Alex!

527
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,125
What happened to him, Alex?

528
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,541
Are you okay?

529
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,833
Alex, was that a gunshot?

530
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,458
Alex!

531
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:38,833
Alex!

532
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,250
Alex!

533
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,166
Alex, what's going on?

534
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:45,916
Alex!

535
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,458
Alex, just say something!

536
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,333
What was that sound, Alex?

537
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:02,791
Alex!

538
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,250
Alex, what happened to him?

539
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,083
Alex!

540
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,375
Alex, what are you doing?

541
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:35,958
Alex, where are you going?

542
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,083
Alex!

543
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,166
Alex!

544
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:21,833
Alex!

545
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,416
Alex, what are you doing?

546
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,666
I won't let you get away.

547
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,250
Alex!

548
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,625
He killed…

549
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,875
He killed a woman in the basement.

550
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,000
She was hung…

551
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:04,833
She was hung there.

552
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,625
There are cuts all over her body.

553
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,041
Her head was shaved.

554
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,583
Alex, are you saying that…

555
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,041
Yes! He is that killer!

556
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,458
He killed those five women!

557
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,250
Alex, let's get out of here.

558
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,041
Alex, let's call the police. Come on!

559
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,833
How? The phone is not working!

560
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,458
Alex, we should do something.

561
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:48,625
Alex!

562
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:13,916
Alex!

563
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,416
Where are you going, Archana?

564
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,166
You won't be able to bear that sight.

565
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,625
Alex, please let's just do something.

566
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,458
Whom do we call in
the middle of nowhere?

567
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,375
Don't hurt me, sir.

568
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,500
Please untie me, Sir. I'll leave.

569
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:17,916
I won't tell anyone what happened here.

570
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Untie me, sir.

571
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,083
I'll leave.

572
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,750
What will you not say?

573
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,458
Sister!

574
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,083
You're the one who
killed those five women.

575
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,041
He did it.

576
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,375
Do you think you can get away
by blabbering nonsense?

577
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,833
I will put an end to this!

578
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:46,958
Alex, let's call the police. Come on!

579
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,791
I told you that the phone is dead!

580
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,083
The phone isn't dead.

581
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:53,750
The phone isn't dead.

582
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:58,208
I had disconnected the wire.

583
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,166
Untie me, sir. I'll leave.

584
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,458
Please untie me, sir.

585
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,416
It's working.

586
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,583
Alex, what are you doing?

587
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,000
You can't call the police.

588
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,000
Why did you disconnect the call?

589
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:34,625
You can't call the police.

590
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,833
I want to know what's happening here.

591
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,500
Alex will be in trouble if
the police arrives here.

592
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,208
He knows that!

593
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,333
At least you untie me.
I'll leave.

594
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,250
Untie me. Please!

595
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Alex!

596
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,416
Alex!

597
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:04,500
Just listen to me.

598
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:05,625
Let me explain.

599
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,083
If the cops arrive, I will be in trouble.

600
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:12,708
But why, Alex?

601
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,000
This is my house.

602
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,291
This…

603
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,250
This is my house, Archana.

604
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,208
Stop joking, Alex. It's not funny.

605
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:30,541
This house was the weekend
surprise I told you about.

606
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,500
I thought I'll tell you
after reaching here.

607
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:33,958
I swear!

608
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,166
If this is your house, then, who is he?

609
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,791
I am a thief, sister.

610
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:43,583
I broke in to steal.

611
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:46,166
I didn't know this was his house.

612
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,958
Please untie me, sister. I will leave.

613
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:55,833
Then, the car…

614
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,375
Why didn't you say
anything when you saw him?

615
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,166
I got scared seeing a
stranger in my house.

616
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,791
And I wanted to know who
he is and why he's here.

617
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,875
It may sound foolish to you.

618
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:17,833
I thought I could get
an idea for my next story.

619
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,625
Now you've got an entire novel!

620
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:22,416
Archana!

621
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,750
Untie me, sister.

622
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,250
Set me free.

623
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:27,041
-Untie me, sister.
-Don't do it.

624
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,541
Archana…

625
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,083
What were you looking for over here?

626
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:40,583
Does that gun belong to you?

627
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:43,791
Yes, it's my gun.

628
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,083
What about the girl in the basement?

629
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:47,416
I don't know!

630
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,958
We have to call the cops!

631
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,333
We will tell them the truth!

632
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,208
They won't believe us.

633
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:55,291
This is my house.
And the murder happened here.

634
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,875
The shot was fired from my gun.

635
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,250
How are they going to believe us?

636
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:01,458
You're blurting out all the evidence
and claiming that you're innocent.

637
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:03,500
He is lying, sister!
Untie me!

638
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,583
Get lost, bugger!

639
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:06,625
Archana, believe me.

640
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,416
Archana, you know me!

641
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:09,958
Don't you trust me?

642
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:13,583
Won't you help me to
get out of this, Archana?

643
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
How?

644
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,416
I'll make him…

645
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:19,916
I'll make him say everything!

646
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,750
I will make him say it!

647
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,791
Get up!

648
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:28,666
I'll make him say it!

649
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,833
Sister, sir is trying to frame me.

650
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,708
I'm saying the truth.
I came here to steal.

651
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,458
I don't know about
anything that happens here.

652
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:37,250
Sir's the one who's lying.
Didn't he lie to bring you here?

653
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,458
Say it!

654
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:41,833
Say it!

655
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,375
Sister, you met him
three months ago, right?

656
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,500
I will make you confess.

657
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,250
I'll get it out of your mouth!

658
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,916
Alex, did you have your phone with you?

659
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:51,333
Alex, you asked me not to bring
my phone and brought yours?

660
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,125
We'll talk about it later.

661
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,416
-Untie me, sir.
-What else do you want to talk about?

662
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:58,833
I'll go, sir.

663
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,125
-Tell me.
-Untie me, sir. I'll go.

664
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,125
Why have you come here?

665
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,166
-I haven't done anything.
-You need to speak up!

666
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,750
-Why did you come to my house?
-Sister, please tell him.

667
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,625
-I came here to steal. Please understand.
-Alex!

668
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:06,833
-Who's that girl?
-Which girl?

669
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,041
-Who's that girl you killed downstairs?
-Alex!

670
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,375
-I swear, I came here to steal.
-Why are you--

671
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,041
-Why did you do this in my house?
-I don't know.

672
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,500
-Alex, this is your house!
-I am telling you, sister.

673
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,416
-Let me go, sir.
-You're not going anywhere.

674
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,666
-How many people have you killed?
-I haven't killed anyone.

675
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,250
-Alex, tell me what's going on!
-Stop it.

676
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:19,750
-I don't know, sir. I came here to steal.
-Don't lie to me!

677
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,000
What have you stolen from here?

678
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,833
-Only you would know, sir.
-Why did you bring me here, Alex?

679
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,458
-I don't know who that is.
-Tell me the truth!

680
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:26,916
-Shut up! Speak!
-Alex!

681
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,625
-I won't tell anyone anything.
-Sister, please tell him.

682
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,083
-What is he saying, Alex?
-First he said this isn't his house.

683
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,750
-I won't let you kill any woman!
-Now he's saying it is.

684
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,500
-You have to say it!
-I came here to steal!

685
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,125
-Listen to me, please!
-Tell me the truth!

686
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,833
I'm saying the truth!
The truth!

687
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:39,041
-That's the truth!
-No!

688
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:40,500
-You have a gun!
-I am telling the truth!

689
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:41,541
-I haven't killed anyone.
-Stop it!

690
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,458
-He killed her.
-Shut up!

691
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:43,958
-Will you shut up?
-I am telling the truth!

692
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,625
-Tell me what's going on.
-Sister!

693
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,333
-Ask him why he brought his phone!
-Tell me the truth!

694
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,166
-He lied that he didn't bring his phone.
-Alex!

695
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,416
-He's the one who's lying.
-Alex, whose body is it?

696
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,125
-The house, the phone! It's all a lie!
-Why did you come to my house?

697
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,833
-It is to trap you, sister. Sister!
-Alex!

698
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,833
-Escape from here, sister.
-How many people have you killed?

699
01:00:57,916 --> 01:01:00,250
I know you're planning to
kill her and blame it on me!

700
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:08,666
Yes. I'll kill her and then kill you!

701
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,958
I'll go only after killing you!

702
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,166
Sorry, sir. I said it by mistake.

703
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,333
Untie me, sir. I will go away.

704
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:16,041
-I won't tell anyone anything.
-I won't let you go.

705
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,500
I won't tell anyone, sir.

706
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,208
Sir!

707
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:20,625
Archana!

708
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:26,791
Archana!

709
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:34,791
Where is she?

710
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:39,875
-Archana!
-Sir!

711
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,291
Archana!

712
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,125
Archana!

713
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,041
Archana?

714
01:03:58,541 --> 01:03:59,500
Alex!

715
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:03,791
Why can't you understand
what I'm saying?

716
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,083
Didn't I tell you to not make calls?

717
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,625
Then, why are you doing that again?

718
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,291
He's not the kind of
person you think he is.

719
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:12,041
He killed all those women,
just like in my novel.

720
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,250
That too, in my house.

721
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,208
To trap me!

722
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,708
Why can't you understand?

723
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,000
If I hadn't come here, I
would've been framed for all this!

724
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:23,291
You're my only witness.

725
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,208
Why don't you understand?

726
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:29,750
Why aren't you saying anything?

727
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:43,916
Is this the problem?

728
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,041
Do whatever you want.

729
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,125
You can decide what you want to do.

730
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,375
Are you not going anywhere, sir?

731
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,958
Can I go, sir?

732
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Sister…

733
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,791
Untie me, sister.

734
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:26,375
You can stay here if you want.
Please let me escape!

735
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,791
Can I get a drink, sister?

736
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,625
Sister, a little more, please.

737
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:49,625
I don't know what he told
you when you were upstairs.

738
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,208
We should escape from here.

739
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:52,458
He can't be trusted.

740
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,708
What did you say?

741
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:54,666
-Alex!
-Sister.

742
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,000
-What are you saying?
-Alex!

743
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:57,541
Go there. I will ask him!

744
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,916
Go there, Alex.

745
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,208
Now, tell me.

746
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:06,541
Who are you?

747
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,625
I am a thief, sister.

748
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,583
-What's your name?
-Unni.

749
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:11,125
-What?
-Unni.

750
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,125
Oh!

751
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,250
Do you have any ID card?

752
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,250
Yeah, right! As if thieves
walk around with their ID cards.

753
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,708
Aren't you a lawyer?

754
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,416
People like us destroy
evidence, when we do such things.

755
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,625
Do you do it while stealing or killing?

756
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:29,708
If you're a thief,

757
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,166
why did you open the door for us?

758
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,375
In a moment of desperation,
I got stuck in front of you.

759
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:39,208
-Then, how long have you--
-Why are you asking me all the questions?

760
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,333
Ask him as well.

761
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,875
Ask him why he brought his phone!

762
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,041
To set an alarm.

763
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,000
To set the alarm for the surprise.

764
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,375
The surprise isn't over yet, sister.

765
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,458
Yes.

766
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:51,625
There is a surprise.

767
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,750
His phone's location shows
that he is here

768
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,041
and yours, at your home.

769
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:00,166
Everyone would assume that you're at home.

770
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,875
Did you tell anyone that
you were coming here?

771
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,250
I swear, I wanted this to be a surprise.

772
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:11,833
I brought you here to propose you.

773
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,708
Won't the ring fit if
you're holding the phone?

774
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:23,333
You came here to steal, right?

775
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,791
Aren't you a thief?

776
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,125
What were you going
to steal from here?

777
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,125
What did you steal from here?

778
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,791
-But you're enjoying after killing her.
-Alex, enough!

779
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:30,416
-What do you want to steal from here?
-Move, Alex!

780
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,166
-What did he steal from here?
-I will ask him!

781
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:36,208
Tell me!

782
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:44,958
What did you steal?

783
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,166
Isn't that what I asked?

784
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:49,708
Alex, you asked me to decide, right?

785
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,750
Now give me a chance to do it!
Let me handle it, Alex!

786
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:55,833
Go there!

787
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,791
For how long have you been here?

788
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:09,750
Around two to three hours.

789
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,250
So, you had the time to
search the entire place!

790
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,208
You must have gone
to the basement as well.

791
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:16,208
I did, but I didn't
enter since it was dark.

792
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:17,875
I'm afraid of the dark, sister.

793
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,333
You have an answer for everything!

794
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,208
Answer me! What did you steal?

795
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:27,791
Tell me.

796
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:30,666
I've stolen.

797
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:32,708
What?

798
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:35,833
Tell me.

799
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,375
I can't tell you what I've stolen.

800
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:44,208
I'm not going to believe you
unless you reveal it.

801
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:51,916
Call the police!

802
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:54,000
I'll tell the police what I've stolen.

803
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,541
So, Alex is right. You're lying!

804
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:59,625
I don't have to lie to you like him.

805
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,666
I've stolen something and it's right here.

806
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,708
Let the cops come.
Then I'll reveal it.

807
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,375
I've had enough of your games!

808
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,541
I will make you say it!

809
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:10,000
But he's right.

810
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:13,500
If you're innocent, why
can't the police come here?

811
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,125
I won't allow the police
to enter this house again.

812
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,541
Again?

813
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,333
My mother died in this house.

814
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,666
Ask him how she died, sister.

815
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:30,708
I'll tell you.

816
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,208
His mother was killed.

817
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,000
And the killer was never caught.

818
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,958
How do you know that?

819
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,083
Everyone knows his family's history!

820
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,541
Alex, stop it!

821
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:41,500
-Alex!
-Where is it?

822
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,500
-Where's the stuff you stole?
-Try to escape, sister.

823
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:44,500
-He's dangerous.
-Leave him!

824
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,708
-He'll be trapped if the cops come.
-Alex, leave him.

825
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,500
-Try to escape, sister.
-Alex, stop it!

826
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:49,625
-Sister!
-Leave him, Alex.

827
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,541
-You must say it.
-Alex, leave him!

828
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,416
-What did you steal? Where is it?
-Sister, save me!

829
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,208
-Alex, stop it!
-Don't you dare speak ill of my mother!

830
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,208
-Alex!
-What did you steal?

831
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:58,291
-Sister--
-Tell me!

832
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,833
Tell me what you stole, you scoundrel!

833
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:02,375
I told you, right?

834
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:03,875
-He has done everything! Believe me!
-Alex!

835
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,250
-Why don't you listen to me?
-Alex!

836
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,583
-I've been telling you for so long!
-Stop it!

837
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,875
-What more do I…
-I will tell you.

838
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,541
Now you know what the surprise is?

839
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,833
What's this?

840
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:43,833
Where did you get this from?

841
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
I stole it from here.

842
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,166
So, it must be yours, right?

843
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,000
Where did you steal this from?

844
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:55,791
Sister, now you know your surprise, right?

845
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:57,833
He is lying, sister.

846
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,125
Call the cops, sister!

847
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,291
Sister!

848
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:14,625
Sister!

849
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:18,625
Stop it!

850
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,250
I need to fucking know
what happened downstairs!

851
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:53,916
I slipped, sir.

852
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:10,875
He's lying, sister.

853
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,166
-He's speaking lies!
-Shut up!

854
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,250
You are saying that
there were two gunshots.

855
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,333
But I heard only one.

856
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,875
How's that possible? He shot twice!

857
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,333
That's not what happened, sister.

858
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:16,125
That's what happened
before I fell unconscious.

859
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,791
I don't know what
happened after that.

860
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,000
What if that girl is still alive?

861
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,041
Sister, don't send him alone down there!

862
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,916
He will kill that girl. Go with him!

863
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,958
Go!

864
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,375
Archana!

865
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:57,083
This…

866
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,750
She was alive until now.
She died just now.

867
01:18:02,916 --> 01:18:03,916
Yeah, right!

868
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,375
Didn't he stop you when
you tried to come here?

869
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:10,625
Archana!

870
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:11,708
Sir, don't hurt her.

871
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:12,791
-Sir!
-Archana!

872
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:14,208
Sir, please don't hurt her!

873
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,000
-Sir!
-Archana!

874
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,958
Sir, you can do whatever
you want to me. Let her go, sir.

875
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,083
Sir!

876
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,416
-Listen to me, sir.
-Get lost!

877
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:21,666
-Sir, listen to me.
-Move!

878
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,458
Archana!

879
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:24,708
Do you think-- Look!

880
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:26,375
-Look! Archana!
-Sir!

881
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,916
-Listen to me, sir. Let her go.
-Move away.

882
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,125
Look at me.

883
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,166
-Do you think I can do this?
-Listen to me, sir.

884
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,208
Move away!

885
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,666
-Archana, do you think I did this?
-Listen to me, sir.

886
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:35,750
You…

887
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:43,958
Alex!

888
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,791
I will make you say it!

889
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,541
I will kill you if you don't say it.

890
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:07,875
I will kill you! Tell me!

891
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,333
I will kill you! Tell me!

892
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,625
Tell me!

893
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:13,875
Tell me!

894
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:06,791
Had I been responsible for all this,

895
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,416
I wouldn't have
wasted time talking!

896
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,750
I had the gun with me!

897
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:11,041
I could have killed both of you!

898
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,375
He won't kill me, sister.

899
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:24,750
He kills only women.

900
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:28,791
Is that what you think?

901
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,833
Who said that I won't kill men?

902
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,500
Do you want to see me do it?

903
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,541
Shall I kill both of you?

904
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,125
Just like how you killed her!

905
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:41,833
Do you want to see it?

906
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,375
Tell me!

907
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,666
Don't come close.

908
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,208
Don't come close!

909
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:45,416
Don't come close!

910
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:51,625
Archana!

911
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,000
-Just listen to me.
-Alex, leave me.

912
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:55,166
Why are you doing this?

913
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:56,458
Leave me, Alex.

914
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:58,291
It will be sorted now.
We have to go, right?

915
01:25:58,875 --> 01:25:59,958
Go away!

916
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:02,875
Don't you know me? Just believe me!

917
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,666
Leave me!

918
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:07,000
-Archana, listen to me!
-Just go!

919
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,000
-Alex!
-Why are you behaving like this?

920
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,666
-Leave me!
-It's not what you think.

921
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:19,833
Archana…

922
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,291
Alex!

923
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,916
Alex!

924
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:47,625
Go!

925
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:53,791
Go!

926
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,333
Archana, go!

927
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:06,875
Archana.

928
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,041
Please…

929
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,541

Archana asked for…

931
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:41,666
is me.
