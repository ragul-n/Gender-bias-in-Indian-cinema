Criminals are not kept in jail
only for punishment .

14

''They are kept here , to realize''
their crime and repent for it .

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,300
''Rather than we improving you ,''

What happiness can this
illiterate man give you?

26
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,500
He doesn't have the ability
to earn a dime !

27

What happens in the night

43
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Great ! l felt you
kept these flowers for me .

44
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,300
'' The moon rises at a certain time ,''

We too must work
at fixed times .'

That's fine but
when will you have time for me?

lmportant things

00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,700
''As a servant of God ,''
it's my duty. . .

127
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,100
. . . to hear your confession
and request God to forgive you .

128

Tell me .

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200

l haven't done any sin till now.

131
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,300
But now l'm going to do 3 murders .

132
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,700
People come here to confess and
get forgiveness for their sins .

133
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,600
''But you're talking about the sin ,''
you're going to commit .

134
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
l didn't understand this .

135
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,700

136
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,100
. . . my feet should
stain this holy place .

137
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
l'm innocent now.

138
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,300
''But after today,''
l'll never come here .

139

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,800
''lf you kill a human being ,''
God willnever forgive you .

141
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,200
l'm not going to kill a human .

l'm going to remove the traces
of three beasts from this world .

143
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,200
At such a time . . .

144
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,100
. . . the call of my soul is more
intense than my religious duty.

145
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
l'm sure God will forgive me .

146
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,300
''As per the rel ig ious order, l must''

So l haven't seen

- Can't l do that much for you?

396
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,200
A hel pless man is trapped

. . . you want to take advantage
of him and t ear this lett er!

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,700
- You're right Sir. Don't let these

00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,900
You can't do anything you like !

405
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Give this lett er to a honest
inspector and get him arrest ed .

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,600
They are very dangerous .
Don't spare them !

407
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,200
This lett er is the only proof
you have . lsn't it?

408
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,300
Yes Sir.

409
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,800
''On ly with this lett er,''
these two can get convict ed .

410
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,400
Yes Sir!

411
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,600
S o it should not be torn .
Something else should be done .

412
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,700
Very good Doctor!

413
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,600
''Mr.Mahesh Sandilya , who sel ls''
liquor has given a stat ement . . .

414
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,800
'' . . . that when Mary died ,''
David was in police custody. . .

415
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,300
. . . and he did David's bai l .

416
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,900
But in police records there is
no mention of David's arrest .

417
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,300
And there's no witness too .

418
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
- No ! He's lying . . . he's lying !
- S it down .

419
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,400
''Apart from this ,''
when l arrest ed him . . .

420
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,200
. . . he accept ed his crime before 2
rich and responsi ble men .

421
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,100
He wrot e that stat ement himself
and gav e it to me .

422
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,900
l've su bm itt ed it in the court .

423
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,900
''As a doctor, who has done the post''
mort em of Mary's corpse . . .

424
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,000
. . . it's my duty to give
an honest stat ement .

425
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,300
The ca use of Mary's death
was not an accidentor su icide .

426
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,700
lnf act she was m u rdered
with cruelty.

427
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,500
''The wou nds on her body,''
are a proof of this .

428
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,200
''Mary was an ed ucat ed g i rl ,''
from a rich f am i ly.

429
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,300
David was not worthy of her. S o she
began having e xtra marital aff ai rs .

430
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,200
''David confided one day,''
he can't bear her ad u lt ery.

431
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,800
l advised him to speak to Mary
and ask her to be f aithfu l .

432
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,300
But . . . lnever thoug ht
he would kill her.

433
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,300
No husband can bear
his wife's ad u lt ery.

434
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:44,800
S o l . . . req uest the court . . .
to have mercy on him .

435
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,500
The way people
crucified Jesus C h rist .

436
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,400
l had only heard about it .

437
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,300
But today l even saw it .

438
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
What will happen to him?

439
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Don't worry about him .

440
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,500
Now he's my son .
l'll close the liquor business .

441
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,300
l'llnot do any bad business now.

442
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,400
''lt's my duty, to make him''
an honest and nice man like you .

443
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,600
lt' l l be better if you kill him .

444
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,900
lnst ead of the words of Bi ble . . .

445
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,500
. . . the fire of revenge
must bu rn in his heart .

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Beca use after 2 0 years
when l'm released . . .

447
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,300
. . . l may not have the strength
to mat ch the fire in my heart .

448
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,900
At that time he'll be my support .

449
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,200
He' l l be my strength .

450
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,300
S ee Mahesh . . .

451
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,800
lf you are my friend . . .

452
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,600
lf you like me . . .

453
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,100
. . . then make this boy
a dangerous criminal .

454
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,800
What are you saying?

455
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,300
Wi l l any father
say this for his son?

456
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,900
The one who raped his mother.

457
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,200
The people who pu n ished his father
with life sent ence in jail .

458
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,500
lf he doesn't take revenge
''from such rog ues , he's not a man .''

459
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,000
You are right David . You were
so happy with your wife and child .

460
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,000
Those 3 rog ues notonly

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,500
. . . but also def amed you !

462
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
lt's my duty to take
revenge from those 3 rog ues !

463
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,500
You want him to be a criminal .

Please listen to me
with a cool mind .

470
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,700
Years back f ew men did a m istake .
lt's no use of taking revenge now.

471
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,100
l mean . . . it's not good to roam
with a pistol .

472
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,200
lt's my duty to take revenge
from those 3 rog ues !

473
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,700
You want him to be criminal .

''A man wat ch ing a d rama ,''

He can't f eel the person's pain .

Anyway. . .

479
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,500

This is lshwarlal and the one who

And you made my son
a police officer!

. . . it's not a sin
to do liquor business !

508
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,800
But to instill the poison of hatred
in a child's life is a sin !

509
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:04,000
l decided to bear your anger
but l won't spoi l the boy's life !

510

''lf you want , you can h it me .''

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,100
''Did you tell him , his father''
is rotting in jail for 2 4 years?

519
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,400
- Did you?
- No ! - Why?

520
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,100
''l told him , l'm his father! ''

521

You . . .

522
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
You said that you . . .

Don't f eel bad .

00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,300
''He called me  Baba' ,''
and those were his first words .

526
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,700
l'm not his father but
l was very happy to hear Baba .

527
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,900
l became his father from that day.

528
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,600
For his sak e l left all bad habits .

God also hel ped me . l ed ucat ed him
but never told him your story!

665
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,500
l wish you could see all this .

666
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,100
You would be so happy.

667
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,100
Take him away. Come on !

01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:36,100
The time of your child hood . . .'

669
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,600

You're the treasure of my hopes .'

672

. . . g lorify my name .'

674
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,100
You have got my name .'

You are my i mage .'

680
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,400
Th in k once more and then answer.

681
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,300
When that man conf essed to you . . .

682
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,900
. . . that he'll m u rder 3 men . Did n't
you f eel like seeing his face?

683
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,600
''Sir, l'm a cathol ic priest .''

684
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,500
We' re not perm itt ed to see
the face of the conf essor.

685
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,700
We can't even d isclose
the conf ession .

686
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,000
Then why are you d isclosing it?

687
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,700
l felt it's more em inent
to save the lives of 3 men .

688
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,300
S o l resig ned from priesthood
and came here .

689
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,300
Now it's your duty
to save their lives .

690
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,100
You don't know
that man's descri ption .

691
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,900
You don't even know
the men he's going to kill .

692
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,100
''Without knowing this ,''
what can the police do?

693
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,100
Pol ice is not God
to know everything .

694
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,700
You are absol ut ely right .

695
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,200
This is like cat ch ing
a black cat in the dark.

696
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,800
lt's better to d rop this case .
lsn't it?

697
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,200
''Father, you can go .''

698
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,600
Don't make hast e .
Th in k. . . th in k something .

699
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,700
''From his conf ession we know,''
he is a sta u nch Cathol ic .

700
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,600
S o he must have had
the f aith that . . .

701
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,900
. . . Father won't tell anyone
about his conf ession .

702
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,100
That's fine .
But knowing this doesn't hel p us .

703
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,400
You're right . That's the reason
l didn't d iscuss this point .

704
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,900
l mean l didn't raise this point .

705
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,000
''Yes son , tell me how will it hel p .''

706
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,900
lt will hel p in a way that
th roug h newspapers and T .V. . .

707
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:17,700
'' . . . we can say, Father notonly''
d isclosed his conf ession . . .

708
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,400
. . . but also gav e his descri ption
to the police .

709
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,600
There will be chaos in the city.

710
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Every man has some enemy.

711
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,100
The whole city will demand
for police prot ection !

712
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,300
lt' l l creat e a pan ic !

713
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,300
You're right but we will
benefit in two ways .

714
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,700
When he'll know that . . .

715
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,200
. . . Father has d isclosed
his conf ession to the police . . .

716
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,200
'' . . . he may attack Father,''
in a rel ig ious f ervor.

717
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,900
lf he does that
we can arrest him easi ly.

718
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,900
And if doesn't do that then . . .

719
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,300
. . . after knowing that police
is aware of his int entions . . .

720
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:59,700
. . . he may delay his plan to kill
and we'll get some more time .

721
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,500
Your idea is great !

722
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,700
l've told you so many times not to
intrude in the department matt ers .

723
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Go inside !

724
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,000
l f eel your suggestion is right .

725
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,600
Ev en l had thoug ht about this .

726
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,100
''Yes . Mr.Vijay, l f eel''
you can start the inv estigation .

727
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,900
- Yes .
- S hall we go? - Yes .

728
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,900
lf you find any suspicious man
near the church . . .

729
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,400
'' . . . don't start the inq u i ry,''
first let me know.

730
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,700
The plain clothed Constables
near the Father's house . . .

731
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:56,300
. . . who are looking at g i rls
''passing by, ask them to be alert .''

732
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,400
Ask Father to come and sitoutside .

733
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
''lf he sits inside ,''
how will anyone attack him?

734
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,700
''Assure him , we have taken measures''
for his saf ety.

735
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,000
He doesn't need to f ear.

736
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,900
The inspector of C hem bu r police
station has called you atonce .

737
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,500
- Why?
''- He says , a Father is there . . .''

738
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:37,900
. . . who clai ms to know everything
about the 3 murders that may happen .

739
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,000
Did the Father say anything
about it to the inspector?

740
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,600
No . He says he'll tell the detai ls
to the S uperintendent of Police .

741
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,700
And he insists that he should be
taken to the S . P .

742
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,600
''Ask him to wait , l'm com ing .''

743
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,300
''l'm hand l ing this case , so tell me''
what you know about the criminal .

744
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,100
l told the inspector before you . . .

745
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,800
l'll tell the detai ls only
to the S uperint endentof Pol ice .

746
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,100
''That's fine , but l should know''
how much the S . P . should know.

747
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,500
No . . . no .

748
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,200
J ust a m in ut e Father.

749
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,100
Why are you insisting
on meeting the S . P .

750
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,300
Beca use in this case some of the
police officers are also involv ed .

751
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,200
Maybe they will try
to hel p the criminal .

752
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,200
''The police convicts the criminals ,''
they don't hel p them .

753
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,000
ln your age l too had f aith
in this bel ief.

754
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,200
But l was betrayed .

755
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:07,200
''Anyway, will l get the perm ission''
to meet the S . P .?

756
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,800
Please wait here .

757
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,600
lnspector Vijay is hand l ing
this case .

758
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,300
We have f aith in him .

759
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,700
You can tell him everything .

760
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:52,200
Ev en l want ed Vijay
to know everything but . . .

761
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,500
'' . . . but later l thoug ht ,''
l'll tell you everything myself.

762
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,900
''lf youperm it ,''
l'd like to search him .

763
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,500
Let him do his duty.

764
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,100
You said he's a very
sincere officer.

765
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,700
Why this bandage?

766
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,300
This is an old wou nd .

767
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:21,900
lt's not healed yet .

768
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,300
Why don't you go to a special ist?

769
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,900
There are 3 special ists
in my mind .

770
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,300
With great d ifficu lty l've got an
appointment with the firstone .

771
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,500
ln the morning a fi le had come
from the DlG's office .

772
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,400
''This one , did you see it?''

773
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,600
Yes . . . l saw it .

774
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,500
''Now tell me , who is this criminal''
and who is he going to kill?

775
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,200
When is he going to kill them
and why?

776
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,300
lt' l l take me time to tell
the detai ls so . . .

777
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:00,200
. . . l've writt en everything
about that criminal on this paper.

778
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,800
Please read this .

779
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,500
Yes the same David .

780
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,400
''He had a bea utifu l wife ,''
a lovely child .

781
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:58,200
He had a happy f am i ly.
You destroyed everything !

782
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:03,000
''David , l'm not thatold Sahay.''

783
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,800
l've changed .

784
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,700
l've improved .
Please forgive me .

785
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,800
Please forgive me .

786
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,800
lt's humane to forgive an enemy. . .

787
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,100
. . . but to forgive traitor is
foolishness !

788
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,300
Remove your clothes .

789
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,400
- Clothes?
- Yes .

790
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,400
l won't let you die
in this uniform .

791
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,300
This uniform has a respect .

792
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,200
lt will be maligned if it gets
stained with your blood .

793
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,400
''l'm com ing there in some time , till''
then l want everyone to be alert .

794
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You have a call .

795
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,000
Tell l'm busy.
Ask them to call after 1 /2 hour.

796
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,700
Some Vinita has met with
an accident . S he's very serious .

797
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,400
Vijay speaking .

798
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,400
Vinita has met with an accident .
S he's serious .

799
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,900
You're call ing from which hospital?

800
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,300
which hospital?

801
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,700
Say she's lyinGon the road .

802
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,100
S he's lyinGon the road .

803
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,300
S he wants to die in your arms .

804
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,700
S he wants to die in your arms .

805
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,200
l'm upset to see t ears
in your eyes .

806
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:14,100
But for 2 4 years l've shed
t ears of blood in the darkness .

807
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,100
You have to pay for that .
Don't you?

808
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,900
l won't kill you with my hands .

809
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,300
You're a corrupt police officer.

810
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,100
An honest police officer
will come and open this door.

811
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,400
And he'll be the ca use
of your death .

812
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,200
Behave sensi bly!

813
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,900
Yes start that .

814
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,600
This will be a lesson for corrupt
police officers like you !

815
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,800
No . . . no !

816
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,200
Wasn't it a great j u m p?

817
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,200
l was so proud of you .

818
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,800
l used to give your e xam ple
to sen ior officers and . . .

819
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,000
. . . asked them to em u lat e
your sense of duty.

820
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,400
l didn't you to be so careless
and fool ish .

821
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,100
l've been in the service
for 2 4 years . . .

822
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,900
. . . and ne xt year l'll reti re .

823
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,800
lt's another thing that in these
years l didn't solv e any case .

824
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,500
But in lnever did such
fool ish ness . Am l right?

825
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,900
''You said , you went''
in the control room and . . .

826
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,800
. . . opened the chan nel
to Sahay's room .

We don't care who

When and where will you
hand over the Doctor to me?

You'll tell me the time and place
or should l say it?

909
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,800
''David , you can't escape us .''

910
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,500
S u rrender yourself

911
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:28,700
''S ee , l only want an answer''
to my q uestion .

912
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,200
The Doctor's life is dear to you
or your da ug ht er's?

913
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:44,100
Pol icemen don't bother

914
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:50,200
lf anything happens to my da ug ht er
l'll consider it my i l l fate .

l'm sure there
could be a breakth roug h .

Don't try to understand anything .

1022
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,600
Consider our meeting as
a bad d ream and forget it .

1023

You're setting me free .

''Please tell me ,''
why do you trust me so much?

''S uppose , God forbid if someone''

01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,600
Ti l l l'm working in this

01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:42,000
. . . there can be no relation
between me and the killer!

1041

''When he th rew the rope to save me ,''

Did David give you any problem?

1057
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,400
He's not an insensitiv e man
like my father and your son .

1058
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,500
They had left me to die .

1059

But David gav e a pistol for
my prot ection and sent me back.

You've put me in a d i lem ma .

Don't try to avoid it .

01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,700
How do you know David?

1072
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,900
Let it be . . .

''lf Vijay asks you about David ,''
don't tell him anything .

A killer held me captiv e

01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,700
You and father made
no effort to save me .

''And when he left me ,''

01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:37,500
You are lying !

02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,100
You're his father!

1151
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,400
lf he knows about his father. . .

1152
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:34,400
. . . he's ask about his mother!

1153
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:36,000
We'll have to tell him
the second secret .

1154
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,300
Wi l l you be able
to tell your son . . .

1155
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:42,200
. . . that his mother died
because she was raped !

1156
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:56,300
And when he'll know that
he was prot ecting the rog ues . . .

1157
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:00,100
. . . who raped his mother
and sent his father to jail . . .

1158
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:03,700
. . . he'll be devastat ed !

1159
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:14,600
Listen David . . .

1160
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:19,800
. . . Vijay is not my son .

1161
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,600
But l've given him more love
than one can give his own son !

1162
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,500
Ev en he loves me very much .

1163
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,600
''lf knows this bitt er truth ,''
he'll leave me and go away!

1164
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:39,100
''l'll open the door,''
you leave before Vijay comes here .

1165
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,400
Don't go from here !
l'll open the other door.

1166
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:51,700
Go from here !

1167
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:55,400
David where are you . . .

1168
02:01:57,700 --> 02:01:58,800
Why are you crying?

1169
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,300
U nderstood .
You've changed after what l said .

1170
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:10,900
You've improved . lsn't it?

1171
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,900
You want to su rrender for the
sak e of Vijay's futu re . lsn't it?

1172
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,800
Don't worry.

1173
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:20,000
ln the past it was different .
Your friend didn't have the money.

1174
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,400
But today l have money!

1175
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:25,800
l'll fig ht your case well .
''Wait here , l'll tal k to the police .''

1176
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:37,100
''lnspector, you're not arresting''
David . He's su rrendering himself.

1177
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:41,300
S o you must treat him with
respect . Tell this to Vijay also !

1178
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:47,500
No need to shak e my hands . lt's my
duty as a police officer's father.

1179
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:52,800
What's this?

1180
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,700
You knew everything about the
criminal but . . .

1181
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,800
. . . till 2 murders you gav e
no information to the police .

1182
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,400
''To know more about this ,''
you're arrest ed .

1183
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:03,300
Why arrest the witness?
Arrest the cu l prit . He's . . .

1184
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:12,900
Come on Sir.

1185
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,700
One m in ut e .

1186
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,400
''l want to speak to my son ,''
no to lnspector Vijay in privat e .

1187
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,500
l loved you so much . . .

1188
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:36,000
. . . so much that my heart
became em pty.

1189
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:38,500
And youplayed this game with me .

1190
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,600
The elders were right .

1191
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:43,900
A man's real son is his own .

1192
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,500
Someone else's son
can not be our own .

1193
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,400
Why have you come here?

1194
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:38,200
''What have you come , here for?''

1195
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:43,700
''That day, when yourealized ,''
''who l am , you let me go .''

1196
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:48,400
''Today, when l realized ,''
''who you are , l came here .''

1197
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:57,400
Your old friend Mahesh S h inde
told me everything about you .

1198
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:16,300
You stood as my father-in-law
d u ring the marriage ceremony.

1199
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:23,600
For you to bless me or for me to
invit e you to my house . . .

1200
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,600
. . . Perhaps it's not in our destiny.

1201
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,600
That's why l have come
''here with f ood , today.''

1202
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,100
Please come and have f ood !

1203
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,200
''Perhaps , your sorrows have''
overcome you appetit e .

1204
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:49,900
''Still , eat a l ittle''
to make me happy.

1205
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,500
For me !

1206
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:04,100
May you live a thousand years

1207
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:12,100
''l don't even know, how you are''

1208
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,000
What is this?
Resignation?

1209
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:45,900
''You th in k, a resignation could stop''
an officer from arresting your dad?

1210
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:51,000
Had it been about arresting my
''father, l would n't have resig ned .''

1211
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,600
l am still ready to arrest him .

1212
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:58,300
''But , l am not ready to prot ect''
a savage who raped my mother.

1213
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:09,300
''Being her husband , he could at''
least take revenge on two brut es !

1214
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:14,000
''Being her son , l'll take''
revenge on the th i rd .

1215
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,400
How could a responsi ble officer
''like you , tal k like that?''

1216
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:22,600
''A true police officer, loves his''
duty more than his relations .

1217
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:23,900
You know this very well !

1218
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,100
''Yes , si r! l know it ! ''

1219
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,200
''But , being a police officer''
doesn't mean that . . .

1220
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,700
. . . l forget the atrocities done to
''a mother, who bore me in her wom b .''

1221
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:38,400
Do l forget the e x cesses done to my
in nocent father in the name of law?

1222
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,900
''He was nothing to me , yet he loved''
''me , more than one loves a son .''

1223
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,000
''l got , both , a f arther''
and mother's love !

1224
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,600
What did l give him in return?
betrayal in the name of duty!

1225
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:53,900
C h i ld ren consig n their deceased
parents to the holy fire .

1226
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:59,500
''By arresting him , l set his love''
afire in his own life time .

1227
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,900
''l can't agon iz e myself, by being''
so daft as to prot ect law.

1228
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:17,400
To def ame the whole department d ue
''to one man's f a u lt , is not right .''

1229
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,100
''When , one mentions lnd ia , one''
''tal ks of Gandhi, not Godse .''

1230
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:30,600
''l am not saying , a police officer''
should be heartless or emotion less .

1231
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,700
But they should use their heart and
emotion for benefitof the public .

1232
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:40,500
And not be revengeful
to the public .

1233
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,400
Ashoka's pi l lar is
our national sym bol .

1234
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,500
And the pride to wear this
sym bol on one's head . . .

1235
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,200
. . . belongs only to a soldier or
a police man who prot ects law.

1236
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:55,700
Ev en the president and the pri me
m in ist er don't have this privi lege .

1237
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:59,500
Don't d isown this pride
with this resig nation .

1238
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:06,300
Th in k itover once more
and then make a decision .

1239
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:40,900
l f eel ashamed to
call myself your son .

1240
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:46,900
l couldn't wi pe of the
blem ish against your name .

1241
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:54,400
''Perhaps , you are i l l-fated''
to have a son like me .

1242
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:04,400
lt's you good fortu ne that you got
a husband who loved you so much .

1243
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,500
l am proud of my father.

1244
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:13,700
l f eel a lotof pride for him .

1245
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:23,300
''But , l have to abide by my duty.''

1246
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:32,200
''Forgive , me mother! ''
l have to abide by my duty.

1247
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,300
A man can share his
happiness with anyone .

1248
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:22,100
''But his sorrow, he has to''
contain in his own heart .

1249
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:27,200
''That's the reason , l have''
never told you the truth .

1250
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:32,100
''S ince , l didn't want to''
share my agony with you .

1251
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:40,800
lt's good that you
''came here , today! ''

1252
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,900
''today, it's your''
mother's an n iv ersary.

1253
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:56,300
''Lets pray, so that her''
sou l may rest in peace .

1254
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:07,200
''Come one , lets pray first ! ''

1255
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,100
We can d iscuss things later.

1256
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,200
Take this and l ig ht it !

1257
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,600
''The prayer, is important ,''
not the way you do it !

1258
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:45,500
l have reached the end
of my life's road .

1259
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:50,800
''Neither, do lneed anyone's''
''hel p , nor good wishes .''

1260
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:54,200
But your son has his
whole life ahead of him .

1261
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:59,400
''Therefore , you save all''
your good wishes for him .

1262
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:01,600
He' l lneed them .

1263
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:55,800
Look at this ! lt must
look like 6 from there .

1264
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:59,700
''But , from here , it appears 9 to me .''

1265
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:08,300
''Diff erence , is , because , you look at''
''it from your place , l , from m ine .''

1266
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,800
We are right in our
different situations .

1267
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:17,600
J ust that we have
different viewpoints .

1268
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:24,000
''This d iff erence between us ,''
would last all our lives .

1269
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,100
''You do , what you th in k is your duty.''

1270
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:32,400
''And , l'll do , what ev er''
l th in k is right !

1271
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:39,000
''lf l win , you'll be''
proud of your father.

1272
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:45,000
''ln case you win , l'll too ,''
be proud of my son . But . . .

1273
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,300
But my sou l won't rest in peace !

1274
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:57,700
''But , son , l know this won't happen ! ''

1275
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:09,200
''Not , because you are my father. . .''

1276
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:13,600
'' . . . but as a police officer, too , l''
''bel iev e , you are right in a way.''

1277
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:21,500
''Therefore , l am ready to get''
''the last criminal , convict ed .''

1278
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:31,800
The law that allowed those
''criminals to roam free , tillnow. . .''

1279
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,600
. . . that law tal ks about
''convicting them , today?''

1280
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:39,800
''l am sorry, but these things''
have no mean ing for me .

1281
02:17:40,900 --> 02:17:44,000
''Henceforth , my son , you''
need not bother the trou ble .

1282
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:46,900
''l'll decide his conviction , myself! ''

1283
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:07,600
Being a police officer l can't
''let a criminal , wal k away.''

1284
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,100
S u rrender yourself to me !

1285
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:42,100
A man with courage dares to cat ch
his fish in a storm in the ocean .

1286
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:47,100
''The one who , sits at the shore''
and dang les the hook. . .

1287
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:51,400
. . . one who waits for the fish to
''take the bait , is not a brav e man .''

1288
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:58,000
''lf you are really brav e , then''
come and arrest me at my den .

1289
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:04,700
''And if you are not , then l am''
not going to su rrender myself.

1290
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:15,400
l am leaving . You can shoot me in
the back and win rewards and f ame .

1291
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:35,100
A police officer can shoot
any where to nab a criminal .

1292
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:41,000
''lt's not important , which partof''
a criminal's body he shoots at .

1293
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:44,400
Never e xpect me to
be len ient to you .

1294
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,700
A criminal can even m u rder to
save his skin from the police .

1295
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:24,000
You should n't e xpect
any pity from him .

1296
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:27,100
''l can kill you , if l want .''

1297
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,700
''But , the mother, who bore you in''
womb for nine months is lying here .

1298
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,300
l don't want to kill you here .

1299
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:44,300
''But , remember, your mother can't''
be everywhere to save you .

1300
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:54,800
''Hai l , brav e leader Mr.C hatu rv ed i ! ''
''Hai l the warrior, C hatu rv ed i ! ''

1301
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:13,600
Forget the old things and remember
that you are a police officer.

1302
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,200
