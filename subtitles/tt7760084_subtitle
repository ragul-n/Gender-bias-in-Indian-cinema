Hey!
Hey!

00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,400
What is it, bro?

Etsifi

5
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:24,194
Where's that steel rod
that was lying here?

6
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,272
Which rod?

7
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:27,371
The one you used to hit the
SI at Medical College.

8
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:28,442
I can't give that.

9
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,339
Stop messing around and tell me.

10
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:31,570
Why?
You keep q uiet.

11
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,813
- PP, you should listen to this.
- What is it, bro?

12
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,179
Recently, him and his
big bro brought a guy.

13
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:40,818
They broke his skull, and this
place was filled with blood.

14
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,289
Finally I had to clean up everything.

15
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:44,491
Shucks.
Give it, bro.

16
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,252
That guy has been showing
off for a while.

17
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:47,555
I got him only today.

18
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,421
Vadi, listen to this.

19
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:51,565
Ifthe police comes
here in this name...

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,200
No. Tell me where your rod is lying.

21
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,563
Check underthe dog cage.

22
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:00,534
Got it! Hey! Come on!
We should beat him to death today.

23
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,542
Good.
Can go up to 8 stitches.

24
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:23,764
You...

25
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,501
Vadi, you want to hit me?

26
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,238
Then go ahead.

27
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,635
But remember one thing. Before you go to
bed, you'll fall at my feet, and ask me;

28
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:35,843
'Pinku bro,

29
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:37,943
shall I sleep for a little while?'

30
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,547
And then?

31
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,379
Ifl make a call,
Shaji Annan will come.

33

Call Shaji Annan.

35
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,854
Vadi, this will be
quite harmful foryou.

36
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:49,890
You call him, man!

37
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:51,625
Okay then.

38
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:57,898
What?

39
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,199
He's not picking up?

40
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,736
No balance.

41
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,736
What?
No balance?

42
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,604
Tell me the number.
I will call.

00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,680
Hey! Hey!
I am right here.

44

Here. It's ringing.
Call him, fast.

Yeah. Stand closer.

49
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,468
Move the light, man!

50
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,234
Hello! Who is it?

51
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,532
ShajiAnna, it's me, Pinku.

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,707
Bro, move your phone.

53
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,765
Shaji Anna, they've brought
me hereto beat me up.

54
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,602
At that Sheshadan's workshop.

He is at a wedding.

59
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:57,649
But isn't he married?

60
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:58,749
Is that so important now?

61
00:03:58,826 --> 00:03:59,793
What to do with him?

62
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,352
What to do?

63
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:02,361
Beat him to pulp!

It's Senan and team.

Then do one thing.
I'll break the skull ofthe guy in front.

You guys thrash the guys at the back.

73
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,617
Get all the rods from the side.
You heard me?

74

Let's see how farthey will go.

75

Hey!

76
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,835
Shall we stick a twig up
this guy's nose, bro?

00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,543
Don't hit me, bro.

78

What?

79
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,551

Don't hit me, bro.

00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,088
Scoundrel!

82
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,026
Will you ever do this again?

83
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:09,530
No, bro.

84
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:10,864
Get lost.

85
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:12,966

you from such troubles?

One slap...

94
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,778

- Shut up. -Come.

- Aren't you ashamed?
- Calm down, bro.

99
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,327
What's the point in cursing him?

100
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,397
I was just saying...

101
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,329
Sree, don't try tojustify him.

102
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,764
What ifthere's a point
in what he's saying?

103
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,528
Let him say it.
What's the matter?

104
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,603
Bro, you should listen to this.

105
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,436
Didn't you all see Lalettan's flex we
kept in front ofthe boys' high school?

106
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,804
Lalettan's flex it seems.

107
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,038
I was the one who designed it,
printed it and kept the flex there.

108
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,408
- After collecting funds.
- Sree, come.

109
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,839
It has my name, photo and number.

110
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,043
And that Vadi and team tore it down.

(Reciting the poem 'Kaakka' (Crow)
by Vyloppalli Sreedhara Menon)

113
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:56,315
Where are you getting ready <i>&</i> going? I've
been seeing this for a couple of days now.

114
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:57,612
Being all hyper...

115
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,887
That's true.

116
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,316
Where are you going?

117
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,823
Go afterthis over.

118
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:06,925
Bro, I don't have the time to watch this.
Give me the key of that bike.

119
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,791
Take me to that Radhakrishnan's shop.

120
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,063
Get lost, you hag. When I'm leaving urgently,
you want to go to Radhakrishnan's shop?

121
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,933
I don't know what's happening.

122
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,138
I think all of you will make
us put up a shamiana outside.

123
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,072
Move, you hag.

124
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,369
You think I don't know anything?

125

He's coming and going
as he pleases.

126
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:28,648
Shamiana...

00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:37,724
Sreelaksh...

ls she hiding?

129
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,694
- Where is Sreelakshmi, dude?
- I don't know.

Sreelaksh...

131
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:45,763
Tell me, where is she?

Sanal, tell me.

My darling, tell me.
Where is she?

134

Calm down, man.

135
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:55,639
Stop throwing
attitude and tell me.

136
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,642
Where is Sreelakshmi?

137
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:57,870
Can't you see me
doing a job here?

138
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,379
If you try to disturb
in between that...

139
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,011
What is it, rascal?
Attitude, huh?

She got married.
Register marriage.

142
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:06,377
The groom is an attender
of a private bus.

143
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:07,420
'Mandamaruthan'

144
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,081
The name ofthe bus is 'Mandamaruthan'

145
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:10,213
See!

146
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,766
Didn't she invite you?

147
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,166
Bro, you should hearthis.

148
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,231
I was really serious about her.

149
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,279
- Still she ditched me.
- Shucks.

150
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:33,713
Leave it, bro.

151
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,306
What's the point of repeating
it again and again?

152
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,811
You won't understand it.

153
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,250
You'll knowwhen it happens to you.

154
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,084

Bro...

157
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:48,461
What's his problem?
Did someone die?

158
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:50,093

The girl he loved for 4 years,
ditched him &went with a Dubai guy.

162
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,337
When he came to me, he was
even worse than this guy.

163
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,204
Now he's getting better.

164
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,776
- Kumar, your grief is gone, right?
- Yes, bro. Shall I work with more weight?

165
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,906
No need of excitement.
Work with the weights you can.

166
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:11,084
Hey! Hey!

167
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,311
Your situation is sad.

172
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,466
Pay attention to your body.

173
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:27,027
Instead of going behind girls.

174
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:28,835
Get lost, bro.

175
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,868
Ifl come to the gym, I also
won't get any girl like you.

176
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,338
Not because I'm not getting any.
I'm not getting married.

177
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,498
Both are the same.

If the sweat goes away,
the work out would be wasted.

Okay.

184
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:49,847
- For me too.
- Pinku...

185

Didn't you see my situation?

Bro...

189
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:01,200
Bro, her first night would
be over now, right?

190
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,036
Right?

191
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,536
- This guy"

192
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:06,406
Keep quiet!

193
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,943
I won't them both leave in peace.

194
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,508
He's getting high.

Her damn 'Mandamaruthanfi

Best. Now go behind that,
and create more troubles!

197
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,352
- No cigarettes?
- Check that packet, bro.

198
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:22,546
This has only ash.

199
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,857
No more?

200
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:26,220
I smoked it in tension.

201
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,987
You and your tension.
Go buy it and come.

202
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,496
At this time?

203
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,394
No! After her baby shower...

204
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,963
Go!
Keep it there.

205
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,331
Drink once you buy it and come.

206
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,595
- I'll also go with him.
- You also go.

207
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,164
Hey! I'm also coming.

None of you rascals
have to com e.

I know where the hell I have to go.

210
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,845
Not there.

211
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,213
This side.

212
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,174
- To the left.
- I know!

213
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,113
- Bro, he..
- No problem.

214
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:53,345
If he sits here in this
mood, it won't be right.

215
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,252
If he goes out <i>&</i> comes
back, he'll be all right.

216
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,379
- There's a lot of checking.

One packet Gold.

220
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,400
One packet mini gold.

221
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:16,943
2 orange juices, ready!

222
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,978
I've been waiting
here for a long time.

223
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,013
Wait!

224
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,349
Here.

225
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:23,516
Here. Eat it.

226
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,209
Broke that bottle!

227
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:26,519

Get lost.

Why are you irritating?

232
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:42,435
I'm alone now.

233
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:43,903
Him <i>&</i> his shop!

Doctor...

242
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,472
I am sorry.

243
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:30,274
We tried the maximum that's
possible through medical science.

244
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,618
It's fate.

245
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,044
If he was brought here
a little earlier...

246
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:35,484
Doctor, these are the wrong people.

247
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,283
These are not Kuttan's people.

248
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,163
Sorry.

249
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,297
I mistook you.

250
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,966
- This rascal..
- Leave him.

251
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,038
Leave him.

252
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,675
- Bro!
- Pinku!

00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,403
Pinku!

254
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:58,707
What happened?

255
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,577
- I was beaten up, bro.
- What is this?

256
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:02,341
Will you take away the
life that's left in him?

257
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,645
My dear Chechi, let us see him.

258
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,117
Who did this?

259
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,948
I don't know his name.

260
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,488
His mobile is with me.

261
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:11,122
Whoever he is, we'll break
into his house &fix him up.

262
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:12,989
Showthe mobile.
Today is his end!

263
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,293
-It's in the nursing room.
- Where is the room?

264
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,291
Tell me what actually happened.

265
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,729
I told the police that it's an accident.

266
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,629
A
a

267
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:24,432
We should slice up
that scoundrel, bro.

268
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,230
Whichevercornerof
the world he is in,

269
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,472
make him likethis, and
bring him infront ofme,

270
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:33,602
and make him apologize to me.

272
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:37,684
We will bring him.

273

This Senannan will bring him.

274

Tonight's the end ofthat son of a @%%!$! #

275
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,589
Renju! Sree!
Come on!

276
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,985
Mom! Bro!
See you later.

277
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:51,764
Over there.

278
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:56,336
Number lock.

279
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:58,595
That can be solved.

280
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,140
Look at that son of a scoundrel.

281
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:02,402
Bro, from his looks, he
seems to be from Aattukal.

282
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:07,004
Bloody little one!

283
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,147
What should we do?

284
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,349
What should we do?

285
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,144
Puncture him &take him to Pinku.

286
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,221
Let me get this lock opened.

287
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,489
It's my brotherwho's lying there.

288
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,423
If you want to do anything
for your brother in law,

289
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,464
do that now.

290
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:29,836
I Will do it.

291
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,738
Hey!

292
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,772
Bro, how can we sit like this?

293
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,375
Then shall I sit on your head?

294
00:17:40,614 --> 00:17:41,581
Calm down, man.

295
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:42,615
I am serious.

296
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:45,584
Ifl see him now, I'll rip him
apart <i>&</i> stick him on the wall!

297
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,312
- Sit down, Renju.
- What?

298
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,081
Senan bro, got the
details ofthat guy.

299

Em
a

300
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,054
Where are you barging in?

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,255
Sree, start the vehicle and wait.

302
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,227
Call Ambotti <i>&</i> ask him
to keep the tools ready.

303
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,497
Stan!
Come on! Fast!

304
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,669
Fast!

305
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:03,736
Call him!

306
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,536
IfAmbotti doesn't have it, let's get
it from PP. - Keep quiet for some time.

307
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,607
Did he pick up?
What did he say?

308
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,805
- Did he pick up?
- Wait, man!

309
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:16,583
Sree...

310
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,480
Hey! One minute.
I'll call you back.

311
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:19,713
Turn offthe vehicle.

312
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,880
Tell Ambotti that we don't need tools.

313
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,157
Why?

314
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,586
His house is not here.

315
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:27,194
Wherever it may be!
Come on, start!

316
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,153
Then go!
It's in Kasaragod.

317
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:30,230
Where?

318
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,197
Kasaragod.

319
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:32,629
- Kasaragod!
- Really?

320
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:33,866
Yes, man.

321
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,268
Is it true?

322
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,364
Kasaragod orwherever he is...

323
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,639
we should catch him.

324
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:43,868
When that doctor said that
first, I almost collapsed.

325
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,144
True.

326
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,838
In a way, he's in this
state because of me.

327
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,540
What is this, bro?

328
00:18:49,316 --> 00:18:50,806
Bro, it's not because of you.

329
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,318
I want that guy who hit him.

330
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,480
Whoever he is, we'll get
into his house &finish him.

331
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,352
- I swear on my mother.
- What are you saying?

332
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,390
Aren't we angry?

333
00:18:57,624 --> 00:18:59,524
Is going to Kasaragod <i>&</i>
hitting him so easy?

334
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,754
Expenses are fine.
We can collect money for that.

335
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:04,228
If we go there without
any ground support...

336
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:05,363
Bro, it's notjust that...

337
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:07,558
To stay away from home until
we come back from Kasaragod...

338
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:08,601
Well, I was just saying...

339
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,603
None of you have to come.
I'll go alone.

340
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,638
Like hell, you will.

341
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,469
Bro, what I'm saying is that...

342
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,869
You don't have to say anything.

343
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,306
It's not that.

344
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:17,810
Bro, his phone is with us now.

345
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:21,246
Can't we call his family or friends
from this and ask where he is?

346
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,779
If he hasn't left Trivand rum,

347
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,749
can't we get hold of him here itself?
Correct?

348
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,848
No Sree.
That won't work.

349
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,154
There's another problem.

350
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,652
A
a

351
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:34,394
If one more personjoins us,

352
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,826
notjust Kasargode, we can
even go to Punjab and hit him!

353
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,768
Who is that, bro?

354
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,637
Raghu.

355
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,836
Chenkal Raghu.

356
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,734
Bro, do we have to involve
Raghu Annan in this matter?

357
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:53,677
He is a psycho!

358
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,640
Raghu Annan has great
connections and influence.

359
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:03,351
If he calls up, there will be people who
will hit him right in Kasaragod itself.

360
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,225
Raghu Annan should come.

361
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,241
Is it a Nalukettu construction?

362
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,540
- Whose?
- This house.

363
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:27,611
What is it, Senan?

364
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,840
Came to meet Annan (Bro).
Isn't he here? - He'll come now.

365
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,816
- He will come now.
- Bro, please.

366
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,883
Mmcmm

367
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,822
a
a

368
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:38,915
Raghu Annan will come now.

369
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:41,222
- Leave me, bro. I have to go.
- You want more Dosa?

370
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,693
Enough?
Here.

371
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:44,326
This is Raghu Annan's mother.

372
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,755
Is it?

373
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,501
Here.

374
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,730
Foryou, my son will
come and give himself.

375
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,003
@551
a

376
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,671
- I'll give you later, okay?
- Okay.

377
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:01,506
Em
a

378
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:04,377
Two days back, I had met
your mother at the temple.

379
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,016
Well.. Why are you not getting married?

380
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:08,712
You're heronly son, right?

381
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,726
Isn't it sad to make your mom
cook foryou at this old age?

382
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:14,384
Not for you...

383
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,759
Bring a girl from somewhere,
at least for your mom's sake.

384
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,530
Pflfigm

385
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,328
She was crying in front of me.

386
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:22,793
I also felt really bad.

387
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,701
Iam really thinking about it.

388
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,302
Thinking about it, it seems.

389
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:28,865
When I tell my son here,
he doesn't even react to it.

390
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:31,637
He's staying as a bachelor because
he couldn't marry Thankamani.

391
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:35,538
Every motherwould wish to
see her child's marriage.

392
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,350
Whom do I say this to?

393
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:38,475
Who will listen?

394
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,586
Filmwn
E

395
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,621
Here he comes.

396
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,317
Emgw
a

397
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,657
- Why don't you get married?
- RaghuAnnan is coming.

398
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:36,772
Have you seen Raghu Annan
tightening his punching bracelet?

399
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,113
Once Raghu Annan tightens
his punching bracelet,

400
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:42,580
you can witness a
festival of punches!

401
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:43,616
Really?

402
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,014
- What is it, Senan?
- Nothing. Came to meet you.

403
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,651
Bro, this is the guy.
Prakashan.

404
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:57,129
Just a minute.

405
00:22:58,932 --> 00:22:59,899
What is this?

406
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,394
I heard that you're a feminist.

407
00:23:02,502 --> 00:23:03,731
No Raghu Anna.. I didn't...

408
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,702
You will let only ladies
get into your auto...

409
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,136
You will ride only to the area
where they are staying...

410
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,973
You won't take the proper route &take
a diversion through the museum...

411
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:14,446
Notjust that. He even gives candies
to the ladies who get into his auto.

412
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:15,840
What a service, right?

413
00:23:15,982 --> 00:23:17,108
But bro, I...

414
00:23:17,484 --> 00:23:18,451
Brother...

415
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:19,744
You do one thing.

416
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:23,480
Let him give water to all the ladies who
come for the Pongala festival this time.

417
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,525
Until then, let you auto be here.

418
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,117
But bro..
I didn't do all that...

419
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,162
Hey!

420
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,965
If you don't give water to the
ladies who come for the Pongala,

421
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,626
I swear on Attukal Goddess,

422
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:37,701
I'll dress you up as a woman <i>&</i> send
you to Kottamkulangara temple.

423
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:38,871
Got it?

424
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,130
Peter, take him away.

425
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:43,609
Come here.

426
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,677
Get lost.

427
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,147
Senan, come.

428
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:51,850
What is it? - The list of
programmes for the temple festival.

429
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,884
I'll come to the committee office.

430
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:54,921
Okay then.

431
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:55,988
Mom!

432
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,123
Sit down.

433
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,027
Son, did you call Babu?

434
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:02,094
I'll call him, mom.

435
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,459
- Don't forget.
- I'll call him.

436
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:04,530
One minute.

437
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,125
@@@@@Â§Â§Q

438
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:12,738
Bro!

439
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:14,740
What's that?

440
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,073
He's a great devotee to Mother.

441
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,804
He'll even die for his mother.

442
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:19,845
Okay.

443
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,050
Sreekutta, sit.

444
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,541
Senan, tell me.
What is it?

445
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,686
Bro, we had a small...

446
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,715
a mama?
a

447
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:33,192
Tell me.

448
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:34,590
You know our Pinku, right?

449
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,196
A small problem for Pinku.

450
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,189
None of us were there with him yesterday.

451
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,465
He was all alone.

452
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,700
He was beaten up by a guy.

453
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:43,594
He's in the general hospital now.

454
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,899
Are you talking about our Pinku?

455
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:45,938
Yes, bro.

456
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:48,632
You can't forget Pinku
so easily, right?

457
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:10,855
- I am outside.
- Where?

458
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,089
A
a

459
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,495
Give it fast.

460
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,132
I'll call you later, okay?

461
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,277
Raghu Anna!

462
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,317
Move!

463
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,097
Bro!

464
00:25:57,911 --> 00:25:58,969
Senan, what's the matter?

465
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,805
This is the offering
from Mutharamman temple.

466
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:02,915
And ya...

467
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,584
you should call that Rappayi.

468
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,081
It's the naming
ceremony on 20th.

469
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,915
Naming ceremony?
Whose?

470
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:09,746
Did you forget that?

471
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,616
Tulasi's son's naming ceremony.

472
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,623
When she got married &went,
she didn't want us, right?

473
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:14,660
And now why?

474
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:15,761
Raghu...

475
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,326
are you keeping
that in your mind?

476
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:18,990
We will go together.

477
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,796
- You go alone. I won't come.
- If I'm going, I'll go only with you.

478
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,334
Stop holding it,
and eat it, Senan.

479
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:27,868
Senan, tell me in detail.

480
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,031
Who hit him?

481
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,100
Bro, yesterday night, Pinku...

482
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,667
Bro, I'll say it.

483
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:39,913
Pinku and his mom were coming
from the General Hospital.

484
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:43,017
That lady hasn't been
well for some time now.

485
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:46,724
Pinku who was coming down the steps,
holding his ailing mother's hands.

486
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,791
Later what happened there were
dramatic moments, Raghu Anna...

487
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:51,292
Dramatic moments!

488
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,093
Is it paining, mother?

489
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,166
Yes, son.

490
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,327
I have a bad cough.

491
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:57,929
And a head ache too.

492
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,765
My hands and legs are paining badly.

493
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,806
So sad.

494
00:27:00,874 --> 00:27:04,401
The doctor said that all those pains would
be gone if you have these medicines.

495
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,271
Doctor said that.
Let's see.

496
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,405
If it's difficult foryou to travel
by bike, shall I call an ambulance?

497
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:09,815
N0?

498
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,214
It's okay.
Let's go on this.

499
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:13,183
Your wish is my command.

500
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,016
- Oh no!
- What?

501
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:16,055
Mother!

502
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,123
Oh no!
My leg!

503
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:19,123
[hmppnÃ©u

504
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,259
Mother!

505
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,422
Don't you know to walk properly?

506
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,630
What is this, child?

507
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,358
Elks
@[h1fl[kfl"?

508
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,028
Who is your child, you dog?

509
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:29,863
Oh no!
Don't do this.

510
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,301
Don't do this.
We are poor people.

511
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:33,862
Allow us to live.

512
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,964
- Get lost, you hag!
- Mother!

513
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,775
Oh no!
Mother!

514
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:39,645
Sir...

515
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,908
Being arrogant to me,
and that too, over here?

516
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:43,912
I will kill and bury you all!

517
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:45,885
Don't do that, please.

518
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:46,952
Mother!

519
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,187
Mother!

520
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:50,890
Mother!

521
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,856
Mother!
Open your eyes, mother!

522
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:53,959
Mother!

523
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:54,994
Mother!

524
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:57,787
Mother!

525
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,026
Did he hit his mother?

526
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,230
That lady had a surgery
scheduled for next month.

527
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,462
Vasu, get me the
key ofthe bike.

528
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,471
Let's take the leg that
he kicked her with.

529
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:09,436
- There's another problem.
- What's the problem?

530
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,801
His house is not here.

531
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:12,311
A
a Elm Kasanm

532
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:13,345
If it's in Kasaragod...

533
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:15,472
- Where?
- Kasaragod.

534
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:17,374
Sc**wed !

535
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,486
Are you leaving?

536
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:25,485
You have great connections
everywhere, right?

537
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,217
I have connections.

538
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:28,894
That's true.

Do you what we should
do to that boy?

540
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:33,990
We should catch him, thulp him, make him
fall at Pinku's feet and apologize.

541
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,165
And make him prostrate
in front of his mom.

We might not get tickets to go by train.

Okay bro.

Vasu never came after that, right?

I thought it won't be urgent.

Didn't Annan tell you?

No, mom.

drop the metal near the motor.

But still, why did he say like that?

717
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,648
What you said was
correct, RaghuAnnan!

718
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,314
Amazing piCK-UP!

719
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,419
And great mileage,
since it won't run.

720
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,567
Shall I wave bye?

721
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:33,271
Don't eat all that.
It's oily.

722
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,306
What oil?

723
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,707
I don't care.

724
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:39,011
We'll get the car ready, bro.

725
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,676
That Rappayi..
Loser!

726
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:43,340
I'll have to hear a
mouthful from mom.

727
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,745
She'll curse me like
hell if she knows this.

728
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,408
We'll figure out a way.

729
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,681
How will we go now?

730
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:49,947
That's what I'm thinking.

731
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:53,558
Shall I give you an idea?

732
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:54,993
Shall we go in a bus?

733
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,624
No! That won't work out.

734
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,427
A
E

735
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:01,525
Anyway, we've left...

736
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,792
Now we must finish the job.

737
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:04,636
Sreekutta...

738
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:08,074
there's a Mookambika travel
agency at that junction.

739
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,274
Right next to Meenakshi jewellery.

740
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:11,768
You can't spot it easily.

741
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:13,572
Go and tell them my name.
They will give a car.

742
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:14,875
Bro, after going there...

743
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,972
Go, man!
Just say my name!

744
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:18,509
Go, dude.

745
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:19,584
Should I come?

746
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,653
And...

747
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:23,084
Pick a good car.

748
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:24,389
Okay.

749
00:38:27,593 --> 00:38:28,560
Renju...

750
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,592
Take this card and
withdraw 6000 Rupees.

751
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:35,534
Fifty four Fifty four.

752
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,468
Go fast, man.

753
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,595
Won't even let me drink tea.

754
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,369
- 5445?
- Yes.

755
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:46,511
Good idea.

756
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,772
- They said they don't know me?
- No one knows you.

757
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:52,780
What ifthey are scared of me...

758
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,344
They know only one Raghu
who cuts Shawarmas.

759
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:57,422
If you could come with me...

760
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,320
a
a

761
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:03,851
Your password is 5445, right?

762
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:05,362
Ya. Fifty four Fifty four.

763
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,862
I thought it was Fifty four Fony five.

764
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:12,063
Some messages popped up belowthe
screen, and heard some beep sounds.

765
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,868
I came out, swore at the security
guard, pushed him down and came.

766
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:15,941
Won'tl be angry?

767
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,008
Sc**wed !

768
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,377
- Blocked it.
- Block again?

769
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:20,611
Where?

770
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,848
Get going!

771
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:23,949
Go!

772
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,519
Bro, what do we do now?

773
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:57,074
Hey Nidheesh!

774
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:58,650
Bro, tell me.
I mean, sir.. tell me.

775
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:02,813
I've been telling you 3-4
times, to send them out.

776
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,719
Don't make me take strict action.

777
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:06,825
Keep quiet.

778
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,690
They look like they're
troublesome people.

779
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,422
- What trouble?
- Sir! Sir!

780
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,089
I've also told you 3-4
times that we can't.

781
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:14,633
What? - If you interfere in this again,
the party will interfere.

782
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,031
Don't put yourselves in trouble.

783
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:20,069
Rememberthat both of you will be coming
back to the college after the tour.

784
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,606
Okay then.
Cool!

785
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:23,600
Look at his bald head.

786
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,970
Ponnappan sir, is this necessary?

787
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:27,974
- Senanna!
- Nidheesh!

788
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,147
Isn't that our Raghu
Annan, sitting there?

789
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:31,712
Yes. How do you
know him, teacher?

790
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:35,120
He arranged a place for me, for
the last Pongala festival.

791
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,154
Really?

792
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:38,023
He is a big goon.

793
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,725
Don't worry.

794
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,127
He is a good goon.

795
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,837
A Qfimmmmn
a

796
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,734
Raghu Anna, this is Nidheesh.

797
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,500
I don't see you at
the gym nowadays.

798
00:40:57,576 --> 00:40:59,135
What do I do after coming there?

799
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,845
I've heard a lot about RaghuAnnan.

800
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:03,748
Where is this tourto?

801
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:04,849
The tour is to Bangalore.

802
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,884
Is it via Kasaragod?

803
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:06,918
No. That's Mangalore.

804
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,019
This is Bangalore.

805
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,180
Shall I take a selfie with you, bro?

806
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,184
Why not?

807
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,617
Not you.
Raghu Annan's...

808
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,251
- Later.
- Later.

809
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:17,529
Em?
E

810
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:18,654
Okay then.

811
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,698
Play the music.

812
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:20,698
Increase the volume.

813
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:42,220
Renju bro!

814
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:43,277
Come!

815
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,561
Senanna, ask him not to drink.

816
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,630
You know, right?
He'll be sloshed in 2 pegs.

817
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:54,790
Hey Renju!

818
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:55,834
Renju!

819
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,215
Ponnappan sir, walk slowly.

820
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,609
- Don't hold me.
- Hey! Look!

821
00:42:13,752 --> 00:42:14,719
'Puttu' shop.

822
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,054
Tell me.

823
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:19,216
We started from there in the morning.

824
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,918
You'll get good 'Puttu' here.

825
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:24,821
Nidheesh, call them too.

826
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,226
- They will come, teacher.
- Did you tell them?

827
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,124
Look at them, dude.

828
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,534
Come!

829
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,198
Don't lose control, bro.

830
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:34,839
Here.

831
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,930
Dad calling.

832
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:37,275
Cut.

833
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,639
Renju! Hey!

834
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,736
You guys leave.
I'll handle him.

835
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,176
I want him.

836
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:44,215
He's sloshed!

837
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,042
This is really sad.

838
00:42:46,652 --> 00:42:47,619
You com e.

839
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,887
Aren't you coming, bro?

840
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:51,053
- I'm not coming.
- Come, bro.

841
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:52,851
We'll have some great
'Puttu' and beef.

842
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,260
- You finished?
- Ya. Enough.

843
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:04,298
Em
a

844
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:06,738
Even the beef.

845
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,671
You com e.
Let's ask them.

846
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,810
Anju, we don't...

847
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:15,907
We don't knowthis place at all.

848
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:17,574
Ifthe boys knowthis, it
will be a huge problem.

849
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,649
And, you remember the
last tour, right?

850
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:20,651
It will be that situation.

851
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:22,950
Let him grope people at his house.

852
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:25,749
We can't let this go, teacher.
We should question them.

853
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:26,791
What you said is true.

854
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:28,257
They deserve a pounding.

855
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,887
But in this situation, there won't
be a single soul to help us.

856
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:34,599
Com e.

857
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:36,960
Rememberwhat I said?

858
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,400
Don't even look at them.

859
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:46,875
- We are still here.
- Don't look at them.

860
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:47,912
Awesome item.

861
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:49,777
- What is it, dear?
- Get lost!

862
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,810
- Will you take us also in this bus?
- What a chick!

863
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:54,876
- I have an idea.
- Let me click a photo?

864
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,047
Everyone got in?

865
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:00,283
A
Em

866
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:04,626
- What is this?
- What?

867
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,896
To bring disgrace to us.

868
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,933
Efim
EFEm

869
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:10,363
Shut up and sit there.

870
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:11,736
I'll sit...

871
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:13,794
Where is Raghu Annan?

872
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:15,237
E51

873
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:19,266
You handle him.
Let me go see.

874
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:20,903
What did you do to my RaghuAnnan?

875
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,113
What for?

876
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,181
Tell me the truth!

877
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,375
@!@$@%
Sit there!

878
00:44:48,707 --> 00:44:51,301
Hey! If you have to say something,
say it on the spot.

879
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:52,673
Don't keep it in your mind.

880
00:44:52,778 --> 00:44:54,177
I'm saying this out of concern.

881
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:56,371
We might not get time for it later.

882
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:19,093
Raghu Anna, is it urgent?
Can't we stop at the nextjunction?

883
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:22,100
What does he have to do here?

884
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,069
Senanna!

885
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:29,737
E
a

886
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:31,917
You could have come
further with us.

887
00:45:31,984 --> 00:45:33,975
Raghu Annan has some
urgent work here.

888
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:35,417
- Shall we leave?
- Hey Nidheesh!

889
00:45:35,754 --> 00:45:37,449
- First you get into the bus!
- Look at this.

890
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:39,383
Always blabbering.

891
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:41,927
- Leave it, brother.
- Raghu Anna!

892
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,494
Bye!

893
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:45,087
- Okay then! Call me!
- Okay! Bye!

894
00:45:45,163 --> 00:45:46,528
Bye!

895
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:47,832

What a cultured professor!

897
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,401
Senanna, look!

898
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:57,976
Puking?

899
00:45:59,778 --> 00:46:01,439
Was this why he asked
them to stop rig ht here?

900
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:03,545
- Raghu Anna.
- Massage my back!

901
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:05,250
- What happened?
- Senanna!

902
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,014
- Here you go, bro.
- Massage him, bro.

903
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,449
- Did he drink?
- Did he? Who knows?

904
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:17,020
Didn't I tell you rascals
that I can't come in a bus?

905
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,529
In our present situation...

906
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,767
Give him water.

907
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,334
Take me to the hospital.

And if there's some loose
motion or something,

914
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:55,400
just tell me, okay?

915
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:56,901
Okay?

916
00:46:57,269 --> 00:46:59,135
Will it come announcing its arrival?

917
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:00,565
How are you now, bro?

918
00:47:01,006 --> 00:47:03,566
There's a slight pain here..

919
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:06,877
Didn't I tell you that we
don't have to take a bus?

920

We didn't have any other option, bro.

921

Once this glucose is
over, we can go, rig ht?

Don't you have any mercy?

When someone's lying here,
without being able to get up!

925
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:19,249
So let's go tomorrow, aftertaking rest.

926

To take a room, this scoundrel
blocked the only card I had.

some friend's house here?

Do you know anyone here?

930
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,427
Didn't we save a guy from
that Beemapalli case?

The fatso with a
chain on his neck?

- Dominic!

933

His house is here in Vypin.
I have his number.

934
00:47:37,342 --> 00:47:38,537
Then call and ask him.

935
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,537
Tell him it's for Raghu Annan.

Don't tell the guy who's coming
thatl have loose motion.

938
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:47,418
Say some big name for it in English.

Some honourable name?

00:47:50,255 --> 00:47:51,381

can take the body happily.

Pinku and his mom were
coming from the hospital.

968
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,157
We should finish him.

969
00:48:59,224 --> 00:49:01,192
The one who pushed his mother,
we should get into his house &finish him.

970

Tell me.
Where is he?

971
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:04,354
His house is in Kasaragod.

Haven't you heard of it?

I have heard.

It's not that.

976
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,703
I have to go to the police
station and sign daily.

977
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:14,068
It's a bad scene with cops.

978
00:49:14,573 --> 00:49:16,541
If not forthat, I could have also come.

979
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:20,668
Tell me if you need anything else in Kochi.
Dominic is here.

980
00:49:20,745 --> 00:49:21,712
A place to stay?

981
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:23,080
That's difficult.

982
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:27,313
Still... Let me try.

But I didn't succumb.

1010
00:55:25,743 --> 00:55:29,373
Then she told me that the girl
is ready elope at the terrace.

We have to reach Kasaragod.

Don't play dumbbell

- Where is Raghu Annan?
- He's brushing his teeth in between all this.

Brushing his teeth?

- Last night.

1023

Wash your mouth and come out.

That won't be right.

You know the way, right?
Go there and meet Britto.

I've told him everything.

If you go there and meet Britto,
he'll take you straight to Kasaragod.

00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,164
Yes. Saw you guys.
Come here.

1071
00:57:32,003 --> 00:57:33,630
We should have just
gone straight there.

1072
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:34,705
When will we reach now?

1073
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,068
Shouldn't we drop this car, bro?

1074
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:39,675
- RaghuAnnan?
- This is the guy.

1075
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:41,971
Britto had said that
RaghuAnnan will come.

1076
00:57:42,914 --> 00:57:43,938
EU
E

1077
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:45,015
Com e.

1078
00:57:49,787 --> 00:57:52,051
Mum

1079
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:54,486
He was about to leave for a case.

1080
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:56,453
That's when he heard
that you're coming.

1081
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:59,154
He called the coun immediately
and postponed that case.

1082
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:03,024
'Suicide is not a solution for anything'

1083
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:07,838
Britto etta...

1084
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:13,938
Raghu Annan, right?

1085
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,072
See howl guessed correctly.

1086
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:19,506
Sit down.
Why are you standing?

1087
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,815
You are quite something!

1088
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:27,057
So.. What's the next plan?

1089
00:58:27,525 --> 00:58:28,788
We have to go to Kasaragod.

1090
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:31,052
Dominic told all that to me in detail.

1091
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,661
What's the plan, right here, right now?

1092
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:35,529
- Shall we open a bottle?
- Awesome.

1093
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,193
Didn't I tell you?
It's awesome here.

1094
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:41,866
So you go and buy some
mixture <i>&</i> some cutlets.

1095
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,566
There's garlic pickle
in the kitchen, right?

1096
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:45,632
A
a amgyfihflmu Em

1097
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:50,113
An awesome guy like you haven't come to
Chavakkad or anywhere near this hostel.

1098
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:51,875
We should celebrate this.

1099
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:54,178
Dude, do you knowwho this guy is?

1100
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:57,221
- 'Airavaf?
- 'Airavaf?

1101
00:58:57,755 --> 00:58:59,883
He is one hell of an 'Airavat'.

1102
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:02,292
In the temple festival
at his home town,

1103
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,028
30 guys surrounded him.

1104
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:07,196
- Was it 30?
- It was 3, right?

1105
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:09,800
<i>Ems</i>
E

1106
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:13,963
Like Abhimanyu was surrounded in the
Mahabharat, while was holding a wheel.

1107
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:15,005
Ascene like that.

1108
00:59:15,106 --> 00:59:19,134
They had swords, shields and whatnot.

1109
00:59:19,277 --> 00:59:20,802
What he had...

1110
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:22,976
was just a small piece of a blade.

1111
00:59:23,347 --> 00:59:24,542
Just five minutes.

1112
00:59:24,649 --> 00:59:25,616
Is that so?

1113
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,017
Then?

1114
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,052
As if you don't know.

1115
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:30,820
Only footprints remained where
those people were standing.

1116
00:59:31,255 --> 00:59:32,620
All ofthem escaped.

1117
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,280
E
E

1118
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:36,560
And then?

1119
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,286
So Raghu Anna..
Which is your brand?

1120
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:39,363
Shall we have a peg each?

1121
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:41,856
Did you guys eat something?

1122
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,196
No. We ate last nig ht.

1123
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:44,666
Keep quiet.

1124
00:59:44,802 --> 00:59:47,134
What is this, Raghu Anna?
After coming here?

1125
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:48,796
Come. Let's go eat something.

1126
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:50,032
Come. Let's go eat.

1127
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:51,341
Lunch is ready here.

1128
00:59:51,609 --> 00:59:52,701
E
a

1129
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:55,636
So Raghu Anna, it will be better
that we eat from outside.

1130
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,111
You have it yourself.

1131
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,777
Nowwe can plan
everything after lunch.

1132
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,986
Let's decide where to
have lunch from, first.

1133
01:00:03,221 --> 01:00:07,124
The 'Kolli' <i>&</i> 'Potti' from Shoshanna's
shop is famous in Chavakkadu.

1134
01:00:07,325 --> 01:00:08,292
What is this Kolli?

1135
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:10,591
It's a food item from this area.

1136
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:12,024
An item madefrom rice powder.

1137
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,996
Em
a

1138
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:16,065
I come here for many body
shows in this area, right?

1139
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:18,034
After digging a hole in
the middle ofthe Kolli,

1140
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:20,068
you should pour the
Potti curry into it.

1141
01:00:20,238 --> 01:00:22,070
- Then you should have it.
- ls it really tasty?

1142
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,604
Not as much as he claims.

1143
01:00:23,741 --> 01:00:25,709
It's nice. - There's something
elsethat not many know.

1144
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,369
You should keep two
Papads on top of it.

1145
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:32,008
W515

1146
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,642
ls it too farfrom here?

1147
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,276
Seems like you're really hungry.

1148
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:39,712
H@HH@E

1149
01:00:40,358 --> 01:00:41,257
What is it?

1150
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,191
Emaâ

1151
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:45,724
That's okay.
I'll go and get it.

1152
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:46,989
Okay. Bye.

1153
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:49,834
Renju, we'll go there forfive minutes.

1154
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:52,668
After collecting the cash,
we'll have Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1155
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,736
- What say, Raghu Anna?
- We're not in any hurry.

1156
01:00:55,773 --> 01:00:57,036
Hey Britto bro..

1157
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,133
Lonappi said that you had some case...

1158
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:02,710
This L0nappill

1159
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:06,976
It happened before I become a goon.

1160
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,677
I didn't have any money with me,

1161
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:11,752
no job, and when I felt
that life had no meaning,

1162
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:13,449
I tried to commit suicide.

1163
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:15,851
It flopped!

1164
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,886
Then with all the fights and all,
I reached this stature.

1165
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:21,392
There's no other case in my name.

1166
01:01:21,899 --> 01:01:23,389
Except for this one.

1167
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:27,703
IPC 306 for attempt to suicide.

1168
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:29,838
The scene is that...

1169
01:01:30,174 --> 01:01:32,165
to humiliate me every once in a while,

1170
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,277
the coun keeps
hearings as it pleases.

1171
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:36,313
Amazing!

1172
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:38,040
I should havejust died then.

1173
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:44,019
Even now, whenl sit idle,

1174
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,017
I feel like committing suicide.

1175
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:47,114
Just like that.

1176
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:52,724
When the construction of
flats are going on here,

1177
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,492
we send our boys for security.

1178
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:56,999
This is the cash dealing for that.

1179
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:05,032
Just five minutes.
I'll be right back.

1180
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:06,508
After that, Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1181
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:09,311
Is he mocking us?

1182
01:02:09,447 --> 01:02:11,973
- What all kinds of people!
- Atotal spelling mistake.

1183
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:16,879
I'm also coming.

1184
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:21,225
Peeing is fine..
Don't overdo it.

1185
01:02:23,794 --> 01:02:25,091
What does land cost over here?

1186
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:26,330
Around 3 Lakhs?

1187
01:02:26,797 --> 01:02:27,923
We can get it for 2.5 Lakhs.

1188
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:29,032
Do you want?

1189
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:31,768
Sreekutta...

1190
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,069
Did your uncle's property get sold?

1191
01:02:34,238 --> 01:02:35,228
Who knows?

1192
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:36,501
You're his nephew, right?

1193
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:38,939
Did he sell it without consulting you?

1194
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,940
Hey! Why do you want
to know all that?

1195
01:02:41,012 --> 01:02:42,002
I was just asking, bro.

1196
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,945
Renjuttan, can you do me a favour?

1197
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:46,141
Can you give company
to this nut?

1198
01:02:48,019 --> 01:02:48,986
Hello!

1199
01:02:49,854 --> 01:02:50,821
What's happening?

1200
01:02:53,157 --> 01:02:54,215
Sc**wed!
Who is it?

1201
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:55,417
A
E- [hmppnam]?

1203
01:02:57,461 --> 01:02:59,020
- Did he jump?
- Raghu Anna!

1204
01:02:59,096 --> 01:03:00,495
He's not dead, bro.
Here comes Britto.

1205
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:02,259
- Stan the car.
- Come on!

1206
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,959
- Stan the car!
- Get in.

1207
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:05,194
Get in!
I'll kick him.

1208
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,270
Get in.

1209
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,095
- Stan the car.
- Raghu Anna, get in.

1210
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:09,899
EEK;
E

1211
01:03:10,408 --> 01:03:12,103
Enough. Turn!

1212
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,142
A
a

1213
01:03:14,812 --> 01:03:16,337
- Britto, go!
- What's the matter?

1214
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:20,072
Chechi, you have more
ofthis yellow chutney?

1215
01:03:20,151 --> 01:03:22,051
E
E

1216
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:23,445
Britto, what's the matter?

1217
01:03:24,355 --> 01:03:26,050
That scoundrel who called
me to give the cash...

1218
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,056
He had given a contract against me.

1219
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,417
The guy who fell from the top?
It's his building.

1220
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:32,919
I have to stay away for 2 days.

1221
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,790
Let me come back here after that.
I'll get back at him.

1222
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,537
Raghu Annan...

1223
01:03:40,905 --> 01:03:42,100
You guys get down here.

1224
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:44,533
Don't be tensed.

1225
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:46,606
I'll arrange another vehicle
to go to Kasaragod.

1226
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:47,868
Let me talk.
Get down.

1227
01:03:48,012 --> 01:03:49,343
- I'll tell you. Come on.
- Get down.

1228
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,277
Dude, is he ditching us?

1229
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:54,512
Almost like that.

1230
01:03:54,852 --> 01:03:56,047
Hey! You don't worry.

1231
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,449
Either I will come back,
or my people will come.

1232
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:00,021
You should wait here itself.

1233
01:04:00,124 --> 01:04:01,285
Phones might not be reachable.

1234
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:02,426
Okay then.

1235
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:03,585
I'm really sorry.

1236
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:07,196
I couldn't buy the Kolli <i>&</i> Potti
from Shoshanna's shop for you.

1237
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:09,255
It's okay. We'll have it
next time you come here.

1238
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,367
Okay.

1239
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:11,568
Bye.

1240
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:14,304
Loser!

1241
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:15,930
Is he the great Chavakkadu Britto?

1242
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:17,341
Schmuck!

1243
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,398
He's a goon, it seems!

1244
01:04:20,244 --> 01:04:22,338
He's walking around with a
suicide note in his pocket.

1245
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,505
His damn Kolli <i>&</i> Potti.

1246
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,278
To drink a little water,
he blocked the card I had.

1247
01:04:28,352 --> 01:04:30,548

01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:35,583
What is it, mom?

1250
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,161
What's happening, son?

1251
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:38,587
We're on ourway.

1252
01:04:38,996 --> 01:04:40,225
Did you eat something?

1253
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,599
I had Appam.

1254
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:44,530
Eat on time, okay!

1255
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:46,265
You have ulcer.

1256
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,529
Did you have the medicines for pressure?

1257
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,665
Dasappan came and
unloaded the metal.

1258
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:53,877
- At the courtyard?
- No. At the backside.

1259
01:04:54,545 --> 01:04:57,037
And ya"
I've got some good fish.

1260
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,578
I'll go give it when I visit
Pinku tomorrow morning.

1261
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:01,651
Poor thing.

1262
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,487
Give it.

1263
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:06,121
Son, be careful...
Okay?

1264
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:07,415
They are Nonhies...

1265
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:08,992
I'll call you later, mom.

1266
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:20,364
E

1267
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:22,338
Britto ettan sent this vehicle.
Hop on.

1268

E

1269
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:27,510
- Britto ettan gave it foryou.
- Thank you, brother.

1270
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:29,909
Senanna, shall we look for a bus?

1271
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:32,378
- Well, I was just saying..
- Why? To collect puke?

1272
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,142
We started in a car.

1273
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,946
And now we've ended up in a lorry.

1274
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,554
Such a plight!

1275
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:39,247
So, straight to Kasaragod.

1276
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:44,057
It's tapioca!

1277
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:46,653
So this is what he was
referring to as Kolli.

1278
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:49,927
What did you say?
Item made with rice powder?

1279
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:51,263
He has eaten it a lot, it seems.

1280
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,460
Why do you lie so much, bro?

1281
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,365
There's another item called Kolli, man.

1282
01:05:55,973 --> 01:05:56,940
Made with rice powder.

1283
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:58,542
I swear on my mom.

1284
01:05:58,609 --> 01:05:59,576
That's Kolam.

1285
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,075
Used to draw sketches
in front ofthe house.

1286
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:02,340
- This is Kolli.
- Whatever.

1287
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,346
What is this, bro?
You also don't object to it.

1288
01:06:04,448 --> 01:06:05,609

Give it here.

1290
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:11,080
I haven't eaten anything
since day before yesterday.

1291
01:06:11,422 --> 01:06:13,413
Whatever said and done,
that Britto is a good guy.

1292
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:16,523
So much fat!
ls this beef?

1293
01:06:16,627 --> 01:06:17,594
This is Potti.

1294
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:20,188
Intestine of the buffalo.

1295
01:06:21,098 --> 01:06:25,001
If it's at home, we'll turn it over
with a string, and clean it properly.

1296
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:26,565
I don't know how
it is, in hotels.

1297
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,199
It's nice, bro.
Have it.

1298
01:06:34,144 --> 01:06:36,306
You know cow dung?

1299
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:37,380
Stop <i>m</i>

1300
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:40,416
Made me hate the food.

1301
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:42,519
What is this, bro?

1302
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:49,556
- Bro, the cow dung that's...
- I'll break your head.

1303
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,185
Why, bro?

1304
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:58,695
This is like increasing
the speed ofthe fan.

1305
01:07:00,237 --> 01:07:02,763
As we reach every new place, the
number of goons is increasing.

1306
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,408
Now what will happen
when we reach Kasaragod?

1307
01:07:09,246 --> 01:07:10,213
Hey!

1308
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:11,348
Sree, what's the time?

1309
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,542
It's past 8.45 PM, bro.

1310
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:15,643
Don't you guys drink?

1311
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:17,414
We drink, bro.
Of course.

1312
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:18,455
What to drink?

1313
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:20,315
Arrange a set up for that, man.

1314
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:22,290
- Oh! Like that.
- Oh! To arrange, huh?

1315
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:26,093
Can't even find a street shop
in this Godforsaken place.

1316
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,062
Us drunkard scoundrels
are always like this.

1317
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:29,293
We'll Wait till 8.50 PM.

1318
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,296
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No way.

1319
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:32,435
Let me see.

1320
01:07:32,536 --> 01:07:33,503
Let me ask the driver.

1321
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:35,705
Hello bro!

1322
01:07:36,507 --> 01:07:38,032
Bro, do you have any
booze with you?

1323
01:07:38,108 --> 01:07:39,234

No way, bro.

1327
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,116
What to do, bro?

1328
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,681
Drink this if you want,
and go to sleep.

1329
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,821
Got tempted in vain.

1330
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,162
I don't want it.

1331
01:08:02,399 --> 01:08:04,231
Come here, bro.

Oh! Sc**Wed!

Did they hear what we asked
yesterday, only now?

1337
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,624
It's not so crowded now.

1338
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:12,829
- Shall I buy one?
- Let the sun rise, man!

1339
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,373
Is the lorry going to Malayattoor?

1340
01:09:16,473 --> 01:09:17,440
Shut up.

1341
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:22,779

01:10:26,777 --> 01:10:27,972
Move it, if you want to.

1367
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:30,645
Where is he coming from?

1368
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,883
Call me later.

Did you come in a bus?

1372
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:42,923
I was waiting at the market.

1373
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:44,358
I thought you'd get down there.

1374
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:45,862
There weren't any problems
on the way, right? - No.

1375
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:46,963
What is he saying?

1376
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:48,926
We came in a lorry.

- On the way!
- No! No!

1378
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:52,797
I heard everything
through the phone.

1379
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,238
The one who tried to kill his mom, should be
kicked to death <i>&</i> stuck as a wall poster.

1380
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,671
And then we should
make him apologize.

That's what you want, right?

1382
01:10:58,876 --> 01:10:59,843
Not that.

1383
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,341
We should kidnap the
boy from his house,

1384
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:03,345
and punch him right on his
face a couple oftimes.

1385
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,845
Then put him in the car
<i>&</i> go to Trivandrum.

1386
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:06,041
Isn't that what hejust said?

- Is it?
- Yes.

1388
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:09,879
You have to catch a guy from here,
take him there and make him apologize.

1389
01:11:09,987 --> 01:11:10,954

I'll show you his house.

- I'm not getting in there.
- Why do you have to come, bro?

1419

Is this the house?

Great!

1428
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,071
There are 10-15 kitchens in this house.

1429
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,138
Go ahead.

1430
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:36,706

What is this, bro?
Secretariat?

1432
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:40,601
This is Samad Bhai's house.

1433
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:42,141

Ifl go there, I'll be all violent.

You can be short-tempered
or whatever...

1443
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:01,363
- Go hit him and come.
- You were excited the most, right? Go!

1444
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:02,589
I haven't brushed my teeth.

1445
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,634

Rathees h, control.

Bro, what is this?

1458
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:26,750
Who is Samad among them?

1459
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,890
- There are many people.
- There's a camera there.

1460
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,984
What's on his head, bro?
Solar panel?

Keep quiet, man.

1462

01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:16,472
Let us also get scared.

1480
01:14:16,673 --> 01:14:18,004
Bro, someone kidnapped that boy.

1481
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:19,973
Some team from Trivandrum.

1482
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:21,210
Stop!

1483
01:14:21,812 --> 01:14:22,779

Mp?

1486
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:29,775
Moreover, when he called again,
we insulted him, it seems.

1487
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:33,983
Why did I ever think of attending
your call, and coming to that house?

1488
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:35,718
But who kidnapped him
from Trivandrum?

1489
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:41,130
Dad calling.

Is this Raghu?

1494
01:14:47,604 --> 01:14:48,571
Mom?

1495
01:14:49,306 --> 01:14:52,469
I came to the General
Hospital to meet Pinku.

1496
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:55,102
I don't understand what
these guys are saying.

1497
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,042
Uncle, one second.

1498
01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:00,813
RaghuAnnan, many people
have come to the hospital.

1499
01:15:00,984 --> 01:15:02,748
Why so many people for
such a small matter?

I knowthat my son is with you.

1504
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,195
You understood who all
are with me now, right?

1505
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,232
Raghu, do one thing.

1506
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:25,733
I give you time till tomorrow morning.

1507
01:15:26,343 --> 01:15:28,869
Whenl open my eyes after
my morning prayers,

1508
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:31,080
Sallu should be in front of me.

1509
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:33,549
Or else...

1510
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,651
Raghu will know who this Samad is.

1511
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,054
Hey! Hey!

1512
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:39,920
Don't give punch dialogues, man!

1513
01:15:40,323 --> 01:15:41,757
We didn't kidnap your son.

1514
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:44,016
I know that you won't believe
us when we say that.

1515
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:45,721
Hey!
Listen to this as well.

1516
01:15:46,196 --> 01:15:48,722
Afteryour morning prayer,
your son will be in front of you.

1517
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:49,932
That's a different case.

1518
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,967
And ya...

1519
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:54,265

you'll know who this Raghu is.

1522
01:15:58,241 --> 01:15:59,208
You will know!

1523
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,379
Bro, how's it going down yourthroat?

1524
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:46,989
Now look!

1525
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:48,751
Didn't you eat all that intestine?

1526
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:50,892
It's been 2 days sincel
ate something properly.

1527
01:16:51,094 --> 01:16:55,088
I've been starving, puking, and growing
dark, ever since I joined you guys.

1528
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:56,332
And look at him asking!

1529
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,929
I asked out of tension.

1530
01:16:58,001 --> 01:16:59,059
Only you have tension?

1531
01:16:59,302 --> 01:17:00,269
Damn!

1532
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:02,763
I said whatever came to mind,
just for a punch...

1533
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,707
He has kept my mom
hostage there!

We're all counting on you.

1540
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,617
If we don't get that boy,
all five of us are trapped.

1541
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,088
- But there's only four of you, right?
- You'll also be trapped.

1542
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:21,915
Where do we go and search?

1543
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,292
Didn't we travel from
Kanyakumari to Kasaragod?

1544
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:27,089
If there was a party flag as well, we could
have named it' Kerala Yatra' (Journey).

1545
01:17:27,998 --> 01:17:29,727
But where's that rascal?

1546
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:31,233
Salman was in Trivandrum.

1547
01:17:31,334 --> 01:17:33,666
This what happens if you
start before thinking twice.

1548
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:35,034
Bro, what's the point
in saying all this now?

1549
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:36,936
If we don't find that boy somehow...

1550
01:17:40,277 --> 01:17:41,244
Put some more.

01:17:47,817 --> 01:17:48,784
I'm listening.

1554
01:17:48,852 --> 01:17:50,980
From what you're saying, it seems
like I'm carrying him in my pocket!

1555
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:52,451
I haven't even seen him.

1556
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,453
Anyway, what has
happened, has happened.

1557
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:56,055
You came from Trivandrum, rig ht?

1558
01:17:56,293 --> 01:17:57,761
I'll help you to find him.

Don't put me in trouble.

1560

You don't be scared.
I'm here, right?

1561
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:01,931
We'll go straight to Trivandrum,

1562
01:18:01,998 --> 01:18:04,023
and kick Samad in his guts.

1563
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,067
Problem solved.

1564
01:18:06,036 --> 01:18:07,435
We didn't kidnap his son, right?

1565
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:09,171
- Let him find out.
- Let him.

1566
01:18:09,339 --> 01:18:11,933
In the worst case scenario, if you
lose your hand or leg, let it go!

1567
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:13,442
I'll make sure that you stay alive.

1568

Bro, some 'Rassam'.

1569

This is fish curry.

1570
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:21,484
Was it fish curry?

1571
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:22,685
Then pour it.

1572
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:28,754
It's nothing else, Ratheesh.

1573
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:31,761
Where did he go?

01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:05,725
I've been living a good life without
creating any trouble, for a long time now.

1593
01:19:05,795 --> 01:19:07,854
I got your call when I
stepped out to buy curd.

1594
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:09,922
I didn't know that it was
an invitation for my death.

1595
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,900
Mala

1596
01:19:12,235 --> 01:19:13,725
You don't know that
Samad well enough.

1597
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:15,897
Your photo has reached
all the goons.

1598
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:20,375
And, for an urgent need,
I have stolen a purse from you guys.

1599
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:22,367
I'll return it some day.

1600
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:24,809
Don't stay here anymore.
Escape as soon as you can.

1601
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:25,948
Okay?

1602
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:28,208
If you're alive, we'll meet again.
Bye.

1603
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:31,282
The one who came with all the
heart to stand with you,

1604
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:32,445
took everything we had.

1605
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,549
Bro, even my Aadhar card is in that.

1606
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,154
Bro, have you linked your
Aadhar to your bank?

1607
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,092
No. I'll link it after this.

1608
01:19:39,162 --> 01:19:40,459
How much is the bill?
Let me see.

1609
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:43,156
E
E

1610
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:45,924
I have only 140 Rupees.

1611
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:48,061
- How much do you have?
- My card is with Sunanda.

1612
01:19:48,138 --> 01:19:49,469
Efiiififiimm
E

1613
01:19:50,307 --> 01:19:52,401
- How much do you have?
- I have only some change.

1614
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:53,509
What about you?

1615
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:55,203
Bro, I came just like that, no?

1616
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:57,179
Came just like that?

1617
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:58,281
Came just like that?

1618
01:19:58,348 --> 01:20:00,112
Camejust like that to beat
up a guy in Kasaragod.

1619
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:01,149
You...

1620
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:03,286
Look.

1621
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:04,581
I must have some 750 Rupees.

1622
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,447
- Give it.
- It's at home.

1623
01:20:06,523 --> 01:20:08,013
Have you kept it in
your aunt's piggy bank?

1624
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:09,959
Ask her to throw it from there.

1625
01:20:10,527 --> 01:20:12,461
- Bro, what do we do now?
- What to do?

1626
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:13,796
Let's walk.

1627
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:15,023
Let's walk to Trivandrum.

1628
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:17,063
If we get that boy on the way,
we'll take him too.

1629
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:20,831
Let's all bejolly, sing songs,
narrate stories and go happily.

1630
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:24,830
Why did I ever think of
coming with you losers?

1631
01:20:25,408 --> 01:20:27,570
Bro, can't we withdraw
money from the bank?

1632
01:20:27,644 --> 01:20:29,373
Has your dad kept the bank
open on a 2nd Saturday?

1633
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,177
Bro, give me all you have.

1634
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:33,416
Here.
Eat it.

1635
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,318
Here.

1636
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:40,555
Yes, bro.

1637
01:20:40,623 --> 01:20:41,590
Tell me.

1638
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:54,870
Who's that?

1639
01:20:57,273 --> 01:20:58,240
From Kasaragod?

1640
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,947
Then I'll go.

1641
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:08,117
Okay.

1642
01:21:08,518 --> 01:21:09,883
I'll go to the hospital then.

1643
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:17,326
Hey!

1644
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,859
Britto's phone is switched off.

1645
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:21,063
Didn't I tell you?
Do one thing. Call Dominic.

1646
01:21:30,573 --> 01:21:31,540
He's not picking up.

1647
01:21:32,442 --> 01:21:33,603
Dude, he's not picking up.

1648
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:38,241
You're ogling at women, when
we're all sc**wed here?

1649
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:39,883
Eisamg
a

1650
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,217
Bro!

1651
01:21:41,484 --> 01:21:43,282
Can't we transfer money online?

1652
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,952
That won't work out.
There will be many problems.

1653
01:21:46,055 --> 01:21:48,888
Are they any others who would stand
with you with all their heart?

1654
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:58,089
When I'm controlling myself,
I am being forced to do it.

1655
01:21:59,969 --> 01:22:00,902
Bro!

1656
01:22:01,704 --> 01:22:03,172
Don't do anything drastic, bro.

1657
01:22:03,306 --> 01:22:04,273
Please.

1658
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:12,006
I have come nearAttukaal.

1659
01:22:12,081 --> 01:22:13,708
My aunt's house is nearby.
Cherumukku.

1660
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:19,522
What are you still scratching for?

1661
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:21,057
If you scratch again,
a ghost will come out from it.

1662
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:22,421
Keep it and give us the money.

1663
01:22:26,362 --> 01:22:29,093
You would get thulped nicely in Trivandrum,
right? Then why did you come here?

1664
01:22:29,165 --> 01:22:30,132
What?

1665
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,463
{mum

1666
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:32,729
That's what I'm also saying.

1667
01:22:33,102 --> 01:22:34,729
Mmflpu

1668
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:36,730
It's rolled gold, mister!

1669
01:22:41,077 --> 01:22:42,135
That's not possible.

1670
01:22:43,012 --> 01:22:43,979
No way!

1671
01:22:44,314 --> 01:22:45,509
Mom gave it for my birthday.

1672
01:22:45,748 --> 01:22:47,409
I should be handing you
overto the police.

1673
01:22:47,484 --> 01:22:49,680
But ifthe police
takes you from here,

1674
01:22:49,752 --> 01:22:52,585
it will be a disgrace for
decent Trivandrum-ites like me.

1675
01:22:53,256 --> 01:22:54,223
That's why.

1676
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,459
What to do now?
That's not possible.

1677
01:22:59,095 --> 01:23:00,062
Mom also fooled you, huh?

1678
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:04,400
Did mom give this?

1679
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:05,501
Yes.

1680

1681
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:27,223
No, bro.

01:23:27,457 --> 01:23:28,424
No, bro.

1683
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:30,055
Hey! Sreekutta.

1684
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:32,125
If Sunanda knows this,
she'll kill me.

1685
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:33,559
Bro, you don't know its value.

1686
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:36,327
Give it. -When I wear it,
it's like Sunanda is with me.

1687
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:38,627
Bro, don't try to separate us.

1688
01:23:38,701 --> 01:23:39,759

Please don't do this.

1692
01:23:46,576 --> 01:23:47,543
Bro, I love her.

1693
01:23:47,777 --> 01:23:48,744
I know.

1694
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:50,079
I know.

1695
01:23:50,146 --> 01:23:51,113
Bro!

1696
01:24:00,823 --> 01:24:01,790
Hey!

1697
01:24:02,325 --> 01:24:04,191
You've done a great deed.

1698
01:24:04,594 --> 01:24:05,789
You won't understand it now.

1699
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:07,263
And one more thing.

1700
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:09,593
Is that ring saferwith you or over here?

1701
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:11,433
It's safer here.

1702
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:12,568
You can come and take it later.

1703
01:24:12,669 --> 01:24:14,728
E

1704
01:24:15,204 --> 01:24:16,694

ER

1706
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:29,513
What happened, mom?

1707
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:30,586
Hey Pinku!

1708
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:31,654
What happened?

1709
01:24:31,788 --> 01:24:33,119
Who came from Kasaragod?

1710
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:35,249
Tell me.
Tell your brother.

1711
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,622
- What's the problem?
- Keep quiet.

1712
01:24:36,726 --> 01:24:38,057
What's the problem, mom?

1713
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:40,823
Tell me the matter.

1714
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:42,531
Who came from Kasaragod?

1715
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:43,866
Tell me.

1716
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:52,165
Is this how you host weddings, you loser?

1717
01:24:53,109 --> 01:24:54,076
Bloody...

1718
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:57,238
From your service itself, I knew
that you would escape with the girl.

1719
01:24:57,313 --> 01:24:58,542
51H}

1720
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,879
- Your damn event company.
- That was a misunderstanding.

1721
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:02,380
Your and your misunderstanding!

1722
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:03,744
Shut up!

1723
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,118
Raghu bro, I'm in the
midst of an action scene.

1724
01:25:07,223 --> 01:25:08,190
What happened there?

1725
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,316
- Did you get him?
- He's the son of someone called Samad.

1726
01:25:10,426 --> 01:25:12,451
What?
Mangalore Samad?

1727
01:25:13,296 --> 01:25:14,263
Trapped, bro!

1728
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:16,529
Do you know who he is?

1729
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:18,532
You won't get anything
even to bury.

1730
01:25:19,135 --> 01:25:21,570
And, he has a right hand man.

1731
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,638
Bald Thanzeer.

1732
01:25:22,805 --> 01:25:24,705
Don't land in front of him.

1733
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,809
He's notjust dark..
He is the dark knight.

1734
01:25:28,444 --> 01:25:30,640
That loser's photo"
Can you WhatsApp it to me?

1735
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,679
I'll send it to the gangster group.

1736
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:33,442
I forgot his face.

1737
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:34,483
Okay.

1738
01:25:34,584 --> 01:25:35,551
It's here, bro.

1739
01:25:35,952 --> 01:25:39,149
Why is he making me tensed saying that
Samad would kill us <i>&</i> bury us and all?

1740
01:25:39,222 --> 01:25:40,189
Loser!

1741
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:42,481
Why did I ever let him tag along?

1742
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:44,927
Sree, you do one thing.

1743
01:25:45,361 --> 01:25:47,659
Send Salman's photo from his
phone to Dominic on WhatsApp.

1744
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,557
- Give me the phone.
- No tender coconut?

1745
01:25:50,433 --> 01:25:51,400
It's here, bro.

1746
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,370
Here.

1747
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:57,569
This is not sweet.
You have it.

1748
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:13,889
Sahiba...

1749
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:15,789
did you go with this guy?

1750
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:17,893
Yes.

1751
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:19,827
Baba, we're done for!

1752
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:21,430
We are in trouble.

1753
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:22,564
Do you know who this is?

1754
01:26:22,799 --> 01:26:23,823
He is Samad's son.

1755
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,197
Mangalore Samad's.

1756
01:26:25,268 --> 01:26:27,293
Samad? -Yes.
Our Samad? -Yes.

1757
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,564
A

1758
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,607
You wretch!

1759
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:34,833
If you had said one word about this,
I'd have gotten you married to him.

1760
01:26:34,977 --> 01:26:36,741
Now howdol...

1761
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,870
Stop gaping and call RD.

1762
01:26:46,622 --> 01:26:48,886
Hey Prajith.
Cut the call.

1763
01:26:49,992 --> 01:26:51,721
Tell him we'll call once we kill him.

1764
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:53,696
He cut the call.

1765
01:26:53,763 --> 01:26:55,288
Dominic, he should
pick up the phone.

1766
01:26:55,364 --> 01:26:56,490
Whatever you may have to do...

1767
01:26:56,566 --> 01:26:58,398
lfthat boy is hurt even with a tiny scar,

1768
01:26:58,468 --> 01:26:59,435
then we're finished.

1769
01:26:59,669 --> 01:27:02,969
If he keeps calling and
asking if we've killed him?

1770
01:27:03,306 --> 01:27:04,273
Salmaan!

1771
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:06,238
I couldn't recognize that boy.

1772
01:27:06,509 --> 01:27:08,807
I slapped him a couple oftimes,
without recognizing him.

1773
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:10,471
Is there any problem?

1774
01:27:10,813 --> 01:27:11,780
There is a problem.

1775
01:27:11,881 --> 01:27:13,906
RD will kill him now.
Can you do anything?

1776
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:16,716
Do something.

1777
01:27:17,754 --> 01:27:18,915
Ask herto stop crying.

1778
01:27:20,656 --> 01:27:22,556

Wait.

1782
01:27:32,502 --> 01:27:33,469
Move.

1783
01:27:35,304 --> 01:27:37,272
My legs are paining, bro.
I can't walk.

1784
01:27:37,373 --> 01:27:38,932
Hey! Those are Samad's people.

1785
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,373
Jump into their mouths then!

1786
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,910
- What are they doing here?
- Basking in the sun.

1787
01:27:43,546 --> 01:27:44,672
I think it's our photo.

1788
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,748
Is it?

1789
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:48,011
Bro, that's the KSRTC stand.
Let's go there.

Don't look.
Keep going.

1793
01:27:58,628 --> 01:27:59,595
Bhai, phone.

1794
01:28:00,563 --> 01:28:01,530
Who is it?

1795
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:03,832
Baba.

1796
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:07,369
Put it on speaker.

1797
01:28:08,404 --> 01:28:09,371
Hello RD?

1798
01:28:09,605 --> 01:28:10,572
Tell me, Baba.

1799
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,838
RD, don't kill that boy.

1800
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:14,435
That is Samad's son.

1801
01:28:14,577 --> 01:28:15,544
I know, Baba.

1802
01:28:15,745 --> 01:28:17,076
I had decided this.

1803
01:28:17,647 --> 01:28:19,479
Baba, you don't worry.

Who asked you to pick up the call?

Lie down there...

we can even go on that.

Hey!

1817
01:28:56,052 --> 01:28:57,349
What are these losers saying?

1818
01:28:57,453 --> 01:28:59,046
Is it coming from
Trivandrum or going there?

1819
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:00,753
I have no idea.

1820
01:29:03,025 --> 01:29:04,993
See! Even the Bengalis understood.

1821
01:29:05,895 --> 01:29:07,886
Bro, there are no buses
to Trivandrum now.

- Senannan is gone.

Bro, that's Tuticorin.
Come here.

Come, bro.

- Come fast.
- Don't make me run.

1836
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,081
- Where were you?
- Should we go in a bus itself?

1838
01:29:33,756 --> 01:29:35,121
Driver bro, let's go.

1839
01:29:36,759 --> 01:29:37,726
No seat?

1840
01:29:42,732 --> 01:29:44,530
That was one hell of a twist.

1841
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:48,564
He was roaming around us wearing
a catering boy's dress.

1842
01:29:49,038 --> 01:29:50,005
Let Dominic call.

1843
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,911
Hey!

1844
01:29:56,779 --> 01:29:57,940
Give the seat to the lady.

Hey!

1846
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,916
Hey! Give the seat to the lady.

1847
01:30:02,618 --> 01:30:05,383
When I ask you to give the seat,
you're listening to music?

1848
01:30:05,554 --> 01:30:07,113
Who are you to hit my deaf child?

1849
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:09,521
Can a deaf person hear music?

1850
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,150
- You're mocking my child?
- What's the issue?

1851
01:30:11,227 --> 01:30:12,956
Hey! Leave him.

1852
01:30:13,195 --> 01:30:15,630
Stop the bus.
Throwthem out.

1853
01:30:15,765 --> 01:30:17,199
Get out.

1854
01:30:17,466 --> 01:30:20,060
Who are you to manhandle
women and children?

1856
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:24,435
I'll get back at you later.

I'll catch you from Tham banoor.

01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,477
We'll come to Thambanoor soon.

1861
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:32,915
Then what?

1862
01:30:33,049 --> 01:30:35,211
Those who are deaf should sit
on the seats for the deaf.

1863
01:30:36,619 --> 01:30:37,814
What nonsense are you doing?

1864
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,146
They have held my mom hostage.

1865
01:30:39,221 --> 01:30:40,211
And you're fooling around?

1866
01:30:40,756 --> 01:30:41,848
Hey! Call him and go!

1873

Untie him.
Remove the cloth from his mouth.

1874
01:30:57,073 --> 01:30:58,939
Make him happy and sit straight.

All of you look happy.

Hey!

1883
01:31:17,827 --> 01:31:18,794
He is with Ramdev.

1884
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:20,488
The Ramdev we met at the
wedding in Ernakulam?

1885
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:21,530
Yes.

1886
01:31:21,597 --> 01:31:22,860
If we go to Mattanchery,
we'll get him.

1887
01:31:23,099 --> 01:31:25,067
RD is going to kill him.
We should reach Ernakulam before that.

1888
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:28,104
Bro, how do we reach Ernakulam now...

1889
01:31:28,204 --> 01:31:29,171
Are you asking me?

1890
01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:30,630
- Are you?
- Well...

1891
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,675
What happened to him?

1892
01:31:35,144 --> 01:31:36,509
You stood watching, right?

1893
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,647
Walk!

1894
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:39,715
Your situation is so sad.

1895
01:31:39,782 --> 01:31:41,113
People thrashed you up!

1896
01:31:41,517 --> 01:31:42,484
Got in plenty, right?

1897
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:43,981
That hag was mistaken.

Usually you don't get out
in the morning, right?

1905
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,731

Ithought so.

Where are you going?

1910

And take left from there.
That's the safe route.

Okay then.
We should catch up soon.

Tell me if you want now.

1923
01:32:45,381 --> 01:32:47,042
Don't complain later
that you didn't get it.

1924
01:32:47,116 --> 01:32:48,550
No, dude.
You don't have to drink.

1925
01:32:50,152 --> 01:32:51,347
Chetta, is there a toilet here?

1926
01:32:51,654 --> 01:32:52,621
It's at the backside.

1927
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:55,323
It's a special mood to pee
and then drink ajuice.

1928
01:32:57,593 --> 01:32:59,584
Hey! Where's the nearest KSRTC bus stand?

1929
01:32:59,695 --> 01:33:00,992
Just got 1 KM from here.

1930
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:03,098
What is this?

1931
01:33:03,299 --> 01:33:05,165
Bro, nearby..
No! Nothing.

1932
01:33:15,277 --> 01:33:17,803
Jamsheer, I'm leaving
from here today itself.

Don't go out with my auto rickshaw.

1934
01:33:20,349 --> 01:33:21,908
Samad's people will catch you.

1935
01:33:23,085 --> 01:33:25,179
The Trivandrum team?
They would be dead by now.

1936
01:33:25,387 --> 01:33:27,219

I'll reach there and call.

Give me my purse.

1943
01:33:49,178 --> 01:33:51,237
Good that I found it.
What if some policeman found it?

01:33:51,347 --> 01:33:52,678
You schmuck!

1945
01:33:52,982 --> 01:33:55,314
I lost Sunanda's ring
just because of you.

1946
01:33:55,384 --> 01:33:56,977
I ran away because I was scared.

1947
01:33:57,052 --> 01:33:59,020
WWW

1948
01:33:59,088 --> 01:34:00,385
I ran away when I got the purse.

1949
01:34:00,456 --> 01:34:01,423
One slap!

1950
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:06,124
Samad is one who's spread all over
from Kanyakumari to Kasaragod.

1951
01:34:06,228 --> 01:34:08,026
Him and his Samad.
How did you reach here?

1952
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,629
- In my vehicle.
- Which vehicle?

1953
01:34:09,832 --> 01:34:10,799
That's my vehicle.

1954
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:13,000
So you were planning to
escape packing your bags?

1955
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:16,671
- Where's your wife and kid then?
- I sent them on a bus to Kochi.

1956
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,007
If so, you could have
come to Ernakulam,

1957
01:34:19,108 --> 01:34:21,099
ails
a

1958
01:34:21,243 --> 01:34:23,974
Then why didn't you tell me?
I would have let my wife <i>&</i> kid join me.

01:34:25,447 --> 01:34:27,939
@551

1960
01:34:28,017 --> 01:34:29,212
Hey! Pay the money!

1962
01:34:31,954 --> 01:34:33,388
- Get in! Get in.
- So what's happening?

1963
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:34,854
Will anything happen
in Salmaan's case?

1964
01:34:34,924 --> 01:34:36,255
I'll give you one tight slap.

1965
01:34:36,825 --> 01:34:38,020
Get in.
Should I drive?

1966
01:34:38,093 --> 01:34:39,185
You come here.

1967
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:45,166
- Sree, Dominic said he'll set a guy, right?
- Senan, do you have any bottle?

1968
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:46,962
Is there such a set up too?

1969
01:34:47,303 --> 01:34:50,000
Now shall I say a truth?
I didn't drink tea. I had a Sharjah shake.

1970
01:34:54,743 --> 01:34:56,370
Wear the seat belt.

1971
01:34:56,779 --> 01:34:58,975
I can't pay a petty fees
forthat as well, again.

1972
01:34:59,982 --> 01:35:00,949
But Bhai...

1973
01:35:02,084 --> 01:35:03,313
Police was all around me.

1974
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:05,484
That's why I couldn't stop him.

1975
01:35:06,355 --> 01:35:07,322
You don't be tensed.

1976
01:35:07,723 --> 01:35:08,918
We can catch him.

1977
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,017
He won't go anywhere leaving Kochi.

1978
01:35:11,827 --> 01:35:12,794
I swear, RD.

1979
01:35:13,062 --> 01:35:14,496
I will catch him.

1980
01:35:23,539 --> 01:35:24,506
Bhai...

1981
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,783
On whose care/of did he come?

1982
01:35:39,421 --> 01:35:40,388
Mathachan's.

1983
01:35:43,459 --> 01:35:44,984
Good for nothing.

1984
01:35:52,067 --> 01:35:53,034
Bhai,

1985
01:35:53,135 --> 01:35:55,297
if you keep killing everyone with you,

1986
01:35:55,938 --> 01:35:57,337
finally only you'll be remaining.

1987
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:23,918
Get down.

1988
01:38:33,695 --> 01:38:35,686
- What happened, bro?
- Peter is not picking up.

1989
01:38:36,165 --> 01:38:37,326
I think they have killed him.

1990
01:38:37,966 --> 01:38:39,365
Mom is also not
picking up her phone.

1991
01:38:39,668 --> 01:38:40,897
I'm going crazy.

1992
01:38:41,003 --> 01:38:42,129
- What to do?
- Raghu bro!

1993
01:38:42,204 --> 01:38:43,296
Why were you late?

1994
01:38:43,372 --> 01:38:45,136
So all your friends are here.
Shalll leave then?

1995
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,537
Mflmg]?

1996
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:48,937
I've been waiting here
for half an hour.

1997
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:50,069
Where's that boy?

1998
01:38:50,179 --> 01:38:51,374
That's a little troublesome.

1999
01:38:51,613 --> 01:38:52,705
RD got him again.

2000
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:54,346
We should go fast.

2001
01:38:54,616 --> 01:38:55,708
Or else, RD...

2002
01:38:55,984 --> 01:38:56,951
Let's go fast.

2003
01:38:57,052 --> 01:38:59,077
Well, shall we call ourteams?

2004
01:38:59,354 --> 01:39:00,549
- People for back up?
- Call them.

2005
01:39:00,622 --> 01:39:01,589
Lasaretta, com e.

2006
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:04,216
- Shaji, Sadasivan, come.
- They are awesome dudes.

2007
01:39:05,994 --> 01:39:07,519
Why are these uncles coming?

2008
01:39:07,596 --> 01:39:08,722
Are we going to see a bride?

2009
01:39:08,964 --> 01:39:10,090
Who are these people?

2010
01:39:10,232 --> 01:39:11,199
I am Sadasivan.

2011
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:13,367
This is Douglas.
He is Lasar.

2012
01:39:13,435 --> 01:39:15,369
Everyone knows Thoppum pady Lasar.

2013
01:39:15,537 --> 01:39:16,504
We can hit them
however you want to.

2014
01:39:16,572 --> 01:39:18,631
Hey!
This Chettan will die now.

2015
01:39:18,974 --> 01:39:19,941
No need ofthem.

2016
01:39:20,042 --> 01:39:21,669
If something happens between the fight,
we'll be responsible.

2017
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:24,106
My dear brothers,
please go.

2018
01:39:24,213 --> 01:39:25,180
Get going!

2019
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,748
A
a

2020
01:39:27,015 --> 01:39:28,278
Hey! Come here.
Stand here.

2021
01:39:29,151 --> 01:39:30,118
Raghu bro.

2022
01:39:31,153 --> 01:39:32,951
Since it's RD's case,
no one took it up.

2023
01:39:33,388 --> 01:39:35,550
Our other goons have gone
for other main jobs.

2024
01:39:37,159 --> 01:39:39,457
Actually, these guys are awesome.
Not like howthey look.

2025
01:39:40,796 --> 01:39:43,288
We don't have time to think.
We should do something.

2026
01:39:44,266 --> 01:39:45,995
Whatever!
Come. Let's go.

2027
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:47,168
The car is overthere.

2028
01:39:47,269 --> 01:39:48,236
Over there?

2029
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:50,329
A
a

2030
01:39:50,405 --> 01:39:51,372
Come here.

2031
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,507
Walk!

2032
01:39:54,009 --> 01:39:54,976
Walk strongly.

2033
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,771
- Don't bring disgrace to me.
- Shouldn't we take the bag?

2034
01:39:57,045 --> 01:39:58,342
Ya.
Go and bring it.

2035
01:39:58,413 --> 01:40:00,245
It's in the middle ofthe back seat.

2036
01:40:00,349 --> 01:40:02,044
Douglas, please move.

2037
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:04,983
I went to Kasaragod because I couldn't survive
in Kozhikode. And nowl've reached here.

2038
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,312
Please move.

2039
01:40:07,256 --> 01:40:08,223
Renju!

2040
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:10,984
Yeah.
Where did he go?

2041
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:13,352
Did he go to pee?

2042
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:15,129
Hey Renju!

2043
01:40:15,564 --> 01:40:16,588
Where did he go?

2044
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:19,289
Let me go check at the other side.

2045
01:40:19,401 --> 01:40:20,800
Where has this loser gone?

2046
01:40:21,069 --> 01:40:22,503
At the nick oftime.

2047
01:40:22,604 --> 01:40:25,665
Looks like we've to find the one
who came to find the missing one.

2048
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:26,708
Renju.

2049
01:40:27,175 --> 01:40:28,233
Renju!

2050
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:39,212
E
Efiim

2051
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:40,584
I looked everywhere.
He's not there.

2052
01:40:40,656 --> 01:40:42,283
Looks likethey've
come on a tour.

2053
01:40:42,824 --> 01:40:44,588
Bro, what if RD's people...

2054
01:40:44,693 --> 01:40:46,661
- What? -I was just saying...
- Here's your bag.

2055
01:40:47,396 --> 01:40:48,522
I can't reach his phone too.

2056
01:40:49,765 --> 01:40:51,529
Look at the way
troubles are coming.

2057
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,567
Bro.

2058
01:40:54,102 --> 01:40:55,069
Hey Sree!

2059
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,569
E
E

2060
01:40:57,272 --> 01:40:58,797
What?
Whom are you waiting for?

2061
01:40:58,874 --> 01:41:00,035
Me?

2062
01:41:00,409 --> 01:41:01,706
Bro, thanks bro.

2063
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:02,777
Okay bro. See you.

2064
01:41:06,682 --> 01:41:07,706
Where were you?

2065
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,209
My job is not to search for you.

2066
01:41:13,288 --> 01:41:14,414
Bro, I went to get a bottle.

2067
01:41:15,157 --> 01:41:17,057
Didn't you feel that you'll be energized
if you have a couple of drinks?

2068
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,590
I thought I'll give you a surprise.

2069
01:41:18,694 --> 01:41:19,661
You're messing with me?

2070
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:21,128
You're messing with me?

2071
01:41:21,496 --> 01:41:23,555
Am I here for you to mess with?

2072
01:41:23,899 --> 01:41:25,264
Him <i>&</i> his damn surprise.

2073
01:41:25,634 --> 01:41:27,227
I'm stopping this.

2074
01:41:27,603 --> 01:41:28,570
Enough.

2075
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,837
I'm leaving.

2076
01:41:30,205 --> 01:41:31,400
E
a

2077
01:41:31,506 --> 01:41:32,598
He's just a kid...

2078
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:33,775
How many times?

2079
01:41:34,209 --> 01:41:35,699
How many times should
I tolerate him?

2080
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:37,178
I can't.

2081
01:41:37,846 --> 01:41:39,678
I can't go ahead with
you guys, seriously!

2082
01:41:40,182 --> 01:41:42,082
You can die, kill or
do whatever you want.

2083
01:41:42,284 --> 01:41:43,718
I'm the one who's tensed here.

2084
01:41:44,586 --> 01:41:48,284
If something happens to my mother,
I'll come home and finish you guys.

2085
01:41:49,825 --> 01:41:51,259
Ratheesh, start the
car if you can.

2086
01:41:51,326 --> 01:41:52,691
Or do you also want
to get a bottle?

2087
01:41:53,328 --> 01:41:54,295
Stan the car.

2088
01:41:54,863 --> 01:41:56,388
- Bro! - Raghu bro!
- Get lost!

2089
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:58,800
Are you happy now?

2090
01:42:00,135 --> 01:42:00,897
Loser!

2091
01:42:07,175 --> 01:42:09,439
You should do certain things,
considering the situation.

2092
01:42:10,846 --> 01:42:12,245
Anyway we've reached till here.

2093
01:42:13,215 --> 01:42:14,341
Let's go there and see.

2094
01:42:14,883 --> 01:42:16,248
RD or whomever...

2095
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:19,150
We've easily solved that Beemapalli
casethatwas much bigger, right?

2096
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:21,515
Bro, to be frank, it's a
trouble he asked for.

2097
01:42:22,524 --> 01:42:26,290
This could have been solved if he had told
that guy's dad that we haven't done this.

2098
01:42:27,562 --> 01:42:30,224
I think he got scared and escaped.

2099
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,225
What's the point in
talking about it?

2100
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:33,862
Dominic, start the car.

2101
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:35,670
Com e.

2102
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:41,170
Dominic, what are we going
to do after we get there?

2103
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:44,577
I think it's a case that we
can talk and compromise.

2104
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:45,947
Compromise?

2105
01:42:46,214 --> 01:42:47,181
Ya rig m!

2106
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:49,441
This is the best chance
that RD has ever had.

2107
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:50,609
Will he miss it?

2108
01:42:50,786 --> 01:42:52,254
Don't scare me, man.

2109
01:42:52,387 --> 01:42:54,321
I didn't say it to make you tensed.

2110
01:42:55,323 --> 01:42:56,290
But notjust Baba...

2111
01:42:56,558 --> 01:42:57,889
He won't listen to anyone.

2112
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,785
He will do anything
to get back at Samad.

2113
01:43:01,396 --> 01:43:02,886
Say it clearly, man.

2114
01:43:03,465 --> 01:43:04,955
I'll make it clear, Bhai.

2115
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:07,864
RD got Sahiba on the
same day you guys left.

2116
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:21,279
- What about that boy?
- I'll tell you.

2117
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:22,884
RD smoothly kept him away.

2118
01:43:24,853 --> 01:43:26,184
Give her something to eat.

2119
01:43:26,788 --> 01:43:27,846
Don't ask her anything now.

2120
01:43:28,023 --> 01:43:28,990
Baba...

2121
01:43:29,624 --> 01:43:30,750
what should I do with him?

2122
01:43:31,793 --> 01:43:32,954
No one should see him again.

2123
01:43:33,662 --> 01:43:34,629
Finish him.

2124
01:43:37,432 --> 01:43:38,922
What's that fishy look on his face?

2125
01:43:39,434 --> 01:43:40,424
He's a pucca fraud, right?

2126
01:43:40,502 --> 01:43:41,833
- That's it.
- Bye, Baba.

2127
01:43:41,903 --> 01:43:43,837
He did everything and put
the blame on you guys.

2128
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:48,669
RD has been looking for a chance
to lock Samad for a long time.

2129
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:50,879
That's when you jumped
into the picture.

2130
01:43:51,379 --> 01:43:52,676
I doubt if he's slightly mental.

2131
01:43:53,515 --> 01:43:55,847
He has taken a contract
to demolish a godown.

2132
01:43:56,251 --> 01:43:58,219
Even though it's all scrap,
it's a huge business.

2133
01:43:58,487 --> 01:43:59,682
We've reached the spot.

2134
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:02,547
If something happens here,
no one outside will know, bro.

2135
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:04,954
{my mfiflmag]

2136
01:44:05,927 --> 01:44:07,622
All of you be prepared.

A

2138
01:44:09,264 --> 01:44:10,231
did you hear that?

2139
01:44:13,068 --> 01:44:14,433
Let's face the rest as it comes.

2140
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,237
Com e.

2141
01:44:17,339 --> 01:44:18,306
Hey! Come.

2142
01:44:18,874 --> 01:44:19,932
I think everyone is here.

2143
01:44:20,275 --> 01:44:21,333
Just be careful.

2144
01:44:22,344 --> 01:44:23,368
Don't scare me, man.

2145
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:26,839
Amw bro.

01:44:27,282 --> 01:44:28,579

Shallwe go in?

2149
01:44:33,555 --> 01:44:34,522
Com e.

2150
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:51,606
RD.

2151
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:04,018
RD...

2152
01:45:04,553 --> 01:45:06,351
Senan bro wants to say
something to you.

2153
01:45:09,858 --> 01:45:10,825
RD bro...

2154
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,351
it would be great if we
could get that Salmaan.

2155
01:45:17,799 --> 01:45:19,893
Ramdev bro, send that boy with us.

2156
01:45:20,435 --> 01:45:22,096
I mean, it would be great
if you could send him.

2157
01:45:22,737 --> 01:45:23,704
I can't.

2158
01:45:24,773 --> 01:45:26,741
Bro, the matter is slightly serious.

2159
01:45:27,108 --> 01:45:28,075
That's why.
Please.

2160
01:45:28,677 --> 01:45:29,974
I can't.

2161
01:45:30,145 --> 01:45:31,738
Didn't that girl's father tell you...

2162
01:45:31,947 --> 01:45:33,346
not to do anything to him?

2163
01:45:33,682 --> 01:45:35,013
Then what's your problem?

2164
01:45:37,886 --> 01:45:39,547
Think about it, bro.

2165
01:45:41,122 --> 01:45:42,612
Bhai, don't be adamant.

2166
01:45:43,658 --> 01:45:45,456
Baba has sent us here.

2167
01:45:49,064 --> 01:45:50,395
Not just Baba,

2168
01:45:50,765 --> 01:45:53,757
if'
m

2169
01:45:54,135 --> 01:45:55,364
I killed him.

2170
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:58,997
That rascal escaped from
my clutches, twice.

2171
01:45:59,074 --> 01:46:01,065
So, I finished him and
soon as I got him.

2172
01:46:07,549 --> 01:46:08,948
You can take the
body if you want to.

2173
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:13,888
Or else...

2174
01:46:19,394 --> 01:46:20,555
I'll wash my hand and come.

2175
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:21,596
Move.

2176
01:46:36,645 --> 01:46:37,612
WEB,
@[h1flflfln

2177
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:38,737
We'll find a solution.

2178
01:46:39,047 --> 01:46:40,048
What chill?

2179
01:46:40,048 --> 01:46:40,981
He's dead.

2180
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:42,881
He is dead.
Period.

2181
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:46,881
Dad.. Sree..
Dude!

2182
01:46:46,955 --> 01:46:47,922
Dad calling.

2183
01:46:48,423 --> 01:46:49,390
- Pick up.
- Talk to him.

2184
01:46:49,457 --> 01:46:51,482
Em
a

2185
01:46:53,561 --> 01:46:54,528
Hello.

2186
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:57,721
My son will reach here tomorrow
morning itself, right?

2187
01:46:57,933 --> 01:47:00,061
He's asking whether his son
will reach in the morning.

2188
01:47:00,235 --> 01:47:01,202
He will reach.

2189
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,137
He will reach.

2190
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,932
Your friend has something to say to you.

2191
01:47:09,044 --> 01:47:10,478
- Pinku.
- Pinku?

2192
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,447
What's happening?

2193
01:47:14,049 --> 01:47:15,107
Dude, he is dead.

2194
01:47:16,785 --> 01:47:17,752
He was killed.

2195
01:47:24,826 --> 01:47:25,793
You calm down.

2196
01:47:25,894 --> 01:47:26,861
We'll find some solution.

2197
01:47:31,733 --> 01:47:32,962
Nothing else, right?

2198
01:47:33,468 --> 01:47:34,560
There's one more thing.

2199
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:37,431
Raghu Annan got upset and left.

2200
01:47:37,973 --> 01:47:39,941
Now, it's only the three of us.

2201
01:47:44,846 --> 01:47:47,508
So, everything is going great, huh?

2202
01:47:50,785 --> 01:47:52,184
Nowthere's nothing to worry.

2203
01:47:56,157 --> 01:47:57,124
Okay then.

2204
01:47:58,927 --> 01:47:59,894
Dude...

2205
01:48:00,695 --> 01:48:01,662
He hung up.

2206
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,695
They will reach tomorrow itself.

2207
01:48:07,135 --> 01:48:08,102
Everything is okay.

2208
01:48:20,181 --> 01:48:21,148
Aren't you leaving?

2209
01:48:26,688 --> 01:48:28,554
He has been cut, left,
rig ht and center.

2210
01:48:28,656 --> 01:48:30,181
There's no finishing at all.

2211
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:33,059
Ails
E

2212
01:48:33,628 --> 01:48:34,595
He is not dead.

2213
01:48:34,996 --> 01:48:35,963
He is moving.

2214
01:48:36,831 --> 01:48:37,798
He's not dead?

2215
01:48:38,299 --> 01:48:39,300
He's not dead?

2216
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:40,267
He's not dead?

2217
01:48:40,335 --> 01:48:41,803
- He's not dead?
- He's not dead.

2218
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:42,837
He's not dead?

2219
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,007
Hey!

2220
01:48:47,142 --> 01:48:48,632
Slice him to death.

2221
01:48:50,111 --> 01:48:51,101
Bro!

2222
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:52,146
Stay strong.

2223
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,671
Oh no! My eyes are gone.
Oh! The power has gone.

2224
01:49:17,138 --> 01:49:18,105
Raghu Annan.

2225
01:49:45,033 --> 01:49:46,000
Hey!

2226
01:49:47,102 --> 01:49:48,570
Finish that rascal.

2227
01:49:50,705 --> 01:49:53,106
Raghuetta, I doubt if I'm
beginning to get a little scared.

2228
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,319
That's awesome.

2229
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:09,887
Sree, you were pulling my leg, right?

2230
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:10,925
Now look!
Learn from him.

2231
01:50:12,961 --> 01:50:14,690
He is too good.

2232
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:24,218
Hey!

2233
01:53:27,121 --> 01:53:28,088
Wasn't that a gunshot?

2234
01:53:28,222 --> 01:53:29,189
Let me escape!

2235
01:53:35,897 --> 01:53:37,524
Hey Raghu Bhai!

2236
01:53:38,199 --> 01:53:39,496
Trying to be a hero?

2237
01:53:50,645 --> 01:53:51,612
Oops.
Sc**wed.

2238
01:53:52,046 --> 01:53:53,912
Smmmfim

2239
01:53:54,349 --> 01:53:55,544
Com e.
We forgot a car there.

2240
01:53:55,616 --> 01:53:56,583
Take right.

2241
01:53:57,485 --> 01:53:59,453
Go to the rig ht.

2242
01:54:15,203 --> 01:54:17,001
Dominic, what all is happening here?

2243
01:54:17,071 --> 01:54:18,937
- Who's the dead guy?
- I don't know.

2244
01:54:19,006 --> 01:54:20,405
I think this is all
Prajith's planning.

2245
01:54:20,475 --> 01:54:21,874
Can't he open his mouth
and say that then?

2246
01:54:21,943 --> 01:54:23,035
Got beaten up in vain...

2247
01:54:26,013 --> 01:54:27,412
We knewthat you
would come, bro.

2248
01:54:28,182 --> 01:54:29,274
Not for you...

2249
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:30,511
But for your families...

2250
01:54:30,885 --> 01:54:32,478
There's the car.
That's the boy.

2251
01:54:32,653 --> 01:54:34,314
Go fast.

2252
01:54:34,555 --> 01:54:35,522
Go straight.

2253
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,285
Go faster.

2254
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:39,290
Come on, increase the speed.

2255
01:54:39,427 --> 01:54:40,588
Don't let him get away.

2256
01:54:41,529 --> 01:54:42,496
Overtake him.

2257
01:54:44,198 --> 01:54:46,064
- Renju, drift.
- Who?

2258
01:54:46,267 --> 01:54:47,530
- Where? What?
- Drift!

2259
01:54:47,969 --> 01:54:48,936
Go! Go!

2260
01:54:49,103 --> 01:54:50,366
Come on, go.

2261
01:54:50,638 --> 01:54:52,003
Dude, a lorry is coming.

2262
01:54:53,107 --> 01:54:54,074
Don't scare me.

2263
01:54:56,244 --> 01:54:57,507
Now go slow.

2264
01:54:58,146 --> 01:54:59,875
Do n't lose control.
Slowly.

2265
01:55:00,381 --> 01:55:02,645
Sun
Em

2266
01:55:04,919 --> 01:55:06,512
I think we have left Kochi.

2267
01:55:07,288 --> 01:55:09,222
Go fon/vard.

2268
01:55:09,690 --> 01:55:11,215
He's going like a snake, bro.

2269
01:55:12,393 --> 01:55:13,952
- Ovenake.
- Where?

2270
01:55:15,563 --> 01:55:17,224
Let's catch him at this curve.

2271
01:55:17,498 --> 01:55:18,465
That way.

2272
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:23,237
Overtake.

2273
01:55:23,371 --> 01:55:24,338
Trapped!

2274
01:55:24,439 --> 01:55:25,634
Oh no!

2275
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:27,032
Stop! Stop!

2276
01:55:27,241 --> 01:55:29,232
- Catch him!
- Renju, get down.

2277
01:55:30,311 --> 01:55:31,972
Get out.

2278
01:55:32,113 --> 01:55:33,342
Don't hit me.

2279
01:55:33,414 --> 01:55:34,575
Samad's son!

2280
01:55:34,649 --> 01:55:36,583
Mmflmg]

2281
01:55:36,651 --> 01:55:38,085
- Are you Samad's on?
- Hey! Leave him.

2282
01:55:38,152 --> 01:55:39,119
Leave him.

2283
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:40,312
- Bro, he's the one..
- Leave him.

2284
01:55:40,421 --> 01:55:42,287
What have I done?
Tell me.

2285
01:55:42,423 --> 01:55:44,289
Amyfimflmu

2286
01:55:44,459 --> 01:55:45,426
Get in.

2287
01:55:45,526 --> 01:55:46,618
No, bro.
I'll get in myself

2288
01:55:47,762 --> 01:55:48,729
Get in.

2289
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:51,656
Dude, hold him carefully.

2290
01:55:53,134 --> 01:55:54,101
Over here.

2291
01:55:55,102 --> 01:55:56,069
Stop!

2292
01:55:57,972 --> 01:55:58,939
Lasar, get down.

2293
01:55:59,307 --> 01:56:00,672
- Can you give me that glass?
- Can you drive now, bro?

2294
01:56:01,042 --> 01:56:02,009
Move.

2295
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:05,340
Dominic, there's an old
settlement of ours.

2296
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,744
- There's 500 left to be paid.
- Let it be there.

2297
01:56:08,249 --> 01:56:10,684
Dude, tell Baba that this boy is with me.

01:56:10,785 --> 01:56:12,446
Done.
Don't waste time. Go!

2299
01:56:13,154 --> 01:56:14,747
- What's the matter?
- The duration was less, right?

2300
01:56:14,989 --> 01:56:16,457
Just give us a 1000 bucks. Right?

2301
01:56:16,557 --> 01:56:18,082
We also worked, rig ht?

2302
01:56:18,226 --> 01:56:19,591
Understood.
Give me the money.

2303

Bro, this is all we have left.

2304
01:56:21,596 --> 01:56:22,586
Leave it.

2305
01:56:22,663 --> 01:56:23,630
Hey! Give this.

2306
01:56:23,698 --> 01:56:25,097
Settle this however you want to.

2307
01:56:25,166 --> 01:56:26,429
I'll send the car somehow.

2308
01:56:27,268 --> 01:56:28,235
Okay then, bro.

Why did you have to talk about
cash in between all that?

2316
01:56:39,347 --> 01:56:41,213
To humiliate me.
Come on!

2317
01:56:47,588 --> 01:56:49,317
Pmuhm?

2318
01:56:49,457 --> 01:56:50,424
Who's your bro?
Your dad?

Who does your dad think he is?
He doesn't know me properly.

I can't understand
what you're saying.

2321

What you did?

2327
01:57:04,539 --> 01:57:08,100
Your dad and gang has held my mom and
people hostage saying that I kidnapped you.

2328
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:10,208
He said he'll mess with me
when I come to Trivandrum.

2329
01:57:10,311 --> 01:57:13,110
Let's reach Trivandrum. I'll show you.
I'll finish all ofyou!

2330
01:57:13,314 --> 01:57:15,112
Dad is in Trivandrum? What's the issue?

Will you hit him <i>&</i> send
him to the hospital?

2335
01:57:21,689 --> 01:57:24,021
I'll call my dad and say
that you didn't kidnap me.

2336
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:29,296
Will he say it?

2337
01:57:29,797 --> 01:57:31,595
He can call and say that
it's not us, right?

Here you go.

This is my phone.
Where did you get this from?

2342
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:42,138
Your dad gifted for a wedding.

2343
01:57:42,276 --> 01:57:43,402
Call him, you bloody...

2344
01:57:44,312 --> 01:57:46,371
I will call.
But there's a condition.

2345
01:57:46,747 --> 01:57:47,714
What is it?

2346
01:57:54,422 --> 01:57:55,389
Where are you?

2347
01:57:55,523 --> 01:57:57,048
Come out.
I'm outside.

2348
01:57:57,158 --> 01:57:59,320
I'm not liking this one bit.

2349
01:57:59,527 --> 01:58:00,653

- Bro, in the present situation..
- What situation?

2353
01:58:07,468 --> 01:58:08,560
He won't reach home if
it goes on like this.

2354
01:58:08,703 --> 01:58:10,262
That loserwill die by my hand.

2355
01:58:10,805 --> 01:58:13,069
- Keep quiet. He's really angry.
- Who is this?

2356
01:58:13,407 --> 01:58:14,374
Don't say anything.

2357

- Who is it?
- Raghu Anna...

He is Samad's son.

Mangalore Samad's son.

2364
01:58:29,724 --> 01:58:31,749
He is a crazy don.

Oh! Good boy!

2366
01:58:33,861 --> 01:58:34,828
Who is it, bro?

2367
01:58:34,895 --> 01:58:36,260

I'll tell you the rest on the way.
Come.

Don't shout.

2384
01:59:11,666 --> 01:59:12,792
There's a girl in the car.

Hello.

2386
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:21,508

You don't worry, daddy.

Are you hun?

2391
01:59:27,214 --> 01:59:29,182
Why did you challenge
this Raghu bro, daddy?

He is a good man.

2393
01:59:30,451 --> 01:59:31,612
He was the one who saved me.

2394
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:34,381
If he wasn't there, it would
have been a disaster.

2395
01:59:34,855 --> 01:59:37,381
Then, who kidnapped you?

2396
01:59:37,858 --> 01:59:39,485
I'll come and tell you directly.

Must be, right?

2404
02:00:11,759 --> 02:00:12,726
I am sorry.

2405
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:16,221
I had a small misunderstanding.

2406
02:00:21,869 --> 02:00:23,928
That's what.
I also felt so earlier.

2407
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:26,502
That there's a small misunderstanding.

2408
02:00:26,674 --> 02:00:28,642
Othen/vise, for such a small matter...

2409

Yeah.

No, dear.

Once my son comes tomorrow,
we'll go together.

2416
02:00:45,993 --> 02:00:46,960
Okay mother.

2417
02:00:47,661 --> 02:00:48,628
So be it.

Okay.

2419
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:05,004
- Is it morning yet?
- Acar came opposite to us.

2420
02:01:07,515 --> 02:01:09,313
Whatever it is, it's all good.

2421
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:11,612
Even if we had to struggle a bit,
we got everything done.

2422
02:01:11,786 --> 02:01:12,753
That's what!

2423
02:01:15,022 --> 02:01:17,491
When the issue became huge,
I got slightly scared.

2424
02:01:17,658 --> 02:01:18,625
When I am there?

2425
02:01:18,993 --> 02:01:20,961
It's not that, bro.
What if you couldn't handle it?

2426
02:01:21,662 --> 02:01:22,823
What's all this, man?

2427
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,465
Long back, I had gone
like this fortwo guys.

2428
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:27,461
That's a different story.

2429
02:01:28,435 --> 02:01:30,699
I had to run for my life back then...

2430
02:01:31,305 --> 02:01:33,433
But after everything was done,
I was of no use to them.

2431
02:01:34,074 --> 02:01:35,838
Truthful things are always like that, bro.

2432
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:38,078
Even if we have to struggle
a bit, it will happen.

2433
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:40,345
And these are all truths of the world.

2434

Bro, were you sleeping
and driving so far then?

2440
02:01:52,827 --> 02:01:54,056
Shut up and go to sleep.

2441
02:01:54,962 --> 02:01:56,896
Bro, is the route correct?

2442
02:01:57,064 --> 02:01:58,532
I'll check in Google if you want.

2443
02:01:59,066 --> 02:02:01,330
That won't be right.
There will be other problems.

2444
02:02:02,136 --> 02:02:03,729
What problem does he
have with Google?

2445
02:02:05,072 --> 02:02:06,938
Where is Ratheesh?

2446
02:02:30,364 --> 02:02:31,388
Bring him.

2447
02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:33,030
Get down.

It's been so many
days since I sawyou.

A <i>[hmppna

2455
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,579
Since I'm in the hospital anyway,
I thought I'll get my leg's ache checked.

2456
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,715
This boy came with me.

2457
02:02:58,893 --> 02:02:59,860
Who are you?

2458
02:03:00,194 --> 02:03:02,629

You're quite something, kiddo.

Go there.
You'll get it nicely!

- Who is it?
- Mom.

2463
02:03:14,675 --> 02:03:18,134
I didn't feel like sitting, standing
or sleeping without seeing my son.

2464
02:03:18,445 --> 02:03:19,606
Don't flatter me too much.

2465
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:21,670
You gave this gold covering
bracelet saying it's gold?

2466
02:03:21,815 --> 02:03:23,749
It's Attukal Goddess' blessing
that the police didn't beat me up.

2467

Oh! ls that so?

2468
02:03:25,653 --> 02:03:28,623
My dear, gold is a truthful metal.

2469
02:03:28,722 --> 02:03:30,087
Blood shouldn't fall on it.

2470
02:03:30,157 --> 02:03:32,125
That's why I bought
gold covering for you.

2471
02:03:32,192 --> 02:03:33,159
Check that chain.

2472
02:03:33,527 --> 02:03:34,585
It's exactly 10 sovereigns.

2473
02:03:34,662 --> 02:03:35,629
_ Mom!
_ Ten?

2474
02:03:39,667 --> 02:03:40,634
Really?

2475
02:03:42,202 --> 02:03:44,694
How could you think of selling the
jewellery mom bought for you?

2476
02:03:44,772 --> 02:03:46,831
- It's not like that, mom.
- I don't want to hear anything.

2477
02:03:48,042 --> 02:03:49,407
Bro, when did you come?

2478
02:03:49,643 --> 02:03:50,872
What are you doing with a flask?

2479
02:03:50,945 --> 02:03:52,538
You know Samad Bhai?

2480
02:03:52,646 --> 02:03:53,511
I bought it for him.

2481
02:03:53,647 --> 02:03:54,808
Sam ad Bhai?

2482
02:03:54,982 --> 02:03:56,609
What's that mark on your face?

2483
02:03:56,984 --> 02:03:58,713
It's nothing, bro.

2484
02:03:59,586 --> 02:04:01,554
Etfilfi
a mfihflmg

2485
02:04:01,722 --> 02:04:02,689
Have some tea, bro.

2486
02:04:02,923 --> 02:04:03,890
Hey Peter.

2487
02:04:04,258 --> 02:04:05,225
Who hit you?

2488
02:04:05,459 --> 02:04:06,893
Leave it, bro. It's no one.
It's fine.

2489
02:04:07,061 --> 02:04:08,495
Who touched your body, man?

2490
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:10,825
Flfimflxmfs

2491
02:04:16,904 --> 02:04:18,531
Bro.. Samad.

2492
02:04:18,706 --> 02:04:19,673
Daddy.

2493
02:04:22,609 --> 02:04:23,838
Who among them hit you?

2494
02:04:24,645 --> 02:04:25,806
The one with the black coat.

2495
02:04:43,597 --> 02:04:45,565
Touching my boys after
coming to Trivand rum?

2496
02:04:47,134 --> 02:04:48,101
Com e.

2497
02:04:50,971 --> 02:04:52,132
I heard everything.

2498
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:56,635
Raghu, it's a misunderstand on my pan.
Just because ofthat...

2499
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,877
Just because ofthat...

2500
02:04:58,278 --> 02:05:00,269
You and your misunderstanding!

2501
02:05:00,881 --> 02:05:02,076
Good foryou!

2502
02:05:02,282 --> 02:05:04,842
Othen/vise I'd have ripped you
apart for keeping my mom hostage.

2503
02:05:05,019 --> 02:05:05,986
Got it?

2504
02:05:07,221 --> 02:05:10,521
By the time I come back,
leave with all these losers of yours.

2505
02:05:10,924 --> 02:05:12,187
Don't try to mess with our boys.

2506
02:05:14,561 --> 02:05:15,892
This is Thiruvananthapuram.

2507
02:05:15,996 --> 02:05:17,191
The land of Lord Padmanabha.

2508
02:05:17,664 --> 02:05:19,063
The boys here will knock you out!

2509
02:05:21,769 --> 02:05:22,736
Raghu...

2511
02:05:26,907 --> 02:05:27,874
it's all the same for me.

2512
02:05:30,177 --> 02:05:31,736
Get lost, man!

2513
02:05:32,546 --> 02:05:33,536
Com e.

2514
02:05:33,614 --> 02:05:35,241
Why don't you ever understand?
Why do you have to hang out with them?

2515
02:05:35,649 --> 02:05:36,810
- Oh no! Where's the ring?
- Raghu Anna, Sahiba is there...

2516
02:05:36,917 --> 02:05:39,079
- Where's the ring on yourfinger?
- Ring.. Forthe toll...

2517
02:05:39,153 --> 02:05:40,120
We didn't have change...

2518
02:05:40,187 --> 02:05:42,588
Will Raghu Annan stay calm?
He interfered and...

2519
02:05:42,656 --> 02:05:44,215
Wearyour buttons.

2520
02:05:44,358 --> 02:05:45,848
I'll be right back.

2521
02:05:45,926 --> 02:05:47,826
Come back home.
I'll son you out.

2522
02:06:08,082 --> 02:06:09,345
Bro, I'll hold him.

2523
02:06:34,308 --> 02:06:35,275
Here.

2524
02:06:35,876 --> 02:06:37,241
I have kept my promise.

2525
02:06:37,411 --> 02:06:39,880
Make him apologize, prostrate
or do whatever you want to.

2526
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,913
Come on.
Do it.

2527
02:06:41,181 --> 02:06:42,148
D0 it.

2528
02:06:45,953 --> 02:06:47,682
- Who is this?
- Huh?

2529
02:06:50,691 --> 02:06:51,658
Who is this?

2530
02:06:54,094 --> 02:06:55,994
This is the guy, who hit you!

2531
02:06:58,699 --> 02:07:00,064
It's not him.

2532
02:07:01,768 --> 02:07:03,395
Dude, did you lose your relay
when you got hit on your head?

2533
02:07:03,837 --> 02:07:04,702
Bro, Pinku...

2534
02:07:04,838 --> 02:07:05,862
Did you recognize me?

2535
02:07:06,039 --> 02:07:07,006
I am Renju.

2536
02:07:07,407 --> 02:07:08,374
Your everything, Renju.

2537
02:07:09,209 --> 02:07:10,176
What is he saying?

2538
02:07:10,277 --> 02:07:11,267
What's he saying, Raghu Anna?

2539
02:07:11,345 --> 02:07:12,312
Are you not well?

2540
02:07:12,379 --> 02:07:15,007
Didn't you say that the boy in
the photo on the phone hit you?

2541
02:07:15,082 --> 02:07:17,210
Yes. The boy in the photo on the
phone was the one who hit me.

2542
02:07:17,684 --> 02:07:18,708
A
Em

2543
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:20,086
Take it out.

2544
02:07:20,888 --> 02:07:21,855
Same.

2545
02:07:22,322 --> 02:07:23,619
Who is this, then?

2546
02:07:24,458 --> 02:07:25,425
No! No!

2547
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:27,923
This is the one.
He's the one who hit me?

2548
02:07:27,995 --> 02:07:30,123
That's my younger brother.
Sultan.

2549
02:07:30,264 --> 02:07:32,926
Didn't I tell you a hundred times
that I haven't done anything?

2550
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:34,667
This little boy?

2551
02:07:35,402 --> 02:07:36,369
Yes.

2552
02:07:38,338 --> 02:07:40,033
Dude, say that it's you.

2553
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,407
Get lost!

2554
02:07:44,178 --> 02:07:45,942
Dude, you must have forgotten.

2555
02:07:46,013 --> 02:07:46,980
Think about it.

2556
02:07:56,823 --> 02:07:59,884
Until everything is
solved, you deal with it.

2557
02:07:59,993 --> 02:08:01,825
Bro, one packet of Gold.

2558
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:03,693
You do one thing.
Go to Kasaragod with him.

2559
02:08:04,331 --> 02:08:06,322
I'll say everything to
daddy and convince him.

2560
02:08:06,466 --> 02:08:09,367
I'll take her to Bangalore and
stay at my uncle's place.

2561
02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:12,105
Him and his shop!

2562
02:08:17,277 --> 02:08:18,244
Great!

2563
02:08:26,019 --> 02:08:27,248
Who gave you a license?

2564
02:08:28,288 --> 02:08:29,255
Are you blind orwhat?

2565
02:08:29,389 --> 02:08:30,413
Where are you coming from?

2566
02:08:30,724 --> 02:08:33,056
Do you know how hard it was to
play till the last level? - Stop!

2567
02:08:33,126 --> 02:08:34,821
- Stop! Cursing me in English?
- You made me lose.

2568
02:08:35,362 --> 02:08:36,989
Playing with mobile at this age?

2569
02:08:37,064 --> 02:08:38,691
Move, you bloody fatso.

2570
02:08:38,765 --> 02:08:40,028
Will you curse your elders?

2571
02:08:40,133 --> 02:08:41,191
Don't kick!

2572
02:08:48,242 --> 02:08:49,209
Here.

2573
02:08:51,345 --> 02:08:52,312
What's wrong?

2574
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:58,218
Oh my God!

2575
02:09:04,224 --> 02:09:07,194
That's why I asked why we should involve
Raghu Annan in this small matter.

2576
02:09:14,401 --> 02:09:15,527
Nonsense.
It's stuck.

2577
02:09:16,937 --> 02:09:17,904
It's not getting cut.

2578
02:09:20,841 --> 02:09:21,808
Well...

2579
02:09:22,009 --> 02:09:25,001
You didn't face any difficulty
after going there, right?

2580
02:09:42,496 --> 02:09:44,225
Take me to the hospital.

2581
02:09:44,298 --> 02:09:47,427
I've been starving, puking, and growing
dark, ever since I joined you guys.

2582
02:09:47,534 --> 02:09:48,501
Raghu Anna, come.

2583
02:09:49,069 --> 02:09:50,230
Driver bro, stop!

2584
02:09:50,304 --> 02:09:51,430
They have held my
mother hostage.

2585
02:09:51,505 --> 02:09:52,472
And you're fooling around?

2586
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,471
Oh my Aattukaal Goddess!

2587
02:10:03,016 --> 02:10:07,817
Did you go to Kasaragod with this overgrown
fellow to beat up that little boy?

2588
02:10:11,024 --> 02:10:13,118
Aren't you ashamed to
go around like this?

2589
02:10:13,226 --> 02:10:15,217
You're an idiot.
Afirst class idiot.

2590
02:10:15,595 --> 02:10:18,189
He's going around with a beard,
not even getting married.

2591
02:10:18,298 --> 02:10:19,265
To beat up little kids.

2592
02:10:20,167 --> 02:10:21,794
You come home.
I'll son you out there.

2593
02:10:22,502 --> 02:10:24,129
Raghu, it seems.

2594
02:10:24,504 --> 02:10:26,029
- Mom!
- Whose mom?

2595
02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:27,206
What are you looking at?

2596
02:10:27,307 --> 02:10:28,274
Com e, Peter.

2597
02:10:34,481 --> 02:10:36,040
Shall I hide underthe bed?

2598
02:10:37,117 --> 02:10:38,084
Bro...

2599
02:10:44,458 --> 02:10:45,619
First, I came here.

2600
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:48,493
Then Raghu Annan came.

2601
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:51,930
Then someone called Samad came.

2602
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,364
Why should we interfere in these
small things unnecessarily?

2603
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:57,027
Instead of saying small thing,

2604
02:10:57,137 --> 02:10:58,434
you should open
your mouth and say,

2605
02:10:58,538 --> 02:11:00,267
- only then we'll know.
- You shut up!

2606
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,009
What all was your build up?

2607
02:11:04,144 --> 02:11:06,943
Car went over mom's leg, sister
was raped, and what not...

2608
02:11:07,414 --> 02:11:08,939
For that, can he hit us like this?

2609
02:11:10,417 --> 02:11:12,215
Bro, didn't I tell you
that he's a psycho?

2610
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:13,286
Yeah! Suffer now.

2611
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:17,049
Shall we arrange others
to beat up Raghu?

2612
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:18,257
Great!

2613
02:11:18,325 --> 02:11:19,986
A
Efiyy

2614
02:11:20,093 --> 02:11:23,222
I can't get beaten up everyday
and come lie on this bed.

2615
02:11:23,363 --> 02:11:24,956
- Plan something else.
- Senanna...

2616
02:11:25,098 --> 02:11:27,499
Let's go to Raghu Annan's house,
fall at his feet and say sorry.

2617
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:29,035
We can avoid any further violence.

2618
02:11:29,102 --> 02:11:30,228
Well, I was just saying...

2619
02:11:30,303 --> 02:11:32,032
That won't be rig ht...

2620
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:33,570
There's another problem forthat.

2621
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,109
You've been saying there's
another problem for everything!

2622
02:11:36,209 --> 02:11:38,177
EpwfiikÃ©m?
Em

2623
02:11:39,079 --> 02:11:40,877
There's another problem forthat.

2624
02:11:45,385 --> 02:11:46,352
Raghu Anna...

2625
02:11:48,121 --> 02:11:49,088
- What is it?
- Anna...

2626
02:11:49,656 --> 02:11:50,953
Say that you forgave us.

2627
02:11:51,091 --> 02:11:52,923
Get up and go.
Haven't you had enough?

2628
02:11:54,094 --> 02:11:55,619
Anna, he didn't tell
us anything in detail.

2629
02:11:55,695 --> 02:11:57,663
Unless you forgive
us, we won't go.

2630
02:11:57,931 --> 02:11:59,330
My dear bro, I've forgiven you.

2631
02:11:59,433 --> 02:12:01,333
It's been 2 days since I slept.
Let me sleep.

2632
02:12:01,568 --> 02:12:02,535
Who is it, dear?

2633
02:12:02,602 --> 02:12:03,933
Aunty, it's me.
Senan.

2634
02:12:04,271 --> 02:12:05,238
Chenan!

2635
02:12:05,338 --> 02:12:06,533
Which Chenan?

2636
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:08,207
Hey Raghu...

2637
02:12:08,542 --> 02:12:12,308
if you're planning to create some
other problem with these guys again,

2638
02:12:12,612 --> 02:12:14,376
Go, mom.
Go to bed.

2639
02:12:15,048 --> 02:12:16,709
If you create anymore problems,

02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,918

2641
02:12:19,419 --> 02:12:20,386
Hey! Hey!

2642
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,681
Go to your houses, guys.

2643
02:12:21,988 --> 02:12:22,955
Good night.

2644
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:24,357
Who is it?

2645
02:12:32,499 --> 02:12:33,591
