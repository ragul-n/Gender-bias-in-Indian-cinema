End the connection.

705
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,378
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

706
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:20,758
Viral and bacterial screening activated.

707
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,430
Releasing proteins, fats,

708
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:29,392
minerals and carbs.

709
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:36,607
Energy inflow is at 1320 kilocalories.

710
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:42,363
Now starting anti-inflammatory corticoids, hormones

711
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,449
and antibiotic protocols.

712
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,077
Standard daily intake.

713
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,623
Release antidepressants.

714
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,127
Let's give him a nice dream.

715
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,991
MATTOX: All right, here's what you're dealin' with.

716
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,559
Modified M2 battle rifle.

717
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:14,103
.50 caliber Beowulf ammunition at 30 round clips.

718
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,022
Three-shot bursts or full auto.

719
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,399
Heavy-duty.

720
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,862
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven taser pistol.

721
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,879
Each projectile releases up to 200,000 volts.

722
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,391
It can stun, it can kill

723
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,909
and it's nasty shit.

724
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,327
Your armor,

725
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,746
state-of-the-art, but not invulnerable.

726
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,457
.50 caliber or larger can penetrate and kill.

727
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:38,335
Multiple hits, and guess who ends up in the recycling bin?

728
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,551
If you sense you need a weapon or are threatened

729
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,678
the visor goes down and the system makes the weapons available.

730
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,723
But you gotta remember, it's not the weapons that count.

731
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:51,849
It's who's handling them.

732
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,143
Or, in your case, what.

733
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,743
You think you can do this?

734
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,088
Oh, just stick to your job.

735
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,312
Just stick to my job?

736
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,049
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

737
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,482
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.

738
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:04,303
Our machines run perfectly.

739
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,489
You ask me, stickin' organics into the system

740
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,657
is a huge step backwards.

741
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,035
I don't care how well you designed this thing.

742
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,496
Without my sign-off, it better start learnin' Chinese,

743
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,039
'cause it ain't never goin' home.

744
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,465
It's nice to meet you, too.

745
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,468
Let's do this,

746
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,095
Tin Man.

747
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:39,438
Quality control, EM-208 versus Tin Man.

748
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,525
Rendering scenario one now.

749
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,985
Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

750
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,195
I like a little music while I'm workin'.

751
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,530
<i>(IF I ONLY HAD A HEART PLAYING)</i>

752
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,241
<i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>

753
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:53,932
All right.
All right, let's let the games begin.

754
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,396
Let's rock 'n' roll.

755
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,541
Commence scenario.

756
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,710
<i>Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind of human</i>

757
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,089
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

758
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:11,137
<i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle And awful sentimental</i>

759
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,764
<i>Regarding love and art</i>

760
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,601
<i>I'd be friends with the sparrows</i>

761
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:19,770
<i>And the boy who shoots the arrows</i>

762
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,815
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

763
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,404
<i>Picture me a balcony</i>

764
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,408
<i>Above a voice sings low...</i>

765
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,368
<i>MATT OX: Laggin' on the comers.
(GROANS)</i>

766
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,953
No, there, d'you see that?

767
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,913
What my robot did, that's how you do it.

768
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,458
New product's afraid.

769
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,671
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

770
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,608
<i>FEMALE HOSTAGE: Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>

771
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:49,675
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

772
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:53,137
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

773
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,598
<i>Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!</i>

774
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,934
Oh, well, it's worried that the kid's gonna get hurt.

775
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,603
<i>Let the kid go!
MATT OX: Too bad.</i>

776
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:06,108
Well, there you have it. 5.6 seconds behind.
Scenario failure.

777
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,152
I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.

778
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,035
Let's do it again.
Your funeral.

779
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,915
Detective Alex Murphy.

780
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,291
FEMALE <i>AUTOMATED VOICE: Search results.</i>

781
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,418

782
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,712

783
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,257
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight, Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>

784
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,885
Antoine Vallon.

785
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,053
FEMALE <i>AUTOMATED VOICE: Search results.</i>

786
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:38,265
<i>"DPD says Antoine Val/on no longer suspect due to lack of evidence."</i>

787
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,475
(SCOFFS)

788
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,687
<i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

789
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:46,941
<i>Unfortunately, Murphy's investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>

790
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:48,464
<i>wasn't authorized in the first place.</i>

791
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:52,238
<i>Look, Detective Murphy was simply overzealous, okay?</i>

792
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,449
<i>We have absolutely no evidence linking Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>

793
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,826
<i>All I'm gonna say is my partner's a great cop.</i>

794
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,413
<i>And I won't rest until the men who tried to kill him are brought to justice.</i>

795
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:06,353
SELLARS: What's wrong with him?

796
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:07,657
DR. NORTON: No, nothing, nothing.

797
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:12,049
Watch the procedural bars on the 208.

798
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:16,428
The machine assesses the threat and acts.

799
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,430
That's it.

800
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,308
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

801
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,438
The software assesses the threat, just like the robot.

802
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,482
And it sends the information to the brain.

803
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:31,402
Alex's brain receives the information and decides what to do with it

804
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:36,115
based on his emotional cognitive abilities like any man would.

805
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:39,451
Then the brain relates this to the Al module and...

806
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,329
Yeah, like, you know, a year later.

807
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:43,622
DR. NORTON: And our computers finish the job.

808
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:47,459
Raymond, you wanted a man inside a machine.

809
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,128
And that's what you've got.

810
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,338
But the human element will always be present.

811
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:54,008
Fear, instinct, bias, compassion,

812
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,342
they will always interfere with the system!

813
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:56,969
Okay, but, Dennett, (SIGHS)

814
00:43:57,052 --> 00:44:00,472
I've gotta give the American people something they can root for.

815
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,308
Something aspirational, right?

816
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,809
They have to believe in this thing.

817
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:07,396
"Pretty good"?
 I don't know how to sell "okay."

818
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,106
We, you and I, have got a release date,

819
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,607
and we've gotta make it, okay?

820
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:11,784
So I don't care how you do it.

821
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,302
I'm askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

822
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,206
Just get him to do that.

823
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,847
Get him to do that.

824
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,324
That is a machine.

825
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:19,867
I know, but it's a man inside a machine.

826
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,828
No, that's a man inside a machine right there!

827
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,996
And his life depends on it.

828
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,456
And the future of Omnicorp depends on it

829
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,375
so get your ass back to China and get it fixed.

830
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,627
I don't care how you do it, just go do it!

831
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:49,188
It tastes like peanut butter.

832
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,319
I can't get it out of my mouth.

833
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,788
DR. NORTON: And you don't like peanut butter?

834
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,156
No.
(CHUCKLES)

835
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,492
You like peanut butter, Kim?

836
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,077
KIM: I love it.

837
00:45:04,787 --> 00:45:06,205
Okay.

838
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,832
I'm gonna put you to sleep now, Alex.

839
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay.

840
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,253
Now, put him under, Kim.

841
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,215
(BEEPING)

842
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,344
What are you planning to do?

843
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:25,224
Consciousness is nothing more

844
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:28,102
than the processing of information.

845
00:45:29,645 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm gonna fix him.

846
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,983
And he won't know the difference.

847
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:47,913
Raymond?
Yeah?

848
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:51,458
We just ran focus groups at Ryan Correctional Facility.

849
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:55,421
We call this Combat Mode.

850
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,298
It really put the fear of God into the prisoners.

851
00:45:58,465 --> 00:45:59,591
Yeah, that's okay.

852
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,510
And get a load of this.

853
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:06,098
What's that? He transforms.
Kids love it.

854
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,767
Really? Focus group numbers through the roof.

855
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,269
(CHUCKLES) Really?
Oh, yeah.

856
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:12,396
Well, that's really embarrassing.

857
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:14,523
What is this?
You know what?

858
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,525
People really don't know what they want

859
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,819
until you show it to 'em most of the time.

860
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:21,905
(SIGHS) Make him more, uh,

861
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:22,990
tactical.

862
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,616
Make him look, uh...

863
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,537
Let's go with black.

864
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,039
Yeah.

865
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,201
Alex.

866
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,453
He looks like a billion dollars.

867
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,580
2.6 billion.

I really appreciate everything you've done for me.

00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:22,716
Well, we funded this program to give men like you a second chance.
