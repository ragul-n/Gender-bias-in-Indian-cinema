00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,100
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,500
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,430
Thank God, you are back safe and sound.
God has accepted my prayers.

5
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,400
Suleyman. Suleyman.

6
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,360
Suleyman.

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,960
Dear God.

8
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,500
You will pay for this.
Your tribe will be exterminated!

9
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,330
You won’t have any daylight to see.

10
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,800
Look at that lowlife dog, still barking!

11
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,460
Stop! What are you doing?
Didn’t you hear Bey’s orders?

12
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,030
Would a Kayi member violate
his Bey’s order?

13
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Suleyman, you are not well,
let me call Akcakoca to come and see you.

14
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,900
Do not worry, Hayme. I am only tired.

15
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,430
Where are the Bey symbols?

16
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,500
Kurdoglu’s doings. Come on.

17
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,060
Lay back.

18
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,330
Never mind.

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Do not frown, Hayme.
Let us catch our breath first...

20
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,800
...we will talk about what happened later.

21
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,830
He swung his sword and...

22
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,060
...cut the enemy’s throat.

23
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,560
I wish I could have been there
and saw it with my own eyes.

24
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,400
You know, when I grow up I will be like
my brother Ertugrul...

25
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,230
...as strong and as brave as him.

26
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,530
See?

27
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,520
If you keep this up,
you will surpass all the Alps, Dundar.

28
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,760
Brother? Yigit was telling me
how you fought with the enemy.

29
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,300
He was very brave as well,
did he tell you those as well?

30
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,430
I will go and check on my father.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,930
Tell me now.
Did you do the job I gave you?

32
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,160
After you left,
something happened to the tribe.

33
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,260
They stoned sister Halime's tent.

34
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,400
-They stoned the tent?
-Yes.

35
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,430
-And sister Halime was inside.
-Inside?

36
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,160
Thank God my mother came
and scored them off.

37
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,900
Then she took sister Halime to our tent.

38
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,900
I know you are troubled.
I know you went through a lot.

39
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,230
But these are all temporary,
you know how to pass these difficulties.

40
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,000
I did not only make a problem for myself,
I made a problem for others as well.

41
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,560
Be more gentle, Hatun.

42
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,930
Should I grieve for my Alps
who set off with me and died...

43
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,900
...or that I was a captive of that dog Kara Toygar.

44
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,900
Should I be embarrassed because our Bey,
my father surrendered himself just to save me...

45
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,860
...or that Ertugrul came and played the hero!

46
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,300
They sowed the seeds,
Kara Toygar mowed you.

47
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,960
Are you blaming yourself
for being grinded in the millstone?

48
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,600
The real culprits are enjoying themselves.

49
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,960
Brother.

50
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,500
Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.
I was coming to see you.

51
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,900
Brother, mother should have prepared
some food, let me go and check.

52
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,530
My heart was right.
You kept your promise once again.

53
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,900
You brought my father and brother
back to me safe and sound.

54
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,300
May God bless you, Ertugrul Bey.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,360
Thank God, we had the chance to return.

56
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,200
I heard about what some people did
when we were gone, Halime Sultan.

57
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,160
I heard that some presumptuous people
did some unforgivable things.

58
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,960
They betrayed their Bey and
customs to stone a tent.

59
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,800
You were not here but...

60
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,280
...Bey’s wife, most gracious Mother Hayme
stood before them like a mountain.

61
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,260
-She took me under her wings.
-They will pay for what they did.

62
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,230
You have returned safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

63
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,300
As I am thankful to God, I have
no place for anger in my heart or tongue.

64
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,100
Do not dwell on those tactless people,
Ertugrul. They were in pain.

65
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,430
They lost their loved ones because of us.

66
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,930
You have such a pure heart, even the evil
things done against you cannot defile it.

67
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,930
In the lifetime allocated to us,
there are things which are good or evil.

68
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,600
We thank God, when He gives a sorrow,
He gives a remedy as well.

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,230
My father told me that you will be with us
until we leave the Seljuk territory.

70
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,100
If God permits.

71
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,100
I will be beside the tree.

72
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,960
With your permission, I would like to
introduce you to a very nice girl.

73
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,600
Gundogdu Bey...

74
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,500
...if there is someone who should be
ashamed, that person is not you.

75
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,060
Ertugrul should be ashamed
as he led this curse upon our tribe.

76
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,060
Look at the situation I am in, Hatun.

77
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,560
Look how embarrassed I felt in front of the people!

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,930
My honor is crushed.

79
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Do not worry, people know the truth.

80
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,300
Wind cannot rock a stone,
only takes the dust on it.

81
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,900
Giving up does not suit you.
Now come to the table.

82
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,230
Your father expects all the family
to be there.

83
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,930
What will happen now, my Bey?
What if Kara Toygar speaks?

84
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,030
We will do whatever is needed.
The arrow has been thrown.

85
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,000
It's not up to fate to see who gets shot.

86
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,900
My Bey, even if we deal with Kara Toygar...

87
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,360
...we fueled the fire in the tribe while
Suleyman Shah was gone.

88
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,600
Won’t he ask about the culprits?

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,930
If he starts to investigate the matter,
my head will be on the line first.

90
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,600
Baybora, we are in a storm
at the moment.

91
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,760
If you tremble like a dried leaf,
you can be scattered!

92
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
Be strong!

93
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
What should I do then, my Bey?

94
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,500
Go and hide for a while.

95
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,230
I will call you back when
the dust settles.

96
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,100
-Alright, my Bey.
-And what are we going to do, my Bey?

97
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,680
What we are going to do?

98
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,080
We will return the symbols to Suleyman Shah...

99
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,560
...that we preserved in his absence.

100
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,160
-Where is your brother?
-He is talking with sister Halime.

101
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,160
I am sorry that I am late.

102
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,230
Gokce, come on my girl, you sit as well.

103
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,100
In the name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful.

104
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,260
We delayed it due to these
recent events but...

105
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,400
...I need to take the signed letter
back to Aleppo, father.

106
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,430
The guests would like to go as well.
I do not know their destination...

107
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
...but we discussed that
we can at least go to Aleppo together.

108
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,060
If you give permission.

109
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,230
After the headquarters and the funerals,
we shall think about it.

110
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,130
Baybora.

111
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,060
There it is, Alpargu...

112
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,900
...we brought back the Bey symbols to
where they belong.

113
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,960
-What is happening, Rahman?
-Kurdoglu brought back the Bey symbols.

114
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,460
He asks for permission to come in.

115
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,860
Tell him to wait.

116
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,460
Now, tell me.
Who told you the tent Hamza was hiding in?

117
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,160
Come on. I am listening. Tell me.

118
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,430
Who was behind this malice?

119
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
I cannot talk, my Bey.
If I do, they would kill me.

120
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,930
So they would kill you.

121
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,860
Who told you that
we would spare you if you don’t?

122
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Go on, talk, you dog!

123
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,260
The stones you threw to sister Halime's
tent, were they as big as these?

124
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,060
Talk...

125
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,000
...so that you have a chance.

126
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,600
Who provoked you to attack? Who? Tell me!

127
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,900
Dogan...

128
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,230
...these valiant people
do not deserve small stones like pebbles.

129
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,600
Big rocks like this one are more suitable.

130
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,230
It was Baybora.

131
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,560
It was Baybora’s doing.

132
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,100
Really?

133
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,360
As if my brother’s madness,
my father’s stubbornness...

134
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,260
...and the cruelty of the enemy
is not enough...

135
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
...we have a traitor within us.

136
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,460
A traitor who sells
his own people to the enemy.

137
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Who is this traitor?

138
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,260
If I knew...

139
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,400
If I knew,
I would punish him with my own hands.

140
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,800
But he must be very close.

141
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,860
So there is a traitor nearby teaming up
with the enemy but you still...

142
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,600
...hide in your tent and keep quiet,
is that so?

143
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,000
Don’t you understand? You are
the only hope for this tribe, Gundogdu.

144
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,130
Don’t leave the field empty for others
to roam, don’t let unity of the tribe...

145
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,800
...fall apart for those faceless people
who we don’t know anything about.

146
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,000
The people you have been whinging about,
do you know who they are…

147
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,400
Who?

148
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,430
They are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

149
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,130
The man called Numan is a Shahzada and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

150
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,860
Now I understand everything
that has happened.

151
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,600
The trouble Ertugrul brought
to our tribe overwhelmed him as well.

152
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,000
Will you sit here and watch like
an outsider or will you get up...

153
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,400
...show what you are made of?
-Don’t you understand, Hatun?

154
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,600
He is the one who is protecting
the Shahzada and his family...

155
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,030
...he is the one who saved me,
he is the one who saved my father...

156
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,430
...he is the one who captured KaraToygar.

157
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,900
-But...
-There is no but to it!

158
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
Enough. I am tired.

159
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,600
After we leave the Seljuk territory
safely with the help of Ertugrul Bey...

160
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,230
...the rest is my duty, my Shahzada.
You can be rest assured.

161
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,000
You have helped us greatly
in our time of need, Afsin Bey.

162
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,130
-Thank you.
-Not at all, my Shahzada. It is my duty.

163
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,400
Father...

164
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,800
My son?

165
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,460
I am fed up of running away.
We are always on the roads.

166
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,330
We are always running away.
I get scared while running away, father.

167
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,900
This is the first time I had a friend.
For the first time I played games.

168
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,400
I don’t want to leave, father.
Let us stay here.

169
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,030
But we have to go, my son.

170
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,030
For your sister, for your future...

171
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,030
...we have to go.

172
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,600
I saw this mare in the mountains
where I had gone to become an Alp.

173
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,330
She was different from the other mares.
Wilder and more maverick.

174
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,830
She was very hard to catch,
even harder to bring to the tribe.

175
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,230
She was very stubborn.

176
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,830
Then she drank the water of the tribe,
ate its bread. She was tamed.

177
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,330
As she believed and trusted,
she understood her value in my eyes.

178
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,900
She is yours now.
If you give permission...

179
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,130
...I named her Sultan.

180
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,200
God willing...

181
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,960
...you shall never be separated from her.

182
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,800
We have a long journey ahead.

183
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,830
Even if the end is imminent,
the journey is ours.

184
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,430
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

185
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,860
I will take care of Sultan.

186
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,360
She will be by my side as long as I live.

187
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,300
With my apologies, my Bey.

188
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,060
We found out the person
who provoked the people.

189
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,400
-Who was it?
-Baybora.

190
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,020
I hope you did not get bored of waiting,
Kurdoglu.

191
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,220
I know you don’t like it at all.

192
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,530
Not at all, my Bey.

193
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,930
We would wait for you
until our last day if needed.

194
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,360
May it be easy on you, my Bey.
God spared you for us.

195
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,530
What happened is in the past.

196
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,530
You tell me now, what happened
in the tribe while I was away?

197
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,030
Some people saw Hamza, my Bey.
They got suspicious.

198
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,130
They created a bit of
a havoc in the tribe.

199
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,430
Thank God, Mother Hayme came out and
put those tactless people in their place.

200
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,100
Hayme may have put those tactless people
in their place, what did you do, Kurdoglu?

201
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,800
First I gathered the Beys
in the tent to calm them down.

202
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,260
I did not want them to see
the tent empty and to think that...

203
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,100
...no one is leading them. Otherwise,
things might have gone out of control.

204
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,760
We did what we had to do and
controlled the situation, thanks to you.

205
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,240
Well...

206
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,300
...what about taking
the Bey symbols out, Kurdoglu?

207
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,360
My Bey...

208
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,500
...while Hayme Hatun was dealing with
her own troubles here...

209
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,960
...I didn't think it would be wise to deal
with the tribe issues here as well.

210
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,560
Thank you.

211
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,860
But, there is a traitor in the tribe,
this is obvious.

212
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,860
As I said, my Bey...

213
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,030
...some people saw Hamza. They must have
seen him while Akcakoca was going in...

214
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,330
...and getting out of the tent.

215
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,060
This is not one, not two, Kurdoglu.

216
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,980
When they ambushed the tribe,
someone showed them the way.

217
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,260
The same person informed Kara Toygar about
the trap we set at the place of exchange.

218
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,140
If Ertugrul did not change the plan...

219
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,200
...we would have been killed
at those rocks.

220
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,900
If there is such a traitor, my Bey, I would
skin him alive in the middle of the tribe.

221
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,200
Do you have any other orders for me, my Bey?

222
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,100
We will gather the Beys at
the headquarters and talk about the trial.

223
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,530
My wish is to send Kara Toygar
to the Sultan to be judged.

224
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,530
Support me in the headquarters. Help me.
We need to calm down the public.

225
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,160
This is the wisest decision, my Bey.

226
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,000
Do not worry.

227
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,930
Hayme...

228
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,960
...my valiant wife.
We have been through hard times.

229
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,430
Do not overthink these things. Kurdoglu
did what he had to do. Do not dwell on it.

230
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,930
You know best, my Bey.

231
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,600
What are you doing in my tent?

232
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,200
There is a ring of fire all around us,
what would people think?

233
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,360
Do not speak in vain, Kurdoglu.
We are partners of crime now.

234
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,200
We will either rise together
or we will sink together.

235
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,830
Moreover, when you hear the thing
I came here to tell you...

236
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,100
...you will be thanking me.

237
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,360
Do you know who those migrating birds
that took refuge in our tribe really are?

238
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,300
Yes, Kurdoglu Bey. I shall inform
Gundogdu Bey that you will visit him.

239
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
He will be glad.

240
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,330
What happened, Ertugrul? Why did you
fall on my tent like a lightning?

241
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,030
Do you know where Baybora is?

242
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,900
How should I know, Ertugrul?
But if you need him, I can send someone.

243
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,600
Do not bother yourself. I will find him.

244
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,460
Sister...

245
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,260
-Sister.
-What?

246
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,560
Ertugrul and Halime were together
under a tree all alone.

247
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,430
It is obvious that Ertugrul Bey
is determined to go with them.

248
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,060
I saw them with my own eyes.

249
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,260
-He gave that girl a horse as a present.
-Enough!

250
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,200
I have to take matters
in my own hands once again.

251
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,430
You can sit and cry, Gokce.

252
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,800
Ertugrul has connected the dots.

253
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,300
Finish off Baybora.

254
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,330
We have to break the chain before
it gets tangled around our throats.

255
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,000
Do I have permission, father?

256
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,930
Come in, my girl, come.

257
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,860
How are you, father? Do you need anything?

258
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Thank you, my dear. How are you?

259
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,200
How is Gundogdu?

260
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,330
He is sad, father. I am afraid that
he may not recover from this.

261
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,200
He is in great pain but the worst one
is the Alps who got killed.

262
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
He came up with the idea of
going to Aleppo. He found a new home...

263
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,300
...but he did not even have the chance
to be happy when he heard the news.

264
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,230
When Ertugrul said that he will return
to Aleppo, he got even more depressed.

265
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,860
If Gundogdu can go to Aleppo,
he might recover somewhat.

266
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,160
I do not know what to do.
I'm just waiting.

267
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,930
Gundogdu on one side
and Gokce on the other.

268
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,100
When she learned that Ertugrul and Halime
will go to Aleppo, she got depressed.

269
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,430
You know how sensitive she is.

270
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,800
She worries that a shadow might
cast over her happiness with Ertugrul.

271
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,260
Look, son...

272
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,800
...the thing you are forging is
a bar of iron, not Kara Toygar’s head.

273
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,230
It is as if you have a problem
but you do not talk about it.

274
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,260
What use would talking do?

275
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,300
What use would keeping quiet do?

276
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,230
Look now...

277
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,860
...there is one problem
which is beyond all other problems.

278
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,530
It is beyond migrating or
fighting in a battle.

279
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,400
My Bey...

280
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,960
...there is someone who wants to see you.
-Who?

281
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,260
It is such a big problem that many Beys,
many valiant Alps cannot handle it.

282
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,600
I have such a problem Deli Demir
that I cannot speak of it.

283
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,600
I do not know the words
that can describe this problem.

284
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,160
The tongue is only
a messenger of the heart, son.

285
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,560
The problem is not in the tongue
but in the heart.

286
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,000
If your heart is right...

287
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,820
...both your words and your heart will find their way.

288
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,960
But your problem is obvious, son.

289
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,060
There is only one problem
that scares a brave...

290
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,960
...and that is love.

291
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,830
If you open your heart
to the one you love...

292
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,960
...you would grow like an sycamore tree.

293
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,030
If you do not...

294
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,200
...a worm would start eating you alive
from inside.

295
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,500
Even if you are a great sycamore tree,
you would fall down.

296
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,060
How can I do it?

297
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,160
She can never abandon her father or
brother and I cannot abandon my home.

298
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,360
Tribe is a tribe with loved ones.
Home is a home with loved ones.

299
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,430
You are Ertugrul with your love...

300
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,100
...if you do not have love,
any place you call home...

301
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,800
...any sword you swing to the infidels
would not satisfy you.

302
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,500
Come on,
break that chain on your tongue...

303
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,360
...so that your heart can have some peace.
-The corpses of our Alps are coming.

304
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,230
What advantage will you gain over this?

305
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,060
We don’t want you to settle on our borders
and be trouble for us. That is all.

306
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,860
According to Kara Toygar,
you are an intelligent man.

307
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,160
If he is right,
all three of us want the same thing.

308
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:27,030
Both Kayis’ and your rescue depends on
Kara Toygar’s being commander of the army

309
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,430
He is the only person that would make
you Bey and let your tribe migrate...

310
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,400
...to anywhere you like.
You are in a big trouble Kurdoglu.

311
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,460
You are responsible for the death
of those Alps you will bury soon.

312
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,360
You cannot clean your hands without
becoming the Bey of the tribe.

313
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,160
It’s not possible to get Kara Toygar
out of the tribe but...

314
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,930
...if you are as strong as
you claim to be...

315
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,160
...you can save him.

316
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,260
Why did we need to meet secretly, Alpargu?

317
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,300
Ertugrul...

318
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,130
...found out that you provoked the public.

319
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,100
-How?
-He probably made your dogs talk.

320
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,800
You lowlife! I warned you all!

321
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,300
I told you that we cannot get away
with it! You did not hear me!

322
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,600
It was you and Kurdoglu that made
everything come to this point.

323
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,360
What will I do now?

324
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,460
Get on your horse and run away.
Don’t ever look back.

325
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,000
Where will I go? Where?

326
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,800
I have children.
How can I leave them behind and go?

327
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,830
You shall return when
we set everything straight.

328
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,530
This is not a dirt on the hand
that can be washed away in a few seconds.

329
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,330
So many Alps died,
all the goods in the caravan are gone.

330
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,800
-You think Suleyman Shah would let it go?
-Control yourself, Baybora!

331
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,330
How can I go without them?

332
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,130
How can my children live
in the tribe with this shame?

333
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,100
You lowlife!

334
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,930
Do not worry...

335
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,960
...I will look after your family.

336
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
For the men who died...

337
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
God is the Greatest.

338
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
God is the Greatest.

339
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
God is the Greatest.

340
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

341
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,640
Peace be upon you and God’s blessings.

342
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,060
Our brothers ask for your
blessing one last time.

343
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,260
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

344
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,400
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

345
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,460
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

346
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,530
If God permits,
they will forgive us as well.

347
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,930
For our Prophet Muhammad's intercession...

348
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,060
...for our brothers’ soul...

349
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,860
...for our tribe’s unity and abundance...

350
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,360
For God’s mercy...

351
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,330
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.
