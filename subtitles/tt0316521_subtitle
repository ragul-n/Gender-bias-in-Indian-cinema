7
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,993
Chauhan.

Good evening, Sir! - Good evening.

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,632
Sir.. - Go to bed. - Yes, sir.

Ashok!

13
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,509
Ashok!

14
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,555
What is there in your wallet?

15
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,910
lt is empty.
- What is this? - This is a watch.

16
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,873
The man is like a cannon and
the watch is just this much?

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,911
lt is not mine.. wife.. wife.. wife.

18
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,871
lt won"t even be sold in the
flea market. Get lost! Get lost.

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,399
Get lost from here.
- Yes..

20
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,033
Don"t make any sound. Otherwise..

21
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,674
l won"t make anything. Hail lndia!

22
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,395
Hail lndia!

23
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,593
Sir you.. l won"t
make anything. Kishore..

24
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,398
There is a hooded thief
in your room.

25
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,589
what are you saying?

26
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,393
My father is there,
and he has a pistol in his hand.

27
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,795
Pistol!

28
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,749
lf he has a pistol in his hand,
we have four hands too.

29
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,313
No.. No.. - Come.
- No.. No.. l won"t come.

30
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,509
You are unmarried. You go.

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,790
l have a wife.. one..
and l have four to six children.

32
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,955
Go. l will leave now.

33
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,554
Hands.. up..

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,476
l am not the warden, l am Kishore.

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,034
Hi! Kishore.
- What is this?

36
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,954
What could l do, friend?
l went out with a pass.

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,476
l came back through the pipe.

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,716
When l came back, l met the warden.

39
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,158
When will you rectify your ways?

40
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,311
lf l didn"t take
your responsibility..

41
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,873
..you"d be chucked out
of this hostel long ago.

42
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,670
See, friend. lf you do a
good deed, don"t show it off.

43
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,554
Ashok. l am telling
you for your own good.

44
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,878
This is our last year
in the college.

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,991
And then these reports
and complaints of yours.

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,913
This is a college,
not a wrestling arena.

47
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,431
What you say is perfectly correct.

48
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,319
But l am a crooked
fellow since many years..

49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,874
..how will l change
myself just like that?

50
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,395
At least you can try..

51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,433
A lion can try a lot,
but he can"t be a donkey.

52
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,632
But Ashok..
- Good night.

53
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,874
Did you do my homework?

54
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,716
So you were that hooded thief?

55
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,752
Yes, sir.
- Why are you stammering like that?

56
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,032
You sang poems in the hostel.
l have forgiven you.

57
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,149
True, sir.
- You danced in the hostel!

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,433
l have forgiven you.
- very true, sir.

59
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,398
You cleaned the
wallets of other students.

60
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,198
l have forgiven you.

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,119
Sir, your character,
it is very strong.

62
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,559
why do you spoil your habit?

63
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,036
Forgive me this time too.
- Have you thought me to be God?

64
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,070
No.. Have you thought me to
be the god of forgiveness?

65
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,596
No sir. - Get out of the
hostel right away. Get out!

66
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,312
Think about it.
lf you chuck me out of the hostel..

67
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,829
..the spring from this
hostel will disappear too.

68
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,791
lf there isn"t any criminal here,
whom will you forgive?

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,955
Shut up!

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,992
Sir.. Sir l apologise
to you on his behalf.

71
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,949
Kishore. You are a
responsible student.

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,549
l have forgiven each and
every mistake of his, due to you.

73
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,318
But the water has
gone above the head now.

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,193
Please, sir. How many days
are left for the exams now?

75
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,957
l.. l take his responsibility sir.

76
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,308
lf he does anything
against the discipline again..

77
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,396
..l myself will chuck
him out of the room.

78
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,033
Be assured, sir,
l will go away from here myself.

79
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,796
Please, sir. l beg you.
Forgive him this time.

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,393
Please, sir.
- Kishore.

81
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,630
You always take
advantage of my soft heartedness.

82
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,995
Ashok. Apologise!

83
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,430
Sir, with my hard heart..
l will.. l will..

84
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,478
Repent.
- l will repent.

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,069
very good. But this
is my last warning.

86
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,750
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

87
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,312
Tell me. Are you ashamed now?.

88
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,432
No, not at all, sir.
Of which mud are you made up of?

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,075
Think about it, Ashok.

90
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,395
Why is your brother
making you study..

91
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,953
..even after almost starving there?

92
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,390
Because there is a..
- Need.

93
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,555
Because there is a need of
educated people in lndia.

94
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,318
You joke on almost any matter.

95
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,396
l haven"t opened up
a shop for crying.

96
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,318
See, Kishore. ln our friendship
going back to crores of years..

97
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,317
..you always showed
me the right path..

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,510
..but l always took the wrong..

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,712
Destination. - Destination.
But about the right path..

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,956
Destination.
- lt is one and the same.

101
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,752
What is your problem is
walking to the right destination?

102
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,632
Which you have to
walk on the wrong one.

103
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,435
You like truth. l love falsehood.

104
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,595
See ,Ashok.

105
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,955
lf you don"t agree to
it today, you..

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,115
.. will accept it
someday or the other.

107
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,551
That there are roses
on the path of truth.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,030
And there are only thorns
on the path of falsehood.

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,475
You go and see two flowers.

110
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,953
l will go and see one
flower and four thorns.

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,195
Come on. We will have some tea.

112
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,876
l had starved and collected
this money to give it to you.

113
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,839
But what can l do? lt is my
brother"s last year in the college.

114
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,317
lf l don"t pay his
fees till tomorrow..

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,670
..his year will go a waste.

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,036
lf this is the matter,
you"ll always be a temporary clerk.

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,594
Sir! You are my master.

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,872
Whom will l beg to,
if not my master?

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,514
Even l have some problems.

120
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,873
My son studies in the college too.

121
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,475
My son"s college studies is more..

122
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,511
.. important for me than
your brother"s studies.

123
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,390
You can make your brother
study even then, if you wish to.

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,428
l will make another clerk
permanent in your place.

125
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,912
No. Sir. No! Here, take this.
- Keep it on the table there.

126
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,469
l don"t touch such
wealth with my own hands.

127
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,795
Okay, sir.

128
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,391
My brother will pass
next year. Next year.

129
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,073
These are only seventy rupees.
what about the rest?

130
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,951
l could manage only
this much this month, sir.

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,796
l will give you the rest
thirty the next month, l beg you.

132
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,596
Okay! Okay. What a time has come?

133
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,069
People take credit for bribery too!

134
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,199
Shobha"s mother! Shobha"s mother.

135
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,874
What is the matter?
- Take these seventy rupees.

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,035
Keep them inside.

137
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,117
Where did this money
come from on a holiday?

138
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,392
Why do you care about
kernels when you eat mangoes?

139
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,148
You shouldn"t think about
where wealth comes from.

140
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,393
Yes. You should always keep
an account of where it goes to.

141
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,714
One two.

142
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,993
Tell me, sir.
How is Shobha"s study going on?

143
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,031
Sir, what can l say now?.

144
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,317
l have taught damsels
of higher families..

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,475
..in the art of dance.

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,672
But l haven"t seen
such a talented girl.

147
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,835
lf this continues..

148
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,032
..she will glorify her teacher"s
as well as family"s name.

149
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,958
But sir.. When will that day come?

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,318
l have heard that even common girls..

151
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,955
..set up ten to twenty
thousand rupees in the film world.

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,674
l am learning dance as a hobby.

153
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,394
l don"t want to become an
actress after learning dance.

154
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,399
What is the problem in that?

155
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,030
Dancing is an art and a talent too.

156
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,317
Don"t you know?. There was that..

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,908
..Ramdas cobbler"s daughter,
Ramdei in your school?

158
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,550
They used to beg and
eat twice in the day.

159
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,318
Today, that same Ramdei is playing..

160
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,590
..in lakhs of rupees as Miss Rambha.

161
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,832
l had seen Ramdas moving
in an lmpala just yesterday.

162
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,710
That rogue answered my
greeting with a single finger.

163
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,473
Mother, please explain it to daddy.

164
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,438
To stop seeing such fake dreams.

165
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,398
l don"t want to become
an actress or anything.

166
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,475
Don"t worry, dear. God
has given us everything.

167
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,308
When we can eat twice with respect..

168
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,512
..why do we need to
dream about lakhs and crores?

169
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,318
The people who are fated
to travel in carriages..

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,829
..how will they know
the worth of a motor car?

171
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,710
Can l come inside? Please do.

172
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,799
Does Ashok stay in this room?
- Yes. Who are you?

173
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,031
Me? l am his elder brother.
- Oh! Greetings.

174
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,396
Bless you.
- Where has he gone to?

175
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,753
He has gone out since morning.
He will be back by evening.

176
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,915
Till evening?

177
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,755
But l have to go back to
Pune by the next train.

178
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,998
Please tell Ashok that l"d come..

179
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,635
..and..

180
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,956
..and l couldn"t arrange
for his fees.

181
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,871
l had collected the money.

182
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,957
But l had to give to an
officer for my promotion as a bribe.

183
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,395
Bribe? Who was that fool?

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,677
What is the use in
taking anyone"s name?

185
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,831
Make Ashok understand
my helplessness.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,673
Please don"t worry.
l will explain everything.

187
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,709
Shall l leave now?

188
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,749
Won"t you have any tea or something?

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,112
May God keep you happy.

190
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,679
Dharamdas! How come you
are in Bombay?

191
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,713
Sir, didn"t l tell you?
My brother was in a college?

192
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,479
He studies in this hostel itself.

193
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,553
Okay. So you"d come to
pay his yearly fees?

194
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,829
How could l give him the fees?

195
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,597
l had taken a day off to come
and explain my problem to him.

196
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,195
See, Dharamdas.

197
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,950
Give the rest of the
money quickly, okay?

198
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,635
Kishor.

199
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,510
Daddy!
- Bless you, son. Bless you.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,796
Sit!
- Are you studying? - Yes.

201
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,956
At least you should have
told me about your arrival.

202
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,749
Son, your college
called me all of a sudden.

203
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,077
My college? - Yes. Even l am
an ex student of this college.

204
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,630
There is the annual function of
your college, isn"t it? - Yes.

205
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,079
l have been chosen as
the chief guest for that.

206
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,431
ls it so? This is very good.

207
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,835
Even l am taking part in
that function. - Good!

208
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,712
Son, the person who went
out of your room now..

209
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,475
Who was he?

210
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,678
He was the brother of
my friend Ashok.

211
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,717
very poor and deprived.

212
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,435
He had saved some money as
fees for his brother"s studies.

213
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,308
But he had to give them to some..

214
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,513
..un-contentious
officer for his promotion.

215
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,391
The wrong breeze is
working in the world.

216
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,714
Taking a bribe from some poor man?

217
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,509
Ram.. Ram.. Ram..

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,071
This bribery is
making our country hollow.

219
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,391
The sir takes a bribe
from the clerk.

220
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,748
The clerk takes a bribe
from the peon.

221
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,154
And the peon takes a
bribe from the people.

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,989
Ram.. Ram.. Ram..

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,395
lt is the wealth of someone else.
And miracle of someone else.

224
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,988
Kishore, my friend,
congratulate me. Congratulate me!

225
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,678
Elder brother was fooled this time.

226
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,314
Not the money.. yes. Hello.
He didn"t send the money and l..

227
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,510
..didn"t get the form
to sit in the finals.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,074
Ashok, at least meet father first.
- Yes?

229
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,918
Father. This is Ashok.

230
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,829
Uncle. Greetings. very
pleased to meet you.

231
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,558
Bless you.
- Thank you.

232
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,035
What is it?
- Your brother had come.

233
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,195
ls it?
- Yes.

234
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,071
He has given some money
for your fees.

235
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,440
Do you mean to say that l will
have study for the examination?

236
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,318
Okay, Kishore. l will leave now..

237
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,032
..Meet me in the
Shalimar hotel in the evening.

238
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,718
Uncle, please have
something before you leave.

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,751
No. l am in a hurry.
- ls it so?

240
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,959
Tell me son. Did you take
this money from your wallet?

241
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,391
No. Your brother gave it to me.

242
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,919
l can understand everything.

243
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,032
You sing the song of truth
all through the day and night.

244
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,197
But you don"t stop lying for
the sake of your friend too.

245
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,312
lf my brother had come here,
without seeing my beautiful..

246
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,638
..face, he wouldn"t have..
What is that? - Left.

247
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,875
He wouldn"t have left from here.

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,638
Okay. l understand.
Go now. Get the form.

249
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,310
Friend, why do you wish to
misfire your father"s hard..

250
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,591
..earned money on the false
friendship of your false friend?

251
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,957
First of all, l won"t be passing.
l promise you.

252
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,309
And even if l do pass,
the quicksand..

253
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,716
..beneath my feet tells me
that l won"t be getting any job.

254
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,875
See..

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,319
Then do any business.

256
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,795
But it is not necessary that
l pass for the business that l do.

257
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,550
We can do it even after
failing and drinking cold water.

258
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,835
What kind of business is that?

259
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,475
Moving materials from here to there.

260
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,398
You started your rubbish once again?

261
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,395
Go and bring the form quickly.
Or else the office will close.

262
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,079
See, friend. Someone"s wealth,
someone"s miracle.

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,470
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

264
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,918
"l have seen it
nicely with my own eyes."

265
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,870
"lt is very difficult to find
out who is good and bad in it."

266
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,716
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

267
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,391
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

268
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,513

269
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,716
"lt is very difficult to find
out who is good and bad in it."

270
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,396
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

271
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,715
"We have seen
worshipers of truth starving."

272
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,433
"We have seen people who
tell lies enjoying life."

273
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:29,189
"On the bed of flowers.."

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,991
"The false man doesn"t get any
rest even on the bed of flowers."

275
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,399
"The true person gets sleep
even on thorns in a moment."

276
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,635
"Oh, friend!"

277
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,989
"Oh, friend!"

278
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,557
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

279
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,072
"l have seen it
nicely with my own eyes."

280
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,876
"lt is very difficult to find
out who is good and bad in it."

281
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,472
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

282
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,478
"The one with a clean heart
comes up even after falling down."

283
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,878
"Look at the moon.
lt drowns and then moves ahead."

284
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:58,719
"The one who"s stars shine.."

285
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,391
"He has been supported by everyone."

286
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,190
"Who has clasped the
falling man and supported him?"

287
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,194
"Oh, friend!"

288
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,429
"Oh, friend!"

289
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,196
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

290
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,513
"l have seen it
nicely with my own eyes."

291
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,515
"lt is very difficult to find
out who is good and bad in it."

292
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,430
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

293
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,390
"Every morning is the
festival of colours for me."

294
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,751
"Every evening is the
festival of lights for me."

295
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,594
"This world is for two days.
lt won"t go with us."

296
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:25,679
"ln this world.."

297
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,396
"ln this world, there is
a different way to live."

298
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,389
"Burn in a strange fire,
see it is something else."

299
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,589
"Oh, friend!"

300
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,034
"O friend!"

301
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,950
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

302
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,312
"l have seen it
nicely with my own eyes."

303
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,070
"lt is very difficult to find
out who is good and bad in it."

304
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,791
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

305
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,192
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

306
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,712
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

307
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,476
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

308
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,677
Dear students. l was very
happy by this celebration.

309
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,436
l even saw nice acting here..

310
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,959
..and heard nice
thoughts too. l believe..

311
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,758
..that the greatest victory of
man is to have good thoughts.

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,319
Therefore, l give this trophy..

313
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,079
..to my son, Kishore.

314
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,913
Ashok, you"d come home with
me too. We"d have real fun.

315
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,959
What will you do here without me?

316
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,312
Don"t worry about
lucky people, my friend.

317
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,158
They settle their
parties wherever they sit.

318
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,788
You think about yourself, okay.

319
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,428
lt is very difficult to live
right in this wrong world.

320
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,319
You whistle has blown, my friend!

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,873
Come on. Take care of yourself.

322
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,597
Take care of yourself. Look after
yourself. We"ll meet again!

323
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,800
Look after him.

324
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,115
Two rupees.

325
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,515
10 for 5.

326
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,309
Friends..

327
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,389
You will get eight
at the price of one.

328
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,719
Listen, friends, buy it..

329
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,398
Put two rupees.
You will get it increased.

330
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,555
You will get it increased.

331
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,116
You will hit a jackpot!

332

You will get it together.
You will get it increased.

333
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,759
Put a fistful, you will
get back a whole bundle.

334
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,074
Number five goes empty.
Number five goes empty.

335
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,715
Number five goes empty.

336
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:06,758
Number.. number four.
Don"t worry. Try it again.

337
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,519
The circle works again.
There is not loss.

338
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,715
You will get it increased.
You will get it.

339
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,478
The lucky people will get it.

340
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,519
Speak parrot, speak.

341
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,675
Oh, son of saints.

342
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,949
Open your mouth and tell us
what is there in your mouth.

343
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,790
what is the state of the
poor Chaman on your lips?

344
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,388
Sir! who are you speaking
about, sir?

345
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,875
l will tell you. l will tell you.

346
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,310
The parrot says that
the one sitting..

347
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,433
..with me is named Chaman.
- ls this parrot magical?

348
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
This parrot used to live on the Sun.

349
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,870
when the Sun became hot he
flew and reached the moon.

350
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,312
When two men got down on
the moon from the Apollo 11 ..

351
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,319
..and wandered around, it
came on earth to Dhoom..

352
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,797
..Dhaam Ram Chahel
Pahel Ram Mucchad Singh.

353
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,516
..Dhoom Dhaam Ram Chahel
- Pahel! - Pahel Ram Mucchad Singh.

354
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,593
You have got such a nice reward.
- very good.

355
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,518
lf you have fallen at my feet,
give me alms too.

356
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,398
l will give you. l will give you.

357
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,391
Do you have change for a ten? No?

358
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,029
Keep the whole note.

359
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,317
lt is written here that you
deal in numbers and numerical.

360
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,431
Right.
- l deal in roulette.

361
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,312
And it is written here
that you will be caught..

362
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,317
..and you will be mixing dough..

363
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,477
..for seven years in
the government canteen.

364
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,635
Seven years?

365
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,557
Please show me some solution,
please do! - There is a solution.

366
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,316
lt is written in
this that you should..

367
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,509
..unravel the mystery of
the numbers.

368
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,398
l should unravel the mystery?
That means l should speak?

369
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,308
Yes. Speak it out. - The matter
is that if the number three..

370
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,512
..comes three times, the
fourth time thirteen comes.

371
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,391
lf four comes three times,
the fourth time fourteen comes.

372
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,637
lf five comes three times,
the fourth time it is fifteen.

373
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,320
This is the matter. But
please keep this to yourself.

374
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,714
Bless you! Bless you!

375
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,515
You please me! You are
released from your sin.

376
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,312
And very soon, a beautiful girl..

377
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,512
..will knock on the
doors to your heart.

378
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,393
l will leave then.

379
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,317
Otherwise, the girl
will keep on knocking..

380
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,509
..at the handles of the door
and l will be sitting here.

381
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,675
l will leave now, okay?
l will leave!

382
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,629
She will knock actually.

383
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,473
You will get eight times your bet!

384
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,070
Twenty rupees on number five.
- Number five? Twenty rupees?

385
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,634
Number.. number..
number.. number.. five.

386
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,195
One hundred and eighty rupees.

387
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,913
One hundred and eighty rupees, sirs.

388
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,110
Your twenty has come here.
Here.. come here.

389
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,309
The circle starts again.

390
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,829
Bet sirs, bet, bet!
You get eight times your bet!

391
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,997
Bet a fistful, take a whole bundle!

392
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,314
Bet it quickly! Bet it!
- Twenty rupees on number nine.

393
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,873
Number nine.

394
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,833
Twenty rupees? Think about it.
Think about it again.

395
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,078
Number.. number.. number nine!

396
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,672
One hundred and eighty rupees.
- One hundred and eighty rupees.

397
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,150
Two hundred. l won"t
let you win this time.

398
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,715
Bet it. You will get
eight times your bet.

399
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,678
Two! Two! Two! Two!

400
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,799
Boy! Send two Sprites with soda.
- Twenty rupees! Twenty rupees!

401
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,433
l am having a hoarse throat.
Quickly!

402
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,709
The number two.
- Number two.

403
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,310
Number two? What? We
have set our number.

404
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,113
Number two? - Hey! Hey what is this?
Let me go! l have set my number!

405
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,676
What is the matter?
- What is the matter?

406
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,392
l bet and l won the money.

407
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,033
And how did he earn the money?

408
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,834
He emptied my wallets.
He was winning all the time.

409
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,793
l think that he has
found out about our trick.

410
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,309
Won"t Dhoom Dhaam
Ram Chahel Pahel Ram..

411
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,590
..Muchhad not know about it?

412
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,431
Okay! So you are the one of that
sun moon and Apollo 11? - Yes.

413
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,471
Boss! This man is very crooked.

414
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,716
The one who can fool
me can fool everyone.

415
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,478
He can fool you too!
- Shut up.

416
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,749
Will you work for us?
- What will be the job?

417
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,915
The job will be to bring scapegoats.

418
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,076
Trick them and take the salary.
- That"s it?

419
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,394
And to make the ones
who go crying happy.

420
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,511
You mean, singing and
dancing and all that? - Yes. Yes.

421
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,551
Okay. Agreed. But on one condition.

422
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,149
l won"t return
whatever l have earned now.

423
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,551
Okay. Agreed.
- What will be the salary?

424
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,719
25%/ percent of the total winnings.

425
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,115
25%/. Okay. Okay!
- Okay!

426
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,198
lt will be fun when two
crooked people sit together.

427
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,714
l thank you so much! You
fulfilled my brother"s trials.

428
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,073
Shobha! Dear Shobha!
- Mother! Mother!

429
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,192
l will take a party
from brother today.

430
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,317
He has already promised me that..

431
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,955
..whenever he passes,
he will treat all my friends too.

432
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,438
See. My Kishore has come.

433
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,719
Kishore, son, how are you?
- What is this, mother?

434
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,629
Why are you making a face?
You have passed first class.

435
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,398
Won"t you let me
kiss your forehead too?

436
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,710
The happiness of passing
is incomplete, mother.

437
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,715
My friend Ashok failed.
- That"s it.

438
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,758
The whole world"s pain is
in brother Kishore"s heart.

439
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,196
Brother. The one who
worked hard, passed.

440
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,919
And the one who didn"t, he failed.

441
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,559
No, Shobha. You don"t know.

442
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,190
lt was more important
for Ashok to pass than me.

443
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,035
He is from a poor household.

444
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,429
He has all the
responsibilities of his brother.

445
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,075
Forget other people"s sorrows.

446
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,398
First, go upstairs and
tell dad your good news.

447
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,312
He is waiting since
such a long time..

448
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,477
..that you will pass
and become a big man.

449
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,196
Go! Daddy will be so happy! Go!

450
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,513
Sir. Here are the rest
of the thirty rupees.

451
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,153
You have come at the right time.

452
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,511
l need this money urgently today.

453
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,712
Sir, but please keep me
permanent from next month.

454
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,396
See. l don"t keep
anyone"s gratitude on my head.

455
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,189
But Dharamdas, don"t think
that l asked you for a bribe.

456
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,993
l have just fulfilled my needs.

457
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,838
You haven"t
fulfilled your needs, daddy.

458
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,075
Say that you have taken the fire..

459
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,315
..from someone"s
burning funeral pyre..

460
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,113
..and kept the kitchen
flame of your house burning.

461
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,037
Kishore. What are you saying, son?

462
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,909
You? - How do you know my son?
- Why are you asking him? Ask me.

463
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,032
This is my friend
Ashok"s elder brother.

464
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,312
l understood why Ashok couldn"t..

465
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,000
..get the money on time
during the examination admission.

466
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,479
Sir. l.. l will leave now.

467
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,038
Daddy. You hold a
big post in the office.

468
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,832
The government pays you one
thousand rupees every month.

469
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,317
Then why are you making us eat
bread of sin by taking bribes..

470
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,793
..from a common clerk
who earns one fifty rupees?

471
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,071
Whatever l am doing,
l am doing it for my children.

472
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,869
You are a child now.
You are immature.

473
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,554
You won"t be able understand
the ways of the world as yet.

474
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,195
You are right dad.
l am a child. l am immature.

475
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,309
Therefore, l couldn"t
understand till date..

476
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,318
..that the perks and leisure
we stay in the foundation..

477
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,955
..of that is placed on
the bones of the poor.

478
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,115
Kishore.

479
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,634
l see that you have learnt
rebellion staying with others.

480
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,679
Just think. What
happens in one thousand?

481
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,435
Your fees. The family dues.
Shobha"s studies.

482
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,709
The petty expenses to
stay in society.

483
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,872
Money is needed for all
these things at every step.

484
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,479
All these are your needs, dad.

485
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,318
But who will understand his needs..

486
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,829
..whose salary is just
one hundred and fifty?

487
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,876
Who has to feed his
family twice in a day.

488
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,389
Who has to pay the rent for his
house and make his brother study.

489
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,114
l had come to give you the
good news of my passing.

490
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,714
l am repenting now.

491
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,076
l have studied due to
the money earned in sin.

492
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,672
Fie on such studies!
l spit on such a degree.

493
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,468
Which has been achieved by
the sighs of someone poor.

494
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,591
What is the matter?

495
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,751
why are there loud noises in the
house on such a joyous occasion?

496
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,438
You heard the noise. Mother.

497
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,478
But listen to what has been
going on the house silently too.

498
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,598
Daddy has been teaching me by
taking bribes from poor clerks.

499
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,959
You tell me. Will such an
education be of any use to me?

500
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,116
Will l be able to show my
degree to anyone proudly?

501
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,791
Son.. please don"t be angry.
- l won"t leave my anger, mother.

502
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,789
l will surely leave
this house though.

503
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,433
Brother..

504
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,469
Shobha. You know what
our father is up to.

505
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,473
He has dealt in other"s
helplessness and become rich.

506
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,318
l won"t stay in that house..

507
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,318
..which has the stink of bribes,
greed and tyranny..

508
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,874
..in it"s leisures and perks,

509
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,395
That"s enough. There is a
limit for gibberish too.

510
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,638
Mother.. l am going.

511
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,988
lf you wish, you can
come with Shobha and me.

512
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,795
l will work hard and
feed the two of you.

513
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,512
Brother. Why are you so adamant?

514
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,313
lf Daddy has committed any mistake..

515
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,908
..why are you giving him
such a huge punishment for it?

516
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,110
l"m punishing myself not him.

517
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,038
Now, even the walls of
this house come to bite me.

518
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,950
l feel like choking in
the air of this house.

519
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,391
l don"t care and nor am l
related to dad"s wealth.

520
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,199
Kishore! Kishore, my son!

521
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,954
Brother! - Kishore! - Brother,
please don"t do like this.

522
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,433
Nobody can stop me now.

523
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,470
Even drinking the water of
this house is a sin for me now.

524
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,628
l am taking these trophies with me.

525
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,510
This is the earning of my
hard work and my brains.

526
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,991
There is no place for
such earnings in this house.

527
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,797
Kishore..

528
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,713
Kishore, please stop.
- Brother, please stop.

529
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,675
Mother.

530
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,715
Did you see, dear?

531
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,755
The greed for wealth has
shown us this day today.

532
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,718
lt is good in a way, mother.

533
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,310
When Kishore isn"t here, dad will..

534
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,318
..come to know that
the earnings of..

535
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,876
..sin cannot buy the
happiness of a child.

536
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,035
Shobha.

537
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,951
Save me! Help me! Thief! Thief!
- Shut up! Shut up! - Thief! Thief!

538
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,836
l will kill you! l will kill you!

539
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,032
Thief! Thief! Thief!

540
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,912
Aren"t you ashamed to
do such a bad thing?

541
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,434
Aren"t you scared of God?

542
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,918
Dear.. Dear..

543
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,314
What happened? what happened?

544
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,510
That thief was trying to
snatch this chain from my neck.

545
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,312
This uncle drove him away.

546
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,158
Come on. Ask for
uncle"s blessings. Come on

547
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,919
Okay, brother. We will leave now.

548
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,429
May God look after you.

549
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,588
Hey, my suitcase?

550
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,678
Are you mad that you
are laughing at my loss?

551
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,472
Not me. You are mad to put
your hand in a stranger"s fire.

552
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,637
So, is it a sin to do
good to someone?

553
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,198
When you will understand this,
you will become a big man.

554
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,156
You fool. This is the new world.

555
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,671
The one who walks on the right path..

556
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,951
..he doesn"t get the path.

557
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,317
And the one who
walks on the wrong path..

558
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,635
..the destination itself
comes to him.

559
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,957
lt is someone"s money
and someone"s miracle.

560
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,757
Ashok, you?
- My friend, your bag.

561
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,475
Did you steal it?

562
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,630
Go! l am not some ordinary, common..
- Useless. - Useless..

563
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,716
..thief. See, he was
taking this bag away.

564
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,319
As soon as l saw it, l understood
it immediately that this..

565
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,192
.. suit case belongs to my
truthful friend and nobody else.

566
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,034
Hey, You"d gone home isn"t it?
Why did you come back?

567
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,797
l had to leave it forcibly.
- Okay. Come with me.

568
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,991
Where? - l am not taking
you to an orphanage.

569
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,475
l am taking you to my house,
Royal Palace. Come!

570
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,913
And such a house that
there"s everything here!

571
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,189
Look, Look.

572
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,194
Hey. This is a very good house.

573
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,795
From where did you get all this?

574
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,955
God gives one
whatever he wants after all.

575
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,308
lf he wants sugar,
he gives him sugar.

576
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,670
You tell me. Why did
you come to Bombay?

577
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,192
Ashok. l have left my
house and come here.

578
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,192
Hey! Have you decided to
leave all material wealth?

579
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,798
Not leaving material wealth.
l am looking for a job.

580
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,189
l fought with father.

581
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,955
Afight? An honest and
innocent person like you fought?

582
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,798
And that to with his father?

583
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,555
Ashok. l saw the true
colors of my father.

584
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,398
He used to take bribes from
poor people and fill his coffers.

585
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,398
And on top of that, he
didn"t even spare your brother.

586
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,318
Wonderful! Your father is
really fit to be revered!

587
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,034
His principles and mine meet.

588
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,152
Even he thinks that if the
world can be fooled, it should be.

589
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,197
My friend, we two great..
- People.

590
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,192
We two should be able
to teach you something.

591
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,795
See. Keep your results to yourself.

592
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,317
The enjoyment that exists in
the starvation of a good man..

593
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,509
..doesn"t exist in the
buffet of a bad man.

594
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,756
lt seems that you have
become a sage permanently.

595
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,792
"Hail Shyam! Hail Ghanshyam!"

596
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,036
What is it?
- "Hail Shyam! Hail Ghanshyam!"

597
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,832
Forget the hymns and come to den.

598
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,638
ls it something special?
- Obviously.

599
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,316
But this person"s face
seems to be new and matters..

600
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,874
..of business aren"t
discussed in everyone"s presence.

601
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,514
Look, Kishore. Don"t go
anywhere till the time l return.

602
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,675
lt"s your own house.

603
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,677
There is beer in the
fridge and whiskey in the bar.

604
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,189
lf you want to succeed in life,
both are necessary.

605
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,877
And if not, drink cold
water and sleep on the Dunlop.

606
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,195
lsn"t it? Come on. This
much is enough for you, okay?

607
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:51,756
"l have held this bottle
of alcohol since so long."

608
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:01,394
"l have held this bottle
of alcohol since so long."

609
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,991
"Come on, drink it. lt has.."

610
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,958
"Come on, drink it. lt has.."

611
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,719
"..it has the nights
of beauty in it."

612
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,593
"Come on, drink it. lt has.."

613
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,439
"Come on, drink it. lt has.."

614
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,994
"..it has the nights
of beauty in it."

615
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,314
"The bottle of liquor is lying
in front of you since long."

616
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,118
"The bottle of liquor is lying
in front of you since long."

617
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,198
"..it has the nights
of beauty in it."

618
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,709
""Come drink, it has..""

619
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,312
""The nights of beauty in it,
come drink it has..""

620
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,753
""Come drink it has..
The nights of beauty in it..""

621
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:43,193
"Floating in the sea today
is the shadow of beauty."

622
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:55,638
"The drunkard turned today
the path of the moonlight."

623
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,635
""Of the moonlight..""

624
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,514
"Come and sit in the
shadow of my hair for a while."

625
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,839
"You will have the
enjoyment of beauty."

626
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,954
"Come and sit in the
shadow of my hair for a while."

627
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,309
"You will have the
enjoyment of beauty."

628
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,673
"Oh, butler, the surrounding.."

629
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,917
"..here is so sad."

630
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:54,193
"l have come thinking
that the wine shop is near."

631
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,470
""The wine shop is near..""

632
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,309
"l have kept that
one drink for you."

633
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,390
"ln which is kept the sweetness
of my beautiful lips."

634
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,719
"l have kept that one drink for you."

635
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,709
"ln which is kept the
sweetness of my beautiful lips."

636
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,632

637
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,392
"The bottle of liquor is lying

638
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,398
""Come, drink, it has..""

""Come, drink, it has the
nights of beauty in it..""

642
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:34,396
"Everything in this
life is unfaithful."

643
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:45,510
""lt is not trustworthy.""

644
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,031
"lt is not trustworthy."

645
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,789
"You came in the wine shop,
forgetting the world."

646
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,835
"This one moment is so lucky for us."

647
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,995
"You came in the wine shop,
forgetting the world."

648
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,070
"This one moment is so lucky for us."

649

651
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,512
""Come, drink, it has..""

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,710
""Come, drink, it has..""

653
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,308

""The nights of beauty in it..""

657
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,398
Ashok. l am very happy today.

658
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,115
You put a nice show and
better scapegoats too.

659
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,990
Here. This is your account.

660
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,473
Twenty five percent,
five hundred rupees.

661
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,513
And this is yours.
- Wow! That"s great!

662
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,916
Boss, today such a
ready scapegoat came.

663
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,632
All his pockets were full.

664
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:28,393
And Ashok cut the goat such!
We cut him such, we flayed him!

665
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,192
He didn"t even have a
single penny with him.

666
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,317
l think that if he goes
out to the crossroad..

667
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,193
..he will have to beg
for alms to go home.

668
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,115
very good! very good!

669
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,390
Look. l am going, tell sir.

670
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,990
lt is someone"s money
and someone"s miracle.

671
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,394
Hey, Kishore! Where are you going?

672
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,033
Give the cobbler
your suit measurement.

673
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,878
Then give the tailor
your show measurement.

674
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,192
They will understand it
between themselves. - For what?

675
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,631
To make you a man, my friend.

676
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,194
lf you wish to stay with us,
we need this fire.

677
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,876
This old quality trousers and
old shirt won"t do. - Take this.

678
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,398
You keep this pride of credit.

679
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,919
What is the matter of
credit in this?

680
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,192
You helped me so
much in my college days.

681
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,955
l just brought some clothes for you.
What is bad in that? Take it.

682
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,318
Ashok. l won"t wear
clothes with which..

683
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,637
..the body will be covered,
but the soul be stripped naked.

684
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,312
l saw everything in the Carnival..

685
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,714
..and understood everything.

686
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,592
Your lifestyle is the result
of conning, gambling and lies.

687
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,393
Conning and lying is an art.

688
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,476
Brains are needed to understand that.

689
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,639
Art! very good! Such
good thoughts in this era!

690
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,469
Tailor and cobbler.
You search for another house.

691
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,830
The story here has
lengthened a bit, isn"t it?

692
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,673
Come on. Have your food.

693
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,077
l won"t have the food.
- Why?

694
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,558
Food earned by sin doesn"t
become blood after going inside.

695
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,715
lt becomes poison!

696
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,479
Which party is he a member of?
- Go away from here.

697
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,194
You say that the food of a
friend"s house is poison?

698
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,514
This isn"t a good thing.
Come on, eat the food.

699
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,312
lf l had to eat food
like this, l wouldn"t..

700
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,396
..have left my parents
and my sister.

701
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,317
Please don"t be so adamant.
l won"t let you go hungry..

702
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,919
..from my house.
For the sake of our friendship!

703
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,917
We don"t have any
friendship or relation from today.

704
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,479
Kishore.. Kishore.. Kishore..

705
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,594
Kishore. My friend!
Please listen to me!

706
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,512
How did you say that we
don"t have any relation?

707
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,193
lf not love, let it be hatred.

708
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,033
But how can you break the
relation of so many years?

709
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,752
For God"s sake,
please don"t follow me.

710
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,795
l don"t want to turn back and
see from the path that l walk on.

711
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,878
Don"t turn back, my friend. But
how can you finish friendship?

712
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,399
l agree that we think differently.

713
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,309
But in a thunderstorm..

714
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,479
..if moving on a single raft
if a sage and a snake can..

715
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,636
Adjust. -..then why
can"t we two do it?

716
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,595
lf only you be as good
a person as you argue.

717
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,475
l am bad.

718
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,310
But l am better than
those good people..

719
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,510
..who call themselves good
and think bad for others.

720
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,195
My friend.. You have
left your house.

721
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,395
Neither do you have a job,
nor a place to stay.

722
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,319
l ask you. lf you leave me,
will you..

723
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,396
..make a bed out of
truth and sleep on that?

724
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,715
My friend.

725
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,317
Goodness isn"t a vitamin pill..

726
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,793
..with which you will
wipe away your hunger.

727
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,157
At the most, l will
die of hunger, isn"t it?

728
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,072
But l am ready for that too.
- You fool!

729
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,318
Life is inviting you with
her open embrace and you..

730
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,590
You wish to sleep
in the lap of death?

731
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,752
What you think to be life, Ashok..

732
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,313
..in my eyes, it isn"t life,
but worse than death.

733
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,317
l know that the journey of
good and truth is very long.

734
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,877
But just how travelers
cover thousands of miles..

735
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,399
..and reach the place of worship..

736
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,318
..and take the
blessings of God and forget..

737
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,032
..all the sorrows of their journey.

738
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,078
There will surely be
such a day, Ashok.

739
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:02,198
l will become a big man in
the world due to my goodness.

740
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,392
And God forbid, you may be
eating the food of the police.

741
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,829
lt may be possible
that this is upturned.

742
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,791
There is a lot of strength in money.

743
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,559
lt can buy man"s religion,
conscience, everything.

744
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,317
What if one day, this
society becomes my slave..

745
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,192
..and then you..

746
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,310
You may be taking your empty
bundle of good and truth..

747
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,318
..moving in the unknown
darkness of being unknown..

748
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,115
..may God forbid, ebbing
in the pond of your tears.

749
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,391
This isn"t possible.
- Why? Why isn"t it possible?

750
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,074
very good, Ashok.

751
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,750
You walk on your path.
l will walk on my path.

752
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,319
l will bet for three years.

753
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,670
You walk on your
principles for three years.

754
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,668
And l will walk on my principles.

755
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,113
We will meet each other
under this great soul"s shadow.

756
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,149
And we will see what
you are and what l am.

757
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,839
Agreed, my friend.

758
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,318
But will you be able
to hold the wounds..

759
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,318
..of this fake world, without
the support of your friend..

760
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,159
..with the support of only
your truth, for three years?

761
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,116
Truth is such a twig, Ashok
that can cross an ocean too.

762
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,032
And bad is a bad scare.

763
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,874
lt can"t face even one
fell swoop of thunder.

764
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,197
That will be known. Do you bet?

765
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,557
Three years from now.
- Three years from now.

766
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,638
This same place.
- This same place.

767
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,480
This time.
- This time.

768
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:33,753
This time.
- This time.

769
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,394
"May you have the thorns of truth."

770
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,715
"l will have the
flowers of falsehood."

771
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,195
"l will take that path which
will have colors on every step."

772
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,759
""Colours at every step.""

773
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:02,193
"There are a lakh
paths for falsehood.."

774
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,070
"..but there is just one
destination for truth."

775
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,194
"The one who fears God, all
his problems are cleared off."

776
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,475
"Oh Friend!

777
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,955
"Oh friend!"

778
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,070
"Oh friend, l have seen the world."

779
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,754
l have seen it properly
with my eyes."

780
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,034
"lt is difficult to realise."
- "Who is good and bad here."

781
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,029
"l have seen it
properly with my eyes."

782
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,392
"l have seen it
properly with my eyes."

783
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,312
"l have seen it
properly with my eyes."

784
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:57,191
"l have seen it
properly with my eyes."

785
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,637
Sir. l wish to see the
carnival one day too.

786
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,389
You see my face everyday.
Am l anything less than the carnival?

787
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,479
What happened, Chaman?
What happened to you, Chaman?

788
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,600
What happened? Did you mother die?

789
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,310
My mother died even before
l was born.

790
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,829
Then did you come from the sky?
Why are you crying?

791
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,552
l am crying for the dancer
who ran away with her brother.

792
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,429
Are you mad?

793
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,391
Does a girl run away
with her brother?

794
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,034
Neither have l become mad
and nor you.

795
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,309
l have found out that one of her..

796
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,590
..brothers is a very
big thief and dacoit.

797
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,633
The two of them met and stole
all the wealth of the carnival.

798
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,512
l came here with
whatever was left here.

799
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,640
Hold me! Or l will die! You twigs!

800
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,636
First you were crying
for the dancer. Why now?.

801
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,035
l am crying for the
owner of the carnival.

802
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,311
When he came to know that the
dancer has washed him away..

803
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,477
..he has dried clean all of us.
- What are you saying?

804
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,079
l am telling you the truth.

805
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,509
The carnival owner was
the father of the dancer!

806
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,677
He ran away inside the night
without giving anyone anything.

807
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,395
The tent owners are searching
for us with knives and daggers.

808
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,789
Okay. - Run away from here.
- very good! Wonderful idea!

809
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,310
What an idea!
lt is better for brave people..

810
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,670
..like us to escape
from the back door.

811
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,314
We will run away from
here somewhere..

812
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,715
..make the carnival.
The maidens are with us.

813
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,638
And they have..
- Wealth.

814
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,991
Someone"s money, someone"s miracle.

815
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,914
You are troubling yourself
and me needlessly, lnspector.

816
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,189
l am not a smuggler.

817
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,998
l am just a
superintendent of an office.

818
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,317
We have proper proof that you
have generated a large amount..

819
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,194
..of black money
by accepting bribes.

820
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,192
Look at this, sir.
So much gold and money!

821
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,318
What? Tell me! From where did
an superintendent of the office..

822
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,352
..get so much gold and money?
- lnspector..

823
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,192
This is not my personal apartment.

824
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,952
l am a tenant. lt is possible
that landlord has hidden it here.

825
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,958
lt is a very good excuse.
But it is very weak.

826
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,475
lt won"t work.

827
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,717
All l know is that truth
doesn"t need any shelter.

828
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,159
The decider is the almighty.

829
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,715
The almighty decides
after our death.

830
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,116
lt is here that the
decisions are taken as we live.

831
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,556
Apply the handcuffs!
- Mother!

832
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,592
Have mercy! Please have mercy!

833
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,351
Our respect of the house
will be thrust in the dust!

834
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,675
l have a young daughter.

835
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,075
There will be a hundred
obstacles in her marriage.

836
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,194
l am sorry. l sympathise with you.

837
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,838
But l am the servant
of the law. Come on.

838
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,475
Please come on.

839
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,992
Are you going to prison?

840
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,032
So what? Big leaders
have gone to prison.

841
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,398
Mother! Brace yourself, mother.
Brace yourself.

842
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,396
Daddy"s deeds bore fruits for him.

843
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,390
What will be done by your cries now?.

844
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,595
Our happy family is burnt!

845
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,308
lf Kishore would have
been here at this time..

846
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,158
..there would be some
kind of support.

847
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,397
For us, all the paths of
the world have closed down.

848
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,631
Mother.. So what if the paths
of the world have closed down?

849
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,472
The door to God is still open.

850
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,038
See, mother. l set
everything on it"s place.

851
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,396
Dear. We left the
house and the city too.

852
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,991
Why should we
decorate strange walls now?.

853
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,675
Mother. You have tied
sorrow to your breast.

854
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,830
We will have to stay in the
color that he keeps us in.

855
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,715
Yes, dear. We will have
to live till we breathe.

856
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,516
Dear.. What kind of life is this?

857
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,192
There is ration for
a few days at home.

858
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,953
And there is only darkness ahead.

859
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,993
Mother. Please don"t worry.
l have learnt dancing.

860
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,031
l will do any job in
a dance academy.

861
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,751
l am not rotten that
l cannot feed two people.

862
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,195
The burden that my son had to lift..

863
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,314
..my daughter is lifting it today.

864
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,512
Mother. You have started
crying again.

865
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,674
We cannot smash our heads
against the walls of fate!

866
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,829
This wall can be broken
by patience and change.

867
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,594
lf God wishes, we will meet
brother Kishore somewhere.

868
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,194
lf we were fated such, why
would be leave the house?

869
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,320
lf your dad had listened to him..

870
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,396
..we wouldn"t have to see this day.

871
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,320
Forget it, mother.
lf man didn"t take birth..

872
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,194
..there wouldn"t be the
problems of joy and sorrow.

873
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,831
New lndia Dance academy.

874
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,995
"The heat of Love."

875
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,111
"The tracks of the train."

876
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,349
You know that we are
making three films.

877
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,199
There are six heroines
in each movie.

878
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,556
That means, there are
chances for eighteen heroines.

879
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,796
You can"t be compared at all!

880
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,390
You will be a top
heroine for the movie 007!

881
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,034
Please stand up.
The height is good too.

882
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,792
Have a seat. You are the
best for a Muslim social movie.

883
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,114
You have chances..

884
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,789
Why did you come? Are
you dreaming of films too?

885
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,593
No. She is my mummy.
- Mummy..

886
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,312
That means, an obstacle in progress.

887
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,319
lf you wish to
progress in the film line..

888
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,714
..you will have to keep
your mummy with your daddy.

889
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,911
Greetings.
- Greetings.

890
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,311
Hey! lf simple girls like
you come in the film line..

891
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,796
..all the accounts of
the film world will change.

892
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,114
Chaman!
- l am coming.

893
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,911
There is spring everywhere.
There are lot of spices outside.

894
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,395
But the whole program
should be cleared by evening.

895
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,317
Because in the morning,
the landlord..

896
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,317
..the furniture man,
the fake jewelry man..

897
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,032
..the laundry man..
- And the policeman.

898
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,833
We should do this quickly.
You are ready, isn"t it?

899
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,995
l am ready.
- That is good.

900
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,031
Should l call them one by
one or the whole lot together?

901
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,388
One by one. Sit on the chair then.

902
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,555
You are the producer.

903
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,875
The producer will have to
stand till the movie is done.

904
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,355
Hold the telephone. Number one!

905
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,035
Please come.

906
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,638
What a gait!
By God, it is so fragile!

907
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,991
Please meet him.
Look at her nicely.

908
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,636
Look at her closely.
Every organ of her body is a poem!

909
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,318
She is a top heroine for our..

910
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,193
..first production,
"The tracks of the train."

911
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,669

Kumar. very good!

01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,029
There are many boys with
his name in the film line.

915
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,991
But you are the first girl.

916
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,395
Think that you have
become a heroine!

917
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,953
Really?
- Really.

918
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,308
lf our sir sees someone with love..

919
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,193
..think that she is
already a heroine.

920
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,909
Should l make her sit on the chair?
- Come.

921
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,031
You have brought the
hundred rupees as fees, isn"t it?

Yes.
- Yes. Please have a seat.

But tell me. ls money taken
to work here, or it is given?

925
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,797
Which circles of taking and
giving are you moving about?

926
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,912
These hundred rupees are for
the photos and all that. - l see.

927
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,792
Your meter will
start after the contract.

928
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,512
How many lakhs..
- Give a pose..

929
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,395
Not romantic, tragedy pose,
of a solemn hymn.

930
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,151
lt"s done. Come on! Come on!
- Please take care of me.

931
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,589
We will take care of you.
- Please give me a chance.

932
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,314
Yes. We will give
you a chance. Yes, yes.

933
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,192
Bye-bye.

934
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,749
lt is a good start.

935
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,720
The ram number two, l mean the
sheep number two, please come.

936
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,795
Greetings.

937
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,559
Your name?
- Shobha.

938
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,636
Do you know any dancing and singing?
- Yes.

939
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,320
l"d learnt all kinds of
classical dances at home.

940
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,950
Manipuri, Kathakali,
Bharatnatyam (dance forms)..

941
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,998
l have completed studying all these.

942
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,954
You seem to be from a good family.

943
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,910
Won"t your family members
have mind you working in films?

944
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,996
They used to mind sometime.

945
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,391
But now, the situation
in the house is not good.

946
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,511
Therefore..
- l understand.

947
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,311
Look.. lf you give me
a job in your company..

948
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,319
..l assure you, l will bring
glory to your company"s name.

949
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,953
Even we have that hope of you.

950
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,352
The fees for admission
in our dance academy..

951
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,398
..is just a hundred rupees.
- Hundred rupees?

952
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,393
l don"t have hundred rupees.

953
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,910
The bangles in your hands will
surely be for hundred rupees.

954
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,035
Here you are.

955
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,948
They are real, aren"t they?
- They are real. But..

956
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,992
l should get the job.
- That is the matter of the talent.

957
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,192
lf you move into our..
- Thoughts.

958
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,158
You will surely be a heroine.

01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,399
Greetings.
- Greetings.

960
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,556
Tomorrow morning. Okay? Go.

961
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,956
Friend, the girl seems to be a cow.

962
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,877
ln our business,
cows, sheep and goats.

963
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,833
All are one and the same.

964
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,795
lt is good that we earned something.

965
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,955
Tell me, Kishore.

966
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,308
Are you still singing
about good and truth..

967
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,670
..or did you learn
something about the world too?

968
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,668
Where have l learnt it till now?.

969
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,678
Okay. Tell me. Who
gave you my address?

970
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,390
l came looking at the board of
such a huge store for a job.

971
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,558
l didn"t know that you
were the owner of this store.

972
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,513
You can become the
manager of some orphanage.

973
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,918
You aren"t able for
a job of some firm.

974
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,558
You have to lie at
every step in business.

975
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,873
l am asking you for a job.

976
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,638
And you are teaching me
the ways of the world.

977
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,957
The fact is..
l cannot give you a job.

978
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,397
My business is very new and..

979
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,518
Do one thing, Shekhar.
- What?

980
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,035
Keep this with you.

981
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,032
And give me a hundred
rupees or so to fight life.

982
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,476
what do you think l am?

983
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,912
Can"t l give my college friend a
hundred rupees just like that?

984
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,440
Don"t make me a beggar.
- A beggar?

985
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:05,757
l am making you a guest.
Here. Take this hundred rupees.

986
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,949
And have some food first.

987
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,639
lt seems that you are
hungry since four days.

988
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,873
Not four days. l am
hungry since two days.

989
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,319
Take this. Go.
- Keep this bag.

990
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,752
Boss. Which note did you give him?

991
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,399
The same one.
- The same one.

992
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,709
lf this note works, our
hard work will bear fruit.

993
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,710
We can do a lot of
work with this man.

994
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,593
Conman! Betrayers! They say
something and do something.

995
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,518
A loss of two
hundred rupees in one day.

996
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,918
Raju! Keep this carefully.
- There was a film company here.

997
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,315
l am tired of giving an
answer to anyone who comes here.

998
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,556
l don"t know what the
boys and girls today think.

999
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,308
l didn"t understand what you say.

1000
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,953
l don"t have the need
to explain it to you.

1001
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,559
There isn"t any film company here.

1002
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,318
Thieves, dacoits and looters have..

1003
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,317
..looted the money of boys and
girls and ran away from here.

1004
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,668
They fooled us too!

1005
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,116
Give me one plate.
- A hundred rupees note!

1006
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,671
l don"t have change. Take
the token and have food.

1007
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,675
Take change later.

1008
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,476
Why are you starting like a machine?

1009
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,715
The plate is ours as
well as the stomach is.

1010
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,029
l am very hungry.

1011
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,955
l have met the God of
food after two days today.

1012
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,674
Are you hungry since two days?
Are you unemployed?

1013
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,873
Think it to be such.
- Mister!

1014
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,036
This fake note will not work.
- Fake note? What do you mean?

1015
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,390
No meanings! Take out another note.

1016
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,395
This is the only one l had.

1017
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,555
Where should l bring
another one from?

1018
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,796
Then wash your hands and
come to the police with me.

1019
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,471
Why do you clutch the hand
of someone who is eating food?

1020
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,636
Have l opened an
open house for conmen?

1021
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,355
why are you shouting?
Show me the note.

1022
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,399
Go. Sit on the counter. - Okay.
But you are responsible for it.

1023
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,909
Yes!
- They come to eat for free!

1024
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,315
Eat nicely. But from
where did you bring this..

1025
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,035
..hundred rupees note
while you are unemployed?

1026
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,508
There is a store nearby,
Truthful Agencies.

1027
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,473
His owner is my friend.
l took it on credit from him.

1028
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,193
lt doesn"t matter. Eat.

1029
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,196
Who says that it is a fake note?
This is a real note.

1030
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,558
l will make the
hotel owner understand.

1031
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,559
This will be your good deed to me.

1032
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,398
Otherwise, l would
be hungry today too.

1033
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,988
Who can stay hungry when l am here?

1034
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,956
What is bad in this note?
- Has it changed?

1035
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,036
Hey! You change the
number of the glasses.

1036
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,312
Come on. Give me the change.
- Should l cut your money too?

1037
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,555
Do you want to go up so soon?

1038
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,032
Here, brother. The rest of the money.

1039
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,558
Thank you, very much.
Can l know your name?

1040
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,752
l tell my name only to the police,
not to the people.

1041
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,718
What has this world come to?

1042
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,398
Even if a friend helps a
friend it is by a fake note.

1043
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,159
A proper man becomes a criminal.

1044
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,599
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1045
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,955
Why did you come here, dear?
- l"m looking for job.

1046
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,511
There isn"t any special vacancy here.

1047
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,311
Ebb of hope rushed through me
looking at your dance academy.

1048
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,196
l thought that l would
get some support here.

1049
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,475
Support?

1050
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,558
Yes. All responsibilities
of the house are on me.

1051
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,190
For my mother, l am the only support.

1052
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,469
ls it so? What do you know, dear?

1053
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,749
l have learned the art of dancing.

1054
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,316
l know every kind of classical dance.

1055
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,192
lf you wish, you can give me
a chance to teach your girls.

1056
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,638
l will be very grateful to you.

1057
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,159
Please don"t be disappointed, dear.

1058
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,674
l can give you a job
as a dance teacher.

1059
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,396
But you will have to work very hard.

1060
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,398
l am not scared of hard work.

1061
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,792
l am just scared of unemployment.

1062
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,194
You aren"t unemployed any longer.

1063
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,396
Start your work from today itself.

1064
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,195
Thank you.

1065
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,038
Why were you so late in your lunch?

1066
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,316
Your city is a strange one, Shekhar.

1067
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,475
Why? What is the matter?

1068
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,319
People don"t know difference
between a real and a fake note.

1069
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,477
Didn"t you get change
for a hundred rupees?

1070
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,114
- l got the change. - Why
has your face fallen then?

1071
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,555
But l got food with insults.
- How?.

1072
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,316
You knew that l was
hungry since two days.

1073
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,238
When l sat on the
table and started eating..

1074
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,430
..the counter person
started shouting at me.

1075
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,310
This note is a fake! l was stunned.

1076
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,238
A honest man meddled in between..

1077
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,430
..and told him to see carefully,
the note was real.

1078
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,399
After that, the counter
person apologized to me.

1079
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,115
Here is the rest of the change.

1080
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,829
Why are you embarrassing me?

1081
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,872
Will you move in such
a huge city all alone?

1082
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,115
Keep it. Keep it with you.

1083
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,713
We have got a trunk call from Agra.

1084
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,239
We have to reach the money
to the factory at this time.

1085
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,635
Okay. Take my car and go to
the factory with the money.

1086
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,230
l have a police
commissioner"s party at my place.

1087
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,238
So, whom should l send
such a huge amount with?

1088
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,633
Kishore, will you do
something for me?

1089
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,435
Tell me. - l have to reach a
lakh of rupees to Agra right now.

1090
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,635
l cannot trust any stranger.
Therefore, l tell you.

1091
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,635
Take my car and
reach this money there.

1092
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,035
l am scared, Shekhar. What if
something happens on the way?

1093
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,628
Hey! You are the worshiper of truth!

1094
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,035
Why does truth need any proof?

1095
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,311
Give me the bag. Take this.

1096
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,639
Here are the keys to
my car. Best of luck.

1097
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,796
Here. Share it amongst yourselves.

1098
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,557
They wish to have fun
with their friend"s wife.

1099
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,629
Brother! Will you search a thief,
rogue or pickpocket for me?

1100
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
l am a thief, rogue and pickpocket.

1101
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,316
But l have only one ambition.

1102
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,958
l should give your
hand in someone"s hand..

1103
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,237
..who does hard work and labor..

1104
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,316
..and earns money from
that and lives.

1105
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:42,233
l met a very good and
innocent boy in the restaurant.

1106
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,475
l felt like catching him
and bringing him home.

1107
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,955
But l was ashamed of myself.

1108
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,793
This business is something
like this.

1109
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,035
Come on! Follow him!

1110
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,397
Thief! Brother! Thief!

1111
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,397
That"s strange. A
thief in a thief"s house?

1112
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,476
See, brother! Thief!
- See..

1113
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,390
You? But through this window..

1114
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,476
See, some hoodlums are following me.

1115
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,035
l have a lot of money.
lt is someone"s money.

1116
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,554
Please hide them.

1117
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,239
Did you see that, l was speaking..

1118
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,318
..to you about this boy.
Come with me.

1119
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,318
Sit down. Show me the notes.

1120
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,319
These notes are fake.
- Fake?

1121
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,229
Who gave it to you?

1122
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,877
The same one who gave me
the hundred rupee note.

1123
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,799
That note was fake too.
- What? - Yes.

1124
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,113
This is the note from the morning.

1125
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,876
l had changed it with my real note.

1126
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,239
Because l had seen
innocence and honesty in your face.

1127
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,638
And the people who are
following you..

1128
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,797
..aren"t hoodlums,
they are the police.

1129
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,038
Police? What will l do now?.

1130
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,796
What will happen? Anyone
must have printed the notes.

1131
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,789
But they are with you now.
You will be caught.

1132
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,557
And do you know what is the
punishment for printing notes?

1133
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,638
Seven years.
- Prison?

1134
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,876
Punishment, for me?

1135
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,954
l think that even looking
at someone"s money is bad.

1136
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,715
God! l have been
stuck in such a problem.

1137
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,395
Open the door.

1138
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,955
Police.

1139
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,558
Don"t worry. You hide here.

1140
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,310
Hide here? Why should l?
l didn"t commit any crime!

1141
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,477
l will prove to them that
l didn"t print these notes.

1142
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,032
l will go to the police
and tell them everything.

1143
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,114
Don"t be a fool.

1144
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,115
You will become old in prison
while proving your innocence.

1145
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,111
But it"s possible you
won"t be heard even then.

1146
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,237
You haven"t dealt
with the police as yet.

1147
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,238
Give me. Give me this bag.
- No. How is this possible?

1148
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,308
Someone does and someone pays?
- Don"t talk foolishly.

1149
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,558
lt is one and the same for me
to go to prison or on the bus.

1150
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,796
Open the door!
- But promise me one thing.

1151
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,033
You will take care of my
sister Meena after l have gone.

1152
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,955
Please don"t worry.

1153
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,115
Open the door!

1154
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,477
No, brother! What are you doing!

1155
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,239
Please don"t worry. The
police is my old friend.

1156
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,478
Brother! - Open the door,
or else, l will break it!

1157
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,550
lnspector! - Who came in
this house climbing the wall?

1158
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,717
The door was closed.
l came through the window.

1159
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:44,119
You? what is there in this box?
- For what you have come.

1160
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,115
Oh! Fake notes. So our
suspicion was correct.

1161
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,474
My hands are here.

1162
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,874
l have worn this
bondage so many times..

1163
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,310
..and removed it so many times.
- Take him away!

1164
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,720
Wait. Please close the door.

1165
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,558
lf it is open, the
thieves come inside.

1166
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,549
ln this world, friends
become enemies.

1167
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,228
And a stranger leaves
the freedom for someone..

1168
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,875
..and takes the
choking air of the prison.

1169
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:37,880
l have seen this world now.
l have understood it now.

1170
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,113
l will see that Shekhar now!

1171
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,311
Come. l will lay out
the food for you.

1172
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,555
ln the happiness that
l sent your brother to prison?

1173
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:52,229
No. Because for the
first time a good man..

1174
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,239
..has stepped inside
the four walls of sin.

1175
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,033
No. l am not good.

1176
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,709
The one who has gone
to prison is good.

1177
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,237
You stay here. l will come quickly.

1178
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,476
Police! A raid! What are you saying?

1179
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,878
Did you find me to be put in danger?

1180
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,036
You were a boy from a
good and comfortable house.

1181
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,399
Why do you wish to print fake
notes and become rich overnight?

1182
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,555
This is rubbish.

1183
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,875
My notes were real. You
must have changed them.

1184
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,115
Kishore. You"d come
starving and naked from home.

1185
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,796
Did you intentions
change when you saw wealth?

1186
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,117
l can give my life for a promise.

1187
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,114
But l cannot even look
at a stranger"s wealth.

1188
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,230
lf you have any humanity
left in you go to the police..

1189
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,033
..and accept the crime
of printing fake notes.

1190
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,032
And have that innocent
Prakash freed.

1191
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,229
Who is this Prakash?

1192
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,873
My sympathiser.
He stays in this city.

1193
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,231
Oh! That rogue of the
first order, Prakash?

1194
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,117
Kishore, otherwise, you sing
tunes of truth and goodness.

1195
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,034
And you make friends
with such common criminals?

1196
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,955
He is my enemy. lt is
good that he is in jail.

1197
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,229
You should be in jail.

1198
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,395
Kishore.

1199
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,556
l am silent due to our
old friendship.

1200
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,238
Otherwise, l can ruin
your life by accusing you..

1201
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,318
..of changing notes and
printing fake currency.

1202
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,555
Shekhar.

1203
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:24,959
The roots of truth are in hell.
You cannot even touch me.

1204
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,115
Get lost from here.

1205
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,396
Or else, your ashes will fly
in the breeze of this city.

1206
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,555
May it be so!

1207
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,955
But before that, you will have
to come with me to the police.

1208
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,798
You will have to accept your crime.

1209
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,117
Come with me!
- l am coming. l am coming.

1210
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,960
Wait! lf you love your life,
go away from here.

1211
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,313
Wait! lf you love your life,
go away from here.

1212
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,238
Shekhar. l won"t listen even..

1213
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,033
..if l have to give
my life for Prakash.

1214
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,229
Kishore.

1215
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,310
What happened?
why are you so scared?

1216
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,319
Tell me! What happened?
What happened?

1217
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,392
l couldn"t even crush an
ant below me in my life.

1218
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,718
But l killed Shekhar
for my safety today.

1219
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,230
Murder! You killed Shekhar!

1220
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,239
The police must be
searching for you then! - No.

1221
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,113
Yes. - Only the dead
and me know this secret.

1222
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,949
How did this happen? How
could l do such a huge sin?

1223
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,034
l will go mad! Meena, l will go mad!

1224
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,475
Brother!

1225
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,954
What happened?
- Did the police release you?

1226
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,038
what will the police release me?
l myself left the police.

1227
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,549
l fooled the police and ran away.

1228
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,033
But Meena, we should go
away from here quickly.

1229
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,559
lt isn"t safe for us to stay
here for even a single moment.

1230
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,874
But where will we go?

1231
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,468
There is such a big world. You two..

1232
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,639
Go there. l will reach there.
- But.. please listen.

1233
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,795
l don"t want to
listen to it now. Later.

1234
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,558
Change your
appearance first. Hurry up.

1235
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,471
Why? whom are you
mourning as the sun sets?

1236
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,957
l just remembered a friend.
- Who is that?

1237
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,117
The same Kishore.
- Okay! That Nekiram Sachaichand?

1238
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,955
He must be starving somewhere.
- God knows what"s his situation.

1239
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,237
See, when we ourselves
are in the thin of things..

1240
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,952
..how can he be in
the thick of things?

1241
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,316
The hundred-rupee note is finished.

1242
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,793
What will we do about
the dinner for night?

1243
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,318
These bangles are left now.

1244
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,239
Give it to me. l will
arrange them quickly.

1245
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,238
Or else. Keeping
stolen things with us..

1246
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,033
..means that wherever we are,
we aren"t far from prison.

1247
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,037
Sell them and make
arrangements to eat and drink.

1248
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,309
And also
arrangements to sleep at night.

1249
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,237
Go quickly. Come quickly.
l am hungry.

1250
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,873
Don"t worry. l will be right back.

1251
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,229
Who knew that the kitchen would..

1252
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:07,471
..ask for fire and the
utensils will ask for grain one day?

1253
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,957
Don"t worry mother. l will
arrange everything. - How?

1254
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,388
We have two silver glasses,
isn"t it?

1255
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,238
l will sell it and
arrange for the ration.

1256
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,113
And then, l will be getting
my salary in a couple of days.

1257
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,952
We will work our lives for
a couple of days like this.

1258
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,390
Yes, dear. Hunger is a huge thing.

1259
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,476
We have to sell everything for this.

1260
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,476
Give it to me. l will sell it.

1261
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,111
lt is time for you to go to work.

1262
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,032
May God give him happiness!

1263
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,112
He took your bangles too!

1264
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,952
What are you looking
at the bangles, sir?

1265
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,479
Look at the one who is selling it.

1266
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,794
lt is made up of real gold.

1267
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,232
Have some patience.
We only deal honestly here.

1268
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,389
Someone"s
helplessness is dealt in, sir.

1269
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,319
Those were the days.

1270
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,957
These bangles would
clink in my wife"s wrists.

1271
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,310
lf only she"d be alive today.

1272
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,036
You"d see that even a fairy
didn"t have such fair arms.

1273
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:15,549
Did your wife expire?
- She did! She did!

1274
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,479
She was from heaven, she went there.

1275
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,229
When you will die, you
will certainly meet her.

1276
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,115
And you will see that l
am really crying for her.

1277
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,308
What is the cost?
- Two hundred and ninety rupees.

1278
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,953
Two hundred and ninety, that"s it?

1279
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,478
You have to show your face
to my wife after your death.

1280
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,114
And she has a say in heaven, sir.

1281
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,794
Raise it a little here.
lt will be helpful there.

1282
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,395
Okay. You make it a
total three hundred.

1283
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,875
l have these two silver glasses.

1284
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,113
Let the gold be sold first.
l will look into silver later.

1285
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,636
Whose bangles are these?
- They are golden bangles.

1286
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,228
Did l ask you
whether your silver glass..

1287
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,395
..is made up of silver or not?

1288
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,033
Then, why do you ask me
whose bangle is this of?

1289
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,116
Sir! These are my bangles!

1290
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,952
They are yours?
- Yes! - He was selling them!

1291
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,038
How can he sell them?
They are my daughter"s!

1292
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,229
This conman snatched these from..

1293
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,237
..my daughter by giving
her the greed of a job.

1294
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,113
Why are you lying in old age and
arranging for a ticket to hell?

1295
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,633
You take out two hundred
and ninety.

1296
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,637
No. Sir! You call
the police quickly.

1297
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,556
Thief! Thief! Catch him!

1298
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,228
Run! run!

1299
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,634
Run!
- What happened?

1300
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,034
We are caught.
- How?.

1301
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,229
That girl"s mother
came to the shop where..

1302
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,557
..l went to sell the bangles.
She recognized the bangles.

1303
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,033
The police are chasing us! Run!

1304
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:35,119
Catch them!
- Thief! Thief! Catch them!

1305
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,956
Catch him!

1306
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,713
""Today..""

1307

"My beloved hasn"t come as yet."

01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,717
"My heart was burning
in the wet monsoon."

1323
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,231
"Your sorrow was ebbing my heart."

1324

"My heart was burning

01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,959
"My beloved hasn"t come as yet."

1342
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:08,638
The hope of my love
is breaking slowly."

1343
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,231
"My beloved hasn"t come as yet."

1344
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,399
"My beloved hasn"t come as yet."

1345
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:17,640
Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him!

1346
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:26,116
Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him!

1347
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,115
Who is this insolent man?

1348
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,310
You! You are the producer
of New lndia Dance Academy..

1349
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,874
l was searching for you.
l was searching for you.

1350
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,877
You have my bangles.
- Your bangles..

1351
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,631
All that was the
handiwork of my partner.

1352
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,399
l spoke a lot to him.
He was a wretch.

1353
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,476
But what can be done? lt is fate.

1354
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,794
l had to come here, so l did.

1355
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,349
lf l wish, l can give you
to the police right now.

1356
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,515
Yes. You can do that.

1357
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,555
But before doing that,
take your bangles.

1358
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,910
You had still kept these bangles?

1359
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,871
See? lf l were a thief,
l would have sold them.

1360
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,229
But l knew that you are
a good woman..

1361
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,238
..and such a thing
shouldn"t happen to you.

1362
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:17,234
Please forgive me.
l misunderstood a good man.

1363
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,109
l committed a huge mistake.

1364
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,440
Sister! Your mother
has met with an accident.

1365
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,749
Sister! Your mother
has met with an accident.

1366
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,029
She is in the hospital.
- Accident!

1367
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,674
Come. Will drop you to the hospital.

1368
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,635
Mother!

1369
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,233
What happened to you, mother?

1370
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,676
Tell me mother,
what happened to you?

1371
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,036
Thank God that she survived.

1372
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,559
lt has been a very serious accident.

1373
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,439
The other wounds will be cured.

1374
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,909
But l am afraid that she
will lose her eyesight.

1375
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,752
Her nerves have already
been ruptured.

1376
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:17,870
What will happen to me,
mother? What will happen to me?

1377
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,753
Dear, have some patience.
What is the use of crying?

1378
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,794
Are you her relative?

1379
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,115
Yes? No. l am not their relative.

1380
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,438
lt will be enough for me
if l can be their sympathiser.

1381
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,113
You care for her too.

1382
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,433
All the problems of the
world are falling on me.

1383
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,074
why is the world joking
with me at every step?

1384
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,595
Fate is never merciless.
Man becomes a devil.

1385
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,038
He fills darkness
for light in his life.

1386
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:04,235
The one who has snatched
your mother"s eyesight..

1387
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,112
..even he was a devil.

1388
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,237
lf God empties this world
from such devils quickly..

1389
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,713
..it is better.

1390
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,551
What right do these
people have to live?

1391
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,075
They set afire to other"s
happiness for their happiness.

1392
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,315
Mother!

1393
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:30,709
""Please forgive my crimes,
please clear my conscience.""

1394
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:38,793
""Please forgive my crimes,
please clear my conscience.""

1395
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:47,915
""Jesus, my God! Oh my almighty!""

1396
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:12,711
""Give me a eye to see
the beauty of life.""

1397
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:21,310
""l have come embarrassed,
give me shelter now.""

1398
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:25,393
""Give me shelter now.""

1399
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:34,230
""Please forgive my crimes,
please clear my conscience.""

1400
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:43,235
""Jesus, my God! Oh my almighty!""

1401
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,673
""Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva.""

1402
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,073
""Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva.""

1403
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,718
""Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. ""

1404
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:17,555
""Take any test, try me
in anyway that you wish.""

1405
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:26,236
""Show me your way in your way now.""

1406
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,558
""Show me your way in your way now.""

1407
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:39,236
""Please forgive my crimes,
please clear my conscience.""

1408
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:48,473
""Jesus, my God! Oh, my almighty!""

1409
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:18,029
""Let me live for others now.
l have lived for myself till now.""

1410
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:22,233
""Let me drink the
blood of my heart.""

1411
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:26,638
""l have drunk the
liquor of happiness now.""

1412
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,719
""l have drunk the
liquor of happiness now.""

1413
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:39,555
""Please forgive my crimes,
please clear my conscience.""

1414
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:48,555
""Jesus, my God! Oh, my almighty!""

1415
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:58,635
""Oh, my almighty! Oh, my almighty!""

1416
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,877
Hard work and labour
is God"s worship.

1417
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,956
Who is it?
- Me..

1418
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,559
l didn"t recognise
your voice. Who is it?

1419
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,388
Think that l am your son.

1420
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:22,633
Son! l don"t know where
my son will be right now.

1421
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,231
lf he"d be with me
right now, why would..

1422
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,557
..l be sad about my
losing my eyesight now?.

1423
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,798
l would have seen the
world through his eyes.

1424
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,116
This world is not worthy to be seen.

1425
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,559
Think that l am your son.

1426
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,833
The doctor has told
you to eat fruits.

1427
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,396
l have brought some fruits for you.

1428
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,350
But why do you sympathise with me?

1429
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,237
l have heard that the ink of..

1430
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,429
..sin washes off with the sympathy.

1431
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:03,438
The God who created night,
created day too.

1432
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:07,830
Dear.. This is you.

1433
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:12,231
Even though you aren"t
related to me..

1434
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,112
..you are serving me like a son.

1435
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,236
And there was that sinner who made..

1436
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:26,072
..me blind for his own need.
May God forgive him.

1437
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,113
Mother. That sinner has died.

1438
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,119
He has died? How do you know?.

1439
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,438
l knew.. him very well, mother.

1440
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,275
l burnt his funeral
with my own hands.

1441
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,833
This is very bad.

1442
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,911
Even he must have been
the son of some mother.

1443
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,310
Mother.. how are you, mother?

1444
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:58,629
l am all right, dear.
- Mr. Ashok.. you?

1445
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,590
Dear.. do you know him?
- Yes.

1446
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:08,035
Dear, he is a very good man.

1447
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,672
He has been serving me very nicely.

1448
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,878
May God make him live my age too.

1449
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,231
No! l am not worthy
of these blessings.

1450
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,229
Your mother"s heart is so pure..

1451
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,397
..it doesn"t wish bad
for even your enemy.

1452
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,233
Who is man to think
badly about anyone?

1453
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,948
This life of four days is
less for goodness itself.

1454
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,828
Why should we earn sin?

1455
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:45,229
Please give me in the name of Allah.

1456
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,954
Hey.. hey. Where are
you moving inside?

1457
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,510
Will you take money, or
will you take the apartment?

1458
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:56,708
Swimming pool..
- Yes. Swimming pool. Correct.

1459
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,114
Oh! Teacher! You!

1460
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,871
This is great! Oh! Wow! Wow!
- This is rural.

1461
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,835
Have Kishore and Meena reached?

1462
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,035
They have reached
today morning itself.

1463
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,310
l will call them right away.
Hey! Meena! Kishore!

1464
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,874
Close the door.
- The door.

1465
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:15,635
What is it?

1466
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,637
Look. The seer has come to meet you.

1467
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,591
Seer? Why does he wish to see me?

1468
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,077
Son. You have
stepped into a new world.

1469
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,990
l have come to bless you.
- Surely, seer. Surely.

1470
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,395
Which new world, seer?

1471
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,230
Dear. You have left the
locality of the false goodness..

1472
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:37,399
..and settled yourself in the
pure locality of the bad men.

1473
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:44,950
Dear, see the..
- Oh! Brother! Brother!

1474
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,229
How did you disguise
yourself like this?

1475
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,952
l couldn"t recognise you at all.
- Really!

1476
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,799
The glasses to recognise me
haven"t been made till now.

1477
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,717
lt is good that you
reached a safe place.

1478
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,954
Meena.
- Yes? - These grams won"t do.

1479
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,229
Will some eatable be
arranged with this?

1480
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,395
Why not? l will bring it right away.

1481
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,956
Yes! Meena! Feeding a
seer is a very good thing!

1482
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:08,833
Listen.. - Yes? - This is a new
place. Be a little careful. - Yes.

1483
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,237
And we should start our business..

1484
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,918
..on some auspicious day.

1485
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,952
Day after tomorrow is
the full moon night.

1486
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,115
We will start our business
from day after tomorrow itself.

1487
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,230
You won"t like country liquor.

1488
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,232
l will arrange for
foreign liquor for you.

1489
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,400
Thank you. Kishore.

1490
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:23,798
Thank you. Kishore.

1491
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,395
Yes?

1492
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,557
One should commit the first
theft in light in a new city.

1493
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,069
And then, even you will have
a rebirth day after tomorrow.

1494
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,749
What do you mean?

1495
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,228
Day after tomorrow, we teacher..

1496
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:39,238
..and disciple will go
in search of our hunt..

1497
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,430
..on different roads
at the same time.

1498
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,712
Give me whatever you get,
thinking that it is my fees.

1499
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,717
And l will donate to
you whatever l get.

1500
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,959
ls there no other way in this
world to fill one"s stomach?

1501
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,238
You had a way but..

1502
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:06,433
..before your killed Shekhar.

1503
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,475
But how did you come to know that?

1504
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,229
Just how every new child has his..

1505
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,237
..name written in the municipality..

1506
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,238
..as soon as he is born,
just like that..

1507
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:21,229
..l get the news of every
theft and every murder first.

1508
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:30,111
l assure you. l didn"t
want to kill Shekhar.

1509
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,399
He wanted to kill me.

1510
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,396
His dagger killed him in the scuffle.

1511
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,238
The god who has
written the horoscope..

1512
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,237
..of the saints and seers, the same..

1513
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:44,592
..has written the horoscopes
of thieves and dacoits too.

1514
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,315
Whether Shekhar was killed with..

1515
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,954
..his own knife or
whether you killed him.

1516
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,397
Whom all will you go on telling this?

1517
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,229
You will be tired of proving your..

1518
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:58,478
..innocence but nobody
will ever believe you.

1519
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,316
But the situation..
- What about the situations?

1520
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:05,873
You are a kid now.
Nobody can fight against fate.

1521
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:10,390
lf one could fight, we
wouldn"t become dacoits and looters.

1522
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,555
All of us would do some nice job.

1523
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,359
Therefore, enjoy in
whichever place you are.

1524
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,630
Become a man. Tomorrow
is the full moon night.

1525
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,554
You have taken my eyes,
but gave me a good son.

1526
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,878
Shobha!
- Yes, mother?

1527
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,673
Have you prepared Ashok"s room?
- Yes, mother.

1528
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:43,917
Ashok - Yes? See son.
Don"t leave my side ever now.

1529
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,957
The world yearns for
a mother"s shadow.

1530
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,318
Will l leave that
shadow after getting it?

1531
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:50,715
Please don"t worry.

1532
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,911
l will leave now. lt
is time for the factory.

1533
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,916
Okay, dear. - Mother. l am
late too. Shall l leave?

1534
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,868
Go, dear, go. Take this milk.
- Okay.

1535
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,515
Mr. Ashok..

1536
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,230
Will you keep on crushing iron
even after studying till BA?

1537
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:18,110
l am looking for a good job.
l have seen an advertisement..

1538
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,032
Of a job in the
police force yesterday.

1539
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,396
l have typed its application
and put it in my pocket too.

1540
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,355
why have you put it in your pocket?

1541
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,518
Because, today is my birthday.

1542
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,079
l thought that this new
year would start nice for me.

1543
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,679
By the way, l will
post it today itself.

1544
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,236
Why didn"t you tell us
earlier that it"s your birthday?

1545
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,918
l would make some sweets for you.

1546
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,395
l would bring some gifts for you.

1547
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,550
You have done so much
for me. ls all this less?

1548
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,272
Congratulations.

1549
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,314
Your youth has taken another
step towards old age today.

1550
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,953
Why are you making
me wear this garland?

1551
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,794
So? Should l make her wear it?

1552
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,116
You will be the one
making her wear it one day.

1553
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,555
Either today, or tomorrow.
Okay. l will leave now.

1554
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:02,229
The peon goes to work first.
- Ashok!

1555
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,234
ls it your birthday today?
- Yes! Yes. Mother.

1556
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,555
But l don"t celebrate it ever.
- Come on.

1557
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:14,079
Dear. l had made this
ring on my son"s birthday.

1558
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,952
l didn"t sell it even
in hunger and bad luck.

1559
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,991
Take this. Son. This is for you.
- Mother! Why is this needed?

1560
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,229
l do not celebrate
my birthday at all.

1561
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,715
Don"t refuse it now. Here, take it.

1562
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,238
Thank you, mother.
- Bless you.

1563
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,715
l am not worth this.

1564
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,238
But god knows whether it lightens..

1565
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,237
..my life in the days to come.

1566
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,078
l will keep it and come.
l will be right back.

1567
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,035
Who is it?

1568
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,755
Hey! Who is it?

1569
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,795
Who is it?

1570
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,034
Didn"t Ashok lock the house?

1571
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,397
Brother! The bell for the
holiday has already rung.

1572
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,875
Haven"t you heard that hard work..

1573
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,228
..and labor is the
work of God? l thought..

1574
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,952
..that l"d do
tomorrows work today itself.

1575
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,229
That is all right.
But today is the day..

1576
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,032
..that your hard work
is about to rewarded.

1577
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,429
That means, today is
the day of your salary.

1578
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,953
Come on! We will take it! Come on!

1579
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,720
Hey, are you seeing
your face in these notes?

1580
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,877
l am seeing the difference
between yesterday and today.

1581
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,232
l had money yesterday too.
But the happiness that..

1582
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,429
..is there in these
that money didn"t have it.

1583
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:25,035
So, we will have a tea
party in that happiness.

1584
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,513
- Not one, two. - So, come on!

1585
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,560
Dear..
- Wait!

1586
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:35,955
What is the matter? Are
you testing your digestion?

1587
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,229
You are just eating it as
long as l have been seeing..

1588
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,395
..l don"t know what the matter is.

1589
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,238
Ever since l have been
eating from my hard earned money..

1590
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:41,679
..my appetite has doubled up.

1591
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,030
Maybe because l have worked hard.

1592
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,310
Well. Right now, you"re
eating it wrongly! - How is that?

1593
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:49,239
l"ll be paying the bill, isn"t it?
- That is not the matter.

1594
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,239
Even l can pay the bill.
But l am a peon..

1595
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,430
..and you are a bit higher than me.

1596
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,233
But in today"s world,
the upper people..

1597
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:58,271
..eat the money of the peon.

1598
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,119
But you"re not of that quality.
- What should l bring now?.

1599
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,517
Bring the bill now.
- What should l bring now!

1600
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:15,077
Come on. How much is it?
- One ten. One ten. One ten.

1601
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:16,995
Give four altogether.

1602
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,236
Friend.. Brother..

1603
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,875
You can see, isn"t it?

1604
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,675
l am sorry. l can"t see
clearly during the night. - Okay.

1605
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,599
Hey, put the light on.

1606
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,599
Hey, Who is it? Thief! Thief!

1607
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,075
Did he take something?

1608
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,553
My wallet. My wallet!
- Your wallet? - Yes. My wallet.

1609
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,235
Did the thief really take it?
- What happened?

1610
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:53,318
lt hailed as soon as
we shaved our heads.

1611
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,233
As soon as we came inside,
his wallet was stolen.

1612
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,557
l don"t care about my
wallet being stolen.

1613
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,239
All l am sorry is for
is that l couldn"t..

1614
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,998
..give mother my
first hard earned money.

1615
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,238
Did you listen to that, mother?
- Yes, dear.

1616
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,235
The person who stole
my Ashok"s wallet..

1617
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,318
..may God kill him where
he won"t even get water.

1618
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,439
Please see. The clothes
and all are just rummaged.

1619
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,749
Has he taken something else too?

1620
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,794
He has taken it.
He has taken the ring.

1621
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,229
Congratulations, Guru.
Congratulations, Kishore.

1622
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:29,113
Congratulations to everybody.

1623
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,954
The two of us had a
successful first strike.

1624
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,117
Here. This is my earning today.

1625
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:41,910
And teacher, this is my
fee for your teaching.

1626
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,909
Hey. This seems to be real.
- l got only papers.

1627
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:51,519
And you got silver. You
will enjoy life from today.

1628
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,110
Brother..
- Check if this fake or real.

1629
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,355
This weighs a lot.

1630
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,435
And there is a name etched on it too.
- A name?

1631
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,874
Yes. There is a name etched on it.

1632
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,716
Hey. The letter K is etched to it.

1633
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,950
Worked out on some
similar named person?

1634
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:49,315
Mother.

1635
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,237
Dear, did you come so early today?

1636
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,633
l was very late in returning.

1637
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,919
l can hear someone
close in this voice.

1638
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:05,109
Kishore.. dear! - Mother?
Mother.. what happened to your eyes?

1639
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,432
Tell me, mother! What
happened to your eyes?

1640
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,355
Please don"t ask anything, son.
Don"t ask anything.

1641
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:17,840
Many mountains of sorrow
fell on us after you left.

1642
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,671
Your father was sent to prison.

1643
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,315
We were ashamed of facing people..

1644
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,318
..and therefore, we left
the city and came here.

1645
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:30,316
Shobha, had to look for a job.

1646
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:35,034
A motorcar trampled me down.

1647
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,273
My life was saved,
but l lost my eyes.

1648
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:46,638
A mother"s eyesight
is her children, son.

1649
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:52,399
Please don"t cry. You
have come now, isn"t it?

1650
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:56,710
What will l be sad about now?. Dear..

1651
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,752
Tell me. where were
you since so many days?

1652
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:09,635
Mother. After l left the house
l saw many colors of this world.

1653
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:11,839
What do you work as, son?

1654
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,872
l don"t slave for anyone, mother.

1655
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:20,790
l borne wealth just like
now the world does it.

1656
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:25,957
Where is Shobha?

1657
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,833
She has gone to the
vegetable market.

1658
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,118
Okay. Mother. l will leave now.
l will meet Shobha later.

1659
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:36,788
Will you go so soon, son?

1660
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,952
Yes, mother. My business
takes place in the night.

1661
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,114
l have to keep an account
of my partners in the day.

1662
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,229
Give my love to Shobha.

1663
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,674
You don"t worry.
l will have you cured.

1664
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,957
You will be able to
see again, mother.

1665
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,999
Okay. l will leave now, okay?
- Bless you, son.

1666
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,679
He just came and then left.

1667
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,431
Hey! A Government letter!

1668
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,640
Hey! The police
commissioner has written to you.

1669
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,638
Has he opened your old file?

1670
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,239
Shut up! Shut up!
- Open it up quickly.

1671
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:26,035
Athief will stop thieving,
but not conning.

1672
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,549
l have won it! My friend!

1673
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:30,636
l had applied to
join the police force.

1674
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:31,795
l have got a letter from there.

1675
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,309
ls it so? - Yes! - very good!
- Shouldn"t we have a party?

1676
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,953
No! l have to tell Shobha first.

1677
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:39,239
You have to tell Shobha first?
lt isn"t your fault.

1678
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,954
The English has
taught you, ladies first!

1679
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:45,478
Shobha! Shobha!

1680
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:48,035
What is this? What has happened?

1681
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,309
l am very happy today.

1682
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,637
lf it was something so joyous,
you should have been patient.

1683
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,229
You should have reached home.

1684
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:56,112
lf l wouldn"t meet you,
you"d tell mother.

1685
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,396
This thing can"t be told to mother.

1686
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,239
There are some such special things..

1687
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,112
..which can be told to
only special people.

1688
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:07,469
Okay. So l am just someone
special till now in your eyes.

1689
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,709
l can only think
what you are in my eyes.

1690
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,477
l can"t tell that to you.
- Then you..

1691
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:18,477
Till when will you
speak to me like this?

1692
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:20,318
Till the time l wish it.

1693
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,955
A person thinks with his own brains.

1694
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:27,229
Shobha, l may be crazy. But there
are many things in my heart..

1695
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,033
..which are just cramped up inside.

1696
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:33,557
This distance isn"t good.
- You are a tall and strong man.

1697
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,471
But you are a bit thick-headed.
- What?

1698
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,478
Ashok.
- Shobha.

1699
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,876
ls the distance wiped now?.
- No.

1700
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,874
lt is wiped out now.
- Okay. Tell me the good news now.

1701
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,470
Hey! l had almost forgotten.
Look at this. My appointment letter.

1702
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,795
l have got the job of a
police inspector. - Really! - Yes!

1703
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:57,034
Thank you, God!

1704
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,720
Now. Come with me.
- Where? - wherever l take you.

1705
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,230
lf we get a couple of days
of love in such a huge city..

1706
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:03,713
..it is all right.

1707

l will give mother
the good news first.

1753
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,953
Why should you give the news?
l will tell her.

1754
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,354
Why? was it you who
joined the police, or me?

1755
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,789
Are you acting haughty as a
policeman right now?. - Why not?

1756
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,230
l have double rights. - How?
- First of all, it is my mother.

1757
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,232
Secondly, you are mine.

1758
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,953
Mother.
- What is the matter?

1759
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:25,237
Mother. We will have
to leave Mr. Ashok now.

1760
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,797
What are you saying? - l am telling
you the truth, mother.

1761
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,032
Mr. Ashok has got a
job in the police force.

1762
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:33,108
ls it so? - Yes. - You
have given me such good news.

1763
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:36,428
l will give you some good news too.

1764
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,475
My son Kishore had come.
- Really?

1765
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,238
Why did brother go
without meeting me?

1766
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,118
He will be coming
almost every day now.

1767
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,712
He has really become a big man now.

1768
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,393
God listens to everyone.

1769
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,917
He listened to my sons a bit late.

1770
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,115
But at least, he did listen.

1771
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:32,958
Okay. So you have become
a police inspector now.

1772
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,555
Yes, mother. With your blessings.

1773
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,872
These are the blessings of God, dear.

1774
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,998
Who blessed him.

1775
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,518
Come on. Present yourself to him.

1776
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:45,234
Mother. You have snatched
the words from my mouth.

1777
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:47,352
Look, l have arranged
for the worship-plate.

1778
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,595
Okay. Come on, dear.

1779
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:50,517
You people go. l have just
returned from the temple.

1780
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,875
l have to go to the office.

1781
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,435
Thief! Thief!
- Catch him!

1782
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:49,955
Mother! Mother!

1783
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:58,995
Friends. Kishore is the
rightful owner of this seat.

1784
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:04,239
ln our clan, the person
who kills two people..

1785
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:09,036
..and handles a big heist,
this seat is to be given to him.

1786
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,600
Kishore. Your name
isn"t Kishore any longer.

1787
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:14,519
Your name is the
Rebellious Star from today.

1788
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:17,720
Hail the Rebellious Star!

1789
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,233
Shobha, the people who have to go..

1790
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:42,955
..don"t come back ever.
Only, their memories linger.

1791
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:49,319
What do l have except
mother"s memories now?.

1792
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,876
l don"t know what has
happened to this world.

1793
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,357
The cost of human lives
is lesser than an ant too.

1794
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:08,470
God save the mother of
that killer who borne him.

1795
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,079
very good, Kishore!

1796
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:18,028
The old woman"s soul
will be very happy with you.

1797
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,353
You gave her nirvana.

1798
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,396
She must be tired of her blindness.

1799
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,238
Teacher, the nearby areas have the..

1800
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:27,635
..name Rebellious Star
etched in their minds.

1801
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:28,875
Why shouldn"t they have it?

1802
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,514
After all, he is the
bravest of the brave.

1803
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,233
The Rebellious Star?
- Yes.

1804
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,230
The same dreaded
criminal who has made life..

1805
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:37,749
..difficult for the common
public as well as the police.

1806
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,239
According to our information,
he has..

1807
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,316
..ran away from here
towards the north.

1808
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:47,832
Ashok. l am giving you a
great responsibility. - Yes sir.

1809
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:50,238
lf the Rebellious Star
is arrested by you..

1810
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,954
..the public, it will be
the betterment of the public.

1811
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,868
The police will earn a good name.

1812
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,793
And you will be promoted too.

1813
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,788
l assure you. l will think
duty to be dearer than my life.

1814
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,233
Bringing the
Rebellious Star dead or alive..

1815
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:05,429
..is my religion now.
- Well said.

1816
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:09,120
The police there have
been told about this.

1817
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:14,351
lt will help you in every way.
Here is the file of this case.

1818
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,715
Wish you all the best.
- Thank you, sir.

1819
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:23,228
Friends. All of you
share the five lakhs out..

1820
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,239
..of the ten that were
stolen from the bank.

1821
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,997
And keep the rest of the
five lakhs in our gang"s fund.

1822
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:35,433
what will you do of the fund
when the gang isn"t there?

1823
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:39,712
what are you saying?
- My people have just found out.

1824
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:43,238
The police have
chosen some inspector..

1825
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,989
..Ashok to arrest our gang.
- Ashok!

1826
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,912
Why were you shocked by this name?

1827
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:59,032
No! Just like that. l remembered
an old friend with same name.

1828
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:01,559
lf only he"d be with me right now.

1829
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,475
The two of us would have
looted the whole world.

1830
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:07,957
Where is he nowadays?
- l don"t know.

1831
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,234
Well, forget the
memories of the old friend.

1832
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:14,511
We have to finish
lnspector Ashok first.

1833
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,116
You people set your traps too.
- Yes. Boss.

1834
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:22,875
And yes, Madan. Tell
Meena to be careful too.

1835
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:27,072
lnspector Ashok"s death is our life.

1836
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,710
His life is our death.

1837
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,239
The Rebellious
Star"s life has become..

1838
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,510
..death for the people and
an insult to the police.

1839
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,635
But apprehending him
is a risky job too.

1840
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,391
The life has no worth in
the path of duty, Shobha.

1841
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,674
With your requests to God,
l will surely apprehend him.

1842
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:47,238
wherever there are good intentions..

1843
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,476
..there are God"s blessing there.

1844
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:56,119
With God"s blessings, l have a
friends blessings too, Shobha.

1845
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:58,479
lf only he"d be with me today.

1846
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,913
He would be very happy to see me!

1847
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,432
Who was he?
- He was a messiah of truth.

1848
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:07,240
Friend. Please take
me to help you too.

1849
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,396
No. Chaman. l am working
for the police, not you.

1850
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:11,632
So what if you are the police man?

1851
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,399
Even l am the servant of the people.

1852
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:14,993
l will work without any pay.

1853
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,840
lt is possible that l will catch
the Rebellious Star before you.

1854
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,911
Catch a fly and show me first.
- A fly?

1855
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,920
Here.. -Come on l will come too.

1856
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,838
Catch it. - See. lt is in the tea.
- Come on! - l will come too. - Okay.

1857
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:28,475
Shobha, l will leave now.

1858
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,315
l will right to you as
soon as l reach there.

1859
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,395
Take care of yourself.

1860
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:34,715
Shall l leave?

1861
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,468
No, darling. Please don"t touch me.

1862
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,231
l have vowed that
till the time l don"t..

1863
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:59,796
..apprehend the Rebellious Star,
l won"t touch you.

1864
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:02,875
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

1865
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,629
lt"s an honour meeting you.
Are you lnspector Ashok?

1866
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,635
Correct.

1867
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:11,718
l am the private secretary to
the Commissioner of police here.

1868
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,956
But.. there isn"t anyone in khaki?

1869
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:18,312
lt is sir"s order that
l should receive you all alone.

1870
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:22,115
Because the Rebellious
Star"s people are everywhere.

1871
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,872
Correct. l will come right away.

1872
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,315
Please come, lnspector.

1873
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:47,791
What is the matter? The
commissioner uses a small car?

1874
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:51,069
Shut up and sit down. Come on, Sheru.

1875
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,035
That means has it started?

1876
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,637
Come on!
- Help! She is eloping with a man!

1877
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,558
Not here, up there. Oh!
- The snake bites too.

1878
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,432
l am going.

1879
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,477
Please tell me which is this place?

1880
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,715
l am feeling very hot.

1881
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,956
Don"t worry. We will cool you down.

1882
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:17,474
Him..
- Who is this new passenger?

1883
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:19,079
He is a first class passenger.

1884
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,111
He is Ali Baba"s treasure for us.

1885
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:24,717
lnspector Ashok.
- lnspector Ashok?

1886
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:26,798
Pleased to meet you.
- Shut up.

1887
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:28,875
What should be done with him?

1888
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,072
The Rebellious Star will decide this.

1889
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:34,477
Lock him up carefully.
He is priceless.

1890
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:37,956
lt is expensive. But why do
you take the trouble of locking..

1891
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:39,479
Come on! Come on!
- No.

1892
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:48,558
He cannot be him.
- What are you seeing?

1893
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:52,559
l am seeing that what the
astrologer had said is true.

1894
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,319
And what did the astrologer say?

1895
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:57,238
He had said that you will
die at the hands of some..

1896
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,397
..gentleman some, gentleman wretch.

1897
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:03,557
What?! You are calling me a wretch?

1898
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:05,398
Not you. But the one
who will kill me.

1899
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,638
l will just tell you how a
gentleman kills a wretch.

1900
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:11,318
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
- Shut up!

1901
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:16,116
Baldev, Tie him up!
- Baldev.. Baldev..

1902
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:18,396
Tie my hands too,
otherwise l will run away.

1903
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:33,475
Friends!

1904
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:38,237
l have brought the
Kohinoor diamond today.

1905
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:41,478
The Kohinoor diamond?
You created a problem.

1906
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,635
lt"s a bad omen.

1907
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:44,876
The one who gets
it"s shadow is finished.

1908
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:49,710
But we will finish it today.
l have got the lnspector Ashok.

1909
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,436
lnspector Ashok? How many
lnspector Ashok"s are there?

1910
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:55,875
Meena has just
caught an inspector Ashok.

1911
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,558
l have tied him up in
the dark dungeon right now.

1912
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:02,231
What? lnspector Ashok?
- Yes! - No! However.

1913
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,317
The Rebellious Star
will decide this.

1914
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,319
My people are bringing
him with them.

1915
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,475
Tie him up in the dark dungeon too.

1916
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,635
Okay. Come on.

1917
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,035
Bring him in too!

1918
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:19,319
Tie him up! Tie him up
with this wretch too.

1919
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,477
Two are better than one.

1920
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:25,637
All of them will be stunned
when they see two inspectors.

1921
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:26,795
Boss.
- Yes.

1922
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,475
Rebellious Star..

1923
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,877
We were waiting for you.
Do you know?.

1924
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,877
We have caught two
inspector Ashok"s.

1925
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:36,476
Two lnspector Ashok"s?
- Yes.

1926
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:38,875
And the teacher says that
Rebellious Star will decide.

1927
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,035
Come on upstairs.

1928
02:13:46,360 --> 02:13:47,395
Where did the two go?

1929
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,395
These two have disappeared!

1930
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:53,551
Teacher! Teacher! - What is it?
- The two have ran away.

1931
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:02,392
This inspector was very smart.

1932
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,078
The police have
found out about our den.

1933
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:06,793
We will have to
leave our place quickly.

1934
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:09,878
But where will we go?
- Go and tell everyone. Go.

1935
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,469
Madam. You need a motor,
l need a passenger.

1936
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,875
Money is saved in the bus.
Time is saved in a taxi.

1937
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,558
What do you say,
should l open the door?

1938
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,395
Okay! Come on! Quickly!

1939
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,636
Hey, why did you stop it here?

1940
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,034
This is the house of my sir.

1941
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,879
l will just give him
yesterday"s account.

1942
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,956
Please bring the madam
inside with respect.

1943
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,237
Hey! What is this?

1944
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,712
Guru!
- Why are you shouting?

1945
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,228
Guru!
- Here it is.

1946
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:13,308
lt is a major problem.

1947
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:16,318
What happened?
- Meena is caught. - What?

1948
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,793
Yes. l saw it with my own eyes.

1949
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,639
A Khaki clad person made her
sit in a taxi and took her away.

1950
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:25,433
This means that the
police is still following us.

1951
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:33,317
What is new in this? The police
has been chasing us since years.

1952
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:35,318
l am worried because of Meena.

1953
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:38,713
What if the police torture
her and she spills our secrets?

1954
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:44,392
Meena is my sister. l know
that death cannot scare her.

1955
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:47,320
That is all right. But woman
is the name of a weak thing.

1956
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:52,238
lf Meena shows her weakness..

1957
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:56,876
..the bullet from my gun
will silence her forever.

1958
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,070
- What are you saying?
- She is your sister.

1959
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:03,397
Till the time she keeps
our secrets in her heart.

1960
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:06,078
Not after that. Come.

1961
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,869
No! l am not
connected to those dacoits.

1962
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,233
Surely. Tell me that you didn"t
have a hand in carnival theft.

1963
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:18,629
You know the Rebellious Star nicely.

1964
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,954
Rebellious Star? l
haven"t even heard his name.

1965
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:23,399
You have heard it now, isn"t it?

1966
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,399
Tell me where he is straight away.

1967
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,875
You cannot save yourself
from the clutches of the law.

1968
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:33,238
There is a distance
of just ten seconds..

1969
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,793
..between your life and death.

1970
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:37,318
Tell me the whereabouts
of the Rebellious Star.

1971
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,479
Your life will be spared
as a Government witness.

1972
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,079
Otherwise, l am helpless.

1973
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:50,309
l will just count ten, Rosy.
One. Two.

1974
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:57,310
Three. Four. Five. Six.
- No!

1975
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:01,479
Seven, - The rebellious Star!
- Eight. - Nine

1976
02:17:05,080 --> 02:17:06,308
Nine.
- And my brother..

1977
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,954
Someone has shot her!
She has been shot!

1978
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,229
Take her to the hospital immediately.

1979
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,793
Send the police down below, quickly.

1980
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:20,469
Rebellious star, learn
to live like a brave man.

1981
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,034
Meena was my sister.

1982
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,233
l killed her for my principles.

1983
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:30,395
What can l do?

1984
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,228
The ones who spill
the blood of others..

1985
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,635
..can spill the blood
of their close ones too.

1986
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:38,115
Guru!

1987
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:40,794
Today is the 15th August.

1988
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:45,797
Today"s day is a very
symbolic day for me.

1989
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:49,230
l have written the legend
of dacoits..

1990
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:51,396
..with the blood of my sister.

1991
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:59,793
15th August?
- Yes. Fifteenth August.

1992
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,559
lt is good that you
reminded me today"s date.

1993
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,558
l remembered a forgotten date.

1994
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,070
What kind of promise?
- One of meeting an old friend.

1995
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,236
Three years ago,
we two had promised..

1996
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:12,476
..to meet each other
on this day itself.

1997
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:17,470
l will move now. My friend
must be yearning for me. - Go.

1998
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,239
The plan that l have made to
apprehend the Rebellious Star..

1999
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,237
..if that plan succeeds..

2000
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:24,316
..it is just the
matter of a couple of days.

2001
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:27,034
This isn"t a Rebellious Star,
he is a problem to the life.

2002
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,798
Whenever l see, you are
saying the Rebellious Star.

2003
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,388
lt is a responsibility.
- That is all right.

2004
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:33,875
But why do you forget
that Shobha is coming?

2005
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,035
We have to go to the
station to receive her.

2006
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,036
Shobha is about to come today?
Shobha!

2007
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:41,431
You have come?
- Yes. l have come.

2008
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:44,032
Couldn"t you come to
receive me on the station too?

2009
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,555
Shobha, you know
why l have come here.

2010
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,958
l have work sometimes.
l have to shoot sometimes.

2011
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:51,399
You have to shed blood sometimes.

2012
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,238
Chaman!
- No. You don"t have to shed blood.

2013
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,320
You go. - l"ll go. l want to
speak a lot to you. Come on.

2014
02:18:57,440 --> 02:19:00,477
You go! Wow! Come on, friend.

2015
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:02,872
l was about to come to the station.

2016
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,228
l was dressed up too,
when all of a sudden..

2017
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:06,396
..the commissioner called up,
and l was called there.

2018
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,795
Please bring some tea quickly, son.

2019
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:11,317
l will have some tea
quickly and then leave.

2020
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:12,715
The commissioner has called me.

2021
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,239
Today, we had freed mother lndia..

2022
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:18,397
..from the chains of slavery.

2023
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:20,239
And we had promised
ourselves that we will..

2024
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,954
..keep this day"s
respect all through our lives.

2025
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:27,878
We will have to keep the
promises that we took today.

2026
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,797
15th August, 1969 is
dearer to us than our life too.

2027
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,872
1969.

2028
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:37,549
68.

2029
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:43,797
67.. 66..

2030
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,035
What are you thinking about?

2031
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:49,629
lt is three years already?
Three years?

2032
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:53,396
Shobha, l have to go somewhere.
- Where?

2033
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:57,311
To keep my promise.
To meet my friend.

2034
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,318
You have to go to the commissioner.

2035
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:00,714
The commissioner can wait.

2036
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:08,356
My friend shouldn"t wait.
He shouldn"t wait. My friend!

2037
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:40,311
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2038
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:44,639
"l have seen it nicely,
with my own eyes."

2039
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:49,436
"lt is difficult to
recognise who is good or bad here."

2040
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:54,311
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2041
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:58,638
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2042
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:02,959
"l have seen it nicely,
with my own eyes."

2043
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:07,717
"lt is difficult to
recognise who is good or bad here."

2044
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:12,398
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2045
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,475
"Every morning of mine is
the festival of colors."

2046
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,830
"Every evening of mine is
the festival of lights."

2047
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:44,797
"This is the world of two days.
lt is not going with us."

2048
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:52,318
"Whose heart is pure.."

2049
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:02,637
"Whose heart is pure
climbs even after falling down."

2050
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:07,311
"Look at the moon that
sets and moves ahead."

2051
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:11,038
"Oh, friend!"
- "Oh, friend!"

2052
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,037
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2053
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:20,399
"l have seen it nicely,
with my own eyes."

2054
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:25,310
"lt is difficult to
recognise who is good or bad here."

2055
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:29,639
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2056
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:00,035
"May you have the thorns of truth."

2057
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:02,390
"l will have to flowers of lies."

2058
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,471
"l will tread on the path which
has color on it"s every step."

2059
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:21,632
"There are a lakh of ways for lies."

2060
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:26,959
"There are a lakh of ways for lies."

2061
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:29,548
"There is just one
destination for truth."

2062
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:31,238
"The heart which fears God thinks.."

2063
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:34,033
"..that every problem is easy."

2064
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:37,309
"Oh, friend!"
- "Oh, friend!"

2065
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:41,798
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2066
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:46,114
"l have seen it nicely,
with my own eyes."

2067
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:51,036
"lt is difficult to
recognize who is good or bad here."

2068
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:55,797
"Oh, my friend,
l have seen the world."

2069
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,228
"Oh, my friend..""

2070
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:37,032
Please say something.

2071
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:40,237
When the heart of two friends are..

2072
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:41,952
..talking to each other
why should the lips work?

2073
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,230
l couldn"t even think that
you would change so much!

2074
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:48,396
But you are just strong as before.

2075
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,035
Okay, tell me. Did you marry or..

2076
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:55,879
l will be marrying very soon!

2077
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,230
Okay. Tell me how the to
be sister-in-law will be?

2078
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:00,715
ls she ebony, fair, tall, broad?
- She is like a Goddess.

2079
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:02,831
lf you see her, you will
go crazy. Okay. Tell me.

2080
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:04,718
Did you meet your dad?
How is your mother?

2081
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,876
How is your sister?
- All of them are all right.

2082
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:09,555
What did you do in these three years?
where all did you go?

2083
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:11,477
What did you learn and teach?
Tell me!

2084
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,236
l did all that
in three years which..

2085
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:18,318
..l wouldn"t have been able to
do in three hundred years too.

2086
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:21,033
Life took may turns.

2087
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,316
lt is a colorful story, my friend.

2088
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:26,636
Some girl has come in your life?

2089
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,640
Have you found some
better friend than me?

2090
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,228
Not a friend, my friend.

2091
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:35,316
But l certainly have found an enemy.

2092
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:39,078
He is thirsty for my
blood and l for his.

2093
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,877
He is searching for me.
And l am searching for him.

2094
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,795
Tell me who he is.

2095
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:49,877
Why shouldn"t l
finish my friend"s enemy?

2096
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:52,319
Don"t be excited, my friend.

2097
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:57,391
l have learnt how to color my
hands with the enemy"s blood.

2098
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:01,231
You are saying this?
- Yes. l am saying this.

2099
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:04,238
No. You used to step
lightly on the floor..

2100
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:06,396
..so that your feet
don"t crush any ant.

2101
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,240
You were a very..
- Non-violent.

2102
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:10,395
You were a non-violent person.

2103
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:18,117
You are joking.
- l am not joking.

2104
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,476
He isn"t a man who
doesn"t walk with time.

2105
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:21,955
l think..

2106
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:25,397
The world can change,
but my friend can"t change.

2107
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,474
Everything can change. Look at me.

2108
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:32,230
l picked so many pockets,
looted and thieved..

2109
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:34,874
..so many places and
people in these three years.

2110
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,319
You can"t think about all that.

2111
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:39,237
You had told me that
the bad buffets..

2112
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:41,316
..don"t have the fun
of a honest starvation.

2113
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:45,239
Truth is the twig that
can cross an ocean too.

2114
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:47,954
To hell with the truth!
And to hell with the good.

2115
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:50,238
ln the world where
there is no place..

2116
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:52,954
..for good, it is stupidity
to be good in that world.

2117
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:54,395
Listen to the whole thing,
my friend.

2118
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,229
Do you remember? l used to dance..

2119
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:58,635
..listening to the radio
during my college days?

2120
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:02,238
l dance just like that,
listening to sounds of bullets.

2121
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:04,431
l have become a very big man.

2122
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:07,717
l have become the leader of a
gang of hoodlums and thieves.

2123
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:11,238
You must have heard the name
of the Rebellious Star. - Yes.

2124
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:15,237
My friend! l am him!

2125
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:23,230
You! You are Rebellious Star?

2126
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:28,309
Yes. Ashok. l am him.
My enemy is a ClD officer.

2127
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:31,230
Till the time l
don"t whet my forehead..

2128
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:33,794
..with his blood, these
eyes won"t get any sleep.

2129
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,075
Forget these things.

2130
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:37,952
Tell me. What has gone on with you?

2131
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,116
My story is very interesting too.

2132
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,238
l have spent these three
years in helping people..

2133
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:51,636
..serving the poor
and supporting justice.

2134
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:56,948
Helping people, serving the
poor and supporting justice?

2135
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:03,477
You are saying all this?
l won"t believe it.

2136
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,318
How will you not
believe it, my friend?

2137
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:10,231
lf a person like you
becomes a devil..

2138
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:14,558
..then can"t a devil
like me become a man?

2139
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:21,478
Wow! Time takes a nice turn too.

2140
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:26,392
l wore your disguise
and you wore mine.

2141
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,478
Okay. Tell me. What
do you do nowadays?

2142
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,635
Me..

2143
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,479
l am searching for an enemy too.

2144
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:42,797
He is chasing me,
and l am chasing him.

2145
02:28:44,360 --> 02:28:48,399
One of our death is
playing hide and seek.

2146
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:52,036
Why? His death is
playing hide and seek.

2147
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,032
Quickly tell me who he is.

2148
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:59,392
My friend"s enemy
will die at my hands.

2149
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,555
No, my friend..

2150
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,716
l will do this good
work with my own hands.

2151
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,955
Give me your pistol.

2152
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:09,115
Whether it is your gun or mine.

2153
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,432
The friend will be handy.

2154
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:15,874
As the friend wishes it.

2155
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,715
Hands up, Kishore.

2156
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,635
What joke is this?

2157
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,718
This isn"t a joke. This is reality.

2158
02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:45,318
l am that officer
whose blood you thirst for.

2159
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:55,710
That ClD officer? lt is you?

2160
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:04,314
That means, two friends
will challenge each other?

2161
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:07,956
You can"t make me forget my
duty for my friend"s sake.

2162
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:10,873
Don"t forget, Ashok.
l am your oldest friend.

2163
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,468
l think my duty to me
more than my friendship.

2164
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:17,036
lf you are my friend, you
will help me in my duty.

2165
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:19,833
Look, Ashok. This is
the question of my life.

2166
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:22,715
Will you hang me and
fulfill your duty?

2167
02:30:23,440 --> 02:30:25,237
Remember those college days..

2168
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:26,475
..where l helped you at every step.

2169
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:27,635
Hands up, or l will shoot!

2170
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:28,795
No, Prakash! No!

2171
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:37,795
My friend!

2172
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:51,555
Driver, come quickly!

2173
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:19,554
Welcome, Rebellious Star.

2174
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:20,955
Here, have this.

2175
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:23,236
Where is the teacher?

2176
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:25,874
Rebellious star, l have come.

2177
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,471
l have brought a very
beautiful and fragile gift for you.

2178
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:36,798
lnspector Ashok"s fiancee.
- Where is she?

2179
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:43,635
Go. Go and have a close look.

2180
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,475
She is very good bait.

2181
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,479
Shobha?
- Brother?

2182
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:03,314
Shobha? Brother?

2183
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,832
Teacher. She is my sister.

2184
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:11,318
A girl is always someone"s sister.

2185
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:15,318
Meena was my sister too.

2186
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,796
What are you staring at? Kill her.

2187
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:23,551
Prakash! - Athief and
dacoit"s conscience is just money.

2188
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:28,556
He isn"t anyone"s brother
and neither anyone"s son.

2189
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:35,039
He doesn"t have any
sister nor any mother.

2190
02:33:35,360 --> 02:33:39,239
So, brother. You have
become a thief and a dacoit?

2191
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:43,033
You had left your
house for your principles.

2192
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,558
Mother, father and sister.

2193
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:48,229
You had kicked the perks
of life just because..

2194
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:50,794
..you didn"t like your
father taking bribes.

2195
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:54,637
Tell me. Tell me. Did you do
all this to be become a thief?

2196
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:57,308
Do your work.

2197
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:00,554
Emotions don"t have any
importance in our religion.

2198
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,078
Take this revolver. Take it!

2199
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:06,476
Guru, Guru.

2200
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:08,398
The police have surrounded
us from all four sides. - Yes.

2201
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,037
The police have come?
Kishore. We don"t have much time.

2202
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:15,353
Clear the enemy from the path first.

2203
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:17,399
l will settle with the
police till that time.

2204
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:19,477
You go that side. l will go here.

2205
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:27,077
Shoot me.

2206
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,230
The hand which tied the
sacred thread of fraternity..

2207
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:35,716
..on my hand, how can
that hand shoot his sister?

2208
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,239
The hand on which l used to tie the..

2209
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:39,237
..sacred thread, wasn"t the hand..

2210
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:42,238
..of a thief, dacoit and murderer.

2211
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:56,716
Many of our people have died.

2212
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:59,476
Leave with the others.
l will stop them.

2213
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:03,629
Surrender yourself to the police.

2214
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:05,952
Shobha, you run away from here.

2215
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:07,718
l am not a criminal
to run away from here.

2216
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:10,878
Shobha, my life is ruined as it is.

2217
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,238
But you have your
whole life in front of you.

2218
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:16,239
Run away from here!

2219
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:19,548
Ashok! Ashok!

2220
02:35:43,440 --> 02:35:44,475
Kishore!

2221
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:51,395
Ashok!

2222
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:58,554
Brother!

2223
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:00,629
Brother!

2224
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:05,068
Do you know whom you want to shoot?

2225
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:09,114
l know him very well,
Shobha. He is my friend Ashok.

2226
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:12,949
Brother! Don"t you know that
he is my life partner too?

2227
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:23,229
Ashok! Ashok! Ashok!

2228
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:26,239
The man whom you want
to kill is a dacoit..

2229
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:30,319
..later and my brother first.
My only brother!

2230
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:35,549
Your lone brother! But
he is my only friend too!

2231
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:37,955
My lone friend!

2232
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:39,957
Will you kill your friend?

2233
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:43,111
l wish that he should kill me.

2234
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,356
But this time, l am not Kishore"s
friend, but the servant to law.

2235
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:48,549
You don"t come in between, Shobha.

2236
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,718
You have to decide what
you want to sacrifice.

2237
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,711
Either your love or your brother.

2238
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:54,875
Ashok.

2239
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,070
Kishore.
- Ashok.

2240
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:25,318
Surrender yourself to me, Kishore.

2241
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:28,032
l don"t want to be the
murderer of my friend.

2242
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:35,231
How did you decide from
now itself that l will die?

2243
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:37,396
l wish that l should
become the aim of your bullet.

2244
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:40,237
But l don"t wish that you should..

2245
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:42,999
..be accused of killing
a friend too.

2246
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:48,480
lt doesn"t matter. One friend"s
death will be another"s life.

2247
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:04,229
Brother!

2248
02:38:09,360 --> 02:38:10,873
Kishore! Kishore!

2249
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,315
Brother!

2250
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,556
This moment is so beautiful.

2251
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:21,956
Even if l am dying,
l am dying in my friend"s embrace.

2252
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:23,315
Kishore!

2253
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:26,956
The bullet that killed
you was the bullet of law.

2254
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:29,239
But the embrace, in
which you are dying..

2255
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:32,113
..is your friend"s embrace.

2256
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:36,798
Okay, tell me something
before l die. who won?

2257
02:38:37,080 --> 02:38:39,719
Did lies win or did the truth win?

2258
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:41,399
You won, Kishore.

2259
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,877
You taught me the lesson of truth.

2260
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:47,557
But friend, you forgot everything.
l remembered it.

2261
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:51,310
No, Ashok, you have won.

2262
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:57,638
lt is very easy to be bad from good.

2263
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:03,319
lt is very difficult
to become good from bad.

2264
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:04,635
Brother!

2265
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:10,831
l couldn"t give you
anything in life.

2266
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:16,309
Today, l will give you one
last present while dying.

2267
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:20,956
That present will become the
vermilion on your forehead.

2268
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:22,955
Brother!

2269
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:28,799
Ashok, l am leaving
Shobha in your care.

2270
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:33,315
Don"t think her to
be a dacoit"s sister.

2271
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:36,239
Don"t give the name
of enmity to life..

2272
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:39,318
..long friendship in
the last moment of life.

2273
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:41,398
My friend!
- My friend!

2274
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:46,432
Okay.. now l will..

2275
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:52,876
Move!
- Move!

2276
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:55,555
Move!

2277
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:00,638
Cry as much as you wish today.

2278
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:04,240
Maybe the truth
behind your tears will..

2279
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:07,079
..stop my soul from wandering about.

2280
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:13,958
My friend! l am going.
- Leaving memories?

2281
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:18,314
Memories! Here.. see this. See this..

2282
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,555
Brother!

2283
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,638
Kishore!
- Brother!

2284
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:26,315
Brother!

2285
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:31,389
"Lies have a lakh of paths."

2286
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:36,318
"Lies have a lakh of paths."

2287
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:39,238
"There is just one
destination to truth."

2288
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:43,638
"The one who fears God thinks
that all problems are simple."
