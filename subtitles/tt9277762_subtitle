(Babble of voices)

2
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,621
- How much for the balloon?
- Ten rupees.

3
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,259
Which one?

4
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,519
Balloon vendors don't 
stand middle of road

5
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,525
Move way

6
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,413
- How much for this one?
- Fifty rupees.

7
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:13,568
- This one?
- No, thanks.

8
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,412
(Folk song)

9
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
Rajan, how're you?

10
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
I seeing every things

11
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,696
I'll see if I can find it.

12
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,760
- Brother!
- Hi!

13
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,520
Alright, I had to come here.

14
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:41,492
(Folk song)

15
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,720
- How much?
- Fifty rupees.

16
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,096
Fifty rupees!

17
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,390
What unfair?

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,640
But it's just 4 holes!

19
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,976
50's too much.

20
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,096
Give it to me for ten.

21
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:07,952
Your face has holes in it!
Ten rupees!

22
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,639
Get lost!

23
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,495
(Babble of voices)

24
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:36,560
Hello, sir.

25
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,080
Hello! Here, take some.

26
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,280
What brings you here?

27
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,400
Come, uncle.

28
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,957
- Come in, brother.
- Coming ma.

29
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,175
- Here, darling.
- She's just stuffed her face!

30
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,331
- Want to drink water?
- Bring it.

31
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:04,685
I will bring it.

32
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,342
Hi uncle

33
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:08,814
What a crowd
at the festival!

34
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:10,323
You didn't come?

35
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:11,737
How is now?

36
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:17,287
It used to be exciting
when we were young.

37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,362
I made dry fish curry and rice.

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,284
- Bring it.
- I will bring it.

39
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:23,956
Study, child.

40
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:31,117
Remember those flutes we used to
buy at the fair for 50 paise?

41
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,386
Do you want to play
with toys at this age?

42
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,761
Will a toy flute
scare away a thief?

43
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:39,928
It's not for me, silly!

44
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,264
Come, come, Mani.

45
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,040
Didn't you set
up the stall today?

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
The new beat cop came.

47
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Why?

48
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:50,503
Dry fish curry.

49
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,636
We have to pay 500
rupees a night after 8 pm.

50
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,308
And what's left for us?

51
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,644
- Sweetheart!
- Veera!

52
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,493
Hey Uncle!

53
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,081
- Come...come
- Mother

54
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,604
- Come, eat.
- I will eat ma.

55
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,192
- Uncle...
- Come, Veera.

56
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,956
Special feast?

57
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,417
Was yesterday they 
told like that?

58
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:14,613
It was aunt's death
anniversary 3 days ago?

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
You didn't tell me?

60
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,271
It happens every year, son.

61
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,791
I came for my
Aadhar card. Mani!

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,792
So how much is
that flute for?

63
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,238
Never mind.

64
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,034
This fish curry's delicious.
I'll have some more.

65
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,127
Veera, come sit.

66
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,011
Here.

67
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,430
What is it?

68
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,393
Guavas! Where did
you get so many from?

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,880
They're from Vellaisaamy's garden.
He gave them to me.

70
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,792
That old miser only
has a soft spot for you.

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Yesterday, I was planning
to visit you at work.

72
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,995
But you came.

73
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,000
You wouldn't have found
me if you'd come.

74
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,183
Why not?

75
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,439
I quit my job.

76
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,689
Quit your job?

77
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,698
What's he saying?

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,104
Are you insane?

79
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,229
It's a government
job with a pension.

80
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:17,276
You're not married yet.

81
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,680
And you've quit your job!

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,962
Do you know how many people
I had to beg to get you that job?

83
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:27,760
I thought I'd join
the union full-time.

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
Really?

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
That's okay, too.

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,760
What's the use of being a
government bus conductor?

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,720
See you.

88
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
Bring me some water.

89
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:41,510
Veera, wait.

90
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,377
- He never stand here.
- Come...come, Uncle

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,160
Drive safe!

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,666
Go carefully, uncle.

93
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,182
Why did he quit his job?

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,814
Veera!

95
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,580
Lend me 20 rupees.
I'll return it when I'm paid.

96
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,705
Is that what you've
been trying to ask?

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
No, no. just 20.

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,520
Keep it.

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,751
I'll remind you if you forget.

100
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,406
It's Senthil's daughter's birthday.

101
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,931
How time flies!
She's 9 now.

102
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,071
So I thought I'd buy her a flute.

103
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,400
It's tomorrow?

104
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,806
Fine Uncle.

105
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,580
Don't get me wrong.

106
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:24,673
You're old now.

107
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:27,314
Why are you still doing 
this watchman's job?

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,970
There's the 3 of us.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,480
Or you can move to Senthil's.

110
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,536
Why are you struggling?

111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,120
Only moths fall into the flame.

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,705
I'm a firefly.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
You never listen.

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,360
Come, I'll drop you off.

115
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,760
Why, don't you like to
see me in one piece?

116
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,479
I'll walk.

117
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,861
(Kids playing)

118
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:28,197
'The Burden'

119
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,000
Run, run!

120
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,486
Mister

121
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,575
- Careful
- What happened?

122
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,663
Give him some water.

123
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,880
My hip!

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,572
Watch his hip!

125
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,330
- Let's go that way.
- Easy, easy.

126
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:53,697
He is here only working.

127
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,457
- Where does he work?
- Here.

128
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,616
Lift him, bro, he's heavy

129
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,768
Brother

130
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,815
Gently.

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
Lie down carefully.

132
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,073
Brother.

133
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,822
Who's it at this hour?

134
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Sorry to bother you.
He's the colony watchman.

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,200
A motorcyclist hit him.

136
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,040
My home's too far away.

137
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
We didn't know what to do.

138
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,640
- Has he given you his address?
- No.

139
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,640
He's not talking.
He only said his hip hurts.

140
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,903
Is this really an accident?

141
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:36,983
Yes. 
We saw it.

142
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
We'll get in trouble.

143
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,808
- Have you packed her lunch?
- Yes.

144
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:45,951
- ‘Bye, ma!
- You better come straight home.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,440
No stopping to play
with your friends!

146
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,640
Bye grandma.

147
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,560
Take the container.

148
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,574
Bring the bag.

149
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,920
‘Bye, ma.

150
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,400
‘Bye, sweetie.

151
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:11,478
Oh God!

152
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,840
Tell me.

153
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,760
I sent the cash yesterday

154
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,971
but he's still asking
us to close early.

155
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,022
Muruga...

156
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
One second, ma.

157
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:26,995
Hey Muruga...

158
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,550
- Listen to me!
- One second, ma!

159
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,840
Your uncle hasn't
returned from work yet.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,767
I'll call you back.

161
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,705
It's 1 o'clock.

162
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,104
He can't bear to stay hungry.

163
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,041
Ma, he always comes
straight home from work.

164
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
He must have stopped
to chat with someone.

165
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,846
You're crying over this?

166
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,807
He's never done this before.
He'd at least call.

167
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,447
Tell me, Muruga.

168
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,800
He's not back yet?

169
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:14,909
He said yesterday that he
was going to Senthil's house.

170
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,942
It's his daughter's birthday today.

171
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,840
Maybe he's gone there.

172
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay.

173
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:30,367
I told you, ma, he's
gone to Senthil's house.

174
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,783
Call Senthil, son

175
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,440
You know Senthil can't stand me,

176
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,280
and you still want me to call him?

177
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,909
He is such a nuisance

178
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:44,814
- I'll dial. Will you speak?
- No, no, you do it.

179
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,199
Sir...

180
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:49,398
Are you feeling better?
Can you talk?

181
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,200
How's your hip?

182
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,000
Sir...

183
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,560
Try to talk.

184
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,000
Should we go to the cops?

185
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,015
No, it'll become a problem.

186
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,080
They'll turn around and
accuse us. Forget it.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,440
Sir!

188
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,800
Can you remember anything?

189
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,682
Can you hear me?
Please try. You're fine.

190
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,840
How long will we keep him here?

191
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,640
Who'll be responsible if
something happens to him?

192
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,200
Keep quiet!
It's getting too messy.

193
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,760
He's conscious!

194
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,221
Sir!

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,960
My hip hurts.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't worry, we'll go to the hospital.

197
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,600
Is there anyone we can call?

198
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,960
A phone number?

199
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,807
Such arrogance!

200
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:03,494
Does it hurt you to
make one phone call?

201
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:06,438
Alright, ma, I'll call Senthil.
Don't yell.

202
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
Where's the knife?

203
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
Check near the grinder.

204
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:15,958
Who's this?

205
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,650
Yes, speaking.

206
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,520
Yes, he's my uncle.

207
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,240
- When?
- What happened?

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
Where?

209
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,960
What?

210
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,118
What happened?

211
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Okay, we're coming.

212
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,166
Ma, uncle's had
an accident. Mani!

213
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:38,280
I told you. Did you listen?

214
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,400
What happened?

215
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,560
Call Pachai! Uncle's
had an accident!

216
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
Ask for the tempo.

217
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,200
I knew something was wrong!

218
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:47,263
What happened?

219
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,056
The protest will last 10 days.

220
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:51,704
Saiyesh, how many have you called?

221
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,400
I've spoken to 30-35 people

222
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,680
But only 10-15 will come.

223
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:58,205
They laugh when I ask.

224
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:01,920
We need to explain
why we're protesting.

225
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,360
Retirement benefits
have been withdrawn.

226
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,168
What will the workers do now?

227
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,267
One second.

228
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,800
Tell me, Muruga.

229
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,221
What?

230
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,584
Oh God!

231
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:33,008
- Call Pachai!
- Pachai, hurry! Lift him.

232
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,337
Oh God!

233
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:37,806
Gently, gently.
Mani get down.

234
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,273
Mani, lift him!

235
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,158
Just bear it.

236
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,680
- Did you ask?
- Oh God!

237
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,120
- Have you checked his BP?
- Yes, doctor.

238
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,846
Who's with Karuppasamy?
The doctor wants to see you.

239
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,129
Nothing...nothing

240
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:17,567
Greetings, doctor.

241
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:19,692
- Are you his family?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:20,932
Come with me.

243
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,402
His hip is shattered.

244
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,592
We have to operate.

245
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,589
Will he walk again, if we operate?

246
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:34,389
- He's healthy. Is he around 65?
- Must be, doctor.

247
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,701
If we operate now, he'll live
at least another 10 years.

248
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,758
- Do we have to operate?
- Yes, absolutely.

249
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll have to check with
his son about that.

250
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,513
- Who are you, then?
- His nephews.

251
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,566
Ask him to come at once.

252
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,717
Let's go, pa.

253
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,774
I'm ready.
Call your mother.

254
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,551
Ma, let's go.

255
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,105
What a pain!

256
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,537
Tell me, Muruga.

257
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:09,484
"Your father's had an
accident. Come at once."

258
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,125
Accident? 
When?

259
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
We don't know.

260
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,138
We got a call saying
he'd had an accident.

261
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:19,120
We've admitted him to Dharani Clinic.
Hurry and come.

262
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:21,310
"I'm going out."

263
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,701
He needs an operation.
You have to come.

264
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
That's not possible.
Bring him here.

265
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,388
"To the village?"

266
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,120
"How can I bring him
from town to the village?"

267
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,935
Why, don't we have hospitals here?
It'll be cheaper, too.

268
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:37,238
Bring him.
Hang up, now.

269
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Hey! Hey! Senth-

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,920
- What's he saying?
- He hung up!

271
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:21,222
1500 rupees! 
Are you kidding?

272
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,355
I do all the work.
You're paying so little?

273
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,080
If you want more,
you find the people.

274
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,600
If I do, that's all I'll pay.

275
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,715
- Can you help? He's hurt.
- Hurry, Mani.

276
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,360
My hip hurts. I can't sit.

277
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,880
What happened?

278
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:41,675
Accident. 
Watch his hip.

279
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Senthil, I can't bear the pain.

280
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,230
- Greetings
- Yes come in.

281
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:23,671
It's a fracture. There's no
option. You have to operate.

282
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,640
An operation will
be expensive, doctor.

283
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,035
Not really,

284
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,238
but otherwise, he'll 
never walk again.

285
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,880
His hip bone is broken.

286
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,668
If you see a doctor
now, it can be fixed.

287
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:44,240
Can you fix it
without operating?

288
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,347
No, we don't have the facilities.

289
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
We can't afford it.

290
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:54,631
But if he can't walk, you'll
have to look after him.

291
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,800
Consider that, too.

292
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,060
We will operate him in that hospital.
Why is he unwanted travelling?

293
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,298
I can't.

294
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,280
Nothing uncle
Don't worry.

295
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,480
What happened?

296
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,033
You took him away this
morning, and now you're back.

297
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,304
They said we have
to operate.

298
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,164
I told you that in the morning.

299
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,702
Why did you take him away?

300
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:56,574
It's still not too late. Admit him
to a specialty hospital.

301
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
That will be expensive.

302
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:00,896
Who said that?

303
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,760
Bring me his residence
and income proof papers.

304
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,028
We'll insure him under the
Chief Minister's Welfare Scheme

305
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,520
and the operation will be free.

306
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:13,144
Where will I get those documents?

307
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,289
Ask the Revenue Collector's office.

308
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,320
- Bring them quickly.
- Okay, doctor.

309
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,640
Your poor father.

310
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,480
Don't drag him around anymore.

311
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:26,528
Go get the papers.
We'll handle things here.

312
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,400
That side.

313
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,240
Little

314
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,880
Bear it, uncle.

315
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,320
I told him then. 
Who's listening?

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
- Muruga...
- Come, Veera.

317
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,648
- Coming from union?
- What did the doctor say?

318
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,640
He gave tablets for the pain.

319
00:23:05,696 --> 00:23:07,616
He took them, and slept.

320
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,360
Uncle.

321
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,320
Uncle

322
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
Who is it?

323
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Veera? Come.

324
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
What's all this?

325
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,480
Shouldn't you watch
where you're going?

326
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,840
How's the pain now?

327
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,720
Much better,

328
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,880
now that you're here.

329
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,800
You'll be okay.

330
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,080
You're the one
who keeps saying,

331
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,240
'I'm not a moth, I'm a firefly.'

332
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm a firefly alright.

333
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,240
Let the operation get done.

334
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
Then we'll play leapfrog.

335
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,560
Let's see who wins.

336
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,680
You will, uncle.
Where's the doubt?

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
Fine uncle.

338
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,720
I've been invited to
a protest out of town.

339
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,920
A group of us is leaving tonight.

340
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,080
- I'll be back soon.
- When?

341
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,680
I'll be back in 10 days.

342
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,640
Your operation will be done by then.

343
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,880
I'll be back soon.
Rest now. Sleep.

344
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,120
Mani, come here.
Where's Murugan?

345
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,000
He's gone to the shop.

346
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,320
No, no, I have money.

347
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,640
Take it, for medicines.

348
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,760
Keep me posted. 
I'll call Murugan.

349
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
Drive carefully.

350
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,320
Uncle, will you have some juice?

351
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,400
I can't take the pain.

352
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,520
I'll ask the doctor for some tablets.

353
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,760
- Doctor.
- Yes?

354
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,800
He's been crying
from pain for 2 days.

355
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,080
- Does it hurt?
- Unbearably, doctor.

356
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,080
He's been saying
this all night, doctor.

357
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,840
I can give him painkillers,

358
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,160
but we need to operate.

359
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,400
What took so long?
Did you get the papers?

360
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,960
I thought about it. Doctor?

361
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,960
I can't come here every
day from the village.

362
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,480
So I'm taking him home.

363
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,160
Home? He can't even turn!

364
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,400
And you want to take him home!

365
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,320
What were you doing for 5 days?

366
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,800
It's impossible to get 
those documents.

367
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,680
There's a good traditional
healer in the village.

368
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,560
He says he'll mend the fracture.

369
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,640
With what, superglue?

370
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:54,818
If we don't operate now,
he'll never walk again.

371
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,053
It's your call.

372
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,760
Listen to the doctor.

373
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
I know how to look after my father.

374
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,037
Don't teach me. 
Shut it.

375
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,760
Easy, go slow.

376
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,600
Stop, Pachai!
Mani, pick him up gently.

377
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:01,196
Oh God!

378
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,280
- Pachai, take his legs.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,920
Hold his legs gently.

380
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
- Get down now.
- Will you hold him?

381
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,560
Lift him gently.

382
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,160
We're home.

383
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
- In this room?
- No, come ahead.

384
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,920
- This one?
- No, no, come further.

385
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,080
- Where, here?
- There.

386
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,440
Gently...gently

387
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,680
Gently mani.

388
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,320
Pachai, lay the mat down. 
Hurry!

389
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,360
Lift him from there.

390
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Ask pillow.

391
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,400
Get me a pillow.

392
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,560
Gently.
Nothing uncle.

393
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,480
Where's the pillow?

394
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,240
Nothing to worry.

395
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,040
Just lift his head

396
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,800
Lie down.

397
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,360
Nothing.

398
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Take care of yourself.
We'll leave now.

399
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,160
Could you -

400
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,240
Okay, go.

401
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,520
- What?
- No, nothing.

402
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,320
- You were saying something?
- Nothing.

403
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
Okay, look after yourself.
I'll be back soon.

404
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay.

405
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
Let me know if
there's anything else.

406
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,520
Senthil.

407
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
Like we don't have 
enough trouble.

408
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,960
- Why did you bring him here?
- What do you want me to do?

409
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,120
You should have left
him at your aunt's.

410
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,480
Why dump him here?

411
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,360
They'd take care of him.

412
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,160
He gives them all his money.

413
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,800
- I'd still have to take care of him.
- So? Am I just sitting around?

414
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,040
I also go to work, don't I?

415
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,600
Now I have to take
care of him, too.

416
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Senthil.

417
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Senthil.

418
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,840
We have to pay school fees,

419
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
buy new books, uniforms.

420
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,040
There's gas and light bills.
Where's the money?

421
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,680
I won't cook for him.

422
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,400
I won't clean him up.
It's just rice gruel for him.

423
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,920
- Shut up!
- What should I do?

424
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,480
- I'm hungry.
- Go away! Nuisance!

425
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,920
Senthil.

426
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,000
What? Why are you yelling?

427
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,520
I can't take the pain, son.

428
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,120
Take me to the hospital.

429
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,760
I'll have the operation done.

430
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,880
- That's not possible.
- Why not, son?

431
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,680
What do you mean why not?

432
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,840
Who has the money for an operation?

433
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,880
But that doctor said it's free.

434
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,200
Only the operation will be free.

435
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,920
I'll have to bribe everyone

436
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,040
from the village officer
to the ward boy.

437
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,200
Such a nuisance

438
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,800
Leave me at your
aunt's house, then.

439
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,200
She'll take care of me.

440
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,320
We'll handle all
the expenses, too.

441
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Is this a game to you?

442
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,880
As it is, Murugan can't stand me.

443
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,800
Will you humiliate me
more by going there?

444
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,640
Stay here quietly.
Don't pull my leg.

445
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,160
At least call Veera.

446
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,600
He'll look after me.

447
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,680
Don't make me beg, son.

448
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,960
Nagamma! One minute.

449
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,320
What?

450
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,600
What?

451
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,240
- My father's bedridden.
- So?

452
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Will you come and
clean him every day?

453
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,560
How much will you pay?

454
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,280
25 rupees a day.

455
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,225
Who'll do it for 25 rupees?

456
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:33,681
In this day and age,
nobody'll work for 25 rupees.

457
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,144
Who'll work for 25 rupees?

458
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,041
Okay, 35 rupees.

459
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,048
Nobody'll come for
35 rupees either.

460
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:45,779
You just have to wipe him down.

461
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,960
You can do that yourself.
Why ask me?

462
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,176
Okay, 45 rupees.

463
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:54,072
No, add 5 and make it 50.

464
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:58,319
No, I can't. I'm busy.

465
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,710
Take 45, just come
and clean him up.

466
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:05,383
If you add 5 and make it 50,
I'll do it,

467
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:07,806
otherwise I'll be on my way.

468
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,600
If you want to save 5 rupees,
you can do it yourself.

469
00:35:12,503 --> 00:35:13,783
Alright, 50 rupees.

470
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,360
You should have agreed upfront.

471
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,560
He's there. 
Clean him up.

472
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,240
- Who is it?
- I've come to clean you up.

473
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:31,728
No. Go away.

474
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:34,506
Let me do it.

475
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,951
- No.
- Turn.

476
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,406
Turn. I have other work.

477
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,390
I won't hurt you.

478
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:08,014
Write, child.

479
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:14,768
Tell me, bro.

480
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,553
Hang on.

481
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:17,904
Have you fed him?

482
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,670
Enough.

483
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,120
I'll call you after dinner.

484
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,160
- Darshini.
- What, ma?

485
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,440
Come here.

486
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,960
Give it to him.

487
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,920
Child

488
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Child

489
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,960
Come here, child.

490
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,000
It's grandpa.

491
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,800
See what grandpa bought you

492
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,080
For your birthday.

493
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Here.

494
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,680
No?

495
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,680
Why not, child? Look.

496
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
Do you like it?

497
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,520
Here.

498
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,760
3,500 rupees?

499
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Come in.

500
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,240
This is sudden.

501
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,480
I came to see your father.

502
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
He's lying down.

503
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,680
It's so hot!

504
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,920
Careful, watch your step.

505
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,520
Senthil.

506
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,280
Why are you shouting, pa?

507
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,240
Menmozhi aunt's here.

508
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,200
You're well out of it.

509
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,840
Menmozhi!

510
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,120
Menmozhi!

511
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,360
Oh god!

512
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,400
You chat.
I'm going to work.

513
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,680
Come, sit.

514
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Stella, ready?

515
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
What a state you're in!

516
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
Come, sit.

517
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,720
Is there no place for you
in such a big house -

518
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,800
What a fate.

519
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,760
I'm not blaming anyone.

520
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,000
God protect you.

521
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,040
What happened to my job?

522
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,000
They've paid for the month.

523
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,640
Here, use it for
fruits and medicines.

524
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,760
Don't give it to your son.

525
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll keep it under your pillow.

526
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,320
Why are you so quiet?

527
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,440
Is Senthil taking care of you?

528
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,480
Very well.

529
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,400
 Like a king.

530
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,160
He's hired a woman to look after me.

531
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,640
And yet you're like this?

532
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,160
If there's a problem,
I'll take care of you.

533
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,360
There's no problem.

534
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,640
A traditional healer's
coming tomorrow.

535
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,160
They say he'll fix my hip.

536
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Then, you watch.

537
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,480
I'll come home,

538
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,080
and eat fish curry again.

539
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,360
I'll make it for you every day.

540
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,600
You get well quickly
and come home.

541
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,880
Shall I leave now?

542
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,680
Could you ask Veera to visit?

543
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,240
I'll tell him.

544
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,720
He'll take care of me.

545
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,240
Look after yourself.

546
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,360
Careful with the money.

547
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,480
- Tell Veera.
- I'll tell him without fail.

548
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,520
Okay!

549
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,760
- Didn't go to work, Mani?
- I'm leaving now.

550
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,160
Where did you get
the greens from, ma?

551
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:53,023
I get nearby home

552
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,640
Come, come, Veera.

553
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,680
- Tea?
- Yes.

554
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,440
Could you make him some tea?

555
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,360
Did you go see uncle, ma?

556
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,680
I went yesterday.

557
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,920
He said he was okay,

558
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,720
but I didn't get that feeling.

559
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Why? Senthil said they'd operate.

560
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,800
He didn't allow it.

561
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,520
He took him home, saying
he'd hire a traditional healer.

562
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,400
I don't know what he's done.

563
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,960
Damn! How's he now, ma?

564
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,480
I don't know.

565
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,120
He won't say what's on his mind,

566
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,040
but he can't hide it either.

567
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,440
He kept asking for you.

568
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,120
Shall I go see him, then?

569
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Yeah. Don't talk to Senthil

570
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,000
- Yes
- Talk to uncle only

571
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,520
Why would I?

572
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,880
Why's he calling?

573
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,840
Who?

574
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,960
Tell me, Senthil.

575
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,640
I called to tell you
Father passed away.

576
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,360
What is it?

577
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,080
- How?
- What is it, son?

578
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,840
It was a good death.

579
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,520
He went peacefully, in his sleep.

580
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,880
- What is it?
- The funeral's at 6 pm.

581
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,200
Tell your mother.

582
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,000
I'll hang up now.

583
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
- Oh Lord, what will I do now?
- What happened?

584
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,040
Uncle's dead.

585
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,840
What?! When?

586
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,720
Your uncle died.

587
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,040
How?

588
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,000
He says he died in his sleep.

589
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,000
I knew he wouldn't

590
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,040
I knew he didn't do for him

591
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,480
He was fine when
I saw him yesterday.

592
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,280
What will I do now?

593
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,680
You left me

594
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,200
My brother, when
will I see you again?

595
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Where shall I search for you?

596
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,640
We were born of the same womb.

597
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,600
I saw you just yesterday.

598
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,520
You were fine.

599
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,360
He was a good man.

600
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,240
He taught me how to
live, and now he's dead.

601
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,160
All of us have to die.

602
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,920
But how many die peacefully
in their sleep like this?

603
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,600
You killed him needlessly.

604
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,480
You didn't let him
be even 2 days.

605
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,880
Grandma, Uncle died in his sleep.

606
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,560
No, son, he was killed.

607
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
Killed?

608
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,360
Veera, he murdered him.

609
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,120
Shut up, old woman!

610
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,720
Keep quiet.

611
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,200
Who killed him?

612
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,520
That one, there, killed him

613
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,360
with a lethal injection.

614
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,520
Killed him?

615
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,840
Hush, he wasn't well.

616
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,640
Uncle, is this true?

617
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,440
No, don't make a scene here.

618
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,320
Who's making a scene?

619
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,720
Hey, who killed my uncle?

620
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,080
Keep your voice down.

621
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,280
What do you know?

622
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,400
Who killed my uncle?

623
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,040
Keep quite

624
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,000
You don't talk.

625
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,640
Who will if I don't?

626
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
What did you do?

627
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,920
Who killed my uncle?

628
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,000
He died naturally.

629
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,280
She says you killed him.

630
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,200
And you believe her?

631
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,840
How did he die?

632
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,760
Do what you came for, and leave.

633
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,600
You don't interfere.

634
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,240
One second. What is it?

635
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,760
Pay your respects, and leave.

636
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,880
He was my uncle!

637
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,880
How dare you interfere to this?

638
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,040
Senthil!

639
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,120
If you killed my uncle -

640
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,920
If it's true you killed my uncle,

641
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,640
I'll burn this village down!

642
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,840
Bugger off!

643
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,160
How dare you come here
and insult me, you dog!

644
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,560
Don't talk without knowledge

645
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,120
If I find that was you 
I will kill you

646
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,736
(Lamenting)

647
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,600
Granny.

648
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,960
- Who is it?
- Veera.

649
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,960
- When did you arrive?
- Just now.

650
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,280
Sit.

651
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,480
(Calling cattle)

652
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,085
Mariakka, come here.

653
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,040
- Excuse me.
- Who is it?

654
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,160
- How are you?
- I'm good.

655
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,120
You said that Senthil
had his father killed.

656
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,400
How do you know?

657
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,320
The whole village
is talking about it.

658
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,520
About what?

659
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,680
Thalaikoothal.

660
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,080
We've done it ourselves.

661
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,800
- Really?
- Yes

662
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,960
About 10 years ago,

663
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,320
I came home from work,

664
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,880
and found that my wife
had done it to my mother.

665
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,600
But I don't blame her,

666
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,240
because my mother had
been sick for a long time.

667
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,360
We tried everything.

668
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,120
I was thinking of doing it
myself, but she did it.

669
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,720
When a person's been ill
for a long time,

670
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,720
the family members call me.

671
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,200
I give the person

672
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,800
a cold water head bath,

673
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,120
and lots of tender coconut water

674
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,960
until they get a fever.

675
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,080
Within 3 days, they pass away.

676
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,640
It's a custom here.

677
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,480
- Since when?
- Since my grandmother's time.

678
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,040
One must live happily.

679
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,280
What kind of life is it to be
dependent and miserable?

680
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,760
How much do you charge?

681
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,480
I don't charge.

682
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,520
It's a service.

683
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,080
It's better to ease their pain
and let them go.

684
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,080
They mix mud and water

685
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,480
into a thick paste.

686
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,360
They push that down the
throat, and suffocate them.

687
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,160
Some people ask to be killed

688
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,640
with mud from their own land.

689
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,160
It gives peace to their souls.

690
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,560
So many ways to kill...

691
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,240
They say there are
26 ways.

692
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,800
- Really?
- Yes.

693
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,160
They choke them with
hard snacks and sweet buns,

694
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720
feed them milk laced with thorns,

695
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,560
pesticides.

696
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,800
There are 26 ways to kill.

697
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,360
Hundreds of people are killed
in our village every year

698
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,920
If elders get a headache,

699
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,760
they run away from home.

700
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I can't work. I have arthritis,

701
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,800
so I tend the cattle.

702
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,840
Why don't you stay with your son?

703
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,520
My son's a struggling
daily wage laborer.

704
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,520
Rather than die
at his hands, I left.

705
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,040
They say uncle was killed
by lethal injection, right?

706
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,240
Who did it?

707
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,800
They say a woman
who works as

708
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,440
support staff in
a hospital did it.

709
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,640
There's a broker here
called Rajan who does this.

710
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,120
It's his trade.
In Senthil's father's case,

711
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,800
they say he used a
woman called Meena...

712
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,400
to give him a lethal injection.

713
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,400
Doesn't anyone go to the cops?

714
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,840
Don't they have to
come back home?

715
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,760
Nobody does it.

716
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,760
- Why not?
- Complaints won't work.

717
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,560
The cops know everything.

718
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,120
Nobody's going to talk.

719
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,600
The cops will say it's a family
matter, and close the case.

720
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,280
We just have to accept it.

721
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
Okay.

722
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,640
Okay

723
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,240
Thank you very much.

724
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,120
Don't repeat what I said
about Senthil's father.

725
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,840
No

726
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,800
I just told you what
the villagers are saying.

727
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,160
'To: The Police Superintendent,
Srivaipuram, TN Police'

728
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,160
'Subject: The Killing of K. Karuppasamy'

729
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,920
'My uncle was killed under the guise
of 'Thalaikoothal', or mercy killing,'

730
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:25,080
'at the behest of his
own son, K. Senthil.'

731
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,840
'However, this was no mercy killing,'

732
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,120
'but cold-blooded murder.'

733
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,720
Veera, stop!

734
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,880
Tell me

735
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,800
What happened
to that problem?

736
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,800
Uncle's case?

737
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,120
They've been jerking me
around for the last 5 days.

738
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,920
I wrote to the police.

739
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,320
They keep putting me off.

740
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,280
I was there yesterday
from morning till 5 pm.

741
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,080
There's no response.

742
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,960
Veera, this is your battle.
You have to lead.

743
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,320
Don't depend on anyone else.

744
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,360
You keep going alone, understand?

745
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,920
Okay. It's getting late.

746
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,800
Come and eat.

747
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,280
- Next time.
- Come, eat

748
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,480
- Okay. Give Murugan my regards.
- OKay

749
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,840
Bring the salt.

750
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,640
- Aren't you eating?
- In a bit. You start.

751
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,760
Bring the pickle, too.

752
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
Did you bring in the stuff
drying on the terrace?

753
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,280
Yes.

754
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,240
Sit, and eat.

755
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,960
What's this?

756
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,840
- Sit and eat.
- I'll just change.

757
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,080
Later. Eat first.

758
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,720
Give him his food.

759
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,520
- It's uncle.
- Let's see.

760
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,960
Show him

761
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,800
Ma, give me that plate.

762
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,080
Here, ma.

763
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,640
Bless his cheerful face.

764
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,240
You didn't choose one
of him in uniform?

765
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,160
He looks so young in this.

766
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,480
I chose it because he's smiling.

767
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,040
It's nice, ma.

768
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,560
He's left us and gone.

769
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,040
Put this on the shelf.

770
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,200
Give it to me.

771
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,040
What happened?

772
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,000
What are you thinking about?

773
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,760
Why?

774
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,840
The cops are ignoring my complaints.

775
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,600
Can you hurry these things?

776
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,840
You're impatient, like your father.

777
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,080
Nothing happens overnight. 
Eat.

778
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,880
- I complained 5 days ago.
- So what?

779
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,960
- Why get tense?
- I keep going there.

780
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,800
- They just don't respond.
- It takes time.

781
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,760
If I let it go now, the issue
will never come out.

782
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,520
Such impatience!

783
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,560
Mani, hand me the newspaper.

784
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,000
Why do you want the
paper during dinner?

785
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,120
If I shout, even our
dog won't get up.

786
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,080
But the right people
will shake the world.

787
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,560
'To bhaskar@kalaipuyal.com'

788
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,080
'Please find attached a copy
of my police complaint'

789
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,720
'to which there has been no response.'

790
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,960
'...my letter to the State
Human Rights Commission'

791
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:50,969
'to which, also, there
has been no reply.'

792
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,840
Hello?

793
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,799
Mr. Veera?
I read your mail.

794
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,440
This news should go big.

795
00:58:34,488 --> 00:58:35,608
Okay, sir.

796
00:58:35,672 --> 00:58:37,632
But we're a small publication.

797
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:40,439
If we cover it, it won't
reach everyone.

798
00:58:40,468 --> 00:58:41,532
Oh!

799
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,309
Let me see what I can do.

800
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,880
Okay, sir, thank you.

801
00:58:57,353 --> 00:58:58,376
Hello, Mr. Veera?

802
00:58:58,439 --> 00:58:59,839
Who's calling?

803
00:58:59,897 --> 00:59:02,423
This is the editor of the National
Debate newspaper in Chennai.

804
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:03,540
Tell me, sir.

805
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:07,022
I've received your police complaint.
It's a big story.

806
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:09,391
We're printing it tomorrow.

807
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,462
- Give me an ND paper.
- Take it.

808
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:15,079
We're sending a
reporter to investigate.

809
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,560
- Tea?
- Yes.

810
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,560
They'll call you tomorrow.

811
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:33,540
Hello!

812
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,071
Hello. Mr. Veera?

813
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,704
Yes, who's this?

814
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,712
Deepa, National Debate,
Chennai reporter.

815
00:59:41,753 --> 00:59:43,313
Tell me, ma'am.

816
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,431
Everyone knows Meena,

817
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,280
even in the neighboring villages.

818
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:39,416
Even little children
threaten their grandparents.

819
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:42,165
If you nag, I'll call Meena.

820
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,813
She'll give you a poison injection.

821
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:45,982
So everyone knows her.

822
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:48,921
She works in a hospital.

823
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:52,962
People call her to dispatch
the elderly with an injection.

824
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,240
You need to be careful.

825
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,587
One important matter

826
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:57,551
You don't get any problem for it

827
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:07,999
Yes?

828
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,400
I need a medicine,

829
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,800
but this is the wrong shop.

830
01:01:12,864 --> 01:01:15,224
Which medicine?

831
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,600
We have everything.

832
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,045
We have a rat problem.

833
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:22,232
I came for some poison.

834
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,334
Is someone not well -

835
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,310
Hey! Always babbling.
Get out!

836
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,800
What do you want?

837
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,646
My grandmother's not well.

838
01:01:32,711 --> 01:01:34,631
I thought I'd give her a tablet.

839
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,435
Who said you'd get it here?

840
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,440
Where are you from?
I've never seen you before.

841
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,560
I'm from the next village.

842
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,920
I'm visiting my cousin.

843
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,904
I told her grandma's not well.

844
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:47,847
She told me I could get it here.

845
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,464
How much is a tablet for?

846
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,879
Only 10 rupees, but I can't sell it

847
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,800
without a prescription.

848
01:01:53,842 --> 01:01:56,842
Go see Compounder Ganesan.

849
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,123
Hello!

850
01:02:02,183 --> 01:02:04,583
- Ganesa, where are you?
- In the forest.

851
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,662
Boss!

852
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,840
- Ganesa!
- Yeah, come.

853
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,080
They're here. 
I'll call you back.

854
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:17,138
Come!

855
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,080
This is her.

856
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:24,191
What?

857
01:02:24,248 --> 01:02:26,728
I need some medicine.

858
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,600
They said you'd give
me a prescription.

859
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:32,091
You can't decide whether 
it'll be injection or tablet.

860
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,200
We do that. 
Right?

861
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,287
Yes!

862
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,600
What else can I do?

863
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:43,341
There are lots of
ways to do this.

864
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,177
Go meet Rajan.

865
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:50,443
He'll see your grandmother,
and discuss rates and methods.

866
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,530
Come

867
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,440
No, that'll be too expensive.

868
01:02:53,488 --> 01:02:57,968
But the tree will fall silently.
There'll be no risk to you.

869
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:01,060
No, just give me the prescription.

870
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,040
Is this cat killing a rat?

871
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,568
It's a human being.

872
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:08,680
If the cops come,
who'll be responsible?

873
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:13,429
If you do the job in 10 rupees, 
what are we here for?

874
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,156
- Take her!
- Come.

875
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:22,476
Hurry!

876
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:28,421
6,000 rupees. I need
an advance of 2,000.

877
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,600
I don't have that much.

878
01:03:33,025 --> 01:03:35,851
You're asking me to kill someone.

879
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,591
Do you know how risky it is?

880
01:03:45,505 --> 01:03:48,421
What was the name of
that man last week?

881
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,520
- Karuppasamy, boss.
- Karuppasamy!

882
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,187
8,000 was the fee.

883
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,640
He was dead in 4 hours.

884
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,898
I've already given you
a discount of 2,000.

885
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:02,257
It's risky to get those injections.

886
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,320
Understand?

887
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,840
Give me an advance of 2,000.
I'll start the work.

888
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,720
What was the name of
that man last week?

889
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:29,734
- Karuppasamy, boss.
- Karuppasamy!

890
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:32,464
8,000 was the fee.

891
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,800
He was dead in 4 hours.

892
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,742
You're in the papers today.

893
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,742
What do they say?

894
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,148
Hide your syringes, or you'll hang.

895
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,800
Thalaikoothal is a
traditional form of senicide

896
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,400
which is practiced in
more than 40 villages

897
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,480
in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu.

898
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,520
It is practiced by the members
of the family themselves.

899
01:04:51,584 --> 01:04:54,144
They feel burdened.

900
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:56,761
They don't like old people's habits.

901
01:04:56,808 --> 01:04:59,507
They wander off, and are messy.

902
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,920
It's burdensome.

903
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:04,776
So they think, 'If we do
something so they die,

904
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:08,086
'we can live peacefully.'
So they do it.

905
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:11,174
It's awful to take a life,

906
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:14,832
but it's also hard to 
see them suffer.

907
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:18,515
They have trouble
sleeping and breathing.

908
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,520
So it's a good thing,

909
01:05:20,576 --> 01:05:24,536
but killing is problematic, too.

910
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,640
Why do we have children?

911
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,560
So they'll care for us at the end

912
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,880
as we cared for them,

913
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,720
and wash our clothes.

914
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,520
That's why we have children.

915
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,400
That's why we have children,

916
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,320
not so they can kill us.

917
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,960
'Today, we're discussing Thalaikoothal'

918
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,800
'and the killing of K. Karuppasamy.'

919
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,040
Everyone knows he did it.

920
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:54,515
At first, we were told that

921
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,520
my uncle died of natural causes.

922
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,440
So we went to the funeral.

923
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,600
There, we heard that

924
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,560
his own son had him killed.

925
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,160
So everybody knows that he did
it in the name of Thalaikoothal.

926
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:07,363
Look it

927
01:06:07,424 --> 01:06:08,944
Who did involved..

928
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,680
- What's this?
- Senthil, my cousin,

929
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:14,707
- See what Veera's done.
- His wife,

930
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,280
and 3 other people

931
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,880
planned the murder.

932
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:20,668
I should have broken 
his legs that day.

933
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,383
Keep quiet.

934
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,718
I only learnt later that
this was being done

935
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,080
in the name of Thalaikoothal.

936
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,480
I found out after my uncle's death

937
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,280
I found out after my uncle's death

938
01:06:29,312 --> 01:06:30,769
He's on TV.

939
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,480
Will it be a problem?

940
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:34,599
No. The whole village does it.

941
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,040
Just keep quiet.

942
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,640
When Senthil got married,

943
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,933
my uncle gave him the house,
and moved in with us.

944
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,668
After the accident, we said
we'd take care of him

945
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,240
and the expenses.

946
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,949
That hurt Senthil's ego.

947
01:06:48,992 --> 01:06:52,880
He felt that people would talk that
he didn't take care of his father.

948
01:06:52,936 --> 01:06:55,269
When I learnt of the killing,
I went to the police.

949
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:56,999
I can't bear his face.

950
01:06:59,399 --> 01:07:01,660
I told you he'd make trouble.

951
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:04,371
Forget it, it's not that serious.

952
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,840
- What's your name?
- Senthil.

953
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,680
- Where do you work?
- I'm a fitter in a spinning mill, sir.

954
01:07:18,728 --> 01:07:20,528
How much did you pay to
have your father killed?

955
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:22,408
Why would I kill my father, sir?

956
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,543
You paid Rajan 8,000 rupees
to kill your father.

957
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,680
I didn't kill anyone.

958
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,231
What do you mean?

959
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,560
I don't know anything about a killing.

960
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,160
Here, listen.

961
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,760
What was the name
of that man last week?

962
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,040
- Karuppasamy, boss.
- Karuppasamy!

963
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,746
8,000 was the fee.

964
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:39,973
He was dead in 4 hours.

965
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,960
I've already given you
a discount of 2,000.

966
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,320
That's not my voice, sir.

967
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,440
How do you make your money?

968
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:50,377
You kill old people for money.

969
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,840
- I don't understand.
- What?

970
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:54,348
I don't know anything.

971
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,240
What?

972
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,480
Do you know Meena?

973
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,040
No.

974
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,200
Is she your wife, or your keep?

975
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:02,016
Are you pimping her?

976
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:02,910
Who's Rajan?

977
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,720
Thousands of people
come to the hospital, sir.

978
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,738
And Rajan's such a common name.

979
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,191
Your father died.
Did you tonsure your head?

980
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:12,144
I'm looking for a job in Dubai.
I can't go bald to interviews.

981
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,400
We know how to get the truth.

982
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:18,976
We'll hang you up,
and make you talk.

983
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,960
Will you talk or not?

984
01:08:21,024 --> 01:08:22,224
Who did this killing?

985
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,360
I'll tell you, sir.

986
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:24,688
I'll tear you apart.

987
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,600
How long have you known Rajan?

988
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:29,896
Speak!

989
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,613
- 5 years.
- How?

990
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:35,473
He used to be my money lender.

991
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,440
One day, he said 'There's a way

992
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,729
to make some quick money.
Will you do it?'

993
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,080
What was it?

994
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,640
If I injected certain
people with poison,

995
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,240
he'd pay me 1,000 rupees.

996
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,080
I said, 'I'm not a nurse,

997
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,868
I don't know how to give injections.'

998
01:08:49,938 --> 01:08:50,969
So then?

999
01:08:51,023 --> 01:08:54,663
He gave me some money
and asked me to learn

1000
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,640
from GH Ganesan.

1001
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,280
Ganesan taught me

1002
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,760
how to give injections,

1003
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,120
and how the poisons worked.

1004
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,440
Her husband kept falling sick.

1005
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,240
They couldn't afford hospitals.

1006
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,920
She asked for an alternative.

1007
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,080
So I taught her how to
give glucose injections, sir.

1008
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,680
- Taught her!
- It's the truth, sir.

1009
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,000
How many people have you
killed with poison so far?

1010
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,280
Answer me!

1011
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,720
How many people have you killed?

1012
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,120
Write the names.

1013
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:32,600
- I can't write.
- But you can kill.

1014
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,360
- I'll tell you, you write it down.
- Tell me.

1015
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,560
Talk!

1016
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,480
Ramasami, last month.

1017
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,480
Then?

1018
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,280
Before that, Pechiakka.

1019
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,320
Next?

1020
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,240
Hurry up.

1021
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,520
Before that, Bhupathi.

1022
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,240
The last was Karuppasamy.

1023
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,680
Mettu street 
Karuppasamy.

1024
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,000
You've killed 21 people.

1025
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,000
How did you carry out
the Karuppasamy killing?

1026
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,200
Speak. What did you do?

1027
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,720
If you don't talk,

1028
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,240
I'll eliminate you in an encounter.

1029
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,480
How did you kill Karuppasamy?
Answer me!

1030
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,680
Tell me, Meena.

1031
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,320
You said you'd pay 2,500 rupees
if I brought a case. Pay me.

1032
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,200
- Why?
- I've found a case.

1033
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,280
Who? How do you know?

1034
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,880
I found out from my neighbor, Nagamma.
You know Senthil?

1035
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,520
Gopalan's nephew.
His father's bedridden.

1036
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,120
- Why, what happened?
- He broke his hip in an accident.

1037
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,560
Nagamma's been cleaning him up.

1038
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,000
He didn't want to pay
her 50 rupees a day.

1039
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,400
Will he spend money on medicines?

1040
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,520
The tree's rotten.
If you touch it, it'll fall.

1041
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,120
- Will you talk to him?
- Yes. Senthil is...?

1042
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,640
Gopalan's nephew.

1043
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,160
- Right. I'll talk to him.
- Let me know.

1044
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,680
Senthil.

1045
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,240
- Who is it?
- Sir, one minute.

1046
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,360
- What do you want?
- Come here.

1047
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,200
My name's Rajan.

1048
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,880
You don't know me,

1049
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,400
but I've seen you around.
Your uncle Gopalan is a friend.

1050
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,720
What do you want?

1051
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,880
I heard your father's bedridden.

1052
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,680
Was that him calling?

1053
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,560
What is it you want?
I'm late for work.

1054
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,360
I don't want anything.
I've come to help you.

1055
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,600
Help?

1056
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,200
With what?

1057
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,840
Medicines are expensive.

1058
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,480
Illness burdens the family.

1059
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,520
How will you take care of him

1060
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,240
and your family on your salary?

1061
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,040
What are you suggesting?

1062
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,960
A small expense, cheaper
than his medical care.

1063
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,720
You say okay, and
I'll handle everything.

1064
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,320
Senthil.

1065
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,640
How much?

1066
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,240
Give me 5,000. I'll finish it.

1067
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,920
5,000? Impossible.

1068
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,360
Wait, we're like brothers.

1069
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,000
Give me 3,500. I'll finish it quietly.

1070
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,440
3,500?

1071
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,360
Come, aunt.

1072
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,400
This is sudden.

1073
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,840
I came to see your father.

1074
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,400
Come, he's inside.

1075
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,560
1,500! You said
you'd pay 2,500.

1076
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,360
Keep your money!

1077
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,080
He's only paying 3,000.

1078
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,360
How can I pay you 2,500?

1079
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,160
This is how you
keep cheating me.

1080
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,040
If you want more, you should
have spoken to him directly.

1081
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,640
You can't, right?

1082
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,360
Keep the money.
He's called us at 11 pm.

1083
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,453
You and your head

1084
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:57,933
Cheat!

1085
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,320
Who's there?

1086
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,840
Senthil!

1087
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,240
Senthil!

1088
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,240
Who are you?

1089
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,400
Senthil!

1090
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,040
Don't hurt me.

1091
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,560
- Don't hurt me.
- Nothing

1092
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,720
Senthil!

1093
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,200
Don't hurt me.

1094
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,760
Senthil!

1095
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,040
Hurry! Hold his hand.

1096
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,040
Don't hurt me.

1097
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,920
Don't shout.

1098
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,240
Don't shout.

1099
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,320
Don't shout

1100
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,440
Give me the money.

1101
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,280
Hello. SP Sekhar.

1102
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,040
Home Minister.

1103
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,600
What's the status of
the Karuppasamy case?

1104
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,280
Sir, the enquiry's over. 
Next, we have to arrest the accused.

1105
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,280
Look, Mr. Sekhar,

1106
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,200
Thalaikoothal seems to
be a norm in that village.

1107
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,960
So, if you arrest one person,

1108
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,160
they'll all accuse each other.

1109
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,360
You'll have to arrest
the whole village.

1110
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:13,000
More importantly, the local
election is next month.

1111
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,240
We have to solve this
problem before that.

1112
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,320
Think it over.

1113
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,040
Sir, this is open news now.

1114
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,240
I don't know if I can control the press.

1115
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,120
You'll find a way.

1116
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,920
Hurry, I need to get home.

1117
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,160
Me, too.

1118
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,520
One second. Both of
you at the same time -

1119
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,760
Come, let's go

1120
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,920
What a bad omen!

1121
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,720
5 kilos of rice, 1 litre of oil -

1122
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,160
We don't have it.
Shop somewhere else.

1123
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,440
Ants never break formation.

1124
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,880
What time should I come, sir?

1125
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,040
Okay, I'll be there at 7.30 pm.

1126
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,640
- Will the Sub-Inspector be there?
- Give me some water.

1127
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,400
Okay, I'll be there. 
Thank you.

1128
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,800
- Who was that?
- The police station.

1129
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,840
Who were you talking to?

1130
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,920
- The editor, Ram.
- There's no need.

1131
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,800
Enough of this running
around about uncle's death.

1132
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:17,640
He hasn't eaten or
slept in 3 months.

1133
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,760
And that's not all.
Can we show our faces outside?

1134
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,080
Women who used
to fear my voice

1135
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,560
Now mock me to my face.

1136
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,160
Can this child go
out and play now?

1137
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,000
When I asked the
shopkeeper for oil,

1138
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,440
he insulted me.

1139
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,640
We've become refugees
in our own home.

1140
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,400
What do you want
me to do, ma?

1141
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,720
You can't change anything, son.

1142
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,880
You can't change the world.

1143
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,600
Your dead uncle's not
coming back either.

1144
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:51,071
Let it go. 
Listen to me.

1145
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:55,351
I won't loss all of 
you for this.

1146
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,880
Go, ma.

1147
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,360
Look at him anger.

1148
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,760
There's no evidence of murder.

1149
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,280
If we had the body,
the post mortem report...

1150
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,280
could have uncovered
some evidence.

1151
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,120
Since there's no proof,

1152
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,800
we're considering closing the case.

1153
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,760
Sir, is the sting operation on Rajan

1154
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,000
not enough proof?

1155
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,360
You can't say that.

1156
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,040
There's no proof that
Karuppasamy was killed.

1157
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,880
But Meena confessed, sir.

1158
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,560
That's what you in the media say.

1159
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,040
When we investigated in the village,

1160
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,840
people said that Meena
was only giving...

1161
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,880
glucose injections to the elderly.

1162
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,080
So we've come to the conclusion
that Karuppasamy's death

1163
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,240
was not a case of murder,

1164
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,760
but a natural death.

1165
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,520
Satisfied?

1166
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,680
This is what happens.
What can we do?

1167
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,840
Nobody was ever punished for
the killing of Karuppasamy.

1168
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,480
All set? Shall we leave?
Not forgotten anything?

1169
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,480
A few months later, 
Senthil got a job...

1170
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,680
and left with his family for Dubai.

1171
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,720
I never saw him again.

1172
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,840
I don't believe in God.

1173
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,080
But they say the
truth will prevail.

1174
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,360
I'm waiting.

1175
01:26:37,168 --> 01:26:41,074
'The Burden'
