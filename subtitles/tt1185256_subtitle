00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,455
Hi. My name is Visvak Sena.

4
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:09,491
It's a bit difficult
to pronounce, right?

5
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,757
It's not a common name.
That's why it sounds so.

6
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,096
What's the fun part is that
it's not my parents...

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,224
...who gave me that name.

8
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,362
My mother passed away even
before I can remember.

9
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,234
And my father...

10
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,541
Scoundrel, you are the
bad omen of my life.

11
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,266
Ever since you are born my life
is filled with misfortune.

12
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:26,436
I am unfortunate to
have a son like you.

13
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,782
You evil guy. You evil...

14
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,714
He used to think that my
birth itself is a curse.

15
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,548
Now how can you expect him
to think about my name!

16
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:38,247
It's master Shankaram
who gave me that name.

17
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,555
I don't know how God looks like...

18
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,862
...but if exists he'd definitely
look like master Shankaram.

19
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:46,192
Master Shankaram is the
bright spot of my life.

20
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,259
He's another name of humanity.

21
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,731
He was a teacher in Tangadipalli
primary school.

22
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:56,205
He loved kids a lot.

23
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:00,502
Salt and camphor...
- Salt and camphor...

24
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:04,481
...Iook alike.
...Iook alike.

25
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,279
...but their characteristics are...
...but their...

26
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,478
I used to herd the buffaloes...

27
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:10,488
...near the school and climb the wall
everyday to hear his lessons...

28
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,758
His way of teaching was
really quite stimulating.

29
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:19,228
A. AA.

30
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,524
And that's how I learnt
my first lessons.

31
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,434
I used to learn the lessons he
used to teach every morning.

32
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,243
One day...
- E. EE.

33
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:32,572
One day master saw me.

34
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,749
He came out of the school
searching me.

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,450
Hey, come here.

36
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,558
Is it you who wrote that?

37
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,397
You wrote it well.

38
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,332
You teach very well.
- Really?

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,374
So you are following
my lessons everyday.

40
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,841
Yesterday I heard the poem.
- Which poem?

41
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,674
Salt and camphor look alike.

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,477
Yes. - But their characteristics
are completely different. - Yes.

43
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:14,451
People might appear alike...

44
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:17,614
...but they are different in nature.

45
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:21,415
Great. Whose son are you?
- I am Subbayya's son.

46
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,295
You are that drunkard
Subbayya's son? - Yes.

47
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:26,331
What's your name?
- Hey, fool!

48
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,294
That's how my father calls me.

49
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,369
Anyway, shall I give you
a nice name? - Yes.

50
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:37,238
But in order to get a name
you have to pass a test.

51
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,743
Will you pass the test?
- Now say as I say.

52
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,247
Visvak Sen's son Kaskaskam Botlu...

53
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,750
...got on his horse and said...

54
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:51,256
Visvak Sen's son Kaskaskam Botlu...

55
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,690
...got on his horse and said...
- Great.

56
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,428
I knew that you could
say that, Visvak Sena.

57
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:00,259
That's why from today
onwards your name is...

58
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,527
...Visvak Sena. Will you study?

59
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,398
Yes.
- Come. Come.

60
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,832
Move a bit, girl. Sit here.

61
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,932
That was a day that could
never forget in my life.

62
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,973
I sat in a classroom for
the first time ever.

63
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,714
I was so happy.

64
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:17,940
He's a gem of a kid...

65
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,281
- Then master called my father
and reprimanded him...

66
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:24,550
I'll bash you up... ...and warned
him not to stop my studies.

67
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,487
Master bought new clothes
and books for me.

68
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,296
Not just in school, but
my master taught me...

69
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,423
...a number of things outside
the school as well.

70
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:36,459
He told me many stories with morals.

71
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:38,426
He read epics for me.

72
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,631
He told me many more such
wonderful things.

73
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,376
I was leading a beautiful
life in this way when...

74
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,306
Master. Master. Subbayya
fell in the pond...

75
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,743
...after getting drunk and died.

76
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,614
My father died.

77
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,820
I would've been an orphan
that day itself...

78
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,655
...but my master didn't
let that happen.

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,398
Why are you all this work?

80
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,402
Rangi, you are making this
kid clean the veranda.

81
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:13,870
I asked him not to, but he didn't
listen to me, sir. - Yes.

82
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:16,735
And in that way master looked
after me like his own child.

83
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,400
They made me not miss
my mother and father.

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,345
I finished my primary education...

85
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,473
...and for the secondary
education I joined...

86
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:28,778
...Koduru High School seven
kilometers from our village.

87
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,649
X=143.

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,990
I got my teachers' appreciation
their as well.

89
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,858
Great.
- You are a genius.

90
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,431
You should learn something from
him. Go and sit there. - Yes.

91
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,695
Don't think that you are
some sort of genius.

92
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,368
No matter what others
used to think...

93
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,909
...I was an genius in
all my teachers eyes.

94
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,943
August 15th is an important
day for our country.

95
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:56,673
Our independence day.

96
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,580
But the most important
day of my life is...

97
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,514
...16th July.

98
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:09,084
No, it's not my birthday.

99
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,398
On that particular day Shweta
entered my life...

100
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,523
...like a lightening. Shweta!

101
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,408
That day I was writing
the moral of that day...

102
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,534
...on the school board.

103
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,774
Stay here. I'll meet the
head-master. - Ok.

104
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:10,980
Hello!

105
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,818
Hello, Shweta.
- Good morning, ma'am.

106
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:17,019
Come in, dear.

107
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,996
Shweta's father runs
a business in Canada.

108
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,564
Shweta used to study there.

109
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,468
As her grandmother wasn't well...

110
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,065
...she came to our village for
a few days with her mother.

111
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,913
And those few days she used to
come to our school for fun.

112
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,743
America is also there in Canada?

113
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,478
No, Canada is above America.

114
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,554
What's the time now in Canada?

115
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,589
There it's night now.

116
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,126
Who's your favorite hero?
- Sylvester Stallone.

117
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:51,162
My favorite hero is 'Gharana
Mogudu'. Chiranjeevi.

118
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,663
Shweta was beauty.

119
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,501
Shweta was joy.

120
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:00,936
"I waited in the morning.
- I waited in the morning."

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,170
"And I waited in the night.
- And I waited in the night."

122
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,711
Everyone wanted a piece of Shweta.

123
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:08,838
Come here. Come here.
- Sit here. Sit here.

124
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,506
If that was the case with girls...

125
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,948
...then you can imagine what
the condition of boys was.

126
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,586
Everyone used to try very
hard to impress her.

127
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,080
Some guys with style.

128
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,591
Some with talent.

129
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,754
"The golden hen is here."

130
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,100
"O lady. O lady. O lady."

131
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,533
Some with boasting.
- Shweta, I smoke cigarettes...

132
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,036
...at home as well, you know that?

133
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,937
You smoke cigarettes?
- Sir. Sir. Sir.

134
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,533
How great it would be if one
gets such beautiful Shweta...

135
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,010
...as a friend! That's what
everyone used to think.

136
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,176
I too used to think the same.

137
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:47,709
How great it would be if
she becomes my friend!

138
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:51,288
You like Shweta a lot, don't you?

139
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,624
Give her these pakodas
and befriend her.

140
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,053
I am observing it since many days...

141
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,098
...you look at that
girl all the times.

142
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,894
Will I get her as my friend
if I give her that pakodas?

143
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,061
You have it then.

144
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:09,564
I prepared these. I saw my
mother preparing them...

145
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,767
...and learnt it from her.

146
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,041
My name is Zakir. I study
in the fifth standard.

147
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,649
From that day onwards
he became my friend.

148
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,577
He used to bring something
or other for me everyday...

149
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,710
...and used to offer me
with great affection.

150
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,256
He used to make me try
all his experiments.

151
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,658
Well, to be honest he was
quite good at cooking.

152
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,820
One day... - Shweta, when are
you coming to my home?

153
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,592
I will definitely come, Anita.
- You say everyday...

154
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,223
...that you would come,
but you never come.

155
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,961
I will definitely come to
your home this Sunday.

156
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,060
Promise?
- Promise. I will be there.

157
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:41,672
Hey, that foreigner looks like
an orange, doesn't she?

158
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:44,101
What did you say! What did you say!

159
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,139
I'll kill you.

160
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,689
O my God! Blood.

161
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:00,990
Go. Get first aid. Go.
- Ok.

162
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,624
Why are you fighting?
- He started fighting with him...

163
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,756
...because he called you an orange.

164
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,861
Why? Don't I look like an orange?

165
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,733
You look like an apple.

166
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,838
Won't you bear it if anyone
says anything to me?

167
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,771
I won't.

168
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:33,382
Friends.

INIVERSAI

172
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:58,076

00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:02,748
"It's a song sung by sunshine
and raindrops."

174
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:07,324
"It's a game played
by earth and sky."

175
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:12,159
"It's a song sung by sunshine
and raindrops."

176
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:16,767
"The heart is filled with love."

177
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:20,804
"The heart has turned into rainbow."

178
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:25,070
"My girl is there in my
eyes all day long."

179
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:30,843
"The heart is overflowing with joy."

180
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:36,053
"It's a game played
by earth and sky."

181
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:40,792
"It's a song sung by sunshine
and raindrops."

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,913
"There's happiness all over."

183
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:16,294
"We are running like river Kaveri."

184
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:21,764
"The cool breeze came along
and pinched the clouds..."

185
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:25,325
"...and made them drench the land."

186
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:29,771
"Happiness came secretively and
entered my girl's heart..."

187
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,778
"...and made the world beautiful."

188
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,010
"Her beautiful smile
is a melodious tune."

189
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:43,153
"I feel like looking
at her all day long."

190
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:47,191
"My girl is there in my
eyes all day long."

191
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:54,229
"The heart is overflowing with joy."

192
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:58,361
"It's a game played
by earth and sky."

193
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,868
"It's a song sung by sunshine
and raindrops."

194
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:38,970
"I heard something I
never heard before."

195
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:43,341
"My heart is singing
the songs of joy."

196
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:47,848
"You came into my life
from no where..."

197
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:52,083
"...and became an intrinsic
part of my life."

198
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,858
"You are there in my dreams..."

199
00:13:55,961 --> 00:14:01,058
"...and your love is
there in my heart."

200
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,424
"I can never forget you, my love."

201
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,934
"Each path of mine looks
so beautiful."

202
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:09,872
"God has given me
the greatest boon."

203
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,968
"My girl is there in my
eyes all day long."

204
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:19,445
"The heart is overflowing with joy."

205
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:25,118
"It's a game played
by earth and sky."

206
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:30,223
"It's a song sung by sunshine
and raindrops."

207
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,262
Catch me. Catch me, come on.

208
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,466
My life filled with so much joy
suddenly turned upside down.

209
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:41,036
Shweta is going back
to Canada again.

210
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:45,269
She is leave forever along
with her grandmother.

211
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:53,313
By, Vishwa. You must study well.

212
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,083
Shall we leave?
- Can I have a minute, mom?

213
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,212
Ok.

214
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,083
Goodbye, Viju.

215
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,990
Say 'hello' to Zakir.

216
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,091
Friends?

217
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,360
Goodbye, Viju.

218
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:44,427
Viju.

219
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:13,362
Even though Shweta left
Shweta's memories didn't.

220
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:19,129
With those memories I
completed eight class!

221
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,406
I passed eighth standard
in first class.

222
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,445
Master Shankaram was very happy.

223
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:34,250
But that joy was also short-lived.

224
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,145
Master was not keeping
in good health.

225
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,184
Vishnu, I won't be
there for too long.

226
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,089
You don't lose hope.

227
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,393
Trust your talent.

228
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,362
That will keep you in good stead.

229
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,270
After three months
master passed away.

230
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:09,718
They mother, father, and
then master is the God.

231
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,124
But for me master was
one and the only God.

232
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:17,150
I lost my only well-wisher.

233
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,068
With merit scholarship
I got a seat...

234
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,535
...in KBR college in Karnool.

235
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:30,201
New people. New environment.

236
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,242
Vishvam, what are those
sandals? New fashion?

237
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,676
I used to feel ashamed
of my appearance.

238
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:47,452
Except me everyone around
me was so posh and cool.

239
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,172
Vishnu, do you wanna have it?
- Yes.

240
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,771
Money can buy great pleasures.

241
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:15,786
He's Balaji. His father has
a clothes-store on main road.

242
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:19,182
He's used to show mercy
on me once in a while.

243
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,521
In college I used to hang
out mostly with him.

244
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,193
That girl's name is Mahalakshmi.

245
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:29,528
She's my classmate. Balaji
loves that girl.

246
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,133
He wanted to introduce himself
to her in some way...

247
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:35,263
...and to express her his love, but...

248
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:36,602
She didn't see you today as well.

249
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,505
Forget her now. Let's go.

250
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,709
I used to feel bad for him.

251
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:44,144
He used to remind me
of my longing for...

252
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,273
...Shweta's friendship in school.

253
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,710
Poor guy! I felt like doing
something for him.

254
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:52,220
Do you like Mahalakshmi?
- Like her? She's my life.

255
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:56,260
I will introduce you to her and
make you her friend. - Really?

256
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,521
Yes.
- How?

257
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,335
Mahalakshmi.
- What, Vishvam?

258
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,744
Ask him not to interfere
in your matters? - Whom?

259
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:20,249
That foolish Balaji.
- What do I have to do with Balaji?

260
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:22,183
A few days ago he bashed
a boy because...

261
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,187
...he whistled at you. And
yesterday someone said...

262
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,258
...that you look like an orange,
he smashed him as well.

263
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,424
Yesterday you went to watch a
movie in Leela Mahal, right?

264
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,189
Yes. - Someone commented
on you behind you...

265
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,354
...and he was also knocked down.

266
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,528
But I didn't know about it.
- How would you know?

267
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,625
You were watching the movie
with your friends.

268
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,494
There was a big fight going
on outside the theatre.

269
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,266
The matter reached
the police station.

270
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,207
Anyway, leave these things aside...

271
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,742
...and tell him not to interfere
in your matters.

272
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,873
Why is he behaving like that?

273
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,608
When I asked him why he said
that he loves you and all...

274
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,583
Ask him to forget all that crap.
It's not good for him.

275
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,552
That was it. And she was convinced.

276
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,394
And then they became a couple.

277
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,359
One minute.

278
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,629
Here's one thousand rupees.
- What!

279
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,300
Keep it. Keep it. Thanks.
- Hey.

280
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,346
It's one thousand rupees.

281
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,243
If you keep on using your
brain in that way...

282
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,377
...you would become a millionaire.
Keep it up.

283
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:33,247
I don't know if he meant
that but he showed me...

284
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,260
...a hidden talent in me. He
told me what I achieve...

285
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,659
...with my talent.

286
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:42,259
With that one thousand rupees
I bought new clothes...

287
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,392
...and new shoes and
became a stylish man.

288
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,796
From that day onwards I starting
using my talent...

289
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,934
I got Surendra a place
in the cricket team.

290
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:56,645
Got Prasad re-join the college
who was about to be debarred.

291
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,914
Made Sheshagiri the
college president.

292
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,348
I solved the problems of many.

293
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,455
From this I learnt a great lesson.

294
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:08,755
There's a calculation
for everything.

295
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:14,388
1+1=2. 2+2=4. 4+4=...

296
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,861
You know. Life is full
of calculations.

297
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,368
A person's emotion is a calculation.

298
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:24,037
If we study that emotion
and make calculations...

299
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,368
...we can achieve anything.

300
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,946
That's the lesson I learnt there.

301
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:32,977
I completed by MBA.

302
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:36,043
That was also funded by my friends.

303
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:38,581
Actually I made them do that.

304
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:51,068
I came far in life, but Shweta
was still far away from me.

305
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,498
I wonder where she is, how she is...

306
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,064
...what she is doing.

307
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,339
It's been so many years,
but still I couldn't...

308
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,468
...forget that friendship,
which makes me think...

309
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:02,837
Am I in love?

310
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,916
Yes, I am in love.

311
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,419
Madly in love.

312
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,853
She comes into my dreams as well.

313
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:16,426
She comes everyday.

314
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:25,795
Shweta.

315
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:29,437
Shweta came into your
dreams again, brother?

316
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,371
Your love will bring
Shweta back to you...

317
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,968
...no matter wherever you are.

318
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:38,014
Get fresh. Let's have coffee.

319
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:41,943
By now you must have
guessed who he is.

320
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,753
Yes, he's my childhood friend Zakir.

321
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,585
He didn't go much
farther in studies.

322
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,017
But he became an expert in cooking.

323
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:51,791
He stays with me.

324
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,464
His dream is to start
a mess sooner or later.

325
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,401
"I will serve you food
if you are hungry..."

326
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,403
"...if you are tired I will
give you a massage."

327
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,530
Brother, he's your ironed dress.
- Thanks.

328
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:06,000
All the best, brother. I
pray you get this job.

329
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,911
Who else will get it other than me?

330
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:12,648
I did all the background
work needed for it.

331
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:18,420
Hello.
- He's the recruiting officer of...

332
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,152
...Sri Krishna Group of companies.
K. Krishna Murthy.

333
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:24,794
K for Kappagantula(Frog leap)

334
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,858
Sir, my name is...
- You gave me the file. Sit down.

335
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,597
You know who is Visvak Sena?
- Yes, sir.

336
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,502
He's the commander-in-chief
of lord Vishnu.

337
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:42,003
I came across a nice name after
a long time. I'm pleased.

338
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,445
Me too, sir. After a long time
I came across a person...

339
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,608
...who pronounced my
name like my name.

340
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:48,446
Not just your name, but
I can't recite fluently...

341
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,453
...the most complicated and
tongue-twisting verses.

342
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,647
You know that?
- Yes, I know, sir.

343
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:54,451
How do you know that? - You attend
regularly the programs...

344
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,584
...they conduct in Ravindra Bharati.

345
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,887
You are the convener of
Telugu Arts Academy.

346
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:00,621
You are very good
at plays in verses.

347
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,997
Are you following me?
- Since November 1st.

348
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,467
After hearing a Telugu verse
you recited on stage...

349
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,164
...I became a big fan of yours.

350
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,472
What was that verse?
- A verse from...

351
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,603
...Harishchandra's tale, sir.
- Nasi Vasi...

352
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:17,579
It's not Vasi or Musi,
it's Varanasi.

353
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:21,675
"The ultimate destination of
the devotees Varanasi."

354
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:25,955
"The place praised in all
the shashtras is Varanasi."

355
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:30,560
"The golden bank of river
Ganges is Varanasi."

356
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:35,165
"Beloved! My beloved!"

357
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,291
"The path that makes
your feet auspicious...

358
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,559
...the path to Varanasi!"

359
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,637
Wow! It feels like someone is
pouring nectar in my ears.

360
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:41,501
It's nothing. I wonder
what you will say...

361
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,733
...on hearing the verse from
the life of lord Krishna.

362
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:46,675
You played lord Krishna's
part as well? - Did I?

363
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,507
When I played lord Krishna's part...

364
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,844
...people used to feel that
NTR has reborn. - Really?

365
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,514
I performed all the roles on stage...

366
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,916
...that NTR played on screen.

367
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,112
Duyodhana. Keechaka.

368
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:01,056
Bheema. Including Bruhannala.

369
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,856
Really, sir?
- You don't believe it?

370
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,290
Hold this.

371
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,200
Stripping of Draupati's sari.
Bheema's fury!

372
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:17,274
Hey, demon! - Sir.
Did you call me, sir?

373
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,865
Get lost. I told you
not to disturb me...

374
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,035
...when an interview is going on.

375
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,307
Bheema's fury.

376
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,943
"With the arrogance of your power..."

377
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,112
"...you dared to insult Draupati and
invited your death..."

378
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:36,055
"...you will face the wrath of
the mighty Bheema..."

379
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,496
Sir, have some water.

380
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:45,968
Wonderful. Splendid.

381
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:47,902
Just now I came to know that
there can be so much...

382
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,496
...intensity in acting, sir.
- Not just intensity...

383
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,608
...there's exhaustion as well.
- Sit down, sir.

384
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:56,244
Sir, did you ever try comic roles?

385
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:59,039
I think comedy won't
suit my personality.

386
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,481
I shall go now, sir.
- Where are you going...

387
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:02,985
...without completing the interview?

388
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:06,249
Sir, can I tell you something
frankly? - What's that?

389
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,916
I came here as I am
an admirer of yours...

390
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,187
...but not with the dream of getting
through the interview.

391
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:12,256
I have got a local MBA, sir.

392
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,931
Outside the chamber there
are many candidates...

393
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,125
...studying in more reputed
universities, sir.

394
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,101
Goodbye, sir.
- Stop.

395
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,008
Who the interviewee, you or me?
- It's you, sir.

396
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:26,372
Who knows it better what this
company needs, you or me?

397
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:28,173
It's you, sir.
- Give me the file.

398
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,285
You are selected. - Sir. What
about the other candidates...

399
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,445
I think we are done
with the interview.

400
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:38,951
If someone less intelligent
was on this seat...

401
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,083
...he would've thought that you
are trying to flatter him.

402
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:46,225
But I saw your MBA certificate.
I saw your good behavior.

403
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:47,954
And I selected you.
- Thank you, sir.

404
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,091
Ok, all the best. One minute.
- Yes.

405
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:52,463
There's a general manager
called Chitranjan.

406
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,971
Don't go by the name Chitranjan
and think that...

407
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,131
...he's some intellectual
from Calcutta.

408
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,333
He's a local fellow. He's a
big show-off. Don't mind him.

409
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:01,036
I'm going to the chairman's chamber.

410
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:02,170
If anyone comes for
me ask them to wait.

411
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,304
It's just show-off.

412
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:09,112
Madam, coffee.
- Thank you.

413
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,582
Yes, sir. - I am the newly
appointed assistant manager.

414
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:13,715
Greetings, sir.

415
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,116
My name is Appa Rao.
I am the office boy.

416
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:18,993
Ok, show me GM's room.
- Ok, sir. Come. But he's not...

417
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,463
...in his chamber. He went
to the chairman's chamber.

418
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:25,627
I see. - He didn't go to
chairman's chamber.

419
00:27:25,737 --> 00:27:26,999
He tells us all that he
goes to the chairman...

420
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,129
...but the truth is that
he goes to the bathroom...

421
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,366
...on the next floor to smoke.
- Why?

422
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:31,999
Chairman doesn't call him?
- Yes, he calls him...

423
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,668
...but only once in a week
or once in ten days.

424
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,008
But he tries to show-off as
if the chairman discusses...

425
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,378
...everything with him
and takes decisions.

426
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,342
It seems to be quite
a funny character.

427
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,010
Sir, you sit here. I will
call you once he comes...

428
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,281
...from the bathroom.
- Ok. - Ok?

429
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,081
Appu.
- Sir.

430
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,395
What for, sir? - This is my
first day in the office.

431
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,620
A small gift for you.
- Thank you, sir.

432
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,529
Thank you very much. Sir,
you sit here.

433
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,498
I will call you when
sir comes. Ok, sir?

434
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:04,404
He told me about his GM's
follies without asking...

435
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,037
What's the guaranty that
he won't talk about me...

436
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,772
...behind my back? That 500
was to keep his mouth shut.

437
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:18,212
Hello.

438
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,723
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

439
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,225
I thought it was the GM.

440
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,392
I am the newly appointed
assistant manager.

441
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:28,432
What's your name?
- My name is Visvak Sena.

442
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:31,525
May I know your lovely name?
- Ramya. - Nice.

443
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,073
Miss. Ramya, 32,000 + 2,000
+ 725 + 336 = 35,061...

444
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:42,636
...not 34,032.
- Wow! So fast!

445
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:45,075
If I offer sweet to Miss.
Ramya she won't refuse it...

446
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:48,448
...in the name of diet and weight,
right? - I love sweets.

447
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:53,153
Ok. Can I take one more?
- Sure.

448
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,187
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

449
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,287
Thank you.
- Hello!

450
00:28:58,129 --> 00:28:59,187
Thank you.

451
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,489
Thanks.

452
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,097
Good morning, sir.
- You are the newly appointed...

453
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,102
...assistant manager?
I'm the cashier.

454
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,671
You get your salary from
me. You know that?

455
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,738
Please.
- All the best.

456
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:12,434
Thanks.
- Thanks. - Sir.

457
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:15,374
GM is back...
- From the bathroom?

458
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,177
You got it right, sir.
- Take it. It's all yours.

459
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,617
No, sister. Listen to me.

460
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,585
I can't come to the
engagement ceremony.

461
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:26,757
How can you set the date
on a working day?

462
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,486
Chairman can't do without
me even for a single day.

463
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:35,256
Look, but the wedding date
must be fixed on a Sunday.

464
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,801
Ok, then, bye.

465
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,230
God! The burden of responsibilities!

466
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,131
Because of these particular
responsibilities...

467
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,267
...I had to separate from my wife.

468
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,504
Sincere workers can't escape
this burden, sir.

469
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:51,748
GM's job is not child's play.

470
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,608
You have to take care of
the burden of the office.

471
00:29:53,718 --> 00:29:55,208
You have to manage so many people.

472
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,254
You have to analyze different
type of people.

473
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,746
It's not as easy as one thinks
it is. - Correct. Correct.

474
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,687
We have to analyze so many people.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:04,159
Ok, example, you are here.
The moment you came here...

476
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:07,163
...I started analyzing you.
What I can say about you...

477
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:11,531
...is that you are a man who
doesn't calculate too much.

478
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,404
Sir. - What? - Your cigarette
packet, sir.

479
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,342
You forgot it on the bathroom.

480
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,542
I don't think that's my packet.
- It's yours, sir.

481
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,181
Before entering or returning
from the chairman's chamber...

482
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:26,307
...you go to the bathroom,
don't you, sir?

483
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,441
You must've forgotten it then, sir.

484
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:28,576
It's when I return from there.

485
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,551
Ok. Ok. You may go now. Go. Go.
- Ok, sir.

486
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,593
Yes, we were talking about
analyzing, right? - Yes, sir.

487
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:39,254
Not take him for example.
He's very sincere.

488
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:41,195
He doesn't say a word
behind my back...

489
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,561
...and doesn't let anyone else
say anything about me either.

490
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,261
Really!
- That's loyalty.

491
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:49,664
All the best.
- Thank you, sir.

492
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:55,903
Visvak. Did that theatre artist
say something about me?

493
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:58,772
Who, sir?
- That fellow... That HRD fellow.

494
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,417
He thinks he's some tall
and handsome leading man.

495
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,211
He was here, but they
threw him here...

496
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,346
...as he is a big headache.
He doesn't know that.

497
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,224
He's not as long as the
sword in Shivaji's hand...

498
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,623
...and he thinks of performing
Chatrapati Shivaji's role.

499
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,655
Silly fellow. Silly fellow.

500
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,231
I am saying this only because
he came into conversation...

501
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,566
...otherwise I don't discuss
about others too much.

502
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,970
You may go now. You may go now.
- Ok.

503
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,568
Now about our chairman.
Mr. Krishna Kumar.

504
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,378
He's a brilliant man. Self-made.

505
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,506
What style! What dignity!
Everyone respects him.

506
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,615
He's a person who values efficiency.

507
00:31:34,953 --> 00:31:38,320
To make him notice us we must
prove your efficiency.

508
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,252
Excuse me, sir. I did a research...

509
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,621
...on the top 30 companies in India.

510
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,556
These are the notes related to that.

511
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,996
I think it will be helpful for you.
- Ok. Keep it in my cabin.

512
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:51,693
I will look into it.

513
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:54,271
And in that way my
professional life...

514
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,739
...in my office was going
in a peaceful way when...

515
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,533
I don't know if they
call it an accident...

516
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,013
...or they call it world is round...

517
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:08,509
I really can't say that.

518
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,013
That day I was working
in the office.

519
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,858
As usual I was helping out Ramya...

520
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,484
If you don't give the end bracket...

521
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:19,461
...the command won't work.
- O, thank you, Vissu.

522
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,726
What's the matter the office
is buzzing today?

523
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,769
You don't know this. Today our
chairman's daughter is coming.

524
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,861
Oh. - She was studying
in Canada till now.

525
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,870
She too studies in Canada.

526
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,735
What's her name?
- Madam's here. Madam's here.

527
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,704
Shweta.

528
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:33,699
"I hope it's not a dream, it's for
real. I'm really looking at you."

529
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:40,640
"You are a wave of joy.
I am jumping in joy."

530
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:47,745
"Is this me or someone else?"

531
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:54,548
"Am I falling in love with
you all over again?"

532
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:01,462
"I am still wondering if it's
real or it's a dream."

533
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:08,563
"Has God really been so kind to me?"

534
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:09,731
Vijju.

535
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:15,074
Koduru High School?
- O my God!

536
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,115
O my God! What a pleasant surprise!

537
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:22,548
World is such a small place.
- Yes.

538
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,787
Do you work here?
- Yes. - Yes, yes.

539
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:28,483
That's fabulous.

540
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,489
We both are school-mates.

541
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,762
We were best friends
when we were kids.

542
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,536
You'll stay here?
- Yes, I will be here, Shweta.

543
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,803
Ok, then. I will meet father
and be back. Ok? - Ok.

544
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:48,138
See you all. Bye.

545
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,675
That girl and you are classmates?

546
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:55,516
Yes, sir.
- How?

547
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,447
That's a small story.
- You gave us such a big shock...

548
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:58,681
...and say it's a small story?

549
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:03,555
That's what I am thinking, dad.
- Ok, dear.

550
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,959
So in the first quarter of our
pharmaceutical company...

551
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:10,090
Hi, Vijju. Come. Come. I'm
the one who called you.

552
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,729
Sorry. I didn't disturb
your work, did I?

553
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:14,702
No, don't worry about it.
- Good.

554
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:17,471
Daddy, Vijju is my school-mate.
You know that?

555
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,135
Your school-mate? Where?
- In Koduru.

556
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,637
We went to our village when
granny wasn't well.

557
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:25,639
I told you that I went to a
school in Koduru... There...

558
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,881
Oh.
- We both are friends.

559
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:29,844
Best friends.

560
00:35:31,122 --> 00:35:33,716
I read your research about the
30 best companies of India.

561
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:35,889
It's good. Very informative.

562
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:37,618
Keep it up.

563
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:39,854
Thank you, sir.

564
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:42,656
Hello.

565
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:49,004
Yes, Mr. Harish... Yes, everything's
fine. Yes. Yes. - Come.

566
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,207
Shweta came from Canada.

567
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:59,741
So... Long time?
- Yes.

568
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:02,910
Did you get married?
- No, not yet.

569
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:07,054
Why? Why not yet?
- 'When you are in my heart... '

570
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,921
Hello.
- Just like that.

571
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,692
We met quite accidentally, right?

572
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,596
And a dog bit you back then, right?

573
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,931
It was on the right hand, right?
- Yes, it was the right hand.

574
00:36:22,673 --> 00:36:23,697
The scar's gone.

575
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,737
How's Zakir?
- He's fine. He stays with me.

576
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,675
Does he still prepare pakodis?

577
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:32,649
He has become an expert cook.

578
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,214
I need to meet him.
- Ok.

579
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:35,812
Who else among our friends
you are in touch with?

580
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:38,621
She asked me many more
questions that day.

581
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:40,714
She reminded me of so many things.

582
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:55,638
"All these days I hid
your love in my heart."

583
00:36:55,773 --> 00:37:02,645
"Today I saw you again
and became ecstatic."

584
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:09,648
"I never expected this..."

585
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:14,187
"I got you again..." - Zakir, you
think my love will succeed?

586
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,054
She covered so much distance
and came here.

587
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:18,651
She would definitely take
a few steps more.

588
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:25,601
"I am dedicating you my
heart and loving you."

589
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:32,233
"I am surviving with the
help of your memories."

590
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:39,010
"No matter whatever happens now..."

591
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:45,815
"...I am happy to get
you back in my life."

592
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:52,686
"My heartbeat chants your name."

593
00:37:52,997 --> 00:38:00,096
"Your love is filled in each
and every cell of my body."

594
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:23,926
"I am still wondering if it's
real or it's a dream."

595
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:31,127
"Has God really been so kind to me?"

596
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:37,799
"I love you. I love you."

597
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:44,776
"I love you. I love you."

598
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,111
A bond develops when
people are close.

599
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:52,952
And love blossoms from that bond.

600
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:56,156
But how do I get close to her?

601
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:59,086
And then I got a chance
to get close to her.

602
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:03,289
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Visvak Sena.

603
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,099
You are here, sir?
- I went to the chairman's room.

604
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,693
What for, sir?
- Shweta is about to start...

605
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:09,705
...a pharmaceutical company.
And chairman ordered me...

606
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,707
...to select a project
manager to oversee...

607
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:15,802
...all that project related work.
- Very good, sir.

608
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,175
What very good! It's no good.

609
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:19,715
I was doing it on my own, but
it seems that that Chitranjan...

610
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,718
...has given him a lame advice
that he would also...

611
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,720
...sit in the selection committee
and the chairman...

612
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:26,790
...then asked us to select the
project manager together.

613
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,722
And here I brought the list.
Visvak Sena, I am...

614
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:31,727
...the HR manager, right?
I am the one who knows...

615
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,729
...who is capable of what, right?
I'm the one who selected...

616
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,323
...everyone in this office including
you, right? - Yes, sir.

617
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:39,733
Ask them as well.
- I'm the one who selected...

618
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,862
...all of you, right?
- Yes, sir.

619
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:43,733
Then why is your GM giving
a wrong entry...

620
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,900
...like Uttara Kumara in Ramayana.

621
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:48,744
If you stop that entertainment
and come inside...

622
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,336
...we can get on with work...

623
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,416
...Kappagantula (frog leaps)
Krishna Murthy.

624
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:00,746
I won't tolerate it if you
pronounce my surname...

625
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,758
...in the wrong way.
- How would we know...

626
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,489
...about the phonetics as we're
not artists! That's your area.

627
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:19,833
What's that? Shivaji look?

628
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,178
I always sympathize with
two types of people.

629
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:27,148
The first one is he
who starves for food.

630
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,782
And the second one is he who
boasts of leaving his wife...

631
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,014
...even if his wife had left him.

632
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:37,288
Entertainment is over.

633
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:40,795
Shall we go into the chamber
and go on with work...

634
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:42,923
...Mr. Wife-dumped Chitranjan?

635
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:50,534
It was a golden opportunity
that God gave me.

636
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,468
We need to take advantage
of this opportunity.

637
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,873
I must get that project
manager's post.

638
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:58,815
No. No. With him disturbance is
more and discussion's less.

639
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,474
Sir, tea.
- Get lost. - Sir.

640
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:03,079
Sir. Sir. Sir. Why are
you so disturbed?

641
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:04,819
Look, I will pay for
the flight charges...

642
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,015
...but leave that GM in Afghanistan.

643
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,455
I'll get rid of him.
- What happened, sir?

644
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,017
What else will happen? We can
never agree on one thing.

645
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,892
The project manager will
never be selected.

646
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,223
Sir.

647
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:21,499
Sir, you have been making me
a promise since a long time.

648
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:22,833
What?
- You said that you would show me...

649
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,568
...the costume drama with
full make-up, didn't you?

650
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,837
I didn't call you as whenever
I talked to you...

651
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:30,379
...you said you were busy.
- What are you saying, sir!

652
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:33,506
As I didn't get a call from
you I thought you were busy.

653
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,983
Busy? For a play? Never.

654
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,852
Then do one thing. Come over
to our place at 7 O' clock...

655
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,219
...this Sunday. You can
have breakfast with us.

656
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,449
I will show you my hidden talent.

657
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:46,987
I have to flatter both
Chitti and Kitty...

658
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:48,257
...who are as far as north
pole and south pole.

659
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,868
Those who put up a false drama...

660
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:54,233
...fall for a false drama
eventually. That's a rule.

661
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:57,867
Good morning, sir.
- For you Sunday is a holiday...

662
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,875
...but we are not that lucky.
Yesterday I thought of...

663
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,877
...going to a movie, but
chairman gave me a call...

664
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,003
...and asked me to meet
him in the club.

665
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:04,876
And I don't know when
time went past ten...

666
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,882
...when we were talking.
He were talking about...

667
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,315
...his next projects. It's
just his trust in him.

668
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:11,946
You need not tell us how much
he depends on you. - That's it.

669
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:13,888
What, sir? - There was something
dark on your head.

670
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,016
I thought a hair grew on it.
- O come on, sir!

671
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:20,092
Shweta. Shweta, listen to me.

672
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:23,630
You shouldn't select me for
that project manager's post.

673
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,027
Why? Because everyone would
know about us then.

674
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:29,165
It won't look good others
know about it.

675
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:30,297
You shouldn't select me.

676
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:32,975
It's ok if someone else
selects me for that post.

677
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,302
But you...

678
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,474
Ok. Ok, Sailaja.

679
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:41,415
No problem. Ok. Ok, Sailaja.

680
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,543
I will call you back. Ok. Ok.

681
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:47,453
My friend. Sailaja.

682
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,617
Sailaja.

683
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:52,985
She was asking me which
movie we should go...

684
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,027
What are you thinking about, sir?

685
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:14,016
Now watch how he would
be thinking now.

686
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:18,378
First he will determine
whom I was talking to.

687
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,685
Sailaja.
- There he will fall in the trap.

688
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:24,084
It's definitely Shweta.

689
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,496
Now he would think
using his entire IQ.

690
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:29,457
The bulb will light up,
on the wrong side of course.

691
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:35,168
Now flash-cuts.
- Hey, a gift for you.

692
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:38,573
Vijju, come, come. Let's go
on our car today. - Ok.

693
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:40,601
Hey, come back.
- Ok.

694
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:41,973
Earlier he used to see only
friendship between us...

695
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,206
...but now he will insert a
romantic angle between us.

696
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:46,646
He will make 1+1=11.

697
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:50,343
Now his cinematic genius knowledge
will take over here.

698
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:53,489
He will picture a typical scene
from the cinema of his era.

699
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,654
Shweta. Shweta. Shweta.
Try to understand me.

700
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:00,696
What's there to understand, Visvam?

701
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:02,999
Ever since childhood
we played together...

702
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,000
...cried together and laughed
together. Why are you...

703
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:06,364
...bringing up a difference that
didn't exist earlier, Visvam?

704
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,137
Shweta, you are from a rich family.

705
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,008
There's a world of difference
between your status...

706
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:15,010
...and my status.
- To wipe out that difference...

707
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:17,205
...I want you as my project manager.

708
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:20,547
I love you from the bottom
of my heart, Visvam.

709
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:24,248
O Shweta! Now he will
come to a conclusion.

710
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,351
They are in love.

711
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,692
They are in love!

712
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:38,693
He gets great joy as if he found
something like Aristotle.

713
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:44,102
And then he conserves
with his conscience.

714
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:50,113
Chitranjan. Deal this issue
properly. - Which issue?

715
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:53,149
Befriend him.
- Why? What for?

716
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,376
He's the future chairman
of this company.

717
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:55,713
You should be in his good books.

718
00:44:58,322 --> 00:44:59,380
After the preaching is over
he starts thinking...

719
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:03,615
...how to use this valuable secret.

720
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:08,594
To befriend me now
he starts his game.

721
00:45:10,234 --> 00:45:13,169
Visvak, I took a decision.
- What is it, sir?

722
00:45:13,804 --> 00:45:16,568
I contemplated a lot about
the project manager.

723
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:21,235
There is only one person who I
think is suitable for this job.

724
00:45:21,578 --> 00:45:22,602
Rafi?

725
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,273
Srinivas? James? Paidibabu?

726
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:30,244
It's you. - Me? - I can see
a great future in you.

727
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:31,479
Your future or my future?

728
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:36,292
Today you might not know what
you are, but I know that.

729
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:40,220
Tomorrow you will also know,
not about you, but about me.

730
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:43,089
By now you must also have known...

731
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,259
...how much affection I have for you.

732
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:50,230
We cannot take such decisions...

733
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,275
...without a long contemplation
about them.

734
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,236
Oh! I'm getting late. I need
to meet the chairman.

735
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,545
Sir, cigarettes.

736
00:46:03,453 --> 00:46:06,445
'GM contemplates a lot
about everything.'

737
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,125
One wicket down. The second
wicket is that of...

738
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,700
...Mr. Kappagantula Krishna Murthy.

739
00:46:19,303 --> 00:46:20,736
Today we would watch his
stage performance.

740
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:22,799
Come, let's see.

741
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:27,801
Welcome. Welcome, Visvak Sena.

742
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,469
I was waiting for you. Welcome.
- Sir, just a minute.

743
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,706
Please take these sweets,
sir. Thank you, sir.

744
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:33,807
You are touching my feet even
before the play has begun?

745
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,145
I came to know that you are
thinking of making me...

746
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:37,311
...the project manager.
- Project manager?

747
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:39,653
Which project? Which manager?

748
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:42,156
Sir, the project manager of
the pharmaceutical company...

749
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,283
...that Shweta is about to start.

750
00:46:43,727 --> 00:46:46,161
I came to know that when Mr.
Chitranjan knew about your...

751
00:46:46,263 --> 00:46:49,164
...decision he has conspired
to announce it before you...

752
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,291
...and take away the credit. It's
a hot rumor in the office, sir.

753
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:54,694
After all you are his
competitor, sir.

754
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,173
But I know that it's
because of you...

755
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:00,402
...that I am becoming
a project manager.

756
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:05,313
But I didn't think of you
as the project manager.

757
00:47:07,217 --> 00:47:08,275
You didn't?

758
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:12,546
Oh! This is my stupidity, sir.

759
00:47:13,223 --> 00:47:15,191
I heard some rumors in the office...

760
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,725
...and without knowing the truth...

761
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,317
I shouldn't have asked you about
it in such a way, sir.

762
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,857
Forgive me, sir.
- Visvak Sena.

763
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:24,364
We shouldn't be discussing office
related issues at home, sir.

764
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,403
I have been waiting
since a long time.

765
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:28,664
First show me the play, sir.

766
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:31,263
Very good. Come on. Come on.

767
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:35,306
Kaushalya, if anyone call me
tell them that I am busy.

768
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:36,436
Don't allow anybody.

769
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:39,340
This is our stage. Switch
on the lights.

770
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:44,678
Wow!

771
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:48,587
Sir, people rave about
home theatre...

772
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,294
...but this is the real home theatre.

773
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:54,296
This is my troupe.
Drum, harmonium, clarion.

774
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:55,592
Greetings. Greetings.
- Hold it, sir.

775
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,460
Sir, what are you about
to show me now?

776
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,435
Not one, but all of them.
All are solo leads.

777
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:04,735
First I will enact the role of the
king of Kauravas Duryodhana.

778
00:48:04,908 --> 00:48:07,468
Just a minute. I will get
into the costume. - Sir.

779
00:48:07,978 --> 00:48:09,240
Please don't mind what
I said a while ago...

780
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,315
...and get disturbed, sir.
- What was that?

781
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,816
Don't feel bad that you didn't
select me. - Don't mind.

782
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:17,316
Once I get into the character
I forget the rest of the world.

783
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:18,581
That's the best way to go
about it, sir. - Yes.

784
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:34,995
Panchali! Wife of five husbands!

785
00:48:36,406 --> 00:48:39,603
You... How dare you!

786
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:43,778
How dare you to laugh at me!

787
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,678
No matter however hard I try
I am unable to forget it...

788
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,643
It breaks my heart into thousand
pieces every time I think of it.

789
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:54,614
Aunt, is something going
on in the shed?

790
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:56,659
I can hear some screams.
- It's nothing new.

791
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,491
Today it's Sunday. Our Dilip
Kumar got a new victim.

792
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:02,360
He is showing him the
only thing he knows.

793
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,728
So how was my performance?

794
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,427
Can I give you a frank opinion,
sir? - Yes, sure.

795
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:10,865
There was something missing
in your performance, sir.

796
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,902
Is that so?
- Something is disturbing you, sir.

797
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:17,981
There's nothing like that.
I am not disturbed.

798
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:20,846
You are a good human being, sir.

799
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:22,811
You can't hide it even
if you want to.

800
00:49:23,954 --> 00:49:25,319
A while ago my disappointment...

801
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:29,984
...about the promotion had hurt you.
- Actually...

802
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:34,329
Yes, to some extent, but...
- You couldn't hide it...

803
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,797
...in your performance, sir.
- Is that so?

804
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:41,762
What's next, sir?
- Subhash Chandra Bose.

805
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:51,473
The pride of my heart, the
feel of my breathe...

806
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:54,016
...my fellow countrymen
and soldiers...

807
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:57,416
...let us give our blood for
the nation for its freedom.

808
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:00,854
Let us march to Delhi to kick
the British out of India.

809
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:03,450
Long live Indian Army!
- Long live Indian Army!

810
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,425
Long live Indian Army!
- Long live Indian Army!

811
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:06,920
How is it?

812
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,362
You are feeling it, sir.
- I can't do it if I don't feel...

813
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,563
...the character.
- I don't mean that, sir.

814
00:50:15,672 --> 00:50:18,607
Your regret for not selecting
me is even more apparent now.

815
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:21,804
It's more apparent?
- Yes, it's apparent, sir.

816
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:24,377
It's not your mistake if
you didn't select me...

817
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,847
...as the project manager, sir.
You are doing your duty.

818
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:29,384
Please don't keep it
in mind and affect...

819
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:32,785
...your performance, sir. Please,
it disturbs me, sir.

820
00:50:33,423 --> 00:50:36,449
Please. Please, sir.
- Ok.

821
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,393
What you said is right. The
more I think about it...

822
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,991
...the more I feel like you were
right. - Don't feel bad, sir.

823
00:50:46,636 --> 00:50:47,796
And it's completely my mistake.

824
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:51,566
Take these sweets first.
You will relax.

825
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,410
These are the sweets
that you brought...

826
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:58,072
...in the joy of getting
a promotion, right? - Oh!

827
00:50:58,515 --> 00:50:59,743
You didn't forget it till now?

828
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:03,619
Come on, sir. Show me the
next performance. - Ok.

829
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:09,016
Narada.
- Sir.

830
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:15,562
Please concentrate on it, sir.
- I will try.

831
00:51:18,602 --> 00:51:20,433
Listen, why did Chitranjan think...

832
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:22,767
...that I am selecting you?

833
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,902
Because I am your most
favorite disciple.

834
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:26,100
That might be the reason.

835
00:51:38,622 --> 00:51:40,453
Satyabhama, you asked
me for the position of...

836
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,115
...the project manager, didn't you?

837
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,785
You asked me for the
heavenly flower from...

838
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:46,920
...the pleasure garden
of Indra, didn't you?

839
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:50,590
Visvak Sena.

840
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:55,134
I can't perform anymore.
- What happened, sir?

841
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:58,564
Even the best actor in the
world would get disturbed.

842
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:02,971
I am really sorry not thinking
of you as the project manager.

843
00:52:04,548 --> 00:52:07,483
Now I tell you, I, who is in the
character of lord Krishna...

844
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:12,214
...am giving you the boon, you'll
the be the project manager.

845
00:52:12,322 --> 00:52:14,688
Sir.
- Take these sweets.

846
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:17,152
Thank you, sir.
- No need to thank me.

847
00:52:17,694 --> 00:52:19,491
Everyone in our office think
that I'm the one...

848
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:21,894
...who selected you.
Let them think so.

849
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:23,932
Keep this matter between us.
- Ok, sir.

850
00:52:24,034 --> 00:52:27,003
Not just ok. I am such
a relieved man now.

851
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:29,671
Now you will watch the talent
hidden inside this great actor.

852
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:30,797
Music!

853
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:43,178
Kappagantula. Kappagantula.

854
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,179
Did you see this! He selected
you after he came to know...

855
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,189
...that I selected you.

856
00:52:49,726 --> 00:52:53,526
He doesn't have the talent
to think originally...

857
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,827
...and acutely like I do.
Look he copied me.

858
00:52:57,934 --> 00:53:02,098
Anyway, from today onwards you
are the project manager.

859
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,938
The stage is set for the romance.

860
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,904
Hi!

861
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:17,212
Congratulations!

862
00:53:18,888 --> 00:53:19,912
O God!

863
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:22,558
I was worried who would
be appointed...

864
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:23,990
...as the project manager.
You were appointed.

865
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:27,894
And I am really very happy.
Now I can relax.

866
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:32,567
I said I will start a
pharmaceutical company...

867
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,796
...and father gave me his approval.
It's fine till then.

868
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:38,569
But when it comes to the work
I am completely at sea about...

869
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:41,610
...where to start, how to go about
these permissions and all...

870
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:44,838
I am totally lost.
- Relax. I will plan everything.

871
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:48,148
My project manager.

872
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:51,586
Shweta, first we will have
to chalk out the work...

873
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:54,179
...in two phases. First
phase: Permissions.

874
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,849
Second phase: Clearances.

875
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:58,189
Permissions: From the World
Health Organization...

876
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:00,889
...good manufacturing
factory certificate.

877
00:54:01,131 --> 00:54:03,099
Drug, medical and
health department...

878
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,860
...issues this certificate.

879
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:07,669
Next we have to get
the drug license.

880
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:09,898
This has to be approved by the
analytical chemist, right?

881
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:13,601
Yes. So now we have to appoint
an analytical chemist.

882
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,911
Now we come to the second
phase. Clearances.

883
00:54:17,747 --> 00:54:19,612
Clearances from Sales-tax,
Central exercise...

884
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:22,082
...labor department and
most importantly...

885
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:24,619
...pollution control board. If we
get the clearances from them...

886
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:26,621
...we can then upgrade the project
with the Italian firm...

887
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:28,714
...to the next level.

888
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:32,126
As far as I know all this
work can be completed...

889
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:34,355
...in three months. - That's
all it will take? So simple!

890
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,724
How did you know all this, Vijju?

891
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:40,636
As soon as I came to know
that you are starting...

892
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:43,365
...a pharmaceutical company I
have started working on this.

893
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:46,935
Good boy.

894
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:50,638
You know, when you were explaining
the work in this way...

895
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:53,648
...it reminded me of you
coming to our class...

896
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,048
...to solving a maths
problem on our board.

897
00:54:58,188 --> 00:54:59,655
Would you like to have a chocolate?

898
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:05,759
Let's get down with work.
- Yes, boss.

899
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,674
The workload is too much,
isn't it, Vijju?

900
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,905
We shall form a team.
- No need for that, Shweta.

901
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:27,073
I can handle it.

902
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:43,156
Very good, Visvam. You streamlined
the work very well.

903
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:46,197
I think we can go to the second
phase of the work...

904
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,031
...by next week.
- Yes, sir.

905
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:49,694
The work is going on at
a pretty fast face...

906
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,966
...ever since Vijju got
involved in this, dad.

907
00:55:51,074 --> 00:55:53,372
It's quite natural. He's
from my hometown.

908
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:55,711
We are all genia.
- Thanks.

909
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:59,270
Genia is a flower, mummy.
The word is 'genius'.

910
00:55:59,382 --> 00:56:01,782
Whatever! Sit down, son.
- Mom didn't learn English...

911
00:56:01,885 --> 00:56:03,716
...in Canada even after
we pestered her...

912
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,720
...but she did teach everyone
Telugu over there...

913
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:08,416
...including our cook.

914
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,222
Yes, I taught him making
mango prickles as well.

915
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,319
Right now he has started
a prickle business.

916
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:17,259
And also, how can we stop
talking in our language?

917
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,792
They say Telugu is as good
as any other language.

918
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:20,927
You are right, Vani.

919
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:23,000
It's as good as any other language.
We don't deny it.

920
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,739
But you must also learn
English a bit.

921
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:34,973
Shweta and I came to Vizag
to see the factory sight.

922
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,749
This was a good opportunity for me...

923
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:40,789
...to turn Shweta's mind towards me.

924
00:56:46,496 --> 00:56:48,760
So this is where my pharmaceutical
company...

925
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:51,993
...is going to be. - Yes. The
great pharmaceutical company.

926
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,768
You won't agree with anything
less than great?

927
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:58,763
That's my nature, Shweta.
Our company should...

928
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,776
...scale great heights.
- Wow!

929
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:04,073
It seems you are more
ambitious than me.

930
00:57:04,314 --> 00:57:06,839
Whatever I am saying it's
for our company, right?

931
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:08,841
Come, let's go to the hotel.

932
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:14,779
'To create romantic feelings
in Shweta's heart... '

933
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:18,850
'... who is always busy in work
I have to change the location.'

934
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:21,396
'What can be more romantic
than a beach? '

935
00:57:25,335 --> 00:57:28,498
Yes, Vijju.
- I am going to the beach.

936
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:31,803
I will be back in one hour.
- You will go to the beach...

937
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:34,399
...and you want me to sit
inside the hotel room?

938
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:38,379
I will also come with you.
Wait for me. - Ok, Shweta.

939
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:42,811
Who doesn't like a beach?

940
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:49,954
Come. Come. Come.

941
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,183
Catch me.

942
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:56,956
Catch me.

943
00:57:57,133 --> 00:57:58,930
Come. Come. Come.

944
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:03,903
The beach is so wonderful, isn't it?

945
00:58:04,173 --> 00:58:06,368
Yes, Shweta. It's really beautiful.

946
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:08,842
And Vijju, you were thinking of
coming to the beach alone...

947
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:12,176
...and enjoying here alone.
Without me?

948
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:14,316
Actually I didn't know if
you would like the beach...

949
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:17,417
Who doesn't like the beach?

950
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:19,415
You should know that, Vijju.

951
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,254
These waves, this air...

952
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,157
...those clouds...

953
00:58:30,934 --> 00:58:32,595
I feel so romantic.

954
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:35,061
How romantic?

At the beach when I looked
into Shweta's eyes...

992
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:49,252
...I understood that my
plan has succeeded.

993
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:53,454
As I planned I made her see
me in a different light.

994
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,256
Of course, I won't
say that it's love.

995
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,225
But it's definitely the beginning.

996
01:03:00,837 --> 01:03:02,134
From now onwards I have to
drive her methodically...

997
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:03,262
...towards falling in love with me.

998
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:06,673
I have make her say me I love you.

999
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:11,138
To make her say that I will
have to make Shweta...

1000
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:13,147
...focus her mind on me.
And for that to happen...

1001
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:16,514
...the matches coming for Shweta
should stop coming.

1002
01:03:19,188 --> 01:03:20,450
I will have to make
them stop coming.

1003
01:03:20,857 --> 01:03:21,881
Rakesh?

1004
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:26,154
K.S.L. Group chairman's son?

1005
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:28,690
They are going very strong in
the textile business, sir.

1006
01:03:29,332 --> 01:03:31,163
Their turnover is more
than 1000 crore.

1007
01:03:33,803 --> 01:03:36,169
But I don't think it would look
good if we approach them...

1008
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:39,708
...with the match.
- Why would we approach them?

1009
01:03:40,576 --> 01:03:41,600
We will make them approach us.

1010
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:50,849
They are also interested in
the pharmaceutical company.

1011
01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:53,718
We would meet their MD regarding
that proposal.

1012
01:03:54,891 --> 01:03:58,691
That means our MD Shweta
will meet their MD.

1013
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:02,594
There they will be introduced
to each other.

1014
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:04,265
You will introduce
her to his father?

1015
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:06,858
It won't look so good I think.
- His son is the MD there.

1016
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,665
It's not his father.
- I see. It would be great.

1017
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:11,899
It's a great idea, isn't it?
It's a great idea indeed.

1018
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:14,605
Oh! When did you come, dear?

1019
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,805
Why are you standing there?

1020
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:19,711
We were talking about
your marriage. Come.

1021
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:27,220
You or Vijju?
- Visva thought about it first...

1022
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:30,258
...and as we liked the plan
we too gave our approval.

1023
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:34,624
You have got a great talent.

1024
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:37,223
Why don't you start
a marriage bureau?

1025
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:44,630
No, baby. No. - He is Rakesh.
He is a master of all trades.

1026
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,868
Today it's Thursday. So
I am into social service.

1027
01:04:48,444 --> 01:04:51,880
We shall meet tomorrow. Ok? Bye.

1028
01:04:55,418 --> 01:04:58,353
An admirer. She's giving
me a tough time.

1029
01:04:58,454 --> 01:05:01,355
Rakesh.
- Hi.

1030
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:06,327
Hi, Sheela!
- Hi.

1031
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,763
What's the matter! You said
you would pick me up...

1032
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:10,957
...this morning, but you didn't?

1033
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,598
I waited for you for one hour.
- No, baby.

1034
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:15,261
Actually he had to talk
about some important...

1035
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:16,395
...business matters. So
I am sitting with him.

1036
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:19,007
Can you bring two glasses of juices
from the cottage? - Ok.

1037
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:26,339
She is also an admirer or yours?
- Girlfriend.

1038
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,385
Are you marrying her?
- I might have to.

1039
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,617
So you are not interested
in marrying Shweta? - What!

1040
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,821
Till now I was talking
to you about business.

1041
01:05:40,663 --> 01:05:44,292
But coming to personal matters,
they are thinking of...

1042
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,335
...making an alliance with you.
- With me?

1043
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:49,370
But Shweta should like me first.

1044
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,771
We will make sure she likes you.
- Really?

1045
01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:58,372
How would this benefit you?
- Why?

1046
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:01,312
Tomorrow won't you make me the GM...

1047
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:03,317
...of one of your companies?
- I will make you...

1048
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:05,751
...a member of the board
of directors. - Ok.

1049
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:12,387
You will meet her at 6
pm tomorrow at Kofta.

1050
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:15,027
At Kofta? In that restaurant?

1051
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,398
Taj would be better, right?

1052
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,625
As far as I know Kofta
is a different place.

1053
01:06:20,536 --> 01:06:22,333
And Shweta likes those
who are different...

1054
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,565
...and who do different things.

1055
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:27,407
She gets impressed pretty fast.

1056
01:06:28,644 --> 01:06:29,770
You can tell me if you
still don't like it...

1057
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:32,347
I will arrange it in Taj.
- No. No. No.

1058
01:06:32,581 --> 01:06:33,707
Kofta is the best.

1059
01:06:34,984 --> 01:06:37,714
Smart guy. By the way...

1060
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:42,355
...Shweta should not know
about this girlfriend...

1061
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,756
...and that girlfriend...

1062
01:06:45,728 --> 01:06:47,923
She doesn't tolerate
such things at all.

1063
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:50,722
Juice.

1064
01:06:57,873 --> 01:07:01,400
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
Goodbye. - Ok.

1065
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:05,371
Rakesh, it's Sampat's birthday
party at 6 O' clock...

1066
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:07,779
...tomorrow evening. You
remember it, don't you?

1067
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:08,907
6 O' clock?

1068
01:07:10,786 --> 01:07:11,980
But I have got a business
meeting to attend.

1069
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,926
Now I will give the final
touch to my plan.

1070
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:22,463
What's the matter, Vissu,
you are so serious?

1071
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,500
Am I serious or am I upset?

1072
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:32,407
You look upset. - They are
fixing our Shweta's match...

1073
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:34,499
...with KSL Group's Rakesh.

1074
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,874
Wow! Very good.

1075
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:40,949
But why are you feeling
bad about it?

1076
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,484
He has got a girlfriend in
every town, you know that?

1077
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:44,810
It's Sheela in this town.

1078
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:46,945
Tomorrow there's a meeting
between them.

1079
01:07:47,556 --> 01:07:49,023
I know what would happen after that.

1080
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,956
As per the plan they will think
of marriage after that.

1081
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,660
Shall we tell her about him?

1082
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,654
They won't believe it if
we tell them straight.

1083
01:07:56,499 --> 01:07:57,864
They must see the
truth on their own.

1084
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:01,435
And how would that happen?
- If Sheela comes...

1085
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:04,438
...and questions him what he
is doing with another girl...

1086
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,441
...and crushes him right
in front of Shweta...

1087
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:09,977
...then they would know about him.
- Great. Great.

1088
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,480
I hope God comes down
and makes that happen.

1089
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:19,520
Even a Goddess will do.
- Vissu, I will do that.

1090
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:21,447
What?
- I will call Sheela and tell her...

1091
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:23,457
...that her boyfriend is betraying
her and going out...

1092
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,993
...with another girl behind
her back. - Ramya.

1093
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:29,997
It's wrong.
- Come on, Vissu! What's wrong!

1094
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,559
What's wrong? If the same happens
to your girlfriend...

1095
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:35,460
No. No. No. Would you think
the same way if the same...

1096
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:36,629
...happens to your sister?

1097
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:42,675
No, I won't. - Oh! I wish we
had Sheela's phone number.

1098
01:08:43,012 --> 01:08:47,972
9399332529.
- Vissu, you have Sheela's number?

1099
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:51,678
I got it by accident. - You got
Sheela's number by accident.

1100
01:08:51,787 --> 01:08:54,119
Really! God's play.
- Yes, God's play.

1101
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,750
Tell me the number.
Tell me the number.

1102
01:08:56,058 --> 01:08:58,492
Hello! Is it Miss. Sheela?
I need to talk to you...

1103
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:01,961
...about something very
important. Yes.

1104
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:04,498
'Poor Ramya! Though
she is a good girl... '

1105
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,865
'... she can be easily pushed
into a well.' - Rakesh...

1106
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:10,798
And their meeting was set
in that ugly restaurant.

1107
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:14,174
One, please...

1108
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:15,968
You naughty.

1109
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:24,182
Actually I come here for
the business meetings.

1110
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:27,822
It's a bit formal and different...

1111
01:09:33,028 --> 01:09:34,825
Come on, baby!
- Hey, you!

1112
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:39,794
I never came here with girls.

1113
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:41,861
I don't have girlfriends.

1114
01:09:43,639 --> 01:09:45,197
My mind is always into business.

1115
01:09:46,842 --> 01:09:47,866
Which business?

1116
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,608
I mean you are into a
number of businesses.

1117
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:53,609
So which business do you handle...

1118
01:09:53,716 --> 01:09:56,082
There's no specific one. I
handle all the businesses.

1119
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,551
It would be great if
we start together...

1120
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:00,815
...a pharmaceutical company.
- What!

1121
01:10:01,724 --> 01:10:03,715
Waiter. Waiter.

1122
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,268
You were talking about some tie-up.
- We shall talk about it.

1123
01:10:14,937 --> 01:10:16,063
Let's order the dinner first.

1124
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:23,935
She's asking something.
Give her the details.

1125
01:10:26,315 --> 01:10:29,284
What's going on over here?
- Business meeting.

1126
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:33,079
Give me a kiss.

1127
01:10:34,623 --> 01:10:35,647
Here?

1128
01:10:36,725 --> 01:10:40,252
Who is this girl?
- I'm his girlfriend.

1129
01:10:42,264 --> 01:10:44,994
But you told me that you
don't have a girlfriend.

1130
01:10:46,735 --> 01:10:48,327
He said that he doesn't
have a girlfriend?

1131
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:52,699
You...
- Sheela... - Rascal!

1132
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,607
Don't hit me, Sheela. Sheela.

1133
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:57,805
No, Sheela.
- Stop.

1134
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:01,676
Don't hit me, Sheela.
- You were trying to cheat me?

1135
01:11:01,784 --> 01:11:05,686
Don't hit me.
- Scoundrel. Loader. I'm going to...

1136
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,887
Rakesh's father is
such a decent man.

1137
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:11,921
But he is diametrically opposite.

1138
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:14,026
How can he arrange the meeting
at such a place!

1139
01:11:14,697 --> 01:11:16,688
Vissu, don't you know
about that place?

1140
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,633
I don't know, sir.
- Thank God! We are lucky that we...

1141
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:22,363
...knew his real nature in
the first meeting itself.

1142
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:23,795
What would we have done if
we came to know about him...

1143
01:11:23,906 --> 01:11:24,930
...after marriage?
- Come on!

1144
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:26,774
Two people don't get married
in the first meeting itself.

1145
01:11:27,009 --> 01:11:28,306
Wouldn't you have taken
a decision tomorrow...

1146
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,638
...if things wouldn't
have gone wrong?

1147
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:30,837
It was not completely my decision.

1148
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:32,709
That day you too nodded your
head like an ox, didn't you?

1149
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:34,214
I nodded my head like an ox?
- Sir. Sir. Sir.

1150
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:35,840
You both please don't fight.

1151
01:11:36,985 --> 01:11:38,145
It was my fault.

1152
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:40,185
I'm the one who said good
things about him to you.

1153
01:11:40,389 --> 01:11:42,653
It's not your fault, Visva. You
are a good fellow. That's why...

1154
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:44,726
...every person appears like
a good person to you.

1155
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:46,988
And I don't need such sort of guys.

1156
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,095
I need a good boy for my
girl, not a rich boy.

1157
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:51,325
And who will look
after our business?

1158
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:54,027
Who said that good boys don't
look after the business?

1159
01:11:54,136 --> 01:11:56,400
Tel me. - Don't shout. She's
already feeling bad about it.

1160
01:11:57,172 --> 01:11:59,367
Poor girl! I wonder how upset
she is after this incident.

1161
01:11:59,908 --> 01:12:01,239
I will talk to her.

1162
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:24,732
Hi, Shweta!
- Hi, Vijju.

1163
01:12:27,336 --> 01:12:31,272
Sorry, Shweta. I didn't know
it would turn out this way.

1164
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,099
I didn't expect him to be
such sort of a person.

1165
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:39,713
I am really very sorry. - Come on,
Vijju. It's not your fault.

1166
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,247
It happened for the good, you know.

1167
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:44,416
It happened for our benefit only.

1168
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:50,288
I am not interested in the
guys of their choice.

1169
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:55,260
Do you like someone in particular?

1170
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:11,470
You are my childhood friend.
You are my best friend.

1171
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,206
I don't know if I can
tell you this or not.

1172
01:13:17,986 --> 01:13:19,977
I will tell you what's
there in my heart.

1173
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:23,984
You won't mind it, will you?

1174
01:13:25,994 --> 01:13:27,461
If it's wrong, forget it right here.

1175
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:33,766
I felt like telling this
to you a while ago...

1176
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:38,897
...when we spent time together
in Vizag. - Tell me, Shweta.

1177
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:53,785
Love gives us such a hard time...

1178
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,858
...till it's hidden in
the heart, right?

1179
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,354
It tickles your heart.

1180
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,493
Actually... Actually...

1181
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:11,001
Actually till we say it...
- We can live in peace.

1182
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:12,130
Correct.

1183
01:14:13,976 --> 01:14:15,876
Do you love someone Shweta?

1184
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:20,539
Siddharth.

1185
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:28,823
Yes.
- Yes, Siddharth. - Siddharth?

1186
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:32,223
Yes, I like Siddharth a lot, Vijju.

1187
01:14:33,862 --> 01:14:35,887
Siddharth who?

1188
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:40,834
You don't know him. I can talk
to my parents about it...

1189
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:43,837
...but daddy wants a son-in-law
who would look after...

1190
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:46,499
...his business and property...

1191
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:48,908
That's what Siddharth
doesn't want to do.

1192
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:50,337
He gave up his already
flourishing business.

1193
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,505
You know that?
- Their mentalities don't match.

1194
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:57,041
It's only you who can bring
them together, Vijju.

1195
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:00,186
Daddy trusts you. That's why
I am telling you this.

1196
01:15:00,522 --> 01:15:03,855
You are a genius. You can fix
anything. Please help me out...

1197
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:07,360
...with this assuming it
to be another project.

1198
01:15:08,263 --> 01:15:11,027
Miss, sir's calling you.
- Coming.

1199
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,196
I'm putting my love in your hands.

1200
01:15:16,104 --> 01:15:18,538
You must help me succeed
it. You can do it.

1201
01:15:18,974 --> 01:15:21,169
I will give you the rest of the
details when I'll be back.

1202
01:15:21,276 --> 01:15:23,403
Don't go anywhere. I'll
send coffee for you.

1203
01:15:43,656 --> 01:15:45,180
Stop there. You might fall.

1204
01:15:46,659 --> 01:15:48,456
Vijju, so what did
you think about it?

1205
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:52,520
About Siddharth's matter. What
are you planning to do?

1206
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,729
When you said you like him so
much I thought you know him.

1207
01:15:59,672 --> 01:16:02,004
You say you gathered all the
information about him...

1208
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:04,098
...in Canada. You say he's your
friend's friend's cousin.

1209
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:05,503
How can you like someone so much...

1210
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:07,044
...whom you don't even know!

1211
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,511
Don't we love cinema stars
and crickets stars...

1212
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:11,446
...without knowing who they are?

1213
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:14,083
It's something like that.

1214
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,418
He has got some great qualities.

1215
01:16:18,624 --> 01:16:22,025
You know, he left business
worth crores and crores...

1216
01:16:22,127 --> 01:16:25,722
...and settled here.
- I don't know...

1217
01:16:27,066 --> 01:16:28,363
I am not convinced yet.

1218
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:33,531
Look, if you meet him once
you will get convinced.

1219
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:41,321
Shweta, I don't interfere in
others' personal matters.

1220
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,649
And Rakesh's matter?
Wasn't it personal?

1221
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,157
You tied to set us up as you
thought he'd be apt for me...

1222
01:16:48,262 --> 01:16:50,890
You praised him in front of
daddy like nothing else.

1223
01:16:51,932 --> 01:16:56,494
Wasn't it my personal matter?
- That's a different thing.

1224
01:16:57,605 --> 01:16:59,232
But this matter looks a bit risky.

1225
01:16:59,807 --> 01:17:03,265
What's the risk for you in it?
What do you stand to lose?

1226
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:07,179
Earlier I did it with your
father's knowledge.

1227
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:09,673
But now I am scared as
you are asking me...

1228
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:10,807
...to do something without
his knowledge.

1229
01:17:11,518 --> 01:17:12,542
You won't help me?

1230
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:16,620
No, I won't.

1231
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:30,726
Sorry, Vijju. I can understand
your worry.

1232
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:37,934
It didn't go well when you tried
to set me up with Rakesh.

1233
01:17:38,312 --> 01:17:41,611
It's quite natural for you
to worry. I understand it.

1234
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:47,344
Shweta, you like him. But
he should also like you.

1235
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,287
That's the reason I am
handing it over to you.

1236
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:53,221
It's a child's play for
your genius brain...

1237
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:55,625
...to make him fall in love with you.

1238
01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:00,325
You are a man capable of
selling ice in Himalayas.

1239
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:01,526
This is no hard for you.

1240
01:18:04,438 --> 01:18:08,932
Look, I think you treat my
happiness as your happiness.

1241
01:18:10,878 --> 01:18:13,847
Can't you do such a
simple thing for me?

1242
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:19,348
Shweta, what are you both doing
there? - Nothing, daddy.

1243
01:18:19,453 --> 01:18:22,251
We are discussing which
place would be more apt...

1244
01:18:22,356 --> 01:18:25,348
...for our pharmaceutical company,
Vizag or Tirupati...

1245
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:28,292
Do one thing. Start the
company in this club.

1246
01:18:29,863 --> 01:18:31,421
You are talking about
work here as well?

1247
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:33,363
Come, let's have lunch.
- Ok, dad.

1248
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:37,598
You'll do it, won't you, Vijju?

1249
01:18:41,642 --> 01:18:44,338
Ok.
- Thank you.

1250
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,945
I'll kill you. I'll
kill you, trust me.

1251
01:18:54,388 --> 01:18:56,822
What did I ask you to send us
and what did you send me?

1252
01:18:57,424 --> 01:18:58,448
I asked you send me
two tonic bottles...

1253
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,753
...and you sent me
mouse-killing drugs?

1254
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,885
Mistake? What if someone
had consumed it and died?

1255
01:19:01,995 --> 01:19:03,019
Hey, where are you going?

1256
01:19:03,497 --> 01:19:06,523
Yes! - Where are you going?
- Yes, I finished the meals.

1257
01:19:07,501 --> 01:19:12,370
Hey, take him inside. Hey, I'm
the sole authority here.

1258
01:19:12,473 --> 01:19:14,907
Don't mess with me.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1259
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:16,734
He hung up the phone.

1260
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:18,738
He dared to mess with
a Gandhi follower.

1261
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:31,019
Hey, what's that? What's that?

1262
01:19:32,426 --> 01:19:33,450
Pick it up.

1263
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:37,395
This is Gandhi old-age home.

1264
01:19:37,498 --> 01:19:38,726
This is where cleanliness resides.

1265
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:40,527
What brought you here? Do you
have any of yours inside?

1266
01:19:40,634 --> 01:19:41,999
No.
- Then what brought you here?

1267
01:19:42,102 --> 01:19:43,694
We were walking by and
just dropped in.

1268
01:19:43,804 --> 01:19:44,998
This is not some bar
and restaurant...

1269
01:19:45,105 --> 01:19:46,402
...that you could drop
in just like that.

1270
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:48,998
We wanted to see this place.
- What do you want to see?

1271
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:50,804
You think some sort of circus
is going on over here?

1272
01:19:51,545 --> 01:19:53,877
This is where Gandhi Nilayam.
Old age home. Get lost.

1273
01:19:55,783 --> 01:19:57,876
That's not the thing, sir. Actually
we were... - Get lost!

1274
01:19:57,985 --> 01:20:00,351
Get lost!
- Please listen to me once, sir.

1275
01:20:00,454 --> 01:20:04,356
Hey, you! You are trying to
dominate us with violence...

1276
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,358
...in Gandhi old-age home.

1277
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,620
Do you know the value of this cap?

1278
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:10,492
This is the back that broke
the back of the British.

1279
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,531
You dared to mess with us?
- No, sir...

1280
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:14,897
I'll kill you.
- Listen to me, sir.

1281
01:20:15,002 --> 01:20:16,367
Please listen, sir.
- You dared to mess with me.

1282
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,494
What do you think of yourself!
- Leave him, sir.

1283
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:18,628
Do not mess with me.
- Uncle. Uncle.

1284
01:20:18,739 --> 01:20:19,763
What! What!
- Calm down. Calm down.

1285
01:20:19,873 --> 01:20:20,897
Calm down.
- What are you talking?

1286
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:23,499
Control. Control. Calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

1287
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,374
They were trespassing and
I asked them politely...

1288
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,573
...to step back, but they in
turn tried to use violence...

1289
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:29,979
I'll handle them, uncle.

1290
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:32,449
Sorry. Sorry. Please don't mind.
- What!

1291
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:34,851
You are apologizing to them?
What did Gandhi say?

1292
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:35,979
He said that we should apologize...

1293
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:37,454
...only when we have done
some mistake. - Ok. Ok.

1294
01:20:37,558 --> 01:20:40,925
Uncle, the pump set is not working.
Please look into it.

1295
01:20:41,028 --> 01:20:42,052
The pump set is not working?

1296
01:20:42,162 --> 01:20:45,689
It must be that Satti. I will
see him. - Please carry on.

1297
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,696
They are breaking the pump
set 20 times a month.

1298
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:48,961
He thinks his father pays for it?

1299
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:50,902
Actually what happened is that...

1300
01:20:51,004 --> 01:20:54,098
My uncle is a short-tempered person.

1301
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:55,872
It's an everyday sight for us.

1302
01:20:57,444 --> 01:20:58,502
By the way, I'm Siddharth.

1303
01:21:01,615 --> 01:21:04,914
Visvak Sen.
- Nice name. Visvak Sen.

1304
01:21:06,053 --> 01:21:08,112
What's his name?
- Zakir.

1305
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,519
We came to see the nearby lands.

1306
01:21:12,092 --> 01:21:14,424
We came to know that there's
a beautiful farm house here...

1307
01:21:14,528 --> 01:21:16,894
...and so we came to see it once.
- Of course. Why not?

1308
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,430
My pleasure. Please come.

1309
01:21:19,066 --> 01:21:22,035
This is my old-age home. My
farmhouse is on that side.

1310
01:21:23,537 --> 01:21:26,165
You're the one who runs this
old-age home? - No. No.

1311
01:21:26,974 --> 01:21:28,441
My grandfather looks into it.
- So you don't have...

1312
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,442
...your parents?
- Yes, I have.

1313
01:21:30,544 --> 01:21:31,943
Where are they?
- In Bangalore.

1314
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:33,137
Then what are you doing here?

1315
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:35,581
Does it bother you if I stay here?

1316
01:21:36,116 --> 01:21:37,447
No, he means why you are living
in a place like this...

1317
01:21:37,551 --> 01:21:39,678
...instead of living in the city.

1318
01:21:43,824 --> 01:21:44,950
I like this environment.

1319
01:21:45,559 --> 01:21:48,892
These trees, this air, what
more can we ask for?

1320
01:21:49,129 --> 01:21:50,153
Please come.

1321
01:22:02,509 --> 01:22:04,636
Come. Come. This is my farmhouse.

1322
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:06,042
Do you like it?
- Ya.

1323
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,104
Please come.

1324
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:11,744
Brother, there's a small car.
It's great, isn't it?

1325
01:22:11,852 --> 01:22:12,876
Zakir.
- It's ok.

1326
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:20,854
That's 1920s Rolls Royce.

1327
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:24,095
I like collecting antics.
Please come.

1328
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,131
This is my living room, bed room,
dining room, all in all...

1329
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:37,600
Please have your seat.

1330
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:40,513
And what about you?
Are you thinking of...

1331
01:22:40,614 --> 01:22:42,878
...purchasing the lands around here?
- No. No.

1332
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,582
I am the project manager in
Sri Krishna Pharmaceuticals.

1333
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:48,013
I came to survey the
sight for my factory.

1334
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:52,591
So we can expect this peace
for a few more days.

1335
01:22:53,193 --> 01:22:55,024
How would there be development...

1336
01:22:55,128 --> 01:22:57,221
...without factories and industries?
- No. No.

1337
01:22:57,864 --> 01:22:59,525
There should be factories,
but there are some...

1338
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:01,601
...selected places for them.

1339
01:23:01,702 --> 01:23:04,193
I mean if we transform all the
agricultural land into factories...

1340
01:23:04,304 --> 01:23:05,532
...in the name of development
then we would be...

1341
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:08,199
...harming ourselves.

1342
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,009
Today the vegetable rates have
increased in Hyderabad.

1343
01:23:13,914 --> 01:23:16,280
Because the agricultural
lands are shrinking.

1344
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,751
It seems that you have a
sound business knowledge.

1345
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,652
I was running an iron
business in Singapore.

1346
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:26,782
After that I gave up. Now I am
in farming. Organic farming.

1347
01:23:27,861 --> 01:23:31,058
And I am also helping my
grandfather's old-age home.

1348
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,235
You mean you won't do
business anymore.

1349
01:23:37,904 --> 01:23:39,166
Farming is also a business,
isn't it?

1350
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:42,098
I am just joking.

1351
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:46,768
I am still in touch with the
business that you meant.

1352
01:23:47,114 --> 01:23:49,776
I conduct seminars
on human relations.

1353
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:53,714
I believe in business
with a human face.

1354
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,960
Ok. Fine.

1355
01:24:02,295 --> 01:24:03,319
I'll make a move.

1356
01:24:04,264 --> 01:24:05,288
Goodbye.

1357
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:09,697
Why didn't you still get married?

1358
01:24:09,936 --> 01:24:12,666
Tell me if you know a nice
girl. I'll marry her.

1359
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:26,651
Come, let's talk in the garden.

1360
01:24:26,953 --> 01:24:28,614
Vissu, a few days ago in
a party in Taj Banjara...

1361
01:24:28,722 --> 01:24:31,885
...I asked you to take Mr.
Pandey's number, didn't I?

1362
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:33,016
What was that number again?

1363
01:24:33,126 --> 01:24:35,617
Personal matter can wait, dad.
I called him here...

1364
01:24:35,729 --> 01:24:37,890
...to talk about some important
business matters. - Ok. Ok.

1365
01:24:37,998 --> 01:24:39,022
I'll take that number later on.

1366
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:41,758
Come. Come.

1367
01:24:42,069 --> 01:24:43,730
Bhargavi, keep it inside.
- Ok.

1368
01:24:45,138 --> 01:24:46,162
Did you see him?

1369
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,064
Did you meet him?

1370
01:24:48,842 --> 01:24:49,866
Did you like him?

1371
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:53,946
Not bad.
- Not bad?

1372
01:24:54,314 --> 01:24:56,009
Come on! He looks great.

1373
01:24:56,883 --> 01:25:00,375
I saw his photos. He's
very good-looking.

1374
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:06,953
I don't get it, Shweta, how'd
it work between you two?

1375
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,885
You are a happy-go-lucky
sort of a person.

1376
01:25:10,697 --> 01:25:13,666
And he's a guy who took
retirement at 30...

1377
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,962
...and living a life in exile in
that farmhouse. - You are right.

1378
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:17,964
That's the reason it would work.

1379
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:22,064
When I would say yes,
he would say no.

1380
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:26,143
When he would say yes,
I would say no.

1381
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,840
There will be tiffs and fights
in a fun sort of way...

1382
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:34,312
All my life would be a beautiful
honeymoon, Vijju.

1383
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:41,226
And you are convinced
over all, right?

1384
01:25:43,363 --> 01:25:44,921
How are you thinking of
introducing him to me?

1385
01:26:03,817 --> 01:26:09,016
You must be thinking a master
plan to unite us, right?

1386
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:13,258
Tell me what it is.
Tell me. Tell me.

1387
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,058
It's nothing, Shweta.
- No, there must be something.

1388
01:26:17,164 --> 01:26:20,065
Tell me. Tell me. Please tell me.

1389
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:21,191
There's nothing really.

1390
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:25,861
I don't have much idea how
to tackle such matters.

1391
01:26:29,276 --> 01:26:31,744
Let's do one thing then. Take
me there and tell him...

1392
01:26:31,845 --> 01:26:35,337
...and you brought your madam
to show the lands.

1393
01:26:36,016 --> 01:26:39,179
Then he would see me and
get tempted. - No!

1394
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:43,749
No means?
- My friendship with him should be...

1395
01:26:43,857 --> 01:26:46,951
...a bit deeper in order
to introduce you to him.

1396
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:48,894
Then my job will be easier.

1397
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,022
Psychological point.

1398
01:26:56,903 --> 01:26:57,927
Do one thing.

1399
01:26:58,939 --> 01:27:02,033
Take the video camera with you
tomorrow and shoot him...

1400
01:27:03,276 --> 01:27:05,767
I want to see what he says,
how he talks...

1401
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:09,007
...what sort of dresses he wears,
what his style is...

1402
01:27:09,249 --> 01:27:10,841
I want to see him, Vijju.

1403
01:27:13,553 --> 01:27:15,783
Since the last 12 years you are
the only girl in my mind...

1404
01:27:15,889 --> 01:27:18,323
No other girl ever crossed
my mind even once.

1405
01:27:18,425 --> 01:27:19,483
Can't you see me in front of you?

1406
01:27:20,393 --> 01:27:21,792
So today that ugly fellow in
the outskirts of the town...

1407
01:27:21,895 --> 01:27:24,022
...who sells vegetables has become
more important to you?

1408
01:27:24,564 --> 01:27:27,294
No, I won't accept it. I won't
accept it at any cost.

1409
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,424
I won't accept it!

1410
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:30,193
What happened, Vijju?

1411
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:33,296
Nothing.

1412
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,983
I'm thinking. - Think about it.
Think about it, Vijju.

1413
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:47,885
I am eagerly waiting
to meet him, Vijju.

1414
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,680
What's the rush, Shweta?
