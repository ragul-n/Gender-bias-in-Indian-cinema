1
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,410
Sorry.

2
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey! Catch him. Catch him.

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,660
This guy in a scuffle with a female 
the constable of lucknow police,...

4
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,790
...seems like a terrorist.

5
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,290
But he's not.

6
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,000
So the question that arises is...

7
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,410
how did this young man land up in 
this criminal like situation.

8
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,830
And if the question arises 
then let it... because...

9
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,950
There is no question that does 
not find a answer in Uttar Pradesh.

10
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,790
You've rocked the damn district 
Chintu Tyagi.. You've topped it!

11
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,120
And I have rocked the damn country.. 
I've ranked 34th!

12
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,040
I topped my exams, Dad.

13
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,580
My Topper...

14
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,000
Not even a peep from Hitler Tyagi.

15
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,540
What's there for him to say? First, 
you aced your engineering exams...

16
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,500
...and now the Civil 
Works Entrance exams.

17
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,160
Let's plan a bachelor trip together.

18
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,330
No pressures in life ever again.

19
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,870
"No but, no why... 
Free-free bird in blue-blue sky."

20
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,910
Meet, Mr. and Mrs. Tyagi.

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,370
- Hello. 
- And that's Mr. and Mrs. Tripathi.

22
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,580
And I'm the would be bride's uncle... 
B.R. Pandey

23
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,790
and that's

24
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,790
...Sharma's samosas.

25
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,790
Have a sweet.

26
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,410
Have some tea?

27
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Do you watch too many films, 
Mr. Tyagi?

28
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,080
The girl serving the tea doesn't 
always have to be the would be bride.

29
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,540
Chit..

30
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,660
So...what are your hobbies?

31
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,910
I like sex a lot.

32
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,830
- I see... 
- What?

33
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,370
you've come with a list of questions?

34
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,700
I am an Engineer you see...

35
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,700
So I always come prepared.

36
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,950
Do you see that motorcycle 
blocking the road?

37
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,410
Yes.....we also had to circle around 
the block to get here.

38
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Belongs to my ex-boyfriend.

39
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,330
We broke up six months ago 
but he still hasn't gotten over me.

40
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,830
He parked it there day 
before yesterday in anger

41
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,120
In a dare to see who gets 
a marriage proposal for me

42
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,160
So you don't want to get married?

43
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,750
If I didn't want to.... 
you wouldn't have been sipping tea here!

44
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,000
Rebellion did not suit me....

45
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,870
So I thought I'll try restriction now.

46
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,410
I guarantee you, I did that honestly.... 
and will do this honestly too...

47
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,870
I'm just a little 
high maintenance though.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,290
Emotionally.

49
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,790
And I've never got a chance 
to display my emotions.

50
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
So what say, Mr. Tyagi?

51
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,450
If virginity is not an issue...

52
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,830
...should we release traffic?

53
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,910
That way, the bride and groom are that way. 
Why are you giving it to me?

54
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,290
- Greetings! 
- There he is.

55
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,910
- Where were you? 
- Well, I was just...

56
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,950
Why are you 'all up in knots' 
at your own wedding?

57
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Hello, uncle. How are you?

58
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm just a bit...

59
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,620
I'm just a bit nervous.

60
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,160
Come with me. 
I have a cure for your nervousness.

61
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,370
I'll count the envelopes...

62
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,410
I'll be right back.

63
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,080
- Where are you going? 
- I'll just keep this somewhere and come

64
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,500
Scram. Come on.

65
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,000
Hold it.

66
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
Out with it. 
So what's making you nervous?

67
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,950
I don't know why but I've been 
thinking about 'Neha' all evening.

68
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,330
Who 'Neha'?

69
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
What do you mean who Neha?

70
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,370
Neha Singh.

71
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,580
My ex from I.T.

72
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,750
Are you out of your mind?

73
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Here.. you're on the 
verge of becoming a president here...

74
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,370
...and you can't get over 
an old campaign partner

75
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,790
She dumped you three 
years ago without giving you a reason.

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,750
Exactly.

77
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,870
I just had one relationship in life 
which lasted for one n half months.

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,790
And here I am making a life-long commitment 
to someone I spent less than a minute with.

79
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,790
Dad, I tell you!

80
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,450
Chintu Tyagi.

81
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,750
Stop this pysco babble..

82
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,250
Down this drink and get on the stage! 
Be a man!

83
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,790
Drama queen.

84
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,580
Wanna be Romeo! Idiot.

85
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,700
What took you?

86
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,830
- Where were you? 
- Congratulations.

87
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,000
- Welcome, Welcome.... 
- Hello, welcome.

88
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,080
All by yourself...Huh

89
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,870
"My eyes are asking."

90
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,500
"My heart doesn't have peace 
where should I look?"

91
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,290
"Where are you looking?"

92
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,620
"How do I tell you that 
I keep waiting for you?"

93
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,750
"Stolen my slumber.... 
you have stolen my slumber "

94
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,330
"My heartbeat says..."

95
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,290
"My heart won't beat without you."

96
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,620
"You are the only one I have. 
What do I have to do with the world?"

97
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,660
"You are my nights. You are my days."

98
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,250
"I don't want to live 
a moment without you."

99
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,290
"You are my nights. You are my days."

100
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,120
"I don't want to live a moment.."

101
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,450
"..without you."

102
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,160
" my journey is with you."

103
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,910
"Where do I want to go?"

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,200
"I want to spend my life with you."

105
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,250
"Don't stay away from me.."

106
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,790
"..even for a moment."

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,200
"You are the only one I have. 
What do I have to do with the world?"

108
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,830
"My eyes say you should always 
be in front of me."

109
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,620
"You are the only one I have. 
What do I have to do with the world?"

110
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,000
"You are the only one I have. 
What do I have to do with the world?"

111
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,500
So... 
Chintu Tyagi...

112
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,290
How's work?

113
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,250
Great, Dad!

114
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,290
- Good. 
- Thank you.

115
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,040
So now....what have you thought 
about the future...?

116
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,250
About what, Dad?

117
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,410
I mean future... you 
know...future... future!

118
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,370
Stop all this word play both of you...

119
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,330
I'll come straight to the point.

120
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,830
You have been married 
for three years now.

121
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,790
What have you thought 
about starting a family?

122
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,660
I'm giving it a thought mom!

123
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,870
I don't know much about now son..

124
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,830
...but back in our days, we didn't 
have to give a thought to have kids.

125
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,250
We had to give quite "something else"

126
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,290
One must have a reason to have a child.

127
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,910
What was our reason to have you then?

128
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,040
Pray...do enlighten us?

129
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,200
Ask dad about it

130
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,660
Listen...Chintu...

131
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,290
You always have time to discuss about 
things that are out of context.

132
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,160
But never about what is required

133
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,660
Every Sunday you hear the same advice 
on starting a family...

134
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,290
...but ever seem to talk 
to them about us shifting to Delhi.

135
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,540
You're always going 
on and on about Delhi

136
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,290
...like every developer out there is waiting 
for me with baited breath, almost wishing?

137
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,660
chintu tyagi will come one day 
and take over our business"

138
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,410
Delhi is the capital of this 
Country, not my father's property.

139
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,830
Where there's a will, 
there's a way, Mr Tyagi.

140
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,330
And where there's love, 
there's concern.

141
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,450
I've told you a million 
times "Get out in the open"

142
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,870
"Make a prize catch" 
But no...

143
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,040
What can one do if someone enjoys being 
tamed by a ring master in a circus?

144
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,370
Are you calling me a circus tiger?

145
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,660
I'm at least calling you a tiger 
because I am your wife.

146
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,000
Those unwilling to get out of a pond are 
deserved to be called toads.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,580
Toad it is then! 
I am happy in my pond....

148
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,870
And I am going to hop around here only

149
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,620
Fine, hop all you like

150
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,910
But don't expect me to produce tadpoles.

151
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,910
I was born here.

152
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,330
This city gave me name, 
fame and my reputation.

153
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,450
What's wrong with Kanpur? 
Kanpur never got in my way... ever.

154
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,000
Move it, bro.

155
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,040
Why can't you just call?

156
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,950
Why do you make missed calls like 
a petty thief?

157
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,790
It's bad enough I Give you time.... 
You want talk time too?

158
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,500
Yes, after all your time 
is getting expensive.

159
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,120
Gupta had no idea what's going on.

160
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,290
He ran around all day with a 
radio in his hand like a clueless alien

161
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,950
And I was just....

162
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,000
Hello, Mr. Chintu Tyagi, 
where's your attention?

163
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,580
What is it?

164
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,000
Before passing 10th grade.. 
dad said...

165
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,290
...if I ace 10th grade, 
life will be a bed of roses.

166
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,620
He said the same thing 
before 12th grade..

167
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,080
Upon the promise of this "bed of roses"

168
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,830
... he got me to do engineering, 
Get a job, and even get married.

169
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,250
So now this "bed of roses" 
is not in my fate,

170
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,950
...or then my own dad screwed me over.

171
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,040
What's troubling you lord Buddha?

172
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,790
You have everything in life.

173
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,950
A home, a car, a reputation...you are an 
officer in the Public Works Department.

174
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,450
Who do you want to be now? Superman?

175
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,370
You get it? don't you?

176
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,290
Then why doesn't my wife get it?

177
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,250
Was it the same old 
Delhi argument again?

178
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,750
Sister-in-law gets too tough sometimes.

179
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,450
Sometimes I feel, 
only Neha loved me truly!

180
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,540
Why do you always get stuck on Neha?

181
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,910
You really piss me off.

182
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,330
Look...in life... 
there's a reality and a fantasy!

183
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,500
Who?

184
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,700
Fantasy buddy, fantasy!

185
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,830
Everyone has a right to fantasy.

186
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,330
But you cannot forget 
your reality for that.

187
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,290
And this is your reality.

188
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,700
- And Delhi? 
- Stop your stupid rant.

189
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,410
I'll bring Delhi for you right here.

190
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Good morning, sir. 
Mr. Sharma is calling you.

191
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,160
- Again? 
- Yes sir.

192
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,370
What the hell Bablu? 
This betel leaf is abnoxious.

193
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,580
It's bullshit.

194
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,410
Did you not like it sir?

195
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,290
Spit it out if you don't like it.

196
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,830
I'll make you another one.

197
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,120
Hey!

198
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,250
Spring has arrived in Kanpur city,

199
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,290
and nobody informed me...

200
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,450
Look.

201
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,830
What is she doing here?

202
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,500
There's no way she's coming here.... 
must be her spot to meet her boyfriend.

203
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,750
She is coming this way, sir.

204
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,790
Damn! She is coming this way!

205
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,200
My Betel leaf timing is completey flop

206
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,750
- Hi... 
- Hello.

207
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,540
Hi...

208
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,450
Which way is the plot 
Liasoning department?

209
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,870
Plot liasoning department?

210
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,620
It's our department, sir.

211
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
Oh yes! That's our department, 
in this building.

212
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,330
I wanted to meet 
Mr. Yugal Kishore Sharma.

213
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,870
- Sharma? There's no one here by that name... 
- Sharma is our boss, sir.

214
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,450
Our boss! of course!

215
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,200
You know what, 
take the third floor to the first lift.

216
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,540
I mean...take the third 
lift to the first floor.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,040
It's the brown door 
in the corridor on the right.

218
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,080
He'll be waiting for you there.

219
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,290
Ok... Thank you.

220
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,750
Pleasure is all mine.

221
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,660
Always.

222
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,040
Damn it.

223
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,830
Hello.

224
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,330
Chintu Tyagi, you won't believe 
what just happened with your brother.

225
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,120
You don't work.. that's okay..

226
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,660
why do you insist on eating your head

227
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,040
It's not about eating your head 
its about scratching it.

228
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,410
Take a wild guess who 
just came to meet Mr. Sharma.

229
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,660
- Who has come? 
- Who has come?..

230
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,580
You should ask who hasn't come

231
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,330
Remember that poem by Javed Akhtar...

232
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,830
"Like a budding rose, like a 
poet's dream, like the rays of the sun."

233
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,250
"Ain't no sunshine 
when she's gone" Buddy!

234
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,830
Are you high? 
Hang up dimwit.

235
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,200
Bring the file from 
Mr. Yadav's cabin.

236
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,540
Some people aren't destined 
to hear good things.

237
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,830
Come in.

238
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,790
Keep that file on the table 
and crank up the speed of the fan.

239
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,750
And go give the yellow file 
to Mr. Sharma.

240
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,830
Don't forget to order some tea 
on the way.

241
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,250
And where's this fragrance coming from.

242
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,330
From here.

243
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,500
Tapasya Singh.

244
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
Will you shake hands 
or should I order tea for you?

245
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,870
Abhinav Tyagi.

246
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,040
- Sorry, I thought... 
- I was your peon.

247
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,660
- May I sit? 
- Yes...

248
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,040
- Yes, please. 
- Thank you.

249
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,540
Mr. Sharma sent me to you.

250
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,870
Actually, I have a leather 
and garment boutique in Delhi

251
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,250
and the cost of manufacturing there 
is too high.

252
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,040
So I was looking for an option. 
And Aditi, my friend... AD.

253
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,580
She knows Mr. Sharma. 
Actually, her dad knows him.

254
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,700
And he suggested it will be relatively 
inexpensive for me to rent a plot here in Kanpur.

255
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,620
- May I? 
- Yes...

256
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,450
Thanks.

257
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,870
I came here to give him the highlights, 
but he's watching the live show.

258
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,200
Hello. 
Hi, AD.

259
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,660
Yeah-yeah, it's all good. 
He's very sweet.

260
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,370
- Oh nice. 
- He's actually put me on someone else,

261
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,370
so I am good.

262
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,250
- I will call you in a bit. 
- Okay, bye bye bye.

263
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,200
Aditi.

264
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,250
- So from tomorrow?... 
- From Tomorrow?

265
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,160
- Plots...tomorrow... 
- Plots...tomorrow...ok.

266
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,250
Okay. 
Thank you, nice meeting you.

267
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,410
- Thank you. 
- Bye.

268
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,330
So nice to see you!

269
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,410
You disconnected the intercom 
and connected a direct line here.

270
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,120
You're back to talk crap again.

271
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,910
She converses in English like a dream.

272
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,540
You're always showing 
your English off to me.

273
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,950
But in front of her you become 
"how I wonder what you are"

274
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,160
Should I tell you something?

275
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,330
When girls speak fluent English...

276
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,700
...they seem like Katrina Kaif! 
Don't they?

277
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,370
The approach to the problem 
is with the equation.

278
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,870
Force equals Mass into Acceleration.

279
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,790
Got it?

280
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:11,540
The unit of Force being Newton 
kg meter per second squared.

281
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,200
Newton kg meter per second squared

282
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,200
Come on... note down 
this equation everyone.

283
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,160
Hey listen...

284
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,660
What's your name?

285
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Yadav...

286
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,580
Rakes Yadav.

287
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,290
What were you looking at?

288
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,040
Was looking at you..

289
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,620
Why?

290
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,830
You look like a film star to me.

291
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,370
Really? Which one?

292
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,750
Kareena Kapoor. 
She's my favourite.

293
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,950
I'll slap you and get 
your head in the right place

294
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
Open your ears 
and listen to me very carefully.

295
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,950
This is Physics

296
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,620
If you fail, Kareena Kapoor 
won't come and help you pass..

297
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,080
Do you understand?

298
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,120
Now get lost.

299
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,870
And listen...

300
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,910
Next time a girl asks your name...

301
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,250
..don't say Rakes... 
it's pronounced "Rakesh"

302
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,000
- what's up hubby dear? 
- What are you doing?

303
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,000
Giving Kareena Kapoor competition.

304
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,290
I've got sweets packed from "Thaggu's"

305
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,410
Come home early please

306
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,750
That's interesting!

307
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,290
You're bribing me with Kanpur's best!

308
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,120
You're talking as if I've never 
done anything for you ever.

309
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,370
- Come over. 
- No...

310
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,370
I'll first go to the gym Mr Tyagi...

311
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
You get home, I'll be there soon.

312
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,700
What's with you and this gyming habit.

313
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,620
Yeah right! smoking is a 
rather better habbit, isn't it?

314
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,540
Gyming never did anyone any good, right?

315
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,620
Yeah...

316
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,660
I don't need the gym, Tripathi.

317
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,790
I am a born star.

318
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,200
You don't seem to believe it though

319
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,450
Bye for now.

320
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,450
Hey! Abhinav... my boy..

321
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,040
Hey!...How are you?

322
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,750
All good?

323
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,160
Hey! how lovely!

324
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,870
So you're here?

325
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,160
No. I'm still on my way.

326
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,700
There's too much traffic.

327
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,290
Then get off your car and hail an auto.

328
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,500
You will reach faster.

329
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,450
Bless you. Bless you.

330
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,000
This is why I'm a fan of your's...

331
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
All of Guddi's family aside...

332
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,250
...my "sense-of-humour" 
bond with you..

333
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,750
is exceptional.

334
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,370
Just like a friends.

335
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,580
I swear I married Vedika only 
to be your friend, Uncle.

336
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,000
Spectacular....mind blowing!

337
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,370
What a sense of humour. 
Let's go.. lets go..

338
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,750
Now, this is what you call destiny.

339
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,620
If I hadn't come to Kanpur to distribute 
Kanupriya's wedding cards...

340
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,910
...I would've never been lucky enough 
to eat Thaggu's sweets.

341
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,870
why are you getting your daughter 
married only to eat sweets?

342
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,830
I'll send you a box every 
week... even otherwise.

343
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,950
Hear that, Guddi?

344
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,290
Your husband's sense of humour?

345
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,540
You're a lucky girl.

346
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,830
- Have some more sweets, Uncle. 
- I will... I will..

347
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,000
So...

348
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,910
- Where is the groom from? 
- He's from Delhi.

349
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,620
He owns a garment business.

350
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,370
- Where did you say? 
- From Delhi.

351
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,290
Should I call you a cab uncle?

352
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,620
It's a two hour drive back... 
you should leave now.

353
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,250
How I wish, Abhinav!

354
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,330
You see these?

355
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,750
All these cards are for Kanpur.

356
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,330
It will take a day or two more.

357
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,830
But don't worry...

358
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,830
As soon as the work is done... I'll be 
gone Saying goodbye's over the phone.

359
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,120
After all it is a digital age.

360
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,700
Isn't that why people usually 
courier invitation cards, Uncle?

361
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,580
Sense of humour.

362
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,370
Isn't it.. Guddi?

363
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,790
Keep it up, my boy...keep it up!

364
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,200
Kanupriya has an Arts Masters' and 
I slogged to get a Masters' in Physics...

365
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,040
But it's her who deserves 
a Delhi lifestyle. Isn't it?

366
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,830
People in big cities don't 
have time for love, Tripathi.

367
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,200
They don't ogle at their own wife like lovers, 
even after three years of marriage.

368
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,750
Are you ogling at me?

369
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,370
I am only ogling because 
you're sitting far away.

370
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,160
And what if I came closer?

371
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,950
Then...

372
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,000
Guddi....do you think 
you have a digestive pill?

373
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,410
I think I'm suffering 
some indigestion.. dear....

374
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah right away..

375
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,160
Good for nothing old man!

376
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,370
Of course you'll suffer indigestion 
after swallowing a box of sweets?

377
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,160
Here you go.

378
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,540
Thank you so much, madam.

379
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,540
Hold it right there 
Mr. "thank you so much"

380
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,830
- Where are you coming from? 
- Landmark Hotel.

381
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,500
100 rupees to bring her 
here from the Landmark Hotel?

382
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,200
What does your rickshaw run on? 
Aloe Vera?

383
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,370
I was about to break for lunch. 
I told madam earlier...

384
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,500
Then you should've eaten your lunch

385
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,830
- Why did you do her a favour? 
- It's okay, let it be.

386
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,540
- It's fine. 
- What fine? How is it fine?

387
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,910
He is robbing you in my city, 
in front of my eyes...

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,950
Who is robbing?

389
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,830
Are you returning 50 rupees 
or would you like a tight slap?

390
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,040
Hold it right there....watch your tongue 
madam has paid me willingly.

391
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
So what are you acting 
like Shahrukh Khan for?

392
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,910
- Shahrukh khan is it? Shahrukh Khan? 
- Let it be.

393
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,200
- I'll show you Shahrukh Khan... 
- Please go. Please...

394
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,200
- Get away.. 
- Please go. Listen.

395
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,500
I'll complain against your registration 
at the Transporatation Office.

396
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,410
- I don't care. 
- I will...I will

397
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,370
It's okay, let it be.

398
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,200
Anubhav.. 
Anubhav.

399
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,040
It's not Anubhav...it's Abhinav...

400
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,660
Abhinav Arvind Kumar Tyagi, 
M.E.(Civil)I.I.T Kanpur.

401
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,290
Project Head, P.W.D.

402
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,290
I am so sorry, Abhinav. 
I am really sorry.

403
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,200
And I don't like creating 
a scene on the road either.

404
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,870
Mr. Sharma gave me your responsibility, 
which is why I even cared.

405
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,950
It really is your choice otherwise.

406
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,580
Pay somebody a 100 if not a 1000... 
I don't care..

407
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,330
I am...really sorry, Abhinav. 
I am sorry.

408
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,540
It's okay, Nevermind.

409
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,450
Let's go.. I'll show you the plot.

410
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,250
(Indistinct murmur)

411
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,910
I am sorry.. I forgot your name.

412
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,500
Never mind...

413
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,330
It's not like my name 
is Jamshedji Tata...

414
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,200
...that one will remember 
it forever upon hearing it once...

415
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,700
Then what are you still angry about?

416
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,660
I am furious at that rickshaw driver.

417
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,160
He took away a 100 rupees for dropping 
you from Landmark Hotel to P.W.D.

418
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,160
And he was calling me Shahrukh Khan!

419
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,500
In that case I will get the 
same rickshaw driver again tomorrow.

420
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,290
Then you can slap him....

421
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,250
Sorry.. what was it?

422
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,660
Tight slap right?

423
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,000
This plot is too big.

424
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,250
My job will be done in half this area.

425
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,040
Doesn't matter.

426
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,290
I'll show you all the 
plots in a week's time.

427
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,410
You can choose the one you want.

428
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,620
- Thank you. 
- Come...

429
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,160
- May I ask you something, Ms. Tapasya? 
- Yes Ofcourse...

430
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,410
Do you handle your 
entire business alone?

431
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Yes. Why? 
Do I not look qualified enough?

432
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,750
No, I didn't mean that.

433
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,500
Are you from Kanpur?

434
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh yes! One hundred percent Kanpur.

435
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,370
You don't seem like it..

436
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,580
Huh? Why?

437
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,120
Wait! Don't get offended.

438
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,040
I mean...you're not like 
the others I've met in Kanpur.

439
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,290
You're different from the usual.

440
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,750
What's up Chintu ji? 
Why so confused early in the morning?

441
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,250
Tell me something, Tripathi.

442
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,540
Why don't you wear western dresses ever?

443
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Western dresses?

444
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,040
What for?

445
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Why give flight to Rakes Yadav's...

446
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,830
...imagination for the sake 
of your satisfaction?

447
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,250
Who is Rakes Yadav?

448
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,870
It's Rakes.....not Rakesh!

449
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,200
He's a fan of mine...even 
without western dresses.

450
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Are you going to wear any 
shirt or just stare at them?

451
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,700
Ok tell me something... 
Which amongst these is different?

452
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,540
What do you mean by different?

453
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,250
Wear that one.

454
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,250
This one is different?

455
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,410
No Chintu ji, it's just ironed.

456
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,330
I'll go layout breakfast for Uncle

457
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,540
Which one is unique.

458
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,580
I can iron a damn shirt, Tripathi.

459
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,120
But this one's different from usual..

460
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,200
How does it look?

461
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,410
Very good, Sir.

462
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,700
- It's okay really. 
- Okay?

463
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,950
Oh you mean this?

464
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,120
There are many left to show you.

465
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,250
Here, keep this.

466
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,500
What is this?

467
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,200
Up until you select a plot, 
set up a manufacturing unit

468
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,370
It'll take you a couple of months

469
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,080
Why waste money on hotel 
bills unnecessarily?

470
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,830
I know this real-estate 
agent personally.

471
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,790
Select a really nice flat on rent, 
to stay in.

472
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,950
That's so sweet.

473
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,120
Last night I was thinking, 
I should drop the whole Kanpur idea.

474
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,540
Huh? Why?

475
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,500
Just like that...

476
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,120
I don't know the people nor the city..

477
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,830
One needs a reason after all.

478
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,250
I am a reason!

479
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,750
I mean...you're my responsibility.

480
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,700
And the city? It barely takes 
an hour to fall in love with Kanpur.

481
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,200
Really? How?

482
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,870
- Shambhu. 
- Yes.

483
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,580
- Start the car. 
- Yes, Sir.

484
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,080
Son-in-law!

485
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,540
Gossain Sir wouldn't stop beating me...

486
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,660
...while the compass stayed 
still embedded in his back side.

487
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,700
Each time I said....."Sir, at least pull the 
compass out first" he would beat me harder.

488
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,080
So nobody knew who kept 
that compass on his seat?.

489
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,160
It was Fahim Rizvi, who else?

490
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,870
That guy who swallowed 
his betel leaf on seeing you...

491
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,870
Oh yes...

492
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,410
Your laughter.

493
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,870
It's weird, I know.

494
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,750
No, it's cute.

495
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,250
It just hides itself 
behind your moustache.

496
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,330
Thank you.

497
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,040
So you didn't complain about Fahim?

498
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,750
Never Ms. Tapasya. Well, 
I have always been the decent type.

499
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,540
...and he is a friend.

500
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,120
I'd do anything for friendship.

501
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,450
- So how long will it take me? 
- For?

502
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,500
To be your friend.

503
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,830
But you are my friend.

504
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,910
That's a lie.

505
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,830
You don't call Fahim, 
Mr. Fahim... do you?

506
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,160
Shall we leave... Tapasya?

507
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,750
Much better.

508
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,160
So she laughed on the 
Gossain episode. So what?

509
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,870
That's what..she couldn't stop laughing.

510
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,410
There was a three inch 
hole in Gossain's back side.

511
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,080
All of Kanpur laughed at him.

512
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,620
What's so special if she did too?

513
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,450
Why are you yelling?

514
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,950
You are just chasing a promotion.

515
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,700
By the way, the two of you left in the 
car but only you returned. Why is that?

516
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,450
- I dropped her at her hotel and came back. 
- 'Dropped her at her hotel and came back.'

517
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,620
You never dropped me 
to a grocery store till date.

518
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,790
Why are you getting so worked up?

519
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,830
I am annoyed because you are faffing all day 
long and my work at office has increased.

520
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,950
And that Sharma...puts a straw in my neck 
and sucks the blood out of me sip by sip.

521
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,540
The Cantonment area has 
changed dramatically...hasn't it?

522
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,000
Must have changed for you...

523
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,540
You went there after 10 years...

524
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,330
You know...

525
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,700
The last time I went 
there was with Neha.

526
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,330
Neha, again?

527
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,750
That witch doesn't stop haunting you.

528
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,870
Yeah say..

529
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,080
Will you be coming home Mr Tyagi?

530
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
..or should I send a pillow 
and blanket to the bridge?

531
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,200
You rest your head on Fahim's 
lap and sleep there itself.

532
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,580
How will I get sleep here Tripathi?

533
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,000
I won't be able to hear 
your Uncle snoring here.

534
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,870
So how long will it take me?

535
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,040
To be your friend.

536
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,200
You called, Sir?

537
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,910
Oh yes, come in Tyagi.

538
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,000
That girl...Singh

539
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,540
Tapasya, Sir.

540
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,370
Did you finish with her?

541
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
- What, Sir? 
- Finish her work? What else?

542
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,580
No, Sir.

543
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,540
It'll take a while.

544
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,250
It isn't troubling you...is it?

545
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,410
- I can hand it over to Rizvi if you like... 
- No, Sir. I'll do it.

546
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,370
Huh...

547
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,200
I mean I'll manage. I'll do it..

548
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,370
So sweet, Tyagi.

549
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,410
You're a very sincere man.

550
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,330
I am learning from you, Sir.

551
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,750
Good boy.

552
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,410
- Good morning. 
- Hi.

553
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,450
Right on time.

554
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,660
How about some coffee, Tapasya?

555
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,290
No, I am good. 
Thanks.

556
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,620
See? I didn't call you Ms. Tapasya

557
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,870
Superb.

558
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,370
By the way, you never 
mentioned that you're married.

559
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,830
- What? 
- Sharma sir said...

560
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,450
Oh shit... 
Are you all right?

561
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,200
I'm hurt. 
I'm very very hurt.

562
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,580
But it's Okay.

563
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,330
So when will you introduce 
me to your wife?

564
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,750
If it's hurting too much, 
then just ice it.

565
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,910
Yeah...

566
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,750
Actually, I think when I finish 
setting up my home...then

567
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,500
Then what?

568
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,040
Then you can visit me with the wife.

569
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,370
What?

570
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,410
Get me some ice.

571
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,750
Sir, shall I get soda too?

572
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,370
Why would you get soda?

573
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,620
Only ice.

574
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,330
Is that hurting a lot?

575
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,080
No... Not at all.

576
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,160
Listen, call me when you've 
had a look at the documents.

577
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,950
And don't forget to 
ice where it's hurting.

578
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,870
Huh?

579
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,290
Ms. Tapasya...

580
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,250
Tapasya...

581
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,580
We were supposed to 
go see some plots tomorrow?

582
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,660
No, not tomorrow Abhinav.

583
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,000
Not tomorrow? 
Then how about the day after?

584
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,750
I'll call you...

585
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,540
And ice where it's hurting, okay.

586
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,500
Bye.

587
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,200
Sir, where would you like this ice?

588
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,120
Look, Chintu ji is here.

589
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,160
Welcome back, son-in-law. 
Have some piping hot fritters?

590
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,080
Would you like some tea?

591
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,870
I'll get some more hot ones for you.

592
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,370
All good with you?

593
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,160
I'll go wash up.

594
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,700
Just come here.

595
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,410
Do tigers ever need to wash up?

596
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,500
Here you go...

597
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,080
Guddi just made them piping hot.

598
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,120
Have some.

599
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,160
I saw you yesterday 
at about lunch time..

600
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,750
In High-Tech city...

601
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,200
With some lady.

602
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,620
I was about to call out to you 
when your car zipped away pass me.

603
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,120
Must be some official work, right?

604
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,040
You figured out it was official work?

605
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,200
Great.

606
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,790
I had started to assume...

607
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,790
that stuffing your face with sweets and fritters 
was the only thing you considered as work.

608
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,200
Sense of humour, Uncle.

609
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,330
You're the only one 
who gets mine... right?

610
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,040
Here... stuff some more. I'll be back.

611
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,660
We're leaving tomorrow, uncle.

612
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,870
Allow me... the lotion?

613
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,910
What's up?

614
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,870
Why does his highness want 
to serve the commoner today?

615
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,700
Because nobody gives a 
damn about his highness anyway

616
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,330
Will you come with me to the Cantonment 
area tomorrow, Tripathi?

617
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,290
It's a half working 
day at office tomorrow.

618
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,410
What an exciting plan!

619
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,580
It's a half working day 
for you, not for my classes..

620
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,580
You're talking as if.. 
if you take a day off...

621
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,830
... it will keep a few kids from 
becoming the president of the country.

622
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,700
You come frustrated from the 
office and then vent it out on me.

623
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,080
Believe me..

624
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,370
The two of us are meant to be in the clubs and 
restaurants of Delhi, not in Kanpur's cantonment area.

625
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,000
Why are you burning your 
youth under the sun?

626
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,870
Why do you care?

627
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,580
Why do I care?

628
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,910
I am a friend of yours, I am concerned.

629
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,620
What if you get a sunstroke?

630
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,500
Who am I?

631
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,410
Chintu Tyagi.

632
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,950
Yes, but who am I?

633
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,000
Abhinav Kumar Tyagi.

634
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,160
I am a middle-class Indian Man.

635
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,830
The Indian middle-class male.

636
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,200
So whether I get a sunstroke or 
loose motions, no one gives a damn.

637
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,870
I'm the unfortunate bull that toils all day 
ceaselessly and yet sometimes goes to sleep,

638
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,700
With no respite.

639
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,290
I care for my mother a little and 
I'm a mamma's boy in the eyes of my wife

640
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,790
I show some affection to my wife,

641
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,910
And my mother terms me henpecked.

642
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,370
If I move to the big city, 
I'm the murderer of tradition.

643
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,290
And yet if I stay back in a small town, 
then I'm the road block to modernism.

644
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,330
If I pay my taxes honestly, 
then I am broke.

645
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,700
And if I don't pay them, I am a thief.

646
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,290
If my wife works, 
I am an opportunist.

647
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,870
If she doesn't work and sits at home, 
then I am a sexist.

648
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,950
If I ask my wife for sex, 
then I am a beggar.

649
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,870
If I turn down sex with my wife, 
then I am a persecutor.

650
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,660
And if I find my way into 
somehow having sex with her

651
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,120
...then I am a bad cultured person too.

652
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,620
Are you high early in the morning?

653
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,450
No, not me...you are high!

654
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,040
Every man's happiness lies 
in his own hands, Rizvi.

655
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
Isn't that before one gets married.

656
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,370
Shut up.

657
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,700
My father, my mother, wife, and you...even you are 
involved in taking away my happiness from me...

658
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,330
But not anymore... 
Not anymore.

659
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,870
Me?

660
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,750
Abhinav?

661
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,290
The receptionist told 
me you have come here..

662
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,160
Is it some important work?

663
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,410
See...

664
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,750
The other day in jest you asked 
for my friendship.

665
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,410
So I gave it to you.

666
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,200
Uncle, pass the ball too.

667
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,000
Yes, son.

668
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,620
The only option left... 
now is for you to trust me

669
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,580
And me to trust you as a friend

670
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,330
What do you mean?

671
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,370
The other day you said I have never 
mentioned about my wife.

672
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,540
It was intentional.

673
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,410
And I just came here to say that 
you shouldn't mention about her either.

674
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,500
Why?

675
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,870
Because my wife...

676
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,950
My wife's having...

677
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,250
Having what?

678
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,790
Uncle, pass the ball.

679
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Take it yourself. 
Ass***

680
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,410
The thing that destroys many lives.

681
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,450
Bad omen?

682
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,750
I wish it was a bad omen?

683
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,410
My wife is...

684
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,700
Having an affair.

685
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,080
Affair?

686
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
Affair...

687
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,620
What?

688
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,830
Affair...

689
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,080
Love affair, passionate escapades, 
romantic relationship.

690
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,040
This is why I always try not 
to mention my wife to no one.

691
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,160
This is my grief, 
and I'll endure it alone.

692
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,160
But...your wife...

693
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,950
If you never mention about 
Vedika ever again...

694
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,250
...you'll be doing me and my little 
left reputation a big favour.

695
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,830
The rest is your decision....

696
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,330
Goodbye.

697
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,410
Keep walking Chintu Tyagi.

698
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,200
Don't look back for anything...

699
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,000
Abhinav

700
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:37,660
Lookout...

701
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,410
How long has this been going on for?

702
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,910
Since the time I fell in the pool.

703
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,500
Not this. 
I meant your wife's affair.

704
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,910
Well...

705
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,540
we got married 3-years-ago 
So around 2.5 years ago.

706
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,540
That's ridiculous.

707
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,660
Love isn't ridiculous, Tapasya.

708
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,830
Love is love...

709
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,540
But clearly, she loves someone else.

710
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,200
So why doesn't she just leave you?

711
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,410
Because her boyfriend is jobless.

712
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,540
The poor thing is helpless.

713
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,000
What's the name?

714
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,370
Vedika.

715
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,910
I meant her boyfriend.

716
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,830
His?..

717
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,580
Yadav... Rakesh Yadav.

718
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,950
So what are you still 
doing in this marriage?

719
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,950
Waiting for better days to arrive.

720
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,250
Trying to keep my share of honesty

721
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,540
Wow...

722
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,250
I cannot believe this.

723
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,000
Looking at you... 
no one can imagine your back story

724
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,950
Well...a person's truth 
is never visible on his face.

725
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,700
Basically...

726
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,870
I am a very unhappy man.

727
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,950
Here you go. 
Buy yourself some rasmalai.

728
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,700
Thank you.

729
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,330
"You are a little crazy. 
I am also a little crazy."

730
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,790
"There is little sorrow 
in happiness too "

731
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,250
"It's not necessary that 
everybody should be the same."

732
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,950
"Live carefree wherever you are"

733
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,750
"The paths that we have taken."

734
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
"I Wonder where we will meet again."

735
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,540
"Your destination 
and my destination."

736
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,200
"Are now interlinked."

737
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,790
I will wear this 
for Kanupriya's reception.

738
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,040
Are you listening?

739
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,290
Are you planning to call the fire 
brigade at your own sister's wedding?

740
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,250
You will sin...

741
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,450
- Listen... 
- Yes.

742
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,120
Some Tapan Singh Boss 
Relative is calling.

743
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,910
- Should I answer it? 
- Wait, wait, wait...

744
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:22,950
Yeah...

745
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,580
Hi, what were you doing?

746
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,580
I was taking a shower.

747
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,700
So 11:30, office?

748
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,000
- 11:30... 
- Yes.

749
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,580
- I'll be there. 
- Okay.

750
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,950
It's my Boss's relative.

751
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,000
He's chewed my brains...

752
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,160
"We met just now."

753
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,330
"The series have started."

754
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,040
"You tell me. What is the reason?"

755
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,040
"That both the hearts have united."

756
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,000
"We are flying."

757
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,040
"We are flying."

758
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,580
Should I pack it?

759
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,040
Yeah, pack it.

760
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,450
"We are flying."

761
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,450
And brother.. 
pack that yellow dress as well.

762
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,910
- I'll pack it... 
- Separately.

763
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,910
"We are flying."

764
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,040
"We are flying."

765
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,000
"We are flying."

766
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,700
Isn't it like the one Akshay Kumar's 
Heroine wears.

767
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,080
But where will 
I wear this and go, Chintu?

768
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,700
in Chintu's arms

769
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,120
- You'll get tired. 
- Thank you.

770
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,870
Abhinav.

771
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,450
I checked Vedika's FB account yesterday.

772
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,830
She looks happy in the pictures.

773
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,910
Of course, she's looking happy, 
thanks to Rakesh Yadav.

774
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,160
I meant in her pictures with you. 
On your honeymoon.

775
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,410
Who doesn't look happy on 
Their own honeymoon, Tapasya?

776
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,790
It's biological.

777
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,250
"We are flying."

778
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,580
How does this sound?

779
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,790
Brother, you came back again?

780
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,790
And sister-in-law.

781
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,120
Sorry...

782
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,200
I think I am mixing you 
up with someone else.

783
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,330
He seems crazy.

784
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,750
"We are flying."

785
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,200
Listen...

786
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,290
"We are flying."

787
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,830
Have you seen my husband here before?

788
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,950
Aren't you the one who was 
in toilet?

789
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,290
- What? 
- Can I get a selfie?

790
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,330
- Are you high? 
- Madam, please.

791
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,540
Mental!

792
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,580
- "We are flying." 
- Sir, please get it done in two days.

793
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,120
Hey! You're back again? 
Have you made a daily pass to PWD?

794
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,620
No sir.

795
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,120
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

796
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,700
Ms. Tapasya.

797
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
How wonderful.

798
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,620
Your business partner 
hasn't arrived yet.

799
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,120
- How come? 
- Yes, even I am waiting for him.

800
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,540
The best place to wait 
in Kanpur is my cabin.

801
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,500
I've been waiting there 
for five years myself...

802
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,830
For a promotion.

803
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
Please come.... 
We can have a conversation.

804
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,870
- Okay, sure. 
- Ladies, first.

805
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,830
Hey! Hey! Hey!... 
What do you think you're doing?

806
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,250
Drop me to the classes.

807
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,250
- I'll be late for office, Tripathi. 
- No, you won't.

808
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,000
It hardly takes 20 minutes to reach 
from one end of Kanpur to other.

809
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,370
- This isn't Lucknow or Delhi. 
- Let's go.

810
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,000
Not Delhi again.

811
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,910
Do you always come prepared 
with lucknow-delhi taunts?

812
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,790
Your name should've been Khushi, 
Prasannta, or Happy.

813
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,540
Have you noticed the smile on 
my friend's face since he met you?

814
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,870
He's all praises about you.

815
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,080
But.. he deserves all the praise.

816
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,950
Really?

817
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,540
I mean the situation 
he's going through...

818
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,250
...I wonder how he finds 
the courage to smile.

819
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,660
Yeah...the situation he's going 
through is really difficult.

820
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,330
Do you know about the situation 
he's going through?

821
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,500
- Yeah. 
- Wonderful.

822
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:25,160
I mean it's wonderful to know that 
you also know what he's going through.

823
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,700
So far I was the only one 
burdened by this information

824
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,870
By the way...

825
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,830
do you know everything 
he's going through?

826
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,700
Yeah...or maybe 
I don't know.

827
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean...how much do you know?

828
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,370
How much?

829
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,620
Look out...

830
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,540
Isn't that great?

831
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,750
And look, Ms. Tapasya.

832
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,200
Your wait is over.

833
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,450
Here comes the victim of circumstances. 
Mr. Shravan kumar

834
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,450
Hi...

835
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,370
Hi, bro.

836
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,330
As****

837
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,910
How dare you say my mother figure 
type sister-in-law is having an affair.

838
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,200
Bloody despacito...

839
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,580
- What else could I do? 
- What would you do?

840
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,790
You're married. You're a liar...

841
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:16,000
and now you want 
to fake innocence as well.

842
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,790
I like spending time with her.

843
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,580
But as soon as she found out that 
I am married she began to hesitate.

844
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,040
What did you expect me to say? 
That I am married...I am happy..

845
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,290
Please spend time with me... 
I like spending time with you.

846
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,200
She would have clobbered 
me with her shoe.

847
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,790
Being a husband seems 
to be a sin in this country.

848
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,540
- I couldn't think straight at that point... 
- Oh, you couldn't think straight then...

849
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,870
Well...now you'll think in a way 
where ice or ointment won't help.

850
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,700
This is Agnipath, brother. And 
no one has ever been able to escape it.

851
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Tell me something..?!

852
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,700
What if Tapasya gets serious? Then?

853
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,830
Don't forget I am Abhinav Tyagi...

854
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,790
Chintu..

855
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,910
- the guy Neha dumped without giving a reason.. 
- Not Neha again...

856
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,200
You're trying to base all 
your life's experiences on...

857
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,040
...that one witch who dumped you.

858
00:52:58,830 --> 00:52:59,790
Think about it...

859
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,790
- If Tapasya falls in love with you... 
- Rizvi, she's out of my league.

860
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,950
She friendly with me because 
my wife has a boyfriend.

861
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,700
She sympathizes with me.

862
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,870
How can she fall in love with me?

863
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,540
So what else do you want from her?

864
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,080
Love of a mother?

865
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,790
I want my share of happiness.

866
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,910
Someone's finally laughing at my jokes.

867
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,120
Went around in my own city.

868
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:37,250
And my laughter, which you have 
been calling weird since childhood

869
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,830
She finds it cute.

870
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,080
And I like it.

871
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,830
Are you sure there's nothing else?

872
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,660
- Swear on you? 
- kill me only..!!

873
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,120
By the way..... Who is Rakesh Yadav?

874
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,950
No one...

875
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,290
Imaginative character.

876
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,040
How are you, sir?

877
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,790
Vedika, come sit.

878
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,700
- What brings you here? 
- It's my cousin's wedding.

879
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,290
- I see... 
- so here's the leave application.

880
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,200
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you, sir.

881
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,750
Dear Vedika Madam...

882
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Just like the moon shines 
bright in the dark night...

883
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,790
What kind of an application is this?

884
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,950
No, sir. This is not the application.

885
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,450
This is.

886
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,450
Dear Vedika Madam...

887
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,910
Just like the moon shines 
bright in the dark night...

888
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,580
In my classes, you're best 
teacher on demand.

889
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,790
Yours truly, Rakesh Yadav.

890
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:42,370
Hey...

891
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,040
- What is this? 
- Poem madam..

892
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,200
No. This is evidence.

893
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,080
If I hand this over 
to the Director...

894
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,040
...you'll get rusticated 
from college and classes.

895
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,540
I guess you feel offended madam...

896
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,750
Fine, I'll apologize.

897
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:12,330
Madam. Please just do me a favor.

898
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
What favour?

899
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,250
I know you will never 
give me your number...

900
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,080
...so I never bet on it.

901
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,700
Because I am a Yadav 
and I never make a losing bet.

902
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,250
So?

903
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:28,620
Well...

904
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:32,080
I made a bet that 
I will give you my number.

905
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,790
Please, madam. 
Help me win the bet.

906
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,790
I will come in handy, madam.

907
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,080
Here's my card.

908
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,580
And even if you want to throw it...

909
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,700
...then please do it 
after you cross the junction,

910
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,080
so I win the bet.

911
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,700
Listen, Tripathi, 
I'll be back from Fahim's place.

912
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,790
- At this hour? 
- Yeah...

913
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,040
He got locked out of his house, 
and the key's inside.

914
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,410
He gave me a spare key.

915
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,200
Have you seen it?

916
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,830
That's what he said.

917
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,870
Found it.

918
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,660
Listen...

919
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,540
Come back soon.

920
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,330
Sister-in-law, how are you?

921
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,290
You...

922
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,870
I've been giving missed calls 
to Chintu, but he isn't coming out.

923
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,870
What are you doing here?

924
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,290
What am I doing here?

925
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,750
I shouldn't have been here?

926
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,200
You called him over to your place 
and came here yourself.

927
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,370
You're too much, brother Fahim.

928
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,370
How could you leave 
it inside the house?

929
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,040
- Who? 
- The house keys, who else?

930
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,330
He's taken a spare key with him. 
Now scram and send him home quickly.

931
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,500
He did the right thing. 
Very good.

932
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,120
I'll go get him.

933
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,620
Get married, brother Fahim.

934
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,620
Me too?

935
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,000
No, sister-in-law. 
Chintu must be waiting.

936
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,080
There, that way.

937
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,450
- Abhinav. 
- Where are you?

938
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,870
I am occupied right now, 
call you later.

939
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,750
To hell with your occupation...

940
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,500
You can't imagine 
how scared I am.

941
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,330
As*** you could've landed in big 
trouble today and me with a black eye.

942
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,660
- There, there, there. 
- What happened?

943
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,500
When you use my name as an excuse, 
you should tell me at least... you foolish person!

944
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,000
I just went to your house 
and met sister-in-law.

945
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,950
What?

946
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Curses...

947
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,660
Why are you making 
such obnoxious sounds?

948
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,500
- I fell down. 
- Yes...you definitely have fallen too low.

949
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,370
I saved you this time.

950
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,700
But next time I will not let 
you off so easily.

951
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,000
I am warning you.

952
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,950
Give me a frost stick.

953
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,580
Are you okay, Abhinav? 
Should I get the pain-spray?

954
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,540
There is no spray for this pain.

955
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,830
I should leave now.

956
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,040
I am sorry you got hurt because of me.

957
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,580
Don't be silly.

958
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,870
I got to meet you... 
drove the lizard away...

959
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,330
...I bet no one's having a better 
time than me in Kanpur.

960
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
- Ms. Tapasya, how are you? 
- Hi.

961
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,450
I heard our knight in shining 
armour slay a lizard last night.

962
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,330
Yeah...and he even got hurt.

963
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,700
Yes he did get hurt...

964
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,200
What's inside this? Pain spray? 
You seem to be in a hurry?

965
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,580
- It'll get cold. 
- Who?

966
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,910
Butter chicken, Fahim.

967
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,790
And if you want to join then 
come to Abhinav's cabin.

968
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,450
No, you feed the brave warrior 
and I'll settle for betel leaf.

969
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,290
As you wish.

970
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,580
Happy lunch to you both.

971
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,580
Bye.

972
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,660
Change for 100.

973
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,160
Hurry up.

974
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,290
Oh god!

975
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,120
Chintu Tyagi.... you are dead.

976
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,790
Sister-in-law, 
what brings you here?

977
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:19,700
Why?

978
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,660
- Am I banned from the PWD office? 
- No, your enemies should be banned.

979
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,450
I was only asking about 
this surprise visit.

980
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,620
Mr. Tyagi and I are going 
to have lunch together.

981
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,250
- I've bought Chole Bhature for him. 
- Means double lunch.

982
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,290
- Why double lunch? 
- The delicious lunch and your love.

983
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,200
So double...

984
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:36,790
But Abhninav's not in his office... 
or maybe he is.

985
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,830
His car's still parked here. 
So Maybe.. he's in his cabin....

986
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,870
What are you blabbering, brother Fahim?

987
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,040
Take my advice and get married.

988
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,950
I don't want to die by getting married

989
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,580
Yeah say...

990
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,200
Did you polish off 
the butter chicken from Delhi?

991
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,000
Time for some lucknow chole-bhature

992
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,450
Have you become a caterer?

993
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,330
Your beloved wife's coming up.

994
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
What?

995
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,830
Eat now

996
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,450
Who was it?

997
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,750
Fahim's got a stomach ache.

998
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,410
You know what, 
get the lease agreement cleared.

999
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,080
But I can get that 
done tomorrow Abhinav.

1000
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,450
Never wait to do a good deed. Or 
you might not a get a chance tomorrow.

1001
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,790
- Get up. Get up. 
- Okay...but what's the hurry?

1002
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,580
Come on. 
Why wouldn't I be in a hurry?

1003
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,120
- I am a very professional man. 
- Wait a second.

1004
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,620
Sir, I wanted to talk 
to you about the lease.

1005
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,370
Not today, dear. 
I have a meeting with the DM.

1006
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,830
- Let's do it tomorrow. 
- Okay,

1007
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:31,410
Sir is...

1008
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,660
Sharma sir is...

1009
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,290
Abhinav?

1010
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,000
You seem busy, Mr. Yadav.

1011
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,870
- Hello, sister-in-law. 
- Hello.

1012
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,910
Have you completely lost it?

1013
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,910
Hanging by a thread.

1014
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,500
Did you get your share 
of happiness now?

1015
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:07,330
Help, Lord. Help, Lord. 
Help, Lord. Help, Lord.

1016
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,830
Help, Lord. Help, Lord. Help, Lord.

1017
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:29,000
Help, Lord. Help, Lord. Help, Lord.

1018
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,950
She doesn't listen.

1019
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,580
- Have you seen Abhinav? 
- Yes, he's up...

1020
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,080
What?

1021
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,160
Not up, not up... 
He went that way...towards left...

1022
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,870
Are you listening, Mr. Tyagi...

1023
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,790
He just disappeared 
without saying a word.

1024
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,790
And he's not answering my calls.

1025
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,200
- I'll try calling him again... 
- No need at all...

1026
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,750
Why will you call him again? 
He won't answer your calls.

1027
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:06,330
What?

1028
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,910
Let's do this. If I meet him...

1029
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,410
...I'll tell you to call me.

1030
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,080
I mean if I run into him 
I'll tell him to call you.

1031
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:16,950
Sure?

1032
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,750
Of course. 
Swear on god..

1033
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,410
Sister-in-law... Sister-in-law...

1034
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:27,250
Quiet.

1035
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,540
Sister-in-law...

1036
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,910
Sister-in-law

1037
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,750
Oh, God.

1038
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,450
You?

1039
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,700
Why are you sneaking in through 
the window, Mr. Tyagi?

1040
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,160
Why are you coming from 
those doors...Tripathi?

1041
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:45,660
What do you mean where am I coming from?

1042
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,250
I had some time off, and thought 
I'll have lunch with you.

1043
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,580
So I brought Chole-Bhature...

1044
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Chole-Bhature...

1045
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,950
So.....Wow...

1046
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,250
Come on, let's eat right away 
or the bhature will get cold.

1047
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,450
What are you standing 
over there and thinking?

1048
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,200
Come, come.

1049
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,750
I am famished.

1050
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,620
Bhature is Fine, but what were you 
doing outside the window?

1051
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,540
Window...

1052
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,910
Yeah...

1053
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,790
Pigeons...

1054
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,750
These bloody pigeons 
made a nest out there...

1055
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,290
...and turned the ledge 
into a romantic spot.

1056
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,000
But I took care of that 
once and for all.

1057
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,200
I got rid of their nest.

1058
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,120
I was trying to call you 
but your phone was unreachable.

1059
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,950
- Where is it? 
- My phone.

1060
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,750
Must be somewhere here.

1061
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,580
We have intercoms so 
that gets the job done.

1062
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,200
Radheshyam, bring two plates.

1063
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,370
Sir, should I get snacks too.

1064
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,870
Why would I need snacks?

1065
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,700
Can't you see my wife's 
brought lunch for me.

1066
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,540
And hurry up.

1067
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,660
Hurry up, Tripathi, you can't 
imagine how famished I am.

1068
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,250
Opening Mr Tyagi....

1069
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,040
Chintu... in case you 
have too much money these days,

1070
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,790
Put your property on my name

1071
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,370
He left his mobile at the shop 
downstairs, sister-in-law.

1072
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,950
I didn't leave it there, 
I must have forgotten.

1073
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,450
You're so careless, Mr. Tyagi.

1074
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,700
Chole-Bhature...

1075
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,910
Feed him, sister-in-law.

1076
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,540
The guy's been slogging all 
day without eating a morsel.

1077
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:07,000
You know, work is 
worship (Tapasya) for him.

1078
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,250
Yes.. come... come..... 
Keep praising me.

1079
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,750
You know what...why don't you climb up 
on this table... get rid of the plates

1080
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,500
...and feed us too.

1081
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,910
Can't you see husband-wife are trying 
to spend some quality time together?

1082
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,500
Go on. Go on.

1083
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Eat.

1084
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:29,580
Chintu...

1085
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,750
You had climbed out the window 
to fix the broadband wire.

1086
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,500
Is it done?

1087
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,160
What?

1088
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,000
Do you need any help?

1089
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,870
Broadband wire?

1090
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,750
Broadband...

1091
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,000
- Sister-in-law... Sister-in-law... 
- Yeah...

1092
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,580
The nest was right here...

1093
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,660
...and this is the broadband wire

1094
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,000
which we were trying to fix.

1095
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,620
Enough with the acrobatics, 
brother Fahim, you'll fall.

1096
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,040
He'll fall down.

1097
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,750
No, he's used to this.

1098
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,620
Yes...its a habit...habit..

1099
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,410
It's done.

1100
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:09,290
Good.

1101
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,250
- So where are you taking me for lunch. 
- The restaurant's just ahead.

1102
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,950
Yeah...say

1103
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,500
Uncle's left some cash 
for the suit piece.

1104
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,200
There's a Raymond Shop 
in Z Square Mall...

1105
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,580
...come and choose what you like.

1106
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,910
There is no need to choose. 
You can buy whatever you like.

1107
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,620
You know that our choices 
are so alike, buddy.

1108
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:33,910
"Buddy?"

1109
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,910
- Fine "buddy", I'll choose one for you. 
- Who is it?

1110
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,410
Fahim.

1111
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,000
But if you get the time 
then come here.

1112
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,410
I will be in Z Square.

1113
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,950
I want to speak with Fahim as well. 
I have something to say to him...

1114
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,450
Fahim.

1115
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,330
Tapasya wants to say...

1116
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,120
Hello. 
Fahim

1117
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,500
The call dropped...

1118
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,370
Call him after lunch.

1119
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,080
- Where's your restaurant? 
- Just here...

1120
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,120
Take the next right, Shambhu.

1121
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,660
- Right... 
- Yes, right... Mummy...

1122
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,160
- Mummy.... 
- Whose mummy?

1123
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,080
I just remembered a place 
that serves home-made food.

1124
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,250
That's where I'm taking you.

1125
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,950
- Take us there, Shambhu. 
- What is this, Abhinav.

1126
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:14,330
- Shambhu, stop the car. 
- Why?

1127
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,330
Because this place has got a food court 
and bowling alley.

1128
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,450
So we'll grab some lunch first 
and then go bowling.

1129
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:20,750
Superb.

1130
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,950
See Shambhu, she's turned 
into a true Kanpuriya.

1131
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,950
All thanks to you, sir.

1132
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,040
Get down.

1133
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:33,500
Come on.

1134
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,410
It's Z Square.

1135
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,700
- So? 
- So?

1136
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,830
Fahim's mom ordered 
salad here last week.

1137
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,910
She must have gone by now. 
Let's go.

1138
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,500
No...she found a 
grasshopper in her food.

1139
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,450
That must have flown too. 
We will eat something else...

1140
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,080
You don't get it, Tapasya.

1141
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,750
This mall doesn't offer good food, 
or bowling.

1142
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,700
The pitch is damaged...

1143
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,370
I'll take you to a better mall 
where you can get bowling and batting...

1144
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,750
Oh god Abhinav....

1145
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,450
Sit inside. 
Move.

1146
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,700
Shambhu, let's go. 
Don't just stand there.

1147
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,700
Listen, mister...

1148
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,870
Wasn't there a Raymond's showroom here?

1149
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,370
There was...but it closed down long ago.

1150
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,200
Why don't you try Mega Mall...

1151
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,410
Thank you.

1152
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,870
Now this is what you call a Mall...

1153
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,000
The name is Mega... 
and expensive by status..

1154
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,540
Come on.

1155
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,790
Mister...show me some suit pieces.

1156
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:43,830
Yes, madam.

1157
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,700
Children are naÃ¯ve.

1158
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,080
Innocent and nice.

1159
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:47,790
Yeah, Fahim.

1160
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:48,830
And these kids...

1161
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,000
say, father.

1162
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,750
Sorry Tripathi.

1163
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:56,330
Listen...I am completely confused 
between blue and grey.

1164
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,950
They both don't seem right.

1165
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,750
Buy any one you like, Tripathi.

1166
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,120
In fact, buy the blue one. 
I wore grey at our wedding.

1167
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,000
Have a ball.

1168
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,660
And take lots of gifts.

1169
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,330
And also goodies with it.

1170
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,790
- Where are you, Mr. Tyagi? 
- Me?..Office...

1171
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:17,500
outside office, but in a 
restaurant having lunch with Rizvi.

1172
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,580
I'll call you later, bye.

1173
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,660
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

1174
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:25,160
We're having a fun class 
In Mega Mall.

1175
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,750
This was your problem, wasn't it?

1176
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:31,330
- Sister-in-law. How are you? 
- All good, brother Fahim.

1177
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,120
I'm trying Mr. Tyagi's number 
but he isn't picking up.

1178
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,120
He isn't picking up....Of course... 
how will he..

1179
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,910
Mr. Sharma just dragged 
him to a meeting.

1180
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:43,700
One can't get anything done 
around here without your husband.

1181
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,580
I think if he continues 
working like this...

1182
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,410
...then someday the government 
will name PWD after his name.

1183
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,540
Yeah...

1184
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,580
If you keep supporting him like this, 
then some day he will.

1185
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,450
I'll tell him to call 
you once he's back.

1186
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,290
Our most honest employee here..

1187
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,700
Abhinav Tyagi.

1188
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,200
Its okay, its okay.

1189
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,750
I'll be right back.

1190
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
- Take a look at the quality of the cloth. 
- What now?

1191
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,290
- Hello... 
- Just choose which colour...

1192
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,330
Sorry for disturbing you.

1193
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,580
But he doesn't have blue 
or grey which I like.

1194
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,660
- What are you saying, madam? 
- Just buy black, Tripathi.

1195
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:32,410
I look good in any colour, you know. 
Take it...

1196
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,830
Madam...I'll give you a discount.

1197
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,450
Come.

1198
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,750
Your turn.

1199
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,160
"you should bathe in cold water..."

1200
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:53,700
"...weather you know how 
to sing or not... one should sing."

1201
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,910
So Tripathi, 
what are you packing for?

1202
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,620
Oh no...

1203
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,040
were we supposed to leave 
for Lucknow today?

1204
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,910
Tripathi...today is the 10th.

1205
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,910
We were supposed 
to leave on the 13th.

1206
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,080
Yes, but I am leaving today.

1207
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,700
This is also right...

1208
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,120
She is your cousin sister after all.

1209
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:27,120
Everyone will be happy 
to see you there a day or two early.

1210
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:30,830
The boss has been keeping me 
so busy lately, that I can't...

1211
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,790
Is the project important?

1212
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,700
Yes... very.

1213
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,290
The Tapan Singh one?

1214
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,540
Huh... Yes, Tapan Singh. That only..

1215
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,830
Never mind... Work first.

1216
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:51,160
Come over if you finish on time, 
otherwise no problem.

1217
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,540
My leave was approved, 
so I am leaving early.

1218
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,660
I'll try my best...

1219
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:04,950
And anyway... I'm getting 
Delhi exposure on this project..

1220
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,500
I am doing all this for you, Tripathi.

1221
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,750
- See you. 
- I'll drop you.

1222
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,750
I've made my arrangements.

1223
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,910
I couldn't have waited 
for you to leave me.

1224
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:35,250
Hello...

1225
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,500
Yeah, hello.

1226
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,450
Remember you said something 
about taking me to Delhi.

1227
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,750
What? Are you serious?

1228
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,870
When am I not serious with you?

1229
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,750
Okay, done.

1230
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,200
Done.

1231
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,910
"You are a little crazy. 
I am also a little crazy."

1232
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,290
"There is little 
sorrow in happiness too"

1233
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,790
"It's not necessary that 
everybody should be the same."

1234
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,620
"Live carefree wherever you are"

1235
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,580
"The paths that we have taken."

1236
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,750
"I Wonder where we will meet again."

1237
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,910
"Your destination and my destination."

1238
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,660
"Are now interlinked."

1239
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,080
- ''Now we are flying.'' 
- This is my home.

1240
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,790
It's nice.

1241
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,370
And that's my work.

1242
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,950
That's nice too.

1243
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,330
So...I'll check-into some hotel nearby.

1244
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:45,750
Why?

1245
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,910
- Do you have a problem here? 
- Not at all...

1246
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,660
I mean your society might 
Have a problem with it...

1247
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,790
This is my home, 
and I don't have a problem.

1248
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:05,750
But if you're uncomfortable, 
then you can check into a hotel room.

1249
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,750
Me...

1250
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,080
I am comfortable.

1251
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,870
I...am very comfortable.

1252
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,790
Go...get me some tea.

1253
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Guddi.

1254
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,950
Guddi.

1255
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,500
Guddi.

1256
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:31,910
Mr. Mishra.

1257
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,620
What are you doing on the terrace?

1258
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,700
Come down and apply mehandi 
on Kanupriya...come

1259
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,370
I am getting married 
in your backyard sister

1260
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,160
Pray that my marriage 
is also like yours.

1261
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,660
Cheers.

1262
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,750
You're amazing.

1263
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,540
You grow on people like 
an addiction before they know it.

1264
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,000
You too.

1265
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,410
So what will you have?

1266
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,500
Are they your friends?

1267
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,120
- your friends? 
- He's my ex...

1268
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,660
Rishabh.

1269
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:33,080
We were together for four years.

1270
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,450
One day he suddenly proposed 
for marriage...

1271
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,950
...and I said yes.

1272
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,950
Maybe out of the fear of losing him.

1273
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,330
Dad was extremely happy.

1274
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,160
He really liked him.

1275
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:53,250
But everything started 
happening too soon.

1276
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,620
I pretended to be happy 
watching Rishabh happy everyday...

1277
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:01,040
...but maybe I could never prepare 
myself for marriage.

1278
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,700
But by then it was too late.

1279
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:07,580
Dad's anger, Rishabh...

1280
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,790
It seemed like he stopped 
understanding me anymore...

1281
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:17,950
Should someone get married just 
because it's a good proposal...

1282
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,540
...or for the wedding preparations, or to save 
yourself from humiliation from relatives.

1283
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,540
No...maybe...

1284
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:30,750
And yet...90% men in the country 
give the same excuse for marriage.

1285
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,290
Bunty finished college, 
get him married.

1286
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,500
Sweety turned 18, 
Let's get her married.

1287
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,790
It's winter... 
Lets get someone married...

1288
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Let's go somewhere..

1289
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,500
Where?

1290
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,540
To meet Tapasya Singh.

1291
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,790
Hi Adi.

1292
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:17,290
This is Aditi, who sent me to Kanpur.

1293
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:18,540
I know.

1294
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,410
Yeah, Adi.

1295
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,950
"My eyes look deeply drugged. 
I have a fair complexion."

1296
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:28,500
"along with that, I have a 
beautiful face. The eyes are watchful."

1297
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,370
"girl, you are so coy. 
Why do you feel shy?"

1298
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:37,620
"You have killer eyes. 
It's killing me."

1299
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:41,750
"You are so intoxicating. 
" You are like a drug.....

1300
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,750
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

1301
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:50,290
"there is a scene between you and me"

1302
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,660
"on the Moonlit nights."

1303
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,450
"With the hero."

1304
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:19,160
"I will gaze at the sky for stars."

1305
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,330
"with disco lights."

1306
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,660
"I am excited."

1307
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:31,750
"We will keep dancing till we sweat."

1308
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,910
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

1309
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,790
"There is a scene between you and me"

1310
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,790
- Say.. 
- Hail all to brother Doga!

1311
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,750
"Your beauty is exceptional."

1312
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:03,080
"It drives me crazy."

1313
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:07,290
"Today your lover will die 
in your trance."

1314
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:11,700
"tell me honestly, 
Why won't I feel afraid?"

1315
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:15,790
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

1316
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:20,370
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

1317
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,370
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

1318
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,000
"there is a scene between you and me"

1319
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,830
Stop it. You've had enough.

1320
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,790
Enough is when the alcohol starts 
spilling out of the glass.

1321
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,540
The thing is....

1322
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:12,410
Don't use my punch lines on me.

1323
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,910
Stop behaving like Minakumari 
and tell me what's wrong.

1324
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:35,410
I am stuck in the biggest 
crisis of my married life.

1325
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:40,250
My husband has become characterless.

1326
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:46,950
Curse

1327
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:51,200
I was with you from matrix 
to graduation without commitment

1328
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,620
And he couldn't even tolerate 
three years of marriage.

1329
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,790
You lectured me on future.

1330
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,790
Is your future sorted?

1331
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,160
Maybe the fault is in me.

1332
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,290
I can't see one.

1333
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:24,500
I love you for everything you do...

1334
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,040
...and more on the things you don't.

1335
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,500
Abhinav...

1336
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,000
how can anyone love someone else?

1337
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,040
You're back, Tripathi!

1338
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,330
How was it?

1339
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,750
What's this?

1340
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,200
You left with only one suitcase, 
and returned with three.

1341
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,580
I just left the city for a few days...

1342
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,370
...and you changed your world.

1343
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,200
The trimmer slipped from my hand..

1344
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,750
It happens sometimes..

1345
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,200
So...

1346
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:43,870
how's the project coming along?

1347
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,450
It's going well.

1348
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,160
What was the name?

1349
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,080
Tapan Singh.

1350
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,410
Tapan Singh or Tapasya Singh?

1351
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,790
Why Mr Chintu? What for?

1352
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:11,290
You could've just said it once 
that we are done, Tripathi.

1353
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,700
I would have left myself.

1354
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:18,000
Why did you have to 
make such a mess of it?

1355
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,830
Who told you?

1356
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,160
- I will explain... 
- I wouldn't have believed God on this.

1357
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,080
Because I trusted you.

1358
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,000
Do you know what trust means?

1359
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:34,660
Trust is the name of a bird behind which 
the love bird also flies away

1360
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,500
I saw you holding her 
hand and throw the ball down the alley.

1361
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:44,870
I heard you lie.

1362
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,700
The bird flew away

1363
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:51,750
Tripathi... you're getting me wrong

1364
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,330
There's just one thing 
left to understand.

1365
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,580
What was lacking?

1366
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,120
What was my fault?

1367
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,080
You didn't do anything wrong.

1368
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,200
Nor have I done anything wrong.

1369
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,500
I couldn't think straight...

1370
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,830
And didn't know how to tell 
You that I was bored with life.

1371
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:14,410
I...

1372
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,620
You were bored?

1373
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,790
And what if I was bored?

1374
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,790
I stay awake when you get fever.

1375
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,080
I wash your dirty underwear 
and you got bored!

1376
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,580
Is there thrill in your life now?

1377
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,870
You can continue living 
with this thrill...forever.

1378
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,620
Alone.

1379
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:39,580
I am not taking anything 
that belongs to you.

1380
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,410
If I find something that came by mistake

1381
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:43,950
then...I'll send it back 
with the divorce papers.

1382
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:50,700
Tripathi. Please...

1383
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:06,410
Sister-in-law, 
are you coming from somewhere?

1384
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,000
Are you leaving?

1385
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,870
The broadband connection 
was loose, brother Fahim?

1386
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,830
So I severed it once and for all.

1387
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:18,370
Thank you.

1388
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,000
Curse...

1389
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:21,450
Let's go..

1390
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,790
Stop posing Uttam kumar

1391
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,580
If that cab leaves today....

1392
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:30,580
...then you'll be the next victim 
of India's growing divorce rate.

1393
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,910
I don't understand, Fahim! 
What should I do?

1394
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,160
What you should do?

1395
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:38,580
Go run... beg and plead in 
front of my sister-in-law...

1396
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,750
All I can do now is plead.

1397
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:45,620
to Vedika, 
her father, my father.

1398
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,540
I have become a serious sinner.

1399
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,450
I am good for nothing now.

1400
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,580
Maybe I was never good for anything.

1401
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,200
If I was...then from Neha to Vedika...

1402
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:59,500
I've seen many as*** but you're 
a cut above the rest Chintu Tyagi.

1403
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,000
Your wife's leaving you...

1404
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,620
...and you can't remove serpent 
Neha's poison from your viens

1405
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:05,500
I am going to suck it out today, 
once and for all.

1406
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:08,120
You weren't the only one 
in her trap, everyone was

1407
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,410
Hear it today as to why she left you

1408
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:13,000
Because she did it with me... 
that's why!

1409
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,080
Happy?

1410
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:17,870
And after giving it to me... how could the 
helpless girl pretend to love his best friend

1411
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,290
You bloody conniving...

1412
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,580
- Curses... You call yourself my best friend... 
- Chintu.

1413
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,540
... you ruined my life

1414
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,410
No, no.

1415
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,410
All my life I lived under 
the complex that I am a loser.

1416
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,700
Neha left me without a reason.

1417
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:36,120
But you bloody double-crosser...

1418
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,040
- I knew you wouldn't... 
- Shameless.

1419
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,200
have the courage to hear the truth.

1420
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:41,290
Because you've been testing 
my courage for the last 22 years.

1421
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,370
She was giving it to you..... 
and you were taking it....

1422
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,160
Someone is ringing the bell.

1423
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,580
Timeout... 
I think sister-in-law is back.

1424
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,750
- Hi, Fahim. 
- Is Abhinav here?

1425
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,580
Yeah. He's been waiting for you.

1426
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,620
Go ahead, I am leaving.

1427
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,580
Tapasya.

1428
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,540
What are you doing here?

1429
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:04,080
What else do you expect me to do 
if you don't answer my calls all day?

1430
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,410
Someone will see you.

1431
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,040
This is my house?

1432
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,580
Why did you come here?

1433
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,910
I came to meet Vedika.

1434
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,580
- Vedika. 
- Why?

1435
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:13,950
- Vedika. 
- But why?

1436
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,250
To free you from this guilt.

1437
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,790
What do you mean?

1438
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,790
Look at your face.

1439
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:23,910
Everything that is 
happening between us, and...

1440
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,370
...what almost happened in Delhi.

1441
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,620
It's the result of 
your unnecessary guilt.

1442
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:29,660
Huh?

1443
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:34,330
Does Vedika think about 
you when she's with her boyfriend?

1444
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,790
No. 
Because she is happy with him.

1445
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:41,700
You also have the right to be happy.

1446
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,830
But you won't agree to it 
until Vedika doesn't say it.

1447
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,370
You should believe me. I am a woman. 
she won't have a problem in saying this.

1448
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,160
Okay. 
Vedika.

1449
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,160
- Vedika. 
- Tapasya.

1450
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,660
- Tapasya. 
- Vedika.

1451
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,370
This is all my fault.

1452
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,950
This is my doing.

1453
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:02,620
Vedika doesn't have a boyfriend.

1454
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:06,580
I lied to you.

1455
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,290
You're lying to me now.

1456
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,580
What are you scared of?

1457
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,910
You think she will feel bad?

1458
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,370
No, she won't. 
Trust me, okay.

1459
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,290
Vedika.

1460
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:24,910
- Vedika...Vedika.. 
- I am not lying.

1461
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,750
She doesn't have a boyfriend, Vedika.

1462
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,040
I mean Tapasya.

1463
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,410
For God's sake, Abhinav.

1464
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,580
If she doesn't feel embarrassed, 
then why are you?

1465
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,370
What are you saying?

1466
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:35,870
Okay, take a look at this.

1467
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,200
He writes half page long 
poetry on Vedika's page.

1468
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:42,290
Rakesh Yadav is a student of her class.

1469
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,500
Rakesh Yadav is for real.

1470
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
Dare you laugh, Fahim Rizvi.

1471
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:59,700
I'll tie a stone to your stomach... 
drown you in river ganga and hang myself.

1472
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,000
Middle-class man.

1473
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,080
happiness in your own hands.

1474
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,910
Along with Bahubali one, 
they want to enjoy Bahubali two as well.

1475
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,120
You have turned your 
life into Bombay Velvet.

1476
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,540
Hey! Hey! hey!

1477
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,580
Where are you going?

1478
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,370
I am your childhood friend.

1479
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,200
Can't I even laugh at your predicament?

1480
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,870
Go ahead and laugh then.

1481
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,660
In fact, don't keep it to yourself.

1482
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:27,660
Let the entire city 
know about this incident through radio.

1483
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,950
Shut up.

1484
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,290
Stop being Salman Khan 
from the movie tere naam.

1485
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,040
And leave for Lucknow tomorrow morning.

1486
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,410
I'll convince 
sister-in-law to come back.

1487
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:41,250
You don't have to worry as long as 
This Hanuman is with lord Ram

1488
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,200
Are you sure?

1489
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,120
I won't get into a mess?

1490
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,330
Listen...

1491
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,330
Guddi's father...

1492
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,830
My sweetheart...

1493
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:53,580
Listen to me...

1494
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:56,870
I am floored on you, my sweetheart.

1495
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,370
Got rid of your moustache?

1496
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:21,040
I am very sorry for 
everything that happened.

1497
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,040
We are sorry, son.

1498
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,500
Why are they sorry?

1499
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:31,450
I had my doubts when 
she came alone for Kanupriya's wedding.

1500
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,500
But who knew the situation will 
grow out of proportion

1501
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:40,200
It's not grown out of proportion, 
son.... it's completely out of control.

1502
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,870
All I can do is apologize...

1503
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,200
- No son, we apologize. 
- Right, papa.

1504
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:49,500
Is she taunting us?

1505
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,000
Don't know.

1506
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,750
You tell us what to do.

1507
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,950
Greetings Mom and Dad.

1508
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:04,750
Please find the heart to forgive me.

1509
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:09,910
I am finally going to do what 
I should have done three years ago.

1510
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:13,500
It took me time to 
realize that my happiness..

1511
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:18,950
...doesn't lie with Chintu....that 
middle-class, horrible guy you chose for me.

1512
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:21,330
But with Doga who I chose.

1513
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:25,330
I am leaving forever. 
Your daughter, Vedika.

1514
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,950
Sister-in-law eloped with Doga?

1515
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,000
Isn't Doga the guy who parked his bike in 
the middle of the road three years back?.

1516
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,950
Not park, son... he blocked the road.

1517
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,370
You didn't come for Kanupriya's wedding.

1518
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,040
- So? 
- He did.

1519
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:39,660
But I swear I never felt 
anything at that point.

1520
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:42,410
Do you have any idea 
about his feelings now?

1521
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,080
Where can I find this Doga? 
What does he do?

1522
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:49,330
Uncle was saying that he runs 
a small Tour and travels business...

1523
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,660
I mean a small shop in Gomti Nagar.

1524
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:53,410
- Let's go, Tyagi. 
- That's all I know, son.

1525
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,160
She ran off with a bloody shopkeeper.

1526
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:56,250
This is too much.

1527
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:58,410
I went pray 
but came back observing a fast.

1528
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,290
I had heard this before...

1529
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:01,200
Here, a package for 
Haj is also in the deal.

1530
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,580
I've heard about sister's 
and daughter's eloping.

1531
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,870
But you're the first man 
whose wife has eloped with someone.

1532
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,160
And I didn't expect 
this from sister-in-law.

1533
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,910
What did you say, you leach?

1534
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:14,910
Lord Ram doesn't have to worry 
as long as he has Hanuman with him.

1535
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,120
Now I am in a mess.

1536
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,500
Don't blame it on me.

1537
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,120
Didn't you hear what uncle said?

1538
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,450
You didn't attend Kanupriya 's wedding.

1539
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:25,620
And should I remind 
you why you never went?

1540
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,750
Give me the phone..... 
you focus on driving the car.

1541
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,790
Son Abhinav....

1542
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:35,910
Greetings, uncle.

1543
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,660
God bless you. God bless you.

1544
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:39,750
You didn't attend Kanupriya's wedding.

1545
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,080
Yes, I didn't attend 
Kanupriya's wedding.

1546
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:41,830
What will you do?

1547
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,790
Ask for the address.

1548
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:43,750
Yes...I'm asking

1549
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:46,080
Do you have the address for 
Durgesh Tours and Travel Company?

1550
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:49,000
Doga's address. Yes, I do? 
Where are you planning to go?

1551
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,160
Hell! 
Just send me the address.

1552
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,370
Sense of humour.

1553
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,450
What work do you have?

1554
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:06,330
It's personal.

1555
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:07,700
How personal?

1556
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,700
You doga has eloped with his wife!

1557
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,830
Have you lost your mind?

1558
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,950
His wife must have eloped with him.

1559
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,370
Doga never elopes with anyone's wife.

1560
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,000
Never...

1561
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,370
Your Doga is the incarnation 
of the great Lord Krishna himself.

1562
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:27,330
I am just asking for his number so that 
my wife doesn't take advantage of him.

1563
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,910
Why don't you call your wife?

1564
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,790
Is Doga the Prime Minister?

1565
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,330
Yes say, Kaali.

1566
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,290
Some guy called Abhinav 
has come to office.

1567
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:42,620
- Abhinav. 
- Yes.

1568
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:45,200
He claims that his wife is with you.

1569
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,450
Yes, she is. So?

1570
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,830
So... nothing...

1571
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,700
He's getting impatient 
to talk to his wife.

1572
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,540
What do I pay you 
15,000 every month for?

1573
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,450
Crush his impatience.

1574
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:01,120
As you wish brother Doga?

1575
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,750
- Please leave. 
- Come on.

1576
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:05,950
Come out. 
Out. Get out.

1577
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,790
Leave me.

1578
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,910
Is this how Lucknow treats people?

1579
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,540
What is this?

1580
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,290
What is this? 
Chotu-Motu.

1581
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:15,370
Let me show you the 
how we treat our guests?

1582
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:16,290
Beat them.

1583
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:17,700
You'll break a button.

1584
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,580
- Will you get out of here or not? 
- What have we done?

1585
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,370
You'll break a button.

1586
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:32,750
I heard you came to Lucknow 
looking for some kind of hospitality.

1587
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,000
Sir, try to understand our situation.

1588
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,830
What's your name, son?

1589
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:38,580
Fahim Abdul Rizvi.

1590
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:42,330
It will take one second for an encounter... 
you can explain your situation later.

1591
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,120
Fine. Make me understand....

1592
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,620
Make me understand....

1593
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,370
My wife ran away.

1594
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,200
Ran away? On her own.

1595
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,330
Yes.

1596
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,250
How did you do it?

1597
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,910
Make my wife also run away...

1598
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,580
What are you saying?

1599
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,370
She is my wife.

1600
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:08,120
I love her.

1601
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:11,620
Your wife?

1602
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,290
Are you sure?

1603
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:16,370
- I mean what now? 
- What now?

1604
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Why don't you arrest that Doga?

1605
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,250
His men attacked us first.

1606
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,200
- Did she run away willingly? 
- Yes.

1607
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,750
Then it's pretty clear.

1608
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,620
Adultery is not a crime anymore.

1609
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,700
Haven't you read the 
High Court's Instructions.

1610
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:34,160
Look son, I am letting you off with a 
warning because you don't belong to this city

1611
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:38,750
But if I catch you making a commotion Again 
anywhere in Lucknow city, you'll do time for good.

1612
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,160
Now leave. 
leave

1613
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:43,000
Rizvi, you be extra careful.

1614
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,370
Guddi.

1615
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,040
With Doga.

1616
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:01,870
Father called me on a short notice.

1617
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:03,910
Come in.

1618
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,500
Sit.

1619
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:18,000
Son...

1620
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,450
who is Rakesh Yadav?

1621
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,200
Rakesh Yadav?

1622
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,620
Who told you?

1623
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:26,910
Thank you.

1624
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,750
What is she doing here?

1625
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,200
This nice girl told us everything.

1626
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:34,950
I admit I've always 
been very strict with you...

1627
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:39,450
...but that doesn't mean you won't 
tell me about such a big situation.

1628
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:40,200
Father..

1629
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,950
I kept saying over and over again...

1630
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,120
Plan a family. Plan a family.

1631
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:47,080
- If only you two had children... 
- Please, mom...

1632
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,000
Please help yourself.

1633
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,870
- Tapasya, what are you doing? 
- Serving biscuits.

1634
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,330
Why are you getting furious on me?

1635
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,000
I am just telling the truth.

1636
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,790
I thought she will stay faithful 
to you all your life.

1637
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,160
But who knew she would elope someday.

1638
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,370
I heard the boy is just 19-years-old.

1639
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:08,040
- 19 years old?!.. 
- Yes, 19 years old!....

1640
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:11,660
Wait a minute, father. 
You're getting it all wrong.

1641
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,120
We're absolutely right, Chintu.

1642
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,660
Her phone's switched off since morning.

1643
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:15,830
Why?

1644
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:18,040
Because she finally has her freedom.

1645
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:20,000
I have been trying to tell 
him that since yesterday.

1646
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:22,620
But he keeps defending her, father.

1647
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:25,450
Please Tapasya, 
at least don't call him father.

1648
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,660
Let her call us whatever she likes you 
tell us where is out daughter-in-law?

1649
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,580
- She is in Lucknow. 
- Lucknow?

1650
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,620
Give me a couple of days 
and I'll set things straight.

1651
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:38,250
And come with me, Tapasya.

1652
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,580
Salutations... Goodbye.

1653
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,410
- Nice meeting you... 
- Enough goodbyes.

1654
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,750
- Be careful son. 
- Let's go.

1655
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,660
What...What were you doing?

1656
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:52,120
Trying to bring some 
happiness in your life.

1657
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,950
Abhinav, I am really sorry if you 
feel that I've crossed the line, but...

1658
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,950
...you were never going 
to tell your parents.

1659
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:02,620
There is nothing to tell, Tapasya.

1660
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,790
The only lie was what I told you.

1661
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,700
I was out of my mind.

1662
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,950
If you really consider me a friend...

1663
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:14,120
...then come with me and tell Vedika's 
family that there's nothing between us.

1664
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:17,580
But why should I lie?

1665
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,910
Abhinav, It's been almost a month 
since something started between us..

1666
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,500
started? What started between us?

1667
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,120
Listen.. Abhinav, I really like you.

1668
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:29,540
So just clear your head 
and then come talk to me okay.

1669
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,620
I am waiting. 
Goodnight.

1670
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,790
Why is she wearing that suit?

1671
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,950
Pandey, who the hell is Doga?

1672
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,830
Must be Rakesh Yadav's pet name.

1673
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,450
Who is Rakesh Yadav?

1674
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,080
And by the way brother... 
Doga is his real name.

1675
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,330
Unfortunately...

1676
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:57,450
He's been like an eclipse in 
Guddi's life for the last nine years.

1677
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,660
Nine years?

1678
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,410
You mean he's been in love 
with Vedika since he was 10 years old.

1679
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:04,250
I thought has a part 
of the coaching classes.

1680
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:05,750
- Coaching class? 
- Yes...

1681
01:40:05,950 --> 01:40:07,700
But why would Doga 
go to a coaching class?

1682
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,120
He single-handedly can conduct 
a class with the whole of Lucknow city.

1683
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,790
But Tapasya said that he 
studies in her coaching class.

1684
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,660
Who is Tapasya?

1685
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:17,580
She is unacquaintance to Abhinav's boss

1686
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,410
The poor girl is helping him out.

1687
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:23,330
Is she the girl I saw with Abhinav, 
in the innova.

1688
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:25,450
Haven't you created 
enough trouble for us already?

1689
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,620
You see our children 
with different people in cars.

1690
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,660
Why don't you tell us at that time?

1691
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:29,870
Unbelievable...

1692
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:32,450
At least Doga knows 
Vedika before the wedding.

1693
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:35,790
But their Abhinav has been roaming around 
with some Tapasya after the wedding.

1694
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,790
Listen sister... 
Please mind your language.

1695
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,790
Its not our son who ran away...

1696
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:44,410
...it's your daughter who eloped 
with Rakesh Yadav.

1697
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:46,200
Who the hell is Rakesh Yadav?

1698
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,540
I'm saying... 
I saw Doga with Guddi in a jeep.

1699
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:50,330
See...

1700
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:54,370
They can't even decide 
who their daughter has eloped with?

1701
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:57,620
And they are pointing fingers at Chintu.

1702
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,120
Mister...please control your wife. 
Or else...

1703
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,870
Just because I am quiet doesn't mean 
she has the liberty to say anything.

1704
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:06,080
- Calm down brother.....calm down. 
- What calm down?

1705
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,080
I am finding 
a solution to this problem.

1706
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:09,950
You're the reason for this situation

1707
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,040
You fixed this relationship 
even though you knew.

1708
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,250
you see the problem today,.. 
after 3 long years.

1709
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,330
But their daughter has also 
eloped three years later only...

1710
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:21,250
Your Chintu has also shown his 
true colours after three years only.

1711
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:23,450
To hell with Doga, and Tapasya.

1712
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,540
Who the hell is Rakesh Yadav?

1713
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,450
Leave him, please.

1714
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:30,330
First take him there.

1715
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:33,080
- And tell him you better understand. 
- Hey...

1716
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,250
- Rakesh Yadav. 
- Yes...

1717
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:41,750
Aren't you the guy 
who drops madam here sometimes?

1718
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,660
What do you mean he comes to drop her? 
He's her husband.

1719
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,160
I see.

1720
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:49,660
I want you to meet 
my father and a female...

1721
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:56,000
...to tell them that you have 
no connection with Vedika madam.

1722
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,540
Your will doesn't matter here.

1723
01:41:58,830 --> 01:41:59,750
I am Yadav.

1724
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,580
It's my choice what 
I want or don't want to say to someone.

1725
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:08,870
Look...my wife...your madam...

1726
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,200
...ran off with someone else.

1727
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,330
How could she run off 
with someone else in my presence!?

1728
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:16,580
- You bloody... 
- time is not favoring us

1729
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:25,950
Look son, if you know your limits, 
you'll be in profit.

1730
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,410
Otherwise...

1731
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:36,750
You look like a decent guy to me, 
so I am willing to help you.

1732
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:39,700
But I won't go to anyone...

1733
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,580
As far as finding madam...

1734
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:45,290
Keep my card.

1735
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:51,330
Stay in touch, and we'll find madam.

1736
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:03,410
Is it done?

1737
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,540
Yes. They will just call on the 
token number and hand you your passport.

1738
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:09,620
Think again, Vedika.

1739
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:16,700
What if he jumps from one of 
the PWD buildings after he finds out.

1740
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,620
I didn't expect this from you, Doga.

1741
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:23,450
You've known me for nine years.

1742
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,290
Have I ever thought twice 
after making a decision.

1743
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,620
I can vouch for the first six years.

1744
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,910
But for the last three years you've 
been a pretty faithful wife.

1745
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,330
So I thought I should ask.

1746
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:39,290
Faithful wife's are 
out of fashion these days.

1747
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:44,000
Bitches are ruling the world.

1748
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,790
Yes, Tyagi. Come.

1749
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:51,290
Sit.

1750
01:43:58,410 --> 01:43:59,870
I am telling you with experience.

1751
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:01,200
Don't mind.

1752
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,910
Look. There are some bastards..

1753
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:08,000
..who dump their wives and run away.

1754
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:11,160
And some men are decent like you.

1755
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:14,080
- Their wives leave them... 
- Sir.

1756
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,120
Tyagi.

1757
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:19,450
You are a very decent and honest man.

1758
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:23,540
Vedika must have some choice.

1759
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,120
- Her ex-boyfriend.. 
- Sir, who told you?

1760
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:28,580
Who else will tell me?

1761
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,500
The one who is supporting you 
in your joy and sorrow.

1762
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:36,540
can I tell you something?

1763
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,950
Our happiness..

1764
01:44:39,330 --> 01:44:41,910
..lies in our own hands. Got that?

1765
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,080
And if..

1766
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,910
- I will leave, sir. 
- Hey!

1767
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,160
- Listen, Tyagi. 
- Its okay, sir.

1768
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,250
Sir, madam didn't come?

1769
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,160
Thank God.

1770
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:01,540
Finally.

1771
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,910
Come in.

1772
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,830
Who do you think of yourself?

1773
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:14,500
Who gave you the right to comment on my 
wife's character in the entire city?

1774
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:16,910
What do you think?

1775
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:20,450
You can get closer to 
me by proving Vedika wrong.

1776
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,080
You can have a relationship with me?

1777
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,750
Understand this very carefully...

1778
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:30,870
Even if Vedika leaves me forever, 
no one can take her place.

1779
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:33,580
She is my wife.

1780
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,160
How about some coffee?

1781
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:38,500
Did you eat?

1782
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,950
I want an answer, Tapasya.

1783
01:45:45,790 --> 01:45:47,450
What are you so furious about?

1784
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:51,000
I haven't said anything that 
I haven't heard from you

1785
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:55,950
You gave me the right to 
comment on your wife's character.

1786
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,370
You only told me that 
she has a boyfriend.

1787
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,040
I am only doing what you expect from me.

1788
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:08,750
I just don't understand,

1789
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:11,500
that someone who 
met as an unhappy man...

1790
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,040
...why is he choosing to stay unhappy,

1791
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:16,620
when his happiness is 
standing right in front of him?

1792
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:21,410
Coffee?

1793
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:38,040
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1794
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,080
"It was supposed to be about you and me, 
now it's just you"

1795
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:49,330
"Please forgive me. 
I will be grateful to you."

1796
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:51,870
"I beg of you."

1797
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,540
"Don't get angry."

1798
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:59,450
"I will fulfill all your wishes."

1799
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:02,580
"I've lost my moon"

1800
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:08,330
"Now I am left with 
only stars in the sky"

1801
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:17,950
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1802
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:50,660
"You were my life and 
you stole my life away"

1803
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:55,790
"Without you, 
I cannot think straight, babe"

1804
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:58,500
"I've lost my moon"

1805
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:04,080
"Now I am left with 
only stars in the sky"

1806
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:14,700
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1807
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:25,160
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1808
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,450
Sir, if we could avoid going to court..

1809
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,750
Unfortunately, your friend 
has done this in my area.

1810
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,370
We will have to take you to the court. 
I will come personally to take you.

1811
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:00,160
It's husband and wife matter.

1812
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,290
Why are you taking the trouble?

1813
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:06,910
Look, had it been a husband's issue, 
I would have left it on you

1814
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,290
But your friend has become a lover...

1815
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:21,250
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1816
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:23,910
"Without you..."

1817
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:32,080
"Beloved, you don't understand."

1818
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:36,950
"Separation from you.."

1819
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,910
"..is like poison."

1820
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:46,370
"It's killing my soul."

1821
01:49:55,370 --> 01:50:03,950
"My love, losing your 
love has put my life at risk"

1822
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:08,950
Chintu!

1823
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:10,450
Chintu!

1824
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,120
Chintu!

1825
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:13,410
Chintu!

1826
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,290
Poor soul is fast asleep.

1827
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,450
Chintu!

1828
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:20,660
Open the door fast...

1829
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,500
Why don't you keep your phone charged?

1830
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,500
I ran into him in the morning. 
Tell him.

1831
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,830
I found out from my 
sources that my madam...

1832
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,080
...has a flight in three hours.

1833
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:36,290
Lucknow to Delhi, Delhi to Canada.

1834
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:39,950
- Forever. 
- Forever?

1835
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:45,750
Give me your phone.

1836
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,910
- Yes, son. 
- Father, where are you?

1837
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:56,040
We're on our way to 
Bithoor to pray for you.

1838
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,000
Bithoor? 
Give the phone to father-in-law.

1839
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:58,870
Here...

1840
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:00,290
Yes, son.

1841
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:00,830
Yes, hello.

1842
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:02,950
Did Vedika bring 
her passport to Lucknow, father?

1843
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,870
Did Vedika bring 
her passport to Lucknow?

1844
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:07,200
Her passport must be in Kanpur?

1845
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,790
What kind of a mother are you? You don't 
know where your daughter's passport is.

1846
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:11,580
So... What kind of a husband is he? Even he 
doesn't know where his wife's passport is.

1847
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:13,370
One minute...Give me the phone.

1848
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:17,620
Abhinav...son.... We have no idea about 
the passport, but what has happened?

1849
01:51:17,790 --> 01:51:19,450
There is no time to 
explain right now, uncle!

1850
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,830
You guys reach Lucknow airport, 
I'll meet you there.

1851
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,660
Let's go, Rizvi.

1852
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:25,830
What the...

1853
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,450
Shall we go, lover boy?

1854
01:51:36,950 --> 01:51:39,200
We shouldn't be late for court work...

1855
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:42,450
two hours are still 
left to reach Lucknow.

1856
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,290
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

1857
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:02,500
Sorry.

1858
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,660
Catch him. Catch him. Catch him.

1859
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:05,870
Move. Move.

1860
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,540
Why are you guys trying to be Milkha?

1861
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,290
- Start the car. 
- Catch him.

1862
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:13,660
- Chintu here. 
- We will lose him, hurry up.

1863
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:16,500
- Come fast. 
- shift behind, I'll ride.

1864
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,200
- Did you fill petrol? 
- Yes.

1865
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:34,540
Let's go, let's go.

1866
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,750
How far is the Niagara 
Falls from Toronto?

1867
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,790
Around an hour or so?

1868
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,450
You can see it every day.

1869
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:55,040
- There goes Abhinav? 
- Where did he go?

1870
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,330
Son-in-law. Son-in-law.

1871
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,950
Who's the third guy? 
The one who is seated behind.

1872
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:00,910
Who is the third guy?

1873
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,330
- I won't spare you. 
- Why are the police after him?

1874
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:03,950
Police?

1875
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,870
Great. Chintu's being 
chased by the Police.

1876
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:08,700
Overtake from the left.

1877
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:11,000
First he left our daughter, 
and now he's leaving the country.

1878
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,370
What are you saying?

1879
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,080
Hurry up, Hurry up, Pandey, hurry up.

1880
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,950
I can't go any faster.

1881
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:19,790
Get down...catch him.

1882
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:21,000
I'll handle them, you go.

1883
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,620
Let them talk just once.

1884
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:28,620
Tripathi!

1885
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,830
Give me one chance to talk.

1886
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,040
I love you.

1887
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:38,700
Maybe the fault is in me...

1888
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:42,620
Then you tell me... what should I do?

1889
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:45,410
You're the priest, Vedika.

1890
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:48,040
And you want to hear 
the Mahabharata from me?

1891
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:53,750
The person you're facing right now is 
not your husband, but your opponent.

1892
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:58,790
Put your brain to work 
and think of all the cards you have.

1893
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:11,200
Help me win the bet, 
I'll come in handy to you.

1894
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:16,040
Raise your bow... and play 
all your cards together.

1895
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:23,790
I am Vedika.

1896
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,580
Mrs. Tyagi.

1897
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,700
Imagine... 
he made me have an affair...

1898
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:35,500
Mr. Tyagi is unbelievable...

1899
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,250
And never made a move on you either.

1900
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:40,330
Not physically, he didn't.

1901
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:44,950
And what he did to my 
heart doesn't even matter.

1902
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:47,410
Why doesn't it matter, Tapasya?

1903
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:49,000
I don't understand.

1904
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:51,200
See history.

1905
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:55,450
If women want, 
they can bring about a world war.

1906
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,410
I'm going to punish 
him old-school style.

1907
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:05,450
You can think of something innovative.

1908
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:09,500
I've left.

1909
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,750
Superb. I am about to reach

1910
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:14,660
- What are you doing here? 
- I came to meet Vedika

1911
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,870
My happiness lies with 
Doga who was chosen by me.

1912
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,910
Sister-in-law ran away with Doga.

1913
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:22,330
Who is Rakesh Yadav?

1914
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,450
Who told you?

1915
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:25,830
Thank you. What is she doing here?

1916
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,000
Madam has a flight in 3 hours.

1917
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:30,660
Forever.

1918
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:46,330
Everyday your wife is told by all men about 
how beautiful and how desirable she is...

1919
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,080
...but she never crossed 
the line for your honor.

1920
01:56:51,950 --> 01:56:55,910
In the past few days, 
I saw you pine for Vedika's reputation.

1921
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:01,910
So next time someone tells 
you that you're nice and desirable...

1922
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:04,580
... do not cross 
the line for Vedika's sake.

1923
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:06,250
And yes.

1924
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:08,450
I wanted to slap you.

1925
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:13,660
But then I thought 
you never got physical with me

1926
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,500
So why Should I?

1927
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:24,290
I'll send you the bill for my 
shop that you vandalized.

1928
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:25,750
And yes...

1929
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,120
In the game between husband, 
wife and the third person..

1930
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,450
..third person is the name of the gap..

1931
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:35,080
..that husband and wife allow 
to come between them.

1932
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:41,660
Don't lose connection, 
and always be honest to each other.

1933
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,700
Lord will take care of the rest.

1934
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:55,200
It takes two 
minutes to break a marriage... Mr Tyagi...

1935
01:57:56,620 --> 01:58:02,120
Marriage is no longer a compromise 
in which one and the other

1936
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:08,750
And nowadays women have 
more options compared to men.

1937
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:13,200
I was never looking 
for your replacement, Tripathi.

1938
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,080
Maybe I was trying to fill something that 
was missing in our relationship through love.

1939
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:28,410
And because of that.. 
I became your culprit...

1940
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:32,950
...and yours too.

1941
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,950
I have always been honest in my life

1942
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:45,330
Never imagined I'll have 
to pay so dearly for one lie.

1943
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:55,500
If you ever get praised 
for your smile again...

1944
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:59,790
...stop for one moment and think...

1945
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,450
...of the reason... 
this smile's on your face.

1946
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:22,080
I told you that in Uttar Pradesh you 
will find the answer to all your questions.

1947
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:24,500
So this is the journey of 
how first from a male to husband...

1948
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:27,370
...and husband turned 
to lover Chintu Tyagi...

1949
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:28,910
...of his own wife.

1950
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:33,580
But even a lover is a male after all.

1951
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:35,250
Why?

1952
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:52,330
Come in.

1953
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:03,450
Keep the file on the table 
and crank up the fan's speed.

1954
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:05,450
And where's the fragrance coming from?

1955
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,000
From here.

1956
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:10,200
Neha Khanna.

1957
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:14,540
Neha...

1958
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:17,790
The plot allotment department is.....

1959
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,830
I have quit that department.

1960
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:22,950
Fahim Rizvi is in the next cabin.

1961
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,080
- You can go there 
- Oh... okay

1962
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:30,410
Can I take my hand 
or are you planning to come along?

1963
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:32,200
No... 
Thought so.

1964
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:34,450
Weirdo.

1965
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,000
Neha.

1966
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:48,330
"Baby...shoots...

1967
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:50,540
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1968
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,870
"Baby...shoots...

1969
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,950
"Baby...shoots...

1970
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,080
"Baby...shoots...

1971
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,290
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1972
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:01,660
"Baby...shoots...

1973
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:03,700
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1974
02:01:12,410 --> 02:01:16,790
"When you put kohl in your eyes, 
you look like an angel."

1975
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:25,370
"When you wear lenses, 
you look beautiful."

1976
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:34,120
"You've cast a spell, 
my heart's out of control."

1977
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:38,250
"Your attitude is mesmerizing. 
Reload"

1978
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:42,830
"She makes her lover..."

1979
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,750
"She makes her lover skip a heartbeat..."

1980
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:49,540
"...as she shoots from her eyes."

1981
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:53,790
"...as she shoots from her eyes."

1982
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:58,500
"That beautiful girl, 
shoots from her eyes."

1983
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:02,540
"...shoots from his eyes."

1984
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:07,830
"That handsome guy, 
shoots from her eyes."

1985
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:11,250
"Baby...shoots...

1986
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:13,450
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1987
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:15,790
"Baby...shoots...

1988
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,870
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1989
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:30,830
"Even I am secretly 
in love with you."

1990
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:35,250
"Night and day all 
I think about is you."

1991
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:43,910
"Even I was secretly 
in love with you."

1992
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,370
"Night and day all 
I thought about is you."

1993
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:53,120
"She would drive anyone crazy 
with her looks."

1994
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:57,500
"Her long and black..."

1995
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:03,080
"Her long and black..."

1996
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:05,870
"...curly hair, she shoots 
from her eyes."

1997
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,200
"...she shoots from her eyes."

1998
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:14,870
"That beautiful girl, 
shoots from her eyes."

1999
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:20,660
"...shoots from his eyes."

2000
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:24,370
"That handsome guy, 
shoots from her eyes."

2001
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:45,410
"...she shoots from her eyes."

2002
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:49,790
"That beautiful girl, 
shoots from her eyes."

2003
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:53,830
"That beautiful girl, 
shoots from her eyes."

2004
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:12,450
"My eyes look deeply drugged. 
I have a fair complexion."

2005
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:17,450
"along with that, I have a beautiful face. 
The eyes are watchful."

2006
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:21,870
"girl, you are so coy. 
Why do you feel shy?"

2007
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:26,200
"You have killer eyes. 
It's killing me."

2008
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:30,000
"You are so intoxicating. 
" You are like a drug.....

2009
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:34,250
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

2010
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:38,700
"there is a scene between you and me"

2011
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:07,910
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."

2012
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:11,910
"Slowly. Slowly. Slowly."
