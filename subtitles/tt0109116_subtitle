1
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,337
 The prevalent peace and tranquility
 in the Nalanda Valley...

2
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,441
 ...is a result of his
 tremendous efforts.

3
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,579
 Before colonel Anand Viraj
 went there...

4
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,580
 ...that valley was known
 as the valley of death

5
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,818
 But after he went those thousands of
 people who had left that place...

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,589
 ...due to fear, have
 started returning.

7
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,327
 ln this short span of 2 years...

8
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,328
 ...more than 20,000 terrorists
 have been arrested.

9
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,332
 And the rest are running around
 to save their lives.

10
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,473
 To maintain peace,
 the Government...

11
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,474
 ...confers Colonel Anand Viraj
 with a peace award

12
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,528
 This was a token on behalf
 of us terrorists.

13
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,666
 lf we wished, we could've
 presented this to you earlier.

14
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,069
 But we were waiting for the day...

15
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,239
 when you confer your brave colonel
 Viraj with a peace award

16
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,679
 And we could put
 an end to him forever.

17
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,019
 We pledge that every officer sent
 by your government to our area...

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,693
 ...shall meet with the same fate.

19
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,829
 Or perhaps worse than this.

20
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,502
 We are free!

21
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,503
 And we shall fight for our freedom
 till the day we have achieved it!

22
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,712
 We give you
 one months time.

23
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,451
 The army base that you've
 set up in our area...

24
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,889
 ...should be removed.

25
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,894
 lf your government fails
 to acquiesce to our demands...

26
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,330
 ...then every person...

27
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,331
 who is a well-wisher of your
 government in ourarea...

28
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,168
 shall be sent to hell.

29
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,638
 And your nation will be
 presented with such a gift...

30
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,908
 ...that future generations
 will never forget.

31
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,479
 One month! Only one month!

32
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,918
 What do we do about
 this insane man?

33
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,919
 He is the greatest threat
 to our nation's unity!

34
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,223
 Until he is arrested
 let alone this area...

35
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,061
 ...there won't be peace
 in any part of the country.

36
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,062
 Sir, we are trying
 our best to arrest him.

37
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,166
 l know.

38
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,167
 But we don't have much time.

39
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,904
 l wonder what will his next move,
 after a month, be?

40
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,554
 After years of friendship...

41
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,555
 ...l have obtained the
 nuclear bomb from foreign allies.

42
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,360
 lts time to use it.

43
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,361
 My brother, l'm entrusting
 to you a very big mission.

44
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,279
 All of you must be knowing
 who is coming to our school.

45
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,817
 Sir, my calculation says
 that the minister is coming.

46
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,823
 And you all must
 also be knowing...

47
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,824
 ...that how much donation he has...

48
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,996
 Let me complete first.

49
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,997
 - ...decided to give our school.
 - 25 lakhs

50
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,934
 You must also be aware that our
 students can ruin everything.

51
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,708
 l have left no stones unturned
 in praising tis school.

52
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,013
 As for the discipline, l said...

53
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,014
 ...that even if a small needle
 drops in this school...

54
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,851
 ...the noise echoes outside.
 But let that be.

55
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,021
 l have lied so much,
 that my tongue is burning.

56
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,358
 But all of you listen carefully.

57
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,861
 lf anything goes wrong in front of
 the minister we will lose 25 lakhs.

58
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,866
 But that will effect
 your salaries, too.

59
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,871
 Stop coughing and
 tell all your students...

60
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,878
 ...that when the flag
 is being hoisted...

61
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,880
 ...and the National Anthem
 is being played...

62
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,881
 ...they should hold their
 breath and salute the flag.

63
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,010
 - What happened, sir?
 - Wonder how this...

64
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,119
 Where does oxygen obtained
 in chemistry?

65
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 - Where has sir gone?
 - Where is he?

66
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,712
 Nice cigarette.

67
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,653
 What for? What are you doing here?

68
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,391
 l had asked you to
 come to my office.

69
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,327
 We are standing in
 your office, sir.

70
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,462
 - ls this my office?
 - Sir, l wonder who shifted...

71
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,731
 ...your office in the garden
 early in the morning?

72
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,732
 My office in the garden?
 You must be crazy!

73
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,010
 He's no V.l.P., but our new teacher.

74
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,579
 lf so, then why is he
 being welcomed like this?

75
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,748
 God knows why. Just watch...

76
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,749
 ...the principal will sing
 praises about him.

77
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,020
 Dear students, the person
 standing before you today...

78
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,592
 ...is Ajay Saxena.

79
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,864
 He is a great man.

80
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,865
 And his greatness is
 beyond any comparison.

81
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,237
 When he was a student himself
 he was an example of humanity.

82
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,211
 Had he gone in for
 further studies...

83
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,212
 He would have been a scientist,
 an engineer or agreat poet.

84
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,717
 But in my eyes, being a teacher
 is the greatest of professions.

85
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,489
 The best thing is that he was
 a student of this school.

86
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,060
 And today he is here to
 teach students of this school.

87
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,897
 The amount of affection and love
 he has for the students.

88
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,670
 l have no words to express

89
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,073
 There are no flowers left now.

90
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
 What a garland!

91
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,639
 What's this, sir?
 Are you suspecting us?

92
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,108
 This is an insult, sir.

93
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,109
 No, it is not that.

94
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,749
 When l was a student l used
 to harass my teachers, too.

95
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,288
 l thought you might do the same.

96
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,856
 l was only making sure.

97
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,857
 Breaking the legs of the chair...

98
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,861
 ...has become very outdated, sir.

99
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,997
 All this happens in
 kindergartens now.

100
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,132
 Our level is something else, sir.

101
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,133
 This means you have
 other plans for me.

102
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,136
 What is this, sir. You're scared
 before anything has begun?

103
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,139
 Don't worry. Sit down.

104
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,276
 The Principal must have
 told you about me.

105
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,515
 Now l'd like to know about you.

106
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,516
 - What is your name?
 - Your name sir, Ajay.

107
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,054
 Then you must be very clever.

108
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,055
 Yes, in all other things
 except studies.

109
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,974
 On hearing your names, l feel that
 l'm sitting in a cinema hall.

110
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,318
 l'm sorry, this is my period.

111
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,319
 You're mistaken. As per the
 time table, this is my class.

112
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,190
 You seem to be a newcomer.

113
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,627
 Probably the time-table
 you've got is wrong.

114
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,397
 Ask any student, this is
 the English language period.

115
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,035
 - Right, Ajay?
 - Yes, sir.

116
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,036
 As per our time table,
 this is the English period.

117
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,207
 But l think the time
 table has changed.

118
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,376
 lt would be better if
 you check at the office.

119
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,545
 Come again!
 Must l go and check?

120
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,214
 Look, l've been teaching
 here for the past 3 years.

121
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,216
 And you have just come.

122
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,217
 l am your senior;
 so go over and check.

123
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,654
 But the Principal...

124
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,226
 Your name?

125
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,036
 Mr. Ajay. As per my calculation
 the class that you went in...

126
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,007
 was correct and
 so was your period.

127
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,746
 Then who was that teacher?

128
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,747
 She's no teacher.
 That was Jaya, a student.

129
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,451
 A very naughty student.

130
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,054
 She stays in the hostel.
 She's number one in studies.

131
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,055
 Number one in sports.
 And number one in ragging too!

132
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,825
 She sends teacher packing
 from the classes.

133
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,073
 When you said that your
 level is different...

134
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,409
 l should have guessed.
 l got fooled.

135
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,480
 Well, who is Jaya amongst you?

136
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,354
 Who asked you to sit?
 And you can't get away like this.

137
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,291
 - What made you do that?
 - You had said, sir...

138
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,066
 You think you are too smart?!

139
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,067
 l know you are Numero Uno
 in other activities.

140
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,806
 But worst in discipline.
 This is the only drawback...

141
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,108
 ...that is enough to overshadow
 your good qualities.

142
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,109
 Sorry, sir. But they had
 laid a bet that...

143
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,146
 - l can't fool the new teacher.
 - Enough.

144
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,316
 This is the only difference
 between lndians and foreigners.

145
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,053
 lf a thorn pricks,
 them they will say....

146
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,326
 Whereas we lndians will say...
 a thorn has pricked me.

147
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,063
 As though the thorn
 walked upto them.

148
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,401
 You are blaming others
 for your mistake.

149
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,003
 Wow, sir! What an example!

150
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,940
 - lt pricked my heart.
 - You find it funny?

151
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,941
 No, sir. She's praising you.

152
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,352
 My childhood friend.
 How are you?

153
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,156
 What are you staring at?
 Don't you recognise me?

154
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,361
 l am your childhood friend, Shagun.

155
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,362
 Jaya, this new teacher
 is my childhood friend.

156
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,367
 - What is he?
 - A friend.

157
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,769
 We were studying in the same class.

158
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,770
 l got stuck here like a adhesive.

159
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,374
 And he became a teacher.

160
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,378
 - Shagun, go and sit down.
 - Let me talk.

161
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,884
 - You know what happened one day?
 - What?

162
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,885
 He went to the girls with
 the intention of teasing them.

163
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,054
 But the girls teased him instead
 and sent him back.

164
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,294
 You know why?

165
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,295
 Because he was very naive
 at that time. What?!

166
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,301
 Do you have no sense?

167
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,403
 l'm your teacher and
 you are my student.

168
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,906
 - Behave yourself.
 - Really?

169
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,575
 When we were small,
 you often said...

170
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,576
 ...that l am your friend
 your a lifetime.

171
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,580
 And you could do
 anything for me!

172
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,581
 Today you ask me
 to behave myself?

173
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,418
 Go and take your seat! Go on!

174
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,425
 Take your seat, eh?

175
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,435
 l'll go, if you insist.

176
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,674
 But l never expected
 this from you.

177
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,042
 Have you forgotten the days...

178
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,844
 ...when we used to feast on
 grams together after school.

179
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,845
 We used to fly kites
 and play together.

180
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,882
 And he broke everything
 in one stroke.

181
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,887
 - Forget it, uncle. Relax.
 - How can l forget it?

182
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,888
 He has hurt my feelings.

183
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,758
 Today in literature, l'll teach...

184
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,497
 - Why did you get up?
 - The bell, sir.

185
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,498
 Nevermind. Today's the first day.
 l'll teach one line at least.

186
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,141
 Hey!

187
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,489
 Step aside, uncle.
 l'll the cart uphill.

188
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,490
 No, son. You only
 push it from behind.

189
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,493
 Oh, move aside. lt is
 not your cup of tea.

190
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,496
 Okay. lf you insist.

191
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,668
 - You trouble the new
 teacher too much. - l have to.

192
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,359
 Why are you roaming outside?

193
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,962
 lf it's a holiday, you
 ought to sit down and study.

194
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,963
 Go and study.

195
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,395
 l know who drew
 this beautiful painting.

196
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,566
 But today, l don't want to waste
 time arguing unnecessarily.

197
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,738
 - Give me your book.
 - Here, sir.

198
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,739
 - l don't want your book
 - You sit down.

199
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,177
 ls something wrong with my book?

200
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,479
 l said l don't want it.

201
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,781
 You are humiliating me
 before the entire class.

202
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,782
 You must tell me why
 you don't want my book.

203
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,153
 l don't think it's necessary.

204
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,154
 - Go back to your seat.
 - Hey, Ajay!

205
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,759
 l mean, sir.

206
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 Yesterday you opened your books
 and the bell went off.

207
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,130
 l hope the bell doesn't ring
 before you open the book today.

208
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,601
 What?

209
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,504
 lf you continue like this,
 when will you teach us?

210
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,873
 Our studies are suffering.

211
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,609
 l know how interested
 you are in studies.

212
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,512
 - Sit down.
 - Sit down, uncle.

213
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,513
 Give it to me!

214
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,620
 Woman...

215
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,621
 l want to tell you a few important
 things about women.

216
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,092
 Do you know when a
 woman is called a woman?

217
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,167
 lt is a weird question, but...

218
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,078
 - What are you up to?
 - What have l done, sir?

219
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,079
 You know what l mean.

220
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,550
 l wonder what's wrong with him.

221
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,219
 Ever since he has come here,
 he picks on me alone.

222
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,288
 Hey, Ajay...

223
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,289
 Show me what you will do
 when your lips go dry.

224
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,062
 Yes! And you, Neelam?

225
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,668
 All of you show me.

226
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,077
 lf l did that, why is
 he shouting at me?

227
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,515
 Sir, you too!

228
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,817
 Look, Jaya.
 You are a good student.

229
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,486
 The best in every subject.

230
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,521
 But this is my second day
 in school.

231
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,356
 Let me teach one lesson at least.

232
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,357
 When have l stopped you, sir?
 Go ahead.

233
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,564
 Today l will...

234
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,319
 What's wrong, Uncle?
 Why are you sulking?

235
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,056
 What do l tell you?
 Today l dozed off in class.

236
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,727
 So Ajay has asked me
 to stand on the bench...

237
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,729
 ...for a week as punishment.

238
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,730
 My pants are short. l feel
 shy in front of the girls.

239
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,133
 Everything can be seen.
 l won't go to the class.

240
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,637
 Don't worry, uncle.
 l'll give you an idea.

241
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,207
 Get your cars here.

242
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,088
 Yesterday l asked the ass
 to stand on the bench.

243
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,091
 Looks like he has forgotten.

244
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,370
 Get down.

245
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,605
 l am obeying your orders, sir.

246
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,606
 - You told me stand here.
 - Get down and come here.

247
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,047
 Why did you wear these
 shorts to school?

248
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,048
 Because today we have
 the games period.

249
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,488
 That's for everybody else, too.
 But they aren't wearing it.

250
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,390
 - Are you special?
 - Sir...

251
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,391
 ...l feel comfortable playing
 in these bermudas.

252
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,795
 Then do one thing. l don't
 want to see you for a week.

253
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,866
 Ajay, listen to me...

254
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,913
 Sunderkhand...

255
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,816
 Sunder is another name
 for Lord Hanuman.

256
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,817
 That signifies the character
 of Lord Hanuman.

257
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,404
 Either you'll stay in this class
 or me, Jaya.

258
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,842
 Tell me who will leave.

259
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,843
 Don't bother, sir.
 l will leave.

260
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,847
 Sir! The principal!

261
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,288
 This is the D.O.
 and this is Mr.Ajay.

262
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,289
 - What are you teaching them?
 - About Sunderkand.

263
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,060
 Can l ask them a few questions?

264
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,061
 Sir, l've just begun.

265
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,531
 l won't ask much.

266
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,868
 Can anyone tell me?

267
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,539
 There is no person on earth who
 can save herself from illusion.

268
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,877
 And when he does fall under it,
 he is left nowhere.

269
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,315
 ln the beginning of
 Sunder kand when...

270
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,251
 ...in the Ashoka Vatika,
 Goddess Sita,...

271
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,420
 ...in the memory of lord
 Rama, started crying...

272
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,322
 ...on the other hand...

273
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,323
 ...Lord Rama is thinking
 about his wife Sita...

274
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,894
 ... that where she
 must be and in what state...

275
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,895
 ...starts crying and
 wanders into the jungle.

276
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,900
 That very moment, Lord Hanuman meets
 Goddess Sita in Ashoka Vatika..

277
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,906
 ..and gives her
 Lord Rama's ring.

278
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,907
 On seeing that, Goddess
 Sita overcomes her illusion.

279
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,045
 But another illusion
 starts tormenting her.

280
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,915
 Will she be able to
 meet Lord Ram again?

281
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,916
 Similarly when Lord Hanuman
 returns to Lord Rama...

282
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,487
 ...and gives Him news
 about Goddess Sita...

283
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,823
 ...He also overcomes His illusion.

284
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,259
 But immediately after, another
 illusion overtakes Him.

285
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,028
 He wonders if He will ever be
 able to see Sita again.

286
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,029
 The one who helped them both the
 illusion is Sunderkand.

287
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,436
 That is it, Sir. Our
 teacher taught us till here.

288
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,942
 How wonderfully have you
 explained it to the students.

289
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,950
 - Wonderful. Shall we go?
 - Yes.

290
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,957
 Should l still leave the class.
 Or shall l...

291
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,393
 - Wow! That's wonderful
 - You are a genius.

292
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,829
 Jaya, you wait.
 Let me phone first.

293
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,830
 - My girlfriend will fall asleep.
 - No, let me phone first.

294
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,334
 What's the matter, Sir?
 You look worried.

295
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,804
 Just see this month's
 telephone bill.

296
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,175
 l never make so many calls.

297
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,176
 lf l must, l use the
 public STD booth.

298
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,547
 What nonsense!

299
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,018
 Why are you hanging up, dad?

300
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,187
 Are you bored talking
 to your daughter?

301
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,789
 You've been talking to me for
 the last half an hour, dear.

302
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,790
 On an STD line! You know
 how much the bill will be?

303
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,197
 That's exactly why l call
 you in the nights, dad.

304
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,366
 Phone calls at night
 are for free.

305
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,367
 Our principal is a great guy.

306
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,038
 He foots the bill.

307
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,039
 l can talk to you
 for another hour!

308
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,043
 An hour!

309
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,583
 Good news!

310
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,584
 Today our teachers of Maths and
 Science haven't turned up!

311
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,154
 A free period!

312
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,370
 What's the matter?
 What's the racket for?

313
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,476
 - This is not your period, sir.
 - l know that.

314
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,813
 But the principal sent me
 so that you don't make noise...

315
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,351
 ...and bother your
 neighbouring class.

316
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,999
 Present, Sir.

317
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,438
 Present, Sir.

318
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,446
 Looks like you are not
 too happy to see me.

319
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,384
 Do you except us to rejoice?

320
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,286
 We thought that since we
 had two periods free...

321
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,287
 ..we would sing,
 dance and have fun.

322
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,290
 Would you object, if l too
 joined in in the fun?

323
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,298
 - What are you saying, Sir?
 - l am right!

324
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,558
 Wait till l tie my laces.

325
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,601
 What impudence is this?
 ls this what we teach you?

326
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,602
 - What have l done?
 - You very well know that.

327
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,605
 Aren't you ashamed of
 doing such a sick thing?

328
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,144
 Perhaps you don't know
 how the ball jumps...

329
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,145
 ...when it is kicked.
 l did nothing wrong.

330
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,482
 The sickness actually
 lies in your mind.

331
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,322
 She's your teacher

332
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,958
 Don't you know how to
 speak to your teacher?

333
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,661
 Hey, that is between us.

334
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,662
 Don't you interfere.

335
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,834
 Perhaps you don't know that
 l'm the Minister's Son.

336
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,835
 l can have you thrown
 out of school in a second!

337
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,642
 You are very strong, all right.
 Let go of my hand.

338
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,113
 Let go, l say!

339
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,546
 Drive!!

340
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,066
 Faster!

341
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,648
 lf anyone dares move,
 l'll spare no one!

342
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,085
 l'll gun 'em down! everybody!

343
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,488
 Faster!

344
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,065
 Careful!

345
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,214
 You have shown great courage.

346
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,451
 lt's better that you die!

347
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,656
 You swine!

348
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,496
 Finished!

349
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,497
 Hey, teacher! Even if the entire
 worlds' armies gets together...

350
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,734
 ...they still can't save you.

351
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,640
 Teacher! The day my brother
 learns about this...

352
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,641
 ...that will be the
 last day of your life!

353
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,348
 Take away this scoundrel!

354
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,155
 No one should know that
 l'm behind his arrest.

355
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,193
 l'm not worried about myself,
 but for those school children.

356
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,763
 They shouldn't suffer
 on account of me.

357
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,435
 You've done a great service
 to the country.

358
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,506
 This will remain a secret.

359
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,116
 May l ask you something?

360
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,117
 A while ago, when Govind
 held your hand...

361
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,620
 ...you told him that
 he was very strong.

362
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,025
 Govind is my student, Jaya.
 and this man was a traitor.

363
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,529
 l could've retaliated to
 Govind's impudence.

364
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,799
 But that wouldn't
 shatter his pride.

365
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,038
 lnfact, it would've given rise
 to a feeling of vengeance in him.

366
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,807
 Punishment doesn't
 change a student.

367
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,808
 And l wanted to see
 a change in Govind.

368
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,248
 Forgive me, Sir!

369
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,953
 Chote has been arrested! And here
 we are, twiddling our thumbs!

370
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,992
 Those dogs arrested him!

371
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,993
 My lion-hearted brother has
 been arrested by these dogs!

372
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,497
 No! No!

373
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,567
 He will be released!
 Yes, he will be freed!

374
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,606
 Anyhow and at any cost!

375
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,843
 Because only he knows where he
 has hidden the nuclear bomb.

376
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,019
 Without that bomb...

377
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,020
 ...l'll never be able to
 fulfill my vow.

378
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,558
 And l have always
 fulfilled every vow of mine!

379
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,629
 And l always fulfill this, too!

380
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,740
 Uncle!

381
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,875
 - My boy!
 - What's the matter, Uncle?

382
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,876
 Everyone's out on the ground.
 What are you doing here?

383
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,880
 Ajay suspended
 me for a week.

384
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,386
 And l missed the
 picnic and the fun.

385
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,387
 l sat at home,
 rotting like a brinjal

386
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,058
 l'll make him pay
 in such a way...

387
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,059
 ...that he will
 regret it all his life.

388
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,898
 What are you keeping
 in Jaya's book?

389
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,899
 You'll know that
 afterwards. Come on.

390
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,645
 Keep it.

391
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,580
 You haven't worn a tie today, sir.

392
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,916
 Why? Can't l teach
 without wearing a tie?

393
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,918
 Don't get annoyed, sir.

394
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,919
 But you do look smart
 and handsome in a tie.

395
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,428
 None of you will
 play any pranks.

396
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,466
 The lesson that l'm going
 to teach today...

397
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,467
 ...is very important
 and interesting.

398
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,244
 What's the matter, uncle?
 Why did he get alarmed?

399
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,948
 Have you kept a
 bomb in the book?

400
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,951
 Uncle.

401
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,294
 - Jaya... come out.
 - Me, Sir?

402
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,969
 Looks like it's a
 very interesting lesson.

403
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,306
 Sir will first
 explain it to Jaya.

404
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,976
 Jaya will explain to us.
 After that what will happen?

405
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,885
 Look Jaya, this is...

406
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,996
 ...this is the first time
 and the first letter.

407
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,833
 lf anyone finds it,
 we will both get a bad name.

408
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,026
 Hey! Why did he call you out?

409
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,029
 And what's this in your hand?

410
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,032
 Sir gave it to me.

411
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,371
 l can't believe that
 the teacher can do this!

412
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,842
 Neither can l.

413
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,843
 How have you decided
 to reply to it?

414
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,046
 That's a very interesting question..

415
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,049
 l'll think and tell you.

416
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,223
 Sir, this...

417
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,059
 Now l don't need your book.

418
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
 l've purchased one.
 Go and sit down.

419
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,084
 Uncle, looks like we won't
 have a class again today.

420
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,487
 What have you kept?

421
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,091
 Uncle.

422
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,504
 Looks like the teacher
 wants to tell you something!

423
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,508
 - Go with him...
 - Hey Shagun! That's enough!

424
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,980
 We've had enough of your pranks.

425
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,981
 Leave him alone.

426
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,630
 The teacher lives
 in Jaya's heart.

427
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,032
 And Jaya lives in
 the teacher's heart

428
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:59,033
 Jaya will give
 her heart to him!

429
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,140
 This is the second time
 and the second letter.

430
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,211
 l can't explain the trauma
 in my heart and mind.

431
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,815
 Just understand that.
 l'm terribly upset.

432
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,319
 Try and understand.

433
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,175
 Wow! A second letter?

434
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,181
 Look, if you don't love the teacher,
 then tell me.

435
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,186
 l'll give him a reply.

436
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,955
 l did not give him
 a reply till now.

437
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,956
 That doesn't mean
 l don't love him.

438
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,216
 You are a brilliant student.
 So l overlooked all your mischief.

439
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,220
 Despite two warnings, you have
 written a third love letter?

440
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,390
 That too your teacher?
 Your Guru? lt's the limit!

441
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,061
 Had someone else
 been in Mr.Ajay's place...

442
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,830
 ...he would have
 ruined your life.

443
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,831
 This is his decency
 that he complained to me.

444
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,235
 Give me a chance to speak, sir.

445
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,404
 - There's no need to speak.
 - Why not?

446
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,240
 You can't scold me by
 hearing one side of the story.

447
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,342
 Listen to my complaint, too.

448
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,878
 What is your complaint?
 Your letters are kept here.

449
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,247
 Letter! What are you saying, Sir?

450
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,249
 But have you tried to find out
 where it came from?

451
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,250
 But have you tried to find out
 where it came from?

452
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,422
 - Who wrote it? And why?
 - Really?

453
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,325
 Who wrote it?
 You wrote it, of course?

454
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,093
 l have not written
 this letter, Sir.

455
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,996
 He wrote it to me.

456
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,997
 What nonsense!
 Look within!

457
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,567
 Who else wrote it to me?
 Try and remember.

458
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,604
 When you first gave this to me
 what did you say?

459
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,942
 ''This is the first time
 and the first letter''

460
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,943
 ''lf anyone finds it,
 we will get a bad name''

461
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,882
 - Am l right?
 - What else could l do?

462
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,551
 How else could l stop you
 from going astray?

463
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,552
 ln that case, when you gave me the
 second letter why did you say...

464
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,289
 l can't explain the restlessness
 going on in my heart and mind.

465
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,463
 Try and understand that
 l'm very disturbed.

466
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,465
 Mr. Ajay, what confusion is this?

467
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,466
 You're blaming her and
 she's blaming you!

468
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,303
 You know how much
 l respect my Guru.

469
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,507
 l swear by you! l haven't
 written those letters.

470
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,479
 Look, he is ready
 to swear by me.

471
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,480
 Then l also swear by you, sir.

472
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,151
 That neither did l
 write those letters.

473
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,152
 What nonsense!
 Both of you are swearing by me.

474
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,656
 That means one of you is lying
 and death for me is certain.

475
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,727
 Better tell me truth.

476
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,728
 Very well, sir.
 lf you suspect me...

477
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,900
 ...then l have no right
 to teach here anymore.

478
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,901
 Kindly accept my
 resignation tomorrow.

479
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,506
 Okay... No!
 Hey, Mr. Ajay.

480
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,842
 l can't afford to lose
 a teacher like you.

481
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,843
 The inquiry will go on.
 Now l'll hold her at fault.

482
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,346
 Tell me, what punishment
 should we give her?

483
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,517
 She should be give
 a punishment...

484
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,786
 ...that will be a lesson
 for all other students.

485
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,355
 Suspend her for 15 days.

486
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,356
 lsn't that too much?
 Her studies will suffer.

487
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,759
 No, Sir. She will stay
 in the hostel and study.

488
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,697
 Enough!

489
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,698
 There's no need to
 praise me unnecessarily.

490
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,834
 You wanted to suspend me
 and you have done it.

491
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,072
 Are you at peace now?

492
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,548
 But l am not at peace.

493
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,384
 Because this issue still
 remains unresolved.

494
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,385
 lf the boys get a whiff of
 this love letter...

495
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,989
 ...they'll create a furore.

496
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,725
 There's a class going on.
 Why are you standing outside?

497
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,726
 - l was waiting for you.
 - What for?

498
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,597
 To tell you...

499
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,598
 ...that Jaya didn't write
 that love letter to you.

500
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,734
 l placed it in your book.

501
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,071
 - What?
 - You suspended me for a week.

502
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,175
 And l missed my picnic. So l did
 this to seek vengeance from you.

503
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,080
 Jaya is not at fault.

504
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,516
 l swear by the holy Ganga.
 Believe me.

505
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,309
 Jaya, there is a saying...

506
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,215
 l made a big mistake by complaining
 without even thinking about it.

507
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,953
 Actually it was Shagun's prank;
 Forgive me.

508
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:57,391
 A girl's name is published with a
 boy's name first on a wedding card

509
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,462
 But our name has been
 written all over...

510
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,463
 ...the school compound
 and the hostel's bathroom.

511
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:08,404
 Now we have only
 one solution, Sir.

512
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,673
 That we become each
 other's forever.

513
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,341
 Whom are you talking to?

514
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,342
 l am your teacher
 and you are my student.

515
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,813
 Aren't you ashamed
 to talk like this?

516
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,815
 What stuff are you made of, sir?

517
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,816
 When a beautiful young girl
 says ''l love you'' to a man...

518
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,653
 ...he will dance with joy!

519
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,159
 Look, Sir. Don't refuse.

520
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,828
 Think about me at night.

521
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,829
 l promise you,
 you won't sleep a wink.

522
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,334
 Next day, when you
 come to school...

523
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,335
 ...your decision will be changed.

524
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,851
 Wrack your brains all
 the six days in school!

525
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,622
 You get just one day off.

526
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,623
 And you waste that
 of those poor flowers!

527
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,993
 Enjoy your life sometimes.

528
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,868
 She stays in a hostel
 What is she doing in your house?

529
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,306
 - My house?
 - l'll explain.

530
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,307
 Go away.

531
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,879
 Actually, sir...

532
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,880
 l have left the hostel and
 am neighbour now.

533
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,884
 l mean, l am a paying guest
 at Mr. Panipur Sharma's house.

534
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,890
 The food and accommodation together
 cost me 1000 Rupees a month.

535
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,763
 A penny for your thoughts, sir.

536
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,898
 l told you the other day itself.

537
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,033
 That breaking free from
 the whirlpool of sadness...

538
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,436
 ...and reaching the shore
 of happiness is 'Sunderkand'.

539
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,437
 And my Sunderkand
 is to find you.

540
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,674
 To come close to you;
 to have you for myself.

541
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,013
 And this is my first step
 towards my goal.

542
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,249
 You are naive, Jaya.

543
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,250
 You are childish.
 You'll regret all this someday.

544
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,754
 Because yours desire
 will never be fulfilled.

545
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,755
 Well, sir! Don't bless me;
 but don't curse me, too.

546
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,194
 This is my first and last desire.

547
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,363
 - l'll see how it...
 - Now look, Jaya.

548
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,365
 l have this hedge-trimmer
 in my hand.

549
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,366
 l could cut your neck with it!
 - Don't be angry, sir.

550
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,336
 Because even your anger can't
 make me give up.

551
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,278
 Don't go to school alone.

552
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,480
 Let me pillion-ride
 on your scooter.

553
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,481
 We will have a nice
 conversation on the way.

554
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,730
 - Greetings.
 - Greetings.

555
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,166
 - Go in, dear.
 - You come in too.

556
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,167
 What will l do in there?
 l'm fine here.

557
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,205
 Very well.

558
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,206
 Sonam, what is all this?

559
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,810
 Did you see a girl and
 the teacher going in?

560
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,912
 l've been noticing from
 the past few days.

561
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,913
 Every second day, this woman
 comes to him with a new girl.

562
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,318
 She waits outside and the girl
 goes inside with the teacher.

563
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,190
 At what time
 does she come out?

564
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,191
 Some come out in 15 minutes;
 whereas same stay on for 1/2 hour.

565
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,865
 What could it be?

566
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,866
 How could the teacher do that?

567
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,136
 When a girl matures, only
 then is she called a woman.

568
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,708
 You have not answered
 my question properly.

569
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,347
 Why do you look at
 that picture every time?

570
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,150
 That's my Grandma.
 She is no more.

571
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,188
 But even today, when l look
 at that picture...

572
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,025
 ...l feel as if
 she is talking to me.

573
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,268
 One last question.

574
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,104
 Why does a woman light
 a lamp in the house?

575
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,105
 - To do away darkness.
 - ls it only that?

576
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,108
 Yes, to illuminate the house.

577
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,381
 A lamp does illuminate the house.

578
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,382
 But my grandma says that
 a lamp is lit in the house...

579
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,853
 ...to bring in peace,
 harmony and wealth.

580
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,123
 - Do you understand?
 - Yes.

581
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,729
 Please don't misunderstand me.

582
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,730
 - This girl also is...
 - What are you talking about?

583
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,069
 How can l misunderstand you?

584
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,070
 You want to marry an orphan
 and give her a home.

585
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,340
 lt's the orphan's good fortune.
 Don't you worry.

586
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,478
 There are 350 girls
 in my orphanage.

587
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,914
 Till you don't get
 a girl of your choice...

588
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,216
 - ...l'll keep on coming here.
 - Thank you.

589
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,217
 l want the girl to be
 educated, understanding...

590
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,255
 ...and an ideal home-maker.
 These are only the qualities.

591
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:02,362
 Stop here.

592
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,102
 Can you tell me where
 Mr Ajay Kumar Saxena lives?

593
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,672
 That's me.

594
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,008
 l've came from the
 Shivnandan orphanage.

595
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,943
 what about
 the other woman?

596
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,112
 She is not well
 and couldn't make it.

597
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,314
 Okay, never mind.

598
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,984
 l've got a girl.
 But she is a Muslim.

599
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,685
 Do you have any objection?

600
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,686
 Not at all. l don't
 distinguish in religions.

601
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,991
 Come, dear.

602
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,992
 - Greetings.
 - Greetings to you, too.

603
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,029
 Do come in.

604
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,535
 Here is your reward.
 Now get going!

605
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,141
 Your name?

606
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,280
 Never mind, l'll memorise it.

607
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,684
 Can l ask you a few questions?
 - Sure. Go right ahead.

608
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,890
 But even l'd like to
 ask you a few questions.

609
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,792
 Of course. Ladies first.

610
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,793
 Tell me, when a cow
 gives birth to a calf...

611
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,463
 ...the calf immediately traces
 its mother's udders for milk.

612
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,167
 How does it know
 that milk is there?

613
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,039
 - What a question.
 - Answer me.

614
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,840
 Unlike us human-beings...

615
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,841
 animals cannot speak and
 guide their little ones.

616
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,178
 Yet, how do they happen
 to know everything?

617
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:28,381
 How do they drink milk without
 their mother's guidance?

618
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,522
 lf you ask a layman this question...

619
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,026
 ...even he will answer it.

620
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,995
 All this is nature's law.

621
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,996
 The act of seeking out milk among
 calves is called the fifth sense.

622
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:47,536
 Oh, well!
 So that is how it is!

623
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,705
 Animals only have five senses.

624
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,340
 And yet, according to nature's law,
 they are so sensible.

625
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,341
 Whereas human-beings have six senses
 and they are still such idiots.

626
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,213
 - Meaning?
 - l mean...

627
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,549
 ... a child grows in
 the arms of a woman...

628
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,550
 ...sees women and
 understands women...

629
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,220
 ...that, he becomes so immature
 at the time of marriage...

630
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,223
 ...that he needs to take
 interviews of his future brides?

631
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,560
 Don't be offended, but are you
 interviewing a steno or typist...

632
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,699
 ...that you'd feel
 happy if she says...

633
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,901
 ...that she has
 ten years of experience?

634
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,902
 lf l say that l have
 ten years of experience...

635
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,874
 ...of married life,
 will you accept me?

636
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,875
 Will you like it?

637
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,682
 - Would you like to ask me anything?
 - No!

638
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,422
 Oh, no.
 You must ask me something.

639
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,423
 Perhaps you know something
 that l don't know.

640
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,994
 Even l'd get to know of it.

641
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,995
 Very well. Why does a woman
 light a lamp in the house?

642
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,338
 Difficult question, isn't it?
 But never mind.

643
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,275
 Think and tell me.
 lf you still can't answer it...

644
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,747
 ...then l will tell you.

645
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,748
 Different women light lamps
 for different reasons.

646
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,619
 A poor woman lights it
 to illuminate her hut.

647
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,623
 A courtesan, to brighten
 the mood of the gathering.

648
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,626
 A devotee, to please her God.

649
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,096
 And a housewife
 lights a lamp...

650
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,299
 ...to bring in wealth,
 peace and harmony.

651
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,773
 One last question;
 can you sing?

652
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,774
 Why? lf l can't,
 won't you marry me?

653
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,312
 When a man returns from work...

654
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,315
 ...he wants his wife to
 press his hands and legs.

655
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,953
 Will l have to press
 your hands and legs, too?

656
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,322
 - Are women mere slaves?
 - Don't be angry, madam.

657
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,491
 l didn't mean that.
 There are few days in a month...

658
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,726
 ...when women also rest.

659
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:54,727
 So will you press my
 legs during that period?

660
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,332
 Why not?

661
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,333
 - Okay, then l can sing.
 - Then please sing! Please do!

662
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,270
 For that we'll have to
 go to beautiful valleys.

663
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,340
 Where there is
 greenery all around.

664
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,710
 Where there are huge mountains.

665
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,515
 And the beautiful waterfalls.

666
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,350
 - Waterfalls?
 - Yes.

667
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,351
 Where we're surrounded
 by many young maidens.

668
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,400
 Where is that woman
 who was with you?

669
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,401
 - Anything important?
 - No. l wanted to tell her...

670
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,640
 ...that l've decided to marry you.

671
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,476
 But you haven't even seen my face.

672
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,477
 Looks hold no importance for me.

673
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,647
 lt's the person's nature and
 heart that ought to be good.

674
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,653
 Won't you change your decision
 once you've seen my face?

675
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,654
 My name is Ajay Kumar Saxena.
 l'm a man of word.

676
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,833
 Don't look at me like this...

677
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,834
 You've given me your word.
 You don't go back on it.

678
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,442
 Try getting married once.

679
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,443
 Yes, sir. Don't break her heart.
 She loves you very much.

680
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,316
 Aren't you ashamed of playing
 such a dirty trick...

681
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,317
 ...and talking like
 this with your teacher?

682
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,954
 Your parents send you so far to
 study only because they trust us.

683
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,694
 Because they hold us
 in great respect.

684
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,695
 - They have an image...
 - Are you rejecting me...

685
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,766
 ...just because l am your student?

686
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,767
 Yes. lt's because you're my
 student. That is why!

687
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,372
 What childishness is this, dear?

688
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,710
 - l won't let you go...
 - What's the matter, sir?

689
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,513
 l don't know, but
 she's leaving the school.

690
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,514
 Why this sudden decision?
 What's the reason?

691
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,155
 Are studies more important
 or life?

692
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,724
 Life is more important but...

693
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,493
 Then just think...

694
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,462
 ...that this is
 a matter of my life.

695
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,065
 - What are you saying?
 - Don't worry, sir.

696
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,066
 l'll explain to her Jaya;
 one minute.

697
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,341
 Now l'm not your student.

698
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:49,342
 And that is why l've done this.

699
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,945
 From today l'm Jaya for you
 and you are just Ajay for me.

700
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,752
 Only Ajay.

701
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,765
 Mr Ajay...!

702
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:16,269
 We need not worry about
 each other anymore.

703
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:21,407
 l will not trouble you either.
 Ask me why?

704
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,278
 Because tomorrow l'm going to
 marry the teacher, Shobha.

705
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,052
 Here is my wedding card.

706
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,053
 Do attend the wedding and
 give us your blessings.

707
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,794
 Shobha... will you step
 aside for a moment, please?

708
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,797
 What's this?
 She's going to be my wife!

709
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,301
 Why are you calling her
 out there in the covers?

710
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,639
 What's all this about?
 Shagun is your student!

711
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,810
 And you are marrying him?!

712
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,811
 l've had many suitors to come
 and take a look at me, Ajay.

713
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,481
 And all they wanted was a bank;
 not a wife.

714
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,885
 Everybody asked me what
 l could give them in dowry.

715
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,954
 And do you know
 what Shagun told me?

716
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,991
 He said ''You are wise
 and educated''

717
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,595
 'l am uneducated
 But l have plenty of money'.

718
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,233
 'l'll keep you very happy'.

719
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,103
 He only wanted my approval.

720
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:25,104
 - So l agreed.
 - Yet, he's your student.

721
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,841
 Which law book states that a student
 and teacher can't marry?

722
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,848
 Shobha! Are you discussing
 school matters...

723
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,849
 ...or is it personal?
 What's holding you up?

724
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,020
 l'm through.

725
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,089
 So, Mr. Ajay;
 you must attend.

726
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,090
 Yes, do come.

727
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,328
 What is it, sir?

728
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:50,329
 Why are Shagun and
 the teacher together?

729
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,266
 l know everything!
 Now, what do you say?

730
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,270
 You're always singing the same
 song of teacher and student!

731
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,676
 - Do you have an answer now?
 - Yes, l do!

732
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,746
 When l was in school, a student
 eloped with his teacher.

733
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,250
 Do you know what the
 student's parents did?

734
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,885
 They committed suicide.

735
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,854
 Till today, that incident
 haunts my mind.

736
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,855
 You pose a question
 and answer it, too

737
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,892
 l don't care what you think.

738
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,962
 But l've made up my mind today.

739
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,702
 This is the fist step
 towards our love.

740
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,138
 ls this your belt?

741
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,139
 This is a wedding necklace!
 Learn to respect it.

742
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,909
 Look, Jaya. l've
 promised the principal...

743
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,080
 ...that l'd bring
 you around somehow.

744
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,049
 Forget all this and
 concentrate on your studies.

745
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,485
 l am firm in my decision, sir.

746
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,088
 l want to win a distinction
 by becoming your life.

747
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,089
 Marry someone else
 and get 1000/0 marks!

748
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,859
 l have no objection but...

749
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,695
 l can't even think of
 anyone else anymore.

750
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,731
 l give you a week's time.

751
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,732
 On the eighth day, you must
 put this around my neck.

752
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,402
 Otherwise, l'll repeat the
 story you told me about.

753
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,940
 Meaning?

754
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,941
 A teacher from your school
 eloped with a student...

755
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,279
 ...and her parents
 committed suicide.

756
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,280
 lf you don't marry me
 l'll drown myself in the sea.

757
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,853
 And you'll lose face.

758
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,955
 The decision lies in your hands.

759
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,956
 Be damned or accept
 this wedding chain.

760
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,979
 That was not fair
 on your part, Jaya.

761
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,980
 By threatening him, you've
 landed him in deep trouble.

762
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,151
 Poor fellow has gone
 out since yesterday.

763
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,986
 l hope he hasn't fled the city
 out of fear.

764
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,987
 No! Looks like he has returned!

765
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,991
 But why's he in a car
 instead of a scooter?

766
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,088
 What is this, Mr.Ajay?
 You got married all of a sudden!

767
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:32,026
 Greetings, sister-in-law
 He didn't even inform me.

768
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,027
 Mr. Ajay, this is a damned
 good calculation, l say!

769
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,032
 One gardener and two flowers!

770
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,034
 - Congratulations, Ajay.
 - What are you doing?

771
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,436
 Hang on. According
 to the traditions...

772
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:45,437
 ...this is necessary when
 a newly wedded-bride comes home.

773
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,378
 According to tradition,
 the groom's relatives...

774
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,379
 ...give her gold jewellery, too.

775
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,617
 Who will do all this?

776
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,618
 The teacher has no one;
 the girl is an orphan.

777
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,455
 The teacher got married
 in an orphanage in haste.

778
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,193
 lt's not a matter of haste
 or being an orphan, Mr. Mishra.

779
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,194
 l had already decided to
 get married to an orphan.

780
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,667
 That was really very nice of you.

781
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,668
 But it is necessary to
 follow the traditions.

782
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,872
 From today we are her relatives.

783
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:24,579
 Mr. Ajay!

784
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,315
 Were you a playwriter before?

785
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,417
 You know when to
 bring someone home!

786
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:32,086
 And when to make a paying guest
 out of someone.

787
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,087
 You are good at
 synchronizing things.

788
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:38,157
 By the way, my calculation
 was something else.

789
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,493
 But you did something else!

790
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:48,233
 - What are you doing here?
 - Where do l go?

791
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,173
 Wow! Fantastic!

792
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:55,174
 lt doesn't rain; it pours!

793
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,444
 Some are so lucky with women
 and some are yet...

794
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,982
 Mr. Panipuri, why are you standing?

795
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,983
 Please sit down. l'll some send tea.

796
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,198
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Go away.

797
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,003
 Doing up your bed for the nuptials.

798
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,105
 So the next time
 you remember it...

799
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,873
 Remember what?

800
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,874
 When l come here as a bride you
 must keep this bed decorated.

801
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,312
 Look, Jaya, it's because of you
 that l got married in haste.

802
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:36,548
 So that your career
 doesn't get spoilt.

803
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,285
 Whatever be the reason,
 it's good enough.

804
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,156
 Atleast you'll get some
 first-hand experience.

805
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,160
 lt'll be handy when we do it.

806
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,865
 Don't talk nonsense
 or l'll kill you!

807
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,866
 l am a married man.

808
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,169
 Get married seven times,
 for all l care!

809
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,673
 l'll still become your eighth
 wife and come here.

810
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,243
 That's a promise.

811
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,842
 You are the judge.
 And this is your court.

812
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,814
 But today l'll give the verdict.

813
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:45,017
 lf my brother is not
 handed over to me...

814
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,220
 ...then all your people.
 will be sentenced to death.

815
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,830
 - What's the position?
 - 100 of our men are trapped.

816
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:58,831
 And most important, the
 judge is in their custody.

817
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,458
 Hold the fire!

818
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,397
 He has threatened to kill one
 of our men, ever half minute.

819
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,567
 - Take a decision quickly, sir.
 - Hey, minister!

820
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,939
 You have no option
 but to release me.

821
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,940
 Look!

822
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,651
 They're bringing Chote upstairs.

823
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,038
 My brother!

824
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,039
 No, brother!
 Don't come close to me.

825
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,142
 Why have you stopped, Captain?!

826
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:54,112
 Won't you take
 your brother along?

827
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,984
 He is before your eyes!

828
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,985
 A few steps away from you!

829
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:03,021
 lf you have the guts,
 then take him away!

830
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,392
 Go on!

831
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:08,393
 But remember! You can't take
 him alive from here!

832
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,498
 You'll have to look for
 pieces of his body!

833
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,272
 What do you guys think?!

834
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,273
 That you alone can play human bombs
 and kill yourselves?

835
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:25,043
 We can sacrifice our lives, too!

836
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,380
 The only difference is, you
 die for your selfish ends.

837
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,717
 And we die for our nation!

838
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,254
 East or west... lndia is the best.

839
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,824
 We live here...
 lt is our paradise.

840
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,531
 Looks like we are being
 trapped in a conversation.

841
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,664
 What do you want?

842
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,701
 You were going away on
 a transfer from Kalipur.

843
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:26,204
 But it won't be you... it'll be
 this chap who will go there.

844
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,353
 You are very fortunate, Saraswati,
 that the teacher...

845
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,555
 ...agreed to marry you
 the moment he saw you.

846
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:17,324
 Or else, he had asked me
 such difficult questions.

847
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,326
 - Really?
 - But probably...

848
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,495
 ...the questions he asked
 me before marriage...

849
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,664
 ...is something he can ask you
 after marriage.

850
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,665
 On your wedding night.

851
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,508
 What happened?

852
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:37,509
 Why are you crying?
 Did someone say something to you?

853
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,052
 l'm an orphan.

854
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:48,053
 l never even dreamt that
 l'd get a husband like you.

855
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,991
 You've done a big favour
 by marrying me.

856
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,529
 l have not done any favour.

857
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,530
 l'm a man. And every man
 needs a companion in his life.

858
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,201
 You are a woman. And you
 need a life partner,...

859
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:04,202
 ...to support you, too.
 So that makes us equal.

860
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,612
 Yes.

861
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:14,613
 Come on.

862
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,884
 Sit down.

863
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:22,554
 What's this? Why are
 you sitting down?

864
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,757
 - How can l sit with you?
 - Oh, no! Sit up here.

865
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,729
 You are my wife, not my slave.

866
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,400
 Look, Saraswati.

867
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,401
 l love only three people.
 The first is my grandma.

868
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,740
 She raised me.

869
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,741
 The second is the teacher
 who taught me to be what l am.

870
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,946
 And the third is you...
 Because you're my wife.

871
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,947
 Before you came, it
 was only those books.

872
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,786
 People call me a book-worm.

873
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:55,787
 - Oh yes, get Milton's 'Paradise
 lost' from there. - Yes.

874
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,591
 Milton writes, that if a husband
 and wife understand each other...

875
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,430
 ...their lives will be better
 than that in Paradise.

876
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,736
 - What's this?
 - You uttered a big name.

877
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,175
 So l got the thickest book.

878
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,176
 What? How far have you studied?

879
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,514
 Why are you quiet?

880
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,757
 - Class five.
 - Class five?!

881
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,961
 Then why did you name
 yourself Saraswati?

882
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,997
 Not l, my parents gave me
 the name.

883
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:42,334
 - To cheat me?
 - But it is not my fault.

884
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,873
 When l was in the fifth,
 the teacher said...

885
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,642
 ...l should be in fourth
 when l went to fourth...

886
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,011
 ...that teacher told me
 l should be in third.

887
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:54,012
 Then l passed third
 fourth and fifth.

888
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,916
 l was demoted again;
 this happened thrice.

889
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,320
 Then l grew up.

890
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,321
 l felt shy studying
 with small children.

891
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,660
 l quit studies Saraswati.

892
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,661
 When l asked you in English...

893
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,664
 - ...why did you nod your head?
 - You nodded your head, too..

894
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:15,736
 - So l followed suit.
 - Sit down.

895
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,672
 You are zero in English.

896
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:21,673
 But do you know Hindi?

897
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:24,211
 What does this mean?

898
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:26,847
 lf you know it,
 nod like this...

899
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,283
 ...and if you don't,
 do this.

900
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,251
 l do.

901
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:34,252
 Can you cook?

902
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,889
 You absolutely name.

903
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,692
 Nod your head and
 say you know everything.

904
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,693
 - Then gradually learn it.
 - But it's a sin to lie.

905
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:45,397
 Not at all. Do as l say.

906
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,500
 Otherwise your house will
 break before it's made.

907
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,803
 A penny for your thoughts!
 l had asked you...

908
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,707
 - ...do you know to cook?
 - l do.

909
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,278
 Thank God.

910
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:01,279
 Look, l'm very fond of food.

911
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,718
 More than vegetarian,
 l love non-vegetarian fare.

912
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,721
 But if the vegetarian food is good
 enough, l don't mind it either.

913
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:13,124
 But l like everything in non-veg.

914
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,731
 Meat-balls, liver, kidney...

915
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,969
 Listen, don't let your
 husband talk too much.

916
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,739
 Yet if he asks too many questions...

917
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,310
 ...switch off the
 light immediately.

918
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:33,213
 That changes a man's mood.

919
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:36,214
 And in vegetarian...

920
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:42,954
 Saraswati, why have you
 switched off the lights?

921
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:46,324
 On our wedding night,
 will you only talk?

922
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,895
 Oh wow!

923
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,896
 l thought you are absolutely
 naive about this.

924
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:57,168
 Grandma, why are you
 staring like this?

925
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:00,272
 Close your eyes.

926
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,843
 Sister-in-law.

927
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:05,145
 Sister-in-law!
 Sister-in-law!

928
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:07,781
 Saraswati, what's the matter,
 my dear?

929
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,782
 He thought perhaps he is marrying...

930
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,785
 ...an educated girl who is
 also good at cooking

931
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:16,290
 But when he learnt
 that l've studied...

932
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,291
 ...only till the fifth class,
 he was very upset.

933
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,794
 - That means, last night...
 - No, l handled that.

934
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,432
 We slept at 4 this morning.

935
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,802
 - You are very smart.
 - Sure, sister-in-law.

936
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:35,373
 lf he learnt that along with being
 uneducated l don't know to cook...

937
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:40,047
 ...l wonder how upset
 he would have become.

938
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,149
 - Good.
 - But at night he said...

939
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,085
 - Good.
 - But at night he said...

940
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,554
 ...wake him up in the
 morning with... what is it?

941
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:50,555
 - Oh yes Gascoffee!
 - ''Gascoffee'' ?

942
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:53,560
 Not ''Gascoffee''! lt's Nescafe.

943
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,561
 Oh yes! But how do l make that?

944
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:58,165
 l am getting very scared.

945
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,166
 Silly girl.
 Don't worry till l'm around.

946
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:05,103
 lf there's any problem,
 just come to me.

947
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:08,173
 Don't hesitate. Everything
 will be alright soon.

948
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,844
 - Thunk you sister-in-law
 - lt's thank you!

949
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:20,852
 Wow! What coffee!

950
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:24,458
 Didn't l say that
 except a few departments...

951
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:27,459
 ...God has made you talented
 in everything else.

952
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,330
 l feel like giving you a
 reward early in the morning.

953
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,466
 You'll get late for school.

954
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:34,935
 You freshen up. l'll
 prepare your breakfast.

955
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:37,936
 - Forget breakfast.
 - Leave me.

956
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,809
 Here lentil-curry, puris
 and stuffed pancakes.

957
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,810
 You're very nice, sister-in-law.

958
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,388
 What's the matter?
 Aren't the pancakes good enough?

959
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,323
 Sister-in-law!

960
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,925
 - Sister-in-law
 - Why are you... - One minute.

961
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,527
 What is the matter, Ajay?

962
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,296
 Your husband Mr. Panipuri Sharma...

963
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:06,099
 ...always sings your praises.

964
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,100
 ...that no one can prepare stuffed
 parathas better than my wife.

965
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:17,477
 Saraswati, go and give
 her some parathas.

966
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,147
 - Sure.
 - Why send it again?

967
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:23,148
 - l mean, she has already
 given some to me. - What?

968
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:30,255
 So, how did you find them?

969
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:33,558
 What do l say?
 l'll tell Mr. Sharma...

970
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:37,095
 ...not to sing praise
 my praises anymore.

971
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:41,065
 - Hey, Saraswati.
 - Yes. - Come here.

972
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,238
 You still don't feel
 like going to school?

973
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:48,239
 No. Actually, apart from me, there
 are a few bachelors...

974
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,076
 - ...who teach in the school.
 - l see.

975
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,511
 Before they make fun of me...

976
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:54,414
 ...l want to tell them the
 advantages of marriage.

977
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,950
 Do one thing, prepare
 chicken biryani and

978
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:59,951
 ...chicken curry for 10-15
 people and send it to school.

979
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,955
 - Sure.
 - What are you thinking?

980
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:07,091
 About the chicken biryani.

981
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,229
 - And chicken...
 - Curry.

982
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,965
 lf possible, send some
 chicken fry too.

983
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,734
 lt's a matter of my honour.
 The food had better be good.

984
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:17,735
 Bye.

985
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,473
 l'll send the peon to collect it.

986
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,913
 Oh God!
 Sister-in-law!

987
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,319
 She's a vegetarian!
 What do l do now?

988
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,227
 What do l do now?

989
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:43,228
 Wonder what will happen?

990
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:48,099
 Don't laugh, grandma.
 You tell me...

991
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,669
 ...what will l send
 with the peon?

992
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:55,106
 And what will l tell him
 when he asks me?

993
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,011
 The very thought is scaring me.

994
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:03,817
 l've come from the school
 to take away the tiffin.

995
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:06,753
 Jaya, look. The peon is here.

996
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,456
 - What will she do now?
 - God knows.

997
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:12,457
 She has not even made
 preparations for cooking.

998
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,428
 - Good-day, madam.
 - Good-day. - Give me.

999
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,470
 Babu, wait! Hey!

1000
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,639
 Hey what are you doing?
 lt's Mr. Ajay's tiffin.

1001
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,841
 We know. You just shut up.

1002
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:30,842
 lt's empty.

1003
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,051
 'My dear husband;
 please don't get angry.'

1004
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:41,052
 'But the truth is,
 l don't know to cook'.

1005
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,056
 'Your useless wife, Saraswati'.

1006
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:58,069
 Darling, where are you?

1007
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,177
 What's wrong?

1008
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:07,178
 Why are you so scared?

1009
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,188
 Hit me.

1010
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:18,189
 You must have understood
 about my cooking skills.

1011
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:21,259
 Not only l, the entire
 staff has understood it.

1012
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,429
 Wow! What delicious
 biryani you sent me.

1013
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:27,832
 They couldn't stop
 licking their fingers.

1014
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,140
 Look what l've got for you.

1015
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:37,110
 These flowers. This sari.

1016
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,279
 - D'you like it?
 - Yes.

1017
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,280
 - Then shall we go?
 - Where to?

1018
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:19,052
 Hey wait! Keep this.

1019
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:22,053
 - What for? - You did
 a very big thing yesterday.

1020
01:39:22,189 --> 01:39:24,991
 Had you not brought
 food from the hotel...

1021
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:27,460
 ...l would have to bear his brunt.

1022
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,629
 This includes money for the
 food and your reward.

1023
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:32,630
 l didn't do anything.
 lt was Jaya who gave that food.

1024
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:36,467
 Who? What name did you say?

1025
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:40,071
 - Who's this Jaya?
 - She...

1026
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,474
 - Who is this Jaya?
 - Your neighbour.

1027
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:47,211
 Neighbour?

1028
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:54,821
 Who the hell are you?

1029
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,822
 You think you are a celestial
 beauty from the heavens?

1030
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:01,492
 Why did you send food
 for him? With what right?

1031
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,997
 He's my husband. Whether
 l send him food or no...

1032
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,500
 ...it's my wish. Who are you
 to pry in our matters?

1033
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:11,904
 You are very fond of my husband?

1034
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:14,240
 lf you can't wait, then
 why don't you get married?

1035
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,976
 Why do you covet my husband?

1036
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:19,977
 Hey, who is Jaya amongst
 the two of you?

1037
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:24,048
 Tell me, who is Jaya?

1038
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,519
 You glass-wearing idiot!

1039
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,022
 Why did you send Biryani
 for my husband?

1040
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,524
 At whose behest? Answer me!

1041
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,693
 - Jaya did that...
 - Hey you lizard!

1042
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,362
 lf you interrupt l'll
 slap you so hard...

1043
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,631
 ...that all your teeth
 will fall out!

1044
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:41,534
 Get lost!

1045
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:44,535
 Tell me, you felt pity for him?

1046
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:47,140
 You couldn't see him
 stay hungry, eh?

1047
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:50,141
 You thought, you'd stealthily
 carry on your tricks...

1048
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:52,412
 ...and l won't be aware of it?

1049
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:55,413
 Hey, if you are so much on fire
 go and extinguish it elsewhere!

1050
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:59,050
 Henceforth if you look
 at my husband...

1051
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:02,086
 l'll break your spectacles
 and your eyes.

1052
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,658
 Understand!

1053
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:08,227
 lf you think l'm uneducated...

1054
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,563
 ...and you'll woo my
 husband with your talks...

1055
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:13,564
 ...you're wrong. Because
 l'm good at other things.

1056
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,736
 One loses control
 on oneself in anger.

1057
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:19,038
 And you have proved it.

1058
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:21,574
 You gave such a big
 sermon to that poor girl.

1059
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,477
 Without knowing what
 her fault is.

1060
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:27,213
 Do you know how
 kind-hearted she is?!

1061
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:29,582
 Oh yeah, you'll surely support her.

1062
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,751
 After all she is your
 paying-guest. And l?

1063
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,752
 - l'm just your neighbour.
 - Saraswati! - Enough!

1064
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,789
 Now l know you very well.

1065
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:39,092
 The other day you put
 this chain around me...

1066
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,461
 ...so that you can tell
 me whatever you like.

1067
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:44,263
 Here!

1068
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:46,532
 Saraswati, you are
 making another mistake.

1069
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:49,268
 l'm making a mistake?!
 And that girl!

1070
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:52,269
 She is doing is virtuous deed
 by eyeing my husband!

1071
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,607
 Today it's my husband;
 tomorrow it can be yours!

1072
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,611
 But your husband is an old man.
 You have no worries.

1073
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:04,448
 But my husband is young,
 handsome and naive.

1074
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:08,187
 l have to save him from
 the evil eyes, don't l?

1075
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:11,188
 You are talking too much.

1076
01:42:11,558 --> 01:42:14,558
 Forget it, sister-in-law.
 l've respected you enough.

1077
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:17,628
 - l'll never see your
 face again. - Wait!

1078
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,631
 Before going, return this
 chain to the one it belongs to.

1079
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:24,702
 What do you mean?
 You put this around me.

1080
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,205
 l did but this is not
 my chain; it's Jaya's.

1081
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,380
 The day you came here everybody
 was calling you an orphan.

1082
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:40,453
 She couldn't endure it.
 You know what she said?

1083
01:42:40,454 --> 01:42:43,454
 Sister-in-law. A woman comes to her
 husbands house with great hopes.

1084
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:48,092
 lt's not fair to treat her like
 this on the very first day.

1085
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,864
 She has no one, sister-in-law.

1086
01:42:51,865 --> 01:42:54,865
 Hence l'll consider her
 as my sister from today.

1087
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:58,669
 Give this to her.

1088
01:43:03,877 --> 01:43:06,112
 Good Lord!

1089
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:09,113
 What have l done?
 May l be damned!

1090
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,684
 l said so many things
 without even thinking.

1091
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:16,754
 Which is why it is said that
 it is necessary to be educated.

1092
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:22,695
 l have hurt her feelings.

1093
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,696
 l've hurt the one who
 considered me as her sister.

1094
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:34,207
 My sister! Forgive me.

1095
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,208
 lt was my foolishness that
 l misunderstood you.

1096
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:41,345
 But you should have
 atleast said something.

1097
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:44,715
 How could you? l didn't
 give you a chance to speak.

1098
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:48,886
 Look, now l understand why you
 sent food for my husband.

1099
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:53,857
 To save me from ridicule.

1100
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:57,161
 Listen, won't you talk
 to me? Are you angry?

1101
01:43:58,298 --> 01:43:59,999
 Look...

1102
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
 Your sister is begging
 you to forgive her.

1103
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:06,070
 Won't you forgive her?

1104
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,741
 - On one condition.
 - Agreed. Tell me.

1105
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:15,079
 You'll have to learn
 cooking in a week.

1106
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,584
 Within one week?

1107
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:21,585
 - But who will teach me?
 - l will. - You?

1108
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:24,257
 But can l learn?

1109
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,092
 Leave that to me.

1110
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:29,093
 lf you don't l'll continue sending
 food to brother-in-law.

1111
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:33,764
 And make him mine. Agreed?

1112
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:36,767
 Agreed.

1113
01:44:38,538 --> 01:44:41,374
 l have put all that
 you told me to.

1114
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:44,375
 lf it doesn't turn out well,
 it's not my fault.

1115
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,778
 Don't you worry, sister.
 lt will be delicious.

1116
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:52,783
 - Taste it.
 - You taste it.

1117
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:55,786
 - You taste it.
 - Okay. - lt's hot.

1118
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,198
 Not ''think'' you, it's ''thank'' you.

1119
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:09,199
 That is what l'm saying.

1120
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:13,203
 You know what the teacher
 will say when he returns?

1121
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:15,975
 He won't say anything, sister.

1122
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:18,077
 He'll take you straight
 to the bedroom.

1123
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:21,078
 Shameless! Naughty girl!

1124
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:33,157
 My brother!

1125
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:39,065
 Brother, are you okay?

1126
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:42,066
 Someone help my brother!

1127
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,838
 What can we do? lt
 is the child's fault.

1128
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:52,242
 The child's fault?
 lt is your fault.

1129
01:45:59,586 --> 01:46:02,321
 The child's leg is bleeding.
 Take him to the hospital.

1130
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:05,322
 Sir, please forgive us.

1131
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,960
 Were you driving? Couldn't
 you see the no-entry sign?

1132
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:09,862
 We are sorry, forgive us.

1133
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:12,031
 No way! You must come
 to the police station.

1134
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:14,867
 Don't get angry. lt's a
 small thing. We're sorry.

1135
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:17,703
 A small thing?
 He could've got killed.

1136
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:19,872
 His leg could've broken
 and you find it a minor thing?

1137
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:22,873
 Get down. l say, get down!

1138
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:46,096
 Move!

1139
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:49,633
 No!

1140
01:46:54,174 --> 01:46:57,174
 - Jaya, are you okay?
 - l'm fine, sir.

1141
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:06,917
 Take care.

1142
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:10,988
 Sir, they caused an accident
 and are fighting. Look.

1143
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,798
 Hey, what hooliganism is this?

1144
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:21,434
 - How did you enter a no-entry zone?
 - l told him.

1145
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:24,435
 ...l'm sorry. l even apologised.

1146
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:27,273
 What's inside?

1147
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:30,274
 Hey! What's inside?

1148
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:34,945
 - Mangoes
 - Mangoes?

1149
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:20,424
 - Get breakfast quickly.
 l'm very hungry - Coming.

1150
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:24,029
 What's taking you so long?
 What's cooking?

1151
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:25,998
 l have made lots of things.

1152
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:28,167
 Stuffed pancakees, a desert,
 lentil-curry, puris, omelettes.

1153
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,168
 - Wow!
 - This is not for you.

1154
01:48:32,005 --> 01:48:34,340
 Only omelette for me?
 And whom's the rest for?

1155
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:37,341
 - For my younger sister.
 - Your younger sister?

1156
01:48:37,677 --> 01:48:40,677
 When was she born?
 - The one who broke her head.

1157
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:44,014
 ...to save me that Jaya.

1158
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,851
 You eat, l'll go and serve her.

1159
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:55,895
 Do you see, grandma?

1160
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:58,896
 Gradually, that girl is
 getting friendly to my wife.

1161
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,901
 Now what do l do?

1162
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:04,902
 Give me some idea, grandma.

1163
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,206
 Don't think so much.

1164
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:10,207
 ln doing so, your grandson's
 house will be ruined.

1165
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:16,046
 Good morning, Mr. Ajay.

1166
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:18,217
 You look very handsome today.

1167
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:21,218
 What's the matter, Mr. Sharma?
 You sound good today.

1168
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:24,388
 Actually, my scooter's rear
 tyre is punctured.

1169
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:28,058
 - So l'll thought l'd go with...
 - Hold it!

1170
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:30,062
 Your rear tyre is punctured.

1171
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:32,731
 By only a woman can
 become my pillion.

1172
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:35,732
 Nevermind. l can become
 a woman for a lift.

1173
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:38,835
 Wait, l'll go and
 change into a sari.

1174
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:40,673
 l said a woman, not an eunuch.

1175
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:43,075
 - What do you mean?
 - l mean, Mr. Sharma,...

1176
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:46,076
 ...that only my wife
 can ride pillion with me.

1177
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:51,081
 - Why don't you take a bus?
 - Enough!

1178
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:54,084
 l'll make it somehow, but l
 don't need your calculations.

1179
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,090
 lf l spend a rupee,
 l can go comfortably...

1180
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,091
 ...in a bus, getting
 pushed by ten women.

1181
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:04,563
 - To hell with you!
 - Hey wait!

1182
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:07,433
 Take Jaya along. She is not well.

1183
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:10,102
 - Drop her at the hospital.
 - l'm already late.

1184
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:11,770
 She... she can take an auto.

1185
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,273
 Don't be silly. The
 hospital is enroute.

1186
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:15,808
 What difference will it
 make if you drop her?

1187
01:50:15,809 --> 01:50:18,809
 Where will she look
 for an auto? Sit down.

1188
01:50:20,013 --> 01:50:23,013
 Now don't look around.

1189
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:28,153
 Hold him properly or you'll fall.

1190
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:30,823
 - Sit properly.
 - l'm sitting properly.

1191
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:32,925
 Remove your hand from my waist.

1192
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:35,926
 How can l? What if l fall?

1193
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:39,131
 Stop! Stop!

1194
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:42,132
 l say, stop! Mr. Ajay!

1195
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:46,203
 ln this romantic pose..

1196
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:48,707
 - Whose is she?
 - Well... er... er...

1197
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:50,743
 Enough! Just answer my question.

1198
01:50:50,744 --> 01:50:53,744
 - Who is she?
 - Sir, don't you know me?

1199
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:57,514
 l know you, Jaya.
 But you don't know him.

1200
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:01,184
 - Do you know, what he
 just told me? - What?

1201
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:04,321
 That only his wife can become
 his pillion rider.

1202
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,961
 Really?

1203
01:51:08,962 --> 01:51:11,962
 And no one else.
 That is his principle.

1204
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:16,566
 Mr. Ajay, what about
 your principle now?

1205
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:18,804
 ls Jaya your wife?

1206
01:51:18,805 --> 01:51:21,805
 Or did you change your
 principle on seeing her?

1207
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:25,042
 - Why are you quiet, sir?
 Say something. - Shut up!

1208
01:51:25,178 --> 01:51:28,178
 - Look, Mr. Sharma.
 - Stop putting on an act!

1209
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,849
 l've got the answer.

1210
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,585
 Besides my calculation
 says the same thing.

1211
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:36,586
 Jaya, congratulations.

1212
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:34,911
 Go on.

1213
01:52:37,283 --> 01:52:40,283
 Rascal! l won't let you
 succeed in your mission.

1214
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:44,154
 l won't let a traitor like
 you ruin the country.

1215
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:31,334
 - Relieve the gate keeper
 - Okay, sir.

1216
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:56,328
 God knows, sir.
 What has the world come to?!

1217
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:59,329
 No one even thought that our
 country would see this day.

1218
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:02,332
 What's wrong, sir?
 Whose telegram is this?

1219
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:05,402
 Jaya's. Her father
 was in the military.

1220
01:54:06,339 --> 01:54:09,107
 ln trying to stop a terrorist,
 he has become a martyr.

1221
01:54:09,108 --> 01:54:11,510
 The 'High command' has said till
 this issue doesn't subside...

1222
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:14,511
 ...Jaya should be kept here.

1223
01:54:14,948 --> 01:54:16,782
 Where else will she go?

1224
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:19,783
 She had no one except her father.

1225
01:54:22,455 --> 01:54:25,455
 Hey! Shagun! My child!

1226
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:28,727
 l'm in a hurry. Send someone else
 to fetch betel leaves.

1227
01:54:28,728 --> 01:54:31,363
 l don't want betel leaves.

1228
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:34,364
 Tell me, is there an
 orphanage nearby?

1229
01:54:35,368 --> 01:54:38,368
 Why do you need an orphanage?

1230
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:40,372
 Why are you leaving
 your house and going?

1231
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:43,373
 Not for me. For Jaya.

1232
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:46,378
 Poor thing has become an orphan.

1233
01:54:46,379 --> 01:54:49,379
 When her father was alive
 the rent would come in regularly.

1234
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:53,383
 But from the time he expired
 so has my rent.

1235
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:59,489
 Hence my calculation says we
 should put her in an orphanage.

1236
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:03,128
 She will be happy with her likes.

1237
01:55:03,129 --> 01:55:06,129
 - What do you say?
 - My calculation says...

1238
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:09,733
 ...that you are worse than
 what l had thought.

1239
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:13,171
 Shut up and stand straight.

1240
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:16,172
 At this time, when
 she needs your help...

1241
01:55:16,576 --> 01:55:19,211
 ...you are throwing her out
 of your house for money?

1242
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:22,212
 Sending her to an
 orphanage? l'll pray.

1243
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,583
 ...that may you
 become an orphan soon.

1244
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:26,585
 Then l'll take you
 to an orphanage...

1245
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:29,586
 l'll drag you there, beating
 you up like a dog!

1246
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:34,291
 l won't spare you.
 l'll make an orphan out of you!

1247
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:39,831
 Jaya is going to some orphanage.

1248
01:55:39,832 --> 01:55:42,434
 Why isn't she going to
 the one you came from?

1249
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:45,435
 You know them and they'll
 look after her too.

1250
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:49,439
 Don't you have a heart?

1251
01:55:49,509 --> 01:55:52,509
 She's a girl who has lived all
 her life like a princess.

1252
01:55:52,845 --> 01:55:55,447
 Suddenly after father's death
 she bacame an orphan...

1253
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:58,448
 She's being sent to an orphanage
 and you are least concerned?

1254
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:03,155
 Why should we take other
 people's responsibility?

1255
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:05,857
 Don't be silly.
 She is like my sister.

1256
01:56:05,858 --> 01:56:08,858
 Meaning your sister-in-law.
 You are her teacher, too.

1257
01:56:09,128 --> 01:56:12,128
 What could be a better
 place than our house?

1258
01:56:13,066 --> 01:56:16,066
 ln our house? A young
 and unmarried girl?

1259
01:56:17,236 --> 01:56:20,236
 Sister, l don't want
 to trouble anyone.

1260
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:23,642
 Did you hear? She too
 doesn't like the idea.

1261
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:26,643
 That's my problem. You tell me
 do you have any objection?

1262
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,480
 Even if l do, l'm helpless.
 l'll have to give reasons.

1263
01:56:31,818 --> 01:56:34,818
 She's most welcome.

1264
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:40,490
 Did you hear what he said?
 Come on in.

1265
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:45,395
 lf you throw it like this,
 it will get more spoilt.

1266
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:48,500
 lt's my bad luck.
 With great desire...

1267
01:56:48,501 --> 01:56:51,069
 l had got this cassette.
 Though l'd hear it all night...

1268
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:53,105
 ...this cassette player
 doesn't seem to work properly.

1269
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:55,507
 l won't give up even if
 l have to sit up all night.

1270
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,509
 l'll repair it and
 listen to the song.

1271
01:56:57,510 --> 01:57:00,510
 Why? Do you only want to
 listen to this cassette.

1272
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,280
 Won't it do if l sing?

1273
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:10,020
 What am l hearing?
 You know to sing?!

1274
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:13,323
 Ofcourse.
 You thought l was a no good?

1275
01:57:13,526 --> 01:57:16,261
 When we had special guests
 coming over to the ashram...

1276
01:57:16,262 --> 01:57:19,262
 - l was always asked to sing.
 - Really?

1277
01:57:19,732 --> 01:57:22,732
 Why didn't you tell me
 on the wedding night?

1278
01:57:23,536 --> 01:57:26,536
 You didn't ask me...
 so how could l say?

1279
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:30,540
 Now that l know,
 sing a beautiful song.

1280
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:35,447
 - Shall l?
 - Of course.

1281
01:57:35,448 --> 01:57:38,448
 Very well.

1282
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:42,120
 What happened?

1283
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:45,121
 - The door is open
 - So what? Never mind.

1284
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:49,559
 Jaya is outside. l only
 want you to hear my song.

1285
01:57:50,463 --> 01:57:53,463
 That is fine.
 l'll lock the door and come.

1286
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:05,575
 - Now go ahead and sing.
 - No.

1287
01:58:05,578 --> 01:58:08,578
 - l'm feeling shy.
 - Of whom?

1288
01:58:09,582 --> 01:58:11,083
 You.

1289
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:14,084
 You feel shy in singing a song...
 how about other things?

1290
01:58:15,988 --> 01:58:18,988
 No. lf you look at me,
 l won't be able to sing.

1291
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,594
 Turn around and sit.

1292
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:25,595
 Then how will l see you singing?

1293
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:28,598
 You don't see a song, you hear it.

1294
01:58:28,601 --> 01:58:31,601
 - Turn around.
 - Okay.

1295
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:35,939
 Okay.

1296
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:11,407
 What happened?
 Didn't you like my song?

1297
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,646
 For God sake,
 go to sleep Saraswati.

1298
01:59:14,647 --> 01:59:17,647
 l can't hear your sad song.

1299
01:59:24,123 --> 01:59:27,123
 When l sang at the orphanage
 everybody always praised me.

1300
01:59:29,295 --> 01:59:32,295
 But last night, he went
 to sleep on hearing it.

1301
01:59:32,532 --> 01:59:34,699
 Probably he must be very sleepy.

1302
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:37,700
 No, he didn't speak
 to me this morning.

1303
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:41,072
 You hear my song.

1304
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:43,675
 Tell me honestly how it is.

1305
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,676
 Hold this.

1306
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:15,707
 Sister, your voice is good.

1307
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:18,109
 But your song is horrible.

1308
02:00:18,110 --> 02:00:21,110
 Nevermind. Just as
 l taught you to cook...

1309
02:00:21,113 --> 02:00:24,113
 ...similarly, l'll teach
 you to sing in a week.

1310
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:27,617
 Really?

1311
02:00:55,147 --> 02:00:58,147
 What happened?
 Continue singing.

1312
02:05:49,341 --> 02:05:52,341
 Hey Saraswati! Where are you?

1313
02:05:53,846 --> 02:05:56,846
 Come in and scrub my back.
 l can't reach it.

1314
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:03,054
 Hey, Saraswati!

1315
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:06,055
 Come soon!

1316
02:06:07,293 --> 02:06:09,561
 Here you are.

1317
02:06:09,562 --> 02:06:12,562
 Why are you waiting?
 Scrub my back.

1318
02:06:21,073 --> 02:06:23,474
 What are you doing?
 lt's a detergent.

1319
02:06:23,475 --> 02:06:26,077
 Will you scrape my back?

1320
02:06:26,078 --> 02:06:29,078
 Use this.

1321
02:06:34,853 --> 02:06:37,853
 Your touch has passed a
 tremor through my spine.

1322
02:06:40,893 --> 02:06:43,893
 On the first night,
 l was in a hurry.

1323
02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:48,097
 But don't worry. l've a
 holiday on Sunday. So...

1324
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:52,503
 But, Saraswati...

1325
02:06:52,504 --> 02:06:55,504
 Ever since Jaya has come
 l don't enjoy my holidays.

1326
02:06:56,542 --> 02:06:59,542
 Can't you send her out for
 2-3 hours next Sunday?

1327
02:07:02,815 --> 02:07:05,815
 Saraswati, why are you
 quiet? What happened?

1328
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:09,120
 Come on.

1329
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:12,121
 Come.

1330
02:07:12,124 --> 02:07:15,124
 Come.

1331
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:24,969
 With whose permission have you
 come into the bathroom?

1332
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:27,970
 And how dare you rub soap
 on my back?

1333
02:07:27,973 --> 02:07:30,973
 lf l still keep quiet,
 you'll land me in trouble.

1334
02:07:32,277 --> 02:07:35,277
 l did it unknowingly, sir.

1335
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:37,248
 Forgive me.

1336
02:07:37,249 --> 02:07:40,249
 No, you did it intentionally.

1337
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:43,619
 Come what may, l'll
 tell my wife everything.

1338
02:07:44,323 --> 02:07:47,323
 - Okay, tell your wife
 l'll tell my sister. - You!

1339
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,296
 What?

1340
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:55,166
 That when you were away?

1341
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:58,167
 ''The teacher called me
 in the bathroom.''

1342
02:07:58,704 --> 02:08:01,172
 ''He thrust a soap in
 my hand and said...''

1343
02:08:01,173 --> 02:08:04,173
 ''Rub it on my back''

1344
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:07,178
 ''No sooner had l started
 rubbing it...''

1345
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:10,179
 ''He held my hand and kissed it''

1346
02:08:10,349 --> 02:08:13,349
 l kissed it thinking it
 to be Saraswati's hand.

1347
02:08:15,187 --> 02:08:18,187
 You couldn't differentiate
 between her hand and mine?

1348
02:08:21,193 --> 02:08:23,261
 Why are you sweating?

1349
02:08:23,262 --> 02:08:25,930
 lt's not sweat, but water.
 l've just had a bath.

1350
02:08:25,931 --> 02:08:28,931
 Okay, l'll do as you say.

1351
02:08:29,868 --> 02:08:31,969
 What did l say, sir?

1352
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:34,970
 That you did it unintentionally
 and l should forgive you.

1353
02:08:35,274 --> 02:08:37,208
 l have forgiven you but...

1354
02:08:37,209 --> 02:08:40,209
 ...this should be a secret
 between the two of us.

1355
02:08:41,547 --> 02:08:44,547
 Mr. Ajay, not two but three.

1356
02:08:44,817 --> 02:08:46,217
 Don't you worry...

1357
02:08:46,218 --> 02:08:49,218
 this soap's calculation will
 be between the three of us.

1358
02:08:50,122 --> 02:08:53,122
 l won't tell anyone anything.
 Okay?

1359
02:08:56,061 --> 02:08:57,962
 Start!

1360
02:08:57,963 --> 02:09:00,963
 Today l'll teach you opposites.

1361
02:09:05,137 --> 02:09:08,137
 - Ugly
 - Behind.

1362
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,674
 Behind!

1363
02:09:09,675 --> 02:09:11,576
 Behind!

1364
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:14,577
 Answer properly. What
 is a head made for?

1365
02:09:15,247 --> 02:09:17,682
 - To get beaten.
 - What is the eye made for?

1366
02:09:17,683 --> 02:09:20,017
 - To wink.
 - A mouth?

1367
02:09:20,018 --> 02:09:23,018
 - To eat ill-gotten stuff.
 - A finger? - Finger?

1368
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:27,058
 l can't say in front of everybody.

1369
02:09:27,059 --> 02:09:30,059
 Your lesson is over and
 my love lesson starts.

1370
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:39,137
 He's here!

1371
02:09:39,138 --> 02:09:42,138
 l have come, darling.

1372
02:09:52,284 --> 02:09:55,284
 What's this?
 You have come so early?

1373
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:02,625
 These flowers and these sweets.

1374
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:08,065
 What happened?

1375
02:10:08,066 --> 02:10:11,066
 Your monthly blues are over;
 now what's your problem?

1376
02:10:12,304 --> 02:10:15,206
 l'm observing a fast today.

1377
02:10:15,207 --> 02:10:18,207
 - Then what was yesterday?
 - That was for the Goddess.

1378
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:21,310
 - And the day before?
 - For Goddess Santoshi.

1379
02:10:21,313 --> 02:10:23,181
 There are seven days in a week.

1380
02:10:23,182 --> 02:10:26,050
 ...and you observe fast
 on all seven days!

1381
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:29,051
 l came home early
 with great hopes...

1382
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:32,321
 - ...and you ruined everything.
 - Don't get so annoyed.

1383
02:10:32,324 --> 02:10:35,324
 l'm not running away.
 Get it tomorrow.

1384
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:38,796
 l won't observe any fast tomorrow.

1385
02:10:38,797 --> 02:10:41,797
 l'm talking about today!
 What do l do today?

1386
02:10:42,334 --> 02:10:44,335
 What do l do with these
 sweets and flowers?

1387
02:10:44,336 --> 02:10:47,336
 Go and throw them!

1388
02:10:56,348 --> 02:10:59,348
 Why are you throwing
 those flowers and sweets?

1389
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:02,751
 Give it to me. l have
 not observed any fast.

1390
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:17,700
 Get some water please.

1391
02:11:30,716 --> 02:11:33,716
 Saraswati, get the
 cough-syrup, please.

1392
02:11:43,395 --> 02:11:46,395
 Snake! Snake!

1393
02:11:46,398 --> 02:11:49,398
 Snake!

1394
02:11:52,771 --> 02:11:55,771
 What happened?
 Where's the snake?

1395
02:11:56,475 --> 02:11:59,475
 There's no snake. l was lying.

1396
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:01,012
 Listen!

1397
02:12:01,013 --> 02:12:04,013
 The truth is...
 l can't sleep here all alone.

1398
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:09,654
 l'm getting very scared.

1399
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:12,655
 l told you... not today.

1400
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:31,081
 l want to meet you in private.

1401
02:16:31,082 --> 02:16:34,082
 Tomorrow, outside the school
 compound. At three.

1402
02:16:49,301 --> 02:16:51,635
 - Captain, this is Bhola here.
 - Yes.

1403
02:16:51,636 --> 02:16:53,404
 Chote's condition is very bad.

1404
02:16:53,405 --> 02:16:55,706
 lt's difficult to get him
 out of here.

1405
02:16:55,707 --> 02:16:57,708
 But l have found out
 two things first.

1406
02:16:57,709 --> 02:17:00,244
 Your brother has been
 arrested because of...

1407
02:17:00,245 --> 02:17:03,245
 ...Ajay Saxena the teacher
 of S.T. school Roopnagar.

1408
02:17:04,616 --> 02:17:07,616
 And second, the nuclear bomb.

1409
02:17:08,753 --> 02:17:11,753
 Yes, go on...

1410
02:17:23,602 --> 02:17:25,736
 You are also a woman, Jaya.

1411
02:17:25,737 --> 02:17:28,737
 Aren't you ashamed of ruining
 another woman's life?

1412
02:17:29,074 --> 02:17:30,908
 And specially of that woman...

1413
02:17:30,909 --> 02:17:33,909
 ...who considers you as
 her younger sister?

1414
02:17:34,012 --> 02:17:37,012
 Just think Jaya. Just think.

1415
02:17:37,148 --> 02:17:40,148
 lf she learns about you
 how hurt she will be.

1416
02:17:43,154 --> 02:17:46,154
 lf you have love for her
 and respect for me...

1417
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:51,760
 ...then l beseech you, please
 go away from our lives.

1418
02:17:53,632 --> 02:17:56,632
 Give any excuse to Saraswati,
 but just go away!

1419
02:17:57,836 --> 02:17:59,770
 All right!

1420
02:17:59,771 --> 02:18:02,771
 lt is true that l wanted
 to marry you.

1421
02:18:03,775 --> 02:18:06,110
 But this is also true...

1422
02:18:06,111 --> 02:18:09,111
 ...that the day you
 married sister...

1423
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:13,115
 ...l decided to go away
 from your life.

1424
02:18:15,787 --> 02:18:18,489
 And had l not met sister...

1425
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:21,458
 ...perhaps l would have
 gone away by now.

1426
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:24,459
 But after meeting, l learnt...

1427
02:18:24,796 --> 02:18:27,796
 ...that because of me, you've
 married such a woman in haste.

1428
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:31,800
 Who is not worthy
 of you completely.

1429
02:18:32,237 --> 02:18:35,237
 Your wife can't cook, can't sing,
 can't even read or write.

1430
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:41,810
 On hearing all this,
 l was very hurt.

1431
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:45,147
 l started feeling guilty.

1432
02:18:47,252 --> 02:18:50,220
 That day l decided...

1433
02:18:50,221 --> 02:18:53,157
 ...that l'd teach
 your wife everything.

1434
02:18:53,158 --> 02:18:56,158
 Make her worthy of you...

1435
02:18:56,995 --> 02:18:59,995
 ...and go away from
 your lives forever.

1436
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
 Jaya, what are you saying?

1437
02:19:07,839 --> 02:19:10,507
 l always fool with you...

1438
02:19:10,508 --> 02:19:13,508
 Perhaps that's why you aren't
 taking me seriously today.

1439
02:19:14,112 --> 02:19:17,112
 But it is the truth...
 the absolute truth.

1440
02:19:18,183 --> 02:19:21,183
 l've finished my work.

1441
02:19:21,186 --> 02:19:24,186
 And today... l'm going
 away from you too.

1442
02:20:05,897 --> 02:20:08,031
 What's happening?

1443
02:20:08,032 --> 02:20:11,032
 l think the matter is serious.

1444
02:20:50,408 --> 02:20:53,408
 - Are you Ajay Saxena?
 - Yes.

1445
02:20:53,678 --> 02:20:56,246
 lt's you l wanted to meet.

1446
02:20:56,247 --> 02:20:58,115
 You must recall...

1447
02:20:58,116 --> 02:21:01,116
 Some time ago you had got
 a terrorist arrested.

1448
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:05,589
 l'm his elder brother.

1449
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:08,590
 We have met before.

1450
02:21:08,893 --> 02:21:11,361
 ln the market.

1451
02:21:11,362 --> 02:21:14,362
 A child was run over
 by my truck.

1452
02:21:14,732 --> 02:21:16,967
 Remember?

1453
02:21:16,968 --> 02:21:19,968
 You are the first person
 who dared to hold me.

1454
02:21:20,572 --> 02:21:23,572
 Because of you, our years
 of effort have gone in vain.

1455
02:21:24,976 --> 02:21:27,976
 You're the first person
 who has hindered our aim.

1456
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:31,980
 On account of you my brother
 is in our rivals' custody.

1457
02:21:36,054 --> 02:21:39,054
 You have caused us untold losses!

1458
02:21:59,744 --> 02:22:02,744
 Leave the teacher alone!
 Don't hit him!

1459
02:22:40,451 --> 02:22:41,952
 Bastard!

1460
02:22:41,953 --> 02:22:43,654
 You killed my student?!

1461
02:22:43,655 --> 02:22:46,655
 You should have killed me
 if you wanted to!!

1462
02:22:50,094 --> 02:22:53,094
 Sit down, you swine!

1463
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:35,539
 Principal.

1464
02:23:35,540 --> 02:23:38,540
 Go tell the minister.

1465
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:42,110
 lf my brother is not brought
 here safely by 12 noon.

1466
02:23:43,681 --> 02:23:46,681
 Then after every one hour...

1467
02:23:47,318 --> 02:23:50,220
 ...one student will be killed.

1468
02:23:50,221 --> 02:23:53,123
 Like this.

1469
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:55,525
 lt's not necessary
 to tell you that...

1470
02:23:55,526 --> 02:23:58,526
 ...life holds no importance
 for us terrorists.

1471
02:23:58,663 --> 02:24:01,663
 He can send an army
 to attack us.

1472
02:24:02,133 --> 02:24:05,133
 lf l press this button
 while dying...

1473
02:24:05,303 --> 02:24:08,303
 ...then everybody gets crushed
 under this magnificent building.

1474
02:24:09,874 --> 02:24:12,874
 Do you understand, Principal?

1475
02:24:23,488 --> 02:24:25,622
 When you were in school,
 perhaps your principal...

1476
02:24:25,623 --> 02:24:28,325
 ...must not have taught you...

1477
02:24:28,326 --> 02:24:31,326
 ...that a sun always sets
 after it rises.

1478
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:34,396
 Every living being comes to an end.

1479
02:24:35,166 --> 02:24:38,166
 Yeah, some innocent beings do die
 young and so do tyrants!

1480
02:24:43,875 --> 02:24:46,176
 No! Nothing can happen
 to my husband!

1481
02:24:46,177 --> 02:24:48,378
 Ajay's life can not be in danger!

1482
02:24:48,379 --> 02:24:51,379
 lf anything happens to him l will
 die here at Your doorstep!

1483
02:24:53,951 --> 02:24:55,986
 The government is
 doing its best.

1484
02:24:55,987 --> 02:24:58,987
 What government!
 ls this any government?!

1485
02:25:00,191 --> 02:25:02,359
 The poor ones look upon
 you as their care taker...

1486
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:04,361
 ...is this how a
 caretaker should be?

1487
02:25:04,362 --> 02:25:06,530
 Other people's children
 are in the jaws of death...

1488
02:25:06,531 --> 02:25:09,199
 ...and you are doing
 nothing about it?...

1489
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:11,201
 - Dear, listen...
 - No, principal.

1490
02:25:11,202 --> 02:25:13,637
 ...now l don't want
 to hear anything.

1491
02:25:13,638 --> 02:25:16,638
 l only want my Ajay.
 My sister Jaya.

1492
02:25:17,675 --> 02:25:19,710
 And l don't want to hear anything.

1493
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:21,978
 lf anything happens to
 them, then just watch.

1494
02:25:21,979 --> 02:25:24,979
 - lt will be too bad.
 - Dear, Dear! Listen!

1495
02:25:25,817 --> 02:25:28,785
 Does Ajay mean everything
 to you alone?

1496
02:25:28,786 --> 02:25:31,588
 Not me?

1497
02:25:31,589 --> 02:25:34,589
 He is my student and my son too.

1498
02:25:37,228 --> 02:25:40,228
 lt's a double loss to me.

1499
02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:43,231
 Have courage. Come on.

1500
02:25:50,408 --> 02:25:53,408
 What just happened now is the
 sound of the impending storm.

1501
02:25:55,747 --> 02:25:57,748
 Now only one girl
 has grilled you...

1502
02:25:57,749 --> 02:26:00,749
 Soon those children's parents will
 start hurling uestions at you!

1503
02:26:02,587 --> 02:26:04,988
 Do something, sir. Do something.

1504
02:26:04,989 --> 02:26:07,791
 l don't know what to do.

1505
02:26:07,792 --> 02:26:09,593
 ln-lieu of those childrens lives...

1506
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:11,328
 ...he is demanding the
 release of his brother.

1507
02:26:11,329 --> 02:26:13,463
 Then do it. On earlier
 instances too you have...

1508
02:26:13,464 --> 02:26:15,599
 ...given in to the terrorist's
 demands to save...

1509
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:18,268
 ...the lives of innocent lives.
 Then why hesitate now?

1510
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:21,269
 Why don't you understand?
 They have a nuclear bomb.

1511
02:26:38,723 --> 02:26:41,691
 Where have you kept
 the nuclear bomb?

1512
02:26:41,692 --> 02:26:44,561
 Tell me!

1513
02:26:44,562 --> 02:26:47,562
 Even your angels will speak!
 lmmerse him!

1514
02:26:53,437 --> 02:26:56,306
 Speak!

1515
02:26:56,307 --> 02:26:59,307
 - You won't speak?
 - No!

1516
02:27:04,315 --> 02:27:07,315
 No! No!

1517
02:28:40,912 --> 02:28:43,013
 Sir, Ajay here.

1518
02:28:43,014 --> 02:28:46,014
 Listen!

1519
02:28:46,417 --> 02:28:49,417
 - lt's me.
 - What have you decided?

1520
02:28:50,121 --> 02:28:53,121
 What have you thought
 about the children?

1521
02:28:54,091 --> 02:28:55,792
 Are you releasing
 his brother or not?

1522
02:28:55,793 --> 02:28:57,694
 Ajay, listen to me first.

1523
02:28:57,695 --> 02:29:00,695
 His brother is dead.

1524
02:29:01,565 --> 02:29:04,267
 Sir, if the captain
 learns about it...

1525
02:29:04,268 --> 02:29:07,268
 ...what about these children?
 Who will save them?

1526
02:29:10,474 --> 02:29:12,642
 ln this world,
 the teacher's name...

1527
02:29:12,643 --> 02:29:15,445
 ...is taken before the names
 of parents and the Lord.

1528
02:29:15,446 --> 02:29:18,446
 And a teacher's position in this world
 is higher than that of anyone!

1529
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:22,617
 And today you have to prove that
 you are not only their teacher...

1530
02:29:23,854 --> 02:29:26,854
 ...but also their
 mother and father.

1531
02:29:34,899 --> 02:29:37,899
 What happened? What did he say?

1532
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:42,470
 - To play mischief.
 - Mischief?

1533
02:29:42,473 --> 02:29:44,140
 Yes, Ajay.

1534
02:29:44,141 --> 02:29:47,141
 But in my style.

1535
02:29:47,812 --> 02:29:50,812
 What happened, Jaya?

1536
02:29:51,182 --> 02:29:54,182
 What's wrong with her?

1537
02:30:07,698 --> 02:30:09,899
 A girl's health has
 suddenly got spoilt.

1538
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:12,900
 Everybody has surrounded
 her, hurry up.

1539
02:30:21,579 --> 02:30:24,579
 Look!

1540
02:30:28,519 --> 02:30:30,420
 She has got a severe
 attack of asthma.

1541
02:30:30,421 --> 02:30:32,689
 She should be rushed
 to the hospital.

1542
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:35,690
 She is an asthmatic patient;
 check her school records.

1543
02:30:51,542 --> 02:30:54,542
 Slowly. Not that! Listen to me.

1544
02:30:54,578 --> 02:30:57,347
 That antenna! Yes, from there.

1545
02:30:57,348 --> 02:30:59,282
 That gray one. Yes, open the box.

1546
02:30:59,283 --> 02:31:02,283
 - What do l do?
 - Open it carefully.

1547
02:31:02,553 --> 02:31:05,553
 Carefully. Slowly.

1548
02:31:06,123 --> 02:31:07,257
 Now?

1549
02:31:07,258 --> 02:31:09,726
 Now get that radio from there.

1550
02:31:09,727 --> 02:31:12,727
 Now?

1551
02:31:24,675 --> 02:31:27,675
 Remove the blue chip
 from the radio.

1552
02:31:32,683 --> 02:31:35,185
 Put the red chip from
 the box in the radio.

1553
02:31:35,186 --> 02:31:38,186
 From this?

1554
02:31:39,256 --> 02:31:41,658
 Wait! No! The blue one.

1555
02:31:41,659 --> 02:31:43,927
 Yes! The red one.

1556
02:31:43,928 --> 02:31:46,928
 Put the red one in the
 radio and blue in the box.

1557
02:31:59,977 --> 02:32:01,611
 Now...

1558
02:32:01,612 --> 02:32:04,612
 ...l'm much better.

1559
02:32:05,516 --> 02:32:08,516
 Thank God!

1560
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:12,220
 Get up.

1561
02:32:51,228 --> 02:32:54,228
 Quick!

1562
02:33:05,543 --> 02:33:08,543
 My calculation says the children
 have taken charge now!

1563
02:35:20,144 --> 02:35:22,812
 This rascal is too heavy.

1564
02:35:22,813 --> 02:35:25,813
 Come in the bathroom. Come on.

1565
02:38:01,371 --> 02:38:04,371
 No! No!

1566
02:39:11,041 --> 02:39:14,041
 - Jaya! Are you okay?
 - Yeah.

1567
02:39:23,253 --> 02:39:25,054
 - Are you okay?
 - Yeah.

1568
02:39:25,055 --> 02:39:28,055
 Thank God. You are okay.

1569
02:39:37,968 --> 02:39:40,069
 You lied to me, Jaya.

1570
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:43,070
 You lied to me
 that you are okay.

1571
02:39:43,073 --> 02:39:46,073
 Yes, sir.
 Nothing is wrong with me.

1572
02:39:48,078 --> 02:39:51,078
 l am not going away from you.

1573
02:39:51,181 --> 02:39:54,181
 l will always be with you.

1574
02:39:55,085 --> 02:39:58,085
 Present in the form of a favour
 while sister cooks.

1575
02:40:03,427 --> 02:40:06,427
 When she sings a song
 l will be there...

1576
02:40:09,099 --> 02:40:12,099
 ...like the melody of her song.

1577
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:16,270
 Whenever she writes something...

1578
02:40:17,007 --> 02:40:20,007
 You will see me in her letters.

1579
02:40:21,111 --> 02:40:24,111
 My sister.

1580
02:40:24,114 --> 02:40:26,282
 Listen...

1581
02:40:26,283 --> 02:40:29,283
 ...tie this wedding chain
 around her neck.

1582
02:40:29,519 --> 02:40:32,519
 - What is this, Saraswati?
 - What do you think...

1583
02:40:33,123 --> 02:40:36,123
 ...l don't know anything?

1584
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:39,560
 While cleaning her bed when
 l found this wedding chain...

1585
02:40:42,299 --> 02:40:45,299
 l understood everything.

1586
02:40:45,535 --> 02:40:48,535
 Today, if you don't
 fulfill her wish...

1587
02:40:48,572 --> 02:40:51,140
 ...her soul will
 never rest in peace.

1588
02:40:51,141 --> 02:40:54,141
 - Please.
 - No, sister.

1589
02:40:54,678 --> 02:40:57,678
 A person dies
 but not his soul.

1590
02:41:01,151 --> 02:41:04,151
 And that soul has so much power...

1591
02:41:05,155 --> 02:41:08,155
 ...that it can choose the
 womb it likes to be born in.

1592
02:41:12,229 --> 02:41:15,229
 Very soon, l will
 come to your house, sir.

1593
02:41:17,067 --> 02:41:20,067
 Very soon, l will
 come to your house, sir.
