The Air Force officer should
be at the military hospital

61
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,600
An emergency

62
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,440
Should we treat him here or not?

63
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,840
What shall we do?

64
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,200
- We should ask the duty doctor
- My dear, you're the duty doctor

65
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,760
He should be at the military hospital

66
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,880
His vitals haven't stabilised,
he can't be shifted

67
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,600
Check his BP! Start a lifeline

68
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,840

could be a concussion

77
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,360
Can you hear me?

78
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Doctor!

79
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,200
The duty nurse will be here soon
Go home and rest

80
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll stay! The next 24 hours
are critical

81
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,360
Okay

82
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,800
You didn't sign up for this, right?

83
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,920

from Delhi

87
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,600
I joined yesterday

88
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
But I already
feel like running away

89
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,920
Not a good idea
Oxygen is in short supply

90
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,880
I know it's a bad joke
You don't have to laugh

91
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
Excuse me, doctor

92
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,120
Officer VC Can you hear me?

93
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,760
Can you hear me?

94
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,520
Can you open your mouth?

95
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,000
Very good

96
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Can I see your tongue?

97
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,840
Very good

98
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,880
Take a deep breath

99
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,680
No lung puncture

100
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
Can you try and sit up?

101
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Remove the oxygen

102
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
Very good officer

103
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,200
You're much better now

104
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,960
Rest a little and you'll be
as good as new

105
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,960
Okay?

106
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,640
He's conscious now

107
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
Can I move him to the
military hospital?

108
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
No, doctor

109
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,920
He isn't fully recovered

110
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm afraid my seniors
have to clear him

111
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Once he's conscious and can
walk without help...

112
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,440
...then move him

113
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,360
Careful he doesn't hurt
his head again

114
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
So you've taken full control
on your first day?

115
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,640
I'll only get worse

116
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,040
You have a funny bone too!

117
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
Doctor

118
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,880
- Thank you
- Thank you doctor

119
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
Bye

120
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
- Who is it?
- Leela

121
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,680
No one's at home

122
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
I had an emergency
at the hospital

123
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,360
I said there's no one at home

124
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,320
It's your favourite granddaughter

125
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,520
Colonel, open the door

126
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
It's freezing

127
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,520
What did you expect in Srinagar?

128
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm going to live here
Welcome me like a queen

129
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
The door's been open since last night
And I've been waiting

130
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,600
Grandpa! Forgotten me, have you?

131
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,160
You smell of hospital
Go, shower

132
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,640
Better than smelling of old rum

133
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,760
VC...

134
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
Look, you have a guest

135
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,360
- Varun, did my father come to see you?
- Speak softly

136
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,520
This is a hospital

137
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
There are elderly patients

138
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,960
What did you tell my father?

139
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,280
He's sending me to Pune

140
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,400
Sorry

141
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,600
'I saw your face
in the wide ocean'

142
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
Careful

143
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,160
'I saw your face in the bright
blue sky'

144
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
VC Quoting Bharati in Kashmir?

145
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,880
How could you do this to me?

146
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
You told him it's best for me?

147
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
'I saw your face in the sea's
churning foam'

148
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,440
You can't take the drip out

149
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
'In every small bubble,
I saw your face'

150
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Sorry

151
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
You can't leave without
being discharged

152
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,000
You were never serious about me,
were you?

153
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,080
I was just a pastime for you

154
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,200
'I watched the clouds so keenly'

155
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,520
You're selfish, self-centered
Arrogant

156
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Who, me? Serious accusations

157
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,440
'I watched the clouds'

158
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,120
I don't know the next verse

159
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
Where to, sir?

160
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,080
'I found your face
and nothing else'

161
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
- Where is he going?
- To the bathroom

162
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,640
There's a patient
who needs a bed pan

163
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,760
Go, help him

164
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Good morning, sir

165
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,800
How can we let you fly
with that sling?

166
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,920
No sling, sir

167
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
Only a bandage

168
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes sir

169
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I'll be fit to fly in a week, sir

170
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,840
- VC, do me a favour
- Yes, sir?

171
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,160
Don't butcher Telugu

172
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
Yes sir, will ensure that (in Telugu)

173
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,160
- How did this happen?
- Brake failure, sir

174
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,040
Yes, sir
Brake failure

175
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,200
The belt snapped

176
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,320
And the jeep went into a tailspin

177
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
I went down..

178
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
VC, no Telugu, okay?

179
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Okay sir

180
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,600
How did Brig Kapoor's daughter
get into your jeep?

181
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,040
No, sir

182
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,840
Brig Kapoor's daughter was not
in the jeep

183
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
Lucky for you

184
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,680
That she was not in your jeep

185
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,560
Right sir

186
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,400
Not in the jeep, sir

187
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
The Brigadier asked me

188
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,240
Can you trust him with a fighter plane
when he can't drive a jeep?

189
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,600
I said

190
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,640
You can't handle your daughter

191
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,000
How will you handle
a battalion?

192
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,720
Now at the..

193
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
Don't laugh...Dismissed

194
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
Good one sir

195
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,160
Hi, I'm Dr Nidhi

196
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
The one who left you stranded here
for two days

197
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,800
So good to hear Tamil

198
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
But where's the patient?

199
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,600
Dr Ilyas moved him to the
military hospital last night

200
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,960
Dr Ilyas

201
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,360
How could you move VC
without our permission?

202
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
An IAF officer shouldn't have
been there in the first place

203
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,280
But he was

204
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,120
So?

205
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,200
He's our responsibility, doctor

206
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
No, he's my responsibility

207
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
You shouldn't have moved him
It could've been a head injury

208
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,560
With severe blood loss, he was
under observation

209
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,040
How could you sneak him away?

210
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,120
He's an Air Force officer,
he flew away

211
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,760
So, can't I see the patient now?

212
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,640
Ilyas, you were wrong

213
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Agreed

214
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,160
But try telling VC

215
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,400
All I can do is to buy you a coffee
Or invite you to the Air Force ball

216
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,280
Next weekend! You might see
VC there

217
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,960
Maybe that will cool the angry
young doctor

218
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
He was my first patient

219
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,960
My enthusiasm and concern
came out as anger

220
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,080
I am very sorry, doctor

221
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,280
Your first patient

222
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,960
Happily dancing away

223
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
Dr Leela

224
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,160
Didn't thank Dr Leela

225
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,360
Slipped out of the hospital

226
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
Need another chance
to thank you right

227
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,840
Rendez-vous at 10,000 ft
over Srinagar?

228
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,760
No civilians on an IAF plane, sorry
Private aircraft maybe?

229
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,920
A Himalayan joyride?

230
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
This isn't going to work

231
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,560
Why not?

232
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,920
Officer, that's a lot of flirting
after a simple hello

233
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,080
So much?

234
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,920
Is it my dancing, flirting or me?
What don't you like?

235
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
Who says I don't?

236
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,920
But save your breath

237
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
It won't work

238
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,120
My heart seems to say otherwise

239
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,280
I'm a doctor
Trust me, hearts don't talk

240
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,440
What would convince Dr Leela?

241
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,120
Across seven seas, seven hills apart,
seven years later

242
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,520
if the heart feels the same,
then maybe

243
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,800
Tall order!

244
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,240
If you change your mind

245
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
No, thanks

246
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,280
If you have a change of heart,
next Saturday, 5pm

247
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,560
Date in flight

248
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
Is the officer hard of hearing?

249
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,560
Won't the doctor have
a change of heart?

250
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,000
Hello

251
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,760
Hello

252
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm on duty

253
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,760
A head injury! Two cardiac cases,
an acute appendicitis

254
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,320
You startled me

255
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,600
No work today?

256
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
No sortie?

257
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,080
In half an hour

258
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,280
I wanted to see the doctor
who stood me up

259
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,040
So long

260
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
Wait! I'll come with you

261
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,400
I thought I'd watch
fighter planes take off

262
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,040
Ravi was part of my unit
Did you know that?

263
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,320
My brother spoke of you
in his letters

264
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,960
Only good things I hope

265
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,120
He said you sing well

266
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,760
- Like Ghantasala
- That's true

267
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,840
Excuse me

268
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
How far is the Flying Club?

269
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,440
Big mistake, my girl

270
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,560
Just to catch a glance
of the plane

271
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
- From the outside?
- Absolutely

272
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,360
I shouldn't encourage this
Anyway hold tight

273
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,800
Hold this

274
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,720
Come

275
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,960
Come...come...come

276
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,480
This is for you

277
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,280
You must put on
your seat belt

278
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,960
I knew this would happen

279
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
What?

280
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,720
VC would take me over
the Himalayas

281
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,040
You knew?

282
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,760
Fate, serendipity, destiny
Do you believe in them?

283
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,960
Fighter pilots have one faith

284
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,080
The self

285
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,160
God is a fighter pilot, too

286
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,760
Ravi's words, exactly

287
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,920
Who's this Ravi?
Is he competing with me?

288
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,400
He spoke about you
in his all letters

289
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
Ravi Abraham?
Is he your brother?

290
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
I'm Leela Abraham, right?

291
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,360
And so

292
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
You're Ravi's sister?

293
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,080
You're Ravi Abraham's sister?

294
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
Show me that smile

295
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
- What?
- Smile

296
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,080
Look at me! Smile, please
One minute

297
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I've known about you
since 12th standard

298
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,080
But, we've never met

299
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,320
Ravi talked of you
in all his letters

300
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,480
Now we finally meet

301
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,480
But he's gone

302
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,520
It was an accident
I should've been on that flight

303
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,600
He flew instead

304
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,880
He's watching us from above

305
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,520
My dear big brother

306
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,680
Shall we look for him?

307
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,200
I love this

308
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,640
May I scream?

309
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,320
Thank you for everything

310
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,120
It was out of this world

311
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,200
Thanks

312
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Wait

313
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
I don't think we
should meet again

314
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,200
It's too dangerous

315
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,960
The chemistry is going haywire

316
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,080
Correct?

317
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,360
Maybe

318
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,560
I better say goodnight
before I have a change of heart

319
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,880
Good night

320
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,160
Good night

321
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,280
I'm trapped in this torturous cell
in enemy territory

322
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,520
Don't know if
I'll come out alive

323
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Freedom seems like
a faraway dream

324
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Will I ever see
you again, Leela?

325
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,920
I close my eyes and
I see your face

326
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,320
Your smile

327
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,160
Your droopy ears

328
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,880
Your lips

329
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,760
Those big eyes

330
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,160
Your poise, your anger
I see it all

331
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,240
Hey, you! Stop!
Where the hell are you going?

332
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,360
It's your voice that eludes me
I can't hear you calling 'VC'

333
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,000
...or cry out with joy

334
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,080
...or hear you sing

335
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,400
I need to see you

336
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,640
At least once more

337
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,240
What's going on?

338
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Here you go again

339
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Hello

340
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
Is it the Air Force guy?

341
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,880
What do I tell your father?

342
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,080
Look at what she's doing

343
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,880
No food for you

344
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,840
Listen, don't feed her
Let her stay hungry

345
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,320
What a pleasant surprise!

346
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Haven't seen you
two in a while

347
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,600
Who did you miss
the most, Ilyas?

348
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
Me, or Leela?

349
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,720
- Can I ask something?
- Please

350
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,920
I hesitate to talk about it

351
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,600
I told her you wouldn't judge
But she would not listen

352
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
You're sure it's okay?
May I?

353
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,440
Sure

354
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,920
Wouldn't want you to think
it's weird that a doctor

355
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,240
Don't beat about the bush

356
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
She likes someone

357
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,400
Nidhi!
Crazy

358
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,440
I haven't told him

359
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,840
But she wants to

360
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm scared
What if he laughs?

361
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
How long can you
keep it a secret?

362
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
He isn't in town

363
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,840
The Air Force won't
tell us where he is

364
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,880
Where's VC?
I haven't seen him in days

365
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,240
Ilyas looks upset

366
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,400
Don't be sad! I came to see you

367
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,600
- Leela came to see Varun
- Oh!

368
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,040
Won't you say anything
apart from 'Oh'?

369
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,960
Do you know where Varun is?

370
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Leh airbase
At a three-month camp

371
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,160
Hi

372
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,160
Hi

373
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,720
Wasn't expecting you

374
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,880
The best moment in the past
two months you being here

375
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,080
You're lying
But it feels so good hearing it

376
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,440
So, did you come
here for me?

377
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,160
I came to see where
Ravi last was

378
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,480
And to see you too

379
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,880
Shall I take you there?
Peak Rimo Kangri 2

380
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,840
Ready

381
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,360
I won't forget this moment

382
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,880
Till my last breath

383
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,880
Till my last breath

384
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,040
Till my last breath

385
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,280
I think I-

386
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,920
Don't say a word

387
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,200
This is all I need

388
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,080
I-

389
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,800
Don't say it

390
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,440
You don't know what I was
going to say

391
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,440
- Whatever it is...Don't
- It's not what you think

392
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,760
Look over there

393
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
It's beautiful

394
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,680
Come on
We have to go back

395
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,360
Come

396
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,440
Just a little longer
Please

397
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,240
These mountains will soon vanish

398
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,160
The clouds will devour them

399
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,000
Maybe it's a snow storm
Come

400
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,280
Really?
Let's stay a while then

401
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,480
If we stay, there's
no going back

402
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,920
- VC, just fifteen minutes
- No way! It's dangerous

403
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,920
Can't you see how
fast it's coming?

404
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,520
Let it come
I'm not scared

405
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,560
Don't talk like a moron
Come on

406
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,240
Wait! Five minutes

407
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,400
No

408
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,920
Don't you follow English?

409
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,520
Move, move

410
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,320
You're barking at me like
a German shepherd

411
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,960
Listen to me

412
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,360
- What if I won't?
- I'll hit you, come on!

413
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,120
Seriously?
You'll hit me?

414
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,680
Are you blind?
Look over there

415
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,320
Come

416
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,480
So, you'll hit me
if I don't come?

417
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,640
Yes, I will!
Come I say

418
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,400
- Let go of me!
- Hey

419
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,080
- You go
- Stop!

420
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,920
Why are you so stubborn?

421
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,480
I don't like men
who manhandle women

422
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,560
- Fine, let's go
- You go!

423
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,320
If it gets any worse, there may be
an avalanche and that'll be it

424
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,640
Why not say that?

425
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,560
Instead of calling me a moron
and manhandling me

426
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,400
I was scared for you

427
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,400
It's my life!

428
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,080
- And what about me?
- You have your Girija

429
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,720
I don't want Girija
I want you

430
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,840
So much to say...

431
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,160
...and so little time

432
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,560
I'll write to you

433
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,600
No, I'll send you a courier

434
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,440
I'll be waiting for the courier
at the doorstep

435
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,560
What's all this sweet talk?

436
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,920
One month more

437
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,000
- Back to Srinagar
- Thirty days?

438
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,520
Wait for the courier

439
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,560
Okay?

440
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,200
- Okay?
- Okay

441
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,560
Bye

442
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,320
(Lecturing)

443
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,720
"Waiting for a sweet smile"

444
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,800
"Won't you, please?"

445
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,120
"My heartbeat is missing
You thief!"

446
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,240
"Oh my! Am a poet now
A poet smitten by thee"

447
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,720
"Should I speak honestly?"

448
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,400
"Or will this do?"

449
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,640
"O my darling
I'm coming to you"

450
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,960
"We have some new
scores to settle"

451
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,880
"Do I propose to you in a chorus?
Is that a yes? A no? Or a yes!"

452
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,720
"O pretty woman, marry me"

453
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,400
"Flirt with me, get high with me"

454
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,560
"Oh beauty!"

455
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,000
"Never mind if you're
angry or shy"

456
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,280
"Don't worry, hey pretty woman"

457
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,200
"Marry me"

458
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,520
"O pretty woman, marry me"

459
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,680
"Flirt with me, get high with me"

460
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,080
"Oh Beauty!"

461
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,720
"Call my number
When you are in the mood for love"

462
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,920
"Oh pretty woman"

463
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,680
Nidhi, is that you?

464
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,840
Traitor!

465
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:09,240
"Am I asking for something that
nobody has dared to?"

466
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
"I'd be grateful..."

467
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,560
"...if without a fuss..."

468
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,760
"...you'd bestow it upon me"

469
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,720
"Hey buttercup!"

470
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,360
"All I want is a little bit of time
A little bit of love"

471
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,360
"And a little bit of lust"

472
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,640
"My soulmate"

473
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,840
"Deny me not
And don't you forget me"

474
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,720
"My pretty woman"

475
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,680
"O pretty woman, marry me"

476
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,040
"Oh beauty!"

477
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,360
"Flirt with me, get high with me"

478
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,720
"Oh pretty woman!"

479
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,800
"Never mind if you're
angry or shy"

480
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,560
"Don't worry, hey pretty woman"

481
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:10,360
"O pretty woman, marry me"

482
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,200
"Oh pretty woman!"

483
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,560
Hey loudmouth!

484
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,000
Brother Varun!

485
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,960
Sitara, my rowdy sister
We never stop arguing

486
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,720
He's such a bully
He pulls my ears, twists my arm

487
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,680
Giant
Go man

488
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,880

Mr Fighter Pilot

501
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,760
We were wondering if you'd make it
to the wedding at all

502
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,960
And here you are,
girlfriend in tow

503
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,680
Are you asking me to go?

504
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,080
Do you ever listen to me?

505
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,040
Hero!

509
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,520
My little brother,
thirteen years too late

510
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,560
An afterthought! A leftover

511
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,800
Extra fitting

512
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,920
- Am I right?

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,120
Drink up

514
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
That's the groom

betel-stained lips to me"

01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,640
"She clings like a young scamp,
tangled in his arms"

548
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,080
"Kiss me till I'm dizzy, my love"

549
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,960
"The bride is a precious jewel
And the groom an oak chest"

550
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,760
"Encase this precious gem
in the safety of his chest"

551
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,240
"Exchange the garlands first"

552
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,640
"Then some saffron milk"

553
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,840
"And when she emerges
dishevelled from the bedroom..."

554
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,480
"...drape her in a new saree"

555
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,680
"My queen..."

556
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,080
"...this is the Tamil tradition"

557
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,400
"From the cacti forest
echo the beat of drums"

558
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,880
"As two baby elephants rejoice"

559
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,160
"In the pearly spray
of the waterfall..."

560
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,920
"...the temptress
sways intoxicated"

561
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:58,840
"O young bride,
isn't this our tradition"

562
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,120
We're almost there
Be patient

563
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,920
You were the one who was impatient
Why tell her now?

564
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,920
And we thought he was saint!

565
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,840
- Relax
- Don't panic

566
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,760
And don’t push!

567
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,320
You're going to be a father!

568
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,480
Be quiet

569
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,080
Why did you choose a hospital
in Kashmir?

570
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
Mom forbade me

571
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,240
So I insisted on going there

572
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,800
Bravo! You chose well

573
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,080
Her brother Ravi was my course-mate
Remember him?

574
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,280
He's no more

575
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,360
I was in the 12th standard
when Ravi passed away

576
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,080
- I decided it had to be Srinagar then
- You didn't tell me

577
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,560
You didn't ask

578
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,360
Varun only cares about Varun
and what he fancies

579
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,440
Nothing else matters

580
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,640
Are you saying
he doesn't fancy Leela?

581
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,120
When Varun brought that
Gujju girl home...

582
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,280
...Sitara made a similar joke

583
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,480
- Game over
- Deepak, shut up

584
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,680
You're not the first

585
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,880
He has brought a few girls
home before you

586
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,480
Deepak has a mental problem

587
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,040
Chakra, please

588
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,360
- What did I say? She's a doctor
- Enough, please

589
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,720
We're in a hospital

590
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,680
Interrupt me again
and I'll throw you out

591
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,640
Enough, Dad

592
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,400
You, too

593
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,800
- You dare touch me
- What?

594
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,880
You dare touch me or Mom

595
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,040
Varun

596
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,280
- Stay out of it
- This is a hospital

597
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,280
I say shut up!

598
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,280
You're shouting

599
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,240
I said shut up!
So shut up

600
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,360
You and I are polar opposites

601
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,400
I'm a fighter pilot,
wielding bombs

602
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,400
And you're a doctor, saving lives

603
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,040
Darkness and Light

604
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,720
But what is light
without darkness?

605
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,600
I don't know if there
will be another chance...

606
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,920
...to see you again

607
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,360
...to seek forgiveness

608
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,280
But not a day passes when
I don't hope for it

609
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,680
You're somewhere
beyond these walls

610
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,840
And I'm trapped in
a jail in Pakistan

611
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,960
But I plan to break out

612
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,160
And come looking for you

613
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,640
Are you mental?

614
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,640
It's dangerous
But I'm determined to escape

615
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,440
Look at what you've done!
The whole pile has fallen

616
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,720
- Always adding to my workload!
- Sorry, sir I didn't mean to

617
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,760
'Bharat Mata ki Jai!'

618
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,000
A live cartridge, VC

619
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,640
You'll ruin everything!

620
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,960
Dry run! Ammunition and
12 mm shells from the store

621
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,920
All I need is a can
and petrol and coal

622
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,880
Don't you get it?
No explosives!

623
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,400
- Got it?
- Okay

624
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,760
- Where's the first-aid box, Wasim?
- It's right here

625
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,400
Was it your people?
Or ours?

626
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,240
What can I say?
It was our lot

627
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,280
What?

628
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,760
- Peace be unto you, sir
- Same to you

629
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,960
We have a terrible situation

630
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,560
Three Indian prisoners have escaped

631
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,680
Forgive me, sir

632
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,440
I don't know how they managed
to dig this tunnel

633
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,520
Fax their photographs
across immediately

634
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,160
We didn't go for the obvious route,
the Wagah border

635
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,840
They'd find us in no time

636
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,640
We chose the Khyber Pass,
to Afghanistan instead

637
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,640
In Peshawar now...

638
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,760
...Jamrud, up next Khyber and then
the Afghan border

639
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,040
We're just 40 kms away

640
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,880
If I get to Afghanistan,
I get to India

641
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:15,120
Shelling on Army's ammunition dump
Residents from nearby areas evacuated

642
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:22,760
Additional forces deployed to Drass, Kaksar
& Batalik to combat the infiltrators

643
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,680
Pakistani intruders shot down our
Canberra reconnaissance aircraft

644
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:36,120
Govt officials have stated that
this is a localised issue...

645
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,320
Bloody hell!

646
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,880
A missile attack

647
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,880
Local issue...Case closed

648
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,560
Harry, did you hear?

649
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,120
It is a Pakistani army operation

650
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,880
I saw it, man

651
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,080
No doubt at all

652
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,440
It's a cover-up

653
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,080
Can I say something?

654
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,720
Maybe they did not want a flashpoint
to turn into a full-scale war

655
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,640
True, sir

656
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,520
Both are nuclear powers,
shouldn't let tensions escalate

657
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,160
We've just signed
the Lahore peace agreement

658
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,360
- Thank you
- Sure

659
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,960
One hand signs the agreement...

660
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,880
...and the other sends their army
posing as terrorists

661
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,280
It's not the first time

662
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,960
How can we be sure
they aren't militants?

663
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,480
Smarty Pants...

664
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,200
...are you certain they were
really militants?

665
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,360
It's definitely the Pakistani army

666
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,560
But we can't get trigger happy, can we?

667
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,160
Leela, will you please keep quiet?

668
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,440
- Why?
- Because I say so

669
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,080
What's the problem?
Being a woman or a civilian?

670
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,040
Leela, enough

671
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,040
Just a minute

672
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,520
Look

673
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,360
- Suppose I'm an officer?
- Take it off

674
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,040
- Doesn't it suit me?
- I said take it off

675
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,080
Sorry

676
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,440
- I shouldn't have shouted
- It's okay

677
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,880
Sorry

678
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,680
Sorry, guys

679
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,360
So, a woman can't speak...

680
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,120
...or have an opinion or become
a fighter pilot, right?

681
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,200
Sure, she can! On one condition...

682
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,040
...she must be beautiful

683
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,000
She must be beautiful! Right guys?

684
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah!

685
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,200
So, beauty is all that matters
in a woman?

686
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,600
Men and women...
we're made differently

687
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,480
How so? I don't...

688
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,880
You're a doctor, sweetheart
You should know

689
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,680
Man's natural instinct is to hunt

690
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,160
To seek and fight for food
We're designed that way

691
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
And women...

692
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,680
To make babies for you?

693
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,800
That, too

694
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,600
We're no good for much else?

695
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,360
Why so angry?

696
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,120
Let go

697
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,520
Let go, please I want to go

698
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,680
Okay

699
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,280
Go!

700
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,840
Sorry

701
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,960
It's our first fight

702
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,320
And you're running away

703
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,600
Fight back like a true Tamil woman

704
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,920
My princess, don't go

705
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,880
My sweetheart

706
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,640
Dear!

707
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,080
Hello

708
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,320
- Happy birthday
- Thank you

709
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,080
Wait

710
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,200
Who's wailing out there?

711
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,720
I'm not dead yet! Tell him

712
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,480
"As I searched the skies for you..."

713
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,480
"...you vanished into the sea"

714
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,400
"As I plunged into the sea..."

715
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,200
"...you appeared in the sky"

716
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:33,360
"You left me wandering
in a star spangled forest..."

717
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,160
"...and made me lose
my sense of self"

718
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,920
"This ain't right"

719
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,040
"It ain't fair"

720
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,600
"O beautiful moon, this ain't right"

721
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,200
"This ain't right"

722
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,600
"It ain't fair"

723
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,840
"O beautiful midnight, this ain't right"

724
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,200
Where are you going?

725
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,800
"The quest for sound..."

726
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,840
"...ends in silence"

727
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,120
"The quest for silence..."

728
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,320
"...ends in wisdom"

729
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,640
"And when I seek you..."

730
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:52,560
"...draped in clouds, you drift away"

731
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,240
You treat me like a slave
Like your pet dog

732
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,360
You want me at your beck and call

733
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,160
I can't do it

734
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,280
I have self-respect

735
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,320
I want an equal relationship

736
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,120
But we are not equals

737
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,200
I'm beneath you

738
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,120
- Leela is far superior to me
- You don't mean that

739
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,560
I do! From the bottom of my heart...

740
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,280
Without you...

741
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,120
...I have no one

742
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,920
Don't leave me

743
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,640
I beg you

744
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,840
You're all I want

745
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,120
I love you

746
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,040
Guys, look who is here!

747
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,840
Didn't I tell you...

748
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,200
...Leela would come if I called her

749
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,320
You didn't believe me, did you?

750
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,280
And you challenged me! Well?

751
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,760
No matter what, she's my girl

752
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,040
Do you believe me now?
Aren't I the lucky one?

753
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,080
I challenge you to find a girl like her

754
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,320
Go, guys go! You owe me
a single malt

755
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,480
And don't be too jealous!

756
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,960
Won't you ever say it?

757
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,280
'I love you'

758
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm not as good as you

759
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:38,320
But I love you...

760
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,400
...more than you will ever love me

761
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,560
I'll love you even if you don't

762
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,600
I'll love you even if you despise me

763
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,720
Till the end of time

764
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,320
I love you

765
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,680
What did you say? Tell me

766
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,240
Say it again

767
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,120
Go on

768
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,400
Sorry, I take it back

769
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:56,120
"Is he the Sky, who'll come to me..."

770
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,760
"Is he the Sky, caressing me..."

771
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:11,120
"...pouring down as rain
Unravelling secrets unknown..."

772
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,880
"...and hiding within me"

773
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:20,680
"Bowing down from afar
And standing tall when near"

774
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:27,440
"Freezing over at my pride..."

775
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:38,680
"...and melting with my love"

776
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:47,480
"...and melting with my love"

777
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,800
"My secret lover..."

778
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,560
"...will come for me"

779
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,960
"While with me, he thinks of her"

780
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,600
"While with another,
I'm all he thinks of"

781
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:20,040
"Foresake me, he never will
Forget me, he never will"

782
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,440
"If he were to forget me,
lose his life, he will"

783
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,640
"To my downcast eyes,
he is the endless horizon"

784
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,840
"And with my eyes wide open,
he's the melting sky"

785
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,760
"Is he the Sky, caressing me..."

786
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,760
"...pouring down as rain
Unravelling secrets unknown..."

787
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,760
"...and hiding within me"

788
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,400
"Bowing down from afar
And standing tall when near"

789
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:58,320
"Freezing over at my pride..."

790
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,600
Stop!

791
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,320
Stop!

792
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,120
Turn off the headlights!

793
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,560
Get back to your seat

794
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,200
I can almost hear your voice now...

795
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,160
...and smell your sweet fragrance

796
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,000
Your laughter

797
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,040
Your happiness

798
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,040
The winds carry your presence to me

799
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,080
Come with me

800
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,640
Doctor, give us a minute

801
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,640
Okay

802
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,000
This is the Registrar's office

803
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,760
So?

804
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,120
If we register our names now,
we can marry in a month

805
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,040
I never said I'd marry you

806
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,400
They're closing soon
We can register at 4pm tomorrow

807
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,120
Come tomorrow with your friends,
family and friendly creatures

808
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,320
We register tomorrow and
get married in a month

809
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,000
Varun and Leela, okay?

810
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,600
I hadn't thought of marriage

811
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:42,000
You have one full month to do that

812
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,960
A simple yes or a simple no

813
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,840
Grandpa!

814
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,000
Yes

815
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,800
Are you sure it was today?

816
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,920
You're asking me for the nth time

817
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,280
He said:'Registrar's office 4pm'

818
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,880
'Bring your friends and family'

819
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,360
I don't think VC will show up

820
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,840
Ilyas, don't jinx it

821
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,240
No one can keep a govt office
open beyond 5pm

822
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,760
Then sweet-talk them

823
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,200
And buy us another half an hour

824
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,240
I already have
But I don't believe he'll come

825
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,800
- Maybe you should be quiet
- Maybe you should

826
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,440
I warned you about VC

827
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,920
Because you like Leela
and you're jealous of VC

828
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,000
Nidhi, stop it! Please

829
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,920
The truth is always bitter

830
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,400
Adrenaline rush

831
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,920
My whole body is wired

832
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,600
But I am filled with fear

833
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,480
My first contact with the enemy

834
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,480
- So...
- So?

835
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:01,760
I feel the enemy is just like us

836
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,400
- They could be good men
- Look into the mirror

837
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,840
Can you see yourself?
Do you see Arjun?

838
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,840
Or do I look like Lord Krishna?

839
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,400
This is Kargil not Kurukshetra

840
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,960
Analysing whether the enemy
is good or bad is not our job

841
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,440
That's between him and his God

842
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,120
Your job is to ensure that he meets
his Maker swiftly

843
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,720
That's it

844
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,840
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

845
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,920
We have only one chance

846
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,520
No second...

847
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,360
No second chances

848
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,920
One mistake...Permanent mistake

849
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,200
Or you'll return
in a body bag

850
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,280
Hi, sweetheart! When did you come?

851
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,720
How long have you been waiting?

852
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,200
For two days...

853
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,000
...at the Registrar's! Waiting
for an Air Force officer

854
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,960
I forgot

855
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,840
I'm sorry

856
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,400
Where were you?

857
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,600
I was in Delhi

858
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,960
You could have phoned me

859
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,480
I said I'm sorry

860
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,360
Ilyas, please explain to your friend

861
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,160
It's all right if you forgot
There's tension all around

862
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,560
But you never meant it

863
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,680
This marriage registration
was a charade

864
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,000
I'm the fool! It's my fault

865
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,800
- Let's go now and register
- They're closed today

866
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,160
- Why do this to me again?
- Tomorrow then?

867
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,800
You either treat me like a queen...

868
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,760
...or walk all over me

869
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,520
No

870
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,760
- You trample over me
- No, never

871
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,760
It's the truth

872
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,880
- Guys, my girl is angry with me
- Varun, please

873
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,360
- Ask her not to go! Come on
- VC, please

874
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,640
Don't humiliate me more

875
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,440
Please let go, Varun

876
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,800
Her Highness is leaving
Go, it's a free country

877
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,040
- Take your dear chaperone with you
- VC, stop it

878
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,040
- Ilyas, just ignore him
- Ilyas, please ignore me

879
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,600
You're doing it again

880
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,800
Walking all over me

881
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,520
I don't know why I keep
coming back to you

882
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,440
Because you love me...

883
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,640
...and you know that I love you

884
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,240
I love you

885
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,280
Why does Leela let VC mistreat her?

886
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,800
- She's lost her mind
- Why doesn't she leave him?

887
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,960
- Many smart guys out there
- Really...? Where?

888
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,480
It's love

889
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,960
Whatever

890
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,080
That's how it is

891
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,040
You know officer Ashok, right?
He fancies me

892
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,960
Always smiling at me

893
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,160
I have a crush on you

894
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,240
You like Leela, Leela likes VC

895
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,920
VC likes only VC

896
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,560
I give up!

897
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,160
That's just how it is

898
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,960
Not to the bed

899
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,640
What do you see?

900
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,760
My gorgeous one

901
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,480
What else?

902
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,960
My smart one

903
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,880
What else?

904
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,400
My angry headstrong girl

905
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,080
Notice any change?
Look carefully

906
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,680
Can my hands do the looking?

907
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,160
Yes

908
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,920
Okay

909
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Two and a half months

910
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,760
It's very simple
Yes or no?

911
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,080
I thought about it...

912
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,040
...for a while

913
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,000
Imagined a little boy...

914
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,960
...or a girl...

915
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:52,680
...by my side

916
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,080
Sitting on my shoulder

917
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,240
Laughing and playing

918
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,600
And if they were twins...

919
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,120
...they would be
Rohan and Rohini

920
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,000
But I have a nagging fear...

921
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,160
...that I'd be like my Dad

922
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,280
And be a terrible father

923
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,800
Is it a yes or a no?

924
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,800
I'm not really cut out...

925
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,080
...to be a husband...

926
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,440
...or a father

927
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,760
You're all I need

928
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,080
No...

929
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,600
I'm not good enough

930
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,360
I am unworthy

931
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,640
If this is what I want

932
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,120
No, Leela

933
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,200
It just won't work

934
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,360
Don't just walk away
in silence

935
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,760
I'll handle it

936
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,760
How?

937
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,120
I'm a doctor

938
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,320
I'll take care

939
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,680
I've always been self-destructive,
reckless...

940
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,600
...you became collateral damage
Because you were my other half

941
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,520
Destroying was my second nature

942
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,560
But it's all behind me now

943
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,760
My retribution is only
10 kilometers away

944
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,040
I can almost touch Torkham Gate
The Afghan border

945
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,560
Salaams, sir

946
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,000
Yes, that's him!

947
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,120
Sir, could you hold him
for a minute?

948
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,320
Brother...

949
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,440
Can I find an auto or a horse-cart
to Torkham Gate?

950
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,640
Arrest him!

951
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,200
If I were to admit that
it was all my fault...

952
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,560
...would you believe me?

953
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,040
You're dearer to me than life itself

954
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,200
I can never hold you again

955
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,360
Or be a part of your life ever again

956
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,360
In one fateful moment...

957
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,040
...all my hopes have plunged
into a dark abyss

958
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,560
Sir, Colonel Mithran passed away
last night

959
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:56,160
He passed away last night
Leela's parents are here from Delhi

960
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,400
The burial is at 4pm

961
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,560
I don't want him here

962
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,040
Just a minute

963
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,640
Please come with me

964
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:01,720
Hi

965
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:06,480
Good evening, ma'am Sir
I'm Squadron Leader Varun

966
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,040
Your son's course-mate
and colleague

967
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,800
Now Leela's friend

968
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,040
I don't know how much Leela
has told you about me

969
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,760
She's upset with me right now

970
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:27,000
So I came to apologise to her
in your presence

971
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,320
Okay

972
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,880
Let's pretend you asked me
to sit down

973
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,840
- Please sit down
- Finally! So, you can speak

974
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,440
You had me worried

975
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,200
Mr Prakash Abraham

976
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,800
Or should I call you 'uncle'?

977
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:51,480
Prakash sir?
Just Prakash would do, right?

978
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:58,560
Is it a vow of silence?
For Col Mithran?

979
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,320
In our line of work,
we celebrate death

980
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,560
Or should I say life?
Depends on how you look at it

981
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,320
So, will no one speak?

982
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:15,080
Okay

983
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,760
I get it

984
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,520
You don't like me
And my relationship with Leela

985
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,720
- I'll fetch the rice
- Ma'am, wait I'll get it

986
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,200
I can sense your silent questions

987
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,760
Can he take care of our daughter?

988
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:37,320
You're a renowned lawyer
Your questions will be complicated

989
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,720
Will I take good care of her?

990
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,360
Most definitely

991
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,120
But if you ask me if I'm capable?

992
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,840
Am I competent? Am I rich?

993
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,960
What my social standing is

994
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:57,160
I wouldn't know how to answer that

995
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:03,440
Is this a silent interrogation?

996
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,160
Am I in the dock?

997
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,720
Yes, Your Honour...No, Your Honour

998
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,040
Did I do something wrong?
Leela?

999
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,760
Not tonight, I didn't

1000
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,280
I'm the only one laughing

1001
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,560
Feels like an inquiry

1002
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,000
In the Forces, only a grave mistake
leads to an inquiry

1003
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,880
My only mistake has been...

1004
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,520
...my extreme affection...

1005
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,360
...for Leela

1006
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:48,880
Are you scared for your daughter?
Because I'm in the Air Force?

1007
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:53,120
You lost your son Ravi in a sortie
that I should have been on

1008
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,360
Do you hold me responsible for it?

1009
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,560
Am I a bad omen? Do you think that?

1010
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,640
Varun, enough

1011
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,400
Wait! They're trying to say something

1012
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:07,600
Looking at me
as if I were vermin

1013
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,920
I'm a fighter pilot

1014
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,760
I'm hard-wired for combat

1015
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,000
I can sense animosity
in your silence

1016
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,240
Do you wish I was dead?

1017
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,840
Prakash, shall I tell you something?

1018
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,160
You're a criminal lawyer

1019
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,600
Well acquainted with criminals
and cheats

1020
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,360
Do you take everyone for a fraud?

1021
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,920
Or have you become one too?

1022
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,480
Can you please stop this?

1023
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:42,600
- One minute
- It's okay

1024
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,360
It's not okay
It's not cool

1025
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,040
He is interrogating me without words

1026
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,520
Looking at me
as if I were a terrorist

1027
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,320
- Take him outside
- Talk to me!

1028
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,720
Why hide behind them?

1029
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,920
For God's sake, go

1030
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,200
Come with me and I'll leave

1031
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,600
Varun, go...Please

1032
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,880
Come with me

1033
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,320
- Like you did the other day
- Varun, just go

1034
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,960
Are you telling me to get out?
Say the words

1035
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,240
- Get out!
- What?

1036
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:18,880
Get out

1037
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,360
Please, get out

1038
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,920
Please

1039
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:29,960
Ma'am...Sir

1040
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,240
I'm leaving Srinagar

1041
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,400
I've given in my resignation

1042
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,000
I won't come back

1043
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,120
I know I've been difficult

1044
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,040
I've given you so much trouble

1045
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,040
My train ticket

1046
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
I'm going far away

1047
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,920
- Just came to say goodbye
- You think it won't work, I know

1048
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,880
But if it did...

1049
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,480
- ...we'd be so good together
- We're opposites, Varun

1050
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,360
- Leela-Varun, made for each other
- Stop it

1051
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,160
Please don't leave me

1052
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,840
I'm not ready for this

1053
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,400
Neither are you

1054
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,240
We're too different

1055
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,440
Give me one chance! We'll get married
just the way you want

1056
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,280
A destination wedding?

1057
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:33,720
Look at when you're bringing up marriage!

1058
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,120
A church wedding?
A registrar ceremony?

1059
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,280
- Don't make me cry
- Shall we marry 3 times?

1060
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,280
Forget tying 3 knots,
we'll marry thrice

1061
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:42,560
Stop!

1062
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,720
Varun, please...

1063
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:51,680
I beg you
Please don't leave me

1064
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,640
Give me this one chance
Wait for me

1065
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,720
It won't work

1066
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,760
Without you I'd be lost

1067
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,360
Hear me

1068
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,680
I'll be the man you want me to be

1069
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,800
We'll just destroy each other

1070
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,800
Leela, give me a chance

1071
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,560
What can I say?

1072
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,560
Say you love me

1073
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,360
Bye

1074
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,520
I'll come looking for you

1075
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,760
No matter where you go...

1076
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:36,600
...I'll find you

1077
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,360
I love you

1078
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,240
The time we parted,
was a time of war...

1079
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,960
The Kargil war

1080
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,960
All my anger, arrogance,
recklessness...

1081
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,360
...was wiped out
in the 50-day war

1082
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,720
8 assault rifles...

1083
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,960
...320 rounds of bullets
stared me in the face

1084
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,080
The end seemed inevitable

1085
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:37,480
I'm saying...let's blast out

1086
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:39,520
With what?

1087
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,880
I have everything

1088
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,680
Hold it

1089
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,320
Petrol

1090
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,080
Petrol

1091
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,440
Come on, boys! Move!

1092
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,600
Unlock the gate

1093
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,560
We should head North West

1094
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,760
- I think...
- Just shut up and look!

1095
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:57,200
- Are you mad?
- Yes

1096
01:52:58,280 --> 01:52:59,600
I'm going

1097
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,720
The truck is turning around the bend
Hurry

1098
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,040
Step aside! Do you wish to die?

1099
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,200
Don't you dare enter my truck!

1100
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,800
Get down! Do not enter

1101
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,160
This truck belongs to my boss

1102
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:39,480
- How far is the border?
- 20kms

1103
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,200
Don't fire I want them alive

1104
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:50,840
- Are you Pakistanis?
- No, no Indians

1105
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,000
Move back!

1106
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,040
Go, go

1107
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:54,120
You got rid of him

1108
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,920
Fire!

1109
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,480
VC, faster

1110
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,200
- Do you have a bottle?
- I might

1111
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:10,440
- And a diesel can?
- Why a diesel can?

1112
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,520
Let's do it VC

1113
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:19,360
Grab the steering wheel
Go on

1114
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,760
Torkham border post, come in

1115
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:26,200
Are you okay?

1116
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:49,240
Block the road

1117
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:53,000
Don't let them pass
Hurry

1118
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,560
Keep going! Faster

1119
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:58,040
Go...go

1120
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,160
Go

1121
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:38,040
Indian

1122
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,720
Hey! Open the gate!

1123
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,040
I never imagined I'd be overjoyed
to see the Afghani border police

1124
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:09,840
We were kept in custody
for 12 days

1125
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:16,360
The Indian Embassy delegates escorted us
to Delhi with full military honours

1126
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,360
Boys, our hero is back

1127
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:33,600
Above all...it was
back to flying

1128
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:44,720
Only one thing was missing

1129
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,360
That was you, Leela

1130
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,440
I have 8 weeks leave every year

1131
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,000
I set out on a quest...

1132
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,600
...looking for you, Leela

1133
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,280
I've enquired at your hospital

1134
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,720
No one knows where you are
Not your friends...

1135
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,480
...Nidhi and Ilyas

1136
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,240
They say you may be
with the Red Cross

1137
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,600
So I keep looking for you

1138
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,280
One city at a time

1139
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,880
One Red Cross camp at a time

1140
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:22,000
If I don't find you now,
my quest will not stop

1141
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,080
Year after year...

1142
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,600
...until I find you

1143
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,040
What would I say
if I found you?

1144
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,720
Would you want to see me at all?

1145
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,240
Would you believe me if I said
I'm a changed man?

1146
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,320
I only thought of myself...

1147
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,720
...but now I care about others

1148
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,600
I know now...

1149
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,760
...how precious you are to me

1150
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,600
I must see you again

1151
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,800
Even from afar

1152
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,200
Doctor, keep this

1153
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,280
How are you?

1154
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,960
And you?

1155
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,880
Did they tell you I was dead?

1156
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:07,560
Or missing in action?

1157
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:13,160
I watched on the news...

1158
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,920
...that you had resumed duty

1159
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:25,520
Can I hug you just once?

1160
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,240
Don't look at me

1161
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,880
I'm crying like a child

1162
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,280
I can't believe you're here

1163
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,240
So unexpected

1164
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,600
Is this a coincidence?

1165
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:13,800
Leela!

1166
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,360
I'm coming

1167
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,560
- Why did you...
- I didn't mean to disturb you

1168
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,640
Just wanted to say sorry...

1169
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:30,480
...for having been so difficult

1170
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,600
For letting you go

1171
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,720
For having met you

1172
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,880
For falling in love with you

1173
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,800
Mother!

1174
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:07,160
It's getting late

1175
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:16,920
Your daughter?

1176
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,440
Come, quick

1177
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:23,400
Rohini, come here

1178
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:26,520
Everyone's going

1179
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,720
Come here

1180
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:49,440
Does she look like you
or me?

1181
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,640
I've seen you before

1182
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,680
Be polite

1183
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:30,920
I've crossed the seven seas
and seven hills...

1184
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,480
...looking for you

1185
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,600
Really?

1186
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:56,040
Did you ever think of me?

1187
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,680
Every single day

1188
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:07,960
You didn't call even once
in three years

1189
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,720
Not a word from you

1190
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,400
You just disappeared

1191
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,440
What if you didn't like Rohini?

1192
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,760
Or me?

1193
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:57,800
This naughty girl...

1194
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:02,240
...is now your responsibility

1195
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,200
Ro...

1196
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,280
...this is Varun

1197
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:12,480
Varun is your responsibility

1198
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,800
Hold him tight
