1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,625


3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,208
- Hello uncle?
- Hi Shiva

4
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,833
Did the flight land on time?

5
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,125
Yes, uncle

6
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,667
- Very good
- On time

7
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,208
I'm on my way home

8
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,333
Okay, I'm waiting
 for you at home

9
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,000
See you in half an hour

10
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,417
- Okay, dear
- Okay, uncle

11
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,458
Thank you, sir

12
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,708
- How are you?
- Fine, uncle and you?

13
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm fine
How is Mumbai life?

14
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,167
Same as anywhere else

15
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,125
If someone yells at you in Hindi
when driving, it's Mumbai

16
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,917
If cuss words in Tamil, it's Chennai

17
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,792
That's a good one
Come...come in

18
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,292
You could have rented this place
instead of locking it for 2 years

19
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,542
No, uncle

20
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,375
Let the US program get confirmed

21
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,542
We can decide then

22
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,833
- How long are you here?
- 3 days

23
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,292
I came to attend an important client meeting

24
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,750
Did you eat?

25
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,417
If you need anything, call me

26
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,083
- See you
- Okay, bye

27
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,792
'Lock the gate, Shiva'

28
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,958
'Why haven't you
taken off your shoes, Shiva?'

29
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,042
'Did you think it's your office?'

30
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,167
Is he playing games with us?

31
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,875
It's a project worth 3 billion

32
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,958
We are almost near completion

33
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,583
He's now cribbing and
wants to demolish this and that

34
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,917
- Who is he?
- His name is Sabapathy

35
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,542
He got transferred recently

36
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
Very straightforward

37
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,875
On top of it
he's very rude

38
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,000
So are you asking me
to demolish everything?

39
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,250
I trusted you and started
this project, right?

40
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,083
Hey, you wait here

41
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,250
Okay, bro

42
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,125
Where's my girl?

43
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,708
The other 3 are fine

44
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,833
He's the only one creating a problem

45
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:47,083
- Greetings, bro...sir
- Hello, Ranga

46
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,667
We've offered 1 million
through the councillor

47
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,917
He isn't budging an inch

48
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,542
- Get him transferred again
- That isn't possible

49
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,042
There's only 1 way out

50
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,917
Let's transfer him forever!

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,125
What do you mean?

52
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,500
We have no other choice, Guna

53
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,083
He has started to probe already

54
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,417
He's going to send your file
to the head office tomorrow

55
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,917
Before that we must finish him off

56
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,125
That's it then

57
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,750
Ranga, go to his house
and kill his whole family

58
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,792
Hey, Guna

59
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,250
Your anger is blinding you

60
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,583
'He's a Govt servant'

61
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,542
If anything misfires
all of us will be behind bars

62
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,583
When and what should be done...

63
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,917
...I'll instruct

64
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,667
- Ranga...?
- Sir

65
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:40,042
Madhavi, I've been trying your #
for the past 2 days and it's switched off?

66
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,667
- My phone fell into a tub of water
- Then?

67
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,958
I stuffed it into the sack of rice

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
- Rice bag?
- Don't you know?

69
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,917
Mangoes are usually stored in rice

70
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,542
But this is news to me

71
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't worry, I'll get you a Samsung phone

72
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,958
Why do I need a Samsung phone?

73
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,667
iPhone will do!

74
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,667
'iPhone...'?

75
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,333
- Ranga, understood?
- Yes, sir

76
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,500
Simple matter

77
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,417
But you must execute it properly

78
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,417
Ranga, who is going with you?

79
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,917
I'll take our boy Kasi

80
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,292
- Why him?
- No one will suspect him

81
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll take care
I'll finish and call you

82
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,167
Okay

83
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,208
Move aside
I have a lot of work to do

84
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,833
- I want to ask you something
- What...?

85
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,042
If I buy you an iPhone...

86
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,833
...what will you give me in return?

87
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,042
Shall I tell you?

88
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,583
- I'll say it
- Please do, sweetheart

89
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,250
I'll give you

90
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,792
...my old phone!

91
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,042
- Bro...!
- Let's go

92
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:45,625
How much will an iPhone cost?

93
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,750
More than Rs 50000

94
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,667
50,000, huh?!

95
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,875
Dai, be ready

96
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,250
I'm ready, bro

97
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,542
Sir, help me with this address

98
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,292
15, Manicka Vinayakam Street
 Tambaram-

99
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,667
Sir, don't

100
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,417
Don't hit me, sir

101
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,167
Start the van

102
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,458
Don't, sir

103
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,042
- Rascal!
- Sir, why are you hitting me?

104
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,750
Aiyo!

105
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,417
- Hello...?
- Bro, job done

106
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,208
Okay

107
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,500
Go to the venue Badri mentioned

108
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Then tonight-

109
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,083
I'll take care, bro

110
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,292
I'll call you tonight

111
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,417
Okay

112
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,875
- Hi, Shiva
- Hi sir

113
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,083
- Good to see you...come
- Yes, sir

114
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,333
Shiva, client meeting tomorrow

115
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,917
We really need this client

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,333
It's all in your hands

117
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,458
Don't worry, sir
I'll handle it

118
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,417
Clinch this deal successfully

119
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,333
I'll ensure you to go to the US
and organize everything

120
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,667
Thank you

121
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,042
Shall we meet for lunch?

122
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,167
Sorry, sir

123
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,625
- I have to meet my dad today
- Okay

124
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,750
Hello, professor sir

125
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,292
- It's missing
- What...?

126
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,458
This one

127
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:08,625
It's missing

128
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,958
- Oh! Shoe, huh?
- Hahn, shoe...shoe

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,875
Where do you want to go now?

130
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,125
Have to go to college

131
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,417
It's been 2 years since you retired!

132
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,042
You've forgotten everything

133
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,625
That's why you are under our care now

134
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,167
[muttering Gayatri mantra]

135
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,375
Sit here

136
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,625
'May that Divine Light protect us
and illuminate our consciousness'

137
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,667
You haven't forgotten your mantras

138
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,667
'I meditate upon that effulgent light true
Let that light kindle, illumine me too'

139
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,000
Johnny...?

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,542
Are you tired?

141
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,667
Do you want to have breakfast?

142
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,792
You're okay?

143
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,417
This is my husband Johnny

144
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,375
He has fractured his leg

145
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh...!

146
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,833
Maria, how did your husband
fracture his leg?

147
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,167
Scooter

148
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,375
Ah...he fell off his scooter

149
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,625
Where did Johnny work?

150
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,542
- Railways
- Hmmm...good!

151
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,417
How many children do you have?

152
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,458
1 daughter

153
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,625
No...!

154
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,083
You have 2 sons

155
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,208
2 sons

156
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,292
Johnny...?

157
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,042
Are you okay, Johnny?

158
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,250
Are you feeling tired?

159
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,917
Hi, Mr. Govindharajan-

160
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,625
I've already informed
Please wait for 5 minutes

161
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,667
Where is the swimming pool?

162
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,125
- Cheenu...!
- My friends are waiting there

163
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,833
Can you just tell me the way?

164
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,000
'Call the manager
I'll talk to him'

165
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,750
'Is this how you treat a guest?'

166
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,208
'I asked you how to go to the pool
and you're royally ignoring me'

167
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,125
I have an important job in the pool

168
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,083
- I must go, swim and meet my friends
- Please attend to him

169
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,292
Mr Krishna...?

170
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,958
We don't have a pool here

171
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,208
What do you mean?

172
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,250
This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel

173
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,833
This is not a hotel

174
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,542
Care centre

175
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:12,833
And you've already showered this morning

176
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,917
Really...?

177
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,250
Where did you go?

178
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:19,042
Mrs Sarada was creating such a ruckus

179
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,458
Before I could placate her...

180
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,167
...he walked out with his towel

181
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,708
Okay, take him with you

182
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,917
Come with me, sir

183
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,708
'My friends are waiting
near the swimming pool'

184
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,500
'- Let them wait there
- How mean!'

185
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,500
It's around 6 months
since you visited last, right?

186
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,125
I called you

187
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,542
In fact, I mailed you too

188
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,625
I think you must have been busy

189
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,875
Why, any problem?

190
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,458
I've been paying promptly

191
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,542
No...no

192
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,750
- It isn't about payment
- 1 second

193
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,958
Yes, the same mail

194
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,250
I'll just call you back

195
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,875
Yeah...bye

196
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,542
- Will he take some time?
- He'll be here now

197
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,208
- Are you taking him out anywhere?
- Yes, I need to buy him clothes

198
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,167
I'm leaving to U.S in 3 months

199
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,833
Don't know when I'll come back

200
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,292
In the last 6 months
his condition has deteriorated

201
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,667
He's unable to remember anything new

202
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,042
In fact Shiva, Thilaka

203
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,042
- Only these 2 names
- 1 second

204
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,208
Yes?

205
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
That's the mail
I was talking about

206
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,708
- Sorry
- So in his present condition

207
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
He needs daily monitor-

208
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,417
Money is not an issue at all
Do whatever needs to be done

209
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,167
No, it's not about money

210
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,833
How much longer will it
take for dad to come?

211
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,167
5 minutes

212
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,250
Govind uncle...?

213
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,542
Did you eat your breakfast?

214
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,833
I have to drop Shiva

215
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,458
No need
Shiva is here

216
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,833
Come with me

217
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,625
Look who's here

218
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,042
Your son, Shiva

219
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,875
Tomorrow amma has to go for chemo

220
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,417
Balu will come

221
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:12,833
Where's Balu?

222
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,375
Shiva will take you out now

223
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,750
Will you go with him?

224
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,042
Be careful with your ID card

225
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,292
Come, pa

226
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,750
Shiva...?

227
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,917
Be careful

228
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,292
- He should be within your sight
- It's okay, I'll take care

229
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,292
Note down the time, sir

230
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,708
Contact number

231
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,042
Appa

232
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,292
Please wait

233
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,458
Here, sir

234
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,667
Thank you, sir

235
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,583
- Come, pa
- Who are you?

236
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,333
Come along, dad

237
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,333
Appa?

238
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,083
We're going on a shopping spree

239
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,583
Why buy new...

240
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,542
...clothes for me?

241
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,208
For your mother

242
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,625
...we must get her a saree

243
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,833
Maroon is Thilaka's favorite color

244
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,625
Where's your mother?

245
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,500
She passed away 4 years ago

246
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,958
You forgot about it

247
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,458
How...?

248
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,792
How...?

249
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,583
Cancer...!

250
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,958
Where was I then?

251
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,708
Thilaka isn't dead

252
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,292
She's alive

253
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,417
It should've been delivered yesterday

254
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,667
Right

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,250
Please check again

256
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,958
Dad, what are you doing here?

257
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,542
Come with me

258
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,208
Please come

259
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,167
Life is beautiful

260
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,125
Sir, I have to check your bag

261
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,500
Open your bag

262
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,792
1 minute

263
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,667
What is this, dad?

264
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,500
Shiva has a flair for drawing

265
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,500
- That's why
- Stop it!

266
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,708
- Security
- Sir...?

267
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,208
- Tell me, sir
- Take the bags from the trunk

268
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,958
Get down, pa

269
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,875
I've some urgent work to do

270
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,583
I'll meet you again
before I leave for Mumbai

271
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,500
Take care, pa

272
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,833
Clothes can be bought for 6 months

273
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,250
Will anyone buy oranges for 6 months?

274
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,042
Sir...?

275
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,583
Sir...!

276
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,583
Sir...?

277
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,750
Govind sir

278
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,458
- Will you come home early today?
- Why...?

279
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,250
Didn't I tell you about
the alliance we saw?

280
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,708
The groom's mother called me
They want to come home this evening

281
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,417
- He's a doctor
- Is that so?

282
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,333
- Yes, dear
- Orthopaedic surgeon

283
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,417
Owns a big hospital in Anna Nagar

284
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,833
He is doing very well

285
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,125
That's right

286
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,250
These days when people fall sick

287
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,625
...they google online

288
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,167
Go to a pharmacy
and self medicate

289
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,292
But...

290
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,875
...if it's a fracture
no other go

291
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,875
The patient has to go to a hospital

292
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,708
Will you please be quiet?

293
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,292
Shall I serve something?

294
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,583
- Hello?
- 'Hello, doctor'

295
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,500
Our Govind is missing, doctor

296
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,583
Whaaaat...?

297
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,375
He must be there
Ask our staff to search

298
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,750
I'll come right away

299
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,500
- Okay...okay
- Finish your lunch, dear

300
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,000
It's an emergency, a patient is missing
I must go immediately, ma

301
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,667
Archana...Archana
This is a very good alliance

302
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,292
Compatible in every way

303
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:04,125
They don't expect anything from us
Just help maintain their hospital

304
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,708
That's the hidden agenda!

305
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,875
Then ask them to find
a graduate in accountancy!

306
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,833
This won't work out, ma

307
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,833
Is this a hospital or recreation club?
Where’s my father?

308
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,375
Shiva, please calm down

309
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,625
You’re incapable of
taking care of a patient, huh?

310
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,042
How irresponsible all of you are

311
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:20,833
Shiva, please

312
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,833
Shut up! I pay you
to take care of my father

313
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,208
Call yourself a doctor?

314
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,167
- You are being rude unnecessarily
- I like that

315
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,583
I’ll make sure
this ends your career

316
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,458
What-

317
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,417
Shiva

318
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,292
Shiva, please
Wait a second

319
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,208
You want to apologize, huh?

320
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,958
Why should I apologize to you?

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You didn’t know to take good care
of him when you took him out

322
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,583
You didn’t know to bring him
safe and sound back to our care

323
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,292
You didn’t know it was wrong to leave him
with our security and not even look back

324
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,250
Your father may not be important to you

325
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:52,167
You may have 101 issues with him

326
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,583
Every patient is important to us

327
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,792
Very important

328
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,667
I don’t know if you’ll go
to the cops or court

329
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,625
Or search for your father
It’s your wish

330
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,875
We’ll call you when we find him

331
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:45,625
“In a world where men seek God religiously
he is searching for a manso anxiously”

332
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:53,708
“In a world where men seek God devotedly
he is searching for a managitatedly”

333
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:59,292
“A human being so humane
He is looking for that man in vain”

334
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,167
“Will he be found in this world I wonder”

335
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:05,167
“Will he be elsewhere I ponder”

336
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,958
“Will he be found in this world here?”

337
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,833
“Or a totally different world or sphere?”

338
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:16,750
“While searching for his father dear
why does he delve within him deeper?”

339
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,833
“In the process of this self exploration
they forgot their original mission”

340
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:51,833
“One who hoards and locks his wealth
wants to add to his millions in stealth”

341
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:57,917
“The millionaire who has amassed as such;
he is seeking power, politics and overmuch”

342
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:03,500
“One who has lived life to the fullest
wants to climb to the next rung in earnest”

343
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:09,000
“One who has reached the peak of fame
wants to achieve more laurels to his name”

344
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:14,958
“To keep seeking has become
the name of the game”

345
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,333
“Most of the time in a man’s lifespan
spent searching as much as he can”

346
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:26,083
“On earth that God almighty descended
searching for a kind heart contented”

347
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,292
“His wish didn’t come true as intended”

348
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:04,375
“Where is the man care-free
living like the wind without a worry?”

349
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:10,083
“Here is a man whose intention
is to clamor for attention”

350
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:15,792
"Where are the very few
who are kind and true?"

351
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:21,125
"Vengeful hearts you find
are the ones left behind"

352
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:27,167
"Saying ‘we have no one'
we don’t have anyone"

353
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:32,583
"Since a child every mother gives birth
is a gift from God on this earth"

354
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:38,125
“O’ man, stop being tired and weary
search for peace on the contrary”

355
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,125
That’s God’s sign of glory

356
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:47,458
“In a world where men seek God spiritually
he is searching for a man spiritedly”

357
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:53,458
“A human being so humane
He is looking for that man in vain”

358
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,542
- Hey! Give me
- Yes, bro

359
00:23:59,083 --> 00:23:59,708
Here, bro

360
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,250
What’s this place?

361
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,542
It was a library
Now it’s locked

362
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,500
Okay, bro

363
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:13,500
- I have a long term wish
- To buy an iPhone?

364
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:17,917
You should do the ordering
and I should kill someone

365
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,833
How long will we work for this Guna sir?

366
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,625
Hey! If you talk ill of Guna bro-

367
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,375
I’m not deriding him

368
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,500
I was penniless and stranded
in the middle of a road

369
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,250
If I’m riding a bike today
I owe it all to him

370
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:31,750
I should be loyal to him and
carry out his orders, that’s all

371
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,167
I don’t have any personal desires

372
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,667
You should be the same way too

373
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,833
- Eat now
- Okay, bro

374
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,125
Why couldn’t you shut the gate
and then watch the match, Shiva?

375
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,792
Is the match in our favor?

376
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:18,833
Kohli got out

377
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,708
Rohit Sharma is batting well

378
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:26,000
I stopped watching cricket
afterSachin Tendulkar retired

379
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,250
What kind of game is it nowadays!

380
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,833
Okay, where did you go?

381
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:35,375
Balu and I want to
start a tuition center

382
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,708
- So I'm running from pillar to post
- Why?

383
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:43,542
Because I spent all my savings
building this house

384
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,417
After that, you said you wanted to
go to the U.S after you graduate

385
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:52,750
Whatever I had saved for you
covered your mother’s hospital expense

386
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:56,417
Now your mother is a framed photo
and the house is mortgaged!

387
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,083
Why all this now?

388
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,750
You’re still trying to go abroad

389
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,083
Life is beautiful

390
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,042
You should have started this long ago

391
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,167
Didn’t Devaraj sir ask you then?

392
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,625
He did

393
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,208
I thought I won't be able
 to spend time with my family

394
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,500
Appa, so many fathers from
a middle class background

395
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:24,625
…unable to fulfil their children’s wishes
come up with some random excuses

396
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,125
You don’t have to bend backward for me

397
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,542
I’ll handle it myself

398
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,708
Okay, fine

399
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,500
I dropped a gentleman here

400
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,250
He went in to bring the cash

401
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,792
I’ve been waiting for 10 minutes

402
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,125
- Is that so?
-Yes, sir

403
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,333
- 1minute
- Okay, sir

404
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,833
Dad, did you come by auto?

405
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,667
What’s wrong with you?

406
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,917
You made the auto driver wait outside
and happily sitting here and painting?

407
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,583
Poor man!
He’s been waiting

408
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,292
Where is it?

409
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:37,292
Hey! Shiva
It’s missing, did you see it?

410
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:42,875
- See what?
- Aiyo! This…this

411
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:43,625
Watch?

412
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,833
Watch?

413
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:48,667
Can’t you say ‘watch’?
What’s up with you?

414
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,000
Your mother gifted it to me

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,708
It’s missing
Did you take it?

416
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:56,333
Why will I take your watch?

417
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:44,292
Appa! Why did you put
your watch in the ‘dosa’ batter?

418
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,542
APPA!

419
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,833
I’ll tell you 3 words now

420
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:04,958
Pay attention

421
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,208
Orange

422
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,208
Train

423
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,125
Bottle

424
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,083
Repeat

425
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,500
Orange, train, bottle

426
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,708
What’s the date today?

427
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,500
7th...18th

428
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:19,833
Month?

429
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,958
Doctor, what are you testing me for?

430
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,583
1st answer and then I’ll tell you

431
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,417
Spell ‘water’

432
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,417
w-a-t-e-r
Water

433
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,542
Spell it in reverse

434
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,000
R..

435
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:45,667
t-e-r

436
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,167
R-e-t

437
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:53,417
Okay, now tell me
the 1st 3 words I told you

438
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,458
1st word was a fruit

439
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:01,958
O…orange

440
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,583
Good
Next?

441
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,083
Orange-

442
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,250
Orange

443
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,667
Orange

444
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,417
What’s wrong with me, doctor?

445
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:36,625
MrGovind, you are suffering
from Alzheimer’s disease

446
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,458
Beginning stage

447
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:44,833
Your memories will fade step by step

448
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,167
This is beginning stage

449
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,292
First he will have
short term memory loss

450
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:53,292
Then he will slowly forget everything

451
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,292
As it worsens he will be
devoid of any memories

452
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,250
Care is very important

453
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:09,458
As a family, friends to rally him around
support system is very essential

454
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,917
Is there any other way to cure him?

455
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:14,375
Permanent cure hasn’t been found as yet

456
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,833
‘But we can slow down the process
with the help of medicines’

457
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,500
‘That’s all we can do’

458
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,708
He will be frustrated
when he loses his memory

459
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,292
You shouldn’t send him alone anywhere
because he won’t know

460
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,417
...where he is
or what he is doing

461
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:31,792
‘You must take care of him like a child’

462
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,000
Your role is very important

463
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,292
You took your tablets?

464
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,500
Yes, I did

465
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,083
I get this irritation
towards the evening

466
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,125
It’s called sun-

467
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,917
Sun downing

468
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,625
I read about it

469
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,208
Appa I have some good news

470
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,708
- What?
- I’ve got a promotion

471
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:13,083
Wow! Congratulations!

472
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,292
But the posting is in Mumbai

473
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,417
I have also agreed

474
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,750
Good! What a golden opportunity

475
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,417
You must go
Good…good

476
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,417
Only thing is new place
Be a little tough to adjust

477
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,417
I know Hindi
I can adjust easily

478
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,000
No, dad, in your condition

479
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:30,417
You won’t fit into
this new atmosphere

480
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,208
I have to stay with a colleague

481
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,708
I’ll hunt for a house much later

482
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,625
In a way you’re right

483
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,667
You go and settle down

484
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,750
I’ll be fine

485
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,250
Balu is there
if I need anything

486
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,042
No, pa, you need
24 hours supervision

487
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,417
You should take
your tablets regularly

488
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,000
Nutritious…proper food
you have to take

489
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:02,000
I found a health care center on ECR road

490
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,833
It’s a specialty center for patients
like you with Alzheimer’s

491
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,042
Very serene place

492
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,667
24 hours doctors
and nurses are on call

493
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,250
Good food at proper timings

494
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,833
I’m sure you’ll find it
really comfortable

495
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,000
Pa, don’t worry

496
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,000
I’ll visit you regularly

497
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,583
I’m doing this for your own good

498
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,625
Hope you underst-

499
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,542
Shiva…?

500
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:38,292
1 second, pa

501
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,750
‘Hello, yeah?
Speaking’

502
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,500
It’s a good place

503
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:19,833
Even I feel like staying here

504
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,667
Who are you?

505
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,375
Balu…Balu, da

506
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:31,667
Ba-

507
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:33,250
Balu!

508
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:37,500
Did you get scared?

509
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,208
Idiot!

510
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,625
- Useless fellow
- I might ask you in the future

511
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,250
Hey! How can you say that?

512
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,292
Won’t you visit me often?

513
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,083
Definitely

514
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:55,083
Come as long as I can
recognize you, enough

515
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,500
Appa

516
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,917
Don’t worry, Shiva
I’ll be alright

517
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,625
See you

518
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,833
Then listen, next time you’re here

519
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:21,750
…if I’ve forgotten you,
you shouldn’t hold it against me

520
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,500
Let’s go

521
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,500
Don’t lose hope, Shiva

522
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,875
I’ve roamed all the streets
you can think of, uncle

523
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,250
Knowing it was my carelessness

524
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,958
…I feel like killing myself

525
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,333
Shiva, do you know once he said
these very same words to me

526
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,167
…and cried his heart out?

527
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,833
You must have been 3 or 3+ then

528
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,667
We had gone to the beach

529
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,167
It was jam packed
You were missing

530
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,083
We ran helter-skelter looking for you

531
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,000
It took us 1 hour to find you

532
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,500
The trauma he went through
that 1 hour, I can still remember

533
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:33,708
He cried his heart out and
uttered these very same words to me

534
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,708
After that, for quite some time

535
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,833
…you know, wherever he went
he’ll carry you only on his shoulder

536
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:51,167
Did you hear anything?

537
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,125
Not till now

538
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:57,917
Shiva, shall we give
a police complaint imemdiately?

539
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,250
- What, bro?
- You change the license plate

540
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,958
- I'll be right back
- Again...?

541
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,542
Just carry out my orders

542
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,042
Yes, bro
All okay

543
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,708
- We'll go in another half hour
- Be careful, Ranga

544
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,083
Don't worry
 I'll take care

545
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,750
I'll call when I'm done

546
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,083
- Hello...?
- Maadhuuuu

547
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,583
Why are you calling me
at this unearthly hour?

548
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,000
What are you up to?

549
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:06,250
It will get messy
if I share it with you

550
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,583
Had dinner, sweetheart?

551
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,083
Will you ask me
in the middle of the night?!

552
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,708
- Are you mad or what?
- Don't be mad at me!

553
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,708
- Okay, tell me
- You wanted an iPhone, right?

554
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,125
Hello...?

555
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,500
Their network will be fine
only in their commercials!

556
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,083
Haven't I told you not to
 talk to that jinxed female?

557
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,292
As if you need love now

558
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:29,333
Until our job is done
don't call her

559
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,958
If you do, I'll bury you as well

560
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,125
Even if you bury me underground
the love buried in my heart-

561
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,083
I'll clobber you
Go and shut the door

562
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,542
He'll help only his friends

563
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,792
Who are you?
What is your crime?

564
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,583
Nothing, sir, I tried
 my hand at organic farming

565
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,292
And your men arrested me, sir

566
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,500
Organic farming?

567
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,625
With great difficulty
I used natural manure

568
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,917
- And grew a few marijuana plants
- Marijuana...?

569
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,208
Farmers like me have no protection

570
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,792
I'll clobber you!

571
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,458
I'll pound you to a pulp, rascal

572
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:13,792
Yes?

573
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,375
Sir, we want to complain
about a missing person

574
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:20,208
Haven't I told you to add
 less sugar in my tea? Jackass!

575
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,667
What did you say?

576
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,917
Complain about
a missing person

577
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:29,042
- Tell me the name
- Govindharajan, age 60

578
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,333
You don't look that old!

579
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,667
I'm telling you details
of the missing person

580
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,208
1st tell your name

581
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,500
Shiva

582
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:40,917
Sir, his father went missing from
the Care centre on ECR around 3:00 p.m

583
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,417
What did you say the name is?

584
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,000
- Shiva
- Hello...!

585
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,750
Give me the missing person's name

586
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,833
That's what I told you

587
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,042
Govindharajan, age 60

588
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,292
Losing your cool?

589
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,000
That too in a police station!

590
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,875
You get bugged to mention
your father's name twice?!

591
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,042
Did he go missing or
walked out in a huff?

592
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,583
He's an Alzheimer's patient

593
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,708
Like this memory loss

594
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,000
I've heard about it

595
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:03,958
He's been missing since this afternoon

596
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,333
Do you know where he went?

597
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,917
If we knew that
won't we bring him back?

598
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,625
Do you have any photo of him?

599
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Your contact address, phone number

600
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,542
Record it and sign here

601
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,083
Tell your husband not to lose
his temper here, as if it's his house!

602
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,042
Sir, we aren't a couple

603
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,458
- I'm a doctor at the Care centre
- Sorry

604
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,625
Sir, he lost his cool
 because he's tense

605
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,208
Don't take it amiss please

606
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,458
As if we aren't tense

607
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,375
There was a protest whole day
and I came back just now

608
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,292
Try standing in the sun all day
Then you'll know!

609
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:44,750
Daily you know how many cases of missing
father, mother, politician I deal with?

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,833
Okay, I'll inform the control room

611
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,750
You keep searching also

612
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,375
Bear this in mind

613
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:58,208
You may have to come to
a hospital, mortuary now and then

614
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,792
If we get any information...

615
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,375
...I'll call you

616
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,458
Thank you, sir

617
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,125
Doctor...?

618
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,750
My name is Archana

619
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,750
Okay...I'm sorry, Archana

620
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:16,958
For what?

621
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,042
I was too harsh on you this afternoon

622
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,625
It's okay

623
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,333
Shiva, you get angry very easily

624
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,542
This isn't the time to lose your temper

625
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,750
Your dad says this to me often

626
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:28,958
Inside every person-

627
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,958
I know, black dog
and white dog, right?

628
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:34,417
I've heard it many times

629
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,625
Moron! How many times
I've told you about her?

630
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,542
Lured by her fair skin, huh?

631
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,833
Bro, in this country they will guess
your caste by the color of your skin!

632
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:48,083
That's why I want to marry her
 and change my lineage

633
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,417
You are beyond redemption!

634
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:54,000
Even in films if you see, bro
last week I watched a horror film

635
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,833
Heroine was very fair

636
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,708
After she dies she haunts as a spirit

637
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,208
She's dark skinned then
How is that possible?

638
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,208
Angels are fair
Ghosts are dark

639
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:03,833
Has the director seen a ghost?

640
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,208
It isn't like that

641
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,875
Fair skinned people are ghosts when alive

642
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,625
If dark skinned they are ghosts
after they die, that's all

643
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,042
Super, bro

644
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:14,000
- Get me water
- I didn't know this

645
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:17,000
They've made too many horror films
and insulted spirits

646
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,625
No one will get spooked
even if they see a ghost

647
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,375
Even kids find horror films funny
instead of cartoons

648
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,208
- I want water
- Aiyo! Ghost

649
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,250
Bro...!

650
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,542
Hello?

651
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,208
Sir...?

652
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,833
Aiyaiyo! Don't know what happened

653
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,333
Bro, it's an accident
I think the driver is dead

654
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,042
Bro, it's our vehicle
I'll take care

655
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,708
- Is anyone inside?
- No, sir

656
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,500
How can you say there's no one inside?

657
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,667
- Don't open
- Shiva!

658
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:10,292
Bro-

659
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,542
Call the ambulance, Shiva

660
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,125
Your mother is unwell

661
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,958
Mother...where?

662
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,542
It hurts real bad

663
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,292
I can't bear the pain

664
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,583
I'll call the ambulance
I'll be back

665
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:28,750
Where's the phone?

666
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:57,958
Yov!

667
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,333
Bro...?

668
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,583
Bro...get up

669
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,000
Anna?

670
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,792
Dai, who are these people?

671
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,625
- The thing is
- Where's the body?

672
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:37,667
Before I could shift him
I saw another car

673
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,708
You moron!
What have you done?

674
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,000
Go back

675
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,458
Stop the car
Right here

676
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,750
Hey, you stay here

677
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,958
If you mess it up-

678
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:26,792
If Guna bro gets to know
he'll kill us and dump our ashes in the sea

679
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:34,000
Take their phones
I'll be back

680
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,708
Such a small task
and you messed it up!

681
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,542
Give me some time
I'll somehow-

682
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,000
Don't be daft

683
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,750
By now the cops would've
rounded up all the rowdies

684
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,708
1st hide somewhere safe

685
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:46,750
Okay, sir

686
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,375
Where's your phone?

687
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,875
Don't you have a phone?

688
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,250
Who are you?

689
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,042
Where did you come from?

690
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,667
What to do with those 2 men?

691
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,417
1st find a good hiding place

692
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,750
After that kill them both

693
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's discuss the rest tomorrow morning

694
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,042
Okay, sir

695
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,417
Dai...stop!

696
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:24,792
Aiyo!

697
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,250
Ouch!

698
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,000
Janaki...Janu...how did I come here?

699
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,458
It all seems like a dream

700
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,583
I was wondering
if I'll ever see you again

701
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,667
Yesterday, 2 killers

702
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,875
...took turns targeting my head
 I fainted and fell down

703
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,250
One of them...

704
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,167
...I dreamt he stabbed me with a knife

705
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,917
I want 1 more 'dosa'

706
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,375
'Sambar' is very tasty

707
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,083
Your daughter made it?

708
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,542
Shiva is busy, he'll be back on Sunday

709
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,042
If he likes the girl,
we'll finalise this alliance

710
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,458
Hello, what do you mean?

711
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,917
She's my wife!

712
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,417
Thanks, sis

713
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,000
Come here

714
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,250
What's happening here?

715
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,750
Making 'dosa' for them
as if they are your family

716
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,208
How dare you ask me!

717
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,375
Last night I called you at 2:00 a.m

718
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:01,125
Some fellow said 'your husband met
with a small accident, nothing serious'

719
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,917
He asked me for our address

720
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,792
And I told him

721
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,500
Oh my dear!
What happened to him?

722
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,917
- Lock the gate, Shiva
- Where's the bedroom?

723
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,917
- Which is his room?
- Over there

724
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,917
What happened?
Oh my gawd!

725
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,667
Only then I knew
they were rowdies!

726
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,333
Hand over your phone

727
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,292
You shouldn't utter a single word

728
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:29,333
I don't want to hear even a whisper

729
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,458
If you think of being over smart
I'll kill your whole family

730
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,083
Go

731
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,708
- Where's that man's phone?
- Here, bro

732
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,625
Give me your phone
Take it out

733
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,917
Whom will I call?

734
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,667
Then why do you need it?!

735
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,417
Go and check on the old man

736
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,333
You'll be drunk as a skunk
and puke in our hall

737
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,208
I'll clean it up
because it's my fate!

738
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,542
If you bring home thugs
what will I do?

739
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,917
You're making 'dosas,' right?

740
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:59,208
- Hold your tongue!
- Did I bring them?

741
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,375
Janu, listen
Don't cry

742
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,875
I'll somehow convince them to leave

743
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,458
What if they still don't go?

744
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,333
Make your usual 'sambar' for lunch

745
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,500
They'll eat and
leave once for all

746
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,125
Sir...1 minute

747
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,583
My name is Rajappa

748
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,875
This is my wife Janaki

749
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:36,250
I work in the sugar factory nearby
as the Purchase manager

750
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,125
We are a middle class family, sir

751
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:41,417
We borrowed money and paid
heavy interest to build this house

752
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:43,167
We are lower middle class now!

753
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,708
I don't mind telling you

754
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:48,958
When our PM announced at 8:00 p.m
1000 rupee notes won't be valid anymore...

755
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,958
...I was laughing until 8:30 p.m

756
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,708
All I had was only two 100 rupee notes

757
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,792
Sir, my wife and son are with me

758
00:49:57,792 --> 00:50:00,417
Doesn't speak well
if other men also stay here

759
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,042
I won't inform anyone

760
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,208
Police, CBI

761
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:07,708
Whoever questions me, I'll say that blow
 to my head made me forget everything

762
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,417
[loud hiccup]

763
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,792
Water

764
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,958
We are in this soup
because you asked for water

765
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,792
Otherwise we would've buried
that body and safely-

766
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:18,625
What does he mean?

767
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,208
- Why are you interrogating me?
- I'm scared

768
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,667
Zip your lips

769
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:26,917
Shiva...?

770
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,000
Cut apple for your mother

771
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Hey, get up

772
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,792
I've been watching you
Are you making fun?

773
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:36,125
I'll strangle you

774
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,458
What-

775
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,667
Did you fall down again, Shiva?

776
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:44,000
It's okay

777
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,875
You can't learn to ride a cycle
without falling down

778
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,500
Amma...?

779
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,292
Who are these strange men, ma?

780
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,875
He's your grandfather

781
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,208
He's your uncle

782
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:12,417
Then who is he?

783
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:13,458
He is-

784
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,750
We haven't identified him as yet!

785
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,458
Shiva, check if this is okay

786
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,583
Shall we add a cash reward?

787
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,875
Good idea!

788
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,792
Add 1 more line 'cash reward'

789
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,917
Take a printout immediately, okay?

790
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,917
How do I find my dad
 in such a big city?

791
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,708
Shiva, there's no other choice

792
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,583
We must be positive
 we'll find him and search

793
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:58,208
Doctor, when will John become alright?

794
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,875
In 1 week
he should be fine

795
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:03,250
Next month we are planning
to go to Kashmir

796
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,125
John's 50th birthday!

797
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:07,250
Oh! He'll be fine by then

798
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,375
- Don't worry
- Thanks

799
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,542
Say thank you

800
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:12,208
Bye

801
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:17,833
- Both husband and wife have Alzheimer’s?
- No...no

802
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,375
Only Maria

803
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:21,708
The wheel chair patient
isn't even her husband

804
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,167
His name is Ramu
He's another patient here

805
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:28,500
The man who accompanies her always
He's her husband, Johnny

806
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,667
Imagine how I felt
when it all started

807
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,208
Shocked by my answer?

808
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,792
Maria doesn't remember
her husband Johnny

809
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,333
Don't know why

810
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,500
But she thinks Ramu is her husband

811
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,542
She'll behave like that
even in front of him

812
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,208
Johnny is a great man

813
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,167
Maria doesn't recognise him

814
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,875
Even then he'll come daily
and spend time with her

815
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,417
That's very important, Shiva

816
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,958
When I see all this,
I feel even more guilty

817
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,167
Shiva, nothing wrong about
leaving your dad here

818
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,708
You washed your hands off, right?

819
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,000
That's wrong

820
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,500
Very true, Archana

821
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:09,125
Even if this Care centre
provides all the comforts...

822
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:11,958
...I realize the importance
 of family ties

823
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,250
When Maria mentioned about
his birthday, I remembered

824
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:19,375
Last year we celebrated
your dad's birthday

825
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:20,958
I had mailed you that video too

826
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,583
Did you watch it?

827
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,208
Maybe you were busy!

828
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,458
What are you so deep in thought, Shiva?

829
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,833
I was thinking about Maria's journey

830
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:44,708
How long has Mr Ram been here?

831
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,542
Around 1 year

832
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,250
He has a son

833
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,083
He admitted him here, that's it

834
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,375
After that he has never showed up

835
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,458
We tried persuading him to visit

836
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,917
'I'm sending money
Your duty is to take care'

837
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:23,083
“Won’t eyes that sift and sieve see
the person they seek intensely?”

838
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:33,625
“Won’t hurried feet running to and fro
reach the right place instantly somehow?”

839
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:43,458
“Clouds in pursuit of the sky wander around
They shower rain searching for the ground”

840
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:49,042
“Isn’t that a puzzle so profound?”

841
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:54,542
“Eyes that sift and sieve”

842
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:59,667
“Seek to perceive”

843
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:33,667
“Without pursuit
life doesn’t exist”

844
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:39,000
"We came to search readily
but blind as a bat really"

845
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:44,083
“Like the roots underground relish
searching for water to nourish”

846
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:49,333
“We walked across
though our paths criss-cross”

847
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:53,958
“In this quest so helpless
meeting many a stranger hapless”

848
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:59,750
“Won’t the blowing breeze
say so please?”

849
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:04,875
“To a lovely lullaby dainty flowers dance”

850
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:09,958
“Won’t the pleasure of pursuit enhance?”

851
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,417
“Won’t the rainbow hues 7 innate
shining from heaven be adequate?”

852
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,958
“Won’t this quest end on a happy note?”

853
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:28,458
“Won’t eyes that sift and sieve see
the person they seek intensely?”

854
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:39,042
“Won’t hurried feet running to and fro
reach the right place instantly somehow?”

855
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,083
Sir…?

856
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,792
- Are you Mr Ram’s son?
- Yes

857
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,667
Your father is in a bad shape

858
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,208
So what?

859
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,958
You should visit him
now and then

860
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,208
Because you don’t
his health has deteriorated

861
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,542
Why should you be
bothered about him?

862
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,500
Do you work in that center?

863
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,167
No, but my dad is also an inmate

864
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:14,500
It isn’t enough just to
send money every month

865
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,667
You must visit him often

866
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,083
He doesn’t even recognize me
What do I gain by seeing him?

867
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,958
I’ve taken a loan
to admit him in that center

868
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,708
What more can I do?

869
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:25,292
I thought the same way too

870
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,208
But my father is now missing

871
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,667
I’m hunting high and low for him

872
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,875
He’s missing

873
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:31,708
Good riddance
Just let it be

874
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,417
How can you say this?

875
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,625
It’s his fate

876
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,792
What will you do
finding that madcap?

877
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,375
Nurturing tonnes of love within

878
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:29,333
The only bond which appears
 to be a foe is a father

879
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:33,250
I paid a hefty price
to get enlightened

880
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,083
I told you with good intentions
not wanting you to be in my shoes

881
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:41,083
Our lifespan is really short

882
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:44,500
Your father has crossed
¾ that time frame

883
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,917
Visit him whenever you can

884
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:49,000
Just half an hour
Try sitting with him

885
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,458
Then you’ll understand

886
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,583
I’m very sorry I hit you

887
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,667
Please understand
what I’m trying to say

888
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:11,792
‘Hi, I’m Seenu’

889
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,833
‘Johnny likes cake’

890
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:24,833
‘I have never celebrated my birthday
ever since my wife passed away’

891
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:28,250
‘I don’t know if I will be
in a condition to do so next year’

892
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:31,417
‘Why are you getting sentimental?
Cut the cake, da’

893
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,042
‘Seenu, do a good job’

894
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:35,833
‘Okay, doctor’

895
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:38,875
‘They are going to cut the cake’

896
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:41,625
‘Uncle, wait
Make a wish and then cut’

897
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,333
'Okay'

898
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,792
'- What did you wish for?
- Tell us'

899
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,292
'What will I wish?'

900
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:57,667
'My son Shiva should-'

901
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,250
'- What did you wish for?
- Tell us'

902
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,875
'What will I wish?'

903
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,292
'My son Shiva should-'

904
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:23,625
I told you we can buy
a small apartment in the city

905
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,083
You were so stubborn
in wanting an independent house

906
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:30,458
The realtor who sold this plot claimed
a school and mall were planned nearby

907
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,333
…conveniently vanished into thin air

908
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:36,875
I have to bear the fuel charges of
the newspaper man, milkman who deliver

909
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:42,000
Now it has become a guest house
for murderers to stay when they are bored

910
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,500
My only fear is if they tell
all their thug-friends

911
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:49,083
And we have thugs from Rajasthan
following their footsteps

912
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,542
It’s a namesake independent house

913
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,083
But where is the independence?

914
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:57,083
Will they go away
if we offer them some money?

915
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,708
They don’t look that kind

916
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,958
Even your ‘sambar’
couldn’t chase them away!

917
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,667
I’m so terrified

918
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,333
What if they do something to me?

919
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,958
You have high hopes!

920
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:16,083
Grandpa, you shouldn’t
 color outside this line

921
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,292
It doesn’t even look like a horse now

922
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:36,792
Let him keep coloring
Shall we play ‘Snakes & ladders’?

923
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,417
I misplaced the coins

924
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,333
No big deal

925
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,000
I’ll find a way

926
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:47,417
Wait, I’ll be back

927
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,667
‘Police officer Sabapathy
who was missing has been murdered’

928
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:42,208
‘He was found dead in an abandoned tempo
in a desolate suburb of Chennai’

929
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,417
‘The police department
is now on a man hunt-‘

930
01:02:52,917 --> 01:02:53,833
Where are you?

931
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,167
In a safe place, bro

932
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,583
Stay put there till the problem dies down

933
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:58,875
What did you do to those 2 men?

934
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,458
I’ll do it…at the right time

935
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,917
Are you getting married or what?

936
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:05,208
Is this what I get
for having trusted you?

937
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,958
The issue has blown out of proportion

938
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,833
It’s all over the news
How can you be so irresponsible?

939
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,625
You’re mistaken, bro

940
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,458
Both of them are
not connected to this

941
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,208
Ranga, we can’t afford
to take any risk

942
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,500
Tell me if you can’t do
I’ll delegate someone else

943
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:22,750
No, bro
I’ll do it

944
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,292
- Call me once you are done
- Okay, bro

945
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:00,125
‘MISSING
Govindharaj, age 60’

946
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,958
Sir, I’m calling from
 Thiruvanmaiyur Police station

947
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,083
You had complained
about a missing person

948
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,750
We have found a body
resembling the photo you gave

949
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,208
Can you come up to
the mortuary and identify him?

950
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:23,125
Shiva

951
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:25,750
Shiva?

952
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:28,375
Shiva?

953
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:29,542
I’m up here, Archana

954
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:35,875
Shiva, what are you doing
with the front door wide ope-

955
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,292
I called you

956
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:43,958
You didn’t pick my call

957
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:46,500
I got worried
So I came to-

958
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:53,458
I can’t bear this, Archana

959
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,333
I have a 300 gm heart
like everyone else

960
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:01,250
If it has to carry a load
of 500 gm, what will I do?

961
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,417
My mom died of cancer

962
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:07,417
My dad has Alzheimer’s

963
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,333
What wrong did I do?

964
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,417
Why me?

965
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:17,083
I didn’t realize his value
when I was with him

966
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:22,625
I haven’t even spoken
to him properly

967
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,333
Not even called him ‘appa’ fondly

968
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:33,875
He will always ask me
‘Have you eaten?’

969
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:37,208
I’ve lost my temper
so many times

970
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:42,833
Now I don’t even know if he is eating

971
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,875
He doesn’t even know to say he’s hungry

972
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:02,417
You are a doctor
You would’ve seen many bodies

973
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:08,250
A man lying in a road accident
A body preserved in a mortuary

974
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,458
If I am asked to identify
if this man is my dad?

975
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,917
Height of cruelty, Archana

976
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,333
In this-

977
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,333
In this world

978
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:34,375
In this world only love is very important

979
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:39,208
No use pickling it inside

980
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:42,875
We should know
to be demonstrative

981
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:49,125
I swear I don’t know

982
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,417
Shiva, please

983
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,333
I understand your trauma

984
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:08,208
But this is not the time
You have to be strong

985
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:12,375
We have to search for him
in many places tomorrow

986
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,042
We must search

987
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:22,458
But I have realized this

988
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,208
You are looking for a missing person

989
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:32,333
But I have lost a dear one
and I’m searching for him

990
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:42,042
It’s alright, bro

991
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,292
This is no big deal

992
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:47,000
Hey! He’s wearing my t-shirt

993
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:50,250
He called me ‘akka’
and asked me affectionately

994
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,250
- So I gave it to him
- Are you his sister?

995
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,833
What’s for lunch, akka?

996
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,000
Oil cake and fodder!

997
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,333
Your husband is very funny

998
01:08:58,375 --> 01:08:59,208
Disgusting!

999
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:04,333
But if your father had a son
I’m sure he would’ve been like him

1000
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:07,333
His face looks like
a burnt down hut

1001
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:11,333
‘May you be blessed
with 100 springs in 1 lifetime’

1002
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:15,667
- Nothing serious, bro
- Shiva, does it hurt too much?

1003
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:19,042
I’ll give you a tablet
after you’ve eaten

1004
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:23,333
Hereafter I’ll be with you
when you learn to cycle, son

1005
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:36,833
Bro, is this man a mental case
or is he pretending to be one?

1006
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:39,833
Forgotten everything

1007
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:42,333
He lost his way and
somehow landed with us

1008
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:44,542
I think so too

1009
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,958
If he had borrowed money
all over the place…

1010
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,792
…his creditors will trace him come what may

1011
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,917
But if he is the one
who lent money and forgot

1012
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,958
…not a single soul
will hunt for him

1013
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,458
- Show, bro
- Enough

1014
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,292
Just a little bit more
I’m almost done, bro

1015
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:05,583
Go and check who it is

1016
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,167
Bro, police

1017
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,458
Police, huh?!

1018
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:21,708
I got a complaint
I came here to inquire

1019
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,292
I’ll handle it, sir

1020
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:26,042
Like Guna sir said

1021
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,542
And escape through the rear entry

1022
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,958
Don’t hesitate, bro

1023
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:31,583
Okay, sir
I’ll handle it

1024
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,833
How long will you take
to open the door?

1025
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,500
- What’s your problem?
- Nothing, sir

1026
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,583
I was in the loo
What’s the problem, sir?

1027
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:25,167
Day before yesterday, late at night
your wife filed a complaint you’re missing

1028
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:27,125
When I called back
phone was switched off

1029
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,083
I was patrolling this side
So I thought I’ll look in

1030
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,125
‘No one is at home’

1031
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,958
‘My wife has gone shopping
after dropping our son in school, sir’

1032
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:39,542
My friend hosted a party
That’s why I couldn’t pick your call

1033
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,750
Are you brainless or what?

1034
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,167
Will you call and disturb us
for such trivial issues?

1035
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,750
‘Do you think we are jobless?’

1036
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:47,083
‘Why do you drag us
into husband-wife squabbles?’

1037
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:48,125
Sorry, sir

1038
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:52,000
You said no one is at home
What was that noise?

1039
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:55,500
That’s an old fan I bought in OLX
It creaks now and then, sir

1040
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,625
‘Shiva…?’

1041
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,208
‘Shiva’

1042
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,000
‘Shiva’

1043
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:06,708
Good you came
I was the one who called

1044
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:10,000
Thilaka is not well
Has the ambulance arrived?

1045
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,125
Who are you?

1046
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:12,625
My father-in-law, sir

1047
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,667
He’s mentally unsound

1048
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:18,583
So when my wife goes out
she usually locks him inside

1049
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,750
Uncle, come
Sit down and relax

1050
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,583
Please come

1051
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,958
Yov! Don’t you know it’s wrong to
lock up an elderly person like this?

1052
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,083
I was feeling a bit unwell
I thought I’ll lie down

1053
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,917
He might wander away
leaving the door open, sir

1054
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,417
Sorry, sir

1055
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:40,125
We haven’t done anything unlawful

1056
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,292
I am a good man at heart

1057
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,000
Take a look

1058
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,542
Except Arvind Swami we have
 all the ‘Swamy’ photos

1059
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:47,167
My wife was a little impulsive

1060
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,083
That’s all, sir

1061
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,167
I don’t blame you

1062
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,833
Nowadays there’s no ground rule
for calling the police

1063
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:55,625
Last week a drunk stood on the phone tower
because his wife walked out

1064
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:56,958
That too in his briefs, loose!

1065
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,625
Then it might have come off!

1066
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,500
I meant our ‘madcap’!
Took us 3 hours to bring him down

1067
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,708
Your wife didn’t know
At least you could’ve called her

1068
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,667
…informed her you’ll be late
and you’re with friends, right?

1069
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,417
Sir, I’m sure you’re worldly wise

1070
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:14,167
Generally a wife never thinks high
of her husband’s friends

1071
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,708
How affectionate we are
with our wife’s friends

1072
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,000
They lack that equanimity

1073
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,417
Okay, fine

1074
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:27,000
There was a murder in this area
If you have any suspicion, call-

1075
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:28,792
Sir, I swear
I won’t disturb you

1076
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,375
I said call us

1077
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:33,083
- Sorry, sir
- Daft or what?

1078
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:56,875
“This very night long ago”

1079
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:01,125
I have travelled all over the world

1080
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,750
I have stayed in
all the 5 star hotels

1081
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:06,542
But only in this hotel
there’s no swimming pool

1082
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:09,292
Mr Krishnan
This isn’t a hotel

1083
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,000
Care center

1084
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,417
There isn’t any swimming pool here

1085
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,125
What do you mean?
Do you think I am an idiot?

1086
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,125
I’ll go to consumer court

1087
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,792
They are trying to con me

1088
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:20,083
‘What do they take me for?’

1089
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,750
Inspector called me
He wants to meet us right now

1090
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:26,292
- Why?
- ‘Johnny’

1091
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,375
- Johnny?
- Maria, please

1092
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:29,792
Doctor, where is my Johnny?

1093
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:32,167
Johnny is not well
So he’s resting

1094
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,167
I need to see him now

1095
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,375
I want to talk to him please
I want to meet Johnny

1096
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:38,167
- Doctor, please
- Maria, you can talk to him

1097
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,917
- No, this is not my Johnny
- Please calm down

1098
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,875
- I am Johnny
- Don’t touch

1099
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:47,167
Please, you go away
No, I want my Johnny

1100
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,292
You go…you go…you go

1101
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,458
‘Maria…!’

1102
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,125
I want my Johnny

1103
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:55,125
I want my Johnny
I love him

1104
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,292
Please move

1105
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,625
No, he is not my Johnny

1106
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,792
Maria, what are you doing?

1107
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:04,375
I want my Johnny

1108
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,042
Shiva, I’m coming back

1109
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:08,417
I want my Johnny please

1110
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:19,167
Hello, sir
I’m Shiva

1111
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,375
Mr Govindharaj’s son

1112
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:21,917
Oh! Hello

1113
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,167
Did you get any news about your father?

1114
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,125
Not yet, sir

1115
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:27,875
- We are searching day and night
- I'm sure you’ll find him

1116
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,500
I’ll also pray for him

1117
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:31,000
Thank you, sir

1118
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,833
I want to tell you something

1119
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:39,458
I haven’t studied human behavior as much as
 I've delved into computer and software

1120
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:43,958
But only when I meet someone like you
I regain my faith in humanity

1121
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,708
I learnt from you
about unconditional love

1122
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:54,417
This isn’t such a big feat, Shiva

1123
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,417
She’s the one who has
forgotten everything

1124
01:15:57,542 --> 01:16:00,208
I haven’t, hmm?

1125
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:07,333
Archana, I saw
 the birthday video you sent me

1126
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,958
But it was cut half way through

1127
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:10,625
What did my dad wish?

1128
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:15,917
He said, 'I want to find the right bride
for my son when my memory is still intact'

1129
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,750
He’ll keep harping
I should get married

1130
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,292
And keep sending me photos
of prospective brides

1131
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:23,083
Didn’t you like any of them?

1132
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,792
How can I decide
looking at a photo?

1133
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,792
Archana, sorry about last night

1134
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,792
I think I made you feel
really uncomfortable

1135
01:16:42,792 --> 01:16:43,875
It’s okay

1136
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:47,167
Generally I don’t get so drunk

1137
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:49,333
But I hope you understand

1138
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:52,167
What did you say, Shiva?

1139
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:57,000
This…this world

1140
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:00,917
Okay

1141
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,958
This car

1142
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:05,833
New car?

1143
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:09,083
I need to go looking all around, right?
So I borrowed my friend’s car

1144
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,625
Shiva, 1 minute

1145
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,125
Your dad drew this

1146
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:26,167
When he was new here
he said he would sketch me

1147
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,625
Still incomplete

1148
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:35,917
Archana, what’s happened to Mr Ramu

1149
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:38,042
He was gasping for breath last night

1150
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,917
We’ve admitted him in the hospital

1151
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:43,292
But something surprising happened

1152
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,917
His son came and
hasn’t left his bedside

1153
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:47,375
It’s like a miracle

1154
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,542
I just can’t believe it

1155
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:56,250
Good evening, sir

1156
01:17:56,292 --> 01:17:58,250
Hello, sir
Please take a seat

1157
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,750
Sit down, madam

1158
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:04,292
What would you like to drink?
Tea…coffee?

1159
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:06,125
- We are fine, sir
- Then juice it is

1160
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:08,417
Hey! 2 glasses of cool juice

1161
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,875
I've been getting calls from a minister
and IAS officers from last evening

1162
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,333
Regarding what, sir?

1163
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,042
Everything to do with your father

1164
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,792
Sir, I didn’t tell anyone

1165
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,417
I don’t know anyone in that level

1166
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,583
No…no, they are his old students

1167
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,917
They are placed well in society now

1168
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:27,792
They used their clout

1169
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:32,042
Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp
The buzz was instant all over the net

1170
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:34,083
Infact it’s trending online today

1171
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,792
That’s why I’ve asked
all my men to patrol all the areas

1172
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,167
Every single road

1173
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,833
We’ll somehow find your father, sir

1174
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:45,000
Hell-o
Yes, sir!

1175
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:46,500
Is that so, sir?

1176
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,000
I’m dealing with it right now, sir

1177
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:49,750
I’ll get my full force into this, sir

1178
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,250
We’ll find him, sir

1179
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:53,042
Yes, sir
Okay, sir

1180
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,792
Commissioner

1181
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,333
I believe even he is
your father’s old student

1182
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,917
Oh! Quite possible

1183
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,708
Actually the moment you complained

1184
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:09,042
From that second onwards
we are dealing only with your father’s case

1185
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:11,000
I haven‘t gone home
for the past 48 hours

1186
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,750
My wife yelled at me
But work is worship, right?

1187
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,708
Duty is important, huh?

1188
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,375
Thank you

1189
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:18,083
- Thank you, sir
- No mention

1190
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:21,292
The reason I called you is

1191
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:24,708
Suppose someone enquires
about this case to you

1192
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:27,958
…I’ll appreciate it if you tell them
we are dealing with it diligently

1193
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,667
Sure, sir

1194
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:29,625
Thank you so much

1195
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:32,292
By the way
my name is Thangaraj

1196
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,917
We’ll take leave then

1197
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:35,875
I swear he'll bring the juice for you

1198
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:37,167
It’s okay, sir
Thanks

1199
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:37,792
Okay

1200
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,250
You can call me anytime, sir

1201
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,375
Thank you, sir

1202
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,500
Thank you, sir

1203
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:44,792
2 juice cancelled, cool

1204
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:50,958
My dad has forgotten everything
But he lives in so many hearts!

1205
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:54,750
Hello?

1206
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:57,167
‘Sir, the man in the Missing poster
is with me now’

1207
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:57,792
Is that so?

1208
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:58,667
Yes, sir

1209
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:00,833
‘Yes, how much
is your cash reward?'

1210
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:04,625
Money isn’t a problem
Where did you find him?

1211
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:07,750
‘Bring 0.1 million and come
to the venue I ask you to’

1212
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:10,417
That’s okay, sir
How is he now?

1213
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:12,667
- ‘He is with me for the past 1 week’
- IDIOT!

1214
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:17,833
Sir, did you call me?
Thangaraj!

1215
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,875
He’s missing for just 2 days
If I get hold of you-

1216
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:26,375
Trying to swindle a man
who is traumatized

1217
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:28,083
Do you have any compassion?

1218
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,708
- Hello…hello?
- Shiva, please

1219
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:33,875
We’ve mentioned ‘cash reward’
This is bound to happen

1220
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,083
Such fellows-
Is he human at all?

1221
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:39,167
I got a call like this yesterday
He showed a lot of concern

1222
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:42,292
Then he said, ‘You have a lovely voice
You must look beautiful too’

1223
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,708
- And asked me out for coffee
- What did you reply?

1224
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,583
‘Your voice is lousy
You must be awful looking’

1225
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:50,250
‘I am not interested' I said
 and asked him to hang up

1226
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,458
Scumbags!

1227
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:53,417
Shiva, please

1228
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:03,167
You have a lovely voice
You look beautiful too

1229
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:06,250
Will you have a cup of coffee with me?

1230
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:43,417
Shiva, all of us have a black dog
and a white dog inside us

1231
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:50,167
Love, compassion, kindness
are virtues of the white dog

1232
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:57,625
Lies, rage, robbery, revenge
are vices of the black dog

1233
01:21:57,667 --> 01:22:03,500
These 2 dogs will always be
competing and fighting inside us

1234
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,667
Do you know which dog will win?

1235
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:11,125
Tell me, grandpa
Which dog will win?

1236
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,583
Tell me, grandpa

1237
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:19,875
He forgot

1238
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:25,667
We can perform a simple temple wedding
Then invite our guests for a get-together

1239
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:26,833
He thinks you’re the bride

1240
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,000
By all means, sir

1241
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:30,375
If you let me know the date
I’ll bring her myself

1242
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,667
I can even play the trumpet

1243
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:32,625
Will you stop it?

1244
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:34,000
- Correct
- Aiyo!

1245
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,375
I haven’t gone to work
for the past 3 days

1246
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,917
I haven’t even asked
leave of absence

1247
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:49,292
If you give my phone
I can report sick

1248
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,708
You can’t call now
Wait till bro nods an okay

1249
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,000
You shut up, ungrateful oaf!

1250
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:54,458
- Who is ungrateful?
- You

1251
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,958
You hit me on my head
when I called the ambulance

1252
01:22:57,042 --> 01:22:58,750
Don’t trust him
He will let you down

1253
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,125
Don’t shoot off your mouth

1254
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:02,083
- What the hell?
- How dare you deride me

1255
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,417
If you’re so grateful
sit in a corner, wag your tail

1256
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:05,542
‘You don’t know me’

1257
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:06,958
You can't even scare a child

1258
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,333
‘But you’re scared, right?’

1259
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,125
I'm sparing you
for my sister’s sake

1260
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:12,125
When did my wife
become your sister?

1261
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,333
What is your father’s name?
Your mother’s name?

1262
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,583
Tell me, I say
Tell me

1263
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,750
What’s the issue now?
You keep quiet

1264
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,333
Don’t trust him, sir

1265
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:21,500
He thrust a knife
on my nec-

1266
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,292
Akka, I think he’s a Hindi master!

1267
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,208
That’s Math, you moron

1268
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:02,125
When our house was being built

1269
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,917
...dad sold mom's jewelry
as we were short of cash

1270
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:07,917
He was so worried
That's why he painted her like this

1271
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:25,167
Wow...it's a nice one

1272
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:27,458
My dad din't draw this
Someone else did

1273
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,958
- Who?
- His name is Shiva!

1274
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,125
Really?

1275
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:34,875
Only useful skill
I learnt from my dad

1276
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:47,250
When I was a kid

1277
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:50,667
...I got so fed up of drawing on paper
I didn't spare a single wall

1278
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,833
My mom gave me
one hard blow on my back

1279
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:57,333
My dad said, 'why have you
 left this wall empty?'

1280
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,417
Both of us painted this

1281
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,125
My parents got into
a world war after that!

1282
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,167
But my dad kept quiet
and retired to his room

1283
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:09,417
Amma didn't give up

1284
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,750
She told my dad

1285
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:14,333
'I married you because you fell in love
 with me, I didn't love you'

1286
01:25:14,458 --> 01:25:16,458
I thought a volcano would erupt!

1287
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:17,292
Then?

1288
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:21,042
My dad coolly replied, '1 person's love
is enough for a marriage to work'

1289
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:23,750
'If both fall in love
it will only lead to fights'

1290
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,083
This is exactly how
my amma laughed too!

1291
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,208
When he was new at our center
I used to talk a lot to him

1292
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:36,583
He used to share
a slice of his life with me

1293
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:38,583
That too his love story

1294
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,708
Wow! I would ask him to repeat it

1295
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:43,042
Love story?

1296
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:44,917
Yes, his love story

1297
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:46,500
Oh!

1298
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:48,167
What, Shiva?

1299
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:51,042
I knew he fell in love but-

1300
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,750
He has never told me
his love story even once

1301
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,833
I remember asking him once

1302
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,083
To which he said

1303
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:00,750
Tell me when you fall in love
I'll tell you then

1304
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,583
This was his reply

1305
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:04,375
Oh!

1306
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:07,792
Do you know how he'll begin
 his story every time I asked?

1307
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,375
A man and a woman

1308
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,625
When they look at each other
with true love

1309
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:15,792
At that very moment

1310
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,542
God plants a seed
for an entire generation

1311
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:23,833
When you appa met your amma
he was a final year student

1312
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:26,833
Your mom had just joined, 1st year

1313
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:31,417
My Thilaka was not a head turner

1314
01:26:33,042 --> 01:26:34,583
But in my eyes

1315
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,250
She was Miss World!

1316
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,375
She was very reserved by nature

1317
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,083
And flash a special smile
once in a while

1318
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:48,000
Wow...interesting!

1319
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,333
- Then?
- I had to travel

1320
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,542
...only to 2 km to reach my college

1321
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,833
But she had to start from Guindy

1322
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:57,208
12 km

1323
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:58,500
So sad

1324
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:04,000
I'll start early in the morning
Go to Guindy, wait at the bus stop

1325
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,667
I'll travel with her

1326
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:09,125
Do you know where their bus-love
progressed to the next level?

1327
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:11,458
- Canteen, huh?
- Wrong

1328
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,542
Library

1329
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:15,542
Naturally it would've been deserted

1330
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:18,625
Your mom made a beeline
to the library when she was free

1331
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:21,125
I started reading books
only because of her

1332
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:24,167
The more I read

1333
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:26,042
I was hopelessly in love

1334
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,458
Hoping to talk to her
atleast before I graduated

1335
01:27:33,417 --> 01:27:35,667
One day I went and
stood in front of her

1336
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,333
She looked up at me

1337
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:41,625
Without blinking an eye

1338
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:44,583
I froze like a statue made of snow

1339
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:50,917
My love was reflected
in her eyes too

1340
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:02,542
Ap...appa has been so perseverant, huh?

1341
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,208
I just can't believe it

1342
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:06,875
By the way on tat day
did he profess his love?

1343
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:10,250
No, he couldn't muster up courage
So he went back home

1344
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:16,000
'Then I graduated'

1345
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,958
'I joined as a post-grad student
in the same college just for her'

1346
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:24,167
3 years just whizzed past

1347
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,250
Aiyaiyo!

1348
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,792
My course was about to end

1349
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,083
Can't delay it any longer

1350
01:28:31,292 --> 01:28:32,667
What should I do?

1351
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,208
What?

1352
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:35,708
Letter!

1353
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,958
Letter...letter

1354
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:38,333
Letter

1355
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:41,542
Yes, I wrote a letter

1356
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:43,833
- 4 pages
- 4

1357
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,792
I wrote 4 pages to her

1358
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,833
- Where is Thilaka?
- Where?

1359
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:52,667
Thilaka?

1360
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:54,167
In her aunt's house

1361
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:56,458
She was staying with
her mother's sister

1362
01:28:56,667 --> 01:29:00,542
I cycled straight to her house
with the letter in my pocket

1363
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,417
It was pouring cats and dogs

1364
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:05,875
I went and stood there
drenched to my skin

1365
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,792
After a long, long time...

1366
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,833
Thilaka came out

1367
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:13,625
I walked up to her
with the letter in my hand

1368
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:16,333
In her...

1369
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:19,500
I dropped the letter in her mail box

1370
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:23,833
Then?

1371
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:27,167
She read the letter

1372
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,208
She was totally disappointed

1373
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:34,000
- Why?
- Why?

1374
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,000
- Why?
- Because

1375
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:38,083
...After standing in the rain for so long

1376
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:41,167
...his letter was wet with ink
 smudged on the paper

1377
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,458
Aiyaiyo!

1378
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:45,542
- Now villain entry
- Who was that?

1379
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,083
After that

1380
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,333
Every day I'll cycle

1381
01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:53,833
To the road where she lived

1382
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,833
I'll see her

1383
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,792
She'll see me

1384
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:05,250
Both of us never noticed
her aunt was watching us

1385
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:09,958
Sometime later

1386
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,625
I went there one day

1387
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:15,292
Her house was locked

1388
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,542
I went 2 days continuously

1389
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,583
But Thilaka wasn't there

1390
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:25,792
Not knowing

1391
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,375
Not knowing what to do
I felt I had gone mad

1392
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,625
Then?

1393
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:34,417
Your friend

1394
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:35,708
Friend

1395
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:38,375
Her friend came to see me

1396
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:43,833
She handed over...a letter

1397
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,167
A letter Thilaka wrote to me

1398
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,083
'I am going to my hometown'

1399
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:53,917
She said her father was unwell

1400
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:55,958
She signed it

1401
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,417
Your Thilaka

1402
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:02,417
Your Thilaka

1403
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:05,875
Imagine my joy

1404
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:08,917
Your Thilaka...!

1405
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:12,500
I don't know how many times
I read those 2 words

1406
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:14,708
I couldn't wait any longer

1407
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,417
I took a bus to her hometown

1408
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:21,167
Went straight to her house

1409
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:24,292
Only then I knew

1410
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:29,792
They had tricked her and
she was to marry someone else

1411
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,917
My heart broke and
 my world just collapsed

1412
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,250
I wept inconsolably
and reached the bus stand

1413
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,792
I was about to board the bus

1414
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,833
I remembered the words
'Your Thilaka'

1415
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:55,083
I felt I was making a grave blunder

1416
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:59,792
If it is true love...

1417
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:04,333
I  decided I should fight for it
till my last breath

1418
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:08,375
I don't know from where
I got that kind of courage

1419
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,792
I walked into her house again

1420
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,333
They beat me to a pulp

1421
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:18,458
They dragged me but I went
upto Thilaka and stood before her

1422
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,292
Thilaka saw me

1423
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:23,417
Thilaka!

1424
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,375
'Will you marry me?'
I asked her

1425
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,542
Those were the 1st words
I spoke to her

1426
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:36,333
With tears streaming down her cheeks
Thilaka came and held my hand

1427
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,875
I held her hands tight
and dragged her away from them

1428
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,375
Your Thilaka

1429
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,333
Then?

1430
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:55,083
Doesn't matter, Shiva

1431
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:57,500
Isn't this a beautiful love story?

1432
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:05,833
Like strangers in a train
who share the same compartment

1433
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:07,708
And travel together

1434
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,625
I stayed under the same roof
and didn't really know my parents

1435
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:13,583
I'm too ashamed to even think of it

1436
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:19,542
All these days, I thought
 my dad led a rather boring life

1437
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:22,500
But he has led quite an adventurous life

1438
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,708
Thanks, Archana

1439
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:31,417
Thanks to you, I found
my dad in my heart again

1440
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:38,000
I feel like seeing him
atleast once more

1441
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:47,958
'A man and woman...'

1442
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:51,917
'When they look at each other
with true love'

1443
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,125
'At that very moment'

1444
01:33:54,167 --> 01:33:57,917
'God plants a seed
for an entire generation'

1445
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:00,958
It's getting late, see you

1446
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,542
If you feel like drinking...

1447
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:08,375
...make yourself another cup of coffee

1448
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:21,917
- Ranga, is it over?
- Not yet, bro

1449
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,792
- Are you playing the fool?
- Bro

1450
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
There's a temple festival nearby

1451
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:28,500
- The coast is not clear
- Ranga

1452
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:31,375
I liked your sense of gratitude
and self confidence

1453
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:34,792
Retrospect on your life 5 years ago
and how I've nourished you

1454
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:37,875
Bro, when have I disobeyed you?

1455
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,542
Only that faith
is making me call you

1456
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,125
I wanted to tell you

1457
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:44,250
That boy Kasi who's with you

1458
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:45,833
Kill him too

1459
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:51,375
- Bro, he is our boy
- Do what I say Ranga!

1460
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:55,542
We should leave no clues in a crime scene
He disobeyed that rule

1461
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,333
Our life is at stake
if we spare him

1462
01:34:57,417 --> 01:34:58,958
He trusted me and came, bro

1463
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:00,958
Wrong timing
 for sentiments, Ranga

1464
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,750
If we have to be comfortably well off

1465
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:06,417
...we must kill anyone
who is an obstacle, got it?

1466
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:09,750
Don't lose me by supporting
a boy who walked in yesterday

1467
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,167
Nothing of that sort, bro

1468
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:21,542
Let me ask you one last time
Can you do this or not?

1469
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:23,958
Okay, bro
I'll handle it

1470
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:33,250
In you go!

1471
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:39,917
Bro...?

1472
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:54,542
Shiva, do you know which dog will win?

1473
01:35:55,917 --> 01:36:00,375
The dog which you feed
and raise with love will win

1474
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:05,208
[Holy chant]

1475
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:10,000
'Uncle, wait'

1476
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,625
'Make a wish
and then cut'

1477
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:13,542
'Okay'

1478
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:15,875
'- What did you wish for?
- Tell us'

1479
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,042
'What will I wish?'

1480
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:20,042
'My son Shiva should'

1481
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:23,500
'...get married before my memory fades'

1482
01:36:24,167 --> 01:36:25,583
'With a girl like Archana'

1483
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:28,417
'Why 'like Archana'?
Let's ask her'

1484
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:29,458
'Uncle!'

1485
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,542
'- Cut the cake'
- Okay'

1486
01:36:32,917 --> 01:36:34,667
'Happy Birthday'

1487
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,167
- Hello
- I killed everyone, bro

1488
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:41,458
Good, how did you
dispose the bodies?

1489
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:43,417
That is...my problem, bro

1490
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:45,125
Job neatly done

1491
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,167
Where are you?

1492
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,417
I am...er-

1493
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,750
- Near Orapakkam railway station
- Stay there, be safe

1494
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,958
I'll call you, after making
some other arrangements

1495
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:57,208
Go to Mumbai and stay
till all the issues settle here

1496
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:59,875
- I'll take care of all your needs
- Okay, bro

1497
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,458
Ranga has cleared the hurdles

1498
01:37:13,042 --> 01:37:15,792
So only Ranga is alive

1499
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,750
Let's close his chapter too

1500
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:25,042
Guna, whatever you told Ranga
the same holds good here

1501
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,000
This is not the time for sentiments

1502
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:30,208
The police department is
head deep involved in this case

1503
01:37:30,542 --> 01:37:31,875
That's why I'm insisting

1504
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:36,083
Only if the killer is alive will a finger
point to the man who ordered the killing

1505
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:08,708
Brother, how could you do this to me?

1506
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:13,625
Sir, you killed the hand
that helped you

1507
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,250
Will you eat?

1508
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:28,042
[overlap of indistinct voices]

1509
01:38:29,375 --> 01:38:31,708
'I went to ensure you got medical aid'

1510
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:34,250
'If you had let me go
I would have'

1511
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,000
'I am just a normal man'

1512
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,583
'I haven't repaid my home loan'

1513
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,333
'I didn't do anything wrong'

1514
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:41,792
'Why did you do this to my family?'

1515
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:43,625
'Shall I serve you sambar?'

1516
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:49,583
Yaaay! I got 3

1517
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:52,042
'Going up the ladder?
Wait, I'll get you'

1518
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:54,708
Shucks!

1519
01:38:55,292 --> 01:38:56,708
Rajappa

1520
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:58,417
Let's go for a walk

1521
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,500
God help me

1522
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,625
Yes

1523
01:39:17,667 --> 01:39:20,000
- Hello
- Madhavi, this is Kasi

1524
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:21,917
Kasi...?
Hello...?

1525
01:39:23,417 --> 01:39:24,542
Hello?

1526
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:25,958
Shucks!

1527
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,583
- Hello?
- Madhavi, this is Kasi

1528
01:39:31,583 --> 01:39:34,375
Kasi, where did you disappear?
No sign of you for 2 days

1529
01:39:34,417 --> 01:39:36,625
I'm here on an important task

1530
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:38,542
Why ddin't you call me?

1531
01:39:38,625 --> 01:39:41,500
No, sweetheart
My phone fell into a tub of water

1532
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:44,167
Like you said I kept it
in a bag of rice, dried-

1533
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,708
Okay, where are you now?

1534
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,208
I am in a house in Kolappakkam

1535
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,292
Hello...hello?

1536
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,708
Aiyo!

1537
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,833
Badri, he hasn't killed anyone

1538
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,417
'He bluffed to us'

1539
01:40:12,417 --> 01:40:14,000
He's in Kolapakkam now

1540
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:15,417
You were right Badri

1541
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:17,000
Ranga is playing games with us

1542
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:18,083
Okay, I'll handle it

1543
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:20,250
I won't be the only one
to get caught

1544
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:22,083
I'm telling you I'll handle it?

1545
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,667
'Why get tense for no reason?'

1546
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:26,958
If he calls you once more
talk to him normally

1547
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:28,625
Call me immediately

1548
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:30,792
I'll go to Kolapakkam right away

1549
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:36,292
Shiva, it's late
We need to leave

1550
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,917
1 minute, I'll come
I need to send a mail

1551
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,917
I've received a job offer from the US

1552
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:44,958
I'm not taking it

1553
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,542
Life is beautiful

1554
01:40:57,792 --> 01:40:59,208
'Life is beautiful'

1555
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:04,500
'Hi...!'

1556
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:07,167
'What are you looking at?'

1557
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:09,167
'You are me'

1558
01:41:10,792 --> 01:41:13,750
'I don't know what state you'll be in
when you watch this'

1559
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,417
'I am not even sure
if you'll get to watch this'

1560
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,750
You are suffering from
 Alzheimer's disease

1561
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:23,958
'You'll slowly forget everything'

1562
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:26,708
'If you see this video by chance...'

1563
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:30,417
'I am recording this
so you'll know who you are'

1564
01:41:31,667 --> 01:41:33,375
'Your name is Govindarajan'

1565
01:41:33,708 --> 01:41:35,917
'M.Sc., M.Phil'

1566
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,083
'Professor in Mathematics'

1567
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:42,750
'Your wife's name is Thilaka'

1568
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,458
'You both fell in love
and got married'

1569
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,500
'She isn't alive now'

1570
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:50,583
'She died of cancer'

1571
01:41:52,375 --> 01:41:53,750
'Your son's name is Shiva'

1572
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,958
'Software engineer'

1573
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,458
'These 2 people mean the world to you'

1574
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:03,000
'You've been the perfect husband'

1575
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,750
'And a great father'

1576
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:08,083
'The ideal teacher as well'

1577
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:12,083
'You've moulded good students
for our society'

1578
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:15,292
'Now...'

1579
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,167
'Shiva is your world'

1580
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:22,833
'Even if you forget everything
in this world...'

1581
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:26,375
'Shiva will never forget you'

1582
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:30,167
'He will take good care
 of you till the very end'

1583
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:32,875
'In a way, you are very lucky'

1584
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,667
'So don't worry about anything'

1585
01:42:36,417 --> 01:42:37,792
'Shiva is with you'

1586
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:41,000
'Shiva is your life'

1587
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:44,417
'Life is beautiful'

1588
01:42:48,875 --> 01:42:50,167
Shiva

1589
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:53,250
Shiva

1590
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:55,208
It's okay

1591
01:42:58,417 --> 01:42:59,458
Shiva

1592
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:02,167
Don't cry, please

1593
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,583
Cheers!

1594
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:35,792
Ranga, give me a cigarette

1595
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,167
Come on

1596
01:43:41,708 --> 01:43:42,833
Repeat

1597
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:52,000
Ranga, that body in the van-

1598
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:56,292
Did you stab and kill
that body in the van?

1599
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:57,625
You came to drink, do that

1600
01:43:57,667 --> 01:43:59,750
Why butt your nose in?

1601
01:43:59,792 --> 01:44:04,792
Actually whether I get high or not
words overflow when I am drunk

1602
01:44:04,792 --> 01:44:09,542
Last week, in this same bar
I spoke for an hour to a chap on GST

1603
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:10,833
He didn’t utter a single word

1604
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:13,125
Then he fixed his hearing aid
and walked out

1605
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:15,375
Hearing you for even 5 minutes is torture

1606
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:17,417
Imagine 12 times that
Poor fellow!

1607
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:20,042
Okay, let’s not touch
professional matters

1608
01:44:20,042 --> 01:44:21,250
Tell me about yourself

1609
01:44:21,292 --> 01:44:24,333
Your parents
Are you married?

1610
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,083
I was a little confused

1611
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:28,667
I wanted to drink
and so I called you

1612
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:31,500
Don’t talk unnecessarily
Just zip your lips and drink

1613
01:44:31,542 --> 01:44:33,667
You shouldn’t decide
when your brain is fuzzy

1614
01:44:33,708 --> 01:44:37,167
- What is bothering you?
- When to kill all of you!

1615
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,208
My parents died when I was very young

1616
01:44:46,292 --> 01:44:48,708
I’ve reached this level
with great difficulty

1617
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:52,583
I wanted a family of mine
and that’s why I fell in love

1618
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:55,583
My son is my life, sir

1619
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,458
He is my whole world

1620
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:00,750
My family has no one
except me to support them

1621
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:10,125
Sir, if you’ve decided to kill

1622
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:13,125
…then kill all 3 of us

1623
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:18,542
Shall we go?

1624
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:27,417
1 minute

1625
01:45:27,417 --> 01:45:28,833
I’ll buy a cigarette

1626
01:45:36,792 --> 01:45:38,958
1 packet cigarette

1627
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:44,792
Yov! Have you seen this chap?

1628
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,167
No, sir

1629
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,125
What about you?

1630
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:55,708
No

1631
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:13,792
Sir, he is looking for you

1632
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:15,000
Is he a cop?

1633
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:47,083
Sir! We are checking all the vehicles
regarding that murder case

1634
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:48,917
Commissioner had also called me

1635
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,792
We are investigating 24x7
We’ll nab the culprit for sure

1636
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:55,167
Call me if you get to know
any information regarding this case

1637
01:46:55,167 --> 01:46:56,667
Sure, sir
I’ll do that

1638
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:00,333
enna mama majaava?

1639
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:02,292
Good night

1640
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,417
What, bro?

1641
01:47:39,583 --> 01:47:40,375
Bro…!

1642
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:42,917
Rascal!
Where’s the phone?

1643
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,375
Give me the phone

1644
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:49,333
Didn’t I warn you not to talk
to that wretched female?

1645
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:50,417
Give it

1646
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:57,458
I can hear him hitting Kasi
Go and check what’s wrong

1647
01:48:00,417 --> 01:48:03,750
He hit the good Samaritan
on his head, let him die

1648
01:48:04,708 --> 01:48:06,333
- Tell me
- Sorry, bro

1649
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,000
- Whom else did you talk to?
- Don't hit, bro

1650
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
‘Lord Muruga, with your glance
grant protective assistance’

1651
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:15,917
‘May Your ever vigilant spear
remove my anxieties and fear’

1652
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:19,542
‘Lord Muruga, with your glance
grant protective assistance’

1653
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:22,917
‘May Your ever vigilant spear
remove my anxieties and fear’

1654
01:48:24,208 --> 01:48:28,042
'Save me...save me and protect me
Lord Muruga, I am your devotee'

1655
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:34,458
‘Lord Muruga, with your glance
grant protective assistance’

1656
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,000
'Save me'

1657
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:51,167
We are leaving

1658
01:48:51,167 --> 01:48:52,042
Sir?

1659
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:55,375
So many events occurred
beyond my control

1660
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:58,250
I think I’ve troubled you too much
Please forgive me

1661
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:59,250
It's okay

1662
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:03,500
I usually sleep with
a knife under my pillow

1663
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,208
I could never sleep

1664
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:09,125
But these 4 nights
I slept peacefully without a pillow

1665
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:10,792
See you

1666
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:13,042
Where will you go, sir?

1667
01:49:28,958 --> 01:49:31,583
I am so jealous of you

1668
01:49:32,375 --> 01:49:35,833
You’re like a new born baby
having blissfully forgotten everything

1669
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:39,292
You came out of the blue
and turned my life topsyturvy

1670
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:43,500
I’ll take leave

1671
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:50,792
Come

1672
01:49:51,208 --> 01:49:52,958
Get up

1673
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:58,208
I’ve never fallen at anyone’s feet
to be blessed, I just feel like it

1674
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:03,708
Happy birthday, Shiva

1675
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:09,417
The traffic is bad in Bombay
Drive carefully please

1676
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:17,375
Sir, what about him?

1677
01:50:17,417 --> 01:50:19,208
I don’t know where he came from

1678
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:20,542
He doesn’t know either

1679
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:23,125
Please take care of him if you can

1680
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:33,167
See you

1681
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:34,667
I'll take leave

1682
01:50:35,042 --> 01:50:35,750
Come

1683
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,000
See you, akka
Bye, uncle

1684
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:56,792
- Yes?
- I’m Archana’s mother

1685
01:50:56,833 --> 01:50:58,167
Hi, aunty

1686
01:50:58,208 --> 01:50:59,583
Don’t get down

1687
01:50:59,583 --> 01:51:01,208
I need to tell you
something important

1688
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:02,083
How can I help you?

1689
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:04,792
We’ve seen a groom for Archana

1690
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:07,875
We want to get her married soon

1691
01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:11,667
It doesn’t augur well
if she’s with you at all odd hours

1692
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:15,333
As much as your dad is important to you
our daughter means the world to us

1693
01:51:15,458 --> 01:51:17,000
I hope you understand
what I’m saying

1694
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:19,542
Please stay away from her

1695
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:46,667
Sir, we searched this place
on that night thoroughly

1696
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,583
You could’ve missed it in the dark

1697
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:51,208
We may get a clue
if we hunt in broad daylight

1698
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,000
- You go and search
- Okay, sir

1699
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:57,583
Come

1700
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:04,083
Take care of yourself
Don’t wander around alone

1701
01:52:46,542 --> 01:52:47,750
Get down

1702
01:52:54,875 --> 01:52:57,917
If you go straight down this road
you’ll reach the police station

1703
01:52:58,042 --> 01:52:59,583
Police station

1704
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:01,417
Go inside

1705
01:53:03,292 --> 01:53:04,500
Take care

1706
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:30,792
Sir, take a look at this

1707
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:35,875
‘Who are you?’

1708
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:37,833
'My father-in-law, sir'

1709
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:39,833
'He’s mentally unsound'

1710
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,875
I’m sub inspector
from Kolapakkam

1711
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,042
Yes, sir

1712
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:02,750
Your patient Govindaraj

1713
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:05,708
He has been missing
and we have complained, sir

1714
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,042
Missing?

1715
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,667
Yes, sir, he went missing
when he was out with his son

1716
01:54:09,667 --> 01:54:10,875
His son?

1717
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:12,208
Doesn’t he have
only 1 daughter?

1718
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:13,958
No, sir
He has just 1 son

1719
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:15,167
‘His name is Shiva’

1720
01:54:15,208 --> 01:54:16,958
- Are you sure?
- Of course, sir

1721
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:18,042
What happened?

1722
01:54:18,042 --> 01:54:19,667
I’ll call you back

1723
01:54:25,708 --> 01:54:28,542
Okay, I’ll go immediately
to Kolapakkam police station

1724
01:54:28,542 --> 01:54:29,458
Thanks

1725
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:42,875
I don’t know the link between
 our case and this gentleman

1726
01:54:42,917 --> 01:54:44,625
But I know where he lives

1727
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:47,667
Let’s go

1728
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:54,125
Madhavi, he hit me
and confiscated my phone

1729
01:54:54,167 --> 01:54:55,333
Aiyaiyo!
Is that so?

1730
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:57,500
I must somehow escape
from his clutches, Madhavi

1731
01:54:58,292 --> 01:55:00,375
Ask him where he is now

1732
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:02,250
Tell me where you are

1733
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:04,125
I’ll ask sir to rescue you

1734
01:55:04,167 --> 01:55:09,167
We are in an old library
enroute to Vandalur

1735
01:55:09,167 --> 01:55:12,125
You stay right there
I’ll tell sir when he comes home

1736
01:55:12,167 --> 01:55:13,667
Aiyaiyo! Madhavi
He’s coming

1737
01:55:13,708 --> 01:55:14,750
I’ll talk to you later

1738
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,875
Hello…hello?

1739
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:24,250
Somehow I suspect Guna

1740
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:26,083
Why do you say so?

1741
01:55:26,125 --> 01:55:28,750
Guna’s big project has stopped half way

1742
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:29,875
Sabapathy is the reason

1743
01:55:29,917 --> 01:55:33,750
Guna tried to pressurize Sabapathy
But Sabapathy refused to budge

1744
01:55:34,667 --> 01:55:38,000
There’s a mole in our department
who has a hand in this murder

1745
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:39,250
That’s my suspicion, sir

1746
01:55:39,292 --> 01:55:40,083
What are you saying?

1747
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:42,625
That van was seized
by our department

1748
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:43,958
That’s why I feel I’m right

1749
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,167
Hello?

1750
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:57,042
There’s an old library
in this area it seems

1751
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,292
We drove past it, sir

1752
01:55:58,292 --> 01:55:59,042
Turn the car

1753
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:02,417
We had complained about
a missing person named Govindaraj

1754
01:56:02,458 --> 01:56:03,542
Inspector called me

1755
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:04,708
He has gone out

1756
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:28,875
’He’s coming
I’ll talk to you later’

1757
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:34,208
Bro?

1758
01:56:35,083 --> 01:56:38,208
Before they come here
let’s run away somewhere

1759
01:56:39,667 --> 01:56:41,250
I’m fed up of running

1760
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,458
This isn’t the time to run and hide

1761
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,875
It’s time to check mate

1762
01:56:48,208 --> 01:56:49,333
Okay, you go

1763
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:51,958
- Bro?
- You aren’t made for this

1764
01:56:52,708 --> 01:56:54,375
Go and find a decent job

1765
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:57,083
Where will I go, bro?
I can’t leave you

1766
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:58,667
I don’t mind falling
at Guna sir’s fee-

1767
01:56:58,708 --> 01:56:59,417
Bloody fool!

1768
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,125
Guna asked me
to kill you first

1769
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:05,667
I am next in his list

1770
01:57:05,708 --> 01:57:06,792
Bro…?

1771
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:10,167
Rascal! I bent myself backwards for him

1772
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:13,958
I realized only when I stayed
with a family these 3 days

1773
01:57:13,958 --> 01:57:15,917
I didn’t murder an individual

1774
01:57:15,917 --> 01:57:17,417
But some families en masse

1775
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,917
You go now, they may land up anytime

1776
01:57:20,167 --> 01:57:22,333
Whatever happens
I’ll be by your side, bro

1777
01:57:26,875 --> 01:57:29,667
Wait for an hour
at the railway station nearby

1778
01:57:29,667 --> 01:57:31,917
If I don’t come
you leave

1779
01:57:31,958 --> 01:57:33,375
I don’t want, bro

1780
01:57:33,375 --> 01:57:34,583
Take it

1781
01:57:34,625 --> 01:57:37,000
Take it, go

1782
01:57:37,667 --> 01:57:41,417
I’ll wait in the station
Please come, bro

1783
01:57:41,458 --> 01:57:42,542
Okay, go now

1784
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:45,792
Come without fail

1785
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:47,250
Just go now

1786
01:57:51,583 --> 01:57:53,167
- Bro?
- GO…!

1787
01:57:53,917 --> 01:57:55,042
Go

1788
01:58:29,917 --> 01:58:30,500
Wait here

1789
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:31,625
I’ll be back

1790
02:00:58,333 --> 02:00:59,708
You wanted to kill me

1791
02:01:23,833 --> 02:01:26,250
Ramana, get the knife from him

1792
02:02:08,208 --> 02:02:10,458
Bro…bro?

1793
02:02:10,667 --> 02:02:12,333
Bro

1794
02:02:12,542 --> 02:02:13,667
What happened?

1795
02:02:17,208 --> 02:02:18,792
Bro

1796
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:22,000
I tried my level best

1797
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,833
I couldn’t chase the black dog away

1798
02:02:28,458 --> 02:02:33,417
That’s why I ki…killed it

1799
02:02:43,125 --> 02:02:45,958
Bro…you asked me to wait

1800
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,792
Don't leave me all alone like this

1801
02:02:55,458 --> 02:02:57,167
I think my boss is in a meeting

1802
02:02:57,208 --> 02:02:58,583
He isn’t picking my call

1803
02:02:58,625 --> 02:03:00,500
I’ll call you as soon as he gets back

1804
02:03:00,542 --> 02:03:02,833
- You leave now
- Okay, sir

1805
02:03:11,167 --> 02:03:12,583
Give me a cigarette

1806
02:03:58,375 --> 02:03:59,333
Chee!

1807
02:04:11,125 --> 02:04:14,625
‘Terrorizing murders in Chennai
Police department stunned!!!’

1808
02:04:15,708 --> 02:04:17,750
I never thought
it will end this way

1809
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:20,875
I thought he’ll get
married and settle down

1810
02:04:20,917 --> 02:04:22,917
Both are same, dear
Forget it

1811
02:04:22,917 --> 02:04:25,208
What would have happened to that boy?

1812
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,542
The one who called you ‘akka’?
I have no idea

1813
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:30,250
If he was dead his mug shot
will be in the papers too

1814
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:31,292
What's my lunch?

1815
02:04:31,333 --> 02:04:33,042
Oil cake and fodder!

1816
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:34,958
Quiet mischief!

1817
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:39,375
Shiva, buy half a litre milk
for your mother in the evening

1818
02:04:39,917 --> 02:04:42,333
I’ll get you 1 whole litre

1819
02:05:04,458 --> 02:05:05,375
Not here

1820
02:05:06,042 --> 02:05:08,333
Go over there
Police station

1821
02:05:09,875 --> 02:05:11,250
I’m hungry

1822
02:05:12,208 --> 02:05:13,667
I am hungry

1823
02:05:18,542 --> 02:05:20,750
I haven’t decided
what to do with him

1824
02:05:20,917 --> 02:05:22,750
Do you mind him
staying here with us?

1825
02:05:22,792 --> 02:05:24,167
Let him be, dear
Poor thing

1826
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:26,708
Won’t we take care
of your father or mine?

1827
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:30,875
Janu, your father is like him

1828
02:05:30,917 --> 02:05:34,333
But your mother remembers
even her previous birth!

1829
02:05:34,375 --> 02:05:35,625
Joke?

1830
02:05:35,667 --> 02:05:36,542
Go now

1831
02:05:36,583 --> 02:05:38,583
Don’t bring someone back with you

1832
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:41,125
I’ll come back soon

1833
02:05:41,167 --> 02:05:44,458
Put Vicky to bed early
and wait for me

1834
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,250
Don’t drool
Go now

1835
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:48,625
Janu, what will I eat-

1836
02:05:48,667 --> 02:05:50,167
Shiva?

1837
02:05:51,417 --> 02:05:54,583
I’ll get milk for you
If possible I’ll bring the cow home too

1838
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:01,167
1 cigarette

1839
02:06:24,167 --> 02:06:24,875
I am Shiva

1840
02:06:24,917 --> 02:06:26,833
- Mr Govindharajan
- Please come in

1841
02:06:28,917 --> 02:06:30,458
He’s inside
You can go

1842
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,292
Appa?

1843
02:07:19,458 --> 02:07:20,917
Shiva?

1844
02:07:21,417 --> 02:07:22,458
Did you have lunch?

1845
02:07:59,125 --> 02:07:59,708
Come, pa

1846
02:08:21,625 --> 02:08:24,208
Appa, this is amma

1847
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:26,417
Thilaka

1848
02:08:27,625 --> 02:08:29,333
Your Thilaka

1849
02:08:35,375 --> 02:08:35,917
Come here

1850
02:08:40,375 --> 02:08:41,375
This is you

1851
02:08:42,917 --> 02:08:44,875
This…is me

1852
02:08:47,042 --> 02:08:48,125
Shiva?

1853
02:08:57,458 --> 02:09:00,375
You started drawing her
I completed your sketch

1854
02:09:03,708 --> 02:09:05,250
I have some finishing touches to give

1855
02:09:06,708 --> 02:09:11,375
Appa, I don’t know
if you understand what I’m saying

1856
02:09:12,667 --> 02:09:14,667
Life is beautiful

1857
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:19,208
Shiva

1858
02:09:24,375 --> 02:09:26,875
‘If it is true love...’

1859
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:32,042
‘I decided I should fight for it
till my last breath’

1860
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:35,417
‘I don't know from where
I got that kind of courage’

1861
02:09:36,292 --> 02:09:39,500
‘I walked into her house’

1862
02:10:13,083 --> 02:10:16,125
Archana, will you marry me?

1863
