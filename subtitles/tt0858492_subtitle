They produced great woodwork then,

Hand sIipped unwittingIy.

348
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,071
PIease don't take it seriousIy.

349
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:11,574
I think it's betterto wash in bathroom.
- Come.

350
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:15,742
You couId've done this earIier instead
of serving 15 times to me.

351
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,417
Do you want me to orderteak foryou?

352
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:20,086
You shove it into your...

353
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,416
May I serve you Sambar?

354
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,918
Sorry, I'm reaIIy feeIing.

355
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,419
I'm aIso feeIing for not
getting fuIIy wet in Sambar,

356
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,776
Why did you do that?

357
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,453
HeIping you.

358
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,785
Is it heIp?- Isn't it?

359
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:58,125
You took troubIe to cIean my shirt.

360
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,786
Isn't it my duty to cIear
the wrinkIe on your waist?

361
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:07,126
In AthiIi they say it as heIp for heIp.

362
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:10,303
Stop narrating taIes about AthiIi.

363
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:12,135
Listen to me.

364
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,804
Yours is South, mine is North.

365
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:18,641
Yours is Andhra Pardesh,
mine is Madhya Pradesh.

366
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,147
If you touch my mid region
without my permission,

367
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,646
I wiII...

368
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,491
If you cIose your eye for
a second, I'II vanish.

369
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:37,654
You are a coward, how can you Iove me?

370
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,663
You mean you have it on me?

371
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,998
If it isn't there, wiII I dare to invite
you aIone to my room?

372
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,174
Why wiII I bring you to the bathroom?

373
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,172
I'm new to aII this,
so I couIdn't get it fast.

374
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,675
If I do it one more time,
I'II be right on the track.

TCTahalapTthy

376
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,552
I can't go to bed at night...

377
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,550
Even if I go to bed I can't sIeep...

378
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,719
If I sIeep I can dream...

379
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:38,892
It's you in my dreams...

380
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,730
Is Iove so pIeasurefuI?

381
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:57,911
I can't wake in day...

382
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,739
Even if I do, I can't come out...

383
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:03,906
Even if I do come out,
I'm an enigma to myseIf...

TCTahalapTthy

Time is moving sIow in daytime...

386
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:06,143
What do you want?
Tea or coffee?

387
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,484
Can't you say something interesting?

388
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:18,655
WiII gossip do forthe night?

389
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:22,651
Let's draw Iines and pIay...

390
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:26,993
I made a vow to cross the Iine,
what can I do?

391
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:31,334
O God! I can't take it anymore...

392
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:34,006
Your adventurous Iiberty with me...

393
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:29,885
ShaII I spend hours together with you?

394
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:33,725
What wiII happen to me afterthat?

395
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:42,068
Just 5 minutes are enough for it...

396
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:46,409
What's this nasty idea?

397
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:50,743
What to do as our Iove goes deeper?

398
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:54,920
Be content with kisses and
caressing my cheeks with yours...

399
00:32:55,189 --> 00:33:02,095
Don't bIame me Iaterfor any
other consequences afterthat...

400
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,103
Lord Venkateshwara of Tirupathi...

401
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:16,104
Lord Sathyanarayana of Annavaram...

402
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:18,106
Lord Narasimhaswamy of Yadagiri...

403
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:20,279

Hey Thief!

You'II not do that after
our marriage, wiII you?

414
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,149
You mean...you are accepting

00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,457
Promise me.

416
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:45,664
If give a word I stand by it.
If I promise I break it.

417
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,626
Son Sathi! -Aunty!

418
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,358

ViIIagers are happy for it...

425
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,611
A reporter has written it in newspaper.

426
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:43,081
Write.

427
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:01,573

Where did you steaI it?

If we don't send him away,
we may end up begging to survive.

494
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,050
You stop nephew.

495

Listen to me.- Let me see.

I know why you're dragging me.

594
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,562
No to such things before marriage.

595
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:49,633
If you don't Iisten to me,
even our marriage is hard to happen.

596
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:52,703
Why are you so angry?
Shouting at me for nothing.

597
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:55,339
Since I didn't see yourfor 2 days,
I was yearning to see you, you know?

598
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,941
Without understanding that...

00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,027
Yes. Someone might see us.
That's why we shouIdn't get up.

606
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:27,137
RascaI!

607
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:30,001
Looks Iike you are very much
used to such romantic things.

608
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:32,871
I swear! This is the first time
I'm trapped in this matter.

609
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:34,637
Don't get up. PIease.

Okay. Go ahead.

611
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:39,712

Dance...?

613
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,756
Let's go to the street.

614
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:45,850
On the street?

615
00:50:46,058 --> 00:50:47,525
ShaII we go to a hoteI?

616
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:49,520
In a hoteI?

617
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:50,991
May in a theatre?

618
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:53,859
You shameIess!

TCTahalapTthy

622
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:26,091
Why do you stay away, my dear?

623

624
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:30,394
It's good for both of us.

625
00:51:31,904 --> 00:51:34,065
If you want a hot spicy kiss,

626
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:36,104
I thought of giving you one.

627
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:38,402
It is up to you now to accept my kiss.

628
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:41,607
Don't show airs!

629
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:43,776
Why are you in a hurry?

630
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,674
You're tough to controI.

631
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:47,712
You're a naughty boy.

632
00:52:51,984 --> 00:52:59,652
A IittIe crow fought a dog.

633
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:07,766
A rat fought with an eIephant.

634
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:15,806
Who gave so much courage
to the rat & the crow?

635
00:53:16,008 --> 00:53:19,842
When faIIen in Iove, it happens.

636
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:23,504
No need to be surprised.

637
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:27,377
Love is a fever which stays forever.

638
00:53:27,653 --> 00:53:31,316
Love imprints itseIf on our hearts.

639
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:14,129

640
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:39,718
Honey bee kisses the fIower.

641
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:47,764
ChaIk wiII write on the board.

642
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:55,703
Dry straw must stay away from fire.

643
00:54:55,908 --> 00:55:03,610
When a Ieaf faIIs on a thorn,
it's finished.

644
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:07,513
If we make penance, won't Iove

TCTahalapTthy

647
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:01,471
What are you searching for?

648
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:03,898
TeII me why?

649
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:06,143
We need to find out who

650
00:56:06,345 --> 00:56:09,280
If Neeru knows this, my marriage wiII
be in a fix.- Fine.- I'II kick you.

651
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,641
C'mon heIp me.

TCTahalapTthy

653
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,741
It's your photo. When did you grew
such a big moustache?

654
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,141
It's herfather's photo & not mine.

655
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:45,782
He Iooks Iike me.

656
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:47,918
First we must find him and
hand over his daughterto him.

657
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,712
Where wiII you search him?

658
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:51,621
He wiII be somewhere orthe other.

659
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:07,202
I'm a big cheat.
Looks Iike he is worse than me.

660
00:57:15,714 --> 00:57:19,377
Since he has Ieft his daughter behind,
he is not an ordinary scoundreI.

661
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:24,416
Together we are 50 men.

662
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:26,951
And we have come to kiII you
and your daughter.

663
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:33,222
You don't even have to touch my daughter.

664
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:37,827
I'II kiII you the moment
you think of doing that.

665
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:52,881
UncIe..-Yes.

666
00:57:53,085 --> 00:57:56,885
Somehow we must find him
and get rid of that IittIe deviI.

667
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:07,694
Ask him.- Okay.

668
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:18,376
Have you seen him?

669
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:29,219
Trying to tease me.
He is right behind you.

670
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:31,889
And you are asking me?
Making fun of me!

671
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,286
Do you think you both are big shots.
Get Iost.

672
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:38,793
Why is he getting so angry?

673
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,156
Why are they running?

674
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:13,490
I don't know too.

675
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:14,996
Let's go & find him.

676
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:56,541

Come out I say.

680
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,044
You coward!

681

You ran away!

682
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:11,222
Come out if you are a reaI man.
Come out.

683
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:12,720
Boss, he is not here.

684

Where can he go?

Mr. Vikram, I toId you to take

But you never Iisten to me.
And you keep wandering around.

687
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:07,938
You don't understand the situation.

688
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,276
In the accident, your brain got damaged.

689
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:15,942
A major bIood vesseI got
damaged and has swoIIen.

690
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:18,453
No one knows when it wiII burst.

691
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:22,787
To be precise, your brain is
Iike an active voIcano.

692
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:27,632
Don't go out of the hospitaI.

693
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:31,466
If you don't Iisten to me,
it is Iike pIaying with death.

694
01:01:53,092 --> 01:01:53,990
Eat.

695
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:56,657
Not feeIing hungry?

696
01:01:57,696 --> 01:01:58,492
Then eat.

697
01:01:58,764 --> 01:02:01,324
You used to feed everyday, dad.

698
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:03,500
Another one!

699
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:06,837
My hand got cut & is paining. Eat.

700
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:09,006
She has turned into a Ieech.

701
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:12,006
I'm getting irritated.
She irritates me even when I dine.

702
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,678
When wiII I get rid of her!

703
01:02:14,646 --> 01:02:24,612
TCTahalapTthy

704
01:02:27,726 --> 01:02:31,355
Daddy...-What now?

705
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:36,367
Since your hand is cut...

706
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:41,698
I'm not hungry. You eat.

707
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:44,368
Get Iost.

708
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:01,889
I said I'm not hungry, right. You eat.

709
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:03,391
Shit!

710
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:18,068
What is she doing?

711
01:03:19,178 --> 01:03:20,736
SIeeping.

712
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:38,930
She didn't eat.

713
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:40,928
I must curse yourfatherfirst.

714
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,261
He briIIiantIy forced you on me.

715
01:03:45,537 --> 01:03:48,097
Even if you eat or not,

716
01:03:48,307 --> 01:03:50,104
the mistake is yourfather's.

717
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:54,104
Oh my god! I feII down.

718
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:57,774
I'm in no way reIated to you.

719
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:03,110
Don't ask me to feed you. Got it?

720
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,958
I'm taIking. Don't disturb me.

721
01:04:11,163 --> 01:04:12,130
SiIence.

722
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:12,956
And now...

723
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:16,790
I'II break you into pieces.

724
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,138
Nobody Iistens to me untiI I beat them.

725
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:44,154
She won't aIIow me to sIeep peacefuIIy.

726
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:46,831
Why are you crying?

727
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:51,825
I can't pIay my mom's song, daddy.

728
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:54,668
It is broken.

729
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:33,711
Thank you daddy.

730
01:05:52,931 --> 01:06:10,339
May the sky, earth, water and
the breeze be with you.

731
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,248
Just one more dear.
- No thanks, daddy.

732
01:06:18,457 --> 01:06:20,755
PIease dear. Just one more.

733
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:23,086
Okay, onIy one.
-Yes, just one. Come.

734
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:32,269
Daddy, someone has come foryou.

735
01:06:50,989 --> 01:06:52,957
You said you cheat peopIe.

736
01:06:54,326 --> 01:06:55,953
But stiII I feII in Iove with you.

737
01:06:57,996 --> 01:06:59,623
You said you hate kids.

738
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:02,466
I stiII agreed.

739
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:04,964
You conceaIed that you've a chiId.

740
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:05,966
ActuaIIy...

741
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:09,469
So, your Iove is not true.

742
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,647
Be here. I'II be back now.

743
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,014
I'm not married and
she is not my daughter.

744
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:28,156
When she is caIIing you daddy,
how can we trust you?

745
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,657
Herfather Iooks Iike me.

746
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:30,828
That's why she is getting confused.

747
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:33,327
My daughter said that you've
stopped cheating peopIe.

748
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:34,829
But you've not quit your profession.

749
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:36,330
Sir, I'm teIIing you the truth.

750
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,832
AtIeast you beIieve me, Neeru.

751
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:39,333
She is in no way reIated to me.

752
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,501
I swear on you.

753
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:49,844
So, you are in no way reIated to her.
-Yes sir.

754
01:07:50,048 --> 01:07:52,516
Then, there is a bus going to Devgarh.

755
01:07:52,717 --> 01:07:55,185
Come & join us. ...AIone.

756
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:41,725
Daddy, IoIIipop.

757
01:08:43,034 --> 01:08:53,000
TCTahalapTthy

758
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,758
Take her & go.

759
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:15,760
Run or eIse they wiII kiII her. Go.

760
01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:41,121
Who are you?

761
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:42,122
Why are you after me?

762
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:32,006
Sathibabu...run.

763
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:11,540
Once more pIease.

764
01:11:13,918 --> 01:11:18,548
Run brother...run.- Leave me.

765
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:22,056
Run brother. - Leave me.

766
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,092
Don't get scared. You're safe.

767
01:11:57,962 --> 01:11:59,589
Neha...dear Neha.

768
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:06,929
Come.

769
01:12:11,476 --> 01:12:12,272
Stop.

770
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,788
He said that he's not afraid of death.

771
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:27,116
Now I see the fear of death in his face.

772
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:33,127
It's not easy to face death.
You coward!

773
01:12:33,331 --> 01:12:34,958
If you reaIIy have the guts,

774
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,464
you wouIdn't have run this far.

775
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:54,367
Am I any hired goon to fear death?
I don't fear death.

776
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:01,886
Instead death fears me.

777
01:14:02,253 --> 01:14:04,881
Death hasn't got the guts to face me.

778
01:14:05,089 --> 01:14:07,717
It's been after me for
the past 6 months.

779
01:14:07,926 --> 01:14:13,558
To take me, death needs another
10 more bodies.

780
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:24,404
I swear on my moustache,

781
01:14:24,642 --> 01:14:26,906
I swear on my daughter,

782
01:14:27,178 --> 01:14:28,907

783
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,411
or if I die a minute earIierthan you,

784
01:14:32,617 --> 01:14:37,748
shave my moustache and
then bury me, you scoundreIs!

785
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:39,757
Come.

786
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:32,547
Inspector, is there anyone eIse?
- No sir.

787
01:20:02,513 --> 01:20:04,242
Doctor, how is my daughter?
- She is out of danger.

788
01:20:04,515 --> 01:20:08,076
She'II gain conscious in a whiIe.

Who is he? Who are we?

01:20:28,472 --> 01:20:31,930
Why we made you a pawn & troubIed you?

794
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,937
We need to give an expIanation
to aII these questions.

795
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:38,111
For someone to be remembered
for 100 years,

796
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:39,783
he doesn't have to Iive 100 years.

797
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:42,449
A day is enough.

798
01:20:43,154 --> 01:20:45,952
His victories wiII make
him Iive for 100 years.

799

AdditionaI Superintendent of poIice.

Six months back, peopIe in ChambaI

01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:17,987
And the poIice weartheir uniform

Even I was C.I. for a division.

01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:32,828
Where are you going?
- Bavuji...

807
01:21:33,938 --> 01:21:35,166
To meet Bavuji.

808
01:21:35,373 --> 01:21:37,000
PoIice can't go inside.

809
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:38,003
Don't you know the ruIes.

810
01:21:54,892 --> 01:22:02,856
May aII diseases get cured!

811
01:22:05,569 --> 01:22:06,866
Take good care of that bIack cow.

812
01:22:07,071 --> 01:22:08,698
It's getting weaker everyday.

Ram Ram Bavuji. -Yes teII me.

814

My wife is missing from yesterday.

818

ReaIIy...?

819
01:22:38,135 --> 01:22:40,569
What's her name?- PramiIa.

01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:42,898
Age?- 30 sir.

821
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:46,576
Very dangerous age.

822
01:22:46,777 --> 01:22:48,574
She must be very young.

823
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,760
Father, mummy is overthere. - Mother...

824
01:23:16,974 --> 01:23:24,608
Do you know where she went?- No sir.

825
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:28,945
Or do you suspect anyone?

826
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:32,952
No sir.

827
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,955
Okay. I'II find & send her home.

828
01:23:36,193 --> 01:23:44,123
She'II be home in...2 days.

829
01:23:44,668 --> 01:23:46,966
My chiIdren didn't eat for
the past 2 days.

830
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:49,139
Didn't I say I'II find & send her home.

831
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,638
Take good care of your chiIdren. Got it?

832
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:52,968
Go.

833
01:23:55,212 --> 01:23:56,804
I said go.

834
01:24:10,027 --> 01:24:11,824
Brother-in-Iaw...- Boss.

835
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:15,829
My kingdom is Kingdom of Rama.

836
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:20,837
No murders, no rapes, no rowdyism.

837
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:24,997
We'II be forced to commit a murder
onIy when anyone rebeIs against us.

838
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:28,178
OnIy when a woman refuses to come,
we'II be forced to moIest her.

839
01:24:28,379 --> 01:24:31,507
OnIy when someone refuses to give bride,
we'II be forced to do rowdyism.

840
01:24:31,882 --> 01:24:33,679
No such things happen here.

841
01:24:33,884 --> 01:24:37,513
That's why the viIIage is very peacefuI.

842
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,848
Wow! Those are goIden words.

843
01:24:40,057 --> 01:24:42,184
You are Lord Ram & I'm your sIave.

844
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:44,190
I'II buiId a tempIe atIeast

Find whether she is free.

01:25:00,744 --> 01:25:03,042
Aunty, are you free or booked?

849
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:11,388
Give them what they ask for.

850
01:25:14,925 --> 01:25:16,893
Aren't you angry on us giving money?

851
01:25:17,094 --> 01:25:18,220
Why wouId he?

852
01:25:18,496 --> 01:25:21,226
If he doesn't give, he'II Iose another Ieg.

853
01:25:24,435 --> 01:25:26,062
Who wiII free us from these demons?

855
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:47,586

Where do you want to go?
- DaIim Chowk.

857
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:53,429
Rs. 200. - It's very near by.

858
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:55,428
The distance does not matter.

859
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,268
Whatever Bavuji gang says is finaI.

860
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:01,438
No thanks.

861
01:26:03,007 --> 01:26:04,099
Once you've inquired,

862
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:06,276
you must pay the money,
no matteryou take the taxi or not.

863
01:26:06,477 --> 01:26:07,774
Take the money out.

864
01:26:07,978 --> 01:26:09,605
Don't quarreI with them.
Give them what they ask for.

865
01:26:15,819 --> 01:26:17,286
You've come with your daughter.

866
01:26:17,655 --> 01:26:18,781
Where is her mother?

867
01:26:21,492 --> 01:26:22,459
Hasn't she come?

868
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:26,220
Or has she eIoped with someone?

869
01:26:36,173 --> 01:26:37,640
TeII us what happened?

870
01:26:37,908 --> 01:26:40,638
Why someone eIse? Aren't we here?

871
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:47,812
Listen to your mummy's song.

872
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:49,985
I'II be back soon.

873
01:27:03,867 --> 01:27:05,835
Coming back?

874
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:11,166
Stay where you are.
You are finished today.

875
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,002
Don't move. Steady.

876
01:27:13,277 --> 01:27:16,007
Don't move I say.

877
01:27:27,891 --> 01:27:28,516
I see 20 fingers now.

878
01:27:37,901 --> 01:27:38,868
I see nothing.

879
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:56,375
Boss, it is urgent.
I'II be back right away.

880
01:28:07,264 --> 01:28:10,062
Oh my god!

881
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:11,063
Get up.

882
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:16,064
Your name?

883
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,065
Yours?

884
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:19,238
TeII me your name?

885
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:20,735
Your name?

01:28:21,278 --> 01:28:22,074
Wearyour shirts.

887
01:28:24,448 --> 01:28:25,574
Take out the money.

888
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:30,746
Is your own money in this?- No.

889
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,587
Brother, you beat them weII.

890
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:35,583
Who are you?

891
01:28:42,633 --> 01:28:45,431
Return their money.
- Okay brother.

892
01:28:46,303 --> 01:28:49,602
Put on buttons... shut your mouth.

893
01:28:52,142 --> 01:28:53,769
Never again shouId I see you.

894
01:29:03,987 --> 01:29:04,954
Daddy...

895
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:08,287
Good morning sir.

896
01:29:08,525 --> 01:29:10,288

01:29:12,663 --> 01:29:14,790
Arranging your house aII aIone?

898
01:29:15,065 --> 01:29:18,296
You couId've caIIed us for heIp.
- I'm used to it.

899
01:29:21,338 --> 01:29:22,805
Sorry sir. A smaII misunderstanding.

900
01:29:23,073 --> 01:29:23,971
They said the train was Iate.

901
01:29:24,174 --> 01:29:25,471
Or eIse I wouId've come
to the raiIway station.

902
01:29:25,676 --> 01:29:26,973
It's okay. PIease sit.

903
01:29:27,344 --> 01:29:28,311
Try to adjust.

904
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,808
Sir, shaII I prepare miIk foryour chiId?
- I'II do it.

905
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:35,313
You've brought your daughter aIone.

906
01:29:35,519 --> 01:29:36,315
Hasn't your wife come?

907
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:50,993
So, what eIse?

908
01:29:51,201 --> 01:29:52,327
How is the viIIage?

909
01:29:52,569 --> 01:29:54,503
Father, it's getting Iate to schooI.

910
01:29:54,772 --> 01:29:57,502
I couIdn't pIat sister's hair.
Come father.

911
01:29:58,709 --> 01:29:59,334
Why did you come here?

912
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:00,669
Your wife...?

913
01:30:04,782 --> 01:30:07,342
I know how difficuIt it is
to bring up chiIdren.

914
01:30:07,584 --> 01:30:10,018
We have to take care of everything. Go.

915
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:13,018
My mother is not dead.
She is stiII aIive.

916
01:30:31,241 --> 01:30:33,368
Do you suspect anyone?

917
01:31:36,807 --> 01:31:37,933
Who are you?

918
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:53,788
Leave me.

919
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,127
Oh my god!

920
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:16,638
Who are you?

921
01:32:20,017 --> 01:32:25,478
One phone caII wiII get you transferred
to the pIace you came from.

922
01:32:26,857 --> 01:32:29,655
When a poIice gets transferred,
he wiII stiII go to a poIice station.

923
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:31,494
And not to a post office.

924
01:32:32,863 --> 01:32:38,995
Even before the transfer order gets ready,
both you & your son wiII die.

925
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,501
CIose aII the gates.

926
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:54,178
Sit in the car.

927
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:06,695
Open the gate.

928
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:10,692
He wiII break the gate.

929
01:33:29,753 --> 01:33:30,549
I'm here, boss.

930
01:33:30,787 --> 01:33:33,551
If I can't heIp you,
it's a waste to be Home Minister.

931
01:33:34,992 --> 01:33:36,016
PIease forgive me.

932
01:33:36,426 --> 01:33:37,723
I've informed the DGP to come here.

933
01:33:38,595 --> 01:33:41,223
PIease be patient.

934
01:33:42,099 --> 01:33:49,403
Now if you caII TitIa,
the viIIage wiII burn.

935
01:33:49,606 --> 01:33:52,734
The very thought of his arrivaI
creates rippIes in my heart.

936
01:33:52,943 --> 01:33:55,241
PIease Iisten to me.

937
01:33:55,445 --> 01:33:57,743
It's my responsibiIity to
bring back your son.

938
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:07,085
Here he comes!

939
01:34:10,027 --> 01:34:12,587
Greetings sir.
- Enough of your greetings.

940
01:34:12,796 --> 01:34:13,763
When there is so much happening here,

941
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:16,762
were you sitting at home pIaying
with your baton?

942
01:34:18,301 --> 01:34:22,431
It's been years since we used batons.

943
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,938
When I took charge, you toId me to overIook
whatever happens in this viIIage

944
01:34:26,476 --> 01:34:28,944
That's why I kept quiet. - Shut up.

945
01:34:29,312 --> 01:34:30,609
ViIIage is different from Bavuji.

946
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:32,781
Bavuji is the king of this viIIage.

947
01:34:32,983 --> 01:34:34,450
How couId you arrest his son?

948
01:34:34,651 --> 01:34:35,777
Who is he? Where is he?

949
01:34:35,986 --> 01:34:36,452
Say something.

950
01:34:36,653 --> 01:34:37,779
He is the newIy appointed ASP.

951
01:34:37,988 --> 01:34:39,785
Vikram Rathore. - Shut up.

952
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,787
Why did you bring him here?

953
01:34:42,059 --> 01:34:44,289
Say something. - I didn't.

954
01:34:44,494 --> 01:34:45,961
He's here on a reguIartransfer.- Shut up.

955
01:34:46,163 --> 01:34:48,290
Was he transferred without
your knowIedge.

956
01:34:48,498 --> 01:34:50,625
So, were you sIeeping in your office?

957
01:34:50,834 --> 01:34:54,133
What shouId we do now?
Say something.

958
01:34:54,337 --> 01:34:55,804
I'II inquire about him. - Shut up.

959
01:34:56,006 --> 01:34:58,634
I'm feeIing restIess in my constituency.

960
01:34:58,842 --> 01:35:01,310
Stupids become officers.

961
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:03,312
I don't know what you're going to do.

962
01:35:03,513 --> 01:35:05,310
By afternoon, Bavuji's son must be here.

963
01:35:05,515 --> 01:35:07,983
And that officer must faII at Bavuji's feet.

964
01:35:08,185 --> 01:35:09,652
Say something. - Sure I'II wiII.

965
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:11,145
I'II take Ieave.

966
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:15,816
Enough of your saIutations.
Bring him back fast.

967
01:35:19,696 --> 01:35:21,288
They're eating my brain.

968
01:35:21,698 --> 01:35:26,829
Once they wearthis uniform,
they wouId be raring to kiII every criminaI.

969
01:35:27,037 --> 01:35:28,504
Home Minister was shouting at me.

970
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:34,006
Once bitten twice shy.

971
01:35:34,211 --> 01:35:34,836
Where is the fiIe?

972
01:35:35,812 --> 01:35:45,778
TCTahalapTthy

973
01:35:58,735 --> 01:36:00,362
He has an impressive track record.

974
01:36:01,138 --> 01:36:02,036
Where is he?

975
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,035
Do you want me to caII him?

976
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:04,874
We wiII meet him.

977
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:38,566
In your4 years of service,
you were promoted 4 times,

978
01:36:38,775 --> 01:36:41,073
transferred 10 times,
and made no compromises.

979
01:36:41,278 --> 01:36:42,404
Yourtrack record is good.

980
01:36:42,612 --> 01:36:44,409
Winning MedaIs & having good
track record isn't enough.

981
01:36:44,614 --> 01:36:45,911
When you are in duty,

982
01:36:46,116 --> 01:36:47,413
you must be sincere & fearfuI.

983
01:36:47,617 --> 01:36:48,743
And I think you are not used to it.

984
01:36:49,786 --> 01:36:52,755
Do you know how fear Iooks Iike?

985
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,426
When you are in deep sIeep at night,
someone wiII knock the door.

986
01:36:57,627 --> 01:36:58,594
When you open the door,

987
01:36:58,795 --> 01:36:59,921
you wiII find the security missing.

988
01:37:00,463 --> 01:37:02,590
Even your revoIver wiII go missing.

989
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,269
You'II onIy hearthe rowdies giggIing.

990
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:08,437
Do you know how scary it wiII be?

991
01:37:08,972 --> 01:37:11,440
Your daughter who comes by 4 pm
from schooI, wouIdn't have come.

992
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:12,766
When you inquire in the schooI,

993
01:37:12,976 --> 01:37:14,102
the watchman wiII say she has Ieft.

994
01:37:14,644 --> 01:37:16,475
6 O'cIock... 7 O'cIock...8 O'cIock...

995
01:37:16,713 --> 01:37:17,771
You'II never know about
your daughter's whereabouts.

996
01:37:18,315 --> 01:37:19,942
You'II receive a phone caII at 10.

997
01:37:20,183 --> 01:37:23,778
Do you know how scary it wouId be
to know what the phone caII is about.

998
01:37:24,988 --> 01:37:27,957
Rathore, fear is very precious.

999
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:30,450
Never underestimate it.

1000
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:38,130
He who has no fear cannot survive.

1001
01:37:41,338 --> 01:37:43,306
Why do you feeI that I've no fear?

1002
01:37:43,673 --> 01:37:44,799
Not once a day,

1003
01:37:45,008 --> 01:37:47,806
I fear every moment of my Iife.

1004
01:37:48,678 --> 01:37:50,475
When Ijoined duty 4 years ago,

1005
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,808
I swore to sacrifice my Iife to do my duty.

1006
01:37:54,017 --> 01:37:55,814
As you said, someone knocking my door
and the phone beII ringing

1007
01:37:56,019 --> 01:37:57,486
may or may not happen.

1008
01:37:57,687 --> 01:38:02,147
But I wiII die someday orthe other.

1009
01:38:04,027 --> 01:38:04,823
On that day,

1010
01:38:05,028 --> 01:38:07,326
the moment I meet death face to face,

1011
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:12,661
I fear every second that I may faiI
to fuIfiII my promise.

1012
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,676
A criminaI's fear can be found
in every nerve of his.

1013
01:38:21,378 --> 01:38:23,676
And my fear Iies in the
honour of my uniform.

1014
01:38:31,221 --> 01:38:32,518
My duty is over.

1015
01:38:32,789 --> 01:38:35,849
I promised my wife that I wiII
take good care of my daughter.

1016
01:38:47,404 --> 01:38:48,871
I've onIy one wish.

1017
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:50,367
When I meet death face to face,

1018
01:38:50,573 --> 01:38:51,870
Iet there be no fear in my eyes.

1019
01:38:52,075 --> 01:38:53,542
I shouId wear a smiIe on my face

1020
01:38:53,743 --> 01:38:56,041
with my hand twisting my whiskers.

1021
01:39:58,241 --> 01:39:59,538
Daddy...

1022
01:40:26,703 --> 01:40:33,302
Daddy, did mom go away without teIIing us?
-Yes.

1023
01:40:33,576 --> 01:40:37,478
WiII you aIso go away?
- No dear.

1024
01:40:38,681 --> 01:40:40,979
If you go, take me aIong with you.

1025
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:43,978
I can't Iive aIone.

1026
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,987
Munna the accused

1027
01:40:52,262 --> 01:40:54,992
has misbehaved due to unstabIe mind.

1028
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:57,324
Since it has been proved
that it was not intentionaI.

1029
01:40:57,534 --> 01:41:00,002
the court pronounces him innocent
and sets him free.

1030
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:02,998
ForfiIing a case without
proper evidence,

1031
01:41:03,206 --> 01:41:04,673
the court warns the poIice dept. and

1032
01:41:04,941 --> 01:41:09,344
orders poIice to take him home safeIy.

1033
01:41:16,386 --> 01:41:19,844
Daddy, judge made a fooI out of him.

1034
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:22,358
He got scared & brought me in jeep.

1035
01:41:26,229 --> 01:41:28,857
You've arrested Bavuji's son.

1036

I never aIIow anyone to touch me...

1047
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,925

TCTahalapTthy

1054
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:50,671
My friend has come from Bombay...

1055
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:52,363
Greet him...

1056
01:43:52,575 --> 01:43:54,873
Eat, drink and
have fun at night...

1057
01:43:55,078 --> 01:43:57,638
Take rest in daytime...

1058
01:43:57,847 --> 01:44:00,907
WiII you bite my chubby cheeks?

1059
01:44:01,117 --> 01:44:04,518
WiII you take on my hot passionate youth?

1060
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:10,793
WiII you touch enticing IittIe

01:44:10,994 --> 01:44:14,122
WiII you knock the squeaking door?

01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:17,595
WiII you come down and tie ankIets?

1063
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,860
WiII you come forward to

1064
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:24,403
WiII you sting Iike scorpion

1065
01:44:27,677 --> 01:44:55,700
TCTahalapTthy

1066
01:45:12,955 --> 01:45:15,856
WiII you spiII water on raging fire?

1067
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:19,460
WiII you miIk the goIden bowI?

1068
01:45:22,799 --> 01:45:25,927

01:45:45,855 --> 01:46:08,371
TCTahalapTthy

1074
01:46:13,015 --> 01:46:13,538
Enough of your shaking Iegs,
Minister is coming, cIear out.

1075
01:46:15,485 --> 01:46:17,715
WiII you come?- Got cash?

1076
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,684
Not free?- BIoody dirty face!

1077
01:46:22,024 --> 01:46:22,922
WeIcome Home Minister!

1078
01:46:29,332 --> 01:46:30,697
I want to pIay a game with them.

1079
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,366
What game?

1080
01:46:31,567 --> 01:46:35,128
I'II chase one of them, if I catch him,

1081
01:46:35,338 --> 01:46:36,600
...he must strip.

1082
01:46:38,307 --> 01:46:41,708
Mad boy! He's very enthusiastic
to pIay...Iet him pIay.

1083
01:46:51,387 --> 01:46:53,855
ASP! Why are you getting so angry?

1084
01:46:54,056 --> 01:46:57,048
PoIice are friends of peopIe.

1085
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,818
You must pIay and be friendIy with them.

1086
01:46:59,028 --> 01:47:01,258
OnIy then they wiII have faith on us.

1087
01:47:01,631 --> 01:47:03,758
Keep it inside...keep it.

1088
01:47:10,606 --> 01:47:12,039
Start your game son.

1089
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:23,776
TCTahalapTthy

1090
01:47:39,936 --> 01:47:42,837
Strip...strip your uniform...

1091
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:45,500
Come on strip.

1092
01:47:54,116 --> 01:47:57,381
Losing poIiceman's beIt,
I'II use it for our buffaIo.

1093
01:47:58,154 --> 01:47:59,815
Remove your pant...

1094
01:48:00,423 --> 01:48:01,947
Remove...remove...

1095
01:48:04,627 --> 01:48:05,992
Now...

1096
01:48:08,865 --> 01:48:10,196
...the PoIiceman with moustache!

1097
01:48:37,126 --> 01:48:39,560
He's running way...I'II catch him...catch him.

1098
01:49:19,769 --> 01:49:20,827
My son!

1099
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:41,179
My son!

1100
01:49:43,893 --> 01:49:49,763
FiIe an FIR as a mad man
jumped down to his death.

1101
01:49:49,966 --> 01:49:51,991
Take Home Minister's signature as witness.

1102
01:49:52,201 --> 01:49:54,692
If it's not enough take his
father's signature too.

1103
01:50:00,476 --> 01:50:05,846
Not onIy a PoIiceman,
even his uniform wiII be on duty.

1104
01:50:27,703 --> 01:50:37,669
TCTahalapTthy

1105
01:50:46,822 --> 01:50:48,619
May god bIess you with
a Iong and happy Iife!

1106
01:50:59,668 --> 01:51:01,636
I'm Prakash Mehra,
I'm a journaIist.

1107
01:51:02,838 --> 01:51:04,465
This is demoness HoIika,

1108
01:51:04,673 --> 01:51:06,971
HoIi is ceIebrated to mark
God kiIIing this HoIika.

1109
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,637
We are not ceIebrating today for it,

1110
01:51:09,912 --> 01:51:13,473
but forthe death of Munna.

1111
01:51:15,051 --> 01:51:17,815
Sir, Iook at the happiness
in these peopIe's faces.

1112
01:51:18,354 --> 01:51:21,812
If you get rid of othertwo peopIe,
it's festivaI everyday here.

1113
01:51:23,192 --> 01:51:25,160
This must become theirfuneraI pyre.

1114
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:04,857
Yes sir.

1115
01:52:05,067 --> 01:52:08,366
I suspect TitIa's men are
in this crowd, aIert aII our men.

1116
01:53:14,303 --> 01:53:17,101
Coward backstabs.

1117
01:53:17,306 --> 01:53:19,274
Man fights face to face.

1118
01:54:51,066 --> 01:54:53,694
When I face death,
fear shouIdn't be seen in my eyes,

1119
01:55:01,076 --> 01:55:04,876
I must be smiIing and my hand shouId
be smooching my moustache.

1120
01:55:16,258 --> 01:55:26,224
TCTahalapTthy

1121
01:56:09,311 --> 01:56:13,771
Vikram Rathore...great poIice officer.

1122
01:56:15,684 --> 01:56:21,122
You worshipped him Iike god for
his uniform, his power and manIiness.

1123
01:56:21,323 --> 01:56:24,451
Look at your God's fate.

1124
01:56:26,362 --> 01:56:29,456
He died with just one buIIet, bIoody.

1125
01:56:29,665 --> 01:56:31,462
Is he the man to change your Iives?

1126
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,800
Hear me, my brother Bavuji
writes the fate of this pIace,

1127
01:56:36,004 --> 01:56:38,472
Even if God himseIf descends here
can't aIter one Iine aIso.

1128
01:56:38,674 --> 01:56:39,971
He'II meet the same fate.

1129
01:56:41,176 --> 01:56:49,311
Because your God drinks nectar,
but I drink bIood.

1130
01:56:59,862 --> 01:57:01,489
BIoody, he's dead.

1131
01:57:02,865 --> 01:57:05,493
Dead Rajput shouIdn't
Ieave this worId aIone.

1132
01:57:05,701 --> 01:57:11,662
That's why I kiIIed you, dog!
Before my son is reduced to ashes.

1133
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:19,676
Show his grave before any new
poIice officertakes charge here.

1134
01:57:31,894 --> 01:57:33,361
Sir, he's stiII aIive.

1135
01:57:38,734 --> 01:57:42,693
Every body be caIm,
pIease keep this as secret...

1136
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:48,872
He's a God to us aIso, we swear on
our chiIdren to keep the secret.

1137
01:57:51,079 --> 01:57:52,546
After knowing he's aIive,

1138
01:57:52,915 --> 01:57:56,373
to make Bavuji beIieve it,
we buried an empty coffin.

1139
01:57:56,652 --> 01:58:00,884
We managed to save his Iife temporariIy
with aII our medicaI knowIedge.

1140
01:58:01,089 --> 01:58:04,058
We shifted him to Hyderabad
for his safety.

1141
01:58:04,426 --> 01:58:05,893
On consuIting doctors here,

1142
01:58:06,428 --> 01:58:10,387
they say his survivaI is very bIeak
and may die any moment.

1143
01:58:11,767 --> 01:58:15,567
His daughter's probIem was more painfuI
than his impending death.

1144
01:58:16,104 --> 01:58:18,231
She'II not eat untiI he feeds,
and never sIeeps without him.

1145
01:58:19,274 --> 01:58:21,401
We saw you in those circumstances.

1146
01:58:21,777 --> 01:58:24,075
We inquired about you thoroughIy.

1147
01:58:24,346 --> 01:58:26,075
We know you hate chiIdren.

1148
01:58:26,615 --> 01:58:31,643
We wanted herto be with you
pIaying aII sorts of drama.

1149
01:58:31,787 --> 01:58:34,415
You know what had
happened afterthat.

1150
01:58:35,123 --> 01:58:39,423
It was our mistake to troubIe you
without any connection to this.

1151
01:58:39,962 --> 01:58:43,591
We didn't have any other way
to find a fatherto her.

1152
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,768
How are we to say sorry to you?
- No need.

1153
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:53,106
We pray to God for his Iife.

1154
01:58:56,645 --> 01:58:58,272
If you've anything to teII him, you can.

1155
01:59:10,659 --> 01:59:11,455
Brother.

1156
01:59:17,165 --> 01:59:19,793
TeII me sir...teII me sir.

1157
01:59:21,503 --> 01:59:22,970
Don't worry about your daughter.

1158
01:59:23,171 --> 01:59:24,638
She's my daughter.

1159
01:59:37,519 --> 01:59:38,315
Father.

1160
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,656
What happened father?

1161
01:59:50,766 --> 01:59:53,496
Nothing dear, uncIe is unabIe to sIeep.

1162
01:59:53,702 --> 01:59:54,669
So we are here to...

1163
02:00:11,553 --> 02:00:14,021
This song wiII put him to sIeep, father.

1164
02:00:54,463 --> 02:00:59,594
I fear of not keeping up my promise.

1165
02:01:01,103 --> 02:01:05,403
Not onIy poIiceman,
even his uniform does the duty.

1166
02:01:08,377 --> 02:01:09,344
Devgarh

1167
02:01:11,113 --> 02:01:12,910
Beat those bastards. TeII me.

1168
02:01:13,415 --> 02:01:14,541
TeII me, where is he?

1169
02:01:15,083 --> 02:01:16,380
LoyaIty to the master.

1170
02:01:16,752 --> 02:01:18,720
So arrogant?

1171
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:21,048
Where have you hidden him?

1172
02:01:22,424 --> 02:01:27,054
They say he's dead, why are you
asking them, where is he?

1173
02:01:27,929 --> 02:01:31,228
If they reveaI the pIace, you'II open
the grave to see his body.

1174
02:01:31,433 --> 02:01:33,560
His body too wiII spring up to
do duty on seeing you.

1175
02:01:33,769 --> 02:01:34,895
Why are you itching for it?

1176
02:01:35,103 --> 02:01:36,570
Brother-in-Iaw! - Shut you, crook.

1177
02:01:36,938 --> 02:01:40,237
He's unIike us, he stands by his word.

1178
02:01:40,442 --> 02:01:42,410
If he's aIive, he'II come uninvited.

1179
02:01:46,448 --> 02:01:50,077
If he comes, he'II not go without
compIeting his mission.

1180
02:01:55,457 --> 02:02:01,259
I too wish the same, he must
come to die in my hands.

1181
02:02:01,463 --> 02:02:04,261
Don't say he must come,
God's may bIess so be it.

1182
02:02:04,466 --> 02:02:07,094
If they, you are finished.

1183
02:02:13,475 --> 02:02:17,275
You Iook very happy,
pay fine of Rs.50 for whistIing.

1184
02:02:18,313 --> 02:02:20,440
I'm Duvva AbbuIu.- I asked money.

1185
02:02:20,649 --> 02:02:22,116
Pay man. - If I say no.

1186
02:02:22,317 --> 02:02:23,614
Your body wiII be found on tracks.

1187
02:02:23,819 --> 02:02:24,786
Is the pIatform fuII?

1188
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,288
Hey, he's cracking jokes man.

1189
02:02:27,522 --> 02:02:29,786
Thrash him up.-WiII I keep quiet?

1190
02:02:30,325 --> 02:02:31,792
I'm Vikram Rathore's assistant.

1191
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:36,460
Vikram Rathore? He's dead.
That's why we're back into the business.

1192
02:02:36,665 --> 02:02:38,132
Is it? Look there!

1193
02:02:43,505 --> 02:02:45,132
Brother has come back.

1194
02:02:45,841 --> 02:02:46,637
May god bIess you a Iong Iife.

1195
02:02:54,182 --> 02:02:55,809
Brother. -Are you fine kid?

1196
02:02:56,351 --> 02:02:59,149
I beg you sir, start from here sir.

1197
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:05,982
If you start from there,
I can't bearthe tension.

1198
02:03:07,028 --> 02:03:10,327
Don't formuIate new ruIes,
you start from here sir.

1199
02:03:10,532 --> 02:03:12,659
Not now boys, I've much work
to do in the viIIage.

1200
02:03:13,034 --> 02:03:15,832
I'II take a day off and
spend it on you.

1201
02:03:16,204 --> 02:03:20,163
Okay sir, we'II stay here
tiII you come.

1202
02:03:20,709 --> 02:03:24,668
Dead...dead...how many
times wiII he die?

1203
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,006
Do you need it now?

1204
02:03:26,214 --> 02:03:28,011
He may hearyour shouts
and come back aIive.

1205
02:03:42,731 --> 02:03:46,360
Is it your In-Iaw's pIace
to put right Ieg first?

1206
02:03:46,601 --> 02:03:50,196
Cunning viIIain's house,
they must perish with my arrivaI.

1207
02:03:50,806 --> 02:03:52,865
Put forward your Ieft Ieg.

1208
02:03:53,608 --> 02:04:03,574
TCTahalapTthy

1209
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,217
What is he? - God bIessed.

1210
02:04:11,092 --> 02:04:13,219
Hey Bavuji! It seems you yearned to see me.

1211
02:04:13,495 --> 02:04:16,726
You escaped Iike a coward
pIaying death drama.

1212
02:04:17,432 --> 02:04:22,062
One hit and you needed
6 months to recover. - I died?

1213
02:04:22,437 --> 02:04:28,239
You were mourning your son's death,
I gave IittIe time to recoverfrom it.

1214
02:04:29,110 --> 02:04:32,238
Foundation for peace was Iaid
with your son's death,

1215
02:04:32,447 --> 02:04:36,747
If I kiII you and your brother,
the viIIage's fate wiII change for good.

1216
02:04:36,952 --> 02:04:38,920
You can't harm me in any way.

1217
02:04:39,287 --> 02:04:41,414
I'm the onIy rowdy to this viIIage.

1218
02:04:41,623 --> 02:04:43,090
You're right, I'm aIso saying the same.

1219
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:46,749
There must be onIy one,
it must be the poIiceman.

1220
02:04:47,996 --> 02:04:52,763
Forget about aII this crap taIk, get as
many rowdies as possibIe for heIp,

1221
02:04:52,968 --> 02:04:53,764
caII press media aIso.

1222
02:04:54,135 --> 02:04:56,603
Tomorrow morning by 9 am,

1223
02:04:56,805 --> 02:04:59,774
I'II distribute aII the stock
you're hoarding to pubIic.

1224
02:04:59,975 --> 02:05:01,101
In fuII pubIic gIare.

1225
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:04,608
Do whateveryou can.

1226
02:05:04,813 --> 02:05:06,440
Your history is over.

1227
02:05:06,815 --> 02:05:08,442
Your Iife hereafter...

1228
02:05:26,668 --> 02:05:29,466
What is he teIIing this new word?

1229
02:05:29,671 --> 02:05:30,968
Jintha means base.

1230
02:05:31,172 --> 02:05:32,139
Thatha means baton.

1231
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,637
Chithak means chutney.

1232
02:05:33,842 --> 02:05:36,970
It means I'II beat with baton to
make chutney of your base.

1233
02:05:50,058 --> 02:05:51,821
Sathibabu's words are Iies.

1234
02:05:52,027 --> 02:05:53,324
His Iove is aIso faIse.

1235
02:05:53,595 --> 02:05:56,996
If the girI wasn't his daughter,
he wouId've come here by now.

1236
02:05:57,265 --> 02:06:00,666
Listen to me accept the marriage
proposaI yourfather has brought.

1237
02:06:00,869 --> 02:06:03,167
If you don't he's refusing
to come home.

1238
02:06:03,371 --> 02:06:05,498
Listen to me and agree.

1239
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,002
I don't Iike mother.

1240
02:06:07,876 --> 02:06:11,676
I feeI I made a mistake
by refusing Sathibabu.

1241
02:06:22,557 --> 02:06:24,855
You're not Sathibabu,
but Vikram Rathore.

1242
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:29,190
We'II be in troubIe if anyone knows
about impersonisation.

1243
02:06:29,397 --> 02:06:30,523
HandIe it cIeverIy.

1244
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,708
WiII you Ieave me if my parents
accuse you of Iying?

1245
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,207
Do you know how eagerIy
I was waiting foryou?

1246
02:06:45,313 --> 02:06:47,042
Who are you?

1247
02:06:47,248 --> 02:06:49,216
Asking me who am I, Sathibabu?

1248
02:06:49,751 --> 02:06:52,049
Sathibabu?

1249
02:06:56,925 --> 02:06:58,051
ASP?

1250
02:06:58,326 --> 02:07:01,386
Sathibabu is my repIica and my daughter
stayed with him for a week,

1251
02:07:01,663 --> 02:07:03,392
he said his girI friend Ieft
him mistaking him?

1252
02:07:09,004 --> 02:07:10,733
You Iost a good man.

1253
02:07:12,273 --> 02:07:13,900
Don't act smart with me.

1254
02:07:14,943 --> 02:07:19,403
FaIIing in Iove with you,
I've become very shrewd.

1255
02:07:20,115 --> 02:07:22,583
I'II give you a jerk.

1256
02:07:22,817 --> 02:07:25,752
ActuaIIy many girIs got
confused seeing me...

1257
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,427
What's this?

1258
02:07:58,653 --> 02:08:01,622
What's the exposing?
Aren't you ashamed?

1259
02:08:02,057 --> 02:08:04,116
WiII you show me your waist?
I'II arrest you.

1260
02:08:04,325 --> 02:08:04,950
CIose it.

1261
02:08:06,061 --> 02:08:08,962
Aren't you reaIIy not Sathibabu?

1262
02:08:09,164 --> 02:08:10,961
StiII any doubt afterthis incident?

1263
02:08:11,499 --> 02:08:13,126
Where is Sathibabu?- HimaIayas.

1264
02:08:13,334 --> 02:08:13,800
Why?

1265
02:08:14,002 --> 02:08:16,527
Any man disiIIusioned with
woman goes there onIy.

1266
02:08:16,738 --> 02:08:19,536
Because he needs a wet cIoth
to sIeep at night.

1267
02:08:19,908 --> 02:08:21,535
Won't he come back?
-Why wiII he not?

1268
02:08:21,743 --> 02:08:24,712
Today is fuII moon day,
take head bath at midnight,

1269
02:08:24,913 --> 02:08:27,711
wear a white sari beIow your naveI
and go to the terrace.

1270
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:29,406
Where are HimaIayas? - North.

1271
02:08:29,617 --> 02:08:36,045
CaII him with Iove, AthiIi!
He'II appear before you.

1272
02:09:03,551 --> 02:09:07,180
It seems he'II come if I caII him
from terrace at midnight?

1273
02:09:07,655 --> 02:09:10,590
PoIiceman is trying to fooI me.

1274
02:09:14,963 --> 02:09:16,954
If it turns true,
may be I'II miss him.

1275
02:09:17,165 --> 02:09:18,598
Let me try it.

1276
02:09:28,409 --> 02:09:29,376
beIow the naveI!

1277
02:09:49,564 --> 02:09:50,553
UncIe.

1278
02:09:51,266 --> 02:09:53,598
Didn't get sIeep?

1279
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:56,133
If you sIeep, I'II aIso get sIeep, uncIe.

1280
02:09:57,906 --> 02:09:58,804
WiII you have miIk?

1281
02:09:59,641 --> 02:10:00,630
WiII you?

1282
02:10:01,176 --> 02:10:02,666
Are you watching over me?

1283
02:10:02,877 --> 02:10:06,313
If I add IittIe IocaI stuff to it,
entire dept. wiII come to wake you up.

1284
02:10:14,189 --> 02:10:16,157
Take it...have it.

1285
02:10:19,694 --> 02:10:22,356
Hey AbbuIu! How cIeveryou are!

1286
02:10:22,564 --> 02:10:25,397
Let your inteIIigence go to heII!

1287
02:10:30,038 --> 02:10:32,939
I never expected to
get rid of her so easiIy.

1288
02:10:34,409 --> 02:10:36,434
What?
- Come.

1289
02:10:37,478 --> 02:10:38,445
Come.
-Where?

1290
02:10:38,646 --> 02:10:41,945
Inside. Into the Iock up.
Come.

1291
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:43,947
What's this?

1292
02:10:44,152 --> 02:10:46,279
The stuff has compIeteIy taken over her.

1293
02:10:46,487 --> 02:10:49,945
You handcuff peopIe before
putting them in Iock up, right?

1294
02:10:52,727 --> 02:10:54,126
Stay put here.

1295
02:10:55,563 --> 02:10:56,461
Escape!

1296
02:10:58,333 --> 02:11:02,201
Thank God! I escaped from her.

1297
02:11:02,437 --> 02:11:04,132
She's not foIIowing me, is she?

1298
02:11:05,573 --> 02:11:07,473
Won't I steaI her home before she comes?

1299
02:11:07,675 --> 02:11:09,666
Before she bats her eye once!

1300
02:11:09,877 --> 02:11:11,902
Goddess of WeaIth must appear before me.

1301
02:11:28,029 --> 02:11:28,961
Say it with Iove

1302
02:11:51,185 --> 02:11:54,348
It seems you went away to
HimaIayas getting angry on me.

1303
02:11:54,555 --> 02:11:57,581
Yes, if you'd deIayed a IittIe
I wouId've drank hoIy water.

1304
02:11:57,892 --> 02:11:59,189
Our Iove wouId vanish.

1305
02:12:01,629 --> 02:12:04,097
Do you know how anxious I was foryou?

1306
02:12:04,299 --> 02:12:06,358
Thief! I got you!

1307
02:12:06,801 --> 02:12:08,962
Who are you? Get out!

1308
02:12:10,405 --> 02:12:13,238
Who are you? Thief hid it.

1309
02:12:13,441 --> 02:12:15,375
What's aII this?
- Take your hands off, what's there?

1310
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:18,870
Baton! Thief hid it.

1311
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:22,711
Come, I must put you in
Iock up and thrash you.

1312
02:12:22,984 --> 02:12:24,975
CeII wiII disintegrate,
take your Iegs off.

1313
02:12:25,186 --> 02:12:27,711
He's my thief, my wiII and wish.

1314
02:12:28,056 --> 02:12:30,115
Sathibabu, teII herto
take her Iegs on you.

1315
02:12:30,525 --> 02:12:33,119
I'II not, if you want put your Iegs on him.

1316
02:12:33,928 --> 02:12:35,122
You bIoody!

1317
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:43,735
Come... - Come...

1318
02:12:43,938 --> 02:12:47,738
Let you both go to heII!
You're breaking my waist!

1319
02:12:48,009 --> 02:12:51,604
A Ieg from there and a Ieg
from here, AthiIi in between.

1320
02:12:51,813 --> 02:12:54,646
PIay...have a baII!

1321
02:12:55,550 --> 02:13:11,922
TCTahalapTthy

1322
02:13:18,573 --> 02:13:21,542
If you see me...

1323
02:13:21,743 --> 02:13:24,906
If I come to your house...

1324
02:13:25,113 --> 02:13:31,814
If I get caught with
you in dark...

1325
02:13:32,019 --> 02:13:45,228
AthiIi Sathibabu
is smooth operator...

1326
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:49,052
Look at me...

1327
02:14:49,530 --> 02:14:52,624
TaIk to me...

1328
02:14:53,067 --> 02:14:55,900
Let me touch you...

1329
02:14:56,103 --> 02:14:59,300
Take on you...

1330
02:14:59,507 --> 02:15:02,943
When Iovers take a decision...

1331
02:15:03,144 --> 02:15:06,580
When they both are interested,
who can stop them?

1332
02:15:07,281 --> 02:15:20,854
TCTahalapTthy

1333
02:15:25,366 --> 02:15:33,603
God came...Lord came...

1334
02:15:33,808 --> 02:15:40,179
Great warrior came gaIIoping on horse...

1335
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:43,942
Lord of Iords came...

1336
02:15:55,429 --> 02:15:58,091
Waking up...

1337
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:01,698
Raking up...

1338
02:16:02,169 --> 02:16:05,195
Dusting up...

1339
02:16:05,506 --> 02:16:12,309
Pinching...

1340
02:16:12,513 --> 02:16:15,710
If both are interested, who can stop them?

1341
02:16:16,951 --> 02:16:33,426
TCTahalapTthy

1342
02:16:37,104 --> 02:16:38,366
We brought the girI to him.

1343
02:16:38,873 --> 02:16:39,999
You made an entry then.

1344
02:16:40,308 --> 02:16:42,503
We were confused to teII you the truth or not.

1345
02:16:42,777 --> 02:16:46,713
He Ieft you for us and the IittIe girI,
certainIy not to cheat you.

1346
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:54,280
No probIem.

1347
02:16:54,655 --> 02:16:57,123
Hereafter she's my responsibiIity.

1348
02:17:05,733 --> 02:17:08,964
It's going to ring 9, Vikram Rathore
vowed to Ioot your godowns.

1349
02:17:09,170 --> 02:17:10,034
What are you pIaning to do?

1350
02:17:10,237 --> 02:17:11,864
Either he'II wet his pants
or hang himseIf to death,

1351
02:17:12,073 --> 02:17:12,869
why are you bothered about it?

1352
02:17:13,074 --> 02:17:13,938
Did I give good repartee?

1353
02:17:14,408 --> 02:17:15,204
No?

1354
02:17:16,911 --> 02:17:22,372
See what I'm going to do
and show it to peopIe aIso.

1355
02:17:23,184 --> 02:17:26,881
It's 9! Come on man.

1356
02:17:27,989 --> 02:17:31,447
It's 9.30 now, why hasn't he come yet?

1357
02:17:31,692 --> 02:17:34,661
WiII he wait tiII inauspicious
time eIapses?

1358
02:17:35,763 --> 02:17:37,560
It's 11.30 now.

1359
02:17:37,898 --> 02:17:39,456
Where is the poIiceman?

1360
02:17:39,767 --> 02:17:43,726
He may be sitting in Iock up fearing
the power of my men.

1361
02:17:43,938 --> 02:17:46,099
He won't sit quiet, very cIever man.

1362
02:17:46,307 --> 02:17:47,001
Shut up!

1363
02:17:49,777 --> 02:17:52,075
Hey Where are your godowns man?

1364
02:17:52,279 --> 02:17:54,804
I'm searching every street
trying to find address.

1365
02:17:55,616 --> 02:18:00,644
By the way, I saw a board
Bavuji Iiquorfactory.

1366
02:18:00,855 --> 02:18:02,755
I got bored and bIasted it.

1367
02:18:06,127 --> 02:18:07,924
LittIe incidents Iike this happen,
don't worry about it.

1368
02:18:08,129 --> 02:18:10,029
TeII me the address of your godowns.

1369
02:18:10,231 --> 02:18:13,200
Hey BIoody idiot! If you've guts stay there.

1370
02:18:13,401 --> 02:18:14,766
I'm coming there.

1371
02:18:14,969 --> 02:18:16,834
Is it? Okay, I'II wait here.

1372
02:18:17,038 --> 02:18:18,505
Start the vehicIes.

1373
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:22,576
Sir...sir...you are going away.
What are you going to do now?

1374
02:18:24,145 --> 02:18:25,305
Why are you shocked?

1375
02:18:25,513 --> 02:18:27,606
He Iifts his dhoti to tie up
whiIe Ieaving for a war.

1376
02:18:27,815 --> 02:18:28,782
That's aII!

1377
02:18:29,550 --> 02:18:39,516
TCTahalapTthy

1378
02:19:07,354 --> 02:19:09,117
Didn't he come?

1379
02:19:09,323 --> 02:19:10,449
He Ieft just now getting a phone caII.

1380
02:19:10,658 --> 02:19:13,627
Went away?
BIoody bastard!

1381
02:19:13,828 --> 02:19:15,796
I chaIIenged him openIy to come
with his entire gang,

1382
02:19:15,996 --> 02:19:18,794
that I wiII beat him stripping
him in pubIic.

1383
02:19:18,999 --> 02:19:19,897
He ran away.

1384
02:19:20,501 --> 02:19:22,560
He's a viIIain and you are afraid of him.

1385
02:19:22,770 --> 02:19:27,366
TiII now he tortured you aII,
so I'm distributing his weaIth.

1386
02:19:27,575 --> 02:19:28,473
Loot it.

1387
02:19:28,743 --> 02:19:29,505
Is it on air Iive?

1388
02:19:29,710 --> 02:19:30,699
Just a minute.

1389
02:19:31,645 --> 02:19:34,637
See, everyone in the viIIage
watch this program.

1390
02:19:34,849 --> 02:19:37,875
See how Bavuji ran away from battIefieId
with taiI between his Iegs.

1391
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:40,584
What's this bIocking the road?

1392
02:19:41,021 --> 02:19:44,149
Why did you ran away
before I came here?

1393
02:19:45,693 --> 02:19:47,320
Okay, I'II give you another chance.

1394
02:19:47,528 --> 02:19:50,986
I'II wait in the main centre
to Iynch you with pubIic fury,

1395
02:19:51,198 --> 02:19:55,396
if you've guts, if you drink cow's urine,

1396
02:19:55,603 --> 02:20:00,233
come there.
Hey shorty, you'II get the shock of Iife.

1397
02:20:06,213 --> 02:20:07,737
Turn the vehicIes.

1398
02:20:09,383 --> 02:20:11,647
Take out vehicIes, turn the vehicIes.

1399
02:20:11,852 --> 02:20:12,682
WhiIing away time with this.

1400
02:20:12,887 --> 02:20:15,219
You must take out reaI things
to fight not vehicIes.

1401
02:20:15,422 --> 02:20:16,252
Coming.

1402
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:28,595
Good...very good...
gathered a good crowd.

1403
02:20:28,803 --> 02:20:34,105
Let the reaI man in this crowd
dare to fight me. Come out!

1404
02:20:37,211 --> 02:20:39,873
If one of you steps forward today,
it wiII be end of Bavuji's Iife.

1405
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:43,311
Come out...come out...how can they?

1406
02:20:43,517 --> 02:20:48,648
BIood isn't running in their veins,
it's my urine.

1407
02:20:49,423 --> 02:20:52,051
Not a man is getting angry
hearing his derogatory words.

1408
02:20:52,259 --> 02:20:54,227
Don't get scared of men behind him.

1409
02:20:54,428 --> 02:21:00,367
Your exhortations are in vain,
nobody wiII dare to go against me.

1410
02:21:00,568 --> 02:21:07,974
At a snap of my finger women wiII Ieave
their husbands to sIeep with me,

1411
02:21:08,609 --> 02:21:10,133
want to see it?

1412
02:21:16,617 --> 02:21:20,109
Hey you! Come here.

1413
02:21:37,471 --> 02:21:42,932
I may not be as good as my son,
but I can at Ieast do it once in a month.

1414
02:21:44,211 --> 02:21:45,371
Sit here.

1415
02:21:54,722 --> 02:21:56,451
WiII you caII me, bastard?

1416
02:21:56,657 --> 02:21:58,249
If I dared Iike this earIier,

1417
02:21:58,459 --> 02:22:03,021
I wouId've kiIIed both son & father,
and sIept with your bodies, bastard.

1418
02:22:03,497 --> 02:22:06,125
WeII done sister! Beat him!

1419
02:22:13,574 --> 02:22:15,633
He sIapped his thigh Iike Duryodhana.

1420
02:22:15,843 --> 02:22:16,935
He's done with it.

1421
02:22:30,024 --> 02:22:31,218
Stop it.

1422
02:22:31,659 --> 02:22:33,354
Get up you shorty.

1423
02:22:35,195 --> 02:22:37,254
A Iady kicked you in pubIic,
are you a rowdy?

1424
02:22:37,464 --> 02:22:40,399
Whatever Ieft wiII be squeezed
out by poIice, come.

1425
02:22:43,404 --> 02:22:46,567
Beat them, thrash them.

1426
02:22:46,774 --> 02:22:49,743
They must wet their dhotis
on seeing poIice uniform.

1427
02:22:49,944 --> 02:22:50,672
Beat them.

1428
02:22:51,078 --> 02:22:55,742
Oh No! Stop...stop...stop it.
ASP, what is this?

1429
02:22:56,417 --> 02:22:57,315
So many batons?

1430
02:22:57,518 --> 02:22:59,145
Did you use aII of it on him?

1431
02:22:59,353 --> 02:23:02,754
We used 95 out of 100,
am I right Bavuji?

1432
02:23:02,957 --> 02:23:04,288
Stop it!.

1433
02:23:04,491 --> 02:23:09,121
WiII you beat a powerfuI man
in station in my absence?

1434
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:11,127
Sorry sir, I made mistake.

1435
02:23:11,332 --> 02:23:12,264
Stop it.

1436
02:23:16,503 --> 02:23:18,801
Sir is feeIing for missing the show.

1437
02:23:19,006 --> 02:23:20,530
Let's start aII over again.

1438
02:23:22,576 --> 02:23:24,043
Go...go...go away bIoody rascaI.

1439
02:23:24,244 --> 02:23:26,872
Have you come to get me
beaten up again?

1440
02:23:27,081 --> 02:23:30,107
Go...go...go away.

1441
02:23:30,784 --> 02:23:33,048
He's getting anxious,
can't you share his punishment?

1442
02:23:33,253 --> 02:23:35,551
You'II Iose your poIiticaI overweight.

1443
02:23:35,756 --> 02:23:38,748
I'm very deIicate.
I can't take the stick.

1444
02:23:38,959 --> 02:23:41,928
Bavuji...bye.-You thrash him.

1445
02:23:42,262 --> 02:23:43,490
One minute sir.

1446
02:23:43,697 --> 02:23:47,963
I thought I'II go to jaiI Iike Ramadasu,
but you are in jaiI now.

1447
02:23:48,268 --> 02:23:50,964
No probIem, I'II share your agony.

1448
02:23:51,171 --> 02:23:52,832
You'II get beaten up and I'II cry.

1449
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:53,802
Beat him.

1450
02:23:58,012 --> 02:24:07,978
TCTahalapTthy

1451
02:24:19,433 --> 02:24:24,530
Get it down...sIowIy...that's it.

1452
02:24:28,842 --> 02:24:29,866
What happened brother?

1453
02:24:34,181 --> 02:24:36,649
I want his peopIe.

1454
02:24:54,868 --> 02:24:59,032
Don't cry dear.
We needn't fearfor anything.

1455
02:24:59,206 --> 02:25:00,571
ShaII I teII you a story?

1456
02:25:00,908 --> 02:25:04,571
Once upon a time there Iived
a dacoit gang in ChambaI vaIIey,

1457
02:25:05,879 --> 02:25:07,244
Like these wastreIs.

1458
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:13,651
A good poIice came there.

1459
02:25:14,121 --> 02:25:15,247
Like yourfather.

1460
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:21,591
Father came and made
mincemeat of those dacoits.

1461
02:25:31,905 --> 02:25:37,207
Rathore knows the power of my
knock out punch from experience.

1462
02:25:38,579 --> 02:25:42,106
Vikram Rathore is dead.

1463
02:25:44,084 --> 02:25:49,784
The man coming now
is AthiIi Sathibabu.

1464
02:25:54,428 --> 02:25:58,125
You kiIIed Vikram Rathore treacherousIy.

1465
02:25:58,332 --> 02:26:01,631
But Sathibabu is a master crook himseIf.

1466
02:26:02,035 --> 02:26:03,832
You can't harm him in anyway.

1467
02:26:05,939 --> 02:26:09,466
Listen to me and vacate the
pIace before he comes here.

1468
02:26:09,676 --> 02:26:12,509
Otherwise you wiII feeI for it.

1469
02:26:25,025 --> 02:26:26,515
You'II be finished.

1470
02:26:27,961 --> 02:26:29,519
What's the meaning of it?

1471
02:26:29,997 --> 02:26:31,521
I'II teII you.

1472
02:26:31,798 --> 02:26:32,992
Jintha means base.

1473
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,326
Thatha means baton.

1474
02:26:34,535 --> 02:26:36,332
Chithak means chutney.

1475
02:26:36,537 --> 02:26:40,098
It means baton wiII make
chutney of your base.

1476
02:26:40,474 --> 02:26:41,702
Another info brother-in-Iaw,

1477
02:26:41,909 --> 02:26:44,503
anybody who asked the meaning
of this got the stick.

1478
02:26:44,745 --> 02:26:48,340
First to eIder brother-in-Iaw, second...

1479
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:53,784
Is he such a great man?

1480
02:26:53,987 --> 02:26:56,956
Let me see what he can do
if I kiII his daughter.

1481
02:27:06,333 --> 02:27:09,029
No need to touch my daughter
with bad intention,

1482
02:27:09,236 --> 02:27:11,704
even if you think of it, I'II kiII you.

1483
02:27:12,806 --> 02:27:14,637
He has come, I'II escape.

1484
02:28:50,937 --> 02:28:51,904
Go...go.

1485
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:55,448
You were right.

1486
02:32:56,416 --> 02:33:00,375
Your man made a mincemeat of me.

1487
02:33:02,188 --> 02:33:05,157
But I can't pIay drums.

1488
02:33:05,892 --> 02:33:08,884
I know onIy to take Iives.

1489
02:34:12,792 --> 02:34:14,783
Who wiII offer aIms if you sit
here with begging bowI?

1490
02:34:14,995 --> 02:34:16,986
Go and seek aIms in viIIage.

1491
02:34:17,197 --> 02:34:18,630
There are four others depending on you.

1492
02:34:19,099 --> 02:34:19,963
Brother-in-Iaw.

1493
02:34:23,036 --> 02:34:25,231
My wife is shouting at me for not
coming home for a month.

1494
02:34:25,438 --> 02:34:27,133
If you move I'II kiII you.

1495
02:34:27,407 --> 02:34:29,432
I may get beaten up your share aIso.

1496
02:34:29,643 --> 02:34:32,237
Sir, pIease give me aIms,
it's two days since I ate.

1497
02:34:32,545 --> 02:34:34,410
We are in this position for a month.
Go away.

1498
02:34:34,748 --> 02:34:35,772
Your goat is dead.

1499
02:34:36,616 --> 02:34:37,708
Look, the tiger has come.

1500
02:34:37,917 --> 02:34:38,713
AII are dead.

1501
02:34:38,918 --> 02:34:40,909
We are ready sir.

1502
02:34:41,121 --> 02:34:42,315
Give our quota to us.

1503
02:34:42,522 --> 02:34:43,750
I'm not in mood now.

1504
02:34:43,957 --> 02:34:46,016
You stay here onIy or eIse
the quota wiII doubIe up.

1505
02:34:46,226 --> 02:34:47,784
No sir, singIe is enough.
