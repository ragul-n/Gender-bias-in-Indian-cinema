00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,230
[Prayer]

2
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,980
Hey, didn’t we discuss that
we wouldn’t harm any living thing?

3
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Drive carefully!

4
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,310
Yes sir... everything looks clear on the left side

5
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,940
There are two guards.
Yes sir.

6
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,650
Hey, why did you stop?

7
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,480
Take the bags soon..
We are running out of time.

8
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,520
A small change in the plan.

9
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,440
Search on the other side.
- Okay sir.

10
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,690
Hello, did you find the black van?

11
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,310
- No sir. Couldn't catch him
the guy drove too fast and he ecaped.

12
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,230
Inform the control room immediately
and alert every check post.

13
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,100
What do you want?
- Ma'am, there is a letter for you.

14
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,900
Hello, Govt. Ladies Hostel.

15
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,150
No way.. Not possible.

16
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,350
Ma'am.

17
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,770
Ma'am.

18
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,900
There is a letter for you.

19
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,650
Thank you.

20
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,270
My hands are dirty... can you read it for me?

21
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,650
Congrats Varalakshmi Madam

22
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,900
In the yearly lucky draw held by Prestige Company
you have won a prize.

23
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,600
Please collect your gift from our Miyapur Office
tommorrow morning at 11:00 a.m.

24
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,100
I have freshly prepared Tamarind rice,
would you like to have some?

25
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,100
Yes please.
- Come in.

26
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,900
This Tamarind rice is delicious madam!

27
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,940
My Son also loves this a lot.

28
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,350
Anyways, you have booked such a big truck.
What’s the cargo?

29
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
It could be either a Fridge or
a washing machine or even a cupboard.

30
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,850
She said it's a huge company
but this place doesn't look like it.

31
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,770
Anyway, it's better I discuss my fare before-hand.

32
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,940
Madam, even if you get small kitchen items as gifts,
You would still have to pay me my auto fare.

33
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,100
Shut up, jinx of a fellow!

34
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,060
Jinx of a fellow...?

35
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,730
Stay there.

36
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay.

37
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
Just a minute...

38
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,650
Just a minute... Just a minute...

39
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,980
Sorry.

40
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
7th floor

41
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,650
7th floor

42
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,850
A Kid!

43
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,350
I got scared, I didn't notice her.

44
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,350
7th floor for you too?

45
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,480
Come in... I've been waiting for you.
Please come in.

46
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,060
Did you send these letters?

47
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,980
I only sent it... please come in.
We'll talk about it.

48
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,310
Thought it was a gift from a huge company.

49
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,940
So, there is only one gift for all of us?
I brought a huge truck thinking otherwise

50
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,400
Looking at this... it doesn't seem like.
- That's what I am not able to understand.

51
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,230
I am Saraswati.

52
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,350
My grandson Jagan.

53
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,690
His first year death anniversary took place recently.

54
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:24,400
Last year, he was one among the five
to be killed in the Panjagutta bank robbery.

55
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,020
Varalakshmi, your son Rajaram
also got killed on the same day.

56
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Priya...

57
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,350
Your fiance Avinash also got killed on the same day.

58
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,310
Swathi's elder Brother, Karthik...
this little girl's father, Brahmam.

59
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,600
All of them got killed on the same day

60
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,270
We are the only ones alive related to these five men

61
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,230
Just like me, all of you are also Orphans now.

62
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:11,940
The 6th person ruthlessly shot and killed our five men.

63
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,100
All of you know, right

64
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,150
Wait... wait.. Wait...

65
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,650
That means, aren't you the one who has been calling me
repeatedly about this case from the last one year?

66
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Not only you... I've been calling all of you.

67
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,520
No one cared about it,
that's why I had to gather us like this

68
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,190
I suffered for a year...

69
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,690
I completed his death rituals.

70
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,850
I've decided to not put up with this anymore.

71
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,690
I will take my revenge now.

72
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,400
Revenge..?

73
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,650
Yes, all of you have to join me.
Let's kill him together

74
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,690
What is this...?

75
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,270
Have you gone crazy?

76
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,900
How old are you..?

77
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,520
May be 80 years.

78
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,100
Forget about you and me...
we finished more than half of our lives

79
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,650
This little baby...

80
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,350
This young girl can study and has a bright future...

81
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,980
This one can get married and look forward to a happy life...

82
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
do you want to sacrifice everyone for your revenge?

83
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,230
Yes... even I am suffering my son's death

84
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,400
I am also angry on the murderer

85
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:45,650
I pray everyday that murderer suffers...
what else can I do?

86
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,690
Why are you smiling?

87
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,650
What is the matter?

88
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,190
Looks like the gifts are heavy,
do you want me to help you?

89
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,190
My foot!

90
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,350
You successfully jinxed my lucky draw.

91
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,850
I'll break your legs if I see you again.

92
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,690
Madam, my fare?
- Go away. You Idiot.

93
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,060
Granny, we are common women.

94
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,150
We won't be able to do it.

95
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,270
Just because of we are women...

96
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,560
should we let go off the revenge and sit helplessly?

97
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,230
We are women.

98
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,520
We can give life to a person...

99
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,730
taking it away shouldn't be that tough.

100
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:37,980
If that murderer killed us instead of our men...
wouldn't they get back to kill him?

101
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,230
Don't you understand?

102
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,600
Irrespective of you four joining me, I am going to kill him.

103
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,770
All of you can leave now.

104
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Oh, my baby...

105
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,100
This little girl can't talk...

106
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,440
she lost her mom at a very young age...

107
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,440
she is living in an orphanage because of that guy.

108
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,100
Granny, I'll also come with you.

109
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,600
We shouldn't leave him.
Let's kill him.

110
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,900
Definitely.

111
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,690
But how...? Where do we start?

112
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:49,060
Killing five people... If he is roaming free for more than
a year after robbing 300 crores... how smart would that guy be..?

113
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,520
To catch hold off someone like him
we need someone who is way smarter than him.

114
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,230
Look at this.

115
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,060
Pencil Parthasarathy!

116
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,270
Famous author who writes only revenge novels.

117
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,940
He has written 28 novels untill now.

118
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,770
I read each of them about ten times.

119
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,770
Every novel has a crime, a murderer...

120
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,150
and to get hold off him there is a hero
who catches him with his wits.

121
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,270
Do you know how well he has written them?

122
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,020
If he has written 28 such novels,

123
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,150
Imagine how revengeful he would be?

124
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,270
Every story has its own way of revenge.

125
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,810
We need this kind of a guy for our revenge.

126
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,730
Is there any address mentioned inside?

127
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,390
Madam!

128
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,720
That is not the house you should be looking at...
this is the one.

129
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,140
How is such a big author living in this garbage?

130
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,220
His situation seems to be worse than ours.

131
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,430
Everyone has their own sentimental reasons.

132
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,180
Maybe he found success here.

133
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,800
It’s not our concern.
Let’s go inside. Come. Come.

134
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,890
(“Jayamu nishchayambura”
song from ‘Shabash Ramudu’ playing)

135
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,800
He has left the door open.

136
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,600
Mr. Pencil?

137
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,010
Is anyone here?

138
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,350
Oh Goodness!

139
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Wow! Thousands of books.

140
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,260
If he has read all these books,
He must definitely be a highly intellectual person.

141
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,470
He must also be an old man!

142
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,970
Anyway, where is he?

143
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,640
He must be inside.

144
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,890
Good. What’s your name?

145
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,760
Catherine.

146
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,220
She is my daughter.
(Watching TV)

147
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,430
I said I want the truth.

148
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,390
She is my sister.

149
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,760
She is my daughter.

150
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,140
My sister.... my daughter.

151
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,350
I said I want the truth!

152
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,720
She is my sister and my daughter!

153
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,350
This... This is what writing means!

154
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,390
This is what climax looks like!
This is what a twist in tale means!

155
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,720
This is how i need to write.
No... I must write this story itself.

156
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,390
I found these in your backyard in the pond

157
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,970
I found these in your backyard in the pond.

158
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,300
I said I want the truth

159
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,510
I said I want the truth

160
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,890
Oh yes, probably

161
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,050
Oh yes, probably

162
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,640
I said I want the truth

163
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,890
He is alone...

164
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,970
Look at how focused he is on his work.

165
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,680
He must be a really good author.

166
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
He is not a good author,
He is a copycat.

167
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,760
He is translating the exact dialogues
into Telugu from English.

168
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,350
Did you notice all the movie DVD's around him?

169
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,800
Show me the books which you got.

170
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,720
Here...

171
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,470
'Raseedu ni champu
('"Kill Bill.")

172
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,970
This is a very good book.

173
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,640
A girl in this book takes revenge against
the villain exactly like us.

174
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,470
She is a pro with fist fights and swords...
She does it all.

175
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,850
I read this but I didn’t understand who this 'Raseedu' is.

176
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,970
Granny, 'Raseedu' is Bill.

177
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,890
It’s a movie... Kill Bill!

178
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,430
Oh Goodness!

179
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,510
'No country for Old men.'
- Oh no!

180
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,260
That’s... No country for Old men.

181
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,430
Oh... Is that so?

182
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,600
'Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang!'
This is really good.

183
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
I read it.

184
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,100
Granny, people are copying novels and making movies.

185
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,720
But he is copying movies and writing novels.

186
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,930
He is a very big fraud!

187
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,100
You only put him on a pedestal.

188
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,390
Chinnu! He might have copied 28 novels...

189
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,680
But he probably read all these books here,
He must have an iota of ....

190
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Oh no....!

191
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,220
Hey... look at this...

192
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,850
Look Grandma, look!

193
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,050
Look at the thousands of books he read.

194
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,680
This is all thermocol!

195
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
He is a fraud! Fraud for sure!

196
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,890
Oh Goodness!

197
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,260
We need to leave from here immediately.

198
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,010
Yes. We must. Let’s go.

199
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,010
Full stop... Full stop... Full stop....

200
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,390
They put four full stops.

201
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,930
The... End.

202
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I finished my 29th novel.

203
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,010
I am going to look at just one novel... just one.

204
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,510
Look... look... let’s take a look at this.

205
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,140
Please come Granny...

206
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,010
he will see us... please let's go.

207
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,850
Come Granny... put it back... put it back.

208
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,430
Oh My Goodness!

209
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,180
Come Granny...

210
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,350
Hello... who is there?

211
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,260
('Nee Toli Choopulone' Song from
'Justice Chowdary' Movie)

212
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,300
Who are you all?

213
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,470
Pencil?

214
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,100
Yes... Yes... I am the pencil.

215
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,550
The famous revenge writer... Pencil Parthasarathy.

216
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
Come ... Come...
Welcome...

217
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,550
My house.

218
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,220
She is wearing a ring, looks like she is married.

219
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,350
Mr. Pencil...

220
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
Pencil, sir...

221
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Sorry...

222
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,430
This is how a writer’s world is, usually filled with books.

223
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,550
All the authors who wrote these Revenge books
aren't writers, they are my relatives...

224
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,470
are my gods.

225
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,800
They are my mentors... It's them
who shaped me into a world-famous Revenge writer.

226
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,100
Uh... we are...
- My fans!

227
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,550
My fans

228
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,010
Am I Right?

229
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,890
Tell me... do you want a selfie or an autograph?

230
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,010
Why would we take a photo with you?

231
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
So why did you come?

232
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,180
A year ago, wasn’t there
a robbery in the Bank at Punjagutta?

233
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,970
Yes. I remember.

234
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,100
One of the robbers brutally murdered the remaining five...

235
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,350
Not brutally granny, he killed easily...

236
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,180
If only he had killed the remaining five
by torturing them repeatedly,

237
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,350
That would have been an interesting material.

238
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,470
Why is she so excited?

239
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,050
This woman is the mother of
one of those five men.

240
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,050
I am the grandmother to one of those men.

241
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,260
She is the sister of one.

242
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,930
Oh god!

243
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,760
That little girl is the daughter...

244
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,260
Oh no.

245
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,850
And this one was to be married to one of them.

246
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,720
That means... Engaged...

247
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,180
Not yet married?

248
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,140
No problem..

249
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,220
I meant... it’s a problem.. How sad!

250
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,390
The sixth person ran away with Rs. 300 crores.

251
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,930
Lucky fellow.

252
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,850
What...?!

253
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,680
Loafer fellow! He committed a gruesome mistake!

254
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,350
That is the reason why we have gotten together.
We wanted to catch him...

255
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,300
What after that...?

256
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
Are planning to kill him.

257
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,100
You wanted to kill him?

258
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,510
Wonderful idea!

259
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,140
'Everyone should be happy.'

260
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,100
All the very best.

261
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,260
Kill him.

262
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,890
We need your help for our revenge.

263
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,430
May I know why you guys chose me
for such a prestigious project?

264
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,100
I read all of your 28 novels.
All of them were about revenge.

265
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,760
They are very well-written.

266
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,100
That is why with your advice and direction,
We wanted to catch that murderer.

267
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,550
We want you to join us Pencil.

268
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,140
Work with us, please.

269
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,140
Work...?

270
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,720
Work means money.

271
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,010
One lakh per person...

272
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,890
There are five people, so five lakhs...

273
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,720
But regarding the payment,
it wouldn’t be less than 5 lakhs.

274
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,640
5 lakhs?

275
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,800
We can’t afford any cash.

276
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,680
It's okay... then pay through cheque.

277
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,600
We are very poor. We don’t have any money.

278
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,600
That is why we need your help.

279
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,260
Help?

280
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Social service?

281
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,350
Help...

282
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,180
Pure help.

283
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,140
Mr Pencil.

284
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,850
Get up!

285
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,720
Get up!

286
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,010
Get the hell up!

287
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,050
Free help, is it?

288
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,180
Why are you sitting here?

289
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,180
Did you not wonder who would take a photo with me?

290
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,050
Get up!

291
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,720
Don’t push me!
- Push you? I should kick you.

292
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,430
And you little thing?
Leave that doll alone.

293
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,510
Leave that doll alone.

294
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,510
Look at this arrogant kid.

295
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,100
What...?

296
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,890
All of you have become a gang?
Get out everybody!

297
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,430
Get the hell out!

298
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,930
Ok, we will go.

299
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,260
Give me your phone number.

300
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,300
Should I give my phone number.

301
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,140
Who asked for yours, old lady?

302
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,600
Didn't you mention you have to kill that 6th guy...?

303
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,220
Go and kill him.

304
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,470
Get out and kill random people...

305
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,140
Move.

306
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:12,930
Get out.

307
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,180
Wait.. Wait.. Wait...

308
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,470
Hey Girl come... come...

309
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,010
You come.

310
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,680
Get out!

311
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,890
What’s with that look?

312
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,180
You have come to waste my time this morning!

313
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,470
I just finished my 29th novel and
my best friend is waiting to publish it...

314
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,220
This nonsense! What a waste of time!

315
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,300
Sir, money Sir.

316
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh..! I forgot it.

317
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,600
Hey, MANIKYAM!
MANIKYAM!

318
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,260
Sir...?

319
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,100
What’s wrong, Sir?

320
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,430
Hey... he is on his way here.
- Who are you talking about?

321
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,760
That... P... P...P... Pencil ...
pencil fellow is coming here.

322
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,260
Give me my pressure ball.

323
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,260
Take this, sir.

324
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,220
If that guy comes up,

325
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,050
I am going to make you read all his books ten times.

326
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,640
No, sir.

327
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,720
Please don’t do that to me...

328
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,760
I had accidentally read one page of his book...

329
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,260
And ... I suffered with cold shivers
and fever for an entire week

330
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,800
Keep squeezing this hard,
I'll manage him.

331
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,350
Go.

332
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,850
Sir... Sir.... Sir...
- Tell me, Manikyam.

333
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,010
Sir is not in the office.

334
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
But his car is here.

335
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,970
He parked his car here
and went on a world tour.

336
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,220
Caribbean to Kazakhstan via Pakistan.

337
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,140
Pakistan?

338
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,680
Yes, Sir..

339
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,640
What am I to do with it?

340
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,430
I finished my 29th novel today.

341
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,800
I am dying to narrate it to someone or the other.

342
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,260
You seem pretty unoccupied,
Why don’t you come with me?

343
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,390
No, sir. I have a lot of work, sir.

344
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,350
Come... come... It will only take 5 hours.

345
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,550
5 hours?

346
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,050
Can I not avoid it?
- No. You can’t.

347
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,010
Leave my hand, sir

348
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,760
Please...

349
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,890
Sir is upstairs. He is waiting for you. Go.

350
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,970
You told me he was in Pakistan.
- No, Sir.. I'll go to Pakistan

351
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,640
Hey... Ramakrishna...

352
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,600
MANIKYAM!

353
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,640
Ramakrishna...

354
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,260
Ramakrishna...

355
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,550
Sit down.

356
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,850
All the other stories are pale in comparison.
This is a league apart.

357
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,800
This one has a brilliant climax...

358
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,350
and very exciting scenes...

359
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,510
Sound effects, horror effects...

360
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,640
In fact, I was scared while writing it.

361
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,640
Then, why?

362
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,390
Why do you write it if you are scared?

363
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,930
Why should I publish it with fear?

364
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,010
Is this struggle really necessary?

365
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,140
Why don’t you stop?

366
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,050
You are asking a world-famous
creative writer to stop?

367
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,100
That’s not possible.

368
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,600
Oh my Gosh!

369
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,140
I don’t have any money on me, buddy

370
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,010
You don’t have any money?

371
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,050
What about all the profits that you made
with my 28 best selling novels?

372
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,930
Profits, eh?

373
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,100
Who bought all those good-for-nothing novels of yours?

374
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,140
You have a copy and I have a copy

375
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,890
And some half-wit...

376
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,140
And some half-wit who doesn’t have even
an iota of movie knowledge bought it!

377
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,550
Listen to me, buddy
I don’t have any money...

378
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,010
I can't be publishing this... Leave me alone, please

379
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,180
Is that so?

380
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,800
Hey, Buddy...

381
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,760
I am an orphan.

382
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,050
I am an orphan.

383
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
I am an orphan.

384
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,720
Please give me a kiss.

385
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,550
I am an orphan.

386
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,140
Give him that kiss.

387
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,720
'China Bazar'

388
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,100
[This book is dedicated to Sravani]

389
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,800
I have been helping you right from childhood...

390
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,890
and yet you dedicate every single book
to Shravani?

391
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,350
You can say anything about me but not a word against her.

392
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,050
She left me but I am confident that she would
realise it was a mistake and come back to me.

393
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,180
Like hell she would!

394
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,510
Hey, Earlier in the morning today, five women visited me.

395
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,260
They spouted nonsense about revenge...

396
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,050
But there was one girl amidst them...

397
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,680
Hot, I tell you... Hot!

398
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,180
I was enamoured.
And so, I listened to all the nonsense that they spouted.

399
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,680
Looking at them, I saw a complete life cycle...
right from birth to death.

400
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,350
Why did they come?

401
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,010
Do you remember that Punjagutta bank robbery?

402
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,140
They are apparently the families of the
people who died in that mishap.

403
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,510
And that sixth one... Killer.

404
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,680
Apparently, they want to catch
the killer and kill him.

405
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,010
And they wanted my help!
As If I am ready to help them!

406
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,100
Why do they want your help?

407
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,890
The half-wit who bought that other copy
Is not a guy... she is an old lady.

408
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,550
My fan.

409
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,140
Revenge...

410
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,600
And a famous writer helping them.

411
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Finally you accepted me as a 'famous writer'.

412
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,600
You...

413
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,390
So that writer is going to use his creative skill
and nab the murderer...

414
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,050
And how he is going to be of help
to the ladies who seek revenge...

415
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,970
That is the story.

416
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,220
That old lady is quite enthusiastic.

417
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,930
She looked like she would shoot that
murderer on sight..

418
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,760
Super, buddy!

419
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,890
Hey Buddy...

420
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,720
I saw your eyes burn with passion
when you were a child.

421
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,430
I believed that you would turn into a great writer one day.

422
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,430
And that is the reason why I gave you all those CDs

423
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,510
Not to copy... but to be inspired.

424
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,430
Is it?

425
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,100
Yes.

426
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,890
Help those five women and try to nab the criminal.

427
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,550
Jot down everything that happens
everyday as your novel.

428
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,640
Those five are going to be your characters.

429
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,300
Their journey is your story.

430
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,050
For the first time in your life,
You have an original story.

431
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,890
You are my brother-from-another-mother!

432
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,470
I will bear all the cost

433
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I will even sell my assets
and Produce this project.

434
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,050
What do you say?

435
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,720
What do you say?

436
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,260
Hey, old lady...

437
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:55,930
Just like a dry leave hanging to a tree..
How long do you think you have?

438
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,390
Everyone in your family passed away.

439
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,800
Aren't you disgusted to be the only one left?

440
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,640
You can also die, right?

441
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:14,010
What if I broke in to your house and killed you...
the police would confirm that you have died of heart-attack.

442
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,050
No one cares about a stray dog's death

443
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,140
That's why write this house on my name.

444
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,350
You can rest at the oldage home which you visit regularly,

445
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,720
Listen to me... sign on these documents

446
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,720
Please...

447
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,140
Granny... Granny...

448
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,350
You came and asked for help
but didn't give the address.

449
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,930
Had to go through a lot to find you.

450
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,100
Why are you using the stairs?
Isn't the lift working?

451
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,180
Who are you?

452
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,600
I am this building's...

453
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,970
Watchman? Being the watchman shouldn't you be
helping this old lady who is trying to climb the stairs

454
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,470
I am the owner... owner, sir.

455
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,930
Owner?
- Yes.

456
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,970
If you are the owner,
what are you doing when the lift is not working?

457
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,890
Check it!

458
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,430
Granny...

459
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Pencil.

460
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,510
Come, I'll take you up.

461
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,140
Come Granny...

462
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,220
What floor do you have to go to?
- 7th floor.

463
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,390
7th floor is it?
Couldn't you find a house on the first floor?

464
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,430
As a writer you should have physical fitness also
not only mental fitness.

465
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
Why did you come?

466
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,970
You asked for help, right?

467
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,260
You sent me away, didn't you?

468
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,220
I'll tell you the truth, Granny.

469
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,890
I couldn't sleep in the night.

470
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,760
I thought it was the mosquitoes
but later I understood that it was you.

471
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,720
Regret, Granny... I Regret sending all of you away.

472
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,050
I've written multiple revenge stories.
How can I not help for a real one?

473
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,430
I'll do it, Granny.

474
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,050
Please... accept it.

475
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,390
Shouldn't rest of the woman be on board too?

476
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,640
I'll take care of the rest.. You accept it first.

477
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,430
You say okay.

478
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,970
Okay?

479
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,390
Put them on.

480
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,390
Why do we need this?

481
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,890
Revenge needs a signature style, slowmotion,
background score, there are plenty like these...

482
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,680
You put them on.

507
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,720
What is all this Pencil?

508
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,140
RTI...

509
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,550
I got this from the 'Right to Information act'.

510
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,600
All the details regarding the police investigation are in this.

511
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,140
The details regarding the private investigation done by
senior journalist Satyanarayana Murthy, sir, are in here.

512
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,970
This has all the details regarding your five families.

513
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,890
Would you really need a file to know about us?

514
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,970
And what’s this board about?

515
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,550
All the protagonists in my books had such big boards...

516
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,850
and the details relating to the case such as Evidence,
photographs, maps, paper cuttings and such details are on this.

517
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,890
One needs to spend only two minutes on this,
you are bound to find a clue.

518
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,760
I have been thinking for two days...

519
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,260
I don’t have a clue but
I have a head ache!

520
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,260
I am unable to understand a thing.

521
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,470
What happened?

522
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,970
Where is my pen?

523
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,300
I've got a clue

524
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,300
Between what you told me and what
the police investigation revealed, There is one thing...

525
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,970
Your family members were all ordinary people.

526
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,220
There isn’t a single criminal background on any of them

527
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,390
So, the police concluded that these five
would have hired a professional robber...

528
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,180
And so, they investigated people
with robbery related criminal records.

529
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,760
But it was useless.

530
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,890
Another thing is, the escape vehicle is black colour van.

531
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,720
A black colour van means a mortuary van.

532
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,930
So, the police investigated these
kinds of vans in the entire state.

533
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,470
But it turned out to be useless.

534
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,890
And so, this case hit a dead end.

535
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,050
We already knew this...

536
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,760
but tell us what is the clue that you found.

537
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,680
Look at the photo.

538
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,970
Watches?

539
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,680
Even the police found them to be watches

540
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,970
But the eyes of 'Pencil' found the stopwatches in them.

541
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh yes, stop watches. Why?

542
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
For perfection.

543
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,640
To finish the job before the police arrives
on the crime scene.

544
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,350
Practice makes a man perfect.

545
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,930
For an ordinary person, to do an extrordinary work
he needs practice.

546
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,350
According to the records...

547
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,890
the police arrived
within 18 minutes of alarm activation.

548
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:41,140
To get 300 crores from 14th floor in 18 minutes
how much practice would they need?

549
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:48,510
So, I am sure they must have practiced at
an under construction abandoned building for a while.

550
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,260
And that building would have been a minimum of 14 floors.

551
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,640
So, we need to figure out where these buildings are
how many of them are they?

552
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,350
And all such details need to be procured.

553
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,010
Where would we get them from?

554
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,930
GHMC

555
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,850
Get Varalakhmi dressed up as an ACB officer...

556
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,510
and meanwhile I'll finish one Important task.

557
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,470
What is that?

558
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,010
Do you need any help?

559
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,300
Please.

560
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,970
Oh! We have enterd into the bathroom
while talking to him and following him.

561
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,350
Let's move...

562
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,730
Officer...

563
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,150
Move.

564
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,980
Hey! Move... Move...

565
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,150
What’s happening here?

566
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,270
What are you guys doing here?

567
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,980
Have you been giving out permissions for bribe?

568
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,400
Yesterday in Dilsukhnagar a building of 14 floors crashed!

569
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,940
You know how many people passed away in that accident?

570
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,600
You are all done.

571
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,650
How many buildings have you
authorised construction on illegally?

572
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,190
And how many other buildings with 14
floors exist in and around the city?

573
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,650
In five seconds, I want the entire list...
the entire list!

574
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,310
I meant in front of Madam.

575
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,400
Where is your officer?

576
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,440
Call your officer.
Where is the Officer?

577
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,900
Hello, excuse me...

578
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,480
Who are you people?

579
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,350
We are from Anti-Corruption Bureau, ACB

580
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,810
Senior officer and her subordinate.

581
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,310
She has a sore throat,
so I am shouting instead of her

582
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:14,980
That's what I am talking about.

583
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,850
We want the entire list of building with 14 floors.
Immediately! Right now!

584
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,900
First show me your ID card.

585
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,020
ID card, eh?

586
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,600
You said ACB, right? Show me the ID card.

587
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,730
ID card. ID card. Damn ID card!
Take it.

588
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:30,940
Aadhar card, eh?

589
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,650
Make do with that. We want the list.

590
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,060
The list of all the buildings with 14 floors.

591
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,350
Raju...
- Sir.

592
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,020
Close all the doors.
- Ok Sir.

593
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,560
Call the police.

594
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,230
Would you call the cops on us?

595
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,020
Would you call the cops on us?

596
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,650
Would you call the cops on us?

597
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,900
Hey...

598
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,730
Why are they talking about police?

599
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,690
It’s ok, officer.
I will deal with it...

600
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,440
Officer my foot!

601
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,810
Officer....
I am in no way related to this man.

602
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,480
I kept telling him..
But he dressed me up and got me here.

603
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,850
Hand him over to the police.

604
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,230
Him and his useless ideas.
- Varalakshmi!

605
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,230
This is not working...

606
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,980
So, when we go to GHMC office
we must carry a valid ID.

607
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,480
Since I am writing the book
I must be prepeared for all situations before hand.

608
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,810
Nonetheless, writing a book by copying is a cakewalk

609
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,350
But using creativity is something else altogether.

610
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,940
Pencil,

611
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,560
ACB officer, Ready.
- Is that so?

612
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,150
Tell her to come on in.

613
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,020
Careful.

614
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,150
Do one thing,
Get two AK 47s as well.

615
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,150
Alright.

616
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,520
Hello, where are you going?

617
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,940
You asked me to get you something.

618
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,230
So, you don’t even know what those are right?

619
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:13,520
Leave it.

620
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,060
What’s with that dressing?

621
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,730
It's for a building list not to wage war.

622
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,600
I am sorry... Go on and change and remove that make-up

623
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,480
Its unbearable.

624
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,400
What about this?

625
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,940
Go burn it...
I don’t want to see it again.

626
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,440
Anyways, I changed the plan.

627
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,060
Changed the plan?

628
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,900
How can you do that this easily?

629
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,940
She is not the one who is going to come with me, it's you.

630
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,850
Me?

631
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,310
What’s the plan, anyways?

632
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,850
First, we have to prepare
an Anti-Corruption Bureau department fake ID.

633
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,060
Fake ID?

634
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,940
No.. We shall prepare for civils, get the job
and then we will use the Original IDs

635
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,270
Ok.

636
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,940
Please don't open your mouth over there.
I will take care of it...

637
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,150
Excuse me, sir. Can we come off in?

638
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:14,900
Who are you?

639
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,900
We from Anti-Corruption Bureau.

640
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,310
No..no.. You please Sit down

641
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,100
Officer.

642
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,810
Please come... sit.

643
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,850
Tell me, Sir.

644
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,060
You don’t have to worry.

645
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,810
A few days ago, a 14 storey building
crashed to the ground at Dilshukhnagar.

646
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,850
You must have thoroughly checked them
before you gave them the necessary permits.

647
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,730
But that builder has escaped by submitting duplicate papers.

648
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,440
If you could provide me the details
of 14 storeyed buildings...

649
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,190
We will go to each building and cross check the list.

650
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,190
One minute.

651
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,230
My ID card.

652
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,400
ID card is not necessary, Sir.

653
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,810
You asked me in a very cool and decent manner.
I like it.

654
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,600
I meant... just as a formality if you could check.

655
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,810
There is no need for this formality.

656
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,850
It’s not an Aadhar card.
Its an original ID card.

657
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,810
No need.

658
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,480
Just take a look at it once, sir.

659
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,980
The poor thing was awake the
whole night and worked hard on it.

660
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,810
I meant...

661
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,600
Not only one night, officer.

662
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,480
How many nights... I worked hard....

663
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,310
Those sleepless nights, without food...
In a small room...

664
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,440
I studied hard and got through the exam

665
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,020
I finally achieved it.

666
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,480
Great sir, Really great, sir

667
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,560
Hey, Raju!
- Sir

668
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,150
Raju!

669
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,940
Get the 14 floors and above floors Buildings list.
- Ok Sir.

670
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,190
Files.

671
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,190
From tomorrow onwards,
we should start filtering these buildings.

672
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,560
We are looking at abandoned buildings primarily.

673
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,810
This is mainly because they wouldn't have
rehearsed at a crowded place.

674
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,900
Okay.

675
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,480
I have also created ‘Whatsapp’ group for all of us.

676
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,400
Name is 'Revengers'

677
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,940
I will post all the updates over there
and if you have any doubts, ask me about it.

678
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,440
But do not post any good mornings, good nights,
stupid jokes, tiktok videos or dub smash videos or god’s photos...

679
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,560
And don’t post chain messages
that have a clause to be forwarded.

680
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,270
If you do so... i'll get irritated.

681
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,690
Our focus should entirely be on Revenge.

682
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,190
Not on rings.

683
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,850
Ok. My dear revengers.

684
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,060
Wish each other ‘All the Best’

685
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,850
‘All the Best’

686
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,900
‘All the Best’

687
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,270
Thanks. Wish you the same.

688
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:07,600
♫ Even before I began to write the story ♫
♫ it’s a splendid twist ♫

689
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,850
♫ Even before the dream is cleared away ♫
♫ What is with this thought. ♫

690
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,230
♫ The happiness I experienced from seeing you, ♫

691
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,650
♫ Welled up the ocean from my eye lids. ♫

692
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:28,650
♫ In my hurry to touch you, ♫
♫ I left my self behind ♫

693
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:34,900
♫ No matter how hard the burden ♫
♫ My heart feels lighter ♫

694
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:55,940

695
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:02,060

696
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:16,850

697
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:24,270
♫ At every step, my heart keeps questioning me ♫
♫ But one’s ears cannot hear those questions. ♫

698
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,900
♫ It’s puzzled my brain ♫
♫ It’s something beyond comprehension ♫

699
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:37,900

00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:44,600
♫ Even if we fight endlessly ♫
♫ Even if the issue are not resolved♫

701
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,690
♫ Even if either of us start the fight
and irrirates one another, ♫

702
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,690
♫ Ours is a timeless bond that
never breaks and only deepens♫

703
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:57,400
♫ The happiness I experienced from seeing you, ♫
♫ Welled up the ocean from my eye lids. ♫

704
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:04,560
♫ In my hurry to touch you, ♫
♫ I left my self behind ♫

705
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:11,520
♫ No matter how hard the burden ♫
♫ My heart feels lighter ♫

706
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,230
Swathi...

707
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,520
Who are you messaging?

708
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,190
To my brother.

709
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,560
To your brother Karthik..?

710
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,650
I am used to sharing everything with him
since my childhood.

711
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,980
I know that my brother is not there anymore.

712
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,230
And I also know he can't reply to me.

713
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,310
But if you ask me why I am still doing this...

714
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,940
We tell everything to God
believing that he'll hear us out.

715
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,100
This is just like it.

716
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:53,350
♫ Let’s share our duties ♫
♫ And the affectionate relationship we developed thus ♫

717
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:00,060
♫ Every moment tells us ♫
♫ Not to dismiss that affection or look down upon it ♫

718
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:07,020
♫ One by one our veils fell down ♫
♫ They’ve been chopped up ♫

719
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:13,730
♫ Every muscle in my body screams and requests ♫
♫ Not to put those veils back up. ♫

720
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:20,440
♫ Even if we search for our past ♫
♫ And request it into our present ♫

721
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,810
♫ It never comes back ♫
♫ Even if we leave it behind, ♫

722
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,150
♫ The present doesn’t improve at all ♫

723
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:33,650
♫ The happiness I experienced from seeing you, ♫
♫ Welled up the ocean from my eye lids. ♫

724
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:40,480
♫ In my hurry to touch you, ♫
♫ I left my self behind♫

725
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:47,190
♫ No matter how hard the burden♫
♫ My heart feels lighter♫

726
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,150
Come fast.

727
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Why are you this slow?
There are a lot more buildings left.

728
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,650
Slow? What?
You better lift her.

729
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:13,060
She is gaining weight because of your Tamarind rice.

730
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,810
What Granny... are you tired?

731
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,560
Yeah, I have climbed so many steps

732
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,480
You are not Granny... you are a Godzilla.

733
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,100
I can't lift you from the next building onwards.

734
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,980
You spread across and search all the corners...
if you find any clue let me know.

735
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,600
Then Sherlock holmes will enter.

736
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,730
You go that side.
You take that one.

737
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,600
Pulihora madam....

738
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,980
Hey Chinnu don't go towards the edge,
we are on the 14th floor

739
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,190
After you are all done looking, come and wait at this spot.

740
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:38,650
Okay?

741
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,850
Pencil.

742
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
My brother was here.

743
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,650
How do you know that?

744
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,600
Look at this.

745
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,850
He loves solving these puzzles.

746
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,810
This is his handwriting.

747
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,350
Hey... Pencil.

748
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,150
This is my son’s.

749
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,980
I bought it for him.

750
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,810
The food outside made him sick
So, I packed his lunch for him every day.

751
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,560
Your dad?

752
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,400
That means this building...

753
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:06,400
Seeing an empty wall an inner painter emerges in people
and they start to feel like 'The Great Painter Jakkanna'

754
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,690
Hey Grandma,
Didn’t you find anything?

755
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,650
Search ...Your grandson must have
left something behind.

756
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,600
He has left Revenge for me to take.

757
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,560
Oh! Revenge.

758
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,100
What is this?

759
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,850
Dummy cash and other things used while practising.

760
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,150
They must have definitely practiced here in this building.

761
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,270
Did you see how Pencil figured it all out with his wit?

762
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,230
So, one thing is done.

763
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,190
We found the building we were searching for.

764
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,350
Mr. Pencil... What we want isn’t a building!

765
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,230
We are looking for a murderer.

766
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,810
Let’s take this one step at a time.
We just found the building...

767
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,350
Let’s not get ahead to murderer, revenge, murder...

768
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,770
Pencil...

769
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,810
Pencil... Where are you going?

770
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,300
The bank robbery happened on 7th of August 2018.

771
00:58:53,430 --> 00:59:00,510
So, footage from the ATM cctv that is dated 6 months before
the incident could give us a clue into this robbery.

772
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,600
There will be an admin that collects all
the footage from this bank’s ATM cctvs'.

773
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,970
We must get our hands on it.

774
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,350
So, go and get it.

775
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,470
It’s not that easy.

776
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,640
They are going to make us run around in circles for a year or so
by asking us to get Police Complaint letters, Permissions, etc.

777
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,180
By then, Granny might have kicked the bucket.

778
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,100
What does kicking the bucket mean?

779
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,760
It means you might get fragile.

780
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:18,890
You are right...

781
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,300
So, what should we do now?

782
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
He will not give if we will ask.

783
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,180
And in the same way,

784
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,930
The most powerful weapon in the world which can
trap even the most formidable men...

785
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,930
A woman!

786
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,300
I will go... I will.

787
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:33,890
Granny...

788
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,260
A woman....

789
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,220
I don’t think you understood the concept.

790
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,180
He needs to be seduced,
sweet talked to and charmed.

791
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,350
To extract the footage

792
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,390
I can't do it.

793
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:47,890
Now tell me

794
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,680
who is going to volunteer?

795
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,550
Absurd!

796
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,510
It’s unethical to put girl who is on
the threshold to be married, into this kind of situation

797
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,970
Let’s go through the normal channels through complaints
But do not put Priya into such situations.

798
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,550
Fine, alright!
It’s your revenge. The choice is yours.

799
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,760
What is in it for me.

800
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,300
Grandma, its best you be prepared to kick the bucket.
Come on. Let’s go.

801
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:06,220
I will go.

802
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,430
What?

803
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,760
I will go.

804
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,510
Alright, Good luck. All the best.

805
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,180
It’s the room on the right hand corner.
- It's Ok.

806
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,510
Dear, be careful.

807
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,220
Miss. Priya...

808
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,220
unbutton your top.

809
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,550
It’s an absolute necessity, Granny.

810
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,100
Honey trapping is not a joke.

811
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,640
Excuse me Sir.

812
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,050
Yes, Come in.

813
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,640
Security officer, Santoor?

814
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,350
Yes, I am Santoor. Santoor Senakkayala.
And you are...?

815
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,640
I am Priya.

816
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,350
Please have a seat.

817
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,300
Tell me, what can I do for you?

818
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,050
There is an ATM of yours on road no. 64
of Gachibowli, right?

819
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,760
64? Yes. It’s there

820
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,640
One and a half year ago, my bag
was stolen in front of that ATM.

821
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,300
Really?

822
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,800
That bag has my passport

823
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,100
If I can get a hold of that, I will go back to London.

824
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,970
It’s important.

825
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,260
I can understand the situation that you are in.

826
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,640
There is a procedure for such requests.

827
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,850
We have a protocol

828
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,930
First, go to the police station, Lodge a formal complaint

829
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,140
Come back here with a copy of that formal complaint...

830
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,510
It would be nice if you can help me without the
hassle of involving the police and complaints....

831
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,470
If you could only put your heart into it...

832
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,300
Santoor Sir.
Is the bulb lost again?

833
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,300
Yes, Murthy.

834
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,890
I have heard of bulbs being damaged or broken.
What’s with this situation of bulbs gone missing?

835
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:38,390
I remove these bulbs and keep them here
to see your stupid face every day!

836
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:39,720
Here. Take a look.

837
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,390
Him and his stupid face

838
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,180
Changing bulbs everyday is killing me.

839
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,140
Do it slowly. There is no hurry.
Take your own time.

840
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,930
What is the use of changing the bulb everyday
anyway it will be lost tommorrow.

841
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,550
Think about my matter...

842
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,680
Unable to reach the bolt... it's too high.

843
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,600
I already told you Madam...
It’s not possible.

844
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,050
What I meant is...
Is there no other way?

845
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:11,430
If there is a birthmark... then I'll manage.

846
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,720
Birthmark?

847
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,100
Fix it carefully...

848
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,510
Wait sir.. Let me do it.
Fix it slowly...

849
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,180
He hid the bulbs here.

850
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,510
So, he is into men.

851
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,260
I didn't think there would be a twist like this in our story.
What is the use of anyone going now?

852
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:45,140
Hey... Hey... no.

853
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,010
No. Are you mad?

854
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:49,800
I will not go.

855
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,600
Granny, tell them, I will not do it.

856
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,140
Hey. Are you mad?

857
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,800
What are you asking me?

858
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,300
All this doesn't happen in our households.

859
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,430
You have to go.
Even Priya went...

860
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:02,390
No. You have to go. Come on... go. You have to!
- Please listen to me.

861
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:05,180
Ok..ok..ok.. Shh.
You are our only hope.

862
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:06,850
Fine I’ll go.

863
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,760
I will go.

864
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,180
You move...

865
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,260
If something happens to me inside,
I will mention all your names and will die.

866
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,510
Hello. Mr. Pencil

867
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,640
Unbutton your shirt.

868
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,140
Excuse me, Sir...
- Yes.

869
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,350
What do you need?

870
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:36,050
A while ago, a lady came here... She is my friend.
- Girlfriend?

871
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,300
No. No...
Who will love a girl? Absurd!

872
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:42,890
Oops...

873
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,140
Why are you here?

874
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,140
The thing is...
I don’t love that girl

875
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,970
But she loves me...

876
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,220
I don’t know how to get rid of her.

877
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,510
Bloody Girls.

878
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,180
If you give me the footage ...

879
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,470
she will get her bag and
she will return to London

880
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,010
And then I will be...
- Free bird, huh?

881
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,260
Yes.

882
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,680
Oops... nice plan.

883
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,850
It’s getting late.
If you could hurry,

884
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,470
I will be on my way.

885
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,720
Hey... You have soft hands.

886
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,800
What moisturiser do you use?

887
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,890
Dove...?
Garnier?

888
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,760
- Yes. That’s right...

889
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,430
Where do you live in Hyderabad?

890
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,010
K... ka... ka...
- Kachiguda?

891
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:33,970
Yeah... right there.

892
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,890
I live there as well...

893
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:36,930
oops

894
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:43,010
So, If you give me your phone number,
I'll keep in touch.

895
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,430
Yes...

896
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,890
That was my number.

897
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,180
Oops!

898
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,100
I said I will give that number a missed call.

899
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:04,180
So, how many months of footage do you need?

900
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,760
Before 7th August, 2018...

901
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,350
I want the footage for ‘sex’ months prior.

902
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,510
Oops!

903
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,470
Impossible!
Can’t see them.

904
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,300
There is no way we can identify the people this way.

905
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,430
We can see that there are five people
But it’s difficult to say if they are your family members.

906
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,010
But according to the body language...

907
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,010
That’s Avinash

908
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,180
That’s my son.

909
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:55,760
Is he your Dad?

910
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,220
That’s my brother.

911
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:00,760
The last one?

912
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,680
Your grandson?

913
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:13,720
Everyone is carrying a single bag...
but my son was carrying 3 bags.

914
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,220
Does any of your family members here have
the habit of writing with the left hand?

915
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,890
This is the 6th person that we have been looking for.

916
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:36,050
They changed the colour of
the Ambulance and let the police astray

917
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,680
The name of the hospital that starts with an ‘S’

918
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,430
It looks familiar.
- Swasth care.

919
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,600
Swasth care... right.

920
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,220
Swasth care hospitals...

921
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,050
Afterall I am an ambulance driver,
why are you interviewing me?

922
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,220
That is our topic, sir.

923
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,890
About 'Ambulence drivers and their life'

924
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,970
How much is the salary for someone
who drives an ambulance?

925
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,180
I have been working hard for the past 10 years...
I make around 15,000 Rs/month.

926
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,100
How much money are your making?

927
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,470
Since I am a senior reporter,
I earn 3 lakhs per month.

928
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,390
3 lakhs?

929
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:15,220
If I made 3 lakhs per month
I would have my sister would have married royally.

930
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:18,300
My sister's wedding is in next month.

931
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,680
All my relatives are morons.

932
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,550
They come to the wedding for the food
but don't lend any helping hand.

933
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,510
Let’s talk about the Interview.
- Sorry sir, I am getting emotional.

934
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:32,850
Isn’t there any inspiring story with regards to
any ambulance drivers?

935
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,550
Inspiring?

936
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:41,260
I mean... someone who recently earned alot of money.
May be bought a car or purchased a house recently?

937
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
Oh yes. For sure!
One of us.

938
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:45,890
Who?

939
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,720
Switch on mobiles for recording?

940
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:50,180
Look behind...

941
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,720
Behind, Sir!

942
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,300
Behind you, sir!

943
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,680
Dev...

944
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,350
A year ago, he worked as a driver here.

945
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,180
Now, he is a millionaire.

946
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,930
While driving an Ambulance,
He has a track record of 100 % success ratio.

947
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,010
Not a single patient has lost life in his ambulance.

948
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,930
All those blessings are making it count for him.

949
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,970
Sir, do not write about me..
Write about him instead.

950
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,970
This man is the number one racer in India.

951
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,930
Fantastic... it's awesome.

952
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,300
So, let’s welcome the sportsman of the year 2018, Mr. Dev.

953
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,760
Welcome... Mr. Dev.

954
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,720
Please have a seat.

955
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,760
Not just your driving skills

956
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,300
There is a magical speed in your career as well.

957
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,720
A year ago, you were an ordinary ambulance driver.

958
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:20,510
And now, you are India’s N0.1 racer.
Youth icon and what not.

959
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,390
You have seen the journey of being
a common man to a celebrity.

960
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,680
We have held our breath to hear your inspiring story.

961
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,850
Please tell us.

962
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,850
What’s there to say?

963
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,510
It’s God’s blessing,

964
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,350
The support of my parents

965
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,350
And these fans support...

966
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,300
Oh come on...

967
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,260
But behind every success there is a lot of struggle.

968
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,600
We are seeing your success

969
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,640
Tell us about the struggles that you have been through

970
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,300
How did you get interested in racing?

971
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,350
Since when?

972
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,050
Ever since I was born.

973
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:57,760
When I was a child, my mom would always tell me
You are always in a hurry

974
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,390
That is why you were born in the seventh month.

975
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,760
This speed did not come with
practice or some rehearsal.

976
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:08,010
I am born with speed.
It’s there in my blood.

977
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,970
Speed is in my blood.

978
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,100
I am not done yet. I want more.

979
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:22,100
It’s 10:20 p.m. now.
In another 10 minutes, all the wine shops would be closed

980
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,140
It takes half-an-hour to go there.

981
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,470
What do we do?

982
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,550
I will get it.
Give me the car keys.

983
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,850
It takes 5 minutes to get the car out of parking.
How?

984
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,600
He will get that.

985
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,010
A bet of 1000 Rs.
Tell me...

986
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:38,390
Not a 1000. I will give you 2000 Rs.

987
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:04,300
Just in 9 minutes? How?
- Give me the money.

988
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:06,100
Here... take it

989
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,600
Deva, you are going to be a N0.1 racer.

990
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,720
Sachin is the God of Cricket.

991
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,600
And my man Deva...

992
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,680
You know how much a race car costs?

993
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,760
Rs.3 crores

994
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:25,850
and how much for racing club?
Rs.150 crores.

995
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,850
What should I do to get that money?

996
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,220
People like us shouldn't have such big desires.

997
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,140
That's only for the rich.

998
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:42,680
What ever you do you can't become a racer in this life time.

999
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:43,850
Leave it.

1000
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:47,680
The only dream I have is to become a racer.

1001
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,180
Don't take that one thing away from me.

1002
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:51,390
It's not that...

1003
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,930
Everyones is doing so much for their sons.

1004
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:01,350
But you did nothing for me from the day I was born.

1005
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,350
I don't have a mom either.

1006
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:09,680
Who else do I have?

1007
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:14,720
Tell me... what should I do?
I'll do anything for you.

1008
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,760
Please die.

1009
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:25,100
You lived for sixty years without any use for me...
how many more do you need?

1010
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:30,390
You got Insurance done for one lakh rupees, right?

1011
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,600
Will get a new bike.

1012
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,640
Please die... please...

1013
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:02,180
Unfortunately, my father died of a heart attack.

1014
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,260
My father was everything to me.

1015
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,180
He raised me in a way that I never missed having a mother.

1016
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,640
My father sacrificed his life for me

1017
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,430
But he never got to see my success.

1018
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:22,640
It took me a lot of time to get over his death.

1019
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,720
Deva...
Why did you spend the entire insurance money on this?

1020
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,760
You don’t have a job...
what are you going to do now?

1021
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:33,720
Listen to me,
take the post of an ambulance driver.

1022
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,970
I wanted to become a racer, not a driver.

1023
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:41,930
An ambulance driver is almost a racer Bro.

1024
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,970
No one can question you.

1025
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,970
To drive the vehicle fast is the only qualification
required for an ambulance driver.

1026
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,970
The minute I got the patient into my vehicle,
That is when my race would start.

1027
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,850
If I could successfully transport the patient alive to the hospital
That would mean that I won the race

1028
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,680
If not.. I lost the race.

1029
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,640
Guess what?

1030
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,890
I never lost a race.

1031
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,050
I've won all my bloody races.

1032
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,470
Thanks for bringing my father here on time and saving him.

1033
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,850
My father would like to see you.
Please come.

1034
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:48,640
Last night it took me 20 minutes
to reach the bank from the police station...

1035
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:53,640
after the alarm gets activated we need
20 minutes until we load the money into the van..

1036
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,680
Police will reach the spot by then...

1037
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,430
We need a person who can drive really fast
to escape from the police.

1038
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,720
I have been observing this guy from a really long time.

1039
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:02,760
Amazing driver.

1040
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,390
He is the right person for our job.

1041
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,600
The money in the Bank always has an insurance.
The account holders wouldn't be inconvenienced.

1042
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,970
Insurance money covers it all.

1043
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:17,970
If it’s ok with you, tell us.
You get an equal share as well.

1044
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,260
What’s the total amount?
- Probably 300 crores.

1045
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,050
I will drive.

1046
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:30,800
Dev...

1047
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,680
What an Inspiring story.

1048
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,300
Thank you so much for motivating all of us.

1049
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:42,010
Hey, wake up.

1050
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,390
One popcorn for me.

1051
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,180
Are we in a cinema hall?

1052
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,850
Pencil, listening to his story. What did you think?

1053
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,720
It looks like a story.

1054
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,300
He must be the one that we are searching for.

1055
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,640
He looks to be about the same height
of the man in the footage.

1056
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,140
He also has similar body language.

1057
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,550
But still I am not completely sure.

1058
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,470
I am sure though.

1059
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,430
I'll prove it.

1060
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,140
Yeah, I am coming tomorrow

1061
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,470
You must be tired after telling them these stories.

1062
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,300
I meant you must be tired after telling them your life story.

1063
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,140
Autograph? I am a big fan of you.

1064
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:27,850
Sir.

1065
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:36,470
Nothing... a fan asked me for an autograph

1066
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,600
Thank you Sir.

1067
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,760
Everything will set right by tomorrow.

1068
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,010
He is the same man.

1069
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,430
For sure.
The same man.

1070
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,680
Look at how he signed.
The same man.

1071
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,100
Be ready for war.

1072
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,100
'I'll blow the conch shell now.'

1073
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,060
Mr. Dev. India’s No. 1 racer.

1074
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,810
This is what the world knows about him.

1075
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,810
The man who murdered 5 people in a gruesome manner.

1076
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,980
We are the only ones who know this truth.

1077
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:49,190
He is not a driver, granny... he is a celebrity.

1078
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,810
It isn’t going to be easy killing him.

1079
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:56,440
And, he is not in the city.
Currently he is in Europe for an Ad shoot.

1080
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,600
He wouldn’t be back until the next Wednesday.

1081
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,440
What are we going to do until then?

1082
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,900
The six of us....

1083
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,100
By mistake...
Sorry.

1084
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,600
The six of us...

1085
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,650
How is it that there's only five of us here?

1086
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,100
Where is Chinnu?

1087
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:17,650
Chinnu?

1088
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,020
Chinnu...

1089
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,600
Chinnu..

1090
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,230
Chinnu..

1091
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,350
Trying to get away from the revenge class..
What are you doing here?

1092
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,850
Are you crying?

1093
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,440
Did someone say something?
Tell me? I will take care of it.

1094
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,980
Then what’s wrong?

1095
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,350
You little thief! What is it that you are hiding?

1096
01:18:58,980 --> 01:18:59,810
No...

1097
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,230
Happy birthday, Chinnu!

1098
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,400
12th June 2018.

1099
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,520
Last year Birthday card, huh?

1100
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:14,560
12th June... today!

1101
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:17,480
Is it your birthday today?

1102
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,520
Happy Birthday, Chinnu!

1103
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:22,650
Why didn’t you tell anyone?

1104
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:27,020
Ps: I placed the gift that you get
for every birthday in your bag.

1105
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,600
Love you
- Dad.

1106
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,850
Are you feeling sad about the birthday
gift that your father gives you?

1107
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,810
Come with me. I’ll tell you.

1108
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:40,650
Come.

1109
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,940
Priya! Swati! Chinnu is here.

1110
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,190
Hey! Where have you been?

1111
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,980
Today is Chinnu’s birthday.
What have you guys been doing without figuring this out?

1112
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,730
Oh really? Is it? Happy Birthday...
- Stop it.

1113
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,900
All the programs of today have been cancelled.

1114
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:54,100
We are going to celebrate
Chinnu’s birthday in a spectacular manner!

1115
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:54,770
Yes, Right.

1116
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,480
Swati... go there and get a cake.

1117
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,020
Priya... go there and get the decoration material

1118
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,690
Hello... If I ask you to go that way...
You would really go that way?

1119
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,770
This is a balcony.
Are you going to jump off it?

1120
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,560
I said it in a flow...
Go this way.

1121
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:07,060
Granny... go this way and make...
- make tamarind rice for everybody?

1122
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,400
I beg of you.
Don’t cook that, please.

1123
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,900
At least today, we shall have some delicious Biryani.

1124
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,480
You both get to work...
- Most certainly.

1125
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,690
Go and get some meat.

1126
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,940
You should cry only when you are born...
be happy for the rest of your birthdays.

1127
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:23,270
Your dad will be busy in heaven with a lot of work.

1128
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,100
That's why we need to get something done.

1129
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,980
Are you ready?

1130
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,770
Magic balloon.

1131
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:42,690
If you leave this in the air, it will go to heaven.
That's where your dad resides.

1132
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:47,980
As soon as your dad sees this he will
remember your birthday and he'll send the gift.

1133
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,480
Will you write what you want on the balloon.

1134
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,730
Take it.

1135
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:52,100
Leave it.

1136
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,600
Is it going?

1137
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:59,900
Is it going up?

1138
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,400
Is it going fast?

1139
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,400

1146

01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:42,690

Your phone switched off

We were really tensed.

01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:23,270
My phone died.

Psychogenic voice disorder.

1192
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:46,560
Because of the sudden demise of her father
she was shocked.

1193
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:50,520
Because she didn't have anyone to share
her feelings and emotions with...

1194
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:53,940
she got disturbed psychologically and lost her voice slowly.

1195
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,350
What should we do for her to start talking again?

1196
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,270
First she needs to vent out everything that she has bottled up...

1197
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:02,480
we need to create situations that are positive and happy.

You know we could start a restaurant with you.

"AMMA VANTA"

1206
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,900
Is it a common name?

1207
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,190

01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,100
My son used to talk in the same way...

1211
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,310
Start a restaurant, ma
you will become a great chef.

1212
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:56,600
♫ Am I on another planet earth? ♫
♫ Did I hear an interesting new tune?

1213
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:18,560
Only Sravani is missing,
it would have been nice if she was there in it.

1214
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:30,350
This weather suits the situation perfectly.

1215
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:38,270
When a bad guy gets close to his death,
this is how the weather reacts.

1216
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,310
The sky is roaring thunder.

1217
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:44,520
The Ocean is raging

1218
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,020
Snoring will be heard.

1219
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,150
Damn! Why would there be snoring?

1220
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:56,730
You irritating irresponsible revengers.
Wake up... wake up...

1221
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,060
Granny... get up now!

1222
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,060
Why? What happened?

1223
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,650
You guys ate a lot and are when it's time
for work you're sleeping..

1224
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,150
Look at her. She is still sleeping.

1225
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,980
Varalakshmi madam...
Varalakshmi madam...

1226
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:07,480
You guys want Tamarind rice.

1227
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:08,900
You don't want to eat it?

1228
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:10,850
I can't deal with you all...

1229
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,190
I can't deal with you all...

1230
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:16,310
Why do we need to lose our sleep at night,
we can follow him during the day, right?

1231
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:20,560
I told you before... after he get's back
to india we need to observe his activities 24x7

1232
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:22,850
Bad guys roam only during the nights.

1233
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,100
Haven't I mentioned it clearly in my book?

1234
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:25,310
Pencil...
- Yes.

1235
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Look at there.

1236
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,850
Hey... why did he come to this building?

1237
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,270
Do you think we are caught?

1238
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,350
I am scared for some unfathomable reason.

1239
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,270
Please stay calm.

1240
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:06,770
Dear God! Dear God!

1241
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,400
Let nothing uncertain happen to us.

1242
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,400
Please God.

1243
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,020
He didn't go to the 14th floor,
he went to 15th floor.

1244
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,980
It’s dark, right. He must be mistaken.

1245
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,560
We must be mistaken. Why would he be mistaken?

1246
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,020
I am sure he has come here many times.

1247
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:35,560
We stopped at the 14th floor...
we should have check the remaining floors too.

1248
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:36,850
What are we going to do?

1249
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,900
We'll be waiting here until he leaves...

1250
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,350
Let’s go and surround him.

1251
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:43,730
Then...?

1252
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:46,060
I am going to dig a grave and bury him here.

1253
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:46,810
Oh no! Ganny.

1254
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:48,350
Where did you find this?
- Where did you find this?

1255
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,020
This? I had it with me earlier.

1256
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,190
Oh! Is it...? It was this knife poking me since then.

1257
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:54,770
I will go ahead and kill him.
I am going to fulfil my revenge.

1258
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,650
Granny!

1259
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:01,190
If we go on and kill him without a plan or preparation,
we will all be in Jail.

1260
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:04,480
I will still look fine in a criminal outfit,
But it might be difficult for you.

1261
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,850
You might look like a Zebra.

1262
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,810
Listen to me... stow it inside.

1263
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,020
No.. Not here.

1264
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,560
I will keep this with me.
You let it be.

1265
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,650
We should wait here until he returns.

1266
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,310
Come on, hide.

1267
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:31,770
We are at 15th floor.

1268
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:32,940
Slowly...

1269
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,100
Slowly...

1270
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,100
Why do we need you here?
You should have stayed in the car.

1271
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:08,690
Granny!

1272
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,230
What is it?

1273
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,730
All of you! Gather here!

1274
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,730
See... Dev's shoe marks.

1275
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:16,940
Come.

1276
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:19,770
He went that side, come.

1277
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:34,190
The shoe marks have stopped here.

1278
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,850
What could have he done, standing here?

1279
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,270
Cigarettes.

1280
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:47,440
He smoked like this...

1281
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,810
Dev is a left hander, right!

1282
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,440
Which means it's this way...

1283
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:55,150
There is nothing here.

1284
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,020
He must have smoked standing this way.

1285
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,400
This is not an original pillar.

1286
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,850
Go and get the rod.

1287
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,480
Hold this.

1288
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,730
Pencil, what is this?

1289
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,100
Oh my Goodness!

1290
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,600
My dear Revengers...

1291
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:46,940
Get ready.

1292
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:50,520
Game starts now.

1293
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,770
Dev, it’s 9:30 already.

1294
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:08,480
So what?

1295
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,980
So, the BMW Ad that we did is launching today.

1296
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,440
We have to be there within an hour

1297
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,270
Don't tell me that you forgot about it.

1298
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,730
I am coming.

1299
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:25,270
Mask Sir... Mask.

1300
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:27,230
The famous Tollywood star Mask.

1301
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,520
Each one is better than the others.

1302
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,650
Just put it on your face and become your favourite super star.

1303
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,350
Will you buy Mask, Sir?

1304
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:37,520
We have Megastar, Super star, power star, Rebel star,
What ever you want just name it.

1305
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:39,100
No? You don’t want anything?

1306
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,690
Take this... It’s complimentary from my end.

1307
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,020
Today's bussiness went down the drain.

1308
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:46,520
Take the Mask.

1309
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:05,060
300 crores were robbed in the Punjagutta bank.

1310
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,350
The robbery happened in the same bank... Just as yours.

1311
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,810
Look at the date.

1312
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,150
August 7th, 2018

1313
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:14,980
Shit!

1314
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:18,940
This is old news paper...
means that bank robbery which you did.

1315
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,230
Hey, move your vehicle.

1316
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,900
Rasool!

1317
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,060
Did you find him?
- No.

1318
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,700
Welcome sir.

1319
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:57,400
This way.

1320
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,950
Please move.

1321
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:00,780
Please move.

1322
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,280
Side.. Please move.

1323
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,700
Side.. Please move.

1324
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:06,030
Excuse me...
Side.. Please...

1325
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,320
Come let's go...

1326
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,990
Revengers... get ready.

1327
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,950
Revengers...? Revengers...?

1328
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,030
Sir please.

1329
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,780
Check once if all the channels are working.

1330
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:43,490
Who are you?

1331
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:44,900
Why did you come here?

1332
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,200
No. No.. Don’t cry.

1333
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,740
Where are your parents?

1334
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,110
One second... One second...

1335
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:52,570
Hello, security!
Security!

1336
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,700
These guys never respond.

1337
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:58,860
I am here I'll handle it..
Where did your parents go?

1338
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:00,900
Oh, that way?

1339
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:03,900
Come... I’ll take you.
I’ll take you.

1340
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:05,320
Very cute girl.

1341
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:06,780
Move.... move....

1342
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:14,360
We don't have much time.
Get done with this before he is back.

1343
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:16,070
Fast... fast...

1344
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:22,950
It's done.

1345
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:23,780
Let's go.

1346
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,450
Hello! Who are you guys?

1347
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:27,740
Why did you get in here?

1348
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,450
What are you doing here?

1349
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:30,900
Come on... tell me.

1350
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,650
Hello, security!

1351
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:35,450
Come here quick...
two unknown people came to the AV room..

1352
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,360
So you are the parents?

1353
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:38,740
Yes. We are Mummy and daddy.

1354
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,030
Mummy?

1355
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,110
Daddy.

1356
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:45,030
How can you leave this little child here?
Shouldn’t you keep an eye on her?

1357
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:47,280
What’s this, Chinnu?
You had us worried.

1358
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,570
By god’s grace, we found you.
We are together now.

1359
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,030
You were born after so many stunts
and sleepless nights.

1360
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,030
What do you say, Priya?

1361
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:56,450
Yes.

1362
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,900
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1363
01:36:59,110 --> 01:36:59,650
Take care her.

1364
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,860
Thank you.
- Ok... ok.

1365
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,110
Ah, problem’s solved.

1366
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,740
What does 'stunts' mean?
You are going overboard!

1367
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,650
Who? Me?

1368
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,030
He only said mom and dad in Telugu.

1369
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:09,900
You insisted on it in English.

1370
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,490
Just got carried away.

1371
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:12,490
Not carried away.
You felt it.

1372
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:14,570
These are the feelings about me that are buried within you.

1373
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,400
Will you stop it?
- Why would I stop?

1374
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:16,280
I am handsome.

1375
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,360
I don’t spray myself with perfume,
I don’t go to the gym either.

1376
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,110
It’s all natural.

1377
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,610
Does that mean you would fall in love with me?

1378
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:22,900
Don’t try to seduce me and limit my potential.

1379
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:26,110
Stop! Stop this relationship dramas.

1380
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,490
Concentrate on revenge.

1381
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,450
From now on, “No love”, revenger.

1382
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:32,200
Only revenge... Revenge... Rev...

1383
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,570
Sir... we are extreamly sorry sir.
It’s a small technical problem, sir.

1384
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,820
We should be ready in two minutes.

1385
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,400
Not feeling well... I am leaving.
Talk to Rasool.

1386
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:40,360
You don't worry... I'll take care.

1387
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:41,650
I'll just be back
- Ok sir.

1388
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,820
You too wear it.

1389
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,860
We didn’t get it.

1390
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,110
We left it at home.

1391
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:13,240
Someone is trying tell me that they found our building.

1392
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:16,360
Money...?

1393
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,530
Pencil, He is looking at us!

1394
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:15,360
Maybe he is.
But he should figure out who we are.

1395
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:18,400
Ready revengers!
- Ready.

1396
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:29,990
He will die of tension wondering who these people are...

1397
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:31,950
he doesn't have a Binocular, right?

1398
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,070
Granny! I think he is scared.
Look at how he is running!

1399
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:49,740
Yeah, looks like that but...
it doesn’t look like he is scared.

1400
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:53,450
We are on the fourteenth floor
and Granny is also with us.

1401
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,200
He is coming towards us.

1402
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,740
Go! Get away from here!
You need to leave from here urgently!

1403
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,900
Chinnu come... don't leave my hand.

1404
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,700
Where is Granny? I can't see her behind us.

1405
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,650
Granny! Why would you keep going
in the opposite direction?

1406
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:12,240
Come.. Come..run.. Run...

1407
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,450
Why are you this slow?
Are you waiting for him to catch you?

1408
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:19,240
Let’s go... run...
Faster! Hurry!

1409
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:25,280
Come fast..! Fast.
- Get inside.

1410
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,990
Come fast!

1411
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:38,700
What happened?
- May be an overload.

1412
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,650
Where are you going?

1413
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:41,900
Keep your hands inside.

1414
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:44,240
Don’t get down anywhere in between, please.
Keep going down. I’ll be right with you.

1415
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:49,740
Oh God! I am scared.

1416
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:56,200
Pencil.

1417
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,280
Oh no! There is a power cut.
The lift has stopped!

1418
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:32,280
Granny...

1419
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,320
Hey chinnu!
- Chinnu... What happened?

1420
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,150
Chinnu... What happened?

1421
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,240
Oh no! What happened?

1422
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:58,200
(Indistinct Voices)

1423
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,780
Dev...? You are the racer, right!
Oh, my God!

1424
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:17,650
Chinnu... chinnu...
be careful.

1425
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,700
Slowly.
- Lift.. Lift... Lift...

1426
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:22,030
Sir... please just one selfie.

1427
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,150
Careful Priya.

1428
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:30,530
Sir.

1429
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,450
What actually happened?

1430
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:49,700
We got stuck in the lift.

1431
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:50,320
Oh...!

1432
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,110
She has a breathing difficulty due to suffocation.

1433
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:54,570
She was just scared.

1434
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:55,900
She is alright now.

1435
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:58,070
Make sure you don’t repeat these circumstances.

1436
01:44:58,570 --> 01:44:59,110
See you.

1437
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,450
Chinnu...

1438
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:06,570
Baby... look at your granny, once.

1439
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:08,570
I behaved foolishly.

1440
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,490
I was stupid and thoughtless to take such a risk.

1441
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:13,110
I am sorry, Granny.

1442
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:15,400
It's not your mistake.

1443
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,900
I am the one who started it...

1444
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,490
I would be the one responsible
if anything happens to your lives.

1445
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:21,650
Let’s end this here.

1446
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:22,780
No.

1447
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:24,610
Let’s end this here.

1448
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:25,950
I don’t want this revenge.

1449
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:27,700
Let's stop it.

1450
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,820
What is this, granny?

1451
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,240
We got this far because of you.

1452
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:33,030
And if you were to give up on this revenge now,
Everything would go down the drain.

1453
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:34,990
Granny is right!

1454
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:37,820
By god’s grace, the child had a miraculous escape.

1455
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:42,110
This revenge...
Enough. Let’s give up.

1456
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,400
It all started with their robbery, didn't it?

1457
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:52,950
If they were really considerate about
the consequences of their actions on us,

1458
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:55,740
they wouldn’t have resorted to such an act.

1459
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,450
Who did they do this for?

1460
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,990
Don't know.

1461
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:03,820
I know.

1462
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,200
I know why they had to steep down to a robbery.

1463
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,610
All of the people involved in the robbery
have no connection with each other

1464
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,150
Live in different localities of the city

1465
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:17,400
And have no criminal background as well.

1466
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:19,280
Why did they meet each other?
Under what circumstances?

1467
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:21,320
What was the necessity that prompted them
to commit this robbery.

1468
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,610
How did they meet Dev?

1469
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:26,320
I had these kind of doubts from the beginning.

1470
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,820
In Swasth care Hospital...

1471
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:31,490
this is the prescription given to your son.

1472
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:34,030
I found that in the abandoned building.

1473
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:38,860
I took the prescription and went to the
same hospital to make an enquiry.

1474
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:40,740
And that is when I figured it out.

1475
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:48,740
Before they were killed, each of them discovered
they were suffering from different type of Cancer.

1476
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,860
Can... Cancer?

1477
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:54,320
All of them met at the same hospital for the first time.

1478
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:57,320
They figured that they didn’t have long to live

1479
01:46:58,570 --> 01:47:00,400
And they were worried for you women.

1480
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:05,700
Started to focus their attention not on their health..
But on your problems.

1481
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:10,280
They worried that if they died,
Granny shouldn't face any difficulties.

1482
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,200
"Mom shouldn't be in trouble either."

1483
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,450
"My sister should study well..."

1484
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:16,570
"She should stay happy"

1485
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:22,490
"My daughter and my fiance shouldn’t
suffer because of poverty."

1486
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:25,650
It was solely about securing your futures financially.

1487
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,610
They planned the robbery.

1488
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,700
And they met Dev at the same hospital.

1489
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:33,280
So, you knew this all along?

1490
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:34,700
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

1491
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,200
They did this because...
They didn’t want you to know.

1492
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,530
I just respected their decision.

1493
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,240
But why are you telling us this now?

1494
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,740
Granny and mom don’t want to seek revenge anymore.

1495
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:58,070
But without the motive of revenge,
You wouldn’t have any business with me

1496
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:00,400
I would be left alone and lonely.

1497
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,200
I would be left alone as an orphan again.
- Stop it!

1498
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:07,530
What’s with this nonsense?

1499
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:09,950
Where would we go leaving you here?

1500
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,990
We ourselves don’t have anyone.
No one!

1501
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:18,740
Even if you scold us or throw us out... we won't go.

1502
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,740
Just missed them.

1503
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,610
That five women along with a guy.

1504
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,650
Exactly when I thought I got them...
he set off the fire alarm

1505
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:15,990
All the money is with them for sure.

1506
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,360
Clear my schedule.

1507
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,820
We need to figure this out.

1508
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:23,030
How will you find who they are?

1509
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:24,490
How are you going to find out who they are?

1510
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,900
Regarding them, we don’t have a single clue.

1511
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:32,320
Rasool.

1512
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:34,280
What?

1513
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:36,900
Footage!

1514
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:19,610
He is the guy, Sir.

1515
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:25,200
Are you sure that he is the guy
who took the ATM footage.

1516
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:27,030
Yes, Sir.

1517
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,240
Take the screen shot from video.

1518
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,650
Search for him on Google.

1519
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:38,570
Okay, Sir.

1520
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:07,240
(Mahishasura Mardini Stotram)

1521
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,780
Who is that banging the door?

1522
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:30,530
You have cleverly devised a plan and
skill fully unmasked me.

1523
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:34,490
Do you think I wouldn’t be smart enough as well
to figure out about you guys?

1524
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:35,530
Where is he?

1525
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,200
Where are the rest of them?

1526
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:41,360
Hey Old woman!

1527
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:46,610
Like cigarette smoke... Revenge is also injurious to health.

1528
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:30,360
What a beauty... unnecessarily it's getting wasted.

1529
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:47,320
He is a highly intelligent person.

1530
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:49,450
He can quite easily figure out about us.

1531
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:52,990
We have to delete the cc tv footage immediately.

1532
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:54,610
It might happen the way I wrote.

1533
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,280
Yes. It’s bound to happen the way you wrote it.

1534
01:52:57,490 --> 01:52:58,530
Oh dear!

1535
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,070
How kind of you!

1536
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,740
He just stopped short of
shooting Priya. Isn’t it?

1537
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,110
Why wouldn’t he?
At his age....

1538
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:10,950
The girl is quite beautiful...
Yes... He would hesitate to shoot.

1539
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,950
That must be the cooker.
I need to go.

1540
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:17,400
Go.

1541
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:21,450
How inconsiderate, granny!
Recollect how much I helped you guys

1542
01:53:21,610 --> 01:53:23,150
And yet, you guys push me into a muddle.

1543
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,570
We are helping you.
You don't understand.

1544
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:30,400
We understand your anxious behaviour...
And so does she...

1545
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:32,950
And that is why she left for the Pressure cooker.

1546
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,650
That cc tv footage?

1547
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:43,650
We have to delete it immediately.

1548
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:44,240
Oops.

1549
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,900
Santoor is upset.

1550
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,530
Can’t you see that I am sulking?

1551
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:50,950
What happened, Santoor?

1552
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:53,530
Don’t you know how many calls and messages I sent you?

1553
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:55,030
Did you respond to even one of it?

1554
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,860
It hurts.

1555
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:59,860
I am not in a position to reply.

1556
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,700
What happened?

1557
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:03,740
There is someone who has been stalking me for a month.

1558
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:04,700
Oops.

1559
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:09,650
Everywhere I go, he follows me.
And, he asks me to commit to him.

1560
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:11,950
Commitment? Did you commit to him?
Don’t tell me please.

1561
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,150
How would I do that santoor?

1562
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:17,240
If I am committed to a person, there is no turning back.

1563
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:20,820
He suspects us.

1564
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,570
He might come here to check on us.

1565
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:25,820
He would ask for the footage of the
CCTV from my previous visit.

1566
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,360
Will you give it to him, Santoor?

1567
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,150
I already deleted that footage.

1568
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:33,150
Oops.

1569
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,820
I have to save my identity, right?

1570
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:39,990
Last time you came to see me, you held my hands.
We have been physical.

1571
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:42,070
That is why, I deleted the entire footage.

1572
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:45,240
I didn't make any mistake, right Pencil?

1573
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:50,200
What about the current footage?

1574
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:51,280
Of course!

1575
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:54,990
With regards the footage, you don’t exist.

1576
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:58,450
But you exist in my heart, ok?
I am not going to delete that.

1577
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:02,740
By the way, this is our second date.
We are going steady.

1578
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,400
Hey, Pencil.
We are going steady.

1579
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:08,700
We have to celebrate!

1580
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,900
Hello...

1581
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:29,360
Hello...

1582
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,400
Yes, I am the officer.

1583
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:35,200
I am the Chief Security officer.

1584
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:46,780
You have an ATM at Gachibowli, Road no. 64. Yes?

1585
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:49,280
Yes, we do.

1586
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:53,860
Did someone come by asking for
the footage of that CCTV?

1587
01:55:54,280 --> 01:56:00,030
I want the footage of the cc tv camera that recorded them,
when they came to your office.

1588
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,570
It’s not possible.

1589
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:06,820
How is it not possible?

1590
01:56:07,610 --> 01:56:11,860
They came and asked for the footage and
took the footage of the ATM as well as their visit.

1591
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,900
They are a dangerous gang, sir.

1592
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:16,280
You are much better than them.
You just held my collar.

1593
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,400
They beat me up.

1594
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:22,200
Apart from them, the one guy who came along with them
Is even more dangerous.

1595
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:23,740
What does he look like?

1596
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:26,700
He must be 6 feet, sir.

1597
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,740
Or probably 2 inches shorter than 6 feet.

1598
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:31,030
He must have 6 pack abs

1599
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:33,070
Or probably missing 2 amongst them.

1600
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,450
He looks mighty... like a 'Hulk.'

1601
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,200
But like a less angry version of 'Hulk'

1602
01:56:38,570 --> 01:56:42,320
He is intelligent, smart,
Stylish and he’s got swag.

1603
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:43,780
Did he give you a name?

1604
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,530
Dev.

1605
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:50,400
He said about Dev.
But he never said his name.

1606
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:54,700
He wants to catch the guy named Dev
and they wanted to kill him.

1607
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,030
It’s a really big criminal gang.

1608
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,490
If they catch Dev,
They are bound to kill him.

1609
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,070
How will they kill me?

1610
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:04,360
Not you, sir... someone called Dev.

1611
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:09,200
Sir... are you Dev?

1612
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:15,450
Hello...

1613
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:17,320
Dev, I found out where they stay

1614
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,610
Will Whatsapp you the location...
come immediately.

1615
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,320
I am coming.

1616
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:24,820
Go on, sir.

1617
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:26,820
Sir... Sir... Sir...

1618
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:30,030
¶¶Hey Pencil boy...¶¶

1619
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:32,110
¶¶You pricked me near my heart...¶¶

1620
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,990
¶¶ My he-man...¶¶

1621
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,360
Hey, Pencil.

1622
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:37,820
Oops!

1623
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:41,450
What work do you have here, sir?

1624
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:51,900
When did you see them?

1625
01:57:52,030 --> 01:57:54,150
The day before we lost the money
and in front of our house,

1626
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,900
The five ladies of the same age..that you mentioned.
And one guy.

1627
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,780
They waited in a blue ambassador outside our house.

1628
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:02,700
I thought they were your fans...
So, I didn't take it seriously

1629
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:09,030
I brought the car with which you hit the transformer...
to the nearby service station,

1630
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,280
I saw the blue ambassador here.

1631
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:13,530
They told me that they stay in this building on the first floor.

1632
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:20,030
How can you say that they both are same?
- We saw them from afar

1633
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:25,570
Hey, Get down.

1634
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:34,530
(Mahishasura Mardini Stotram)

1635
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,860
Who?

1636
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,280
Are you dumb?

1637
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,200
Are you dumb is what I am aking you!

1638
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:48,150
How many times do I have to call you?
There is something wrong with the TV.

1639
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,490
When I called you up to ask you to fix it,
Won’t you sort the problem out immediately?

1640
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:51,400
What sir?

1641
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:55,700
You said you saw the six people, right?
Is she the old lady from the gang?

1642
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:58,610
No.. No.. It can't be.

1643
01:59:58,650 --> 01:59:59,820
There is nothing similar.

1644
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:00,900
Are you sure?

1645
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:04,450
That one was really sharp,
but look at her.

1646
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:06,950
What’s with these hushed whispers?

1647
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:10,200
You at the back,
I am talking to you.

1648
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,490
Look at him! He looks like a kidnapper of children.

1649
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:14,610
If you knock on my door again, I will kick you.

1650
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:16,150
Get out from here.
Go.. Go... go...

1651
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,700
I have a lot of work and
I want to watch the tv.

1652
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,320
Go on. Go on.

1653
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:25,990
Let's leave sir... I have a meeting at the bank
There is a lot more work to be done.

1654
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:33,610
If they come to your bank again or if you see them anywhere,
Inform me immediately

1655
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,530
I swear on you... i'll inform you.

1656
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:47,900
Dev... someone named Subramanyam
who worked with you at the hospital

1657
02:00:47,950 --> 02:00:48,700
Turn him away.

1658
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,860
D... D...Dev!

1659
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:53,200
Hey, Subbu!

1660
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,650
Come on in. Come...
It’s been really long.

1661
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:57,610
How have you been?
- I am good.

1662
02:00:57,860 --> 02:01:00,490
How are you, Dev?
- I am good, too.

1663
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:03,030
How is everyone back there?
- They are all good.

1664
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:06,530
You know my sister, P.. Padma, right?
She is getting married.

1665
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,860
It’s on the 23rd of this month.
Please attend it.

1666
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:11,950
Ok. Ill check my schedule.
- Please check...

1667
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:13,950
If possible,
I will definitely be there.

1668
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:16,780
Just two minutes, Dev.
You just have to make an appearance.

1669
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:18,780
I am always proud of your success.

1670
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:21,490
Someone who has worked with me
and was able to achieve this kind of success.

1671
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:26,820
Just the other day, A reporter from Eenadu...
He was persistently asking me about you and I sung your praises.

1672
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:29,990
Who?

1673
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:34,700
A journalist who was writing an article
in Eenadu regarding the drivers of ambulance.

1674
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:39,650
What did he ask you?

1675
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:47,280
He asked if anyone of us suddenly came
into money and built a house? Bought a car?

1676
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,610
I showed him your hoarding and told him about you.

1677
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:53,070
And that’s it... from then on,
The entire interview was about you.

1678
02:01:53,110 --> 02:01:55,400
'Eenadu' did not publish any articles regarding this topic.

1679
02:01:57,070 --> 02:02:01,030
He is fairly new to the job.

1680
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:04,610
Earlier, he wrote books.

1681
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:07,610
He has a weird name

1682
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:11,360
P... P...Pencil Parthasarathy

1683
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:26,820
It’s a really big criminal gang.

1684
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:30,570
If they catch Dev,
They are bound to kill him.

1685
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,150
He...?

1686
02:02:34,450 --> 02:02:35,240
Is that him?

1687
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:37,150
Yes. It is.

1688
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,200
All of us are ready to watch your dance performance.

1689
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,490
What about you, all set?

1690
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:52,650
All the best.

1691
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:56,320
Where is Priya?

1692
02:03:13,570 --> 02:03:14,610
How is it?

1693
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:27,820
Okay?

1694
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:31,400
I don’t know how to put it in words even though I am a writer.

1695
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,950
Actually, women shouldn’t be this beautiful.

1696
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:35,860
It’s a crime

1697
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,990
Come closer.
- What?

1698
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,610
Come closer.

1699
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:56,240
Granny doesn’t want to come to the function
you go and talk to her.

1700
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,740
She listens to you...

1701
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:00,320
Did you ask me to come closer just to tell me that?

1702
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:03,490
I am not deaf... I could have heard that from a distance.

1703
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:04,740
Not fair.

1704
02:04:06,030 --> 02:04:06,900
Granny...

1705
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:08,780
Granny...

1706
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:14,150
Granny, you told them that you don’t want to go.
No... Not a chance. Get up and get ready.

1707
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:18,110
I have been feeling weak since last night.

1708
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:19,280
Really?

1709
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,780
I really have no patience.
I can’t go with you.

1710
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:26,490
Hello! Our program is cancelled.
We are all going to the hospital.

1711
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:28,820
I will call the orphanage and let them know.
- No. No. No.

1712
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:32,400
Her teacher said repeatedly that
our Chinnu is the lead performer.

1713
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:34,650
Nothing will happen to me mean while.

1714
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:36,240
All of you go.

1715
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:37,240
Ok.

1716
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,320
We will be back in 2 hours.

1717
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:40,400
We will go the hospital once we are back.
Just take your medication and rest.

1718
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,490
Ok.

1719
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:43,030
Chinnu...

1720
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,950
Come on, Chinnu!

1721
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,860
Chinnu! Super!

1722
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:30,610
Chinnu! Super!

1723
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,450
Hi, Sir... Do you remember me?

1724
02:05:35,450 --> 02:05:37,240
AV room, AD launch.

1725
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:41,490
What are you doing here?

1726
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:43,530
Earlier in the dance program,

1727
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:47,570
The one that looked dull, dark
and greasy and danced the worst,

1728
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:48,900
that’s my son, sir.

1729
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:50,030
Oh... Is it?

1730
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:51,900
He looks like you.
- Thank you, sir.

1731
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:55,490
But your daughter performed very well.
- Thank You, sir.

1732
02:05:55,610 --> 02:05:58,490
Sir? Did you plan for more kids
Or are you satisfied with just one?

1733
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:01,700
I am ready... but she isn’t cooperating.

1734
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:03,150
Why don’t you convince her?

1735
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:06,030
Why Madam? Why do you want to take time?

1736
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:07,740
Two is company,
Three is a crowd, madam.

1737
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,860
Why don’t you sit here and convince her?

1738
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,610
You please go... I'll convince her.

1739
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:13,610
Don’t think about anything else, Madam.

1740
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:15,360
Don't think about family planning...

1741
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,400
You should have children when the age is right

1742
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:18,240
Hello, who is this?

1743
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:23,900
You stole 150 crores from me and made a fool out of me.

1744
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:26,070
And you are asking me "Who is this"?

1745
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,990
Writer Pencil Parthasarathy.

1746
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:31,450
Dev..

1747
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:35,900
Ok, I don’t have a lot of time...
I am going to come to the point.

1748
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:41,490
In the eyes of the world, I am a big racer.

1749
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:44,780
Youth Icon... Sportsman of the year.

1750
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:46,280
They have called me many such things

1751
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:52,240
But my life from the inside...
Do you know what the truth is?

1752
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:57,530
From the moment, I wake up...
Up until the time I fall asleep

1753
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,200
I am constantly in fear

1754
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:05,900
I fear that the truth that I robbed the bank will come out
and I would be caught by the police.

1755
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:12,320
I am anxious every minute of the day

1756
02:07:14,110 --> 02:07:18,150
Suddenly at the point in time... You came.

1757
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:22,610
You showed me how I can get away from this fear.

1758
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:28,900
The connection between me and that crime is...

1759
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:30,860
That Money.

1760
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,490
That money... Is with you.

1761
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:40,700
The police have been searching for that 6th person

1762
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:45,570
Now I'll help them get to the 6th person.

1763
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,320
They have started towards your house

1764
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:50,240
For you.

1765
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:53,320
For the money that you stashed in your home.

1766
02:07:56,650 --> 02:08:00,110
Pencil, come.. Let's watch the programme.

1767
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:03,030
What happened?
- Nothing, I'll just be back. You stay here.

1768
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:22,360
OTP...

1769
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:28,360
Your transaction failed.

1770
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,530
What’s the matter?

1771
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:34,700
Listen to me.

1772
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:36,320
Hire a big truck immediately and take it to my house.

1773
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,030
Truck? Did the house owner throw you out?

1774
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:39,820
I told you numerous times to pay the rent.

1775
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:41,490
Shut your mouth and listen to me

1776
02:08:41,570 --> 02:08:44,200
Take the books in my shelf and shift them elsewhere

1777
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,280
Why would you need to shift those
thermocol sheets of books?

1778
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:48,820
They are not just thermocol sheets... Its money.

1779
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:50,240
Money?
How much?

1780
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,820
150 crores.

1781
02:08:54,450 --> 02:08:55,610
150 crores?

1782
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,950
From where did you get the money?

1783
02:08:57,950 --> 02:09:00,450
We shall talk about it later.
I will explain everything clearly to you.

1784
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:01,950
Just follow my instructions
Immediately.

1785
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:06,070
Manikyam!

1786
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,400
Murthy, check why the vehicle has stalled.
- Move your vehicle aside, man!

1787
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:57,070
Are you writer Pencil Parthasarathy?

1788
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:57,950
Yes, Sir.

1789
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,860
Go and check.
- Ok sir.

1790
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:01,240
Don’t leave out any room.
- Ok sir.

1791
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:01,650
Quick.

1792
02:10:03,650 --> 02:10:05,570
What's happening, sir?

1793
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:06,740
Bank robbery.

1794
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,360
300 crores

1795
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:11,820
For the past year, you tortured us.

1796
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:18,990
If even a single note matching the serial number is found,
I’ll lock you up for the rest of your life.

1797
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:22,150
We looked everywhere sir... but we didn't find anything.

1798
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:23,240
How will you find them, sir?

1799
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:25,030
I am neither a thief nor a Benami...
I am a writer.

1800
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:26,150
A really poor one.

1801
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,030
Look at those shelves inside

1802
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:29,820
I wanted to fill them up with books..
But unfortunately, I don’t have any money.

1803
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:31,530
I remembered while we are talking.

1804
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:33,650
I thought about writing on novel about this case...
it seemed interesting.

1805
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:37,700
I researched on that case, someone would have suspected me
and they would have informed you

1806
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,070
Now, I have to clean my house.

1807
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,320
Let's go.

1808
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:44,780
Where did we get the call?
- It's an ananomous call.

1809
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:46,110
Inform to cyber cell immediately.

1810
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:49,530
Now a days every loafer is playing with
the police like this.

1811
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:52,030
You bring them to the station and teach them a lesson.

1812
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:10,200
Hey, Bro...

1813
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,650
Thanks, buddy!

1814
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:17,610
No need for this sarcasm.
We had a flat tyre.

1815
02:11:17,610 --> 02:11:18,650
And that is why we are late.

1816
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:20,360
Where are the 150 crores?

1817
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:22,950
I have never seen that kind of money in my life.

1818
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,320
What do you mean?

1819
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:28,280
That’s one good for nothing truck

1820
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,070
Stop with these jokes... tell me the truth.

1821
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,400
That money is not mine.

1822
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:37,650
Why are you acting funny?
How would I know? I just came.

1823
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:44,360
Granny!

1824
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,490
Granny... is at home.

1825
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:49,110
What happened?

1826
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:50,400
She is not well too.

1827
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:53,740
Granny.

1828
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:56,110
Granny.

1829
02:11:59,650 --> 02:12:00,700
Granny.

1830
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,280
Granny.

1831
02:12:16,150 --> 02:12:17,320
Even Granny's luggage is not here

1832
02:12:18,450 --> 02:12:20,150
Ask around if anyone has seen her?

1833
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:56,150
Apparently some old folks went in a van.

1834
02:12:56,490 --> 02:12:58,950
I asked about Granny ...
and they said that they do not know.

1835
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,400
What’s that?

1836
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:06,280
One of those five men is a Christian.

1837
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:10,820
Varalakshmi, Priya, Swati, Chinnu...

1838
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,900
Chinnu's name is Srinidhi.

1839
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:13,360
Granny's name is Saraswathi.

1840
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:17,530
No one is christian among them.

1841
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:19,900
Everyone’s a Hindu.

1842
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:27,400
Where are you going?

1843
02:13:30,490 --> 02:13:31,240
Hold this.

1844
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:38,320
John Stewart

1845
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,110
John!

1846
02:13:40,150 --> 02:13:40,900
What happened?

1847
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:41,990
Orphan..!

1848
02:13:43,610 --> 02:13:46,280
This has all the details regarding your five families.

1849
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:50,200
Would you really need a file to know about us?

1850
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:51,780
Rajaram has a mother

1851
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:54,110
Brahmam has a daughter

1852
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:55,490
Karthik has a sister

1853
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:56,780
Avinash has Priya.

1854
02:13:57,570 --> 02:13:58,700
But john doesn’t have anyone.

1855
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,610
He is an orphan... like me.

1856
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:04,990
He was brought up in Orphanage home.

1857
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:09,570
John isn’t Granny’s grandson!

1858
02:14:10,820 --> 02:14:12,990
Then has Granny been lying to us?

1859
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:14,150
I don’t understand.

1860
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:17,780
She is the one who sent the letters to the rest of others.

1861
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:19,700
She is the one who told the rest of them about me.

1862
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,780
She is the one who started and planned this whole revenge.

1863
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:28,860
Though she is in no way related to John,
Why did she go through all this trouble?

1864
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,490
Who is Granny?

1865
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:47,820
She took it all.

1866
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:51,650
But she forgot something important.

1867
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:06,820
Madam... Just as you asked,
We have distributed the money equally in these five bags.

1868
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:08,570
What do you want us to do with them?

1869
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:11,900
Place the five bags separately over there.

1870
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,240
Regarding what to do with them,
I’ll tell you later.

1871
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,570
Okay.

1872
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:17,820
Partha...!

1873
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:24,950
I knew that you would find me.

1874
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:27,530
But how did you do it in such a less span of time.

1875
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,490
It's easy Granny...

1876
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:35,530
I saw you many times put money in
the donation box of this old age home.

1877
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:40,240
A while ago your people's van had blocked my way.

1878
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:45,740
Leave all that...
and first, give me a hug!

1879
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:47,780
Partha...!

1880
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:51,700
What great timing you have!

1881
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:54,320
Just before the police came over,
You stuffed the bags with money and shifted them.

1882
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:55,240
Super, Granny!

1883
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,950
If the police found this money,
we would be behind bars.

1884
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:03,780
But, there is something that I don’t understand.

1885
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:12,570
Why did hide the truth?

1886
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:29,200
Your grandson was not there in those
five people who were killed.

1887
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:32,820
He didn’t kill just 5 people.

1888
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,490
He killed 6.

1889
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:37,490
Along with your husband

1890
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,740
We were married for 60 years.

1891
02:16:55,030 --> 02:17:02,240
Even when he was 80 years old,
He ran a bookstore on his own

1892
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:06,070
My husband was brutally murdered by that demon.

1893
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,200
That’s when I decided that
the man should pay for his sins.

1894
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:14,570
I went to the police station every day
to enquire about this case.

1895
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:18,150
Do you know what they said?

1896
02:17:18,570 --> 02:17:21,780
"Granny!
Your husband was 80 years old."

1897
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:25,650
"He is lucky to have survived this long.
Leave the matter alone."

1898
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,650
"You are going to be on the way to deathbed soon anyways."

1899
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:32,150
"Is this really necessary?"
That is how they criticised me and shooed me away.

1900
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:38,030
Everyone takes old people for granted.

1901
02:17:38,990 --> 02:17:41,150
The children think that they are a burden

1902
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,780
The society thinks that we are a burden on this earth.

1903
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:50,700
Our death is similar to a street dog's death.

1904
02:17:51,450 --> 02:17:55,320
No one cares about how we died or why we died.

1905
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:01,990
You asked me about why I hid the truth from you?

1906
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:06,820
If I told you that the one who died
was my husband instead of my grandson,

1907
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:11,280
Would anyone understand my need to avenge him?

1908
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:13,360
Would anyone join me?

1909
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:14,900
No.

1910
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:19,700
That is why I lied In order to convince them.
I got them to you.

1911
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:24,700
As soon as we had our revenge
I thought of telling you guys the truth

1912
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:29,320
But in the meanwhile,
I had fallen in love with all of you guys.

1913
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:36,360
For someone who never raised any children of her
own to live amongst so many children

1914
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:40,610
Was something that made me realise
how close I became to you guys.

1915
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:50,240
But that day, when Chinnu got stuck in the lift,
I couldn’t handle the situation.

1916
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:54,450
And moreover, that criminal came home.

1917
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:58,070
That is when I decided

1918
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,360
Even if I couldn’t avenge my husband...

1919
02:19:01,490 --> 02:19:06,240
I would ensure that no harm
befalls any of you on my account.

1920
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:12,150
Even if you guys believed that
I deceived you people and verbally abused me,

1921
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:17,530
I did this so that you guys would stop.

1922
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:27,400
That's why I have decided to give
my money to Orphans and poor people like me.

1923
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:33,360
When you people forgot about revenge
and were happy...

1924
02:19:34,650 --> 02:19:35,320
Here...

1925
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:40,150
I packed your share of money into those five bags.

1926
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,490
I'll give them to you.

1927
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,360
Everything is fine.
How has this become about money?

1928
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:47,490
Give that money.

1929
02:19:48,360 --> 02:19:49,360
Give that money as well.

1930
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:53,650
From the begining there is no place for money in our Revenge.

1931
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:56,490
We got that unexpectedly and we kept it in our home.

1932
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:00,240
But we never thought about what to do with that money.

1933
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:03,200
I didn’t come here for money.

1934
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:09,700
I came for my granny.

1935
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:13,360
I used to live alone.

1936
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:16,200
All of a sudden, you women came into my life.

1937
02:20:17,530 --> 02:20:21,610
I thought that I would write a story about you people..
That's why I accepted to help you.

1938
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:28,320
But, I am not selfish anymore.

1939
02:20:30,150 --> 02:20:31,950
I am only filled with love.

1940
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:37,280
If there is a reason why an orphan has a great family...

1941
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:39,070
It’s because of you.

1942
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:46,820
Even if one of you goes missing,
I don’t know what I would do.

1943
02:20:53,490 --> 02:20:54,610
I need you with us, granny.

1944
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,740
Not just me.
All of us need you.

1945
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:58,490
You must tell us stories

1946
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:00,150
You must scold us when we are wrong.

1947
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:04,780
You must strengthen us and
guide us to survive just like you.

1948
02:21:10,530 --> 02:21:12,070
I told them that you are here

1949
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:14,860
They are coming for you.

1950
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:16,240
Go with them.

1951
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:26,110
Chinnu asked for an ice cream
I'll go and get that.

1952
02:21:26,490 --> 02:21:28,280
Are you ok with strawberry flavour?

1953
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:32,570
They escaped.

1954
02:21:33,490 --> 02:21:36,820
It’s pointless to try to frame them or
let the police catch them

1955
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:39,740
You do know where they live, right?

1956
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:42,200
Go and kill them all.
Leave none of them alive.

1957
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:44,570
Hello.

1958
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:47,700
Yes, this is Rasool speaking.

1959
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:48,610
Tell me, what's the matter?

1960
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,360
Rasool... What happened?

1961
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,280
Nothing, Dev.

1962
02:22:02,490 --> 02:22:03,030
Nothing happened.

1963
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,450
What happened, Rasool?

1964
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:06,240
That is...

1965
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:07,490
I made a small mistake

1966
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:12,780
You asked me to call the police...
and tell them that there is money in that writer’s house.

1967
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:17,780
In a hurry I called the police from my number.

1968
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:21,200
Apparently cyber crime traced my number.

1969
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,570
There is ... There is absolutely no problem, Dev.

1970
02:22:25,700 --> 02:22:28,780
I took the SIM card with fake ID proofs.

1971
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:30,700
I threw it out.
There won't be any problem.

1972
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:32,200
Ok, Fine.

1973
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:34,070
Give me the pen that’s in your pocket.

1974
02:22:35,110 --> 02:22:39,490
Dev, seeing your angry...
I was truly scared

1975
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:56,610
It isn’t hard for the police to come to me,
Once they trace you.

1976
02:22:58,030 --> 02:22:59,280
Can't they catch me?

1977
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:25,990
Sorry, Rasool.

1978
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:32,280
I didn't want to kill anyone...
I didn't think the old Dev was needed anymore.

1979
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:36,200
But I couldn't avoid it.

1980
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,030
Because of a gang...

1981
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:43,070
no... no... because of one person...

1982
02:23:44,530 --> 02:23:46,700
Infact because of one person from the gang.

1983
02:23:49,610 --> 02:23:50,860
Who is it?

1984
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:54,900
One among the gang...

1985
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:56,780
One along the gang...

1986
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:58,740
One behind the gang...

1987
02:23:59,110 --> 02:24:02,900
Damn this confusion, let's give it a name.

1988
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:07,650
GANG LEADER!

1989
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:14,610
How do you like it?

1990
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:17,110
You've got some guts, you landed in my garage directly.

1991
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,530
What else could I do?

1992
02:24:20,110 --> 02:24:23,360
I have a Granny who visits the temple everyday...

1993
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:26,610
I have a mother, who goes to the market every morning.

1994
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:30,450
A girl I am in love with goes for her job.

1995
02:24:30,570 --> 02:24:33,610
A college going sister and a daughter who goes to school.

1996
02:24:33,650 --> 02:24:39,990
As long as you are alive I'll live with fear...
every time they go out and come back.

1997
02:24:40,990 --> 02:24:42,490
Is that needed?

1998
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:45,990
What if I get rid of you?

1999
02:24:46,530 --> 02:24:48,950
You came alone to my Garage
and talking about killing me?

2000
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:51,030
Where did you get this courage from?

2001
02:24:52,450 --> 02:24:54,900
Do you know what is the long jump
world record in the Olympics?

2002
02:24:55,570 --> 02:24:57,200
9 metres!

2003
02:24:57,490 --> 02:24:58,780
We thought it's a quite a bit.

2004
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:02,240
But recently a man entered a lion's cage to feed it...

2005
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:05,950
only to realise that the lion was in close proximity
and he had to jump to save himself.

2006
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:07,400
Do you know how long that jump was...?

2007
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:09,490
10 metres!

2008
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:15,900
When the situation arrives,
courage and strength are likely to come with it.

2009
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:23,570
When I used to see a man with a family earlier,
I thought it only made him helpless...

2010
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,070
It is now that I realise...

2011
02:25:25,650 --> 02:25:28,110
Family isn't a weakness, it's a strength.

2012
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:35,700
I am the man who'd sit in a room and plagiarize stories.
How do you think I got the courage and come to kill you?

2013
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:44,650
I am still in the thriller genre

2014
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:49,150
Let's begin before I shift to being in the
Serial Killer genre.

2015
02:25:50,490 --> 02:25:52,200
What the hell are you going to start?

2016
02:28:04,110 --> 02:28:08,280
Since you gifted me a family, I have a return gift for you.

2017
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:11,860
I'll make sure that the world doesn't know
that you are the one who committed this crime.

2018
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:19,360
So Mr Dev, you'll die as India's N0.1 racer.

2019
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:44,950
Chinnu!
- Look how well she is dancing?

2020
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:45,780
Chinnu!

2021
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:47,570
Where did you go?

2022
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:50,360
I went to buy ice cream for Chinnu.

2023
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,070
And I got late.

2024
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,280
Granny, told us everything that happened.

2025
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:56,570
And we need to tell you something important.

2026
02:28:56,610 --> 02:28:57,280
What’s that?

2027
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:09,400
We decided to end this revenge.

2028
02:29:11,950 --> 02:29:14,740
I am not sad that I lost a son

2029
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:17,900
God has given me another one.

2030
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:20,360
I don’t need this revenge now...

2031
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:22,610
No...

2032
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:26,820
Let him go.
Karma will punish him according to his sins.

2033
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,400
I started this with the purpose of avenging for my brother.

2034
02:29:31,650 --> 02:29:34,860
But I found my brother
then, why should I bother now?

2035
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:39,950
The man who killed my dad is dead.

2036
02:29:41,650 --> 02:29:44,030
India’s leading car-racer Mr. Dev...

2037
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:48,570
was brutally killed today evening in a
fire accident that occurred In his own garage.

2038
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:50,400
He is dead, Granny.

2039
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:52,780
The one who killed my dad is dead.

2040
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:55,700
She ..
She just spoke.

2041
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:08,950
Are you happy?
- I am happy!

2042
02:30:12,570 --> 02:30:13,570
Shall we have some ice cream?

2043
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:14,740
Yes. Let’s eat.

2044
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:22,200
My precious kids.

2045
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:58,950
Hey, come on move.

2046
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:02,360
What kind of a case is this?
It's been torturing me since one and half year.

2047
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:09,860
How did this dog's leash get here?

2048
02:32:10,030 --> 02:32:13,650
Sir, at the place of the robbery we found
some unrecognised blood marks.

2049
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:16,820
We came to know that it's an animal's blood marks
after we got it analysed at the forensic lab.

2050
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:22,070
The same day the robbers hit a dog
with their van and killed it.

2051
02:32:22,110 --> 02:32:23,070
This leash belongs to that dog.

2052
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:23,860
Sravani..!

2053
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:26,030
Did you findout who this dog belongs to?

2054
02:32:27,860 --> 02:32:29,530
Ok, next...

2055
02:32:30,150 --> 02:32:31,780
What's you name?
- Suresh.

2056
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:33,530
Mr Suresh

2057
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:36,860
Ok, thank you.

2058
02:32:39,650 --> 02:32:41,150
What's you name?
- Phani.

2059
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:42,900
Phani? Funny name

2060
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:45,070
Next...

2061
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:46,780
Your name?

2062
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:49,400
Sukumar... I am a Telugu film Director.

2063
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:52,320
Hello, Sir.

2064
02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:55,280
You are the Director of 'Dramaland' (Rangasthalam)...?

2065
02:32:56,110 --> 02:32:58,320
'Dramaland'..?
Yeah, It's me.

2066
02:32:58,530 --> 02:33:00,950
I don't watch a lot of telugu movies,
It's mostly hollywood.

2067
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:01,950
What about this book?

2068
02:33:01,990 --> 02:33:05,360
This is an original, based on a true story...
my story.

2069
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:07,820
I really liked your book..
I want to adapt it for a film.

2070
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:08,740
Will you give me the rights for the story?

2071
02:33:09,070 --> 02:33:10,570
Of course... why woudn't I?

2072
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:12,360
Before that you have to sign a copy for me.

2073
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:13,700
Definitely.

2074
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:24,530
This book is dedicated to My Granny, my mom,
my wife, my sister, my daughter and Sravani.

2075
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:26,450
