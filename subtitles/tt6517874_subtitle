00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,447
Ram, so... I am arriving tomorrow

3
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,453
I can't wait actually

4
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:09,828
Those forests, farms, mountains, flowers, birds

5
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,702
and that lake too...l miss them all...

6
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,574
And more than anything, I miss you Ram

7
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,311
let me not talk much and cause a mess.

8
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,554
Better than last Januarymthese beautiful
4 days" keep them ready for me !

9
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,390
See you soon

11
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,960
- Well played doctor-Thank you

12
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,347
because Rehman, you are new here

13
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,685
I've my own principles for drinking.

14
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,977
4 pegs in the evening...

15
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,582
and after that I play couple of games here

16
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,313
I become sober again

17
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,822
The benefit about that is
I am ready for a couple of more drinks

18
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,554
And no need to gym in the morning!

19
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,018
You too can try that out, Rehman!

20
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,625
Oh no! lam fine this way!

21
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,030
I am open.. Shall I ask you something?

22
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,301
Ask me!

23
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,373
Elvis, we haven't got the cheque of our tennis
court

24
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,711
Oh...l forgot!

25
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,981
Being a film producer, how can you forget such
things?

26
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,984
If we don't get the payment on-time,
how do we run our work?

27
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,978
Promise..l will get it tomorrow

28
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,585
Carry on

29
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,514
And now, back to what I was telling...

30
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,393
I am 39 and happily married.

31
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,726
Happily married... in all its sense!

32
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,661
My daughter is 10 years old.

33
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,735
The problem with me is

34
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
Even now when I see chics, I lose control...

35
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,970
to the extent that ...it becomes a mess!

36
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,572
Can I overcome it?

37
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,878
This is true! A big problem!

38
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,815
Try meditation!

39
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,353
Oh...l went for that! When I went there,
found more chics there!

40
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,810
That's the problem!

41
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,620
In spite of this, Elvis if you're
leading a happy married life...

42
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,326
then yourwife must be a very broadminded
lady!

43
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,392
I am even more broadminded!

44
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,556
We live just once!
What's the point in suppressing our desires?

45
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,628
With wife, it is love! With other women, it is
lust!

46
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,134
If that is differentiated, then family life is easy!

47
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,737
In turn, if Mrs.Elvis applies the same principle?

48
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,746
I'd welcome her with both my hands!
I've no double standard for this!

49
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,741
Doctor, have a peg for company

50
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,611
Oh No! I am afraid of Police!

51
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,613
I've asked for a bottle-parcel

52
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,119
Nowadays wife is my company

53
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,823
Why parcel? I've Jack Daniel's in my vehicle.
I'll bring it!

54
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,157
Hello! Who's this?

55
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,564
When was that?

56
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,440
Ok, I'll come fast. sure will come soon!

57
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,643
What happened Elvis?

58
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,971
My wife has had an accident!

59
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,407
I'd told her a 100 times to drive carefully!

60
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,149
Which hospital? Nothing serious, right?

61
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,418
Even if it is serious, they would say no only!

62
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,420
I'll go and be back soon!

63
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,146
Do you want me to come?

64
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,991
Oh Sorry! I'll get you Jack Daniel's!

65
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,687
Hey! I didn't mean that!

66
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,724
How's she now, sister?

67
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,994
How many times do I tell you
there's nothing serious?!

68
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,638
Will inform you if we need anything!

69
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,713
They're telling that I can't see her!

70
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,180
Nothing to worry!

71
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,040
I spoke to the doctor.
Just there for an observation,

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,510
She may be moved to the ward tomorrow itself!

73
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,119
I never trust these hospitals

74
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,691
Who is Malini's attendent?

75
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:28,616
Me!

76
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,615
Is it because you knew me to be her husband...

77
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,152
...you consoling me saying there's
nothing serious!

78
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,423
Here!

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,160
What? These are her belongings, aren't they?

80
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:37,898
Yes!

81
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,130
What happened...what happened to her'?

82
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,534
You are a real pain"!

83
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,703
If you speak that way, you'll see my true self!

84
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey Elvis? You go sit there!

85
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,868
Why is she giving these to me?

86
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,203
They can't hold them here..

87
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:52,846
Oh that's all

88
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,845
You go! Let me talk to him.

89
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,647
- Can't he understand what I say?
- He is under stress.

90
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,891
- Sister handle your work.. I will deal this! -Ok

Yes!

102

Then, would we be able to go for the
Spell Bee competition in Singapore?

103
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,327
We'll go!

104

Will she be alright by then?

- Hi Elvis!-Yes Suni, what happened?

111
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,292
I checked the records in the office.

112
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,330
It was George's vehicle in which
Malini had gone last year.

113
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,731
First, went to Kothamangalam
then, from there to Vagamon

114
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,641
Vagamon?

115
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,742
For digging out a year old taxi receipts
you must treat me, ok?

116
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:36,773
What is this for?

117
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,081
That... You whatsapp me immediately,
there's a purpose!

118
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,212
I was about to call you.

119
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,218
If you don't settle the payment within 3 months,
then".

120
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,322
- It won't be profitable to ply for you regularly.
- I will give.

121
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:47,954
Will call you!

123
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,039
All children participating in the Palakkad
programme left in the morning itself.

124
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,299
In one way it is good that Malini
is not performing there tomorrow.

125
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,737
Othenlvise, the whole program me would've
become a mess!

126
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:06,432
Keep it there!

127
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,435
She told that she will be performing there!

128
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,172
Really?

129
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,142
May be she changed her programme later!

130
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,214
What happened Elvis?

131
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:17,252
Nothing! How has she planned to go there?
Is the driver there?

132
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,217
What happened to you, Elvis?

133
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,383
It was you who'd asked her to drive to
Palakkad!

134
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,922
I'm fed up! Things won't be found in its place!

135
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,059
And please don't fight with her for this!

136
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,299
Long ago, when I drove the vehicle,
I too met with an accident like this.

137
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,664
But the one who was hit was the one
hospitalized.

138
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,167
Salim spent a heavy sum for it that day!

139
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,864
From then on, I lost my confidence!

140
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,437
Did you sign those cheques?

141
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,770
O God! I forgot! One second!

142
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,774
Elvis, you are going to the hospital, right?

143
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,678
<i>Get this signed by MaYmi, ck?</i>

144
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,947
- Didn't she sign it still? - She has written
everything. May be she forgot to sign.

145
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,451
And reminding you, don't scold her for this!

146
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,059
Check if everything is there.

147
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,695
Your club fund, Aditi's school donation,
and then your home loan, right?

148
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,793
Okthen, let me go. It's time for the cooking
class.

149
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,480
Sorry! I drove with maximum care.

150
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,818
But somehow this happened! Sorry Elvis!

151
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,221
What happened to your program me at Palakkad
today?

152
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,962
Those...children will take care. I'll talk to them.

153
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,487
Your phone is at home. I forgot to bring it.

154
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,365
Oh! I'll call from the Iandline here.

155
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,038
If you're coming in the evening, bring me the
phone.

156
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,940
Today is the last day for paying Adi's fees.
Please don't forget.

157
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,316
What is your problem regarding who signs it?

158
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,382
I just asked for the cheque signed by your wife.

159
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,050
Why do you get heated up for that?

160
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,118
Your wife's money is your money, right?

161
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,382
What's the problem in this?

162
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,494
I don't have the necessity to live on my wife's
money!

163
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,223
Then, how else are you living now?

164
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,559
Aren't you ashamed to earn by
making your wife dance?

165
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,036
Don't play with me.

166
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,039
Don't play with me in the power
of your ancestral properties

167
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,874
This place is different

168
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,943
You keep 910N191

169
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,547
Oh you can't do anything man

170
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,557
Did you become mad yesterday?

171
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,226
Enough! Keep it there.

172
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,195
Tell me what's the matter.

173
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,093
She has an affair that I am unaware!

174
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,528
For whom?

175
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,233
Malini has an affair that I don't know!

176
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,533
<i>For Mann?! What nonsense?!?</i>

177
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,931
This isn't a joke, Salim!

178
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,481
Elvis, don't we know Malini well?

179
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:04,248
Women act as innocent as kittens!

180
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,590
Hope you haven't asked this to her!

181
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,219
- No!- Good!

182
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,631
A few days back, my wife Nasni used to get
regular calls from a particular number.

183
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:15,965
When I attend, it gets cut!

184
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,596
I lost my sleep for one week!

185
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,230
When I enquired, I found that it
was a distant relative of hers.

186
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,064
The kid was dialing unknowingly

187
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,401
Luckily, I didn't ask her about it.

188
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,239
If she comes to know that I had doubted her,
she would've killed me!

189
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,345
This is not that!

190
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,109
This is not a matter of today or tomorrow
but a matter of many years

191
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,284
I was fooled!

192
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,924
Last January, she said she's going to
see her grandmother but she didn't go there!

193
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:50,892
She DIDN'T go!

194
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,291
How did you know that?

195
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,232
Last month, after Malini's Uncle's death,
that ancestral house has been locked.

196
00:14:55,661 --> 00:15:00,076
I enquired <i>,</i> man! She was going to Palakkad
for programme only to see him!

197
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,639
Did you see that video?

198
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,642
After our marriage, I haven't seen
her so beautiful till now!

199
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,279
She dressed up for his sake!

200
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,455
There's someone! We've to find him out Salim!

201
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,320
I won't leave him!

202
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,586
Poor thing! No it won't be like that

203
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,257
Do you know him?

204
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,660
Didn't we all go for a tour to Vagamon 2-3 years
back?

205
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,060
When?

206
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,539
To overcome your grief of losing money
of the film you produced,

207
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,244
To Eden Resort!

208
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,342
<i>Rama“...</i>

209
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,519
I have met him a couple of times regarding the
villa project.

210
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,345
This can't be him!

211
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,351
This may be the shooting of rehearsal of her
stage programme!

212
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,694
Do you have his number?

213
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,488
Yes I have!

214
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,066
It's not like before. Mobile phone is working
these days.

215
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:57,926
Call him!

216
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,500
Or tell me his number, I'll call him!

217
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,679
Why are you dialing from Malini's mobile?

218
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,098
Hello! Malini?

219
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:35,970
What?

220
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,971
Slice I, 2,3...1,2,3...

221
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,448
The right place for kaikottikalli (dance)

222
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,747
But will they allow me for that...Nasni

223
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,348
Please ask Salim bro to talk to that doctor

224
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,752
I can take rest at home, right?

225
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,759
Without doing the routine diagnostic
procedure, I don't think they'll discharge you

226
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,424
You don't get tensed.

227
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,258
There won't be any problem in the Palakkad
programme

228
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,093
I've made something special for you to eat.

229
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,098
You sit here and eat this.

230
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,126
I'll make and bring you mutton biriyani in the
afternoon.

231
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,800
.Qkay-Lef'S go!

232
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,501
I am not coming! -What?

233
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,133
Go my dear! Don't miss your class!

234
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,446
O Malini, just a matter of4 days.

235
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,816
Just think you're giving rest to your body! See
you!

236
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,455
Four days!!!

237
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:43,557
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

238
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,100
Very good mud!

239
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,107
If you scrub this on your body and take bath,
it'll be great!

240
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,246
Are you coming?

241
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,384
Run! Run!

242
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,757
Caught you, right? Caught you!
You can't beat Varmaji

243
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,366
Now, Madam you run, I'll catch!

244
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,365
No need!

245
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,430
Enough of playing!

246
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,439
Come, we'll play

247
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,539
I was State level Champion for two times!

248
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,575
Come soon.

249
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,713
- After coming here, I feel totally refreshed!-Run
slowly

250
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,546
If something happens, there isn't even
a hospital near by

251
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,379
- Why do you imagine such things?
- Then, how should I think?

252
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,553
Building something in the forest and call it a
Resort!

253
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,124
Sister, don't get scared!

254
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,452
<i>- I'll</i> take care of the kids
- Then why are you coming behind us?

255
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,425
- Go behind the kids, man
- You go and see. I will come

256
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,596
- What did you say Malini?-Nothing

257
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,935
- Where is the end of this?-There's no end for
this!

258
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,464
It's spread all over! The 50 acres that you see
there...

259
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,175
It is attached to the property we bought last
year

260
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:26,806
Nice

261
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,311
Who are all there in your house, Varmaji?

262
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,303
Everyone was there...

263
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,674
then I became an orphan for a sum of 15 Iakhs!

264
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,441
What?

265
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,884
I mean, I had debts and everyone left me!

266
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:42,858
The mountains those border is fully in bloom!

267
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,604
Leave it Elvis!

268
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,574
You tried your maximum to produce a best
quality film

269
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,444
Whafsthe use? It flopped, right?
Bombed in the box office

270
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,454
Here there is no range also

271
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,753
Didn't I tell you that we'll go to Bangkok!

272
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,291
At least there, one work would've got done!
Here, we're simply whining!

273
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,429
Without wife and children, what celebration for
us?

274
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,632
Wife and children - at Bangkok? Very nice then!

275
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,600
Kerala's topmost builder!

276
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,697
One who knows to throw the stick
must be given the stick

277
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,238
Is this forest the big thing here?

278
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,308
We could've gone to Ooty or Kodaikanal!

279
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,534
I was just telling him that!

280
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,548
Let me make arrangements for dinner

281
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,546
Don't make it boring like in the afternoon

282
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,979
<i>I will</i> try my maximum

283
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,287
- What? To make it boring?-To make it good!

284
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,280
I'll spit in the food I serve you

285
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,990
He is a womanizer

286
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,682
Really? Then he'll get it from me!

287
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,453
No problem with him. He is a poor thing Elvis!

288
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,959
Who is not a poor thing for you!

289
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,524
Everyone is like that!

290
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,527
- A fool, who has not seen the world!
- That is an advantage for you Elvis!

291
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,411
- Got signall-I didn't get!

292
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,840
May be a weak signal!

293
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,613
Yes! Correct! Signal has gone!

294
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:17,987
Shucks!

295
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:19,580
What happened?

296
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,014
What?

297
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,060
- Messed upl-What?

298
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,327
By mistake, video was sent in Apartment
group! Shucks!

299
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,965
What a mess!

300
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,961
The women and children in that flat are in the
group!

301
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,868
When it comes to your phone, don't see it

302
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,398
Why not? Am I not matured enough?

303
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,701
Is it only for you men?

304
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,310
I thought of Promotional video that bullshit film
I produced is the reason for everything

305
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,575
Now, you got good promotion, right?

306
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,682
Didn't I tell you to take comedy film!

307
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,716
You have taken the Malayalam film just like
Tamil film!

308
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:50,986
It will be a surprise, if it didn't flop!

309
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,849
It's only because you are useless, Salim

310
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,756
When women blabber like this,
whack them and they'll be alright!

311
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,891
Then, she will lose her identity

312
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,051
Even after crossing 30 years of age,

313
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,827
how many women have the sense
of humour in this Kerala?

314
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,562
Then to have rare items like this
at our home is a credit, isn't it?

315
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,970
When we return home in a tensed mood,

316
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,838
to hear some funny talks like this,
will be a comfort for me!

317
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,705
Was the other video full nude?

318
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,706

00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,009
- You keep quiet. - Even people with
no problems, have died due to heart attacks.

347
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,421
Shall we go! Hold and sit!

348
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,849
Hold and sit, dear, othenlvise you'll fall!

349
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,846
- Lion will come-Ayyo

350
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,445
Have a look!

351
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,023
Not like that! Turn it

352
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,026
Don't break the binocular! ...it's for seeing
the bath, ..No.. for seeing birds!

353
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,263
How beautiful!

354
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,005
If you want to see elephant, you must pray!

355
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,069
An Englishman who prayed the other day,
is in the hospital now.

356
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,548
- That Pazhassi Raja cinema...-Was that shot
here?

357
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,943
No no. That forest was artificial!
This is original forest!

358
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,577
The first house in which man was born.

359
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,602
How many hours' ride is this?

360
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,997
Can't say like that. Depends on whether
we reach there or not

361
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,180
- What's it?-Press the accelerator more

362
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,850
- Press the accelerator-Raise it

363
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,649
Don't get scaredmthis is a normal thing here!

364
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,854
- Hmm...Gone awry-What happened

365
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:49,783
A Pit!

366
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,153
To move forward, the vehicle needs to be
pushed.

367
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,595
Everybody come...come on! It's an adventure,
isn't it?

368
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,158
Pushing vehicle an adventure?

369
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,000
Get down Najuma. Let the children sit here.
Others get down!

370
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,627
<i>- I'll</i> also push from here!-Come Nazini, let's
push!

371
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,299
Not me! I can't! -Good

372
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:07,840
Just push and see

373
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,278
PUSH!

374
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:15,742
Long ago, in my building site, a lorry got stuck!
All alone, I...

375
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,748
He asked you to push with your hands!
You can push with your mouth later!

376
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,014
- Push!-Here it is

377
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,950
No strength! Only fat for everyone!

378
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,190
Push, push, push the crappy vehicle

379
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,855
Think of Pulimurugan's Moopan and push

380
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,994
Done!

381
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,839
- Stop only after you reach the top -Come soon!

382
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:37,836
A real adventure!

383
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,834
Let yourfat burn down, move...run!

384
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,675
Have you run in the Olympics?

385
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,604
Don't fall down.

386
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,008
I'll hold your hand

387
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,292
We're reaching the top! Stop! Stop! Stop!

388
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,594
Come, get down!

389
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,665
Play carefully -Adi, Sana!

390
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,038
<i>- Don't go too fad-OK</i>

391
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,663
Beautiful place!

392
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,668
There are Hornbills (thirsty birds) here
They pine at night

393
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,675
When I returned from Dubai,
I too went there and pined

394
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,639
- Reality of life-Oh is it?

395
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,314
- Take a photo-Or else, you take!

396
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,052
This is selfie. Set it right

397
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,885
You said it's a good camera, but the clarity is
less

398
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,925
Battery low!

399
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,355
Do you feel like committing suicide?

400
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,395
When standing in heights, some people get
such tendencies!

401
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,867
Nonsense!

402
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,169
There is no necessity for me to commit suicide
now!

403
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,669
I am happy with my life! Did you hear?

404
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,673
Happy about life?

405
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,312
What's it?

406
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,880
What inspires you to live - is it happiness?

407
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,117
Isn't it the end?

408
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,352
Greedy about life! That's correct, isn't it?

409
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,221
The craving for life!

410
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,687
Who are you?

411
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,297
<i>Rama“! This is my Eden Garden'.!</i>

412
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,871
Finished playing? Then, we'll leave!

413
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,335
Hat's off to the people who travel by this jeep

414
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,338
My spine is gone

415
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,515
The horse's tail looks like your hair!

416
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,050
That's why it is called pony tail!

417
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,218
Hey! That flush isn't working!

418
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,256
What's the need? Go and sit in the forest!

419
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,517
A kind of pleasure!

420
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,323
I don't want any kind of pleasure!
Get me some papers!

421
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,227
We don't buy papers here!

422
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,957
Salim, do you have some more places like this?

423
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,295
No TV, no rangemand to shit -the flush is not
working!

424
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,463
Try living without these things for 2 days, Elvis!

425
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,307
- You'll feel different!
- Without shitting? Who are you?

426
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,874
Didn't I tell you - he is the owner of this Resort!

427
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,512
I'll just come! Stomach upset!

428
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:31,479
Ram an!

429
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,881
<i>Mm going'.!</i>

430
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,343
Don't go! Come here my baby!

431
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,350
- How was the ride?-Don't talk to me!

432
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,355
Shall we go for a horse-ride? Look here.

433
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,890
That's not there in this package!

434
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,488
Then why that idiot...

435
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,897
Not ride, but he used to go for race!
Now he's become old!

436
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,360
Retired life with us, right?

437
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,862
Uncle, what's the name of that?

438
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:51,863
GLOBAL

439
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,535
He lived globally!

440
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,200
Come...come

441
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,202
Getting old is not a disease, right?

442
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,873
To trick people in the name of a resort - a
horse!

443
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:01,873
Right, my child?

444
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,047
Drink tea!

445
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,476
But still, you didn't come father!

446
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,213
I'll come tomorrow!

447
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,544
Really? Where?

448
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,379
A big cave is there!

449
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,385
He's such a nice father, isn't he?

450
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,220
Why should I tell you that?

451
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,493
Normally, wives like to hear such things.
That's why I said!

452
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,896
For me, it isn't like that!

453
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:21,529
Really?

454
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,896
Then, we are conducting a crash course
that you can attend!

455
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:25,897
What course?

456
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,370
Many dreams that lie quietly within you ?
We can help you relive it!

457
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,065
Oh God! Another business in this name!

458
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,902
Nothing is asleep within me.

459
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,079
Even if it is there, I'll bear it, did you hear?

460
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,537
Why do you have to bear it?

461
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,383
This irritating habit - did you get it from birth?

462
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,467
"The jingling sound of the forest"

463
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,241
Going round with this song for 25 years!

464
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,540
If we pour a little rum in this, it'll be best!

465
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,910
I'll kill you! Don't waste it.

466
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,383
It's not right to disturb your privacy anymore!

467
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,550
$0, good night!

468
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,392
There's no other programme in the room, right?
Going to sleep?

469
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,619
Then sit here for some more time!

470
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:28,927
If you want, I'll play the guitar.

471
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,068
Sit for some more time!
Will pay extra if needed! Enough?

472
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,527
If Elvis says, I'll sit!

473
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,374
That's it!
The only thing that has value is money!

474
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,910
So, you've come!

475
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,384
What's this? A Zoo?

476
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,489
That's Pappu and Pappi - the guards of Eden
Garden!

477
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,483
Varmaji, do you've a donkey here?

478
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,394
Donkey? Why?

479
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,494
One is there at home!

480
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,329
Comedy!

481
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,329
Come again! To carry this dirty sack,
a donkey is needed, right?

482
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,364
Again a comedy!

483
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,364
Yes...yes

484
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,501
You've come? How's your headache?

485
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:08,904
Not bad!

486
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,910
It's a good place for a 2-3 days stay!

487
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,237
But full time, it'll be boring, right?

488
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,538
It's good!

489
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,547
Do you've any other business other than this?

490
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,909
I've a firm - Green!

491
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,343
That's good! Green!

492
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,918
It's the name of my flopped film!

493
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,383
You know it Salim - my flopped film!

494
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,079
Then, which film of yours was a success?

495
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,058
- That's.. - Say

496
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,228
Don't hurt him by saying such things

497
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,224
What firm?

498
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,566
We make forests.

499
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,070
We people only destroy the forests.

500
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,237
That's the problem.

501
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,367
We make small forests in big cities.

502
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,505
Have you heard of Miyawaki method?

503
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:49,540
Who?

504
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,546
Miyawaki!

505
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,242
What's the use of making forests?

506
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:00,681
Forests give us good breeze, fresh fruits

507
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,391
...then when we keep a garden,
there's no maintenance issue, etc, etc.

508
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,524
Interesting!

509
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,561
It can be done in our building sites, right?

510
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,228
How many projects have you done so far'?

511
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,395
Thirty three

512
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,730
In many States of India
but not even one in Kerala is a surprise!

513
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,670
Shall we discuss in detail?

514
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,406
We'll do it later!
Why should we make it boring for them!

515
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,584
- Let Malini sing a song! -Hmm!

516
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,581
But not sad song.

517
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:32,413
Do you sing?

518
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,587
She'll singmbut her main item is dance!

519
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,093
You sing. While drinking it's best for this
ambience

520
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,269
May be because we're sitting here!

What's this sir'?

I told you many times.

This is something that we give money and get,

to change this habit of yours.

This outburst and anger are the reasons
for all the problems in your life!

What he did was wrong, wasn't it?

559
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,622
How can he pour rum into children's food?

560
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,288
You have justification for everything.

561
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,965
They live here like a family.
Don't create any more problems

562

Where's Adi?

563
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,368
She said that she's going to sleep with Nazni.

564
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,301
Why so?

565
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,307
I don't know

Shall I move?

00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,309
Tomorrow, is it enough if we leave by 10?

568
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,619
For the shooting to begin and get set,
it'll take time

569
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,979
From here, only half-an-hourjourney
to the location, right?

570
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:00,981
I'm not coming

571
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,324
What are you going to do sitting alone here?

572
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,994
Nazni and children are in excitement
about seeing Mamooty tomorrow

Those who don't want to come, needn't come

574
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,802
Tomorrow, if I see you with a long face,
you'll see my true colours!

575
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:14,969
I'm warning you now itself!

To drink again?

My head is burning

You go Salim!

582
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,422
Had enough of going to Elvis's shooting
location...

583
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,293
I am now scared to even watch a shooting.

584
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,597
It's a matter of few minutes.

585
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,303

Why not?

597

Come girl! Nothing to get scared of.

598

A great view if we go on top.

TN. you can!

607
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,011
There's a famous story about a rat.
Have you heard it?

608
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,653
Behind a dark big cave, there is a piece of
cheese.

609
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,822
And the rat is scared of darkness.

610
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,995
One fine day, the rat bravely went into the dark.

611
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,464
At first, darkness scared the rat,

612
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,002
but as it went on moving forward,
it became an excitement.

613
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,634
In that way, finally, the rat got the cheese!

614
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,476
That's the story.

615
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,480
Why did you tell me this story now?

616
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,008
I am not scared of anything.

617
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:15,748
Careful!

618
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,190
As if I don't know that!

619
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,017
Are the forests that we see here, made by you?

620
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,594
Was that what you told yesterday?

621
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,161
There is no need to make these forests.
It's enough if we protect it.

622
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,994
Then, where all have you made forests?

623
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,569
First project was in Bangalore

624
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:35,837
3 years back.

625
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,467
Got small contacts from there...

626
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,642
Then Pune, Delhi, mostly Corporate clients.

627
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:46,478
Only these people, who work full time on the
computer, need a good breezy atmosphere.

628
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,177
It's really there. You can check our website.

629
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,749
What made you do such a thing?

630
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,657
Actually, it was my wife's idea.

631
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,659
I'm just executing it.

632
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,629
As I went along, I started liking it very much.

633
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,995
Where's your wife? What's she doing?

634
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:06,626
She died!

635
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,837
Still brushing!

636
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,178
Workers are there in the farm.

637
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,013
I'm going there only.

638
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,015
I'll also come.
We should build the bund before noon.

639
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,846
Must be really depressed, right?

640
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,315
When will Elvis come? I need to talk to him.

641
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,754
When he wakes up, he won't remember
any of the happenings.

642
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,332
He's been like this for some time.

643
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,298
Sorry for what happened yesterday.

644
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,304
It's ok.

645
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,637
Shall I leave?

646
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,305
Can I also come to the farm?

647
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,296
Do you've the habit of doing this type of work?

648
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,632
Of course! My maternal home is in Idukki!

649
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,167
Please do visit our land and farm there.

650
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,963
Were you the one who ploughed all that land?

651
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,640
Thank God! She smiled!

652
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,665
People from town get tempted
to work on seeing the spade!

653
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,168
Be careful! You may cut your leg.

654
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,312
Varmaji, are you not joining?

655
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:27,815
<i>I will</i> not be able to tolerate this heat!

656
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,177
Only Dubai temperature suits me!

657
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,380
Go and feed Puppu and Puppy

658
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:33,821
You need to go to Town, right?

659
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,656
<i>Even otherwise what is the point of being here?</i>

660
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,385
Are you both classmates?

661
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,624
If he ever had such considerations,
would he treat me as a slave?

662
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,966
In fact I was serving food to
Arab's daughter in Dubai!

663
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,792
Now I'm destined to feed his dogs!

664
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,638
Who is living at your maternal home?

665
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,802
Grandma! Only grandma lives there.

666
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,647
Do you use only these vegetables for cooking
here?

667
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,810
Of course! We are self-sustained here!

668
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:03,977
Good!

669
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,386
Madam, your song was really good.

670
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,291
It was somewhat similar to Ramanettan's wife's
song, isn't it Rametta?

671
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,794
Does your wife sing?

672
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:15,956
Hmm!

673
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,174
Miyawaki- that you mentioned yesterday - was
it real?

674
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,972
Or were you lying?

675
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,179
No..that was her teachermAkira Miyawaki!

676
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,640
She is a Blue planet prize winner!

677
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,312
And she is still alive now.

678
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,982
Oh! She is yet to come.

679
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:38,811
Who?

680
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,955
Yellow Bulbul! A very rare breed!

681
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,186
Four years ago she built a nest here.

682
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,452
And every year, without fail,
she comes and lays egg during this season.

683
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,970
Eden garden was actually our retirement plan.

684
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:00,170
Our plan was to marry off our children
and settle here in our old days

685
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,302
What was your wife ailing with?

686
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:03,969
Illness!

687
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,973
But Malini was happy...

688
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:06,977
till death.

689
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:08,483
Malini?!

690
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:10,485
Hmm!

691
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,822
Remember me only with happiness
were her last words.

692
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:21,963
Strangely, I miss Malini
a lot while going to the Cinema

693
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,163
A sudden feeling that no one is beside me!

694
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,160
So, I stopped watching Cinema

695
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,473
Planting one Iakh trees was her desire!

696
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,971
Most of the time I bully her mentioning that.

697
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:36,467
And on one fine day, she went away.

698
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,984
How many trees have you planted by now?

699
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:44,982
Miles to go!

700
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,192
In 1973, when my grandpa bought this property,

701
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,830
...it was a Cardamom Estate.

702
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,991
After my Grandpa's period.

703
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,495
My father and brothers were not able to look
after this,

704
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,330
and it transformed into a Forest!

705
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,631
Only 3 - 4 yrs back <i>,</i> I thought of
remodelling it into a resort

706
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,169
for people wishing for life style change.

707
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,015
If at all, I could at least get to know some new
people!

708
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,008
Come.

709
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,512
As my grandpa's reminiscence, only this is left
behind.

710
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:22,983
Where did that Sharif f go?

711
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:24,325
Nice!

712
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,995
My grandpa had built that house.

713
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,327
Cleaning that house is the only job left here.
Would like to join us?

714
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,329
Oh no! Today's quota is over!

715
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,330
Would Elvis have come?

716
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,196
No, they will be back only by evening.

717
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,006
A Family is God's Greatest Masterpiece!

718
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,202
Everything will become alright.

719
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,005
<i>Life is ck.</i>

720
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,509
But indeed it was not this I longed for.

721
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,507
An artist!

722
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,510
Becoming a Dancer, Singer and known
by everyone across the world!

723
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,020
Hat's off to you

724
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,855
You shouldn't have pursued Law, but
Psychology!

725
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,187
While doing my degree, I got married.

726
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,588
Since my parents died when I was small,

727
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,500
My grandma had too much of pressure in
getting me married off!

728
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:12,337
Watching my dance at University Fest,
Elvis came with such a proposal.

729
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:18,343
According to my family, Elvis family is a
big Cinema family com pared to ours!

730
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:19,411
Oh really!

731
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,214
Certainly! Elvis's grandpa started it.

732
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,349
Chummar Films!

733
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,850
Elvis's father made it a bit worse.

734
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,352
And Elvis worsened it further.

735
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,486
Both are very smart!

736
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,489
After my marriage, in three months
I became pregnant.

737
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,988
And that's the end of my desires.

738
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,001
That is the reason I Aém asking
you to attend our course.

739
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,201
What if I try today?

740
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:43,830
It's not possible now.

741
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,506
It's a 4 day course! Next time.

742
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,999
You are lying! Business tactics again.

743
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:54,511
What happened?

744
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,512
Why don't we go back?

745
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:01,985
I still have time.

746
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:05,984
Otherwise no need.

747
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:07,491
Shall we go back?

748
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:09,326
Hmm.

749
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,202
Didn't I say, they will be back only by night?

750
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,507
Bye, then.

751
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,679
Tomorrow morning, I would leave.

752
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:27,674
Where?

753
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,512
Your life is full time confined in this, right?

754
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:31,214
Mostly.

755
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,210
Occasionally, I have a site visit

756
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,020
Our Urban forests in Bangalore and Pune,

757
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,520
Got to check on whether the urban forests
are flourishes well?

758
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,418
Ok bye!

759
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,496
It was really a good day.

760
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,332
So, we won't be seeing each other again, right?

761
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,665
Actually that is a positive thought...

762
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,207
"if thought well

763
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:55,510
Nice meeting.

764
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,655
We could only watch the shooting!

765
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,024
Only waste of time!

766
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,352
You could've sustained in Dubai for few more
days

767
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,552
During the time my marriage got fixed, I was
out inside!

768
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,362
Out inside? How?

769
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,026
My business collapsed and
I was in Dubai jail for 3 months

770
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,704
- Wasn't there Raman to help you at that time?
- Hmm!

771
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,369
That is how friends should be!

772
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,708
More than this, what else do I need to do?

773
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,043
Needn't do anything.

774
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,442
Just finance for my next movie.

775
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:31,644
Best Subject!

776
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,548
Yes..Yes.. have your drink.

777
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,375
In Dubai, it was goat days

778
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,552
here it is forest life! That's the difference.

779
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,017
Oh! Here they reached!

780
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,018
Come all of you.

781
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,690
You guys really missed it. Fantastic fishing!

782
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,355
We caught this fish.

783
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,358
Really? Look all of you.

784
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,359
It still got life!

785
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,428
You must have caught this small fish, right?

786
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:55,227
- Today Raman's special food for dinner with the
fish you caught ok? - Ok

787
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,704
Where is the cook then?

788
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,365
Gone to the town.
Will return by night.

789
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,635
He's got to leave tomorrow morning.

790
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,710
- What fish is this? - Kanakunanji

791
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,042
In our hometown, they call it as Puyapla kora

792
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,546
Couldn't you try somewhere else in the Middle
east?

793
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,247
Yes, I could.
And my liabilities also would be settled!

794
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,556
But I too will be able to come here as a guest
only!

795
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,368
Don't desire someone's wife, Raman!

796
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,714
A good father can also become a bad husband,
right?

797
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,377
And that difference only a wife
can understand is the comedy!

798
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,050
No use of all this philosophy!

799
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,382
I just gave a try with my Dubai experience.

800
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,253
Not possible! Completely different level!

801
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,019
Shut up! This isn't that!

802
00:50:55,285 --> 00:51:01,031
In this world, between a man and woman,
only one relationship exists!

803
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,362
- What?- Physical relationship

804
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,366
To tell more clearly it's sexual relationship

805
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,375
Within a man, there is a woman, do you know?

806
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,046
Only when realizing it, a Man becomes a true
man!

807
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:16,046
- Vice versa like half male, half female" - Ok..Ok.

808
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,543
I guess you got something with her

809
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:19,486
No.

810
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,346
Yes

811
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,249
No.

812
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:21,852
NO

813
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:22,347
Yes.

814
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,354
Say that!

815
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,858
What to say?

816
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,859
I know you since a longtime!

817
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,865
You didn't get attracted to
any woman till now,

818
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,458
But what is so special in her?

819
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,700
She is also an ordinary woman.

820
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,468
You will not be able to understand if I say.

821
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,864
That's what I've been telling in layman's
language"

822
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,368
Oversmart people like you will pretend
and call it friendship initially.

823
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,375
Then it'll turn into deep friendship.

824
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,707
And ultimately divine love without touching
each other.

825
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:47,881
Only later on you will understand

826
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,906
relationship will become complete
unless and until bodies unite.

827
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,888
This is what in our layman's language we call it
as..

828
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,556
You go to sleep.

829
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,391
Your bird will fly away in 2 days

830
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,389
And I quit

831
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,220
- Eh?!
- I quit

832
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:07,018
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

833
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,455
Excellent drink!

834
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,256
- Are you coming? - Hmm!

835
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,730
Hold me please! I'm scared even to see water!

836
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,403
Then don't come. You don't know swimming, do
you?

837
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,903
Let her come. One of us will get down.

838
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,301
Not necessary. How can I have a drink with
her'?

839
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,409
She won't mind.

840
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,581
Shall I go? You are not coming, right?

841
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,915
- No. - Ok, let's move.

842
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,248
- Malini...are you not coming? Come.
- No, you go.

843
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,582
Whenever I ride the boat, I remember movie
Titanic.

844
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,462
"Every night in my dreams..."

845
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,731
Jack, ride carefully.

846
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,396
Hi!

847
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,272
Ram,you didn't go?

848
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,743
Only till today you guys will be seen here.

849
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,412
I didn't want to miss that.

850
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,410
Tell the truth.

851
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,280
Shall I tell lies then?

852
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,274
I thought about you this morning.

853
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:31,578
What?

854
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,580
Ram going all over India driving a car!

855
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,916
I felt so jealous thinking of that!

856
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,427
There are problems in this also.

857
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,387
In one way, it's a sort of mirage

858
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,389
But still, it's a thrill!

859
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,895
If you need assistant please tell me.

860
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,564
I'll come. I've no work here!

861
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,402
Get involved in dancing then.

862
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,567
Only in her late 30's, Protima Bedi started
learning Kathak dance

863
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,910
For you,just a brush up will do, right?

864
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,740
I forgot that long ago.

865
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:01,914
Catch!

866
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,418
See!

867
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,914
Your hands reach where your eyes reach!

868
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,883
Now let your mind also reaches where your
hands reach!

869
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,557
Then, you can dance.

870
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,902
I should blame myself for bringing you here.

871
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,400
Several times I told you,
to carry necessary medicines during journey.

872
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,408
Building resorts in forests!

873
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,413
<i>Eden garden').!</i>

874
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,911
Can't you at least have a mobile towel'?

875
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,880
Salim, what shall we do now?

876
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,390
Isn't there any hospitals close by?

877
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,893
Need to travel 10 - 40 kms to the town.

878
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:48,688
Is the child that sick?

879
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,562
Getting fever occasionally is good for the body.

880
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:52,893
Don't annoy me needlessly.

881
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,561
Apply this as a medicine.

882
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,261
Fever will come down after a sleep.

883
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:58,905
Would it lead to any risk?

884
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,574
Don't worry! Child will become alright now.

885
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,741
It's because you played in water
this morning while boating.

886
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,419
Children tend to play in Water.
It's you who should take care

887
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,522
Couldn't you also join us in the boat?

888
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:16,587
<i>Fear'.</i>

889
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,589
You will reform only when you get rid of this
fear

890
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,097
Don't be silly, Elvis! You stopped her
from getting into the boat.

891
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,400
- Right! -Why needlessly blame"

892
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,561
Falling sick is not any one's crime!

893
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,404
If at all, these are not in our control, isn't it?

894
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,101
Nothing to worry, dear. Fever will go
away soon. You sleep.

895
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:40,910
Get away from there.

896
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:42,912
Move I say.

897
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,414
You sleep, dear.

898
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:49,923
Fever will go away soon.

899
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,125
Close your eyes and sleep.

900
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,946
Elvis asked me whetherl can deliver
vegetables home every month

901
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,617
He also wants to shoot a cinema in this
location!

902
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,783
He seems to be a person with mood-swings!

903
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,756
Nazini asked me for the prescription of the
medicine I gave the child.

904
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,725
Actually what happened you know?

905
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,126
Otherwise no need.
I will tell you next time we meet

906
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:43,701
Malini, be happy.

907
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:46,773
That's the difficulty.

908
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,138
Not at all.

909
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,953
Everybody can't become like you, Ram!

910
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,452
What am I doing?

911
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,623
Can live here like this.

912
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,754
Earlier I felt that I would have many people
connecting with my life.

913
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:04,931
Later only I understand.

914
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,596
Finding out at least one person
is the luckiest thing in life.

915
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:13,130
I wish".

916
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:14,941
...I disappear"

917
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:16,709
and remain here.

918
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,617
Malini, where is that bottle?

919
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,451
Nothing will be at its place.

920
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,934
Better come back soon.
I can't manage everything alone.

921
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,438
Guests are here.

922
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,437
Don't forget to get Feni from Goa.

923
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,445
Hi» young man!

924
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,717
You guys are about to leave?

925
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,246
- Good morning - Good morning.

926
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,928
Where all does this Car travel?

927
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,767
First to Coimbatore, Bangalore, Goa and keeps
on moving.

928
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,131
Shall I also come?

929
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,140
Come dear

930
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,138
I'm not coming.

931
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,276
Then?

932
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,142
We are going to Goa by Car

933
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,612
Don't act smart!

934
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,942
- Aadhi, come. - Hmm.

935
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:34,785
Would like to come, Assistant?

936
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,156
Plenty of work to do there.

937
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,927
Nobody is there for a help

938
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,598
Mother"

939
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:09,789
See you GUYS-

940
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:10,953
Bye. I shall give you a call

941
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,956
That fish name is not kanakunaji. I just lied.

942
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,153
Okay then, thanks for the visit.

943
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,187
- Safe journey! - I will write to you on reaching
there!

944
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,132
Here you've only that facility, right?

945
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,797
Don't know what time we would reach
if we start from this forest.

946
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,299
Terrible headache!

947
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,305
When I tell you to learn driving,
you can't do it, right?

948
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,704
Need to improve a little

949
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:20,860
You went only to build a forest, didn't you?

950
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,030
And not for acting in Fast and Furious, right?

951
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,297
I got acquainted with a motorist in Pune

952
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,862
- He only taught me! Should improve a bit more!
- What a Pity!

953
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,627
How are you Mr.Praneepmon?

954
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:30,370
Then"

955
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:31,705
<i>Here everything is ck.</i>

956
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,635
Weekends were fully reserved.

957
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,204
There were 2 College tour party.

958
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,879
One Bamboo rafting party created a minor
issue.

959
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,708
I resolved it stating some security reasons.

960
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,216
"How are you Mr.Praneepmon"
only means Are you fine?

961
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,381
Need not give the full progress report here!

962
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:49,656
No, I just said!

963
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:50,890
I also just said.

964
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,360
Oh! Come my darling!

965
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,062
Come my dolly!

966
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,356
Look at the happiness!

967
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,361
Something is there in her eyes!

968
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,367
Shall take you to the Doctor tomorrow

969
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,738
Don't whimper my dolly!

970
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:08,071
A Special news for you is..

971
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:10,740
You have a guest!

972
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:12,374
Who?

973
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,381
Some guests are like that..they keep waiting for
us.

974
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:16,746
You go and see.

975
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:26,611
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

976
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:57,083
What happened?

977
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,726
It was at Bangalore office ..
I saw Jasmine for the first time.

978
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:11,734
To see her always, I sought my transfer
to Bangalore from Bombay office.

979
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,368
Looks like quite familiar face! I will give"

980
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:16,910
Drink this.

981
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,374
Jasmine Jose? Won't caste be a problem?

982
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,078
I've no problem!

983
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,387
She was very special you know.

984
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,054
Her attitude..behaviour..

985
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:32,718
...Smile..

986
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,223
A very good smile!

987
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,728
I introduced the subject at home.

988
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,234
Did Madhavan uncle agree?

989
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,063
No.

990
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,071
So, I began to fast!

991
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,376
"A lion crouches to leap"
is just a saying that's used in Cinema!

992
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,247
That's Tiger, isn't it?

993
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,745
After 2 days of fasting,

994
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,376
I was in ICU.

995
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:58,915
What a pity!

996
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,382
My father,

997
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:01,816
and mother also agreed.

998
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:06,223
All of them went to Jasmine's house
at Pala with the proposal.

999
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:07,561
Then?

1000
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:15,225
But in front of all, she said "I'm just her friend

1001
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,072
and hardly has any marriage plans now"

1002
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,066
Which led my mother to ICU

1003
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:22,834
Seems she doesn't like my name.

1004
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,247
Shucks! Isn't Shatrughnan a good name?

1005
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,240
Even friends can call you Shatru(Enemy)!

1006
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,246
Even my little bro is mocking if there's any new
fast?

1007
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,249
Unable to stand there any longer, I came here!

1008
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,927
Everybody in my Bangalore office came to
know about this.

1009
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:41,551
I am not going back

1010
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,896
Till my last breath, I will live here as Raman
Part 2

1011
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,901
Shouldn't there be someone to look after this
after your period?

1012
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:52,898
You don't need?

1013
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,236
- That is right. - What is right?

1014
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,237
Thank you.

1015
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,084
Let's shoot a film like Pulimurugan

1016
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,582
If your next script is mine,
then I can sustain in this industry

1017
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,089
Won't you stand by me?

1018
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,921
Why another Pulimurugan?

1019
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,259
Wasn't that released already?

1020
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,826
Tell me your decision, Yes or No?

1021
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,394
This Cinema is not meant for all!

1022
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,265
Don't simply advise! Advises are free, right?

1023
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,100
Move Elvis! <i>I will</i> do.

1024
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,103
No need. At least today let me eat something
tasty

1025
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,104
Oh, as if!

1026
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,106
Carry on!

1027
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,415
Even to face Malini, I feel bad now!

1028
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:35,839
What for?

1029
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,949
How happy was it at your earlier house?

1030
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,413
I used to long to come and sit during evenings!

1031
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,420
Am I also not partly responsible for that loss?

1032
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,258
What is wrong with this flat?

1033
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,253
Forget that, come to the point.

1034
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,096
These impulsive film making decisions is what,

1035
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,595
moved you sell this place to Salim for building
flats.

1036
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,259
Want to lose this also?

1037
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:54,500
That is Cinema, isn't it?

1038
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:55,935
I will surely retrieve whatever I lost.

1039
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,103
One movie alone is enough

1040
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,601
Hmm, for making good all the losses.

1041
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,404
What about a historical film?

1042
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,503
Devotional subjects have good market
nowadays

1043
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,414
And no such films have been released of late.

1044
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,616
But cost will be high!

1045
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,410
Cost doesn't matter.

1046
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,282
Artist combination must be good.

1047
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,122
We could make with Seenasiam.

1048
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:16,346
Wasn't I who produced his first movie?

1049
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,523
He has a responsibility and obligation.

1050
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,256
With his current market, it's will not be difficult
to raise finances.

1051
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:21,594
We will shoot in Bangkok!

1052
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,396
I've been longing to go there!

1053
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,099
Be patient. Let me think over.

1054
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:27,396
How can I?

1055
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,601
If I don't have any current project,
I will lose this flat also.

1056
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:31,935
I may go to Jail also.

1057
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:36,272
What <i>,</i> dude?

1058
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,108
It's tension, buddy!

1059
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,418
Mother, I wish to learn classical dance.

1060
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,416
Why this sudden desire?

1061
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:51,520
Only Classical dancers are preferred for School
day program me.

1062
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,088
Then, don't participate! Dance is not that easy
to learn.

1063
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,094
Mother, I learnt already.
Shall I do one step and show you?

1064
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,265
Hmm..do.

1065
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,270
What the hell are you doing, Adi?

1066
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,929
Come here. Where did you learn this from?

1067
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,368
Come on, take half squat posture.

1068
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,598
<i>Straight.</i>

1069
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,405
and hands in this position. Concentrate!

1070
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,113
Come on, bend.

1071
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,275
Smile.

1072
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,947
Half squat - this Posture

1073
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:21,588

<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1075
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:39,401
Go and sleep.

1076
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,604
Father, I wish to learn dance.

1077
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:42,609
Definitely.

1078
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,540
To teach dance,
who has better grace than your mother?

1079
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:46,541
You go and sleep.

1080
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,110
Sure?

1081
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,108
Yes

1082
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,414
- Good night. - Good night.

1083
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:53,779
No kisses today!

1084
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,622
She has different moods day by day.

1085
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:02,762
Come here.

1086
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,286
- What? - Nothing.

1087
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,265
Then,go

1088
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,106
Group message which I sent from
Eden Garden didn't get forwarded.

1089
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:18,441
Thank God!

1090
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,275
Only when I attended the Association meeting
today, I got relieved.

1091
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,614
The issues these technology creat!

1092
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,451
I'll not this touch whatsapp henceforth!

1093
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,118
- Sure? - Hmm!

1094
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,619
Shall I uninstall it?

1095
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,125
Do whatever you wish!

1096
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:39,132
What?

1097
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,165
That's"

1098
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,144
one of my friends.

1099
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,146
Don't take it so serious. Just for a joke.

1100
01:07:59,175 --> 01:07:59,812
Is this a joke?

1101
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,452
I swear on you Malini.

1102
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:06,524
Only messages and nothing else beyond that.

1103
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:07,794
Nothing else! Trust me.

1104
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:09,626
Come on, look at me.

1105
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:12,424
Look!

1106
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,129
While crying, you look very beautiful!

1107
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:16,298
Look at m e.

1108
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,132
Come closer

1109
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:20,636
Come!

1110
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:22,809
Don't get aHQFV-

1111
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,819
"I Love you Jasmine"

1112
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,289
Oh God! No blood.

1113
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,138
Oh no!

1114
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,307
What happened? Sound of coconuts falling?

1115
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,151
Fasten this devil somewhere!
How many times have I told you guys?

1116
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,445
-Isn't it a poor animal? - What poor?

1117
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:09,155
Hey Noble!

1118
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,421
Is this the ideal name for a horse?

1119
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,123
Eat..Come with me.

1120
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,625
- Go..Go. - Get lost!

1121
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,134
Oh God! Blood!

1122
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,427
Letter to Jasmine!

1123
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,433
I spoke to her over phone yesterday.

1124
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,306
I can't live without her.

1125
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:30,435
What's all this?
Love letters in blood are all movie stuff!

1126
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,573
If you'd hinted earlier,
chicken's blood was avaialble.

1127
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,745
We had chicken for our lunch.

1128
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,442
<i>I will</i> write to her...
I will write till the last drop of my blood.

1129
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,381
Besides, <i>I will</i> publish it in gazette
and amend my name as well.

1130
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,953
<i>What damn names are these'.
Rama“, Shatrughnan'.!</i>

1131
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:42,948
<i>Is it any Ramayana?</i>

1132
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,791
Our family has gone insane!

1133
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,788
That is true!

1134
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:46,959
Hey you!

1135
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,559
I spoke to Madhavan Uncle. Go home hopefully.

1136
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,799
They will never talk a word of Jasmine!

1137
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,296
Madhavan uncle has promised me.

1138
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,796
Who needs his words?

1139
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,565
And you don't talk much!

1140
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:00,807
Expecting whom did you knock the door the
other day?

1141
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:01,967
Malini, isn't it?

1142
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,804
Isn't she married? Doesn't she have a child?

1143
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,978
Aren't you ashamed?

1144
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,639
Doesn't matter! That is Love.

1145
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:10,976
I want Jasmine.

1146
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:12,982
I will make her fall for me.

1147
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,455
Still, what is the need of wasting blood?

1148
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,817
Can't you send emails?

1149
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,457
Can I send email with blood?

1150
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,819
- That.. - Not possible, isn't it?

1151
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,393
She won't fall for it.

1152
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:25,293
So I'm planning something new like this.

1153
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:25,961
<i>New'?</i>

1154
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,392
At this very moment, when you saw all this,

1155
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,796
didn't you feel like seeing Malini?

1156
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,629
Didn't you? Right?

1157
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,468
Carry on writing!

1158
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:34,970
That's it!

1159
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,469
- Then.. -What?

1160
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:40,314
Writing in blood was outdated
during Dushyanta's period itself!

1161
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:41,306
Doesn't m atter!

1162
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,477
This horse is worse than my father!

1163
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,557
Only if I have 3 programmes minimum,
I travel to Kochi.

1164
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:52,450
Otherwise it will affect my health.

1165
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,457
But people like us don't have a choice!

1166
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,996
Since this place is free of pollution and
commotion,

1167
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:01,391
I designed this project.

1168
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,332
That's why I thought of experimenting
your Eden Resort technique here.

1169
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,466
Here residents interest is most decisive!

1170
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:12,477
How many Villa owners will approve of setting
up a forest instead of Children's play area?

1171
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:13,573
We will see!

1172
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,475
It will all depend upon the response
in today's Association Meeting today,

1173
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,015
Planning to shoot a portion of Elvis's film there.

1174
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,319
We need to discuss that also.

1175
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,987
Would he change my Eden resort location?

1176
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,715
Elvis is always like that.

1177
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,656
Hope he thrives!

1178
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,656
His life is full of problems!

1179
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,000
This Cinema itself is a risky business.

1180
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,332
Will the meeting start at the right time?

1181
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,672
I need to reach the Collectorate at 2 A60 clock

1182
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,474
If it doesn't get over, you leave! I will take care

1183
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,404
Other than today's meeting and Collectorate

1184
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:44,669
What is your 3rd programme?

1185
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,476
Want to meet a friend!

1186
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,015
ComeAdi! Bus will reach now.

1187
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,353
Mother, quick.

1188
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:55,685
Coming dear!

1189
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,353
I'm fed up of this girl!

1190
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,456
If bus goes, then you will have to drop me at
school

1191
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,321
I'm coming.

1192
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,663
- Mother! - Hmm!

1193
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,999
However much I tell you, you never get up
early!

1194
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,460
L..will come there this morning.

1195
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,463
This time we have to manage the budget
carefully

1196
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,668
Small crew is enough to Bangkok!

1197
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,838
Malini, is there no chutney powder?

1198
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:20,339
I was telling here.

1199
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:26,349
Let us first visit there. Then attend the rest.

1200
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,488
No...don't do anything until we are back.

1201
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,454
I'm leaving.

1202
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,475
It's date for paying Adi's quarterly fees.

1203
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,844
If not paid, then name will appear
on the notice board.

1204
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,345
For the time being, borrow from Nazni and pay.

1205
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,677
I will settle it with Salim.

1206
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,853
How long can we trouble her like this?

1207
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:02,151
Let this movie be out, everything will change.

1208
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,780
You remember this face?

1209
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,785
Varmaji, what a surprise!

1210
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,493
Didn't you order fresh vegetables
from Eden garden every month?

1211
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,821
And here is this month's delivery!

1212
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:43,994
Please come.

1213
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:46,996
Put you in trouble, right?

1214
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,497
Doesn't m atter!

1215
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,499
In fact Elvis just told it for fun!

1216
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,501
But Raman took it seriously.

1217
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,674
And I want this basket back.

1218
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,008
How much is the payment?

1219
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,008
- Raman will collect it from Elvis. - That's.

1220
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,181
Make it fast. I need to go to couple of places

1221
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,673
- Just a minute! - Sure!

1222
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:05,851
Oh boat!

1223
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,705
Haven't you yet put on your dancing anklets?

1224
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,199
You should convey that glad news
to me next month!

1225
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,200
I'm waiting.

1226
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,496
Shall I get a cup of tea?

1227
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,033
No, thanks. Basket is enough.

1228
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:59,502
The flat I lived in Dubai was smaller than this.

1229
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,866
We were 8 of us.

1230
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,607
There was a note inside this.

1231
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,605
Oh that! It's still there.

1232
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,506
No, it's a reply to that note.
Give it to your tribal man!

1233
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,517
- We shall meet again on 1st of next month.- Ok

1234
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,285
And please change your security person

1235
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,883
He never stopped me from entering!

1236
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,056
If it was some big thief"

1237
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,226
- They're not very strict here! - Then, ok.

1238
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,025
I want to go to Lulu mall urgently.

1239
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,593
Any purchase?

1240
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,719
Nothing specific. Just bird watch like others!

1241
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,028
Only this much is there for us.

1242
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:30,195
Lulu Mall..Lulu Mall..Lulu Mall.

1244
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,693
I lost complete touch! I must start from scratch!

1245
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,205
It's simply superb!

1246
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,038
Aadhi, you learn dance from your mother!

1247
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,334
I also want to learn dance from Malini aunty.

1248
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:45,211
- You also wish to learn? - Hmm!

1249
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,203
But listen to whatever aunty says.

1250
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:50,213
She will listen. You come dear.

1251
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:54,217
Having such a big talent and you were
staying quiet for these many years?

1252
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,881
Shouldn't Elvis agree?

1253
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,724
Elvis will agree.

1254
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:00,856
Shall I tell an idea?

1255
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:04,030
Many children in this flat
will be interested in learning dance.

1256
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:07,860
Because of pick up, drop and timing problem,
many would've given up.

1257
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:11,864
Why don't we set up a dance class in common
space?

1258
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,036
I will get you the children.

1259
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,041
Teaching dance for money?! Not necessary.

1260
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,377
Why Elvis?

1261
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,312
More than the money, it'll be helpful for children

1262
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,047
Just a small fees!

1263
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,876
Teaching free is not as worth as a dime!

1264
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,220
Why can't she teach inside this flat?

1265
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,618
No space here for that!
There's nothing to feel shame about it.

1266
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:35,360
We are teaching the art what
we learned, that's all

1267
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:36,721
Do you wish?

1268
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:43,228
Father, please...Yes..

1269
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:45,363
Go ahead then! Why lack in that?

1270
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,376
I've started imagining about wearing anklets!

1271
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,220
How far is the Mobile tower work in Eden
Resort?

1272
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:07,726
I suggested this idea

1273
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,226
and you got a reply to your 1st letter itself.

1274
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:15,360
Writing letters to Jasmine, only my blood got
wasted!

1275
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,371
Why going round about?

1276
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,240
I will get you her phone number.

1277
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,068
Does that have such a pleasure?

1278
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,073
Pleasure!

1279
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,073
Have you seen Elvis's hands?

1280
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:28,380
- Caught! -What?

1281
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:29,809
Did not bite!

1282
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:34,383
Shathru, these days fishes don't look at
the bait, they look at the angler"

1283
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:35,250
I know.

1284
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,753
Do cycling for sometime?

1285
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:44,363
Fishing hook!

1286
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,364
I don't want.

1287
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:46,732

- More than 50 students now - Great!

1316
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,543
Thinking of starting a new dance form there.
Any suggestions?

1317
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,614
Kochi have lots of scope for these three,
Hip Hop, Zumba, Free style

1318

There is a magic in Eden Garden!

1319

Coming in with worries and going back with
happiness!

1320
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:17,431
Are you guys getting married in America?

1321
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:22,335
Jasmine says I shouldn't say a word
about marriage now.

1322
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:25,635
For the time being, both of us are flying to New
Yolk for an onsite assignment.

1323
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,638
I'm lucky at least that happened!

1324
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,451
After reaching there,
we can try to understand each other more.

1325
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,346
You know, be with each other more.

1326
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,446
After that... marriage!

1327
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,351
In short, a hen peeked husband!

1328
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,324
For his baldness and envy,
no medicine has yet been discovered!

1329
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,127
It's also my life time ambition
of becoming a hen peeked husband

01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:45,797
Really?

1331
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,803
You stop giving inspiration to Malini
and take some revolutionary step.

1332
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:52,638
Take me for instance!

1333
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:54,333
Do something.

1334
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,433
Go, save her, da!

1335
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,143
And lead a life of peace with her.

1336
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:02,815
You settle down there itself
and recoup all the blood you lost.

1337
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,146
I will surely return here

1338
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,144
The next vacation with Jasmine, for sure.

1339
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:09,347
<i>(M!</i>

1340
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,802
As thought about, finance couldn't be arranged.

1341
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,138
Do you need to pay advance to Zenith Xavier
the moment you land Bangkok?

1342
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:28,471
No, I'm worried about meeting expenses there.

1343
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,472
Isn't there a limit to adjust it with?

1344
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,339
We have sufficient amount to meet that!

1345
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:34,339
Where?

1346
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,475
Shall adjust it from dance school account.

1347
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,343
And Salimikka's rent,
we shall pay it together next month?

1348
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,452
Receiving good response for Zumba classes.

1349
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:47,156
Most probably <i>I will</i> have to
start a new batch next month.

1350
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:51,455
This movie will release!

1351
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:52,664
It will surely click!

1352
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,462
Go confidently, Elvis!

1353
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,466
Has the yellow bulbul returned?

1354
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:03,835
No, why?

1355
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:05,674
I just asked.

1356
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:11,480
That nest, Global..Pappu and Puppy
all come into my dreams occasionally.

1357
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,677
Why only in dream?

1358
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,350
Come for a visit and see them!

1359
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,858
It was last January that you all visited!

1360
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:21,353
It's almost a year.

1361
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,659
True! Time flies!

1362
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,825
January is the most beautiful season here.

1363
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,362
Any plans of visiting here..

1364
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,671
...like that 4 day vacation.

1365
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:34,765
What would you give me if I visit?

1366
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:37,775
If you come,

1367
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:43,373
then I'll keep the doors of Eden garden open
only for you, enough?

1368
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:45,676
Let me ask Elvis.

1369
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:49,388
I'm not sure if he has got any other plans!

1370
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,690
He will be returning from Bangkok tomorrow.

1371
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,190
I'll expect you all.

1372
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:12,769
Good morning, sir.

1373
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,179
- How was your journey? - Good!

1374
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,678
There is a letter for you!
Producer's Association I guess!

1375
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,846
The fund will be transferred this week itself!

1376
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,187
Oh, you reached!

1377
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:23,848
Trouble arrives the moment I stepped in.

1378
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:26,852
Producer Association!
2 settlements are pending for the last movie.

1379
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:28,184
What are you doing here?

1380
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,157
Association Meeting.

1381
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,823
Though good the flats are,

1382
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,757
Association People only consider
builders to be their foes!

1383
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,362
Well, how far are the things!

1384
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:37,159
About what?

1385
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,830
What happened to the purpose you left?

1386
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,832
If God wishes, I will begin the shooting in
December!

1387
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,472
Not about your Cinema, but the other thing?

1388
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,369
What?

1389
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,679
Were you in full control, buddy?

1390
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:48,608
On the first day, I was in full control.

1391
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,678
Second day?

1392
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:52,384
Third day?

1393
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,380
I lost my full control

1394
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,848
It was such a spot! You also visit!

1395
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,192
While leaving from here,
what all dialogues you delivered?

1396
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,451
"That Malini is a gift! I will never cheat her"

1397
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:03,461
Is this all a crime?

1398
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:04,993
An urge! Like drinking a juice!

1399
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:06,995
Anyway I will neither be visiting there again,

01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,833
nor carry a regret!

1401
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:09,831
Yes, Yes.

1402
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,469
Shall meet in the club this evening.

1403
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:12,831
- Got plenty of work to do. - No, I'm not coming.

1404
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,836
I'm dead-tired. Missed sleep for 3-4 days.
Shall meet later.

1405
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:16,466
Obviously!

1406
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:26,970
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1407
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,668
Did you come long time back?

1408
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:47,600
No.

1409
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:48,806
Is everything ok?

1410
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,375
Almost ok!

1411
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,674
Still having some confusion about the dates.

1412
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,675
It will not move unless that is resolved.

1413
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,381
Everything will go well!

1414
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:57,682
Shall I serve food?

1415
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:00,011
You don't like the food heated in the oven,

1416
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:01,386
that's why I came back home early.

1417
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:02,851
Sit here.

1418
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,853
No way. I got dance class at 3 A60 clock!

1419
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,855
After I pass the driving test next week,

1420
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,857
I can save the to and fro travelling expenses

1421
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,691
Tell me your Bangkok news!

1422
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,029
Nothing in particular! A boring place!

1423
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:15,792
I somehow spent my 4 days.

1424
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,031
I decided one thing! Wherever we go,
we must go together only.

1425
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,040
Then, why don't all of us go for a tour?

1426
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,048
Definitely! Where would you wish to visit?

1427
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:32,049
You Suggest!

1428
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:36,889
Why don't we visit Eden resort
that we visited last year?

1429
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,058
Lovely spot, isn't it? Aadhi will also enjoy.

1430
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,019
What to do in that remote area?

1431
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:42,019
We shall visit some other place.

1432
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:45,690
Do you wish to go?

1433
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:47,491
Only if you wish, Elvis!

1434
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,797
We'll go, then. It will be a change for you.

1435
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:51,700
Really?

1436
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:54,866
Why go to Dance school now?

1437
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:56,406
No, I must go.

1438
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,401
This is the problem with Malayali girls!

1439
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,511
No, I just joked.

1440
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:08,713
Yes!

1441
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:17,488
If there is no good rainfall this year,
we'll be in trouble

1442
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:18,492
Hmm,true!

1443
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,033
You watch! This year people will
sell gold and buy water!

1444
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:32,035
We are coming.

1445
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:37,041
As promised, won't the doors of Eden resort
be opened only for us?

1446
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,515
What if we buy a tank of water from next week?

1447
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:47,483
It will definitely rain.

1448
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:53,865
"O breeze wafting on the banks of Malini river"

1449
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,501
Not wind! Pray for rainfall!

1450
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,704
You water the plants.

1451
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,044
Where are you? I'm waiting out.

1452
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,707
I'm coming. You wait.

1453
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:32,033
<i>(M!</i>

1454
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,880
Jay is flying to Dubai tonight.

1455
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:44,413
So I was busy running in completing the
schedules!

1456
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:45,650
What happened to our movie?

1457
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:46,885
What did Zenith Xavier say?

1458
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:48,519
He is not picking up my call.

1459
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:52,656
Uday.. Uday..Did you speak?

1460
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:53,654
I did!

1461
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:57,226
He doesn't wish to work with a producer
who has no financial stability

1462
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:00,024
Please try to explain my situation to him.

1463
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,528
It will work if you try.

1464
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:05,529
No!

1465
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,865
I'm not in such a dire situation to
fall at a star's feet and request for a movie!

1466
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:09,040
It's me who's in such a situation!

1467
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,835
I thought at least you would stand
by me in this dire situation!

1468
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,547
What more support do you need from me?

1469
01:31:14,735 --> 01:31:16,476
Nearly 100 producers were waiting in queue
here.

1470
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:19,709
Still I stood by you
for the last 6 months for this project.

1471
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:24,253
I know, dude! I can't sustain without a project.

1472
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:29,250
For the time being, I will arrange
some fund for you to roll!

1473
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:33,061
Don't connect Cinema with friendship and
upset me!

1474
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:34,892
You will not be able to understand my situation.

1475
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:37,226
Try to understand my situation too.

1476
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,738
I will call you, ok!

1477
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:55,753
Enough father.

1478
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:57,551
Get inside.

1479
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:58,252
Go

1480
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,260
All are kicking me away!

1481
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,055
No matter whoever opposes,
I will surely make this film.

1482
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:09,060
How Elvis?

1483
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,531
I'm leaving for Chennai tomorrow.

1484
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:13,269
Prakash has one subject.

1485
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:14,739
He himself will direct it.

1486
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,265
Won't that lead to more problems?

1487
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,270
You need not teach me Cinema. What
problems?

1488
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,844
I will be back only with a project!

1489
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,287
But we are going Eden Resort this weekend,
right?

1490
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,082
Is this very important for you?

1491
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:43,257
Let's not go this weekend..
I have a residential programme at School.

1492
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:44,634
What programme?

1493
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,064
You didn't inform me about this?

1494
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,539
Spelling Bee training!

1495
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,537
Teacher had noted it down in the Diary.

1496
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,270
What Diary? Whose Diary?

1497
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:55,270
Where does your mother has time to check
your diary?

1498
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,078
Only 'Dance' in your mothefs mind!

1499
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,545
I will be leaving for Chennai tomorrow morning.

1500
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:02,747
When both of you are away,
what will I do sitting here alone?

1501
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,350
Why don't you go to grandma's house?

1502
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,759
How long she has been calling you home?

1503
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:09,890
Do you want to go?

1504
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,893
Go then! Go wherever you wish to!

1505
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,258
When your husband is in big trouble,
a support from you...

1506
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:16,359
No way!!!

1507
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,070
What am I supposed to do?

1508
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:20,363
Do I need to come along with you to Chennai?

1509
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,364
I'll come.

1510
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,072
What for? To waste my money for your ticket!

1511
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,271
Marriage is the gravest mistake I did in my life.

1512
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:30,915
Can I correct that?

1513
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:51,737
Hello! What a surprise!

1514
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:55,271
When you said you won't be coming, we
thought our 4 days reservation has gone waste!

1515
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:58,373
Are your4 days reservation vital than us?

1516
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,277
There isn't any change here!

1517
01:34:01,769 --> 01:34:03,271
Changes are only for human beings!

1518
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,282
Where are others?

1519
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:09,088
Elvis is in Chennai and Adi in boarding.

1520
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,257
As I didn't want to get bored at home,
I left for grandma's house.

1521
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,314
- When I reached Kothamangalam,

1522
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,760
grandma had left for Velankanni
without informingl-Why so?

1523
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:18,362
- Grandma occasionally visits there. - Best!

1524
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,392
So, I thought of coming here.

1525
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:21,399
Good!

1526
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:23,258
Fate!

1527
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:25,062
Who are we to stop it?

1528
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:29,731
<i>I will</i> be returning today itself.

1529
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,075
I came to thank you.

1530
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,935
Only this much! You could've said that over
phone.

1531
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,677
You needn't have travelled all the way long.

1532
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:38,916
But I wished to visit here.

1533
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,380
Ok! You can have tea and leave. What do you
say?

1534
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,381
That's fine! <i>I will</i> make tea

1535
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,758
When will your grandma be back?

1536
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,754
Don't know! Whenever she feels like!

1537
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,329
Are you not happy on seeing me?

1538
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:54,928
- I do! - I don't see!

1539
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,270
- Are you going back today? - Yes

1540
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:01,773
Then quickly say thanks! Let it not become
dark!

1541
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:04,105
This is your major problem!

1542
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:06,107
Happiness will disappear when seeing you
directly.

1543
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,105
That is how it should be!

1544
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:14,119
I was afraid that I wouldn't be able
to manage the new dance school.

1545
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:15,286
But it's happening.

1546
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,122
You've many potential!

1547
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,286
The rat is still standing outside
the cave in fear, isn't it?

1548
01:35:23,784 --> 01:35:25,764
My confidence level has increased a little now!

1549
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,297
Hmm, little elegance has also increased.

1550
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:29,392
Really?

1551
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:33,100
Are you sure to go back today?

1552
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:40,404
No confusion! If you're happy to go,
then go or the othenlvise.

1553
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:47,410
Since you've come all the way,
attend our4 day crash course also and go.

1554
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:49,955
You can increase the confidence
and elegance a little more!

1555
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:51,386
Bluffing!

1556
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:58,291
But be rest assured! You will be safe here.

1557
01:35:58,986 --> 01:35:59,930

01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:08,552
"The story of the female country bird
which basked there in the sunlight?"

1572
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:15,984
"Does the forest have ears to heal"

1573
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:19,164
Booom!

1574
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:21,325
There you go!

1575
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:28,799
Good night!

1576
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:31,329
Hmm! Good night!

1577
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:50,753
Here hot pancakes and peas curry ready!

1578
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:52,653
Come and have it, da! You need to go, don't
you?

1579
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:58,322
Adi's programme will still take
3 more days to complete!

1580
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,456
Elvis is also at full swing in Chennai!

1581
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:02,463
I'm very hUFIQTV-

1582
01:41:10,597 --> 01:41:11,632
Won't you miss me?

1583
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:15,136
No.

1584
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:16,477
What for?

1585
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:22,780
You don't have something called feelings!

1586
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:27,819
4 days..that I got in my life.

1587
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:29,160
...is my privilege!

1588
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:30,457
<i>Right?</i>

1589
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:35,667
You'll be able to fly like the wind fully detached.

1590
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:41,468
Like the wind! That's good!

1591
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,478
Why do you need food?

1592
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:51,349
It's meant only for ordinary people like us.

1593
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:55,853
You have no heart!

1594
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:57,486
You have no emotions!

1595
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:05,761
I can only be like that, Malini!

1596
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:07,358
Because...

1597
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:10,367
Because, I can't have you.

1598
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:14,165
Am I not right?

1599
01:42:18,398 --> 01:42:19,672
You not only have Elvis and Adi there.

1600
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:23,375
You got plenty of things to do there on your
return.

1601
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,373
Dance School, Program mes".

1602
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:30,188
When you get exhausted running around,
Come here.

1603
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:32,682
I'll be here always.

1604
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,167
So, we shall meet next January

1605
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:51,371
Won't you come to my dance school before
that?

1606
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:54,474
Don't we need to set up a forest there?

1607
01:42:58,605 --> 01:42:59,379
Bye!

1608
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:11,362
The 360 days after that,

1609
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:14,165
were the anxious waits for those 4 days.

1611
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:32,475
Mother!

1612
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:38,185
- You had anything? -Yes.

1613
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,450
Oh, all of you are here!

1614
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:44,655
You behave as though
I'm suffering from some deadly disease!

1615
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:48,661
What a mess is this!

1616
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:51,593
Look at the condition of the house
when I was away for 4 days!

1617
01:43:51,858 --> 01:43:52,666
You go and sit!

1618
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:54,369
I'm alright!

1619
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:56,470
Sit there!

1620
01:44:15,382 --> 01:44:17,487
Ram! $0..

1621
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:19,488
Last time you didn't go and see grandma!

1622
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:21,491
Weren't you with him those 4 days?

1623
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:23,994
No, Elvis! Let me explain.

1624
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:27,664
Don't utter a word!

1625
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:31,009
Are you planning to meet him
in the pretext of dance programme?

1626
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:33,503
You thought I am a fool?

1627
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:34,845
Hey..What is this Elvis?

1628
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:35,604
Do you know who she is!

1629
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:36,847
Was it for this you called us here?

1630
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,516
I'll kill you!

1631
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,013
It's not as you imagine, Elvis!

1632
01:44:40,407 --> 01:44:41,010
Don't utter!

1633
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:43,385
What did you think of me?

1634
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:46,016
Call everybody! Let they know her character!

1635
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:49,853
Hereafter if you step into that Dance School..

1636
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:51,862
Come with me!

1637
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:54,692
When a misfortune struck me,
you went after someone, right?

1638
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:56,033
Are you truly a woman?

1639
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:57,599
What a mother is she!

1640
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:58,869
Come Elvis! It's not an ideal time to talk.

1641
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:00,504
I will not spare you both!

1642
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:01,797
Come Elvis! Come with me I say!

1643
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:02,703
Move!

1644
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:14,385
Is there any truth in what he said?

1645
01:45:18,912 --> 01:45:20,482
Take my child away!

1646
01:45:22,049 --> 01:45:22,686
Please!

1647
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:31,699
Come dear!

1648
01:45:51,912 --> 01:45:52,481
Hello!

1649
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:53,618
Got discharged, ah!

1650
01:45:53,914 --> 01:45:54,722
How are you, now?

1651
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:56,386
Hello!

1652
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,493
What happened? Any problem?

1653
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,495
<i>I'm going-</i>

1654
01:47:05,185 --> 01:47:08,826
Some day or the other Adi will understand
why I did like this!

1655
01:47:10,023 --> 01:47:13,835
For Elvis, I was only a Credit Card for along
time!

1656
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:15,706
I'm keeping it here.

1657
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:33,850
Where is she?

1658
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:34,923
What happened, Elvis?

1659
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:37,195
How dare you snatch away someone's wife?

1660
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:38,529
Where is she?

1661
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:47,864
Malini is not here, Elvis!

1662
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:49,540
Then, where is she?

1663
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,532
Malini must be at the place
where she likes the most!

1664
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:55,873
I'm living here because I like this life most!

1665
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,711
Elvis, even you do what you like, don't you?

1666
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:00,843
Doesn't Malini have that right?

1667
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:06,187
If Malini wishes to come here,
I will be the happiest person

1668
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:08,522
But Malini is not of that sort!

1669
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:12,530
Yourtragedy is that you didn't understand that!

1670
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:16,530
I never touched Malini!

1671
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:18,027
That is your issue, right?

1672
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:19,930
Only my dog will believe it!

1673
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:27,040
As many women have come and gone in
your life you are not able to digest!

1674
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:31,048
Even othenivise, what you're
imagining is utter nonsense!

1675
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:33,745
For these many years, being a good wife to you

1676
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:35,743
...a good mother to your child,

1677
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:38,219
and tolerating all yourtortures,
she lived with you.

1678
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:41,858
When there was a silly lapse
from her side which you didn't like,

1679
01:48:42,048 --> 01:48:44,187
you were not able to tolerate it!

1680
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:48,858
Malini didn't want to come here
keeping you away, Elvis!

1681
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:51,201
If she'd intended, she could've
done that long time ago.

1682
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:14,753
Here!

<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1684
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:44,351
Came to meet Salimikka!

1685
01:49:44,778 --> 01:49:46,348
Eden Resort plan has flopped here.

1686
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:49,356
Big shopping I guess!

1687
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,728
This is my new house.

1688
01:49:51,985 --> 01:49:53,362
Need to set up one by one.

1689
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:56,723
What are your other program mes?

1690
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:59,731
You used to visit Kochi only if
you have minimum 3 programmes.

1691
01:50:00,994 --> 01:50:02,029
I came only to see you.

1692
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:03,871
I'm good.

1693
01:50:05,398 --> 01:50:06,376
Even if you were not there, Ram

1694
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:10,043
I and Elvis would have had other issues.
That's all!

1695
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:11,374
Don't be tensed thinking about that!

1696
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:14,046
- Good morning, ma'am! - Morning!

1697
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:15,878
- Class will begin shortly! - Ok!

1698
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:20,854
Where is Aadhi?

1699
01:50:22,749 --> 01:50:24,023
She is with Elvis!

1700
01:50:24,985 --> 01:50:26,020
It's been 2 weeks since I saw her.

1701
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:32,369
You can call me any time, Malini.

1702
01:50:34,894 --> 01:50:35,736
You came Ram!

1703
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:36,870
That is enough for me!

1704
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:40,176
Where are you going now?

1705
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:43,043
Straight to Eden resort!

1706
01:50:56,783 --> 01:50:57,887
You owe me something, Ram!

1707
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:02,062
My 4 days in Eden resort!

1708
01:51:03,089 --> 01:51:04,397
Reserve that for me!

1709
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:49,910
Don't imagine things!

1710
01:51:50,804 --> 01:51:52,181
Go and meet Elvis.

1711
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:53,918
I will also come with you!

1712
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:56,079
Mistake is in your part also.

1713
01:51:56,443 --> 01:51:58,252
Even now, no one is aware of the happenings.

1714
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:00,757
If I do that,

1715
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:02,749
will things return to normalcy!

1716
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:07,390
Nevertheless, how was our past life?

1717
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:12,760
If we women think like this, then there won't be
any family left behind in this world.

1718
01:52:13,093 --> 01:52:14,793
Take our life for instance.

1719
01:52:14,794 --> 01:52:16,967
Ikka only calls me donkey and nothing else!

1720
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:19,243
Can I stay away from my family for this?

1721
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,246
Even while addressing you like that,
Salimikka gives you some respect

1722
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:28,911
Seeing your life, I've felt jealous many times.

1723
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,391
Nothing more left to resolve in our case!

1724
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:35,893
What nonsense are you talking?

1725
01:52:36,082 --> 01:52:38,392
Elvis is very aflélfy!

1726
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:41,086
He insists that he will not show Adi to you!

1727
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:43,761
I'm afraid whether he would come here
and create a scene

1728
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:47,067
Don't get afraid! There will be a solution to it!

1729
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:48,402
How?

1730
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:51,404
It's time for my class.

1731
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:00,881
What I say is,

1732
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:03,884
You take over the plumbing contracts
of my running projects.

1733
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:05,388
You've done Civil Engineering, right?

1734
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:06,790
At least there will be some income.

1735
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:08,885
No..It will not work.

1736
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:11,994
Why do you talk like that?

1737
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:13,390
Things should move on, isn't it?

1738
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,061
Is there any life without adjustment?

1739
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,066
Don't raise my temperament mentioning her
name.

1740
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,398
Let me see how long she can live alone like
this!

1741
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:25,409
She must fall at my feet! Only then she will
learn!

1742
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,779
Sir, a registered post for you!

1743
01:53:28,034 --> 01:53:29,069
I signed and accepted it.

1744
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,908
- Settlement issue might have become a case!
- Any trouble?

1745
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:33,910
Water supply still not resolved.

1746
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:36,087
Will be done, man! I've discussed in the last
meeting.

1747
01:53:49,255 --> 01:53:50,063
What dude?

1748
01:53:51,624 --> 01:53:52,398
What's it, dude?

1749
01:54:00,633 --> 01:54:02,408
- Divorce Notice? - Divorce?

1750
01:54:05,438 --> 01:54:07,611
What does Malini think?

1751
01:54:08,107 --> 01:54:12,249
Women started becoming bad ever since
Whatsapp and Facebook started!

1752
01:54:12,445 --> 01:54:13,924
In every family there is a problem!

1753
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:14,921
You please leave.

1754
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:16,422
Now I am wrong!

1755
01:54:25,124 --> 01:54:27,195
Ok, I will talk to him and give you a call.

1756
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:32,270
Our Advocate discussed this with Malini!

1757
01:54:32,465 --> 01:54:33,603
She is quite serious it seems!

1758
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:35,836
In this situation, if we take up the case,

1759
01:54:36,035 --> 01:54:38,447
case will be favourable to her
and get Adi under her custody.

1760
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:39,946
Firstly, she is the mother

1761
01:54:40,106 --> 01:54:41,915
And now, Malini is the earning member

1762
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:46,090
And also there are clauses that you shouldn't
trouble her at workspace!

1763
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:50,428
Still, from where did she get so much courage?

1764
01:54:51,284 --> 01:54:52,422
He is behind all this.

1765
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,257
Her plan is to marry him and live a happy life.

1766
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:58,431
I'm not able to bear it <i>,</i> dude.

1767
01:54:59,659 --> 01:55:02,640
I will not spare both of them alive.

1768
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,105
As you imagine, there is nothing between both
of them.

1769
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:07,204
Aren't I and Malini, good friends?

1770
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:08,945
Only that much!

1771
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,449
First give up your ego!

1772
01:55:13,306 --> 01:55:17,652
Awife, understands our limitation
and runs the family well - it is their ability!

1773
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:19,955
You only know if she goes away from you

1774
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:24,254
Elvis, even now the ball is in your court.

1775
01:55:26,019 --> 01:55:28,431
Situation will aggravate <i>as</i> it keeps moving.

1776
01:55:29,289 --> 01:55:31,929
Later don't regret!

1777
01:55:32,292 --> 01:55:33,270
It's my advice.

1778
01:55:34,294 --> 01:55:35,272
Hi, Salim uncle!

1779
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:37,937
Has the School left early today

1780
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:39,439
No! It's on time!

1781
01:55:40,133 --> 01:55:41,133
Had your food, deal'?

1782
01:55:41,134 --> 01:55:42,943
No, I used to have lunch at home only.

1783
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:44,447
Lunch?

1784
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:45,445
There is nothing at home!

1785
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:48,946
- We will go out and eat - Hmm.

1786
01:55:49,475 --> 01:55:50,419
You go with Uncle, dear.

1787
01:55:50,677 --> 01:55:54,648
Tomorrow is the last date
for paying Spelling Bee fees! Don't forget.

1788
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:58,450
It will be done. Come.

1789
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:00,624
- Preparations for flying to Singapore is over'?
- Hmm.

1790
01:56:01,054 --> 01:56:02,431
Do you wish to eat Pathri and Meat
or go to Pizza hut?

1791
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:18,206
Is there pain, madam?

1792
01:56:20,673 --> 01:56:22,744
I'd been longing for a Tattoo!

1793
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:25,248
Then, don't delay it. Try now

1794
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:27,015
Let me come back from Dubai programme.

1795
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,760
I also wish to send a divorce notice
like the way you sent!

1796
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:33,229
Marriage is the gravest mistake you did, Madam

1797
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:35,428
Mother!

1798
01:56:38,658 --> 01:56:40,433
Father allowed me to go to Dance class.

1799
01:56:44,297 --> 01:56:45,776
It's not a mistake, Uma

1800
01:56:48,301 --> 01:56:49,439
That's why I got her!

1801
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:51,239
Why aren't you coming home, mother'?

1802
01:56:53,139 --> 01:56:54,447
Am I not here?

1803
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:56,643
You can come here whenever you wish!

1804
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,448
Then what?

1805
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:05,146
<i>www.desireleasers.com</i>

1806
01:57:25,671 --> 01:57:27,776
What all nonsense you stated in this!

1807
01:57:29,308 --> 01:57:32,653
If you'd wished for this,
I would've arranged a good lawyer for this!

1808
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,461
You have no brains at all

1809
01:57:37,683 --> 01:57:38,127
Here!

1810
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:44,297
I am ready to forgive and forget the past.

1811
01:57:46,325 --> 01:57:48,635
You lead a restrained life like earlier.

1812
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:51,141
What is that? Tattoo!

1813
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:57,139
Upto 6'0 clock is Adi's class, right?

1814
01:57:57,503 --> 01:57:58,311
<i>I will</i> come and pick

1815
01:57:58,671 --> 01:57:59,649
You should also come.

1816
01:58:01,474 --> 01:58:02,782
Why did you say that you've forgiven me?

1817
01:58:03,876 --> 01:58:05,116
I don't understand that.

1818
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,460
If that is the case, shouldn't I also
forgive you, Elvis?

1819
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:11,452
Haven't you done wrong towards me?

1820
01:58:11,818 --> 01:58:12,796
Isn't that important?

1821
01:58:13,486 --> 01:58:14,464
Hmm, that is my nature!

1822
01:58:15,488 --> 01:58:18,298
A good wife must be a wife who
understands her husband

1823
01:58:20,326 --> 01:58:22,670
Didn't I live like that for the last 12 years?

1824
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:24,668
Apart from Elvis's desires,

1825
01:58:24,831 --> 01:58:26,674
Have I ever given importance to mine?

1826
01:58:28,901 --> 01:58:30,471
Have you ever given a rethought,

1827
01:58:31,504 --> 01:58:35,680
In between these years, have you ever
sacrificed any of your desires for me?

1828
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:41,119
Oh! So you plan to continue like this, don't
you?

1829
01:58:43,149 --> 01:58:44,787
Don't I also have Self-respect?

1830
01:58:45,885 --> 01:58:47,455
If I come back home now,

1831
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:51,464
our resentment towards each other
will only increase!

1832
01:58:51,691 --> 01:58:53,466
You've gone crazy with feminism!

1833
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:56,466
The only compatibility issue
that could arise between us ..

1834
01:58:56,696 --> 01:58:57,697
...is this height difference.

1835
01:58:57,897 --> 01:58:59,137
Is that a big issue?

1836
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,808
Aren'tAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri like
that?

1837
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:02,805
There are many like that!

1838
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:04,815
Aren't they living happily?

1839
01:59:06,506 --> 01:59:07,712
You will regret, Malini.

1840
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:08,817
Think aboutAadhi!

1841
01:59:09,709 --> 01:59:11,450
I've taken this decision only for her.

1842
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:14,785
In that flat, for her to see and grow,

1843
01:59:15,314 --> 01:59:17,453
have we ever made a good family till now?

1844
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:21,457
From now on, for her sake,

1845
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:23,667
we can create two beautiful world

1846
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:25,301
<i>I will</i> make one from here

1847
01:59:25,691 --> 01:59:26,669
and the other one is your's, Elvis!

1848
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:31,470
Obstinacy towards me will only benefit you!

1849
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:38,474
It took lot of time for me to reach
this state of mind.

1850
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:41,679
I can't go backward now.

1851
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:44,681
All the best!

1852
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:18,686
When I'd taken that decision also,

1853
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:20,649
It was fully dark around

1854
02:00:21,681 --> 02:00:25,288
Then, gradually, that darkness
turned more and more beautiful!

1855
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:29,956
Fear slowly transformed into courage and
excitement!

1856
02:00:33,693 --> 02:00:35,468
Why did you travel by flight to Delhi this time?

1857
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:37,467
Got tired of long drives!

1858
02:00:37,697 --> 02:00:38,801
Don't I need some change?

1859
02:00:38,998 --> 02:00:40,272
But I becamejust opposite

1860
02:00:40,499 --> 02:00:43,001
when I drove car after the accident,
I initially had fear.

1861
02:00:43,002 --> 02:00:43,980
<i>New I'm ck.</i>

1862
02:00:45,705 --> 02:00:48,686
What do Global, Pappu <i>,</i> Pappi, Yellow Bulbul
say?

1863
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:49,817
All are fine.

1864
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,685
I occasionally think of visiting there.

1865
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,482
But this run never ends

1866
02:00:55,715 --> 02:00:56,693
Greedy about life?

1867
02:00:57,016 --> 02:00:57,494
No.

1868
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:58,987
Happy about life!

1869
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,498
Do you meet Elvis?

1870
02:01:03,356 --> 02:01:03,834
Occasionally!

1871
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:05,498
He is doing good.

1872
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:07,667
Sometimes I used to feel

1873
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:09,836
the biggest reason of me being in this position

1874
02:01:10,029 --> 02:01:10,837
is Elvis only

1875
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:12,001
Certainly!

1876
02:01:13,032 --> 02:01:14,841
People come and depart for a reason.

1877
02:01:28,514 --> 02:01:30,015
If today's meeting is successful,

1878
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:32,326
then here comes the 1st Eden Resort in Kerala.

1879
02:01:33,519 --> 02:01:33,997
Good luck!

1880
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,489
Thank you..

1881
02:01:36,355 --> 02:01:36,992
...for the ride.

1882
02:01:37,523 --> 02:01:39,264
I saved taxi fare to Airport!

1883
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:43,507
I need to pick up Adi from School

1884
02:01:43,863 --> 02:01:45,342
She is with me for this weekend.

1885
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:46,843
See you then!

1886
02:01:47,733 --> 02:01:48,336
See you.

1887
02:01:49,035 --> 02:01:49,706
Bye!
