167
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,060

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,780
These two will talk separatelyOh god!

249
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,540
Oh my god! This fellow will ruin it.

250
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,300
Brother in law, waitWhat?

251
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,220
First listen to what she says. Give an advice if you can.

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,180
But do not get into family topic and takeclasses saying family is divine and so on

253
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,660
Talk a bit romantic brother in law

254
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,430
You are underestimating meI will chew it up

255
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,380
Keep watching..Have a blast!

256
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,970
As this is the first time, he is giving me tipsOh..

257
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,540
I enjoyed very less number of girls in my life.

258
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,900
No... Sorry,

259
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,450
I mean my experience with girls is less

260
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,630
Oh... What is this again?

261
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,300
I am saying frankly.The only girlfriend I have is my grandma

262
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,020
It is really a cute thing.

263
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,760
The relationship you share with grandma and your familyWow

264
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,100
Family? family...

265
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,900
He adjusted his tone.. it meanshe will now start the cow story

266
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I give utmost importance for family.

267
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,940
Family is an ocean of emotions.

268
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,360
A family means...Stop it man, stop it.

269
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,090
Why do you talk rubbish even after giving the notice?Disconnect the phone

270
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Oh sorry if I disturbed,Ok...

271
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,600
Only I am talking everything, you talk something too.

272
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,300
Else, it may become a mess- What?

273
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,660
I mean it may be an hour if I just go on talking

274
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,550
Actually I agreed due to the force at home,but I am still not prepared for the marriage

275
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,180
Is it not delayed already?

276
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,180
I mean, even for me

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,380
Otherwise.. what preparation do you need?Tell me, no problem

278
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,180
Travel for some time, understand each otherand then decide

279
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,380
Are we in teen age to travel?

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,700
I like you and you like me. Simple, it is done

281
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,820
Still, if you get into teen age dreams in this age,life will become a garage

282
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,380
What is this romance bro?

283
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,830
You touched the age topicwhich should not be touched at all

284
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,500
It is ruined, completely ruined

285
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,220
If it gets more delayed, they would call you an aunty

286
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,660
no one would call me an aunty

287
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,500
Aunty, uncle...They asked to give this sweet to you both

288
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,950
See, they are calling me too an unclewhen I am beside you

Please come

296
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,100
I liked her a lot dude.I was never so open with a girl.

297
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,340
The flow was not just normal

298
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,940
I too heard that dirty thingHave you?

299
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,700

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,420
What boy, is it ok?Ok

301
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,820
It is not ok for me

302
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,980
I hate Saffron colour very much

303
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,100
You take away your sweets

304
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,060
Not own house, but a rented house

305
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,020
I took so many precautionsfor you not to reject that girl

306
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,940
and you got rejected by her, crazy fellow

307
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,820
Your couple would have been very good brother

308
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,420
Is it?Yes.

309
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,420
The girl is very good son,we all liked her a lot

310
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,060
Is she not?

311
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,580
Poor girl, this fellow said she islooking like aunty and she felt very bad

312
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,580
Stop it.

313
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,220
I too liked her very much. I will say sorryto her and make her agree for marriage.

314

315
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,340
Move on

316
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,100
Hey, you think she would say ok if I say sorry

317
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Hey.. to pinch and pacify, to scoldand say sorry is the birth right of a man bro

318
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,100
She would say ok you goThank bro

319
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,300

I am extremely sorry Pushpa

329
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,900
I blabbered something not knowing what to talk

330
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,780
Even my family shunted me badlysaying it was my mistake

331
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,660
You were correct.

332
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,180
We think a lot even to sip a cup of coffee with someone

333
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,460
And this is life and we should be that careful

334
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,460
Actually Pushpa, I liked your travel concept a lot

335
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,500
If you are ok, we will start our travel with a cup of coffee

336
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,580
It is not possible

337
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:20,420
Hey, not possible means not possible now.It is ok after one hour

338
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,220
Pushpa, I will ask you a puzzle.Will you solve it?

339
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,940
Ask me

340
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,700
What do you call a laughing Muslim?

341
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,580
What do they say?

342
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,340
You cannot say it right?

343
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,780
Ismail

344
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,820
Huh, he started

345
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,540
Very bad joke

346
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,100
Yes, very badThank God, you smiled

347
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,220
Bro-in-law is tickling her

348
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,660
I am thinking to tell something to you since long

349
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,500
What is it?

350
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,680
Wow, what was that Salsa dance inside?

351
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,740
It is not Salsa dance..It is Western dance

352
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,540
Whatever

353
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,480
Still, I felt you were ok seeing in saribut you were so hot in modern dress

354
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,490
By hot... I mean

355
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,940
No problem, you can say. I am hot

356
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,980
Not just hot, super hot.

357
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,740
Still when observed, there are a lot of"the best" things in you

358
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,100
Your height is an advantagealong with your grace.

359
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,220
Physique flexible, face fantastic, eyes attractive,

360
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,660
smile sensuous,

361
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,020
on the whole...you are the statue of Liberty

362
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,940
What is statue of Liberty?

363
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,860

She enjoyed 29 minutes of our 30 minutes meet.

401
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,900
It got reversed just in the last minute.

402
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,400
She should this time get flat for my sorry.

403
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,730

You wrapped me with your looksand made me fall for your smiles

443
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,590
You trapped me with your words

444
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,630
Hey Pushpa, you are a cutie pie

445
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,790
It is a storm if you touch

446
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:09,710
Being stubborn, coming over me,you make me lose my tradition

447
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:15,190
It is a sin, what rights do you have on me?

448
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,830
Hey Pushpa, I became a slave to you

449
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,030
Do not raise the lust on you

450
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,030

00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,870

00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,950
I will come crossing over the sky

465
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:11,590
Like a kite and a rocketas you became the base

466
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:17,030
A thread and what is your right on me?

467

Bro, bro... What Bro?

The girl who split with you on the roadhas directly come to your room?

478
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,850
What a magic bro?

479
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,250
I mean, just beforeJust before

480
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,830
I told you she dashed a carYes, you did

481
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,270
I sent that car owner to the house of Pushpa

482
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,520
What do you need sir?I need justice

483
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,430
Who is Pushpa here?

484
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,950
It is me and who are you?

485
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,680
What a worst driver you must be tohave dashed the car which was parked

486
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,360
Oh, is it yours? Sorry

487
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,750
You dash without any senseand is it ok if you say sorry?

488
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,350
Hey, mind your wordsDo not talk

489
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,930
If my personality had cooperated,I would have killed you by now and become a criminal

490
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,150
Hey, I will break your finger

491
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,750
That was a car bought saving everypenny of my hard earned money

492
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,270
Do not talk too much and say how much doyou need and I will give it

493
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,550
Ten thousand cash and half an hour of mental torture

494
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,550
Here...Take it

495
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,550
You gave the cash,but what about mental torture?

496
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,950
Huh, you...Here get it repaired

497
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,340
You dashed and again put a slip sayingit was you who did it?

498
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,670
She feels I am a short fellow socannot do anything

499
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,790
I knew that you would come

500
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,630
Is it a love letter?

501
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,930
You felt shy to say?

502
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,690
My foot idiot,why did you give my address to him?

503
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,950
You somehow dashed a new car.

504
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,400
That guilt would stay within you.

505
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,930
That guilt will be gone if a chance to correct is given, right?

506
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,690
My foot!

507
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,350
You know what all he said coming home?

508
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,030
Pushpa, cool

509
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,870
Though he did a mess in anger, someday he wouldrealize your greatness and bring you great recognition

510
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,790
No need

511
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,470
It is enough that I do not lose what I have

512
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,190
Thank God, I did not marryas you are good in height and weight.

513
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,630
My life would have been ruined.

514
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,870
If you messwith me again, I will give a Police complaint

515
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,790

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,110
How long would you be idle this way?

544
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,270
I cannot do it dad, I cannot do

545
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,270
Listen to me son

546
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,790
What Mr. Swamy, any problem?Hello sir

547
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
What can i say sir?

548
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,950
he is my son Sathya

549
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,750
Oh, hello SathyaHello sir

550
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,870
I saw him doing a protest at the beach

551
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,190
That is the problem with him sir

552
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,470
He is a gold medalist in MA Economics sir.

553
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,100
When asked to get into some job,

554
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,460
he is getting into protest and bringingall problems in the city over his head sir

555
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,270
Mr. Swamy, you go in and look into your work.I will talk to him.

556
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,630
Ok sirYou go

557
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,880
Sathya, it is good to help others.

558
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,540
But family should not suffer because of that.

559
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,980
Family comes first.

560
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,390
Why not listen to what dad says?

561
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,070
I respect the words of my father sir.

562
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,950
But thinking what is there in betweenfour walls is a family, that is different sir

563
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,110
This whole society is my family sir

564
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,420
By the way tomorrow evening at 5,

565
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,310

One Lakh likes...

570
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,590
Wow, you became a celebrity Swapna

571
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,190
Whatever people might think,but you are great

572
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,910
We all should see her and learn

573
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,030
What do you say Pushapa?

574
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,470
Yes.

575
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,670
I get the bill and she gets the fame?

576
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,270
She is giving build up like mother Teresadistributing rotten apples and used blankets.

577
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,550
I am unable to see.

578
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,550
Why is this fellow coming here?

579
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,550
My prestige would be ruinedif he opens his mouth

580
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,030
One minute, I will just be back

581
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,710
Why did you come?

582
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,350
I came here to say sorry madam

583
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,870
Today, a guy dashed my car at the same spotand left writing "do whatever you can"

584
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,310
I then understood

585
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,030
your greatness to have written tocome home and take money

586
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,470
People like you..Wait,

587
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,910
Not here, please come there andsay these words.

588
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,030
Please comeOk

589
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,710
Hey, he is Mr. Sudarshan.

590
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,710
Day before a small dash to his carSmall?

591
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,710
She took me home and gave 10000 rupeesas a there was a small scratch.

592
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,190
In these days when they give few fruits,upload photos in Face book and boast,

593
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,030
doing such a great job andhas not shared even with you means...

594
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,390
You are greater than the Face book madam

595
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,390
Why use such big words sir?

596
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,390
Cool breezes still exist inPondichery because of people like you

597
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,270
Your greatnessEnough now Sudarshan sir

598
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,750
Please do not stop me madam.

599
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,750
You, you, you and again you...

600
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,070
We all should learn from her.

601
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,670
Sudarshan sir, pleaseJust one more

602
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,990
By luck this coffee shop is mine

603
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,150
and if you give me the chance to pay this bill,my happiness grows by four more minutes

604
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,870
What do you say madam?

605
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,870
Ok Sudarshan sir, okThank you

606
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,130
Someday, he would get to know your greatnessand he would bring you a great recognition

607
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,760
What baby, came this way?

608
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,560
You offered me coffee the day before,so came to have it now

609
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,260
No chance dear, our idiot has got a great match.

610
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,770
We are going to see the girlhave it at your house for now

611
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,390
Where are your mom and dad?They are coming grandma

612
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,010
Bro, talk carefully with that girl this timeatleast and see that the wedding happens

613
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,630
Not ruining it like last time talking to Pushpa

614
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,620
Bro, Pushpa was like a practice match

615
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,230
The girl I am going to see now is the real tournament

616
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,550
I got a grip on pitch because of Pushpa.

617
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,220
See how I play now

618
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,840
Hey Pushpa, when did you come?

619
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,640
When you said I was a practice match

620
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,710
Pushpa, you said not to me and left asI do not know how to talk right?

621
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,780
Just forget it

622
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,750
Why did you come this way?

623
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,760
Will you come aside?

624
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,530
To a side?

625
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,240
Oh no,

626
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,660
While going to see a girl, going to a side withanother girl was never in my family tradition.

627
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,790
What do you say bro?Yes

628
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,710
It is wrong Pushpa, whatever you should talk right here

629
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,190
I am sorry, I talked a bit too much that day.

630
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,110
I came to say the same

631
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,190
Pushpa, should you come so far just for this? Take it easy.

632
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,110
Bye Pushpa

633
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,030
That girl would be waiting there.

634
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,570
Shall we go dude?Come on

635
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,950
Come on

636
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,310
Move, it is getting late

637
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,070
Oh no, it is not even four daysand he has already left to see another girl.

638
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,670
Why so much of urgency?

639
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,790
Is Sir unable to stay without a girl?Are his nerves getting cut?

640
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,550
We cannot control a man coming of ageand a barrage at the time of floods

641
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,550
We got to lift the gates

642
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,150
Whole man breed are slaves of a lady

643
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,900
It is like waking up and running for lady

644
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,750
Sudarshan

645
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,790
Do not use quotations whenyou do not know them correctly, please

646
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,910
You know how much did he overactwhen I asked him to come aside?

647
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,210
To a side? It is wrong

648
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,790
I asked that for talking sirand not to drown him in kisses

649
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,950
Then no problem

650
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,350
My stomach is burning from the morning

651
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,450
Hey, bring a puff and cool juice for the girl

652
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,070
Ok sir

653
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:25,710
Oh no Sudarshan, not because of food but with the feeling.

654
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,470
Please understand.Hey, Wait.

655
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,240
I understood dear. You forget him.

656
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,730
He is not correct for you.

657
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,760
Oh no Sudarshan, he isthe correct one for me.

658
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,080
I like that fellow Sudarshan

659
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,860
He talks straight but he is a good fellow

660
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,950
I should become both his practice and the tournament

661
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,150
Will you do one thing for me?

662
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,940
Shall I die for you dear?

663
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,480
Say the dialogue suitable for your personality, Sudarshan

664
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,950
Do what I say and that is enough

665
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,390
He is starting the bike. Follow him, do not leave him

666
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,180
Go on, go on

667
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,320
Go faster

668
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,410
Hey, look and drive

669
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,160
Damn it, where... Where is that fellow?

670
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,870
Go this way, this way

671
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,920
Where did he miss?Auto came in the middle bro

672
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,320
Brother, he is there

673
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,400
He is making too much mess

674
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,700
Bro, we shall finish him- Hey!

675
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,790
This is a public place, let us wait for the time and finish

676
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,010
Hi SathyaHi sir

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,560
Bro, he is the owner of Karthikeya Industries

679
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,210
All the fish are revolving around the nest. Come on

680
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,780
Sir..

681
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,760
Hello bro, hello

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,820
if you can please come for sure on 26th

685
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,370
Sure brother, 26th is a very important date right?

686
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,080
It is to you too right bro?

687
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,400
It seems new machinery is coming right?

688
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,310
All the best

689
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,070
See you... See you brother

690
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,520
It seems new machinery is coming right?

691
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,250
New machinery?

692
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,460
Why is this short fellow not coming still?

693
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,560
Oh my God!

694
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,570
What happened?

695
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,480
It seems he okayed that girl.

696
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,600
Name is Sandhya and dentist by profession.

697
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,500
The details are in this, have a look

698
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,270
You said you wanted to saya very important matter.

699
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,690
Regarding what?

700
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,350
About my cancelled wedding andyour wedding which is about to happen

701
00:40:59,600 --> 00:40:59,980
What?

702
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,070
What is the relation between your marriage and mine?

703
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,250
The bride groom is the same, Karthik

704
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,210
Huh? Karthikeya?

705
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,390
I mean, I know him as a lover of my friend

706
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,350
My friend broke up after three yearsand she married someone else and then left to US

707
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,700
I used to console him feeling pity as he was in pain

708
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,360
He took me for a trip saying one weekand got me committed in a weak moment.

709
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,230
We cannot control a man in moodand a barrage at the time of flood.

710
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,700
Gates should be opened

711
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,290
He made me believe that would marry me and

712
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,170
After a few days he said thathe did not have that intention

713
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,270
Then I came to know that he left my friend to catch me

714
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,490
and now to catch you, he left me

715
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,960
I do not have the intention to marry him

716
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,360
but I am wishing that the life of a girlshould not be ruined

717
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,650
I am saying in advance that you should notbe in a position to bow down your head like me

718
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,860
Excuse me, bill 300

719
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,520

720
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,360
Thank you madam

721
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,410
Hi Karthik

722
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,240
Hi

723
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,500
My friends are partying here- Oh..

724
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,860
I saw you and came here

725
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,770
When is your marriage?

726
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,980
It is cancelled

727
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,760
Is it cancelled?

728
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,420
Is it cancelled? Is it cancelled?

729
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,690
Shock.. could not withstand the shock and...

730
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,860
What happened Karthik?

731
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,680
Leave it Pushpa

732
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,450
Not this way..

733
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,110
What is this?

734
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,860
For the pain to flow out, this should go in

735
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:54,830
You say so?

736
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,950
Yes

737
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,950
Has it gone in?

738
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,850
Everything, total pain should come out. Come on

739
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,490
I booked even two business class ticketsto Switzerland for honeymoon

740
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,360
What, did you book right in this gap?

741
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,870
I mean, I am saying it is her bad luckto have missed out a guy like you

742
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,250
I will not let those tickets get wasted Karthik

743
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,710
I am there for you.

744
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:21,880
Do you understand?

745
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,310
I do not understand anything.

746
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,660
The day before you rejected,now Sandhya and then it was her.

747
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,850
Is there any reject board written here?

748
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,630
Any reject board here?

749
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,370
Forget about everything that is happened.

750
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:32,890
I am there for you

751
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,360
Did you understand what I said?

752
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,940
I completely understood now

753
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,940
Like an Abdul Kalam, like a Vajpayee

754
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,250
and like a John Jacob Paul- Who is that guy?

755
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,190
I will be a bachelor for lifelong.

756
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,980
What is them rejecting me? I am rejecting all the girls

757
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,190
Karthik listen to me.This is fix..

758
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,310
Fix... Fix

759
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,630
Fix.

760
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,320
Did he understand what I saidin this way?

761
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,630
Pushpa

762
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,850
Hello Pushpa..Yes, say

763
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,440
Did I over act in the night?

764
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,390
I do not remember at all about what happenedand how did I come home

765
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,320
Do you not rememberNo

766
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,890
You do not remember anything?Nothing

767
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,550
After doing everything,you you do not remember anything now?

768
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,670
Pushpa,

769
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,110
what have I done?

770
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,850
As a girl, I cannot say it out

771
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,120
Tell me what actually happened Pushpa?

772
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,950
Pushpa...

773
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,220
Pushpa...

774
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,590
Pushpa...

775
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,010
Pushpa...

776
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,760
Stop crying and say what happened Pushpa?I am dying in tension

777
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,030
You were in pain, right?- Ya..

778
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,910
I came to console you andSo...

779
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,290
YouMe?

780
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,950
Drank the full bottle, caught me tight and kissed me

781
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,560
Kiss and me?

782
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,350
Oh God

783
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,910
I am unable to believe itMe and kissing, Oh no

784
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,070
Even to hide it in the heart,this mistake would haunt lifelong

785
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,910
It is like cheating the guy I am going to marry, right?I just cannot believe

786
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,040
I just saw in films but what is me kissing?

787
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,100
How did i kiss, oh God? How, how Pushpa?

788
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:21,830
Like this

789
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,960
If it is like this, I may have kissed

790
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,850
What is my situation now?

791
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,130
Pushpa, I will marry you if you agree

792
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,770
No need, do not marry me showing pity?

793
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,180
What pity Pushpa, I like you very much.

794
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,340
It is my luck to get a girl like you

795
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,260
How do I make you believe, how do I convince? How, how?

796
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,480
You are my statue of Liberty, Pushpa

797
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:14,750
Oh my heart, I heard your music

798
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:22,110
Do you know, you are my first trance

799
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:29,830
Crossing your lips and ringing my heart,your smile entwined me

800
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:36,910
Crores of dreams about you cameto my eyes and you are my world

801
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,950
It is you, I too am you

802
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:51,030
Spread your hands and hug me my dear

803
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:58,230
Show me another world with no humans

804
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:05,310
Hold the lip and kiss me, my dear

805
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,110
Some fire ignited in my small life, how to stop it?

806
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,470
Some danger is hidden in your naughty look,how to stop?

807
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,310
You have a beauty as much as the sky

808
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,150
It is shaking me like the earth quake

809
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,510
It is pushing the distance away

810
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,800
It is pulling me sharply close

811
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,350
Tell me fast what am I to do now?

812
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:04,270
Spread your hands and hug me my dear

813
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:11,310
Show me another world with no humans

814
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:18,430
Hold the lip and kiss me, my dear

815
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,350
Pushpa, keys are inside. You be at the car

816
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:23,790
Ok

817
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,990
Pushpa,

818
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,510
Pushpa

819
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:34,780
Hi

820
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,270
I am unable to believe.

821
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,510
You felt so bad then and again with him now

822
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,870
You made me feel high in prideand are you bowing the head down?

823
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:45,790
Hey Sandhya

824
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,890
Even after knowing that he is a big cheater,what is this Pushpa?

825
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,080
Why am I cheater? What are you talking?

826
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:53,910
Shut up, I am not talking to you

827
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,470
It is not wrong to be cheated,

828
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,340
but believing that cheat again is wrong.

829
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:01,650
Think about it

830
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:04,970
What is she talking Pushpa?

831
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,620
She rejected me without any reasonand why is she calling me a cheater?

832
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,580
I am so sorry Karthik, I should tell you a fact.

833
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,660
He took me for a trip saying one week andmade me commit in a weak moment

834
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,960
We cannot stop a man in mood and a barrage in floods

835
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,380
He left my friend to catch me and now me to catch you

836
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,310
Oh my god!

837
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,100
so many lies and so many plans

838
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,290
What else should I do?

839
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,690
You said we shall travel.

840
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,550
Without even giving time to say thatI like you, you fixed Sandhya

841
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,390
Everything is fair in love and war

842
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:32,950
Shut up

843
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,630
You did not fool me but my family

844
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,630
When my dad went to their houseto ask why the match failed,

845
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,160
they insulted closing the door on his face

846
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,470
I am marrying for the happiness of my family.

847
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,610
Never again show your face in life

848
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:25,750
Hello

849
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,270
It not Selvam and he is not in town it seems.

850
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,270
Someone gave you wrong information

851
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,090
He hit my people and then took away the machinery

852
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,790
Being a police officer, you are believing the wordsof a rowdy sheeter without even enquiring

853
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,310
The guy to be in bind over is moving outside

854
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,890
You can solve the case exactly in two minutes,if you do the duty correctly

855
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,920
What, two minutes?

856
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,950
Will you solve in two minutes?

857
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,740
Not like that sir

858
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,570
Now, you are the CI

859
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,480
No, you think being a Police is a comedy?

860
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,460
Not like that sir

861
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,940
You said can solve right?Come, you are the CI today

862
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,070
You can solve it.

863
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,630
It seems would solve in two minutes

864
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,170
Please come sir

865
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,390
What CI sir,

866
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,780
why did you come this way?

867
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,970
Hey, I am not the CI today, it is him.

868
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:23,760
Oh!

869
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,380
It seems you took away his machinery.

870
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,900
It seems he would find out where it isand solve the case in two minutes.

871
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,330
CI sir, solve it

872
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,470
Hello CI sir,

873
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,920
public is talking all wrong about me

874
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,790
I am a good man sir,

875
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,800
I am saying the truth I have not done anything.

876
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,600
I am working very hard and doing duty sir.

877
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,430
There are many families believing in me Sir

878
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,110
Oh no, one minute is over sir.

879
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,040
Just one minute is left sir

880
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:52,360
Sir, do something sir.

881
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,720
Solve the case sir

882
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,540
Sir has no Police feel.

883
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:00,480
Sir, give the cap.

884
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,860
Give the belt sir

885
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,820
Hey, all of you look here.

886
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,980
Hey, I is me that hit your peopleand took away the machinery Lorries.

887
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,280
This is Selvam, original

888
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,420
Sir, I am frightened. Feel has come, superbly

889
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,010
Hey look, sir has got the feel.

890
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,210
Sir.. the feel has come sir

891
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:39,920
Will you hit now sir?

892
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,070
Sir, I am frightened.

893
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,310
Oh no...

894
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,550
Sir, it would get cut sir...

895
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,950
Hey car guys, new car

896
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,010
This is karthikeya, original

897
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,110
You took my materials, I left.

898
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,690
You would have taken my machineryand I would have left

899
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,710
You manhandled my people.

900
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,610
I would forgive a hundred times, if I get a loss

901
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:32,010
But if my people are into troubles,I will finish you rascal

902
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,660
Hey Aku Seenu,

903
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,460
you turned the board runninga Chit Fund Company in Nellore

904
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,330
You kidnapped kids in Vizag and looted money

905
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,390
Supplying drugs in Hyderabad, escaping from Police

906
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:17,030
and coming to Pondichery changing name as Selvamand if you talk in Tamil, you become a Tamilian?

907
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,740
If you fall in my eyes once again,you will be dead right there

908
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,050
My Lorries should cross me before I cross the gate

909
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,430
I will go to second thought if delayed even by a second.

910
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,200
Game over!

911
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,740
Brutal murder of popular social activist Satyadev

912
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,910
Solid information is that he was murderedby some unidentified yesterday night

913
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:14,870
Son of Our Swamy sir, dad

914
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,100
Commissioner stated to catch the murderer soon

915
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:36,960
Ok dear, bye

916
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,280

You know I went to the birthday partyof Varsha yesterday brother?

921
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,510
What is there to think in this, son?

922
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,700
She is an married girl

923
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,770
If we roam around the Police and courts,you would get into controversies.

924
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,350
Karthik, what mom said is correct

925
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,870
What do you think dear?

926
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,790
I will give the witness brother

927
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,390
Why would you give the witness?

928
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:37,150
You wait mom

00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,830

01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,830
Are you sure?

957
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,710
Sure sir

958
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,110
None from the suspect parade is identified

959
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,190
Then get the sketch done sir

960
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:26,880
Good idea,

961
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,790
but he would see your sister right?I will take care sir

962
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,510
Sit dear

963
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,150
Carry on sirOk

964
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,150

How do I draw the sketch when she is in mask sir?

967
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,990
It is not sketch of girl to draw.But sketch of whom the girl says

968
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,190
Say child

969
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,350
Sir, it is done sir

970
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,830
He is the one sir, he is the one

971
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,550
Are you sure?

972
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,900
Yes sir, I am sure. He is the one who killed

973
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,180
Good.

974
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,510
Ok, fine.

975
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:46,750
Hello...

976
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:54,560
Good morning sir

977
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,670
You fooled me right?

978
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:00,630
You should be ashamed of yourselfto have done so being a responsible citizen

979
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,390
What happened sir?

980
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,280
Is your sister thinking this as any time pass game?

981
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:07,190
She got the sketch of a guy dead beforefive years and says he killed

982
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,510
When she said friends, party and pub,

983
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,490
it should have struck me that she is givinga wrong statement being drunk

984
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,590
He is the one who killed brother,I saw and I can remember well

985
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,080
Hey, do not waste our time anymore

986
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,950
You kept so many conditions.

987
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:27,710
Thank God, I would have lost my prestigeif I had given that sketch to press

988
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,790
True brother, I sawCome on, do not talk any more

989
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,950
Sir, some mistake may have happenedNo more explanations

01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,230

Brother

994
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:43,470
It is him, who killed, brother

995
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,750

Is Irfan alive?

1007
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,990
Is he alive?

1008
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,950
Irfan?

1009
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,550

1010
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,470

01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,580
Is he alive?Yes, he is alive

1012
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,920
I am coming

1013
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,050
Sir, are you ok?

1014
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:12,950
Karthikeya...

1015
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,430
Karthikeya...

1016
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:34,690
Sir... Sir

1017
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,450
Alert everyone and ask all officers on leave to report.

1018
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,290
Just do it. It is an emergency, God damn it

1019
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,970
What happened sir, any threat?

1020
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,330
Karthikeya, you said to have done a mistake?

1021
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,770
Yes, that Karthikeya

1022
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:00,650
We sent him out from departmentfour years back telling a lie

1023
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,650
Now he came to know know about itand he is coming to bash us up

1024
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:07,090
He is the most reckless and dangerous fellowI have seen in my life

1025
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,170
He does not like to follow rules,does not listen to what senior officers say

1026
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,530
and never cares about life

1027
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,330
He never remembers that he has a family at all

1028
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,060
He is an unemotional creature

1029
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,760
Four years back exactly in the same way,

1030
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,990
I was in a situation whereI did not know what to do

1031
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,010
A gang with Mumbai mafia links kidnapped my daughter

1032
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:29,130
and demanded to releasea notorious criminal in our custody

1033
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,270
Fatima listen to me, nothing will happen to baby.

1034
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:43,940
Trust me

1035
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:45,910
I am the Commissioner of Police, God damn it.

1036
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:46,730
I will handle it

1037
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:49,510
Sir!Sir..

1038
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:50,850
What is the next step?

1039
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,050
Did you get any message from the kidnappers?

1040
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:54,650
I still did not get any call sir

1041
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:58,210
It is correct to handover Bhikshu to themand bring the girl sir

1042
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,730
Risk increases if it gets delayed

1043
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:00,780
I think he is right sir

1044
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,590
Do the arrangements to release Bhikshu.

1045
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,560
I will speak to the Minister

1046
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:06,370
Sir, kidnapper is on the line

1047
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:10,870
What Commissioner, what did you decide?

1048
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,020
We are releasing Bhikshu,say where should we come?

1049
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:14,800
Brother knows very well where to come

1050
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,210
But one condition,

1051
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,820
instead of your Police,send him accompanied with some kid

1052
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,800
Kid means...Line got cut sir

1053
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:30,800
What common man?

1054
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:31,890
How do we send with a common man sir?

1055
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,010
How can we take such a risk sir?

1056
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,250
All fear listening to just his name sir.I know, I know, I know it

1057
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:37,200
At least give it a try, please goOkay sir

1058
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:40,810
Sir

1059
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:42,900
It seems this man will go

1060
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:43,540
This fellow?

1061
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:44,420
Move aside

1062
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:45,810
This man sir

1063
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,690
Hey, what is this?Scent, foul smell is coming

1064
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:10,580
What is your profession?

1065
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,970
Do you know orange sir?

1066
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:15,970
I peel it into piece, squeeze juice and sell it.I also put ice sir

1067
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,570
A juice seller?

1068
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,730
We have no other option sir

1069
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,730
Ok, did you say what to do?Yes sir, I said.

1070
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:22,280
Did I say it?

1071
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,770
If you give the money, I will bring sir

1072
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,210
What?

1073
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,450
He says he will bring sir

1074
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,140
We have no other option sir

1075
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,380
Ok, say how much?

1076
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,730
He is asking how much, say two Lakhs.

1077
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:34,770
One for you and one for me

1078
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:37,250
Ok...

1079
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,420
Two Lakhs it seems sirTwo Lakhs?

1080
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,610

01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,190
Hey, it is not required

1087
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,190
This is a secret mike.

1088
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,210

Me, bro? I am into burning bro

01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,290
Burning? What do you burn?

01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,090

01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,090
Initially it was east bro and laterthey sent me to West

1107
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,590
I came here as the demand was good here.

1108
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,530
What is your profession bro?

1109
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:36,450
Me?Yes

1110
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,260
I too shoot.. with a gun

1111
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,370
Hello!

1112
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,490
Welcome bro,

1113
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,820
Brother I shook the Commissionerand brought you out. Did you see?

1114
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:18,800
Well done brother

1115
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,130
Hey, open the lock

1116
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,950
I will open the lock if you give the girl.Am I right brother?

1117
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,810
Looks like the Police trained you well and sent you

1118
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,810
Sir, sir...Yes

1119
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:32,560
Some fax has come sir

1120
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:34,810
This fellow...

1121
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,520
What will you do if we do not give the girl now?

1122
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:39,630
I will shoot you all and take away the girl

1123
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,330
Hey, what are you talking idiot? Who are you?

1124
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:48,330
Karthikeya, Assistant Commissioner of Police

1125
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:53,490
Transferred from Cuddapah...

1126
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,650
You are the opening in this city

1127
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,290
Is it a joke?

1128
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:57,730
Why would I joke with you, idiot?

1129
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,010
Why does he say jokes?

1130
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:02,970
I said right? I do not burn maize but shoot bullets

1131
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,330
Did he really kill or what?

1132
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:11,850
He looks like a mental fellow.That is sir

1133
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,170
Why kill that fellow?That too risking the life of my daughter?

1134
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:14,890
Come on let us go.Yes sir

1135
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,810
Brother, get up brother. Brother

1136
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:08,570
Brother

1137
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:09,410
HeyYes

1138
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,810
It has been long since he died.

1139
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,170
It is a waste discussing about him

1140
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,130
You will die the next moment you kill the girl.

1141
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:20,010
Instead if you give me the girl and surrender,you will live getting a two year imprisonment

1142
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:24,010
You decide whether you want to die or live

1143
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:27,170
Two minutes time, I will be outside

1144
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:43,370
Sir

1145
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,530
You risked the life of girl, idiot

1146
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,450
Are you a Police?Are you a police?

1147
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,420
Do you not know thateven if 100 criminals escape...

1148
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,540
..even a single innocent should not get into risk?

1149
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,090
This is the basic fundamental, idiot

1150
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:55,860
My basics are different sir

1151
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:02,050
Not even one criminal should escape evenif ten innocent face the risk.

1152
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:03,470
Nothing will happen to the girl sir.

1153
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,090
A person with chills in his spinewill never even think of killing

1154
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:09,130
He would bring her safely sir

1155
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,450
Daddy

1156
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,250
Do not fear child, I am here right?

1157
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,450
Make baby sit in the car safely

1158
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:21,250
Ok sirGo child

1159
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:32,130
Hey, why to kill a guy who is arrested?

1160
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,090
Are you really mental?

1161
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:37,770
If you arrest this idiot, feed thrice a day and releaseon Gandhi Jayanthi, will he do any social service?

1162
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,290
I gave the ending thinking why to keep it pending.

1163
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,890
File closed!

1164
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,690
LaxmanI will write it as an encounter sir

1165
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,370
Good, game over!

1166
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,090
Game over?

1167
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:54,850
I do solemnly declare upon my honor and conscious

1168
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:59,730
that I will act at all times to the bestof my ability and knowledge

1169
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:03,010
in a manner befitting a Police officer.

1170
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:07,850
I will preserve the dignity andwill respect the rights of all individuals

1171
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:14,290
and will act justly and impartially and withproprietary towards my fellow officers

1172
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:24,900
I am Balram sir

1173
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,690
What are these crap bouquets and introductions?

1174
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:27,410
Do not waste time.

1175
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,570
All the pending cases on my table, right now

1176
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,490
He jumps sharply like the lightening in the sky

1177
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:40,330
He pumps in bulk like the fire flood

1178
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,770
If misbehaved, he puts shackles even to the air

1179
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,530
He puts even the land in cell if it is taking wrong path

1180
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:56,730
Anytime he is terror and he is the triggerto AK 47

1181
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,570
Touch him and see...

1182
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,890
Touch him and see...

1183
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,410

Touch him and see...

1186
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:12,360
His step is the police station,his look is a sting operation

1187
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,570
I beg on your feet sir, I will say whatever you ask sir

01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,250
What is A+B whole square?

1189
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,810
A square + B square + 2 AB

1190
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,930
Will he kill for not knowing that?That is what

1191
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:25,890
Do you know?

1192
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,290
I am weak in English sir

1193
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:28,690

01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:42,810
He should be here and look into everythingfor the function of baby on Sunday

1221

Who is that girl, grandson?

1275
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,870
Girl, which girl?

1276
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:56,990
She is on your bed...

01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:58,990
Oh no...

1278
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,670

1280
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:03,430

01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,670

1282
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,690
Old lady, get out.

1283
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,510

1287
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,230
We would have got her married long backif we had known she likes Karthik, right?

1288
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,850
I asked to talk long back uncle,

1289
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:25,980
but my old man said Karthik iswriting civil exams and do not disturb him

1290
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:29,350
Then he said training and later posting

1291
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:33,030
Posting came, promotion has comeand sir came even to Hyderabad

1292
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:36,510

01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,030

1343
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,150
BalramSir

01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:27,710

1345
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:28,830

01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,310
Two full

1347
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,390
Come MalleshComing sir

1348
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,110
If he has brought her here for outing before marriage,

1349
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:41,310
Then where would he take her for honeymoon?

1350
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,470
Maybe he will take her to the graveyard sir

1351
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,810
I pity her, dudea Sir, poor girl sir

1352
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:46,870
I said the same

1353
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:53,510
Sir

1354
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,860
Madam

1355
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,630
Thank God, is it done?

1356
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:01,230
Where is Karthik?

1357
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:02,410
He just went out madam

1358
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:04,510
Where?

1359
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,290
He went as some urgent call had come madam

1360
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,030
Oh, okOk madam

1361
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:25,630
These are all fake riots.

1362
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:29,350
They created all these for rally of CM sir not to take place

1363
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:33,390
You all are aware about who is behind all this, Rauf Lala

1364
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,070
MP for six times from the same area.

1365
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,990
Anyone wins with values or the differences

1366
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:04,270
But Lala wins with destruction

1367
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:07,190
Now to make his elder son Irfan Lala an MLA,

1368
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:11,230
he made the sitting MLA there resignand planned for a bi-election to come

1369
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:13,430
Lala does some destruction only for his need

1370
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,110
but Irfan, his life itself is a destruction

1371
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,390
To stop them

1372
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:43,120
I should do a rally in that area at any cost

1373
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:48,430
Looking at the last election polling reports,just 33% voting has happened

1374
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:52,940
Public are not voting either fearing to themor left with no other option

1375
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:59,910
By doing this rally, we shall givean assurance of a new leader coming for them

1376
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:02,590
We would get law and order problem if rally takes place sir

1377
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:05,350
Innocent public will be dead if something goes wrong sir

1378
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,910
I am the CM of this state.

1379
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:11,090
Should I fear to visit a constituency in this state?

1380
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,310
I have to go

1381
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,510
Sorry sir, but there would be so many security issues

1382
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,520
It is practically impossiblePossible sir

1383
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,160
100% smooth rally is possible sir

1384
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,190
Hey, be quiet

1385
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,880
Sir, he is a very reckless and risky fellow

1386
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:33,090
There will be risk in making the impossible into possible sir

1387
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,150
A Police is the one running into the risk

1388
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,590
Then you run into that risk and why do you involve him?

1389
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:39,590
Commissioner, stop.

1390
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,990
Officer- Sir

1391
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:42,030
What is your plan?

1392
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,890
Seeing whom did he get this courage?

1393
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,520
His name is Karthikeya, newly joined ACP

1394
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:53,620
Instead of fighting with him,I think better to compromise...

1395
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,390
I mean the outside people are saying

1396
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:58,720
It is been many years since strengthof Lala is shown in Muzaffarpet

1397
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:00,470
Let him start the rally

1398
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:03,400
Call the boys and run the competition

1399
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,310
5000 for killing one,10000 for killing a Police

1400
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:10,070
and announce five Lakhs for the guykilling most of the people.

1401
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:13,550
Fasi...Dad

1402
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:16,990
Smell of the blood should last at least for a week

1403
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:22,640
That CM should lose his post with one shotand my son should win

1404
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:32,140
Tell them to start the rally sir.

1405
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:34,780
I will say when CM sir should start. Over!

1406
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,830
Hey, Moula! Rally has started

1407
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,570
Where are you idiots? Rally has started there

1408
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,220
None should be left alive

1409
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:21,310
Fly

1410
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:42,670
Team A

1411
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,990
Team B

1412
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:55,330
Team C

1413
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:15,190
Hey, give the binocular

1414
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,430
Hey, all of them are coming. Where are our guys?

1415
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:42,470
Let them come sir, let them come

1416
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:45,670
There should be 3000 Police here as per the plan right?Where are they?

1417
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,950
I changed the plan sir

1418
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:48,390
Have you changed the plan?

1419
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,430
Has he planned to kill us or to stop them?

1420
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,150
They have come

1421
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:01,190
Be cool sir. Have some tea

1422
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:04,710
He is a mental fellow. I already said this mental fellow...

1423
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:09,490
Jammers on

1424
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,870
Why did the TV get off?

1425
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,990
Why did it go off, check? Come on see

1426
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:19,430

Joke is good, say another one

1439
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,760
Is it like a joke for you? You feel it a joke?

1440
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:35,830
See, see carefully.

1441
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:41,000
This is not a city, not street or lane.This is a forest, a forest

1442
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:43,380
And I am the lion of this forest, a Lion

1443
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,220
You dirty mosquito, I will squash you down

1444
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:47,750
Comedy ends

1445
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:55,720
If you are a lion, I am global warming

1446
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,690
All clear, ask CM sir to start.

1447
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:03,640
Order one tea

1448
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,420
Sir, I think global warming is a bit bad example

1449
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:19,100
Who said good? I tried as the sounding felt fine

1450
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,150
Ask whether he would have a tea?

1451

1452
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:46,750

1455
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,500

No, no Lala. This is not the correct time

1460
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,270
Courage grew in public with the rally.

1461
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,840
It gets difficult for us to winif even the polling percentage grows.

1462
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,880
It gets difficult

1463
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:36,140
We shall kill that Police, but not in the present anger Lala

1464
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,630

01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:46,990
Lala, you have two sons

1470
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,000

Cost of witness of your son is 100 crores

01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,500
Ask him to leave the matter herewithout getting too much emotional

1688
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:42,480
University student Shalini celebrating birthdayparty with friends in Mayuri resort is brutally murdered

1689
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,840
Police are searching for the murderers

1690
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:55,400
We appointed a dynamic officer to investigate this case

1691
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:01,040
Whoever the criminal is and however powerfulhe is, there is no chance of leaving him

1692
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,050
We will catch the criminal for sure

1693
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,140
Sir..Yes

1694
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,440
There are rumors heard of Irfan Lala son of Rauf Lalato have created nuisance in the party

1695
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:09,250
What do you say about that?

1696
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,480
About rumors.. there will be so many.

1697
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:13,510
That girl had multiple boyfriends

1698
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,670
Some Ex boyfriend may have got angry and murdered

1699
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:18,940
This too is a rumor.

1700
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,520
I said investigation is on, right?

1701
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:21,760
I call it a day

1702
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,680
We shall meet againSir..Sir.

1703
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,400
Sir, please answer.One question

1704
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:52,640
Sujatha madam is the teacherwho says which is good and bad to our kids

1705
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,960
And today, she is having to protest for justice

1706
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,850
This department is insulting the character of my daughteras they are unable to catch the criminal

1707
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,920
Have they appointed that Police man afterknowing what his character is in advance?

1708
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,370
I want justice

1709
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:07,660
We want justice

1710
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,320
What is the guarantee that the injustice happenedto Shalini will not repeat even in our case?

1711
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,740
We cannot control even when in classand what if they get onto the roads?

1712
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,310
Incapability of the Government is making it big

1713
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:18,320
We want justice

1714
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,690
Murderer should be punished hard

1715
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,630
Police officers protecting them to be suspended immediately

1716
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,320
We will show the power of students to the Government

1717
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,720
We want justice

1718
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,750
This protest will not stop till Shalini gets a justice

1719
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,330
Home Minister down, down

1720
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,750
Dirty kids, have ruined it

1721
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,550
Not understanding what to do...

1722
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:38,720
Rauf on one side is threatening to suck my blood

1723
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,640
And pressure on the other hand from the Central

1724
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,040
Those college guys instead of studying

1725
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:46,960
They are making this issue big throughsocial media posting in Face book and Twitter

1726
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,560
Sir, we shall immediately take action.Otherwise department will get a bad name

1727
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:54,760
My foot department, fit for nothing

1728
01:47:58,600 --> 01:47:59,840
Sir, I am sorry to say this.

1729
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,760
If you had given us powers before..I am giving powers right now

1730
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,560
What will your department do?

1731
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,120
My head is bursting.

1732
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:10,760
First get him out.

1733
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,080
Push this dynamic guy out.

1734
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,760
Appoint another and the issue will cool down

1735
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,400
What is this sir?

1736
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:18,670
Lemon soup! I will kick you hard if you talk again

1737
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:20,640
All this has actually come because of your loose tongue

1738
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,760
I will appoint, I will appoint an officerwho will teach you all a lesson

1739
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:31,090
Police... down, down.Police... down, down.

1740
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:36,990
Police... down, down.Police... down, down.

1741
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:43,690
Police... down, down.Police... down, down.

1742
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:48,640
Students down, downStudents down, down

1743
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,480
There were 50 guys on the spot.

1744
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,960
If you had caught him then and handed overto us, will this come to this state?

1745
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,240
There is a meaning in one fearing seeing ten guys.

1746
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:03,240
If 50 have feared seeing one guy,that is your incapability and timidity

1747
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,440
Down, down it seems... My foot!

1748
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,480
My name is Karthikeya madam,

1749
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,760
I am the new officer coming to deal this case

1750
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,480
You should have this juice at leastto see the justice you would get

1751
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,520
I can understand your anger for justice.

1752
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,880
As a mother, injustice may have happened to you

1753
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,520
But as a teacher, I will not let you get an injustice

1754
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,040
You may not remember every student who studied at you

1755
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,000
but every student will remember teachers like you

1756
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,080
This IPS was once your student, madam

1757
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,400
I promise you as your student madam

1758
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,640
Whoever may be the killer and how manyever may come in my way, I will catch him

1759
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,120
How will you catch without an evidence sir?

1760
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,960
Who said there is no witness? There is a evidence

1761
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,720
The guy who killed is the witness.

1762
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:00,520
Not in months or days but will catch him within hours

1763
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:04,960
My teacher who stood behind me makingme not fail is now writing the exam

1764
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,120
I will not let her fail, it is my word

1765
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,560
Thank you madam,

1766
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,240

01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,720

01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,520
Dheeraj, sir

1789
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,640
I know that you like Shalini very much.

1790
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,400
I checked your entire WhatsApp

1791
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,960
Do not lie that you were not there in the party that day

1792
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,360
I never said I was not there

1793
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,960
You were there right?

1794
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,080
It was Irfan who killed, right? Say

1795
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:57,960
Say

1796
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,720
Actually I had been to wash room at that time

1797
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,400
Hey, damn it...

1798
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,320
Timid idiot...

1799
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,640
Timid idiot...

1800
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:15,560
Hello

1801
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,240

1802
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,200
Ok madam, ok. One minute

1803
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,600
SirWhat?

1804
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,720
Divya madam is on line

1805
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,800
Can you not see me in duty?

1806
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,560
Switch off that phone first. Switch it off

1807
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,240
Sir... Sorry

1808
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,560
Start the vehicleYes sir

1809
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,280
Have you written the name ofMr. Vizag Prasad

1810
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:39,200
Yes daddy

1811
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,280
Yes, send a card to his son in law Ramesh

1812
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,720
Send a card even to your son along with them, uncle

1813
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,600
Why child? why card to him for his marriage?

1814
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:50,860
You and I are thinking this is his marriage,but he is not feeling it uncle

1815
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:56,710
What happened child?

1816
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,000
Did you and Karthik have a fight?

1817
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:00,680
I wish we could fight uncle.

1818
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,600
At least then, there would be a chanceto speak a few words

1819
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:09,390
I knew that he is mad about his duty

1820
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:12,480
but did not know that he is so mad thathe does not care about the girl in love

1821
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,080
I have seen how bad you feltthat day when he did not come,uncle

1822
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,010
I cannot bear that pain for life long

1823
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,230
Let us stop this marriage uncle

1824
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:30,240
Everything would set right oncethe marriage takes place dear

1825
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,000
No aunty, your son is already married to the police job

1826
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,030
Forget even about that thought.

1827
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,370
If not, you will be the reason to ruin life of a girl

1828
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,600
See you uncle

1829
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:47,920
Sorry

1830
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:14,400
What dad, you have not slept yet?

1831
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,480
I am not getting sleep, son

1832
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:21,880
Earlier I was sleepless in a fear about whereand how you were

1833
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,600
Nowadays strangely,

1834
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,290
If I am not there,

1835
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:31,020
The thought of my wife living with two daughersis making me lose sleep with fear

1836
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,840
Do you remember that yourmarriage is in four days?

1837
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,970
Do you know that the marriage is cancelled?

1838
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,680
Cancel?

1839
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:50,480
She is a girl who was behind you being crazy for you.She left saying she does not want you.

1840
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,440
Is she gone?

1841
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:52,670
What is the problem dad?

1842
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,890
You are the problem

1843
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,370
Have you spoken at least once withher after marriage is fixed?

1844
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:02,070
Have you at least once asked on thephone about what she likes and how she is?

1845
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,370
No...

1846
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,990
To see you, one should forget sleep and wait

1847
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:12,010
To speak with you, it should be very important matter

1848
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,020
What in your opinion is important?

1849
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:20,510
I feel to have a cup of coffee with youand that is important for me

1850
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,730
Your mom wishes to feed you with herown hands and that too is important

1851
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:30,190
Your sisters want to go for a movieand outing with you and that is important for them

1852
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,720
But none of these are important for you, son

1853
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:39,670
We are thinking about youcompulsively being parents and sisters,

1854
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,200
but have you ever been as a son to usor brother to them for at least one day?

1855
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:48,920
I am not asking to keep us on your headas we carried you on the shoulders

1856
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:50,920
I am asking to take just a bit of care

1857
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,040
What is it dad?

1858
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,600
You know what my job is and why do you say so?

1859
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:58,000
Everyone has a job butno one are leaving their family like you

1860
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,510
Even before you were a Police officer,you are the elder son of this family

1861
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,450
What duty have you done as a son?

1862
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:11,220
For the food and tablets consumed to digest in this age,

1863
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,010
we need a bit of love

1864
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,420
Only the job is lost if responsibility is forgotten.

1865
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,480
But if you forget the bonding, whole life is lost...

1866
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:22,040
Dad..

1867
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:32,560
Sorry son,

1868
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,080
I spoke some rubbish and wasted your time

1869
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:37,920
Children, go and sleep. You too go and sleep

1870
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,080
Sorry son, go and sleep

1871
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:20,760
Sir, ACP Karthikeya?

1872
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:21,880
Yes, who is it?

1873
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,320
I saw Shalini being killed sir,

1874
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,600
I will give witness if you provide protection

1875
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:25,360
Where are you now?

1876
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:26,360
Birla Planetarium sir

1877
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:27,440
Be right there and I will come right away.

1878
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,600
You have no need to fear

1879
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:39,680
Where are you?

1880
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,800
I left as i feared I was being followed sir

1881
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,200
Where are you now?I am at the IMAX sir

1882
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,400
I will be there in five minutes , be right there

1883
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,120
Hey, who parked the water tank here? Hey

1884
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:52,880
Hey stop, give the vehicle

1885
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,000
Excuse me Sandeep

1886
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:04,720
Not me sirOh, sorry

1887
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:10,320
Where are you?

1888
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,680
What rascal, you are running so much?

1889
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,080
Who are you, idiot?

1890
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:16,880
Irfan!

1891
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,940
Did you not get the witness?

1892
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,260
Do not waste your time, you will not get

1893
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,000
No one would say becauseThe fear Irfan

1894
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,270
Yes, what you said true.

1895
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:33,060
No one is giving witness fearing you

1896
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,900
I will kill that fear first

1897
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,580
Hey, what are you talking?

1898
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:39,290
Even the fear dies along with you when you die, right?

1899
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,010
They would then give witness right?

1900
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,760
HeyI will kill you

1901
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:46,040
I will kill you right today. Confirmed!hey!

1902
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,920
It seems you threatened to kill Irfan?

1903
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:56,960
I did not threaten sir,

1904
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,120
I said to i would kill him confirmedly

1905
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,120
Looks like he did not understand.Call and tell that Lala fellow

1906
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:08,400
Being a Home Minister and by supporting a criminal,what message do you want to give?

1907
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,920
Crazy cabbage...

1908
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,640
What, what did you say?

1909
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,120
Do not pretend not to have heard

1910
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,320
How do you think he would be aliveif your son is sent abroad, idiot?

1911
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,400
Are you so foolish?You dirty...

1912
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:33,080
You insult the home minister, idiot?I will suspend you

1913
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,480
Hey, he is coming. Drive on

1914
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,680
Is he mad or what?

1915
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:52,520
Will you suspend me? Will you suspend?

1916
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:53,880
Stop right there!

1917
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,720
When I am in uniform,there are just six bullets in the gun.

1918
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:03,440
If I take off the uniform, no idea whetherI would kill with a stone or rod

1919
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:05,600
Whatever I get into the hands, that is the weapon

1920
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,440
I will not even leave the one who obstructs

1921
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:27,320
Lala, is your younger son mad or is it the elder one?

1922
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,280
Hey, what are you saying?

1923
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,620
Why have you messed with this fellow?Send Irfan somewhere if he has to be alive

02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:33,000

02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:13,420
Get the sedation

1963
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:14,380
Ok DoctorAre you sure?

1964
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:15,620
Are you sure sir?

1965
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:19,220
If he comes to know the truth...You saw his anger, right sir?

1966
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:23,180
See, how he is shivering saying dutyeven in such a condition

1967
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:28,860
He was never my son even fora day after he wore the uniform

1968
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:33,420
Many like Karthikeya can be foundif your Police department needs

1969
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:36,380
But, he is the only son for my family sir

1970
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:38,740
Please sir, do something sir

1971
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:40,700
Please sirSir, please...

1972
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,540
What are you doing? Please...

1973
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:49,620
But he is the only son for my family.

1974
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:52,900
Please sir, do something sir

1975
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:03,420
Lala

1976
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:06,460
Commissioner,

1977
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,220
have you come for a compromise?

1978
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:11,860
Total family of the guy who broughtin such a situation for my son...

1979
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,540
Have you heard the story of a tiger hunting down the deer?

1980
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:17,900
I will kill so cruelly

1981
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,020
Your story is good Lala.

1982
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:26,460
But it is enough if you understandthat Karthikeya is the tiger in this story

1983
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:31,140
Your son went into coma when just a 4 MM bullet hit him

1984
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:34,180
4 Bullets of 9 MM metal went in there.

1985
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:39,340
Doctor said few months are required to recoverBut he woke up and sat in just 5 minutes.

1986
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,380
You know what he asked after waking up?

1987
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:43,860
He asked where my deer is

1988
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:47,680
He asked is that Irfan is dead or alive

1989
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,380
Are you giving him a warning?

1990
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:52,560
If he hears the name Irfan, it is enough.

1991
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,760
Being under sedation, still he would wake up and kill him

1992
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,420
He is a fool when it comes to duty Lala.

1993
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,220
I am saying this with experience

1994
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:02,820
I did not come for a compromise as you thought.

1995
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,060
I came to give an advice

1996
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,460
There is just one way to save your son

1997
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:11,300
You kill your son

1998
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:13,100
Hey, what are you talking?

1999
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:16,420
Make this world believe that yourson is dead in that shootout.

2000
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:18,180
Even Karthikeya should believe that.

2001
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:22,220
Your son will be alive at least on thisearth even if he is not in the census count

2002
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:23,780
Think well

2003
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:27,620
One more thing.

2004
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:32,160
On the record and off the record,there is no single pending case in his career

2005
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:45,100
Public and fans came in large for the final rites ofIrfan Lala son of Rauf Lala and expressed their support

2006
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:46,860
We made the whole world believe that lie.

2007
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,780
Karthikeya was suspended to have killedIrfan in anger under disciplinary action

2008
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,580
Though department lost a great officer,

2009
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:57,540
satisfaction that Karthikeya got closeto his family remained

2010
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:08,740
I did not find another way that day to save you, son

2011
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:10,620
Dad,

2012
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:13,060
you said only family is important.

2013
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:15,540
I lived saying only duty is important.

2014
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:19,420
But, I now understand that life isto balance both and live dad

2015
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:22,420
I do not have a worry to have left the department

2016
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:24,700
But I gave a word to my teacher.

2017
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:27,020
I gave my word to a mother that she will get justice.

2018
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:28,180
It did not happen.

2019
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:32,580
I will complete the work I left in the middle dad.

2020
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:35,060
Do not worry that I will go away again from you.

2021
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:36,140
I changed.

2022
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:37,780
Go son

2023
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:39,500
Go

2024
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,940
What, is Karthikeya coming?

2025
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:52,960
Dear, stop all these prayers, moviesand outing for some days.

2026
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:54,790
Forget the fact that you have a husband.

2027
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:57,300
Boys..

2028
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:01,020
I am Back..

2029
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:01,960
How many times should I say?

2030
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:04,980
Welcome sir!What is this?

2031
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:11,420
When I returned after so many years, no welcome,no bouquet, no garland and no shawl?

2032
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:14,420
Whatever Balram, affection on me is down dude.

2033
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:15,770
No, nothing so sir

2034
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:16,540
Who was on the phone?

2035
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:18,100
That was a call from wife sir

2036
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:20,740
There seems to be a ritual tomorrowand is asking to take a leave

2037
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:24,500
I said will give a divorce if she again callsand disturbs while on duty sir.

2038
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:25,300
Shut up...

2039
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,300
Do you have no sentiments?

2040
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:30,900
When they call with love, you talk crazily?

2041
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:33,860
Family is an ocean of emotions...

2042
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:34,940
Emotions.

2043
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:35,660
Sir.

2044
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:36,620
Emotions?

2045
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:37,220
Emotions?

2046
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:39,980
Nothing goes wrong by taking one day leave.

2047
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:42,020
Your leave letter should beon my table in five minutes, ok?

2048
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,620
There should be balance in life

2049
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:47,500
Did you not understand?

2050
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:50,860
Day and night balance,

2051
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:53,460
male and female balance,

2052
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:55,220
duty and family...

2053
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:55,900
Balance

2054
02:08:57,380 --> 02:09:00,380
60 murder cases, 150 cheating casesand 440 theft cases..

2055
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:02,180
Total 650 pending cases sir

2056
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:03,420
We shall finish in one week sir

2057
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,580
Rishi, justice should be done correctly.

2058
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,660
Nothing should be done in a hurry

2059
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:08,220
Right sir.

2060
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,620
Law and relation should be done in balance.

2061
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:11,620
We shall do

2062
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:15,380
Rishi....Bring the file of that Irfan first

2063
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:15,860
Ok sir

2064
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:21,100
BalramSir

2065
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:23,500
Who would that Lala believe strongly?

2066
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:24,740
Moula sir

2067
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:26,700
Is it? Move

2068
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:35,380
Hey, All of you don't move..otherwise I will shoot you.

2069
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:37,140
Hey...you also..don't move..

2070
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,580
Mr. Maula

2071
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:40,820
Mr. Maula

2072
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:45,580
Why did you come?

2073
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:46,980
I do not know anything.

2074
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,380
I still did not ask anything.

2075
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,020
Let us sit and talk

2076
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:51,780
Say what the matter is

2077
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:54,180
Mr. Maula keeping aside our fights,

2078
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:56,620
I will ask you one thing and you should not say no

2079
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,020
What is that?

2080
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:59,580
I came here on some other work.

2081
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:02,940
When asked about a matter at the centre,everyone said your name.

2082
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:04,220
What have you asked?

2083
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:06,420
I asked where would tea be good in this area.

2084
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:09,700
Everyone said tea would begreat in the house of Maula

2085
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:10,500
Tea?

2086
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:11,500
Tea?

2087
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:14,860
Yes Mr. Maula, if you give me one tea,I will happily drink and leave.

2088
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,740
Oh, tea?

2089
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:17,700
Yes, Mr. Maula

2090
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:19,380
Hey, bring two tea

2091
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:25,660
That Police has come Bhai

2092
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,100
Wow Mr. Maula

2093
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,540
What a tea,

2094
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:35,540
Is this Tea..?

2095
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:37,060
What they said is 100% correct

2096
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,100
Thank you Maula sir.

2097
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:39,980
Come on Balram.Thank you

2098
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:41,980
Mr. Maula has given super energy,

2099
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:42,980
shall we leave?

2100
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,220
See you..Thank you

2101
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:46,860
Did Karthikeya come?

2102
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:48,100
Yes, he came

2103
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,340
Why did he come?

2104
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:54,700
It seems there is a talk in my area that teaat my house is great and he came to drink

2105
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:55,940
What talk about the tea?

2106
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:58,100
I came to know that right now Lala

2107
02:10:58,420 --> 02:10:59,380
HeyYes

2108
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:01,500
Did he ask anything about Irfan?

2109
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:03,540
He did not take that name at all

2110
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,500
Then why did he come?

2111
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:06,940
I said right Lala, tea in my house...Shut up

2112
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:09,380
You do not open your mouth whatever he asks

2113
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:12,460
You know right, Irfan is deadIs he dead

2114
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,940
Maula, understand dude

2115
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:18,220
Yes, understood Lala. I understood

2116
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:20,180
Idiot!

2117
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:25,460
Why did he come again?

2118
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:29,660
Hey..

2119
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:36,620
Mr. Maula, you are saying the secrets todayand I am listening.

2120
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:39,740
I am not saying any secretsand you are not going to listen

2121
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:42,100
Balram

2122
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:44,060
You turn that way and close your ears

2123
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:45,180
Ok sir

2124
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:50,580
Ok, at least tell that just to me

2125
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,460
Once I say something, that is it

2126
02:11:54,620 --> 02:11:57,540
I do not like daily to comeand have tea like this at your home,

2127
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,980
Just one secret

2128
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,460
Tell me where do you get that Tea leaf?

2129
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:03,740
Tea leaf?

2130
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,060
He will listen, slowly

2131
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:08,300
Tea leaf?

2132
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,580
Yes Mr. MaulaIs that the secret?

2133
02:12:09,620 --> 02:12:10,460
Yes

02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,220
Thank you so much Mr. Maula.

02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:24,060
Oh no.

02:12:24,340 --> 02:12:25,500
One selfie please

2139
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,620
Why did he come again?

2140
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:33,420
He got addicted greatly to my tea Lala

2141
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:34,220
Shut up

2142
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:36,460
You have not given any secret information to him, right?

2143
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:39,660
He asked about the tea leaf and I said

2144
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:44,300
I did not say a word more, believe me Lala.

2145
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,540
I promise on IrfanShut up, idiot

2146
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:46,820
Why Irfan in the middle?

2147
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:47,900
He is dead right?

2148
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,620
What, is he dead again?

2149
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:50,580
Maula...

2150
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:52,820
When will you understand?

2151
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:53,980
Did you forget the plan?

2152
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:57,340
Yes, I understood. I understood

2153
02:12:57,540 --> 02:13:00,220
Stay away from that Police manand do not say whatever he asks

2154
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,340
Ok, see now

2155
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:03,220
I am here

2156
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:04,300
Mr. Maula

2157
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,540
Mr. Maula!

2158
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:07,420
Mr. Maula!

2159
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:10,060
Thank God, nobody saw me.

2160
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:12,500
Why does he say none saw? I saw him, right?

2161
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:16,860
Mr. Maula..Stop, stop right there.

2162
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:17,940
One tea Mr. Maula

2163
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,060
No more tea

2164
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:22,940

But do not say tea is over, I get hurt

2169
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:41,140
Taste is not in the tea leaf

2170
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,240
I came to know that it is in the house of Mr. Maula

2171
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:45,820

2172

Hey Lala, what are you doing?

02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:22,180
Do I look like a mad guy for you, rascal?

2185
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:23,620
Should I believe whatever you say?

2186
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,660
Why will he give you money withoutyou giving the information?

2187
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:29,340

02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:39,220

02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:40,420
Hawala?

2193
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:41,420
It would be a big amount

2194
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:42,540
Hey idiot, you...

2195
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:46,100

02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:50,860
You are making haste!

2199
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,660
You too leave

2200
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:52,780
Hey, come on guys

2201
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:59,860
Sir, Lala is calling to an unknown number

2202
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:00,620
Yes Irfan

2203
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:01,740
Tell me dad

2204
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,340
We cannot believe that Maula.

2205
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:05,300
You immediately shift to Binny Mills from there

2206
02:15:05,420 --> 02:15:06,980
No one should know that you are there

2207
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:10,780
Sir, we got information about Irfan.

2208
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:11,940
He is shifting to Binny mills

2209
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,620
Comedy ends...

2210
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:36,100
What idiot, you gained good color?

2211
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:37,780
There was a long gap right?

2212
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:42,620
Look, I do not know who you are.

2213
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:44,820
If you move, I will finish him and leave

2214
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:48,740
You should first cross me to reach Bhai.

2215
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:51,420
Routine dialogue

2216
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:53,340
We should not get tempted at all for such dialogues.

2217
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:56,060
Is a fight required with him having a gun in hands?

2218
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:57,130
Is it required?

2219
02:15:57,380 --> 02:15:57,740
No sir

2220
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:22,210
Though your dialogue just now was so routine,my ego got hurt somewhere

2221
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:26,210
There is a chance for him to live,if taken in half an hour to the hospital.

2222
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:28,870
Can you cross me and take?

2223
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,500
Touch me and see..

2224
02:16:31,820 --> 02:16:33,300
Touch me and see..

2225
02:16:34,580 --> 02:16:35,300
Super

2226
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:20,020
Hey, he is still alive. There is a chance,come on try

2227
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:30,620
Hey Balram, you said you are feeling hungry.Shall we go?

2228
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:31,940
He is still alive sir

2229
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:35,140
That is called the last breath

2230
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,650
Apply strong impact

2231
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:43,300
Counter attack

2232
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:47,100
Kick his right jaw..

2233
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:51,140
Dislocate jaw

2234
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:52,720
Body Shock.

2235
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:59,240
Ears ringing, jaw fractured, three ribs cracked,four broken, total collapse.

2236
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:01,340
Hey Lala,

2237
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:04,780
You did the final rites to an orphan bodysaying as your son earlier

2238
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,700
Now, your own son has become the property of Municipality

2239
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,020
Game over

2240
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:20,610
Daddy... Daddy

2241
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:27,390
Daddy... Daddy...

2242
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:29,500
Daddy...

2243
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:30,540
Daddy...

2244
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:32,540
You will be alright,

2245
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:35,060
you will be alright.

2246
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:36,520
He slept

2247
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:43,340
Sir,

2248
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:45,520
By the time we complete our duty and go home,

2249
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:46,720
If someone is waiting for us..

2250
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,940
Hey Mallesh, stop the vehicle.

2251
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:50,580
Sorry sir.

2252
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:51,530
I was just in a emotion..

2253
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:52,740
I forgot this angle completely.

2254
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,260
Go to Airport..

2255
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:14,950
Why did you ask me to come?

2256
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:16,770
Pushpa, that is

2257
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:18,290
I did a mistake Pushpa.

2258
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:20,100
Immediately after I saw, that is...Hey, stop..

2259
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:21,180
Come on, say stright..

2260
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:23,700
It does not suit at all for you, come to the point

2261
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:24,660
that is correct...

2262
02:19:24,950 --> 02:19:27,150
Pushpa, I am extremely sorry

2263
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:29,220
What is that screaming, idiot?

2264
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:33,620

2265
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:37,580

2266
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:40,780
Are you selling black tickets in theateror peanuts in the beach?

02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:41,940

2268
02:19:45,060 --> 02:19:48,420
Pushpa, I am extremely sorry

2269
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:50,700
You think, I am your sister in law?

2270
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:53,900
Don't start pampering..come to the point

2271
02:19:55,660 --> 02:19:57,780
Oh, to the point...

2272
02:19:57,900 --> 02:19:59,660
Hey, pushpa.. No..

2273
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:02,180

Come forward

2275
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:08,540
Come forward

2276
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:11,580
This is correct
