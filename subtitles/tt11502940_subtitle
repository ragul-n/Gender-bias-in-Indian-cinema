1
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,712
-Hey, check out for him!

2
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,734
-Bhai, he's out here.

3
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,171
-Please, spare me.
-Get hold of him.

4
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,017
-Bhai, please don't do it.
It wasn't me.

5
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,274
-The issue is between us.

6
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:19,906
-Why did you drag that family
in to it?

7
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:21,256
-Bhai, please, let go of me.

8
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:22,945
-Sethupathi, sir, has spoken!

9
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,985
-Die, damn it!

10
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:34,014
-Demons! I've mentioned million times
not to indulge in violence.

11
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:37,047
Blood stained hands.
And the house stinks of blood.

12
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:38,815
Everyone of you have lost your minds.

13
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,912
I've smeared the place with
turmeric and sandalwood...

14
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:42,451
still the blood stink makes me nauseous.

15
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,365
Come on, serve!

16
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,807
Yadagiri, what took you so long?
The hunger is killing us.

17
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,336
I'm not hungry.

18
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,211
Sister, served me sumptuous food.

19
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,109
Sister, please bring us some gravy.

20
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,289
The hunger is killing us!

21
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,711
All you guys can talk about
is killing...

22
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,666
there's nothing else that matters
to you people.

23
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,476
Sister, please serve us some gravy.

24
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,977
You guys comes to me for food.

25
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,948
But never pay heed to my concerns.

26
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,032
Serve them well. Once they've eaten...

27
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,750
let them get back to killing people.

28
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,615
Hey, old hag, I'm going to kill you soon.

29
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,795
You've been ranting the same
for 10 years.

30
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,092
They're never going to reform.

31
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,318
Who are we to take ones' life?

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,358
With God's grace,
we have everything we need.

33
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:26,561
Our child is on the way.

34
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,949
They're all here.
It's more than enough.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,246
Let's stop the rowdyism.

36
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:32,664
Just serve the gravy!

37
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,745
If you don't put an end to it.
Your sins will catch up to your son.

38
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,797
When his uncles are alive,
no one can dare touch him.

39
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,734
We'll teach him everything
related to combat...

40
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,334
and turn him into
an one man army!

41
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:50,476
Bloody sinners.
Shut up your dirty mouths.

42
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,810
-Don't get sister all worked up!

43
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:54,850
Unlike you people,
he'll never kill anyone.

44
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:56,480
He's my son.

45
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,215
People who trust him...

46
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,038
also people who come looking
for his help

47
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,045
he'll fulfill it with his life.

48
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,765
Dear, you may be just saying it.

49
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:06,716
Just like, Abhimanyu from Mahabharatha...

50
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,709
he's listening to every word we speak
inside your womb.

51
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,774
He'll listen to everything, and say to us
"Better listen to my mother..."

52
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,303
he'll skin us all to abide by your ideals.

53
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,444
-Oh, my God!

54
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,292
Wake up everyone!

55
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:27,344
Hey!

56
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,542
Sir!
Let's go!

57
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,241
Sir, you be with her.
We'll handle them.

58
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:40,405
Let's go!

59
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,300
Oh, God!
Please bear with me, dear.

60
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,597
-Baby's head is stuck in the
umbilical cord.

61
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,005
Dear, please bear with me.

62
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,511
-Just bear with me, dear.

63
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:11,885
It's a boy!

64
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:12,786
My, son!

65
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,169
We couldn't save the mother, sir.

66
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,834
He is born on an auspicious day.

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,556
You guys raise him well.

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,435
He'll raise you people in return.

69
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,857
"People who trust him...

70
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,610
also people who come looking
for his help

71
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:24,558
he'll fulfill it with his life."

72
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,478
"Sulthan"

73
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,160
Sir, please spare me.

74
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,502
A

75
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:14,116
A B C

76
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:15,468
-F.
-F.

77
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,905
-G.
-G.

78
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,011
Say it!

79
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,152
I'll say it, Sulthan!

80
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,485
-Sethupathi's men are feared
by the people of Vizag city.

81
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,659
Sir, many officers before you have
tried to bring down Sethupathi.

82
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:47,823
Sethupathi and his men
are extremely dangerous.

83
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,596
-There's nothing we can do about it.

84
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,368
Sulthan is about to arrive,
and no one seems to care.

85
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,921
Bloody buffaloes,
Sulthan, might arrive anytime.

86
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,555
Take bath get ready soon.

87
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:25,874
Are they truly playing
or just pretending to play?

88
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,042
I can't hear anything.

89
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,348
Hey, stop playing!

90
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,567
I said, stop it.

91
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,453
Bloody, King-Kong.
I can't hear anything, damn it.

92
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,192
Ask them play hard,
so that my ears should thrum!

93
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,178
Damn it, your ears are already
thrummed!

94
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,999
Sulthan is about to arrive
and you're being a nuisance.

95
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:46,617
Get to work people.
Sulthan, might be here anytime.

96
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,585
Sulthan is on his way. Not sure,
how long he'll stay this time.

97
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:52,052
Get everything in--
Yeah, I got it!

98
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,401
-What is it?
-Sir...

99
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,441
Sir, is hosting food drive right...

100
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,296
-they're here check what will be served.
-No, we are not.

101
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,449
-Then?
-We're here too meet, sir.

102
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,125
Oh, come along.

103
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,334
We want one person killed.

104
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,279
Kill? Who?

105
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:17,864
Jayaendra!

106
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:29,150
Our livelihood depends on agriculture.

107
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:34,364
Four years ago,
he offered money to buy our land.

108
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,817
We refused to sell him our land.

109
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,684
In the name of agriculture,
I asked you not to get into the field

110
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,880
also I asked you not to plow the land.

111
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:45,941
Looks like folks of this village
don't understand the meaning of it.

112
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,497
You're ready to sacrifice your lives...

113
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:51,692
but will never sell your lands, is it?

114
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,097
People who disobeyed his orders...

115
00:10:56,376 --> 00:11:00,877
he not only killed the humans
but the animals too.

116
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:07,758
Hereafter, no one in this village
should dare think of doing agriculture.

117
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,791
If they're still persistent,
then it'll be their death.

118
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,437
Death, it is!

119
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,515
Sir, the best we could offer.

120
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:33,987
Wedding chains of our women folk
and our hard earned money.

121
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:38,940
Please take this,
kill him and bury him into the ground.

122
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:45,792
We reached out to politicians
and officials for the help.

123
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,488
But no one cared to help.

124
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:53,875
Many from the village have migrated
and working minimum wage.

125
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,583
-Only when he's dead...

126
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,625
agriculture will come back to life
in our village.

127
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:03,539
-The entire village is waiting
for your arrival.

128
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,689
I have no idea about his power.

129
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,692
But I'll definitely save your people
and your lands.

130
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,240
Agriculture will once again bloom
in your village.

131
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:21,850
It's a promise!

132
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:27,023
In return,
all I need is just one fist full of paddy.

133
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:28,186
That's enough!

134
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,283
Thanks a lot, sir.

135
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,722
We're happy!

136
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,622
Hey, Sulthan has landed.
Quickly finish the work.

137
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,405
-We're almost done!

138
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,075
It's a village nearby, Amravati.
Not sure who is that person.

139
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,138
Is it important for us
to get involved?

140
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,240
It's very important, Mansoor.

141
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,833
We've committed too many sins.

142
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,976
God gives us one opportunity to do
some good through people like them.

143
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,140
Let's try to lessen our sins.

144
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:04,828
I've given my word.

145
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,711
It's imperative that I fulfill it.

146
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,750
Sulthan has arrived!

147
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,131
Hey! Hey! Hey!

148
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:00,235
-Sulthan!
-Hey, King-Kong!

149
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,024
How are you?

150
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:03,916
My state is like a calf stuck among the
herd of buffaloes.

151
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,306
Not a day goes by without
getting kicked by them.

152
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,603
-Vikram, how are you?
-Kasi, I'm good.

153
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,757
At least,
you called me by my name.

154
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:10,528
I'll catch you later!

155
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,141
Hey, how dare you call,
Sulthan by his name?

156
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,003
Isn't that his name?

157
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,535
Uncle!

158
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,513
-Kaali, how are you?
-I'm good Sulthan.

159
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:24,207
-Hey, Don, how are you?
-I'm good!

160
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,332
-Giri, how are you?
-I'm good, Sulthan.

161
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,924
-Uncle.
-Meet your father.

162
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,487
-Dad.
-Hey, stay blessed, son.

163
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,908
-How are you, dad?
-I'm doing well, dear.

164
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,080
-How are you?
-I'm doing good too.

165
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,940
Buddy, who are these hillbillies?

166
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,869
-Make way.
-Hey, put me down.

167
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,668
Is he truly your friend?

168
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:39,464
He's my friend, put him down.

169
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,245
-Who was hiding?
-You!

170
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:41,793
I didn't!

171
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:44,058
I got a little scared.
So, he's the Godfather, is it?

172
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,185
Namaste, father.

173
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,335
Hope you're doing well.

174
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:47,739
You returned after two years.

175
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:49,280
How long will you stay this time?

176
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:51,295
Oh, that's a person.
I thought it's a flower pot.

177
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,214

Look, it's tending to everything
like Rajinikanth from Robot.

226
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,519
I think human race is in danger.

227
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,119
You're right, buddy!

228
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,581
Sulthan, the robots were great.

229
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,627
-Thank you, everyone.
-That's awesome, Sulthan.

230
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,033
Dad, I'm planning to go to Japan
to develop this project.

231
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,629
Once the partnership is successful...

232
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,708
I'll apply for a loan
and start the company.

233
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:04,924
Sulthan, then give us 100 rowdy robots
to work for us.

234
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,097
They'll handle all the violence.

235
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,151
That'll take some load of us.

236
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,752
-Is it okay, if you lose your job?
-Oh, no!

237
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,362
Let them stay where they are.

238
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,354
I feel very proud of you, son.

239
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,511
Chief, we raised him.

240
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:18,729
But you're taking credit for it.

241
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,728
I won't be coming home,
until Sulthan is here.

242
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:26,635
Hang up the phone!

243
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,276
Buddy, the pizza we ordered is here.

244
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:30,713
Check once, before you pay them.

245
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:32,870
We wouldn't know if they've delivered
the right order.

246
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,300
Your mother wanted you to be successful.

247
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:38,487
But she's--

248
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:40,042
Chief!

249
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:41,986
Hey!

250
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:43,620
Dad!

251
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:46,447
Sulthan!

252
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,447
-Get hold of them?
-Hey, don't let them escape.

253
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,588
Sir, please get up. Be careful

254
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,448
Hold him!

255
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,956
Dad!

256
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,870
Hey, take him inside.
You guys check out back.

257
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,057
Hey, don't let them escape.

258
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,831
-Hey, stop with the nonsense.

259
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,737
I should've been there.

260
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,775
-Show me your hand.

261
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,063
Hey, find out who were the shooters.

262
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,439
They should die.

263
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,398
Mother, please don't cry.

264
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,439
Don't worry,
nothing will happen to brother.

265
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,086
Sir!

266
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,227
Mother, don't do it.

267
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,466
-Don't stop me.
-Mother, hear me out.

268
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:21,221
I hope you're not hurt and are fine.

269
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,618
I checked with the doctor...

270
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:28,174
it'll take 4 days to say
if he'd wake up or not.

271
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,111
Where's your father?
Call and ask him to come.

272
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:37,925
Ask him to come down and
ask my son to indulge in violence.

273
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:41,713
No matter what state he's in,
he'll definitely wake up.

274
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:42,775
Sharadha, ma'am.

275
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,434
Do you think, your father will indulge
you in violence?

276
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:02,172
Will he ever ask you to hack
someone to death?

277
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,861
He raised you safe and sound...

278
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,851
but he doesn't care about the children
of the others.

279
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:13,752
He's making a fortune for your future.

280
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,884
Your father is not earning wealth
for your future.

281
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:19,048
But burdening you with sins.

282
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,727
But we don't want to be
part of those sins.

283
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:27,197
Please save my son from death.

284
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:31,160
We'll go far away and make our living.

285
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:35,283
I want my son back.

286
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:41,316
Chief, we inquired at the pizzeria...

287
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:44,080
they were not their delivery boys.

288
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,478
But whoever sent them
lives in this city.

289
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:49,646
We'll find them.

290
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,383
Mansoor, that's not the issue at hand.

291
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:58,744
This shouldn't have happened
in Sulthan's presence.

292
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,014
He's exactly like his mother, Mahalakshmi.

293
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:03,458
Exactly!

294
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,990
Son, I thought you were here for a week.
But looks like you're leaving.

295
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,783
Did your girlfriend happened to call?

296
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:30,766
You live in Bombay,
having a girlfriend is quite common.

297
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:35,945
This toe-ring was my gift
to your mom.

298
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:41,744
She's the only person I bowed down to.

299
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,453
No one can speak up to her.

300
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
She was the Queen who ruled us all.

301
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,883
If you happen to meet someone
like your mother...

302
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:53,125
give this to her.

303
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,053
It's fine if you don't have a girlfriend.

304
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,252
I can find you a good match,
we can move things forward.

305
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:03,625
Dad, how can you be so negligent?

306
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,603
All this blood has numbed your emotions.

307
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:08,360
Many are injured and admitted
at the hospital.

308
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,293
There's a man who's struggling
for his life.

309
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,410
But you're more interested in finding
a match for your son.

310
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,371
Step out of your world,
there are many who've been cursing you.

311
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,848
All your sins will haunt me forever.

312
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,676
My life and education came out of
this blood-money.

313
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:27,047
When I think about it,
I'm angry at myself.

314
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,611
I'm ashamed!

315
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:31,685
Dad, I beg of you. For God sake,
put an end to this violent life.

316
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:34,579
Send everyone back home.
At least they'll be alive.

317
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:37,524
Even if I explain,
you wouldn't understand.

318
00:24:38,303 --> 00:24:39,509
We grew up in such circumstances.

319
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:42,728
We can neither stop or change
our way of living.

320
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,533
Only a handful have families
to go back to.

321
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:49,372
For many this is their only home.

322
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:50,853
And this is their family.

323
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,299
If you're my biological son,
they're my foster children.

324
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,923
You can't deprive them of it.

325
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,766
Then why was only I sent to Bombay?

326
00:24:58,435 --> 00:24:59,632
Why did only I get to
pursue education?

327
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,539
There are many in the gang
who are of my age.

328
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,774
If you had considered them as your child,
they would've led a decent life too.

329
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,292
Sharadha, ma'am,
questioned me at the hospital.

330
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,321
"If your father will indulge you
in violence?"

331
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,360
The look in her eyes will haunt me forever.

332
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,517
I'm leaving town, tomorrow.

333
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:21,987
I won't return.

334
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:26,236
Son!

335
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:32,079
To date, I've never asked anyone
for anything.

336
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:34,252
I'm asking you as a father...

337
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:35,922
You're free to go as per your will.

338
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,081
But make sure you get back to
your roots at the end.

339
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:43,142
Don't neglect them,
'cause their rowdies and hooligans.

340
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,915
They'll give up their lives,
chanting your name, Sulthan!

341
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,596
If they happen to run into some trouble...

342
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,548
stand by them.

343
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:53,774
That's enough.

344
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:39,946
What is it, uncle?

345
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:00,238
Sulthan!

346
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,923
The shooters from the other night...

347
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:53,781
are policemen.

348
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,980
That's right, it was ordered by
the new Commissioner, Mahendra Reddy.

349
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:01,687
Yes, sir. Your father was the target.

350
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:06,626
But now, the order is out to encounter
all the big-wigs from your gang.

351
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,616
They've planned to execute this
within 10 days.

352
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:10,929
Mallesham.

353
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:12,664
Rocky.

354
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:14,187
Arunachalam.

355
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:15,641
Sampu.

356
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:17,250
Sambasivam.

357
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:18,954
Yadagiri.

358
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:20,671
Kasi.

359
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:22,735
Michael.

360
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,414
Mansoor.

361
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:29,777
No one from this list should
succeed Sethupathi.

362
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,398
Encounter them all.

363
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:33,568
I want my city clean!

364
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:48,753
Encounter? I don't think so.
I heard it was a gang-war.

365
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,574
No one in this city has the courage
to take down, Sethupathi.

366
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,844
I know it was the police,
that attacked.

367
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:59,055
Hey, I told you not to keep a low profile
until Sulthan is out here.

368
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:00,330
What's the hurry, damn it?

369
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:02,110
There are enough problems, already.

370
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,298
You live in Mumbai.
You have nothing to do with them.

371
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:08,831
Stay away from it.

372
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:09,972
Get lost!

373
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:20,813
It's for your own good.

374
00:29:21,735 --> 00:29:23,594
Don't stay back. Leave from here.

375
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,121
What are you going to do,
after I leave?

376
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,187
Are you going to kill them all?

377
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,710
How many will you shoot?
10? 20?

378
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:31,802
Then?

379
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:46,124
You're well aware what'll happen
if they learn the truth.

380
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:49,007
They don't see a difference between
a constable and a commissioner.

381
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:50,780
Are you threatening me?

382
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,262
Are you planning to take
after your father?

383
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:54,914
No, sir!

384
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:57,755
I'm asking you for an opportunity.

385
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,599
You want to destroy them.
Whereas, I want to reform them.

386
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:02,834
Are you kidding?

387
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:05,703
It's impossible to reform them.

388
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,984
Every week 100's of cases are filed
against them.

389
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:10,140
How will you change them?

390
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,054
Violence runs in their blood.

391
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,100
Violence doesn't run in their blood.

392
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,546
In fact, it's in their brain.

393
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:21,756
We've excelled
to develop and command robots.

394
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:25,498
I was raised by them.
I'm sure they'll hear me out.

395
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,537
My father is one of the reasons,
why they've turned into criminals.

396
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:31,840
That's why I wanted to change it.

397
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:33,982
Give me an opportunity.

398
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:39,773
Have you read, Mahabharatham?

399
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:43,116
In Mahabharatham, Krishnan...

400
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:44,966
presented Kauravas with many opportunities,

401
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,116
but couldn't change their intentions.

402
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:48,013
So, Krishnan himself killed Kauravas.

403
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:50,451
You're just requesting for one opportunity.

404
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:52,427
I'll grant it.

405
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,802
I'll give you six months time.

406
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,187
But during these 6 months...

407
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:00,130
not even a single petty case should be
filed against them.

408
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:04,850
No complaint should be lodged
in any of the police station.

409
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:07,538
Is it possible?

410
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,068
Keep this in mind,
if something goes wrong...

411
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:25,755
nobody can save them.

412
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:33,192
In Mahabharatham,
Krishnan supported, Pandavas.

413
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:36,247
What if, Krishnan, had supported
the Kauravas?

414
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:37,980
I'm going to stand by them.

415
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,926
Why don't you read through Mahabharatham
once again excluding war?

416
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:52,082
Hello!

417
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,626
We're calling from Velagapudi.

418
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:56,178
When will you come over?

419
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:58,178
-We're losing lives by the day.

420
00:31:58,497 --> 00:32:01,199
Hey, 20 of our men head to that village.

421
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,264
-Village?
-Okay, sir.

422
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:04,794
Have you gone mad?

423
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,528
We still don't know who attacked us.

424
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:10,434
Instead of looking for them,
you're sending men to the village.

425
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,886
It's suits right, "A gang without a leader,
is as good as a headless body."

426
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,395
Hey, Kasi, mind your words!

427
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,504
Choose your words carefully, mate!

428
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,465
Now, I'm saying,
no one should go to the village!

429
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:29,582
Fine, let's fight it out to
arrive at a decision.

430
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:41,762
Come on, damn it!

431
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,208
-Hey, stop the fight.

432
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:52,816
Why did you stop?

433
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,544
-Go ahead and fight.
-Son, don't mistake us.

434
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,044
Fight among yourselves
and then go on a killing spree.

435
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:00,459
It's just 3 days since he died.

436
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:01,957
You people are inhuman.

437
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,857
How are you able to sleep at peace?

438
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,345
The blood doesn't haunt you?

439
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:08,291
I came home with such joy!

440
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:10,510
But now I regret coming home.

441
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:12,393
Get this into your heads.

442
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:15,994
If I see any of you indulging in
any kind of violence...

443
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,088
then I'll break all ties with you people.

444
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:23,017
I will never come back,
neither I'll see your faces.

445
00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:25,635
Make way!

446
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,095
You're not coming to Japan?

447
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:30,277
Have you gone mad?

448
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:33,302
Dude, this is your dream.
And you've worked hard for it.

449
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:35,440
They're no one, but a herd of rowdies.

450
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,376
Put them aside and let's leave for Japan.

451
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,394
To you they're are rowdies.

452
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,695
But they're everything for me.

453
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,323
I was fed by them.

454
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:46,370
I've slept on their laps.

455
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:49,191
Today, if I don't stand by them...

456
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,583
when I return...

457
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:52,701
I'll have no family to come back to.

458
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,157
You better leave. I'm not coming.

459
00:33:56,753 --> 00:33:57,179
Hey!

460
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:03,154
We have to go to that village.

461
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:07,014
That was our chief's last promise
made to them.

462
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:08,494
We can't evade that promise.

463
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:10,766
I'll handle, Sulthan.

464
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:12,290
He doesn't have to know.

465
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:16,490
As per our plan,
20 of our men set out to that village.

466
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:19,969
We shouldn't miss the target.

467
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,359
He has to die!

468
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,474
Hey, until we go past the gate...

469
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:29,464
no one should make a noise
out of fear.

470
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,054
Pin-drop-silence!

471
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:32,793
Who made that sound?

472
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:34,712
Idiot, that was you.
Shut up and keep walking.

473
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,238
Hey!

474
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:40,986
-Instead of opening the gate,
why is everyone turning around?

475
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,861
-Oh, no, he's up.
-Where are you guys headed?

476
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,093
Can't you hear me?

477
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:48,812
We thought of taking a night stroll.

478
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,253
Why do you need a bag for a stroll?

479
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,986
Junga, had requested to buy
biscuits and chocolates for him.

480
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,079
No, Sulthan.

481
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:58,798
-The Hulk got us pinned.
-You guys are up to something fishy.

482
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,675
Listen, we were headed to
find a match for me.

483
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,807
-You could've said the truth, instead.
-Get lost!

484
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,923
-To find a match?
-Yes!

485
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:09,955
-And you expect me to believe it?
-Yes.

486
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:10,807
Tell me the truth.

487
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:12,635
Damn, I have to come up
with another lie.

488
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,024
Okay, I'll tell you.

489
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:16,861
Last week, I had gone to the market
to get radish.

490
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:19,923
While I was returning,
someone tapped on my shoulder.

491
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:23,071
When I turned around to look,
it was my aunt.

492
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:25,360
I hugged my aunt and...

493
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,445
we both kept crying.

494
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,563
The entire market was looking at us.

495
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:30,783
Did I hit a wall?

496
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:31,695
Lie!

497
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,485
Fine, is this how you repay me
for feeding you?

498
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,690
-Why did you stop?
-Shut up, damn it!

499
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:37,220
Nothing, Junga's shoe-lace got stuck.

500
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:38,511
Bloody reaper!

501
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,181
After that my aunt said one thing
with teary eyes...

502
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:43,789
"Hey King-Kong, my daughter
is meant to get married to you...

503
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,906
she's been waiting for you
all her life

504
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,947
somehow you make sure to
get married to her."

505
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,869
My hands were tied with love.

506
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:51,666
I didn't want to disappoint them...

507
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,705
I wanted to go beyond your control
to find a match

508
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:58,524
and then come to meet you.
It was suggested by this shorty-pants.

509
00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,633
Really?

510
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,580
Something doesn't add up.

511
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,246
I know. I'm well aware
what doesn't add up.

512
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,634
I ran away from home
during childhood...

513
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,900
how did my aunt manage
to find me?

514
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:12,306
Since childhood,
my hairstyle hasn't changed.

515
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,955
-That wasn't my doubt, King-Kong.
-What else?

516
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:17,104
We named you "King-Kong".

517
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,331
I wonder how you aunt cried
calling out "King-Kong."

518
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,362
-Sulthan, he's laughing.
-Hey, I'm crying, damn it.

519
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,899
Sulthan, you don't seem to appreciate
the truth I told.

520
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:31,681
Instead, you've been finding loopholes
in my story.

521
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,446
If you don't believe,
I'll fall on your feet.

522
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:35,228
I'm telling the truth.

523
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,305
-Sulthan!
-I'm really hurt--

524
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,839
Hey, I've managed the situation,
don't come!

525
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:42,595
-Son, it was me who asked them--
-Bhai!

526
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,312
I've explained everything to him.

527
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:45,666
We're headed to find a match for me.

528
00:36:46,018 --> 00:36:47,870
Please don't mess up our plan.

529
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:49,838
Have you gone mad?

530
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,634
What do you expect?
The door was open and they were here.

531
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,751
Junga, brought him out.
Don't feed him anymore.

532
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,142
"No one should remain in Vizag
for the next 6 months."

533
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,885
"Take them far away from
any kind of trouble."

534
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,571
He's thinking hard. If our lie is caught,
then he'll skin us alive.

535
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:05,423
I deserve a bonus for handling
the situation.

536
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,378
Okay, I'll come along
to find a match for you.

537
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,157
You're coming? Bhai, help me.

538
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:15,548
Sulthan, he might not attend
his own wedding.

539
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,470
Why should you go?

540
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:17,321
Why shouldn't I?

541
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:19,969
This will be the first auspicious event
after father's demise.

542
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,007
What's the head-count at our house?

543
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:23,789
There are 94 people in our house.

544
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,955
-Including, Junga, it'll be 110.
-Right!

545
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,313
All of us are going to find
a match for him.

546
00:37:40,477 --> 00:37:42,782
Listen everyone.
Gather around folks.

547
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:45,110
Come on, folks gather around.

548
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,884
Listen, just as we planned,

549
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,824
the rowdies from Vishakapattinam
have arrived.

550
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,142
They're put up at the marriage hall
in the town.

551
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,938
If we point them to Jayaendran,
they'll kill him.

552
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:06,680
Listen, no one should know
the purpose of their visit.

553
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:07,561
Okay, sir.

554
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,610
If Jayaendran, comes to know,
we'll be in big trouble.

555
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,369
Sulthan shouldn't know anything about it.

556
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:16,916
Also, Jayaendran should die.

557
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,668
Yeah right,
as if this is going to happen.

558
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:22,893
It's not going to end well.

559
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,152
-He's always so negative.
-Ignore him.

560
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:26,837
Everyone leave.
Get back to your homes.

561
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:32,783
Listen, when I return I'll take attendance.

562
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:35,908
Even if one of you goes missing,
I'll kill everyone.

563
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:38,792
Sulthan, don't leave us behind.

564
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,603
Sulthan, please let us come too.

565
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:42,585
Sulthan, let's us come along too.

566
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,217
King-Kong,
I thought you said, it's a village.

567
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:47,265
It looks like a deserted forest

568
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,093
Obviously, no one allows farmers
to carry out agriculture these days.

569
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:51,443
Are you here to find me a match
or for a vacation?

570
00:38:57,913 --> 00:38:59,468
-They've arrived at the perfect
auspicious time.

571
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,069
I wonder who's my father-in-law
among them.

572
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,084
It must be the bald one.

573
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,024
-Son-in-law, your hair is your asset!
-My dear, father-in-law.

574
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:11,110
Bloody, King-Kong that's not
your father-in-law. It's him.

575
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:12,811
Thank God, Sulthan didn't notice.

576
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:18,108
Dear Lord Veerabadhra.
You're finally here to save us.

577
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:20,483
You're our guardian angel!

578
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,006
Gran, I'm not the groom-to-be,
it's him.

579
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,076
She's not the girl, let's go inside.

580
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:28,454
Lord Veerabhadra has arrived
to save the village.

581
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,609
An important thing.

582
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,139
Sulthan shouldn't know the purpose
of our visit to this village.

583
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:34,689
-Namaste.
-Welcome, everyone.

584
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,655
Wow, King-Kong,
the house is built on teak wood.

585
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:39,460
-Burma teak wood.
-Looks like your in-laws are loaded.

586
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:40,233
Fantastic!

587
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,985
How can you not wear a watch
for a meet like this?

588
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,492
-What are you doing?
-You should look dapper.

589
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:47,343
-Namaste, everyone!
-Riches, know the way of life.

590
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,038
I went around the house,
it looks great.

591
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:51,405
-Don't go overboard.
-Yes!

592
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:52,586
Coffee is here.

593
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,788
Hey, old hag,
that Afro is the bridegroom.

594
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:01,218
Oh, God! They've found a dork
for my grand-daughter.

595
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,366
Hey, old hag, get lost!

596
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,790
Hey, they're calling you a dork
and you're laughing.

597
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,930
She didn't call me a dork.
That was for you.

598
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:38,436
Sulthan.

599
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,481
Sit down!

600
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:41,499
Sulthan!

601
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:43,161
Hey, Sulthan.

602
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:46,169
We're here to find him a match.
Not for you.

603
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,123
-Sit down.

604
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,690
Oh, no, that was embarrassing!

605
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,743
Dude, look, the girl has arrived.

606
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,271
-Get lost!
-That hurts!

607
00:40:57,885 --> 00:40:59,823
I can't believe it myself,
if they say she's my cousin.

608
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,996
Can't digest the fact that he's got
such a beautiful cousin.

609
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:16,172
Son, do you like the girl?

610
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:19,225
Be prompt with your answer.
Please don't come up with lame excuses.

611
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:20,924
-I was saying...
-I can't take this anymore.

612
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:24,868
The girl is gorgeous.
I'm having hard time saying no.

613
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,295
I don't care if people come down to
beat me up...

614
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:28,269
I'm going to say, yes!

615
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:30,509
-Oh, God!
-I don't like the girl.

616
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:35,418
-Why?
-She's not the right match for me.

617
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,790
-Hey, I ought to...
-Oh, no!

618
00:41:38,637 --> 00:41:42,112
Hey, swear that you really
don't like the girl?

619
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:44,956
-Isn't she beautiful?
-To hell with her.

620
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:47,542
She isn't beautiful.
I don't like that girl.

621
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:49,636
You're a sweetheart!

622
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:50,581
Okay, fine.

623
00:41:51,649 --> 00:41:52,332
Remove that watch.

624
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,193
-God is great.
-How do I remove it?

625
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:56,322
-Remove, damn it!
-How do I remove it?

626
00:41:57,149 --> 00:41:59,034
You ought to be lucky to
find the right girl and a watch.

627
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:01,107
Lost the watch!

628
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,249
Are you sure that you don't
like your cousin?

629
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,135
Buddy, are you trying to
convince me?

630
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,784
I don't like her. Rejected!

631
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,673
-Beautiful!
-I've made up my mind.

632
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:18,620
I already rejected you,
stop staring!

633
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:23,172
My name is, Vikram.

634
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:26,431
-But everyone calls me, Sulthan.
-I told you, right.

635
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,019
I work as Robotics Engineer in Bombay.

636
00:42:29,622 --> 00:42:30,927
I make 3 lakhs a month.

637
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:34,002
Soon, I'll be starting my own company
and will leave to, Japan.

638
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:36,818
Son, why are telling us about yourself?

639
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:37,576
I'm getting to it.

640
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,764
Bridegroom, didn't like the girl
as she's not pretty.

641
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:54,808
But I like her a lot.

642
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,908
-What?
-Oh, God!

643
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,698
I would like to marry her.

644
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:11,399
That's why you reassured, is it?

645
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:16,933
But I don't like him.

646
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:19,542
Thank God!

647
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,143
Thank you.

648
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,880
She rejected you and you're smiling.

649
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:31,561
You're too much, man!

650
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,316

669

Son, that girl anyway rejected you.

670
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:01,501
Let's get back to our city.

671
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,814
That's right, Sulthan. Let's go back!

672
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:07,057
Sulthan has arrived!

673
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:11,876
Brothers in arms, listen carefully.
We've left behind violence.

674
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:14,949
Until that girl accepts my proposal...

675
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,910
all of us are going to stay
at this village.

676
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:17,904

00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:19,984

What would you do, if you learn
that she's not my actual cousin?

722
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:50,550
I will remove your name...
From the family card!

723
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:52,160
He's threatening to kill.

724
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:55,565
Son, we have some work to tend to.

725
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,136
There's nothing outside for you people.

726
00:48:58,276 --> 00:48:59,739
If you stay indoors,
that'll do good to the village.

727
00:49:05,348 --> 00:49:07,339
-Do you have the vehicle ready?
-Can't hear!

728
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,941
Hey, is it ready?

729
00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:11,793
-Let's go.
-We should return, before Sulthan, does.

730
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:13,039
If not we'll be in trouble.

731
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:16,762
Go slowly,
don't get too close to the vehicle.

732
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,070
Turn around!

733
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:28,063
Pull over to the left. Stop!

734
00:49:28,493 --> 00:49:29,827
I said, stop, damn it!

735
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,079
Why did you bring him to drive?

736
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:43,547
Sir, that's him, Jayendra.
That's Jayendra!

737
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,453
Hey, start the vehicle.

738
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:19,396
Hey, King-Kong,
when will your cousin pass by?

739
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:22,163
Dude, if by chance you get
married to her...

740
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:24,648
you may have to do all the chores
at home.

741
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:27,382
I have you to do all my chores!

742
00:50:27,515 --> 00:50:28,876
Chores for me and the girl for you,
is it?

743
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:32,982
-Hey, she has arrived!
-So?

744
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:46,672
My dear, cousin!

745
00:50:47,037 --> 00:50:49,992
My chief has been starving since morning
to get a glimpse of you.

746
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:51,530
Come over and speak to him.

747
00:50:51,735 --> 00:50:53,384
Rowdies don't scare me.

748
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,640
The folks of village may be scared of you.
But I'm not scared.

749
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:57,125
-Oh!
-Get lost. I can't talk to him.

750
00:50:57,212 --> 00:50:58,499
If you were truly gutsy,

751
00:50:58,615 --> 00:51:00,655
then why did you hire us
to kill the rowdies?

752
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:03,109
Why didn't you chase him away yourself?

753
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:06,681
You couldn't right?
If you don't go and talk to him...

754
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,901
he won't let me live in peace.

755
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:14,022
Later, he'll come to know
we're not related to each other.

756
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:17,248
The village's problem won't be solved.
And we'll be exposed.

757
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:21,254
I ought to...

758
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:23,907
Buffalo, step aside.

759
00:51:25,144 --> 00:51:26,640
Hey, step down.

760
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:28,663
-No, Sulthan.
-Why?

761
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,508
She look outraged.
What if she harms you?

762
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,040
Hey, don't embarrass me.
Get lost!

763
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,288
-No, Sulthan.
-Damn it...

764
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,422
-Go and fetch it.
-Hail Sulthan!

765
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:43,850
Sorry. He's too sincere with his job.

766
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:47,026
-This color suits--
-I said, I don't like you.

767
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,836
But still you keep stalking me.

768
00:51:50,752 --> 00:51:52,479
I heard you wanted to talk.
Come on, talk.

769
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:53,799
Talk!

770
00:51:54,338 --> 00:51:56,604
-I don't know what to say--
-Speak up!

771
00:51:57,765 --> 00:52:00,718
-I don't know how to put it--
-Come on, say it.

772
00:52:00,878 --> 00:52:02,991
Shut up. Don't be an angry bird!

773
00:52:04,578 --> 00:52:09,099
The guy out there,
is he truly your cousin?

774
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,423
-Just take a look at him.

775
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:12,489
Why?

776
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,164
It's 'cause, you're too beautiful.

777
00:52:17,352 --> 00:52:22,017
Despite many efforts,
I'm not able to see him as your cousin.

778
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,939
Moreover, they're all rowdies.

779
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:29,063
I have a doubt that,
they might've threatened you to say it.

780
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:32,937
Come on, no one will dare to lie
about being ones' cousin.

781
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:35,366
He's definitely my cousin.

782
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:38,781
He resembles our deity, Karipootharaja.

783
00:52:38,944 --> 00:52:40,342
Karipootharaja, is it!

784
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:44,171
-Is that all?
-No.

785
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:45,556
I'm leaving.

786
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,273
Oh, no, listen.

787
00:52:48,178 --> 00:52:48,870
Listen!

788
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:53,796
Listen, I went a little overboard.

789
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:56,431
Please wad off evil.

790
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:07,891
It's not fair that you've been using
your daughter as a pawn.

791
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,902
And that guy has been stalking him.

792
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,196
Please, shut up.

793
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,024
You've never paid heed to my woes.

794
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:14,731
You'll learn when it backfires.

795
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:19,744
When I have a daughter myself,
it's not fair to ask someone else to do it.

796
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:23,128
-That's why...
-I'm your daughter, dad.

797
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:27,447
Not just you, even I'm ready to
do anything for this village.

798
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,525
Please be careful, dear.

799
00:53:30,743 --> 00:53:32,633
They're all rowdies!

800
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,926
Kasi!

801
00:53:39,074 --> 00:53:41,425
They all have left to the
Taluk office.

802
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:44,846
If we rat them out to Sulthan.
They'll run away from there.

803
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:55,369
Idiot!

804
00:53:56,269 --> 00:54:00,002
We can't make them our enemies
nor go up against them.

805
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,204
They're very powerful!

806
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:05,501
I'm going to do this alone.

807
00:54:06,817 --> 00:54:07,892
What did you say his name was?

808
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:30,683
I'll kill him, before they do!

809
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:33,058
Run faster, I don't want to miss the bus.

810
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:35,363
Get a seat--

811
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:38,368
Namaste. Hearty welcome!

812
00:54:42,502 --> 00:54:44,676
Oh, damn, she's staring at me.

813
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:47,964
Hey, Rukku,
we got into the bus of rowdies.

814
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:49,896
Let's get down.
We'll take the next one.

815
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:53,317
-Hey, start the bus.
-Hey, get moving!

816
00:54:53,448 --> 00:54:55,862
Hey, you can't just evade so easily.

817
00:54:55,952 --> 00:54:57,474
The bus has left. Buy a ticket.

818
00:54:58,612 --> 00:55:01,387
Fine, as you're my cousin.
The ticket is on me.

819
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,151
I'll do you a favour.

820
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,680
Please be a good girl
and sit next to Sulthan.

821
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:08,163
Dear, are you getting angry?

822
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,968
I really don't care.
Stare as much as possible.

823
00:55:11,114 --> 00:55:13,993
But keep in mind,
your village is at stake.

824
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:15,876
Don't piss me off!

825
00:55:16,499 --> 00:55:18,727
Take your bags,
go and sit next to him.

826
00:55:18,885 --> 00:55:20,283
Go!
Come on, pick it up!

827
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:22,814
Make sure you don't graze me.

828
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:24,462
-Stop giving me stares.
-Bloody moron!

829
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,097
She never listens to me!

830
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,900
She looks very angry.

831
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:31,024
I'm sure she won't sit next to me.

832
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,438
It's better I get up.

833
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,394
Please take a seat. I'll stand.

834
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,361
Sulthan, don't stand, sit next to her.

835
00:55:43,922 --> 00:55:45,419
Sit next to her, Sulthan.

836
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:46,195
Shut up!

837
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:46,983
Hey!

838
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:49,454
Don't mind us.
Come on, sit down.

839
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:50,444
Oh, no!

840
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:51,624
I said, sit down!

841
00:55:52,175 --> 00:55:52,964
Sit down.

842
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:55,588
She looks pissed.

843
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:59,083
What the hell do you want?

844
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:01,311
I just want you.

845
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:05,070
I wasn't kidding about
getting married to you.

846
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,717
I've never met a woman like you.

847
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:11,812
Vibrant bindi.
Eyes laced with kohl.

848
00:56:12,756 --> 00:56:15,946
Followed by a pretty nose ring.
You're truly beautiful

849
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:21,768
Moreover, you look just like how
my father had described.

850
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:26,604
Brave women. Fearless.
You don't mind about speaking boldly.

851
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:29,828
This is my mother's toe-ring.

852
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:33,453
My dad asked me to give it to
the girl I'm going to get married to.

853
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,391
I wish to give it to you.

854
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,978
-Sulthan, what happened?

855
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:42,832
What happened?
What happened, Sulthan?

856
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:44,708
Nothing to worry. I'm fine.

857
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,070
What happened, buddy?

858
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:48,986
I was sitting next to your cousin.

859
00:56:49,662 --> 00:56:50,932
Our shoulders touched.

860
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,479
And then I felt a jolt through my body.

861
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:55,386
If so, you should be rubbing your body
not just your thighs.

862
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,145
It's 'cause it felt like someone
pricked me with a pin.

863
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:59,895
It's not just a feeling, dude.
She truly pricked you with a pin.

864
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:02,370
-I ought to--
-Hey, calm down.

865
00:57:03,424 --> 00:57:04,523
-Love?
-I'll kill you.

866
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:06,690
We're about to hit a bump,
jump and hug her.

867
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:09,111
-She's a devil.
-Morons!

868
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,869
Who is the new officer?

869
00:57:13,026 --> 00:57:14,121
He has a political background, boss.

870
00:57:14,257 --> 00:57:16,420
-How dare he lists rules to us?
-He's not aware of your power.

871
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,934
If he doesn't sign by tomorrow.
Kill him and his entire family.

872
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:19,630
Okay, boss!

873
00:58:19,397 --> 00:58:21,044
Bhai, forbade you to go outside.

874
00:58:21,525 --> 00:58:22,702
Why are you disobeying his orders?

875
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:24,153
Let go, damn it!

876
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:32,195
Hey, Damodaram.

877
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,133
Hey, Damodaram!

878
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:36,475
-Stop the cart.
-Hold on.

879
00:58:38,905 --> 00:58:40,874
Why did you leave the village
without informing anyone?

880
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:41,936
It's not fair.

881
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,405
There's nothing left to do
in this village.

882
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:46,725
They've hired goons from the city.
They'll kill Jayaendran for sure.

883
00:58:46,797 --> 00:58:48,186
When? When exactly?

884
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:51,451
My children have been crying all night
asking for food.

885
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:53,999
There's not even a grain of rice
at the house.

886
00:58:54,105 --> 00:58:56,943
As a father, how do you expect me
to bear it all?

887
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:57,950
To hell with this village.

888
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:02,164
Dear Lord, only you can save this village!

889
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:17,958
I want to talk to you.

890
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:20,722
Sure, let's talk.

891
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:28,077
Since childhood,
I've been visiting this temple.

892
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:34,578
The village used to look like
a green-heaven from all corners.

893
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:39,953
It's been 4 years, since,
they stopped farming on these lands.

894
00:59:41,575 --> 00:59:44,639
That's why I've taken an oath
at this temple.

895
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:50,796
The farming should revive and the
village should breathe green.

896
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:54,485
The rice harvested from this land
should be served at my wedding.

897
00:59:56,285 --> 00:59:56,846
Okay.

898
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:02,663
I took an oath saying, the man who'll
make this happen will be my husband.

899
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:10,288
So, please don't waste your time
lurking behind me.

900
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,475
I will not break my oath.

901
01:00:12,918 --> 01:00:15,011
It's better you finish the job
you came for and get back to your life.

902
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:18,317
What job?

903
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:21,298
Rukmani!

904
01:00:22,337 --> 01:00:26,179
You're behaving like a kid
ranting about promises and oath.

905
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:31,187
Say something that suits me, like becoming
a Steve Jobs, Sundar Pichai or Bill gates.

906
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:32,671
I'll try becoming one.

907
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:34,590
How can I take up agriculture?

908
01:00:41,652 --> 01:00:44,116
To you people,
agriculture is an unallocated job right?

909
01:00:44,756 --> 01:00:47,459
The names Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

910
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:52,999
There's a farmer somewhere starving
his family to feed you and the big-wigs.

911
01:00:53,273 --> 01:00:54,451
And is continuing to do agriculture.

912
01:00:55,426 --> 01:00:58,843
Without stepping into the mud
or toiling yourself...

913
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,194
with the arrogance that money
can buy you food and water

914
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:04,013
will never respect a farmer!

915
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:15,521
What's happening?
Why is everyone gathered?

916
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,732
Jayaendran, is not your problem.

917
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:19,591
Your problem is entirely different.

918
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:20,801
What are you saying, sir?

919
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:22,272
Without your knowledge...

920
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:24,732
there are people using this village
to crack a huge deal.

921
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:28,093
They're not after your lands
but the resource it holds.

922
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:30,066
Iron!

923
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:34,599
This land and that mountain contains
high "Iron" content.

924
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,631
You're refusing to sell your lands.

925
01:01:36,804 --> 01:01:38,152
And if they force you,
it will end in a protest.

926
01:01:38,546 --> 01:01:39,734
They're well aware of it.

927
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:43,990
So in the name of rowdyism,
they prevented you from doing farming

928
01:01:44,108 --> 01:01:47,972
and have created a document
which proves that the lands are barren.

929
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:51,030
In another six months,
they'll take away your lands.

930
01:01:51,191 --> 01:01:53,070
-Sir, we worked hard to earn
these lands.

931
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,725
-Why should we even let them
take it away from us?

932
01:01:55,335 --> 01:01:56,193
Tell me?

933
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,405
I told you so. We could've
compromised and taken the money.

934
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:00,646
Now, we're left with nothing.

935
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:02,405
Bloody moron, you've never said
anything good.

936
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:04,788
Selling the land that feeds us,
is like selling our parents.

937
01:02:05,185 --> 01:02:08,445
-Disgusting fellow.
-Mister, I'm speaking the truth.

938
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,202
Do you think you people have a choice?

939
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:12,920
There's only one option left.

940
01:02:13,138 --> 01:02:17,429
Like how they're trying to prove
that these lands are barren...

941
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:21,843
similarly, you too prove that
these lands are fertile

942
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:24,523
and it'll yield crops in abundance.

943
01:02:24,929 --> 01:02:29,443
For that to happen, you people
have to immediately start farming.

944
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:31,679
And that should happen in another
six months.

945
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,656
Protests won't save your land...

946
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,312
neither going to the court
will fetch you justice.

947
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,679
I hail from a farmer's family...

948
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:40,124
that's why I'm here to help.

949
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:42,772
I'm informing this to you people
by risking my life.

950
01:02:43,162 --> 01:02:44,512
Please save your land.

951
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:45,684
Let's go.

952
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,991
-Calm down. Let's discuss further.
-Bloody sinners!

953
01:02:54,373 --> 01:02:56,282
You people will never prosper!

954
01:02:57,313 --> 01:02:58,741
You don't let us live in peace.

955
01:02:59,023 --> 01:03:01,210
I've lost my son and my husband.

956
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,320
Now, I'm going to lose my land too.

957
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,179
I hope you're happy now.

958
01:03:10,192 --> 01:03:12,507
Why are you being an obstacle?

959
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:15,695
Lord Veerabhadara,
what are you waiting for?

960
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:19,624
Can't you hear the cries of poor people?

961
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:24,148
Please help this land and its people.

962
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:26,915
Hack that beast down to death.

963
01:03:27,469 --> 01:03:29,379
Please do something.

964
01:03:29,437 --> 01:03:31,206
Please do something about it.

965
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:35,632
Please do something about it.

966
01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:38,450
Are you serious?

967
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,969
"Why are you being an obstacle?"

968
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:55,235
"Uncle, I'm glad you're here to save us!"

969
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:58,500
"Please help this land and its people."

970
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:01,031
"Hack that beast down to death."

971
01:04:02,732 --> 01:04:04,539
Bhai is calling.
Tell me, Bhai!

972
01:04:04,653 --> 01:04:07,051
Hey, are you with, Sulthan?

973
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:08,645
Yes, he's with me.

974
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,840
Make sure until evening,
Sulthan, doesn't visit the market.

975
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:12,784
What happened?

976
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:14,383
Because, we're in the bus
heading towards market.

977
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,260
Are you headed towards the market?

978
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:21,543
Bhai, I'm ready!

979
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:23,391
Brother, we're ready.

980
01:04:30,418 --> 01:04:33,019
Hey, how long will it take
for you to get here?

981
01:04:33,298 --> 01:04:35,307
In 5 minutes,
we'll arrive at the market.

982
01:05:03,906 --> 01:05:06,711
Hey, find out who hired men
to kill me.

983
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:08,984
If you run into new faces,
don't spare them, bring them to me.

984
01:05:13,015 --> 01:05:14,453
-Hey.
-We're ready!

985
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:16,672
Die, damn it!

986
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:18,265
Bhai, we're ready.

987
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,000
-Hey, don't be in a haste.

988
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:25,083
Wait for my orders.

989
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:27,187
Who hired men to kill me?

990
01:05:27,646 --> 01:05:28,977
He's right at the mark.

991
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:30,538
I don't know.

992
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:33,054
-Wait. I'll tell you when to strike.

993
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:35,575
-Chief.
-We shouldn't mess it up.

994
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:36,421
Do you understand?

995
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:38,360
Smoke them out!

996
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:39,438
Who dared, damn it?

997
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:42,730
-Bhai, can you hear me?
-Wait.

998
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:46,538
Who is it?

999
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:49,630
Hey.

1000
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:51,671
Tell me!

1001
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:53,430
Ready.

1002
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,677
-You people have 2 minutes.

1003
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,302
-Shouldn't miss the target.

1004
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:06,215
Now, get into ac--

1005
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:09,913
-Hey, hey, hey! Hold on.

1006
01:06:10,078 --> 01:06:11,117
Not now!

1007
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,676
Wait until the bus leaves.

1008
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:14,764
I'll keep you informed.

1009
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:17,456
Wait it out until the bus leaves.

1010
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,636
-Sulthan is inside the bus.
Don't be in a hurry.

1011
01:06:23,966 --> 01:06:26,983
Sulthan, please hear me out.
Don't go out there.

1012
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:35,073
Hey, don't do anything now.
Hold your positions.

1013
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:35,800
Sulthan is here.

1014
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,807
Hey, Sulthan is out here.
Fall back, damn it.

1015
01:06:45,748 --> 01:06:48,050
-Let's not do this in Sulthan's presence.
We'll handle this later.

1016
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:50,753
We'll execute this on a different day.

1017
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:51,745
Abort!

1018
01:07:12,543 --> 01:07:14,719
Sir, I have no clue about it.

1019
01:07:32,238 --> 01:07:33,291
Hey!

1020
01:07:54,877 --> 01:07:55,595
Brother!

1021
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:03,729
-He's coming to kill you.

1022
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,073
Who is it?

1023
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:30,441
Sulthan!

1024
01:08:35,143 --> 01:08:36,486
You guys are still thirsty for blood.

1025
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:39,807
No one should stay out here anymore.

1026
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:41,679
-Everyone leave.
-Sulthan--

1027
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,589
Uncle, you heard me!

1028
01:08:42,787 --> 01:08:46,295
Sulthan, this was your father's
last word.

1029
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:48,393
We'll have to respect his word.

1030
01:08:49,856 --> 01:08:50,984
Ignore the dead.

1031
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:53,945
Think about the people who are alive.

1032
01:08:55,535 --> 01:08:58,915
Until I'm alive, I'll make sure
none of you indulge in violence.

1033
01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:01,506
Leave!

1034
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:03,533
-Sir, help us.
-Son, please help us.

1035
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,608
-Sir, please save our people.
-Brother, what happened?

1036
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:10,252
Son, Jayaendran has taken over
the village.

1037
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:16,766
Grandpa!

1038
01:09:18,065 --> 01:09:19,752
Please, don't beat up my grandpa.

1039
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:23,119
Please don't beat him.

1040
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,692
Before I skin her alive...

1041
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:01,057
it's better if you people confess it.

1042
01:10:01,433 --> 01:10:03,378
Who hired men to kill me?

1043
01:10:04,588 --> 01:10:05,409
Who is it?

1044
01:10:06,026 --> 01:10:08,822
He's destroying the village.
Son, please come and save us.

1045
01:10:09,618 --> 01:10:12,652
He's on a killing spree.
The bodies are piling up.

1046
01:10:13,052 --> 01:10:15,895
No one came forward to
help the farmers.

1047
01:10:16,185 --> 01:10:17,480
Only your father came forward...

1048
01:10:17,636 --> 01:10:21,767
and promised to save us
and our lands.

1049
01:10:22,216 --> 01:10:26,025
The entire village is dependent
on that promise.

1050
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:30,447
Please come and save us.

1051
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:33,002
Sir, please save us all.

1052
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,573
Sulthan, don't think you're doing
something wrong.

1053
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:41,235
Your father may not be alive today...

1054
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,229
but his promise still lives as a hope
in people's hearts.

1055
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:47,819
Just this once,
let us resort to violence.

1056
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:51,819
After which we'll abide to everything
you ask of us.

1057
01:10:51,996 --> 01:10:54,643
Just this once...
Just this once, let us do it.

1058
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:02,145
Sulthan, what are you doing?

1059
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:03,959
Sulthan, don't do this.

1060
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:05,062
Sulthan, don't do it.

1061
01:11:05,324 --> 01:11:07,096
I'm sure he's not as dangerous
as you people.

1062
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:09,958
Violence is not the answer to everything.

1063
01:11:11,544 --> 01:11:12,506
I'll speak to him.

1064
01:11:12,973 --> 01:11:15,962
Sulthan, please hear us out.
Don't go alone out there.

1065
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:18,088
-Don't go. Let us come too.
-It was a mistake.

1066
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:19,737
Hey, break the lock.

1067
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:26,450
Oh, please spare me!

1068
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:28,281
I know that it's not him.

1069
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:30,160
Tell me who is it?

1070
01:11:31,314 --> 01:11:32,985
Who hired men to kill me?

1071
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:40,773
-They've brutally killed my son.

1072
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:45,218
-Sir, look at the carnage
they've left behind.

1073
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:51,586
Oh, God, no!

1074
01:11:56,182 --> 01:11:57,658
Uncle!

1075
01:11:58,603 --> 01:12:03,736
Uncle, they beat up, grandpa!

1076
01:12:11,836 --> 01:12:15,900
Lord Veerabhadara,
are you still not convinced?

1077
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:19,448
Can't you see the innocent blood
is being spilled?

1078
01:12:19,656 --> 01:12:22,805
Come to your senses, my lord!

1079
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:25,502
Damn, the Panther has made its entry.

1080
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:28,423
-Tell me, who is it?
-Oh, no, it's hurting.

1081
01:12:36,373 --> 01:12:37,904
Brother, he's behind you.

1082
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:39,681
That's the man who saved your life.

1083
01:12:49,803 --> 01:12:52,444
Hey, who are you?

1084
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,779
I know why you people have come down
to this village.

1085
01:12:58,262 --> 01:13:04,138
This is not your place neither
it's your problem to solve.

1086
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:07,615
But you saved my life.

1087
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,088
Don't sacrifice your men in vain.

1088
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,069
I'm sparing your life.
Get lost!

1089
01:13:16,862 --> 01:13:19,255
"Not even a single petty case should be
filed against them."

1090
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:22,059
"Keep this in mind,
if something goes wrong...

1091
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:23,695
nobody can save them."

1092
01:13:24,187 --> 01:13:26,061
"If they happen to run into some trouble...

1093
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:27,853
stand by them."

1094
01:13:53,081 --> 01:13:56,059
I'll handle, Sulthan.
You guys put down, Jayaendran.

1095
01:13:57,844 --> 01:13:58,570
Come on, guys!

1096
01:14:58,219 --> 01:14:59,365
Veera!

1097
01:16:51,052 --> 01:16:51,903
Hail Sulthan!

1098
01:17:01,716 --> 01:17:02,862
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1099
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:35,500
"Raze him down!"

1100
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:36,334
"Hail Sulthan!"

1101
01:17:36,397 --> 01:17:37,194
"Raze him down!"

1102
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:37,990
"Hail Sulthan!"

1103
01:17:38,038 --> 01:17:38,865
"Raze him down!"

1104
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:39,769
"Hail Sulthan!"

1105
01:17:39,832 --> 01:17:40,627
"Raze him down!"

1106
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:41,478
"Hail Sulthan!"

1107
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:44,413
"Raze him down!"

1108
01:17:56,859 --> 01:17:58,453
Nailed it!

1109
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:54,601
-Don't look!
-Get lost!

1110
01:19:05,618 --> 01:19:08,005
Wad off all the evil engulfing
these angels!

1111
01:19:13,557 --> 01:19:15,783
Hey, we had a wrong impression
about, Sulthan.

1112
01:19:16,024 --> 01:19:18,871
They way he bashed that man,
I felt it in my bones.

1113
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:27,730
Sulthan has guts of glory!

1114
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:38,317
Make a note, no one can stand a chance
in front of Sulthan.

1115
01:19:38,377 --> 01:19:40,333
True that. We're going to rule the city.

1116
01:19:40,638 --> 01:19:41,158
-Pay up.

1117
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:43,900
Kasi, the focus has entirely
shifted to, Sulthan.

1118
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:46,020
Do something sooner and turn things around.

1119
01:19:51,572 --> 01:19:53,795
Wait and watch, the entire city will be
under Sulthan's control.

1120
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:16,343
-Brother, please have food.
-Sure, dear.

1121
01:20:19,431 --> 01:20:21,493
Sulthan, she's deliberately ignoring you.

1122
01:20:21,895 --> 01:20:23,947
She isn't ignoring.
She might've not noticed me.

1123
01:20:24,457 --> 01:20:25,755
Just watch, she'll come back
and hug me with joy.

1124
01:20:27,814 --> 01:20:29,111
Brother, do you want some gravy?

1125
01:20:29,182 --> 01:20:30,274
-That's enough, dear.
-X Y Z

1126
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:31,618
Say what?

1127
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:34,091
Why is she staring at me again?

1128
01:20:34,184 --> 01:20:35,918
What's with the attitude?

1129
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:37,473
Shoulders down!

1130
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:39,481
Remove your shades.

1131
01:20:39,925 --> 01:20:41,497
The respect seemed to have
diminished further.

1132
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:43,184
Go!

1133
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:44,019
Listen...

1134
01:20:45,117 --> 01:20:46,735
I beat up a gang of hooligans,
just for you.

1135
01:20:48,164 --> 01:20:50,361
X Y Z, you don't have to say it!

1136
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,392
At least, you can thank me.

1137
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:54,501
This feast is our way of saying thanks.

1138
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:56,609
Eat well and please get going.

1139
01:20:59,350 --> 01:20:59,861
Get lost!

1140
01:21:00,547 --> 01:21:02,945
-Say what?
-I said, I will go and have my meal.

1141
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,593
I can even handle an army.

1142
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:08,413
I wonder, why I'm scared of her.

1143
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:09,460
Big-eye-doe!

1144
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:11,399
Suthan, phone for you.

1145
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:14,445
-Hello.
-Son, this is lawyer speaking.

1146
01:21:14,571 --> 01:21:15,359
Tell me, sir!

1147
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:16,640
Did you watch the news?

1148
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:19,326
Police has been shooting down
rowdies like dogs.

1149
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,444
They're painting the town red
with their blood.

1150
01:21:24,515 --> 01:21:26,233
This encounter was not
a planned action.

1151
01:21:27,026 --> 01:21:28,165
Just self-defense!

1152
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:30,586
Anyway, Vizag should be crime-free.

1153
01:21:30,705 --> 01:21:31,806
This is just the beginning.

1154
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:33,204
When we're done with
the operation...

1155
01:21:33,409 --> 01:21:35,797
rowdies and rowdyism in Vizag
will be wiped clean.

1156
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,841
No matter what happens,
make sure they don't return to the city.

1157
01:21:39,111 --> 01:21:39,890
Be careful, son.

1158
01:21:41,015 --> 01:21:41,742
Okay, sir.

1159
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,711
This evening we'll be leaving
to the city.

1160
01:21:55,964 --> 01:21:57,825
-Is it? Go safe.
-Okay, sir. Go safe.

1161
01:21:58,003 --> 01:22:00,766
Hey, listen closely,
we're going back home in the evening.

1162
01:22:00,897 --> 01:22:03,143
You can't find food on the train
during the night.

1163
01:22:03,313 --> 01:22:05,016
It's better stuff yourselves
as much as you can.

1164
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:08,016
-Understood?
-Hey, Sulthan, stop thinking and eat well.

1165
01:22:08,954 --> 01:22:10,290
Hey, pour him gravy.

1166
01:22:10,338 --> 01:22:12,305
I heard you guys are part of
the same family.

1167
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:13,688
-Is it?
-Yes.

1168
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,641
I believe your food expenses
will soar high.

1169
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:18,102
They eat about 10 sacks of rice in a day.
Why do you ask?

1170
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:21,868
Son, you shouldn't keep an account
of ones' meal.

1171
01:22:22,148 --> 01:22:24,922
If there were 100 members in my family...

1172
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:28,063
I will provide food for 10 villages.

1173
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:31,791
How?

1174
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:34,307
I would've asked them to get into field...

1175
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:40,001
on 10 acres of land,
I would've planted veggies

1176
01:22:40,244 --> 01:22:41,916
on the other side, banana plantation

1177
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,869
and finally on the other side,
pulses and canes.

1178
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:51,002
They're incorrigible. No one knows
anything about agriculture.

1179
01:22:51,392 --> 01:22:55,658
Son, even the software professionals are
doing agriculture.

1180
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:56,971
These guys are capable too.

1181
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:00,416
Your ancestors must've done agriculture.

1182
01:23:00,704 --> 01:23:03,353
Agriculture runs in your blood.

1183
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:05,940
Seeds will yield regardless
who sows it.

1184
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,305
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1185
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,182
When we went to Vizag to meet
his father in regards to our problem...

1186
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:16,429
we mentioned that we're farmers.

1187
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:18,033
He didn't demand even a penny.

1188
01:23:18,398 --> 01:23:20,398
All he asked was
for one fist full of paddy.

1189
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:21,541
That was his nobility.

1190
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:23,937
As farmers, not just a fist full...

1191
01:23:24,162 --> 01:23:26,697
but we'll give them a share
from our harvest.

1192
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,860
Son, I hope you're happy
with the decision.

1193
01:23:33,164 --> 01:23:35,617
I was told that you people are leaving
to Vizag this evening.

1194
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:38,189
Please feel free to ask,
if you need anything more before you leave.

1195
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:42,119
It's right opportunity,
ask his daughter's hand in marriage.

1196
01:23:42,338 --> 01:23:43,554
Go ahead, don't hesitate.

1197
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:44,648
He'll state his demands.

1198
01:23:45,116 --> 01:23:49,096
Sulthan!

1199
01:23:51,563 --> 01:23:53,760
Greetings to one and all.

1200
01:23:54,939 --> 01:23:58,508
Violence was fine
until my father was alive.

1201
01:23:59,023 --> 01:24:00,135
Or when our men did it too.

1202
01:24:00,751 --> 01:24:01,751
But I never liked it.

1203
01:24:02,383 --> 01:24:04,297
But when I give it a thought...

1204
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:08,713
cutting down a tree is a sin,
but cutting down thorns is not.

1205
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,306
Rightly said!

1206
01:24:15,111 --> 01:24:18,752
Few years ago, we discussed about
having both science and agriculture.

1207
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:22,541
But when I visited this village I realized,
science has advanced

1208
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,494
but agriculture has been left behind.

1209
01:24:25,118 --> 01:24:26,783
No one seems to care about it.

1210
01:24:27,283 --> 01:24:28,244
That includes me too.

1211
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:32,604
I was under the impression,
money is enough to buy food and water.

1212
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,783
But that's not the case now.

1213
01:24:43,717 --> 01:24:47,502
The view of this village from the hill
should be green all-over.

1214
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:01,032
The rice harvested from this land
should be served at my wedding.

1215
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:12,349
I should be the one...

1216
01:25:15,262 --> 01:25:15,993
who made it happen.

1217
01:25:18,587 --> 01:25:20,587
-No idea what's running in his mind.

1218
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,160
Hey-- Hey, what's he saying?

1219
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:26,610
What is he saying?

1220
01:25:26,723 --> 01:25:28,134
Brother, what is he saying?

1221
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,728
You don't understand is it?

1222
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,970
Let me put it in simple terms.

1223
01:25:37,676 --> 01:25:42,134
My brothers and I are going to stay back
for 5 months in this village...

1224
01:25:42,616 --> 01:25:45,930
and carry out agriculture
along with you folks.

1225
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:49,266
Agriculture?

1226
01:25:49,801 --> 01:25:50,876
What did he say, Michael?

1227
01:25:51,599 --> 01:25:53,063
He wants to carry out agriculture.

1228
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,801
Aren't you folks happy about it?

1229
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:57,513
Son, what have you done?

1230
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:58,646
Agriculture?

1231
01:26:00,003 --> 01:26:02,132
To us agriculture is not
an unallocated job.

1232
01:26:03,403 --> 01:26:04,571
We're capable and determined to do it.

1233
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:08,985
So, please consider us as your children...

1234
01:26:09,256 --> 01:26:12,212
and lend us your land to
carry out agriculture.

1235
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:13,002
That's it!

1236
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:24,524
Women and young girls reside
in our village.

1237
01:26:24,701 --> 01:26:26,040
If we let the rowdies
inside our village...

1238
01:26:26,184 --> 01:26:27,613
how do we live in peace?

1239
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:29,303
Hey, they're way better than you.

1240
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,766
They risked their lives
and saved our village.

1241
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:34,290
You can't just jump to conclusions.

1242
01:26:34,428 --> 01:26:36,623
Similarly, once a man asked for our land...

1243
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:39,048
for 4 years he tortured us like animals.

1244
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:41,938
They're in large number like an army.

1245
01:26:42,075 --> 01:26:45,337
If they've made a decision,
then they'll destroy this village.

1246
01:26:45,532 --> 01:26:47,923
In my opinion,
it's better they stay back.

1247
01:26:48,146 --> 01:26:51,599
You're a loner. You wouldn't understand
the woes of a family man.

1248
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,147
Old man has a point.

1249
01:26:53,309 --> 01:26:55,415
It's better for the village,
if they stay back.

1250
01:26:55,505 --> 01:26:58,727
Enough, dear. Women are not supposed to
voice out in council.

1251
01:26:59,677 --> 01:27:02,931
Uncle, Jayaendran is not dead yet.

1252
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:04,712
He is just injured.

1253
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,926
Hey, If he returns...

1254
01:27:07,172 --> 01:27:10,180
he'll avenge us all
by burning down this village.

1255
01:27:10,337 --> 01:27:11,257
-He has a point!

1256
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:14,360
They're not our problem
at the moment.

1257
01:27:14,684 --> 01:27:15,781
Our problem right now...

1258
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:19,555
is to irrigate our lands for next 6 months,
turn them fertile and save our lands.

1259
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:23,149
To prove that the lands aren't barren
but are fertile to carry out agriculture.

1260
01:27:23,288 --> 01:27:25,364
This will happen only if they stay back.

1261
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:27,383
Hey, she's got a solid point, brother.

1262
01:27:27,598 --> 01:27:29,074
No, this won't work out.

1263
01:27:29,709 --> 01:27:31,646
For the sake of our lands,
we can't lose respect.

1264
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:34,033
-Tell me!
-Hey, shut up.

1265
01:27:34,377 --> 01:27:36,966
We don't have a choice.
My daughter has a point.

1266
01:27:37,475 --> 01:27:40,138
Fine, who is going to give them
land to carry out agriculture?

1267
01:27:42,412 --> 01:27:43,395
Cat caught your tongue?

1268
01:27:44,358 --> 01:27:45,513
Tell me, who is going to give them land?

1269
01:27:45,701 --> 01:27:48,474
I own 1 acre of land,
I'll give them my land.

1270
01:27:49,842 --> 01:27:52,277
What will they do with just 1 acre?

1271
01:27:52,411 --> 01:27:54,808
Hey, I own 8 acres of land.
I'll give them too.

1272
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:56,644
-I'll give them.
-I'll give them too.

1273
01:27:56,722 --> 01:27:58,722
The lands are idle at the moment.
I'll give them too.

1274
01:28:01,363 --> 01:28:04,561
Sulthan, if you ask us to spill blood,
we're game.

1275
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:07,566
Hard work, agriculture
and toiling ourselves won't suit us.

1276
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:11,233
Wham, Bam, Van Damme!
Doesn't matter if it's the leg or hand

1277
01:28:11,432 --> 01:28:12,999
just 15 minutes!

1278
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:16,174
Later, when we return
feast on a good meal and take rest.

1279
01:28:16,339 --> 01:28:19,788
Why do we have to put ourselves
through such hardship?

1280
01:28:20,073 --> 01:28:22,557
Brother, Sambasivam,
you spoke really well.

1281
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:23,983
Come here.

1282
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:27,725
Congratulations, go ahead!

1283
01:28:29,855 --> 01:28:30,749
Sambasivam...

1284
01:28:32,221 --> 01:28:33,400
You left out, "brother."

1285
01:28:33,643 --> 01:28:35,655
Give me the right answer to the question...

1286
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:36,975
the respect will add on, automatically.

1287
01:28:37,769 --> 01:28:41,600
Tell me, does pumpkin grow on plants
or on the creeper?

1288
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:48,663
Come on!

1289
01:28:50,877 --> 01:28:51,884
It doesn't grow on either.

1290
01:28:52,705 --> 01:28:53,580
It grows on the trees.

1291
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:54,608
Care to explain?

1292
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:58,370
Suthan, brinjal, tomatoes and
ladies finger, they're small vegetables.

1293
01:28:58,574 --> 01:28:59,644
Plant and creepers can hold them.

1294
01:29:00,053 --> 01:29:02,014
But the pumpkin is huge.

1295
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:03,374
Plant and creepers can't hold it.

1296
01:29:03,535 --> 01:29:04,639
So, it can only grow on trees.

1297
01:29:04,918 --> 01:29:05,655
Beautiful!

1298
01:29:05,861 --> 01:29:07,036
Pumpkins grow on trees.
And you've seen them?

1299
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:09,006
Yes, Sulthan, I'm very sure about it.

1300
01:29:09,127 --> 01:29:13,022
So, you can spill blood
but can't drop a sweat.

1301
01:29:13,206 --> 01:29:14,655
You guys know to stuff yourselves
with food,

1302
01:29:14,741 --> 01:29:16,124
but agriculture is tough, is it?

1303
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,484
-You don't even know how it grows.
-He couldn't reply to a simple question.

1304
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:24,998
Listen, you guys agreed to do
any job I offered.

1305
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,512
Here on, agriculture is your only job.

1306
01:29:31,878 --> 01:29:33,667
People who refused to work...

1307
01:29:34,026 --> 01:29:37,777
You have a custom, where the winner
decides what the loser does.

1308
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,433
Come on, defeat me in a fight...

1309
01:29:40,972 --> 01:29:42,065
and you can do as per your will.

1310
01:29:44,292 --> 01:29:47,284
Son, how can they fight you?

1311
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,531
No, Kasi.

1312
01:29:51,457 --> 01:29:54,394
It's decided. Tomorrow 5 AM,
everyone be ready.

1313
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:56,261
-We're dead meat!
-So early?

1314
01:29:58,275 --> 01:29:58,947
Right on!

1315
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:03,502
-Keep moving!

1316
01:30:04,493 --> 01:30:06,583
Bless us all, dear lord!

1317
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,789

Oh, lord!

should be sowed by the luckiest of all.

You please do the honors!

1383
01:34:17,057 --> 01:34:19,435

I'm sure they can do a good job.

That's a troop of elephants!

1389
01:34:54,172 --> 01:34:59,198
Not just one or two,
they're more than hundred in number.

1390
01:34:59,837 --> 01:35:05,253
No one can dare to go past them
into that village.

1391
01:35:05,852 --> 01:35:07,248

01:35:07,813 --> 01:35:09,566

You can't do squat without my help.

1396
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:28,353
Back in the day,
an acre was just 250 rupees.

1397
01:35:28,648 --> 01:35:32,255
-Why isn't she out yet?
-That's impossible in the present day.

1398
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:53,662
Never smiles!

1399
01:35:53,733 --> 01:35:56,357
-Hey, King-Kong,
Sulthan is in a romantic mood. Talk to him.

1400
01:35:57,997 --> 01:36:00,105
-What's with the night stroll?
-Come with me.

1401
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,673
-You speak to him.
-Go ahead.

1402
01:36:02,728 --> 01:36:04,103
Why am I the scapegoat?

1403
01:36:04,793 --> 01:36:05,519
Sulthan.

1404
01:36:12,436 --> 01:36:15,070
Enough with farming,
let's get back to Vizag.

1405
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:18,539
They asked me to convey this message.

1406
01:36:18,843 --> 01:36:20,648
You can't ask the killers
to pick thorns.

1407
01:36:20,788 --> 01:36:22,795
We'll manage to ride share autos
and make a living.

1408
01:36:23,187 --> 01:36:24,757
You people should've thought about it
before getting here.

1409
01:36:25,271 --> 01:36:26,546
We've made a promise.

1410
01:36:26,928 --> 01:36:28,560
We'll have to stay until we resolve
the problem.

1411
01:36:28,887 --> 01:36:31,405
Not to worry, Sulthan.
Just give us an hour...

1412
01:36:31,522 --> 01:36:35,058
we'll hack down every soul
that are a threat to this village.

1413
01:36:36,391 --> 01:36:38,143
Sulthan, shall I start packing?

1414
01:36:38,523 --> 01:36:40,024
Don't give me that look.

1415
01:36:45,164 --> 01:36:46,186
I won't repeat this again.

1416
01:36:47,072 --> 01:36:48,688
You people have to stay out here,
until I say so.

1417
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:50,391
And you should do whatever
I ask you to do.

1418
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,812
People who have a problem,
let's fight it out.

1419
01:36:54,167 --> 01:36:55,860
You can come solo or as a group.

1420
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:58,336
I'm ready! Who's up for it?

1421
01:37:02,758 --> 01:37:04,871
Junga, no one should move from here.

1422
01:37:05,592 --> 01:37:08,074
-Hail, Sulthan.
-If someone moves, skin them alive.

1423
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:11,073
We're not bananas to peel our skin.

1424
01:37:14,086 --> 01:37:16,800
Hail Sulthan!

1425
01:37:17,079 --> 01:37:18,090
Hey, beastie-guard!

1426
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:20,633
Even Hanuman was not so faithful
to Lord Ram.

1427
01:37:20,993 --> 01:37:23,759
I became a rowdy by beating up
my school teacher.

1428
01:37:24,054 --> 01:37:25,232
At least respect my history!

1429
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:27,183
I'll beat you to pulp, damn it.

1430
01:37:27,289 --> 01:37:30,246
Every dog has its day!

1431
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:31,232
There's another option, damn it!

1432
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:32,256
There's an option!

1433
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:37,876
If everyone agrees to it.
I'll fight, Sulthan!

1434
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:38,886
I'll defeat him in the fight.

1435
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:40,464
How dare you fight, Sulthan?

1436
01:37:40,615 --> 01:37:41,856
You have to fight me first.

1437
01:37:47,276 --> 01:37:48,136
Hey, stop fighting!

1438
01:37:49,485 --> 01:37:50,754
I said, stop the bloody fight.

1439
01:37:53,022 --> 01:37:54,314
Why the hell are you guys fighting?

1440
01:38:02,014 --> 01:38:05,785
Sulthan, I really can't figure out
what's going on in your mind.

1441
01:38:08,267 --> 01:38:11,175
Why are you putting our men
through this hardship?

1442
01:38:11,706 --> 01:38:13,964
You're even putting the village
in hardship. Why?

1443
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:15,871
Are you doing this
for the sake of that girl?

1444
01:38:18,414 --> 01:38:19,023
It's for us!

1445
01:38:20,485 --> 01:38:21,422
It's for the sake of our family.

1446
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:23,528
What?

1447
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:28,082
Until yesterday,
I thought we'll return after 6 months.

1448
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:32,324
But today, I felt,
agriculture is the job for them.

1449
01:38:33,444 --> 01:38:34,674
If they're here,
no one will commit any crime.

1450
01:38:36,469 --> 01:38:37,777
We'll have to turn them into farmers.

1451
01:38:38,256 --> 01:38:40,582
Are you kidding, son?

1452
01:38:41,287 --> 01:38:42,339
They're leather-heads!

1453
01:38:43,436 --> 01:38:46,104
Son, you're day dreaming.

1454
01:38:46,435 --> 01:38:48,654
It's impossible.
They'll never change.

1455
01:38:49,309 --> 01:38:50,345
Drop this plan.

1456
01:38:50,867 --> 01:38:54,543
A person who has never seen any good,
tends to live a weary life.

1457
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:58,672
Just show them the good way of life,
they'll live it better than us.

1458
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:02,090
Give me six months time.

1459
01:39:03,462 --> 01:39:04,384
If they still don't change...

1460
01:39:06,069 --> 01:39:08,051
I'll drop everything and return to Mumbai.

1461
01:39:09,007 --> 01:39:10,722
Do you think they'll agree to it?

1462
01:39:12,734 --> 01:39:13,953
Don't let them know about it.

1463
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:16,019
Let them think,
I'm doing this for that girl.

1464
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,239
That's not the issue at hand.

1465
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:21,105
Then?

1466
01:39:22,702 --> 01:39:26,446
If we stay back in this village,
we'll have to resort to violence.

1467
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:31,739
To change them, we should make sure
they don't resort to violence.

1468
01:39:34,856 --> 01:39:36,563
I'm not sure,
how I am going to handle both the notions.

1469
01:40:00,817 --> 01:40:02,817
Grandpa, who is he?

1470
01:40:23,963 --> 01:40:25,569
Grandpa, Sulthan has arrived.

1471
01:41:01,507 --> 01:41:03,719
Wow! Ravanan!

1472
01:41:05,305 --> 01:41:06,875
100-Head-Ravanan!

1473
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:08,278
Jayendran, said so.

1474
01:41:09,202 --> 01:41:10,238
I didn't believe him.

1475
01:41:10,922 --> 01:41:12,129
You lived up to your reputation.

1476
01:41:13,397 --> 01:41:15,465
I am Ravanan too.

1477
01:41:15,968 --> 01:41:18,394
Just that, I got only one head.

1478
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:24,973
Not an issue though.
Money can buy as many men I want.

1479
01:41:25,477 --> 01:41:28,110
So... money matters!

1480
01:41:29,196 --> 01:41:31,583
What did this village offer you?

1481
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:33,946
I'll make an offer way more
than they offered.

1482
01:41:34,235 --> 01:41:38,254
You and your henchmen,
should work for me.

1483
01:41:38,563 --> 01:41:41,692
Not even a strand of grass
should grow on this land.

1484
01:41:43,594 --> 01:41:44,683
They're not rowdies.

1485
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:46,631
But my brothers!

1486
01:41:47,773 --> 01:41:50,766
Fine, name your price,
and I'll honor that.

1487
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:54,637
I want this land and that mountain.

1488
01:41:54,922 --> 01:41:57,078
You have to work for me.

1489
01:42:09,655 --> 01:42:11,139
Land and mountain.
Is that all you need?

1490
01:42:11,756 --> 01:42:12,400
I'll ask them to give it to you.

1491
01:42:17,967 --> 01:42:19,309
How does 6 feet sound to you?

1492
01:42:21,272 --> 01:42:24,422
Powerful, doesn't mean you should
make more enemies.

1493
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:30,024
Here on, make sure to keep a count
on your brothers.

1494
01:42:31,101 --> 01:42:34,233
Next time I meet you,
I won't be civil.

1495
01:42:34,326 --> 01:42:34,939
Hey!

1496
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:36,643
How dare you lay hands on Sulthan?

1497
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:39,854
-I dare you!
-Say the word, I'll break his skull.

1498
01:42:40,054 --> 01:42:41,696
Sulthan, I'll hack him into pieces.

1499
01:42:52,861 --> 01:42:54,399
This village has only witnessed my anger.

1500
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:56,694
They haven't seen the rage of my brothers.

1501
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,516
Don't instigate them!

1502
01:43:00,245 --> 01:43:02,016
This is their land and theirs only.

1503
01:43:03,012 --> 01:43:06,313
Just listening to their woes,
I beat up a person to death.

1504
01:43:06,901 --> 01:43:08,188
Now I've witnessed it myself.

1505
01:43:08,744 --> 01:43:10,093
I'll kill you, damn it!

1506
01:43:10,595 --> 01:43:11,664
Don't you dare return.

1507
01:43:12,562 --> 01:43:13,602
I'll be right here.

1508
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:23,469
He went overboard, sir.

1509
01:43:23,753 --> 01:43:25,758
The arrogance comes from
the support of 100 people.

1510
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:27,915
We should break his support.

1511
01:43:28,517 --> 01:43:31,672
The 100 people are not supporting him.

1512
01:43:32,494 --> 01:43:35,321
It's him who's supporting an army!

1513
01:43:36,971 --> 01:43:40,101
You shouldn't cut the tail
of a snake to kill it.

1514
01:43:40,963 --> 01:43:42,131
You have to smash the snake's head.

1515
01:43:42,948 --> 01:43:44,664
I want to smash his head!

1516
01:44:02,706 --> 01:44:04,566
Hey, they're extremely dangerous than us.

1517
01:44:04,918 --> 01:44:06,254
Be careful.

1518
01:44:06,441 --> 01:44:08,019
If they wake up,
they'll tear us part.

1519
01:44:12,196 --> 01:44:16,137
Our target is the person
lying on that cot...

1520
01:44:16,421 --> 01:44:17,839
we have to behead him.

1521
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:42,447
Hey, watch your step.

1522
01:44:56,951 --> 01:44:58,651
Wait, if he wakes up,
he'll make noise.

1523
01:44:58,804 --> 01:45:00,107
We'll gag and stab him.

1524
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,911
Hey, let's slit the throat directly.

1525
01:45:04,352 --> 01:45:07,111
It's best to gag him first, then slit--

1526
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:10,493
Hey, you guys should've planned it
before you got here.

1527
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:18,814
I've deprived them of blood
for past two months.

1528
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:22,548
If they wake up,
you guys will end up dead.

1529
01:45:24,431 --> 01:45:26,908
No matter what happens,
make sure it's done in silence.

1530
01:45:28,376 --> 01:45:29,021
Understood?

1531
01:45:54,353 --> 01:45:55,268
Silence!

1532
01:48:47,839 --> 01:48:49,830
Sir, please spare him.

1533
01:48:49,972 --> 01:48:52,635
Sir, please don't hit me.
I beg of you.

1534
01:48:52,744 --> 01:48:56,029
Please don't beat him.
He might die.

1535
01:49:00,127 --> 01:49:02,281
Oh, no, please someone stop him!

1536
01:49:05,057 --> 01:49:06,354
Please spare him!

1537
01:49:07,081 --> 01:49:07,822
Michael!

1538
01:49:08,707 --> 01:49:10,768
Michael, let go of him.
Please hear me out.

1539
01:49:10,847 --> 01:49:12,253
Michael, let go of him.

1540
01:49:14,407 --> 01:49:16,761
Michael, let him go.
Can't you hear me?

1541
01:49:16,878 --> 01:49:18,839
I said, let go of him. Let go!

1542
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,472
How many more are you going to kill?
Why don't you listen?

1543
01:49:22,697 --> 01:49:25,261
I told you so, that this day will come.

1544
01:49:25,675 --> 01:49:28,230
No can stand up to them,
even if they harass our women.

1545
01:49:28,417 --> 01:49:30,008
I wonder what else is left
to endure.

1546
01:49:31,629 --> 01:49:34,683
-He would've died if he hadn't stopped him.

1547
01:49:48,257 --> 01:49:50,176
This village feared the rowdies.

1548
01:49:50,827 --> 01:49:52,770
Recently, they've come to terms
and started respecting us.

1549
01:49:53,643 --> 01:49:54,289
And you--

1550
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,642
Uncle, Michael, shouldn't be here anymore.

1551
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:01,056
Ask him to leave.

1552
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,304
Sulthan, I don't think so--

1553
01:50:03,424 --> 01:50:04,540
I don't care, ask him to leave!

1554
01:50:05,734 --> 01:50:06,891
I don't want to see his face anymore.

1555
01:50:09,204 --> 01:50:11,517
I'll kill him, if I do. Get lost!

1556
01:50:27,123 --> 01:50:27,696
Sul--

1557
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:32,573
Sulthan.

1558
01:50:33,888 --> 01:50:35,821
I'll apologize on behalf of Michael.

1559
01:50:36,538 --> 01:50:38,235
Michael wouldn't have done it
without a reason.

1560
01:50:38,562 --> 01:50:40,798
I'm sure he had his reasons
to beat up that boy.

1561
01:50:42,772 --> 01:50:45,290
You've already humiliated him
in front of the village.

1562
01:50:46,717 --> 01:50:48,728
Sulthan, please forgive him.

1563
01:50:49,578 --> 01:50:52,015
Why are you hesitating?
Go and tell him!

1564
01:50:55,304 --> 01:50:56,069
Brother!

1565
01:50:58,105 --> 01:51:01,675
Sir, he didn't do anything wrong.

1566
01:51:01,967 --> 01:51:06,064
It was that boy who tried harassing
my daughter.

1567
01:51:06,631 --> 01:51:10,452
He came as a guardian angel
and saved my daughter.

1568
01:51:12,171 --> 01:51:15,462
That's right, brother.
Despite getting beaten up by you...

1569
01:51:15,797 --> 01:51:20,362
he remained silent to save my honor.

1570
01:51:36,855 --> 01:51:37,655
I acted in haste.

1571
01:51:39,957 --> 01:51:40,652
I'm sorry, Michael!

1572
01:52:09,451 --> 01:52:10,953
You've been with us
for so many years.

1573
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:13,961
Sulthan, with no regards,
asked you to leave.

1574
01:52:14,405 --> 01:52:15,584
We won't matter to him at all.

1575
01:52:16,123 --> 01:52:19,255
After Chief's demise,
whether it's the gang or to me...

1576
01:52:20,037 --> 01:52:20,872
you're our leader!

1577
01:52:21,907 --> 01:52:25,842
It doesn't look good, when you're
getting beaten up in front of us.

1578
01:52:26,633 --> 01:52:28,087
It's extremely humiliating!

1579
01:52:31,814 --> 01:52:35,638
Michael, a Lion can lead a herd of goats.

1580
01:52:36,025 --> 01:52:40,038
But, Michael, a goat shouldn't
be a leader to a herd of lions!

1581
01:52:55,698 --> 01:52:59,387
Hey, wake up everyone!

1582
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:18,144
Sulthan, look,
how beautifully it has grown.

1583
01:53:31,012 --> 01:53:33,223
The yield has been great this time.

1584
01:53:33,325 --> 01:53:34,756
I never expected it.

1585
01:53:34,801 --> 01:53:36,129
Can't believe the rowdies
made this possible.

1586
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:43,075
-Son!
-Sir, please don't, you're an elder.

1587
01:53:43,364 --> 01:53:47,708
Son, many lives were lost,
to see our lands bloom with green.

1588
01:53:48,036 --> 01:53:49,802
You appeared as a God to us!

1589
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:53,974
I thought I'll never get to
see this before I die.

1590
01:53:54,309 --> 01:53:58,466
When I met you the first time,
I knew you'll be our savior.

1591
01:53:58,732 --> 01:53:59,747
And it came true.

1592
01:53:59,896 --> 01:54:02,834
Thanks a lot, son. Stay blessed!

1593
01:54:05,728 --> 01:54:07,463
Thanks a lot, sir.

1594
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,129
Come on, partner.
This is our village.

1595
01:54:22,809 --> 01:54:26,660
I wanted to speak to you...

1596
01:54:26,916 --> 01:54:27,513
Tell me.

1597
01:54:51,057 --> 01:54:52,987
Cowards! Bloody traitors!

1598
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,666
This is a 10,000 crore project.

1599
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:58,236
Canceling it was the only option left.

1600
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:00,821
You promised to prevent them
from carrying out agriculture.

1601
01:55:00,962 --> 01:55:01,807
Did you do it?

1602
01:55:02,153 --> 01:55:04,066
The village is blooming with greenery.

1603
01:55:04,489 --> 01:55:07,241
If we try to prove that the lands
are barren, we'll be doomed.

1604
01:55:07,676 --> 01:55:08,929
Maybe I can work something out.

1605
01:55:09,581 --> 01:55:11,941
I've postponed the inspection
one too many times.

1606
01:55:12,564 --> 01:55:15,793
For your sake,
one last time I'll postpone it.

1607
01:55:16,506 --> 01:55:18,551
Use that time to prove that
the lands are barren.

1608
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:21,934
After which we can discuss further
about the project.

1609
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:30,080
[henchmen singing folk song]

1610
01:55:38,581 --> 01:55:44,104
[song resumes]

1611
01:55:51,052 --> 01:55:53,417
Hey, don't change the mood.

1612
01:56:01,192 --> 01:56:02,628
I wanted to speak to you.

1613
01:56:03,976 --> 01:56:06,159
-I wanted to speak to you.
-Hey, shut up, guys.

1614
01:56:07,554 --> 01:56:09,885
[continues to sing]

1615
01:56:10,009 --> 01:56:10,955
Awesome!

1616
01:56:11,408 --> 01:56:14,103
-Idiot, shut up!
-Bloody, nuisance!

1617
01:56:14,245 --> 01:56:15,306
Hey, shut up!

1618
01:56:17,005 --> 01:56:17,638
You please go ahead.

1619
01:56:19,365 --> 01:56:21,518
The entire village is happy.

1620
01:56:23,154 --> 01:56:26,669
The village folks respects you a lot.

1621
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:30,682
But I didn't treat you well.

1622
01:56:31,365 --> 01:56:32,130
Sorry!

1623
01:56:32,476 --> 01:56:33,761
Come on, don't bother.

1624
01:56:35,148 --> 01:56:39,690
I'll take care of all the household chores.

1625
01:56:40,714 --> 01:56:44,313
But... I won't shift to in-laws' house.

1626
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:48,776
Neither I'll go to America or Bombay.

1627
01:56:49,761 --> 01:56:51,956
I'll stay right here at my village.

1628
01:56:53,002 --> 01:56:55,677
If you're fine with it.
I'm okay with it too.

1629
01:56:56,674 --> 01:56:57,462
Okay, eh?

1630
01:56:58,151 --> 01:56:59,151
What's she saying?

1631
01:57:07,637 --> 01:57:08,762
I really don't get it.

1632
01:57:08,993 --> 01:57:11,919
Sulthan, she agreed to marry you.

1633
01:57:16,176 --> 01:57:18,401
Listen, I'm okay with it too!

1634
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:23,934
The entire village has come together
to ask my daughter's hand in marriage.

1635
01:57:24,597 --> 01:57:26,919
I'm sure, I can't find
a better match than him.

1636
01:57:27,278 --> 01:57:28,370

Hey, Junga, why are we at the
registrar office?

1684
02:01:46,133 --> 02:01:46,946
I have no idea, master.

1685
02:01:49,297 --> 02:01:52,051
Hey, advocate. What brings you here?

1686
02:01:52,388 --> 02:01:55,490
Mansoor, I think you'll leave me
with no job.

1687
02:01:55,633 --> 02:01:56,356
I don't get you?

1688
02:01:56,703 --> 02:02:01,332
Sulthan, has bought 2 acres of land
for each one of you.

1689
02:02:01,697 --> 02:02:03,557
Land? How did he manage to
pay for them?

1690
02:02:03,727 --> 02:02:07,478
He had to sell one house in Vizag
to pay for them.

1691
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:09,774
-Did he really sold the house?
-Yes!

1692
02:02:10,094 --> 02:02:11,626
Uncle, I hope you're happy!

1693
02:02:11,969 --> 02:02:13,039
We bought land in the heaven

1694
02:02:13,258 --> 02:02:14,932
Son, this is not right.

1695
02:02:15,509 --> 02:02:17,579
That was the only property your dad had
left behind for you.

1696
02:02:17,835 --> 02:02:18,668
Why did you?

1697
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,640
What dad left behind is not wealth...

1698
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:22,322
but you people are my treasure.

1699
02:02:24,385 --> 02:02:25,287
Not just that.

1700
02:02:25,655 --> 02:02:29,053
Despite me telling him not to,
he used up all his savings for it.

1701
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:30,462
Sir, please go and do your job.

1702
02:02:30,555 --> 02:02:31,938
-Son, I'm stating the fact.
-Sir, you please leave.

1703
02:02:32,423 --> 02:02:34,346
Hey, why did you do it?

1704
02:02:34,401 --> 02:02:35,555
Uncle, it's not a big deal.

1705
02:02:35,788 --> 02:02:38,409
You had saved up to start
your own company.

1706
02:02:38,649 --> 02:02:39,821
It's just money.

1707
02:02:40,571 --> 02:02:43,329
It's true, I'll have to slave
under someone for a decade.

1708
02:02:43,664 --> 02:02:44,352
I don't care.

1709
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:46,907
But my brothers won't indulge
in violence anymore.

1710
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:49,305
And no one will call them
rowdies anymore.

1711
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,126
They're now bosses.
In fact, farmers!

1712
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,242
"You raise him well."

1713
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:12,266
"And he'll look after you."

1714
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:27,849
-Driver, the tire is punctured.

1715
02:03:28,232 --> 02:03:29,822
Everyone step out.
Board the next bus that follows.

1716
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:30,681
The tire is punctured.

1717
02:03:30,729 --> 02:03:31,960
Sulthan!

1718
02:03:32,201 --> 02:03:34,530
-The bus tire is punctured.
-The bus following us is ours too...

1719
02:03:34,671 --> 02:03:36,678
they won't ask for a ticket.
You board that bus.

1720
02:03:37,325 --> 02:03:38,803
Folks keep moving,

1721
02:03:39,936 --> 02:03:41,147
Hey, Sulthan!

1722
02:03:43,553 --> 02:03:44,888
Uncle!

1723
02:03:48,046 --> 02:03:49,576
-Master!
-Hey!

1724
02:04:02,525 --> 02:04:04,259
-Master? Master?
-Uncle!

1725
02:04:05,098 --> 02:04:07,496
Here you go, put pressure on it.

1726
02:04:07,867 --> 02:04:09,461
Driver, start the vehicle. Driver!

1727
02:04:09,574 --> 02:04:10,590
Master, you'll be fine!

1728
02:04:16,519 --> 02:04:18,517
Uncle, you'll be fine.
Junga, keep pressure on the wound.

1729
02:04:49,822 --> 02:04:51,025
-Hey, go!
-Come on, let's leave.

1730
02:04:54,941 --> 02:04:57,203
-Be careful, Master.
-I'm not able to walk.

1731
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,810
Uncle, you'll be fine.
Let's go the hospital.

1732
02:05:01,676 --> 02:05:02,473
Be careful!

1733
02:05:03,295 --> 02:05:05,848
-Junga, take care of him, I'll be back.
-Sulthan, wait!

1734
02:05:06,828 --> 02:05:08,420
I hope you didn't get hurt?

1735
02:05:08,513 --> 02:05:09,612
I'm not hurt, uncle.

1736
02:05:09,859 --> 02:05:10,811
Uncle, let's go to the hospital.

1737
02:05:11,045 --> 02:05:13,574
Hey, don't cry, Sulthan.

1738
02:05:14,051 --> 02:05:16,713
I should've died long ago.

1739
02:05:17,872 --> 02:05:19,896
I thought only death will
bring me peace.

1740
02:05:20,091 --> 02:05:20,569
But...

1741
02:05:23,292 --> 02:05:28,362
...the last 4 months,
I lived my life with peace and happiness.

1742
02:05:29,186 --> 02:05:30,674
Thanks to you.

1743
02:05:31,459 --> 02:05:33,909
This village is the right place for them.

1744
02:05:35,175 --> 02:05:36,809
They're ruffians and are big fools.

1745
02:05:37,319 --> 02:05:41,425
But, Sulthan, make sure you don't
abandon them.

1746
02:05:41,633 --> 02:05:42,882
I will never abandon them, uncle.

1747
02:05:43,522 --> 02:05:44,329
Hey, Junga!

1748
02:05:45,554 --> 02:05:47,160
Take good care of Sulthan.

1749
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:51,410
Su-- Sulthan, when you were born...

1750
02:05:52,202 --> 02:05:56,561
I wished that I should die saving you.

1751
02:05:57,536 --> 02:05:59,210
It has finally happened.

1752
02:05:59,964 --> 02:06:03,062
Uncle, please hear me out.
Let's go to the hospital.

1753
02:06:04,077 --> 02:06:05,058
Sulthan...

1754
02:06:13,218 --> 02:06:13,764
Uncle.

1755
02:06:15,827 --> 02:06:16,444
Uncle.

1756
02:06:17,656 --> 02:06:18,312
Uncle!

1757
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:23,020
Uncle!

1758
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,585
Oh, God!

1759
02:06:31,587 --> 02:06:32,593
Oh, God!

1760
02:06:35,929 --> 02:06:37,223
Oh, no!

1761
02:06:46,215 --> 02:06:48,044
Hey, isn't that our men?

1762
02:06:48,755 --> 02:06:51,096
That's Junga and Sulthan.

1763
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:52,441
Mansoor Bhai!

1764
02:06:54,386 --> 02:06:56,355
-Sulthan!
-Mansoor Bhai!

1765
02:06:56,709 --> 02:06:59,403
Bhai!
Mansoor Bhai!

1766
02:06:59,793 --> 02:07:01,386
Mansoor Bhai!

1767
02:08:00,996 --> 02:08:02,588
-Hello.
-Sulthan.

1768
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:05,893
-Sorry, Sulthan.

1769
02:08:05,998 --> 02:08:08,193
I heard the head-honcho has fallen!

1770
02:08:08,623 --> 02:08:12,619
Come on, you should've been more careful
in taking care of your brothers.

1771
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:16,268
Until now, I was not aware of
your weakness.

1772
02:08:16,498 --> 02:08:18,518
I am aware now!

1773
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:26,756
The troop of elephants that support you
are your weakness.

1774
02:08:27,092 --> 02:08:29,443
Police problem. Encounter!

1775
02:08:29,663 --> 02:08:31,967
-Your notion to reform them.

1776
02:08:32,483 --> 02:08:35,131
I have all the information on you
and your people.

1777
02:08:35,348 --> 02:08:36,975
-Obviously, I can't keep calm
after knowing it all.

1778
02:08:37,342 --> 02:08:41,092
So, I've thrown a stone at your beehive.

1779
02:08:49,282 --> 02:08:51,439
-What you were afraid of...

1780
02:08:51,947 --> 02:08:53,435
is about to happen.

1781
02:08:54,756 --> 02:08:56,447
You'll regret, damn it!

1782
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:11,144
Stop!

1783
02:09:12,128 --> 02:09:14,863
-Where are you headed?
-Sulthan, let us go. He has to die!

1784
02:09:15,089 --> 02:09:19,197
Sulthan, we'll be at peace only
if we hack him down to death.

1785
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:20,495
Let's finish the final rites.

1786
02:09:21,136 --> 02:09:22,316
Be calm. Go!

1787
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:24,440
Calm? How do you expect us
to be calm?

1788
02:09:24,604 --> 02:09:26,058
One of us is dead.

1789
02:09:26,182 --> 02:09:28,449
We'll have to behead and kill him.

1790
02:09:28,939 --> 02:09:31,205
Killing him won't bring back, Bhai.

1791
02:09:32,205 --> 02:09:33,650
Brother, you too are talking nonsense.

1792
02:09:33,839 --> 02:09:34,987
Brother, please get back.
Brother, get back!

1793
02:09:35,097 --> 02:09:36,470
Sulthan, I won't. Not possible!

1794
02:09:36,775 --> 02:09:38,923
Only after his death,
the final rites will be carried out.

1795
02:09:40,683 --> 02:09:42,933
Go! Go and hack him to death.

1796
02:09:43,957 --> 02:09:45,261
Just like this, you must've killed many.

1797
02:09:45,947 --> 02:09:47,673
They too had families that cared.

1798
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:50,299
You people are outraged,
'cause one of your own died.

1799
02:09:53,525 --> 02:09:55,447
We reap what we sow!

1800
02:09:56,925 --> 02:09:58,355
This is not happening.

1801
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,120
One of us has been killed.

1802
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:03,565
Instead of letting us take down
that murderer...

1803
02:10:04,003 --> 02:10:05,627
you've been lecturing us about morals.

1804
02:10:06,112 --> 02:10:07,206
You're the reason for everything.

1805
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:11,223
If you had let us kill him on that day...

1806
02:10:11,402 --> 02:10:12,675
Bhai would've been alive, today.

1807
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:13,941
Kasi, don't!

1808
02:10:14,356 --> 02:10:16,371
Why do you care who dies among us?

1809
02:10:17,622 --> 02:10:20,488
To you this village and that girl
are important.

1810
02:10:20,872 --> 02:10:25,137
Aren't we your slaves who live
at your mercy?

1811
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:28,027
You've destroyed our gang,
for the sake of one girl.

1812
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:29,988
Do you people still wish to
follow his orders?

1813
02:10:30,667 --> 02:10:32,604
-Let's go!
-Can't you hear me?

1814
02:10:32,926 --> 02:10:34,129
Don't you understand, damn it?

1815
02:10:34,285 --> 02:10:35,293
You guys keep resorting to violence.

1816
02:10:35,379 --> 02:10:36,191
Stop, damn it!

1817
02:10:47,772 --> 02:10:49,628
He didn't say anything wrong.

1818
02:10:51,012 --> 02:10:52,074
We are going!

1819
02:10:53,028 --> 02:10:54,702
If you don't approve it.

1820
02:10:54,879 --> 02:10:56,964
Then let's fight it out.

1821
02:10:57,862 --> 02:11:01,640
Let the fight decide,
whether we should kill him or not.

1822
02:11:08,649 --> 02:11:11,608
The loser should follow the orders
from the winner.

1823
02:11:12,213 --> 02:11:14,280
Come on, let's fight it out!

1824
02:11:15,025 --> 02:11:16,843
Michael, have you gone mad?

1825
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,296
How dare you challenge him for a fight?

1826
02:11:18,553 --> 02:11:19,656
Did you forget that it's our, Sulthan?

1827
02:11:19,806 --> 02:11:21,779
What? Our Sulthan?

1828
02:11:22,049 --> 02:11:25,323
Bloody, he got the man killed
who named him, Sulthan.

1829
02:11:26,326 --> 02:11:27,765
Sulthan, my foot!

1830
02:11:30,622 --> 02:11:32,017
You guys have to go through me.

1831
02:11:32,727 --> 02:11:33,271
Junga!

1832
02:11:39,489 --> 02:11:45,849
Michael!

1833
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:50,175
Michael!

1834
02:12:50,416 --> 02:12:51,017
Come on!

1835
02:12:51,877 --> 02:12:53,971
Michael, we gotta win!

1836
02:13:15,756 --> 02:13:16,392
Come on, damn it!

1837
02:13:17,187 --> 02:13:18,244
Come on, fight me!

1838
02:13:19,227 --> 02:13:19,995
Come on!

1839
02:13:21,904 --> 02:13:22,732
Come on!

1840
02:13:26,925 --> 02:13:27,731
Michael!

1841
02:13:30,173 --> 02:13:31,578
Michael, we're leaving.
Finish the fight sooner.

1842
02:14:57,594 --> 02:14:58,272
Yeah!

1843
02:15:34,989 --> 02:15:40,224
Come, Sulthan. Hey, make way for him.

1844
02:15:40,406 --> 02:15:42,503
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1845
02:15:43,165 --> 02:15:44,036
I'll kill you, damn it!

1846
02:15:44,478 --> 02:15:46,337
If you touch him,
he might not rest in peace.

1847
02:15:46,463 --> 02:15:46,947
Get lost!

1848
02:15:48,087 --> 02:15:49,181
Hey, lift him up.

1849
02:16:13,412 --> 02:16:14,558
There's nothing left to stay back.

1850
02:16:15,926 --> 02:16:16,681
I'm leaving.

1851
02:16:19,583 --> 02:16:22,270
-Hey, hear me out.
Where are you guys going?

1852
02:16:22,387 --> 02:16:23,958
Hey, we're leaving!

1853
02:16:24,115 --> 02:16:26,488
Hey, don't abandon, Sulthan.

1854
02:16:26,702 --> 02:16:27,316
Hey!

1855
02:16:29,079 --> 02:16:29,849
Hey, listen!

1856
02:16:30,823 --> 02:16:34,940
Hey, Naga, at least you stay back.
Please don't leave.

1857
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:39,060
-Hey Sambasivam,
at least you listen to me.

1858
02:16:39,182 --> 02:16:41,919
Hey! Oh, no, everyone is leaving.

1859
02:16:42,033 --> 02:16:44,544
-Guys please stay back.

1860
02:16:44,676 --> 02:16:46,844
Hey, Kasi, please don't leave.

1861
02:16:53,735 --> 02:16:56,785
Sulthan, everyone has abandoned us.

1862
02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:58,452
You too leave, brother.

1863
02:16:58,816 --> 02:16:59,505
Sulthan?

1864
02:17:00,083 --> 02:17:01,356
They might do something rash
in haste.

1865
02:17:02,894 --> 02:17:03,779
Take care of them.

1866
02:17:24,103 --> 02:17:24,995
Uncle.

1867
02:17:27,931 --> 02:17:29,830
Since morning
you haven't eaten anything.

1868
02:17:34,456 --> 02:17:35,291
Don't feel like it.

1869
02:17:36,853 --> 02:17:37,491
I'm not hungry.

1870
02:17:38,349 --> 02:17:39,124
I mean...

1871
02:17:44,104 --> 02:17:45,174
Let's go, dear.

1872
02:17:51,143 --> 02:17:52,877
What? Are you serious?

1873
02:17:53,527 --> 02:17:55,701
So, there's no one with him?

1874
02:17:55,882 --> 02:17:57,513
No, sir. He's all alone.

1875
02:18:06,565 --> 02:18:09,158
My time has come!

1876
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:14,532
Tonight that village should be in flames.

1877
02:18:28,853 --> 02:18:30,993
They can't be away from you.

1878
02:18:32,376 --> 02:18:33,656
They'll soon come back to you.

1879
02:18:34,988 --> 02:18:36,421
I've never seen my mother.

1880
02:18:37,268 --> 02:18:38,216
I was raised by them.

1881
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:44,076
And I beat them up with
my own hands.

1882
02:18:45,134 --> 02:18:46,981
If I hadn't meddled,
Bhai would've been alive.

1883
02:18:49,385 --> 02:18:51,115
In the process of reforming them...

1884
02:18:52,471 --> 02:18:53,489
I've ended everything.

1885
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:04,689
Hello.

1886
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:06,416
Ravanan!

1887
02:19:07,586 --> 02:19:11,699
Did you think that I feared you
and went in hiding?

1888
02:19:11,994 --> 02:19:15,185
I went around the nation
scouting for people...

1889
02:19:15,264 --> 02:19:21,324
and was in penance for 5 months
to take down you and your people.

1890
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:23,030
Be ready to face me.

1891
02:19:23,376 --> 02:19:28,851
Every living soul in that village...

1892
02:19:29,247 --> 02:19:32,315
I'm going to either burn or bury them.

1893
02:19:32,758 --> 02:19:35,137
At the break of dawn...

1894
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,214
that village would've been destroyed,

1895
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:41,466
and you'll be beheaded!

1896
02:19:41,766 --> 02:19:43,560
I'm coming, damn it!

1897
02:19:49,345 --> 02:19:50,211
What happened?

1898
02:19:56,064 --> 02:19:58,568
Son, your men have left.

1899
02:19:58,751 --> 02:20:00,692
You're just one person,
what can you do?

1900
02:20:00,852 --> 02:20:02,758
Our village is their target.

1901
02:20:02,939 --> 02:20:06,161
We'll leave it to the God.
Son, you please leave.

1902
02:20:06,501 --> 02:20:08,845
You came from nowhere
and wished to save our land.

1903
02:20:09,266 --> 02:20:10,739
Looks like it's not going to happen now.

1904
02:20:10,992 --> 02:20:11,957
It's better you leave.

1905
02:20:12,454 --> 02:20:16,278
I see you as my own son,
who I lost a while ago.

1906
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,942
You're my son too.

1907
02:20:18,886 --> 02:20:20,676
At least, you should live your life.

1908
02:20:21,468 --> 02:20:22,567
Please, go!

1909
02:20:24,062 --> 02:20:26,575
Son, you don't have to stay back
for our sake.

1910
02:20:26,931 --> 02:20:29,172
You've lost too much
for the sake of this village.

1911
02:20:29,461 --> 02:20:30,054
Enough!

1912
02:20:31,391 --> 02:20:33,851
Please leave.
Go away and lead a peaceful life.

1913
02:20:37,283 --> 02:20:39,236
"If you make a promise...

1914
02:20:41,587 --> 02:20:44,043
in order to keep up that promise

1915
02:20:45,923 --> 02:20:48,269
we can even sacrifice our lives

1916
02:20:49,924 --> 02:20:52,515
also, we can kill as many if required."

1917
02:20:59,013 --> 02:21:02,141
My father made a promise to this village.

1918
02:21:03,358 --> 02:21:06,145
To save the land and the folks
that bears it.

1919
02:21:07,334 --> 02:21:10,279
My father may not be alive.
But his promise is still alive and kicking.

1920
02:21:11,489 --> 02:21:14,066
And to fulfill it, his son is still alive.

1921
02:21:15,685 --> 02:21:19,833
If I had to, I'd die to fulfill
the promise.

1922
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:27,791
I swear on this village!

1923
02:21:38,917 --> 02:21:40,869
-He's going to face them alone.

1924
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,252
I have to be with him.
You folks leave.

1925
02:21:43,690 --> 02:21:44,338
Be careful.

1926
02:22:10,844 --> 02:22:12,023
Just like you wished.

1927
02:22:12,867 --> 02:22:15,500
The rice harvested from this land
will be served at our wedding.

1928
02:22:17,031 --> 02:22:19,421
Don't worry. Nothing will happen
to your village.

1929
02:22:20,539 --> 02:22:22,081
Nothing should happen to you as well.

1930
02:22:27,188 --> 02:22:28,104
Be strong and go safe.

1931
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:34,903
Hey!

1932
02:24:36,597 --> 02:24:39,318
Not even a strand of grass
should be left out.

1933
02:24:40,214 --> 02:24:41,316
Burn it all!

1934
02:26:41,594 --> 02:26:43,617
Junga!

1935
02:27:26,968 --> 02:27:29,085
Sulthan, he's about to start the truck.

1936
02:27:29,203 --> 02:27:30,406
Don't let him go. Stop him!

1937
02:29:18,225 --> 02:29:19,099
Jayaendra!

1938
02:30:17,303 --> 02:30:19,736
I'll see what are you going to do now.

1939
02:30:20,455 --> 02:30:23,029
Go ahead and burn down
this village to ashes!

1940
02:30:26,542 --> 02:30:29,529
Junga, until we're alive...

1941
02:30:30,565 --> 02:30:33,804
no one should get past us
and step on this land.

1942
02:30:35,626 --> 02:30:37,310
Hail Sulthan!

1943
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:17,724
The warriors have arrived!

1944
02:31:29,209 --> 02:31:31,114
I dare you to face them now!

1945
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:36,168
Sulthan, I acted in haste.

1946
02:31:36,516 --> 02:31:37,367
Please forgive me.

1947
02:31:38,524 --> 02:31:40,300
I wished to become the leader.

1948
02:31:41,897 --> 02:31:45,890
But now I understood,
the traits of a leader.

1949
02:31:47,290 --> 02:31:48,509
Please forgive me, Sulthan.

1950
02:31:50,756 --> 02:31:52,506
We knew only after the
advocate told us.

1951
02:31:53,735 --> 02:31:54,919
You're our God!

1952
02:32:13,285 --> 02:32:16,988
Sulthan, I believe we shouldn't
fight as rowdies.

1953
02:32:18,356 --> 02:32:20,114
But we can fight as farmers!
