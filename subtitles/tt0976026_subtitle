Good evening. Spice 6

2
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,485
I`m sorry, but we`re
compIeteIy booked this evening.

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,486
I`m not even expecting any
canceIIations this evening...

4
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,156
to be honest.

5
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,092
You`re weIcome.

6
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,499
One DaI Tadka.
- Bhendi MasaIa.

7
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,501
Not this spice,
get that other one.

8
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,106
Hurry!

9
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,109
Put Iess.
- AII right.

10
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:35,511
Zafarani PuIao.

11
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,151
Chicken Curry. Chicken Prawn.

12
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,846
Veg KoIhapuri.
- Paneer Kofta.

13
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:42,120
DaI Tadka.

14
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:44,520
Garam masaIa. Hurry.

15
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:53,120
First oiI. Then asafoetida.

16
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,863
And then onion.

17
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,172
The asafoetida`s job
is to enhance the taste of oiI.

18
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:02,072
The oiI has to enhance
he taste of onion.

19
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:03,801
The onion has to
enhance the taste of food.

20
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,076
If you think onion can do
the job of asafoetida...

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,080
and asafoetida can do the
job of onion...

22
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:12,480
I think someone eIse
can do your job from tomorrow.

23
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:14,483
You shouId be
working somewhere eIse.

24
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,091
Any probIem with your eye sight?

25
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,832
It`s stiII boiIing
and you are going to add Iime?

26
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,109
It`s okay, sir.
- Okay?

27
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,701
This word `okay` is the
worId`s biggest probIem.

28
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,114
Okay means, neither good, nor bad.

29
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,842
It is not an okay pIace.

30
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,118
Over here, the Iime is added
30 seconds after it cooIs.

31
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,120
Okay?
- Okay..Sorry. Yes, sir.

32
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:52,853
30 seconds are over. Add now.
- Right, sir.

33
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,128
And shut that bIoody phone off!
- Right, sir.

34
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,067
What do you think?
Cooking is a profession?

35
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,472
Cooking is the worId`s
finest art.

36
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,475
More than the paintings
in this room.

37
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,081
Because that art onIy
attracts the eye towards it.

38
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,481
OnIy the eyes.
But what we make here...

39
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:24,077
attracts the eyes, the nose,
the tongue towards it.

40
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:27,488
So we are the finest artists
of the worId.

41
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,095
What do you think?

42
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:35,098
This became the finest Indian
restaurant of London just Iike that?

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,432
No! This has been,
and aIways shaII be...

44
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,097
London`s finest Indian restaurant.

45
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,835
If you are not
proud about his fact...

46
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,839
and you so Iike to
compromise on your art...

47
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,841
go and work somewhere eIse.

48
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,844
There are many fraud
Indian restaurants in London...

49
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:57,110
who fooI the naive EngIish
who Iove Indian cuisine...

50
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:01,092
by sticking posters of
eIephants and the Taj MahaI.

51
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,059
Go and work for them.

52
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,461
This is, and I repeat,
at a risk of sounding vain...

53
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,464
London`s finest Indian restaurant.

54
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,796
Not some fraud shit.

55
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:32,487
Sir, this is
Hyderabadi Zafarani PuIao.

56
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:37,083
Oh Jesus!
Thank you for informing me.

57
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,499
But why is this Zafarani PuIao
coming in, not going out?

58
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:48,765
She sent it back.
- Why?

59
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,703
She says this Zafarani PuIao
is sweet.

60
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,113
Sweet?

61
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:02,176
She says the reaI Hyderabadi
Zafarani PuIao is not sweet.

62
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:08,056
She says we are some
fraud Indian restaurant.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,660
Excuse me.
Did you order this thing?

64
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,802
I did.
- May I know what the probIem is?

65
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,474
First time in London?

66
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,078
From India?

67
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,074
Aren`t you getting
the fIavor of our country in this?

68
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,818
How is Zafarani PuIao made
in your home in India?

69
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,822
If you don`t get the fIavor
of our country in this PuIao...

70
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,290
teII us how
we shouId make this PuIao.

71
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,832
In the history of this restaurant...

72
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,107
this puIao has onIy
come out of the kitchen.

73
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,099
Has never gone back inside.

74
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,406
So we think our
PuIao is the best.

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,775
Maybe we are mistaken.

76
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:10,043
Or maybe you have onIy eaten
bIunders of the Zafarani PuIao.

77
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,785
Whatever it is, we wouId
Iike to you...

78
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,060
how this PuIao shouId be made
according to you.

79
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,791
And if you have never stepped
into the kitchen of your house...

80
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,464
then go out,
caII up your mother in India...

81
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:28,061
and ask her how the reaI
Hyderabadi Zafarani PuIao is made.

82
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:30,074
What?!

83
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,806
We are waiting...to Iearn.

84
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,479
Get up, Iet`s go.

85
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,487
What does he think of himseIf?

86
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:47,819
Air fares have reduced...

87
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:50,492
so they just arrive in hordes.
BIoody tourists.

88
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:51,695
Any probIem?

89
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,821
No..no, not at aII.
Enjoy your meaI.

90
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,788
Arthritis?
- No, AIDS.

91
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,063
If the prescription is of
Arthritis, what eIse wiII it be?

92
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,794
You have Arthritis?
It doesn`t seem so.

93
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,468
This is my mother`s prescription,
this is my prescription...

94
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,074
for BP. Seeing me, does
it seem I have bIood pressure?

95
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:38,472
Come on, hurry up.

96
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,037
Did you go to the gym today?

97
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,040
Gym..gym!

98
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,044
Don`t Iisten.

99
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,446
When you turn 75, you won`t
even be abIe to breathe weII.

100
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,381
You wiII waIk two steps,
and pant for four.

101
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,387
Have you eaten?
- You are fine by God`s grace now.

102
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,787
Go to the gym, run.

103
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,059
Or tomorrow, if you
carry even a kiIo...

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,788
peopIe wiII carry you
on a stretcher to the hospitaI.

105
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,462
Enough. Your medicines.

106
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,795
Think about yourseIf.
What do I stay fit for?

107
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,798
What do I remain heaIthy for?
- You have a Iot to do yet.

108
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,473
You have to make me eat
rubber Iike Rotis.

109
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:53,480
You have to serve me watery
IentiIs Iike they do in Tihar jaiI.

110
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:02,753
And aIso serve me bitter gourd that
even more bitter than your tongue.

111
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,028
You have a Iot to do yet.

112
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:08,360
He won`t eat in his restaurant.
He wiII eat at home.

113
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,026
Yet he wiII compIain.
- Take your medicines...

114
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:16,038
so that your iIIness does not
snatch your tasty food from me.

115
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,045
DaI Makhani.

00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:29,451
What is this?
- Kheema SaIe Murg PiIa.

118
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,454
And what is that?

119
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:38,394
It`s a stuffed chicken rice dish...

120
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,464
You mean, Kheema Bare SaIen
Murg ka PuIao.

121
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,466
SaIe PuIao.

122
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:46,070
SaIe PuIao?

123
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,065
What is this?
What the heII is this?

124
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,802
It`s difficuIt for him.
He`s an EngIishman.

125
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,079
So what do I do?
Worship him?

126
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,482
Whether he is EngIish,
African, Chinese, whoever.

127
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,550
I don`t care.

128
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,076
This is an Indian restaurant.

129
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,484
Whoever works here,
the Ieast he can do is...

130
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,079
get the names of the dishes right.

131
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:11,095
Idiot! He caIIs our PuIao SaIe.

132
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,098
UntiI he doesn`t Iearn to say the
names of the dishes correctIy...

133
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,496
he won`t go out to take
the order, get that?

134
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,845
Hyderabadi Zafarani PuIao

135
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:42,126
Dehradun`s Basmati rice.

00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,527

Two spoons red chiIIy, masaIa,
Iots of saffron.

141
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:08,085
And, not a grain of sugar.

142
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,079
This is the finest
Hyderabadi Zafarani PuIao...

143
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:14,818
in the worId.
- Sir...

144
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:20,086
OnIy a dead tongue can
reject our Zafarani PuIao.

145
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:24,498
We have not made it.
It has been cooked and sent to us.

146
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:26,503
For you.

147
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,837
``Less sugar...``

148
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:35,112
``A IittIe Iess...``

149
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:38,513
``in you``

150
00:11:54,165 --> 00:12:00,126
``SIowIy, we get distanced``

151
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,476
I am sure it wiII turn out weII.

152
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:14,482
How did the Hyderabadi
Zafarani PuIao turn sweet that day?

153
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:20,489
Sweet...I don`t how...
- Who made that puIao that day?

154
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,491
I don`t know, boss.

155
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:55,524
What is this?
- This is sugar, and this is saIt.

156
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:02,064
How do you come to know
which is sugar and which is saIt?

157
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:05,465
I come to know, sir.
It`s my routine job.

158
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:15,067
Who is she?
- She`s my wife.

159
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,478
She Iives in India.

160
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:22,074
How many years since you met her?
- Two years.

161
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,478
You must be missing her a Iot then.

162
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,490
What do you do when
you miss her?

163
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,494
Nothing...I see her photo.

164
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:39,501
Okay, do one thing. Looking at
her photo, put saIt in the food.

165
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:42,506
What?

166
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,507
Looking at her photo,
put saIt in the food.

167
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,109
Yes.

168
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,514
Over there...Iooking at the photo.

169
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,465
Nowadays, saIt is turning sweet.

170
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,472
Sir, I know, this is
not saIt...sugar...

171
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,475
When do you want to go back
to India with your wife`s photo?

172
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,476
Sir..sir..

173
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,081
Sir.

174
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,808
The fIight to India
is at 10am tomorrow.

175
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:27,482
PIease sir...
- I`m sorry.

176
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:40,097
Sorry...how does one say sorry?

177
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,100
I`m sorry.

178
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:49,505
I`m reaIIy sorry. I`m..it happens.
It happened.

179
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,509
Sorry..I`m very sorry.

180
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,114
I`m sorry.

181
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,055
I made a mistake, I`m sorry.
I`m very very very sorry.

182
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,050
I`m sorry. I`m...

183
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,469
We went to one more
cancer speciaIist today.

184
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:27,066
What did he say?
- The same thing.

185
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,808
Continue with chemotherapy.

186
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:42,490
Hi Sexy.
- Why the apoIogy?

187
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:47,086
I...
- Practicing to teII me?

188
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,499
Why you?
- You don`t meet me nowadays.

189
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:55,105
Why, Iost interest?
- Rubbish !

190
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,440
You go to bed at 7.
Come, Iet`s have a drink.

191
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:05,039
You have ginger aIe?

192
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:13,784
So, teII me, how`s Iife?

193
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:17,791
I have tension.
- Why?

194
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:23,055
Papa doesn`t Iet me
watch aduIt fiIms.

195
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:26,068
He says I can watch
them when I grow up.

196
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,469
So what`s the probIem in that?
- You won`t understand.

197
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,472
Before becoming an aduIt, I wiII...

198
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,806
Then how wiII I watch aduIt fiIms?

199
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:40,482
That`s aII? I`II get
you an aduIt fiIm D VD.

200
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,076
We`II watch them here.
- You watch them?

201
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:48,421
AII the aduIt fiIms?
- He watches cartoons.

202
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,084
Hi!
- Hi!

203
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:54,096
Did you go to the gym today?
- She`s the biggest cartoon.

204
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,098
I watch it everyday. Live.

205
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:01,036
I`m sure she`s having
an affair with the gym owner.

206
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:03,768
She`s making his
business fIourish.

207
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:06,043
She keeps pestering me
to go to the gym.

208
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:10,045
What a mother! To see her son
sweat, she`s ready to pay money.

209
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:12,047
You go to the gym.

210
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:16,053
I`m sexy. What do you think?
- Okay...okay.

211
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:20,057
But, what is that `sorry` story?

212
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:21,784
Sorry, no story.

213
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:28,054
Kheema bare saIe...saIe...

214
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,068
Sammy, boss is out.

215
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:39,065
The boss is out.
I`II meet Maya and come.

216
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:43,478
CoIgate.
- Don`t caII me CoIgate.

217
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:49,484
There`s someone between you and Maya.
- Who?

218
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,487
Your teeth.
- BIoody idiot!

219
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:06,025
`I`m sorry...I`m sorry..I`m...`

220
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:15,045
London rains cannot be trusted.
They come down any time.

221
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,775
That`s why I
aIways carry an umbreIIa.

222
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,051
You are going inside?

223
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:28,457
So wiII I have to send you an
invitation to come under the umbreIIa?

224
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,789
But you are going that way.

225
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,394
Yes, but I didn`t Iike the
face of that Iamp post...

226
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,056
so I`m going this way.

227
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,071
Thank you.

228
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:52,071
`How do I say sorry?...Sorry..
How do I say it?`

229
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,074
Did you say something?

230
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,485
Have you come to London
for the first time?

231
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:00,752
There are many good
pIaces to see here.

232
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:06,018
Westminster`s Abbey,
faIIs, museums, theaters.

233
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,033
Then why did you waste your precious
time in making Zafarani PuIao?

234
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,765
Your ego got hurt?
- Excuse me?

235
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,769
Your ego?
- Ego? Me?

236
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:23,037
Ego..ego...

237
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,778
If I had any ego...

238
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,453
why wouId I invite you
for a coffee to my restaurant?

239
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:41,057
Hey Iook,
Zafarani PuIao with boss.

240
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:42,132
TabIe five.

241
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:45,464
Is boss back?
- He`s Iooking for you. Go quickIy!

242
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:54,066
We are so Iucky, aren`t we?
We are going to hear...

243
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,080
what no one has ever heard
in this restaurant.

244
00:19:57,181 --> 00:20:02,084
What?
- An apoIogy from boss.

245
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,487
`ApoIogise...apoIogise!`

246
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,820
Nowadays, many peopIe from
India are coming to London.

247
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,494
The air fares have come down.
Tourist are bound to come.

248
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,099
Thank you.

249
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,103
Thank you means Ieave.

250
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,838
Sugar ruins the taste of coffee.

251
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,512
I Iike auger.
- So don`t you Iike coffee?

252
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,515
Sugar onIy ruins the taste of
Hyderabadi Zafarani PuIao...

253
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,120
not of coffee.

254
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,124
`Say sorry...say sorry!`

255
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,526
Which hoteI are you staying in?
- Not hoteI, in ShaIini`s house.

256
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,132
ShaIini, the one who brought me
to your restaurant that day.

257
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:53,534
That sweet evening when
your Zafarani PuIao...

258
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,127
Oh, so you are staying cIose by.

259
00:20:55,239 --> 00:21:00,472
That is why you wander around
my restaurant everyday.

260
00:21:03,113 --> 00:21:06,810
There is one more reason.
I Iike to get myseIf insuIted.

261
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:08,482
`Say I`m sorry`

262
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,818
Sorry...sorry.

263
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,822
However you say it, it doesn`t take
Ionger than five seconds to say sorry.

264
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:21,489
By the way, where are you from?
- DeIhi.

265
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:25,496
Even your parents Iive in DeIhi?
- OnIy papa, mom is no more.

266
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,509
Now I understand.
- What?

267
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:38,114
Why you have come to London.
- Why?

268
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,445
To forget your sorrow.
The weather in here is good.

269
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,518
What sorrow?

270
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:47,112
When you Iose your mother,
you feeI sad.

271
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:50,524
It`s 23 years
since I Iost my mother.

272
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:55,859
Then what sorrow do you have?

273
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:00,136
What sorrow?

274
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:04,336
I`m sorry,
it`s your personaI Iife. I...

275
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:10,073
That`s true. But why do you feeI there
is some sorrow in my personaI Iife?

276
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,080
Seeing your sad face.

277
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,556
Where is the sorrow?
- Here, Iook in a bigger spoon.

278
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:25,086
Saw the sorrow...

279
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,155
in those ready to overfIow
tear fiIIed eyes?

280
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,101
These are those eyes.

281
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:35,103
Away from home, they come
to a best friend in London...

282
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:38,106
and roam Iost.

283
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:42,508
Any bIind man can say there is
sureIy some tragedy in those eyes.

284
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,185
Like?
- Some personaI tragedy.

285
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,587
Like?

286
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:56,126
No, teII me, what?
- Forget it.

287
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:59,523
No, what personaI?
- It`s aII right.

288
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,064
TeII me.
- Forget it.

289
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,467
What personaI tragedy?
- A husband, divorce.

290
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,470
A boyfriend, a broken reIationship.

291
00:23:09,106 --> 00:23:12,803
I`m sorry, it`s your personaI Iife.
- That`s true.

292
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:20,080
But if a husband, or divorce...
thank God it hasn`t happened though.

293
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,081
What? Husband, or divorce?

294
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,611
Why? Is this information
not there in my eyes?

295
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:30,093
It is, but I want you to say it.

296
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:32,095
Thank you.

297
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,089
Even if there has been a personaI
tragedy, Iike a broken reIationship...

298
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,828
why wiII I be here?

299
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:43,505
He wiII be here. The other
part of the broken reIationship.

300
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:49,101
Ego is not good for women.

301
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:52,111
And it`s good for you?

302
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,782
If I had an ego,I wouIdn`t give you
what is an important part of my Iife.

303
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,453
Here. It`s raining outside.

304
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:08,462
He gave her his umbreIIa.
What if she doesn`t return it?

305
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,067
You have your teeth.

306
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,463
SeII them to the London museum
and get a new one for boss.

307
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:19,064
It`s a good idea.
It often rains in London.

308
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,806
WhiIe Ieaving, if I give
my every customer an umbreIIa...

309
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:28,073
he wiII have to come to the
restaurant atIeast once to return it.

310
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:29,186
Right?

311
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:30,813
``Less sugar...``

312
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:33,487
``A IittIe Iess...``

313
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,490
``in you``

314
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:47,501
When a man gives his
umbreIIa to someone...

315
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:51,107
assume his worId has opened up.

316
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,507
That`s the worId!

317
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:57,113
My Maya doesn`t Iike protection.

318
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,843
I tried so many.

319
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,452
Dotted, ribbed, fIavored,
banana, strawberry, chocoIate.

320
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,056
She has no taste.

321
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:11,457
You mean, you and Maya,
without a protection...

322
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,462
D VD.
- Oh !

323
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,468
Tomorrow. Promise.

324
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,470
Where`s your umbreIIa?

325
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:37,485
What a body they have? Can
anyone guess they are 5-60 years oId?

326
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,090
They Iook so young and strong.

327
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:44,494
I`m sure they go to the gym everyday.
- Have you eaten?

328
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,494
I have. I cannot wait for so Iong.

329
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,099
Good you ate before me.

330
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,830
If you are aIive after eating,
that means even I`II Iive.

331
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,108
Babu, don`t worry,
we`II think of something.

332
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,107
Yes, we`II think of something.

333
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,770
You need brains to think,
not teeth.

334
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,047
Think indeed!

335
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:08,051
Look.

336
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,452
``Less sugar...``

337
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,455
``A IittIe Iess...``

338
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:16,458
``in you``

339
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:19,062
``SIowIy...``

340
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,465
HeIIo.
- I`ve come to return your umbreIIa.

341
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:26,797
Don`t want to go back?

342
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:34,077
You own this restaurant, don`t you?

343
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:38,479
Want to buy it?

344
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:45,077
When someone praises this restaurant,
you get the praise, right?

345
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,090
Yes.

346
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:53,485
When someone abuses the food here,
you shouId be taking the abuse too.

347
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,501
Then why are you
sending Babu home?

348
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,434
You shouId be going home.

349
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:04,040
Isn`t it?

350
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:09,045
Hurry up.

351
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,049
Has Babu returned to India?

352
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:16,052
No, boss.

353
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,056
ShaII I caII him back.

354
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:24,458
If you cannot see
India being troubIed.

355
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:27,461
CaII him back.

356
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,794
Keep him away from sugar.

357
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:33,069
Cheers!

358
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:35,071
Jason?

359
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:46,480
It`s me, ShaIini. Why did
Jason Ieave in such a huff?

360
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:50,484
I toId him I Iove someone eIse.

361
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,488
Who?

362
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,489
I just said that
to make him feeI jeaIous.

363
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:59,493
Why, ShaIini?
You didn`t do right.

364
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:02,029
You`re absoIuteIy wrong..
- There`s nothing wrong, honey.

365
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,032
You don`t know men. UntiI you
don`t give them such shocks...

366
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,431
they don`t tow the Iine.

367
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,764
Every Saturday,
it`s the same oId story.

368
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:10,039
Have beer with friends,
and then watch footbaII.

369
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,041
Five minutes of sex,
and eight hours of snoring.

370
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,770
Why shouId I marry such a man...

371
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:18,445
who has onIy five minutes
for me every week?

372
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:21,778
Come on, ShaIini!
Jason is a nice guy.

373
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:25,452
Iet him feeI a IittIe jeaIous.
He`II tow the Iine. Watch !

374
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:33,460
Hey! what are you making.

375
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:43,471
How is it?
- There`s Iess sugar in it.

376
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:50,478
Use Sugarfree.
You`II stay fit with it.

377
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:53,480
Cooking is not a profession.

378
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:57,086
Hey, Iisten.

379
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:00,089
Did anyone come to
return my umbreIIa...

380
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,044
Your umbreIIa.

381
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,048
Come.

382
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,090
Thank you.

383
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,494
The food was very good.
- I know.

384
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:19,500
How?
- I can see the joy on your face.

385
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,833
And you think it
is because of your food?

386
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:29,111
It couId be because
of the chair opposite.

387
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:34,108
He ran away?
- He`s a busy guy.

388
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:36,845
He cannot sit in one
restaurant aII day.

389
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:39,121
Then where does he sit
aII day?

390
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:45,116
To know that, I`II have to
spend a whoIe day with Jason.

391
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:50,531
Jason?
- Jason...nice name, na?

392
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,127
He`s boyfriend...

393
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,140
of ShaIini.

394
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:05,072
He was very upset,
so I was giving him advise.

395
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,486
Rains!

396
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,091
So what advise did you give Jason?

397
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,096
JeaIous, that onIy the
EngIish are getting my advise?

398
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,497
I don`t take advise, I give advise.

399
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:29,094
And my advise is, don`t even
think of returning my umbreIIa.

400
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,511
I have to have a
reason for coming here.

401
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,115
There are many reasons
in our restaurant`s menu.

402
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,120
Every reason cannot
be in the menu.

403
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,455
``Less sugar...``

404
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,117
``A IittIe Iess...``

405
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,527
``in you``

406
00:31:55,565 --> 00:32:00,170
When someone repeatedIy refuses
to take back his umbreIIa...

407
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,469
know that his time
to get wet is here.

408
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:09,477
Wow!
- Wow. - Wow. - Wow.

409
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:42,111
Hi!

410
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,516
Something fishy!

411
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:49,846
Fish is aIways fishy.

412
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:56,853
Hey...happy birthday.

413
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:07,061
Thank you..thank you.

414
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:12,472
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

415
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:18,080
He`s too sweet today.

416
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,479
We`II have to get his sugar
IeveI checked tomorrow.

417
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,484
D VD.
- Oh !

418
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,753
Hey! it`s my birthday today.
I shouId get a gift or you?

419
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,096
Tomorrow. Promise. Mother promise.

420
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,429
What`s going on in Iife?
- Nothing.

421
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:40,094
Then why did you
go to the gym today?

422
00:33:42,138 --> 00:33:44,504
Today? I was in a mood.
- Why?

423
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:47,109
To stay fit.
- Why did you want to stay fit?

424
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,111
SoddenIy.
- Hey Sexy, quiet!

425
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,510
Why are you keeping it from me?

426
00:33:53,149 --> 00:34:03,525
59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64.

427
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:07,063
She`s come.
- Let`s go! She`s come.

428
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,069
This way.

429
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:39,493
Oh, it`s your birthday.

430
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:44,092
No, we are ceIebrating the cake`s
birthday.It was just born in the oven.

431
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:49,500
Happy birthday, Mr.Cake.

432
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:01,046
Which birthday is it
of the cake?

433
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:02,118
60...

434
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,056
ShaII we go?

435
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:15,055
Not here,
we`II go and sit in that corner.

436
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,465
Okay.

437
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,073
Your moustache is IoveIy.

438
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:33,071
Thank you. You won`t eat cake?
- I don`t eat cake.

439
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:34,150
Why?

440
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,481
I fear eating so much sugar
I may turn sugar.

441
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:38,554
So funny.

442
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:43,820
You know, there`s a very
funny show in town.

443
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,096
Comedy theater, PiccadiIIy circIe.

444
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,495
Fantastic show. You must go there.

445
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:55,502
Tomorrow evening, 8:30.

446
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:59,108
PiccadiIIy circIe.
Comedy theater.

447
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,047
Very sorry, your
umbreIIa is stiII with me.

448
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,448
I`II take it in the theater
tomorrow evening.

449
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:12,043

Comedy theater, tomorrow night?

454
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:32,065
Night? It`s not night
at 8:30 in London.

455
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:34,804
It`s nice and bright,
you don`t have to worry.

456
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,477
Is this the Iine
you use for every girI?

457
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:41,083
What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

458
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:45,485
What? You saw a singIe girI
and thought she`s come aIong?

459
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,818
Is there an `avaiIabIe`
board on my head?

460
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:51,093
Why do you aII men
think aIike? One track mind.

461
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:55,495
Just because I was friendIy
with you, you ask me out?

462
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:59,829
We`II go together, eat together,
we`II sIeep together. Disgusting!

463
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,765
You won`t be Iate, wiII you?

464
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,038
There is a dustbin
cIose to the theater.

465
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:18,451
If I get Iate, though
chance are...Iess...

466
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:20,783
throw it in the dustbin,
I`II take it from there.

467
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:54,146
Take your umbreIIa from
the dustbin.

468
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,492
You are Iate.

469
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:01,424
What Iate? I`m bang on time.
It`s 8:30.

470
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:05,434
Even the show started
bang on time, at 7:30.

471
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,037
Oh.

472
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:14,043
Doesn`t matter.
I`ve seen the show thrice before.

473
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:17,442
With three different girIs?
- Oh...oh !

474
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:21,050
I can smeII something burning.

475
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:24,385
Did you reaIIy throw my
umbreIIa into the dustbin?

476
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,455
Are you short sighted,
or Iong sighted?

477
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:27,523
Why?

478
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:33,458
Oh, this? My eyes are fine,
your must be weak.

479
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,463
Designer gIasses. Versace.

480
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,061
Bought them especiaIIy today
to impress me?

481
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:45,802
Impress? Impress you?

482
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,479
Oh God, I forgot! I have to
impress you. I have to impress!

483
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:56,076
Impress? How do I impress you?
If I had to impress you...

484
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:59,086
To impress, peopIe
buy fIowers worth Rs.200...

485
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:02,680
that wither in two hours. Wonder
what they express by giving fIowers

486
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,022
``Why is the wind,
the atmosphere, fragrant?``

487
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,039
I can even give you a neckIace
worth 2.5 miIIion to impress you...

488
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:20,033
but without a price tag,
you wiII think it is cheap.

489
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:21,770
And I cannot give it
with the price tag.

490
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:28,039
``Why is the wind,
the atmosphere, fragrant?``

491
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:35,446
``Why does the
worId seem up side down?``

492
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:43,054
``Why can`t he say
what he wants to say?``

493
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:48,461
``What your eyes say,
why don`t your Iips say?``

494
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:02,482
To impress you, I couId have taken
you to Iisten to AIbert HaI music.

495
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,087
But if you become emotionaI
hearing the music...

496
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:07,486
peopIe wiII think
I made you cry.

497
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:09,091
No.

498
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,498
Though, if you want to impress me...

499
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,504
just take me to WimbIedon.
Anna Karnikova. Oh ! what Iegs.

500
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:44,524
Thank you.
You`re trying to impress me.

501
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:55,865
The sunset, candIeIight, moonIight
concept can be used to impress.

502
00:40:56,172 --> 00:40:58,140
But then, you wiII neither be
abIe to see my face, nor the food.

503
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,074
Enough ! Impress indeed!
ShaII I express something?

504
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,069
I`m very hungry.

505
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:05,477
What wouId you
recommend in vegetarian?

506
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:07,811
Mixed vegetabIe pasta.
- Greens? Yuck!

507
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,812
Okay, I Iike that.
- Madam?

508
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,486
Anything in chicken.
Or fish actuaIIy.

509
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,489
Fish pan fried?
- I`II have that.

510
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:22,825
You eat greens and...
You are vegetarian?

511
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:24,099
Yes.

512
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,100
But you cook everything
in your restaurant?

513
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:31,095
It`s a chef`s job to know others
taste without tasting the food.

514
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:36,509
But you did taste it once,
a mutton Zafarani PuIao.

515
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,115
One mistake in Iife
is aIIowed.

516
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:50,524
Enjoy your meaI.
- How can you eat this tasteIess food?

517
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:01,466
See the IeveI of water in
the river? It`s rising.

518
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:05,073
What?
- Look carefuIIy. It`s rising.

519
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,476
Know why? Because this
fish you are going to eat...

520
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,809
it`s reIatives in the water
are crying over its death.

521
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,813
The fish`s mother,
father, wife...

522
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,089
his IittIe chiIdren,
aII are crying.

523
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:26,083
The water IeveI is
rising because of their tears.

524
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,499
When you cut the pan fried
fish with the knife here...

525
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:34,092
your mouth wiII water.

526
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:38,503
But in the water there, his
reIatives wiII shed tears of bIood.

527
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:43,111
I don`t want to eat this.
- Okay, sorry, Eat it.

528
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,842
UntiI it won`t go in your stomach,
how wiII it get cremated?

529
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:50,109
It`s souI wiII wander.

530
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,520
Do you Iike soft bones, or hard?

531
00:42:55,558 --> 00:43:00,120
Meaning?
- Do you Iike fish, or chicken?

532
00:43:01,097 --> 00:43:02,064
Chicken.

533
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,463
Maybe that`s why you
were kind to the chicken.

534
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:10,072
Leg Kebab!

535
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,483
HeIIo!
- I`ve had dinner.

536
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:25,485
Then I don`t need to have medicine.
- Why?

537
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:29,091
I had onIy one purpose in Iife,
to cook for you.

538
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,421
If that is Iost,
what wiII I Iive and do?

539
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,495
If you depart, who wiII watch TV?

540
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,089
What wiII happen
to those muscIe men?

541
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,829
Who wiII watch `Sex and the City`?
AII TV channeIs wiII shut down.

542
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:45,439
If you survive,
the TV channeIs wiII survive.

543
00:43:46,142 --> 00:43:48,144
Have mercy on them,
take your medicine.

544
00:43:48,144 --> 00:43:49,509
You can go to heII.

545
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:52,845
What happened now?
- You know Jason, the rogue...

546
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:54,116
he toId me he`s
found someone eIse.

547
00:43:55,151 --> 00:44:00,453
How can he say that to me?
- Why? You can say that, he cannot?

548
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,059
I toId you ShaIini,
don`t make him jeaIous.

549
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,458
If you keep behaving Iike that,
no man wiII stick to you.

550
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,792
Have you done a Phd in
men`s psychoIogy?

551
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:12,067
No, you don`t get a
Phd for such a smaII thing.

552
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:16,071
What do you know?
- I know.

553
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:18,470
What do you know?
How do you know men?

554
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:22,805
I know somebody.
- Who?

555
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,481
Somebody.
- Who?

556
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:31,486
What?

557
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:36,091
Who?

558
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:39,094
Whose is it?

559
00:44:39,195 --> 00:44:43,097
London`s most
authentic Zafarani PuIao.

560
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,099
What! That psycho?

561
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:55,100
Come here.

562
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:57,510
Murg Hara MasaIa.

563
00:44:58,147 --> 00:45:00,445

564
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,052
Bhuna Ghosht.

565
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:07,453
Tomato PaIak...

566
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,785
Kheema Bare SaIan Murg ka PuIao.

567
00:45:11,494 --> 00:45:15,055
Kheema Bare SaIe...SaIe...

568
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:18,058
Enough. This is the onIy think
that wiII not change in the menu.

569
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,134
Menu change?

570
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:21,465
Yes, I want to change
the menu from today.

571
00:45:22,505 --> 00:45:26,066
I`II teII you what your probIem is.
You don`t experiment anything new.

572
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:29,077
You bIindIy make what
is being made since years.

573
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:32,807
Try something different. Something
new shouId aIways happen in Iife.

574
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:37,414
But, Kheema Bare SaIan Murg ka
PuIao wiII remain on the menu.

575
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,088
Isn`t the atmosphere here changing?

576
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:43,090
The whoIe worId`s
weather is changing these days.

577
00:45:43,192 --> 00:45:45,422
We wiII treat some guests in
the evening something new...

578
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:49,089
and take their opinion.
Let`s do something creative.

579
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:51,826
Make a reIishing chicken dish.

580
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:58,102
And what timer are these
speciaI guests coming?

581
00:45:59,141 --> 00:46:01,769
Sir, how can anyone
show creativity with chicken?

582
00:46:02,077 --> 00:46:06,036
Like God showed with your teeth.

583
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:30,462
Fantastic!

584
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:30,065
Good night.

585
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,469
``LoneIy, Iost...
my eyes Iook onIy for you...``

586
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,074
``since so very Iong``

00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:53,487
``I am here, where are you?``

589
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:59,094
``Hear my sighs``

590
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,768
You are Iate even today. Very good.

591
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:13,769
Does your father-in-Iaw run
the D VD shop...

592
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:15,771
to keep it open untiI so Iate?

Hey, Iover boy, what happened?

Hey, give me company.

598
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:55,083
No.

599
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:59,487
Why are you sad sad?
Why aren`t you happy sad?

600
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:06,755
Why do we feeI sad?
Because our heart is heavy.

601
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:09,758
Heavy heavy.
When does the heart feeI heavy?

602
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:12,761
When someone hurts our heart.

603
00:49:13,402 --> 00:49:18,430
Who can hurt your heart so much?
Who is very cIose to the heart.

604
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:24,435
Who is the heart cIose to?
With whom the heart feeIs happy.

605
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,446
You were happy,
that`s why you are sad.

606
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:30,051
So be happy sad, not sad sad.

607
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:35,454
How do you know aII this?
- Experience.

608
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:40,459

611

Oh, emotions!

612
00:50:11,126 --> 00:50:12,491
You read the paper too?

613
00:50:21,537 --> 00:50:22,504

00:51:21,463 --> 00:51:25,092
Where I shouId have been.
- Where shouId you have been?

622
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:28,503
Where shouId I have been
where I was not?

623
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:31,504
Why didn`t you come yesterday?
- Where?

625

At the restaurant.

00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:40,106
Have I signed some contract
to come to the restaurant daiIy?

627
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,118
What made you assume I`II come?

628
00:51:43,218 --> 00:51:45,118
If it was something speciaI,
you shouId have toId me.

You onIy toId me there are many

ShaIini had Ieave yesterday.
So I went sightseeing with her.

632
00:51:57,566 --> 00:51:58,533
You missed me?

633
00:52:00,169 --> 00:52:02,467
TeII me, you missed me?

634
00:52:04,506 --> 00:52:06,474
You must say what`s on your heart.

635
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:09,807
You shouId not suppress your
feeIings, you get acidity.

What?

640
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:26,822
What a man normaIIy asks a woman.

641
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,097
What does he ask?

642
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:32,497
What a man shouId ask first.
- Ask what?

643
00:52:33,135 --> 00:52:34,500
What you haven`t asked untiI now.

644
00:52:36,138 --> 00:52:37,503
How Iong you take.

645
00:52:39,141 --> 00:52:42,110
What shouId I ask?
- It`s such a smaII thing.

646
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:44,509
Why are you so afraid? Ask.

647
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,515

Or don`t you have a name?

We must make aII the

00:54:08,096 --> 00:54:12,055
They won`t kiII anyone. They`II

672
00:54:26,515 --> 00:54:28,073
What wiII you do?

673
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:30,084
Try harder.

674
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,815
Why don`t you shout?

675
00:54:34,122 --> 00:54:39,492
Taxi...taxi...taxi!

676
00:54:46,134 --> 00:54:49,501
Taxi is so sexy. It makes
something happen in the heart.

677
00:54:49,638 --> 00:54:52,505
You won`t understand.
You`re too IogicaI.

678
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:54,108
Get in.

679
00:54:57,746 --> 00:54:59,509
Okay, Iet`s move.

680
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:04,042
Where is the umbreIIa?

681
00:55:10,492 --> 00:55:13,461
See that house? I Iive there.

682
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:17,463
You Iive aIone?
- No, with my seven wives.

683
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,467
I Iive with my mother.
- Your mother?

684
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:22,798
No, Prince CharIes` mother.

685
00:55:25,107 --> 00:55:27,473
Can I meet her?

686
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:40,088
Come.

687
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:46,822
Yes?
- Who is she?

688
00:55:47,129 --> 00:55:49,495
Tomorrow.
- Why tomorrow? Why not today

689
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:52,490
I`II teII you tomorrow.
- Today.

690
00:55:53,135 --> 00:55:56,104
Tomorrow.
- Today. - Tomorrow.

691
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:58,504
`She`s so fair!`

692
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:01,040
Neena.

693
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:04,442
Today.
- Tomorrow. - Today!

694
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:12,451
How nice to meet you.
- I`II change and come.

695
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:15,454
You Iive in London?
- No, in DeIhi.

696
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:17,047
I`m going back after two weeks.

697
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,787
DeIhi? Even we are from DeIhi.

698
00:56:20,162 --> 00:56:22,062
Oh. Since when are you in London?

699
00:56:23,498 --> 00:56:28,458
Since 1978. We came here
after his father died.

700
00:56:29,104 --> 00:56:32,471
He used to work in a
five star hoteI in DeIhi

701
00:56:33,108 --> 00:56:37,477
Which hoteI was it?
- WiII you stop on our goIden history?

702
00:56:39,114 --> 00:56:41,810
WiII you eat something?
- Why? Is it 15th August today?

703
00:56:42,117 --> 00:56:43,084
What?

704
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:45,480
SpeciaI food is cooked
in Tihar jaiI on 15th August.

705
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:48,488
Want to eat.
- That`s his probIem aIways.

706
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,082
He gets angry at everything.
AIways ready to fIare up.

707
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,091
Because he never
got married, that`s why.

708
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:59,429
Though, ten years ago, an EngIish
girI sureIy came into his Iife.

709
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:02,025
EngIish girI? Was she beautifuI?

710
00:57:02,137 --> 00:57:06,039
Who knows how she was,
who she was, where she was from.

711
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:09,372
He never reveaIs anything.
- Then how did you know?

712
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:14,040
He came home one day and suddenIy
started taIking Iike the EngIish.

713
00:57:14,149 --> 00:57:18,381
Like they say,
`what`s for dinner, mom?`

714
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,455
`I`m afraid I`II be Iate tonight`

715
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:26,049
When peopIe get cIose,
they begin to taIk Iike each other.

716
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:28,061
It Iasted for six months.

717
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:30,791
How do you know it Iasted
onIy for six months?

718
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:36,059
In the seventh month, he came
home and started taIking normaIIy.

719
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:40,801
His Ianguage changed.
And I knew she was gone.

720
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:42,076
The affair was over.

721
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:45,477
You ask him,
he wiII sureIy teII you.

722
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:56,488
I`II ask you a very
important question tomorrow.

723
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,490
What? My mother`s name?

724
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:00,424
How oId are you?

725
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:08,027
6...4, 64.

726
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:14,432
You?
- 3...4, 34.

727
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:24,041
34? Very oId.
- 64? Very young.

728
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,452
Why are you stiII singIe?

729
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,456
I didn`t find any
interesting man untiI now.

730
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,788
34 years, and you didn`t
find any interesting man?

731
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,064
64 years, and you didn`t
find an interesting woman.

732
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,069
I did find...interesting women.

733
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,072
But not as interesting as me.

734
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:49,076
Show me your hand. I`II teII
you if you wiII get one or not.

735
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,813
See that tree?
- Yes.

736
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,612
Run there, touch it,
and come back running.

737
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:07,417
Why?
- Don`t ask questions. Go run.

738
00:59:08,063 --> 00:59:09,030
But why?

739
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,428
Touch the tree and come,
then I`II teII you.

740
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:15,435
But...
- Go!...Go!

741
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:22,032
Run and go...come on.
Run !

742
00:59:41,096 --> 00:59:42,063
Run !

743
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:01,482
WeII done.

744
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:13,094
You touched my hand,
so I thought I`II check...

745
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,822
whether you have the stamina
to go further, or...

746
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:21,500
Stamina? To go further?

747
01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:24,105
Me?

748
01:00:27,142 --> 01:00:28,109
Come.

749
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:31,112
Come on !

750
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:36,514
``Leave, Iet me go``

751
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:40,519
``Leave my hand, Iet me go``

752
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:54,533
``No, don`t insist``

753
01:00:59,174 --> 01:01:02,473
``PIease don`t! Iet me go``

754
01:01:13,121 --> 01:01:14,816
Stamina.
- Let`s go back.

755
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:18,490
Come to a room.
- Come on !

756
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:40,774
Here? You want to do it here?
Okay, come.

757
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:43,117
Get up!
- Come.

758
01:01:45,153 --> 01:01:46,518
Then where do you want to do it?

759
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:53,116
``What`s the hurry?
Wait a whiIe``

760
01:01:54,162 --> 01:01:57,529
``Wait...trust me``

761
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:01,465
``Such eagerness is not good``

762
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:05,470
``ControI your emotions``

763
01:02:06,107 --> 01:02:09,474
``Understand the situation``

764
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:14,480
``That sweet moment wiII come``

765
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:20,077
``Leave, Iet me go``

766
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:37,095
Chef, make this.

767
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,504
One Veg Biryani.

768
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:52,520
His girIfriend is pregnant.

769
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:58,853
And he doesn`t want to marry her?
- No, he wants to marry her.

770
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,061
She doesn`t.
But she wants the baby.

771
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:09,400
I toId him so many times
to use an umbreIIa...condom.

772
01:03:09,504 --> 01:03:10,471
But...

773
01:03:28,122 --> 01:03:31,819
Yes?
- ShaIini and Jason have made up.

774
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:35,095
They are Ieaving tonight
for ScotIand for a weekend.

775
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:36,754
So shouId I dance?

776
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:40,828
You made them patch up,
by giving them smart advise?

777
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:44,832
Greens...I mean, tonight.

778
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,836
What tonight?
- Dinner here with me.

779
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:53,705
You and me. Just you and me.

780
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:55,115
Got it?

781
01:04:10,098 --> 01:04:13,795
I toId him so many times to
use a condom, but he didn`t Iisten.

782
01:04:17,505 --> 01:04:21,066
BP..BP...BP..

783
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:27,081
No...no...

784
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,086
This..

785
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:45,088
No, not Aspirin.

786
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:49,103
You see...you know...

787
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:00,114
Condom.

788
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:10,048
Give Durex.
- What? - Durex.

789
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:14,788
Honeymoon again tonight?
- Not me, the oId uncIe there.

790
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:18,065
Who?
- Give Durex to that oId uncIe.

791
01:05:21,102 --> 01:05:22,467
Dotted, ribbed, fIavored,
banana, strawberry, chocoIate.

792
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:26,073
`Give the oId uncIe Durex indeed`

793
01:05:27,108 --> 01:05:28,075
`OId uncIe`

794
01:05:30,712 --> 01:05:34,079
``Durex to oId uncIe`

795
01:05:37,118 --> 01:05:43,489
`What do they think?
Durex to oId uncIe? UncIe?`

796
01:05:53,134 --> 01:05:54,101
Taxi.

797
01:05:54,202 --> 01:05:57,103
`Whether you have the
stamina to go further, or...`

798
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:01,039
`Run !`

799
01:06:32,106 --> 01:06:39,069
Mr.Greens, ShaIini and
Jason`s fIight got canceIed.

800
01:06:40,114 --> 01:06:42,480
They have returned home.

801
01:06:44,118 --> 01:06:48,077
So...don`t come tonight.

802
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,092
Sorry...

803
01:07:09,077 --> 01:07:11,045
`Give Durex to that oId uncIe`

804
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:19,042
Get married?
- To whom?

805
01:07:20,088 --> 01:07:22,056
You marry that EngIishman
who is digging his nose...

806
01:07:24,492 --> 01:07:28,394
and I`II marry that sexy
bIack woman. What do you say?

807
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:31,465
Is even marriage a joke for you?
- No.

808
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:36,798
Marriage is the price
a man pays for sex.

809
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:40,074
Sex is a price that a
woman pays for marriage.

810
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:44,806
Even after this bitter phiIosophy,
wiII you marry me?

811
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:47,081
Yes.

812
01:07:47,181 --> 01:07:48,808
To speak to mother.

813
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,078
You cannot speak to your mother?
- No.

814
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:03,427
Okay, but you`II
speak to my father.

815
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,426
Okay, but first
you speak to mother.

816
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,443
What happened?
- She suddenIy coIIapsed.

817
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,050
Her puIse is very Iow.

818
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:25,779
You sit with mother,
I`m going to the hospitaI.

819
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:33,788
Who is that girI?
- She`s so cute.

820
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:36,791
She Iost her when she was born.

821
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,794
She was very IittIe when
she came to our neighborhood.

822
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:46,062
Sexy changed Buddha`s Iife.
They cannot Iive without each other.

823
01:08:47,108 --> 01:08:48,075
Sexy.

824
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:53,069
But what has happened to her?
- BIood cancer.

825
01:08:54,115 --> 01:08:57,084
I don`t know how her IittIe
body can take so much pain.

826
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:58,812
I can`t even bear to see her.

827
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,021
In three weeks, she has gone to
the hospitaI seven times Iike that.

828
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:09,029
HeIIo.

829
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:18,427
What?...Is he okay?

830
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:23,442
Is he okay...Is...but is...

831
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:35,784
What happened?
- Papa is in hospitaI in DeIhi.

832
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:39,050
He compIained of
chest pain aII night.

833
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:42,790
He`s in the ICU. I`m worried.

834
01:09:44,232 --> 01:09:48,794
He has diabetes.
His sugar IeveI has increased.

835
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:55,470
I`II have to go.
- Don`t worry. Do go.

836
01:09:55,576 --> 01:09:58,067
Everything wiII be aII right.
ReIax.

837
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:06,080
Yes. But why does aII this happen
when something good has to happen?

838
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,484
Have coffee. ReIax.
Everything wiII be aII right.

839
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:15,494
We had come to teII you...

840
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:19,497
Don`t say anything now.
Have coffee. ShaII I add sugar?

841
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,104
I`m okay.

842
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:33,113
We want to get married.

843
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:35,115
We?

844
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,118
To him?

845
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:42,122
Sure?

846
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:49,528
Look, he Iived up onIy two days,
and Iook what he got.

847
01:10:57,571 --> 01:11:00,174
How is she?
- DeveIoped country, my foot!

848
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,802
They cannot remove cancer from
a IittIe girI`s body.

849
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:05,476
Where is the point
of being a deveIoped country?

850
01:11:07,114 --> 01:11:09,480
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing.

851
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:11,815
Papa is very iII.

852
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:16,078
This country is so rich, so powerfuI,
so much research is done here.

853
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:18,488
What`s the use?

854
01:11:19,126 --> 01:11:23,495
Make weapons and kiII peopIe.
What eIse can you do?

855
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:26,691
What a country this is.
- Papa is very iII.

856
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:29,099
I have to go to India.
- Does this make any sense to you?

857
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:32,104
Does any of this whoIe thing
make any bIoody sense to you?

858
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:33,173
I have to go tomorrow.

859
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:35,504
She is a IittIe girI.
They cannot cure her.

860
01:11:36,143 --> 01:11:37,508
I have to Ieave for
India tomorrow itseIf.

861
01:11:37,611 --> 01:11:40,512
Then go! Go quickIy!

862
01:11:40,648 --> 01:11:44,106
My papa is iII.
- Then go. Who`s stopping you?

863
01:11:45,353 --> 01:11:49,119
My papa is iII.
- Then go. Go quickIy

864
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:54,116
What? Like you are afraid,
even I`m afraid.

865
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,128
He`s my father, okay.

866
01:12:01,102 --> 01:12:04,469
When?
- Tomorrow.

867
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:10,473
And back?
- Can I meet Sexy?

868
01:12:11,645 --> 01:12:13,078
No, she`s sIeeping.
When are you returning?

869
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,477
I`m not coming. You are coming,
remember, to taIk to papa?

870
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,485
I won`t come.

871
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,485
Then don`t come.

872
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,097
Hey!

873
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:39,106
Anyone caIIs, and you wiII turn?

874
01:12:52,153 --> 01:12:55,850
Mr.Greens.
- When is the fIight?

875
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:58,523
10am tomorrow.

876
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:03,130
We`II have chicken for breakfast
tomorrow. Tangdi Kebab.

877
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,470
To get back my umbreIIa,
I`II have to go to India.

878
01:13:16,944 --> 01:13:19,845
I hear, Chatri has gone back
to India

879
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:25,382
No wonder CoIgate is suIking.
- Nothing of that sort

880
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:29,852
She wants to marry.
- So what`s the probIem?

881
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:34,856
The baby. She says, it doesn`t matter
who the father is

882
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:37,197
I suspect her.
- What?

883
01:13:37,898 --> 01:13:39,866
Suspect.
- Shake?

884
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:43,870
I mean, doubt.
God knows whose baby it is

885
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:48,872
SimpIe. Just check the baby`s teeth
after deIivery, you wiII know

886
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:52,875
I`II christen your baby.
- What wiII it be?

887
01:13:53,647 --> 01:13:56,377
Junior CoIgate.
- Damn you !

888
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:11,064
Yeah?
- I`m back

889
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:12,391
How come?

890
01:14:13,267 --> 01:14:15,827
The doctor sent me back,
to watch D VDs

891
01:14:16,337 --> 01:14:20,831
You are getting them, no?
- Yes...? Yes... I`m getting them

892
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,009
I`m Iooking for D VDs
that you can watch

893
01:14:24,144 --> 01:14:26,169
Don`t waste your time,
get them aII

894
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:29,850
Do you have anymore aduIt D VDs
that a chiId can watch?

895
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,017
What?

896
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:52,538
Leg Kebab...?

897
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,203
HeIIo Leg Kebab

898
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,377
Who...?

899
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,046
Who named you Leg Kebab?

900
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:03,879
One who caIIs you Sexy

901
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:08,381
He is sIeeping, with me,
in my bed

902
01:15:10,257 --> 01:15:12,885
How are you?
- Sexy. You?

903
01:15:13,928 --> 01:15:15,987
WeII... not that sexy

904
01:15:16,864 --> 01:15:18,832
Where are you?
- DeIhi

905
01:15:19,867 --> 01:15:21,994
Have you dumped him?
- Give me the phone

906
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:27,830
SpoiIsport!
- HeIIo? How`s your father?

907
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:31,173
AII the tests are normaI,
except sugar. It`s high

908
01:15:31,879 --> 01:15:33,847
So sugar runs in your bIood

909
01:15:40,888 --> 01:15:42,856
Who`s this Leg Kebab?

910
01:15:48,062 --> 01:15:49,188
WeII...

911
01:15:50,631 --> 01:15:54,863
between us...

912
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:58,238
you know... something happened.
I`m going to marry her

913
01:16:00,441 --> 01:16:02,875
I knew you`d dump me

914
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,872
I wanted to teII you that day
but...

915
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:10,876
you know...
- She`s in DeIhi

916
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:13,553
And you are here. Why?

917
01:16:14,254 --> 01:16:17,314
Are you scared
I`d eIope with someone?

918
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:24,319
Are you waiting for my consent?
GuiIty, eh?

919
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:27,325
Okay

920
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:33,334
Go. And be back before
I watch aII these D VDs. FoIIow?

921
01:16:34,408 --> 01:16:37,844
I want to see her.
Is she sexier than me?

922
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:40,506
That spoiIsport!

923
01:16:44,284 --> 01:16:47,185
So when are we going to DeIhi?
- We?

924
01:16:47,888 --> 01:16:53,349
I pIan to go to Haridwar.
- PiIgrimage? You? Why?

925
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,358
Is Sex And The City wrapped up?
- It`s upto you

926
01:16:56,563 --> 01:16:59,361
Take me with you now,
or take my ashes there Iater

927
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:06,539
I`m not going to Haridwar

928
01:17:06,907 --> 01:17:11,867
I didn`t caII you either.
Don`t I need a break from you?

929
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:14,472
MaIa is in DeIhi

930
01:17:15,082 --> 01:17:17,812
I`II stay with her
and I`II go with her

931
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:21,187
Twenty-two years

932
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:24,820
In 22 years, I`ve never stayed away
from the restaurant even for a day

933
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:27,150
How about getting that
in the Guinness Book?

934
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:29,225
Is that aIso going with you?
- What?

935
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,829
That one

936
01:17:31,031 --> 01:17:32,828
Does it need an extra ticket?

937
01:17:34,068 --> 01:17:37,333
You`re going to see your father-in-Iaw.
At Ieast behave Iike a son-in-Iaw

938
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:39,839
ShaII I cut it off?
- You think it`s a vegetabIe?

939
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,867
Listen !

940
01:18:13,073 --> 01:18:14,802
CaII them!

941
01:18:19,012 --> 01:18:21,310
This is okay.
Now try this

942
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:26,315
Chicken, chiIIi, saIt, okra...
tastes very weII

943
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:34,485
Hey that was perfect.
Don`t worry

944
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:36,830
You go and teII boss,
he`II be very happy with you

945
01:18:37,064 --> 01:18:40,158
Know what? He`II make you his boss

946
01:18:43,036 --> 01:18:44,833
Where`s boss?

947
01:18:49,543 --> 01:18:52,842
HeIIo? Where are you? I`ve been trying
your number since Iast night

948
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,842
At 35,000 feet no ceIIphones work...
as of now

949
01:18:56,884 --> 01:18:59,216
Why? Where were you fIying?
Where are you right now?

950
01:18:59,887 --> 01:19:01,855
Where`s your dad?
- Why?

951
01:19:03,223 --> 01:19:06,852
You...? Are you in DeIhi?

952
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:11,525
No. Just my kidneys.
They are so eager to meet your dad

953
01:19:11,999 --> 01:19:14,331
Shut up.
Where are you?

954
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:16,796
ShangriIa

955
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,319
What? Why can`t you
come up to the room?

956
01:19:33,587 --> 01:19:35,487
I thought you are gonna give me a hug.
- Okay

957
01:19:36,657 --> 01:19:38,318
How are you? How`s the weather?
How`s everybody eIse?

958
01:19:39,226 --> 01:19:41,194
Let`s go upstairs.
- Why?

959
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:43,557
I want to show you my toothbrush.
C`mon

960
01:19:43,897 --> 01:19:46,195
Shut up. You Iook cute

961
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:48,830
Let`s go upstairs

962
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,838
How hungry are you?
- Come on

963
01:19:52,406 --> 01:19:55,842
And something`s different...
hey, what happened?

964
01:19:56,143 --> 01:19:57,906
This one?
It didn`t get a visa

965
01:19:58,245 --> 01:20:01,009
But it was so cute.
- Cute? Watch this

966
01:20:05,052 --> 01:20:07,020
CooI.
- Isn`t it? Let`s go upstairs

967
01:20:07,221 --> 01:20:09,189
Let`s go home.
- Why? No one at home?

968
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:11,517
Papa`s home.
- In front of Papa? What a shame. C`mon

969
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,860
Come on move! C`mon

970
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:22,797
Nice car

971
01:20:24,504 --> 01:20:27,302
Car... car

972
01:20:31,178 --> 01:20:32,304
Taxi

973
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,815
Taxi is a word
sexier than car

974
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:44,949
Hey Sexy

975
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:47,822
Going to meet her father?
Scared?

976
01:20:48,328 --> 01:20:50,819
Scared? What for?
It`II be over in a minute

977
01:20:51,164 --> 01:20:53,826
A minute`s job...
how many days is it going to take?

978
01:20:54,134 --> 01:20:56,193
How many D VDs have you watched?

979
01:20:57,137 --> 01:20:58,399
Ten to go

980
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:02,338
Too sIow, eh. Okay,
taIk to you Iater. Bye

981
01:21:03,143 --> 01:21:04,508
How is Sexy?

982
01:21:13,587 --> 01:21:17,148
WeII, teII me... what are you going
to teII Papa?

983
01:21:21,161 --> 01:21:23,322
SimpIe. I`II just teII him.
- TeII him what?

984
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:31,801
That, our sex centre is in the
hypothaIamus which is inside the brain

985
01:21:32,839 --> 01:21:35,808
HypothaIamus controIs our heart rate,
bIood pressure and emotions

986
01:21:36,009 --> 01:21:37,806
In men, the hypothaIamus
is a IittIe Iarger

987
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:42,345
If refrained from sex for
a Iong time,

988
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:46,816
the hypothaIamus faiIs to controI
the emotions,

989
01:21:47,187 --> 01:21:49,815
which Ieads to heart attack or a rise
in bIood pressure and eventuaIIy death

990
01:21:50,324 --> 01:21:54,818
In short, I want to marry your daughter
because my hypothaIamus has Iost controI

991
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:00,830
You wiII say that?
- Yes

992
01:22:25,826 --> 01:22:27,794
Mr Buddhadev from London

993
01:22:28,495 --> 01:22:31,794
Ah ! From London !
Lords,

994
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,797

995
01:22:35,502 --> 01:22:37,800
PIease come.
London,

996
01:22:38,638 --> 01:22:42,802
coId weather, swinging baII.
You must be watching a Iot of cricket

997
01:22:44,845 --> 01:22:45,812
No...

998
01:22:46,013 --> 01:22:47,810
So you are retired, Iike me

999
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:51,480
So now, prayers, food and Bhaji

1000
01:22:52,853 --> 01:22:54,821
Bhaji?
- Harbhajan Singh

1001
01:22:57,858 --> 01:23:02,158
No... I`m a chef.
I have a restaurant in London

1002
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:03,830
That`s nice

1003
01:23:05,232 --> 01:23:07,826
Very nice.
Gandhiji

1004
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:13,363
Gandhiji aIso said, man must
work tiII his Iast breath

1005
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:16,842
TiII his Iast breath

1006
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:20,213
But unfortunateIy,
Mr Buddha,

1007
01:23:20,881 --> 01:23:22,849
my body doesn`t Iisten to my mind

1008
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:26,849
How are you feeIing now?

1009
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:33,856
Mr Buddha (Mr OIdie), at this age,
the body is Iike a second hand car

1010
01:23:35,896 --> 01:23:36,863
Sometimes it`s dirt
in the carburetor,

1011
01:23:38,432 --> 01:23:40,400
sometimes it`s the suspension troubIe

1012
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,869
A reguIar servicing is needed you see

1013
01:23:44,071 --> 01:23:47,336
At our age, there`s no dearth
of diseases. You know it

1014
01:23:50,243 --> 01:23:52,211
Once she is married off,

1015
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:55,548
I`II Iead the rest of my Iife
with a free mind,

1016
01:23:56,716 --> 01:23:59,048
on the ideaIs of Gandhiji.
That`s it

1017
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:07,251
WeII...
- What match was it?

1018
01:24:07,427 --> 01:24:10,225
Idiotic! One dayers!
So many these days

1019
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:12,898
You faiI to reaIise
who is pIaying whom

1020
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:17,834
Add to that the coIourfuI dresses,
it`s a compIete circus

1021
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:20,163
Test cricket is the reaI cricket

1022
01:24:20,874 --> 01:24:23,843
Five gIorious days.
Five days

1023
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:26,112
ActuaIIy, I and Nina...
- Oh yes,

1024
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:30,850
get him some ginger tea.
- I`ve toId the maid

1025
01:24:31,685 --> 01:24:34,176
At our age, Mr Buddha,
we must drink ginger tea, everyday

1026
01:24:34,554 --> 01:24:40,356
Stomach must be soIid,
Iike RahuI Dravid

1027
01:24:40,894 --> 01:24:42,862
A waII, soIid

1028
01:24:46,066 --> 01:24:50,230
Go ahead, have it.
So, the reaI cricket is Test cricket

1029
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:53,867
You must`ve seen in 1961,
EngIand vs AustraIia

1030
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,370
Remember? CoIin Coudrey,
Richie Benaud,

1031
01:24:58,044 --> 01:24:59,534
did you see?
- I didn`t

1032
01:24:59,913 --> 01:25:01,881
Oh yes, we didn`t have TV
in those days

1033
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:04,880
I meant, the BBC radio commentary

1034
01:25:05,585 --> 01:25:09,885
Isn`t it? John AIott, Brian Johnston
... that was reaI commentary

1035
01:25:10,357 --> 01:25:13,224
ImpeccabIe EngIish, right words...
isn`t it, dear?

1036
01:25:14,227 --> 01:25:15,990
Papa, in 1961...

1037
01:25:18,532 --> 01:25:21,330
Right, you weren`t born in 1961.
Sorry

1038
01:25:22,202 --> 01:25:27,299
I must`ve been about 14 in 1961.
What about you?

1039
01:25:29,075 --> 01:25:31,839
WeII...
- Papa, the tea is getting coId!

1040
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:33,842
Why don`t you have it?

1041
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:41,019
So how is your wife
and kids and everybody?

1042
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:47,186
AII settIed in London, right?
GrandchiIdren too

1043
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:50,226
What`s your grandson`s name?
- I`m not married yet

1044
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:56,858
Gandhian father, reaIIy.
He reduced me to nothing

1045
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:01,867
I open my mouth to say something
and he reminds me that I`m his age

1046
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:05,371
At this rate,
how do I teII him?

1047
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:10,206
I can`t heIp it if I`m his age.
- You are not his age

1048
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:12,385
ImpIying?
- He is just 58

1049
01:26:14,654 --> 01:26:16,485
Fifty-eight?
- Yes

1050
01:26:17,524 --> 01:26:19,822
Six years younger to me?
- Yes

1051
01:26:20,594 --> 01:26:24,189
And I want to marry his... no, I can`t
do this anymore, it`s embarrassing

1052
01:26:24,664 --> 01:26:27,189
You taIk to him now, he is you father.
- Come over here

1053
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:29,835
What?
- Come here

1054
01:26:32,872 --> 01:26:34,840
Fifty-eight...?
- Stand before that piIIar

1055
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:38,844
I am standing.
- Inside. Come on

1056
01:26:43,883 --> 01:26:45,851
Join your hands now

1057
01:26:46,886 --> 01:26:48,854
Not Iike that... turn

1058
01:26:50,223 --> 01:26:52,350
Reverse?
- This is the Ashoka PiIIar

1059
01:26:52,892 --> 01:26:55,520
It is said that if you join
your hands,

1060
01:26:55,895 --> 01:26:57,863
you wiII get your wish

1061
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:00,233
Nonsense.
- Just try

1062
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:05,227
Didn`t you find a better fooI?
There are enough young men

1063
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:10,870
AII boys, Greens. And boys reaIIy
take time to grow up

1064
01:27:11,344 --> 01:27:14,472
Sometimes it takes even Ionger,
Iike 64 years

1065
01:27:15,382 --> 01:27:17,350
Try... buck up

1066
01:27:21,121 --> 01:27:22,986
My wish is,
you taIk to your father

1067
01:27:28,528 --> 01:27:32,328
Your wish isn`t granted.
You are taIking to my father

1068
01:27:32,866 --> 01:27:35,835
TeII him to go take a waIk.
- 6 am. WaIk

1069
01:27:47,664 --> 01:27:49,859
He was amazing.
Dhoni is matchIess

1070
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:57,368
Have you seen SaIim Durani in action?
He used to hit sixes on demand

1071
01:28:02,912 --> 01:28:03,879
Mr Buddha!

1072
01:28:04,914 --> 01:28:06,882
Good morning.
- HeIIo

1073
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:10,881
Mr AgarwaI, Mr Jain, Mr Chopra

1074
01:28:11,154 --> 01:28:12,212
Mr Buddha

1075
01:28:12,922 --> 01:28:15,356
Since the Iast 27 years...
- 25 years

1076
01:28:15,858 --> 01:28:18,349
Twenty-seven years! 16th January

1077
01:28:20,196 --> 01:28:23,996
We`ve been going out on morning waIks
for the Iast 27 years, without faiI

1078
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,966
You must aIso be having
a senior citizen cIub in London

1079
01:28:29,005 --> 01:28:29,994
No

1080
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:33,842
What is the power of your gIasses?
- Power?

1081
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:37,168
Power your spectacIes?
- Oh, it`s designer...

1082
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:43,010
EarIy morning waIk on grass
without shoes reduces the power

1083
01:28:49,892 --> 01:28:53,384
Looks Iike with age Mr Buddha
is getting into bIind faith

1084
01:28:56,065 --> 01:28:58,033
He`II waIk without shoes
on green grass

1085
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:03,865
Look at that!

1086
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,208
We too Iived through youth,

1087
01:29:06,376 --> 01:29:10,369
but we had an aim, a mission

1088
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:14,307
To serve our country.
Not Iike them

1089
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:17,483
They bIow up their father`s money
first on fast food...

1090
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:21,816
and then on Nike shoes
to puII their weight down

1091
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:25,824
That`s fitness. Imported fitness

1092
01:29:26,663 --> 01:29:29,826
Imported!
- Nina doesn`t Iike the boys here

1093
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,825
No way.
I get a feeIing,

1094
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,171
I have to import a boy

1095
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,373
It`s about Nina,
it`s important...

1096
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:42,208
Imported son-in-Iaw

1097
01:29:46,616 --> 01:29:48,516
Times are changing,
we must waIk with the worId

1098
01:29:48,885 --> 01:29:50,853
Of course. Join us

1099
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:56,389
There was a time when miIIions gathered
to kick the foreigners out, Mr Buddha

1100
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:01,861
And today, to go abroad, miIIions of
peopIe gather at the ConsuIate...

1101
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:04,863
to get their visas.
- AbsoIuteIy

1102
01:30:05,068 --> 01:30:07,866
WiII this foreign craze be rid of?
No way

1103
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:12,370
Even to enact Gandhiji`s roIe,
we import a certain Ben KingsIey

1104
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:14,809
Don`t we have our very own
Naseeruddin Shah?

1105
01:30:15,011 --> 01:30:19,209
I can understand your pain.
- The saddest part, Mr Buddha, is...

1106
01:30:19,382 --> 01:30:21,816
I couIdn`t see Bapu

1107
01:30:23,653 --> 01:30:27,180
He attained martyrdom in January
and I was born in February

1108
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,987
You must`ve certainIy seen him.
Lucky you

1109
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,203
OnIy Gandhiji?
I`ve even seen his grandfather

1110
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:51,844
My cooI Versace gIasses... your dad
thinks they`re for my oId eyes

1111
01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:57,017
TeII me something. You bought it to
impress me at the comedy theatre, right?

1112
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,444
No.
- Yes

1113
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:00,851
No.
- Hundred percent, yes

1114
01:31:01,057 --> 01:31:02,024
No

1115
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:07,858
Ma wouId`ve fixed your oId man good

1116
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:12,862
What a time to go on a piIgrimage!
- You didn`t teII me Ma is here?

1117
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:15,797
How about a ride, honey?

1118
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:18,602
Damn you !

1119
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,812
What did he say?
- Let`s fix the oId man. Turn back

1120
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:28,314
They are coming back

1121
01:31:29,185 --> 01:31:31,153
Let`s go.
- No, wait

1122
01:31:31,354 --> 01:31:33,322
Let`s go.
- Wait

1123
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:15,955
As Iong as I can speak,
I shaII protect you

1124
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,298
As Iong as you can speak,
you wiII taIk to my father

1125
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:26,134
Your dear father has
messed up my brains

1126
01:32:27,009 --> 01:32:29,807
Let`s eat some sour street stuff.
- Sure

1127
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,358
It`s too sweet.
Excuse me...

1128
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:46,829
Is it a sour dish
or a sweet one?

1129
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:49,159
It`s too sweet

1130
01:32:51,033 --> 01:32:53,001
It`s sour.
- ShaII I show you how to make it?

1131
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:55,497
ShaII I come in?

1132
01:32:56,038 --> 01:32:57,835
Let`s go home and make it

1133
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:01,376
What an idea!

1134
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,379
I`II woo your father
with food

1135
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:09,349
Okay, but do you know his Iikes?

1136
01:33:12,088 --> 01:33:16,024
I`m the chef of the best Indian
restaurant in London. I know my job

1137
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:18,859
Okay? Just chiII then

1138
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:22,462
Just chiII.
- I wiII

1139
01:33:22,632 --> 01:33:23,860
I know what my job is

1140
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:26,534
So you just watch.
Watch what I do to your dad

1141
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:33,397
Mr Buddha is working very hard.
What`s coming up?

1142
01:33:35,912 --> 01:33:37,209
Gourd?

1143
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:46,547
BeII-pIant, potato... peas

1144
01:33:46,923 --> 01:33:47,890
Good

1145
01:33:50,927 --> 01:33:53,395
Get everything you have,
I`II start

1146
01:33:55,932 --> 01:33:57,229
That`s aII

1147
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,957
Looks Iike your restaurant
is vegetarian

1148
01:34:01,137 --> 01:34:05,904
No chicken?
- No. You foIIow Gandhiji`s ideaIs...

1149
01:34:06,142 --> 01:34:09,407
I`m a Gandhian throughout the week, but
vegetarian onIy once a week. Tuesday

1150
01:34:09,946 --> 01:34:12,915
UnIess I have chicken, I don`t
feeI Iike I have eaten anything

1151
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:17,851
Long way to go before I turn vegan.
My system is stiII working strong

1152
01:34:18,554 --> 01:34:21,853
Looks Iike Mr Buddha`s system
has rusted

1153
01:34:23,059 --> 01:34:25,527
Seema, get yesterday`s chicken
from the refrigerator

1154
01:34:26,095 --> 01:34:31,362
What a discipIe of Gandhiji!
He wouId stress on vegetarian food

1155
01:34:32,902 --> 01:34:35,370
That oId diabetic eats chicken
that is vegetarian

1156
01:34:35,905 --> 01:34:38,874
The oId man is not the probIem,
Buddha is

1157
01:34:39,942 --> 01:34:44,208
Don`t feed him, make him drink.
Forget your ideas,

1158
01:34:44,947 --> 01:34:47,245
just caII him over
and teII him everything

1159
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,217
Amrish Puri, Pran, K.N Singh,

1160
01:34:54,924 --> 01:34:58,223
Vat 69... I have even
had the viIIains` drink

1161
01:34:59,929 --> 01:35:03,888
Try everything in Iife
but never be a sIave to any habit

1162
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:10,232
Once you become a sIave, it takes
200 years to gain independence

1163
01:35:11,273 --> 01:35:16,176
Once a whiIe doesn`t make a sIave out
of you, doesn`t increase the sugar IeveI

1164
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:22,339
Don`t you ever feeI IoneIy?

1165
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,018
It`s aImost 25 years since
Nina`s mother passed away

1166
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:35,857
Never saw anyone after that?

1167
01:35:36,265 --> 01:35:37,232
What?

1168
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:39,532
Never thought of marrying again?

1169
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:44,366
No, Mr Buddha.
ActuaIIy,

1170
01:35:44,707 --> 01:35:46,868
every age has its own purpose

1171
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:51,373
PIay during chiIdhood,
enjoy during youth,

1172
01:35:51,647 --> 01:35:54,878
then enjoy your married Iife,
and in oId age...

1173
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:58,887
controI, seIf-discipIine.
Time to go

1174
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:01,056
Prepare for the Iast journey.
That`s it

1175
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:04,887
Marrying again?
What use marrying at our age?

1176
01:36:05,127 --> 01:36:06,094
No, no

1177
01:36:06,295 --> 01:36:08,889
I`m worried about Nina of course

1178
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:17,335
Mr Buddha, you must be knowing some
young men of about 35 in London

1179
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:21,001
A good-Iooking boy, you know.
PIease think about Nina

1180
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:26,981
PIease think
whiIe I go to the Ioo

1181
01:36:45,434 --> 01:36:47,402
Too much of soda

1182
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:58,880
I want to marry your daughter

1183
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,842
W... three times W

1184
01:37:37,887 --> 01:37:38,854
ScoundreI!

1185
01:37:50,065 --> 01:37:51,032
Who?

1186
01:37:53,569 --> 01:37:57,027
That swine wants to marry you

1187
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:58,406
Disgusting

1188
01:37:58,908 --> 01:38:00,876
Even I want to marry him

1189
01:38:02,578 --> 01:38:04,876
What...?

1190
01:38:05,915 --> 01:38:07,883
What? What did you say?

1191
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:13,387
How can you marry him?
I won`t Iet you commit this mistake

1192
01:38:13,656 --> 01:38:16,819
He is your father`s age.
- No. He`s six years oIder than you

1193
01:38:18,527 --> 01:38:20,495
I don`t approve of this aIIiance

1194
01:38:21,597 --> 01:38:26,159
ApprovaI? But who is asking you?
We are teIIing you

1195
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:31,039
AII right

1196
01:38:31,607 --> 01:38:35,236
Then Iet me aIso teII you.
This is not happening when I`m aIive

1197
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:37,174
So when are you Ieaving?

1198
01:38:51,894 --> 01:38:52,861
Sorry

1199
01:38:58,567 --> 01:39:01,866
Papa, what`s the probIem
if your son-in-Iaw is your age?

1200
01:39:03,973 --> 01:39:08,034
You think he won`t respect you?
Of course, he wiII

1201
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:11,880
You think he won`t caII you Papa?
Of course, he wiII

1202
01:39:16,185 --> 01:39:18,153
I`m thinking about you

1203
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,489
I`m thinking about you !

1204
01:39:23,225 --> 01:39:26,194
Look my chiId, how Iong
wiII he be aIive?

1205
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:31,158
Five more years? Ten years?
Afterwards?

1206
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:35,160
Papa, I Iove Buddha,
not his age

1207
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:43,500
Rather than Iiving fifty years
with someone I don`t Iove,

1208
01:39:43,879 --> 01:39:46,848
I`d prefer to Iive five or ten years
with someone I Iove

1209
01:39:47,683 --> 01:39:52,177
Besides, who can foreteII
someone`s age?

1210
01:39:53,222 --> 01:39:55,850
Mummy was younger than you
but she died before you

1211
01:39:56,325 --> 01:39:57,849
Just shut up

1212
01:40:02,097 --> 01:40:05,533
Won`t you be happy
with someone your age?

1213
01:40:05,901 --> 01:40:08,369
What are you raving about age, Papa?

1214
01:40:09,905 --> 01:40:13,363
Now I Iove someone who`s not my age
and I can`t heIp it

1215
01:40:15,644 --> 01:40:17,475
That`s my destiny

1216
01:40:18,847 --> 01:40:20,974
You may consider it my bad Iuck
or whatever

1217
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:25,813
Let`s eat

1218
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:38,355
Nina... stop!

1219
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:41,831
Stop, I say!

1220
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:45,173
Greens, what happened?

1221
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,176
I`m your bad Iuck, eh?

1222
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:50,841
Greens, what bad Iuck?

1223
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,844
I wanted to make Iight of the matter,
it was a sIip of tongue

1224
01:40:54,416 --> 01:40:58,011
The biggest truth aIways is a sIip
of tongue, to make Iight of the matter

1225
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:02,023
The truth is, I`m six years oIder
to your father

1226
01:41:03,425 --> 01:41:05,393
The truth is, you are just 34

1227
01:41:06,095 --> 01:41:10,361
The truth is, after 34 IoneIy years,
IoneIiness scares a woman

1228
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:13,868
Because of that very apprehensiveness,
you thought that if you dump me,

1229
01:41:14,036 --> 01:41:16,129
you won`t find another
after two more years

1230
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:18,473
That`s the harshest truth
of our reIationship

1231
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:25,470
Another truth.
You can easiIy find a young man

1232
01:41:26,515 --> 01:41:29,814
So?
- Go and marry someone your age

1233
01:41:30,019 --> 01:41:31,816
Do you know anyone?

1234
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:35,357
Got any picture of him?

1235
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:40,988
Goodbye!
- C`mon Greens! What is this?

1236
01:41:41,864 --> 01:41:43,832
ShaII I serve food, sir?

1237
01:41:44,533 --> 01:41:45,500
Food?

1238
01:41:47,202 --> 01:41:51,161
Not even a drop of water
untiI she drops him

1239
01:41:54,209 --> 01:41:59,841
What a stuffed stomach cannot achieve,
an empty stomach wiII

1240
01:42:00,682 --> 01:42:02,172
Come on now...
- Lady,

1241
01:42:02,418 --> 01:42:05,182
your father is not eating.
- Oh heII

1242
01:42:05,554 --> 01:42:07,181
I`m coming

1243
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:10,847
Got to go. If he doesn`t eat,
it`II affect his sugar IeveI

1244
01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:13,856
Airport, pIease

1245
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:17,465
Why airport?
- This pickup doesn`t pIy to London

1246
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:21,458
Go and feed your father. He`II find
someone your age onIy if he Iives

1247
01:42:26,008 --> 01:42:28,977
Tears for your bad Iuck, eh?
WeII?

1248
01:42:30,345 --> 01:42:34,338
Oh, for aII your favours,
a 64 year-oId didn`t return any

1249
01:42:41,023 --> 01:42:42,012
Move

1250
01:42:56,405 --> 01:42:59,841
``O my Iove, ``

1251
01:43:00,876 --> 01:43:03,845
Cut that background music, wiII you?
- ``I can`t Iive without you...``

1252
01:43:12,888 --> 01:43:13,855
Hi

1253
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:17,856
What`s up? You sound weak

1254
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:23,198
I`m coming back,
I can`t carry it on

1255
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:26,197
Come back, but for a probIem

1256
01:43:27,102 --> 01:43:30,401
With me,
you wiII be a widow soon

1257
01:43:32,107 --> 01:43:34,405
Hey Sexy, widow is a term
used for women

1258
01:43:35,444 --> 01:43:38,038
Correction.
You wiII be a maIe widow

1259
01:43:40,916 --> 01:43:42,543
What`s your D VD score?

1260
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:45,882
Four to go.
WiII be over tonight

1261
01:43:46,455 --> 01:43:48,218
Four in a night?

1262
01:43:48,423 --> 01:43:50,891
Of course. I`m watching it
in fast-forward

1263
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:54,224
Why fast-forward?
- There`s nothing in it

1264
01:43:55,264 --> 01:43:56,891
You conned me

1265
01:43:58,133 --> 01:43:59,896
How do you know what happens
in aduIt movies?

1266
01:44:00,602 --> 01:44:04,436
This is what happens when a cartoon
watcher goes to buy aduIt movies

1267
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:07,568
Where is she?

1268
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:09,077
Who?

1269
01:44:09,244 --> 01:44:12,907
Leg Kebab.
You caII her Leg Kebab, don`t you?

1270
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:16,515
I used to

1271
01:44:16,919 --> 01:44:19,183
Used to?
And she used to caII you...?

1272
01:44:20,489 --> 01:44:22,354
Forget it.
- TeII me

1273
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:27,859
Greens.
- So cute

1274
01:44:28,564 --> 01:44:31,192
You eat greens
and you can see onIy grass

1275
01:44:32,067 --> 01:44:37,198
Apt name. Has Leg Kebab
had a quarreI with Greens?

1276
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:41,409
Hmm.
- What does hmm transIate to?

1277
01:44:43,946 --> 01:44:45,914
You must`ve certainIy said something
in a rage

1278
01:44:46,582 --> 01:44:49,551
What did I say? She is doing me
a favour by marrying me

1279
01:44:50,185 --> 01:44:54,383
DarIing, what eIse wouId she do?

1280
01:44:55,257 --> 01:44:59,216
Everyone with you
is doing you a favour

1281
01:44:59,995 --> 01:45:04,557
Am I so eviI?
- The others are too good, that`s it

1282
01:45:05,467 --> 01:45:08,903
Where`s Leg Kebab?
ApoIogise to her soon

1283
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:12,902
Why apoIogise?
- Sorry doesn`t reduce one`s height

1284
01:45:15,077 --> 01:45:19,013
Why don`t you come to India, Sexy?
- It takes 9 hours to reach India

1285
01:45:20,048 --> 01:45:24,849
Who has time, boss?
I have to finish four D VDs

1286
01:45:25,921 --> 01:45:29,857
Don`t waste my time,
go and waste Leg Kebab`s time

1287
01:45:30,058 --> 01:45:32,856
ApoIogise to her.
- AII right, there`s no hurry

1288
01:45:33,428 --> 01:45:35,396
Looks Iike you have
a Iot of time

1289
01:45:37,432 --> 01:45:40,060
Lend me some time, pIease.
- Hey Sexy

1290
01:45:40,902 --> 01:45:43,871
Don`t waste time, baby. Bye

1291
01:46:01,256 --> 01:46:02,883
Attention pIease

1292
01:46:03,925 --> 01:46:06,894
Due to fIoods of tears
aII the runways have been shut

1293
01:46:08,263 --> 01:46:11,391
AII fIights to London have been
canceIIed for a few days

1294
01:46:13,935 --> 01:46:15,835
PIease take the troubIe
to come outside

1295
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:18,835
Inconvenience caused
is greatIy regretted

1296
01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:35,853
Hey Leg Kebab,

1297
01:46:38,427 --> 01:46:40,361
want some chicken?

1298
01:46:42,898 --> 01:46:45,867
Papa hasn`t eaten yet.
- He wiII

1299
01:46:49,338 --> 01:46:51,363
Nimazuddin`s famous
Karim Chicken Kebab

1300
01:46:52,974 --> 01:46:55,534
Did you go to Nimazuddin so Iate?
- No

1301
01:46:57,112 --> 01:46:59,376
The chicken came on its own
from Nimazuddin

1302
01:47:03,985 --> 01:47:06,886
How come the mere mention of chicken
stop your tears?

1303
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:09,557
C`mon

1304
01:47:17,666 --> 01:47:18,826
Papa...

1305
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:22,331
come downstairs and eat something

1306
01:47:28,343 --> 01:47:30,334
Chicken.
You Iove it, don`t you?

1307
01:47:33,048 --> 01:47:34,345
Get up

1308
01:47:40,489 --> 01:47:42,354
Get that man out first

1309
01:47:56,071 --> 01:47:57,868
Have it

1310
01:48:01,443 --> 01:48:03,377
WiII you drop him?

1311
01:48:07,282 --> 01:48:10,877
AII right.
Then I`II Ieave this body

1312
01:48:15,056 --> 01:48:16,819
As you wish, Papa

1313
01:48:50,091 --> 01:48:51,854
Seema, tea...

1314
01:48:57,165 --> 01:48:59,030
Tea, sir.
- Go!

1315
01:49:07,108 --> 01:49:13,877
``The enIightened one...``

1316
01:49:14,883 --> 01:49:20,321
``knows the pain of others``

1317
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:51,175
``He does good to others, ``

1318
01:49:53,054 --> 01:49:58,356
``yet he does not Iet pride
enter his mind``

1319
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:26,487
``He toIerates and praises...``

1320
01:50:26,855 --> 01:50:29,824
``the entire worId, ``

1321
01:50:30,859 --> 01:50:34,818
``never criticizes anyone``

1322
01:50:45,407 --> 01:50:49,343
``His words and thoughts...``

1323
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:52,839
``are pure``

1324
01:50:53,882 --> 01:50:59,843
``BIessed is your mother``

1325
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:17,497
Hi

1326
01:51:17,839 --> 01:51:20,307
Greens, do something

1327
01:51:20,842 --> 01:51:22,810
Hasn`t eaten yet,
stiII acting, eh?

1328
01:51:24,012 --> 01:51:26,879
If his sugar IeveI faIIs,
he`II go into a coma. I`II be there

1329
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:29,817
No, don`t come here,
eIse...

1330
01:51:30,852 --> 01:51:34,811
For aII the things Gandhiji taught us,
did he just Iearn this much?

1331
01:51:35,857 --> 01:51:37,552
Can`t heIp it

1332
01:51:38,259 --> 01:51:41,285
HoId him tight, open his mouth
and force orange juice into it

1333
01:51:41,863 --> 01:51:46,197
I did try.
Do something, Greens

1334
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:55,009
Isn`t committing suicide
stiII a crime in this country?

1335
01:51:57,946 --> 01:51:59,846
Can I heIp you?

1336
01:52:00,382 --> 01:52:02,850
Someone is trying to commit suicide,
I want you to stop him

1337
01:52:03,585 --> 01:52:06,179
You mean...
- Someone is attempting suicide,

1338
01:52:06,388 --> 01:52:09,357
I want you to stop him.
- Okay...

1339
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:11,525
you mean he hasn`t
committed suicide yet, he wiII?

1340
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:15,454
He`s trying.
PIease stop him before he succeeds

1341
01:52:17,999 --> 01:52:20,797
You mean the person is on top
of a buiIding and...

1342
01:52:21,036 --> 01:52:22,970
No. He`s in his own house

1343
01:52:24,839 --> 01:52:27,808
You mean, he`s hanging himseIf?
Or has he taken sedatives...?

1344
01:52:28,043 --> 01:52:30,011
He`s not even taking sedatives

1345
01:52:30,311 --> 01:52:33,803
He has stopped eating.
He`s not had anything since two days

1346
01:52:34,949 --> 01:52:36,814
He`s starving himseIf to death

1347
01:52:38,053 --> 01:52:40,817
You mean non-vioIence?
- Nothing great about it

1348
01:52:42,023 --> 01:52:45,823
He`s actuaIIy threatening us, he
doesn`t want his daughter to marry me

1349
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:50,498
I can understand.
- What can you understand?

1350
01:52:50,999 --> 01:52:52,830
I mean... your grief

1351
01:52:53,101 --> 01:52:54,830
In fact, I`m angry

1352
01:52:56,538 --> 01:52:58,836
It`s not a serious probIem, sir

1353
01:52:59,174 --> 01:53:01,506
Is there a minor soIution
to this minor probIem?

1354
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:05,511
Yes. TeII him, you are
dumping his daughter,

1355
01:53:06,181 --> 01:53:08,172
you are not marrying her.
He wiII eat

1356
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:15,853
Then you can take the girI away
and marry her quietIy in some tempIe

1357
01:53:16,891 --> 01:53:18,518
BriIIiant idea

1358
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,860
If I wanted to do that,
why`d I come to you?

1359
01:53:22,564 --> 01:53:24,532
Arrest him pIease.
He can`t bIackmaiI us

1360
01:53:25,233 --> 01:53:28,862
We are IawfuIIy right,
he is committing a crime

1361
01:53:29,204 --> 01:53:32,196
It`s an attempt to commit suicide.
PIease arrest him for that,

1362
01:53:32,907 --> 01:53:34,875
feed him forcibIy
and rid us of our worries

1363
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:37,374
Sir... pIease forgive me

1364
01:53:37,712 --> 01:53:41,375
I`m heIpIess. If you say,
I can go with you and advice him

1365
01:53:42,117 --> 01:53:45,883
But I can`t arrest him.
I can`t arrest anyone...

1366
01:53:46,087 --> 01:53:49,887
who is starving
and protesting non-vioIentIy

1367
01:53:50,191 --> 01:53:52,887
Besides, we consider
such peopIe great

1368
01:53:53,261 --> 01:53:57,220
Nobody has escaped in our country after
arresting a foIIower of non-vioIence

1369
01:53:57,432 --> 01:53:59,229
Give and take?

1370
01:54:01,936 --> 01:54:07,897
No sir. In this matter, we can take,
but we cannot give. Sorry

1371
01:54:08,343 --> 01:54:10,243
How do I feed her father now?

1372
01:54:21,422 --> 01:54:22,389
HeIIo

1373
01:54:29,097 --> 01:54:31,361
Where`s my daughter-in-Iaw?
- At her father`s

1374
01:54:32,033 --> 01:54:33,864
He has given up food.
- What?

1375
01:54:43,244 --> 01:54:44,541
Let`s go.
- Where?

1376
01:54:44,712 --> 01:54:47,203
You are a great chef,
aren`t you ashamed?

1377
01:54:47,448 --> 01:54:50,076
Can`t you feed a hungry man?
C`mon

1378
01:55:03,097 --> 01:55:05,395
Is he dead?
- No. It`s onIy the second day

1379
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:08,395
He`II survive for two more days.
- Oh no, four more days at Ieast

1380
01:55:08,937 --> 01:55:10,905
At Ieast a week.
- Wanna bet?

1381
01:55:14,409 --> 01:55:16,036
No, wait

1382
01:55:23,618 --> 01:55:24,846
HeIIo

1383
01:55:30,091 --> 01:55:32,855
HoIy water. Give him some

1384
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:51,875
Sir pIease...
- Don`t touch me

1385
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,877
Don`t touch me

1386
01:56:09,264 --> 01:56:10,629
HoIy water!

1387
01:56:12,934 --> 01:56:14,492
Liberates your souI

1388
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:17,838
Don`t worry, I`m not taking your girI
away nor am I going to feed you

1389
01:56:21,609 --> 01:56:23,839
Excuse me... I`m taIking to you

1390
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:29,346
I`m... sorry, I`m six years oIder
to you, show me some respect

1391
01:56:38,426 --> 01:56:42,863
What`s your probIem? Same?
Same oId... what wiII peopIe say?

1392
01:56:43,698 --> 01:56:45,063
I don`t think so

1393
01:56:45,266 --> 01:56:47,860
If you cared for peopIe, you wouIdn`t
Iet her be singIe for 34 years

1394
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:52,369
So, what-wiII-peopIe-say
is not your probIem

1395
01:56:54,142 --> 01:56:57,873
You don`t care for others.
Maybe you care for your daughter

1396
01:56:59,514 --> 01:57:00,538
Yes?

1397
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:07,544
Worried about your daughter?

1398
01:57:09,457 --> 01:57:13,257
AIcohoIic, gambIer, wastreI, hopeIess
... I`m none of those

1399
01:57:14,228 --> 01:57:17,629
If you are worried about what`II happen
to her after I die... I`m insured

1400
01:57:18,066 --> 01:57:19,829
She`II be taken care of.
No probIem

1401
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:24,838
Then what`s your probIem?

1402
01:57:25,073 --> 01:57:27,837
No, don`t... what`s your probIem?

1403
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:30,167
What`s your probIem?

1404
01:57:30,345 --> 01:57:32,336
What is the probIem?

1405
01:57:33,481 --> 01:57:35,346
That, I am 30 years oIder to her?

1406
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:38,514
OId women now are
marrying young boys

1407
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:41,848
We`re not breaking norms,
we`re foIIowing traditions

1408
01:57:42,056 --> 01:57:45,856
No probIem there at aII.
So, is the reaI probIem my age?

1409
01:57:47,295 --> 01:57:50,230
I`m over 21 years oId.
PerfectIy IegaI marriageabIe age

1410
01:57:50,631 --> 01:57:53,862
No probIem there at aII.
I`m 64 years oId, I`m...

1411
01:57:55,436 --> 01:57:58,530
Hey, is that your probIem?

1412
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,869
64 years?

1413
01:58:04,312 --> 01:58:06,280
What is age, after aII?

1414
01:58:06,981 --> 01:58:08,881
This... this?

1415
01:58:09,283 --> 01:58:13,879
Body doesn`t determine a man`s age,
mind does. It`s aII in the bIoody mind

1416
01:58:15,023 --> 01:58:18,823
And anyway, a man grows oId when he is
no more interested in Iiving

1417
01:58:19,027 --> 01:58:22,827
I`ve just begun to Iove Iife,
so me being 64 is not a probIem

1418
01:58:23,398 --> 01:58:25,366
Sixty-four years is not a probIem

1419
01:58:25,867 --> 01:58:27,494
PIease teII him to go

1420
01:58:27,869 --> 01:58:31,327
What? What? Drink some water and say
cIearIy whatever you have to say

1421
01:58:31,873 --> 01:58:34,341
If you speak cIearIy,
I`II hear cIearIy. Common sense

1422
01:58:36,411 --> 01:58:38,504
CouId common sense be your probIem?

1423
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,841
No, common sense
can`t be your probIem

1424
01:58:43,051 --> 01:58:46,020
Because you do have the sense that
if you don`t drink water, you wiII die

1425
01:58:46,621 --> 01:58:49,021
If you die, you wiII Ieave
your daughter`s hand

1426
01:58:50,691 --> 01:58:53,057
Two hours... peopIe wiII mourn
for onIy two hours

1427
01:58:53,227 --> 01:58:56,025
PeopIe don`t have much time nowadays.
Everyone wiII go home

1428
01:58:56,197 --> 01:58:59,030
I`II be the onIy one staying back
to hoId your daughter`s arm. Damn

1429
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:02,863
That much common sense
you do have, hundred percent

1430
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:10,036
ActuaIIy,

1431
01:59:11,712 --> 01:59:13,202
couId jeaIousy be your reaI probIem?

1432
01:59:18,853 --> 01:59:19,979
ActuaIIy

1433
01:59:21,522 --> 01:59:25,185
Come to think of it,
your probIem is envy

1434
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:28,356
You are jeaIous.
Just pIain, simpIe jeaIous

1435
01:59:31,566 --> 01:59:36,162
Your phiIosophy of oId age was
prayers, good and Bhaji

1436
01:59:36,404 --> 01:59:38,372
The thought of us together
messed up your brains...

1437
01:59:38,606 --> 01:59:44,010
how can somebody`s oId age be
so coIourfuI! It made you jeaIous, yes?

1438
01:59:44,312 --> 01:59:46,280
That`s it. That`s your probIem
You are jeaIous

1439
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:49,844
That`s his probIem.
His probIem is that he is jeaIous

1440
01:59:51,052 --> 01:59:54,852
Don`t dare touch me!
The man is pIain and simpIe jeaIous

1441
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:57,180
JeaIous means?

1442
02:00:01,062 --> 02:00:03,860
You are doing what every man
who is jeaIous of beauty does

1443
02:00:04,565 --> 02:00:06,362
Trying to destroy beauty

1444
02:00:06,567 --> 02:00:11,869
You thought, how can an oId man be so
happy when I am myseIf ruing oId age!

1445
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:15,969
Of course, you are jeaIous.
You are just jeaIous

1446
02:00:18,579 --> 02:00:20,547
Get up and drink some water

1447
02:00:22,049 --> 02:00:23,346
I can see everything cIearIy now

1448
02:00:23,518 --> 02:00:25,486
C`mon, drink some water

1449
02:00:32,093 --> 02:00:33,560
JeaIousy makes one bIind

1450
02:00:33,928 --> 02:00:35,828
Gandhiji`s Satyagraha
benefitted the country

1451
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:39,830
This meIodrama of yours wiII onIy put
your daughter in a Ioss, nothing eIse

1452
02:00:42,069 --> 02:00:44,833
You think if I go away
she wiII marry someone eIse?

1453
02:00:45,072 --> 02:00:46,835
She won`t. Wanna bet?

1454
02:00:47,108 --> 02:00:50,168
She`II grow up but she`II stiII be
singIe, onIy because of your jeaIousy

1455
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:55,844
Three seconds... it takes
onIy three seconds to marry

1456
02:00:57,218 --> 02:00:59,015
Where`s the vermiIIion?

1457
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:01,848
Here it is

1458
02:01:03,224 --> 02:01:05,192
ShaII I appIy it?

1459
02:01:05,626 --> 02:01:07,184
ShaII I ?

1460
02:01:08,529 --> 02:01:09,860
ShaII I ?

1461
02:01:10,131 --> 02:01:13,032
See? To keep you aIive,
she is kiIIing herseIf

1462
02:01:13,634 --> 02:01:15,795
And here you are...
are you her father? Sure?

1463
02:01:17,505 --> 02:01:21,464
What a father! You are going through
so much to snatch your daughter`s Iife

1464
02:01:25,413 --> 02:01:29,315
Dammit! You can`t be her father

1465
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:31,477
He is not her father

1466
02:01:40,461 --> 02:01:44,989
What an acidic tongue!
Like mine

1467
02:02:03,084 --> 02:02:04,847
Stop the car

1468
02:02:26,974 --> 02:02:29,465
``My IoneIy, Iost eyes...``

1469
02:02:29,844 --> 02:02:31,471
``Iook for you...``

1470
02:02:32,446 --> 02:02:34,812
``madIy``

1471
02:02:35,416 --> 02:02:38,146
``When wiII you come, ``

1472
02:02:38,352 --> 02:02:40,320
``asks my souI...``

1473
02:02:40,855 --> 02:02:43,153
``madIy``

1474
02:02:43,324 --> 02:02:46,157
``I`m here, ``

1475
02:02:47,662 --> 02:02:51,325
``where are you?``

1476
02:02:51,899 --> 02:02:54,834
``Listen to my cries``

1477
02:03:52,927 --> 02:03:56,226
That`s why I aIways teII you to
go to the gym

1478
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:06,566
Don`t you become a vegan

1479
02:04:25,559 --> 02:04:26,526
Greens,

1480
02:04:29,096 --> 02:04:30,927
you Ieft your chutney, didn`t you?

1481
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,533
Where are you?

1482
02:04:34,902 --> 02:04:35,869
Qutub

1483
02:04:36,137 --> 02:04:37,536
I`m coming

1484
02:04:50,184 --> 02:04:51,947
Did the oId man agree?

1485
02:04:53,587 --> 02:04:55,885
WonderfuI

1486
02:04:57,391 --> 02:05:00,883
I couId die for this

1487
02:05:01,095 --> 02:05:03,063
A speII is cast

1488
02:05:03,297 --> 02:05:06,266
A wedding is happening here

1489
02:05:14,041 --> 02:05:16,009
Sexy has Ieft us, Buddha

1490
02:05:20,147 --> 02:05:21,842
She`s gone

1491
02:05:22,616 --> 02:05:25,847
She`s gone, Buddha.
Just five minutes back

1492
02:05:29,223 --> 02:05:31,054
What happened?

1493
02:06:03,924 --> 02:06:06,222
Ma... I want Sexy

1494
02:06:08,429 --> 02:06:10,226
Ma, pIease heIp me

1495
02:06:14,602 --> 02:06:16,502
Ma, pIease heIp me

1496
02:06:17,872 --> 02:06:21,831
Ma, pIease heIp me join
my hands for Sexy

1497
02:06:27,214 --> 02:06:30,843
My mistake, Ma.
I`ve done a huge mistake

Ma, I want Sexy

1502
02:07:24,071 --> 02:07:25,368
Hey Greens

1503
02:07:26,106 --> 02:07:29,007
Hey NoodIes, give me company

1504
02:07:29,877 --> 02:07:31,845
I know how much you Iove Sexy

1505
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,344
Why must you reduce that Iove
to tears?

1506
02:07:37,117 --> 02:07:40,848
These tears make
the Iove fade away graduaIIy

1507
02:07:41,288 --> 02:07:43,188
Want to know how?

1508
02:07:43,557 --> 02:07:45,855
Why do we cry?
Because our heart is heavy

1509
02:07:46,226 --> 02:07:47,158
Heavy-heavy

1510
02:07:47,294 --> 02:07:50,195
The heart is heavy
because it`s fiIIed with Iove

1511
02:07:50,898 --> 02:07:54,356
Shedding tears
makes the heart Iight

1512
02:07:55,102 --> 02:07:59,198
Why does it Iighten the heart?
Because the Iove in the heart...

1513
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:02,234
sIowIy and graduaIIy
goes out in tears

1514
02:08:03,243 --> 02:08:06,872
The immense Iove that
you have for Sexy,

1515
02:08:08,115 --> 02:08:10,049
why do you want to
wash it away in tears?

1516
02:08:10,918 --> 02:08:12,886
You were happy
that`s why you are sad now

1517
02:08:13,087 --> 02:08:15,317
So be happy-sad, not sad-sad

1518
02:08:23,197 --> 02:08:25,165
