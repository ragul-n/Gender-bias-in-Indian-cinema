1
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,417
This whole game is
about the food chain, man.

2
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:31,125
We all are a part of it.

3
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,167
Grasshoppers eat grass.

4
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,000
Then the grasshopper's
eaten by a rat.

5
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,458
Then the bloody snake is going
to slither in and eat up the rat.

6
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,458
And at the very end,

7
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:48,500
will come the hawk,
flying in from the sky.

8
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,458
It'll grab the snake
and eat it up.

9
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,208
That completes the food chain.

10
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,375
No humans in the food chain?

11
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,708
Yes, of course.-
- How is that?

12
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,042
Humans don't eat hawks!

13
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:07,792
Trained hawks used to sit on
sailors' arms on ship decks.

14
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,125
Wearing all the smuggled
chains around its neck.

15
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,042
Whenever there was a
custom's raid,

16
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,542
it used to fly around for sometime
and come back; that bugger!

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,750
Humans don't eat hawks.

18
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,542
They consume the hawk's
opinion of right and wrong.

19
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,792
Humans tame hawks,
Inspector Laltoo Das.

20
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,542
Yes but not all hawks
can be tamed, right?

21
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,250
Can be killed but not tamed.

22
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:39,417
Err.. you're talking about
your uncle man, huh?

23
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,042
By God!
That man was something else.

24
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,750
Now listen man, listen to me. Okay?

25
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,750
4 shops are yet
to pay, 26, 7, 8 and 31

26
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,292
3 warehouses in Gunj...-

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,083
- Hey! Do the counting later.
Just say it's ten lacs.

28
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,125
Easy guys, easy on the guns.
Hang on, I'm talking, give me a minute.

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Now listen motherfucker, I
don't know where and how...

30
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,750
just get us the
fucking ten lacs, okay!

31
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,875
Kidnap people, loot a bank,
call the Syndicate.

32
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,417
Call Basheer, Qasim, Rani,
whoever, just get us the ten lacs!-

33
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,875
- Tony, disconnect.-
- Huh?

34
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,208
Disconnect, bro.

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,125
Why did you ask
him to disconnect?

36
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you the leader?-
- What!

37
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,750
Are you the boss of the gang?

38
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:51,000
Bugger! Why do you
care? If you...-

39
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,375
- You guys won't do anything.

40
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:57,167
Standing with your guns pointed
at a wrong angle for 2 hours!

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,833
Not a drop of bloodshed yet!

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,625
You do your kidnapping
with these idiots?

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,417
- You!-
- Shut up you moron!

44
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,333
I don't know whether to laugh
or cry at your audacity!

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,292
Do you even know who
you've picked up?

46
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:16,667
You think I am a petty
pick-pocket?

47
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,458
So you're asking
for ten lacs only!

48
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,083
Tony...

49
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,958
call the Syndicate.

50
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,583
Tell them these guys have
a new demand. Fifty lacs.-

51
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,833
- But Zulfi bhai...-
- Within 4 hours.

52
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:36,333
"Or you'll find Zulfiqar Ahmed in pieces,
in a sack near Ghasia Mosque."

53
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,000
- But seriously, man! Fifty lacs!-
- Just call.

54
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,625
Do it, will you?

55
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,542
This area.

56
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,792
A small country inside
the city of Kolkata.

57
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,208
Yes, a country.

58
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,917
Only, without a national
anthem and a flag.

59
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:01,875
They have their own language,
economic system, law and order.

60
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,750
Even today, the police does
not enter some of those areas.

61
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,500
Keep that in mind.

62
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,292
And they have their
own politics.

63
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,375
They hardly care about
political parties or ideologies.

64
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,458
It's all handled by
certain big shots.

65
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:23,458
What the residents of this area think
about you is the main thing. That's it.

66
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:27,167
The rest is like the Mango
and Hilsa fish... seasonal.

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,125
The Left might turn Right
the Answer might be the Question.

68
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,625
The compass is confused.

69
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,125
Lemon tea?

70
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,250
No...-

71
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:47,125
Have the tea. Habits also need
a handover like the files.

72
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,667
Dulal!

73
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:54,708
Ask Puchke to send in
two cups of lemon tea.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,250
And...

75
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,000
when is Mr. Akhtar
sending the car?

76
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,000
Around 4 o'clock.-
- There's time then. Go.

77
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,833
So, as I was saying...

78
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,917
the areas economy,
their income and expenditure...

79
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,667
depends upon various
kinds of business.

80
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,375
Some of it, legal and...

81
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,875
most of it as the locals call,

82
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,833
'un-legal'.

83
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:26,833
From supplying coolies to stevedore
companies for unloading the ships,

84
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,667
to renting out godowns
to dump the stuff there.

85
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:31,917
Corruption,

86
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,042
commission,

87
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,375
and huge monetary transactions
are predominant.

88
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,167
The parking charges
for the trucks,

89
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:42,333
renting out slums to the coolies,
all of it is a huge business.

90
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,000
And after the Nancy
market opened in 1970,

91
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,542
a new avenue opened up.

92
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,458
Trading of smuggled goods.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,792
Goods stolen from ships,
containers or from the warehouses,

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,125
being sold in an open market.

95
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,542
An entire area's commercial system
formed around this trade.

96
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,042
Funny thing is...

97
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,417
This is Puchke.

98
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,208
After him.

99
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,417
Sir, are you leaving?

100
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes, transferred. I'll
come down sometimes.

101
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:22,708
And control your drinking.
Or else you'll get a thrashing.

102
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,500
So, what was I saying?

103
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,792
About the 'system'.

104
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,833
Yes, the 'system'.

105
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,250
This system has many partakers.

106
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,792
You'll understand that
when a ship is mauled.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,417
Mauled?

108
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:43,292
When government declares a ship
to be unfit, it is put up for auction.

109
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,542
Then the buyer breaks it down
into pieces and sells it off.

110
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:52,542
But dismantling the
whale sized ship,

111
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,583
competing in the
auction to make a buy,

112
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,958
all this needs a lot of
help from various people.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,083
Political leaders,

114
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,375
the police,

115
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,708
owner of the Coolie Supply Association,
the leader of the Coolie Union,

116
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,333
Custom officers, Port Trust officers,

117
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,000
the Truck Drivers' Association,
goons, container breakers..

118
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,417
Ship builders, slum builders etc.

119
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,292
Naturally, each of them
has a profit share.

120
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,708
So, the empire is run by many
parties and sharerholders together.

121
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,708
Some help actively,
some passively, right?

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,833
Correct.

123
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:26,792
And this group of people
is unofficialy called...

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,292
the Syndicate.

125
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,917
Which is present in each
and every alley of this area.

126
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,708
A gigantic spider with its legs
inside each and every kind of trade.

127
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,833
And exactly like the spider's web,

128
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,500
every trade is interconnected
to form the Syndicate's web.

129
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:58,083
But, you see spiders
eat their own babies too.

130
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,583
As in?

131
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,375
No one ever came back alive
after opposing the Syndicate.

132
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,167
1984, DC Port, K. V. Sharma.

133
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,500
Not at all!

134
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,167
He was a natural enemy,
one of them had to die.

135
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:19,333
The dangerous thing is, the Syndicate
doesn't even spare its own members.

136
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,250
How is that?

137
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,500
Whenever a member of the
Syndicate becomes popular,

138
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:29,042
when people start revering him,

139
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,542
his days are numbered.

140
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
That's what I was telling you.

141
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,333
Whoever is the people's favourite,
has all the power.

142
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:41,208
The Syndicate dosen't let the
power go to a single person.

143
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,250
So, one has to be a wolf
in a pack. One can't be a lion.

144
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,208
Once, someone did become a lion.

145
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,875
1990, Nawabzada.

146
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,792
Very secular.

147
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,000
A father figure to all...
Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.

148
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,417
Immensely popular and powerful.

149
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,333
He was shot on the day
of Rathayatra Festival.

150
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,875
Syndicate?

151
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,667
1997, Ram Singh or Ramaiya,
same problem.

152
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,667
Though he was the messiah of Hindus...

153
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,250
he became a strong-arm
member of the Syndicate.

154
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,792
He was bombed to pieces
in front of his own house.

155
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,917
Bombed?

156
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,250
More to come.

157
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:33,750
2001, a coolie supplier named
Akbar, became a big don.

158
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:40,917
They say the Syndicate provoked a
issue to get this guy killed.

159
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,458
And finally, it was Zulfiqar's turn.

160
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,167
Hmm.

161
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:55,083
After whom, the whole
face of the Syndicate changed.

162
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,667
Zulfiqar Ahmed.

163
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,000
Still remember.

164
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,667
He got kidnapped while
in the middle of the river.

165
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,292
You can understand how
complicated the scene was.

166
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:22,333
I sent Danish Bashar, who looks after
the truck parking, to Basheer.

167
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,250
And I went straight to
the Syndicate's meeting.

168
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,208
Basheer Khan?

169
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,625
Zulfiqar's friend and
partner in crime.

170
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,750
A gangster to some,
a brother to some.

171
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,375
And...

172
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:42,500
immensely sensitive regarding
his nation, India. A huge patriot!

173
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,333
Basheer bhai, come fast!

174
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,875
They've kidnapped Zulfiqar.
And Tony and Markaz too!

175
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,208
The river police and pirates of the
area where Zulfiqar was kidnapped...

176
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,792
were controlled by
Parvez Maqsood.

177
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:23,125
The other members of the
Syndicate were pressurising him.

178
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,917
Kashinath Kundu, goon turned promoter.

179
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,917
Used to rent out Port Trust land
as godowns and slums.

180
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,958
Kaushik Sinha, Customs officer.

181
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,792
Was so corrupt hardly bought
anything with his salary ever.

182
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,917
Sharafat Qasim, right hand man
of the local politician.

183
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,708
Ex-goon.

184
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,333
Shishir Tili, the owner
of Gunj's brothel.

185
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,208
The philosopher kind,
quipping proverbs.

186
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,417
Tribhuban Gupta, Port Trust officer.

187
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,250
A weak spine.

188
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:07,250
He was in the Syndicate to avoid
troubles, not only for the bribe.

189
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,042
Mithilesh Sikdar, supplied
coolies to stevedore companies,

190
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,333
to carry the goods from
the ships to warehouses.

191
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:19,125
Lastly, Pavel Latif, the boss of the
warehouses and container breakers.

192
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,875
I swear Basheer bhai!

193
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know what or
who's behind this!

194
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,625
What are you saying!

195
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,458
Nothing.

196
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:31,750
All we know is, we need your help
to get him out of that area.

197
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:36,125
Just tell me what to do and how.
Have I ever refused?

198
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,458
Then call your men up.

199
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,559
If anything happens to
Zulfiqar bhai...-

200
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,583
- Fine, cool it.

201
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,292
Not only men,
we need the money too.

202
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,875
50 lacs.

203
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,667
Who'll give that?

204
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,208
Kaushik's question's stumped all.

205
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:56,917
Because all the finacial dealings,
transactions and fund maintainance,

206
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,042
were handled by Tony Braganza.

207
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:04,542
Who, along with Zulfiqar's right hand man
Markaz Ali, was also kidnapped.

208
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:10,125
So, for the funds they had
to go to Rani Talapatra.

209
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:16,417
Rani Talapatra, the widow
of late Tamal Talapatra.

210
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,750
So, are you married?

211
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,125
Huh?

212
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,667
Ceremony, merrymaking,
feast, etc?

213
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,417
No.

214
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,083
Girlfriend?

215
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,458
Yes.

216
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:35,958
Careful. I've seen the
strongest fall for the trap.

217
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,333
The saying, "How the mighty have fallen!"

218
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,792
Remember that song by Kishore Kumar?

219
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,000
About the complicated
character of women?

220
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,167
- But her character is quite...

221
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,000
- Anyway, that's your
personal matter.

222
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:54,000
So I was talking
about Rani Talapatra.

223
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,500
She was an young widow,
needing nothing but security.

224
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,042
When her husband died,
amongst a lot of debt,

225
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,417
eveyone pounced on the bar.

226
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
Zulfiqar entered the scene.

227
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,417
Then the debtors just vanished.

228
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:13,000
And in return, Rani
became Zulfiqar's...

229
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,750
girlfriend.

230
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,583
Mistress, actually.

231
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,333
Tatin, Khemu..

232
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,500
Will she pay up?
Of course!

233
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,875
Ira, Madan, Chameli, you too.

234
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,792
But Ma'am, I was saying...

235
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,542
It seems no one trusts us in
Mrs. Talapatra's family. Great!

236
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,292
No, someone does.

237
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,500
He is in a fix at this moment.

238
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:54,250
But you guys don't seem to...-
- They've asked for 50 lacs.

239
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,208
The Syndicate doesn't have that much.

240
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,125
- And the police?

241
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,833
Not doing anything?

242
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,542
What will the police do?

243
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,625
But that comes later.
First we need the money.

244
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,250
Gunj is going
through a recession.

245
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,583
Very few visit the whorehouse.

246
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,333
I have to feed many mouths.

247
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,083
But still I've contributed
all that I could.

248
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,667
Now the family must come in.

249
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,042
So I am family now?

250
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,917
We can argue about that later.

251
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:34,625
The point is...-
- You know his family's condition, Ma'am.

252
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:40,333
His wife remains doped out,
can't wake her up.

253
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,833
You know how Zulfi squanders,
there's no money at home.

254
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,208
Not a penny.

255
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,875
Tony is not here too.
So we came to you.

256
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:51,167
Basheer bhaijaan, everything I
have is Zulfiqar's.

257
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,875
Wait, I'll get it.

258
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,250
Just one condition.

259
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,875
You've to be there
in the rescue team.

260
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,917
Why? The rest of
us are enemies?

261
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,125
Qasim!

262
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
Would've gone anyway.

263
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,125
Zulfi is in trouble. And I won't go?

264
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,750
Masood, this is
the place, right?

265
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,083
That's what Parvez bhai said.

266
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:34,375
'Jh' six, 'Jh' seven, 'Jh' eight, 'Jh'...

267
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,042
Greetings, Zulfi!

268
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,917
You've started counting, as usual!

269
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,000
What else? I was getting
so bored sitting here.

270
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,667
Hey, got the entire amount?

271
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,917
Did you expect instalments?-
- Shut up, give the money!

272
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,417
Release them first.

273
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
What don't worry!
What do you mean by that?

274
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,542
50 lacs is no small amount.
Lot of money man!

275
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,833
Shishir Tili gave 5 lacs. But
thankfully won't charge an interest.

276
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,958
Danish's donation for the Syndicate
fund is due since last month.

277
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,625
Rani has given 25 lacs
and if he tells Kashi...-

278
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,958
- Basheer, everything's ok but...-

279
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:09,458
- But what?

280
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,292
- No fun and frolic!

281
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,917
Hey! Hello people, wait.

282
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,458
Nothing of that nonsense is
happening. I'm telling you, huh!

283
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,667
The boat won't turn!
Are you mad?

284
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:25,042
- Correct! Why must the boat turn?

285
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,667
Men who have dignity, not boats.

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,542
So men must take care of it..

287
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,917
Zulfi bhai, shut up!
Sorry but please shut up eh?

288
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,125
Masood, ask him to
speed up the boat!

289
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,333
What say, Basheer?

290
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,292
- What 'Basheer?' For Christ's
sake guys. What rubbish!

291
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,500
I give up. Go to hell, you guys!

292
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,167
A favourite poet of mine.

293
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,625
If I may quote him,

294
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:59,292
There is a tide in the affairs of men, which
taken at the flood leads on to fortune.

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Ommitted, all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

296
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,904
Hey! Basheer bhai.. Zulfi Bhai...

297
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,667
- Goddamit man! Arrgh!
Hey, hold this!

298
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,417
Zulfi, watch out!

299
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,792
Where were you?

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,250
Come on!

301
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,042
Enough fun and frolic? Happy?

302
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,667
What the fish was that!

303
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,875
Can't you keep a watch?
Did you give her food?

304
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,667
Yes-
- Medicines on time?

305
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,875
Yes, did.

306
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,917
All of you lazy morons.

307
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:43,458
I was just gone for two days.

308
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,417
Begum...

309
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,208
Begum!

310
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,042
Begum.

311
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:14,250
Where were you all these days?

312
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Did you bring 'Sewai'
from the market?

313
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,500
Sewai.. from the market?

314
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,542
Come.

315
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,333
You think I can't
handle your worries.

316
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,458
What is this crisis?

317
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,083
That you can't share with me?

318
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:38,083
Recently got some mails..

319
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,708
Some spies gave me the news.

320
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:49,083
Some Lashkar terrorists are trying to
enter the country through here.

321
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,292
Some Syndicate members
are involved in this.

322
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:02,500
Have you informed Zulfi and Markaz?

323
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Kashinath?

324
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,667
Whom to trust and whom not to...

325
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,042
I am confused.

326
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,708
This isn't about gangwar,
police, politics or smuggling.

327
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,958
The country is in danger.

328
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,375
Basheer...

329
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:34,417
I need to tell you something
about the family.

330
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,167
Came to know of it.

331
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,250
Doing the rumor mills..

332
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,125
Was unaware of it all these years.

333
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:50,292
Danish told me.

334
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,375
Investigated about it.

335
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,125
It's true.

336
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,625
What is it?

337
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,000
Forget it.

338
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,292
Basheer...

339
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,667
you already have a
lot on your plate.

340
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,583
Moreover, I don't feel good
about telling you this.

341
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:19,000
Rather, I'll ask Danish...

342
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,750
to tell you when he can.

343
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,542
We all know...

344
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,458
how, by fighting all odds,

345
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,333
peeing on the face of Death,

346
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,750
how...

347
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,833
Zufliqar bhai has home
returned, fighting alone!

348
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,708
Our own boy has returned home.

349
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:43,708
Now there will be security
and peace in the area.

350
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,833
So we're honouring him with...

351
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,417
where are the flowers?

352
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,833
We are honouring him with flowers!

353
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:58,583
Hail Zulfiqar bhai!

354
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,625
Hail! Hail! Zulfiqar bhai!

355
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,625
Yo brother! You're coming or what?

356
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:17,167
Ah! Come on man!
Zulfi bhai will wait for us.

357
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,875
If you go to the ring
directly, what'll I do there alone?

358
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,208
Play bloody referee to
Zulfiqar bhai and Rani?

359
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,875
Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry my man, sorry.

360
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,750
My brother from another
mother, I'm really sorry.

361
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,750
You lovers have some
serious issues, man!

362
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,792
You'll sit home
singing sad songs all day.

363
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,958
Then you take it out by killing
people, breaking their jaws!

364
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,833
If it's bothering you go
tell Zulfiqar bhai,

365
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,292
"Zulfiqar bhai... your girlfriend...

366
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,667
What!

367
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,250
No!

368
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:02,625
No... thats not
happening man.

369
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,542
No, that is just not happening.

370
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,583
In the name of Jesus,
thats not happening.

371
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,917
You think I'm mad?

372
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,000
I'll go translate your
words to Zulfiqar bhai?

373
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,208
No way!

374
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,102
I want to live man, don't want to
get fucked in the wrong place.

375
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,167
No! Get off bugger..

376
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,458
Oh hello!

377
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,875
What do you take me for man,
bloody idiot or what?

378
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,208
Hey! Okay okay!
Fair enough, okay!-

379
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,250
- Where are you off to?

380
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,042
Zulfi bhai.. Oh bloody hell!
Hey, lets go out!

381
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,917
Come in!

382
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,042
Come on in, my champion!

383
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,417
Ready?

384
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,917
Rani says today's
odds are very high.

385
00:27:55,958 --> 00:28:00,542
The Syndicate and the bar
will bleed if you lose.

386
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,125
Are you sure or should
I send someone else?

387
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,375
What's this, Zulfi bhai?

388
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,708
You call me a 'Champion'
and doubt me as well?

389
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,458
Can still doubt myself
but never you, Markaz.

390
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,208
Remember it.

391
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,125
Shall we make a move?
People are waiting.

392
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,333
Yes, let's go.

393
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,458
Who'll you gamble on tonight?-
- Markaz bhai of course!

394
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,167
Markaz bhai will be beaten tonight!
You will see!

395
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,792
Have you seen his physique?

396
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,000
Markaz! Markaz! Markaz!

397
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,875
Kill him, man!

398
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:18,958
Fight, Markaz!

399
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,958
Yes!

400
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,458
Yay! My lion. My Champ!-
- Go get him, man!

401
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,208
Markaz! Markaz! Markaz!

402
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,417
Look out!

403
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,208
Punch him!

404
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,583
What the...

405
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,292
Shut up! You motherfucker!

406
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:10,167
What's the point of the Syndicate if
my brother has to rot in the lock-up?

407
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,207
Don't look at me.
It's the Syndicate's decision.

408
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,583
Oh come on!

409
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,458
How's it the Syndicate's
decision? No voting happened.

410
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,750
But Mr. Mithilesh, that's right,
we decided to stay out of drugs.

411
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,125
Mr. Kaushik, a small kid
made a mistake, that's it.

412
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,250
He just started a new business...-
- He's not a kid.

413
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:30,042
He can tell between weed,
hash, cocaine & heroin.

414
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:34,083
You must've leant the difference
at home too, right?

415
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,375
Hello! You watch it man.-
- Enough of this Pablo story.

416
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,333
Anything else?

417
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,125
Pablo is not a story, Basheer bhai,
he's my brother.

418
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,083
Okay, cool, we'll come to this later.

419
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,042
Parvez is waiting to tell us something.

420
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,125
Order please?

421
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,875
I have a proposal, guys.

422
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,250
No chance of a loss.

423
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:58,542
Rather, huge opportunity
to earn big bucks.

424
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:03,250
Shelter for 3 people
& false passports.

425
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,167
Who are they?
Where are they from?

426
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,583
They're from Afghanisthan.

427
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,750
How much will they pay?-
- 5.

428
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:12,167
What rubbish!
Not enough for so many of us.

429
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,042
The black gang operations
have dropped.

430
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,750
You find everything everywhere,
no extra income!

431
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,042
No ship-mauling since long!

432
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,958
I'm talking about 5 crores.-
- What!

433
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,917
Who are these people?

434
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,864
They are from the Lashkar gang.

435
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,458
They'll go to Mumbai.

436
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,208
Wow! What next?
Will auction your family?

437
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,917
Hold your tongue or I'll bury you...-
- Save your fight for later.

438
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:42,250
Know the risks of letting in terrorists?-
- Not terrorists.

439
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,750
They're Jihadis.

440
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,351
Sorry to burst your
balloon, Mr. Parvez,

441
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,167
but all this crusade
and religious war,

442
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,625
is complete bullshit
and nonsense.

443
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,500
All that matters to people
on the road is their daily food.

444
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,708
Which road are you
talking about, Tony?

445
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:57,125
India's or Hindustan's?

446
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,417
Heart's bleeding for Islam,
right Parvez?

447
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,000
Fine, let the Jihadis in.

448
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,667
Let blasts happen. But remember this,

449
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,292
forget a Musliam person,
even if a Muslim cat is killed..

450
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,333
I'll make sure you'll have
no use for virgins in heaven..

451
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:19,333
Send your hands back to school,
Parvez. They're too arrogant.

452
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
We don't need to do
all of this, right?

453
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,583
Let's hear what the
Syndicate decides?

454
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:34,582
That alright. But all this will invite
the media, the police & raids.

455
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,542
Don't think we need that.

456
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,042
If you ask me, I'm dead against it.

457
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,125
What say, bro?

458
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,708
Markaz too.

459
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:48,167
Crusades are bad for the business.
A riot breaks out and you're gone.

460
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,875
Hmm, Qasim?

461
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:55,500
There's good money but
the risk is quite high too.

462
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,417
Zulfiqar bhai?

463
00:34:58,708 --> 00:34:59,708
Hmm?

464
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:00,792
Hmm?

465
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,292
Whatever the Syndicate decides.

466
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,667
You're coming to the party, right?

467
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:25,833
Party's thrown by the nephew..

468
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,667
Uncle, I understand but
what's his fault?

469
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,125
Yes, I know.
Everything is your fault.

470
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,833
That's the reason why you
are punishing yourself. Right?

471
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,500
The fault is neither the
uncle's nor nephew's.

472
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,583
And my friend Romeo,
not yours too.

473
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,125
If it's someones fault, then..

474
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,333
Okay, okay yes! I know.

475
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,500
Come to the party.

476
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,875
I'll feel out of place.

477
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,542
Plus Akhtar invited us
so many times.

478
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,667
Markaz, you
should've been here man.

479
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,750
You've no idea about
the weather in Kolkata.

480
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,042
Hey! How are you?
Good to see you man.

481
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,042
HI! All well?-
- Yes.

482
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,375
Hey!-
- Hello, Tony!

483
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,250
How are you-
- Where is Markaz bhai?

484
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,792
Good to see you man, how are
you? Markaz will be here soon.

485
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:53,958
Hello!

486
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,083
- Hi, Tony!
- H.. Hi!

487
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,917
Oh my God! So good to see
you. How've you been?

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Good. I have been good.

489
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,042
Where is uncle? Won't he
come? And Markaz?

490
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,500
Yes, Zulfi bhai is a little busy.
Coming in a bit.

491
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,500
And you know Markaz.
He will come later.

492
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,792
My brother told me you'll be coming late.

493
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:16,333
Aa.. it's kinda late I guess, right?-
- No!

494
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,417
You should know you're not
in Paris anymore, studying.

495
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,417
Someone hasn't changed.
This is not late, Tony!

496
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:26,208
Come, my brother as
usual is rocking the party.

497
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,792
Oh really? You look great.-
- Thank you!

498
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:54,292
Our houses break apart

499
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,792
Our swords get rusty

500
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,667
A little water to quench our thirst

501
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,500
It drenches our clothes
How far do we go on?

502
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:09,542
Our houses break apart

503
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:13,042
Our swords get rusty

504
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,917
A little water to quench our thirst

505
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:20,750
It drenches our clothes
How far do we go on?

506
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,583
As far as we can call out to

507
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:28,375
The sailor prances on
waves further away

508
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:35,208
We lose our way
We lose our way back home

509
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:39,500
Our smiles blossom
In someone's garden

510
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:43,250
Why the waters cries out
In the middle of the night

511
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:49,417
We lose our way
Why can't we go back home?

512
00:38:55,792 --> 00:39:00,292
Who's home remains unscathed?

513
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,542
Take me to their place

514
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:15,417
Mismatched faces and bodies

515
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:20,167
Take me home

516
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:33,542
I know Tony's not home.
He doesn't like me.

517
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,292
Please Markaz, why
don't you understand?

518
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,000
I was sunk in debt.

519
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:46,167
Debtors were like vultures.
If Zulfiqar sahab were not there...

520
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,792
Your wound...

521
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,833
More I float away Towards poetry

522
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:05,875
More I feel the monotony of life

523
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,583
My love for you is clandestine

524
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,792
I must return everytime
I kiss your cheeks

525
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:16,583
The more I escape the crowd

526
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,708
The more I fail
To respond to your calls

527
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:24,500
A strange slumber fumes my eyes

528
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:28,458
I stay awake

529
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,375
Why do I sit like
An open window?

530
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,875
The clock keeps ticking,
Mimicking several voices

531
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,500
I'll never know how many
boxes I'm spilt into

532
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:42,500
There's someone I call

533
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:52,625
Who's home is unscathed?

534
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,583
Take me to their place

535
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,000
Come on!-
- What happened?

536
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,208
- Tell me what happened?-
- You don't talk much.

537
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,833
Don't you dare touch me!

538
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,542
Guys, please!

539
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,750
Get the local support and
the Syndicate, that's it.

540
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:12,375
Syndicate will help you
in all possible ways.

541
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,042
Run!

542
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,833
Escape from the back!

543
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:20,583
Hey! Guys, what is wrong
with you! Hello!

544
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,625
Sit down guys, please everybody!

545
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,583
Come on, leave him!

546
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,625
Back off you jerk!

547
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,958
- Get out!
- What's your problem, man?

548
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,167
- Hey! You bugger!
- Tony relax!

549
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:37,958
You jerk! Now I'll show you...-
- Please stop fighting!

550
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,625
Sorry, it was a mistake.

551
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,417
What sorry man! This
isn't your uncle's area.

552
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,167
Trying to impress girls eh?

553
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:48,292
Tony, no bloodshed please!
Forget what happenend!

554
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,750
Guys, please...-

555
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,458
Guys,

556
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:58,708
aim your machines at him.

557
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,000
And aim well.

558
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,667
If you miss, he will push
this broken bottle...

559
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,583
through your arse.
And mind you it'll hurt a lot!

560
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:15,875
Masood, upstairs!

561
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:23,875
Move forward.

562
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,833
Zulfi!

563
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:50,917
Run, come this way!

564
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,583
So, friends...

565
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,667
not only for the
people of this area,

566
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:27,750
for the entire nation,

567
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,625
for the entire world,

568
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:33,750
what Zulfiqar bhai has
done is marvellous!

569
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:39,708
Today, the National Press
is looking up to Bengal.

570
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,958
They're looking up to us!

571
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:45,833
How, a man can singlehandedly..

572
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,542
Finished those terrorists, who
were the enemies of both..

573
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:52,875
This country and the world!

574
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,750
He alone is the police force!

575
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,750
He is one-man army!

576
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,667
He is our very beloved,
our very own..

577
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,625
Zulfiqar Ahmed!

578
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:12,083
Long live Zulfiqar!-
- Long live Zulfiqar!

579
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:18,333
Long live Zulfiqar!-
- Long live Zulfiqar!

580
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:28,292
Long live Zulfiqar!-
- Long live Zulfiqar!

581
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,458
What happened, Basheer bhai?

582
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,458
Sitting here alone?

583
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:57,542
Didn't you go?

584
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:04,000
No space for you on the stage?

585
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,500
Just come to the point!

586
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,167
You've been trying to say
something for days.

587
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:16,333
The stage will have room for
only one, Basheer bhai.

588
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,250
So it's time to bring
the stage down.

589
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,208
Huh?

590
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,375
You already know the
rules of this jungle.

591
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:29,125
We are wild dogs.
We hunt together.

592
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:32,917
But if someone gets bigger than the
pack, he needs to go, right?

593
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,958
What nonsense!-
- Nothing new, Basheer bhai.

594
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,458
Your own words.

595
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,917
Whoever breaks the rule
of business is a traitor.

596
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:48,750
Father, son, brother,
friend, whoever be it.

597
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:54,292
True but Zulfi never went
against the Syndicate, Kashinath.

598
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,042
Zulfiqar didn't have this power ever!

599
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,542
Every kid knows his name!

600
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:08,208
Political parties want him,
businessmen line up for him!

601
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:10,792
People from my area
worship him, fear him!

602
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,000
Control, Basheer bhai, control... power!

603
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,917
It can corrupt anyone.

604
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:32,875
Before the Syndicate he was
ruling this area with Parvez.

605
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:37,375
His hands didn't faulter even
once when killing him!

606
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,292
You think he will spare the Syndicate
and not hog the power alone!

607
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,958
- But Zulfi...-
- What?

608
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:46,875
What about Zulfi?

609
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:55,458
Haven't you risked your life
to save him, so many times!

610
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,875
I have seen that!

611
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:02,292
That's you. Would he be able to
kill Parvez without me?

612
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,542
He'd be dead by now.

613
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,583
An ordinary man suddenly
becomes God doing nothing

614
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,208
And we are to
twiddle our thumbs?

615
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,750
Hence,

616
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,542
our party has decided,

617
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:26,917
to offer the election ticket
to Zulfiqar sahib!

618
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:30,250
Long live Zulfiqar!-
- Long live Zulfiqar!

619
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,625
Long live Zulfiqar!-
- Long live Zulfiqar!

620
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,125
Zulfiqar bhai...-

621
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:47,542
- It's an honour to get an opportunity
like this to serve my people.

622
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:51,875
But... I?
Will I be able to?-

623
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:57,292
- Zulfiqar bhai, you probably
missed their applause. I didn't.

624
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,708
Please don't refuse.

625
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,958
But...

626
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,000
I know nothing about politics,

627
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:05,250
I can't do this, Sir.

628
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:12,083
Politics is serving people.

629
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:16,000
Your people want to see
you on the throne.

630
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,083
Please!

631
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:21,208
We can warn him.
We can make him understand.

632
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,625
We can make him aware!

633
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,542
Why are you laughing? What?
Did I say anything funny?

634
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,125
What should we say? "Zulfi,
enough now, give up your wings?"

635
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,458
Did I say that?

636
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,500
We'll say, "Leave for Haj,
we will handle your business?"

637
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,083
My brain is not working, Kashinath!

638
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:46,542
I understand that, if the Syndicate
has to work, Zulfi has to back off.

639
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,542
We'll talk to him!

640
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,083
But you know he is a
crazy, stubborn guy!

641
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:58,292
I don't know if he will
listen to us, but...

642
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,833
we can sure make him
understand things.

643
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,750
We'll definitely try.

644
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:06,917
What is going on, isn't correct.
We have to talk to him.

645
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,417
We will.

646
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,125
This doesn't concern the
Syndicate alone, Basheer.

647
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:27,208
Fake passports of the terrorists,
incoming & outgoing mails...

648
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,708
bank statements...

649
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,958
plan... blue prints..

650
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:45,875
Pravez was not alone, Basheer.
There was a mastermind.

651
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,167
What do you mean?

652
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:53,625
He spoke very little in that meeting.

653
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:56,875
Thought the decision
would be in his favour.

654
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,042
I mean Zulfiqar.

655
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,708
Mr. Basheer,

656
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,875
Zulfiqar Ahmed.

657
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:25,333
Goodbye, Zulfi...

658
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,583
See you in hell.

659
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,333
That was a close save man!
That bugger almost convinced you.

660
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:42,625
Only Zulfiqar can convince Zulfiqar.
Get it, brother?

661
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:47,333
There's an important meeting at the...-
- Hey, you doing okay?

662
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,333
- Police station,
you've to be there.

663
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,875
What meeting?-
- Durga Puja immersion and Eid.

664
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:56,792
Are on the same day. We've
to see it happens peacefully.

665
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,250
Greetings, Zufi bhai.
This is my daughter.

666
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,792
May God bless you.

667
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,167
A ruckus?-
- Yes.

668
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:14,125
Zulfi bhai, Markaz is asking if
you're coming to the race tonight.

669
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:20,042
Definitely. You guys have
arranged it for me after a long time.

670
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,958
Thank you! Thank you!-
- Beware of this Eid.

671
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,417
Did you say something to me, Sir?

672
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:31,208
Beware of Eid, Zulfiqar.

673
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,125
Beware of Eid.

674
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,542
- What's up boys!
- Greetings!

675
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:48,125
So Kashinath didn't come?

676
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,542
I knew it!
He has no interest in sports.

677
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:56,125
He has a different game going on
behind that frown.

678
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,500
I don't trust such
people, Markaz!

679
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,833
Always hungry.

680
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,083
It's been a long time,
why not tonight?

681
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,958
No way, buddy,
this is child's play.

682
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:13,833
Besides, all competition is in vain if
Zulfiqar participates.

683
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:15,708
Let's see.

684
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,000
Let's see.-
- Really?

685
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,667
Let's see if it goes in vain or not.

686
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,625
Get off kid, come on.

687
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,375
Yeah!

688
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,792
There's more like it! All right
guys, let's get ready here!

689
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,958
Let's kick some serious
ass here, guys! All right!

690
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,583
On your mark!
Get! set! Go guys!

691
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
They say, better safe than sorry.

692
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,542
I suggest, let's banish instead of killing.

693
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:50,583
Shishir! Want to
get shot like Parvez?

694
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:55,292
If we don't kill him, all of us from the
Syndicate have to die. Mark my words.

695
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,375
After all, Basheer bhai is with us.-
- Yes!

696
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,833
And you know him very well.

697
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,792
But what about Laltoo, the police?

698
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:08,125
The local councilor's right-hand
is with you. Why worry about police?

699
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,667
Coward!

700
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:13,083
Fine, fine, but we
won't get into trouble, right?

701
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,083
Laltoo will gang up with
us; the majority.

702
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:19,500
Cop by profession,
opportunist by nature.

703
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,667
Just worrying about
Markaz and Tony.

704
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:45,125
I was saying...

705
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,250
what if Basheer bhai
comes to know...

706
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,042
that we hacked Zulfiqar's
account to send those mails?

707
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:56,917
And that we forged
those photos and passports?

708
00:54:57,542 --> 00:55:00,667
What? Why you laughing?

709
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:10,417
What else? Basheer and Zulfiqar
will make Galoti Kebabs out of us.

710
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,917
We had to take the risk, Tribhuban.

711
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:22,917
Basheer neither has ambition
nor hunger for power.

712
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:26,958
If we didn't play the 'nation' card...

713
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,458
would he have ever agreed?

714
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,167
Anyway, let's revise the plan.

715
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,917
Tribhuban, -
- Hmm?

716
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,042
- You are to handle
Markaz and Tony.

717
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,375
Okay.

718
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,458
Danish, you are to pick
Zulfiqar up on time.

719
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,250
Mithilesh...-
- Yes?

720
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:47,000
Remember the sequence.-
- Okay.

721
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,875
Qasim...

722
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,792
One more thing.

723
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:56,417
After the job is done,

724
00:55:56,583 --> 00:56:00,750
we will let Basheer lead.
He will decide everything.

725
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:08,750
Basheer is the second most
popular person after Zulfiqar.

726
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:12,958
We've to convince people by all means.

727
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,125
Convince that all this is good for them.

728
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:21,083
You all know what an angry mob
do to a pick-pocket, right?

729
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:25,542
And we are going to kill
Zulfiqar Ahmed!

730
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,208
What a race Basheer!
Such a tough game!

731
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,625
That too with Zulfiqar!

732
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:45,625
Nowadays, you call yourself Zulfiqar
so often..

733
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,625
I forget I used to call you Zulfi.

734
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,792
People change, Basheer.

735
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,000
Times, too.

736
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,333
I know.

737
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,875
Who knows that better than me!

738
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,417
Zulfi!

739
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,667
Zulfi!

740
00:59:30,042 --> 00:59:31,583
Zulfi!

741
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:34,250
Zulfi!

742
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:40,042
It's ok! Nothing happened.

743
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,750
That was just a dream.

744
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,417
Just a dream.

745
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,208
Happy Eid, Begum.

746
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,958
Please don't go, I'm scared!

747
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,708
Stay back today.

748
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:12,833
Can't, have an important meeting-
- Stay.

749
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,667
Don't go please.

750
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,417
What happened? What did you dream of?

751
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,042
I saw you.

752
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,125
Your death.

753
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:34,458
Once heard some lines from Basheer...

754
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,667
Cowards die many times
before their deaths...

755
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:43,458
The valiant never taste
of death but once...

756
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:50,083
Sheikh Peer says,
strange is our nature...

757
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,917
Death is inevitable

758
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,208
But we still fear it

759
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,458
Yes, Danish.-
- Happy Eid, Zulfiqar bhai.

760
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,958
Happy Eid.

761
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,583
It's a festive day, let me accompany you.

762
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,125
I'm waiting downstairs.

763
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,667
Go ahead, I'm coming.
Karishma is little...-

764
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:20,292
- Ok! Don't worry. I'll
tell them about her attack.

765
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,708
You'll be late.-
- No, don't say all that.

766
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,417
Ok, I'll just tell them
that you'll be late.

767
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,833
Even if someone asks about her
attack, I'll keep mum.

768
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:36,292
Danish, stop it, she's fine.
Just wait, I'm coming.

769
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:41,625
Listen, the problem's stretching long.
I'm being pressurized.

770
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:45,917
They know, I'm a Syndicate member.
Please resolve this now.

771
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:50,042
Disgusting, they drink whole day
and create problems.

772
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,958
They threatened me
and Mithilesh that day.

773
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:58,375
One punch from Markaz will sort them.

774
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:02,083
He's saying it's Eid,
won't beat them much.

775
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,333
Only break the bloody
bugger's hand and let him go.

776
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,417
Hope we won't be
late for the meeting.

777
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,625
No, we have time to finish this.

778
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:10,667
Okay, fine.

779
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,833
On this festive day,
I appeal to everyone...

780
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:16,917
to give a thought about
my brother's case.

781
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,542
He's locked-up since long.

782
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:23,292
Be it Eid or Christmas,
a drug dealer can't be spared.

783
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,583
Zulfiqar bhai, he has been
punished enough!

784
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:29,458
Okay, lets hear out
the other members.

785
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,916
The verdict is passed.

786
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:35,250
Don't drag this. Smuggling
drugs won't be tolerated.

787
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:41,417
Zulfiqar, I too think we
should consider Mithilesh's...-

788
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:46,667
I'm done with the talking, Basheer.
The issue's such.

789
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:52,958
And yes, Mithilesh, you wanted
the Syndicate's decision, right?

790
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:57,458
For now, assume I'm the Syndicate.

791
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:46,333
Goodbye, Zulfi.

792
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,917
Hail India.

793
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,750
You too!

794
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:01,292
No more corpses today.

795
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:03,542
Especially, not a cop.

796
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,750
Killing a cop is troublesome.

797
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:31,333
Racked up inside us
Are all wounds of time

798
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:38,167
The scarlet colour of this morning
Scars everyone

799
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:46,458
God himself shatters our homes

800
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:54,583
The blank gaze keeps
staring at an ashen past

801
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:02,417
A grave disease in these tough times
An unknown dark fear

802
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:10,667
A grave disease in these tough times
An unknown dark fear

803
01:07:13,542 --> 01:07:19,250
Racked up inside us
Are all wounds of time

804
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:27,000
The watchful eyes
Sneak away, behind the window

805
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:34,625
You have awakened the
One sleeping within me

806
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,167
One cannot but sleep away the pain

807
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:45,667
So I stay awake
Hoping to meet you at the horizon

808
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:57,458
Racked up inside us
Are all wounds of time

809
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:04,417
The scarlet colour of this morning
Scars everyone

810
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:12,625
God himself shatters our homes

811
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:21,042
The blank gaze keeps
staring at an ashen past

812
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:29,125
A grave disease in these tough times
An unknown dark fear

813
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:37,125
A grave disease in these tough times
An unknown dark fear

814
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:44,708
A grave disease in these tough times
An unknown dark fear

815
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,917
So, it's not safe to stay here.

816
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,000
We've no idea who's up to what.

817
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:55,417
But where do we go?
A place safer than this bar...-

818
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,583
- There's one place.

819
01:08:57,792 --> 01:08:58,958
Our farmhouse.

820
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:07,208
Yes, I know! Going out
without protection is impossible.

821
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:13,125
I was younger...

822
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,458
Just had joined the Force.

823
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:22,625
This Syndicate had not
been formed yet.

824
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:27,083
They could've killed me anytime..

825
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:31,167
If it was not for Zulfiqar Bhai.

826
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,625
Don't worry about protection.

827
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,333
Tomorrow morning, 6 am.

828
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:51,583
Isn't there a solution
without hitches?

829
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:55,917
Killing someone in broad daylight is...-

830
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,708
- So what? It'll all be
over in three days..

831
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,625
Four phone calls will dig
the grave for the files.

832
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:08,000
We've other cards,
if not Laltoo.

833
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,458
But that Markaz...-
- And Tony?

834
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:15,375
Kill Markaz and Tony
will die of pain.

835
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,875
And Akhtar? Akhtar too is...-

836
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,375
Who? Which Akhtar?
That singer?

837
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,958
Yes.

838
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,375
Strums his guitar and woos women.

839
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,332
I too, am bothered about Markaz.

840
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,917
Can find out the location
in 10 minutes, Basheer.

841
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,417
Let's surprise them
with Masood & Tintin.

842
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,000
Kill the young snakes.

843
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,167
Or else we'll suffer later.

844
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:47,125
Harishpukur, Manasha Mandir,
Diamond Harbour Road,

845
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:52,000
Four Star market,

846
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:55,417
All areas are tense.
Any moment the public can go...

847
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,042
boom!

848
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,208
Riots are likely.

849
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,917
We shouldn't do anything that can
antagonise the people, right?

850
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:08,708
Deal with that family first.
Think about the mob later.

851
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,167
People are still confused.

852
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,208
They've no idea what happened.

853
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:18,583
How was he
murdered.. why..

854
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,083
This is the right time to
do the mass brainwash.

855
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,333
Don't forget one thing...

856
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,542
Zulfiqar has a vast popularity.

857
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:35,250
If Markaz can...-
- That's what, Kashinath!

858
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:42,292
If we finish the entire family, the public
will take it as our personal enemity.

859
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,917
They'll think we were envious.
But we need to explain.

860
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,250
We did it for our country!

861
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:52,792
We'd to kill Zulfiqar Ahmed
for the sake of India.

862
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,833
His family has to be
there for the last rites.

863
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Stop him!

864
01:11:57,042 --> 01:12:00,500
Someone stop him!
It's a long journey!

865
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:05,250
He won't come back.
He's going into the sea.

866
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:08,042
I'm here.
Nothing will happen.

867
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:11,667
Nothing will happen.-
- You have no idea!

868
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,750
My husband has
another woman now.

869
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,500
I saw her!
I just saw her!

870
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:24,125
Creepers all over her body.
Squirrels playing on her skin!

871
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:29,167
No. Nothing to worry.-
- You know that witch, right?

872
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:31,958
Yes, somewhat.

873
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,458
Go to sleep now.

874
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:48,167
That witch won't
bother you anymore.

875
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:53,500
Just knew this would happen!
Shouldn't have listened to them!

876
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,500
Should've been with
Uncle all the time.

877
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,042
This is why he kept us away.

878
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,833
Never let us come and stay here!

879
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:05,583
He knew it all the way.
He knew it.

880
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:06,667
He knew it.

881
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,083
But he kept saying, "The Syndicate is
there, nothing will happen to me."

882
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,917
Yes, we can see that!
Bloody bunch of snakes!

883
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:16,250
Calling them a snake is
an insult to the snake!

884
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,292
Bloody "Syndicate"!

885
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:22,125
Hang on, brother. We were all
members of the same Syndicate, right?

886
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:25,333
We've risked our lives
everyday for your uncle!

887
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,042
Hate the sin, Akhtar.
Not the Syndicate.

888
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:32,333
Tony bhai is right.
This is Kashinath's doing.

889
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,125
He wanted to control this area.

890
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:37,042
Yes, he'll control the morgue.

891
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,292
It's Basheer.

892
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,208
- Hello!
- Hello, Laltoo...-

893
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:46,958
- Yes, hello...
- Let me come straight to the point.

894
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,333
I know all of you are together.

895
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:54,917
You, Karishma, Rani,
Tony, Markaz & Akhtar too.

896
01:13:55,125 --> 01:14:00,583
I'm asking you all to come back.

897
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,667
Come back home.

898
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:04,792
The Syndicate has no
problem with you.

899
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:07,000
None will harm you.

900
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:10,958
Mr. Basheer, Tony here.-
- Yes, Tony.

901
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:13,917
'The Syndicate' won't
harm us, as in?

902
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:17,708
You speak as if, Markaz,
myself, Laltoo, Pavel...

903
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,625
We're no Syndicate members...

904
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:22,708
As if Syndicate is your
ancestral property, Goddam it!

905
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:27,083
That's what I'm saying, you
all have your place here.

906
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,333
Why are you staying away?

907
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,458
Whatever happened had
nothing to do with you!

908
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:36,208
Zulfiqar was closing the Syndicate
down. He was betraying the nation.

909
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:38,125
That's why this happened to him.

910
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:39,917
Hello?

911
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,167
Hang on, Basheer.
Markaz is saying something.

912
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:52,917
Basheer, Markaz says, he believes and
he understands...

913
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:56,708
that you don't have any
personal interest in this matter.

914
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:01,708
You & Zulfiqar were family...-
- What are you saying!

915
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:04,625
But my question is
about the rest, as in...-

916
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,958
No one will touch you,
Basheer Khan promises!

917
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:11,375
Please come. You don't
have to trust me.

918
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:15,875
Come with the full Police Force.
But come.

919
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:19,708
It's his funeral.
Won't be complete without you.

920
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:21,542
Basheer uncle, Akhtar here.

921
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,125
Just a quick query.

922
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:27,375
You really think you can wash
his blood off your hands...

923
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:30,625
by organizing the funeral?

924
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,750
Akhtar!

925
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,208
Akhtar, enough.

926
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,292
Enough.

927
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,917
Your anger is natural.

928
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:44,250
When I pointed my gun at
him, my hand went numb too.

929
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:49,792
But tomorrow, I'll
pray for my friend, Zulfi.

930
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,708
Not any terrorist
called Zulfiqar Ahmed!

931
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:59,833
Everyone must come. You
don't have trust me. Get security...-

932
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:02,042
- We'll be there. Let us
know the time.

933
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,208
- Thanks!
- Tony Bhai!

934
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:08,458
- Shh.. Don't get excited
guys. Calm down guys!

935
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,429
Calm down. Nothing
has happened. Sit down.

936
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,583
Pavel, sit down!-
- Let's hear Tony out...

937
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,000
What's going on here!

938
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:21,333
What's wrong with the people here?
Can't we just keep calm?

939
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:23,708
You know what Akhtar,

940
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:26,458
the man, Zulfiqar meant as
much to me as to you.

941
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,416
Will you shake hands
with those murderers?

942
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,750
Oh nephew! Even boxers shake
hands before the match.

943
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:38,250
But in the end, only
one hand is held up.

944
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:26,667
There's a lot of
rumors in the air.

945
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:31,333
So, it's important
to speak to you.

946
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:34,958
Your Zulfiqar, my Zulfi,

947
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,750
wasn't killed in a gang war.

948
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:42,917
Neither was he killed
in a police encounter.

949
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,625
The Syndicate that
looks after this area,

950
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:54,792
employs the youth in
4 Star & Nancy markets

951
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:57,833
saving them from
the path of crime,

952
01:17:57,917 --> 01:18:03,250
the Syndicate that looked
after all these clubs, charity,

953
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,958
the same Syndicate,

954
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:10,625
the same Syndicate
punished Zulfiqar. Why?

955
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:17,667
Because he tried to destroy the
Syndicate and take over everything,

956
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:23,500
he tried to spread terror in the
Nation with the terrorists.

957
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:26,208
You tell me? Aren't rules
the same for everyone?

958
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:32,125
The deeds that may kill us..

959
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,917
He would survive,
just because he is Zulfiqar?

960
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,958
Would the rules be
different for him?

961
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,625
Death for traitors!

962
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,667
Basheer Khan, long live!-
- Basheer Khan, long live!

963
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,500
Death for traitors!

964
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,083
Death for traitors!

965
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,625
Zulfiqar was a great man!

966
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:56,125
He did phenomenal things.

967
01:18:56,208 --> 01:19:01,750
But was also a big threat to
the Syndicate, this area, this nation!

968
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:09,833
And his family is aware of all
this. See, they're present here.

969
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,167
But today, we have not...

970
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,417
gathered here for a terrorist.

971
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:21,875
We all are here for that Zulfi,

972
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:26,292
who was a brother,
an uncle, a husband,

973
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:31,042
a friend.

974
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:35,042
He was a very close friend.

975
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:38,708
May God...

976
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:43,667
His family and friends are
here to say something.

977
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:50,583
Before leaving I'm sharing some
lines of Sheikh Peer.

978
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:55,292
If someone is present here
Who would die for him

979
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,458
If someone is present here
Who would die for him

980
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:04,083
Then I must say, he was
No less a friend of mine

981
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:05,875
If the question arises...

982
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,500
If the question arises,
Why I went against him

983
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:14,167
If the question arises,
Why I went against him

984
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,417
The answer would be

985
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,541
I've loved my nation more

986
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:23,625
Basheer Khan, long live!
Basheer Khan, long live!

987
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:27,500
Syndicate, long live!
Basheer Khan, long live!

988
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:33,042
Basheer Khan, long live!
Basheer Khan, long live!

989
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,042
Go.

990
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:17,458
Calm down!

991
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,542
Calm down!

992
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:25,042
Hello and greetings to
everyone present here.

993
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:30,583
Like Basheer bhai said, we have come
here today, for Zulfiqar bhai.

994
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,875
But not to speak about
his memories,

995
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:36,208
No memories & all that jazz!

996
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:40,333
We've come for the last
prayer, for his funeral.

997
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:44,958
Basheer bhai who's never wrong,

998
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:48,708
said that we are allowed
to speak here.

999
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,885
Thank you Basheer bhai, thank
you very much!

1000
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:51,917
Thank you!

1001
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,542
Zulfiqar Ahmed...

1002
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,625
was an elder brother to us.

1003
01:21:58,167 --> 01:21:59,875
Day after day,

1004
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,167
he took bullets for us!

1005
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,958
Risking his own life for us.

1006
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:10,792
What he did for the
developement of this area...

1007
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:14,333
no one could do that
in last fifty years man!

1008
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:16,333
But, but.. but..

1009
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:17,833
Yes...

1010
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,458
correct. We got to know
new things about him today..

1011
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:25,208
That Zulfi bhai wanted to
take over the entire Syndicate

1012
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:27,458
That's what Basheer bhai
told us, yes!

1013
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:32,167
And friends, as you know,
Basheer bhai is never wrong.

1014
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:33,667
Isn't it?

1015
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:36,167
Friends,

1016
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:39,458
when Syndicate's fund dropped,

1017
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:44,333
Zulfi bhai used to donateto the poor.

1018
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,625
From medicines to liquor,
from blankets to weddings,

1019
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,083
anything & everything.

1020
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,833
He used to donate blood in
every blood donation camp.

1021
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:56,917
He used to take care of every
family personally.

1022
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,083
Do you know friends,

1023
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:05,208
Zulfiqar Ahmed donated half
his property to an NGO?

1024
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:09,208
Which works for the
developement of the slum dwellers...

1025
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:14,292
and sex workers'
children in this area.

1026
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:19,458
Today, we have come to know
that Zulfiqar Ahmed is dead.

1027
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:21,417
Oh! no no..
Sorry, sorry!

1028
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:29,000
Zulfiqar Ahmed has
been murdered.

1029
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,208
By his friends.

1030
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,875
Why? Ask why... Why?

1031
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:35,583
Why?

1032
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:39,583
Because, as Basheer bhai told us,

1033
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:42,417
Zulfiqar Ahmed
was a selfish man!

1034
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:46,667
And friends as you know,
Basheer bhai is never wrong!

1035
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,875
The tide is turing,
Basheer. Stop him.

1036
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:02,000
Too late. People will erupt
if we try to stop him now.

1037
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:05,208
Kill him right here.-
- Have you gone crazy, huh?

1038
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,875
Just disperse silently.

1039
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:10,792
You know friends,
Zulfiqar Ahmed was...

1040
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,375
the natural leader
of the Syndicate.

1041
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,083
Yes.

1042
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:17,542
By his bravery & skills.
Yes, he was a leader.

1043
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,833
But he never imposed
decisions in meetings.

1044
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:24,208
Always went with the
collective decision.

1045
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:25,375
Probably you remember...

1046
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:29,791
right at this spot, just
a few days back,

1047
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:32,417
he rejected the proposal
of that MLA...

1048
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,333
to run for elections, remember?

1049
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:35,917
Not once.

1050
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:37,417
Thrice.

1051
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Three times!

1052
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:39,875
Thrice!

1053
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:43,917
But Basheer bhai said
he was hungry for power!

1054
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:49,125
And you know, obviously, Basheer
bhai is never wrong.

1055
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:52,375
The hands that learnt to
hold the pistol from him,

1056
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:54,667
went up against him that day.

1057
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:58,167
The brave back that
protected everybody,

1058
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,875
that same back was stabbed
by all those people!

1059
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:04,500
And Basheer bhai
who's never wrong,

1060
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,042
says that, Zulfiqar was the
traitor & not the others.

1061
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:10,042
Parvez wanted
shelter for the 3 terrorists.

1062
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:10,958
Then what happened?

1063
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,143
The terrorists entered
without the Syndicate's permission!

1064
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:15,500
Zulfiqar went there,
found them out & killed them.

1065
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:19,000
But Basheer bhai says that Zulfiqar
was a terrorist, an anti-national,

1066
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:21,000
A traitor, a conspirer!

1067
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,042
And Basheer bhai is never wrong!

1068
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,417
You are right Tony bhai!

1069
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,250
We are not good orators
like Basheer bhai.

1070
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:40,958
If we were,
you wouldn't wait here.

1071
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,583
You would be rioting!

1072
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:45,542
The people who
murdererd Zulfiqar Ahmed,

1073
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,667
those who murdererd his trust,

1074
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:50,833
You would've killed
them! Avenged him!

1075
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:53,000
But no, wait!

1076
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:56,042
This would happen if
Basheer bhai had said all these!

1077
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:57,375
Not us.

1078
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:02,250
Because Basheer bhai is never wrong!

1079
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,000
Party time!

1080
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,500
Find the scumbag!

1081
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:05,833
Kill him!

1082
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:14,292
Danish!

1083
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:17,750
Let's go from here! Let's go!

1084
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:24,042
Yes, coming. Wait!

1085
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:31,208
Leave me please! I don't live here!-
- Hey! Get up!

1086
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:33,833
Believe me, I did nothing.

1087
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,292
Crying now eh?

1088
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:39,833
Didn't think twice before peppering
Zulfqar with bullets!

1089
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:41,583
He is my twin, I did nothing!-
- What!

1090
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,500
Twins eh?

1091
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:46,958
Kaushik never said he
had a twin!

1092
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:50,750
He was scared...-
- Your Dad has a photocopy machine?

1093
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:54,125
Kill that bastard!
Shoot him!

1094
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:08,750
You stay here.
Don't go anywhere.

1095
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:34,583
Hey! Where are you
going, you buffoon!

1096
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,583
Hey! Get him!

1097
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:47,875
Stop! You bastard!

1098
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,583
You wanted some
help, right brother?

1099
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:02,082
Hadn't you called us for help?

1100
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,875
Let's help you now!-
- They tricked me!

1101
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:07,667
- Now we can help you, come!
- Tony bhai, I've kids!

1102
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:11,083
Woo! Markaz bhai! Mr. Gupta is getting
all sentimental, this bugger!

1103
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:12,167
There you go!

1104
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:14,792
Please! Markaz bhai, Please!

1105
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:39,083
Come on, go that side.
And don't make noise!

1106
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:43,667
Do not miss, search every
goddamn room here!

1107
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Go that side.

1108
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:59,083
Hey! No, no, don't...

1109
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:18,583
Bhai, they are not over there!

1110
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,708
Arreh! Bhai, bhai, don't!

1111
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,833
Hey, what's all this!

1112
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:48,625
Bhai! Spare me bhai,
I didn't do anything!

1113
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:56,208
Hey! Markaz, please-
- Mr. Shishir Tili, change of business?

1114
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,292
I tried to stop them,
believe me!

1115
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:01,208
Ask Laltoo if you
don't believe me!

1116
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:03,833
Bhai, leave me!

1117
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:07,375
Becoming a whore wasn't
such a good idea, was it?

1118
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,250
Nothing to watch here, carry
on with what you're doing.

1119
01:31:13,292 --> 01:31:14,292
Move!

1120
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:23,625
Tony bhai! Markaz bhai, please!

1121
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,542
Wait my brother, let's
talk here, right?

1122
01:31:26,667 --> 01:31:28,875
Let's enjoy a little,
have a chat.

1123
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:30,583
I wasn't with them!

1124
01:31:30,792 --> 01:31:33,000
What's the hurry?
You're always in a rush, man!

1125
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:34,167
What's the problem!

1126
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:38,375
No, no... question doesn't
arise. This is my prey, my kill.

1127
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:40,708
My prey, my kill, I told you, right?

1128
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:42,083
My prey...

1129
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,333
- Yes! Laltoo, tell me.

1130
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:13,333
Leave it man,
how long will they hide!

1131
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,000
All the rats have to come
out of their holes someday!

1132
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,708
Who's there?-
- Kashinath!

1133
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:33,083
Any news of Kaushik?- - No, absconding
since his brother was killed.

1134
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:35,667
And Shishir and
Tribhuban's families?

1135
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:38,083
Yes, I have shifted them.

1136
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:41,583
Basheer, your wife?

1137
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,125
Basheer...-

1138
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:50,000
She's killed herself.

1139
01:32:57,625 --> 01:33:02,000
I spoke to quite a few people.
Can't be on a run anymore.

1140
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:06,333
Can change line of business...

1141
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:08,625
But respect?

1142
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,875
Peace of mind?

1143
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,225
It would be great if
Laltoo was with us.

1144
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:18,042
There are more
powerful guys than him.

1145
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:21,167
Can't we do something, Qasim?

1146
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:26,083
I'll try one last time. My boss is
no longer with me you see.

1147
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:29,167
You see politics is
made of turncoats.

1148
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:33,125
A few deaths will turn them
again, right, Basheer?

1149
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:35,458
I also think so.

1150
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:40,417
It's time to mobilise people.
There is a lull.

1151
01:33:41,167 --> 01:33:42,583
It's the correct time.

1152
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:45,667
It would be of help if one
man were with us...

1153
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:46,792
Who?

1154
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:48,500
Saqlain Maqsood.

1155
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:51,000
Son of Parvez Maqsood.

1156
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,208
He's back.

1157
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,417
When was he gone?

1158
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:58,750
He was looking to take control of the River
after his father died.

1159
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:04,458
Get it, Akhtar? He is the new
boss of all pirates and smugglers.

1160
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:07,042
Police and coast guards
are shit scared!

1161
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:11,292
Why, has the Syndicate
lost contr-

1162
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:15,292
We've to be more careful
because things are quiet.

1163
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:19,042
Untill we kill each of
those scumbags.

1164
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,708
We need Saqlain Maqsood with
us to get the full control.

1165
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,667
Chheno, fix the meeting.

1166
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:28,167
I, Laltoo, Tony &...

1167
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:30,708
where is he?

1168
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,083
Absent today as well?

1169
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,500
No, he couldn't make it, bro.

1170
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:38,708
You know how it is.

1171
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,667
Even bloody I don't
feature in this matter.

1172
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:45,625
Nor does my opinion.-
- But we're not here to play games.

1173
01:34:45,708 --> 01:34:50,542
Disorganized crime swamps the area,
Laltoo can't manage this anarchy alone...

1174
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:54,208
Besides, my uncle's murderers
are roaming freely,

1175
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,958
Does he have no responsibility?
Such a short memory?

1176
01:34:57,083 --> 01:35:00,917
Akhtar bhai, I think it
isn't Markaz's fault.

1177
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:06,750
That woman casts a spell.
I have seen them together.

1178
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:09,375
The more the love,
the more the addiction!

1179
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,167
'Addiction', indeed.

1180
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,707
The man who was crying helplessly
at the funeral,

1181
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:17,958
forgets guns, business,
revenge... everything!

1182
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:35,208
You were better off in that land
Why come here to drench yourself?

1183
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:40,875
I'm drowning and floating in this sea
The swim is unending

1184
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:50,375
You were better off in that land
Why come here to drench yourself?

1185
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:56,042
I'm drowning and floating in this sea
The swim is unending

1186
01:35:56,875 --> 01:36:02,667
This pretence to stay away
Riding on complaints and regrets

1187
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:08,250
The wind of laughter caresses my body
Fills up my eyes, like yours

1188
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:14,292
I keep lathering my walls with paint
Hoping that you will visit me

1189
01:36:14,417 --> 01:36:19,708
Let my time
Spread across your clock

1190
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:26,125
The lines of my fortune
That you have written

1191
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:31,458
And then again
A tic tac toe of mistakes made

1192
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:37,875
I too have called out to you
In the end

1193
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,250
By the nicknames I've given you
By mistake

1194
01:36:56,875 --> 01:37:02,250
Meet my eyes, slowly Like a tram

1195
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:08,208
I stumble upon it yet again
Before I let it fly

1196
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:14,167
You come through my window
With your night long conversations

1197
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:19,792
When the tired ships are gone
You can talk about me

1198
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:25,875
I have burnt my hands
In the fire of your simple heart

1199
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:31,375
Let my time
Spread across your clock

1200
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:37,417
The lines of my fortune
That you have written

1201
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:43,417
And then again
A tic tac toe of mistakes made

1202
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:49,208
I too have called out to you
In the end

1203
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:55,583
By the nicknames I've given you
By mistake

1204
01:37:56,417 --> 01:38:01,875
The lines of my fortune
That you have written

1205
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:07,208
And then again
A tic tac tow of mistakes made

1206
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:13,750
I too have called out to you
In the end

1207
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:20,125
By the nicknames I've given you
By mistake

1208
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:32,458
Akhtar will have to share the
revenue from here.

1209
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:38,167
Then we head straight
to the South, okay, Markaz?

1210
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:41,250
Far away from this dirty business.

1211
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:47,458
We'll invest in small
properties & mutual funds.

1212
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:55,667
A new project is coming
up on the Bypass road.

1213
01:38:56,792 --> 01:38:59,625
Fifty storeys.

1214
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,542
And a swimming pool
on the terrace!

1215
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:08,667
Almost like swimming
in the clouds. Get it, Romeo?

1216
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:13,000
God knows its rate
per square feet...

1217
01:39:15,542 --> 01:39:20,917
chuck it. We're good with the
Jodhpur Park or Golf Gardens locality.

1218
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,833
The initial two or three
years, we'll only travel.

1219
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:27,500
And yes,

1220
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:32,792
telling you beforehand, I want
wallpapers & a wading pool.

1221
01:39:33,042 --> 01:39:36,917
I have selected a chandelier
for the living room but...

1222
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:40,583
oh yes, a bathtub is
very important, okay?

1223
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:47,833
Of course we'll fight
over bags and shoes, can't help.

1224
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:50,375
Want to open a
restaurant, Markaz.

1225
01:39:51,542 --> 01:39:53,292
And for the capital...

1226
01:40:01,292 --> 01:40:05,375
My mole says they're
silently ganging up.

1227
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,958
They may attack anytime.

1228
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,083
There's still time,
I'm telling you.

1229
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:13,083
Let's finalise a settlement
with Saqlain Maqsood.

1230
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:17,792
Settlement is only for equals, Pavel.

1231
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:22,542
And we'll be equals only when
Markaz bhai gets out of bed and joins us.

1232
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:25,792
As the saying goes, if a dead
elephant costs a lac,

1233
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:28,792
a toothless tiger would
be at least five?

1234
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:30,000
What say, Tony bhai?

1235
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,833
Your sister is right,
brother-in-law.

1236
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:36,417
You have changed too
fast & too much!

1237
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:39,083
Pricing friends, huh? Not bad.

1238
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,333
See Tony bhai, you're a good man.

1239
01:40:41,417 --> 01:40:45,583
But people say you've
milked the Syndicate fund for years.

1240
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:47,306
That's a damn lie,
how dare you say that!-

1241
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,667
- Let me complete.

1242
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:52,250
No one would be happier
than me if this were a damn lie.

1243
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:55,083
Point is, I am just looking
at one thing right now.

1244
01:40:55,125 --> 01:40:56,292
Revenge.

1245
01:40:57,292 --> 01:41:00,333
'Zulfiqar'... know what
the word means?

1246
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:04,083
The Prophet's sword was called 'Zulfiqar'.

1247
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:08,917
And that sword slicing apart each
of those dogs, is all I can see.

1248
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:11,792
No friends, family,
acquaintances, none!

1249
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:14,792
Wo! Nephew,
let me tell you something..

1250
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:17,333
You're still new in this
area so you don't...-

1251
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:20,542
- See you.

1252
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:27,250
I'll try & get Markaz to the meeting
but can't promise anything.

1253
01:41:27,292 --> 01:41:30,250
Actually neither can I...
regarding anything.

1254
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:33,500
Chheno, stay here, need
to get a few things.

1255
01:42:56,167 --> 01:43:00,167
I've observed you. You carry the
true legacy of Zulfi bhai.

1256
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:05,875
The same brilliance, the same
bravery, the same kind of ambitions.

1257
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:08,333
Wasn't this ambitious.

1258
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:13,083
But one embezzles money and
the other is busy with a woman.

1259
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:17,167
Forget about revenge, they've
forgotten the business too.

1260
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:22,333
I just need them to convince
Saqlain and kill Basheer. Otherwise...

1261
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:24,542
they're of no use
in the long run.

1262
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:29,708
But after those dogs are hunted down,
Markaz bhai will surely come to you.

1263
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,708
For his share.

1264
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:35,292
And not for himself.
You know very well, for whom.

1265
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:39,167
God! I just know that
women!

1266
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:42,750
She was married before
Mr. Tamal too, in Kalighat.

1267
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,625
The man was poor,
couldn't handle her.

1268
01:43:45,792 --> 01:43:49,708
Then she married her distant
relative, Mr. Tamal.

1269
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:51,167
She got his property.

1270
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:54,500
Later discovered Mr. Tamal
was a big time gambler.

1271
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:57,667
She lost both, the
property and Mr. Tamal.

1272
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,417
Then she came to Zulfi bhai.

1273
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:04,833
Think about it, Zulfi
bhai's grave is still fresh.

1274
01:44:05,042 --> 01:44:08,375
Look at her,
romancing Markaz shamelessly!

1275
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:10,083
I'm telling you...

1276
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:11,750
this girl...

1277
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:16,500
can make her men do anything
for money, power and security.

1278
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,083
She can change her
choice of men too.

1279
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:21,833
Didn't get you...-
- Why...

1280
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:26,125
killing two birds with
the same stone.

1281
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:58,333
So, how are you doing, dear Basheer?

1282
01:44:58,792 --> 01:45:00,042
All good?

1283
01:45:02,083 --> 01:45:05,125
Don't be scared. I'll be gone now.

1284
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:07,708
But I'll come back again once.

1285
01:45:08,542 --> 01:45:12,250
Listen to me Zulfi,
I had no other way out.

1286
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,250
I didn't have a choice!-
- I know.

1287
01:45:15,417 --> 01:45:16,667
I know.

1288
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,417
I know everything now.

1289
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:23,375
You'll get to know everything
too. And when you do so...

1290
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:25,792
that's when I'll
come back again.

1291
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,750
Once again.

1292
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:30,458
Get to know what?

1293
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:33,500
What is left for me to know?

1294
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:36,542
What will I get to know?

1295
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:39,792
What will I come to
know? What?

1296
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,833
What do you want to say, huh?

1297
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:44,792
What?

1298
01:45:44,958 --> 01:45:47,583
I've no idea what you're saying.

1299
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,458
Stay alert.

1300
01:45:57,292 --> 01:46:00,375
Greetings, Saqlain bhai, come.-
- Greetings.

1301
01:46:02,125 --> 01:46:03,292
So...

1302
01:46:03,917 --> 01:46:06,125
where are the others?-
- Yes, Markaz and Pavel.

1303
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,333
They'll be here soon,
they're on their way.

1304
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:09,750
Are they?

1305
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:11,458
There.

1306
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:25,875
Welcome Markaz!
We were wating for you.

1307
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:28,000
You have disappeared and how!

1308
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:39,958
So...
done with your reunion?

1309
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:43,917
Tell me, how do I help
my father's murderers...-

1310
01:46:44,042 --> 01:46:46,792
- Hang on, Saqlain bhai.

1311
01:46:46,917 --> 01:46:49,667
Don't trust the hearsay.

1312
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:54,583
The Syndicate did reject
your father's proposal.

1313
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,875
But only Basheer and
Kashinath murdered him.

1314
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:59,375
Along with Zulfiqar...-
- That's wrong!

1315
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:01,333
Uncle killed only those
terrorists.

1316
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:02,083
Really.

1317
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,542
Were you there?-
- As if you were there?

1318
01:47:04,625 --> 01:47:06,875
Guys, relax!
I was there.

1319
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:08,875
Markaz too. We were there.
Yes.

1320
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:10,375
Anyway.

1321
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,333
Let's discuss the deal.

1322
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:16,708
You know about Markaz? He is
the best fighter of this area.

1323
01:47:16,792 --> 01:47:20,917
Police is with us and public hasn't
forgiven Basheer and Kashinath.

1324
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,750
Finish them & join us.
You'll profit.

1325
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:28,583
I don't want to
listen to all this.

1326
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:31,000
Along with Basheer & Kashinath,

1327
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:33,750
Zulfiqar's name is involved
in my father's murder too.

1328
01:47:33,792 --> 01:47:36,542
So I won't take sides actively.

1329
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:39,124
Get it?-
- Fine. You don't have to.

1330
01:47:39,125 --> 01:47:42,000
You can cooperate with us..

1331
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:45,375
Make sure those swines
don't escape through waterways.

1332
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:50,250
And in exchange I'll help your stuff
pass the Customs. Okay?

1333
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,917
Don't you move, you ass!

1334
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:02,542
Stop!

1335
01:48:06,792 --> 01:48:09,167
Grab him. Grab that jerk!-
- Kill him!

1336
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:14,333
Get him!

1337
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:17,083
Hey! You bastard!

1338
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:20,958
Stop, you bugger!

1339
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:28,792
Get out of the way!

1340
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:43,792
Come fast, they have attacked
Pavel, come on!

1341
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,999
Saqlain! Stay alert! They mustn't
escape via the River.

1342
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,875
Given my word, shared
food. Have faith.

1343
01:50:09,667 --> 01:50:11,750
In a hurry?

1344
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,833
Made a mistake getting out
of the rat hole, Kashi bhai!

1345
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,667
News is out! Your days are numbered.

1346
01:50:25,708 --> 01:50:29,292
Forget me.
What about you?

1347
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:32,250
Lazy Sunday afternoon.

1348
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:36,375
What's your choice? A leg piece?
Or the ribs?

1349
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:38,417
Or do you want the liver?

1350
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:41,333
What?

1351
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,625
No, Basheer bhai! Please!

1352
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,625
Come on! Move!

1353
01:51:08,042 --> 01:51:09,917
Stay down you bugger!

1354
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,750
Shoot that bugger!

1355
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,250
Bloody bastard!

1356
01:51:56,375 --> 01:51:57,500
Danish, run!

1357
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:57,875
Move! Faster, faster!

1358
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,833
Crap! Reverse the car!

1359
01:53:21,708 --> 01:53:23,500
You were the first to shoot, right?

1360
01:53:50,125 --> 01:53:51,125
Don't, Markaz.

1361
01:54:05,458 --> 01:54:07,083
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1362
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:23,375
Tony, we've worked
together, please!

1363
01:54:24,292 --> 01:54:25,542
Don't kill me, Tony!

1364
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:28,167
No, no, no... don't!

1365
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,667
Tony bhai!-
- Tony!

1366
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,500
Tony!

1367
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:24,417
Danish!

1368
01:55:29,292 --> 01:55:30,292
Danish!

1369
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:11,875
Stop firing!

1370
01:56:14,792 --> 01:56:16,917
You could've told me, right?

1371
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:18,667
Yes, right.

1372
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:22,458
What would I've told you?

1373
01:56:23,292 --> 01:56:26,542
That I've framed your
dear friend as a terrorist...

1374
01:56:26,667 --> 01:56:29,667
with the help of fake evidence?

1375
01:56:29,833 --> 01:56:33,417
That we provoked you against
him, so that you join us?

1376
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:40,875
Brother, do I have the word,
'Idiot' witten on my forehead?

1377
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:51,750
I don't know what's written
on your forehead, Kashinath.

1378
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:56,417
Because like your fate,
your forehead is doomed.

1379
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,417
Do you know what Danish told me?

1380
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:06,750
He told me that you are the
illegitimate brother of Pariza.

1381
01:57:08,417 --> 01:57:10,250
But, now...

1382
01:57:11,833 --> 01:57:15,375
a new question arises.

1383
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:22,542
Why did you do this to Zulfiqar?

1384
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:24,333
Huh?

1385
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:36,207
Basheer, do you know the name
of India's deputy prime minister?

1386
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:38,000
What!

1387
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:41,500
Our Vice-president's name?

1388
01:57:42,708 --> 01:57:49,292
Or the second guys who stepped on
the Moon or climbed the Everest?

1389
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:54,292
Deputy, vice, second
position, silver medals...

1390
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:56,625
no one remembers these, Basheer.

1391
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,083
If you've to reach the top...-

1392
02:00:45,458 --> 02:00:47,250
'News for the deaf and dumb.'

1393
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:11,708
Excuse me! Where's Rani?

1394
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:14,333
She's upstairs.

1395
02:02:05,625 --> 02:02:12,083
They say they've been waiting since
Uncle's time to take over the bar.

1396
02:02:14,042 --> 02:02:17,958
His shoulders and eyes,
you've inherited both.

1397
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:22,375
The Syndicate has been disbanded now.

1398
02:02:22,542 --> 02:02:24,958
Basheer & Kashinath
are finished too.

1399
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:28,792
You see, now people
come to me for help

1400
02:02:28,875 --> 02:02:31,250
Otherwise they go to Laltoo.

1401
02:02:33,417 --> 02:02:36,792
Markaz & Tony are hardly...-
- Did you eat anything since morning?

1402
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:39,833
Want something to eat?

1403
02:03:00,917 --> 02:03:04,250
The same ambitions.

1404
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:12,083
Otherwise, the foreign-returned
guitar player, our Mr. Akhtar...

1405
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:16,000
and here you are...-
- They've money, Rani.

1406
02:03:16,375 --> 02:03:19,625
They are important,
I can't say no to them.

1407
02:03:19,958 --> 02:03:22,083
I'll have to listen to them.

1408
02:03:22,417 --> 02:03:24,375
Can't refuse!

1409
02:03:37,083 --> 02:03:40,375
I have nothing except
this Blue Nile Bar.

1410
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:47,292
'We', have nothing, except this.

1411
02:06:06,708 --> 02:06:10,875
I had no way out.

1412
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:20,542
I did it for us.

1413
02:06:29,583 --> 02:06:32,667
We couldn't have lived
on the road.

1414
02:06:33,333 --> 02:06:36,292
Nor in that small room of yours.

1415
02:06:47,333 --> 02:06:51,917
A luxury yesterday is a
need today.

1416
02:06:52,833 --> 02:06:58,375
Everyone buys the
future, Markaz.

1417
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,583
Please!

1418
02:07:06,458 --> 02:07:07,542
Please!

1419
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:13,583
I'm doing good these days

1420
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:20,500
The nights look dazzling without you

1421
02:08:22,833 --> 02:08:26,667
I'm doing good these days

1422
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:35,667
I'm doing good these days

1423
02:08:36,875 --> 02:08:43,042
The nights look dazzling without you

1424
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:50,083
I'm doing good these days

1425
02:09:19,125 --> 02:09:26,500
My feet don't get numb
To cross the road anymore

1426
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:34,333
The numerous Norwesters
Don't hit me anymore

1427
02:09:35,167 --> 02:09:41,708
Listen, there's nothing
called habit in this world

1428
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,375
To change is to stay alive

1429
02:09:46,625 --> 02:09:52,083
And I'll live for another 100 years
Know this

1430
02:09:52,333 --> 02:09:56,625
Even if the streets become empty

1431
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:08,750
I'm doing good these days

1432
02:10:09,833 --> 02:10:17,042
The nights look dazzling without you

1433
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:22,500
I'm doing good

1434
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:36,750
Anyway, take rest. We must go
now. Enough talking.

1435
02:10:36,792 --> 02:10:39,542
What rest are you
talking about, man?

1436
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:42,708
I've to get back to work. How'll
you run the show alone?

1437
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:44,684
So much of accounting
and financial disputes...-

1438
02:10:44,708 --> 02:10:45,875
I'll take care of the show.

1439
02:10:46,042 --> 02:10:47,792
Just don't worry.
You take rest.

1440
02:10:48,333 --> 02:10:51,000
Oh! That's very sweet of you,
I'll tell you that.

1441
02:10:51,042 --> 02:10:52,333
Let's go.

1442
02:10:52,542 --> 02:10:54,917
We were just leaving.-
- Bye, Laltoo Das.

1443
02:10:58,083 --> 02:11:00,250
Oh hello!-
- Hello.

1444
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:03,792
I haven't seen you
around, Sister. New?

1445
02:11:05,375 --> 02:11:07,667
What's your name?-
- Niyati. (Destiny)

1446
02:11:10,083 --> 02:11:11,333
Niyati Dey.

1447
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:17,875
I have resolved Chheno's matter.-
- Good, he wasn't reliable at all.

1448
02:11:19,125 --> 02:11:20,292
Hmm.

1449
02:11:20,708 --> 02:11:24,917
That means, it's just
you, I & Tony now.

1450
02:11:25,167 --> 02:11:27,625
I've employed a young
boy for the accounts.

1451
02:11:27,708 --> 02:11:29,375
He'll stay in my control.

1452
02:11:29,417 --> 02:11:30,708
And Tony?

1453
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:36,833
Good, the Syndicate's gone.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

1454
02:11:36,958 --> 02:11:39,833
Besides, Democracy doesn't
work everywhere, Laltoo.

1455
02:11:39,917 --> 02:11:43,750
In that case, 'Democracy' becomes
'Democrazy'.

1456
02:11:43,833 --> 02:11:47,750
That means, now I'm the legal one
and you, the 'un-legal' one.

1457
02:11:47,792 --> 02:11:51,292
Unless you get transferred
like in Hindi films.

1458
02:11:51,375 --> 02:11:54,000
You're a witness to so much after all.-
- As in?

1459
02:11:54,083 --> 02:11:55,375
Just kidding.

1460
02:11:55,958 --> 02:11:57,708
Sir, the car has arrived.

1461
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,375
Tell him I'm coming.

1462
02:12:04,875 --> 02:12:07,167
So long, Arghya.

1463
02:12:08,750 --> 02:12:13,042
You now know all the
people & the incidents.

1464
02:12:13,375 --> 02:12:15,375
Now, handle it yourself.

1465
02:12:15,667 --> 02:12:18,625
And yes, remember one thing.

1466
02:12:19,083 --> 02:12:23,083
Grass, grasshopper, rat,
snake, hawk, human...

1467
02:12:24,167 --> 02:12:26,792
Food chain.
Bye.

1468
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:30,833
I'll leave now.

1469
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:34,375
Watch your paunch!

1470
02:13:08,625 --> 02:13:13,542
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1471
02:13:15,167 --> 02:13:20,375
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1472
02:13:22,083 --> 02:13:28,792
A saint sings From an old Mosque

1473
02:13:28,917 --> 02:13:34,208
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1474
02:13:35,542 --> 02:13:42,250
A saint sings From an old Mosque

1475
02:13:42,458 --> 02:13:48,583
Lifeless dolls and lifeless songs
Make up only for regrets

1476
02:13:49,042 --> 02:13:52,167
The King fell very ill

1477
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:55,667
The palace burnt
The heart broke down

1478
02:13:56,042 --> 02:14:02,208
The King's crown, the King's cape
Shall adorn someone else today

1479
02:14:02,708 --> 02:14:09,125
A s aint sings
From an old Mosque

1480
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:15,375
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1481
02:14:16,167 --> 02:14:22,292
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1482
02:14:23,125 --> 02:14:29,250
Everyone fell off one by one
As the throne kept guffawing

1483
02:14:29,625 --> 02:14:35,917
When Violence is your lover
Why will the throne shy away

1484
02:14:36,667 --> 02:14:43,000
He who is a friend
Changes colour in a moment

1485
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:50,125
The smile that charmed you
Turned out fake in the end, too

1486
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:56,917
It is among all this, that
I must walk the dusk

1487
02:14:57,042 --> 02:15:03,000
This is how the dusty, empty streets
Teach me how to live

1488
02:15:03,583 --> 02:15:10,208
A saint sings From an old Mosque

1489
02:15:10,583 --> 02:15:16,708
Lifeless dolls and lifeless songs
Make up only for regrets

1490
02:15:17,125 --> 02:15:20,250
The King fell very ill

1491
02:15:20,583 --> 02:15:23,750
The palace burnt
The heart broke down

1492
02:16:04,583 --> 02:16:11,083
I protect my wounds with this hand
Thanking else with it

1493
02:16:11,417 --> 02:16:17,667
And with the other hand
I grab my weapon

1494
02:16:18,167 --> 02:16:24,458
A miscalculation
And a night was coloured with blood

1495
02:16:24,958 --> 02:16:31,333
Who'll carry this to God?
Where do I write my letter to?

1496
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:37,917
It is among all this, that
I must walk the dusk

1497
02:16:38,375 --> 02:16:44,333
This is how the dusty, empty streets
Teach me how to live

1498
02:16:45,167 --> 02:16:51,875
A saint sings From an old Mosque

1499
02:16:52,333 --> 02:16:58,458
Lifeless dolls and lifeless songs
Make up only for regrets

1500
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,042
The King fell very ill

1501
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:05,375
The palace burnt
The heart broke down

1502
02:17:05,833 --> 02:17:12,000
The King's crown, the King's cape
Shall adorn someone else today

A saint sings From an old Mosque

1504
02:17:19,542 --> 02:17:26,250
A saint sings From an old Mosque

1505
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:31,750
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1506
02:17:32,167 --> 02:17:38,125
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1507
02:17:39,583 --> 02:17:44,500
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1508
02:17:46,292 --> 02:17:52,125
Oh saviour! God, the saviour!

1509
02:17:55,958 --> 02:17:56,958
IF
