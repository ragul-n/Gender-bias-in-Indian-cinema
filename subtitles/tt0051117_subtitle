2
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,990
Meena, Meena?

3
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,400
- Yes father?
- What are you doing, dear?

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,239
It's my friend, Shobha's
birthday day after tomorrow.

5
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,700
- I have to go to the city.
- City?

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,810
- Should I not go?
- It's not that.

7
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,640
I thought, with your studies over...

8
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,250
you won't have anything
to do with the city.

9
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,049
- Leaving me alone...
- It's just for two days.

10
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,310
Two days? Meena, if your
father was alive...

11
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,110
even he would not love
you as much as I do.

12
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,670
I know. Since I grew up,
I treat you as my world.

13
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,150
If my leaving hurts you so
much, I won't go.

14
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,679
No dear, do go.

15
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,130
- But when you mention the city...
- Your heart becomes restless.

16
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,650
But why, father? I'm sure you're
hiding something from me.

17
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,760
- What's in the city?
- Looters.

18
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,519
- Looters?
- Yes.

19
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,559
Those who loot the happiness
of innocent people.

20
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,010
The city where you're going
snatched my happiness.

21
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,940
What are you saying, father?

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,420
Yes dear, even I used
to live in the city once.

23
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,880
But then, my name was not
Sardar Rajpal, but only Gopal.

24
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,000
I had a home, a loving wife,
and a beautiful son, Shankar.

25
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,940
Then fate took a turn.

26
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,420
Those who I considered friends
turned out to be deceivers.

27
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,089
Amar and Vishnu were two brothers
who looted all my wealth.

28
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,640
Then came the night whose memory
torments me even today.

29
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,590
No! Don't do that Amar.
Vishnu, don't do that.

30
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,980
You two brothers are my friends.

31
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,030
You've been looting me for months.

32
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,960
I had pawned my wife's jewelry
and brought this money.

33
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,640
You looted even this? Return
this money or I'll be ruined.

34
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,460
- Get lost!
- Vishnu, you're my friend.

35
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,480
Please don't ruin me.
Please explain to Amar.

36
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,039
Actually, brother is a dimwit.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,580
Don't worry, you have this ring.

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,640
Stake it, maybe your destiny shines.

39
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,150
- What say, brother?
- Not a bad idea.

40
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,599
You rascal! Scoundrel! Looter!

41
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
Beware! Don't let him go.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I'll teach you a lesson!

43
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,140
- Brother!
- Move!

44
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,400
Stop, I said stop!

45
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,450
Brother!

46
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,500
Brother!

47
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,240
- What happened?
- Don't touch me, Kamla.

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,030
Or my sins may rub off on you.
I'm a murderer.

49
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,220
Husband!

50
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,460
- I killed Amarnath.
- What are you saying?

51
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,770
I'm stating a fact.

52
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,220
I'm a murderer, a criminal.

53
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
Kamla, I'm handing Shankar
over to you.

54
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,640
I'll take him
back from you one day.

55
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,320
- Where is Gopal?
- Where is Gopal?

56
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,740
You cannot hide him. He has killed
my brother. I will have him hanged!

57
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,950
He can't escape now.

58
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,610
Even if he does,
you two will not.

59
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,719
The neighbours tried to save Gopal's
wife Kamladevi and his son, Shankar...

60
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,520
but the whole house had caught fire
and it wasn't possible to enter.

61
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,740
The whole house was gutted and
neither mother nor son were ever found.

62
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,960
No! This cannot happen.
This is not possible.

63
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,020
The whole world believes
they're dead, but not I.

64
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:43,540
I roamed every city and village,
but couldn't find Kamla or Shankar.

65
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,859
Dejected, I wanted to end my life,
when God sent you.

66
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,510
You were an orphan,
and I had no one, either.

67
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,070
I gathered you in my arms and came
and settled in the jungles of Assam.

68
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,770
I earned back my lost wealth
but lost my peace of mind forever.

69
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,310
You suffered such a huge sorrow,
and I don't even know.

70
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,419
What was the point telling you?

71
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,320
And look how your smiling eyes
are brimmed with tears now.

72
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,880
Take, wipe your tears.

73
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,510
Now get ready to go to the city.

74
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,110
And yes dear, since you're going
to the city, do me a favor.

75
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,059
That rascal Bhola and his men
have started stealing openly.

76
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:41,499
To protect our land and animals,
I need two such men...

77
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,329
who know horse riding and shooting.

78
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,780
They'll be paid a salary of Rs. 300.

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,699
Since you're going to the city,
place an advertisement.

80
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,040
Understood?

81
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,449
I have an excellent idea. We can find
your wife and son by placing an ad.

82
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,620
With an ad,
even my enemies can find me.

83
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,550
Why do you have to give your name?

84
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,460
Place the ad under the name
you're known as, Sardar Rajpal.

85
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
But then, how will my wife
and son know it's my ad?

86
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,690
Yes.

87
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,230
Father, how did
you address your wife?

88
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,250
I used to call her Kamlu.

89
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:37,219
Use that name in the ad. God willing,
your message will reach your wife.

90
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,310
And my son, Shankar.

91
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,980
Look.

92
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,280
He must have grown up now.

93
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,730
These lovely youthful persons,
without drinking

94
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,210
Are lighting lamps in the way

95
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,450
I wonder for who among them am I

96
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,020
I wonder who among them is for me

97
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,890
For me, for me!

98
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,110
All are beautiful,
all are young

99
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,580
To whom do I lose my heart?

100
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,560
All of them can be
the guest of my heart

101
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,020
Who all can I call?

102
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,050
These lovely youthful persons,
without drinking

103
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,550
Are lighting lamps in the way

104
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,050
I wonder for who among them am I

105
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,670
I wonder who among them is for me

106
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,219
For me, for me!

107
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,699
I was crazy for love

108
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,050
So I became desperate

109
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,280
She was away from my sight

110
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,990
So I committed the crime

111
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,320
These lovely youthful persons,
without drinking

112
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,640
Are lighting lamps in the way

113
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,089
I wonder for who among them am I

114
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,390
I wonder who among them is for me

115
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,030
For me, for me!

116
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,140
- Uncle!
- Shankar, what about your job?

117
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm just waiting for war to begin.

118
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,840
As soon as the war bugle sounds,
I'll be called back to my old job.

119
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,690
- The military again?
- Army life is great.

120
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,620
What style! What grandeur!
The last time I went to Burma...

121
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,220
I know that, but just think how long
your old mother will sew clothes...

122
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,840
- to run the house?
- That's what I came to tell her.

123
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,150
Look.

124
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,560
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't ask where and how I got it...

125
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,980
but it's honest money.

126
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,780
- Have you been to a race course?
- No.

127
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
What a strange place it is.

128
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,770
Horses run on one side, and asses
scream on the other, 'come on, come on!'

129
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,699
And sometimes, even God listens
to those asses. God, you are great!

130
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,569
Just let me see you once, husband.
I am holding my breath..

131
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,920
for just one glimpse.

132
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,630
Worshiping your husband?

133
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,819
Whether you get angry, or feel happy,
but when I see you worshiping him...

134
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,400
- I get very angry.
- He is my husband, and your father.

135
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,330
A man who can lose his innocent
wife's jewelry in gambling...

136
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,070
who can leave her to suffer...

137
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,380
who can make his little kid
helpless, homeless...

138
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,880
is not anyone's husband,
nor anyone's father.

139
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,980
You're foolish. That's why you
speak like that about him.

140
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,490
What do you know what
tragedy befell him.

141
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,420
Whether I know that or not, I do
know what you and I have suffered.

142
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,520
Every kid in the neighbourhood
shunned me as I was a murderer's son.

143
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,100
They turned away from me,
taking me to be a criminal's son.

144
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,460
And this man, he cared
so much for his life...

145
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,800
he didn't bother to check
whether we were dead or alive.

146
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,740
What does he know where we are?

147
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,760
Who knows what he suffered? I'm sure
even his heart must be desperate for us.

148
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,460
He must be looking for us.
We will surely find him one day.

149
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,910
The day we do, you'll have to choose
between your husband and your son.

150
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,160
That's my final decision, mom.

151
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,050
Needed, two men to look
after an estate.

152
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,949
Must know horse riding and
shooting. Meet on this address...

153
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,330
Sardar Rajpal, Sunanagar,
Ghatpur, Assam.

154
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,110
To my Kamlu, wherever you are.

155
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,530
20 years ago,
the treasure I gave you...

156
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,620
it's time you returned it to me.

157
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,320
Bring my son and come to me
as soon as possible.

158
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,680
Sardar Rajpal,
Sunanagar, Ghatpur, Assam.

159
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,329
You answered my prayer.
Thank you, God.

160
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,440
- Saw this ad?
- I just read it.

161
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,210
I suspect this man.

162
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,310
Write to the Ghatpur police station
and find out who this Rajpal is.

163
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,189
- I want information immediately.
- Yes sir.

164
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,680
I found him! I found him!

165
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:13,938
- Who?
- My enemy, and your uncle's killer.

166
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,849
Read the newspaper.

167
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,080
He's placed two ads.

168
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,209
The first calls for two
caretakers for his estate.

169
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,869
The other is in his wife,
Kamla's name...

170
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,820
who he often
called Kamlu in my presence.

171
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,860
But perhaps he doesn't know
that his wife and son are long dead.

172
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,050
I still remember that night.

173
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,930
My young brother's dead body
was lying on the cold floor...

174
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,810
and the killer had run away.

175
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,460
With shivering hands, I touched
his blood and swore to take revenge.

176
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,360
Sohan, that day has come today.

177
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,689
I have to settle an old score.

178
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,640
- What are you doing?
- Informing the police about the killer.

179
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,750
Daddy, you'll inform the police,
Gopal will be arrested and hanged.

180
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,110
- What will you gain by his death?
- What nonsense are you talking?

181
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,510
Just think. A man has looked
for his son for 20 years.

182
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,460
He has gathered wealth
for his son with hard work and toil.

183
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,610
Before dying, he wants to
hand over his wealth to his son.

184
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,290
If he comes to know his son
is dead...

185
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,380
why will he fear the gallows,
why will he rue death?

186
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,190
What are you trying to say?
I don't understand anything.

187
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,220
There can be a bigger punishment
than the gallows, and that is...

188
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,860
that his enemy takes
away his hard earned wealth.

189
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,240
The enemy from whom he is hiding.

190
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,909
- How is that possible?
- Very easily.

191
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,780
From Gopal's ad, it is obvious he
believes his wife and son are alive.

192
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,860
But they both are dead.
Yet, one man will come to Gopal...

193
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,010
posing as his son. Who he will
hand over his entire wealth to.

194
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,120
- Who?
- Me.

195
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,970
I had lost hope, but seeing
your message, I have found new life.

196
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,140
Husband, I had promised that the
day I learned you were alive...

197
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,510
I'd go on a pilgrimage
before meeting you.

198
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,250
But Shankar isn't coming with me.

199
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,379
I'm sending your son, Shankar, to you.

200
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,220
But what's sad is that he
has no love lost for you.

201
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,740
He's developed a hatred for you
because of all the problems we endured.

202
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,340
I haven't been able to eliminate
the hatred from his heart until today.

203
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,030
He's not coming to you as your son,
but in response to your ad for a job.

204
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,220
If he learns you're his father,
he won't stay a minute longer.

205
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,000
Here, this is a recommendation
letter addressed to Mr. Rajpal.

206
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,500
Rasiklal has written this letter.

207
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,570
- Seeing this letter, he'll immediately
give you the job. - Really?

208
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,310
And listen, write to me as
soon as you get the job.

209
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,910
I'll come to you immediately.

210
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
You'll get a place to stay.

211
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,720
Mom, you're acting so happy,
like I'm not getting a job of Rs. 300...

212
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,290
but some huge inheritance.

213
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,460
God willing, that's what will happen.

214
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,100
Now hurry up, it's time for the train.

215
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,310
- Enough. Go.
- Loafer!

216
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,949
No.

217
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,879
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

218
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,740
- Where are you going?
- To Sitapur, for a holiday. And you?

219
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,659
Sunanagar, back home.
I was afraid it's a night journey.

220
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,270
I wonder who I'll get for company.
But it will be fun now.

221
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,500
Just unpack my bedding.
I'll buy some magazines and return.

222
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Come soon.

223
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,100
- Sister!
- Ramu?

224
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,540
- Sister, father met with an accident.
- Oh God, how did that happen?

225
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,399
Ask all that later.
You can't go now.

226
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,810
Come soon, he won't live long now.

227
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,800
How nice! I turned my back, and you
switched off the light and went to sleep.

228
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,380
You can't sleep so soon.
I have a lot to say to you.

229
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,960
Will you pull back your blanket,
or do you want a thrashing?

230
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,770
Just you wait!
I know how to make you get up.

231
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,639
You?

232
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,220
You rascal, scoundrel, loafer!

233
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,659
I've put them all
in another compartment.

234
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,820
I am an ordinary man,
an artist, lover of beauty.

235
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,080
Just you wait! I'll pull the chain
and get you arrested.

236
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,300
Arrested? Perhaps you think
this is a ladies compartment.

237
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,520
Maybe not, but you have misbehaved
with me, you are after me.

238
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,659
You pulled my blanket,
and I misbehaved?

239
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,170
I thought it was my friend,
and you pretended to sleep.

240
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,340
I won't travel on this train.
You'll have to vacate this compartment.

241
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,020
Madam, I've paid first class fare.
I didn't get in ticketless.

242
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,780
Let me see who makes
me leave the compartment.

243
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,879
Pull the chain. But remember,
the fine is only Rs. 50.

244
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,330
And sometimes,
you even have to go to jail.

245
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,429
- Pull the chain.
- Okay.

246
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,010
Why, don't have courage? I knew you
wouldn't be able to pull the chain.

247
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,540
Just think,
what a strange meeting this is.

248
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,950
We'll talk the rest during day.
And remember...

249
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,350
Hey, I've hired that horse cart.
You can't go in that.

250
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,060
My luggage reached here before you.

251
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,830
Coachman, put my luggage in.

252
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,460
Don't you dare! If you put her
luggage in the cart...

253
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,139
I'll pull off your long moustache!

254
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,270
What are you doing! The fight is
between you two, why hurt my moustache?

255
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,840
I'm a military man,
I attack the moustache first.

256
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,880
You won't dare.

257
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,220
Don't worry, put my luggage in,
or I'll make mince of you!

258
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,370
- Madam has a meat shop.
- What are you doing? Why do you fight?

259
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,050
Where do you want to go?

260
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,550
- I want to go to Ghatpur.
- And you?

261
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,730
Where do you want to go?

262
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,040
Ha! Finally!

263
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,949
I wanted to go somewhere else...

264
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,670
else, but I'll go to Ghatpur now.

265
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,000
- What is your name?
- Prem Kumar.

266
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,729
I'm a born lover.
Worshiping beauty is my job.

267
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,950
- Tell me, will I get a job?
- Sure.

268
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,270
- Coachman, how far is Ghatpur?
- 20 miles.

269
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,950
20 miles! Oh my God! Do we have
to shake like this until evening?

270
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,060
Do you like music?

271
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,740
I do, but how can I sing
in your presence?

272
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,760
- Ask madam to sing.
- What say, madam?

273
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,879
Madam is in a bad mood.
I think you should sing.

274
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,040
Don't you dare sing. Just quietly
move on or you've had it from me!

275
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,639
What a dull person you.
Don't sing, don't talk about love.

276
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,310
How will we kill time?
Coachman, sing!

277
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,710
- He won't dare!
- No sir, I will not sing!

278
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,620
Though I have seen many beauties...

279
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,190
but not anyone like you

280
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,460
Oh, your look, oh, your style!

281
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,060
Who wouldn't swoon?

282
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,990
Are they your tresses,
or dark clouds?

283
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,810
Are they your eyes,
or lightning?

284
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,600
I wonder who will be slain

285
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,110
Though I have seen many beauties...

286
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,300
but not anyone like you

287
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,130
You are beautiful,
the weather is beautiful

288
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,680
My heart is
not in my control today

289
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,300
The paths are silent

290
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,150
The heartbeats are inebriated

291
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,040
I am on a high without drinking

292
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,540
Though I have seen many beauties..

293
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,280
but not anyone like you

294
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,750
If you don't speak to me...

295
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,449
I will not die

296
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,610
Are you a fairy,
or some divine beauty?

297
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:29,230
Why are you so proud?

298
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,980
Try listening to someone sometime

299
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,450
Though I have seen many beauties...

300
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,770
but not anyone like you

301
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,910
Every kid has left.

302
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,460
Remember, if I don't reach Ghatpur
by evening, you've had it!

303
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,300
You don't know who I am.

304
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,140
Who are you? Are you some big shot?
Why are you harassing a poor man?

305
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,280
Just let me reach Ghatpur.
I'll teach you such a lesson...

306
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,490
- you'll remember all your life.
- Promise?

307
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,340
Oh great! She didn't even pay me.

308
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,190
You're so worried about the fare?

309
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,100
I know, she took your
very precious thing.

310
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,790
- Your precious heart.
- You understood a little too much.

311
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,540
- Repair the wheel soon, or...
- My moustache will be gone.

312
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,030
One didn't pay me,
and the other is after my moustache.

313
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,840
Wheel.

314
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,910
- Why did you stop?
- There's a storm ahead.

315
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,560
- It's dangerous to keep moving.
- Then I'll get drenched here all night?

316
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,500
A Colonel's bungalow is ahead,
I'll drop you there. Get down.

317
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,680
Caretaker!

318
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,510
- Who are you?
- Isn't Colonel home?

319
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,780
Look, I was going home, but the storm
came along. Let me stay here tonight.

320
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,280
Brother, she's well known here.
Let her spend the night here.

321
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,879
Alright, come in.

322
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,730
Thank you, madam.

323
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,610
Come.

324
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,710
Change your clothes and go to sleep.
And leave early morning. Okay?

325
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,409
Okay.

326
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,629
Oh God! The Colonel has come!
I'm doomed!

327
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,840
Colonel has come?

328
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,960
Where are you barging in?
Who are you?

329
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,370
- You didn't recognise me?
- No.

330
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,089
He didn't recognise me.
Didn't I tell you?

331
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,659
You were right.

332
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,500
Don't worry friend, Colonel knows
me very well. He's my very...

333
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,529
Old friend. You studied together.
Have you even seen him?

334
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:53,170
What are you saying? I'm a military man.
I saved his life in the last war.

335
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,140
He's right. I even saw
his picture in the newspaper.

336
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,370
Didn't you? Tell this idiot.

337
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,740
Did you hear? And listen, inform the
Colonel of our arrival in the morning.

338
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,800
I don't like it alone here.
Understood?

339
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,390
Understood. You also stay here.

340
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,390
Me too? You mean, there's
someone else here, too?

341
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,009
Yes, a very old friend
of the Colonel.

342
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,020
What a strange coincidence. Even if
we met, it's at the Colonel's home.

343
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,120
Yes, it's a strange coincidence.

344
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:42,190
It's good you met me or,
without the Colonel I wouldn't like it here.

345
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,090
Yes. I 'm very tired now.
I'll speak to you in the morning.

346
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,960
Coachman, here's your fare.

347
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,230
And get the cart tomorrow morning
before the Colonel arrives.

348
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,740
Good bye, sir.

349
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,130
Caretaker, get my luggage. Come on!

350
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,630
What rude behavior is that?

351
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,250
I am sending your son to you.
He's not coming to meet his father...

352
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,040
but in response to the ad
for a job.

353
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,790
Despite being alive,
Shankar cannot harm me.

354
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,790
Kamla's letter will prove
that I am Gopal's son.

355
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,150
If anyone can stall our success,
it is Kamla.

356
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,500
So the moment you get my letter,
go to her house, and forever...

357
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,150
Yours, Sohan.

358
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,730
Hey! My clothes?

359
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,630
The brazen fellow!
I'll teach him a lesson!

360
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,250
You brazen girl!
I'll teach you a lesson!

361
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,510
You rascal!
Won't you stop your stupid acts?

362
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,930
I'm asking you that! You think you
can get away with anything with me?

363
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,580
And you can get away with anything
with me? I'll have you skinned alive.

364
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,670
I'll have you hanged upside down.

365
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,590
I can get very angry.
Where are my clothes?

366
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,839
You steal my clothes,
and then accuse me?

367
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,060
What do I want with your clothes?
- What do I want with yours?

368
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,590
- What do I know? - What do I know?
- You won't say? - You won't say?

369
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,160
I ask, why did you open the
bungalow without my orders?

370
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,350
I have already shot you twice?
Where are those two?

371
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,500
- I'll kill you!
- But Colonel, wait! Listen to me.

372
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,350
- My gun is loaded.
- And I have turned cold.

373
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,960
Stop your nonsense,
and say your last prayer.

374
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,150
Who is this? Come out!
Come out, or I'll shoot you.

375
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,600
Quick!

376
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,090
What is this I'm seeing?

377
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,980
A woman and a man in my bungalow?
That too, in semi-nude state?

378
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,540
Such shamelessness? Such brazenness?

379
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,850
Who are you two?
Tell me, or I'll shoot you both!

380
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,240
She, I don't know her.
- What?

381
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:57,680
- She, is my wife. Right?
- Yes...wife.

382
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:04,450
- Oh, you mean wife.
- Yes, life partner.

383
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,740
But why are you in this state?

384
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,050
Actually, our clothes got
stolen last night.

385
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,980
Stolen! I'll kill him! Caretaker,
find the thief, or I'll shoot you.

386
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,480
Go to my room, take some clothes
from my wardrobe and wear them.

387
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,569
- Go soon.
- Thank you.

388
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,410
Colonel, we'll join you soon.
Shall we go, darling?

389
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,560
You rascal! You take
advantage of the situation?

390
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,830
- ls this how you talk to you husband?
- Husband?

391
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,230
You aren't fit to even
polish my shoes.

392
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,140
You're right.
I just cannot polish.

393
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,110
You seem to love
each other very much.

394
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,800
You can assume we are two
bodies and one soul.

395
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,140
It's about love, Colonel.
Actually, we had a love marriage.

396
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,550
Not my foot, love marriage.

397
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,530
- Now tell me, what do you want?
- We first want some clothes.

398
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:30,720
What behavior is this? I'm not
some thief, but a respectable man.

399
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,419
Sir, he's the same man
who stole the clothes.

400
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,920
Colonel, there is no need to shoot
him. We'll hand him over to the police.

401
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,100
Lock him up. I'll decide about
him after I return from the city.

402
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,590
You're leaving, Colonel?

403
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,620
Oh yes, I'll send
my coach back tomorrow.

404
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,830
- Goodbye sir.
- Get lost!

405
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,299
- You're great, Colonel! Right darling?
- Darling indeed!

406
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,760
- What is it?
- A man has come.

407
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,580
He asked me to give you this letter.

408
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,940
If he comes to know you're his father,
he won't stay a minute with you.

409
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,160
So until I return, keep this a secret.

410
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,910
My son! My Shankar!

411
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,129
But he shouldn't learn I'm his father.

412
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,000
- Hello.
- Bless you, son.

413
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,270
Sit down.

414
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,020
You also sit down.

415
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,050
- You've brought this letter?
- Yes.

416
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,680
- What's your name?
- Shankar.

417
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,080
The man whose
recommendation letter you brought...

418
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,020
he has done me many favors.

419
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,020
- I can't refuse his word.
- Should I assume I have the job?

420
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,220
Of course. If you work well,
I won't treat you as an employee...

421
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,330
but love you like a father
loves his son.

422
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,650
- Father's love?
- What's the matter?

423
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,470
I've never experienced a father's
love, nor ever wish to.

424
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,270
Forget all that.
Tell me what I will have to do.

425
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:34,990
About 10 miles away from here
is my village, and a huge stable.

426
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,230
Your duty will only
be to oversee.

427
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,060
You take a bath and eat something.
Then come with me.

428
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:51,740
I found my clothes, but the
recommendation letter you gave me...

429
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,720
I don't know where it got lost.

430
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,350
So send me another letter
as soon as possible.

431
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,350
Only then will I proceed from here.
Your son, Shankar.

432
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,000
- Please post this letter quickly.
- Okay.

433
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,299
And until I receive the reply,
I'll have to stay here.

434
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,750
Whether its reply comes or not, as soon
as Colonel's cart comes, I'll leave.

435
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,830
Leaving your husband behind?
Remember, you'll burn in the fires of hell.

436
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,049
There's a limit to one's cheapness.

437
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,819
I've never hated anyone
as much as I hate you.

438
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,020
Honestly? A big philosopher has said
that hate is the first step to love.

439
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,280
Not a philosopher,
he must be a nut like you.

440
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,540
Great!

441
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:07,560
Your wife seems to be very hot headed.
You just can't control her.

442
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,380
Yes. Look what the world has come to.

443
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,770
Damn the world! What is a man
who can't control his wife?

444
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,880
- Only if she's my wife.
- She's not your wife?

445
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,259
- Shall I tell you an idea?
- Tell me.

446
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,700
- First open this door.
- No, you're good where you are.

447
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,089
You're very mean.
As if I'll run away.

448
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,420
- Even I am a respectable man.
- Oh yes, it's obvious from your face.

449
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,740
From my stomach.

450
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,190
Sir, the Colonel has sent
the horse cart for you.

451
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,130
- Take me along.
- Shut-up!

452
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,850
Very good, but we aren't
ready to go yet.

453
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,310
I am.

454
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,430
Bravo!

455
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,950
Coachman, don't you dare take my
wife without my permission.

456
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,030
Sir, I'm driving the coach.
To stop your wife is your job.

457
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,930
Hey, listen!

458
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:15,790
'She left, leaving my hand'

459
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,740
Mr. Warve, the Shillong police
wants a complete report...

460
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,860
on the famous planter, Sardar Rajpal.

461
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,490
Make enquiries sright away
and give me a report.

462
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,260
- What happened?
- Come quickly. Master is very angry.

463
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,690
Come with me.

464
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,060
- What happened, sir?
- I bought this cow for Rs. 1000.

465
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,040
- Lt was fed poisonous grass.
- Who fed it?

466
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,170
- Who can it be other than Bhola.
- Who is Bhola?

467
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,680
You'll soon know. Let's go!

468
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,890
What are you saying, sir? They are
thousands, and we're only a handful.

469
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,509
Shut-up! It's because of you cowards
that Bhola has become so strong.

470
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,160
Let's go!

471
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,050
Bhola, present yourself!

472
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,379
Don't hide your face
like a coward, Bhola.

473
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,240
If you're brave, come before me.
I've come to talk to you.

474
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,180
I knew you were a coward.
You will never face me.

475
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:01,730
Bhola, stop! He will shoot you.
He will shed your blood.

476
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,540
Move aside, Seema.
The enemy has called me a coward.

477
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,440
I want to see who
the coward is today.

478
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:15,379
I am Bhola.
If I didn't respect your age...

479
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,589
I'd challenge you to a dual.

480
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,160
So tell your dogs to drop
their guns and confront me.

481
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,040
And then watch Bhola's bravery.

482
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,790
I've seen a thousand
examples of your bravery.

483
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,990
Attacking in the middle of
the night is not bravery.

484
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,640
I'll call it that when you come in
broad daylight after notifying me.

485
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,460
Even that desire of yours will
be fulfilled one day, Sardar Rajpal.

486
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,980
The day is not far off
when I'll be carrying that gun.

487
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,129
Then I won't come in the dark
of night, but in broad daylight...

488
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,760
and inform you first.

489
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,530
I'll be waiting.
But until then, understand this.

490
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,569
Hereafter, if you or your men step
on my land, you'll be dead.

491
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,150
Your land? Because you paid
the government a little money...

492
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,940
and got documents
written in your name?

493
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,670
Thousands of such documents cannot
make that land yours, Sardar.

494
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,259
That land is ours.
We've tilled it with our blood.

495
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,410
Go smell its soil. You'll get
the smell of our blood from it.

496
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,880
Father.

497
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,180
You didn't inform me of your
arrival, nor called for a coach.

498
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:50,300
Just don't ask me how I got here.
You know, I met a loafer on the way.

499
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,140
- Loafer?
- Yes. He said he'll come to Ghatpur.

500
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,730
- Let him come, I'll bury him alive.
- Even I desire that.

501
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,150
If I tell you everything,
you'll be shocked.

502
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,080
And if I tell you something,
you'll be even more shocked.

503
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,580
What?

504
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,460
Father!

505
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,150
- Didn't I tell you?
- But father, where is he?

506
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,320
I gave him our farm house
to live in.

507
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:25,460
You don't know how happy I am!

508
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,830
But father, how long will you keep
it a secret that you're his father?

509
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,510
We have to keep it secret,
or he'll leave immediately.

510
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,600
Whether he treats me as his father
or not, but it is enough for me...

511
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:41,970
that my son is with me.

512
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,390
Now I have just one desire.

513
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,470
The day for which I reared you,
that day has arrived, Meena.

514
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,550
I want to see you as a bride.
My Shankar's bride.

515
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,850
She felt embarrassed.

516
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,490
I have seen many beauties...

517
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,670
but not anyone like you

518
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,660
Oh your look, oh your style!

519
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,970
Who would not swoon?

520
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,140
Are they your tresses,
or dark clouds?

521
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,660
Are they your eyes, or lightning?

522
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,390
I wonder who will be slain

523
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,730
I have seen many beauties...

524
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,100
but not anyone like you

525
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,310
- I was saying...
- What time is it?

526
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,620
- It's past 12.
- 12?

527
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,390
Okay, good night.

528
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,420
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- Me too.

529
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,980
- Good night.
- Good night.

530
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,690
This is Sardar Rajpal's bungalow.

531
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,520
- You know him?
- Very few people have seen him.

532
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,550
But I've heard he is a
very cruel man.

533
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:36,130
Wherever I go, I only find
cruel men, not any babes.

534
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,700
Johnny, you get the luggage.
I'll go and check.

535
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,400
I must say the world is round!
Wherever I go, I meet you.

536
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,130
- You're looking for a job, too?
- Wait! I'll teach you a lesson.

537
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,919
Father, father!

538
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,560
Sir, it's a good chance.
Let's escape.

539
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,400
The girl who is so cruel.
Even her father must be a Hitler.

540
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,690
- Who are you?
- I've come to meet Sardar Rajpal.

541
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,930
- That's me. State your business?
- Oh, it's you? Hello.

542
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,750
We've come in response to your ad.
I mean, Johnny and me.

543
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,899
And your friend has
written this letter for you.

544
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,190
- What's your mother's name?
- Kamladevi.

545
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,790
- And yours?
- Shankar.

546
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,620
And your father?

547
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:59,440
Look, if you want to hire me,
take a test of my capability.

548
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,450
Why ask the names of my ancestors?

549
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,900
Why is that necessary?
I won't give my father's name.

550
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,180
Father, he's the loafer who harassed me.

551
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,580
The same words, the same handwriting.

552
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,630
- One of them is an impostor.
- He's the impostor, father.

553
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,990
- But he brought Kamla's letter.
- Father, they can't both be your son.

554
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,990
One of them has been
sent by my enemy, Vishnu.

555
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,760
- We have to find him.
- How?

556
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,120
I'll write to Kamla
for pictures of Shankar.

557
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,390
We'll have to keep them both
here until then. Come.

558
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,899
Listen! What are you doing?

559
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,970
Perhaps you don't need me.

560
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,060
He's pretending.

561
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,530
- Listen son.
- Don't call me son.

562
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,910
Except for my mother,
no one else can call me son.

563
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,420
He knows Shankar hates
his father. The cheat!

564
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,480
Look Shankar, if you leave like that,
my friend will get annoyed with me.

565
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,760
I needed farm hands. I have
appointed one, the other is you.

566
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,960
- And third is me.
- You can leave.

567
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,390
What! Shankar?

568
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,180
- Who is the first man you appointed?
- Even he is from the city.

569
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,470
Coincidentally, his name is Shankar, too.

570
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:38,089
Then you should have worded your ad,
'needed, Shankars'.

571
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:44,420
Shankar, you put your luggage away.
I'll tell you about your job later.

572
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,310
Come dear.

573
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,920
- Get the luggage.
- I'm no servant.

574
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,640
- I'm a respectable man.
- What did you say?

575
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,270
The facts.
You got a job. What do I get?

576
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,710
Come on! You and me are not two.

577
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:06,440
Until you send me Shankar's picture,
I can't discover who the enemy is.

578
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,620
Send Shankar's picture immediately.

579
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,030
This letter is for Shankar.

580
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,470
I informed him about
my going on a pilgrimage.

581
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,100
Mail it off, or he'll be worried.

582
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,910
Don't worry, I'll have it posted.

583
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,680
Let's check your aim.

584
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,490
Bravo!

585
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,180
And you?

586
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,580
Great! You're wonderful.
You seem to be a great marksman.

587
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,379
I haven't counted, but many
have been the target of my bullet.

588
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,910
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I've been in the military.

589
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,180
I'll make soup.

590
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,250
- Come, Meena.
- Yes father.

591
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:34,780
- What's the matter, sir?
- ls this Kamladevi's home?

592
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,590
Yes, but she left
on a pilgrimage today.

593
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,670
- Pilgrimage? Where?
- She didn't tell me that.

594
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,460
She just said she'll
be away for 2-3 months.

595
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,840
Then she'll go to Ghatpur, Assam.

596
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:53,270
- 2-3 months?
- What is the matter?

597
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,880
Nothing. Thank you very much.

598
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:28,540
Say something. He's dumb.

599
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:36,100
Father, come, breakfast is ready.

600
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm not hungry. You eat.

601
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:46,440
What's wrong with you? Since they've
come you've not been eating well.

602
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,310
What's the problem?

603
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,270
You cannot judge my pain.

604
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,980
Just think.
My son has come after 20 years.

605
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,700
But I can neither recognise him,
nor embrace him.

606
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,140
How unfortunate I am.

607
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:17,229
Don't be sad, father.
This secret will be exposed one day.

608
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:26,280
Forget that. Your friends
were going to come today.

609
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:30,740
Yes, they'll come for some time,
then they'll leave.

610
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,000
- Have you arranged a meal for them?
- Yes.

611
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,460
- Come, let's have breakfast.
- You go. I'll come soon.

612
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:51,790
Hear this.

613
01:04:52,280 --> 01:05:02,020
'My heart wished I get
everything I desire'

614
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:07,370
'That I just take two steps
towards my goal'

615
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:11,850
'And see my destination right there'

616
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,100
Wow! Wow!

617
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,060
- Hear another one.
- Yes.

618
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:30,600
'This bunch of stars...'

619
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,150
Sorry for the interruption,
but you're reciting it wrong.

620
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:39,779
It's not bunch of stars,
it's a cluster of stars.

621
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,150
- Who is this brazen man?
- Just wait.

622
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,440
Who are you? Come here.

623
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,330
Hello. I am
Jerumal Aryapremi Lahormal.

624
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:57,410
I'm a born poet.
I live in the neighboring colony.

625
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,650
I was passing by here. Hearing your
wrong recital, I couldn't take it.

626
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,490
- That's why I interrupted.
- He seems to be arrogant.

627
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,460
Wait, I'll teach him a lesson.

628
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,170
- May I leave now?
- Wait.

629
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,390
Mr. Premi, you seem to be
very proud of your poetry.

630
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,100
- I am.
- Will you compete?

631
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:25,250
- What competition?
- Couplet against couplet.

632
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:31,210
- But I compose romantic poetry.
- As do I.

633
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:37,060
That's nice. But my
poetry needs accompanied music.

634
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:42,400
If these beautiful faces dance before
my eyes, my poetry can break records.

635
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:47,600
Very well, there will
be music, and also dance.

636
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,820
- Begin.
- No, you start first.

637
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:53,610
Really?

638
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,910
I've come a long way to meet you

639
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,779
Don't stay silent, say something

640
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,460
ls it day or night?

641
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:46,120
Why treat me as a guest?

642
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:51,380
Millions of beauties hover around me

643
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,490
I'm unmatched!

644
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:00,150
I've come a long way to meet you

645
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:05,040
Don't stay silent, say something

646
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,259
ls it day or night?

647
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:34,110
Get up and see what
lovely sights there are here

648
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,060
Stop feeling shy.
Why act like that?

649
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:53,870
What did you say?
I was feeling shy just like that

650
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:01,339
I'm unmatched!

651
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:07,370
I've come a long way to meet you

652
01:09:07,529 --> 01:09:12,179
Don't stay silent, say something

653
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,390
ls it day or night?

654
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:39,809
I come across such sights everyday

655
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:44,340
Dark tresses on the face

656
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:59,510
Let someone cast a spell on you.
Then I'll question you

657
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,960
Whether it is day or night

658
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,430
Why treat me as a guest?

659
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:17,610
Millions of beauties hover around me

660
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,040
I'm unmatched!

661
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:26,190
I've come a long way to meet you

662
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:31,060
Don't stay silent, say something

663
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,389
ls it day or night?

664
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,190
Why treat me as a guest?

665
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,350
Millions of beauties hover around me

666
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,780
I'm unmatched!

667
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,030
You were great, Mr. Premi.

668
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,650
Mr. Premi, you really were good.

669
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,220
It's your appreciation,
or I'm not that good.

670
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,400
Good bye.

671
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,340
- Who is he?
- A brazen fellow.

672
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,230
Let's go.

673
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,380
When I got your letter,
Kamla had left on a pilgrimage.

674
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,269
I think our plan has gone haywire.

675
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,889
Come back as soon as
you get my letter.

676
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,420
If you do a job for me,
I'll load you with money.

677
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,639
Tell me.

678
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,610
A lady named Kamla is going
to come from the city in a few days.

679
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,470
She has to be stopped
from meeting Sardar Rajpal.

680
01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,260
That's no big deal.
I'll put two men on the job.

681
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,730
The moment she arrives,
she'll be finished.

682
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,570
You're a useful man. Take.

683
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,320
Go to the post office every day
from today.

684
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,410
I should get every letter
addressed to Shankar.

685
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,860
Rest assured.

686
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,350
I want to talk to you.

687
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:25,250
- What's the matter?
- I want a few days leave.

688
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,019
- Leave?
- Yes. I got my mother's letter.

689
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:31,630
She left alone on a pilgrimage. I'm
very worried. I want to bring her back.

690
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,210
- Show me the letter.
- Look.

691
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,769
If she's coming here after the pilgrimage,
why do you have to go?

692
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,660
- But I...
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.

693
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,030
This is my mother's letter.
I recognize my mother's handwriting.

694
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,110
- Give me that letter.
- Why?

695
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,900
That's not your letter, it's mine.
I know my mother's handwriting.

696
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,580
So what are you saying? I don't
recognize my mother's handwriting?

697
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,320
- Give me the letter.
- No.

698
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:55,370
What a stupid man you are. You're
saying my mother's letter is yours.

699
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,940
- What are you up to?
- Damn that!

700
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:02,389
Get this clear, mister. This is your
first mistake, which I'm forgiving.

701
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:06,920
Next time you touch my mother's
letter, I'll break your hands.

702
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:13,059
Break my hands indeed!

703
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,269
For a minute I was sure
he was my son.

704
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:33,750
But this letter, both were
ready to die for it.

705
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,520
- I don't know what to do.
- I have an idea.

706
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:42,280
We must search their quarters.
We'll surely find something there.

707
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,400
Shankar, you came at the right time.
This girl was stealing grass.

708
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,700
When I caught her,
she attacked me with a sickle.

709
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,880
Girl, it's pointless fighting now.
You'll be punished for stealing.

710
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:15,080
- We'll hand you over to the police.
- Why hand her over to the police?

711
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:19,380
We can punish her for this crime.
Girl, get up.

712
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,800
Take, take!

713
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,389
Turn, turn!

714
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,750
Take this, run, run!

715
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,850
Shankar, I won't allow this.

716
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:06,669
Don't try to stop her, understand?

717
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,190
Run away, girl!

718
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:15,080
It's not so easy to stop me. Move
aside! Hey girl, stop, or I'll shoot.

719
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:21,140
Let the girl go,
or I'll blow your brains out.

720
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,160
Run away girl.
He won't harm you.

721
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,340
- What does that mean? She was stealing.
- She's been punished for it.

722
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,660
Shankar, you're supporting the enemies.
The consequences won't be good.

723
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:42,590
- I'm not afraid of threats.
- That will be decided tomorrow.

724
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,300
Wasn't I good?

725
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:50,889
Perhaps you don't know
the gun wasn't loaded.

726
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:54,740
What's surprising is that he
not only helped the girl steal...

727
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,340
but when I tried to catch her,
he aimed the gun at me.

728
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,940
Don't worry,
I'll question him right now.

729
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:19,220
Answer. Why did you fight with him
and let that tribal girl go?

730
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,530
Because she already had more
punishment than she deserved.

731
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,850
- Who punished her?
- My friend, Mr. Shankar.

732
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,320
What punishment?

733
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:35,849
- Shall I tell him?
- Yes, tell him. What can you say?

734
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:41,390
Only that I had heard that lust
turns a man into an animal.

735
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,110
I witnessed it myself last night.

736
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,860
If taking the law into your
hands wasn't a crime...

737
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,940
I'd make your hot blood go so cold,
you'd remember it all your life.

738
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:56,910
You did try your best, when you had
turned from a human to a fiend...

739
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:01,860
and when I tried to catch your lover,
you aimed your gun at me.

740
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:09,140
Great! Heard that, Johnny? How foolish
he is, is obvious from his face.

741
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:15,240
Sir, if you want the proof of truth,
I can bring that tribal girl to you.

742
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:18,139
I have other ways to learn the truth.

743
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,390
Let's go, Meena.

744
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,510
And what's worse is that
he put all the blame on me.

745
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,630
You have to come with me
to Sardar Rajpal and give proof.

746
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:34,940
I can' go there. Bhola won't let me go.

747
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:38,390
- I'll come and tell Bhola.
- Don't ever make that mistake.

748
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:42,300
If you step on our land,
our people will kill you.

749
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:45,410
- Why?
- Because you're Sardar Rajpal's man.

750
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,960
- Your madam is coming.
- Madam?

751
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:59,380
Seema, will you do me a favor?
Will you love me?

752
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:04,840
Only for a while, just as a pretense,
to make someone jealous.

753
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,350
Yes.

754
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,600
- Has she come?
- Yes.

755
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,440
- What's she doing?
- She's watching.

756
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,929
- ls she jealous?
- Yes.

757
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,520
- ls she dying?
- She is.

758
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,759
- What's she doing now?
- Watching secretly.

759
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,490
Oh hiding woman, appear

760
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,860
Don't torment me
by hiding like that

761
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,960
Rays from the sun,
wind from the cloud...

762
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,370
how long can they hide, tell me?

763
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:20,500
Oh hiding woman, appear

764
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:43,050
If this is not defeat of your
attitude, what is it?

765
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:52,019
If coming running to me is
not love, what is it?

766
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,310
Why are you standing
surprised far away?

767
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,530
Don't bite your finger

768
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,240
Oh hiding woman, appear

769
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,530
Don't torment me
by hiding like that

770
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,700
Rays from the sun,
wind from the cloud...

771
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,019
how long can they hide, tell me?

772
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:23,179
Oh hiding woman, appear

773
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:45,780
Your flying tresses cling
to my heart

774
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:54,710
I see your eyes meeting mine

775
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,940
Don't drop your hair on your cheeks

776
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,130
You are a beauty, I am handsome

777
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,809
Oh hiding woman, appear

778
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,050
Don't torment me
by hiding like that

779
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,180
Rays from the sun,
wind from the cloud...

780
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:20,450
how long can they hide, tell me?

781
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:37,990
Oh hiding woman, appear

782
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,150
- Father.
- What is it?

783
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,750
I found this letter
written by Kamladevi.

784
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:47,269
She has perhaps
left on a pilgrimage.

785
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:51,760
That means until she returns,
I won't learn who is my son.

786
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:55,620
I know who he is,
but you're not ready to believe.

787
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,650
Maybe you're right,
but I want proof.

788
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:05,390
Just let me get proof.
Then watch what I do to the impostor.

789
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:03,330
- Who is he? Who is he?
- How do I know?

790
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:13,300
Until now, despite your coldness,
your hatred, I respected you.

791
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,719
But not any more.

792
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,760
Who asked you to come here and search
my room? Who do you think I am?

793
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,480
A thief, bandit?

794
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:22,610
You know very well.

795
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:26,140
If it was a man in your place,...

796
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,950
I'd teach him a lesson
he'd remember all his life.

797
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:32,040
You came for this? Take it away!

798
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,530
I wonder whose picture it is.
I've never seen or met him.

799
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,890
If you don't know about this picture,
how did it get in your suitcase?

800
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:45,800
How do I know where it came from?
And if it did, what's the crime?

801
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:48,130
Even you have that much sense.

802
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,940
If I have to steal,
I'll steal something precious.

803
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:52,889
Not a sick picture.

804
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,500
Go and tell your father...

805
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,310
I don't give a damn for a job
where I'm suspected of being a thief.

806
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,060
I'm waiting for my mom.
I'll leave as soon as she comes.

807
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,260
If you care for your
daughter's life...

808
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:27,350
either send Rs. 10000 to Bhola
before sunrise tomorrow...

809
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,710
or send that rascal,
whose name is Shankar...

810
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:32,860
who tried to molest Bhola's
fiancée, Seema.

811
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:39,420
If you don't do either of the two, you'll
not even see your daughter's dead face.

812
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,930
Get out of here, you rascal!
And go and tell Bhola...

813
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:54,660
I'll burn down his entire
colony by tomorrow morning.

814
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:57,960
I'll take revenge of one Meena,
with thousands of lives.

815
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:08,260
Bhola has said that if you attack us,
your daughter will be killed.

816
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:09,790
- You scoundrel!
- Sir!

817
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:28,180
Don't think money is
more dear to me than Meena's life.

818
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,530
Rs. 10000 isn't a big amount for me.
But it will be a humiliation.

819
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:37,800
Sir, you don't have to give money.
Bhola wants to take revenge from me.

820
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,890
- I'm ready to go there.
- No, he won't spare you.

821
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:47,860
Saving my master's daughter's life,
even if I lose my life I don't mind.

822
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:51,530
No, that's not possible.

823
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:54,250
- There's no other option.
- I'll think of an option

824
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,880
Come with me.

825
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,379
But why did Bhola do this?
What does he want?

826
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,090
His man brought a message today...

827
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,260
saying if I didn't pay him Rs. 10000
by tomorrow morning...

828
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,660
or if I don't send that rascal,
who tried to molest Seema...

829
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,839
Meena won't come back.

830
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,990
So what have you decided?

831
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,830
Will you send money or the
Shankar who misbehaved with Seema?

832
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,040
- Not money, not Shankar.
- We're going to take Meena.

833
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,339
Then even if we
have to lose our lives.

834
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:25,769
Let's go!

835
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,980
Shankar, listen!

836
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,890
They're informing Bhola of our arrival.

837
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:03,370
- March forward!
- No sir.

838
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:05,770
Marching forward will be pushing
them towards death.

839
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,940
Even if we kill a few with our guns,
Meena won't survive.

840
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:17,070
Sir, it is wise that we accept defeat.

841
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:20,610
I'll reclaim every penny
of the Rs. 10000 from Bhola.

842
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,410
Ganesh, tell Bhola
I'm ready to pay the money.

843
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,630
Wait! There is no
need to say anything.

844
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:37,430
- I'll bring Meena.
- Shankar! Where are you going?

845
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,830
They'll kill you.

846
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:46,710
Shankar, stop!
Why are you moving towards death?

847
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:32,580
I have come to meet Bhola.
Where is your Chief?

848
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,790
What do you want?
Bhola is standing before you.

849
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,920
I've come to take Sardar Rajpal's
daughter, Meena.

850
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:45,540
- Have you brought the money?
- No.

851
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:49,219
- Name?
- Shankar.

852
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:07,300
- What are you doing! Put away the axe.
- Move aside! I'll kill him!

853
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,550
But he isn't who you think.

854
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,900
He's a different Shankar.
He's the one who saved me that night.

855
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,880
- He's our friend.
- Friend?

856
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,720
Yes.

857
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,100
- Can you trust his friendship?
- Yes.

858
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,440
- Pardon me. We are friends from today.
- So can I take Meena with me?

859
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:31,349
No. Sardar Rajpal's man
misbehaved with my fiancée.

860
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,310
Until I take revenge,
Meena won't go anywhere.

861
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,240
ls this how you repay a favor?

862
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,670
I staked my life and saved
your fiancee's honor...

863
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,730
and this is how you show gratitude?
By capturing my fiancée?

864
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:47,870
- Your fiancée?
- Of course.

865
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,710
She is Sardar Rajpal's daughter,
but she is my fiancée...

866
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,280
my future wife.

867
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,650
- So you're her would be husband?
- Yes, husband.

868
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,460
You cannot confine his fiancée.

869
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,040
He's our friend.

870
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,200
Friend, I never ignore what Seema
says. You may take your fiancee.

871
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,490
She's your fiancée.

872
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:46,760
- Okay Bhola, we're leaving.
- Not yet.

873
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,250
No?

874
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,540
We're getting married today.

875
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,640
And any friend leaving before the
occasion is considered inauspicious.

876
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,970
You'll take your beloved
only after our marriage now.

877
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,220
After marriage?

878
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,780
- And that too,
carrying her in your arms. - Ln arms?

879
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:11,010
Johnny, go to Sardar Rajpal and tell
him we'll come after the marriage.

880
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,170
Had you not been there today,
I'd probably not survive.

881
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,680
But why did you do this?
What if I hadn't reached in time?

882
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:47,790
- Bhola would have killed me?
- Killed you indeed!

883
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,710
You didn't give a thought to
what Meena would suffer.

884
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,930
She wouldn't shed a tear
over my death.

885
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:56,330
What are you saying!

886
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,900
Seema, I treat you like my sister.
I cannot lie to you.

887
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:06,070
Meena is neither my fiancée,
nor my future wife.

888
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:11,060
The truth is, she thinks
I'm a thief, a bandit.

889
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,849
- Bandit?
- She came to search my room.

890
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:18,600
She didn't find anything else,
just one picture.

891
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:22,410
I don't know whose picture it is,
or how it reached my trunk.

892
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:26,340
- And then?
- Then...

893
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:31,599
the bonds my heart had made
broke forever.

894
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,450
Anyway, forget all that.

895
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,950
This gift is for you from your
brother on your wedding.

896
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:00,900
Hey, what are you doing!
Bhola said don't put me down on the way...

897
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:02,900
or the Gods will get angry.

898
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:15,830
At least walk with me,
or they'll kidnap me again.

899
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,160
Let them.
I won't come to take you again.

900
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,630
Promise?

901
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:26,210
Very angry?

902
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,490
If I didn't care for your father,
I'd never come to take you ever.

903
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,050
Promise?

904
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:44,099
'Oh heart breaker,
watch where you're going'

905
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:48,720
'Even I am lying in your way'

906
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:52,010
Great! You're thinking of a new
plan to show me down.

907
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,970
- Oh, the misunderstanding!
- I'm not foolish, madam.

908
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,030
Innocent faces don't deceive me.

909
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,420
Promise?

910
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:02,709
- Hold my hand.
- No.

911
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:05,500
- Then I'm not coming.
- Don't come.

912
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,349
Wild animals will devour me here.

913
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,910
They aren't so foolish.
They get fresh meat here.

914
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:47,420
Meena, what happened? Open your
eyes. Where did the snake bite you?

915
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,880
I belong to you, Meena.
Please open your eyes for God's sake.

916
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,460
Meena, my Meena, open your eyes.

917
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:04,060
- I'll do everything you say.
- Promise?

918
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:35,559
Look, I swear, I am telling you

919
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:39,809
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

920
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:09,770
The night is young,
the atmosphere alluring

921
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:18,000
The moonlight romantic,
the winds chilly

922
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:26,690
I am alone, you are alone,
I am telling you

923
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,730
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

924
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:35,600
Look, I swear, I am telling you

925
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:39,880
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

926
01:39:56,890 --> 01:40:00,880
Go if you want to.
Even I am leaving

927
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,320
Whether you come or not,
I won't regret it

928
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:17,640
I am alone, you are alone,
I am telling you

929
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:21,610
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

930
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:26,420
Look, I swear, I am telling you

931
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:30,590
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

932
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:52,150
Why do you keep swearing?

933
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:00,200
I have stopped, now tell me

934
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,120
Don't walk with attitude,
don't walk with pride, I'm telling you

935
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:13,640
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

936
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:18,099
Look, I swear, I am telling you

937
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:22,280
Even you will feel jealous,
regret being annoyed with me

938
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,339
- Master has come.
- Who? Daddy?

939
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,080
- Yes, your father.
- Where is he?

940
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,059
Ln your cottage.
He's waiting for you. Come now.

941
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:53,750
How long will you
play this dangerous game?

942
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,290
Gopal will come to know one day.

943
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,910
Then...

944
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:03,670
No Sohan, I cannot leave
you here even for a minute.

945
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:06,900
There's still time.
I can inform the police.

946
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:10,530
My brother's killer will
be on the gallows.

947
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:15,790
- What you want will happen.
- Then come. I've brought a coach.

948
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:21,000
Not now, give me two more days.
Then watch what happens.

949
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:25,389
- What will happen?
- What you want.

950
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,980
Sardar Rajpal will be on the gallows.

951
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:41,160
- Father!
- Meena, my child!

952
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:47,700
Bravo son. I'll always remember
your bravery of today.

953
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:52,060
- What reward do you want?
- I don't need a reward, sir.

954
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:54,550
I already have my reward.

955
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:07,950
Meena, I feel he is my Shankar.
He is my son.

956
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:14,709
- What do you think?
- The same as you think.

957
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:22,390
Earlier, I did doubt it,
but now I'm sure he's your son.

958
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:29,799
Whenever I look at him,
I feel overwhelmed with love for him.

959
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:36,590
- I hope he is my son.
- God willing, that's what it will be.

960
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:43,370
- That's what it will be.
- You're crying?

961
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,210
Father.

962
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:48,930
Your tears reveal your
heart's feelings, Meena.

963
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:52,179
You have fallen in love with him?

964
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:58,370
That's not right, dear.
Who knows? He may not be my son.

965
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:04,780
No father, he's definitely your son.
I have complete faith.

966
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:07,059
I can't make my decisions
on your faith.

967
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:11,900
Remember, if he's not my son,
I won't care for your feelings.

968
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:15,210
Along with my enemy,
I will even throttle your love.

969
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:23,070
From the CID report we know...

970
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,000
that Sardar Rajpal came
from Shillong 20 years ago.

971
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:30,990
He lives here with his adopted
daughter. He doesn't mix with anybody.

972
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:35,670
Lt seems he is hiding some secret
from his past from the people...

973
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,500
which may perhaps ruin his life.

974
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:41,870
We're keeping watch on him
and are awaiting your orders.

975
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:51,030
Coming.

976
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:33,390
Shankar, you haven't told me
anything about yourself.

977
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,440
What's there to tell?

978
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:42,120
The usual about your family,
your siblings, your parents.

979
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:44,820
I just have a mother,
nobody else.

980
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,780
And father?

981
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:52,719
Forget this subject.
Talk about something else.

982
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:56,360
No, I want to know everything.

983
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:04,040
I must know all about your past.

984
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:10,920
So before making any decision about
me, you want to know about my family...

985
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,240
and my position.

986
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:16,630
- It's not that, Shankar.
- Lt is so.

987
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:24,589
Hear who I am. I'm the son
of a gambler and a murderer.

988
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:32,330
I can hide it from the world,
but not from you.

989
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:37,040
I share the blood of a gambler,
a murderer, a fugitive from the law.

990
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:43,809
Shankar, you don't know
how happy I am today. How happy!

991
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,140
You mean you don't
feel sad learning all this?

992
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,969
No Shankar, I love bad people.

993
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,500
You mean, I'm bad?

994
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:07,990
A red cap on the head,
a silk handkerchief in your hand

995
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,430
Oh, I have no words for you

996
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,630
Your fair cheeks,
and ruffled tresses on them

997
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:27,259
Oh, I have no words for you

998
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:06,420
My heart, oh my darling,
where are you stealing and going

999
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,970
Lost in a high

1000
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:27,850
To steal your heart, I neither have
the daring, nor the right age

1001
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,430
Your alluring gait,
like a drooping branch

1002
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:43,140
Oh, I have no words for you

1003
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:56,600
A red cap on the head,
a silk handkerchief in your hand

1004
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:59,170
Oh, I have no words for you

1005
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:26,760
Why do you hold your heart?

1006
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:32,080
What is it? Tell me too

1007
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:48,610
What do I tell you
from such a distance?

1008
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,760
Come close to me

1009
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:03,610
Your charming gait dazzles everyone

1010
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:06,070
Oh, I have no words for you

1011
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,690
Your fair cheeks,
and ruffled tresses on them

1012
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:22,090
Oh, I have no words for you

1013
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:52,580
I had the desire to
at least become a flower...

1014
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,730
and kiss your tresses

1015
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:13,550
My only desire is that I take
your name and go on a high

1016
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:25,820
Your alluring gait,
like a drooping branch

1017
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:28,660
Oh, I have no words for you

1018
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:41,889
A red cap on the head,
a silk handkerchief in your hand

1019
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:44,269
Oh, I have no words for you

1020
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:49,820
Your fair cheeks,
and ruffled tresses on them

1021
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:52,450
Oh, I have no words for you.

1022
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:47,310
- Who?
- I don't know, sir.

1023
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:51,790
- But he's sitting in Shankar's cottage.
- Which Shankar?

1024
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,780
The one who had got Meena
released from Bhola's custody.

1025
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,990
I became suspicious because
he slipped away on seeing me.

1026
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:02,340
- How old is he?
- About your age, sir.

1027
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:04,880
And he also limps, sir.

1028
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:10,190
Limps?

1029
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:15,980
Look sir.

1030
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:06,690
Dear Sohan, don't worry on not
finding me here when you return.

1031
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,520
Because a man here has seen me.

1032
01:55:09,930 --> 01:55:12,380
My staying here is risky.

1033
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:19,309
The plan we have made is perfect.
Kill my brother's killer tonight.

1034
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:23,759
I'll come and get you tomorrow.
Your father, Vishnu.

1035
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:01,580
What happened?

1036
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:05,040
- Tell me something.
- What?

1037
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:10,160
- I belong to you, Shankar.
- Then why fear?

1038
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:20,200
If you aren't who I think you are...
Make me believe what I am assuming.

1039
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:32,360
I am who your heart says I am.

1040
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:35,889
I'm the one who your heart loves.

1041
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:41,889
- Father! What are you doing!
- Move aside!

1042
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:15,469
Ganesh, take away the rascal
and put him in the dungeon.

1043
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:19,380
If he escapes, I'll kill you.

1044
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:25,760
Quick!

1045
01:57:45,110 --> 01:57:48,110
Let him go. He's innocent.

1046
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:50,580
If you knew that,
there'd be no problem.

1047
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:48,650
Meena, I had a dream.

1048
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:51,370
Like someone is whipping me.

1049
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:59,259
But how did I bleed?

1050
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:03,460
An innocent man's blood talks, father.

1051
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:07,349
God is taking revenge
of an innocent man from you.

1052
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,340
You are calling a sinner
and a rascal, innocent?

1053
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:17,710
Yes, he is innocent.
And the proof of it is this blood...

1054
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:21,220
which has bled from your heart
and reached your lips.

1055
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:25,380
What is wrong with you, Meena?
He is after my blood.

1056
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:31,540
If that were true,
you'd be sleeping peacefully.

1057
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,560
Your body wouldn't get flogged.

1058
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:42,599
Shankar's torment wouldn't torment you.

1059
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:46,830
Your love can mislead you, not me.

1060
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,610
I've seen Vishnu in his cottage
with my own eyes.

1061
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:52,040
Couldn't the other Shankar
have brought Vishnu there?

1062
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:55,110
Ganesh brought me the news.

1063
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,820
How much money does it take
to buy off Ganesh?

1064
02:00:57,850 --> 02:01:00,660
And this letter, which states
the conspiracy of my murder?

1065
02:01:02,190 --> 02:01:05,320
Nothing in the world
can prove otherwise...

1066
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:08,970
because it is written on him
that he's your son.

1067
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:15,350
See this blood. Lt is the same
which you shed with your whip.

1068
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:17,710
- Your own blood.
- Meena!

1069
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:21,820
Shedding his son's blood,
a father can never sleep peacefully.

1070
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,650
This is only the first night.
Hereafter, every night you'll be whipped.

1071
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:37,090
Even your mouth will bleed
like Shankar's.

1072
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,740
You go and keep a watch on
the other Shankar's cottage

1073
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:11,900
As soon as I play the mouth organ,
know that Shankar has been released.

1074
02:04:41,170 --> 02:04:42,900
It'll just be a few days, daddy.

1075
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:46,980
Then this land will belong to us.
The tea estates will belong to us.

1076
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,700
All of the wealth Gopal has
earned will be ours.

1077
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:54,870
I don't want wealth, I want the
blood of my brother's murderer.

1078
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:00,260
Even that day isn't far. The gallows rope
is almost around Gopal's neck.

1079
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:09,160
Everything has an appropriate time, daddy.

1080
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:13,480
And one has to wait until
the right time comes.

1081
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:18,350
- And as soon as the time comes...
- Leave me!

1082
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:24,970
You rascal! Let me go.
Shankar will kill you!

1083
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,340
- Sir, we have a problem.
- What happened?

1084
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,280
Bhola released
Shankar and took him away.

1085
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:39,219
What! He released Shankar?

1086
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:45,269
There's no time to think now, Sohan.
We can't continue this act any longer.

1087
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:50,599
Before Gopal comes to know and
escapes, we must inform the police.

1088
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:52,760
You want to lose a won battle?

1089
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:55,260
The decision will go
in my favor tomorrow.

1090
02:05:55,670 --> 02:05:57,660
And you want me
to escape like a coward?

1091
02:05:57,740 --> 02:06:00,330
- It's the path of ruin.
- Maybe your ruin, not mine!

1092
02:06:01,070 --> 02:06:03,950
- Ganesh, you have to do a job.
- Tell me.

1093
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:07,740
Go to Sardar Rajpal tomorrow,
and tell him...

1094
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:15,190
- When did this happen?
- This morning.

1095
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:20,099
Meena came with Bhola and his men
and released Shankar and left.

1096
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:26,209
That means that rascal will
go and inform his father, Vishnu.

1097
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:32,940
And then the police.
Ganesh, where is Shankar?

1098
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:35,780
- He must be in his cottage.
- Go send him here quickly.

1099
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:50,460
Foolish girl,
I don't rue that you cheated me.

1100
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:56,130
What I regret is that you will
suffer with him.

1101
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:02,710
But why did you leave Meena there?
Why didn't you bring her along?

1102
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,540
I wonder what she must be suffering.

1103
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:08,700
That fiend must be
punishing her because of me.

1104
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,730
- Where are you going?
- To bring Meena.

1105
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:16,490
And settle scores with Sardar Rajpal.

1106
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:18,980
Let's go.

1107
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:31,870
Where is sir?

1108
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:42,780
When you get my letter,
I will have gone very far from you.

1109
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:49,360
I kept this a secret from
you until today. I am your father.

1110
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:56,750
I am accused of murder.
I am going to atone for it.

1111
02:07:57,590 --> 02:08:00,040
My enemy has learned I'm here.

1112
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:06,090
Before the police come to know,
I'm going to surrender myself to them.

1113
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:09,090
This house and
the entire estate is yours.

1114
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:13,940
Ganesh, we have succeeded.
All this property is mine!

1115
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:17,380
I am your boss from today,
Sardar Sohan!

1116
02:08:17,730 --> 02:08:20,019
And I am your slave.

1117
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:22,690
Go and bring my daddy and Meena here.

1118
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:28,770
I want to celebrate today,
in praise of Sardar Rajpal!

1119
02:08:28,850 --> 02:08:31,630
These ads appeared
in the newspaper last month.

1120
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:38,020
From the police report, it's obvious
that Sardar Rajpal is fugitive Gopal...

1121
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:40,200
who the police have been looking for.

1122
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:44,490
He had changed his name and
appearance, and thought...

1123
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,830
he could deceive the law.

1124
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:50,530
But the sharp eyes of the
police finally found him.

1125
02:08:51,410 --> 02:08:55,620
Here's his arrest warrant.
Leave immediately.

1126
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:59,280
Take the help of the local police
and arrest him immediately.

1127
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:30,020
Madam, you take rest here for some
time while I give water to the horse.

1128
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,170
Kamla, my wife?

1129
02:10:10,190 --> 02:10:12,269
Your coming with me isn't proper, Bhola.

1130
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:15,970
Your life could be at risk.
There's still time. Go back.

1131
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:20,750
Bhola is not a coward, friend. I have
spent all my life playing with death.

1132
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:27,349
Bhola, look there!
That's my mother!

1133
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:50,750
- Mother!
- Child!

1134
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:05,570
Look mom, my friend and the chief
here, Bhola, has come to welcome you.

1135
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:12,019
- Coachman! How are you?
- Hello sir.

1136
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:14,230
Hello.

1137
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:18,900
What happened to you?
How did you hurt your head?

1138
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:22,510
That's my earnings.
The reward for my hard work.

1139
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:25,910
What are you saying!
Who beat you?

1140
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,260
The one you sent me to for a job.

1141
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:35,259
How is that possible?
How did you harm him?

1142
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:39,300
I don't know mom,
but I surely will one day.

1143
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:42,849
And that day, instead of him,
the whip will be in my hand.

1144
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:46,230
That day has come, Shankar.
Take this whip.

1145
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:50,090
Fulfill your desire. Shed my blood.

1146
02:11:50,710 --> 02:11:55,510
Wound me. If I so much as complain,
you can spit in my face.

1147
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:58,260
Take it, Bhola.

1148
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:01,480
Your act cannot impress me, Rajpal.

1149
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:08,420
I will take revenge. I surely will!
Of the injustice done to me.

1150
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:11,220
I will kill you!

1151
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:18,920
Stop Shankar!
Or a son may beat his father.

1152
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:25,480
- Mom, what are you saying?
- Yes, he is your father.

1153
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:30,280
The father who you hate,
but yet you are his son.

1154
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:32,170
His blood runs in your veins.

1155
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:35,950
Even if a father kills his son,
the mother spares him.

1156
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:41,750
But the day a son beats his father,
she curses the day she sired such a son.

1157
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,280
Where are you going?

1158
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:06,610
You'll remember mom, I told you...

1159
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:10,510
the day you find your husband, you'll
have to choose between him and your son.

1160
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:17,570
I know what your decision is.
So I am leaving you before you make it.

1161
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:25,870
So that you aren't blamed
for your decision.

1162
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:31,540
Shankar, stop my son!

1163
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,120
I know I've been very unfair to you.

1164
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:41,019
But remember, if your body was
wounded, my heart was.

1165
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:44,900
If your body has bled,
my heart has.

1166
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:47,920
If your body has suffered pain,
my soul has.

1167
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:50,700
And destiny is to be blamed for it.

1168
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:58,040
What can be more unfortunate that a
father humiliate and throw out his son...

1169
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:03,790
and hand over his entire wealth to his
enemy's son, assuming him to be his son.

1170
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:06,440
- What are you saying?
- I'm speaking the truth, Kamla.

1171
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:11,170
Vishnu and Sohan laid
this trap and looted me.

1172
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:16,970
But my game isn't over yet.
I have yet to strike.

1173
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:23,760
Husband! Where are you going?
You are alone, they are so many.

1174
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:27,940
I have always fought my life's
battles alone. I have no one.

1175
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:53,250
I'm asking you for the last time.
Are you coming to the city or not?

1176
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:56,950
You're too much, father.
What's the hurry?

1177
02:14:57,730 --> 02:15:01,250
We succeeded with great difficulty.
Don't you want me to enjoy my success?

1178
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,840
Enjoy as much as you want in the
city. Staying back here is risky.

1179
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:09,469
What risk? You're such a sissy.

1180
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,820
Oh my God!

1181
02:15:17,590 --> 02:15:19,720
Sardar Rajpal! Get the guns!

1182
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:29,110
Where are you running? The game isn't
over yet. Play the final round.

1183
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:06,360
Son...

1184
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:19,620
Shankar will come here soon.
Let's go!

1185
02:16:27,530 --> 02:16:34,279
Leave me, you rascal!

1186
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:40,150
- Come!
- Leave me!

1187
02:17:08,450 --> 02:17:17,410
Look, your father
has paid for his crimes.

1188
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:21,638
- At least forgive him now.
- Dad.

1189
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:31,449
I don't regret even dying now.
I found my Shankar.

1190
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,260
Husband!

1191
02:17:43,558 --> 02:17:45,179
Don't worry about me.

1192
02:17:48,468 --> 02:17:51,079
My life is over.

1193
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:58,120
Go and save Meena. That rascal
took her in his car and escaped.

1194
02:17:58,549 --> 02:18:00,660
- Ln a car?
- Don't worry, Sardar Rajpal.

1195
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:03,029
Bhola will stake his life
and bring Meena back.

1196
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:04,990
Let's go, friend.

1197
02:18:12,270 --> 02:18:17,300
Forgive me Kamla,
I wasn't worthy of you.

1198
02:18:24,350 --> 02:18:28,380
The man you are looking for is me.

1199
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:34,820
Go clear the road.

1200
02:19:39,090 --> 02:19:40,840
- Stay here!
- Leave me!

1201
02:22:35,950 --> 02:22:38,280
If you move even two steps ahead,
I'll throw the girl in the gorge.

1202
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:42,570
If you care for Meena's life,
leave here now.

1203
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:48,120
It's not so easy to
win against me, Shankar.

1204
02:22:48,860 --> 02:22:51,190
I'll die, but take along
your beloved too.

1205
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:54,570
Don't move forward!

1206
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:40,080
Though I have seen many beauties

1207
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,470
But not anyone like you
