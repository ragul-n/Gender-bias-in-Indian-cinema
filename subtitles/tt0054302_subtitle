1
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:08,286
Here. Anything else I can do for you?

2
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:12,161
No thank you. How much for this?
- Rs. 2. 25p.

3
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:16,559
But the store opposite
quoted a price of Rs. 2. 7 5p.

4
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,639
Everyone has his own way
of doing business.

5
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:24,638
I am happy with an honest living.

6
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:28,641
Whatever we may say, everyone
else calls him a God's devotee.

7
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,157
Not God's devotee, he is a fraud.

8
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,563
He wants to uproot us and
establish himself in the market.

9
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:37,957
He even sells goods cheaper
to attract customers.

10
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,639
That's what I fear.

11
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:47,642
Take a gun and keep firing until
the enemy doesn't leave the world.

12
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:52,165
What do you say?
- Have you thought of its consequences?

13
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:56,559
I have.
You will never be garlanded.

14
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,161
That only leaves the noose.

15
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:03,166
Even I will pray to God
that you die peacefully.

16
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,556
I am your partner after all.

17
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,564
Rehmat, since you are my partner, . . .

18
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:09,638
even you will have to
go to the gallows with me.

19
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:14,159
You two have started fighting?
Think of what we must do.

20
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,159
I have thought of a plan.
Just watch what I do.

21
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,164
Even I have a family like you all.

22
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,159
Father!
- What is it? Why are you shouting?

23
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,761
I am going to school.
- Then go, who's stopping you?

24
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:25,876
Give me 25p.

25
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:30,921
For getting beaten? Beat him back
and come and I'll give you a rupee.

26
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,157
Alright father,
I'll surely take revenge.

27
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:36,643
You will? Then here's a rupee.

28
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,156
I'll give you a rupee more
after you have taken the revenge.

29
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:40,395
Okay father.

30
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,636
Vijay, why are you late?

31
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,556
How did you get hurt?

32
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,159
It's the reward
for speaking the truth.

33
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:56,637
What? Come here.
- I am speaking the truth.

34
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:01,039
Kishore was copying in class.
The teacher asked me.

35
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,645
I had to tell him the truth.

36
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:07,159
So I got beaten after class
and hurt myself.

37
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,875
Softly father, it hurts.

38
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,635
One has to pay
the price of truth, son.

39
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:22,638
But this a price too high.
I'm in pain.

40
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:27,642
I hope this pain grows
and your heart bleeds for the world.

41
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,161
May you see your happiness
in others happiness.

42
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,562
And share everyone's sorrow.

43
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,044
I understand everything, Mohanlal.

44
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:39,637
You say something,
and do something else.

45
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,044
Good values you have
imbibed in your child.

46
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:46,159
What is the matter, brother Lalchand?
- Don't call me brother.

47
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,044
You are just a smooth talker.

48
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,637
Just see what your son
has done to my child.

49
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:57,640
Brother, elders must not interfere
in the fights of children.

50
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,157
They are an image of God.

51
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,161
They will fight today,
and make-up tomorrow.

52
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,885
Oh great, Mr. Goody!

53
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,637
Instead of advising your son,
you are advising me?

54
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,044
It's the first time,
so I am tolerating it.

55
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,044
If this happens again,
I'll break his bones!

56
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:19,558
Calm down please.
- I am a very bad man, get that?

57
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,637
Good neighbours we have.
They have made our lives miserable.

58
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,162
Father, it hurts.
- Shut-up, idiot!

59
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:32,037
You have wasted all my money.
Did I feed you and make you strong . . .

60
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,885
so that you get beaten by this rat?
Come!

61
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:56,159
You are out of danger now.
- I am not afraid of death, Kailash.

62
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:02,164
Mohan, I am not telling you this as
a doctor, but also as a friend.

63
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,158
You must take care of your health.

64
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:07,159
This time, you need total bed rest
for three weeks.

65
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:12,638
Come Vijay.
- What happened to daddy, Doctor?

66
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,156
Nothing son.
- Nothing at all, silly.

67
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:20,162
I am just a little sick.
- Vijay, take care of your daddy.

68
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,158
And come and take
medicine from my dispensary.

69
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,636
Okay.
- Mohan, I'll be going.

70
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:31,162
How are you feeling now?
- Why are you so upset?

71
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:37,039
I am fine. Oh yes, the sparrows
are hungry since morning.

72
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,158
Give them some grains. Go.

73
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,400
What happened?
- Nothing.

74
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,046
Show me your hand.

75
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:51,640
Who beat you?
How did you get these marks?

76
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,160
They are marks of truth, father.
- What are you trying to say?

77
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:59,637
The inspector was going to visit our
school. I kept a chair ready for him.

78
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,161
Kishore kept a broken
chair in its place.

79
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,159
The inspector fell down
the moment he sat on it.

80
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,638
Kishore and his
friends put the blame on me.

81
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,635
And then,
what had to happen, happened.

82
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,044
You get beaten today, son.

83
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,637
But tomorrow, this very
truth will bring you peace.

84
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,162
The world will surely bow
before you one day.

85
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:25,957
I have no desire that
the world bow before me.

86
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,635
I only need your blessings.

87
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:33,158
Father was not telling you, but me.
- It's the same thing.

88
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:36,637
Father, I'll change and come.
- I'd gone to buy vegetables.

89
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,886
I came to know that
you have taken ill.

90
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,566
I came running to see you.

91
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,559
In a hurry, I even forgot
to collect money.

92
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,640
How are you feeling now?
- My time is nearing.

93
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:52,159
I am living the
few days I am left with.

94
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,157
I'll take your leave.

95
00:09:55,167 --> 00:10:00,161
If your condition worsens,
do call for me.

96
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:02,636
Don't forget, you have my promise.

97
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,035
Father, I'll get milk
and medicines for you.

98
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,557
The weather is bad, son.
Come back soon.

99
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:31,638
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

100
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,159
The shop is locked.
Knock the door of his residence.

101
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,236
Yes sir.

102
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,636
I'm coming, son.

103
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:53,636
Inspector. . .

104
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,156
Inspector. . .

105
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,886
Tell me, what brings you here?

106
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:11,639
Considering your decency and age,
I feel embarrassed to say this.

107
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,044
But I am compelled by law.

108
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,638
Does the law have any complaints
against me, inspector?

109
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,637
Mohanlal, some people have filed a
complaint against you, that . . .

110
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,159
Tell me what complaints
people have against me.

111
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,159
I don't want any kind of leniency.

112
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,637
All are equal in the eyes of law.

113
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:36,160
Then whether rich or poor,
father or son.

114
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:40,161
We have information that
you deal in drugs.

115
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,160
Drugs! !
What are you talking, inspector?

116
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:49,637
Even I don't believe it. But the
matter is now in the hands of law.

117
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,644
Truth has nothing to
fear, inspector.

118
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:56,160
You can search my home and shop.
Come.

119
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,160
Come.

120
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,156
Constables, search.

121
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,160
Mohanlal, sit down.

122
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:33,165
Sir, the drugs are here.
- No! That's not possible.

123
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,886
This is not true, inspector.

124
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:41,639
Someone has done this to defame me.
Believe me, I am innocent, inspector.

125
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,635
I am helpless, Mr. Mohanlal.
The evidence says something else.

126
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,639
I will have to arrest you.

127
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,636
The people who respect me so much . . .

128
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,637
I will pass through their
street as a criminal?

129
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,164
God, this is punishment for what. . .

130
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,638
Father!

131
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,158
Father!

132
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,635
Don't cry so much, son.

133
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,156
Uncle!

134
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:23,638
Gather yourself, son.
Wipe away your tears.

135
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,638
Every man has to
endure sorrow and troubles.

136
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:33,163
I miss my father, uncle.
How will I live without him?

137
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,159
One doesn't have parents forever.

138
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,635
Your crying will hurt his soul.

139
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:48,163
If you stay happy, concentrate on your
studies, make something of yourself. . .

140
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,638
his soul will rest in peace.

141
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,635
Will my not crying please father?

142
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,635
Yes son, very much.

143
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,156
Very much.

144
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:05,159
Come Vijay, you will
live with me from now on.

145
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,158
I have come to take you.

146
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,635
How can I leave this home, uncle?

147
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:18,639
Staying here, I feel
father is with me.

148
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,885
That's okay, son.

149
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:27,638
But if you live with me,
I will be able to look after you well.

150
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,158
You will come with me, won't you?

151
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:36,160
If you love your Doctor uncle,
you surely will come.

152
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:45,643
Tell me, son.
- Uncle. . . my sweet uncle.

153
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,156
Vijay.

154
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,159
Yes Doctor uncle.

155
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,159
You have grown so old,
but still behave like a child.

156
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,043
I have grown old?
What nonsense!

157
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,045
When I grow old, I will have a long
beard, my eye sight will become weak.

158
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,637
And I will walk with a bent head like
you and say, ' Vijay,get me my glasses'

159
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,158
Naughty! You sure are a smooth talker.

160
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:37,162
But uncle,in Bsc ( Bachelor of Science )
they teach you to make compounds.

161
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:42,037
Is that so?
Then run and get 5 kgs of sweets.

162
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,637
What have compounds got
to do with sweets?

163
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,641
First get the sweets,
then I'll tell you.

164
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,158
But what's the great news?

165
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,160
An engagement.
- Whose?

166
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:59,639
You think I will get
engaged at this age?

167
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:03,557
This is the 20th century uncle,
who knows when one falters.

168
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,878
Even 100 year old men
nowadays wish to get married.

169
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,561
You don't brighten up an old ruin.

170
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,886
Brightness looks good in new homes.

171
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,635
That is why, I am getting you engaged.

172
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,638
Why are you feeling shy now,
Mr.Vijay Kumar, Bsc?

173
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:30,160
Vijay Kumar, Bsc?
- Yes, Vijay Kumar, Bsc.

174
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,637
Here's your friend's telegram.

175
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:40,159
Uncle, I have passed !

176
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,158
I am very happy today, Doctor uncle.

177
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,637
The day I had been waiting for
since years, has arrived.

178
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,158
I am very grateful to you.

179
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:57,162
Whatever I have done,
I have done it as my duty.

180
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,158
Does anyone do favours
to his children?

181
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,646
What is the matter, son?

182
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:12,159
Nothing.
I was just reminded of father.

183
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:22,638
Vijay, come here.
You have to get ready to go to Bombay.

184
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,637
I had written to Champalal about you.
He has replied back

185
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,040
But how will he recognise me?

186
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,158
I'll write a letter for him.
He will recognise you.

187
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:35,159
Go pack your bags.
- Yes.

188
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,638
''The weather is beautiful,
the atmosphere lovely''

189
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,635
''The company is great,
everything around is young''

190
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,162
''The winds are acting naughty''

191
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,162
''The heart sings slowly softly''

192
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:24,877
''Hear the humming of oars
in the swaying waters''

193
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,555
''The weather is beautiful,
I am young''

194
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:28,636
''What a combination ! ''

195
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:35,162
''When a beauty laughed,
a string of pearls broke''

196
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:38,637
''God, she's so beautiful ! ''

197
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:44,638
''Wherever they look,
they spread joy''

198
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,635
''The weather is beautiful . . . ''

199
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,044
''I have not seen
such buildings anywhere''

200
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,158
''They make the sky kiss the earth''

201
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,637
''What do you say, aren't they unique?''

202
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:31,040
''With hopes in my eyes. . . ''

203
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,158
''destination beckons me''

204
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:36,916
''The waiting is terrible''

205
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,160
''Is this land I see, a dream?''

206
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,885
''The world is great''

207
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,638
''The weather is beautiful . . . ''

208
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,637
God save us from the girls of today.

209
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,635
Hey mister!
Who are you, and how did you come in?

210
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:52,160
On my feet.
- Then turn back and leave.

211
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:54,044
No one is interested in birds here.

212
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,646
People just walk in. Leave!

213
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,555
You are a gardener, but throw orders
like you are the mistress of the house.

214
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,636
Gardener?

215
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,555
Oh no, you are the
mistress of this house.

216
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:06,035
Go in and inform your master
Vijay Kumar, Bsc, has arrived.

217
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,156
What do you want?

218
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,636
Should I say everything here, or
leave some conversation for indoors?

219
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,158
I have come here to stay.
- Stay?

220
00:24:12,647 --> 00:24:16,639
Yes, to stay.
- With Mr. Champalal?

221
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,158
What is the matter?
- God save you from him.

222
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:23,637
He is very hot headed. He raises
his hand on every small thing.

223
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:29,559
A man has left on a stretcher
two hours ago.

224
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,045
Stretcher?
- Yes.

225
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,555
But Doctor uncle didn't
tell me anything like that.

226
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:35,159
He must have forgotten.

227
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:41,038
And his daughter. . .
- His daughter? What's her problem?

228
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:45,638
Her father is so stingy,
he doesn't even appoint servants.

229
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,644
He makes her do all the work.

230
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:51,157
And where I am concerned,
he even gives me limited food.

231
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:54,878
I am wondering what you will eat.

232
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,043
Does one even feel
hungry in such circumstances?

233
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,635
One does have to fill his stomach.

234
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:06,162
I'm stuck. I can't even
leave without meeting him.

235
00:25:06,647 --> 00:25:08,159
Why don't you go in and tell him.

236
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:12,160
I won't go. There's the door,
go announce yourself.

237
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,646
Go.
- I should go?

238
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:15,956
Yes, go.

239
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:07,638
Who are you? Who let you in?

240
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,158
Your gardener.
- Gardener?

241
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,158
I have brought this letter for you.

242
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:30,639
You are Vijay? Mohanlal's son !
Welcome!

243
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:36,035
How is Doctor?
- He's fine.

244
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,156
Sit down.

245
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:43,639
Where are you going, Bimla?
- I'm taking tea for master.

246
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,156
Come with me.

247
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:50,163
You were so little when I saw you.
- You have seen me?

248
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,636
Yes. Even I am from your city.

249
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,158
I came to Bombay in
connection with business. . .

250
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:56,636
and settled down here.

251
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:00,637
Anyway, why didn't you
inform me before coming?

252
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,646
I would have got you
picked from the station.

253
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:03,756
I didn't get a chance.

254
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:06,162
My results were out
and uncle threw me out of there.

255
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,646
You seem to be an interesting man.

256
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,158
Had any problem reaching here?
- Not at all.

257
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,159
I roamed around, taking in the
sights and reached very comfortably.

258
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:20,398
Hello. Let me take that.
- What are you doing !

259
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:23,160
You are not feeling well.
Why did you bring the tea?

260
00:28:23,247 --> 00:28:25,636
You should have called me.
Why did you bother?

261
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,159
Sit down.

262
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:32,636
She is very shy.

263
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,158
Now I understand.

264
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,636
She is not my daughter,
she is a servant.

265
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,156
This is my daughter Geeta.

266
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:50,160
Geeta, he is Vijay
who you fooled as soon as he came.

267
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,875
He will live with us.

268
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,646
Yes sir?
- Come here.

269
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,635
Where is your luggage?
- It's kept outside.

270
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:04,165
Keshav, pick his luggage and
take him to the room upstairs.

271
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:06,886
And ensure his stay his comfortable.

272
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,555
Go and take rest, Vijay.
We'll meet in the evening.

273
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:24,045
Geeta, Lalchand must be waiting
for me in office. I am leaving.

274
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,646
You get ready and come over.

275
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:39,641
Hello.
- Hello. I've been waiting for you.

276
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:44,638
I can see that. Liked the picture?

277
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,158
I appreciate your choice.

278
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,637
Sit down. . .Tell me,
what brings you here?

279
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,885
Have you brought some new scheme?

280
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:00,158
It's a scheme you'll
be pleased to hear about.

281
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,158
God willing,
we'll benefit tremendously.

282
00:30:06,247 --> 00:30:07,885
Come Geeta.

283
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:14,639
Whose good are you talking about?
- My own for now.

284
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,639
Later, I'll even do good for you.

285
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:22,160
Lalchand is talking about a scheme.
Tell me about it.

286
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:27,163
Champalal, you are aware I sell
medicines since childhood.

287
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:31,559
You perhaps don't know that
it is more profitable . . .

288
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:34,160
to manufacture medicines
then sell them.

289
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:38,160
I am planning to start a
factory for manufacturing medicines.

290
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:42,162
And anyway, our country has more
sick men than a healthy population.

291
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:46,559
Your talk is very interesting, uncle.
- Even I think so.

292
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:50,162
Then why think? Join hands
with me and become my partner

293
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,637
Your partner?
- Yes, what's the harm?

294
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:59,876
I want to share my profits. Instead
of some stranger earning them . . .

295
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,635
it is better you do.

296
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:09,639
I'm not in a hurry. Read my prospectus
and decide after due thought.

297
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,637
I'm not in a hurry.
- Uncle, you only think of your benefit

298
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,646
Talk about our benefit too.

299
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:20,162
You will think your uncle
is very selfish.

300
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:24,638
but what is beneficial to you
will also benefit me.

301
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,156
What are you talking about?

302
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:31,560
Champalal, I may not be of your
status, but we are decent people.

303
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,877
Do you agree to that?
- No doubt.

304
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:37,044
You know my son, Kishore.
- Very well.

305
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:42,160
And you know he is very enterprising.
Why don't we get our children married?

306
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:45,637
So that even we become
grandparents before we die.

307
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,557
You have made me realise for the
first time that Geeta has grown up.

308
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,158
I always considered her to be a kid.

309
00:31:55,247 --> 00:32:01,880
However big children may grow,
but parents always see them as kids.

310
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:05,239
But you cannot change the norms
of nature.

311
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:09,639
A plant grows with every season,
a girl, every day.

312
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,644
You are right.
- Then it's fixed. Shake hands to that.

313
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,637
Uncle, such things take time.

314
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,635
She's also right. What's the hurry?

315
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,043
The two should be given a chance
to understand each other.

316
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:28,638
I'm not in a hurry. I'll do one thing.
I'll send Kishore here tomorrow.

317
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,557
He will learn the job, and they'll
even get to know one another.

318
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,638
You do that.
- I'll take your leave now.

319
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:44,639
For a few days, you will
find life in Bombay strange.

320
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,158
I have experienced some of it already.

321
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:49,158
You'll experience the rest too.

322
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,637
Yes sure. That is why I
have come from so far to you.

323
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:59,158
Vijay, I own an advertising firm.

324
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:03,161
Your talks give me the feeling
you will be right for the job.

325
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,236
Whatever you deem fit.

326
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:08,639
Do one thing. Go and meet the
accounts executive there tomorrow.

327
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:11,556
Two spoons sugar.

328
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:15,638
I am sure she'll do something for you.

329
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,877
I don't interfere in her work.

330
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,637
She does what she likes.
If you impress her . . .

331
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,635
you'll surely have the job.
- I'll try.

332
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,636
Praising you is like . . .

333
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,639
Praising you is like
telling the sun it's bright.

334
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,645
You are very intelligent.

335
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,643
You saw my face and knew I'm
going to become an officer?

336
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,158
Excuse me ;
I am preparing for my interview.

337
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:33,159
How did you come here?

338
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,645
Where you are going to
become an officer . . .

339
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,165
I have come looking
for a small job there.

340
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:38,235
Is it?

341
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:42,639
Mr.Vijay has been called in.
- But I came here first.

342
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,634
Maybe officers are interviewed later.

343
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:51,636
I am an officer!

344
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,636
Hello.

345
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:50,160
I am setting my first step
in a new phase of life.

346
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:55,163
I desired since very long to work
with a capable person like you.

347
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:02,160
Praising a person on such a big post
is like telling the sun it's bright.

348
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:03,759
If I have blessings of elders
like you, . . .

349
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,639
even I will make something
of myself one day.

350
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,645
Are you listening?

351
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:18,167
You misunderstand me.
Trust me, I will work hard.

352
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:22,160
I will do a year's work in months,
a month's work in hours . . .

353
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,636
And an hours work in minutes.
- You ! Here?

354
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,634
I mean, are you the senior
accounts executive in this office?

355
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,158
Why? Can't I be?

356
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:37,160
A gardener, then mistress, and
now officer? I don't understand.

357
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:40,558
You don't understand?
- Remove your glasses.

358
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:43,161
What?
- Remove your glasses and sit down.

359
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:48,557
Why didn't you tell me before?
I thought I'll find some old man here.

360
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,638
My entire night's effort went waste.

361
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,634
Convincing women is a moment's job.

362
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:59,160
Sometimes it takes your whole life
to convince or understand women.

363
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:04,160
Even that's possible.
By the way, what about my job?

364
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:10,638
You are being kept on probation.
Go and sit in the accounts room.

365
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:14,559
And listen. A Mr. Kishore
is sitting outside. Send him in.

366
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:15,636
Yes madam.

367
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,156
Sit down.

368
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:05,638
I will first tell you
what is the benefit of advertising.

369
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:11,161
The way a child runs
on seeing a lovely toy. . .

370
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,236
likewise . . .

371
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:18,845
Likewise, advertising a product
makes customers run towards it.

372
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,045
You must be aware that
in an advertisement . . .

373
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,636
the merits of a product
are always exaggerated.

374
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,556
If the product is no good,
should we lie?

375
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:35,163
Why just advertisement? You cannot
do without it even in everyday life.

376
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:37,044
Maybe, but I don't agree.

377
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,158
Wait a minute. Listen to me.
- Tell me.

378
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:46,560
Why do women wear latest fashions?

379
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:53,562
Why do they apply
kohl, lipstick, powder?

380
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,558
That is what I want to ask boss.

381
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,884
I don't tolerate brazenness.

382
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,634
If this is how you will behave,
you will never progress.

383
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:06,638
Bring a layout of any product
you want tomorrow.

384
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,158
You can leave now.

385
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:20,560
Father! Where are you?
- You look very happy.

386
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,161
Have you fixed your marriage?

387
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:26,877
Look where you are going,
or you may trip and fall.

388
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:30,159
Correct uncle, but the path is clear.

389
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:34,160
It was a great day today. Even you'll
be pleased when you hear about it.

390
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,158
What happened?
- Ask what didn't happen !

391
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,639
I stepped into the office . . .

392
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,158
and everyone bowed before me.

393
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:48,640
They praised my capability.
- Bravo! You are my nephew after all.

394
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:53,642
Your father has spent Rs. 20000
on your education.

395
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,634
But even Vijay is working with me.
- Who Vijay?

396
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,158
The late Mohanlal's son?
- Correct.

397
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,887
When did he come?
- Only a few days ago.

398
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:08,159
But advertising is not his cup of tea.

399
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,040
She reprimanded him
the first day itself.

400
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,158
She told him he's a nincompoop.

401
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,158
You are calling your old uncle
a nincompoop?

402
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,158
It would be better if he had
died before you were born.

403
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:25,160
Why do you interfere in everything
without knowing anything about it?

404
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:29,638
This is too much ! How was I
to know you like being abused?

405
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,158
Take as much abuse as you like.

406
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:36,159
He wasn't abusing me,
but Mohanlal's son's Vijay.

407
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:40,035
Oh, is it?
. . . Mohanlal? Who Mohanlal?

408
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,875
You forget your friends very easily.

409
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:47,557
The Mohanlal on whose death
you had cried your eyes out.

410
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:50,639
I'll cry my eyes out even
when you die.

411
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:55,399
But what I don't understand ; couldn't
he get a job in some other city?

412
00:40:55,647 --> 00:41:01,167
I don't know all that,
but he is working with me . . .

413
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,159
and he is staying with Mr. Champalal.
- He is staying with Champalal?

414
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:06,159
But how did he come here?
Did that doctor die?

415
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:12,879
You are arguing like lawyers.
Let's have a game of chess.

416
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:18,639
Damn your chess! I am
thinking of something else now.

417
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,156
Hello.

418
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,156
Sit down.

419
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:35,639
So? How was your day?
- The way you wanted it.

420
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:40,557
So your interview with the accounts
executive was quite interesting.

421
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,875
Yes, very.
- Have you started working?

422
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:50,159
I have learnt something today.
I'll know the rest on the day of exam.

423
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,159
I want to ask you something.
- Yes, sure.

424
00:41:57,407 --> 00:42:01,639
Is it necessary to exaggerate the
quality of a product in advertising?

425
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,878
Can't we speak the truth
and do its publicity?

426
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:10,640
We can, but a little
exaggeration is necessary. . .

427
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:12,165
or it will become
difficult to sell products.

428
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:13,236
But I don't understand . . .

429
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,636
Wait, you'll understand.

430
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:24,638
Look at these pictures carefully
and tell me what's special about them.

431
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,636
What are you looking at?
- It's the publicity of a bicycle.

432
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,158
Yes, but what's special about it?

433
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:45,160
Special? It's a beautiful
and strong bicycle.

434
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,640
Where are you from?
- The same city you are from.

435
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:52,879
Though you will get fools
in every city.

436
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,044
Mister, the bicycle is not beautiful.

437
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,159
The beautiful girl riding it
makes it beautiful.

438
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:01,557
Yes Vijay, Geeta is right.
- I don't understand.

439
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:05,162
If you want to buy a bicycle, will
you look at the bicycle or the girl?

440
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:07,557
How many years did it take
you to get your degree?

441
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,160
What?
- Remove your glasses.

442
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:12,156
16 years.

443
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:15,636
And you want to know
about advertising in one day?

444
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:27,160
Yesterday, I asked you to
bring a layout of any product.

445
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:29,645
Have you brought it?
- Yes.

446
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:34,636
This is the advertisement of
baby syrup. Have a look.

447
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:39,045
What's this? A muscleman in
an advert of baby syrup.

448
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:41,637
Put the picture of a baby there.

449
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:47,558
Mr.Vijay?
- It's ready.

450
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,884
What connection does
a girl have with a razor?

451
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:01,558
You want to advertise a razor, right?
Then why this girl. . .

452
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:03,160
But you only said last night . . .

453
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:06,557
the picture of a girl is necessary
with the publicity of any product.

454
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,161
So with this safety razor . . .
- Use your brains.

455
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,556
I'm sorry. It takes 16 years
to get a degree.

456
00:44:12,647 --> 00:44:15,558
How can I learn advertising in a day?
- Shut-up!

457
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:19,162
We only have to get started.
All the arrangements have been made.

458
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,159
I have given invitations
to the guests.

459
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:24,044
I have even
fixed the inauguration date.

460
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,556
Let some big personality
do the inauguration.

461
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,158
I have arranged that too.
- Who are you inviting?

462
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:32,158
Who else but you.
- Me?

463
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,645
No, invite someone else.

464
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:40,640
I can invite many big personalities,
but not a sympathizer like you.

465
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:46,161
You are two in one. You are a big
personality, and my sympathizer too.

466
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,634
As you wish.
- That's better.

467
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:53,159
Here, sign this.

468
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:59,636
Rest assured, I have made the
documents the way you wanted them.

469
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,159
I'll take your leave.

470
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,156
Shall I leave?

471
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:20,160
What an idiot I am!
I forgot the most important thing.

472
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:25,640
Give me a small cheque. You know
one needs money for everything now.

473
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:30,158
One cannot do anything without money.
- How much money do you want?

474
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:34,155
Give me Rs. 50000.
If I need more, I'll ask for it.

475
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:40,046
Use the money stringently.
- Don't worry.

476
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:45,639
I know very well where and how
money and brains have to be used.

477
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:51,160
I am thinking, why should I bother
you every time? Make that Rs. 100000.

478
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,159
Take only this much now.
- Okay.

479
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:22,639
These green valleys. These beautiful
clouds kissing the mountains.

480
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:27,040
I feel like sleeping here.

481
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,636
Not correct. These sights are
nothing compared to your beauty.

482
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,162
The world ticks with your presence.

483
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:36,636
No, the world ticks with us.

484
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,634
Mister, it is us women
who bring joy to this world.

485
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,156
What will you men do
without us women?

486
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:46,162
And without us men,
what will you women do?

487
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:48,638
What can you do without us?

488
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:53,636
Nothing. . . nothing at all.

489
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,158
''Shall I say something?''

490
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,160
''I'm all for beauty''

491
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,634
''Whenever they are mentioned,
my heart skips a beat''

492
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,165
''What do you think?''

493
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,044
''It's you who knows our worth''

494
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,158
''You have an eye''

495
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,044
''It's good to have a mate like you''

496
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:53,645
''What a wonderful thing you've said''

497
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:56,878
''You two deserve each other''

498
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,884
''How did you find him?''

499
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,560
''Without love, what is life?
What do you think?''

500
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,158
''If there were
no beauties in the world''

501
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:28,638
''Even we would be nowhere''

502
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,044
''Your attitude comes with us''

503
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:33,158
''What would you do without us?''

504
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:37,878
''We tolerate your attitude''

505
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:40,158
''We appease you''

506
00:48:40,247 --> 00:48:44,160
''Without love, what is life?
What do you think?''

507
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,634
''It's with beauty,
that there is colour in life''

508
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,638
''That's how you live''

509
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:12,558
''It is at your hands that
these poor men are harried''

510
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,638
''Your piercing eyes''

511
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,158
''It is your presence
that keeps our hearts young''

512
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,875
''Without love, what is life?
What do you think?''

513
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:39,638
''We make men's hearts beat''

514
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:44,642
''You make our hearts mushy''

515
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:48,641
''I don't go for looks, my heart
looks for a beautiful heart''

516
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:55,639
''I have a habit of speaking the
truth, I am an honest man''

517
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:00,160
''Without love, what is life?
What do you think?''

518
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,645
The car won't start.

519
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,638
Something wrong with the car.

520
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:33,398
Men make the world tick?
- No doubt about it.

521
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,159
Then push.
- What?

522
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:37,158
Get down and give the car a push.

523
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:40,637
I'll have to do that too?
- Yes!

524
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,156
Okay.

525
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:54,158
Listen. Come out.
- Why?

526
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,236
Come out.

527
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:03,638
Look, I was wrong.
It's women who make the world tick.

528
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:06,634
Realized your mistake?
- Yes. Now you push the car.

529
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,557
I'll push the car, you wear bangles.
- Wish my hands were soft like yours.

530
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:18,162
You may not get bangles his size,
but you will get bangles my size.

531
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:22,160
You sit in the car, I'll push.
- Come in.

532
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,156
Good. . . harder.

533
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,156
Good. . . harder.

534
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,637
Push harder. Don't you eat food?

535
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:19,877
Hey. . . hey stop!
You left me behind?

536
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:26,640
I understand everything, I am not a
kid. I'll go &amp; tell dad. Daddy!

537
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,156
Check.

538
00:52:34,407 --> 00:52:37,160
Check.

539
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:44,560
Partner, you are in trouble.
Your knight is gone.

540
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:46,160
How could I do that!

541
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:51,639
What are you waiting for?
Go open the door.

542
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:55,557
You gave the servants a holiday,
you open the door.

543
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,634
You consider me a fool?

544
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,162
I'll go to open the door so you
can move the pawns behind me?

545
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:05,155
Even you can do the same.

546
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:06,884
You are right.

547
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:11,046
Do you know when
the milk is not in danger?

548
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,158
When there is no dog near the milk.

549
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:15,638
Or if there are two
fighting dogs facing each other.

550
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,042
You are calling me a dog again?
- Why are you taking offence?

551
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,634
I am even calling myself a dog.

552
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:25,160
We'll do one thing. We'll both go.
So that no one can touch the game.

553
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:26,241
Come.

554
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,964
If it's some guest,
you'll have to make the tea.

555
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,645
I'll do that, don't worry.

556
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,645
Open the door.

557
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:45,159
Are you alright?
Look at your state.

558
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:50,160
Who beat you up?

559
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:01,638
Say something !
- It's all Vijay's doing.

560
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:02,756
What do you mean?

561
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:05,156
He, Geeta and I
had gone for a drive.

562
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:08,158
The car broke down. I pushed
the car and it started.

563
00:54:08,247 --> 00:54:09,566
And he drove away.

564
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,639
You donkey!
Who asked you to push the car?

565
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:17,165
Why didn't you ask Vijay to do it?
- I was trying to please Geeta.

566
00:54:17,647 --> 00:54:19,638
Then you should have made
Geeta get off the car.

567
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:22,156
The idiot would not have
drove off without her.

568
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:26,639
He is giving you ideas of his youth.
That's what he used to do.

569
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,634
Uncle! Excuse me.

570
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:36,636
Don't you feel ashamed?
You tell my son about my youth?

571
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,162
So what?
Can't you see even he's young?

572
00:54:39,287 --> 00:54:42,165
You don't know what I fear.

573
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:47,641
If Vijay manages to woo the girl,
this poor guy will commit suicide.

574
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:52,877
Damn you ! There is no dearth of
girls for a handsome boy like him.

575
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:56,636
I can get as many girls
for her as you want.

576
00:54:57,167 --> 00:55:02,639
But all girls are not alike.

577
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:06,880
Even I have seen many girls.
There is no difference between girls.

578
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:10,636
Though how much money
they are worth . . .

579
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:14,636
Keep barking.
- What did you say? Bark?

580
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,158
Vijay here. I have read the matter.

581
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:40,636
You have exaggerated a lot about
the powder. Write the caption again.

582
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,636
No, I cannot defer from truth.
Just do what I am telling you.

583
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,156
And fast.

584
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:55,161
Whatever Mr. Champalal has earned,
you will ruin it all in a year.

585
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:59,045
If I do that, what will you do?
- What?

586
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:00,156
Yes.
- Is that so?

587
00:56:00,247 --> 00:56:01,884
What is the matter?

588
00:56:03,647 --> 00:56:05,638
We were discussing the
favours you have done us.

589
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:10,046
Listen. A party has been organized to
celebrate the opening . . .

590
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:11,156
If our new company.

591
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:14,557
Wonderful idea !
Whatever you do is great!

592
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:19,163
It was dad's idea.
- Dad's idea? Yet, it's not bad.

593
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,636
You have to be there in time.
- I'll have to.

594
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:26,645
They are the boss' orders.

595
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:35,162
' Watch youthfulness
going into a frenzy tonight'

596
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:39,636
' When I dance,
my beloved will be with me'

597
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:43,636
' On my shoulders will be her tresses'

598
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,164
' And her delicate waist in my arms'

599
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:51,636
' It is jugglers who
go for such monkey faces'

600
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:54,156
' Take a small drum along
if you have one'

601
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:59,636
' Neither will you have that waist,
those tresses, nor the beloved'

602
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:03,636
' You will be somewhere else,
she will be in my arms'

603
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,645
You ruined my mood.

604
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,634
Wow! It looks like a
swan is hopping.

605
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,557
Won't you'll dance?
- I'm waiting for your signal.

606
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:53,160
I'm ready to go to the
dance floor.

607
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:55,158
Uncle.
- What happened?

608
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:59,159
My nephew is a great dancer.

609
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:03,641
He got a call 10 days ago from
England inviting him to dance.

610
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:09,636
But I stopped him from going fearing
his father may die behind his back.

611
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:14,037
Uncle, are all the arrangements okay?
- Yes, everything is perfect.

612
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:18,160
Won't you dance?
- I am not interested.

613
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:22,159
What do the small towners
know what society life is.

614
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:02,160
You didn't like dancing, did you?

615
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:06,638
When two hearts unite,
then you enjoy the dancing.

616
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:59,643
''O heart,
I have seen many cruel hearts''

617
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:06,161
''When I found my destination,
everything changed''

618
01:03:40,407 --> 01:03:45,162
''How strange the world is''

619
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:58,163
''It calls a stone a diamond''

620
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:04,046
''But an honest man is never defeated''

621
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,634
''This star of
the earth always shines''

622
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,634
''Mark my words''

623
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:24,161
''O heart,
I have seen many cruel hearts . . . ''

624
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:56,638
''See with your heart's eyes,
recognise your dear ones''

625
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:09,638
''Forget about others,
recognise yourself''

626
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:17,638
''Learn to steal a heart,
learn to come in someone's dreams''

627
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:20,637
''Learn to bring others close to you''

628
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:35,638
''O heart,
I have seen many cruel hearts . . . ''

629
01:06:09,647 --> 01:06:14,641
Has anyone ever eaten with a fork and
spoon in your entire family?

630
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:21,560
What do you know
what my family has done.

631
01:06:21,647 --> 01:06:26,163
I know everything. You had once
greeted your father in English . . .

632
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:29,636
and he gave you five slaps.

633
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:35,639
Mind your tongue or I will
say things about your family too.

634
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:39,167
I care a damn.

635
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:40,156
Father!

636
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:46,160
You are destined to keep tripping.

637
01:06:46,247 --> 01:06:48,636
The boy has grown up,
don't abuse him.

638
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:53,636
Sit down. Why do you look so sullen?

639
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:58,640
' It is the brave
who fall in a battle'

640
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:02,159
' The weak-knees cannot even
put up a fight'

641
01:07:02,247 --> 01:07:06,638
Rehmat uncle, I am warning. . .
- Why are you threatening him?

642
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:12,036
He is right. I spent thousands of
rupees to teach you to dance. . .

643
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:13,156
only so that you face defeat?

644
01:07:13,247 --> 01:07:16,044
If you had to face defeat,
you shouldn't have learnt dancing.

645
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:19,159
I am not at fault. My shoes were
new, I tripped and fell down.

646
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:24,636
Who asked you to dance in your shoes?

647
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:26,639
Couldn't you have danced bare foot?

648
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:31,634
Why are you after the boy?

649
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:35,636
Was it classical dance
that he would dance bare foot?

650
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:41,161
You don't understand English culture.
- And as if you do.

651
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:44,158
Eat with a fork and spoon.
- What are. . .

652
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:47,044
Uncle, keep quiet.
You dropped the water.

653
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:50,159
Father, why do you worry?
I have just lost one round.

654
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:54,160
There are still many innings to go.
I'll win them and show you.

655
01:07:54,567 --> 01:08:00,164
Son, winning a race doesn't just
depend on the horse, but the jockey too

656
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:07,640
Whenever you run, imagine I am
your jockey. You'll never lose.

657
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:14,036
Ram Bharose, I don't like this
English food. Get something spicy.

658
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,635
Father, start eating idli and dosas.

659
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:22,560
Thanks to you,
I may have to eat sawdust.

660
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,156
Correct indeed.

661
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,885
What type of dance were you
dancing last night?

662
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:59,164
The type you were. But I don't
know why I was nervous last night.

663
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:04,037
Or I am an expert at classical
and folk dance . . .

664
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:06,158
Ofcourse! I believe you.

665
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:11,046
Geeta, if you give
me one more chance, . . .

666
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:15,160
I'll show you steps,
even you'll start dancing.

667
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:16,646
That I was even last night.

668
01:09:21,886 --> 01:09:26,642
What about that radio programme
of Madhumalti company?

669
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,159
That will be done today.
- You and Vijay finalize it.

670
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:32,158
Correct, but . . .
- You may go.

671
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:47,639
Mr.Vijay, I have prepared a one minute
jingle for Madhumalti company.

672
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:51,159
If it's not too much of a bother,
hear it.

673
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,646
How can I ignore your orders?

674
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:04,639
' Ask O fortunate ones,
for a bottle or tin'

675
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:11,637
' Baag balm! It's magical'

676
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,159
' Ask O fortunate ones,
for a bottle or tin'

677
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,637
' If a blind man applies it,
he gains sight'

678
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:28,159
' Whether a pauper or king,
everyone uses it'

679
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,639
' A dumb man uses it,
he starts singing'

680
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:45,159
' Apply it to a bald pate
and grow anything you like'

681
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:51,639
' Ask O fortunate ones,
for a bottle or tin'

682
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,159
' Baag balm! It's magical'

683
01:11:01,407 --> 01:11:02,396
Stop it!

684
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,158
What do you think?

685
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:08,158
Hearing this, will the
people buy the balm?

686
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,646
Why not?

687
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:15,558
She's such a beautiful girl, I mean,
she has such a melodious voice.

688
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:22,160
Such a good tune.
- Thank you.

689
01:11:22,247 --> 01:11:26,035
And when this tune reaches
the people's ears every time . . .

690
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,156
they will love it.

691
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,646
Let's have it once more.

692
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:36,635
Whoever hears such a voice
will throw out his radio.

693
01:11:37,887 --> 01:11:39,161
Then what will you play?
Classical music?

694
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:42,045
You do everything the wrong way.
Doesn't matter.

695
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,158
I'll let the lady boss hear it.
- Sure.

696
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:50,156
Let's go.

697
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:22,159
Peon ! . . . . Get me a towel.

698
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:25,161
Soaked in cold water.

699
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:36,159
What do you think?
- I didn't like it much.

700
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:37,236
It sounds cheap.

701
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:43,646
We have made this
hit tune in seven days.

702
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:48,158
No one is praising our effort.

703
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:50,636
Vijay didn't like it,
even you don't like it.

704
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,635
What did Vijay say?
- That it's sick.

705
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:58,160
That if such a jingle is aired
on radio, he will throw out the radio.

706
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:02,646
So Vijay said that?

707
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:16,637
I have begun to like your jingle.

708
01:13:22,647 --> 01:13:25,639
I will change Vijay's
dislike to my liking.

709
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:37,556
Ask him.

710
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:40,635
Didn't like the
jingle made by Kishore?

711
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,156
No.

712
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:49,156
But I like it.

713
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,646
Each has his own taste.

714
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,646
You all leave.

715
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,635
You are the senior accounts executive,
you can do as you please.

716
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:14,161
Daddy and I are going on a picnic.
You two also come along.

717
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:16,636
Where are we going?
- You'll know that when we reach there.

718
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,156
Yes.

719
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:08,639
I am reading.
- I am listening to a song.

720
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:12,637
Go somewhere far and hear it.
- Go far and read.

721
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:19,162
Sorry, I cannot go.
- I'll take you.

722
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,158
Where will you go?
- Nowhere.

723
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,886
Vijay, don't you want to swim?
You haven't changed.

724
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:31,158
He's not in a mood.
- What?

725
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:33,646
He's not in a mood.

726
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:39,161
But I'm in a mood.
- Let's go.

727
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,646
The water is cold.

728
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,761
Why are you letting out cold sighs.
- It's deep too.

729
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:53,646
Come back.

730
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,635
Come. . .come on.

731
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,635
I'm not coming. I know to swim.

732
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,156
Understand?

733
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,156
Come.

734
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:15,160
I really don't know to swim.
- So what? I'll teach. . .

735
01:16:16,647 --> 01:16:20,162
I'll teach you so well
you'll swim like a fish.

736
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:25,160
Don't worry, this is nothing. If you
tell me, I'll swim across seven seas.

737
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,156
Help!

738
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,646
As much as I had thought . . .

739
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:39,156
the water. . .

740
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,156
Help!

741
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:46,160
is deeper than that.

742
01:16:51,647 --> 01:16:52,635
Help!

743
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:02,635
Help!

744
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:25,162
Sounds like a classical music
programme is being aired on radio.

745
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:27,156
Which Raga are you singing?

746
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:31,156
Go away from here.

747
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:34,040
Look, this is neither the office,
nor are you the boss here.

748
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,646
Such behavior
with guests is not right.

749
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:37,156
Take this. . .take.

750
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:44,156
Look, I'm warning you. . .

751
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:47,156
What happened?

752
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:51,637
I was busy all day and when I reached
here I was told you are not well.

753
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,156
Daddy . . .

754
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:57,161
Daddy, I've caught a cold.
- How?

755
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,156
I. . .

756
01:18:00,647 --> 01:18:04,162
Geeta had gone in to measure
the depth of the pond.

757
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:08,159
But you don't know to swim.
- Her tutor was excellent.

758
01:18:08,247 --> 01:18:11,637
Look, I am warning you. . .
- You don't have to. I have understood.

759
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,635
You won't understand like that.
I'll explain to you. . .

760
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:26,642
Daddy, Kishore is a fraud.
He is a big che. . .cheat.

761
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:32,638
He doesn't know to swim himself
and pushed me in the water.

762
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,646
Then what happened?

763
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,646
Kishore and I were drowning.

764
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:48,639
Vijay came. . .and saved us.

765
01:18:48,967 --> 01:18:52,642
You should not have done this.
Look what a bad cold you have caught.

766
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:57,640
Cover yourself.
- I didn't go myself.

767
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:58,755
Then?

768
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:05,159
Daddy, shall I ask you something?

769
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:12,638
If. . .someone likes someone . . .

770
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,556
but that someone is
absolutely stupid . . .

771
01:19:19,647 --> 01:19:22,639
Then this person should also act
stupid. It will be best for both.

772
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:54,159
' I can assume the dreams seen
at night as false'

773
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,635
' But what about dreams seen
during day?'

774
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:03,159
' The lines on my hand may be wrong'

775
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:08,638
' But tell me, does your hand
show my being in your life?'

776
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,156
Remove your glasses.

777
01:20:27,647 --> 01:20:28,635
Remove them.

778
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:33,156
Remove them please.

779
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:36,156
Remove them.

780
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:09,159
''In the wet winds,
in your attitude . . . ''

781
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:16,637
''what joy is this, what enchantment?''

782
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:19,635
''Enjoy it''

783
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:27,159
''I am crazy and so are you''

784
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:34,159
''We unite in love,
in this naughty spring''

785
01:21:34,647 --> 01:21:37,639
''Listen ! come to me''

786
01:21:59,167 --> 01:22:02,637
''Take care of your heart,
it is naive''

787
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:04,646
''The sweet gaze's . . . ''

788
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:09,885
''habit is naughty''

789
01:22:13,647 --> 01:22:16,639
''The heart has such hopes from you''

790
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:19,158
''Like the relation of spring . . . ''

791
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,646
''with a rose''

792
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,637
''In the wet winds,
in your attitude . . . ''

793
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:04,637
''Don't go away when you are so close''

794
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,646
''My love is . . . ''

795
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:11,646
''lucky to have found you''

796
01:23:15,647 --> 01:23:18,878
''I had seen you in my dreams''

797
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:21,635
''You are . . . ''

798
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,158
''different from what you seemed''

799
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:34,637
''I am crazy and so are you . . . ''

800
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:03,159
Look, I can invest money,
I cannot help you in the business.

801
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,886
You are going on expanding business.
Will you be able to manage alone?

802
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:12,163
I am that donkey, the more burdened,
the faster it runs.

803
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,635
You just sign the papers.

804
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:18,886
And your signatures?
- Here are my signatures.

805
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:23,159
I had signed first and
got the papers typed later.

806
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:26,635
I am a businessman. I am always
the first to grab profits . . .

807
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:28,166
and run away from losses.

808
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,638
And then, there are only
profits in this business.

809
01:24:30,887 --> 01:24:32,639
Just sign without any worry.

810
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:41,161
Call Geeta. She is your partner.
Even her signatures are necessary.

811
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:49,161
Come to my cabin.

812
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:53,159
Wonder what magic spell
you have cast on Kishore.

813
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:57,645
He likes the advertising
field so much . . .

814
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:00,158
I fear he may write a book on it.

815
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:05,159
' Love may be an immaturity'

816
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,158
' But O intelligent ones . . . '

817
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:13,638
' in youth,
this immaturity seems beautiful'

818
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:28,159
' Why do I fear
to express my feelings?'

819
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,158
' Maybe because you fear
getting thrashed'

820
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,885
What do you think of yourself?

821
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,638
Don't chew my brains.
Go do your work.

822
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:39,637
I am doing my work. My job is to
launch this cream in the market.

823
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:41,646
If that scientist
is speaking the truth . . .

824
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:44,644
we can make millions from this cream.

825
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:49,160
He said that this cream can
turn dark skins to fair . . .

826
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:53,161
make the ugly beautiful,
the beautiful, even more so. . .

827
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:57,638
And the even more beautiful
can turn into fairies? Isn't it?

828
01:25:58,647 --> 01:26:00,638
It can even make wrinkles
and moles on the face vanish.

829
01:26:01,247 --> 01:26:04,637
So start applying it from today.
Soon, you will become a woman.

830
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:08,637
You can never be a great man in life,
nor do anything great.

831
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:11,556
And you can?
- I don't get a chance.

832
01:26:11,647 --> 01:26:14,036
I regretted telling him yesterday,
and regretted telling him today.

833
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:17,159
Madam, this is the same
face cream that I mentioned to you.

834
01:26:17,647 --> 01:26:19,558
We can buy its rights
and make millions.

835
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:21,558
The world markets
will be in my control.

836
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:23,558
And he will be under police control.

837
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:26,044
You keep making castles in the air.

838
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:28,556
What happened to Mr. Banwarilal's
shooting programme?

839
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:31,639
It's today.
- Today? Why didn't you inform me?

840
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:34,158
Where did you give me
the chance to tell you?

841
01:26:34,247 --> 01:26:36,636
Where will the artists come?
- At the shoot.

842
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:39,156
Don't worry, the biggest of jobs
is petty for me.

843
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:42,159
Where is the script?
- Even that's a petty job for him.

844
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:44,156
Come.

845
01:26:48,647 --> 01:26:52,162
Wonder what's wrong with the world.
Not a single artist has come yet.

846
01:26:52,247 --> 01:26:54,044
Everything you do is a mess.

847
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:57,045
Mr. Kishore, there is a shoot
of another producer after two hours.

848
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,158
Finish your work soon, or we will
be forced to break this set.

849
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:02,558
You will break the set later,
my head will get broken first.

850
01:27:02,647 --> 01:27:04,876
Sorry, I'm helpless.
- But. . . but. . .

851
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,156
What but?

852
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:09,559
Do you know how much loss we'll suffer
if the shooting doesn't happen today?

853
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:12,639
But listen to me. . .
- Vijay, think of a solution.

854
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:17,156
I found a solution !

855
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:26,045
You will play the hero.
- I? Hero? No!

856
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:29,159
Then will my father play the role?
- I cannot act, you play the role.

857
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:33,041
Two artistes are missing.
I am playing the father anyway.

858
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:35,158
Don't worry,
I'll teach you in minutes.

859
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:37,556
Not at all. . .I don't know to act.

860
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:39,160
It's a question of life and death.

861
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:46,557
Madam, can we begin?
- Yes.

862
01:27:46,647 --> 01:27:49,639
Understood?. . . Director, begin.

863
01:28:03,167 --> 01:28:08,639
What happened to you, my son?

864
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:15,643
What is the matter?
Why are crying?

865
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,160
First tell me whether
you are crying or laughing.

866
01:28:22,167 --> 01:28:29,164
Uncle, my heart is being wrenched.
- Even my heart is being wrenched.

867
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:31,156
But why?

868
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:36,638
For God's sake,
tell me what the matter is.

869
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:39,965
Uncle, when my father died . . .

870
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:43,045
all the old men in my neighbourhood
consoled me with the words. . .

871
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:45,635
' Don't worry Jumman,
we are there for you'

872
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:47,566
Even I had told you that.

873
01:28:47,647 --> 01:28:53,643
Uncle, when my mother died. . .
- What a sad day that was!

874
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,566
Don't cry.

875
01:28:56,647 --> 01:29:00,640
When my mother died, all the old
women in the neighbourhood told me. . .

876
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:03,156
' Don't worry Jumman,
we are there for you'

877
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:08,160
But now, when my
beloved Laila has died . . .

878
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:10,646
Don't cry, son.

879
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:13,886
Today, when my
beloved Laila has died . . .

880
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:17,557
no girl of the neighbourhood said . . .

881
01:29:17,647 --> 01:29:20,639
' Don't cry Jumman,
we are there for you'

882
01:29:28,167 --> 01:29:33,161
Don't worry son, this tobacco
of Neelam Company . . .

883
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:34,646
will eliminate your sorrows.

884
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:41,639
Don't cry. The peace I get
eating it, you also experience it.

885
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:47,160
What happened, son?

886
01:29:48,647 --> 01:29:50,046
What brazenness is this?
- What did I do?

887
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:51,646
Why did you put
the tobacco in my mouth?

888
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:54,565
It's tobacco we are publicizing. How
can I not put tobacco in your mouth?

889
01:29:54,647 --> 01:29:56,638
Damn such publicity!
This was not mentioned in the script.

890
01:29:57,167 --> 01:30:00,647
Ofcourse it was. It's the
publicity of real tobacco.

891
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:02,638
Look, this is what he keeps doing.

892
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:04,156
You handle him now.

893
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:09,046
He is always doing something stupid.I
don't want to work for such publicity.

894
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:12,637
You always mess things up.
Now do your publicity.

895
01:30:23,887 --> 01:30:25,878
Vijay ruined
the programme deliberately.

896
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,646
He wants to belittle me.

897
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:29,885
Why did you give the
hero's role to Vijay?

898
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:32,161
Why didn't you play the role?
- I was playing the father.

899
01:30:32,247 --> 01:30:36,638
You enacted a father's role?
You should have called me for it.

900
01:30:36,887 --> 01:30:38,878
I didn't expect you to be able to act.

901
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:44,161
What I am doing day in and day out
is acting. Who can act better than me?

902
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:49,557
What is done is done. But if you
still help me a little, . . .

903
01:30:49,647 --> 01:30:50,635
we can mend the situation.

904
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:53,959
Since you have been born,
I have only been helping you.

905
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:56,044
Tell me, what do you want me to do?

906
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:59,876
The face cream I told you
about can change our destinies.

907
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:02,635
I have the whole plan
to launch it in the market.

908
01:31:02,767 --> 01:31:04,166
You only have to like it.

909
01:31:04,247 --> 01:31:06,158
What difference does my
liking or not liking make?

910
01:31:06,247 --> 01:31:11,162
Did Geeta like it?
- Normally, Geeta does everything I say

911
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:13,556
But nowadays, even she is
not favoring me.

912
01:31:13,647 --> 01:31:14,635
The reason?

913
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:17,879
Geeta and me almost
drowned a few days ago.

914
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:20,044
We were about to go under when
Vijay came and saved us and I. . .

915
01:31:20,167 --> 01:31:24,046
Shame on you ! Why didn't you two
drown? Atleast she would be with you.

916
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:25,646
A third man would not have saved you.

917
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:31,163
Idiot, just think. Will a girl like
the one who saved her, or drowned her?

918
01:31:31,247 --> 01:31:35,638
Don't worry, I'll manage.
- When?

919
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:38,044
When the girl marries someone else?

920
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:44,160
You nut! You should have atleast given
a thought to whose son you are.

921
01:31:44,247 --> 01:31:50,163
If you had followed in my foot steps,
the mansions of Champa would be ours.

922
01:31:50,247 --> 01:31:53,159
But father. . .
- Shut-up! Just come with me.

923
01:31:53,247 --> 01:31:57,638
He's so decent even at this age.
God save him from evil eyes.

924
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:03,161
Honestly Champalal, only the
fortunate ones get such children.

925
01:32:03,647 --> 01:32:06,161
And then, I have already
told you his plan.

926
01:32:06,247 --> 01:32:08,158
We can become millionaires.

927
01:32:08,647 --> 01:32:13,880
When this wonder cream is launched,
your fame will touch the skies.

928
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:18,637
And then Mr. Champalal. . .
- Can't you call him uncle?

929
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:22,158
Yes uncle, you need not worry at all.

930
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:27,162
Just have faith in us
and watch what we do.

931
01:32:27,247 --> 01:32:31,160
Just ask Geeta to help us.

932
01:32:31,247 --> 01:32:37,038
It's we old men who need that cream.
Our youthful days will return.

933
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:45,163
Don't take it to be a cream.
It's a magic potion.

934
01:32:57,887 --> 01:33:04,156
Geeta, Lalchand and Kishore have told
me about Wonder wrinkle removing cream

935
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,885
I want to launch this
product in the market.

936
01:33:07,647 --> 01:33:11,162
No, you don't understand.
I like the idea.

937
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:13,646
We can make quite a lot of money.

938
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:15,646
You help Kishore in this.

939
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:18,646
Have you made all the arrangements?
- No, I . . .

940
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:21,158
He only has to begin now.

941
01:33:21,247 --> 01:33:23,158
Uncle, I will work hard
on this project.

942
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:28,162
He is a strong man. If he decides
to do something, he does it.

943
01:33:30,287 --> 01:33:32,164
Okay, then go and explain it to Geeta.

944
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:39,159
But how is that possible? How can we
launch such a thing in the market . . .

945
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:40,566
without a chemical analysis report?

946
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:46,643
We will have to think of some way.
When dad has said,we'll have to do it.

947
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:50,161
Only one thing can be done.
Get the chemical analysis report . . .

948
01:33:50,247 --> 01:33:52,158
before launching the
face cream in the market.

949
01:33:52,247 --> 01:33:54,044
Very good idea !
That can be done.

950
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:01,639
What is your plan?
- Just watch what I do.

951
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:03,878
I will go for publicity in a big way.

952
01:34:03,967 --> 01:34:06,036
I will create a sensation
in every corner of India.

953
01:34:06,167 --> 01:34:10,160
People will talk about my cream. They
will look for me with garlands in hand.

954
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:15,045
And the whole city will
brighten up with neon lights.

955
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:59,161
''Watch the magic
of this colourful bottle''

956
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:09,159
''The dark will become fair,
the fair will become handsome''

957
01:35:09,247 --> 01:35:11,044
''And the handsome, even more so''

958
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:13,158
''You are the queen of nights''

959
01:35:17,647 --> 01:35:19,160
''You are young''

960
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:20,646
''Your youth is full of verve''

961
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:23,644
''It's all thanks to you''

962
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:35,161
''Watch the magic
of this colourful bottle . . . ''

963
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:11,638
''If a beauty applies it,
she enchants everyone''

964
01:36:12,647 --> 01:36:16,640
''The young hearts hold their breaths,
they sigh''

965
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:20,158
''Listen O men with youthful hearts''

966
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:22,885
''Apply it to the cheeks''

967
01:36:23,167 --> 01:36:27,638
''And women will coyly follow you''

968
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:30,638
''Take, try . . . ''

969
01:36:31,647 --> 01:36:33,638
''my medication''

970
01:36:34,647 --> 01:36:38,162
''Why do you roam lost?''

971
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:49,165
''Watch the magic
of this colourful bottle . . . ''

972
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:26,161
''I'd say,
this is a must for beauties''

973
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:30,637
''See this magic potion of mine''

974
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:37,560
''Those who go to the moon
will find a scar even on it''

975
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:41,162
''Take this cream there''

976
01:37:42,647 --> 01:37:45,161
''It will clear . . . ''

977
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:47,646
''your skin''

978
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:52,159
''And even the moon will
be after you''

979
01:37:57,967 --> 01:38:03,165
''Watch the magic
of this colourful bottle . . . ''

980
01:39:11,567 --> 01:39:13,637
Didn't I create a sensation?

981
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:17,637
You were the only one
who didn't attend my show.

982
01:39:18,647 --> 01:39:20,638
You consider everything I do foolish?

983
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:25,159
I think so even now.
- Who cares for you now?

984
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:33,642
I am just waiting for consent.
Then my life will be spent in comfort.

985
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:43,163
It may happen that you spend half your
life hoping, &amp; the other half waiting.

986
01:39:51,167 --> 01:39:54,876
Thousands of people are
coming towards our building.

987
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:58,557
They are coming to garland you.
You have done such a great job.

988
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:00,646
I'll just be back.

989
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:53,160
What is your problem?

990
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:59,637
I say, move back. . . move back.

991
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:06,638
Move back. . .you won't?
I'll move back myself.

992
01:41:10,167 --> 01:41:13,159
Tell me what's your problem.
Say something ! Where are the garlands?

993
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:16,635
Brother, he gave me
the bottle of cream yesterday.

994
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:18,156
Me?

995
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:24,639
You are responsible for my getting
beaten for doing this in the market.

996
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:27,646
Who, me?
- Yes!

997
01:41:27,767 --> 01:41:31,157
Wait, I'll just ask and come.
. . . . Run !

998
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:52,156
Let me go.

999
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:56,158
Spare me.

1000
01:42:03,167 --> 01:42:06,159
What's happening?
What happened to you?

1001
01:42:06,247 --> 01:42:12,163
I am innocent. . . my shirt!
Don't punch my stomach, it hurts.

1002
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:16,646
He really hit me.

1003
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:19,646
Where are the garlands?

1004
01:42:22,167 --> 01:42:23,156
You beat me?

1005
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:33,158
Vijay hurry,
they are beating up Kishore.

1006
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:36,159
They are doing this and this.
- What?

1007
01:42:36,647 --> 01:42:39,639
They are making faces.
- Making faces?

1008
01:42:40,167 --> 01:42:41,156
Come!

1009
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:56,635
Listen. . .

1010
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,158
Quiet! . . . Quiet!

1011
01:43:38,167 --> 01:43:40,158
Be quiet and listen to me.

1012
01:43:41,167 --> 01:43:43,158
Whatever I will say
will be in your interest.

1013
01:43:43,247 --> 01:43:47,638
Look, your facial muscles
twitching is temporary.

1014
01:43:47,767 --> 01:43:49,883
You'll be okay in a few days.
- What's the proof?

1015
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:53,557
You are. . . ?
- I am the editor of ' Bombay News'

1016
01:43:53,647 --> 01:43:55,160
My name is Moni Chatterjee.

1017
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:01,160
Look, this is the
chemical analyzer's report.

1018
01:44:02,167 --> 01:44:05,876
This clearly shows that this
report has come later.

1019
01:44:06,047 --> 01:44:08,163
The cream was launched in the
market before this report.

1020
01:44:09,167 --> 01:44:12,159
Yes, we have made that mistake.

1021
01:44:12,247 --> 01:44:14,556
What if this report stated
' permanent effect' . . .

1022
01:44:14,647 --> 01:44:15,635
instead of ' temporary'?

1023
01:44:15,767 --> 01:44:18,644
Our company is responsible anyway.
We have made a mistake.

1024
01:44:28,806 --> 01:44:31,273
Saw what Vijay has done
to your reputation?

1025
01:44:31,806 --> 01:44:34,798
Arrest could be imminent.

1026
01:44:34,886 --> 01:44:38,276
If your beloved wants to do this,
allow us to leave.

1027
01:44:38,806 --> 01:44:42,799
Look what I did
to save your reputation.

1028
01:44:42,886 --> 01:44:44,285
I only broke my hand now.

1029
01:44:44,406 --> 01:44:46,283
But even if I lose my life,
I don't care.

1030
01:44:46,806 --> 01:44:51,276
But if Vijay defames us like this,
who will come to us?

1031
01:44:51,406 --> 01:44:55,193
You are right. Look, if
you still don't do something. . .

1032
01:44:55,286 --> 01:44:56,799
you will regret all your life.

1033
01:44:56,886 --> 01:45:01,801
Vijay will ruin all that you've
taken your whole life to make.

1034
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:07,276
I know everything.
I'll do whatever I deem fit.

1035
01:45:09,806 --> 01:45:10,794
You may leave.

1036
01:45:10,886 --> 01:45:14,674
It was our duty to warn you
which we have. Do as you please now.

1037
01:45:14,806 --> 01:45:15,794
Let's go.

1038
01:45:20,806 --> 01:45:21,794
Uncle. . .

1039
01:45:28,806 --> 01:45:33,276
You called me?
- Why is a lamp lit in a dark night?

1040
01:45:35,806 --> 01:45:37,285
To spread light.

1041
01:45:37,806 --> 01:45:40,806
But fireflies die in them.

1042
01:45:40,806 --> 01:45:43,273
Then why don't people
defame the one who lit the lamp?

1043
01:45:44,806 --> 01:45:46,797
Because his intention
was not to harm anyone.

1044
01:45:46,886 --> 01:45:49,275
If someone harms himself, how is
the one who lit the lamp at fault?

1045
01:45:49,806 --> 01:45:51,205
Why are you asking me all this?

1046
01:45:51,286 --> 01:45:55,199
Even I had launched the cream
to make ugly people beautiful.

1047
01:45:55,286 --> 01:45:57,800
If someone unknowingly got harmed,
how am I at fault?

1048
01:45:58,806 --> 01:46:01,195
Take, read this.

1049
01:46:02,286 --> 01:46:05,801
Only I know how much
your statement has hurt me.

1050
01:46:06,286 --> 01:46:09,278
I never expected you to
make such a big mistake.

1051
01:46:09,806 --> 01:46:12,798
Can you imagine how much our
company's reputation will suffer?

1052
01:46:13,206 --> 01:46:16,676
I didn't go and make this statement.
A reporter questioned me . . .

1053
01:46:16,806 --> 01:46:17,794
and I told him the truth.

1054
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:22,684
A lie that does not hurt anyone
and saves our honour . . .

1055
01:46:22,806 --> 01:46:24,285
what's the harm
in speaking such a lie?

1056
01:46:24,526 --> 01:46:28,041
A lie is a lie. And to hide one lie,
you have to say a hundred more.

1057
01:46:28,806 --> 01:46:31,195
And then, it is always
better to accept your mistake.

1058
01:46:31,286 --> 01:46:33,277
They are all bookish words.
Who follows them?

1059
01:46:33,806 --> 01:46:36,273
Look at the world as the world is.

1060
01:46:37,206 --> 01:46:41,279
Those how accept their mistake are
not forgiven here. They are punished.

1061
01:46:41,806 --> 01:46:43,797
And this punishment makes
a human, an angel.

1062
01:46:43,886 --> 01:46:45,797
Vijay, I don't want to argue.

1063
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:49,800
I want a man who will follow
my orders.

1064
01:46:49,886 --> 01:46:51,797
Who can understand my prestige.

1065
01:46:51,926 --> 01:46:55,282
Hereafter, you will
have to do what I want.

1066
01:46:58,806 --> 01:46:59,794
What. . .

1067
01:47:05,806 --> 01:47:06,794
Okay.

1068
01:47:08,806 --> 01:47:10,797
I won't cause you any more pain now.

1069
01:47:11,806 --> 01:47:15,276
I will leave.
- I didn't ask you to leave.

1070
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:20,799
I can leave everything uncle ;
but not my principles.

1071
01:47:23,806 --> 01:47:27,799
Alright, when your
dream world shatters . . .

1072
01:47:28,806 --> 01:47:29,794
come back.

1073
01:47:33,806 --> 01:47:38,516
The doors of this house
will always be open for you.

1074
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:01,794
You are leaving?

1075
01:48:06,806 --> 01:48:08,285
Where will you go?

1076
01:48:09,286 --> 01:48:10,799
There must be a place
for people like us.

1077
01:48:11,806 --> 01:48:13,797
Daddy's words offended you?

1078
01:48:15,286 --> 01:48:19,199
I have no complaints against
your dad, but this world . . .

1079
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:21,800
where truth and humanity
is considered a crime.

1080
01:48:25,286 --> 01:48:27,277
Then why are you leaving?

1081
01:48:28,806 --> 01:48:31,525
Because your father
and my paths are different.

1082
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:34,273
I want to go
in search of that path . . .

1083
01:48:34,806 --> 01:48:36,797
where I don't have to lie
to make a living.

1084
01:48:37,286 --> 01:48:39,277
Where man is not
forced to call night day.

1085
01:48:49,806 --> 01:48:52,525
Let them be here.

1086
01:48:52,806 --> 01:48:57,799
Atleast they will remind me of you.

1087
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,277
Will you think of me?

1088
01:49:05,806 --> 01:49:08,273
You think of those
who are away from you.

1089
01:49:08,406 --> 01:49:10,202
You cannot forget those
who live in your heart.

1090
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:12,277
I will always hold
your image in my eyes.

1091
01:49:14,806 --> 01:49:21,803
I will wait for that day when you
will come to return my lost smiles.

1092
01:49:23,286 --> 01:49:25,277
Why are you feeling so sad?

1093
01:49:25,806 --> 01:49:29,276
I am only leaving this house,
I am not leaving you.

1094
01:49:29,806 --> 01:49:32,798
Wherever I will be,
your memories will be with me.

1095
01:49:33,806 --> 01:49:38,516
And then, I am in this city.
I can meet you.

1096
01:50:00,806 --> 01:50:02,797
Sir, your tea.
- Keep it.

1097
01:50:06,806 --> 01:50:09,273
What are you doing, sir?

1098
01:50:11,806 --> 01:50:15,276
I am looking for a job.

1099
01:50:24,806 --> 01:50:28,799
What happened?
- You have a nice face cut.

1100
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:34,523
You mean I should
join some film company?

1101
01:50:34,606 --> 01:50:38,281
Yes sir. Even I tried a lot,
but I'm not handsome.

1102
01:50:38,406 --> 01:50:41,284
Just one chance,
and one can make millions.

1103
01:50:41,806 --> 01:50:44,273
Forget that, where is my breakfast?
- I'll get it.

1104
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:49,799
Sir, if you get a chance,
do help me out too.

1105
01:50:55,806 --> 01:51:01,199
For now, my film company is
Honesty Electric Company.

1106
01:51:22,806 --> 01:51:27,038
Where are you going, mister?
- I've come for a job.

1107
01:51:27,286 --> 01:51:30,801
You can go in.

1108
01:51:34,806 --> 01:51:39,799
What? Beauty hair cutting saloon?
No, wrong number.

1109
01:51:41,806 --> 01:51:45,276
Yes?
- I had come for the job.

1110
01:51:45,406 --> 01:51:46,394
Sit down.

1111
01:51:46,806 --> 01:51:51,799
I am a graduate.
- I don't care about that.

1112
01:51:51,886 --> 01:51:55,196
You have to stand on the counter
and sell products smartly.

1113
01:51:55,286 --> 01:51:56,275
Will you be able to do it?

1114
01:51:56,406 --> 01:52:02,675
Sure I will. Even earlier. . .
- Stop! Short and sweet, yes or no?

1115
01:52:02,806 --> 01:52:03,794
Yes.

1116
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:10,285
You have a good face.

1117
01:52:13,806 --> 01:52:15,797
You can join work tomorrow.

1118
01:52:32,806 --> 01:52:35,798
The door is open, come in.

1119
01:52:46,806 --> 01:52:47,794
Keep it, I'll drink it.

1120
01:52:51,206 --> 01:52:52,195
Are you deaf?

1121
01:52:54,806 --> 01:52:56,285
Your hands are soft like a girl's.

1122
01:53:00,806 --> 01:53:03,798
What brings you here early morning?
. .Where are you going?

1123
01:53:04,806 --> 01:53:07,195
None of your business.
Leave me.

1124
01:53:09,806 --> 01:53:12,798
I won't leave you so easily.

1125
01:53:20,806 --> 01:53:23,798
Angry?
- As if you care.

1126
01:53:24,806 --> 01:53:26,797
Listen. . .
- I won't listen.

1127
01:53:28,806 --> 01:53:30,797
My eyes were craving to see you.

1128
01:53:30,886 --> 01:53:33,798
That is why you haven't come
to see me in two months.

1129
01:53:34,806 --> 01:53:39,276
First hear my plea, then punish me.
- It's me who is being punished.

1130
01:53:40,206 --> 01:53:43,278
Do you know with what difficulty
I got your address?

1131
01:53:45,046 --> 01:53:48,800
You should have asked your heart.
- You had taken it away with you.

1132
01:53:50,206 --> 01:53:52,800
But I left mine back.
- He only told me where to find you.

1133
01:53:52,886 --> 01:53:54,683
Or as if you would ever come.

1134
01:53:54,806 --> 01:53:57,273
I was going to come today evening.
- You're saying this coz I'm here now.

1135
01:53:57,406 --> 01:53:58,964
Why didn't you come in so many days?

1136
01:53:59,046 --> 01:54:01,116
How could I? I am working.

1137
01:54:01,206 --> 01:54:02,685
I go in the morning,
come in the evening . . .

1138
01:54:02,806 --> 01:54:06,799
think of you at night, and go to bed.
That's how my days go. Understood?

1139
01:54:11,806 --> 01:54:13,285
You understood very soon.

1140
01:54:21,806 --> 01:54:24,798
Where had you gone?
I was looking for you since morning.

1141
01:54:27,806 --> 01:54:30,273
I am seeing you smiling
after many days today.

1142
01:54:30,806 --> 01:54:35,276
What have you found?
- What I had lost.

1143
01:54:38,806 --> 01:54:41,798
I am going to office.
- I am not coming to office today.

1144
01:54:41,886 --> 01:54:42,875
Not coming?

1145
01:54:45,286 --> 01:54:46,275
Okay.

1146
01:55:11,806 --> 01:55:15,799
''Why is my scarf flying?''

1147
01:55:19,806 --> 01:55:22,798
''Why are my eyes shy?''

1148
01:55:50,806 --> 01:55:54,799
''He started appeasing me,
began giving excuses''

1149
01:55:58,806 --> 01:56:00,285
''But I continued to act annoyed''

1150
01:56:04,286 --> 01:56:08,279
''I looked away, I tried . . . ''

1151
01:56:08,526 --> 01:56:10,278
''but I could not say it''

1152
01:56:14,806 --> 01:56:17,798
''Why is my scarf flying . . . ''

1153
01:56:56,806 --> 01:57:00,799
''It brought along joys,
a mischievous attitude''

1154
01:57:05,286 --> 01:57:08,278
''That blue gaze of his''

1155
01:57:10,806 --> 01:57:14,276
''Make my dreams come true,
hide me in your heart . . . ''

1156
01:57:14,806 --> 01:57:17,798
''O my love''

1157
01:57:20,806 --> 01:57:24,276
''Why is my scarf flying . . . ''

1158
01:57:46,286 --> 01:57:48,800
' The lines on my hand may be wrong'

1159
01:57:49,806 --> 01:57:52,798
' But tell me, does your hand
show my being in your life?'

1160
01:57:54,806 --> 01:57:56,523
I want table lamp shades.

1161
01:57:58,286 --> 01:58:01,278
This is for Rs. 5. 15p,
this is Rs. 6. 20p

1162
01:58:01,806 --> 01:58:03,285
And this is Rs. 7. 25p.

1163
01:58:03,406 --> 01:58:05,283
What make is it?
- It's Indian.

1164
01:58:05,806 --> 01:58:07,285
Very cheap and strong.

1165
01:58:07,806 --> 01:58:10,683
India is progressing. Our products
are competing foreign brands.

1166
01:58:10,806 --> 01:58:14,196
Nonsense! There is a lot of difference
between Indian make and foreign make.

1167
01:58:14,286 --> 01:58:17,801
I want a foreign make.
- Sorry,no imports available these days

1168
01:58:17,886 --> 01:58:20,684
Nonsense!
They are available in other shops.

1169
01:58:20,806 --> 01:58:22,797
I'm sorry,
they are not available with us.

1170
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:26,273
There are! . . .You are a strange man.

1171
01:58:26,806 --> 01:58:28,683
You send back a customer
without realizing.

1172
01:58:28,806 --> 01:58:31,798
Go inside, there is lots of
this stuff in the corner shelf.

1173
01:58:31,886 --> 01:58:35,276
Go bring it.
Go, it is there inside.

1174
01:58:37,806 --> 01:58:43,597
We have goods from every country.
- Sir, I cannot find them.

1175
01:58:43,806 --> 01:58:44,794
You are an idiot!

1176
01:58:50,286 --> 01:58:51,799
Just a gesture is enough
for an intelligent man.

1177
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:00,282
Tell me, which country's
do you want?

1178
01:59:06,286 --> 01:59:12,282
Here's England.
You cannot even look properly.

1179
01:59:12,526 --> 01:59:14,278
Look, this is from England.

1180
01:59:18,806 --> 01:59:20,797
Here. Made in England.

1181
01:59:22,606 --> 01:59:27,282
Only Rs. 1 7. 25p.
- No, it's Rs. 7. 25p

1182
01:59:27,406 --> 01:59:31,285
Rs. 1 7. 25p.
- Rs. 7. 25p

1183
01:59:34,806 --> 01:59:37,273
Made in India. Rs. 7. 25p.

1184
01:59:40,606 --> 01:59:43,803
You are cheating me?
I will have you arrested.

1185
01:59:49,806 --> 01:59:53,276
Get out of here! . . Get out!

1186
01:59:54,806 --> 01:59:57,798
Okay. . . My salary?
- Damn your salary!

1187
01:59:57,886 --> 01:59:59,797
I won't pay you a penny!

1188
01:59:59,926 --> 02:00:03,202
Sorry sir, but I have worked,
I must get paid for it.

1189
02:00:03,286 --> 02:00:05,516
You want money?
Khan, give him the money.

1190
02:00:05,806 --> 02:00:10,196
What do you want?
- Speak properly, Mr. Khan.

1191
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:15,280
You are threatening me?
I'll crush you !

1192
02:00:19,806 --> 02:00:22,195
I'm a dead man !
- Give me my money.

1193
02:00:22,286 --> 02:00:24,277
I am giving you.

1194
02:00:25,806 --> 02:00:32,279
1, 2, 3, 7. . .
- 4.

1195
02:00:32,806 --> 02:00:40,281
Yes, 4, 5, 7. . .
- 6. . . . Give it to me.

1196
02:00:44,806 --> 02:00:51,803
Master, hurry.
The world is in trouble.

1197
02:00:55,806 --> 02:00:56,794
Good bye.

1198
02:00:57,286 --> 02:01:00,801
Damn him! He knocked down my guard.

1199
02:01:01,806 --> 02:01:05,799
Mr. Khan, the world is not
in trouble, humanity is.

1200
02:01:06,806 --> 02:01:09,798
Try seeing the world
with both your eyes.

1201
02:01:10,286 --> 02:01:11,275
I'll help you up.

1202
02:01:15,806 --> 02:01:18,273
Keep this. . .good bye.
- Good bye.

1203
02:01:32,806 --> 02:01:35,798
Play harder.

1204
02:01:37,806 --> 02:01:41,276
Begin, come on. . .good.

1205
02:01:58,806 --> 02:02:01,273
Why are you laughing
at us poor people, sir?

1206
02:02:01,806 --> 02:02:04,273
I am not laughing at you.

1207
02:02:04,806 --> 02:02:07,798
I am seeing how happily you
are living your life.

1208
02:02:08,286 --> 02:02:10,800
There is no happiness
in our lives, sir.

1209
02:02:10,886 --> 02:02:13,798
We entertain ourselves
to forget our sorrows.

1210
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:16,800
Or life would be very difficult.

1211
02:02:17,286 --> 02:02:18,799
That is more than enough.

1212
02:02:20,806 --> 02:02:25,799
See those tall buildings there?
No one is happy in them either.

1213
02:02:26,286 --> 02:02:29,801
Why are you joking?
- Honestly.

1214
02:02:29,886 --> 02:02:32,798
It's a mirage.
It seems like water from a distance.

1215
02:02:33,206 --> 02:02:34,798
Go close and they
are only mounds of sands.

1216
02:02:34,886 --> 02:02:37,275
They have everything, but yet nothing.

1217
02:02:37,806 --> 02:02:41,514
Nice thought to please the heart.

1218
02:02:42,806 --> 02:02:44,797
Though the world belongs to them.

1219
02:02:47,206 --> 02:02:51,802
Whether anyone believes it or not,
but a day will come . .

1220
02:02:51,886 --> 02:02:58,803
when this world will belong to us.
- Is it? Bless you, sir!

1221
02:03:14,806 --> 02:03:17,273
''The state of my heart . . . ''

1222
02:03:17,806 --> 02:03:22,799
''knows not this world''

1223
02:03:32,806 --> 02:03:34,797
''Listen O world . . . ''

1224
02:03:35,286 --> 02:03:39,802
''good days will return''

1225
02:04:11,806 --> 02:04:19,803
''The world will change one day
and walk the staid path''

1226
02:04:20,806 --> 02:04:24,514
''It shuns us today''

1227
02:04:24,806 --> 02:04:28,276
''It will regret it's act tomorrow''

1228
02:04:29,286 --> 02:04:36,283
''Accept it, know it, brother''

1229
02:04:38,806 --> 02:04:40,797
''The state of my heart . . . ''

1230
02:05:13,806 --> 02:05:21,803
''My heart bears so many scars,
yet I am calm''

1231
02:05:22,806 --> 02:05:30,281
''I light lamps of
hope and live happily''

1232
02:05:31,286 --> 02:05:38,283
''I suffer for the world,
but yet stay happy, brother''

1233
02:05:40,806 --> 02:05:42,797
''The state of my heart . . . ''

1234
02:06:06,806 --> 02:06:14,281
''I will never walk the path of lies''

1235
02:06:15,806 --> 02:06:22,803
''I may be a mite on earth,
yet I'll shine in the sky''

1236
02:06:24,806 --> 02:06:27,683
''Why should I
be suppressed by anyone?''

1237
02:06:27,806 --> 02:06:30,798
''I have no fear, brother''

1238
02:06:33,806 --> 02:06:35,797
''The state of my heart . . . ''

1239
02:06:56,806 --> 02:06:58,523
You have many complaints
against the world?

1240
02:06:58,806 --> 02:07:03,276
Mr. Chatterjee? Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

1241
02:07:03,806 --> 02:07:07,276
I'm fine.
- I was impressed by you that day.

1242
02:07:07,526 --> 02:07:09,197
I have been a journalist
since 40 years.

1243
02:07:09,286 --> 02:07:11,800
But you are the first man
in these times . . .

1244
02:07:11,886 --> 02:07:14,275
who has the courage
to speak the truth.

1245
02:07:15,286 --> 02:07:17,277
But I lost my job because of that.

1246
02:07:18,806 --> 02:07:20,797
Everyone in this world
advises to speak the truth.

1247
02:07:20,886 --> 02:07:22,797
But no one is ready to hear it.

1248
02:07:24,206 --> 02:07:26,276
You want to walk the path of truth?

1249
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:30,273
Work with me from today.
- What? !

1250
02:07:32,286 --> 02:07:36,279
Let's shake hands to that.
. . . Come with me.

1251
02:07:40,286 --> 02:07:41,275
Come Vijay.

1252
02:07:44,286 --> 02:07:45,799
You will sit here from today.

1253
02:07:46,286 --> 02:07:48,800
I had been looking for a
guy like you since many days.

1254
02:07:53,806 --> 02:07:56,195
Now even you are
a part of this bar.

1255
02:07:57,806 --> 02:07:59,285
And this is your jug.

1256
02:08:01,806 --> 02:08:03,797
And this is my goblet.

1257
02:08:03,886 --> 02:08:07,276
Millions are thirsty out there.
- I can serve them as much as I want.

1258
02:08:19,806 --> 02:08:23,276
Manager involved in the bank heist.
Another exposure by reporter Vijay.

1259
02:08:42,286 --> 02:08:46,598
Blood?
- That's a part of the job. Take this.

1260
02:08:52,806 --> 02:08:55,798
So you got those goons arrested?

1261
02:08:56,806 --> 02:08:57,794
Well done, Vijay.

1262
02:09:14,806 --> 02:09:19,799
Mr.Vijay. . .where is Mr.Vijay?
- Careful ! Keshav, help him up.

1263
02:09:23,806 --> 02:09:26,273
I have lost my support forever, sir.

1264
02:09:27,286 --> 02:09:32,280
I am blind.
My eyes are blind, my fate is blind.

1265
02:09:32,806 --> 02:09:36,276
I have heard you sympathise
with the poor.

1266
02:09:36,806 --> 02:09:39,798
I have come to you with a plea.
- Tell me.

1267
02:09:41,806 --> 02:09:44,273
This medicine took my child's life.

1268
02:09:54,806 --> 02:09:57,798
But sir, no one can
die with this medicine.

1269
02:09:58,806 --> 02:10:02,799
The doctor told me
this medicine is spurious.

1270
02:10:05,806 --> 02:10:07,285
He has written this note.

1271
02:10:09,806 --> 02:10:10,794
Spurious?

1272
02:10:11,286 --> 02:10:17,805
Yes sir. I took my plea
everywhere, but no one heard me.

1273
02:10:18,806 --> 02:10:23,276
It happened 10 days ago.
I gave the medicine at 5 pm.

1274
02:10:23,806 --> 02:10:28,799
And lost my child forever.

1275
02:10:32,806 --> 02:10:34,205
Gather yourself, sir.

1276
02:10:39,526 --> 02:10:43,280
Sir, I cannot bring back your son.

1277
02:10:46,806 --> 02:10:49,273
But I can surely
get the guilty punished.

1278
02:10:52,806 --> 02:10:54,285
Where is uncle?
- Mr.Vijay, you?

1279
02:10:54,406 --> 02:10:55,805
Where is uncle?
- Over there.

1280
02:10:58,806 --> 02:11:02,276
Vijay! Welcome. You have created
quite a sensation among the people.

1281
02:11:02,806 --> 02:11:05,798
I am happy that you have
succeeded in your mission.

1282
02:11:06,806 --> 02:11:13,806
But there are a few people
who don't like what you write.

1283
02:11:13,806 --> 02:11:16,683
Perhaps even you won't like
to hear what I have come to say.

1284
02:11:16,806 --> 02:11:18,205
What is it? Tell me.

1285
02:11:20,286 --> 02:11:21,275
See this.

1286
02:11:26,806 --> 02:11:30,514
This is a medicine of our company.
- A patient was given these tablets.

1287
02:11:30,806 --> 02:11:34,514
Will you be able to hear what happened
to him. His pain disappeared forever.

1288
02:11:34,806 --> 02:11:35,794
He died.

1289
02:11:35,886 --> 02:11:41,802
What! ! That's impossible.
I'm sure you are mistaken.

1290
02:11:41,886 --> 02:11:44,798
No one can die with
pain killing tablets.

1291
02:11:46,806 --> 02:11:49,798
The doctor said the medicine
was spurious.

1292
02:11:50,286 --> 02:11:52,800
And this spurious medicine that
is manufactured in your factory . . .

1293
02:11:52,886 --> 02:11:58,279
took away the joy of a man's life.
The one who died was a 10 year old kid.

1294
02:11:59,806 --> 02:12:03,799
That means Lalchand is knowingly
playing with people's lives?

1295
02:12:03,886 --> 02:12:06,525
He is not concerned with lives,
he is concerned only about money.

1296
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:09,277
Along with Lalchand,
even you will be accused . . .

1297
02:12:09,806 --> 02:12:12,798
that you all together are responsible
for the death of that kid.

1298
02:12:12,886 --> 02:12:16,276
But Vijay, I am innocent.
I know nothing about it.

1299
02:12:16,526 --> 02:12:17,514
I believe you, uncle.

1300
02:12:17,606 --> 02:12:20,518
But the spurious medicines
that are made in your factory . . .

1301
02:12:20,806 --> 02:12:24,799
how dangerous they can be to
people's lives, think of that.

1302
02:12:26,806 --> 02:12:29,195
I am bringing
this case before the public.

1303
02:12:29,806 --> 02:12:31,285
I'd come to tell you this.

1304
02:12:48,286 --> 02:12:51,278
Yes Mr. Champalal, tell me.

1305
02:12:52,046 --> 02:12:55,800
Yes, I'm coming. . . . right away.

1306
02:12:59,286 --> 02:13:00,799
As if I killed his son.

1307
02:13:02,286 --> 02:13:04,197
Then who is
responsible for his death?

1308
02:13:04,526 --> 02:13:07,279
Life and death is not in our hands.

1309
02:13:07,806 --> 02:13:10,798
The poor guy was destined to die,
so he died.

1310
02:13:10,886 --> 02:13:14,276
Wrong ! He died because of
this spurious medicine of yours.

1311
02:13:14,606 --> 02:13:17,678
Okay, agreed.
Why are you getting angry?

1312
02:13:17,806 --> 02:13:20,798
One who has to die,
dies with good medicine too.

1313
02:13:20,886 --> 02:13:22,797
We'll compensate them for it.

1314
02:13:23,286 --> 02:13:27,802
If there is any compensation for life,
go make it to his blind father.

1315
02:13:28,286 --> 02:13:31,676
I have never paid
any money to the sighted . . .

1316
02:13:31,806 --> 02:13:33,285
what will I pay a blind man?

1317
02:13:33,806 --> 02:13:35,797
It is better we end the topic here.

1318
02:13:37,806 --> 02:13:40,798
You want to play with people's lives
for a little money?

1319
02:13:41,286 --> 02:13:43,277
With whose permission did you
manufacture and sell spurious drugs?

1320
02:13:43,806 --> 02:13:44,794
Answer me!

1321
02:13:44,926 --> 02:13:48,282
Champalal, I am not used to
being shouted at.

1322
02:13:48,806 --> 02:13:52,799
Neither do I shout, nor can I
tolerate anyone shouting at me.

1323
02:13:53,806 --> 02:13:56,798
And rest assured,
that blind man cannot do a thing.

1324
02:13:57,286 --> 02:13:59,516
You are talking like
that because he is poor?

1325
02:13:59,806 --> 02:14:02,273
Lalchand, one who has no one,
God is with him.

1326
02:14:02,606 --> 02:14:04,675
There are many sympathizers
of the poor in this world still.

1327
02:14:04,806 --> 02:14:08,036
Remember,
Vijay will take you to court.

1328
02:14:08,286 --> 02:14:14,282
Don't forget that even you will have
to stand as accused in court with me.

1329
02:14:14,406 --> 02:14:17,523
And even your daughter, Geeta.
- What nonsense are you talking !

1330
02:14:17,806 --> 02:14:21,276
I'm stating the facts. Even you
will lose your prestige along with me.

1331
02:14:21,806 --> 02:14:24,798
Even you are my partner.
- But I am not responsible for it.

1332
02:14:24,886 --> 02:14:28,196
I had told you I can invest money
but not help you in the business.

1333
02:14:28,286 --> 02:14:33,280
All those were verbal statements.
And the law accepts written agreements

1334
02:14:33,406 --> 02:14:35,202
Where will you hide the agreement?

1335
02:14:35,286 --> 02:14:39,199
Shut-up! I didn't know
you were such a base man.

1336
02:14:39,286 --> 02:14:41,277
Or I'd never
let you step in my house.

1337
02:14:41,806 --> 02:14:44,683
You want to scare me
and shut my mouth?

1338
02:14:44,806 --> 02:14:46,797
But I still have humanity in me.

1339
02:14:46,886 --> 02:14:50,196
I don't want to base my prestige
on the blood of a hapless man.

1340
02:14:50,806 --> 02:14:54,276
Even if I am ruined,
my daughter is ruined . . .

1341
02:14:54,406 --> 02:14:56,283
I will ensure you are punished.

1342
02:14:56,406 --> 02:15:00,524
Champalal, your this
desire will never be fulfilled.

1343
02:15:00,806 --> 02:15:03,273
This matter will not reach court.

1344
02:15:03,806 --> 02:15:06,798
I will kill the one who does so.

1345
02:15:34,806 --> 02:15:36,205
I have come to
ask something from you.

1346
02:15:36,806 --> 02:15:37,794
Ask.

1347
02:15:38,806 --> 02:15:41,525
First promise me.
- Promise what?

1348
02:15:41,806 --> 02:15:44,273
You won't publish anything
about those drugs.

1349
02:15:46,806 --> 02:15:51,276
Geeta, you are my life.
And this is my duty.

1350
02:15:51,806 --> 02:15:53,797
Please don't create
a clash between the two.

1351
02:15:54,286 --> 02:15:57,801
Atleast think of daddy.
He is very upset.

1352
02:16:01,806 --> 02:16:02,794
I am helpless.

1353
02:16:02,886 --> 02:16:05,275
You know he has never
interfered in Lalchand's affairs.

1354
02:16:05,806 --> 02:16:07,797
If you publish anything,
even daddy will be in trouble.

1355
02:16:07,886 --> 02:16:11,595
And he is innocent.
- Then who is the culprit?

1356
02:16:13,806 --> 02:16:16,273
That blind father who lost his son?

1357
02:16:16,806 --> 02:16:18,797
You hold no value for someone's life?

1358
02:16:19,286 --> 02:16:23,279
I didn't say that.
Why don't you try to understand me?

1359
02:16:24,806 --> 02:16:26,797
Why can't you hear
the pleas of the hapless . . .

1360
02:16:26,886 --> 02:16:28,683
who have been given tears
instead of smiles?

1361
02:16:28,806 --> 02:16:30,683
Who will wipe their tears?

1362
02:16:30,806 --> 02:16:33,273
And if anything happens to you,
who will wipe my tears?

1363
02:16:34,806 --> 02:16:38,685
Lalchand is after your life. He has
threatened that if you publish . . .

1364
02:16:38,806 --> 02:16:42,799
Death comes only once in life, Geeta.
It will come when it has to.

1365
02:16:44,526 --> 02:16:47,279
Where are you going?
- To meet Lalchand.

1366
02:16:47,806 --> 02:16:48,795
To take his statement.

1367
02:16:50,806 --> 02:16:55,800
I won't let you go.
- This life is worthless, Geeta.

1368
02:16:56,286 --> 02:16:58,277
Dying for truth is life.

1369
02:16:58,806 --> 02:17:00,797
And I like only such life.

1370
02:17:00,886 --> 02:17:03,798
That moment is auspicious
when you were born.

1371
02:17:03,886 --> 02:17:04,875
Mr. Chatterjee.

1372
02:17:06,806 --> 02:17:11,800
Lalchand had called.
He has asked the price for truth.

1373
02:17:11,886 --> 02:17:14,798
That's what I am going to give.
- You won't go alone.

1374
02:17:15,286 --> 02:17:17,277
Even I'll come along.
- Let's go.

1375
02:17:24,286 --> 02:17:25,275
Don't worry, dear.

1376
02:17:46,806 --> 02:17:47,795
You are here?

1377
02:17:47,886 --> 02:17:50,195
Vijay has gone to meet Lalchand.
- Why did you let him go there?

1378
02:17:50,286 --> 02:17:52,277
I tried stopping him,
but he wouldn't listen.

1379
02:17:52,606 --> 02:17:55,279
Hurry up, daddy.
What if something happens to him?

1380
02:18:04,286 --> 02:18:05,275
You?

1381
02:18:06,046 --> 02:18:08,196
I have come to take
Lalchand's statement.

1382
02:18:08,286 --> 02:18:11,675
What if he kills you
before you take his statement?

1383
02:18:11,806 --> 02:18:13,285
Heed my advice and go back.

1384
02:18:14,286 --> 02:18:15,799
I am not afraid of death.

1385
02:18:15,886 --> 02:18:18,798
Even you are an
idiot like your father.

1386
02:18:18,886 --> 02:18:21,275
It was my duty to explain.
The choice is yours.

1387
02:18:21,526 --> 02:18:26,280
Where is Lalchand?
- There is still time. Run away!

1388
02:18:26,806 --> 02:18:29,274
I have not come here to run away,
but to get him arrested.

1389
02:18:29,606 --> 02:18:30,799
The manager has told me everything.

1390
02:18:32,286 --> 02:18:35,675
The spurious drugs are not made
in the factory, they are made here.

1391
02:18:35,806 --> 02:18:38,274
So the manager told you everything?

1392
02:18:38,406 --> 02:18:40,203
I'll deal with him later.

1393
02:18:40,286 --> 02:18:43,278
But after seeing all this,
you won't return alive from here.

1394
02:18:43,806 --> 02:18:46,274
My death will not
kill the truth, Lalchand.

1395
02:18:46,686 --> 02:18:49,279
A thousand more Vijays' will be born.
- I will kill them all.

1396
02:18:49,406 --> 02:18:50,805
I will eliminate everyone
who comes in my way.

1397
02:18:50,886 --> 02:18:54,276
The law will eliminate you.
- Before that, I will kill you.

1398
02:19:03,286 --> 02:19:04,275
You monster!

1399
02:19:13,806 --> 02:19:16,798
You are the monster.
You snatched my love from me.

1400
02:19:16,886 --> 02:19:19,275
You snatched my happiness.
And now you are beating my father?

1401
02:20:15,806 --> 02:20:16,795
Now die!

1402
02:23:38,806 --> 02:23:40,285
Your tomb will be made here.

1403
02:23:55,806 --> 02:23:59,276
Son ! Kishore! Open your eyes.

1404
02:23:59,806 --> 02:24:04,800
I killed a poor man's son.
I have been punished for my sin.

1405
02:24:13,806 --> 02:24:17,685
I arrest you.
- Inspector, hang me.

1406
02:24:17,806 --> 02:24:21,799
I killed innocents.
I made spurious drugs.

1407
02:24:21,886 --> 02:24:23,797
Give me the severest of punishment.

1408
02:24:24,286 --> 02:24:28,802
Mr. Chatterjee. . . Mr. Chatterjee.

1409
02:24:33,286 --> 02:24:35,277
Lalchand has been arrested.

1410
02:24:36,526 --> 02:24:38,517
The path you have taken . . .

1411
02:24:42,806 --> 02:24:44,285
don't ever leave it.

1412
02:24:45,806 --> 02:24:52,803
You are alone today.
More people will join you tomorrow.

1413
02:24:56,806 --> 02:25:01,800
Come close, son.

1414
02:25:15,806 --> 02:25:20,800
Vijay, these are flowers that spread
more fragrance after they wither away.

1415
02:25:21,286 --> 02:25:25,802
They are lamps that blow off
after lighting several others.

1416
02:25:26,286 --> 02:25:30,806
Their flame is eternal.
Those who carry it are immortal.

1417
02:25:30,806 --> 02:25:34,799
Son, hereafter,
whatever you wish will be done.
