1
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:34,361
What is all this drama? Why
did you call me here then? - What?

2
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,935
Did you bring that? - What?

3
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,438
Brinjal...
- Yes... I'll show you

4
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,505
Wait...
I'll make a curry out of it

5
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,774
Don't make a scene.
Tell me if you've brought it

6
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,817
Will you speak up

7
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,543
What? Flavoured milk?

8
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,548
Is this our honeymoon?

9
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,588
And even in honeymoons
there's nothing like this

10
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:59,955
It only happens in movies

11
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,891
And its outdated even there now...!

12
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:04,522
Come to me now...

13
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm not talking of that - Then?

14
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,473
The raincoat thing...? - Yes

15
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,940
That's no fun.

16
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:18,972
I'll get you some pills - No pills

17
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:21,536

Let's have a complete blast

67
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,758
You are crazy with love;
and so am I

68
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,856
The whole world is jealous

69
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,719
But we don't bother about them

70
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,619
I am a complete dasher like Romeo

71
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,456
And your beauty,
my love, is like Juliet's

72
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:31,595
Your romance is
making me intoxicated

73
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,895
I am all in love with your style

74
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:39,504
Let's swing;
let's enjoy; let's sing

75
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:43,770
Let us fly the birds of love

76
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:47,779
Come into my arms;
don't go far away

77
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,712
No my love,
I don't want this intoxication

78
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,946
My heart is beating fast

79
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,913
Let's have a complete blast

80
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,946
You are crazy with love;
and so am I

81
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,391
There are bells ringing in my head

82
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,791
Let's have a complete blast

83
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,854
You are crazy with love;
and so am I

84
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,424
The whole world is jealous

85
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,904
Let's have a complete blast

86
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,905
You are crazy with love;
and so am I

87
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:17,568
There are bells ringing in my head

88
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,935
Let's have a complete blast

89
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,907
You are crazy with love;
and so am I

90
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,350
The whole world is jealous

91
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,616
Raghya, we've reached.

92
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:39,695
Hey hero, we've reached.
- Hm

93
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,434
Where's the shooting
happening here?

94
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,595
It happens there inside...

95
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:46,502
Then let's go in

96
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:47,562
Balya, you go now

97
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,403
In any case,
they won't allow you to enter

98
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,303
What? So I can't see your shoot?

99
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,572
Next week we'll be
shooting in our village,

100
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,379
you guys can watch it there.

101
00:08:58,585 --> 00:08:59,916
What use is that of?

102
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,750
I got this motorbike from
Janya to come for the shooting

103
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,757
I fought with his wife...
lied to Darshana...

104
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:06,985
And Raghya, you had promised me

105
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,659
Yes, yes, I've heard all that

106
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,721
You can't speak out
what you do for friends

107
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:15,566
And shootings are damn boring

108
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:17,734
Later you'll accuse
me of wasting your time

109
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:20,272
And say that you
had a lot of other work

110
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:25,674
So I should go?

111
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,576
Go... it's getting late

112
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,573
Best of luck... best luck

113
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,248
We'll meet later
- Yes, see you

114
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:39,882
Ride safely...

115
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,655
Okay... say 'Hi' to your heroine

116
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:56,740
Welcome...
superstar Raghunath Hiwale...

117
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:58,976
I have been calling you.

118
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,943
Is this your call time?

119
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,003
No, no...

120
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:03,044
The shooting has started!

121
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:03,907
Has it?

122
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,781
Yes and you are late...?

123
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,882
You can only bluff...

124
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,616
I should not have
done you this favour!

125
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,748
Don't say like this...

126
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,849
Do you think everyone
is going to wait for you?

127
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:19,627
Sir, it took time to
shave and colour my hair

128
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,666
That's all

129
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,961
And I almost got bald

130
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,832
And was about to
color my face balck

131
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,900
Dreaming of becoming a Hero...

132
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:28,571
Hurry up now

133
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,809
And stand in the last row...

134
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:37,380
Dreams of a hero
and infact is a big zero

135
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,058
You added too much water into it

136
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,600
The paint should be thicker

137
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,801
See, one can't read that line

138
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,735
I can't read in any case

139
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:00,864
And you don't teach me

140
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,842
I've been painting since
I was wetting my pants.

141
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,336
What's next...

142
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,018
An educated girl leads to progress!

143
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,818
Blood donation is
the greatest donation!

144
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,561
Sunday is for Pulse Polio!

145
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,998
The State Welfare Minister
is coming for a visit

146
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,727
We have to do a public
awakening in the district

147
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,736
What's all this Purshottam?

148
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,304
Why bring all this
rubbish to Kulpe?

149
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:35,739
Everyone is wide awake here

150
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,738
What new awakening do you want?

151
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,710
I'm in charge of
Kulpe and Mandavwadi

152
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,939
Sarpanch (Village Head),
we've to do free blood donation...

153
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:47,453
...and a street play in order to
awaken people through entertainment

154
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,713
A Pulse Polio drive for the kids

155
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,586
These three programmes are must...

156
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,586
Oh, and one more thing...
for the youth

157
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,389
And for those who
think they're still young

158
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,726
Free distribution of CONDOMS!

159
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,398
What this for?

160
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,794
Of What use is it here?

161
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,894
You need that for awakening

162
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,638
But what's its use in our village?

163
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,271
Kids go fool around
in the fields...

164
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,867
You never know when
one is in and out of them

165
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,468
They are very fast
and discreet about it...

166
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,343
And who has the time...

167
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:20,409
Public will buy a cigarette
or a beedi instead of these

168
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:23,512
That too if some
one else pays for them

169
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,583
The government too
is giving these free now

170
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,526
Once people get used to it,
they buy it

171
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:33,454
Have you heard of anyone having
a bath with a towel wrapped around

172
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,659
What do you say Appa?

173
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:38,067
I am getting what you are saying

174
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,830
But you're right
Sarpanch (village head)

175
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:41,931
What's right?

176
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:42,940
What's right?

177
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,909
The population is rising...

178
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,537
Then advocate vasectomy.

179
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,577
Nobody understands this stuff here.

180
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:50,980
Its not just that...

181
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:54,986
Sarpanch... This international
disease called AIDS is here

182
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:59,621
One just has to mention it to
get grants from all over the world

183
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:02,354
Look Sarpanch,
we have a huge budget passed...

184
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,821
So you co-operate with me
and I will return the favor...

185
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:09,400
Pick some enterprising kids from your
village kulpe and get them to assist you

186
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:10,467
Makes sense?

187
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:21,542
Hey, where were you?

188
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,775
We had decided to
meet at the bus stand

189
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,808
See what I've brought, Darshana

190
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,410
See this

191
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,352
See this

192
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:42,792
its for you...

193
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,803
I've brought your
beauty parlour stuff

194
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,372
Burn it... or sell it

195
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,977
Brought my stuff?
How long did you take?

196
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,378
Had lots of things going around?

197
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:59,779
Yes of course...
You have a finger in so many pies

198
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,952
You can't handle this Bakul.
Let call it off...

199
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:05,252
Hey... hey... hey...
why are you doing this?

200
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,891
We're meeting after so many days

201
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,620
And I have to spend
time just reasoning with you

202
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,425
So who's asking you
to waste your time on me?

203
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,523
I have work in the farm. I'm going

204
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:17,628
Hey...

205
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,369
Hey Darshana...

206
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,506
Wait, I'm coming

207
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,805
Wait, I'm coming

208
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,640
Hey, I love you

209
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:36,946
Show me the answer
to the fifth question

210
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:40,288
I won't show you.
Now shut up and let me write

211
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,495
Shirya, hey Shirya

212
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,302
What?

213
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,671
Give me the answer
to the fifth question!

214
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,403
Give me the answer
to the second question!

215
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,007
No, I don't know it

216
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:14,793
Please tell me

217
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,020
Or give me your answer sheet

218
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,388
Sir will come.
Go back to your seat.

219
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:25,869
Mukund Borate, what are you doing?

220
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,372
Nothing Sir... I dropped my pen...

221
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,966
Can't hold a pen right
and want to appear for the exam

222
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,443
Go to your seat

223
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:50,819
Darshana listen to me... go go
don't waste your time behind me...

224
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:55,799
you have a lot of work isn't it...

225
00:15:55,868 --> 00:16:00,737
...yes I am going to be
a big man you wait and watch...

226
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,769
Now what have you dropped?

227
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,865
I dropped the pen
on the other side, Sir.

228
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:35,835
Give me your pen

229
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,841
Write the rest of the
paper with your fingers.

230
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:47,645
Why waste your time
looking for your pen...

231
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,559
Chapati (flatbread)...

232
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:02,523
wait one second...

233
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,332
Those wedding guys
are asking for a refund

234
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,678
There's no bride and
groom in the wedding video

235
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,581
You know what, they were
surrounded by lots of women...

236
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,481
When I tried to squeeze in,
the women looked at me angrily

237
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,351
And you know me.
I keep a distance from women

238
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,924
Yes, I know
- Yes... so...

239
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:34,894
So I stood far away
and shot whatever I could...

240
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:36,592
...standing on a chair

241
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,330
Then how would the
bride and groom be seen

242
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,901
Why do you blame me unnecessarily?

243
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,283
And who is this beauty queen?

244
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,286
Is she the bride?

245
00:17:58,657 --> 00:17:59,988
Oh hell!

246
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,230
That Pundalik made
a mess I suppose...

247
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:20,979
Pundalik?
He messed up or you goofed up?

248
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:23,642
Hey, please don't doubt me

249
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,844
This dancer woman is
a famous star in Kolhapur

250
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:28,443
Why would she bother about me?

251
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,512
You know how it is?
- What?

252
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,251
When I shoot...
- Yes

253
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,851
Pundalik lines it up
- Hm

254
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,954
Something must have gone wrong
while arranging and rearranging it...

255
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,860
That Pundalik is one fool...

256
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,626
And you doubt me!

257
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,403
How will you get
jobs in this manner?

258
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,272
How long we'll have to
stay in this tiny Mandvewadi?

259
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,641
You had shown me such
big dreams when we got married!

260
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,305
Be a little patient...

261
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,283
There's a job in Kolhapur

262
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,649
When that is done, I'll pour
heaps of money in front of you!

263
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,651
Yes, you can't even get work here

264
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,485
Who's going to give
you a job in Kolhapur?

265
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,620
You know that friend of mine?
- Who?

266
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,328
Bakul Chinchuke

267
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,296
He has a friend...

268
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,459
...who is going to put in a word for me
- That guy?

269
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes

270
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:17,360
That liar from Kulpe?

271
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:22,464
He doesn't lie to me.
He said he'd help me out he will

272
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,532
Oh really?
Our bike is still with him

273
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,905
It's been a week.
He hasn't returned it yet

274
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,438
He said he'll give it back tomorrow

275
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,709
Go watch your face in the mirror...

276
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,717
Don't depend on that liar

277
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:38,312
He'll eat the fruit
and leave you with the seeds

278
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,693
And the heroine's father...
the villain himself...

279
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,664
...grabs his daughter's hand...

280
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,758
...and drags her away

281
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:51,632
Keep quiet...

282
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,431
The hero is watching all this

283
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,707
He is about to rescue her

284
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,970
Just then,
her father's hired goons...

285
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,946
...approach him with sticks in hand

286
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,355
Oh shucks...

287
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,685
Not me...
it's my dummy lying on the floor

288
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,922
I'm sitting under
the shade drinking juice

289
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,657
Great... and then

290
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,894
And then we arrive at the
steps of the heroine's house

291
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:22,763
Wow!!!

292
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,393
And then the hero, that is me...

293
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,735
...runs up to her house and stops

294
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:29,797
The heroine...
for instance Balya...

295
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,839
The heroine is sitting
and shedding tears for me

296
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,470
Raghya...
- The heroine...

297
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:35,571
Watch out...

298
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,946
I thrash them all

299
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,916
Dhishoom... dhishoom... dishoom

300
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,752
I'm standing under the balcony

301
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,619
And then from the stairs
next to the balcony...

302
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:49,491
...I climb up very fast...

303
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,325
...and I call out to the heroine

304
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,361
Baba(The father)...
- Go away!!!

305
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:56,093
What?

306
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:58,495
And then I hold her hand

307
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:02,803
And I take her down
the same staircase

308
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,374
She looks back once

309
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:10,047
Her father is standing
in the balcony wiping his tears

310
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,550
Wonderful Raghya... I love it

311
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:19,488
Slowly, I leave for
the village with her

312
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:21,787
And then in the village...
- What?

313
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,024
All my friends are waiting for me

314
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,663
As soon as they see me...

315
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,533
...they lift me up

316
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:34,639
Hey, lift me up

317
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,302
And then our song...

318
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,936
Raghya, wonderful Raghya.

319
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,267
Raghya
- Yes

320
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,778
You dance so well... you act so well

321
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,382
You should be the hero of this film!
Isn't it Mukya?

322
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,008
Yes, that's true

323
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:21,877
Can anyone speak
like what you do...?

324
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,852
That idiot hero from your last film

325
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:28,450
He can't speak or dance

326
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,894
He just shook his butt with
the item girl. Is that dancing?

327
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:38,362
Yes, but he still is the hero

328
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,340
But wait and watch Balya.

329
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,673
A day will come...

330
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,949
My father, who ushers people
with a torch to their seats...

331
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,819
...will sit in those
seats and watch my film

332
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,255
Superstar Raghunath Hiwale!

333
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,988
Raghya, your heroine will
cling to you and ask for a kiss

334
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,333
And then your song in the rain

335
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,891
People will be crazy
for your love scenes

336
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,869
Crowds at the ticket window

337
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:15,839
Then I'll sell tickets in black...

338
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:19,969
I'll do so much business
that I'll produce your next film

339
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:23,744
And what about your admissions'
business and other things?

340
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,613
You stupid chap!
- What?

341
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:27,777
One must never have
only one business...

342
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,821
Take out a second from
the first A third from the second

343
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:30,981
That's how it should be

344
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,957
Raghya,
I'll do such big business...

345
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,391
...that this entire Kulpe
village will crowd around me...

346
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,793
...like ants attracted to jaggery

347
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,761
But our friendship will not change

348
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:43,825
And Mukund will get tales of our
friendship published in the papers...

349
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:44,834
Oh really?

350
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:47,838
One businessman and one
superstar - Superstar...

351
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:50,932
Two heroes from the same
village Headlights in the papers

352
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:55,674
Not headlight Balya... headline

353
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,807
Mukund will sort that out

354
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,942
Why else did I get him
admission in the college?

355
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,246
If he is educated,
it's like us being educated

356
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:05,415
Isn't it Mukya?
- What?

357
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:08,256
What Mukya?

358
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:10,487
Mukya, whats wrong... why
are you quiet?

359
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,530
I'm going to fail again
- What?

360
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,962
I just couldn't remember anything

361
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,567
I kept thinking of a story as usual
- Then?

362
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:28,475
Then what? I wrote it down.

363
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:33,042
And also a postscript - "If
you like the story, please pass me"

364
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,648
If he likes the story...

365
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,824
...Mukya...

366
00:25:03,982 --> 00:25:05,006
Congratulations

367
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,385
It's friends like
you that make life fun

368
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,554
Otherwise,
what does this village have for us?

369
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:14,891
Raghya, Mukya, lets go to Kolhapur

370
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,023
There's a show by item girl Rakhi.
Let's go see it

371
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,388
Kolhapur?
- Yes.

372
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:20,931
Not me. My father will beat me up

373
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,591
Who is going to tell him?

374
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:23,794
I'll take you there and
bring you back like a trick...

375
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:27,738
But the tickets? Who's got money?

376
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:29,764
We'll see. We'll manage something

377
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:31,030
Days, months have passed;
but you don't care

378
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:34,966
I am full of youth;
how long can I wait?

379
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,409
Now what will happen to me

380
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:43,874
Press the button
on your mobile phone

381
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:47,612

And speak to me in
the language of love

384
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:59,286
Hey man, understand her confusion

385
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:04,233
Now what will happen to her?

386
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,837

00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:12,365

And speak to her

There are others who romance her

391
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,585
Others who pine for her

392
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:26,817
Just see how gracefully she walks

393
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:28,519
lts like a celestial
goddess has arrived

394
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,527
There are others who romance her

395
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:32,029
Others who pine for her

396
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:34,026
Just see how gracefully she walks

397
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,494
lts like a celestial
goddess has arrived

398
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:56,919
I sent you so many messages

399
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,789
I cant live without you

400
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,625
I sent you so many messages

401
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:08,598
I cant live without you

402
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,567
All the seasons are going to waste

403
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:12,934
My body aches for you

404
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:19,937
My mind is going crazy;
please hurry up, my love

405
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:23,539
Charge your phone...

406
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:27,685
Charge your phone;
make a missed call at least

407
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:32,520
Tell me, how do I live alone

408
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:39,428
Please press your mobile button

409
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:42,729

Please press your mobile button

And speak to me with love

412
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:54,638
I haven't heard your
voice in a long time

413
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:59,844
Why have you forgotten me?

414
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:04,277
Please press your mobile button

415
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,951

416
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:11,923

And speak to me with love

418
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:26,935
Balya...
- What?

419
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:27,944
At least tell us what to do

420
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,878
Nothing. You just register

421
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:32,416
I'll do the work.
Don't ask or say anything

422
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:36,979
Sarpanch Sir...

423
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,813
Can I come in?
- Come in Bakul

424
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:40,858
Nana told me about
the distribution...

425
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,517
These two will also distribute
- Okay

426
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,563
Mukunda will distribute
in college and

427
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,927
Raghu will come with me

428
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,431
That's good!

429
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,799
We sould have the maximum numbers
of condoms distributed in our village...

430
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,700
Yes, of course

431
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,762
Give two per house if you like

432
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,409
There's at least
one affair in each house

433
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:01,710
Appa...
- Yes?

434
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,769
Note down his name

435
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,280
And give him all the stuff
- Okay.

436
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,319
Bakul, remember,
not a single pack should come back!

437
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,479
Fine

438
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,052
Name...?

439
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,761
Bakul Chinchuke...

440
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,990
Bakul Chinchuke... Age?
- 21

441
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:24,794
Good!

442
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,404
One... two... three...
four Five and five, ten

443
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:32,068
And one... two...
three... four, that's 15

444
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:36,007
Raghya here you go, one...
two... three... four

445
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:40,848
Mukya, take them...
let's get going now.

446
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:45,756
Balya, if anyone asks
what's this what do we say?

447
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,325
Raghya, what's written on the pack?

448
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,686
Mukya, what's written on the pack?

449
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:54,964
Kamasutra!

450
00:30:58,069 --> 00:30:59,934
"For the Pleasure of Making Love"

451
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:02,805
What does it mean?

452
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,034
Means... it's fun

453
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,606
Oh that's great

454
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,974
We'll say that Sarpanch
has given fun in a pack

455
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:10,940
Use it and see

456
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:12,916
If you don't like it,
return the pack

457
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,280
What do you mean "Don't like it?"

458
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:15,453
Is this a chocolate?

459
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,818
Balya, but what are they for?

460
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,921
It prevents kids being born

461
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,825
Hell... then who will use them?

462
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:27,831
But I don't understand...
Why not have kids?

463
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,660
Is it a sin?

464
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:33,032
No not that...
now take our Dhana Kadam for example

465
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,472
He's always on edge

466
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,468
He must be relieving
himself everyday

467
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,343
So he has a flock of
kids and a worn-out wife

468
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:43,403
Worn-out...

469
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:49,048
And one uses condoms to prevent that

470
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:50,953
Then what is AIDS?

471
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:54,391
When I went to Mumbai,
I had heard about it

472
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,652
I thought it must
be some Mumbai special

473
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:57,717
May be.

474
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,524
In Mumbai, spacing between
births must be called AIDS

475
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,298
Every town has its own language

476
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,459
Keep quiet

477
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,731
This Mukya talks rot

478
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,302
Just because he's
a little educated...

479
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,033
...he says what he wants

480
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:11,400
Then sit down...
...and make balloons out of this

481
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,510
Like our college guys do

482
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:15,473
There are lots of
balloons in the toilet

483
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,502
Let it be

484
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:18,348
Let's distribute them first

485
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:19,710
When it's done,
we'll meet here. Okay?

486
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:20,773
Raghya, you go northwards...

487
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:22,615
Mukya, you go to the
college and I'll go downwards

488
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:23,551
Go now

489
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:24,913
Let's go...

490
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:08,430
Hey wait, I'll give to all.

491
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,831
One by one... here... here...

492
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:11,765
Brother...

493
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:12,461
What?

494
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:14,266
I want to give you this packet

495
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:15,806
But the marriage isn't over yet

496
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,002
I won't have time later

497
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,439
I see

498
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:19,875
Yes... yes...

499
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:20,706
Put it in my pocket

500
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:21,837
In your pocket?

501
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,904
Yes, put it

502
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:28,947
It's done.

503
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,884
Have you written the names?

504
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:33,515
Everything is written on it.
- See you!

505
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,359
Yes...

506
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:40,787
What packets were you
distributing in college?

507
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,555
Your principal came home

508
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:47,688
You put these terrible
packs in his office?

509
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:49,893
You go to college
to learn all this do you?

510
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,698
No more college for you from today

511
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:53,829
Please don't do that...

512
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,031
Bappa(Father) please listen

513
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,466
I've been warning you but...

514
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,065
...you have the brains of an ox

515
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,674
You have just grown horns

516
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:00,836
...and no sense at all.

517
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:03,312
But Bappa, everyone had to
distribute them in the village...

518
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,679
It's for public
awakening in the village

519
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,442
You idiot...

520
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,750
What do you have to do with
public awakening in the village?

521
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,619
Don't try to fool me

522
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:17,521
You do all this rubbish
because of that Balya and Raghya

523
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,688
Just remember...

524
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:22,631
If I see you with that
pair of bullocks again...

525
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,894
...I'll skin you alive...

526
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,459
...And throw you
in this wrestling pit

527
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:27,436
Understand?

528
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,335
Please don't

529
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,305
No college for you from today!

530
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:30,932
No college!

531
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:31,907
Please don't...

532
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:32,772
No college!

533
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:33,868
Bappa, listen to me...

534
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:35,775
Please Bappa...

535
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,712
Bappa...

536
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,655
The Parrot sings sweet and bright,
Lets give aids a very good fight...

537
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:50,956
Use the condom and live life
healthy responsible and right.

538
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,522
Rolling
- Action

539
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:56,931
Help... help... help

540
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,026
Cut... cut... cut... come back

541
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:05,275
What is this... they have abducted
the heroine seven or eight times

542
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,701
Won't they be getting bored of it...

543
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:10,779
We must ask Raghya...

544
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,439
Can't see Ragya anywhere

545
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:15,816
You won't.
He must be putting on make-up

546
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:17,320
Over there... in that bus

547
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,317
Shit...
That huge bus is for Raghya?

548
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:23,451
Then what? Our Raghya is a hero
- Silence

549
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:28,321
Shit... they are shouting here.
Let's go there

550
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,696
They're not stopping anyone there

551
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:35,406
Where are you going Balya?
- To that bus

552
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:38,306
Why?
- I don't understand Mukya...

553
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,010
...why do these people have such
a huge bus to paint their faces?

554
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,911
They could stand, look in
a mirror and colour their faces

555
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:47,274
No no Balya... there must
be something else in this bus

556
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,009
See, there are lights inside

557
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,347
Let's go in and see

558
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:54,982
Has a mad dog...
- Shh...

559
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,627
Has a mad dog bitten you?
- Why?

560
00:36:57,695 --> 00:36:59,629
Balya, as it is I'm risking
my life coming here with you

561
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:01,358
If my father gets to know,
I'll be finished

562
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:02,490
So you don't get ideas, okay?

563
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,730
You know what I'm thinking

564
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:09,872
Raghya keeps talking about
affairs between heroes and heroines

565
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,777
They must be using this bus for that

566
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,817
Let's go in and see

567
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:36,523
Thank God we got away;
that ass came after us

568
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,964
Where is he?
- I don't know

569
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:49,469
Hey... he's coming

570
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,350
Shh... quiet

571
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:10,393
Shit! Not even a dog
had pissed on me so far...

572
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:11,560
and now this guy...

573
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:13,631
Hey... we'll be spotted

574
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,965
Balya, let's go

575
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:16,667
Raghya is not to be seen

576
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,471
He must be inside the bus.
Let's go in

577
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:20,476
He'll work out something for us

578
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:21,842
And if someone stops us?

579
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,710
Why would they?

580
00:38:24,782 --> 00:38:28,479
We'll just go to the
bus before anyone can ask...

581
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,986
We'll just open the door and go in

582
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,345
Raghya must be inside

583
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:34,816
Once we meet him,
nobody will dare to stop us

584
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,658
Come on!

585
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:54,901
Hell... There's nobody here...
It's a complete house

586
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,383
And a bathroom to
take a bath too...!

587
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,442
It's superb!

588
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:17,360
It's superb!

589
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,734
It's really great Mukya;
it's wonderful

590
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:23,432
Balya, there's a script here
- Then read it

591
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:28,002
Wait... The heroine
screams 'Help! ' and runs

592
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,539
The villain chases
her and the police arrive

593
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,912
Mukya, this is what
they are shooting!

594
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:38,580
You go that side... you go there

595
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,920
You go back... and you in front

596
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,422
Watch the camera

597
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:49,330
I had a great bath
- Really?

598
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,800
The soap is so expensive
- I'll bathe too

599
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,598
It's like rosewater
- Yes... yes... yes

600
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,866
Go in quickly; it's great
- Yes... yes... yes

601
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:59,004
Sir, I'll just go
to the vanity van - Okay

602
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,566
Balya... towel

603
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:01,634
Take this

604
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,878
Come on... Out... You too

605
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,356
What were you doing inside?

606
00:40:15,426 --> 00:40:16,791
Sir, we really didn't know anything

607
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,294
We just came to visit...
and we thought...

608
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:19,420
To visit? You wished to steal

609
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:20,987
No... no...
not to steal... to see the shooting

610
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,692
Let's put them in police custody

611
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,029
Please don't... no police

612
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,770
Why the Police? We'll just
break their limbs ourselves!

613
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:27,566
That will teach them!

614
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:30,038
No... no Sir...
we came to see the shooting

615
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,372
Raghya is our friend...
he's the hero of this film

616
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,707
What... Who is Raghya?

617
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,973
Here he is...
This is our friend Raghya

618
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,641
They are not thieves... they
are my friends - Yes... yes...

619
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:40,377
Your friends?
- What happened Sir?

620
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,681
Who do you think you are?
- What happened? What did they do?

621
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,416
They were bathing
in the heroine's room

622
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,821
Why were you bathing?

623
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:48,085
We thought it was your room

624
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,657
Is it their private property?

625
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:52,491
No no Sir

626
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,087
Now take them and scram - Okay Sir

627
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:57,425
And if I see you here again...

628
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:01,569
Come here...
Take off your costume...

629
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:07,039
...take your friends and
get out of here - Please don't Sir

630
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,776
Who asked you to interfere?

631
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:45,705
Why did you come there?

632
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,578
How would we know whose room it was?

633
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,345
I was telling him...

634
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:52,714
"We should go back"

635
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,817
But he didn't listen;
he dragged me inside

636
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,962
Now I don't dare to return home

637
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,696
If I go half-naked like this,
my father will kill me

638
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,490
Balya, now take
me home to your place

639
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:06,901
Don't cry like a girl

640
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,402
Look, I'll put you back
in the dark like I took you away

641
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,339
...before anyone finds out...

642
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,674
My life is in a mess

643
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,278
You guys have other concerns

644
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,647
But Raghya,
why did they take your clothes?

645
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,044
Aren't you the hero?

646
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,056
Hero?

647
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:26,881
Yes...

648
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:28,355
My foot!

649
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:34,629
I just stand behind the hero

650
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,904
Hell... now my clothes are gone.

651
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,508
And I'm finished too

652
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:49,736
I've lost my job and my dignity

653
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:51,782
Why? How can that be?

654
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:52,879
It's gone...

655
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,677
What if they took away your clothes!

656
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,515
But how can they take
away your inborn art?

657
00:42:56,587 --> 00:42:57,519
Isn't it Mukya?

658
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,583
Now we'll stand on our own feet

659
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:02,591
Enough of this nonsense!

660
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:05,825
I've dared to do things
in front of my father...

661
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,762
...my teachers. What happened?

662
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,893
Not that, guys...
we three were all separate so far.

663
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:13,998
Now we must work together

664
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:14,829
Mukya's education...

665
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:15,668
...Raghya's talent...

666
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,468
...and my intelligence

667
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,802
We must combine all three

668
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:23,972
So Mr. Bakul, what exactly do we do?
Pull a heist?

669
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:27,415
Yes, we entered one
bus and lost our clothes

670
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:28,711
A robbery will make us...

671
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:29,753
...lose our lives

672
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:32,046
And my father will chop me
up into pieces in the wrestling pit

673
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,881
This guy sings just one tune

674
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,487
No, forget it.

675
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,553
I will go and apologize
to our production manager

676
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:43,496
Let me see what happens

677
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:47,061
No begging pardon!

678
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:48,464
You are a smart ass!

679
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,038
Nobody will offer me a role again

680
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:52,037
And you don't want me to apologise -
So what if you don't get a role...

681
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,800
You know, what I feel

682
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:56,870
What use is this job where
you're not given any respect

683
00:43:57,048 --> 00:43:59,846
You're a 1000 times more
handsome than that stupid hero

684
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:00,781
Tens of such heroines...

685
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,341
...will hover around you

686
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,284
Let it be

687
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:04,412
If you lose one job,
you will get another

688
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,750
And if you don't,
we'll produce a film

689
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:06,619
You will be the hero

690
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,784
And we'll find a heroine
who will be better than this one

691
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:12,418
I'm leaving...

692
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:14,889
Today I'll suffer a beating

693
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,797
And tomorrow I'll eat
mud in the wrestling pit

694
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:17,765
Why?

695
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,963
If my father finds out
that we are producing a film

696
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,470
he will make me do just that

697
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,872
How will they know
unless you tell them?

698
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,607
That's it...

699
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:31,513
Got it...

700
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:34,675
I'm ready!

701
00:44:37,288 --> 00:44:38,482
Got it...

702
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:49,331
Cinema... Balya... Mukya...

703
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,058
We'll produce a film

704
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,036
Our film!

705
00:44:57,408 --> 00:44:58,966
I'm ready too brother

706
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:00,340
You will be the hero Mukya's script

707
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:01,503
And my intelligence

708
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:02,703
We'll make a super hit film

709
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,838
Better than theirs

710
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:04,676
No way...

711
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:05,773
I'm not in this

712
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,008
I can see my own film quite clearly

713
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:09,748
If I do a film with you...

714
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,253
...it'll be 'The End' for me

715
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,016
I won't join you

716
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:15,519
I see! So that's your friendship?

717
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:17,786
Raghya...
I've already done badly in the exam

718
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:20,463
Doing a film would mean going
from the frying pan into the fire

719
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,323
You do what you want; I won't join

720
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,962
Mukya... when you fail,
you will come to us for help

721
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:28,667
Okay... we'll see
- Yes

722
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:29,831
I'm not coming
- Hey

723
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:36,310
Shit!

724
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,859
Come see our play

725
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,399
A one paisa play!

726
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:58,662
Your play and ours

727
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,569
Come and see... this play

728
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,230
But what is the name of your play

729
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:05,667
A brake from the mind...

730
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:06,767
...is the best brake

731
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:08,243
A brake from the mind...

732
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:09,472
...is the best brake!

733
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:10,775
You and me

734
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:12,008
You and me

735
00:46:12,316 --> 00:46:14,409
I've kept one and a quarter
rupees in your honour

736
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:16,918
Tell these people about
the importance of AIDS

737
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:20,354
Tell these people about
the importance of AIDS

738
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:22,822
But who will tell us?

739
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:27,525
Our Aburao... and Khaburao

740
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:29,429
Aburao is here

741
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,592
And Khaburao is here too

742
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:31,635
Aburao is here

743
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:33,397
And Khaburao is here too

744
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,005
Namaskaar (Hello) all of you

745
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:36,671
Hello... hello

746
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,903
I am a very philosophical
man from this village

747
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:43,435
I'm Khaburao... and the crazy people
of this village think I'm clever

748
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:45,774
No not that... not that

749
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,909
I'm looking for my friend

750
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:49,043
My friend Aburao

751
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,287
I'm looking for him

752
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:51,548
Where is that guy?

753
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,952
Hey man, I've been looking
for you since morning

754
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:56,924
Where have you been?

755
00:46:56,994 --> 00:46:59,895
I was getting a shave
- From your wife?

756
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:01,726
How do you know?

757
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:03,824
From the blush on your face

758
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,391
Forget that

759
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:06,663
Tell me why you called me

760
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,671
Yes, I forgot... Listen...

761
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:11,708
What I'm saying...
we have to go to our village

762
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:14,266
Go to each house - Okay...

763
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:16,540
And start a public
awakening about AIDS

764
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:17,342
I see!

765
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:18,608
So let's do one thing

766
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:20,513
Let's take all these villagers along

767
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:21,482
Yes, let's...

768
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:23,019
So folks, will you come with us

769
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,447
Yes...!

770
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:26,490
Come on...

771
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:29,924
Tell them about
the importance of AIDS

772
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:34,727
So Mr. Barber... I believe your
blade is extra sharp. Is that true?

773
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:39,963
We must find out if his blades are
sharper or men's cheeks are softer

774
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,801
Oh I see Khaburao

775
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:43,862
Mr. Barber
- Yes

776
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:45,374
Tell me

777
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:48,309
You use one blade for four people

778
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:49,311
How come?

779
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,904
Yes how come?

780
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:53,776
One blade can shave four

781
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,011
So what?

782
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:57,014
So long as the shave gets done

783
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:57,913
I would say

784
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:01,219
I should do eight
shaves Not just four...

785
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:02,657
...with one blade

786
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:04,455
Eight shaves?

787
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,255
With one blade?

788
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,297
Yes

789
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:09,764
Tell me Mr. Barber

790
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,858
How many wives do you have?

791
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:16,367
What's that got to do with this?

792
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,840
Tell us,
are you interested in your wife?

793
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:19,739
What?

794
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,539
How many wives do you have?

795
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:23,235
That's what we are interested in

796
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:24,303
With the curse of God

797
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:25,473
Only one!

798
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:26,538
What did you say?

799
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:27,948
I meant, with God's grace!

800
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,747
Yes... and that bitch

801
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:31,379
...in the tent outside the village

802
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:33,616
You go to meet her secretly

803
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:34,749
You think I don't know

804
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:35,756
See

805
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:39,592
One blade and two shaves

806
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:40,721
What are you doing?

807
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,561
You are trying to shame me alone!

808
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:46,464
I've been married four years;
I have four kids

809
00:48:46,537 --> 00:48:47,504
You didn't take a break even once?

810
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:48,833
No I didn't

811
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:52,342
I was fed up having the
same bland food every day...

812
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:53,774
So what...

813
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:54,868
...what if i had something
spicy on my plate...

814
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:55,912
What's wrong with that?

815
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,880
I see! You want something spicy?

816
00:48:57,948 --> 00:48:59,540
Something spicy?

817
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:04,418
See folks Mr. Barber wants spice;
a change of taste

818
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:07,591
Should we say what others want?

819
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:08,649
Should we?
- No no

820
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:09,852
Should I tell?

821
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:14,489
No don't Khaburao.
The public knows everything

822
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,624
Yes the public...

823
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,863
...knows everything

824
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:21,862
Yes the public...

825
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,567
...knows everything

826
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:27,509
This is a delicate problem

827
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:28,641
The people...

828
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:30,374
The people are dim-witted

829
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:33,409
Khaburao, what are you saying?

830
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,918
The people will thrash us

831
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:37,010
What else?

832
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,413
Using one blade for
four shaves is wrong

833
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:43,324
And going to different
places for a change in taste...

834
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:44,258
...is also dangerous

835
00:49:44,328 --> 00:49:45,852
Shouldn't the people know that?

836
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:46,827
But Khaburao

837
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:48,831
I don't understand
what you are saying

838
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:51,459
Will you explain it properly?

839
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:53,264
In easy to understand...

840
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:55,498
...simple language

841
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:58,907
Avoid immoral
relationships Prevent AIDS

842
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:01,945
Avoid immoral
relationships Prevent AIDS

843
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:04,947
For good health, always eat at home

844
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,846
Don't eat stale food outside

845
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,578
Don't eat stale food outside

846
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:10,643
Don't eat stale food outside

847
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,784
When you donate and take
blood always check it...

848
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:16,519
...and use a fresh needle

849
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:18,527
Check the blood

850
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:20,426
And use a fresh needle

851
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:21,794
For safe sex

852
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,355
Use a condom

853
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,833
Use a condom!

854
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:26,426
Use a condom!

855
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,562
Use a condom!

856
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,478
The brake of the
mind is the best brake

857
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:37,844
The brake of the
mind is the best brake

858
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,024
So folks

859
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:51,084
Don't use a single
beak for 10 fruits

860
00:50:51,362 --> 00:50:53,057
That's not good

861
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,491
That's not good

862
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:57,500
If you sin...

863
00:50:57,568 --> 00:50:59,627
...everyone will suffer

864
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,762
Everyone will suffer

865
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,273
How can you tell?

866
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:06,809
Who is in the wrong?

867
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:11,713
In the throes of passion

868
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:13,409
You don't know what you're doing

869
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:15,748
You don't know what you're doing

870
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:30,766
I did say that

871
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:35,302
But I dreamt of the
whole film last night

872
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:43,069
I saw it all while I was sleeping

873
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,312
But I didn't find anything special

874
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:49,916
We need Mukya

875
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:52,387
Forget him

876
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:54,045
He won't come

877
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:56,650
He's a bloody turncoat

878
00:51:57,861 --> 00:51:59,089
It's like he's hit by a spark

879
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:01,888
That's it...
All we need is that 'spark'

880
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,324
To start the car

881
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:08,269
One push and then
I'll make the car run

882
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:12,537
Hey Mukya, where were you?

883
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:15,507
Forget that...
did you see the play yesterday?

884
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:16,679
You saw it?

885
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,847
Of course... I looked
all over for you in the crowd...

886
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:21,948
We thought you wouldn't come

887
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,613
We didn't see him... He is lying

888
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:26,280
Balya, I don't imitate others

889
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,288
Understand
- Yes

890
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:28,756
And Raghu, I've come to tell you

891
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,621
We will find our film story...

892
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:33,461
We'll find it?

893
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:35,562
How?

894
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:39,860
What if we do a film about AIDS?

895
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:02,456
Have you both gone mad?

896
00:53:02,759 --> 00:53:06,251
Just tell me...
has anyone with AIDS become famous?

897
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:08,431
Give me one name...
then I'll listen to you

898
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:09,825
As though anyone with
this kind of disease...

899
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,891
...would want to
announce it in the papers

900
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:13,564
You too Balya... really...

901
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,397
Were you seeing the play
or the girls in the play?

902
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,305
And who knows...

903
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:20,640
Famous people may not
even get this disease...

904
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:22,969
They must be using expensive condoms

905
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,776
You are absolutely
right there Raghya!

906
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:28,340
But if this is a hidden subject...

907
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:31,383
...then who would
see a film based on it?

908
00:53:32,055 --> 00:53:33,386
You were the one who said...

909
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:35,550
...that the story should
be such that everyone would love it

910
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:36,523
Mr. Bakul...

911
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,324
...your brain doesn't
seem to have ripened this year

912
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:43,660
Think... this disease happens
with relationships outside marriage

913
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:44,860
Didn't they say that?

914
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:45,799
Yes, so?

915
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:47,564
So the story has to have a woman

916
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,467
Not just one... but two...

917
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:53,375
Correct - May be even more

918
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,502
And we need a hero
to be with those women

919
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:56,568
Yes

920
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:00,549
Going from one woman
to the other means suspense

921
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,910
Then a lot of tension
when the disease happens

922
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:09,551
And a lot of crying when
they know why it has happened

923
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,451
So... so suspense

924
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,022
Tension

925
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:15,555
And tears!

926
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:21,760
All the ingredients
are mixing perfectly

927
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,297
Hey... you're right!

928
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:41,620
Guys listen;
now the main thing is remaining

929
00:54:41,692 --> 00:54:43,387
Hero and heroine?

930
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:45,357
That's easy. You are the hero

931
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:48,921
And any of our village girls
will be ready if it's a film

932
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,489
No, not that...

933
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,797
Money? Leave that to me

934
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:54,700
I'll work on that from today

935
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:56,830
I'll see how to get
hold of financers...

936
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,339
Not that either

937
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,474
The money will come...

938
00:55:06,984 --> 00:55:11,353
But where's the camera
and cameraman in our village?

939
00:55:11,488 --> 00:55:14,753
Oh shit... I forgot about that

940
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:16,753
That'll get done too

941
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,791
We have a camera and a cameraman...

942
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:19,725
Who?

943
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,954
Janardan from Mandavwadi.

944
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,594
That Janya?
- Of course!

945
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,927
Hey... we don't want stills

946
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:31,341
We need moving pictures

947
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:32,340
Yes!
- Yes!

948
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:35,568
That Janya can't even take
college identity photographs

949
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,841
He took mine for my identity card

950
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:39,939
You know what the
Registrar asked me?

951
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:41,314
If I had leukoderma...

952
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:43,319
That's an old story.

953
00:55:43,487 --> 00:55:47,514
Oh superstar,
he's bought a shooting camera now...

954
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:48,649
Trust me...

955
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:51,489
Shooting a film is not every Tom,
Dick and Harry's job Balya

956
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:53,320
Also, he should agree to do it

957
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:55,024
Let's ask him...

958
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:56,458
Maybe we'll get lucky.

959
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,433
Yes!

960
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:06,735
Will do...

961
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:15,413
Yes, a camera!

962
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:29,829
Then is that definite?

963
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,527
Is that definite?

964
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,398
Is it? Have you decided?

965
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:35,266
When I ask, you don't talk

966
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,465
If I don't speak,
you keep asking me things

967
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,372
And when you ask,
I don't want to reply

968
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:40,376
So how do we manage this?

969
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:42,342
You figure that out

970
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:43,673
Take that earlier photo gadget...

971
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:44,806
...and that contraption
for shooting...

972
00:56:44,915 --> 00:56:46,473
...and burn them
in the garbage dump

973
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:47,608
Both are useless and they are...

974
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:48,946
...just taking
up space in the house

975
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:51,749
Hey Priti...
- First get your bike back.

976
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:54,321
Why do you bring bike between?

977
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:57,824
What can I do if people
borrow my things...?

978
00:56:58,995 --> 00:56:59,859
Janabhau...

979
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:02,628
All okay?

980
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,496
You rascal...

981
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:06,331
What are you doing here?

982
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:07,802
Give me my bike at once!

983
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:08,997
Give me my bike

984
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:11,001
You swine, you...

985
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,242
Brother Janardan, what's a bike?

986
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,972
You'll buy a big car soon!

987
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:17,975
I'll slap you so hard
on your backside, you rascal

988
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:19,738
You speak such nonsense

989
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:20,874
I'll buy a car...

990
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,384
Are you drunk?

991
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:26,752
All this fiasco is because of you!
And you...

992
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,348
And now you'll go in with your
head held high all because of me

993
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:32,926
What do you mean?

994
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:39,858
One needs so many
things to produce a film

995
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:42,533
We have everything else

996
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:45,338
But we don't have a camera

997
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,843
And Balya says you have one?

998
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:52,642
Do you really?

999
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,439
I do

1000
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:57,012
I mean, does it work?

1001
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,816
No; I've kept it just
to see through the lens

1002
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,324
Honestly,
Balya, what's your friend asking?

1003
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:05,995
No Janyabhau...

1004
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:07,830
He knows that...

1005
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:09,422
...you click photographs

1006
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,697
But he wants to know...

1007
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:13,327
if you have a shooting camera

1008
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,496
Don't you know?

1009
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,464
Don't I shoot weddings?

1010
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:21,573
Not that!

1011
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:23,804
Wedding videos are
done with a tiny camera

1012
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:26,315
One man is enough to manage it

1013
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:29,275
But for film shootings...

1014
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:32,850
...you require four
people just to take care of it

1015
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:36,782
It has to be moved
from here to there

1016
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,452
Then there's 'Action' and 'Cut'

1017
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:40,658
We need big lights...

1018
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:45,562
...and a thermacol sheet

1019
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:49,969
So a marriage video camera won't do

1020
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:54,970
You do all that and
the film's CD is made?

1021
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:56,579
Of course!

1022
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:57,973
It has music?

1023
00:58:58,748 --> 00:58:59,737
Yes...

1024
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,348
You put it in a CD
player and watch it?

1025
00:59:03,553 --> 00:59:04,577
Yes, so?

1026
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:09,357
So the shooting I do
can also be put on a CD

1027
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:11,291
I add music to it

1028
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:13,925
And it can be put in
the CD player and viewed

1029
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:16,527
Didn't I tell you Raghya?

1030
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:25,968
Can you show us
a sample of your work?

1031
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:07,839
Okay...

1032
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:12,753
You don't seem to like it...
I'll go now

1033
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:15,052
Hey Janabhau, wait...
Hey Raghya...

1034
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:18,995
Balya...

1035
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:21,962
Our film will get made

1036
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:23,763
Janabhau will operate the camera

1037
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:24,966
Is that definite?

1038
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,434
Is it working?

1039
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,897
It's intoxicating!!!

1040
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:36,376
Janabhau, our film will be shot on

1041
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,879
your camera with you operating it!

1042
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:41,882
I had told you something
big is coming up for you...

1043
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:44,785
Balya, now at least return my bike

1044
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:47,948
Janabhau,
there's a lot of extra work now

1045
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:49,514
In fact,
I was going to request you...

1046
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:51,924
...to let me keep the
bike till the film is completed

1047
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:52,757
Let it be with him

1048
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:54,626
You say you have no work

1049
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,063
How will you manage engine oil...

1050
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,391
...and the repairs?

1051
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,901
Now we'll all be
together for the shooting

1052
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,597
The bike can be with you,
or me, or Mukya

1053
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:02,763
What's the difference?

1054
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:03,703
Look Balya...

1055
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,536
I hope your wife...

1056
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:06,939
...doesn't come
here looking for you

1057
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,308
I'm worried after
watching that huge fight

1058
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:11,609
Come, I'll drop you home...
Come on Raghya

1059
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:16,545
Yes, your wife must be waiting

1060
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,452
Dnt be irresponsible,
Dnt be a fool...

1061
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:24,960
Dnt forget what the parrot
said And don't let aids rule

1062
01:01:32,535 --> 01:01:33,968
That's the fourth they've opened.

1063
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:34,901
Shit, Raghya...

1064
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:36,302
I think they'll finish...

1065
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:37,704
...the whole carton

1066
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:41,502
They had to pick this time to drink

1067
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:44,308
Now they will be in
no mood to hear us out

1068
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:45,880
How will we get the information now?

1069
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:48,779
We have to go in
whatever happens...

1070
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:49,876
...we have to ask them

1071
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:51,011
Let's get it done

1072
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:52,349
But they won't disturb their party

1073
01:01:52,422 --> 01:01:53,787
to give us information about AIDS

1074
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:54,789
Let's go home

1075
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:56,951
Don't they do public awakening?

1076
01:01:57,027 --> 01:01:59,825
Is that for information or
just to distribute those packets?

1077
01:01:59,896 --> 01:02:00,760
Let's go

1078
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:08,566
What are you looking at Balya?

1079
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:11,440
Our meeting is going on.
What do you want?

1080
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:13,906
Some information...

1081
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:15,675
What information?

1082
01:02:15,845 --> 01:02:18,814
Which beer...?

1083
01:02:18,882 --> 01:02:21,646
AIDS... Information on AIDS

1084
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:23,743
How does it happen?

1085
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,048
What is the exact reason?

1086
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:26,788
We need detailed information...

1087
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,016
Are you crazy?

1088
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,884
Why do you want to know about AIDS?

1089
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:35,827
You have just graduated
from shorts to trousers

1090
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:37,833
You can only mimic like a parrot

1091
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,334
Hey Appa...

1092
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:40,835
What are you doing there?

1093
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:43,670
Throw out whoever it is!

1094
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,833
You can't leave a
hallowed place like this

1095
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,675
There... did you hear that? Get out

1096
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:52,840
We are doing important work here

1097
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:56,450
And Balya, have you lost your mind?

1098
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:59,716
And Raghya... have they
fired you from your film shooting?

1099
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:01,584
Why are you poking
your noses into all this?

1100
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:03,523
Run along now...

1101
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:10,024
Hey kids...

1102
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:19,432
You wanted to know what AIDS is?

1103
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:20,933
Yes...

1104
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:24,471
AIDS means a 'Popat' ('Parrot')!

1105
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:30,013
Understood - P-O-P-A-T (P-A-R-R-O-T)

1106
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:49,365
'Popat' ('Parrot')!

1107
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:56,710
Did you really believe that the
Sarpanch is doing public awakening?

1108
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,610
Are you fools?

1109
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,383
And Balya, you too?

1110
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:07,989
See what we wanted to
do and what was the result

1111
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,358
Popat! (Parrot!)

1112
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:11,927
Now how do we make this parrot talk?

1113
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:14,623
We need the information first

1114
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:16,628
Mukya...

1115
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:19,501
...now it's up to you

1116
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:22,403
Find some books on
the subject and read them

1117
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:24,602
Did you fall on your head?

1118
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:26,839
Would there be books on AIDS?

1119
01:04:27,343 --> 01:04:28,742
It's a sexually transmitted disease

1120
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:31,277
If there were books,
everyone would know what it is

1121
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:35,410
It's a dangerous disease

1122
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:36,850
Books your ticket
upstairs straightaway!

1123
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:39,819
And we can't get
information on it easily?

1124
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:41,288
So now what can we do?

1125
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:42,422
Have all our efforts been wasted?

1126
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:43,584
We can do one thing.

1127
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:47,057
That man comes to our village
health centre every Friday

1128
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,024
Get hold of him

1129
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:50,391
In any case,
he just sits around swatting flies

1130
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,728
Ask him for information

1131
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:54,029
He must be telling
those theatre guys too

1132
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:56,869
Till then, I'll write down
what I remember from the play

1133
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,032
Great! You will need paper and a pen

1134
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,971
I'll get you whatever you need

1135
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,770
Meanwhile, Balya and I
will look at the village girls

1136
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:05,836
What?

1137
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:08,408
For the heroine's role

1138
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:10,452
Oh I see

1139
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,613
Why do we need to look?

1140
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:13,849
Tell me their names

1141
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,415
I know exactly who goes
into which field with whom

1142
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,727
But our village girls have no spice

1143
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,022
That's true!

1144
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:24,864
And Janabhau knows about
the scene in Mandvewadi

1145
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,459
Hey, am I that kind of man?

1146
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:29,334
One who eats whatever he can find

1147
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:31,970
Everything I do is exclusive

1148
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,515
Then find someone
'exclusive' for our film

1149
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:43,913
Yes, I will

1150
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,512
First write the story at least

1151
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,926
But if I find the girl...

1152
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:53,359
...I'll be the hero!

1153
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:54,327
Hm?

1154
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:56,725
Oh like that...

1155
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:02,699
Agreed...

1156
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:03,534
So we are agreed?

1157
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:08,942
Wow... I'm the hero!!!

1158
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:12,271
Janabhau, can I leave now?

1159
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:13,747
I told my father I'm going jogging

1160
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:15,784
There he goes again!

1161
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:17,285
Let's start work on the film

1162
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,878
We will also look for girls

1163
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:20,320
You also look

1164
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,757
Find the heroine
- Yes, at once!

1165
01:06:29,265 --> 01:06:33,395
The number you are trying to
reach is currently not rechable...

1166
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,998
If I can't reach rakhi... who
in the world has?

1167
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,818
Hello... Gunabai... Where are you?

1168
01:06:56,626 --> 01:06:58,560
Forget me... where is Rakhi?

1169
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,829
She can't switch off her
phone and expect to do business?

1170
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:03,863
Obviously

1171
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:07,268
So tell me where she is

1172
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:09,503
Where? Nipani?

1173
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:10,738
Why...?

1174
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:13,234
Ya...?

1175
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:17,668
Oh ok...

1176
01:07:18,781 --> 01:07:20,248
I'm busy right now

1177
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,941
That's why I wanted to meet her

1178
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:24,452
There's a big job

1179
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:31,519
Okay I'll see what to do...

1180
01:07:36,999 --> 01:07:38,398
Two things are important

1181
01:07:39,469 --> 01:07:42,302
One is that how the
Popat (disease) happens

1182
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:43,566
because of whom and when

1183
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,330
That's very difficult to know

1184
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,669
And the second is
that if one is doomed

1185
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:53,883
if one hides it and
even if one talks about it

1186
01:07:54,016 --> 01:07:55,847
Everything has to be secret

1187
01:07:56,686 --> 01:08:00,281
So if one person gets it...

1188
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,980
and he goes to another...?

1189
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:05,958
Does that person get it too?

1190
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:08,930
Of course. That's what
those theatre people said

1191
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:13,265
If the bird's beak pecks
one worm and then pecks a second...

1192
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:14,902
...the PARROT (AIDS)
Is bound to happen

1193
01:08:15,738 --> 01:08:21,677
If you go to four different people
all of them could be in danger

1194
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,270
So if the woman has it,
the man will also die...

1195
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:26,838
...Isn't that's certain?

1196
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:30,510
If there is filth in the water pipe
and it's let into the water tank...

1197
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,985
...how will the water
in the tank remain pure?

1198
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:37,556
That's why one has to
tie a cloth around the tap

1199
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:40,926
Then the filth is trapped
and only the water flows

1200
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:45,757
Balya, make a list of all
the sexual affairs in our village

1201
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,894
...meet them.

1202
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:48,902
And ask them

1203
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:52,805
Do they use the condoms or
are they just letting the tap flow?

1204
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,315
Are you ready, Janabhau?
- Yes, I'm ready

1205
01:09:03,386 --> 01:09:05,752
Wait, wait... okay, let's go

1206
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:08,654
Start...

1207
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,927
Hey Pakya, come and pick
up your photographs - Can we start?

1208
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:12,892
Yes, yes

1209
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:20,892
Is anyone home? ...Is anyone home?
- What do you want?

1210
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:23,299
Is Bapu in?

1211
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,703
What do you want?

1212
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,471
It's private. Please call him.

1213
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:28,839
We know everything about each other

1214
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:30,344
So tell me.

1215
01:09:30,646 --> 01:09:31,613
Um...

1216
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:41,986
Do you use the pack given to you?

1217
01:09:42,258 --> 01:09:43,520
What pack?

1218
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,726
That... While sleeping at night...

1219
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:48,627
...that is... while...

1220
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:53,531
Ask her straight

1221
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:54,397
Tell me sister

1222
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,597
Does bapu use a condom at night

1223
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:57,636
Yes...

1224
01:09:57,907 --> 01:09:59,033
You bastard

1225
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:05,537
Hey Janabhau, wait...
don't leave me and go

1226
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:06,707
Janabhau!

1227
01:10:07,049 --> 01:10:11,918
I'll ask the questions...
you just do the camerawork

1228
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:14,779
Okay?

1229
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:17,424
Hm...

1230
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:19,988
Are you ready, Sir?
- Give me a moment

1231
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:21,393
Wait...

1232
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:25,466
Ask me...
- Should I start?

1233
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,903
Are you married?

1234
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:31,932
I... Twice...
So two wives at home?

1235
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:37,608
Twice?

1236
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:45,977
So two farms and only one document?

1237
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:49,554
So how do you manage?

1238
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:51,985
Manage what?

1239
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:53,619
The night business

1240
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:57,064
Isn't it complicated?

1241
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:04,430
You are newly married?
- Yes

1242
01:11:05,374 --> 01:11:07,672
Good! Then everyone
must be looking after you?

1243
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:08,402
Yes

1244
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:13,938
Okay. Do you take care?
- Of what?

1245
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:15,941
Do you use a condom?

1246
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:16,746
What?

1247
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,286
A condom...

1248
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:21,479
You swine... don't you
have mothers and sisters at home?

1249
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:23,320
I'll teach you a lesson

1250
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:28,329
Aw... don't...

1251
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:30,764
So you want to shoot this?
- No, no... Aw

1252
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,461
There's a filter for the water

1253
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,299
But has your husband...

1254
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,933
...put a filter on the tap?

1255
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,986
There's only one pump
providing water to two farms

1256
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:58,083
Aren't you scared?

1257
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,901
Was your information correct?

1258
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:11,371
If I'm wrong,
I'll do whatever you want

1259
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,599
Get hold of that Patole teacher

1260
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:16,407
He sniffs around
like a dog all the time

1261
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:19,615
And Dhanya Kadam is
always having sexual affairs

1262
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,646
Half the village does that...

1263
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:25,582
but nobody wants to talk

1264
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,416
So says the Professor

1265
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:30,982
There will be an
epidemic in the village

1266
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,652
But does anyone give a damn...

1267
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:35,726
Now we have messed up

1268
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,433
No we have not messed up

1269
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:41,736
If we're producing a film, and that
too one on such a tough subject...

1270
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,008
...we will have to deal with this

1271
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:51,707
But now we must decide
how to carry on.

1272
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:54,683
How do we get the information?

1273
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,408
And we still haven't decided
on a hero and the heroine

1274
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:00,387
Didn't Janabhau say
he'll bring the girl...

1275
01:13:00,556 --> 01:13:02,251
If he gets the heroine,
then he'll play the hero;

1276
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:03,348
haven't we decided that?

1277
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:05,656
Yes... but first we
must see how the girl is,

1278
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:07,992
who she is, how she acts...

1279
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:11,461
But Raghya, Kulpe is not
the only village in the world

1280
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,635
We are sure to find
someone somewhere

1281
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:17,033
Janabhau's gone and he'll
return with a woman for sure

1282
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,565
He's an expert at that

1283
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,577
Isn't it Raghya?

1284
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,377
But where is Janabhau?

1285
01:13:58,414 --> 01:14:01,941
See what's happened to the poor girl

1286
01:14:12,495 --> 01:14:15,259
Rakhi, I looked for you all over

1287
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,026
You were fine when I saw you last

1288
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:21,936
What went wrong suddenly?

1289
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:29,968
The doctor says that
she can't work anymore

1290
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,377
She has stopped her performances

1291
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,777
Why? You have to work

1292
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,047
Get well soon

1293
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,823
I have landed a
really big job for you

1294
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,921
We are producing a film

1295
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:50,661
It's the heroine's role

1296
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:53,566
We'll include an item song too

1297
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,603
Don't shed tears like this

1298
01:14:58,674 --> 01:15:00,005
Come on get up!

1299
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:01,505
Jana...

1300
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:02,441
Hm...?

1301
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:05,346
Now I have no control
over anything...

1302
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:08,950
I will definitely work in your film

1303
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,412
But I have to be alive for that...

1304
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:16,781
My destiny has sent
me this terrible disease

1305
01:15:18,327 --> 01:15:22,627
Have I ever allowed
anyone to enter like this?

1306
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:29,294
But this HIV or something
has entered my body...

1307
01:15:29,638 --> 01:15:32,539
...and it looks
like it'll take my life

1308
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:34,999
First this virus entered her

1309
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:39,743
And now... they say that
she has that AIDS or something

1310
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:42,981
And there's no cure for it anywhere

1311
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:48,590
Not in the whole wide world!

1312
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:18,193
Hey Balya... Janabhau, is this it?

1313
01:17:20,504 --> 01:17:22,301
I don't see the doctor

1314
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:24,806
Hey, don't make a racket; sit down

1315
01:17:25,509 --> 01:17:27,534
I'll see... Hey brother

1316
01:17:28,178 --> 01:17:31,739
Where's the doctor? Wait, I'll see

1317
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:33,138
Doct...

1318
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,079
Hm
- Doctor...

1319
01:17:35,285 --> 01:17:37,082
Is the doctor here?

1320
01:17:37,554 --> 01:17:38,521
Who are you?

1321
01:17:40,157 --> 01:17:41,351
Who let you in?

1322
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,254
Look here...

1323
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,486
I don't want to
give any donations...

1324
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,323
Nor do I want any offers from you

1325
01:17:45,462 --> 01:17:46,861
Get up... Get out

1326
01:17:47,131 --> 01:17:47,688
Patil...

1327
01:17:47,764 --> 01:17:48,560
Patil

1328
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:50,532
Sir... I'm Raghunath Hiwale...

1329
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:51,533
...from Kulpe

1330
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,659
That production guy Pitte...
from films

1331
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,603
Yes, yes...
Pitte, the production guy

1332
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:58,436
He told me

1333
01:17:58,542 --> 01:17:59,668
He has sent you?

1334
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:01,139
Okay... please sit

1335
01:18:03,614 --> 01:18:05,548
You can come out ma'am

1336
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:16,087
OK

1337
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,791
Give these reports
to my compounder Mr. Patil

1338
01:18:18,362 --> 01:18:21,331
And continue with the medicines
that I gave you earlier

1339
01:18:21,598 --> 01:18:25,227
And one more thing... you
must take care of your health, ma'am

1340
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:27,834
After all, this is your profession

1341
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:30,433
You must make your
clients understand that

1342
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:32,132
You have to take care

1343
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,506
Tell them that it's a rule

1344
01:18:34,178 --> 01:18:35,805
Your reports are negative right now

1345
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:38,306
But one can't tell what
will happen in the future

1346
01:18:38,415 --> 01:18:40,280
The danger will always be there

1347
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:43,412
Do you understand
what I'm saying? - Yes

1348
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:44,749
Okay... see you

1349
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,183
Come in Raghunath

1350
01:18:50,761 --> 01:18:52,558
What can I do for you?

1351
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:55,624
And why did you
bring all these guys?

1352
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:58,734
Your problem should remain yours

1353
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:02,135
No doctor...
I don't have a problem...

1354
01:19:03,407 --> 01:19:05,568
All of us do
- What?

1355
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:09,111
No, no, not that Sir!

1356
01:19:10,547 --> 01:19:11,514
The problem is...

1357
01:19:11,582 --> 01:19:13,812
We... we are...

1358
01:19:15,552 --> 01:19:16,814
We are producing a film

1359
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:18,247
Producing a film?

1360
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:24,091
Producing a film?

1361
01:19:24,194 --> 01:19:25,718
So why have you come to me?

1362
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:27,627
Are you giving me a role?

1363
01:19:27,698 --> 01:19:30,326
Or do you want my
clinic for a location?

1364
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:36,801
No, no Sir...
the theme of our film is AIDS

1365
01:19:40,577 --> 01:19:41,407
Hm...

1366
01:19:42,145 --> 01:19:44,306
We want to make this film...

1367
01:19:44,848 --> 01:19:48,375
...but none of
us has any information

1368
01:19:48,552 --> 01:19:52,147
Nor is anyone giving
us any information

1369
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:55,548
If you can please help us out...

1370
01:19:55,726 --> 01:19:56,750
Yes, yes, why not?

1371
01:19:56,827 --> 01:19:59,295
One request, Doctor

1372
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:02,227
Please tell us the names
of some reference books

1373
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:03,527
We will read them

1374
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,068
Even books in English will do

1375
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:07,662
He knows English

1376
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:10,400
Fantastic! But I have no time today

1377
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:12,408
You can see the queue
of patients outside - Yes Sir

1378
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:15,645
Take the reference books from
Mr. Patil outside

1379
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:18,047
Read them,
and if you have any doubts...

1380
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:19,514
...meet me at my house next week

1381
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,676
Yes Sir. That's fine Sir

1382
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:24,516
Here's my card. See you

1383
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:26,780
Thank you Doctor... will
take your leave now.

1384
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:47,470
What are you looking at? - Hm?

1385
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:49,510
Do you know her?

1386
01:20:51,315 --> 01:20:52,339
No, I don't

1387
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:55,144
She did great shows
- Is it?

1388
01:20:55,652 --> 01:20:57,313
She came here to me six months ago

1389
01:21:21,812 --> 01:21:23,336
Balya...

1390
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,175
Did you see the crowd in his clinic?

1391
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:30,644
It was like the village fair

1392
01:21:33,357 --> 01:21:38,795
Are so many people
suffering from AIDS?

1393
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:42,327
Whatever it is, that doctor's
doing excellent business

1394
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,196
And other problems of the public...

1395
01:21:50,674 --> 01:21:52,301
Hey literary giant...

1396
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:53,673
...have you found anything?

1397
01:21:55,545 --> 01:21:57,809
Hell... he goes crazy
whenever he finds a book

1398
01:21:58,148 --> 01:22:01,140
Now is this a storybook?
But see him...

1399
01:22:01,318 --> 01:22:04,754
He is immersed in it
like a buffalo in the water

1400
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:07,682
Hey Mukya...
see what Balya's calling you

1401
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:09,089
...A buffalo!

1402
01:22:09,393 --> 01:22:13,022
Forget buffaloes...
Monkeys are threatening to kill us

1403
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:13,790
What?

1404
01:22:14,064 --> 01:22:17,329
And Balya,
you have to stay away from monkeys

1405
01:22:17,534 --> 01:22:19,525
Why? ...What happened?

1406
01:22:19,603 --> 01:22:21,400
Have you gone crazy?

1407
01:22:21,471 --> 01:22:23,302
What's all this about monkeys?

1408
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,466
This disease has come from monkeys

1409
01:22:26,543 --> 01:22:28,033
You know Africa? - Hm

1410
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,544
Yes... those cricket team chaps?

1411
01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:33,208
This writer feels that
it originated from there

1412
01:22:33,283 --> 01:22:34,545
Africa?

1413
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:38,444
But those guys in the cricket
team seem to be gentlemen

1414
01:22:38,522 --> 01:22:40,786
Exactly... he just talks rubbish

1415
01:22:42,826 --> 01:22:45,090
No, you know what happens...

1416
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:46,785
Things are not what they seem

1417
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,222
Yes...

1418
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:51,358
Those who have multiple affairs...

1419
01:22:51,435 --> 01:22:54,461
...have to pretend to be gentlemen

1420
01:22:54,538 --> 01:22:55,698
No, no Raghya!

1421
01:22:55,772 --> 01:22:56,830
Isn't it Balya?

1422
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:03,174
Hey Raghya, I'll hit you

1423
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:06,215
But I haven't understood one thing

1424
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,276
These people...

1425
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,285
...why do they
go to female monkeys?

1426
01:23:12,656 --> 01:23:15,216
They must be forest dwellers

1427
01:23:15,392 --> 01:23:16,552
Now if a forest dweller...

1428
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:19,686
...wants a change
in taste where will he go?

1429
01:23:20,797 --> 01:23:23,789
But why does man
need a change of taste?

1430
01:23:25,502 --> 01:23:30,201
Because we human beings...

1431
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:33,142
...love to make
mistakes above all else

1432
01:23:38,348 --> 01:23:40,543
Unprotected sex is a mistake...

1433
01:23:40,617 --> 01:23:42,812
It will bring you
the misery of a lifetime

1434
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:07,208
Oh shit... So Rakhi's
life is like a film story

1435
01:24:09,246 --> 01:24:11,009
And it's about to end now.

1436
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:15,615
But Janabhau, if there
is no cure for this Parrot...

1437
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,281
...what does that doctor do?

1438
01:24:19,022 --> 01:24:20,614
Or does he just
fill his own pockets?

1439
01:24:21,258 --> 01:24:22,555
Maybe not

1440
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,127
He must be examining
patients to see...

1441
01:24:25,195 --> 01:24:27,629
...whether the Parrot
has started talking or not

1442
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:30,756
And once it starts talking...

1443
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:35,501
...it means that
the tale is about to end

1444
01:24:36,706 --> 01:24:38,196
That must be it

1445
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:42,305
Isn't it Bhau?

1446
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:47,382
See you guys, it's written here
- What?

1447
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:53,616
Just getting the Parrot doesn't
mean that everything is over

1448
01:24:54,090 --> 01:25:00,222
Once a child is born...
first it starts crawling...

1449
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:01,591
...then standing...

1450
01:25:02,032 --> 01:25:04,057
...and finally walking

1451
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:07,398
The Parrot also grows
just like that...

1452
01:25:08,004 --> 01:25:11,565
And it creates storms as it grows

1453
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:16,169
Stomach problems, throat infections,

1454
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:19,607
rising fever and
a decreasing appetite

1455
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,344
A man just loses
interest in everything

1456
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:28,489
Okay guys, I'll head home now

1457
01:25:29,092 --> 01:25:30,684
But what about the heroine?

1458
01:25:34,698 --> 01:25:38,031
Let's see... I'll search for one...
you all look too

1459
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,259
We'll manage

1460
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,794
See you.
Preeti must be waiting for me

1461
01:25:42,105 --> 01:25:44,437
What's new about that?

1462
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,403
Normally, I would have waited...

1463
01:25:49,446 --> 01:25:50,470
But she's pregnant

1464
01:25:53,783 --> 01:25:55,341
She needs care

1465
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:58,421
See you

1466
01:25:58,521 --> 01:25:59,749
Janabhau, wait

1467
01:26:00,223 --> 01:26:03,158
Take this
- What?

1468
01:26:03,994 --> 01:26:05,291
Take the bike

1469
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:10,064
Take it with you...

1470
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:18,506
It's parked near the shop.
You'll have to walk up to there

1471
01:26:21,211 --> 01:26:22,439
That's good

1472
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:26,480
But he'll still have to
take the big rickshaw - Why?

1473
01:26:26,549 --> 01:26:28,449
The bike's not working

1474
01:26:28,718 --> 01:26:30,583
What sort of person are you?

1475
01:26:30,754 --> 01:26:32,346
Then why did you give him the key?

1476
01:26:32,422 --> 01:26:34,481
Didn't it make him
feel a bit better?

1477
01:26:35,058 --> 01:26:37,322
His face looked sad.
Didn't he cheer up a little?

1478
01:26:37,394 --> 01:26:38,292
Yes, he did

1479
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,522
I'm off
- What?

1480
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:44,360
We don't have a story yet...
and the Professor's going

1481
01:26:44,434 --> 01:26:47,028
I have a story...
I'll write it immediately

1482
01:26:47,103 --> 01:26:50,504
What story? Where?
When? Hey Mukya... - Hey Mukya...

1483
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:52,370
Mukya, tell us the story

1484
01:26:52,442 --> 01:26:55,206
Shit! It's like he's
suffered an electric shock

1485
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:01,515
See, our hero has
an extramarital affair

1486
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:02,813
He has a wife also at home

1487
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,786
It's like jaggery
outside and sugar at home

1488
01:27:06,056 --> 01:27:08,081
He gets dessert at both places

1489
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:14,256
Time passes and his wife
starts expecting a child

1490
01:27:14,431 --> 01:27:15,227
Wow!!!

1491
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:19,426
He takes his pregnant wife
to the hospital for a check-up

1492
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:25,107
And there...
he sees her on a bed in the ward

1493
01:27:25,842 --> 01:27:29,243
She? That is the other woman?

1494
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:30,336
Yes...

1495
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,740
After making inquiries,
the hero finds out...

1496
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:35,445
...the woman has the Parrot

1497
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:36,679
And so does he

1498
01:27:36,853 --> 01:27:39,253
And then the real drama starts

1499
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:41,450
In the hero's house

1500
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:43,258
And in his mind

1501
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:47,387
Enough...

1502
01:27:47,464 --> 01:27:48,761
Enough Professor...

1503
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:51,100
What you have written is just great

1504
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,327
Yes, yes, yes!!!

1505
01:27:52,402 --> 01:27:53,369
This is our story...

1506
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:54,334
This is it!

1507
01:27:54,404 --> 01:27:56,372
Raghya, do we agree on that?

1508
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,701
Yes, it's fine

1509
01:27:57,774 --> 01:27:59,298
Now Mukya, speed up your hand...

1510
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,569
...and write those dialogues
or whatever it is called

1511
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:02,543
Balya, it's not the job of a hand;

1512
01:28:02,612 --> 01:28:03,636
it's the head that's involved

1513
01:28:03,713 --> 01:28:05,044
It will take time

1514
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:08,111
Till then you guys decide
on the hero and the heroine

1515
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:10,108
Shit; of course!

1516
01:28:10,186 --> 01:28:11,483
Janabhau...
- Hm?

1517
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:15,684
You were going to bring
a woman - Yes, but...

1518
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,759
So now Raghya will
be the hero? Okay?

1519
01:28:17,827 --> 01:28:21,126
Hey no...
we'll go with what we had decided

1520
01:28:22,499 --> 01:28:25,161
Janabhau's the hero
- But...

1521
01:28:29,506 --> 01:28:32,805
Why are you looking at me?

1522
01:28:33,543 --> 01:28:37,343
Do I look like a
married man with a kid?

1523
01:28:38,515 --> 01:28:40,574
Don't we need a person
who matches the story?

1524
01:28:46,422 --> 01:28:47,411
Janabhau's just right

1525
01:28:48,224 --> 01:28:49,122
Is that right...?

1526
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,323
We have our hero!

1527
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:52,520
Don't forget to see the film

1528
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:54,563
Don't miss Janabhau's film!

1529
01:29:07,644 --> 01:29:10,169
You as the hero...

1530
01:29:12,081 --> 01:29:13,742
How will that look?

1531
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:19,084
So you will dance around a tree...

1532
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:21,683
with that heavy camera
around your neck

1533
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:25,460
lt'll look like bullocks on a farm

1534
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:27,120
with yokes around their necks

1535
01:29:27,297 --> 01:29:29,492
There will be no
camera around my neck

1536
01:29:30,266 --> 01:29:33,064
Every hero has his
own style I will too...

1537
01:29:39,142 --> 01:29:40,302
Who is the heroine?

1538
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:45,206
Not fixed yet. They're looking
for someone who will suit me...

1539
01:29:45,849 --> 01:29:48,079
Why don't you just
do the camerawork?

1540
01:29:49,185 --> 01:29:50,709
Do what you are capable of

1541
01:29:52,188 --> 01:29:54,622
A donkey shouldn't
wear a tiger's skin!

1542
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:58,791
Why are you jealous?

1543
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:01,353
The baby is kicking inside me

1544
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:02,462
It doesn't like this either...

1545
01:30:02,532 --> 01:30:05,330
...that its father is painting
his face and acting in a film

1546
01:30:06,736 --> 01:30:14,142
By the time it understands its
father will have become very famous

1547
01:30:15,311 --> 01:30:16,710
But why this profession?

1548
01:30:17,213 --> 01:30:18,578
They say it's very bad

1549
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:21,215
Homes and families break up

1550
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:24,383
I won't let you do this

1551
01:30:24,454 --> 01:30:26,217
Now don't create a problem

1552
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,555
When I had no work,
you wanted me to find work

1553
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:31,617
Now that I have work,
you're still complaining

1554
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,061
Have a little patience

1555
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,470
Think that our good times are here

1556
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,500
Be patient!

1557
01:30:45,842 --> 01:30:49,209
And do one thing...
make the food a little less spicy

1558
01:30:50,346 --> 01:30:52,541
My mouth feels a little raw
- Hm

1559
01:30:53,483 --> 01:30:59,718
Superstar Janardhan and
Mrs. Superstar Preeti...!

1560
01:31:05,361 --> 01:31:07,124
Is it cleaned?
- Get away

1561
01:31:07,263 --> 01:31:09,527
It should be cleaned before
the shooting - Hello, hello...

1562
01:31:09,599 --> 01:31:11,590
Raghya, Janabhau...
this lady is here

1563
01:31:11,668 --> 01:31:12,498
There they are...

1564
01:31:12,568 --> 01:31:13,592
Oh... please come

1565
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,160
Stand here

1566
01:31:15,305 --> 01:31:18,331
That's good

1567
01:31:23,146 --> 01:31:25,080
Brother, please wait there

1568
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:26,638
It's your sister
who we have to shoot

1569
01:31:26,716 --> 01:31:28,343
But she's my sister

1570
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:30,409
My father has asked
me to stay with her

1571
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:31,453
Balya, just see...

1572
01:31:31,521 --> 01:31:34,319
Hey brother,
are we going to eat your sister?

1573
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:36,517
You wait on this side...
are we going to eat her up...!

1574
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:38,355
Start the camera

1575
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:40,652
Great brother... Come on

1576
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:42,095
Sister, you come this side

1577
01:31:42,165 --> 01:31:43,826
Very good!!!

1578
01:31:45,435 --> 01:31:49,371
Sister, please tell us
your name without feeling shy

1579
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:01,277
Tell us...

1580
01:32:02,151 --> 01:32:05,177
Tell us... - Pooja

1581
01:32:05,288 --> 01:32:09,190
Pooja...
that's great! Start the camera

1582
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:12,192
Pooja, good; Look Pooja - Hey...

1583
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:15,721
Oh... sister Pooja

1584
01:32:15,798 --> 01:32:17,390
Look, Pooja sister

1585
01:32:17,467 --> 01:32:19,196
Now we have to imagine...

1586
01:32:19,268 --> 01:32:22,169
...that the man you love

1587
01:32:22,372 --> 01:32:25,273
You are meeting him after many days

1588
01:32:25,508 --> 01:32:27,373
You see him and say

1589
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:30,339
"My heart burns if I don't meet you"

1590
01:32:31,514 --> 01:32:33,243
What do you say?

1591
01:32:34,751 --> 01:32:38,118
"My heart burns if I don't meet you"

1592
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:40,255
Did you understand that?

1593
01:32:40,323 --> 01:32:41,381
Yes, you have

1594
01:32:41,457 --> 01:32:42,822
You have got it

1595
01:32:43,092 --> 01:32:44,719
Janabhau, are you ready
- Ready, I'm ready...

1596
01:32:44,827 --> 01:32:47,057
Silence... Come on

1597
01:32:49,432 --> 01:32:50,262
Ready

1598
01:32:50,466 --> 01:32:51,433
Now speak

1599
01:32:54,504 --> 01:32:56,131
Yes sister, speak

1600
01:32:58,775 --> 01:33:00,538
You're looking good... speak

1601
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,080
Hey brother, let her speak

1602
01:33:13,156 --> 01:33:15,124
She is not talking because
she is scared of you

1603
01:33:15,558 --> 01:33:16,684
Speak...

1604
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,057
Speak

1605
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:22,561
My heart burns

1606
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,689
Yes speak

1607
01:33:25,501 --> 01:33:26,798
Yours...

1608
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:28,661
You...

1609
01:33:31,808 --> 01:33:33,139
Shit...!

1610
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:35,506
It's moving - Not like that sister

1611
01:33:35,578 --> 01:33:37,170
Not like that... no sister

1612
01:33:37,246 --> 01:33:41,205
See... like this...
you must be agitated

1613
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:46,654
It should seem like a fish
has been pulled out of the water

1614
01:33:48,257 --> 01:33:50,748
How? Who do I say this to?

1615
01:33:50,827 --> 01:33:52,055
Shit...!

1616
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:55,689
Hey, don't swear in front of ladies

1617
01:33:55,765 --> 01:33:58,700
No brother, he's not swearing

1618
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:00,201
He's not swearing

1619
01:34:00,403 --> 01:34:04,271
Janabhau...
you go and stand next to her

1620
01:34:05,408 --> 01:34:07,433
In any case,
you won't be operating the camera

1621
01:34:08,044 --> 01:34:10,137
You can also practise your acting

1622
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:14,650
Come on
- Like this?

1623
01:34:14,717 --> 01:34:17,584
Yes, yes, go
- That's fine

1624
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:20,747
Great... Yes...

1625
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:26,221
Janabhau, come back a little

1626
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:27,419
Here?

1627
01:34:27,497 --> 01:34:29,089
A little more

1628
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:30,530
That's enough

1629
01:34:30,733 --> 01:34:33,293
Sister, you step ahead a little

1630
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:34,427
Don't feel shy

1631
01:34:34,504 --> 01:34:38,065
It's only Janabhau...
like that... okay

1632
01:34:38,307 --> 01:34:39,774
Janabhau
- Yes?

1633
01:34:40,276 --> 01:34:41,504
Do the action

1634
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,406
What's my dialogue?

1635
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:48,607
Oh, the dialogue

1636
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,349
We forgot the dialogue, Janabhau

1637
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:55,215
Look Janabhau... stand here...

1638
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:57,156
Look at her and say

1639
01:34:57,226 --> 01:34:59,660
"Bakula,
two swords in one scabbard..."

1640
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:01,424
Bakula, if there are
two swords in one scabbard...

1641
01:35:01,497 --> 01:35:03,692
Wait, I'm telling you

1642
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,094
Yes, "Bakula, when there
are two swords in one scabbard...

1643
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,637
...it's a big problem for a man"

1644
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:10,171
"You won't understand that"

1645
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,571
Sister, you speak your dialogue

1646
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:17,240
"My heart burns without you"...
understand?

1647
01:35:17,313 --> 01:35:19,008
Did you understand?
- Hm

1648
01:35:19,081 --> 01:35:22,107
Come on, move away...
Hm... Silence

1649
01:35:25,454 --> 01:35:26,148
How's this?

1650
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:27,154
Looks great, Janabhau

1651
01:35:27,223 --> 01:35:28,622
Superb Janabhau; just great

1652
01:35:28,691 --> 01:35:30,022
Hm...

1653
01:35:30,293 --> 01:35:31,555
Okay, do the action now

1654
01:35:45,474 --> 01:35:46,702
Please speak...

1655
01:35:48,044 --> 01:35:52,071
Bakula... what is it?

1656
01:35:52,114 --> 01:35:53,103
One scabbard...

1657
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:55,650
Two swords - Hm... Um... Um

1658
01:36:04,126 --> 01:36:05,150
Say the dialogue

1659
01:36:05,228 --> 01:36:07,992
Bakula... if one keeps
two scabbards in one sword...

1660
01:36:08,064 --> 01:36:09,156
...then what will happen?

1661
01:36:09,232 --> 01:36:10,722
Not that Janabhau...

1662
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,624
The other way around

1663
01:36:12,702 --> 01:36:14,431
The other way around?

1664
01:36:15,671 --> 01:36:17,502
So I said it...

1665
01:36:18,174 --> 01:36:20,039
The opposite
- Yes

1666
01:36:23,412 --> 01:36:24,674
I'll do it this time correctly...

1667
01:36:25,014 --> 01:36:28,177
The opposite
- Yes

1668
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:32,716
Hey Bakula

1669
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:36,519
Say your dialogue!

1670
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:38,218
If there are two swords
in one scabbard...

1671
01:36:38,294 --> 01:36:39,420
...it's a big problem for any man

1672
01:36:39,495 --> 01:36:41,156
You won't understand Bakula

1673
01:36:41,264 --> 01:36:42,595
Should I say that
'condom' dialogue now?

1674
01:36:42,665 --> 01:36:43,188
Hm...?

1675
01:36:43,266 --> 01:36:46,201
You film chaps... enough

1676
01:36:46,335 --> 01:36:48,496
You make naughty films like this

1677
01:36:48,571 --> 01:36:50,198
Okay Pooja, let's go

1678
01:36:50,273 --> 01:36:51,740
We are not doing this

1679
01:36:51,774 --> 01:36:52,763
Hey Balya

1680
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:55,533
Brother... Raghya...
Hey brother, sister Pooja

1681
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:57,101
Please wait

1682
01:36:57,179 --> 01:37:01,377
Sister Pooja... please stop them

1683
01:37:05,388 --> 01:37:06,355
Action!!!

1684
01:37:06,656 --> 01:37:10,114
My heart is burning... what next?

1685
01:37:11,761 --> 01:37:12,785
Action!!!

1686
01:37:13,062 --> 01:37:14,461
My heart burns

1687
01:37:15,097 --> 01:37:16,530
If I don't meet you

1688
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:21,626
My heart burns

1689
01:37:21,704 --> 01:37:23,467
If I don't meet you

1690
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:30,575
My heart burns If I don't meet you

1691
01:37:31,547 --> 01:37:32,639
My heart burns

1692
01:37:32,715 --> 01:37:34,342
If I don't meet you

1693
01:37:36,852 --> 01:37:38,251
Action!!!

1694
01:37:52,201 --> 01:37:56,535
Come sister... come...
stand in front of the camera

1695
01:37:56,605 --> 01:37:57,799
Janabhau, look...

1696
01:37:58,174 --> 01:37:59,334
Here, here... enough

1697
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:01,070
Now say your dialogue... Say...

1698
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:03,505
...My heart burns
if I don't meet you

1699
01:38:03,713 --> 01:38:06,409
Heart burns
- My heart

1700
01:38:06,482 --> 01:38:08,040
Okay; go on... come sister

1701
01:38:08,117 --> 01:38:09,243
Say this dialogue

1702
01:38:09,318 --> 01:38:12,287
My heart burns if
I don't meet you Say it

1703
01:38:12,355 --> 01:38:13,720
Heart burns...

1704
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:15,421
My heart burns...

1705
01:38:15,825 --> 01:38:17,292
The heart burns... mine

1706
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:17,792
No, what?

1707
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,788
If I don't meet you

1708
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:20,050
If I don't meet you

1709
01:38:20,763 --> 01:38:21,627
If I don't meet you

1710
01:39:03,038 --> 01:39:04,437
We are ready

1711
01:39:04,673 --> 01:39:07,437
Who will say what dialogues,
everything

1712
01:39:07,676 --> 01:39:10,770
For the first time ever,
I'm ready before the exams

1713
01:39:12,248 --> 01:39:14,409
And now you guys are giving up like
you haven't finished the portion

1714
01:39:14,784 --> 01:39:18,185
We can't find one proper girl

1715
01:39:23,459 --> 01:39:24,551
I have one question

1716
01:39:25,694 --> 01:39:31,496
Then what's the reason for making
the wife in this story pregnant?

1717
01:39:36,672 --> 01:39:38,833
Why mix up my story
with the film's story?

1718
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:41,266
No Janabhau

1719
01:39:42,278 --> 01:39:43,176
This is just a story...

1720
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:44,371
...it's not real...

1721
01:39:45,581 --> 01:39:46,673
Anybody's wife can be pregnant...

1722
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:48,216
...at any time

1723
01:39:48,284 --> 01:39:50,149
One doesn't need any
intelligence for that

1724
01:39:51,387 --> 01:39:53,116
No... no, no, no...

1725
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:56,420
What he's saying is that
this can happen to anybody

1726
01:39:56,492 --> 01:39:58,483
Yes, yes, yes...

1727
01:39:58,828 --> 01:39:59,726
Isn't it?

1728
01:39:59,795 --> 01:40:00,762
This could happen to me...

1729
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:02,087
...or Balya, or Mukya...

1730
01:40:02,131 --> 01:40:03,530
...it can happen to anyone

1731
01:40:05,301 --> 01:40:07,792
But no, not Mukya...

1732
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:09,300
Why not?

1733
01:40:09,805 --> 01:40:12,501
If I get naked, I'm the same
as you... not any different...

1734
01:40:12,575 --> 01:40:13,633
No, not that

1735
01:40:13,709 --> 01:40:18,646
But Balya has a habit
of going into the fields...

1736
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:21,079
Isn't it Balya?

1737
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:22,117
Hey, you guys

1738
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:23,344
Don't talk rubbish

1739
01:40:23,419 --> 01:40:24,613
Darshana is not like that

1740
01:40:24,687 --> 01:40:27,053
No Darshana is not like that...

1741
01:40:27,122 --> 01:40:29,317
...But what about you Sir?

1742
01:40:29,391 --> 01:40:30,653
You get around the village

1743
01:40:30,726 --> 01:40:34,321
Who knows if you have
done something somewhere!

1744
01:40:34,396 --> 01:40:35,693
What?
- Yes

1745
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:39,127
Save me Bhau
- Hey Balya

1746
01:40:39,201 --> 01:40:41,362
He teases me whenever
he gets the slightest chance

1747
01:40:41,403 --> 01:40:44,338
Hey, don't do that... Quiet

1748
01:40:44,373 --> 01:40:45,738
Tell him
- Yes, I will

1749
01:40:45,808 --> 01:40:47,275
Bhau... I'll tell you their names

1750
01:40:47,343 --> 01:40:49,208
Jyoti...
Savita... Pinky... Pinky...

1751
01:40:49,245 --> 01:40:50,507
There's Sonal too

1752
01:40:50,579 --> 01:40:53,207
Hey, is this true?
- Hey Pinky...

1753
01:40:53,282 --> 01:40:55,477
Come sit here...
Relax... Come here

1754
01:40:57,753 --> 01:40:59,618
He's our friend, Raghu...
you shouldn't tease

1755
01:41:00,589 --> 01:41:03,319
If you tell the truth, it hurts

1756
01:41:06,195 --> 01:41:08,129
Janabhau, you too...!

1757
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:10,358
But it's true Balya...

1758
01:41:10,432 --> 01:41:13,765
Isn't that's why you know
all the spots in the fields?

1759
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,128
Yes but...

1760
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:18,632
Darshana's the girl I truly love

1761
01:41:18,774 --> 01:41:20,105
Yes...?

1762
01:41:26,115 --> 01:41:27,742
Just look at him

1763
01:41:31,787 --> 01:41:33,220
Hey Balya... Darshana?

1764
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:39,190
Darshana is our heroine

1765
01:41:46,735 --> 01:41:49,636
Is there anybody more beautiful
than her in our village?

1766
01:41:50,739 --> 01:41:53,765
Hm... And she also
has her own beauty parlour

1767
01:41:56,145 --> 01:41:57,635
She can do the make-up too

1768
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:02,311
That's wonderful!

1769
01:42:02,685 --> 01:42:05,483
But how will she handle the acting?

1770
01:42:06,689 --> 01:42:08,054
What's the big deal?

1771
01:42:08,624 --> 01:42:11,388
Janabhau's not an expert...
but he is managing

1772
01:42:12,528 --> 01:42:14,496
That is to say, he is trying

1773
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:16,026
Hm... hm...

1774
01:42:16,098 --> 01:42:17,122
Isn't it?

1775
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:20,192
Hm... But I'll have to talk to her

1776
01:42:20,269 --> 01:42:21,395
So talk

1777
01:42:23,672 --> 01:42:24,639
Hm...

1778
01:42:24,707 --> 01:42:27,107
Till then, I'll memorise everything

1779
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:30,236
Fine

1780
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:32,672
That's fine

1781
01:42:32,748 --> 01:42:34,272
This is great!

1782
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,577
This is great!

1783
01:42:36,652 --> 01:42:37,380
Darshana...

1784
01:42:37,453 --> 01:42:38,681
There's no need to be scared

1785
01:42:39,088 --> 01:42:41,079
Just imagine it's
Balya in front of you

1786
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:43,056
Talk like you talk to
him without any inhibitions

1787
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:44,592
Say your dialogues in the same way

1788
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:47,595
Hey Raghya,
don't insult me in front of her

1789
01:42:47,663 --> 01:42:49,722
Hey Mr. Manager, sit down

1790
01:42:49,798 --> 01:42:51,527
Manage our tea!

1791
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:52,760
Hm... I want milk...

1792
01:42:52,835 --> 01:42:54,132
You want milk...

1793
01:42:56,105 --> 01:42:57,470
What is this... shut up...

1794
01:42:59,742 --> 01:43:01,209
Look Darshana

1795
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,471
In any case, Mukya hasn't
given you too many dialogues

1796
01:43:03,545 --> 01:43:04,739
Okay

1797
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:06,641
It's just silent acting...
you'll do it well

1798
01:43:06,715 --> 01:43:07,704
Hm... hm...

1799
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:09,209
So ready?
- Hm...

1800
01:43:09,284 --> 01:43:12,378
Bhau, is your make up done

1801
01:43:12,454 --> 01:43:13,182
Yes, yes, yes!!!

1802
01:43:13,255 --> 01:43:14,244
Then come on out

1803
01:43:15,758 --> 01:43:18,420
Shit! Our hero's all
into lipstick and powder!

1804
01:43:19,428 --> 01:43:20,725
Are you done?

1805
01:43:23,065 --> 01:43:24,157
How does this look?

1806
01:43:24,233 --> 01:43:25,700
Great... it looks great!

1807
01:43:25,768 --> 01:43:27,133
Isn't it... isn't it?

1808
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:36,234
What are my lines?

1809
01:43:37,246 --> 01:43:38,713
I'll tell you
- Hm...

1810
01:43:39,148 --> 01:43:45,212
Romantic love scene...
we see the hero janabhau...

1811
01:43:45,287 --> 01:43:52,591
...and heroine darshana in a boat...
and as we go closer we hear him say...

1812
01:43:53,128 --> 01:43:57,326
You don't understand
what state I am in

1813
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,465
You shouldn't do this

1814
01:44:01,003 --> 01:44:02,527
What had we decided?

1815
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,334
We do it and separate

1816
01:44:04,406 --> 01:44:05,998
We don't get trapped

1817
01:44:08,077 --> 01:44:10,773
But I'm on fire
when you're not there

1818
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,513
Fire in my heart, and body

1819
01:44:15,617 --> 01:44:18,711
Who will douse that fire, Bakula?

1820
01:44:19,254 --> 01:44:22,746
Who knows?
When I come back to this village

1821
01:44:23,058 --> 01:44:25,049
we will meet again

1822
01:44:27,062 --> 01:44:28,029
But...

1823
01:44:33,168 --> 01:44:35,534
But I've got used to you Bakula

1824
01:44:36,205 --> 01:44:38,696
Your body has mesmerised me...

1825
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:51,215
Let me look at you
to my heart's content

1826
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:53,119
Come closer...

1827
01:44:53,255 --> 01:44:55,086
Should I tell you something?

1828
01:44:55,324 --> 01:44:56,188
Of course

1829
01:44:56,692 --> 01:44:58,159
No packet today

1830
01:45:00,329 --> 01:45:02,729
Just what I was thinking

1831
01:45:03,298 --> 01:45:05,425
In fact, I haven't brought a pack

1832
01:45:08,003 --> 01:45:11,404
Come closer to me Bakula

1833
01:45:11,473 --> 01:45:13,737
Hey Raghya, say it's enough...

1834
01:45:14,009 --> 01:45:18,309
Balya, you ass

1835
01:45:18,447 --> 01:45:20,540
You monkey face

1836
01:45:20,682 --> 01:45:22,445
Why did you speak?

1837
01:45:22,518 --> 01:45:24,349
Is this real?

1838
01:45:24,419 --> 01:45:26,250
Is this real?

1839
01:45:26,321 --> 01:45:28,016
The scene was going so well

1840
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:29,387
Why did you speak?

1841
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:32,291
Do one thing...
go sit behind that rock

1842
01:45:32,394 --> 01:45:34,726
Or just drown yourself
in the water... drown, drown

1843
01:45:34,797 --> 01:45:37,129
In any case,
what could we do after this?

1844
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,393
Mukya has written only this much

1845
01:45:38,467 --> 01:45:40,059
The audience will understand

1846
01:45:40,135 --> 01:45:42,160
Insert some flowers or something

1847
01:45:42,271 --> 01:45:43,169
What, Raghya?

1848
01:45:43,272 --> 01:45:45,103
Then show the flowers!!!

1849
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:47,074
Go get them from the market

1850
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:47,768
Go get them

1851
01:45:48,076 --> 01:45:49,065
Go on

1852
01:45:49,745 --> 01:45:52,680
Go now - Should we do it again?

1853
01:45:57,386 --> 01:45:59,183
You fools

1854
01:45:59,254 --> 01:46:03,213
Let the flowers
sort of hug each other

1855
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:05,592
Let the flowers
sort of hug each other

1856
01:46:05,661 --> 01:46:07,060
Let the flowers
sort of hug each other

1857
01:46:07,229 --> 01:46:09,026
I love you...

1858
01:46:09,097 --> 01:46:10,758
I love you...

1859
01:46:11,033 --> 01:46:12,091
Cut it

1860
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:15,068
We've got our first scene

1861
01:46:15,737 --> 01:46:17,705
Our film has started

1862
01:46:17,773 --> 01:46:20,037
Great! - Mukya...!

1863
01:47:10,592 --> 01:47:15,757
Mr. Manager, those flowers were a
great idea! - Thank you, Mr. Director

1864
01:47:15,831 --> 01:47:18,265
We got them on purpose

1865
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,559
Are you satisfied Raghu?

1866
01:47:22,704 --> 01:47:24,831
It's the first time that
I've done anything like this

1867
01:47:25,107 --> 01:47:29,407
Janabhau, I'm intoxicated

1868
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,808
Darshana, your acting is great too

1869
01:47:36,184 --> 01:47:38,345
Looks real...
- Yes, yes

1870
01:47:38,387 --> 01:47:42,756
My work's over. Finished?
- Are you crazy? You have a big role

1871
01:47:42,824 --> 01:47:43,620
Really?

1872
01:47:43,692 --> 01:47:45,421
We are just starting now

1873
01:47:45,494 --> 01:47:47,485
Now tomorrow Mukya
will get a new scene

1874
01:47:47,562 --> 01:47:49,154
We will shoot again tomorrow

1875
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:52,564
After the Professor writes
a new scene, the Director will shoot

1876
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:55,296
Write and shoot; write and shoot

1877
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:58,134
We'll have a blast for 30 days

1878
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:08,044
Hey... Shh... Shh

1879
01:48:09,117 --> 01:48:10,709
Hey... Shh... Shh

1880
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,315
Hey... Shh... Shh

1881
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,286
Don't come here like this

1882
01:48:18,427 --> 01:48:21,294
If someone sees us, there
will be a furore in the village

1883
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:23,726
Who will see?
...And why are you scared?

1884
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:27,795
I am frightened!
What if anyone sees us?

1885
01:48:28,103 --> 01:48:31,072
Who will see...
and why are you scared? - Hm?

1886
01:48:31,206 --> 01:48:33,140
Hm?
- Hm?

1887
01:48:33,608 --> 01:48:35,667
Um... cut, cut

1888
01:48:36,311 --> 01:48:37,778
What's all this "Hm?"

1889
01:48:37,846 --> 01:48:39,211
Don't you know your lines

1890
01:48:39,448 --> 01:48:40,312
No... we do...

1891
01:48:40,382 --> 01:48:43,818
Janabhau, your dialogue is
"I'm not scared of anybody's father"

1892
01:48:44,419 --> 01:48:45,852
Hm
- Hm...

1893
01:48:47,189 --> 01:48:48,850
What's "Hm"?

1894
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:50,553
Come on, repeat it

1895
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:52,354
Yes, come on

1896
01:48:52,427 --> 01:48:54,520
Move... move

1897
01:48:54,863 --> 01:48:57,331
Yes ready

1898
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:59,724
Do the action

1899
01:49:03,271 --> 01:49:05,205
Hey... Shh... shh

1900
01:49:06,074 --> 01:49:07,701
Hey... Shh... shh

1901
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:10,669
Hey... Shh... shh

1902
01:49:12,781 --> 01:49:15,215
Don't come here like this

1903
01:49:15,283 --> 01:49:17,774
If anyone sees us, there
will be a furore in the village

1904
01:49:18,186 --> 01:49:20,677
Who will see?
...And why are you scared?

1905
01:49:21,156 --> 01:49:22,453
I am frightened

1906
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:24,786
What is anyone sees us?

1907
01:49:29,564 --> 01:49:31,361
Um... what else?

1908
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,195
Cut!

1909
01:49:33,268 --> 01:49:35,202
Cut...
what are you saying Janabhau?

1910
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:38,569
What are you saying
- No, I...

1911
01:49:39,608 --> 01:49:41,701
Shit
- What Janabhau?

1912
01:49:41,810 --> 01:49:42,799
I can't handle this

1913
01:49:43,078 --> 01:49:44,545
Wait a little

1914
01:49:45,147 --> 01:49:48,776
Dialogue,
dialogue - Yes, hold on...

1915
01:49:50,652 --> 01:49:53,621
See Janabhau, now the hero finds out

1916
01:49:53,755 --> 01:49:55,552
that the Parrot has got Bakula

1917
01:49:55,724 --> 01:49:57,419
Hm, hm - And he is stunned

1918
01:49:57,726 --> 01:50:00,559
And then,
he comes to this temple...

1919
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:02,722
...to pray to God
that Bakula is cured

1920
01:50:06,101 --> 01:50:08,331
Here, we can see the first signs

1921
01:50:09,438 --> 01:50:12,669
The man starts panting

1922
01:50:16,311 --> 01:50:17,471
Do you understand?

1923
01:50:17,712 --> 01:50:20,237
We are shooting that scene today

1924
01:50:20,315 --> 01:50:21,577
Understood?

1925
01:50:21,616 --> 01:50:23,174
Yes

1926
01:50:23,251 --> 01:50:25,151
Come on Bhau

1927
01:50:25,187 --> 01:50:26,779
There's a rock to the right

1928
01:50:27,055 --> 01:50:28,317
You go and stand there

1929
01:50:28,356 --> 01:50:29,254
And when you see
Darshana's scarf...

1930
01:50:29,324 --> 01:50:31,087
...swaying in the wind...

1931
01:50:31,159 --> 01:50:32,148
Yes, yes

1932
01:50:32,594 --> 01:50:34,323
You start coming back at a run

1933
01:50:34,396 --> 01:50:34,828
Have you understood?

1934
01:50:35,097 --> 01:50:35,688
Yes, yes

1935
01:50:35,764 --> 01:50:37,288
Have you understood?

1936
01:50:37,365 --> 01:50:40,562
And Bhau, don't forget this time

1937
01:50:42,137 --> 01:50:43,195
Hey wait...

1938
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,101
Give me your sunglasses

1939
01:50:44,172 --> 01:50:46,333
Why?
- What "Why"?

1940
01:50:46,508 --> 01:50:48,373
It's a serious scene...
the man is panting for breath

1941
01:50:48,443 --> 01:50:49,603
No time to be stylish!

1942
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:50,835
Shit...

1943
01:50:51,113 --> 01:50:53,308
Go now... And Mukya...

1944
01:50:53,482 --> 01:50:55,211
Janabhau will come running up

1945
01:50:55,283 --> 01:50:57,148
A boy from the temple
gets him some water

1946
01:50:57,219 --> 01:50:58,481
You be that boy - Hm, hm

1947
01:50:58,553 --> 01:50:59,850
And... give me that script

1948
01:51:00,088 --> 01:51:01,146
I will yell out to you

1949
01:51:01,223 --> 01:51:02,212
You cue Darshana

1950
01:51:02,324 --> 01:51:03,484
Okay Darshana?

1951
01:51:03,558 --> 01:51:05,549
Then Darshana waves her
scarf Have you understood?

1952
01:51:05,627 --> 01:51:06,321
Hm, hm

1953
01:51:06,361 --> 01:51:09,091
So ready? Has Bhau gone down?
- Hm

1954
01:51:09,164 --> 01:51:11,325
Call Darshana
- Hm... Hey Darshana

1955
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:13,094
Hey, get out of my way

1956
01:51:13,768 --> 01:51:15,030
Darshana

1957
01:51:34,055 --> 01:51:35,181
Hm, hm

1958
01:51:56,611 --> 01:51:58,579
How long do I wait?

1959
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,378
Janabhau went down,
or did he go home?

1960
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:07,149
Janabhau... - Hm...

1961
01:52:07,322 --> 01:52:09,119
We are ready

1962
01:52:09,524 --> 01:52:11,287
Start coming up now

1963
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:14,455
It's action

1964
01:52:21,203 --> 01:52:22,101
Janabhau too...

1965
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:23,398
...is making a real mess

1966
01:52:24,706 --> 01:52:26,333
What happen Darshana?

1967
01:52:26,408 --> 01:52:28,535
Janabhau too...

1968
01:52:29,244 --> 01:52:30,506
Hey, he's coming

1969
01:52:30,612 --> 01:52:33,308
Hey, he's coming

1970
01:52:33,715 --> 01:52:35,410
Go back; go back

1971
01:52:35,483 --> 01:52:37,678
It's on, it's on...

1972
01:52:37,752 --> 01:52:39,583
It's being recorded

1973
01:53:00,108 --> 01:53:02,303
Brother, why are you
panting so much today?

1974
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:05,004
Brother, why are you
panting so much today?

1975
01:53:12,754 --> 01:53:18,283
Superb Janabhau, superb...
What acting!

1976
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,089
Janabhau... what acting!

1977
01:53:20,161 --> 01:53:22,288
Wow... It felt like
everything was real

1978
01:53:22,364 --> 01:53:23,490
Like everything was real...
Iook at his eyes

1979
01:53:23,565 --> 01:53:25,430
His face is red like he's dying

1980
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,092
Intoxicated Bhau, just intoxicated

1981
01:53:27,168 --> 01:53:29,636
Wait Bhau...
Bhau wait... I'll shoot from close

1982
01:53:29,704 --> 01:53:31,695
Hold that expression
in your eyes Keep panting

1983
01:53:31,773 --> 01:53:33,297
Keep panting... All of you...

1984
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:35,741
Move aside, move aside - You go back

1985
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:39,211
Move aside...
it's a close up... it's a close up

1986
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:43,650
It's a close shot...
Bhau keep panting... keep panting

1987
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:48,152
Now we know the Parrot has got you

1988
01:53:48,256 --> 01:53:50,816
You are here to pray to God

1989
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:56,688
Yes Bhau... four, three, two...

1990
01:53:59,567 --> 01:54:01,467
Yes, cut it...!

1991
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:09,534
Raghya, give me some money

1992
01:55:10,672 --> 01:55:12,503
Janabhau,
let's eat some something here

1993
01:55:12,574 --> 01:55:13,734
Everyone must be hungry

1994
01:55:14,008 --> 01:55:17,444
Hey Mukya...
Come on - I'll get a cigarette

1995
01:55:21,249 --> 01:55:24,013
Mukya, come here...

1996
01:55:24,285 --> 01:55:25,513
just come here...

1997
01:55:27,355 --> 01:55:28,754
Let me see

1998
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:34,318
Five... I've ordered five
- Make one sweet

1999
01:55:35,363 --> 01:55:37,126
Want one?
- No

2000
01:55:38,133 --> 01:55:39,065
Some candy then?

2001
01:55:40,068 --> 01:55:44,664
Am I a kid? Okay, get one...

2002
01:55:46,207 --> 01:55:47,299
Give him one

2003
01:55:48,643 --> 01:55:49,667
I'm saying, Mukya...

2004
01:55:49,744 --> 01:55:51,109
Janabhau...

2005
01:55:57,285 --> 01:55:58,684
I'll give you the money at night

2006
01:55:59,821 --> 01:56:03,279
Mukya, now tell one once again

2007
01:56:04,192 --> 01:56:06,683
How does this condom thing work?

2008
01:56:07,262 --> 01:56:08,752
What? You're asking me
the hero and heroine's names...

2009
01:56:09,063 --> 01:56:10,496
...after I've told
you the whole story?

2010
01:56:10,698 --> 01:56:15,362
No... but is it certain
that one doesn't get...

2011
01:56:15,570 --> 01:56:17,094
...the disease if a condom is used?

2012
01:56:18,406 --> 01:56:19,566
Not exactly that...

2013
01:56:19,774 --> 01:56:23,005
If you don't use one,
you are in danger; that's for sure

2014
01:56:23,211 --> 01:56:25,611
But it also should not be old

2015
01:56:28,183 --> 01:56:29,172
Oh, really...?

2016
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:30,080
Yes

2017
01:56:30,418 --> 01:56:33,444
Like a rusted knife is of no use...

2018
01:56:33,621 --> 01:56:36,181
...an old condom is also useless.
Understand?

2019
01:56:38,593 --> 01:56:40,220
I understand

2020
01:56:41,095 --> 01:56:43,723
ya ya I am getting
some sense of it...

2021
01:56:44,532 --> 01:56:46,261
But what if one doesn't have

2022
01:56:46,334 --> 01:56:48,325
the patience to stop and wear one?

2023
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:53,803
Then flip a coin... heads or tails!

2024
01:56:57,412 --> 01:56:58,572
Can I go; I'm very hungry

2025
01:56:58,646 --> 01:57:00,045
Yes, yes...

2026
01:57:00,348 --> 01:57:02,475
You come too
- Hm... yes, yes...

2027
01:57:47,095 --> 01:57:48,858
His motorbike is still with me

2028
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,597
No no listen

2029
01:57:50,632 --> 01:57:52,793
Yes, all you do as
the Manager is relax!

2030
01:57:52,867 --> 01:57:53,799
Hey, our hero is here

2031
01:57:54,102 --> 01:57:55,467
Come, come, come. Sit, sit down

2032
01:57:55,537 --> 01:57:58,097
Our hero is here. Give him a chair

2033
01:57:58,139 --> 01:58:00,664
The hero's here; the hero's here
- What's all this Raghya?

2034
01:58:00,742 --> 01:58:03,540
Hey Darshana, come out... come on

2035
01:58:03,611 --> 01:58:07,047
How long must you take?
- Why are you calling her?

2036
01:58:07,115 --> 01:58:07,774
You are making a racket

2037
01:58:08,049 --> 01:58:10,483
There are women in my beauty
parlour What do you want done?

2038
01:58:10,752 --> 01:58:13,186
We want something
like a small wound here

2039
01:58:14,455 --> 01:58:15,353
Here?

2040
01:58:15,423 --> 01:58:16,355
Aw...

2041
01:58:16,624 --> 01:58:19,491
I just touched you
Why is there so much pain?

2042
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:26,230
So I have a small boil here?

2043
01:58:26,301 --> 01:58:28,667
Yes, a small boil.
That's what we want, Darshana

2044
01:58:28,736 --> 01:58:30,294
When it breaks, there's a tiny wound

2045
01:58:30,371 --> 01:58:31,565
That's what happens all
over the body with the Parrot

2046
01:58:31,639 --> 01:58:32,663
That's what we want

2047
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:33,764
Really
- Yes

2048
01:58:34,242 --> 01:58:36,301
I can do that; it's very easy

2049
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:38,502
It's a five-minute job
with nail polish and lipstick

2050
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,275
Okay, go quickly

2051
01:58:42,684 --> 01:58:44,276
I'm can't...

2052
01:58:44,419 --> 01:58:45,579
you say.

2053
01:58:45,653 --> 01:58:49,680
Hey, see the hero... see how he looks

2054
01:58:49,757 --> 01:58:53,818
He looks like a hero...
Sitting stylishly on the chair

2055
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:57,754
Hero, I was saying
- Hm...

2056
01:58:58,333 --> 01:59:04,329
In our film... the
hero's wife is pregnant

2057
01:59:04,505 --> 01:59:06,598
You know the story...
- Yes, yes

2058
01:59:06,808 --> 01:59:09,333
So Mukya felt
- No, no... not me... Balya

2059
01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:11,674
Okay Balya... Balya
suggested that...

2060
01:59:11,746 --> 01:59:14,374
We all suggested that...

2061
01:59:14,449 --> 01:59:21,685
Will your wife do the
role of the pregnant wife?

2062
01:59:26,227 --> 01:59:27,319
I didn't say that... He did

2063
01:59:27,395 --> 01:59:31,764
We thought that there's a readymade
pregnant wife in the family

2064
01:59:31,833 --> 01:59:33,801
So why go looking all over?

2065
01:59:34,068 --> 01:59:36,696
And Janabhau,
there's not much dialogue - Hm

2066
01:59:36,771 --> 01:59:39,296
We can work slowly;
do each scene patiently

2067
01:59:39,374 --> 01:59:40,272
Isn't it Raghya?

2068
01:59:40,341 --> 01:59:41,365
And also, you know...

2069
01:59:41,442 --> 01:59:43,342
...No other woman would agree...
- Yes

2070
01:59:43,411 --> 01:59:44,435
...to do this role

2071
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:47,272
And if your wife does it...

2072
01:59:47,348 --> 01:59:49,111
...the acting will also be natural

2073
01:59:49,183 --> 01:59:51,344
The hero is with his own wife!

2074
02:00:14,475 --> 02:00:18,809
Hey, let me go... Let me go

2075
02:00:22,316 --> 02:00:25,376
We'll have to be careful now.

2076
02:00:26,154 --> 02:00:27,121
Why?

2077
02:00:28,256 --> 02:00:30,121
Because...

2078
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:34,057
- and the wife sees the boil
on her man's face...

2079
02:00:39,434 --> 02:00:40,492
What's this?

2080
02:00:41,703 --> 02:00:42,692
What?

2081
02:00:42,737 --> 02:00:45,604
Here, on your lips...

2082
02:01:05,426 --> 02:01:07,189
It's nothing

2083
02:01:07,261 --> 02:01:09,320
Something like a pimple

2084
02:01:09,397 --> 02:01:10,762
What were you saying?

2085
02:01:14,435 --> 02:01:15,561
Forget me...

2086
02:01:16,471 --> 02:01:20,635
What is this bite-like
thing on your lips?

2087
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,708
What?

2088
02:01:26,147 --> 02:01:27,239
This...

2089
02:01:28,049 --> 02:01:32,145
Our bed is cold since
I've become pregnant

2090
02:01:32,687 --> 02:01:35,247
Don't tell me there
is a third person?

2091
02:01:37,692 --> 02:01:38,420
Who?

2092
02:01:38,693 --> 02:01:39,785
Who?

2093
02:01:41,262 --> 02:01:42,251
Yes, who?

2094
02:01:43,131 --> 02:01:43,825
Um, who?

2095
02:01:46,234 --> 02:01:47,462
How do I know who?

2096
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:52,767
When you go out for work,
do you have any affair?

2097
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,740
Hey... what rubbish you speak

2098
02:01:56,744 --> 02:02:00,771
Why would I leave a wonderful
wife like you and go elsewhere?

2099
02:02:01,249 --> 02:02:06,084
Hm... then swear to that
- Of course

2100
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:08,515
I'll swear by you

2101
02:02:11,092 --> 02:02:13,356
Not me... Him... Swear by him

2102
02:02:32,713 --> 02:02:34,544
What's wrong

2103
02:02:39,086 --> 02:02:40,519
Preeti...

2104
02:02:49,764 --> 02:02:51,561
I have messed up

2105
02:02:53,401 --> 02:02:55,562
I have ruined everything

2106
02:02:58,406 --> 02:03:00,738
I have killed our child

2107
02:03:03,077 --> 02:03:04,442
And killed you

2108
02:03:08,449 --> 02:03:12,715
I will go to hell

2109
02:03:20,294 --> 02:03:21,556
What happened?

2110
02:03:23,097 --> 02:03:24,325
What are you doing?

2111
02:03:24,398 --> 02:03:25,456
What's wrong?

2112
02:03:31,606 --> 02:03:36,066
What acting, sister Preeti

2113
02:03:38,145 --> 02:03:39,806
Janabhau's good of course

2114
02:03:40,081 --> 02:03:41,708
But you too aced the scene

2115
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:46,518
Really?

2116
02:03:46,587 --> 02:03:48,350
You made us cry
- Really?

2117
02:03:48,422 --> 02:03:50,481
You made us cry
- Great, great

2118
02:03:50,791 --> 02:03:52,281
Congratulations!

2119
02:03:53,261 --> 02:03:55,593
True...?

2120
02:03:56,364 --> 02:03:59,731
I always wanted to act
as a child but never got a chance

2121
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:02,428
Can I have an autograph

2122
02:04:21,022 --> 02:04:31,796
My breath has frozen halfway

2123
02:04:32,566 --> 02:04:43,409
Darkness has formed all around me

2124
02:04:43,477 --> 02:04:49,245
In this beautiful evening

2125
02:04:49,317 --> 02:04:55,552
The shadows grow

2126
02:04:55,756 --> 02:05:01,194
I am completely bewildered

2127
02:05:01,996 --> 02:05:13,396
My breath has frozen halfway

2128
02:05:34,128 --> 02:05:37,154
My wife is pregnant... She
needs a check-up

2129
02:05:38,099 --> 02:05:40,590
Name?
- Shingre, Janardan Shingre

2130
02:05:41,135 --> 02:05:42,466
Tell me your wife's name

2131
02:05:42,536 --> 02:05:44,231
She's the one who is pregnant, isn't it?
- Preeti Janardan Shingre

2132
02:05:44,438 --> 02:05:45,200
Okay

2133
02:05:47,208 --> 02:05:49,335
Here - Hm...

2134
02:05:52,646 --> 02:05:53,738
Janardan...

2135
02:05:57,618 --> 02:05:58,516
Gunabai...

2136
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:00,982
How come you are here?

2137
02:06:01,355 --> 02:06:03,380
I brought my wife. She is expecting

2138
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:07,094
Good... you're getting
her checked up in time

2139
02:06:11,098 --> 02:06:12,463
This is Rakhi's son

2140
02:06:12,666 --> 02:06:14,429
He lives with me

2141
02:06:15,503 --> 02:06:17,403
He needs a check-up

2142
02:06:18,339 --> 02:06:19,465
And Rakhi?

2143
02:06:21,275 --> 02:06:22,708
Rakhi is no more

2144
02:06:25,112 --> 02:06:26,636
You came to meet her

2145
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:29,515
And the next week...

2146
02:07:03,084 --> 02:07:04,381
All around me

2147
02:07:04,452 --> 02:07:06,079
There are illusions

2148
02:07:06,153 --> 02:07:11,318
Moving in the shadows

2149
02:07:14,328 --> 02:07:16,296
Deep inside me

2150
02:07:16,363 --> 02:07:22,427
Following me every day

2151
02:07:23,437 --> 02:07:26,406
There is no strength left

2152
02:07:26,474 --> 02:07:31,377
But the body continues to run

2153
02:07:31,445 --> 02:07:33,675
Someone

2154
02:07:34,115 --> 02:07:37,107
Help me

2155
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:43,283
I feel scared

2156
02:07:49,663 --> 02:07:52,325
Why did you do all that
shooting stuff in the sun?

2157
02:07:52,633 --> 02:07:54,191
Now you're paying for it

2158
02:07:54,268 --> 02:08:05,702
My breath has frozen halfway

2159
02:08:15,389 --> 02:08:17,152
Now I've finished
writing all the scenes

2160
02:08:17,358 --> 02:08:19,087
But Janabhau's not to be found

2161
02:08:19,326 --> 02:08:21,590
Is he going to come or not?
- Call him

2162
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:40,110
He's not answering

2163
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:44,345
Looks like he's fallen ill

2164
02:08:45,186 --> 02:08:47,211
Now we can't shoot

2165
02:08:50,157 --> 02:08:51,715
Should we go to Mandvewadi?

2166
02:09:05,472 --> 02:09:06,769
Hey Hero!

2167
02:09:08,108 --> 02:09:10,269
Why are you so stressed
about the shooting?

2168
02:09:11,445 --> 02:09:14,812
Don't worry! We're doing great

2169
02:09:15,149 --> 02:09:16,275
Bhau you get well soon

2170
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:18,682
Then we'll start it again. Okay?

2171
02:09:18,819 --> 02:09:20,650
Will I get well now?

2172
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:24,417
Why ever not?

2173
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:26,251
Tell me Preeti sister...

2174
02:09:26,393 --> 02:09:28,554
Did he have fever
again this morning?

2175
02:09:28,629 --> 02:09:32,565
No, he's been better
since early morning

2176
02:09:33,067 --> 02:09:34,227
That's it then

2177
02:09:34,301 --> 02:09:35,529
Do one thing, Bhau

2178
02:09:35,603 --> 02:09:37,127
Rest for today

2179
02:09:37,738 --> 02:09:39,205
We'll start again tomorrow

2180
02:09:39,273 --> 02:09:41,332
Action... cut... action... cut. Okay?

2181
02:09:42,276 --> 02:09:45,734
The fever has gone,
but my whole body is aching

2182
02:09:47,481 --> 02:09:49,608
What if my temperature
goes up again at night?

2183
02:09:51,418 --> 02:09:52,715
And what if that keeps happening?

2184
02:09:52,786 --> 02:09:54,549
Why speak such evil?

2185
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,718
Or let's do one thing

2186
02:09:57,091 --> 02:09:58,752
We'll go to the doctor in Kulpe

2187
02:09:59,226 --> 02:10:00,250
He'll treat your fever

2188
02:10:00,327 --> 02:10:00,691
Yes

2189
02:10:00,761 --> 02:10:01,728
Yes... yes

2190
02:10:01,795 --> 02:10:02,762
Come let's go to him

2191
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:04,292
No... No; no doctor

2192
02:10:08,335 --> 02:10:09,563
I'll get well

2193
02:10:10,371 --> 02:10:11,497
See that?

2194
02:10:12,273 --> 02:10:15,071
I just mentioned the
doctor and he felt better

2195
02:10:16,644 --> 02:10:18,134
Don't worry at all

2196
02:10:18,779 --> 02:10:20,337
He'll get well

2197
02:10:21,315 --> 02:10:22,339
We'll leave now

2198
02:10:23,217 --> 02:10:25,208
We'll come to pick you up tomorrow

2199
02:10:25,686 --> 02:10:28,086
Sister, let us know
if there's any problem - Yes

2200
02:10:28,155 --> 02:10:30,419
If necessary, I can get
the doctor here even at night!

2201
02:10:30,491 --> 02:10:32,356
He's our hero! Look after him

2202
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:34,457
Take care Bhau

2203
02:10:35,462 --> 02:10:37,430
See you Preeti sister
- Yes

2204
02:10:37,598 --> 02:10:41,728
May we leave now?
- Yes, thank you

2205
02:10:52,613 --> 02:10:54,774
Why didn't you want
to go to the doctor?

2206
02:10:57,651 --> 02:10:59,778
I don't think that will help

2207
02:11:01,055 --> 02:11:02,249
Will you make me some tea?

2208
02:11:03,157 --> 02:11:04,215
Yes

2209
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:06,524
With some extra sugar

2210
02:11:14,435 --> 02:11:16,027
There's no fever

2211
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:32,550
Now only the final bits are left

2212
02:11:33,387 --> 02:11:35,048
But Janya's gone and fallen sick

2213
02:11:35,356 --> 02:11:37,221
He is looking very upset

2214
02:11:38,325 --> 02:11:40,691
Do you think Janabhau has malaria?

2215
02:11:41,328 --> 02:11:43,228
No, I think it's all in his mind

2216
02:11:43,464 --> 02:11:45,591
He's giving everything to this role

2217
02:11:46,066 --> 02:11:48,660
Do you mean Darshana doesn't?

2218
02:11:48,736 --> 02:11:50,169
She's also giving
it her heart and soul

2219
02:11:50,237 --> 02:11:51,067
Yes, my friend, yes

2220
02:11:51,138 --> 02:11:54,164
Did anyone say anything
against your darling Darshana?

2221
02:11:54,341 --> 02:11:57,333
But this guy is really
deep into his character

2222
02:11:57,811 --> 02:11:59,369
It's like he feels this film is real

2223
02:11:59,446 --> 02:12:01,471
Now even I feel
that our film is real

2224
02:12:02,182 --> 02:12:03,376
What do you mean?

2225
02:12:04,218 --> 02:12:06,686
I don't like Janabhau's symptoms

2226
02:12:46,427 --> 02:12:50,261
The camera will move
and then stop here

2227
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:52,764
Hey writer,
is this spot okay for filming?

2228
02:12:54,301 --> 02:12:55,359
If you like it, that's fine!

2229
02:12:55,436 --> 02:12:56,596
There's the Sunset Point behind

2230
02:12:56,637 --> 02:12:58,696
We'll start as soon as
the artistes finish their make-up

2231
02:12:58,772 --> 02:12:59,500
Raghya...

2232
02:12:59,573 --> 02:13:01,336
Is the make-up done?

2233
02:13:02,643 --> 02:13:05,635
Enough! I can't go on
- Hm... What's wrong?

2234
02:13:05,712 --> 02:13:07,543
This is not true...

2235
02:13:09,183 --> 02:13:10,081
What is not true?

2236
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:12,050
This film is yours...

2237
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:17,579
It's false, it's no good;
it's useless It's all wrong

2238
02:13:20,594 --> 02:13:22,061
What's wrong Bhau?

2239
02:13:22,496 --> 02:13:23,724
Did we do something wrong?

2240
02:13:23,797 --> 02:13:25,560
Is there such a story

2241
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:28,533
This ass Mukya will
write whatever he wants

2242
02:13:28,569 --> 02:13:30,298
And you make me act

2243
02:13:30,704 --> 02:13:33,104
I don't understand

2244
02:13:33,507 --> 02:13:36,374
There's nothing like this AIDS

2245
02:13:36,543 --> 02:13:38,738
It's all false

2246
02:13:38,812 --> 02:13:41,144
But we met the doctor

2247
02:13:41,215 --> 02:13:42,512
We got information

2248
02:13:43,116 --> 02:13:45,277
You went and actually met that woman

2249
02:13:45,352 --> 02:13:46,546
How could it be false?

2250
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:48,679
Yes... I saw her...

2251
02:13:49,556 --> 02:13:51,581
And now you will write my story

2252
02:13:52,125 --> 02:13:54,218
And show it to everyone... My story

2253
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:59,122
Are you feeling uneasy?

2254
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,498
Let it be

2255
02:14:00,567 --> 02:14:02,125
We'll shoot later

2256
02:14:02,336 --> 02:14:03,360
We'll do it tomorrow

2257
02:14:03,437 --> 02:14:06,531
Not tomorrow, not ever!
I don't want to do your film

2258
02:14:08,475 --> 02:14:09,999
But what's wrong?

2259
02:14:10,511 --> 02:14:12,536
It's nearly over
- Exactly

2260
02:14:13,046 --> 02:14:15,708
It's all over... everything

2261
02:14:16,683 --> 02:14:19,379
Forget your film

2262
02:14:20,787 --> 02:14:25,224
You chose this topic on purpose

2263
02:14:26,426 --> 02:14:28,656
And then wrote the story

2264
02:14:30,297 --> 02:14:35,166
And then you all decided to...

2265
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:38,033
You made me the hero

2266
02:14:41,808 --> 02:14:43,503
I don't want to do this

2267
02:14:45,178 --> 02:14:47,078
I can't handle all this

2268
02:14:49,383 --> 02:14:53,376
What are you saying Janabhau?

2269
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:59,590
Right from the first day,
I've felt that you have some problem

2270
02:15:02,062 --> 02:15:03,324
What's wrong?

2271
02:15:04,698 --> 02:15:05,665
What has happened...?

2272
02:15:07,668 --> 02:15:08,760
The Parrot!!

2273
02:15:13,173 --> 02:15:16,233
I thought it was all fun and games

2274
02:15:17,377 --> 02:15:19,277
But the fun turned evil

2275
02:15:22,749 --> 02:15:25,411
Why did we have to look
for an AIDS case in the village?

2276
02:15:28,555 --> 02:15:30,750
The case is standing
right in front of you

2277
02:15:34,661 --> 02:15:37,459
Rakhi left me with the Parrot

2278
02:15:39,766 --> 02:15:42,030
Now Rakhi's cot is vacant

2279
02:15:44,137 --> 02:15:46,298
Now, I will be there

2280
02:15:49,209 --> 02:15:52,406
Janabhau, didn't you take care?

2281
02:15:58,185 --> 02:16:00,050
I can't remember

2282
02:16:05,592 --> 02:16:07,526
I don't know anything

2283
02:16:59,579 --> 02:17:01,444
It's all over!

2284
02:17:04,117 --> 02:17:06,210
No use living any more

2285
02:17:09,156 --> 02:17:11,181
I'm ashamed of myself

2286
02:17:14,761 --> 02:17:16,661
Now I will take my own life

2287
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:19,255
Mukya, hold him...

2288
02:17:19,332 --> 02:17:20,230
Janabhau, wait... wait

2289
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:22,291
What are you doing?

2290
02:17:22,436 --> 02:17:24,097
Everyone makes mistakes

2291
02:17:24,171 --> 02:17:25,798
You made a mistake

2292
02:17:26,073 --> 02:17:28,303
Now you must... we must fight

2293
02:17:28,375 --> 02:17:30,309
Fight? With whom?

2294
02:17:31,211 --> 02:17:33,406
There must be somebody
opposite you to fight

2295
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:35,707
This demon has entered me

2296
02:17:36,283 --> 02:17:38,808
I'll go to Jyotiba's hill and...
- No...

2297
02:17:39,419 --> 02:17:41,478
Mukya, hold his legs; make him sit

2298
02:17:42,556 --> 02:17:45,252
Make him sit down; sit down

2299
02:17:45,325 --> 02:17:48,852
Relax Janabhau... relax
- Relax... relax

2300
02:17:50,330 --> 02:17:52,161
Now what do we do, doctor?

2301
02:17:53,867 --> 02:17:56,700
Please, do everything
you can to save our Janabhau

2302
02:17:57,471 --> 02:18:00,372
We will all try

2303
02:18:01,208 --> 02:18:03,369
We'll do whatever we have to

2304
02:18:03,443 --> 02:18:05,206
But we have to save him

2305
02:18:05,278 --> 02:18:07,337
Look Raghunath... just quieten down

2306
02:18:07,414 --> 02:18:09,575
And listen to what I'm saying

2307
02:18:09,716 --> 02:18:11,411
Unless we run some tests...

2308
02:18:11,485 --> 02:18:13,544
...we cannot find out
if Janardan has AIDS or not

2309
02:18:15,288 --> 02:18:19,190
But doctor,
he seems to have the same symptoms

2310
02:18:22,596 --> 02:18:26,123
It's like the books you gave us

2311
02:18:27,667 --> 02:18:30,067
He didn't take any care doctor

2312
02:18:31,471 --> 02:18:33,336
He didn't use a condom

2313
02:18:34,241 --> 02:18:35,401
Yes, there is a danger

2314
02:18:35,675 --> 02:18:38,667
But medical science cannot make
any diagnosis without being sure

2315
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:43,108
We cannot categorically
say that he has AIDS

2316
02:18:43,517 --> 02:18:47,283
Basically, every patient who is
HIV positive doesn't necessarily have AIDS

2317
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:49,149
There are two forms of the virus

2318
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:51,580
One - HIV1

2319
02:18:52,092 --> 02:18:53,821
And two - HIV2

2320
02:18:54,327 --> 02:18:57,125
Now if Janardan has been
infected with any of them

2321
02:18:57,164 --> 02:18:59,291
We will have to test his blood

2322
02:18:59,332 --> 02:19:00,424
As soon as possible

2323
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,297
In fact, rightaway

2324
02:19:02,536 --> 02:19:04,470
I'll instruct Mr. Patil

2325
02:19:04,604 --> 02:19:07,471
He will tell you where
and how to do this test

2326
02:19:09,643 --> 02:19:12,635
Janardan,
have you informed your family...

2327
02:19:12,813 --> 02:19:15,043
...that you are getting tested?

2328
02:19:25,292 --> 02:19:27,692
My wife is pregnant

2329
02:19:32,332 --> 02:19:39,363
My disease is in her
and hers is in the child

2330
02:19:46,546 --> 02:19:48,480
Please save them doctor

2331
02:19:52,118 --> 02:19:53,779
What crime have they committed?

2332
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:35,784
The doctor will give
the reports by tomorrow

2333
02:21:40,126 --> 02:21:42,321
Here, drink this...

2334
02:21:43,763 --> 02:21:46,323
Don't lose heart Bhau

2335
02:21:48,101 --> 02:21:53,403
The doctor says that the
disease may not have got you

2336
02:21:56,176 --> 02:21:58,076
I can feel it inside

2337
02:22:01,514 --> 02:22:03,675
Six months ago, Rakhi came here

2338
02:22:05,251 --> 02:22:07,276
That was the time when I went to her

2339
02:22:10,156 --> 02:22:15,321
After that,
it's been like the books say

2340
02:22:15,762 --> 02:22:17,286
My stomach was upset...

2341
02:22:17,797 --> 02:22:20,231
Then my throat hurt...

2342
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:22,331
Then I had fever...

2343
02:22:27,207 --> 02:22:29,175
Why do those tests?

2344
02:22:34,647 --> 02:22:36,512
I'll suffer for myself

2345
02:22:38,618 --> 02:22:42,748
But what about Preeti and the baby?

2346
02:22:46,326 --> 02:22:47,793
Nothing will go wrong, Janabhau

2347
02:22:48,428 --> 02:22:49,690
My father always says...

2348
02:22:50,597 --> 02:22:52,656
If you don't harm anyone in life...

2349
02:22:53,133 --> 02:22:54,498
...you won't come to any harm

2350
02:22:54,701 --> 02:22:55,463
Yes...

2351
02:23:01,374 --> 02:23:05,242
Bhau, we won't allow
any harm to come to you...

2352
02:23:06,613 --> 02:23:09,173
We won't let you die...

2353
02:23:09,249 --> 02:23:11,479
Who are you guys?

2354
02:23:11,751 --> 02:23:13,514
Why are you coming close to me?

2355
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:15,482
I'm infected

2356
02:23:16,289 --> 02:23:19,725
You will get my disease too.
Move away

2357
02:23:22,662 --> 02:23:26,689
Go away, all of you...

2358
02:23:49,322 --> 02:23:50,448
Janabhau...

2359
02:23:53,159 --> 02:23:54,820
...This is not right

2360
02:23:56,596 --> 02:24:01,727
Touching or sitting
close is not harmful

2361
02:24:04,471 --> 02:24:09,568
And timely action
can even save the baby

2362
02:24:10,543 --> 02:24:14,673
If anything is to happen,
let it happen to all of us

2363
02:24:16,282 --> 02:24:17,476
Let the world know...

2364
02:24:19,185 --> 02:24:21,119
...what true friendship means

2365
02:25:09,669 --> 02:25:13,127
Hey get up... wake up

2366
02:25:13,206 --> 02:25:16,573
Raghya... wake up
- What's wrong?

2367
02:25:16,643 --> 02:25:18,338
I can't see Janabhau

2368
02:25:18,745 --> 02:25:20,679
He must have gone to take a leak

2369
02:25:20,747 --> 02:25:22,078
Ask that man

2370
02:25:22,148 --> 02:25:25,242
Hey brother...
our friend was sleeping here

2371
02:25:25,318 --> 02:25:26,615
Did you see him?
- No

2372
02:25:28,288 --> 02:25:29,687
He is saying "No"

2373
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:36,151
Come on... let's find him

2374
02:26:05,058 --> 02:26:06,423
He is not to be seen

2375
02:26:06,492 --> 02:26:08,517
Found him...
- Where?

2376
02:26:08,728 --> 02:26:10,252
Then why didn't you bring him along?

2377
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:12,730
He left the hospital
- What?

2378
02:26:13,199 --> 02:26:15,099
His test results were
to come in the morning

2379
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:17,068
He got up,
took them and went somewhere

2380
02:26:17,337 --> 02:26:19,237
That's what that woman there told me

2381
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,665
I hope he hasn't
done something terrible

2382
02:26:23,042 --> 02:26:25,408
Come on... Come with me

2383
02:26:25,445 --> 02:26:27,003
Yes... but where?

2384
02:26:27,046 --> 02:26:30,072
Didn't he say he would go...

2385
02:26:30,283 --> 02:26:32,046
...to Jyotiba's hill?

2386
02:26:33,586 --> 02:26:35,781
Come on, hurry up!

2387
02:26:58,544 --> 02:27:00,307
Janabhau!

2388
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:02,143
Bhau!

2389
02:27:02,181 --> 02:27:05,048
Janabhau!

2390
02:27:12,091 --> 02:27:15,686
Janabhau!

2391
02:27:25,738 --> 02:27:27,262
Stop!

2392
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:30,707
Stop, Bhau!

2393
02:27:36,749 --> 02:27:39,343
Bhau, we are here. Please look at us

2394
02:27:39,419 --> 02:27:40,852
Please look... please step back

2395
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:42,747
We won't let you go like this Bhau

2396
02:27:43,456 --> 02:27:45,253
Bhau... Bhau, you don't worry

2397
02:27:45,325 --> 02:27:47,384
Show us those papers...
show us Bhau

2398
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:50,156
There must be some
medicines for this somewhere

2399
02:27:50,263 --> 02:27:51,195
You don't worry Bhau

2400
02:27:51,264 --> 02:27:52,754
We will all look for them
- Yes

2401
02:27:52,832 --> 02:27:53,856
Preeti sister must
be waiting for you

2402
02:27:54,133 --> 02:27:56,260
Don't do something crazy
- Yes, don't be crazy

2403
02:27:56,336 --> 02:27:57,530
Come here... please

2404
02:28:11,351 --> 02:28:13,182
Why search for medication?

2405
02:28:14,454 --> 02:28:18,322
Medicines are for those
Whose disease can be cured

2406
02:28:20,293 --> 02:28:22,284
But when someone is not infected...

2407
02:28:22,628 --> 02:28:24,255
...why would he need medicine?

2408
02:28:31,604 --> 02:28:33,265
Screw that Parrot!

2409
02:28:33,339 --> 02:28:36,308
Nothing's wrong with me!

2410
02:28:36,642 --> 02:28:39,167
Janabhau...

2411
02:29:00,767 --> 02:29:03,327
But the bastard
took Rakhi's life...

2412
02:29:05,505 --> 02:29:07,063
I was saved

2413
02:29:08,408 --> 02:29:10,035
But I have learnt my lesson

2414
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:13,372
I will never make this mistake again

2415
02:29:15,248 --> 02:29:17,808
Nor will I allow
anyone else to do it!

2416
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:21,546
I was saved

2417
02:29:23,356 --> 02:29:25,051
But I have learnt my lesson

2418
02:29:26,793 --> 02:29:29,489
I will never make this mistake again

2419
02:29:31,330 --> 02:29:34,231
Nor will I allow
anyone else to do it!

2420
02:30:43,336 --> 02:30:46,328
Raghunath Hiwale... never
became a hero...

2421
02:30:46,405 --> 02:30:48,839
...but the entire village
calls him a hero now

2422
02:30:49,108 --> 02:30:52,805
He makes documentaries
for government.

2423
02:30:53,679 --> 02:30:56,546
Mukund Borate... still
has not cleared his 12th...

2424
02:30:56,616 --> 02:31:00,313
...but his stories are
printed in small magazines now

2425
02:31:00,486 --> 02:31:03,751
Bakul Chinchukey... still keeps lying
but he is using his talent for good...

2426
02:31:04,023 --> 02:31:06,150
...he is a successful salesman now.

2427
02:31:06,492 --> 02:31:11,191
And myself... Janardan Shingre...
learnt the hard way and now

2428
02:31:11,264 --> 02:31:13,425
I teach whatever happens
one must not do anything

2429
02:31:13,499 --> 02:31:17,196
that makes a POPAT(PARROT)
Out of you...
