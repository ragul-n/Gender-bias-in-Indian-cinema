1
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:11,678
stop!

2
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,448
No!

3
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,403
No, Durga. You cannot kill me.
You've murdered your..

4
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,845
..husband in broad daylight.
Hundreds have witnessed the act.

5
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:22,857
Yet you insist you've
committed no crime!

6
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,654
12 years!

7
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:27,986
For 12 long years he tortured me!

8
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:31,389
Used to bea t me up mercilessly!

9
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:36,802
I worked for a living,
and he blew it..

10
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,474
..all up on liquor and gambling.

11
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,006
Due to these vices..

12
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:49,009
..he even sold off the house
and the household articles.

13
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,447
And ultima tely, when he
had nothing else, he left.

14
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,649
Then he..

15
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:02,792
Four of those fools kept clawing
me all through the night!

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,732
And he, he just stared
while enjoying his drink.

17
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,338
Tell me, Judge, are
husbands like tha t?

18
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,343
No! He wasn't a husband !

19
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,935
In fact he wasn't even
a human being.

20
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,417
Tha t's why I killed the beast!

21
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:28,352
This court sympa thizes with Durga.

22
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,985
But, her crime is
beyond forgiveness!

23
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,585
Hence, the accused, Durga..

24
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:36,325
..is hereby sentenced to
1 4 years of imprisonment.

25
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,467
Mom!

26
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:40,593
Deva !

27
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,728
My son !

28
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:47,333
My dear!
- Please don't leave me, mom!

29
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,404
Please don't take my mother away.

30
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:52,605
sir!

31
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,484
Please let my mom go!
You've arrested her!

32
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:59,385
If you tell them,
they'll let her go.

33
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:03,390
I've no one else but my mom.
I beg of you, sir!

34
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,451
Please release my mom!
- Deva, my son !

35
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,720
Mom!

36
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,389
Don't take my mom away!

37
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,989
Don't take my mom away.

38
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,330
Let go!

39
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:17,463
My child !

40
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:20,534
Pushpa ! You here?

41
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,346
Don't you think
the law has penalized..

42
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:28,008
..the son along with his mom?

43
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,478
No.

44
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,448
Leave! Hey!

45
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:43,392
No! -
Deva !

46
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:51,339
Mom! -
Deva !

47
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:54,801
Mom!

48
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,610
Mom!

49
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,455
Mom! No!

50
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:56,939
''On us your servants, O' lord,
shower your blessings.''

51
00:05:57,006 --> 00:06:05,812
''On us your servants, O' lord,
shower your blessings.''

52
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:10,545
''May we inculca te all virtues!''

53
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:14,852
''May we inculca te all virtues!''

54
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:19,394
''May we overcome all vices!''

55
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:27,995
''On us your servants, O' lord,
shower your blessings.''

56
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,396
which beggar have my
parents brought home?

57
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,346
I'm not hungry.

58
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,402
Hey Deva, did your
mom kill your dad?

59
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,471
Tell us, why did your
mom kill your dad?

60
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,471
wha t? You won't go to school?

61
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:55,950
No, I won't! Everyone there
asks me why mom killed dad.

62
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:58,478
I don't want to study!

63
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,987
Hey sweets, get up!
- Let go!

64
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,328
stop being shy.
- save me!

65
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,458
Come.

66
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:14,460
Let go of me!

67
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,403
No!
- Ca tch the lousy woman.

68
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,464
Help me!

69
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:13,977
''May we harbour no enmity,
nor animosity!''

70
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:22,927
''In this world, tha t's like a home,
may there be no stranger!''

71
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:31,463
''In this world, tha t's like a home,
may there be no stranger!''

72
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,874
''May there be no stranger!''

73
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:48,787
''For this happy family,
You are the whole world !''

74
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:53,385
''May we inculca te all virtues!''

75
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,523
''May we inculca te all virtues!''

76
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,865
''May we overcome all vices.''

77
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:10,402
''On us your servants, O' lord,
shower your blessings.''

78
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:15,406
How many times have
I told you, my son..

79
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,352
..to pay obeisance to the Lord !

80
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:20,650
And many a times have
I told you, mom..

81
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,383
..tha t you are the Goddess I behold !

82
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,984
I don't bow to a sculpted idol.

83
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,460
Neither do you bow before the law.

84
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,588
wha t has my son done now?

85
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,991
Do you see these blood stains?

86
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,736
Your son's quite likely to have
bea ten up someone mercilessly.

87
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,606
where've you been so early in
the morning? Jogging? Or war?

88
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:47,481
Idiots also go
out for morning walks.

89
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,382
They were trying to
rape a poor girl.

90
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,379
It was my duty to help her.

91
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,753
But wasn't it your duty
to inform the law?

92
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,317
Your favourite, the law,
was fast asleep.

93
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,398
Besides, by the time
the law reached her..

94
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,732
..she'd probably be pregnant!

95
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:08,861
Do you hear him?

96
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,735
so, wherever the law
takes time to reach..

97
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:13,874
..you dispense justice?

98
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,342
Delayed justice is
injustice in itself.

99
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,344
Usually, the law dispenses justice..

100
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:24,351
..after the plaintiff is deceased.

101
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,980
The ha tred I see for
the law within you gives me..

102
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,993
..the feeling tha t you'll surely
land in big time trouble one day.

103
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,528
Dad, I feel, when
tha t day does dawn..

104
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,660
..it would be none but you
who would be handcuffing him.

105
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,328
I haven't asked you for advice.

106
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,869
sorry, dad !

107
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,533
For the last time, Deva..
- Enough for now!

108
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,933
Must you start your
day on such a note?

109
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:53,414
Go get ready for work else,
you might be la te again.

110
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,882
Laxmi, serve breakfast.

111
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,879
I'm afraid, Pushpa..

112
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:02,448
..tha t one of these days I might..

113
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,992
..have to confront your son
in my official capacity.

114
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,925
I pray to god I don't
have to see tha t dawn !

115
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:12,331
No ma tter who wins then
the loss would be mine.

116
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,995
And hence, I keep asking you
to get Deva on the right pa th.

117
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,595
why must he indulge in
the things I disapprove of?

118
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:21,336
Tell me, why must he work
as a mechanic in a garage?

119
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,346
well, your dad left you
property worth millions.

120
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:28,008
why then did you have
to work as a cop?

121
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,983
I'm not working out of compulsion
but for my pleasure.

122
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,351
He does it for his pride!

123
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,517
He doesn't want to
ask you for money.

124
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,725
I thought you love me the most.

125
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:47,596
Now I realize you love
your son more than me.

126
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:58,743
Excuse me, mister!

127
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,475
wait.
- wha t's it?

128
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,483
Let me help you cross the street.
- Thank you !

129
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,853
were you born blind?
- No!

130
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,390
These eyes have seen a lot..

131
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,862
..but, suddenly, an accident!
- Accident?

132
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,989
A tragic one.

133
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,330
Care to hear?
- Go on.

134
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,536
2 years ago, I was crossing
a road, just like now.

135
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,405
A car came before me.

136
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,339
And then, we dashed !

137
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:33,002
Darkness has set into
my life ever since.

138
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,351
Being poor, I can't even
get my eyes cured.

139
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,786
I can't be of much help, lady.

140
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,654
All I can let you have is my salary.

141
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:45,920
Thank you very much !

142
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:49,455
Oh, how I wish, every policeman
was as magnanimous as you !

143
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,858
Policeman !

144
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,472
How did you know I'm one?

145
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:03,001
when you'd taken my hand, I'd
felt the ba ton you're carrying.

146
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,938
Only two types of people use sticks.

147
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,411
The blind and the police.

148
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,474
Compliments on your
excellent perception !

149
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,732
You thief! shyness has
never even touched you..

150
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,537
..and they named you sharmilee!

151
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,406
when are you going
to mend your ways?

152
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,808
Marry me and I'll be
straight right away.

153
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,474
Just take me home as your bride!

154
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,384
I take you home and you'd
swindle me right off my house!

155
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,388
C'mon Deva. I wouldn't chea t you
- I see!

156
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,984
I'd serve you ! I'll
raise your family!

157
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,459
I'll take care of them.

158
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,394
Move! You can't be trusted !

159
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,330
You'd ra ther be selling
the kids off!

160
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,335
No! Just marry me.

161
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,597
And I'll make you, oh, so happy!

162
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,730
why don't you ask the astrologer
if you don't believe me?

163
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:10,401
Marry me. And, your
life will be made!

164
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,474
I'd ra ther marry a witch !

165
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,812
Not you !

166
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:02,461
''I'm your lovebird,
and you're mine.''

167
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:10,599
''I'm your lovebird,
and you're mine.''

168
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:17,407
''we'd fly the open skies,
with none to fear.''

169
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,344
''It's happened.''
- ''wha t?''

170
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,540
''Love's happened.''

171
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:23,550
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

172
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,483
''Love's happened.''

173
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:38,457
''Had you been my lovebird,
and I'd been yours.''

174
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:42,594
''Had you been my lovebird,
and I'd been yours.''

175
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,400
''You would've..''

176
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:48,936
''You'd turn me restless.
And I'd go sleepless.''

177
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,342
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

178
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,472
''Love's happened.''

179
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:16,737
''You're my lover! I'd
write it on the walls.''

180
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:21,401
''I'd lower my eyes, and
write it on the skies too.''

181
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,480
''You're my lover! I'd
write it on the walls.''

182
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:33,851
''I'd lower my eyes, and
write it on the skies too.''

183
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,947
''Let me go! Let me go!''

184
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:42,454
''You ride high on passion,
you've lost your senses.''

185
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:46,729
''I'm sure you're out to malign me.''

186
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:51,534
''You're my love. say
tha t you love me too.''

187
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,872
''These love talks are useless.''

188
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,941
''There'd be nothing..''

189
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,978
''There'd be nothing in the world,
if there wasn't love!''

190
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,349
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

191
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,582
''Love's happened.''

192
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,324
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

193
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:12,519
''Love's happened.''

194
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:50,859
''The heart bea ts fast
whenever I see you.''

195
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:55,392
''Attractive man, you've
made me crazy.''

196
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,405
''Let go. Let me go.''

197
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:03,468
''stop it, don't praise me so.''

198
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:07,948
''stop following me. Your
intentions don't seem fair.''

199
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,680
''Make me yours, this
heart's restless.''

200
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:17,521
''I refused earlier, and tha t stays.''

201
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,327
''Life's going..''

202
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:25,399
''Life's going, but I
don't feel the pain.''

203
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,458
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

204
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:28,661
''Love's happened.''

205
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,668
''It's happened.'' - ''wha t?''

206
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,469
'Love's happened.''

207
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,739
''I'd be your lovebird,
and you'd be mine.''

208
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:42,010
''I'd be your lovebird,
and you'd be mine.''

209
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,414
''we'd fly the open skies.''

210
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,584
''we'd fly the open skies,
with none to fear.''

211
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,716
''It's happened.''
- ''wha t?''

212
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,918
''Love's happened.''

213
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,927
''It's happened.''
- ''wha t?''

214
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,930
''Love's happened.''

215
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:18,545
C'mon !

216
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:27,722
Give it a hard push.

217
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:30,523
C'mon guys!

218
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:42,938
This is chea ting, man. This is..

219
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:50,349
You guys have already got my
brother hooked onto all the vices.

220
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:52,477
Are you getting him onto girls too?

221
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:57,321
I've seen tha t girl
going around with you.

222
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,383
she's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- she was.

223
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,928
As of now, she's Karan's.

224
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,397
It's quite common among friends.

225
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,458
I know you very well!

226
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,802
And now, I know wha t
sort of a girl she is!

227
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:12,930
speak for yourself. Are
you getting jealous?

228
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,538
My brother's exams
are round the corner.

229
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,348
stay away from him, or else..

230
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,474
well, wha t would you do?

231
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:34,327
who are you to thrash my friends?

232
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,796
Look, brother!
- Don't you ever call me brother!

233
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,458
You call my mom as mom, fine!

234
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:42,594
Fine if you call my dad as dad.
I can tolera te tha t.

235
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,535
But don't ever call
me brother. Got it?

236
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:49,604
Karan, they're not friends,
they're actually your foes!

237
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:53,402
I know well who my
friends and foes are!

238
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:57,377
My foe isn't outside,
he's within this house

239
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:02,548
Just think, Karan ! The girl tha t
flirts so outrageously with you..

240
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,319
..just think about the sort
of girl she could be.

241
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,460
she's a disgraced girl.

242
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,586
Disgraced !

243
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,590
Do you know who's the
most disgraced one?

244
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,458
You !

245
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:16,394
Your dad..

246
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:19,873
..wanted to force your
mom into flesh trade.

247
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,674
Your mom killed her husband !

248
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,681
You've forgotten it, I presume!
Hence, I remind you.

249
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,686
Your dad was an agent.
Your mom was a killer.

250
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,549
Tha t girl can't be more
disgraced than your mom.

251
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:43,396
Had anyone else said these words..

252
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,730
..I'd have killed him!

253
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,332
Thank your mom, the one I worship.

254
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,600
For her sake, I let you live!

255
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,742
Mom! Must you slap me for him?

256
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:08,449
He is a son of this family,
just as you are!

257
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,920
The difference being
tha t he's far better!

258
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:16,987
Oh? Tha t uneduca ted fool!

259
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:20,592
It's all thanks to you !

260
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:28,606
Dare hurt my son again, and you'll
deal not with me, but your dad.

261
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:29,734
Understand?

262
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:43,581
Deva !

263
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:46,650
My son !

264
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,526
Mom!
- Yes, my son !

265
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:08,477
The one whom I gave birth,
I could nurture him.

266
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:12,580
I can only give you sorrows, son !

267
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,446
No, mom! Don't say tha t!

268
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:22,862
sometimes I feel I've got you here
to bear nothing but humilia tion !

269
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:27,467
For the love you and
dad have given me

270
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,003
I can tolera te this humilia tion
all my life!

271
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:36,409
son, Karan is not bad a t heart!

272
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:37,870
He's just imma ture.

273
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:41,006
One day, he'll surely
understand you.

274
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,344
when, mom?

275
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,879
when will he understand me?

276
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:58,328
You've been off mood since evening !

277
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,995
Fed up of me?

278
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:06,804
No, Amrita ! Can I get fed up of you?

279
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:10,740
well then, with me around,
where are you lost?

280
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,011
Thinking about Deva !

281
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,883
He dared to threa ten me today.

282
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,954
You know, he came to
my house as a beggar.

283
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,650
Today, my parents love
him more than me!

284
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:28,727
He's taken my share of love!

285
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,465
I fear he might stake a claim
to my share of inheritance too!

286
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,404
He is a clever fool!

287
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,605
Hello!
- Amrita..

288
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,608
..it's time for your show.
- I'll be there right away, Rocky.

289
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:53,577
Hey Karan. C'mon, relax.

290
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:56,755
Go freshen up. I've to go, okay?

291
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:06,790
so, you're drunk!

292
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,799
Do you know wha t'll happen
if your dad finds out?

293
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,930
He'd throw me out, wha t else?

294
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:17,669
As such, people in this
house need Deva, not me!

295
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:19,872
wha t has the poor guy done to you?

296
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:23,542
why do you ha te him so?
- I ha te him because..

297
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,481
..you love him so much !

298
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:34,394
Yes, I do! Because, he
has nothing but my love!

299
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,524
The ill-fa ted boy lost
everything as a child.

300
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,459
Had I not granted
him motherly shelter..

301
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:44,530
..wha t would've happened
to the poor orphan?

302
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,469
And tha t reduced your love for me!

303
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:52,342
sharing love doesn't
reduce it, Karan !

304
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:57,544
why then do I feel I receive
so little of your love?

305
00:28:58,553 --> 00:28:59,952
There must be some reason, right?

306
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:04,313
Is it tha t you've given
him all your..

307
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:08,453
..love lest he feels
like a stranger here?

308
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,326
And here I am..

309
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:18,338
A stranger in my own home!

310
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,872
Don't think of it tha t way, my son !

311
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:27,007
Deva was 9 when I brought him here.

312
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,543
And you, I've borne you
for 9 months in my womb!

313
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:32,985
You're a part of me!

314
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:35,855
None can replace you !

315
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,721
You took this little folly
of mine to your heart!

316
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,988
Don't I even have this
right as your mom?

317
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,729
If it's a ma tter of rights, take
my life, and I won't say a word.

318
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:52,998
But, if for Deva's sake,
you ever strike me again..

319
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,478
..I'll simply go away.

320
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,604
No, Karan.

321
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:04,542
I'll die if you leave me!

322
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,584
I can't live without you !

323
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,725
Uncle!
- wha t's it, sharmilee?

324
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,326
This Mr. Duggal. He's expected
to come this way, isn't tha t so?

325
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:26,671
He isn't a penny-pincher like
us. He's a wealthy man.

326
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,005
Must be stuck up in work.
He must be here soon.

327
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:31,869
A car's coming.

328
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,477
Looks like him. Get ready.

329
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,529
Can I give you a lift?

330
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,396
where to? A hotel? Or home?

331
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,399
Home!

332
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:04,740
There's no one a t home tonight.
My wife's gone out too.

333
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:09,476
wha t's your name?
- Name?

334
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:11,979
wha t's in a name?

335
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:14,578
Everything, therefore I ask.

336
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,515
Rajiv Duggal.

337
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,386
Duggal?! C'mon !

338
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,793
Comfortable?
- Of course.

339
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,394
whiskey!

340
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:33,464
sorry!

341
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,941
You drink whisky, don't you?
- Of course.

342
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:39,345
N ice. Very nice!

343
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:47,348
''Mix wine with flowers, and then..''

344
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,446

00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,451
Consider this as your own home.

00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,920
who could it be so la te ay night?

348
00:31:58,332 --> 00:31:59,458
Could it be my wife?

349
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,932
she was supposed to return from
her folk's place tomorrow.

350
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,394
Inspector!

351
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:07,999
why did you take the photograph?

352
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:10,805
without evidence, the
courts acquit criminals.

353
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,403
Tha t's why, I prefer to get
my hands on the evidence.

354
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,948
And only then, do I
go for the criminal.

355
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,779
Criminal! wha t crime
have I committed?

356
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:18,943

00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,857
This is my first time, inspector!

361
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,596
I'm quite an honourable citizen.
I'm married too.

362
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,932
Married?
- Yes.

363
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:38,471
You're chea ting your wife too.

365
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,338

And wha t'll happen to my
kids for 4 years? - Kids?

367
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,605
shut up!

368
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,948
You've chea ted your kids too!

369

370
00:32:52,586 --> 00:32:57,387
And with multiple offences you'll
end up spending 50 years in prison.

371
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,982
50 years!

372
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,329
I'll have to be born
again to do tha t!

373
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:05,723
Can't you do something, inspector?

374
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,858
sure can be done.

375
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:11,870
will cost you 25,000.
- 25,000!

376
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:15,475
Feel it's too less?
- Too much !

377
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:19,469
I can't afford such money.
- You don't need to pay up.

378
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:23,406
The inspector can't do anything.
- Is tha t so?

379
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:24,542
Yes.

380
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,348
wha t he can do a t most is to
take you to the police sta tion..

381
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:27,547
..and bea t you up.

382
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,386
Then he might take you
to court and defame you.

383
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,323
And, he'd help you get a divorce.

384
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:33,851
He can do nothing more than tha t.

385
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,453
wha t else remains to be done?

386
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,464
Anything left?
- No!

387
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,401
I'll give. 25,000!

388
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:43,528
I'll get the money.

00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,731
wha t a fix I'm in !

390
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:51,875
Here you are, Inspector. 25,000.

391
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,608
My hard earned money, it's not.

392
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:57,480
C'mon, girlie!
- Coming.

393
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,677
Just a minute, Inspector.

394
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:01,578
Give me the spool.

395
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,458
There wasn't one to start with.

396
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,323
No spool in the camera !

397
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,387
Thank God ! I'm safe!

398
00:34:10,464 --> 00:34:12,591
No spool in the camera !

399
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,467
You !

400
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,003
wha t brings you here, you thief?

401
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,342
I've collected money for the dowry.

402
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,405
Came over to ask when
you're marrying me.

403
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:32,345
You lousy woman ! I won't marry..

404
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:35,378
..you even if you're the only
girl left on earth.

405
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:38,323
But, even if I were the
only girl left on earth..

406
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:40,519
..I'd marry only you !

407
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,462
Marry?
- Mr. Vinod !

408
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:43,923
who's getting married?

409
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,590
when is the marriage?

410
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,733
wha t model is this?
- You see..

411
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,669
I'm his fiancee.

412
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,731
Fiancee! Very nice.

413
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:59,337
Nowadays a woman and a television
is a must for every home.

414
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,006
when was the engine fitted?

415
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:04,880
No. well..
- Don't worry.

416
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:12,984
Nowadays, I'm taken up with
marriage and all rela ted words.

417
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,997
why? Because I'm getting married
next month, you see.

418
00:35:18,065 --> 00:35:19,862
with sharmilee.

419
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:25,862
sharmilee is a girl of many virtues!

420
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,464
But her uncle!

421
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,812
I haven't seen such
a good model ever.

422
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,677
wha t a simple man !

423
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:37,876

A man of God !

424
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:41,980
so you've met her uncle too!

425
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,991
Just met him this morning.

426
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,321
He took away the brides clothes..

427
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,453
..her ornaments, her expense money..

428
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,328
..as well as the tickets
for the honeymoon.

429
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,725
Make sure both of you
a ttend the marriage.

430
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm going to invite everyone.

431
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:00,936
The cards! I must go to the press.

432
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:10,574
You lousy woman ! Do you and your
uncle want to rip off my boss?

433
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:11,946
I swear this by you, Deva !

434
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,955
I've no idea when uncle
ha tched this plot. - Liar!

435
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,386
I swear upon you !

436
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,323
And you call me a liar!

437
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:22,521
A thousand times over! A liar!

438
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,802
If I wanted to, I could've
kissed your lips.

439
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,475
But this is a good enough
punishment for you.

440
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:38,936
Take care of your hands..

441
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:42,608
..because, wha tever they touch
I'd be kissing tha t thing !

442
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,780
wha t happened to your hands?
- Nothing.

443
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:50,915
Then why are you hiding them?

444
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,788
Let me see.
- Nothing.

445
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,522

446
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:57,723
Nothing a t all!

00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,856
stop acting.

448
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,924
Your hands are so cute.

449
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:07,465
why did she laugh?

450
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,805
Is anything on my face?

451
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,395
''I am 1 6.''

452
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:05,797
''Going on 17.''

453
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:08,933
''why won't the heart throb?''

454
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,333
''why won't the heart throb?''

455
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,800
''I am 1 6.''

456
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,934
'' 1 6.''

00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,471
'' 17.''

''why won't the heart throb?
My youth is under control.''

460
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,345
''My youth is under control.''

461
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:33,317
''Yet, it feels so incomplete.''

462
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,988
''Oh, my love.''

463
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,327

''N ight time, full of colour,

00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,668
''Oh, my love.''

467
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:53,338

''My body feels aroma tic.''

''wha t's this helplessness?''

493
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:41,677

''For your closeness.''

495

00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:55,723
''How do I live with it?''

''You're the river, and

498
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,459
''You tell me, how

Look here, mister!

00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,931
Leave me!

521
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:23,408
You'd spa t on me, right?

522
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,602
Today, I'd leave you in a sta te
tha t the world would spit on you.

523
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:17,379
Don't spare him! He's the one.

524
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,985
Run quickly.

525
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:56,782
You've bea ten me all the
way to this lock-up.

526
00:47:57,991 --> 00:47:59,049
Remember!

527
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:03,059
My dad will bea t you all
the way out of this city.

528
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:06,361
Do you know who my dad is?

529
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:07,991
Do you know?

530
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,059
Or do you have to ask your mom?

531
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:15,739
Face it!

532
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,339
Now you have to face it. I won't
answer this question of yours.

533
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,873
But my fa ther will
surely answer you.

534
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:32,722
Good afternoon sir!
- Good afternoon, sir!

535
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,051
Good afternoon sir!

536
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:41,062
My secretary, managers
and even lawyers here!

537
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:43,592
Has to be an emergency!

538
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:45,796
wha t's the ma tter?

539
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:48,373
sir, please control yourself.

540
00:48:48,742 --> 00:48:51,540
we know well tha t you
have only one weakness.

541
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:56,412
wha t's wrong with N iranjan?
- He's raped a girl.

542
00:48:58,351 --> 00:48:59,375
Is it?

543
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:01,850
so my son's grown up!

544
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:05,790
You're amazing !

545
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,324
You pulled me away from an
important business meeting..

546
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:11,057
..for such a small incident!

547
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:15,732
Have Rs.4,00,000 sent to
the girl as compensa tion.

548
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,064
she's dead !

549
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:22,375
N iranjan is behind bars, sir!

550
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:28,544
The officer who's booked N iranjan
is a strict fellow.

551
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:31,077
He's bea ten him up mercilessly too.

552
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:36,446
Uncle, Rajiv and Ismail are
behind bars with N iranjan too.

553
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:38,055
It's with grea t difficulty..
- Ran away?

554
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:43,454
Left my son to face
the music and fled?

555
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:47,526
It's a murder case, uncle. we
didn't kill her. N iranjan killed.

556
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,062
saxena !
- Yes, sir!

557
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:54,601
Take them away to a safe house.

558
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:57,342
They mustn't be available
for police interroga tion

559
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,877
till this ma tter settles down.

560
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,809
Go with him.
- Thank you, uncle!

561
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,044
Bhandari!
- Yes, sir!

562
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,046
There's a saying in English.

563
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:15,518
'lf your existence is my dea th,
better you die.'

564
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:22,392
If we die when they live,
it's better they die.

565
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:25,803
Inform Michael immedia tely.

566
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:45,347
I'm sorry, sir! I'll
not release him.

567
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:50,454
Get the thought of committing
suicide off your head, siddhant!

568
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:54,393
I like you hence I advise you.

569
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,730
This is my personal request.

570
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,664
while in uniform, I don't
care for requests, sir.

571
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:02,541
In tha t case, this is my order.

572
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:05,069
while in uniform, I don't
take wrong orders too.

573
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,809
In tha t case, I'll be forced
to have you transferred.

574
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:10,381
You can't do tha t too!

575
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,077
Tha t's because I resign !
- siddhant!

576
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:14,547
I don't want this job.

577
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,322
One tha t fails to
deliver justice to..

578
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,721
..the poor under
pressure from the rich.

579
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,721
Here's my resigna tion
letter. Take it.

580
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,529
''Reinsta te ACP siddhant.''

581
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,731
'Reinsta te ACP siddhant.'

582
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:35,468
'Reinsta te ACP siddhant.'

583
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,069
'Down with shobhraj.'

584
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,674
'Down with shobhraj.'

585
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:40,072
'Down with shobhraj.'

586
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:44,076
'Reinsta te ACP siddhant.'

587
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:47,045
Here. Read today's papers.

588
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:50,356
For the benefit of those who can't
even read, let me read it out.

589
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:52,591
'wha t kind of a government
rules the country?'

590
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:55,789
'where's justice lost during
this government's rule?'

591
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:59,524
'How much bribe has the Chief
Minister made on this case?'

592
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,330
Commissioner, the opposition
parties and the public..

593
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:04,529
..are demanding our resigna tion.

594
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:05,797
wha t reply am I to give them?

595
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:07,736
This has happened for the
first time, sir! - Yes!

596
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:10,066
The truth rears it's head !

597
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:11,805
It's for the first time ever..

598
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,403
..tha t people have taken to
the streets seeking justice.

599
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:18,482
Before this issue snowballs,
have tha t ACP called in.

600
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,349
You've been called in, sir.

601
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,048
You called for me, sir?

602
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:30,362
The police department needs honest
and upright officers like you !

603
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:32,860
Please rejoin tomorrow.

604
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,732
I respect your orders, sir!

605
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:39,595
But I've two
conditions you must meet.

606
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:41,797
Are you in your senses,
Mr. siddhant?

607
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,804
Do you know who you're talking
to? - Mr. Tripa thi!

608
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,872
wha t are your conditions?

609
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,743
I'd be posted to tha t same place,
the one I was a t.

610
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:54,351
And, tha t the accused involved
with the last case I handled..

611
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:58,050
..the one who's free now,
be put back in my lock-up.

612
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,517
Are you in your senses,
Commissioner?

613
00:53:02,462 --> 00:53:03,861
Do you realize wha t you're saying?

614
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:08,725
wha t's the ma tter, dad?

615
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:10,393
Nothing much, son.

616
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,064
Just tha t you have to come with me.

617
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:13,663
wha t?

618
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,943
I'm sorry, Mr. shobhraj.
I'm helpless!

619
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:19,807
It's the Chief Minister's orders.

620
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,604
Chief Minister?
- Yes!

621
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,774
Fine.

622
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,582
My son will accompany you.

623
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,586
But remember one thing.

624
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:34,388
He's already had supper.

625
00:53:35,361 --> 00:53:38,421
He must have breakfast
with me tomorrow morning.

626
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,600
But, dad?
- Don't worry.

627
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:43,660
I'm still around.

628
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:46,368
Go with him.

629
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:04,781
Those are the invita tion cards..

630
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:07,052
..you've sent me over
the past 20 years.

631
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:11,328
I've had them stored carefully.

632
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:17,335
Despite many invita tions,
I'd never come to your house..

633
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:22,363
..lest the people get the impression
tha t you favour my businesses.

634
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:24,603
But, I was forced to come today.

635
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:30,073
Because, you're the only person
who can help me today.

636
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:38,055
shobhraj, I've to admit tha t
you've helped me reach this sta tus!

637
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:42,452
wish I could have helped you !

638
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:46,329
Do you remember, Gautam? You
wanted to contest for the..

639
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:48,060
..presidential elections a t college.

640
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,359
You didn't have enough money
for printing posters.

641
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:55,871
I'd helped you then.

642
00:54:56,409 --> 00:55:00,368
I also ensured tha t
you'd be the president.

643
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:02,472
I remember everything.

644
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:06,551
5 years after tha t, you'd
come to see me a t home.

645
00:55:07,353 --> 00:55:09,753
Tha t was when your party had
chosen you for the post of M.L.A.

646
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:12,848
I'd helped you again.

647
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:17,355
You became the M.L.A., then the
M.P, then the Home Minister.

648
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:19,726
And today, you are
the Chief Minister.

649
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:24,061
But I never let this fact on to you..

650
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:28,532
..tha t your party didn't favour
you for your merits.

651
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,407
I'd bought them over for you.

652
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,070
For a million rupees.

653
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:37,782
I know. In fact, I came
to know of it la ter.

654
00:55:38,484 --> 00:55:40,952
I've always given, Gautam!

655
00:55:43,056 --> 00:55:44,785
I've never asked for
anything in return.

656
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:49,054
For the first time, I ask
for something from you.

657
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:52,588
Please give my son back to me!

658
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:56,058
He is my aim in life!

659
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,063
My wealth !

660
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:00,369
My everything !

661
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:04,543
wish I could repay you, shobhraj !

662
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,537
But, he's convicted of murder.

663
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:10,948
And you know well, the amount of
furore tha t the case has genera ted.

664
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:14,851
Opposition parties are waiting
to cash in on my slightest slip.

665
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:17,322
And, this officer who
has arrested your son..

666
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,381
..is an honest and principled man.

667
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,851
He can't be coerced by threa ts,
nor can he be bribed.

668
00:56:23,362 --> 00:56:24,420
He's not for sale.

669
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:27,056
Every person on earth
is up for sale, Gautam.

670
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,864
Every person has a price.

671
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:31,427
It's just a ma tter of
ma tching the price.

672
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:34,469
If you can't do anything
for me, so be it.

673
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:37,603
But you could a t least introduce
me to tha t police officer.

674
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:47,746
welcome, siddhant!

675
00:56:48,054 --> 00:56:49,749
sir!
- No formalities, please.

676
00:56:50,456 --> 00:56:52,856
I've called you over not
as a Chief Minister.

677
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:55,050
I've called you over
as a common man.

678
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:58,053
wha t can I do for you, sir?

679
00:56:58,731 --> 00:57:00,528
Meet Mr. shobhraj.

680
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,794
A friend from my college days.
He wants to speak to you.

681
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:10,340
If the two of you manage
to arrive a t a compromise..

682
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:12,070
..it would remain
between the two of you.

683
00:57:12,945 --> 00:57:14,003
I'm sitting here with you.

684
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,076
But please feel free
to ignore my presence.

685
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:20,083
Hello!
- Hello!

686
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:21,777
Please sit down.

687
00:57:24,056 --> 00:57:25,785
I won't take too much of your time.

688
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:28,520
Time is precious.

689
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:32,055
There's a saying in English.

690
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,357
Law is the slave of the rich.

691
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,461
The law is the slave of the rich.

692
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:42,737
I firmly believe in this proverb.

693
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,608
But I think, no one has ever been..

694
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,073
..so rich so as to own the law.

695
00:57:51,984 --> 00:57:54,043
I've no intention
of arguing with you.

696
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,582
All I want to tell
you is tha t the one..

697
00:57:57,857 --> 00:58:02,590
..you've arrested is my only son.

698
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,456
My only son !

699
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:07,065
I'm not to be faulted for tha t.

700
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,997
All you want for your case
is a criminal. Right?

701
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:19,340
I promise you tha t the 2 boys
whom you've arrested with my son..

702
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:24,372
..will accept in court tha t
they've murdered the girl.

703
00:58:24,884 --> 00:58:28,843
Mr. shobhraj ! - I haven't
finished speaking as yet.

704
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:32,452
The court will punish them.

705
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,358
And you'd stay a hero in
the eyes of the public.

706
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:39,463
I'll see to it tha t
you are promoted.

707
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:42,732
And, in return for the favour..

708
00:58:43,536 --> 00:58:46,733
..I'll gift you as much
gold as you weigh.

709
00:58:49,408 --> 00:58:53,538
Guess you've dealt with shops
till now, not with humans!

710
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,379
Mr. siddhant, consider
my proposition.

711
00:58:57,483 --> 00:58:58,745
You stand to benefit substantially.

712
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:01,353
I'll give you wha tever you want.

713
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:09,656
Bring back to life,
the girl who's died.

714
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:14,928
I promise you tha t your
son will be spared.

715
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:16,726
I'll drop all charges.

716
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:26,872
Take your hand away.

717
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:29,472
Away I say!

718
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:33,750
I don't like raising
my hand on elders.

719
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,053
who do you think you are?

720
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:46,354
Is law your property, or your slave..

721
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:48,366
..tha t'll dance to your tunes?

722
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:52,337
Or do you consider law a game of..

723
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:54,737
..cards tha t you
can play as you wish?

724
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,736
Listen carefully.

725
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,078
Your son is a beast.

726
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:07,045
And the law will surely punish
him for his heinous crime.

727
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,046
I'll see to it.

728
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:14,791
sorry. The tape is over.

729
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:20,387
sir, you're a decent and honest man.

730
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:22,462
Tha t's why I return
this cassette to you.

731
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:28,738
But please tell your friend tha t
he shouldn't try to buy me again.

732
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:31,067
Or I'll give the other
cassette to the press.

733
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:37,341
I know how a dad feels when..

734
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,046
..one's only young
son is behind bars!

735
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:45,847
I sympa thize with you ! But
I don't feel sorry for you !

736
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:51,055
siddhant!

737
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,925
Listen before you leave.

738
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,998
I'm a person who has only friends!

739
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:01,732
Lots of friends!

740
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:03,737
No enemies!

741
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:06,411
Don't be my sole enemy!

742
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:14,349
The profession tha t I'm in,
I've only enemies, no friends!

743
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:16,851
One more adds to the list today.

744
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:07,918
Dad !

745
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,652
Dad !

746
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:25,067
Don't worry, mom!

747
01:04:25,344 --> 01:04:26,811
Doctor's said everything
will be alright.

748
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:36,043
Deva, my son ! - Mom, you know I
can see a lot of blood and gore.

749
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,514
But I can't bear to
see you cry, mom!

750
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:43,858
sir, the bill.
- Yes!

751
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:47,390
why do you have so many of Madhuri's
posters in your restaurant?

752
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,397
Our sir is a very huge fan of hers.

753
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,062
Fan ! I'll turn this fan now.

754
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,732
Uncle!

755
01:05:00,412 --> 01:05:01,811
wha t are you doing here, sharmilee?

756
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:04,073
I've come here as Madhuri's
younger sister.

757
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:08,047
He's my victim. Find someone else.

758
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:11,515
will you help me in bluffing him?

759
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,648
Come on !

760
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:16,527
Can we make a call?
- sure.

761
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:19,922
I hope sister hasn't
left for the shoot.

762
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,057
Tha t's wha t I'm checking.

763
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:22,459

764
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,060
Hello!

771
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:39,742
Hello, sis!

772
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,720
No, I didn't go to college.
I went to see your new film.

773
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:46,051
Yes, I liked it a lot!

774
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,356
sister, I'm coming to your
shoot. Okay, bye!

775
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:56,061
Ma'am, which Madhuri were
you talking to? - Talk to me.

776
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:57,866
wha t's happening in this country?

777
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,731
You've so many posters around..

778
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:01,796
..and you ask which Madhuri!

779
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:03,804
she was talking to this Madhuri.

780
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,468
Her?

781
01:06:06,078 --> 01:06:07,375
Do you know her?

782
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,538
she's my child.
- Your child?

783
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,580
I mean I've brought
her to this position.

784
01:06:12,685 --> 01:06:13,947
Tha t's our film lingo!

785
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,386
I'm her secretary.
- secretary!

786
01:06:17,523 --> 01:06:18,785
she's her younger sister.

787
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:27,397
I guessed it on seeing you tha t
you had to be her younger sister.

788
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:33,872
Ms. sharmilee, I want to offer
your sister a cup of tea.

789
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:38,871
Forget tea, I'll bring sis here
some day. Give her lunch then.

790
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,939
Really?
- Listen.

791
01:06:41,013 --> 01:06:42,605
Yes!
- How much is your bill?

792
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,073
why embarrass me?

793
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:46,749
will I accept cash from you?

794
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:48,579
well, it's not just tha t much.

795
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:50,717
He wants to get some
things packed too.

796
01:06:50,856 --> 01:06:53,723
sure. This is your own hotel.

797
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:55,720
Peter!
- Yes, sir!

798
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:58,056
see to wha t he wants.
- Yes!

799
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,055
I want a lot of things!

800
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,059
Deva !

801
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:05,929
Hey Deva ! stop!

802
01:07:07,072 --> 01:07:09,734
Congra tula tions! You
must ea t a sweet.

803
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,672
why? Have you produced
another child?

804
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:12,870
Not me.

805
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:14,807
You're the one who's going
to sire a child next year.

806
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,608
This is to celebra te
your engagement.

807
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:19,077
You got engaged to
sharmilee on the sly.

808
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:20,545
Didn't even tell me!

809
01:07:22,388 --> 01:07:23,446
with sharmilee?

810
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:25,587
who told you tha t?
- sharmilee told me.

811
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:28,390
she took the engagement
ring from my shop.

812
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,061
Told me to collect the cash
from her future spouse, Deva.

813
01:07:32,398 --> 01:07:33,922
Take this. The bill for 5,000.

814
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,464
Oh, sharmilee! wha t have you done!

815
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:43,007
Lock the door from out,
and sit here!

816
01:07:43,075 --> 01:07:45,339
And I was waiting..

817
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:49,939
..all ready to get married.

818
01:07:50,082 --> 01:07:54,576
You've made a laughing stock
of me amidst your rela tives!

819
01:07:54,753 --> 01:07:57,051
You ridiculed me!
- well, brother Vinod

820
01:07:57,322 --> 01:08:00,052
Not brother, just Vinod !

821
01:08:00,392 --> 01:08:06,058
I've finally realized tha t you
chea t people out of money.

822
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:11,665
Take a look. I've gifted you
my house and the garage.

823
01:08:12,805 --> 01:08:14,864
At least now, you'll
marry me, won't you?

824
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:20,067
I can never marry you, Vinod.

825
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,079
I'm in love with Deva.

826
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,480
Deva? But he's a mechanic
in my garage!

827
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:29,350
You must be wondering why a
small-time penny-pincher like me..

828
01:08:29,388 --> 01:08:31,913
..refuses to marry a
millionaire like you.

829
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:35,058
Tha t's love!

830
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:39,063
No ma tter if others don't
understand, you definitely would !

831
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,594
But Deva doesn't love you !

832
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:44,460
But I still love him!

833
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:46,462
I've loved him since I was a child !

834
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,737
I can't say how much I love him!

835
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:54,342
But, when as a child he used to
sit on the steps of the courthouse..

836
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:58,076
..and weep his heart out, I felt
this urge to weep with him.

837
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:01,748
I grew up dreaming of him.

838
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:07,451
Till I live, I'll try make
the dreams come true.

839
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,055
And some time, he'll certainly
say 'sharmilee, I love you !'

840
01:09:12,598 --> 01:09:17,535
The engine in your heart is quite
different from your model.

841
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,062
Deva be cursed for not realizing
how much you love him!

842
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:27,075
when love goes unrequited,
the heart is tormented !

843
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:31,073
I've hurt you ! Please
forgive me, Vinod !

844
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:34,976
Just Vinod? won't you
call me brother Vinod !

845
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,046
It was my folly.

846
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:43,459
A beautiful kid like you could
only be my kid sister!

847
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,865
see you la ter.

848
01:10:03,482 --> 01:10:05,950
sharmilee! I love you !

849
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:29,602
''when my passions are fulfilled.''

850
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:34,411
''when my passions are fulfilled.''

851
01:10:34,546 --> 01:10:39,074
''I sort of go mad.''

852
01:10:39,384 --> 01:10:47,723
''For the first time ever, I
feel excitement in my heart.''

853
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:52,727
''Excitement in my heart.''

854
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:57,929
''Coming into these arms of yours.''

855
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:02,740
''Coming into these arms of yours.''

856
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:07,069
''You look like a bride.''

857
01:11:07,879 --> 01:11:15,843
''For the first time ever, I
feel excitement in my heart.''

858
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:21,048
''I feel the excitement in my heart.''

859
01:11:31,403 --> 01:11:35,737
''The world was as
beautiful a day ago.''

860
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:40,477
''The seasons as bright as they are.''

861
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:45,383
''The moon adorned
the sky a day ago.''

862
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:49,384
''The moon and the stars had
brightened the sky too.''

863
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:54,321
''why then do I find today..

864
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:58,796
..a new beauty in all tha t I see!''

865
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:03,364
''Come closer, my love.''

866
01:12:03,935 --> 01:12:07,735
''so I can see you till
my heart's content.''

867
01:12:08,473 --> 01:12:12,739
''The look in your eyes.''

868
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:17,071
''The look in your eyes.''

869
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:21,842
''Has sort of left me wounded.''

870
01:12:22,387 --> 01:12:30,453
''For the first time ever, I
feel excitement in my heart.''

871
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:35,858
''I feel the excitement in my heart.''

872
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,076
''I've told you all tha t
lies in my heart.''

873
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:57,446
''I've not kept you unawares
about anything.''

874
01:12:58,056 --> 01:13:06,589
''But you haven't told me yet
how long you'll be with me.''

875
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:11,597
''we shall stay together.''

876
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:16,063
''we shall never part.''

877
01:13:16,374 --> 01:13:20,743
''More than my life..

878
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:25,076
..is wha t I find your love to be..''

879
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:30,044
''Life without you.''

880
01:13:30,388 --> 01:13:34,518
''Life without you.''

881
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:38,861
''will be hard to live.''

882
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:47,394
''For the first time ever, I
feel excitement in my heart.''

883
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,535
''I feel excitement in my heart.''

884
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:58,072
''Coming into these arms of yours.''

885
01:13:58,383 --> 01:14:02,752
''Coming into these arms of yours.''

886
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:06,849
''You look like a bride.''

887
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:15,789
''For the first time ever, I
feel excitement in my heart.''

888
01:14:17,068 --> 01:14:21,368
''Excitement in my heart.''

889
01:14:51,002 --> 01:14:52,060
Uncle!

890
01:14:52,938 --> 01:14:53,996
Uncle!
- sharmilee!

891
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:55,734
My child !

892
01:14:57,008 --> 01:14:59,340
I'm very happy today!
- And I'm very happy too!

893
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,469
Do you know why I'm happy?

894
01:15:00,545 --> 01:15:03,070
Till now, we used to
chea t for a living.

895
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:06,475
From now on, we'll chea t people
for a better livelihood.

896
01:15:07,652 --> 01:15:09,347
Keep chea ting, if
you want to, uncle!

897
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:10,712
I'm going straight from now on.

898
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,648
straight?

899
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:14,049
wha tever's happening
to this country?

900
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:15,384
Feeling ill?

901
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,051
Uncle!
- sit down.

902
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:20,061
I'm perfectly alright. It's just
tha t I'm going straight now on.

903
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:24,797
why do you irrita te me?
- I'm getting married to Deva.

904
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,731
Deva?
- Yes.

905
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,373
You're going into A.C.P siddhant's
family! As his daughter-in-law!

906
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:35,075
Yes, uncle!
- And I'll be rela ted to him!

907
01:15:35,947 --> 01:15:39,075
with him for a rela tion,
my creditors beware!

908
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:42,384
why must you do all the household
work with two grown up sons?

909
01:15:43,054 --> 01:15:44,715
why don't you get Karan married?

910
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:46,721
The daughter-in-law can
help you with the chores.

911
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:50,058
If you care so much about your mom,
why don't you get married?

912
01:15:50,528 --> 01:15:55,056
I haven't given it a thought.
But, if you insist..

913
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,062
Very well. I've thought of
a very nice girl for you.

914
01:15:58,336 --> 01:15:59,394
Girl?
- Yes!

915
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:04,064
which girl? - Brijmohan's
daughter. From Lucknow.

916
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:05,734
Tha t's too far out of place.

917
01:16:05,877 --> 01:16:09,074
why don't you think
of some place closer?

918
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:12,579
Close-by? It'd be Dr.
Ma thur's daughter.

919
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:15,050
They're just 1 0 minutes
away from here.

920
01:16:15,453 --> 01:16:19,048
If you've come tha t close,
why not try someone nearer?

921
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:22,392
where to? - A good girl stays
in the slums behind our house.

922
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:23,923
who are you speaking of? sharmilee?

923
01:16:25,063 --> 01:16:30,865
Yes, mom! - I knew tha t little
thief would get my son some day.

924
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:37,064
will you please tell dad?
- All in good time.

925
01:16:42,948 --> 01:16:44,074
ACP siddhant here!

926
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:46,782
Uncle, I'm Karan's friend.

927
01:16:46,885 --> 01:16:48,785
I'm calling from 3-star club.
Please come immedia tely.

928
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:55,051
Get up. wha t did I tell you?

929
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,054
wha t did I tell you?

930
01:16:57,996 --> 01:16:59,054
You won't go to my house!

931
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:01,365
You won't meet my dad ! Understand?

932
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:03,933
I shall go there! I certainly will!

933
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,462
If I have the courage
to be an unwed mom

934
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:09,400
I have the courage to seek the
rights for the unborn child.

935
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,599
I know!

936
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:14,477
I know how courageous
fast ones like you are.

937
01:17:15,613 --> 01:17:19,879
Tell me, are you sure tha t
the bundle you carry is mine?

938
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:21,744
Idiot!

939
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:36,059
Amrita ! wha t are you doing?

940
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:37,859
Leave me!

941
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:49,471
Amrita !

942
01:18:06,364 --> 01:18:08,525
No, Karan ! stop!

943
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:09,928
Don't run ! Karan !

944
01:18:10,068 --> 01:18:11,365
Karan !

945
01:18:12,871 --> 01:18:13,929
Karan !

946
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:15,397
stop Karan ! No!

947
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:25,942
''May all be virtuous,
may there be no sinners!''

948
01:18:26,584 --> 01:18:34,719
''In this world of ha te, may there
be love in all the hearts!''

949
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:43,058
''In this world of ha te, may there
be love in all the hearts!''

950
01:18:43,868 --> 01:18:47,736
''Love in all the hearts!''

951
01:18:52,077 --> 01:18:56,411
''From this earth, O' lord !''

952
01:18:56,614 --> 01:19:00,641
''Get this earth rid of sins!''

953
01:19:00,752 --> 01:19:01,776
Mom!

954
01:19:04,923 --> 01:19:06,049
Mom!

955
01:19:12,397 --> 01:19:13,455
Mom!

956
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:19,359
save me, mom!
- wha t happened?

957
01:19:20,405 --> 01:19:21,599
wha t happened, my child?

958
01:19:22,073 --> 01:19:24,598
wha t have you done?
- I'm guilty of everything.

959
01:19:24,742 --> 01:19:27,074
I've stolen money. I've taken
to alcohol. I've gambled.

960
01:19:27,378 --> 01:19:29,869
But, I haven't committed
this murder!

961
01:19:36,387 --> 01:19:38,355
wha t are you saying?
Are you in your senses?

962
01:19:38,656 --> 01:19:40,521
Do you realize wha t you're saying !
- It's the truth, mom.

963
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:44,725
I swear by you ! I didn't commit
this murder. I haven't!

964
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:47,361
Please save me! He's
coming to arrest me!

965
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:48,857
who?

966
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:53,061
Mom!

967
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:11,446
Arrest him!

968
01:20:11,523 --> 01:20:14,583
No! I won't let you arrest him!

969
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:16,053
He's innocent!

970
01:20:16,594 --> 01:20:20,928
How can you ever think
our son could kill?

971
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,526
I'm not thinking ! I know it!

972
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:26,063
No! You must be mistaken !

973
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,736
Look! Take a look a t him!

974
01:20:29,073 --> 01:20:32,474
Are murderers like this? Does
he look like a murderer?

975
01:20:33,011 --> 01:20:35,070
No! My son isn't guilty.

976
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,472
Please believe me, dad !

977
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,376
I haven't done anything !
I'm innocent!

978
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:42,052
Tha t's just wha t every criminal
says after committing a crime.

979
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:45,447
Mom, tell him.

980
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,789
No!
- Pushpa !

981
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,585
I won't let you take my son away!
- Move aside, Pushpa.

982
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:54,061
You can't take my son away from me.

983
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:55,390
Please let go of him, Pushpa.

984
01:20:55,733 --> 01:20:57,064
wha t are you staring? Take him away.

985
01:20:57,368 --> 01:21:01,065
No.
- Go on.

986
01:21:01,806 --> 01:21:04,070
Take him away.
- Don't take him.

987
01:21:04,409 --> 01:21:05,467
Let go of me!

988
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:09,078
Pushpa ! Listen to me, Pushpa !

989
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,074
Leave him.

990
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:13,378
No!

991
01:21:14,652 --> 01:21:16,586
Mom!

992
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:22,659
Karan
- Mom.

993
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,054
Mother!

994
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:25,523
Mom.

995
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:27,056
My son !

996
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:28,456
Mother.

997
01:21:30,602 --> 01:21:31,728
stop!

998
01:21:37,342 --> 01:21:39,742
Enough of these drama tics.
stop this game.

999
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:42,674
No one's going to
take my brother away.

1000
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,341
Don't interfere with the law, Deva.

1001
01:21:47,385 --> 01:21:51,412
I don't care for your law,
one tha t breaks up families..

1002
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:52,847
..but cannot make them.

1003
01:21:52,924 --> 01:21:54,983
Thousands of innocents have
been punished by law.

1004
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,325
And thousands of times,
the law has erred.

1005
01:21:57,595 --> 01:22:01,531
Tha t's because the law lies safely
beyond the reach of punishment.

1006
01:22:01,633 --> 01:22:04,329
How are you convinced
of his innocence?

1007
01:22:04,402 --> 01:22:07,838
Because every time he has erred,
my mom has complained of it.

1008
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:10,739
And today, my mom insists
tha t her son is innocent.

1009
01:22:11,075 --> 01:22:13,339
Tha t's why, my heart tells
me tha t he is innocent.

1010
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,570
Besides he can't tell a lie
when he swears on his mom.

1011
01:22:17,348 --> 01:22:20,340
The law heeds not to words from
the heart. It asks for evidence.

1012
01:22:21,152 --> 01:22:23,450
And I am an eye-witness to
the crime he's committed.

1013
01:22:26,624 --> 01:22:31,755
Forget not, tha t I come here, not
as a dad, but as a police officer.

1014
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:35,322
No!

1015
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,960
Come on. -
Fa ther no! Mom! - Let him go!

1016
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:41,004
Leave me! Let go!

1017
01:22:41,339 --> 01:22:44,775
Please save my son !
- I'm innocent, mom!

1018
01:22:44,842 --> 01:22:48,005
Mom!

1019
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,071
A.C.P siddhant!

1020
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:54,346
save me, mom! I haven't
done anything.

1021
01:22:56,487 --> 01:23:01,891
15 years ago, you and your law
had torn a child away from his mom.

1022
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:03,685
You'd killed her.

1023
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:05,726
Now, 15 years la ter..

1024
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,429
..your law wants to separa te another
son away from a mom!

1025
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:12,394
No!

1026
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,337
I won't let the story be repea ted.

1027
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:20,074
I won't let a mom die!

1028
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:23,007
Nor will I let her son be hanged !

1029
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:25,782
I promise you this!

1030
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:35,017
Mr. siddhant your wife
has had a heart a ttack.

1031
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:40,320
I must inform you tha t she won't
be able to bear another shock.

1032
01:23:45,903 --> 01:23:48,565
Mom, have the medicine.

1033
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:54,535
Deva, I want my son, not medicine!

1034
01:23:56,914 --> 01:24:01,476
I won't have the medicine till
my son doesn't return home.

1035
01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:07,314
Mom, he'll come back soon.

1036
01:24:08,426 --> 01:24:13,329
But you know, he'll be so upset
if he sees you in this sta te.

1037
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:19,465
He'll ask me why I didn't take
care of his ill mom in his absence.

1038
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,503
wha t will I reply?

1039
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,338
Then, even if he grabs
me by my cuff,

1040
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:26,934
I won't be able to shirk him off.

1041
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:31,340
Come on, have the medicine.

1042
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:40,849
Pushpa !

1043
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:46,490
Deva, tell him I don't
want to talk to him.

1044
01:24:48,132 --> 01:24:49,827
I don't want to talk to him!

1045
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:08,844
saw the result of bad company.

1046
01:25:11,088 --> 01:25:13,818
where have you landed yourself?
- You must be very happy!

1047
01:25:14,992 --> 01:25:17,392
The main obstacle to your
plans is no more in the fray.

1048
01:25:18,563 --> 01:25:20,929
Mom said tha t some day, Karan
will surely understand you.

1049
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,327
But today, I realize tha t..

1050
01:25:24,402 --> 01:25:27,337
..you can never bear any
goodwill towards me.

1051
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:31,898
I'm not here to enjoy myself,
or to laugh a t you.

1052
01:25:32,343 --> 01:25:34,573
I'm here to help you !
- Help?

1053
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:40,446
Have you brought a rope to hang me?

1054
01:25:42,553 --> 01:25:44,783
Listen ! Listen carefully.

1055
01:25:45,389 --> 01:25:48,483
Ever since I was a child, you've
trauma tized my existence.

1056
01:25:48,993 --> 01:25:51,518
You've always tried to insult me.

1057
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:56,332
If anyone asks me, who my worst
enemy is, the answer would be you !

1058
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,731
should anyone ask me..

1059
01:25:57,802 --> 01:25:59,326
..who I ha te the most, my
answer would be you !

1060
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:03,834
But my ha te cannot ma tch
my mom's love for you.

1061
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:06,808
And for the sake of her love..

1062
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:09,843
..I've chosen to forget
my ha tred for you.

1063
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:14,978
It's up to you, to
consider me an enemy.

1064
01:26:16,053 --> 01:26:17,577
But, I'll definitely save you.

1065
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:20,313
Even if it means tha t I've
to put my life a t stake.

1066
01:26:21,025 --> 01:26:22,322
Just so tha t my mom may live!

1067
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:27,592
I'll fight anyone in this world
to get you out of prison, Karan.

1068
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,060
But I can't fight you !

1069
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:37,974
If you don't help me out,
I'll lose this ba ttle.

1070
01:26:39,343 --> 01:26:40,401
I'll lose, brother!

1071
01:26:42,013 --> 01:26:43,071
Brother!

1072
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:50,044
wha t did you say?
- Brother!

1073
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:55,318
Embrace this nave brother,
and forgive me, my brother!

1074
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:21,675
Idiot! Can't you wa tch your step?

1075
01:27:22,453 --> 01:27:24,318
I could ask you the same question.

1076
01:27:24,455 --> 01:27:26,548
Don't you know how
to address elders?

1077
01:27:26,857 --> 01:27:31,385
I address ill-mannered
elders in this manner.

1078
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,695
Bow your head when you speak to me.

1079
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:36,826
You're no more than a fleck
of dust off my shoes.

1080
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:38,698
Even the dust doesn't
care for empty pride.

1081
01:27:39,437 --> 01:27:41,564
Kick a t dust, and it'll rise
to fall on your own head.

1082
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,767
It isn't good for you
to be so warm-blooded.

1083
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:49,337
You should first know who the
adversary is before you cross swords.

1084
01:27:50,047 --> 01:27:53,346
Thank your stars tha t
we collide accidentally.

1085
01:27:54,452 --> 01:27:56,943
Pray tha t you never cross
swords with me willingly.

1086
01:27:57,388 --> 01:27:59,322
Else, the acquaintance
may prove costly.

1087
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:08,823
Rajiv! Its uncle!

1088
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:13,867
Hello, uncle!
- Hello! - N iranjan !

1089
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:14,996
Your dad's here!

1090
01:28:16,574 --> 01:28:17,632
Hi dad !

1091
01:28:18,776 --> 01:28:19,834
N iranjan !

1092
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:22,737
How are you, my son?

1093
01:28:22,913 --> 01:28:25,438
Dad, wha t could I ask
for with you around?

1094
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:26,777
Just one problem, uncle.

1095
01:28:27,852 --> 01:28:31,310
If we go on staying in here and
ea t like this, we'll grow fa t!

1096
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:32,447
Don't worry boys.

1097
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:34,684
You'll be released very soon.

1098
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:35,950
I know, dad !

1099
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:37,817
I've full confidence in you.

1100
01:28:38,129 --> 01:28:40,563
My dad does exactly
wha t he promises.

1101
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:43,326
Of course! You're right, my son !

1102
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:47,332
Every word your dad says
is etched in stone.

1103
01:28:48,539 --> 01:28:50,666
I promise. You won't get hurt!

1104
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,475
There's a saying in English.

1105
01:28:54,345 --> 01:28:55,778
some times days are long.

1106
01:28:56,614 --> 01:28:57,672
sometimes, nights.

1107
01:29:00,384 --> 01:29:03,353
sharmilee, look wha t I've brought.

1108
01:29:03,454 --> 01:29:05,388
Look wha t's happening
in this country.

1109
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,781
This is the condition before
becoming siddhant's rela tive.

1110
01:29:07,858 --> 01:29:11,316
wha t would it be like la ter?
I'll roll in money!

1111
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,762
wha t happened? Are you sad?

1112
01:29:15,966 --> 01:29:18,025
Uncle, I don't think I'll
be able to get married now.

1113
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:21,734
Don't say tha t. I'll get an a ttack.

1114
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,773
Deva's brother Karan
is charged for murder.

1115
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:27,604
He could be hanged.

1116
01:29:27,845 --> 01:29:29,710
Murder! Very good !

1117
01:29:30,081 --> 01:29:31,343
Tha t's grea t!

1118
01:29:31,582 --> 01:29:34,551
If Karan is hanged, Deva will be
the sole heir to the property.

1119
01:29:34,652 --> 01:29:38,315
we'll revel then. we'll be rich !

1120
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:41,889
Uncle, I'm talking about
the dea th sentence.

1121
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:43,320
About dea th !

1122
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:45,927
Can a marriage take place in a
house where a dea th has occurred?

1123
01:29:47,531 --> 01:29:48,589
No.

1124
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,525
But I've sold this alliance.

1125
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:56,433
If this marriage doesn't happen,
I'll be thrashed.

1126
01:29:56,507 --> 01:30:00,967
Hit. - I'll bash you up!

1127
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:05,338
He claimed the A.C.P to be his
rela tive and took Rs.40,000 from me.

1128
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,981
He took Rs.20000 from me too.

1129
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,347
Tell me, when will
you repay all of us?

1130
01:30:10,421 --> 01:30:15,051
I will. But you all bea t me.
so give a little discount.

1131
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:17,686
we'll give you a bonus too.

1132
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:22,322
Trapped me in a rape case
involving an old hag !

1133
01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,826
Hit him!

1134
01:30:25,936 --> 01:30:27,699
wha t happened, uncle?

1135
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:29,397
wha t happened?

1136
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:31,341
Uncle, wha t happened?

1137
01:30:31,408 --> 01:30:37,347
I was thinking ! It's important
for this marriage to take place.

1138
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:38,772
Because, if it doesn't, you'll..

1139
01:30:38,883 --> 01:30:40,942
..remain a spinster
all your life. - why?

1140
01:30:41,886 --> 01:30:45,583
You think. If anything happens
to Karan, will he die alone?

1141
01:30:46,056 --> 01:30:48,889
Even his mom will die
of shock. Two dea ths!

1142
01:30:49,627 --> 01:30:53,324
The house where two dea ths
occur before you enter..

1143
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:56,332
..will they make you their
daughter-in-law?

1144
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,459
No one will marry you.

1145
01:30:59,336 --> 01:31:05,400
so, we both will have
to help Deva save Karan.

1146
01:31:06,343 --> 01:31:08,402
I need your help too, sharmilee!

1147
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:12,338
I've found out tha t Karan's friend,
Bablu, one I'm looking for..

1148
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:13,748
..is hiding a t the 3-star club.

1149
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:19,318
The way cheese needs to be dangled
to get a ra t out of it's place..

1150
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:23,952
..I guess we need to do something
same to get him out too.

01:35:59,403 --> 01:36:01,667
''Guess something good's
come out of this tryst.''

1196
01:36:01,738 --> 01:36:04,070
''This place is quite unique.
Different from anything else.''

1197
01:36:04,141 --> 01:36:06,575
''The intoxica tion of love
is quiet different.''

1198
01:36:06,643 --> 01:36:08,941
''Looks like the two
of us will be a hit.''

1199
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:11,537
''And once we're a hit, we'd
be a perfect ma tch.''

1200
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:21,053
''If anyone else hears, our
marriage would be doomed.''

1201
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:23,491
''I think we will be together.''

1202
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:26,051
''If the talks proceed,
we will be paired up.''

1203
01:36:28,398 --> 01:36:30,832
''Your eyes are swimming, you're
barely in your senses.''

1204
01:36:30,901 --> 01:36:33,335
''Everyone I look a t,
seems intoxica ted.''

1205
01:36:33,403 --> 01:36:35,735
''Hold me in your arms,
lest I fall down.''

1206
01:36:35,806 --> 01:36:38,070
''My eyes are open. But I'm
blinded by a craze.''

1207
01:36:38,142 --> 01:36:40,576
''we want girls, beautiful,
beautiful.''

1208
01:36:40,644 --> 01:36:43,078
''Charming, tip-top, beautiful,
dutiful.''

1209
01:36:43,147 --> 01:36:45,377
''we want girls, beautiful,
beautiful.''

1210
01:36:45,482 --> 01:36:47,780
''Charming, tip-top, beautiful,
dutiful.''

1211
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:55,053
''A Julie, a Noorie, a Bobby..

1212
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:59,323
..even our neighborhood
Meena will do.''

1213
01:37:02,432 --> 01:37:05,060
''The season of the rains.''

1214
01:37:05,135 --> 01:37:09,629
''A tough life for the
unmarried ones.''

1215
01:37:09,706 --> 01:37:12,334
''we want boys, handsome, handsome.''

1216
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:14,673
''Dashing, He-man, superman,
Phantom.''

1217
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:17,043
''we want boys, handsome, handsome.''

1218
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,071
''Dashing, He-man, superman,
Phantom.''

1219
01:37:19,149 --> 01:37:26,715
''A Rocky, a Hero,
a Chhalia or even..

1220
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:30,351
..even our neighborhood
Bheema will do.''

1221
01:37:33,664 --> 01:37:35,996
''The season of the rains.''

1222
01:37:36,066 --> 01:37:40,332
''A tough life for the
unmarried ones.''

1223
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,602
''The season of the rains.''

1224
01:37:45,676 --> 01:37:49,339
''A tough life for the
unmarried ones.''

1225
01:37:50,581 --> 01:37:52,879
''The season of the rains.''

1226
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,477
''A tough life for the
unmarried ones.''

1227
01:38:15,005 --> 01:38:16,063
Don't worry

1228
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:20,337
Tha t was my uncle. shut the door
so tha t no one can disturb us.

1229
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:26,445
You !
- why have I been brought here?

1230
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,748
wha t do you know about
Amrita's murder?

1231
01:38:30,621 --> 01:38:31,713
wha t do I know?

1232
01:38:32,022 --> 01:38:33,785
Just as much as you !

1233
01:38:34,458 --> 01:38:35,516
The police knows all about it.

1234
01:38:35,592 --> 01:38:39,028
The whole world knows tha t
Karan murdered her.

1235
01:38:40,597 --> 01:38:41,928
Has Karan murdered her?
- Yes!

1236
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:54,340
Fool, how did you know tha t a
murder was about to take place?

1237
01:38:56,346 --> 01:38:57,370
wha t do you mean?

1238
01:38:57,481 --> 01:38:59,540
You phoned the police before
the murder, right?

1239
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:06,312
Tha t's because they
had a serious fight.

1240
01:39:06,623 --> 01:39:08,318
Then why didn't you
try to stop them?

1241
01:39:08,392 --> 01:39:09,586
You were Karan's friend, right?

1242
01:39:09,926 --> 01:39:12,793
well, I..
- Tell!

1243
01:39:21,972 --> 01:39:25,806
Tell me why you called the police.

1244
01:39:26,343 --> 01:39:28,072
I'll tell you !

1245
01:39:28,912 --> 01:39:29,970
Go on !

1246
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,072
I know nothing about the murder.

1247
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:34,982
Rocky told me to call the cops.

1248
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:37,315
who Rocky?

1249
01:39:37,421 --> 01:39:38,979
He owns this club.

1250
01:39:39,956 --> 01:39:41,014
where can I find him?

1251
01:39:41,358 --> 01:39:43,417
I've not seen him since the murder.

1252
01:39:53,337 --> 01:39:54,395
Yes?

1253
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,571
where's Rocky?
- Are you his friend?

1254
01:39:59,343 --> 01:40:01,038
Or, has he had a scrap with you too?

1255
01:40:02,346 --> 01:40:04,075
No, I'm his friend.

1256
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:06,478
why don't you ask him to see reason?

1257
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,445
why is he involved with
everything illegal?

1258
01:40:08,552 --> 01:40:10,315
why must he stay in hiding?

1259
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,316
His problems made me lose my leg.

1260
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:14,319
will he take my life now?

1261
01:40:15,792 --> 01:40:18,590
If you see him, tell him tha t
mom is serious in hospital.

1262
01:40:19,062 --> 01:40:21,895
Tell him to come meet
her for the last time.

1263
01:40:34,378 --> 01:40:36,539
Rocky! Karan's brother had come
here looking for you.

1264
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,448
You stay underground.
- Don't worry.

1265
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:43,351
Not him! There's none on
earth who could find me.

1266
01:40:52,329 --> 01:40:55,321
You're still awake, Pushpa !

1267
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,329
The doctor has advised you rest.

1268
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:00,802
was waiting for you.

1269
01:41:02,339 --> 01:41:04,807
On this day, you used to return
home before nightfall.

1270
01:41:06,343 --> 01:41:09,676
For the first time ever, you've
made me wait so long.

1271
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:15,648
Have you forgotten? It's our
wedding anniversary today.

1272
01:41:17,554 --> 01:41:18,612
You're right, Pushpa.

1273
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:22,848
Truth is, for the first
time ever, I'd forgotten.

1274
01:41:25,128 --> 01:41:29,326
Not only this day. You've
forgotten much.

1275
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:33,333
Do remember, you'd vowed in marriage

1276
01:41:33,403 --> 01:41:39,933
tha t you'd stand by me in
sorrow and in happiness.

1277
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:47,350
when you took my hand in marriage,
you promised

1278
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:50,547
tha t you'd never let me
weep tears of sorrow.

1279
01:41:51,988 --> 01:41:53,649
Are you fulfilling your promise?

1280
01:41:56,126 --> 01:41:59,687
when I gave you little Karan
for the first time..

1281
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:05,460
..you'd said tha t I'd given you
all the happiness in the world.

1282
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:12,339
And today, you've thrown tha t
same happiness in prison !

1283
01:42:13,076 --> 01:42:16,341
Today, I want to know whether
your bondage to the law..

1284
01:42:16,413 --> 01:42:20,782
..is stronger than your ties with
your wife and your child?

1285
01:42:23,353 --> 01:42:26,379
After living so many
years with you..

1286
01:42:26,456 --> 01:42:28,720
..I've come to know
for the first time..

1287
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:32,785
..tha t you're only a police officer.

1288
01:42:32,996 --> 01:42:34,793
A very good police officer indeed !

1289
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:37,397
But, you're not a good dad !

1290
01:42:37,868 --> 01:42:39,460
You've failed as a dad !

1291
01:43:01,992 --> 01:43:04,324
'I, siddhant shekhawa t,
hereby pledge..

1292
01:43:04,394 --> 01:43:07,386
..tha t I'll be loyal towards the
constitution of my country.'

1293
01:43:39,863 --> 01:43:43,924
''Everyone's dreams are wounded.''

1294
01:43:44,334 --> 01:43:48,395
''Everyone is restless.''

1295
01:43:48,705 --> 01:43:52,869
''The day's like a mourning.''

1296
01:43:53,009 --> 01:43:56,706
''The night laments every day.''

1297
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:05,945
''Is righteousness or duty
grea ter than all?''

1298
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:14,560
''Man thinks, standing
a t a crossroad.''

1299
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:19,560
''Man thinks standing a t a crossroad.''

1300
01:44:23,406 --> 01:44:32,337
''wha t is right and wha t is wrong,
decide, O' Almighty.''

1301
01:44:32,482 --> 01:44:36,543
''May we inculca te all virtues.''

1302
01:44:36,853 --> 01:44:40,914
''May we inculca te all virtues.''

1303
01:44:40,991 --> 01:44:45,052
''By overcoming all vices.''

1304
01:44:45,328 --> 01:44:54,396
''On us, your servants, O' lord,
shower your blessings''

1305
01:45:12,922 --> 01:45:13,980
You know?

1306
01:45:16,326 --> 01:45:18,385
After spending years together..

1307
01:45:18,461 --> 01:45:22,830
..today for the first time,
your mom has realized..

1308
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:27,063
..tha t I'm only a police officer.

1309
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,597
A very good police officer. But..

1310
01:45:34,344 --> 01:45:35,504
But not a good dad !

1311
01:45:39,683 --> 01:45:44,780
Does she think tha t it's
only her tha t loves you?

1312
01:45:47,323 --> 01:45:50,486
Is she the only one pining for you?

1313
01:45:51,861 --> 01:45:52,919
Is she the only one in grief?

1314
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:54,688
Does she think..

1315
01:45:54,764 --> 01:46:00,396
..my heart is of stone?

1316
01:46:02,839 --> 01:46:06,331
Don't I ever feel pain?

1317
01:46:07,577 --> 01:46:13,743
she thinks I won't feel anything
if you're punished.

1318
01:46:14,951 --> 01:46:16,384
I won't feel anything !

1319
01:46:18,054 --> 01:46:22,388
Karan, if anything happens to you,
I'll be the first one to sha tter!

1320
01:46:25,929 --> 01:46:27,453
I'll be finished !

1321
01:46:38,341 --> 01:46:39,399
sir!

1322
01:46:40,877 --> 01:46:43,072
Your son's case goes for the
final hearing on the 17 th.

1323
01:46:43,947 --> 01:46:45,539
Everything else has been
taken care of. But..

1324
01:46:46,349 --> 01:46:47,646
A.C.P siddhant is still a threa t.

1325
01:46:48,952 --> 01:46:50,681
There isn't any threa t
left, Bhandari.

1326
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:54,923
He will testify in our favour.

1327
01:46:59,629 --> 01:47:00,994
There's a saying in English.

1328
01:47:02,065 --> 01:47:04,533
There's only one perfect
child in the world.

1329
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:06,728
And every fa ther has it.

1330
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:10,568
There's only one perfect
child in the world.

1331
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:13,406
And every dad has it.

1332
01:47:16,846 --> 01:47:19,371
A child makes a man
very weak, Bhandari.

1333
01:47:21,484 --> 01:47:25,545
His son has pushed him into
the same sinking boa t..

1334
01:47:25,622 --> 01:47:29,388
..the one tha t we were traveling in.

1335
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:33,927
Now, tha t isn't really something
to gloa t over, Mr. shobhraj.

1336
01:47:35,899 --> 01:47:38,333
Because I don't think
this is going..

1337
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:40,392
..to benefit you in any way.

1338
01:47:42,105 --> 01:47:43,595
There's a saying in English.

1339
01:47:44,674 --> 01:47:46,471
Better bend than break.

1340
01:47:47,677 --> 01:47:50,339
It's much better to
bow than to break!

1341
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:55,749
Compromise with your principles,
Mr. siddhant.

1342
01:47:56,786 --> 01:47:59,778
Else, you'll break, and
sha ttered, real bad !

1343
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:03,450
Think this over.

1344
01:48:05,094 --> 01:48:06,721
should anything happen to your son..

1345
01:48:06,796 --> 01:48:09,731
..will you be able
to face your wife?

1346
01:48:12,669 --> 01:48:14,660
Besides, your son has
just come of age.

1347
01:48:16,339 --> 01:48:17,772
He's yet to live a full life.

1348
01:48:20,343 --> 01:48:22,402
Children are prone
to commit mistakes.

1349
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,574
But it doesn't mean tha t..

1350
01:48:25,682 --> 01:48:29,584
..we must confine our children
to the gallows.

1351
01:48:34,324 --> 01:48:36,588
There's only one way
to settle this case.

1352
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:41,388
Let's join hands.

1353
01:48:45,335 --> 01:48:46,393
Amazing !

1354
01:48:47,403 --> 01:48:51,464
People prefer a slap
from a rich man..

1355
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:55,602
..and you hesita te shaking hands!

1356
01:48:56,346 --> 01:49:00,783
It'd be better, Mr. shobhraj,
if you leave.

1357
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:02,375
Very well. I'll leave.

1358
01:49:04,654 --> 01:49:05,712
Believe me..

1359
01:49:06,589 --> 01:49:08,819
..if you let my son off the hook.

1360
01:49:09,926 --> 01:49:12,724
I promise to get your
son off the rammer too.

1361
01:49:13,763 --> 01:49:15,060
You may not know this.

1362
01:49:16,065 --> 01:49:19,330
But I can reach out to places
where science cannot reach.

1363
01:49:19,402 --> 01:49:21,927
Mr. shobhraj !
- No, no Mr. siddhant!

1364
01:49:23,339 --> 01:49:24,931
I don't like rushing things.

1365
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:31,342
Go meet your son and
check on his sta te.

1366
01:49:32,348 --> 01:49:33,781
Give me a reply after tha t.

1367
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:38,509
I'll wait for it.

1368
01:49:39,989 --> 01:49:41,047
Good night!

1369
01:49:48,831 --> 01:49:52,323
My lord ! A key witness to
the case, the shopkeeper..

1370
01:49:52,402 --> 01:49:54,700
..wishes to depose before
the court once again.

1371
01:49:55,004 --> 01:49:56,062
Permission granted.

1372
01:49:58,341 --> 01:49:59,399
Your Honour!

1373
01:49:59,475 --> 01:50:04,674
The police had forced me to say
tha t N iranjan raped and killed Bela.

1374
01:50:06,482 --> 01:50:07,642
The truth is tha t..

1375
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:10,847
..I've never seen the accused
anywhere near my shop.

1376
01:50:13,323 --> 01:50:16,451
we are aware, sir, of the gravity
of something like murder.

1377
01:50:17,093 --> 01:50:18,788
we also know how we
could be punished.

1378
01:50:19,896 --> 01:50:21,329
But the truth is tha t..

1379
01:50:22,098 --> 01:50:26,535
N iranjan didn't rape and kill
tha t girl. we did it.

1380
01:50:29,105 --> 01:50:30,936
N iranjan wasn't even present there.

1381
01:50:31,074 --> 01:50:32,336
My lord !

1382
01:50:32,508 --> 01:50:36,342
I'd known from day one, tha t
witnesses would be bought over.

1383
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:37,969
And truth would be distorted.

1384
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:43,375
Tha t's because of Mr.
shobhraj's connections.

1385
01:50:43,686 --> 01:50:46,712
But, I still have a witness..

1386
01:50:46,789 --> 01:50:51,783
..who can't be bought,
nor threa tened.

1387
01:50:52,895 --> 01:50:57,923
The witness is none else,
but the poor victim's dad..

1388
01:50:58,001 --> 01:51:03,337
..who has given his daughter away
in dea th, ra ther than in marriage!

1389
01:51:06,943 --> 01:51:12,973
My lord, this person was a witness
to tha t orgy of rape.

1390
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:30,957
Mr. sharma.

1391
01:51:31,401 --> 01:51:33,665
where were you around 12
noon on 13th of December?

1392
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:36,731
I'd gone to the shop carrying
lunch for her.

1393
01:51:36,873 --> 01:51:38,067
wha t did you see there?

1394
01:51:39,942 --> 01:51:41,000
The 3 of them had..

1395
01:51:41,077 --> 01:51:42,669
..taken her inside the shop,
and locked up the place.

1396
01:51:43,012 --> 01:51:46,379
They bea t her mercilessly.
Bea t her mercilessly.

1397
01:51:46,549 --> 01:51:48,983
I tried to stop them.

1398
01:51:49,052 --> 01:51:51,577
But they behaved as if
they were possessed.
As if they were possessed.

1399
01:51:51,821 --> 01:51:54,449
He's the one who raped my daughter!

1400
01:51:56,059 --> 01:51:58,926
He's the murderer. He
killed my daughter!

1401
01:51:59,062 --> 01:52:00,324
Hang him!

1402
01:52:00,997 --> 01:52:02,760
Nonsense! I haven't done anything !

1403
01:52:02,932 --> 01:52:05,560
Haven't you? Haven't you
killed my daughter?

1404
01:52:05,701 --> 01:52:06,827
The old man is lying !

1405
01:52:07,003 --> 01:52:11,337
Am I? You killed my daughter
in my presence!

1406
01:52:11,407 --> 01:52:13,068
I saw it all. I was there
inside the shop.

1407
01:52:13,342 --> 01:52:15,708
You weren't there! There wasn't
anyone inside the shop.

1408
01:52:16,345 --> 01:52:17,642
If you weren't inside..

1409
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,446
..how would you know
if he was in or not?

1410
01:52:31,694 --> 01:52:32,786
Order! Order!

1411
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:35,522
My lord !

1412
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:37,924
The accused is right.

1413
01:52:38,067 --> 01:52:40,001
There was no one else in the shop.

1414
01:52:40,937 --> 01:52:41,995
Because, a t tha t time..

1415
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:44,403
..it's only the accused and
his friends who were in.

1416
01:52:48,678 --> 01:52:52,774
I beg of the court to forgive me
and this hapless dad for the deceit.

1417
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:57,442
I had him depose falsely, so tha t
the truth might be clear.

1418
01:52:58,387 --> 01:53:01,322
And the court finally knows
wha t the truth is.

1419
01:53:01,657 --> 01:53:02,715
Thank you, My lord !

1420
01:53:04,961 --> 01:53:08,328
This court, Ismail and Rajiv are
sentenced to 7 years of ..

1421
01:53:08,397 --> 01:53:12,697
..imprisonment for being accessories
to N iranjan's crime.

1422
01:53:16,839 --> 01:53:21,902
N iranjan is hereby
sentenced to dea th..

1423
01:53:21,978 --> 01:53:26,347
..for the rape and murder.

1424
01:53:26,382 --> 01:53:31,479
No! My son cannot be punished,
Michael.

1425
01:53:32,321 --> 01:53:33,481
Buy up the entire jail.

1426
01:53:34,323 --> 01:53:36,052
Pay them wha tever they want.

1427
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:38,524
But N iranjan has to come back.

1428
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,387
At wha tever cost!

1429
01:53:43,399 --> 01:53:44,457
Rastogi..

1430
01:53:44,534 --> 01:53:47,332
..charter a priva te aircraft.

1431
01:53:48,538 --> 01:53:50,335
I want to send my son far away..

1432
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:53,671
..from this country as
soon as he escapes.

1433
01:54:00,349 --> 01:54:04,513
N iranjan, your dad's sent
us to rescue you.

1434
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:05,645
Come on ! Quick!

1435
01:54:07,323 --> 01:54:08,449
Come on ! Quick!

1436
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:18,925
N iranjan ! why did you
stop? Come along !

1437
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:20,696
Let's take the fool along with us!

1438
01:54:24,974 --> 01:54:26,339
wha t are you staring?

1439
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:28,342
Even my dad who is such
a powerful person..

1440
01:54:28,411 --> 01:54:29,673
..couldn't get me off the hook.

1441
01:54:29,812 --> 01:54:31,575
Your dad is a faithful
servant of the law.

1442
01:54:31,681 --> 01:54:33,376
He himself will put
the noose around you.

1443
01:54:33,849 --> 01:54:36,750
stop thinking ! You won't
get a better chance.

1444
01:54:49,098 --> 01:54:50,497
Don't! Please don't bea t me!

1445
01:54:50,566 --> 01:54:53,057
Rocky had come to me. I don't
know where he's gone.

1446
01:54:53,336 --> 01:54:56,396
I swear by my kids. It's the truth !

1447
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:01,336
C'mon. Michael's waiting
a t the other end for us.

1448
01:55:01,410 --> 01:55:02,468
C'mon.

1449
01:55:03,879 --> 01:55:05,471
Come. - Karan !

1450
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:08,641
Come on ! Quick!

1451
01:55:09,352 --> 01:55:11,980
Come! Get away!

1452
01:55:27,336 --> 01:55:28,394
Don't hit my brother!

1453
01:55:37,647 --> 01:55:38,978
I've a lot of scores
to settle with you !

1454
01:55:55,765 --> 01:55:57,323
Let go, you fool!

1455
01:57:45,007 --> 01:57:46,065
No!

1456
01:57:58,587 --> 01:58:01,055
I'm running all over, trying to
prove your innocence, and you !

1457
01:58:01,857 --> 01:58:03,324
Do you know, today if..

1458
01:58:03,392 --> 01:58:04,450
Please forgive me, brother!

1459
01:58:09,398 --> 01:58:13,994
My son's been sent back to jail,
even after he escaped !

1460
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:16,064
And you couldn't do anything !

1461
01:58:16,539 --> 01:58:18,530
Things were out of hand before
I could reach, sir.

1462
01:58:19,475 --> 01:58:22,467
wha tever happened last night
was because of N iranjan !

1463
01:58:23,746 --> 01:58:25,976
Had he not taken the A.C.P's
son with him..

1464
01:58:26,081 --> 01:58:27,639
..his brother wouldn't
have interfered.

1465
01:58:28,984 --> 01:58:30,042
who?

1466
01:58:30,619 --> 01:58:31,984
who reached there?
- Deva.

1467
01:58:42,665 --> 01:58:43,723
wait!

1468
01:58:56,078 --> 01:58:58,376
I know you're fighting the law.

1469
01:58:59,348 --> 01:59:02,784
I'm not concerned over
who wins the ba ttle.

1470
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:08,452
I've come here to warn you not to
involve my brother in your fight.

1471
01:59:09,391 --> 01:59:11,325
Else, I may have to take
the law into my hands.

1472
01:59:12,328 --> 01:59:13,556
Tha t wouldn't be good for you !

1473
01:59:15,831 --> 01:59:18,732
You speak too loudly for a
person of your standing.

1474
01:59:20,336 --> 01:59:23,737
You should've compared your sta tus
to mine before threa tening me.

1475
01:59:24,907 --> 01:59:26,465
The ant shouting a t the elephant!

1476
01:59:27,476 --> 01:59:28,943
Not done, my boy!

1477
01:59:29,345 --> 01:59:31,472
A small ant inside an elephant's..

1478
01:59:31,547 --> 01:59:36,644
..ear can kill the tusker.

1479
01:59:38,754 --> 01:59:42,986
And I know wha t you mean
by this sta tus of yours.

1480
01:59:43,726 --> 01:59:45,023
You're a millionaire!

1481
01:59:45,661 --> 01:59:50,462
But for your son's life, you
came begging to my dad !

1482
01:59:57,106 --> 02:00:00,075
I've heard this hand dared
challenge my dad too.

1483
02:00:01,043 --> 02:00:02,340
Don't fool yourself into believing
tha t you're strong enough..

1484
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:05,869
..just because you've exercised in
the gym for 1 0 minutes a day.

1485
02:00:06,782 --> 02:00:11,048
I've been working with iron for 15
hours a day over the past 15 years.

1486
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:14,380
And when a glass strikes iron..

1487
02:00:14,456 --> 02:00:16,390
..it sha tters into innumerable
small pieces.

1488
02:00:17,993 --> 02:00:19,392
There's a saying in English.

1489
02:00:20,095 --> 02:00:21,323
Anger..

1490
02:00:21,397 --> 02:00:22,523
Tell tha t to someone else.

1491
02:00:22,665 --> 02:00:25,463
As for me, I understand
only one language, Hindi!

1492
02:00:26,402 --> 02:00:27,835
And, there's a saying out there.

1493
02:00:28,337 --> 02:00:29,395
A 1 00 blows from a goldsmith
do not compare..

1494
02:00:29,471 --> 02:00:30,529
..with one from a blacksmith.

1495
02:00:32,007 --> 02:00:33,838
My brother is my mom's life support.

1496
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:37,372
And I've promised my mom
I'll get back her life!

1497
02:00:38,347 --> 02:00:41,373
Anyone who wishes dea th
for my brother..

1498
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:43,441
..dies a t my hands!

1499
02:00:45,588 --> 02:00:46,646
Remember tha t!

1500
02:00:52,628 --> 02:00:55,392
sir, if you say so!
- No, Michael!

1501
02:00:57,833 --> 02:01:00,324
I'd thought his dad was the snake..

1502
02:01:00,402 --> 02:01:03,929
..but he turned out to be a Cobra !

1503
02:01:05,808 --> 02:01:09,073
we must think of a way to
bump both of them off.

1504
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:13,073
wha t was it tha t he said?

1505
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,844
Tha t his brother is his
mom's life support?

1506
02:01:19,989 --> 02:01:23,322
In tha t case, the fellow must
hang a t the earliest.

1507
02:01:24,793 --> 02:01:25,851
Call a press conference.

1508
02:01:27,329 --> 02:01:29,490
Have you seen today's papers?
- Yes, sir!

1509
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:34,392
These papers, which were singing
your praises yesterday..

1510
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:42,935
..are printing denigra tions
against you now!

1511
02:01:43,646 --> 02:01:46,547
You make sure tha t others are
punished a t the earliest.

1512
02:01:47,383 --> 02:01:50,648
wha t took you so long to prepare
a charge sheet against your son?

1513
02:01:51,053 --> 02:01:53,578
Inspector Veer singh is drawing
up the charge sheet.

1514
02:02:20,082 --> 02:02:24,781
I want to see the convict
in court tomorrow.

1515
02:02:25,921 --> 02:02:27,786
Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1516
02:02:29,324 --> 02:02:33,317
At the outset, we must have
our plans laid out clearly.

1517
02:02:33,395 --> 02:02:36,831
I can con two of them. As
for the rest.. - Uncle!

1518
02:02:36,999 --> 02:02:39,058
Can't you sit down? why
are you trotting about?

1519
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:41,926
I'm thinking !
- why can't you sit down and think?

1520
02:02:42,905 --> 02:02:44,532
There seems to be a
ban on thinking too!

1521
02:02:49,411 --> 02:02:52,471
wha t's up? Don't look a t me
like tha t, I get disturbed.

1522
02:02:52,548 --> 02:02:55,346
Thinking isn't easy.

1523
02:02:55,384 --> 02:02:57,784
You've got to do a lot to get ideas!

1524
02:02:57,853 --> 02:02:59,047
You think it's a joke!

1525
02:02:59,354 --> 02:03:01,322
And here I am, worried stiff over
Karan's case starting tomorrow.

1526
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:02,448
I'm going mad !

1527
02:03:02,524 --> 02:03:03,582
Mad?

1528
02:03:07,329 --> 02:03:08,660
Right, mad !

1529
02:03:09,064 --> 02:03:10,622
Looks like you've gone mad !

1530
02:03:11,333 --> 02:03:13,494
No, his brother is
going to turn mad !

1531
02:03:17,906 --> 02:03:20,932
It isn't easy to prove
tha t someone is mad.

1532
02:03:21,076 --> 02:03:22,873
Not difficult a t all for me.

1533
02:03:22,945 --> 02:03:24,879
I was in a mental
asylum 4 years ago.

1534
02:03:24,947 --> 02:03:28,747
The doctor over there will surely
certify tha t Karan is mad !

1535
02:03:29,585 --> 02:03:31,917
You were in a mental
asylum 4 years ago?

1536
02:03:34,423 --> 02:03:36,755
Yes, I was.
- why?

1537
02:03:37,326 --> 02:03:42,559
Now wha t do I tell him? My
secret will be exposed.

1538
02:03:43,332 --> 02:03:49,601
Due to a deep shock, the accused
has lost his mental frame.

1539
02:03:50,773 --> 02:03:55,506
Look a t him! He's swimming
in the air!

1540
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,838
Order!

1541
02:03:59,381 --> 02:04:00,439
Your Honor!

1542
02:04:00,482 --> 02:04:05,920
I'm sure tha t this is a drama being
enacted to mislead the court.

1543
02:04:06,522 --> 02:04:11,050
I can prove it If I'm allowed
to question Dr. Gotiwalla.

1544
02:04:11,426 --> 02:04:12,484
Permission granted !

1545
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:15,995
Dr. Gotiwalla.

1546
02:04:16,799 --> 02:04:20,997
Can you say for sure tha t the
accused has lost his mental frame?

1547
02:04:21,069 --> 02:04:24,527
I've been trea ting luna tics
for the last 25 years.

1548
02:04:25,073 --> 02:04:26,335
Looking a t people's faces,

1549
02:04:26,408 --> 02:04:29,707
I can tell who's mad,
and who's about to be.

1550
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:32,876
But there must be some reason
for sudden a ttacks of lunacy.

1551
02:04:33,382 --> 02:04:34,747
Yes. There is.

1552
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:38,842
If something happens all of
a sudden, one might go mad.

1553
02:04:39,321 --> 02:04:44,315
You see, if anyone is suddenly
accused of murder..

1554
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:47,328
..and his dad acts like a true cop..

1555
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:50,331
..and throws him in jail!

1556
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,927
Tha t could be reason enough.

1557
02:04:56,805 --> 02:04:57,863
My lord !

1558
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:00,934
I would like to tell the court once
again tha t this is a farce!

1559
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:05,437
And I know who the mastermind is.

1560
02:05:07,349 --> 02:05:08,373
Karan..

1561
02:05:11,854 --> 02:05:13,412
I'm not your enemy!

1562
02:05:14,056 --> 02:05:16,752
wha tever advice I give you, will
be for your well-being? - Yes.

1563
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:19,054
Don't get swayed by others.

1564
02:05:20,062 --> 02:05:21,324
Else, you might land
in more trouble.

1565
02:05:21,396 --> 02:05:24,331
so then, go ahead and tell the
court tha t you aren't mad.

1566
02:05:24,833 --> 02:05:26,858
Mad? who's mad?

1567
02:05:27,603 --> 02:05:28,661
I'm perfectly all right!

1568
02:05:28,737 --> 02:05:30,398
But, shall I let you in on a secret?

1569
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:33,430
Everyone else in this party is mad !

1570
02:05:36,678 --> 02:05:39,078
I've never been to a
more boring party.

1571
02:05:40,349 --> 02:05:44,046
Half an hour, and nobody's
asked me for a drink yet!

1572
02:05:45,621 --> 02:05:48,385
Never mind. Let me have a cigarette.

1573
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:50,990
Come on ! Give me a cigarette!

1574
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,388
My pa tient must be given
a cigarette immedia tely.

1575
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:56,328
Else, he might go raving mad !

1576
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,342
weren't you telling me something?

1577
02:06:20,589 --> 02:06:22,318
Help him.
- wha t happened?

1578
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:26,526
The pa tient's condition is worsening.
He must be taken to hospital.

1579
02:06:27,329 --> 02:06:30,321
The court hereby directs
the accused to be sent..

1580
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:33,061
..to a mental asylum for observa tion
for 15 days.

1581
02:06:33,335 --> 02:06:34,927
Come on. Hurry up.

1582
02:06:35,003 --> 02:06:36,732
He's ill. Please excuse.

1583
02:06:37,506 --> 02:06:38,564
Come fast.

1584
02:06:43,011 --> 02:06:45,070
wha t have you done, Deva?

1585
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,345
You've sent my son to the asylum?

1586
02:06:48,483 --> 02:06:50,451
I had no way out, mother.

1587
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:54,050
I need more time to prove
Karan's innocence.

1588
02:06:54,323 --> 02:06:56,723
Even if you get time, you won't
be able to prove anything.

1589
02:06:57,826 --> 02:07:01,489
The drama tha t the two of you have
staged is going to end very soon.

1590
02:07:02,331 --> 02:07:05,323
Instead of helping him, you've
put him in more trouble.

1591
02:07:06,068 --> 02:07:09,333
The public prosecutor has asked for
an opinion from another doctor.

1592
02:07:09,638 --> 02:07:12,471
And he'd definitely prove tha t
your brother isn't mad !

1593
02:07:14,676 --> 02:07:18,339
Before he proves tha t
my brother isn't mad..

1594
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:20,644
..I'll prove he isn't guilty.

1595
02:07:21,049 --> 02:07:23,040
Don't give your mom false hopes.

1596
02:07:23,986 --> 02:07:27,046
If you can't do wha t you say,
she'll be very sad !

1597
02:07:28,857 --> 02:07:32,918
I want to protect both of
you from this sadness.

1598
02:07:34,329 --> 02:07:37,321
Because I know for a fact tha t
when Karan is sentenced..

1599
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:39,890
..you'd be the first
one to break down !

1600
02:07:43,005 --> 02:07:44,836
Try as hard as you may

1601
02:07:46,341 --> 02:07:49,936
I don't think you'll be able
to save me from grief.

1602
02:07:57,352 --> 02:07:59,320
''Take it.''

1603
02:08:01,923 --> 02:08:02,981
Don't fear!

1604
02:08:03,558 --> 02:08:05,321
I haven't come here
to ask for Rocky.

1605
02:08:05,394 --> 02:08:06,986
I'm here to ask about the doctor

1606
02:08:07,062 --> 02:08:08,893
who helped you get on
your feet so soon.

1607
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:31,319
Indulging in your brother's scrap
made one leg ineffective..

1608
02:08:31,386 --> 02:08:32,478
..shall I break the other one too?

1609
02:08:32,554 --> 02:08:34,988
Didn't! I'll tell.

1610
02:08:36,625 --> 02:08:39,321
Rocky's leaving by the 7
o'clock flight tomorrow.

1611
02:08:40,328 --> 02:08:42,057
Here's his ticket.

1612
02:08:43,065 --> 02:08:45,533
where can I find him now?
- I don't know.

1613
02:09:05,921 --> 02:09:08,321
Uncle!

1614
02:09:11,927 --> 02:09:13,053
sleeping?

1615
02:09:15,063 --> 02:09:16,587
It's 4 in the morning.

1616
02:09:16,665 --> 02:09:20,066
I wasn't born of an owl to
stay awake! Let me sleep.

1617
02:09:20,335 --> 02:09:21,734
Rocky isn't here yet, and you.

1618
02:09:21,803 --> 02:09:24,067
O God ! He will, don't worry.

1619
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:27,335
Birds come to their old
haunts one last time..

1620
02:09:27,409 --> 02:09:29,377
..before they move over
to another nest.

1621
02:09:31,947 --> 02:09:33,073
Looks like he's here.

1622
02:10:31,072 --> 02:10:32,334
You're looking for this, right?

1623
02:10:33,708 --> 02:10:37,337
Till you let me know
who killed Amrita..

1624
02:10:37,379 --> 02:10:41,679
..you aren't going anywhere
as long as I'm alive.

1625
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,718
wha t after your dea th?

1626
02:12:09,504 --> 02:12:10,562
sir!

1627
02:12:11,339 --> 02:12:13,330
On the basis of medical checks..

1628
02:12:13,408 --> 02:12:16,434
..we can now certify tha t
Karan isn't mad.

1629
02:12:19,347 --> 02:12:20,439
Give you an injection.

1630
02:12:20,982 --> 02:12:24,315
Karan, come with me.
- where to?

1631
02:12:24,386 --> 02:12:25,785
I haven't finished exercising !

1632
02:12:25,854 --> 02:12:28,687
This drama won't get you anywhere.

1633
02:12:28,923 --> 02:12:30,754
My pa tient is unwell!
- shut up!

1634
02:12:31,059 --> 02:12:33,050
Dare you speak to Dr.
Gotiwala like tha t!

1635
02:12:33,361 --> 02:12:35,329
Very soon, you'll be imprisoned..

1636
02:12:35,397 --> 02:12:37,695
..on charges of making false
depositions in court.

1637
02:12:38,333 --> 02:12:39,391
C'mon, Karan.

1638
02:12:39,467 --> 02:12:40,934
I have to exercise.
- C'mon.

1639
02:12:41,002 --> 02:12:42,060
why are you dragging me?

1640
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,399
I'd promised you I'd prove
my brother's innocence..

1641
02:12:49,477 --> 02:12:51,945
..before you disprove his lunacy.

1642
02:12:53,348 --> 02:12:56,647
Here's the real killer. The
club dancer's murderer.

1643
02:12:57,552 --> 02:12:59,383
And you couldn't find him.

1644
02:13:02,824 --> 02:13:06,351
Is tha t true?

1645
02:13:07,629 --> 02:13:10,564
Yes, sir. I'd killed Amrita.

1646
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:19,932
'You hit me!'
- Have you gone mad?'

1647
02:13:20,075 --> 02:13:21,337
'You hit me?'

1648
02:13:23,445 --> 02:13:24,844
'You fool!'

1649
02:13:24,879 --> 02:13:26,346
'Amrita !'
- Let me go! '

1650
02:13:26,748 --> 02:13:27,976
'I said, leave me!'

1651
02:13:42,063 --> 02:13:43,325
A.C.P sir!

1652
02:13:43,398 --> 02:13:47,459
My mom awaits her innocent
son's return.

1653
02:13:48,903 --> 02:13:50,427
May I take my brother home?

1654
02:13:53,074 --> 02:13:54,473
I need one more day.

1655
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:59,840
After he confesses before the
court, your brother is free.

1656
02:14:00,682 --> 02:14:01,842
Take him away.

1657
02:14:07,422 --> 02:14:11,051
I'm very proud of you, Deva !

1658
02:14:18,333 --> 02:14:19,391
No!

1659
02:14:19,968 --> 02:14:23,062
No! we can't allow tha t to happen.

1660
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,340
If Rocky confesses..

1661
02:14:27,409 --> 02:14:30,344
..tha t he killed
the girl on my orders..

1662
02:14:30,378 --> 02:14:34,337
..then the appeal for Presidential
pardon for my son..

1663
02:14:34,382 --> 02:14:36,976
..will be rejected.

1664
02:14:39,521 --> 02:14:42,820
I've killed many for my son.

1665
02:14:44,325 --> 02:14:46,054
One more won't make a difference.

1666
02:14:48,530 --> 02:14:49,997
No ma tter wha t happens,

1667
02:14:51,766 --> 02:14:54,064
Rocky shouldn't reach the court.

1668
02:14:58,072 --> 02:15:01,064
''As Ranjha and Heer..''

1669
02:15:01,409 --> 02:15:04,469
''Loved each other.''

1670
02:15:04,946 --> 02:15:07,972
''As Mahi and soni..''

1671
02:15:08,049 --> 02:15:11,382
''Loved each other.''

1672
02:15:11,453 --> 02:15:14,911
''Loved each other.''

1673
02:15:18,493 --> 02:15:25,057
''Love me as no lover can.''

1674
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:32,068
''Love me as no lover can.''

1675
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:35,468
''I'll make Laila seem
insignificant.''

1676
02:15:35,543 --> 02:15:38,876
''And you checkma te Majnu.''

1677
02:15:45,854 --> 02:15:52,487
''Like no other lover can
you love me like tha t.''

1678
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:59,329
''Love me as no lover can.''

1679
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:02,858
''I'll make Majnu seem
insignificant.''

1680
02:16:02,937 --> 02:16:06,065
''And you checkma te Laila.''

1681
02:16:37,005 --> 02:16:38,802
''The passion has awakened.''

1682
02:16:39,073 --> 02:16:40,540
''The fire has ignited.''

1683
02:16:40,608 --> 02:16:44,066
''Listen, O world, today's
lover is not crazy.''

1684
02:16:44,345 --> 02:16:47,644
''we don't only know to die,
we know to love too.''

1685
02:16:47,749 --> 02:16:49,341
''The passion has awakened.''

1686
02:16:49,384 --> 02:16:50,976
''The fire has ignited.''

1687
02:16:51,052 --> 02:16:54,510
''I lost my heart for you.
It's only you on my mind.''

1688
02:16:54,589 --> 02:16:55,988
''The passion has awakened.''

1689
02:16:56,057 --> 02:16:57,718
''The fire has ignited.''

1690
02:16:58,059 --> 02:17:01,324
''My passion is unique.''

1691
02:17:01,396 --> 02:17:04,763
''My love is my devotion.''

1692
02:17:04,832 --> 02:17:08,324
''My passion is unique.''

1693
02:17:08,403 --> 02:17:11,668
''My love is my devotion.''

1694
02:17:11,739 --> 02:17:13,331
''The passion has ignite.''

1695
02:17:13,408 --> 02:17:15,000
''The fire has ignited.''

1696
02:17:15,076 --> 02:17:21,572
''Everyday, every moment.
You meet me.''

1697
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:28,412
''Everyday, every moment.
You meet me.''

1698
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:32,317
''I'll checkma te Majnu.''

1699
02:17:32,393 --> 02:17:35,658
''And you checkma te Laila.''

1700
02:18:06,361 --> 02:18:08,056
''The passion has awakened.''

1701
02:18:08,329 --> 02:18:09,921
''The fire has ignited.''

1702
02:18:09,998 --> 02:18:13,593
''I'm not so naive tha t
I'd forgot my love.''

1703
02:18:13,668 --> 02:18:17,001
''Even I don't lack the courage
to prove my love.''

1704
02:18:17,071 --> 02:18:20,507
''I'll be with you a t every step.''

1705
02:18:20,575 --> 02:18:22,008
''The passion has awakened.''

1706
02:18:22,076 --> 02:18:23,771
''The fire has ignited.''

1707
02:18:23,878 --> 02:18:27,336
''I'm thirst and you're an ocean.''

1708
02:18:27,382 --> 02:18:30,715
''My existence is meaningless
without you.''

1709
02:18:30,785 --> 02:18:34,312
''I'm thirst and you're an ocean.''

1710
02:18:34,389 --> 02:18:37,654
''My existence is meaningless
without you.''

1711
02:18:37,725 --> 02:18:39,056
''The passion has awakened.''

1712
02:18:39,327 --> 02:18:40,988
''The fire has ignited.''

1713
02:18:41,062 --> 02:18:44,327
''so tha t the fire in
the body is cooled..

1714
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:47,857
..shower such love on me.''

1715
02:18:47,935 --> 02:18:51,336
''so tha t the fire in
the body is cooled..

1716
02:18:51,406 --> 02:18:54,637
..shower such love on me.''

1717
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:57,974
''I'll checkma te Laila.''

1718
02:18:58,079 --> 02:19:01,446
''You checkma te Majnu.''

1719
02:19:08,489 --> 02:19:15,053
''Like no other lover can,
you love me like tha t.''

1720
02:19:15,329 --> 02:19:18,730
''I'll make Majnu seem
insignificant.''

1721
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:22,065
''And you checkma te Laila.''

1722
02:19:50,398 --> 02:19:51,456
How did it happen?

1723
02:19:54,335 --> 02:19:56,064
I ask you, how did this happen?

1724
02:19:56,337 --> 02:19:57,463
we don't know anything, sir!
- shut up!

1725
02:19:58,339 --> 02:20:00,330
In the presence of
so many policemen..

1726
02:20:00,408 --> 02:20:02,342
..a person is killed in custody!

1727
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:05,379
And you say you don't know!
wha t were you doing?

1728
02:20:05,446 --> 02:20:07,346
I'll suspend each and
every one of you !

1729
02:20:09,984 --> 02:20:13,317
stop staring now and send the body
for the post mortem. - Yes, sir!

1730
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:24,730
Dad, tha t was Rocky!

1731
02:20:25,833 --> 02:20:27,323
someone's killed Rocky.

1732
02:20:28,669 --> 02:20:29,931
wha t is to happen
to my brother then?

1733
02:20:31,005 --> 02:20:34,065
First of all, we must
find Rocky's assassin.

1734
02:20:34,675 --> 02:20:36,336
wha t if we can't find him?

1735
02:20:37,378 --> 02:20:39,846
My brother will stay implica ted,
right?

1736
02:20:40,348 --> 02:20:43,340
Trust me, Deva. I'll prove
your brother's innocence.

1737
02:20:43,918 --> 02:20:45,852
I'll speak to the judge
and my seniors.

1738
02:20:47,321 --> 02:20:49,312
Though you know everything
you still have to prove..

1739
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:50,914
..your son's innocence.

1740
02:20:51,759 --> 02:20:53,920
Tha t's why I ha te this law of yours!

1741
02:20:54,061 --> 02:20:55,323
I'd known tha t the blind law..

1742
02:20:55,396 --> 02:20:58,661
..will hang my innocent brother
without evidence.

1743
02:20:59,634 --> 02:21:03,001
It was tough getting the evidence
tha t you've squandered so easily!

1744
02:21:04,338 --> 02:21:07,569
wish I'd not trusted you the
way I didn't trust the law!

1745
02:21:08,709 --> 02:21:10,336
Deva..

1746
02:21:10,378 --> 02:21:14,337
..the law might need some time
to bring forth the truth..

1747
02:21:14,382 --> 02:21:16,577
..but the truth will be out.

1748
02:21:18,452 --> 02:21:19,510
Very well then.

1749
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:23,647
You asked for a single day.
Now I give you a day more.

1750
02:21:24,325 --> 02:21:26,816
Find wha tever truth you may. Else..

1751
02:21:27,328 --> 02:21:31,662
I won't seek help either from you
or the law to set my brother free.

1752
02:21:39,407 --> 02:21:40,567
Hello!
- shobhraj !

1753
02:21:41,409 --> 02:21:42,467
Gautam..

1754
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:44,068
Is everything alright?

1755
02:21:45,079 --> 02:21:47,547
The President has refused
your son's pardon.

1756
02:21:49,951 --> 02:21:54,047
And N iranjan's last wish is
tha t you must see him hang.

1757
02:21:55,723 --> 02:21:56,781
You..

1758
02:21:58,059 --> 02:21:59,321
Hello!

1759
02:21:59,393 --> 02:22:00,451
Hello, shobhraj !

1760
02:22:03,798 --> 02:22:05,060
Go away!

1761
02:22:06,334 --> 02:22:07,858
Leave me alone!

1762
02:22:32,393 --> 02:22:33,724
Happy birthday, my son !

1763
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:39,356
won't you sing my birthday
song for me, dad?

1764
02:22:42,904 --> 02:22:45,737
It's none but your evil
eye tha t's cast on me!

1765
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,943
You've made me lose, dad !

1766
02:23:23,644 --> 02:23:24,668
No!

1767
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:28,344
I don't want the mask!
Hang me just like tha t.

1768
02:23:29,483 --> 02:23:33,510
I wish tha t this dad of mine sees
my face properly as I die!

1769
02:23:34,522 --> 02:23:37,719
so tha t he'd regret this
helplessness for a lifetime.

1770
02:23:41,329 --> 02:23:43,627
I erred just once!

1771
02:23:44,065 --> 02:23:45,999
I trusted this man !

1772
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:53,332
You'd said tha t every word
of yours is the law, right?

1773
02:23:54,342 --> 02:23:57,072
said tha t nothing will happen
to me! You're a liar!

1774
02:23:57,878 --> 02:23:59,345
You're a big liar!

1775
02:25:23,397 --> 02:25:26,332
He was born on the 4th day..

1776
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:29,767
..of the 4th month a t 4.00 a.m.

1777
02:25:32,073 --> 02:25:35,338
He died on the 4th day..

1778
02:25:35,409 --> 02:25:38,640
..of the 4th month a t 4.00 a.m.

1779
02:25:41,348 --> 02:25:44,317
Call it coincidence or a curse..

1780
02:25:44,385 --> 02:25:49,948
..but the figure 4 stayed
with my son always.

1781
02:25:52,359 --> 02:25:54,327
He had 4 friends.

1782
02:25:56,063 --> 02:25:59,328
And the person who sent
him to the gallows..

1783
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:02,426
..has 4 people in his family too.

1784
02:26:04,839 --> 02:26:07,330
My son's soul would rest in peace..

1785
02:26:07,408 --> 02:26:11,674
..only when 4 more pyres
light close to his.

1786
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:15,342
Tha t of A.C.P. siddhant
and his family.

1787
02:26:15,382 --> 02:26:16,440
sir.

1788
02:26:17,318 --> 02:26:19,445
You'd helped us once,
many years ago.

1789
02:26:20,488 --> 02:26:23,480
Your wish is our command.

1790
02:26:24,525 --> 02:26:27,323
The law may rule this city..

1791
02:26:27,394 --> 02:26:29,828
..but it's we who're the rulers!

1792
02:26:31,432 --> 02:26:33,491
Just order us!

1793
02:26:37,071 --> 02:26:40,336
The A.C.P thinks
the crisis is over!

1794
02:26:42,676 --> 02:26:45,338
He should know..

1795
02:26:45,379 --> 02:26:47,643
..tha t the crisis has just begun.

1796
02:26:54,321 --> 02:26:56,414
Pushpa !

1797
02:27:11,405 --> 02:27:14,397
Brother Laxmi.

1798
02:27:19,947 --> 02:27:22,541
Hello!
- There's a saying in English.

1799
02:27:23,651 --> 02:27:26,313
Vengeance is a dish..

1800
02:27:26,387 --> 02:27:28,753
..which tastes best when it is cold.

1801
02:27:30,057 --> 02:27:35,051
Revenge when taken a t leisure,
becomes headier.

1802
02:27:36,363 --> 02:27:38,331
The whole city came to my house..

1803
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:40,867
..to offer condolences
on my son's dea th.

1804
02:27:41,435 --> 02:27:42,766
Only you were not there.

1805
02:27:44,004 --> 02:27:45,335
Never mind !

1806
02:27:45,973 --> 02:27:48,407
You'll come to meet
your son, won't you?

1807
02:27:50,377 --> 02:27:52,868
Come over to the new bridge
in half an hour.

1808
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:55,448
shobhraj, if..
- No more, siddhant!

1809
02:27:57,051 --> 02:27:58,882
You've said all you had to.

1810
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,445
Today, I shall speak. Listen.

1811
02:28:03,591 --> 02:28:07,527
I haven't yet told you where
I've kept your wife.

1812
02:28:08,562 --> 02:28:11,326
Make sure you come to
meet your son alone.

1813
02:28:11,398 --> 02:28:13,389
Else, your wife dies first.

1814
02:28:15,769 --> 02:28:16,827
shobhraj !

1815
02:28:25,379 --> 02:28:27,939
Deva !
- wait for me for an hour.

1816
02:28:28,349 --> 02:28:30,840
If I can save mom, I'll
definitely come back.

1817
02:28:47,935 --> 02:28:49,562
where's my son, shobhraj?

1818
02:28:51,071 --> 02:28:52,333
Come sit.

1819
02:28:54,341 --> 02:28:55,399
sit down.

1820
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:11,482
I haven't yet crema ted him.

1821
02:29:12,826 --> 02:29:15,317
Today! we'll crema te him today.

1822
02:29:16,563 --> 02:29:20,329
But before tha t, I must show you,

1823
02:29:20,401 --> 02:29:24,337
wha t a dad feels when he has..

1824
02:29:24,405 --> 02:29:28,842
..to see his young son die!

1825
02:29:41,689 --> 02:29:42,815
Daddy!

1826
02:30:52,659 --> 02:30:53,717
Mom!

1827
02:31:03,337 --> 02:31:04,463
Deva !
- Mom!

1828
02:31:07,341 --> 02:31:10,367
Isn't this the way they make
scaffolds to hang people in prison?

1829
02:31:12,346 --> 02:31:14,974
we've made it just like
tha t, for your son.

1830
02:31:16,350 --> 02:31:17,578
Let us know if anything is amiss.

1831
02:31:19,319 --> 02:31:20,911
Listen to this carefully.

1832
02:31:20,988 --> 02:31:23,047
No threa ts here!

1833
02:31:24,491 --> 02:31:25,822
Not today!

1834
02:31:26,727 --> 02:31:28,388
No warnings today, siddhant!

1835
02:31:29,329 --> 02:31:33,060
we rule the roost!

1836
02:31:34,067 --> 02:31:35,329
Look there.

1837
02:31:39,873 --> 02:31:41,067
No.

1838
02:32:01,328 --> 02:32:05,924
Your son will hang today, siddhant.

1839
02:32:07,701 --> 02:32:10,431
It won't be an executioner
who'd hang him.

1840
02:32:11,805 --> 02:32:15,070
It would be you ! with
your own hands!

1841
02:32:26,587 --> 02:32:27,713
Deva !

1842
02:32:30,924 --> 02:32:32,892
Hang your son.

1843
02:32:33,894 --> 02:32:35,054
Hang your son !
Hang your son !

1844
02:32:57,317 --> 02:32:59,308
Dad, I can't see you in
this sta te any more!

1845
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:01,651
Please agree to wha t they say.

1846
02:33:02,623 --> 02:33:03,681
Let me die!

1847
02:33:04,591 --> 02:33:05,922
But please save my mom!

1848
02:33:07,327 --> 02:33:09,352
My son !

1849
02:33:09,763 --> 02:33:10,821

1850
02:34:51,598 --> 02:34:52,656
siddhant!

1851
02:37:03,730 --> 02:37:12,069
''If you have mercy,
people meet each other.''

1852
02:37:12,606 --> 02:37:20,843
''It is true tha t in autumn,
flowers too bloom.''

1853
02:37:21,448 --> 02:37:29,913
''It is true tha t in autumn,
flowers too bloom.''

1854
02:37:30,323 --> 02:37:34,453
''Flowers too bloom.''

1855
02:37:38,532 --> 02:37:47,065
''The heart tha t burns in pain,
shower blessings for it.''

1856

''May we inculca te all virtues.
May we overcome all vices.''

1857
02:37:56,049 --> 02:38:04,479
''On us your servants, O' lord,
