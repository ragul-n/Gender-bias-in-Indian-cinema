1
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,371
One... two...

2
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:49,376
I have had enough of washing and
cleaning for these festivals

3
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,144
Yes! I want to help you, but...

4
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,045
I can't even lift my hand.

5
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,450
You can't even lift your hand?

6
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,055
No I can't.

7
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,684
Curse his rotten hands,
how could he hurt you like this?

8
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,193
Where did he hit me?

9
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,827
If he had, would I have let him be?

10
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:06,690
I would have chopped off
his hands with this machete

11
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,055
That's exactly what you should do.

12
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,759
He came home drunk like a fish.

13
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,762
He didn't have his wits about him.

14
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,366
Even I got angry...

15
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:19,335
So when I went to scold
him he pushed me away.

16
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,273
See... how I bruised myself when I
fell against the grinding stone.

17
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:27,011
And when he saw me fall,
he snapped out of his buzz.

18
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:32,556
Saying? Forgive me Kali, I will
never do this again!' he swore on me.

19
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,525
Oh... to hell with his promises.

20
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,028
How many times has he already done it?

21
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,159
All the man in Kiragoor are the same.

22
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,666
They keep swearing on their children.
- You said it.

23
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,757
And you actually believed him.

24
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,661
Yes, you are quite right!

25
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,329
How do we break their habit though?

26
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,668
Hey, how else?

27
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,438
We should also start drinking. Only
then these shameless men will change.

28
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,807
He)!' you stupid girl.

29
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,809
Beware if you do that!

30
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,515
Just like this,
a woman in my birth village...

31
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,746
To stop her husband's smoking,
she started to smoke herself.

32
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,789
Do you know what happened after that?

33
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,151
What?
- Its been 2 years since he quit smoking.

34
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,091
But now she needs 2 packs a day.

35
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,360
What if the same happens to you?

36
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,091
Look here,

37
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,600
If we women start to drink...

38
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,364
what will become of
our children and homes?

39
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,769
Don't you dare do such a thing,
just get back to work.

40
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,065
Curse that wretched Shankarappa!

41
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,609
Why did he open that arrack shop?

42
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,302
Bear with it for a little longer.

43
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,646
Soon we will make our plight
known to someone important,

44
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,582
and they will show us a way out.

45
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,208
We will wait for such a day.

46
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,519
Our mother,
Goddess Kiragooravva is there.

47
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,353
Won't our troubles
become known to her soon?

48
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,500
Which village are you headed to?

49
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,400
Just to Kiragoor son.

50
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,138
What happened?

51
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,235
Our daughter has
sprained her lower back.

52
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,310
Oh, is that so!

53
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,572
I am Shankarappa,

54
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,147
I'm a village welfare correspondent.

55
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,148
All the surrounding villages
are under my control.

56
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,345
I am sort of a mobile government here.

57
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:44,621
Anyway, which caste do you belong to?

58
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,090
We are Lingayais.

59
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,152
Lingayais is it?

60
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,789
The man who removes the
sprain is of a lower caste.

61
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:52,655
He is a 'Kulavadi'

62
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,693
and she is a girl,
will you let him touch her?

63
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,529
Look here son.

64
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,168
Since this happened to our child,

65
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,706
we have visited every doctor
and prayed at every temple.

66
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,109
Some blessed people
told us to go to Kiragoor,

67
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,803
so trusting in god we are headed there.

68
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,446
That wasn't what I was trying to say...

69
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,141
Look son,
if he rid my child of this pain...

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,147
Whoever he is, whichever caste he is of.

71
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,187
I will place my head at his feet.

72
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,988
I was just reiterating
the general perception,

73
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,392
why are you getting mad for that?

74
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,157
It's getting windy, get going son.

75
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,323
We will take your leave then?

76
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,698
Okay take it.

77
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,604
This is what I get
for trying to be helpful.

78
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,082
Sir, check and see if its okay.

79
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,587
Hey!
- Yes...

80
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,289
You always make one
or the other mistake.

81
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,187
What wrong did I do now?

82
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,528
See there.

83
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,400
You have removed two more
hairs on the left moustache.

84
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,029
Oh its just hair right! It'll grow back.

85
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,302
Whatever it be, you can't do it
as good as the city folk.

86
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,237
Is it so.

87
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,537
If I get it done by them...

88
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,308
the face glows, it glows you know?

89
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,451
Do you know it, learn it you fool!

90
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,054
No matter how well I do it,
you'll say the same thing.

91
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,160
It seems to be getting windy yet again.

92
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:34,160
If it blows as hard
as it did the other day...

93
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,700
All the roof tiles will be blown away.

94
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:41,604
I have worn out my tongue, telling
them to fixing the roof tiles.

95
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,674
They keep yapping about
doing it then or now.

96
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,506
Even I am fed up telling them the same.

97
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:51,240
What else are they good for other than
yapping? When will they ever wise up?

98
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,785
Hey"- hey girl!

99
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,685
How much further is Kiragooru?

100
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,649
You'll reach there before you
finish another couple of your poems.

101
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,456
Keep going straight ahead.

102
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,025
Hey slowly...!

103
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:12,504
Look girls, people from surrounding villages
are coming to Kiragooru a lot more.

104
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,104
Its all to see our Karia.

105
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,602
Nagavva, bring it here quickly.

106
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,715
Take it, he put rolled a two.

107
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:29,045
To hell with you, why couldn't you
shake it nicely before you rolled it.

108
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,147
Hey, I did shake it.
If that is all that came, what can I do?

109
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,122
Oh a cart has come... a cart has come.

110
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,127
Hey stop and come to the side.

111
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,288
Stop it, stop it.

112
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,989
Come here you scoundrel!

113
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:40,995
Greetings all.

114
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:41,690
Which village are you from?

115
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,132
Near Ravandra.

116
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,635
Who is the one with a sprain?
Its our daughter.

117
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,039
Run and get Karia,
tell him they have come by cart.

118
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:48,732
Okay I'll get him.

119
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,236
Tie the ox to the side.

120
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,298
Who is the one with a sprain?

121
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,344
Hey stop your vehicle and stand aside!

122
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,412
See how all the chicken flew away!

123
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,115
Will you eat something?

124
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,515
Take it...

125
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,183
Swallow it.

126
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,785
For what reason has
our king come this far?

127
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,218
Black, black, Karianna
they have come by cart come quickly.

128
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,627
Oh so you came to see Karia?

129
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,598
He is there, go. Go and get him.

130
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,397
Black, black, Karianna
they have come by cart come quickly.

131
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,432
What is the hurry,
tell them I'll come in the evening.

132
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,504
Oh no, they have come by cart.

133
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,265
Then say that.

134
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,566
Come leis go.

135
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,310
Kiranna, make me a Chinnidaan
- I will make it, first you go.

136
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,209
Oh, this wretched wind!

137
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,142
What is its problem?

138
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,277
Hold your pall...

139
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,578
Why the hell she laughing like a fool?

140
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,214
Oh God, it's becoming difficult
to manage my sari also.

141
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,758
Oh can't you even catch a hold of it.

142
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,152
They will pluck the eyes out.

143
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,158
How well had you draped the sari?

144
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,658
It went flying away with the millet.

145
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,130
Damn this wretched wind!

146
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,632
Look how she is laughing.

147
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,398
Look at the plight!

148
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,134
The wind went in and out and
all over you and made you bare!

149
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,575
Why did you let it in anyways?

150
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,073
See now what the wind did to you!

151
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,013
You bloody! Why are laughing like that?
You also have what I have.

152
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,717
Hey, ifl had what you do would I laugh?

153
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,515
What the hell you,
let me hear you say it once again!

154
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,545
You bloody, what did you say?
Say it again!

155
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,749
It means the same every time I say it!

156
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,425
I said, ifl had what
you do would I laugh?

157
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,021
Don't just bark at me!
Give it to me!

158
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,691
Will you ever talk about me again?

159
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,429
You bloody, did you just
you throw millet on my face?

160
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,697
What the hell then?

161
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,672
You worthless bitch,
how is your's so special?

162
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,536
You say that your's
and mine are not the same!

163
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,543
Come let me strip you
naked and see how it is so!

164
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,442
What will my hands be tasting
sugar while you strip me?

165
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,176
If I don't chop off you head and
hand it to you, my name is not Kali!

166
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,683
Come you bitch! Lets settle this.

167
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,549
Let me see you do it, you!

168
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,278
You jumped on me like a cat, you!

169
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,756
Oh this bloody thing!

170
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,184
You ripped off my cloth!

171
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,692
Hey let go off my
husband's shirt! Let go!

172
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,725
Oh no, you ripped my husband's shirt!

173
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,461
Look what I will do to you now!

174
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,729
I'll rip all your's and
your husband's clothes off.

175
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,267
You mounted me like a mad dog,
you bitch!

176
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,399
Both of you stop!

177
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,669
Or at least get your asses off the millet.
- I won't let here go!

178
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,472
What, will I let you live?

179
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,206
Sister, please let her go!

180
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,649
What you, you dare to sit on me?
On top of Kali!

181
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,779
I'll rip your limbs
off and hand it to you!

182
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,056
Hey go and get Daanamma.

183
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,625
Let go of my Sari you bitch!

184
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,332
Oh wow!

185
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,163
Look at them man.
My heart is racing bro.

186
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,495
Stop the cycle, leis look at...

187
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,253
Daanamma sister!

188
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,621
Look here, Kaali and Rudri

189
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,150
are fighting and stripping each other.
You pleases come and stop them!

190
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:57,820
Okay, let go.

191
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,429
Yes go! Its like when a jobless
man sit around spanking arse.

192
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,626
That is what they are doing.

193
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,706
Who the hell is that?

194
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,773
What are you staring at,
like a kid looking at candy?

195
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,779
Don't you have sisters
or mothers at home?

196
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,486
No its just our cycle chain...
- Damn you...!

197
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,314
Cover your asses and get lost.

198
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:25,684
Look how she is shouting!

199
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,657
What were we staring at her?
- Shut up and come.

200
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:31,252
If I ever see you here again,
I'll spank you buttocks red!

201
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,699
Move aside... these crazy women...!

202
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,205
Hey, let go of her! Let go!

203
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,368
Let go I say!
- What, let go of her?

204
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,100
Let go. Hey Kali!

205
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,543
Let go of me sister,
I'll teach her some manners!

206
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,171
Hey, I'll smack you now!

207
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,340
Hey let go of the sari.
- Come, come you wretched!

208
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,816
What are you looking at? Pull her away.

209
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,711
Hey stand here quietly!

210
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,120
Look at her!

211
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,180
Even you keep quite!

212
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,388
Nagi, get me some water.

213
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,427
What is your problem?
- Raging like mad bulls!

214
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,661
Daanamma!

215
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,340
Take it, drink some
water you shameless girl.

216
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,476
Listen, what is inside our sari
must remain hidden.

217
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,482
Can we show and talk about it in public?

218
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,519
Look at this,
she keeps trying to disrobe me!

219
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,713
Crazy bitch!

220
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,085
What then? She says mine is
different from her's.

221
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,180
Come you, let me see how it is so!

222
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,317
Yes, you come if you dare!
- Hey, go! Go over there!

223
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,191
You're a crazy bitch,
you entire family is bonkers!

224
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,093
Look at how you sari is,
go and drape it properly!

225
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,324
Go Now!

226
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,798
Hey you, you escaped because
Daanamma came here.

227
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,057
Otherwise I would have read
you your last rites.

228
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,508
Brother please be gentle.

229
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,175
The pain is killing me!

230
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,246
Its almost done,
Just bear with me a bit longer.

231
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:03,747
I gave way!

232
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,451
Mother, our goddess Kirgooravva
has removed your daughter's pain.

233
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,289
Is her sprain completely gone?

234
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,454
Can she walk now?

235
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,621
Yes mother, most definitely!

236
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,755
Please hold this.

237
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,560
Once Karia touches her,
not only can she walk,

238
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,262
She can skip all the
way back to your village.

239
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,268
Thank god you can stand up straight.

240
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,108
Oh no! How can I, please no!

241
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,269
Our goddess Kiragooravva has blessed
their family so that they can help people...

242
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,247
It'll will be a mistake
if he takes money for that.

243
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,749
Then, don't we need to give anything?

244
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,247
Oh no, nothing!
- Okay then!

245
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:42,325
“In a lake of milk,
let your procession go on“

246
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:47,688
“The mother of Kiragoor,
safe guard these children“

247
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:53,126
“The mother of Kiragoor,
safe guard these children“

248
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,807
Don't show your prowess
where it's necessary!

249
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,208
Instead fight like this in your saris.

250
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,718
Oh, you don't know anything.
She is a crazy old mad cow!

251
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,511
See Daanamma, how she has
ripped apart my husband's shirt!

252
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,548
What else, if say something that touches
a raw nerve how can I keep quiet?

253
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,151
Oh, what did I say that was so bad?

254
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,255
How can I not laugh When
she is standing there half-naked?

255
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,096
See, see how she is giggling even now!

256
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:27,168
She yakking that mine is differnet from
your's and saying it is big and small!

257
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,173
Won't that burn a hole in my heart?

258
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,773
Oh god, shut up!

259
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,108
Will it become a sunflower
if she says its big,

260
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,077
or a jasmine if she said it is small?

261
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,706
And you were fighting over this,
damn you both!

262
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,449
That is it!

263
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,766
You won't understand all this!

264
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,507
We can see everything!

265
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,705
Who caused all of this?

266
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,450
Demons...!?

267
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:22,117
Every demon in this country
has come to your village!

268
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,690
Look, if someone
gives you any trouble...

269
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,328
I'll make their limbs useless.
- Okay sir!

270
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,769
Do you understand?
- Okay!

271
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:40,273
Take this ash. As long as I am their
no demons can even come near you!

272
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,711
Go on I am there!
- Okay, let go and do as he says.

273
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,617
Radio: 'Our society is plagued
by superstitions and caste'

274
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,484
Sir, this two hundred
and ten rupees and fifty cents.

275
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,723
Sir... this week business
hasn't been that great.

276
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,162
Is it!
- Do some puja to benefit me.

277
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,722
Oh, Arrack!

278
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,566
Will doing puja and
prayer solve these problems?

279
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:12,439
Look, when people are worried they will
drink a lot more than when they are happy.

280
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,378
That is why,
we should always make them worry.

281
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,073
What true word you spoke!

282
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,451
Okay then, I will get going.

283
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,548
“Who are you? Where did you come from,
which village?“

284
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,121
Hey Kala,
drink in small portion will you!

285
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,024
Shut you pie hole!

286
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:39,604
To drink in small portions like you,
do I have kids or children...!

287
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,731
Kala brother, will everyone have
kids as soon as they get married?

288
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,435
You must be patient.

289
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,771
Shut it!

290
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,772
Four years...

291
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,245
Its been four years!

292
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:57,114
All of these guys got
me married to that barren cow.

293
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,289
KaalaPPa
Yes! H

294
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,183
let me say something.

295
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:09,428
Don't we all considered this Byrappa's
son Raj as our own? - Yes, yes!

296
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,127
Do the same and don't worry!

297
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,035
Look Kaalappa...

298
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,133
aren't my kids are like your kids?

299
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,077
Weren't they born and grown
in front of your own eyes?

300
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,175
Have they ever considered
you a stranger?

301
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,214
Till you have your own,
consider them as your kids.

302
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,081
What do you guys $33!?

303
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,122
We should see everything
with a pure heart, Kaalappa!

304
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,052
Okay then, I will agree!

305
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,453
All your kids are mine as well!

306
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:45,502
But... don't I deserve
a child of my own?

307
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,700
<i>Kama, don'! you worry.</i>

308
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,733
We will find some medicine
to cure your problem.

309
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,007
Who will you get medicine for?
What will you get medicine for?!

310
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,482
I will wait for a few more days,
that's it!

311
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,485
Then, I will get married a second time!

312
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,956
A second marriage?!

313
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,723
He)!' keep quite!

314
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,089
If only your wife hears of this...!

315
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,057
Damn, you killed my buzz!

316
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,261
If they women hear you say this,

317
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,998
they will grate you brains out
like they grate coconuts

318
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,003
Then what the this
did I get married for?

319
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,507
To satisfy my sexual desires huh?

320
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,736
How are you all to understand the
fire that is burning in my heart.

321
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:36,721
Don't I...
deserve a child to play in my arms?

322
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,651
Doesn't Kaale Gowda's
family deserve to grow.

323
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,155
Oh see this!
A drunkard putting a child to sleep.

324
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:47,631
What is the news?

325
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:51,224
You were all that was missing! Come sit
- Why do you say so?

326
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,000
You come only to collect
the money by closing time.

327
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,570
You said you'll bring
a market place to your village,

328
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,239
and that you will give
a request to the government.

329
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,279
What have you accomplished, huh?

330
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,018
You are a big cheat!

331
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,156
Yes, yes you are right. he is a cheat.

332
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,426
Hey, stop talking nonsense and shut up!

333
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,429
Okay... Who am I?

334
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,357
Who am I, Who do you think I am?

335
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,099
Bar owner, Shankarappa.

336
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,498
Hey, not that you fool! What is my job?

337
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,202
That is it! You and that sorcerer
get us drunk and take our money!

338
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,371
You are the money-grubbing
village welfare correspondent.

339
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,812
I'll kick you head of you son of a...

340
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,712
The government hasn't
appointed me to grub money.

341
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,045
It is to serve you all!

342
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,547
The government has asked me to bear
the responsibility of a dozen villages.

343
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,527
Without me, there is no connection
to the government and these villages.

344
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm the link between the
government and these villages.

345
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:59,662
Hey you Kaalappa, why do you keep shouting
'Weekly Market' over and over again?

346
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:05,140
We can't even count the
number of villages in this state.

347
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:09,305
All of them have applied
for a market place.

348
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,642
The government has
promised to sanction it.

349
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,377
You must wait patiently.

350
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,711
Instead, you all drink and
talk whatever rubbish you want.

351
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:23,124
Hey... How many crates did
you order today? - Brother? Three!

352
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,762
Patience, patience, patience!

353
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,798
Everywhere its the same thing.

354
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,306
Hey what the hell!

355
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,769
She comes in the night
like a ghost to scare me.

356
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,782
She won't even let me sleep peacefully!

357
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,785
She strokes my face, bloody hell!

358
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,784
Look Nagi,
it no use doing it over and over again!

359
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,326
Haven't your parents
thought you anything?

360
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,095
How many times do we need to sow?

361
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,658
If the land is fertile,
once is more than enough!

362
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,536
If it is not,
then every time it'll be the same!

363
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,210
Do I like hurting you?

364
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,377
What can I do if you are barren!

365
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,677
What else can you call an
infertile cow other than infertile.

366
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,750
Now, don't you want to see a
child playing around this house?

367
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,687
Is it wrong if I wish for that?

368
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:39,696
That's why I said it,
do something and convince your parents!

369
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,084
First go and talk to your friends.

370
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,619
This it, this is not Kaale Gowdas fault,
its all on me.

371
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,317
Convince them that
there is nothing wrong

372
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,259
in getting married a
second time for having kids.

373
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,263
You will also feel better and a
child will finally grace this house.

374
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,761
Sweetheart, how much longer can I
only see you once a week in the market?

375
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,638
Do as I told you.

376
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:02,713
Gowda, let me see you catch me. Take
you walking stick and come behind me.

377
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,740
If you run like this I'll
grow old by the time I catch you.

378
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,382
You are my sweetheart, stop!

379
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:15,454
My sweet butternut, please stop!

380
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,426
How much ever you butter me up,
its final!

381
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,221
You like the city, right?

382
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,997
That's why I say...
be brave. Leis elope!

383
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:26,461
Now, if we run away
to Mysore or Bengaluru...

384
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,199
No one will be able to find us,
you know?

385
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:32,432
There I'll set up a flowers shop
for you and find work somewhere.

386
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,741
After a couple of years,
once we have had kids,

387
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,372
we will visit our
village once every year.

388
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:43,013
Please be generous,
I can't live without you sweetheart.

389
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,088
Why do you keep talking this nonsense?

390
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,057
You always keep asking to elope.
- Bhagya...!

391
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,060
What mistake did I say now?

392
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,691
How many time to tell you
that I'm not the kind to elope?

393
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:59,660
If do that, my mother will
jump into some well or tank.

394
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,266
You keep pestering me,
but when she can't live with you.

395
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,207
Why is she still tormenting you?

396
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,075
What is her problem in accepting
you getting married again?

397
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,025
What are you searching for?

398
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,423
Its nothing.
I'll try to convince her somehow.

399
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:29,432
Somehow convince her before
the next marriage season.

400
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:33,560
Otherwise my mother will
get me married to someone else.

401
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:37,069
Don't say that, my heart will burst!

402
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,008
Let me go. I won't listen to anything.
- Listen to me first.

403
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,310
Sit down.

404
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,471
How can I bear such harsh words?

405
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:49,084
I was lucky that I got you, or else I
would have drunk some poison and died!

406
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,382
Oh, don't say that now!

407
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,147
Can I say something?
- Yes...

408
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:58,355
I liked you a lot the first
time I saw you in the market.

409
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,789
You are the only one who
in the market wearing black suit.

410
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,705
Only then I came to know that you are
married, and your wife is not well.

411
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:11,998
What is it?

412
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,505
What can I do?

413
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:17,537
I was a naive young man. They forced me
to marry that beast of a woman.

414
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,208
You keep touching me.

415
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,219
Hey, what is this?

416
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:26,312
It feel soothing,
my heart feel so happy!

417
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,390
When you touch it, it goes ring-ring.

418
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,574
Naagi... Hey Naagi!

419
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,211
Why are you sitting there like that?

420
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,308
Her head is haunted, with the
thought of not having had a child.

421
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,443
Talk some sense into her.

422
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,279
How many years has it
been since you got married?

423
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,088
Just 4 years, isn't it!

424
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:02,618
My sister-in-law hadn't
conceived even after 8 years.

425
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:05,722
Now she has had 2 beautiful children.

426
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,162
You both tell me.

427
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,530
If she keeps such a dull look,
which man will want to come near her?

428
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,536
Tell her that again. Her husband, that
Kaalegowda is also always the same way.

429
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,435
Even my husband was acting like this.

430
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,972
I taught him a lesson just few days ago.

431
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,272
What did you do sister?

432
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,548
Do you know what happened?

433
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,445
What happened sister?

434
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,981
Hey Subba!

435
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,427
In the early days you used to butter
me up for sex every now and then...!

436
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,290
Now what happened?

437
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:48,528
That is how it is when it's new.
If we do it daily it feels laborious.

438
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:54,068
It is only when we do it once
in a while, it gives us pleasure.

439
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,242
It's getting late just go to sleep.

440
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:05,452
So, you feel loving me is laborious.

441
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:09,024
Then leave it.

442
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,353
I'll call someone,
'Please somebody come...

443
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:18,228
My Lord Subbayya,
feels it laborious to love me...

444
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,965
Will the gods be pleased
if I work my lord?

445
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,698
Somebody come and do this work please!'

446
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,665
What did you say?

447
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:31,708
Then what happened?
What did Subbayya do?

448
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,215
What did Subbayya do?

449
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:39,322
He said you are might even
do what you say and fell at my feet.

450
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,685
Then he said I'll do
it whenever you ask Daani.

451
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:54,170
Daanamma sister,
then what happened that night?

452
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:58,538
Ah, as if I need to explain
everything to you, you know better.

453
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,612
Shut up and come out of the water.
- How much longer will you bathe?

454
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:10,283
Look how beautiful our Nagi
looks when she smiles. - Nagamma...

455
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,553
That is it! Men are like children.

456
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,690
They cry if the want
something and if they don't.

457
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,421
We should make plans
to go through it all.

458
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,096
Do you understand?

459
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,471
What Subbayya,
don't we have families to feed?

460
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,498
You are still talking
about these ancient wages!

461
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:36,271
What are you saying Karia, you
are demanding wages as you please?

462
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,550
Okay then!
We will just take whatever you please

463
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,448
and work for you for the
rest of our miserable lives.

464
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,550
Will you be happy then?

465
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:46,351
What Karia,
you are you such big-big words?

466
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,358
You will please keep you mouth shut!

467
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,092
Subbayya, the 3 of us
have to share what you give us.

468
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,730
Please talk straight will you.

469
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,596
Don't saying anything else...
- Hey!

470
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,135
If you talks keep escalating,
will the work get done?

471
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,697
Look, I'll give a fair judgment.
Just agree upon it.

472
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,764
Okay then, tell us what it is?

473
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,778
Now you have to fell the
tree and chop it into pieces.

474
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,442
For that you take 1
and a half-quintal of Ragi.

475
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:15,077
Hey, we are asking for three quintals.
- How is this fair?

476
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,484
Why are you acting like this Karia,
let him finish!

477
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,518
Hey don't be hasty, listen to me first.

478
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:24,217
One and a half quinial
of ragi and 20 additional.

479
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:29,464
On top of that we will pay for 2 days
at the arrack shop, what Subbha?

480
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:30,398
Okay.

481
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,595
Okay than, what else can we do?

482
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,366
Who else will do this other than us?
We will start chopping from tomorrow.

483
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,207
Tell him that. Yes, yes!
Hey let it go, just get to work.

484
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,411
You keep doing this.
Hey why do you say that?

485
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,434
TO hell With this!

486
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,199
How did this tree fall down?

487
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:15,337
Its must roots must have been shaken out
in that crazy wind that blew the other day.

488
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,677
Couldn't it have stood for another day?

489
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,376
Its for the best.
Now we don't have dig out the roots.

490
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:24,654
If those Gowdas learn of it,
they'll a part cut of our wages.

491
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,021
Hey shut up, why will they do that?

492
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,559
Why will we not?

493
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,319
I came and checked it
out in the morning itself.

494
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,426
Since you no longer
have to fell the tree,

495
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:44,269
leis go back to my offer of 1 quintal,
don't argue about it.

496
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,535
Hey Subbayya...
- Maaranna, don't say anything.

497
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,079
If you agree, then start working.

498
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,614
We came just close before losing out,
Maaranna.

499
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,154
Hey... Karia!

500
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,430
What can anyone do if this is our fate?

501
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,233
Get down, we have to start working.

502
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:19,302
What kind of man are you,
offering just 1 quintal.

503
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,057
Hey Karia, hold it loosely.

504
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,618
Hey, how can a let
loose the saw is stuck.

505
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,528
Is the saw stuck.
- What else?

506
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,534
Push, push it hard and set it free.

507
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,398
It won't budge. Hold on.

508
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,201
Now pull it out, pull it!

509
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,584
Maaranna, look at this.

510
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,578
My saw... it broke of Maaranna!

511
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:10,258
Is this tree possessed?
My saw broke of in my hands.

512
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,533
Look at them,
they have broken up my saw.

513
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:25,298
Oh to hell with you,
you good for nothing bloody fool.

514
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:28,307
Instead of breaking useful
tools why don't just get lost.

515
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:33,349
What, did we break it deliberately.
It broke, why are you shouting?

516
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,249
It wouldn't if you knew
how to use it properly.

517
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,446
Yes, look at him standing there!

518
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,749
Shut you mouth dear!

519
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:40,782
Look at how much ego you have!

520
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,252
Hey Karia!

521
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:45,019
What are you saying, mind you tongue!

522
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,554
Has he ever seen us show our ego,
you wretched man!

523
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,396
They broke my saw and
now they are calling us names.

524
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,230
Come you bloody Karia,

525
00:34:55,294 --> 00:35:00,368
if you don't bring back my saw the
way it was I'll scratch your face off!

526
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:05,208
You worthless bugger, came here
to chop a tree... - Get going you...

527
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,984
Bloody bugger,
bring back my saw the way it was.

528
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,315
Why do you waste your
breath with these fools?

529
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:13,084
That was a saw I brought as dowry.

530
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:18,127
He has broken it and he is
calling me names. - Get, go, go on.

531
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,527
I'll take care of him,
you come home you bugger.

532
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:34,033
Hey Maaranna...
they are quite the women.

533
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,514
The ego is bubbling out of their veins.

534
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,210
All because of this
Daanamma's influence.

535
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,514
It has become a village of rowdy women.

536
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:50,050
This government's torture
is become unbearable Shankrappa.

537
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,319
They are asking me to show them a
organic farm, what will I show them?

538
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,797
This field-day is becoming
a big pain in the neck.

539
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:00,135
I had even made arrangements
with Siddha to show his land.

540
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:04,800
First he had agreed, but then he absolutely
refuse to me putting a board in his land.

541
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:08,637
You had said there is a land
belonging to someone named Maara, right?

542
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,244
Yes but it is very small,
they are asking for an acre of land.

543
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,375
Okay, but tell me
who has land next to his.

544
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:16,653
That land, it belongs to Kaale Gowda.

545
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:26,192
Hey Shankarappa... till the officials
visit, plant a board in Maara's land.

546
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:35,329
When they do come,
tell then its all one organic farmland.

547
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:38,102
Then just throw that board away.

548
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,440
Wow, that is the best idea. I'll do it.

549
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,679
Don't tell Maara anything about this.

550
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:51,552
Oh no, I won't! Once its over I'll just
get them a couple of drinks on the house.

551
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:09,172
Oh no, this filthy rotten thing.

552
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:14,069
Someone has planted a board in my field.
Which son of a gun put it here?

553
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,471
Who was it, if I get my hands
on you I'll break all your limbs.

554
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,311
Curse your wretched family. damn you!

555
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,714
Did you only find my fields?

556
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,447
Hey, hey Maara. Its mine...

557
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,558
Its mine, why did you... damn...!

558
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:33,062
Hey why is Maaranna shouting like that?
Come leis take a look.

559
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:37,032
Its my board, why are you stomping
on it? So this is your doing?

560
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,469
What have I done to you?
Why did you put it on my land? Why?

561
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,032
What is your problem
with this board being there?

562
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,177
In a weeks time I'll
get you 100 rupees subsidy.

563
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,040
Listen to me Shankarappa!

564
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,647
Don't try to entice me with your words!

565
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:57,448
Today you put a board here, tomorrow if the
bank or government come and seize my land...

566
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,183
Then what will I eat or earn.
Just get the hell out.

567
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,552
Hey, give that here.
- Take it!

568
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:07,255
Adjust a little bit, protect my dignity.

569
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,162
Should I give my life
to protect your dignity?

570
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,632
I have seen your kind before!

571
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,134
Its not like that Maara, listen...

572
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,398
I will never let you plant
this board here, that's final!

573
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:20,432
Hey listen, higher officials are coming.
Just adjust a bit.

574
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,742
That is you plan, higher officials
will come and seize this small land

575
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,313
given to my father by Kaalappa's father.

576
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:32,521
I'm putting this here to benefit all
of you. These are government policies.

577
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:34,615
You should become
beneficiaries of those schemes.

578
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:37,159
Hey, when he is refusing
why are you compelling him?

579
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,991
Keep quite, don't interfere.

580
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:42,191
You are new to our village, but have
take complete control of everyone here.

581
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,699
We men are talking here.

582
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,230
Hey Maara, what are you doing
here instead of chopping the tree?

583
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,668
Go, we'll take care of this.

584
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:50,673
But that board...
I told you go right? Go!

585
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,133
Okay, I'll go. Now talk to them.

586
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:57,374
Hey what is that you were saying?
Say it again! - Hey wait!

587
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:02,051
Hey you, first you remove
those dirty glasses and then talk.

588
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:02,608
Why?

589
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:09,055
I have been observing, we can never know
where you are staring at us when you talk.

590
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,993
Hey! What is this, you spew
whatever nonsense you feel like!

591
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,021
These are glasses Modi doctor
gave me after an eye operation.

592
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:18,098
What operation was that?
Your stare is still not good.

593
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,196
Hey, what are you saying? I am a
welfare correspondent for 10 villages.

594
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:26,308
Day and night I always think of your
welfare and you are talking ill of me!

595
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,675
Then what is this? - Its organic
farming board. Government project.

596
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,680
All I want is to fix it here,
but you are acting like this.

597
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,642
Just cause its a government board,
can you fix it anywhere?

598
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,515
Kaalamma, Durgamma, please get back!
- Please... Ah!

599
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:44,025
Sister...
what this man fell just by our touch.

600
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,653
Let him fall, that is all he knows.
Come let's go.

601
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:58,668
Hey, come on Durgi. How long will you
look at him in that dead frog pose!

602
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:13,088
What are you staring at?
Go and get some butter.

603
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,060
Hey are you done?

604
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,122
Wait, its not coming out!

605
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,393
Hey look, its a butterfly!

606
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:38,606
Hey its a police jeep, run every one!
Hey wait for me! Run, run.

607
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,210
Hey you guys run faster!

00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,571
Hey, don't leave me behind!

615
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:06,199
Hey Subba! Where is he gone?

616
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,277
Hey Subba, come son. Come fast!

00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:25,461
Daani, don't lock the door!

625
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:26,687
Daani, I beg you. Let me go!

626
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:28,595
Get up, get up I say!

627
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,631
Let me go Daani, the police are coming.
- What wrong have you done?

628
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,696
Have you cheat or killed someone,

629
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,763
We will only now their intention
after we are in their custody!

630
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:37,699
Shut the hell up!

631
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:43,204
Let the police come and touch you,
I'll skin them alive!

632
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,246
What to they think of us?

633
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,214
Are we that worthless,

634
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:04,189
Police jeep is coming, Run!

635

Daani come here.

637
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,379
You dog faced fool,
when did you come and hide here.

638
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,621
Damn you, is this how a man behaves?

639
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,213
How can you hide like
this in the grainery?

640
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,589
Lower your voice a bit!
- Why the hell should I lower my voice?

641
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,788
To hell with you,
first come out of there!

642
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:55,175
Have I done something wrong,
to close the doors?

643
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:58,720
Shut up, I'll go out
and see what they'll do.

644
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:02,488
Sir, not a single man is out here.

645
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,335
Had we gone to steal their property?

646
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:15,501
Daanamma! Daani!

647
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,368
I will see what the hell will happen.

648
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,306
Are you sure this is the village?

649
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,243
Yes sir, this is it.

650
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,550
You fellows don't make a proper study.

651
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,015
Go and enquire with her.

652
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,500
Hello.

653
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,031
Is there nobody at home to talk to?

654
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:52,769
Who the hell do you want?

655
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:02,677
Its no like that, as today is the field day.
Please come here and talk to our sir.

656
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,415
Why the hell should I come and talk?
and who the hell is your sir?

657
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,285
My sir is inside.

658
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,554
Shut up and get lost!

659
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:14,529
Look, its an official matter.
Its not what you are thinking!

660
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:18,395
I don't care,
you are taking Kiragoor very lightly!

661
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:23,497
Just shut up and get going.
Otherwise I'll show you...

662
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:24,502
You talk to her my son.

663
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:28,568
This is my last warning,
can't you understand. Go!

664
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,309
What are you looking at?
Get going already!

665
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,441
Oh god, start the jeep I say!

666
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:37,246
Yes get back in you vehicle, go!
Hey get the jeep going brother!

667
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,311
All of this villagers
are uncivilised people.

668
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,581
And illiterates!

669
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:47,426
If you step here again,
I'll break you legs. Bloody Buggers!

670
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:52,261
Talk to our sir he says,
flighty buggers!

671
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,264
This is the first time in my career!

672
00:44:55,493 --> 00:45:01,535
She... was showing me that... what
is that? What do you call that thing?

673
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,477
Wet flour stick.
- Wet flour stick she is showing me!

674
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,675
Bloody cheats! They weren't
even wearing police uniforms.

675
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,049
Hey Subba!
Come outside, the jeep is gone!

676
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,213
Go and bring father back.

677
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:16,321
I'm talking to you,
the jeep is gone come out.

678
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,491
Wait, I'll take care of you.

679
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:25,729
I keep shouting, you are acting deaf?
Hey get the hell out!

680
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,531
Just listen.
- What is it?

681
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:35,238
Once you went outside,
I got really scared and I wet myself.

682
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:40,043
Oh my Subbayya! My Lord

683
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:43,119
Why are you so afraid
of a wrong you haven't done?

684
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:48,782
I'll get you a fresh pair of shorts,
please go and find your father.

685
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,493
Okay.
- My sweet lord Subbayya!

686
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,720
This is highly irregular behavior I say!

687
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:00,092
But insulted us at the hands of a woman.

688
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,760
I'll complaint against him!

689
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:03,165
Showing wet flour stick.

690
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:04,807
Sir, that fellow is coming sir.

691
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,167
Hey stop, stop the jeep.
- Stop the jeep man!

692
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:10,008
Our department person is coming,
stop the vehicle.

693
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:12,538
Stop the vehicle.
- Go and question him.

694
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,176
Go fat, go!

695
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,277
Hey you weren't there at the village,
where the hell did you go?

696
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:21,152
Put him in his proper place, bloody idiot!
Throw your garland in the garbage!

697
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:25,119
Don't deny it sir, please accept sir.
This one time please!

698
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,254
This is our tradition, please!

699
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,198
What do you think of me? You said
they would welcome me with garland...

700
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,335
But do you know what happened?

701
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:38,636
But sir I was waiting for you near the gate,
and you are coming from the rear entrance.

702
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:48,181
Some... ungrateful women,
she was bad-mouthing me.

703
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,451
Using all kinds of foul language.
Who does she think I am?

704
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,517
What was she showing me?
- Sir, Wet flour stick!

705
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:58,654
Wet flour stick,
she is showing me a wet flour stick!

706
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:02,027
No sir, I have made special
arrangements for you...

707
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,465
What special...? I will report this.

708
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,532
You will be thrown out of service.

709
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:10,161
I'll get you dismissed
and make you sit at home.

710
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:13,266
Oh no, sir I beg of you sir, please!

711
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:18,471
Its not my fault sir, we had selected a
Dalit's land for the organic farming project.

712
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,676
But the Gowdas in the village
didn't let us do anything.

713
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,350
Not only that,
because I tried to help... see.

714
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:28,722
See here how they beat me up, see.
Look at my legs.

715
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:34,188
I'm really sorry, please don't
abandon me. Don't dismiss me please sir!

716
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:40,999
Atrocity and assault, section 324.

717
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,040
Read with 3 clause 1- Atrocity
and assault case.

718
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:47,133
Get up, I say, get up.
- Stand up.

719
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:52,538
You file a criminal
case against that lady.

720
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,651
Also file a case on that Gowdas.

721
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,543
And also that wet flour stick
that was in that lady's hand.

722
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,553
Did you understand?
- Come let's leave.

723
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:04,556
Start the jeep brother.

724
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:06,728
Please visit again.

725
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,031
I will never forget this.

726
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:13,458
In my career I have never seen...
- Wet flour stick sir!

727
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:14,469
Get lost.

728
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,004
Take this garland back.
Go and file the complaint first.

729
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:22,477
I have never seen such a thing...
hey what is that - Wet flour stick sir!

730
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:24,013
Hey forget that thing.

731
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:31,516
How many officers like you I have seen.
Hey go to hell.

732
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,725
Hey why are you so scared,
I'm here right?

733
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,359
Sit down uncle and first calm down.

734
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,464
I'm a bloody fool.

735
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:51,530
In my hurry I have got my
wife's skirt instead of my shirt.

736
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,203
Hey shut your monkey business.
its already noon.

737
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:59,471
We don't know what
happened in the village.

738
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:01,740
Hey, someone go and take a look.

739
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:04,646
Oh yeah why not,
so that they can take us to bang up.

740
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:07,250
Oh, I am telling these coward buggers.

741
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,249
Kaalappa...
- Yes.

742
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:13,690
You are the only one who goes to market.

743
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,489
Have you done some petty cheating
there that the jeep has come.

744
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:19,191
I'll kick you head off,
if you put this on me!

745
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,227
Take back your words.

746
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:26,540
I'm a businessman,
I'll never commit such mistakes. Okay!

747
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,502
Dad...!

748
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:29,677
Hey come leis run.

749
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:30,508
Maaranna!

750
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:32,240
He is calling my name, who is it?

751
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,614
Hey... it's our Subba.

752
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,454
The police jeep is gone, come back now.

753
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:46,654
Hey Subba,
didn't you run away with us you bugger?

754
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:49,089
Ah, look and him prancing here now!

755
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,558
Hey, I didn't run away.

756
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:56,699
Daani didn't let me.
She scared and sent the jeep away!

757
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,535
Is it so?
- Really?

758
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:04,068
Really! She said you must
leave right now and they left.

759
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:06,306
Are they really gone?

760
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,310
See the power of my daughter-in-law!

761
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:15,290
Hey keep quite sir, first enquire
how a police jeep came to our village.

762
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:20,260
That is what I been trying to tell you,
that was the Tasildar's jeep.

763
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,495
Without waiting to think
you all ran helter-skelter.

764
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,731
What can I do, is that my fault?

765
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:31,296
Hey Shankarappa,
if you had done something bad?

766
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,773
We would have boiled
your head in hot water.

767
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:37,605
Hey he just petty welfare servant, where
does he have that much guts. Shut up and go!

768
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:50,058
Why are you tensed
for just this Shankarappa?

769
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:56,456
How many village I have been to
and experienced all the cultures!

770
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:02,731
Just to control 18 villages
I have left my family and roam...

771
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:04,568
But these are cheap buggers sir.

772
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:09,635
That Karia, he used to wag his tail
pet dog now he is barking at me.

773
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,275
He says he will break open my head!

774
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:19,247
That is why Shankarappa...
I say demons must exist.

775
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:24,253
If demons exist, people and
society will be in their limits.

776
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:30,728
If there are no demons people
will nail the gods to the walls.

777
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:40,237
Look, you pit this caste against that
one and that one against this one.

778
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,079
Then you will see the fun.

779
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,752
Do you think its okay to
do caste politics in the village?

780
00:51:57,816 --> 00:52:00,729
Oh, why do you ask that Shankara...?

781
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:06,598
You haven't learned
the sensitivity of duty.

782
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:11,496
If Lord Krishna in the Bhagwadgeeta...

783
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:15,533
the one who plans and
executes everything...

784
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,773
had advised Arjuna not to fight and

785
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:26,216
take part in the war,
instead go home and sleep...

786
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:29,289
would it have been as good?

787
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:31,556
No.

788
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:35,359
If that had indeed happened...

789
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:41,499
Mahabharata wouldn't have happened,
and this country wouldn't have existed!

790
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:45,336
Fighting is sustenance for demons.

791
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,667
What is it?
- Food, sustenance.

792
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:52,304
You do what the Tasildar told you.

793
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:56,276
Give a complaint to the police,
they too are like us.

794
00:52:56,708 --> 00:53:00,155
They know well that demons need
to exist, so that they can survive.

795
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:05,253
You go with a single
agenda and call upon Narayana!

796
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,490
Sir, should I really call upon him?

797
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:13,032
When I am with you, why do you worry?
Just call him!

798
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:18,736
It doesn't have any strength at all.

799
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:24,044
Will anyone say this a compliant, you
should write it with more of an punch.

800
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,444
As soon as he sees it,

801
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:30,146
you inspector should say 'Go and drag their
asses her immediately' write it again.

802
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,516
Now that the ink has fallen,
see how the words will flow.

803
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,458
Yeah, leis see.

804
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:43,389
We are scared stiff of police stations,
go Narayana we won't come.

805
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:49,598
Oh no, our sir said if it was something
serious I would order you to round them up.

806
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,573
Its nothing important,
so just go and ask them politely.

807
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,770
He just wants to take
a statement from you.

808
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,306
That may be Narayana,
but we haven't taken loans from anyone.

809
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,816
Why are you calling us for no reason?

810
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,082
How do I make you understand?

811
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,680
It's respectable to go when
he calls you. I'll tell you one thing...

812
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:11,225
You are making mountains
out of molehills.

813
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:15,486
Why this discussion, if you don't
trust me then I'll shut up and leave...

814
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,157
Yes, that is what they are saying...

815
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,997
Why are you tormenting them?
They won't come, get lost!

816
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:24,132
To come as soon as you call,
are our men those...?

817
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:27,070
Hey, why are you nagging him?

818
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,174
What do you know about our Narayana.

819
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,009
If we go with him,
will he let any harm come to us.

820
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:34,012
What Narayana?

821
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,017
What golden word you spoke Byrappa!

822
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:41,353
Inspector will be here today
and somewhere else tomorrow.

823
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:45,391
It is we who will see
each other everyday, right?

824
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,793
Why go that far?
If in the station any one of you...

825
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:55,202
feel even a pinch or a scratch,
you can call me a bastard from now on.

826
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,570
See...

827
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,702
Hey, what are you saying Narayana?

828
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,473
What more assurance
can I give you Daanamma?

829
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:04,808
Okay...!

830
00:55:05,203 --> 00:55:08,309
You must bring them back safe and sound,

831
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,482
or else you'll have to answer to me.

832
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:13,519
Daanamma, you are new to this village.

833
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:18,084
This Narayana has never abandoned
those who trust him, what?

834
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:21,386
Till they get ready to leave,
kindly make me a cup of coffee.

835
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,030
Trust me, I'm there!

836
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:44,344
Come quickly.

837
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,317
Sir.
- Yes!

838
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,289
I have rounded up those
Kiragoor rascals, sir!

839
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,397
Kick them into the cell!

840
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:58,165
All their worthless stupid assess.

841
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:03,265
<i>Go on. Hey gel 90TH?-!</i>

842
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:07,676
Oh he come here wearing a suit,
strip all of you morons.

843
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,621
Hello.

844
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,229
Really...?

845
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:43,176
Hey Narayana, come!

846
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:44,338
Yes sir, I'm coming.

847
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,083
Which case?

848
00:56:57,148 --> 00:57:00,652
I don't know,
that Narayana ahs brought them.

849
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:02,656
Is it worth something?

850
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,360
I don't think its something big.

851
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,592
Must be some petty case.

852
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,170
How much longer do you
want to stand like this?

853
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,706
Go on sit, come.

854
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:37,024
This was all that was left,
now we seen this as well.

855
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:43,334
Hey, are all your noses blocked shut?

856
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:47,198
Its stinking... damned urine pit!

857
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,500
Were you expecting a palace?

858
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,706
That it won't stink, huh?

859
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:59,514
You have to do everything here itself.

860
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:05,651
Who might you be?

861
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:10,055
No, I was wondering why you were here?

862
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:16,727
Me...?

863
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:23,340
You are asking why
I have come here, are you?

864
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:29,250
There was a man Range Gowda,
in Doddekoppla village!

865
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,119
Do any of you know him?

866
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,990
He was eyeing my wife.

867
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:45,265
Bloody hell, I took a big
stone and dropped it on his head!

868
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,562
They won't even let us eat in peace.

869
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,298
The skull cracked open.

870
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,306
I collected it with
these very two hands!

871
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:00,145
And came straight to the station.

872
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:06,147
Byra brother... Byra brother!
- Please don't.

873
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:10,517
Murder... Homicide!

874
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:16,226
I'm in here for homicide!

875
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,231
And you are asking why I'm in here?

876
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,495
Why are you shouting?
Have we tortured you yet?

877
00:59:26,197 --> 00:59:29,110
When we heard what he has did,
we got terrified.

878
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,076
What has he done?

879
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:33,248
Murder...
he has committed a murder, sir!

880
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,283
What... murder?!

881
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:38,681
Is that what you told them?

882
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:44,115
He went to Rangegowda's house to steal.

883
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,255
Hey let it go no sir.

884
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:48,661
But the women of that house
caught him and handed him to us.

885
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,425
Is this a face of a murderer?

886
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,259
Sit silently, don't pester us!

887
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,604
Where the hell did he bring them from?

888
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:18,788
You bluffed so much, how come?

889
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:26,701
Brother, it is because.
Who respects thieves?

890
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,294
But when you say murderer, what respect?

891
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:39,614
Now, in my house, the streets, why even in
the station and courts nobody respects me.

892
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,710
But when I say I'm a murderer,
what respect?

893
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:47,581
A thief never gets the respect
that is given to a murderer!

894
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:51,089
Now look at yourself.
Once you came to know I'm a thief...

895
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,821
how easily you talking down to me.

896
01:00:53,684 --> 01:01:00,294
But if I was a murderer, would you
dare to face me when you talked to me?

897
01:01:00,558 --> 01:01:03,732
Oh, forget about me.
What are you in for?

898
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,608
We don't even know that!

899
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:09,608
Is it so? Then its fixed.

900
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:11,445
Its definitely fixed!

901
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:13,204
What does that mean?

902
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,272
When they don't catch any cases,

903
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:19,082
they bring in someone like you
and fix them as cattle thieves.

904
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,323
That is called fixing!

905
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:30,289
Oh Uncle, we've become cattle thieves!
How will we ever go back home?

906
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:35,626
Uncle, how can I ever show
my face in the market again?

907
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,550
Take the buggers and shove them in!

908
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,652
Okay sir.

909
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,498
Sir, we have dealt
them a proper beating!

910
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:13,542
Very good, go and get some rest.

911
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,142
What should we do with them sir?

912
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:21,310
What is there to do, lock them up.
Let them rot in that urine pit!

913
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:23,744
But there is no more room there!

914
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,586
Why is that?

915
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,620
We locked up four
men in the morning sir!

916
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:34,753
There was one thief in there,
who the hell are these four?

917
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,765
You told us to lock them up sir!

918
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:44,134
Okay do one thing, drag those
four men out here. - Okay sir.

919
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,622
Who are you 9113/5?

920
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:07,051
What is your case?

921
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:16,102
Filthy buggers, what is your case?

922
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,639
We swear, we don't know anything sir!

923
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:23,441
Damn you buggers, not even knowing
your case you are standing here.

924
01:03:24,435 --> 01:03:27,109
What do you guy do?
- We are all farmers sir.

925
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:31,447
Farmers? But none
of you look like farmers!

926
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,589
Give me you hands, show it to me!
- Here take this one sir!

927
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,025
How smooth your hands are,
you bloody buggers!

928
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:46,262
Your hands don't look
like those who work in fields.

929
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:53,501
They look like thieves who
steal and pickpockets in markets!

930
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:00,478
Narayana you please tell sir who we are.

931
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:04,484
What is that...?
- Sir, I had told you that day...

932
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,612
Kiragoor, complaint!

933
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,251
Yes sir.
- I remember. Now I remember!

934
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:14,454
You worthless buggers!

935
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,998
Instead of keeping to yourself

936
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:22,128
why the hell do you go about
troubling those Dalits, why?

937
01:04:25,396 --> 01:04:32,575
Look, if you ever go troubling
those Dalit Kulavadi again...

938
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:37,176
I will break you limbs,

939
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:44,523
file an atrocity case
on all of you and lock you up for life!

940
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:53,295
Hey, have you given them the treatment?

941
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:54,335
No sir.

942
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,460
You haven't, then give it here.

943
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:03,743
Once you come here you have
to take treatment and get going.

944
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,411
Sir, there was no mistake on my part...

945
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:09,712
Hey you keep quite!

946
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:10,644
What did you say?

947
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:13,016
Mistake...

948
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:16,421
Mistake, hold you hands out!

949
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:23,153
Hey come here. Come here I say!

950
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:28,302
Give them treatment till they
can't take it anymore. I'll go and rest.

951
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,474
Sige Gowda... Kaalappa!

952
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,580
You have even forgotten your clothes.
Take it please.

953
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:51,125
When our sir told me everything
I couldn't believe it.

954
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:53,122
The Daliis of your village

955
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,222
have given a compliant against you
and betrayed your trust.

956
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:04,595
I have explained to my sir that they are not
those kind of people and got you released.

957
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:06,632
Be careful,
don't interact with them anymore.

958
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:09,007
Narayana sir is calling for you
- I'm coming.

959
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,704
Okay then leave, don't look back.
Get to you village safely.

960
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:02,663
Kaala...
keep calm. Don't cry, keep calm.

961
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:05,325
If you cry even I fell
like crying, stop it.

962
01:07:05,923 --> 01:07:09,336
How can I not cry?
We shouldn't leave it like this, uncle!

963
01:07:09,827 --> 01:07:10,771
Let's call a Panchayat meeting.

964
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:14,667
Let's enquire who gave
the complaint against us and why?

965
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,907
Stop it already, I have had
enough of all of this nonsense.

966
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:21,414
What if during the Panchayat enquiry,

967
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:26,417
someone on our side gets hyper
and hits someone on their side.

968
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,881
Who will be blamed for that?

969
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:32,186
We will have to rot all
our live in that urine pit!

970
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:35,987
Then what else do we do, I can't
bear the insult that has happened to us.

971
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,097
Whom can we share our sufferings with?

972
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:56,147
Mother... Kiragooravva!

973
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:03,315
Karia, Maara and...

974
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,649
Siddha.
- Yes, yes Siddha!

975
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,322
They have given the
complaint against you.

976
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:15,327
You don't talk properly with them,

977
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,668
Don't provide them
with enough drinking water,

978
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:23,672
You don't touch them and constantly
insult them as lower caste

979
01:08:23,734 --> 01:08:26,237
that is what they have
said in their complaint.

980
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:28,675
We?

981
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,082
Are not touching them?

982
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:31,914
<i>Yes my DOV-</i>

983
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:35,347
Hey, we wake up drunk
together in the bar everyday!

984
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,091
Shankarappa you tell him.

985
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:40,055
It is not about drinking
together day and night.

986
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:44,062
They are infuriated that you
are nor paying them proper wages.

987
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,361
Oh what?
- ls this true...? - Really!

988
01:08:45,923 --> 01:08:49,803
Many a times they have discussed this
when you are not there at the bar.

989
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,635
I have heard it myself.

990
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,899
But if I had come and told you this
earlier would you have believed me.

991
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:58,743
Hey, now there is no use talking
about it Shankarappa. - Exactly!

992
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:00,347
This is like a disease...

993
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:02,273
An unwanted disease.

994
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,046
This is not the time
to think how it came to be.

995
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:10,990
You must think about how to cure it.

996
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,725
You must guide us
as to what we should do.

997
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:28,966
If you all agree and write off
30 sq. feet of each of your lands...

998
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,076
I make their tongue rot and fall off!

999
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:35,113
I'll make their limbs useless
and paralayse them permanently.

1000
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,619
No please Swami,
let that never ever happen.

1001
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:44,215
Karia, Maar and Siddha... have grown up
with my sons since they where this big.

1002
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:48,753
Let them never get harmed.
It will curse my kids and grand kids.

1003
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:52,658
Then, what am I supposed to do now?

1004
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,167
We will get you two quintals
of rice and ragi each,

1005
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:58,228
just make it so that the demons that

1006
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,174
have possessed them, never
come our way again, that is enough!

1007
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,908
It can done.
- Sissy little men!

1008
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:10,714
Look, on the name of
my lord the Ugra-Byrava...

1009
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:15,052
Solemnly swear to never repeat a word
that we have spoken in here.

1010
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:17,725
Out there to any other soul.
- Yes, yes do it. It is for the best.

1011
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,762
Hey, you can't even
tell you wife and kids.

1012
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:23,388
If you do your entire
family will be cursed!

1013
01:10:25,856 --> 01:10:29,030
In the name of Lord Byrappa,
we will never tell anyone.

1014
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,867
Maaranna pull it with a bit more force.

1015
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:36,704
But it's struck.
- There goes Kaalappa saw.

1016
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:39,842
Oh damn this tree to hell.

1017
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:41,712
What are we to do now?

1018
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,220
What kind of tree is this?
- I have no idea!

1019
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:52,025
Come leis have a smoke, Siddha...

1020
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,925
chop it up quickly

1021
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:03,102
Oh Kaalappa, he said he
would take you for a few minutes

1022
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,968
but its seems Narayana
kept you all night.

1023
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:08,737
Oh see our plight. ls this a demon tree?

1024
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:12,905
We might loose our love trying to free
this second saw that got struck.

1025
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,607
Demon tree or not...!

1026
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:17,316
We will take out our
saw shut up and get lost!

1027
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,882
What Gowda sir,
what do you mean 'get lost'?

1028
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,854
It means get the hell out of here!

1029
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,990
Yes, we've had enough
of your gratefulness.

1030
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:27,154
Come uncle, boys leis go!

1031
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:29,960
Look at these buggers acting
if they know nothing at all.

1032
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:32,291
But what happened?

1033
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,668
Kaalappa... Hey Kaalappa!

1034
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:39,869
What do they mean by
'our gratefulness' Maaranna?

1035
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,738
Hey, don't you know about them?
They are always hasty bugger.

1036
01:11:45,102 --> 01:11:46,877
That too that Kaalappa
is crazy a bugger.

1037
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,950
We spent three days chopping this wood,
now who will pay us the wages?

1038
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,815
Who else will they find
in this village to cut this tree?

1039
01:11:53,944 --> 01:11:59,895
Come leis finish the work.
We are half way there. Come on!

1040
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:03,030
They have said get lost,
look Maaranna, I going.

1041
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,965
If they want to,
let them come and call us! Come Siddha.

1042
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:09,668
Let them come and chop their own tree.
- Hey, listen to me...!

1043
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,765
Karia... Karia!

1044
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,341
Hey, why are you like this?

1045
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:23,278
What are they little kids?
They'll come back soon!

1046
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,950
Ah, speak of the devil, they are here!

1047
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:41,102
Gowda sir,
where did you go to all night?

1048
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:44,138
Your women folk got
fed up waiting for you.

1049
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,299
Now we are here right?
Shut up and get going.

1050
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:49,635
I've had enough of your pestering,
asking me where I had gone!

1051
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:53,114
Oh, what has happened to this Gowda?

1052
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:55,743
What the...

1053
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:01,621
They have walked all that way,
so they must be worn out.

1054
01:13:02,179 --> 01:13:05,717
You both get going, I'll see what it is.
Go on.

1055
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,791
I'll meet you later, go on.

1056
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,665
Oh okay. take out the butter though.

1057
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:14,931
Bye. Lord knows what
happened to this Subbayya!

1058
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:20,270
Hey, aren't they like our family,
why did you tell them to leave?

1059
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,936
Stop thinking of them as family,
now shut up and go inside.

1060
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,979
Hey what are you possessed or something?

1061
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,309
You please keep your mouth shut dear.

1062
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:30,675
It is not us who are possessed,
its them.

1063
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:35,320
All these days have we ever talked
back to anything you have said?

1064
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:38,621
Look my child,
don't come poking this one time.

1065
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,258
Only we know how we managed to
escape with our life in our hands.

1066
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:47,762
Stop asking question
and get the water boiling.

1067
01:13:49,059 --> 01:13:51,767
What are you looking at, go!

1068
01:13:58,335 --> 01:14:02,283
Hey, why are you fretting
over such a small matter?

1069
01:14:02,339 --> 01:14:05,286
Is there no one else
who knows how to chop wood.

1070
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,221
Have you heard of sawmill
owner Krishne Gowda?

1071
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,656
Who is that? - Who? - Hey I hear
his name in the market, go on.

1072
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:16,059
He uses an elephant in the
mill to move logs. Really an elephant?

1073
01:14:16,353 --> 01:14:22,099
Hey Byra, I told you about the
Krishne Gowda's elephant in the market.

1074
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,159
Oh yeah.

1075
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:25,137
The other thing is.

1076
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:29,735
He uses a unique man to do the
work that the elephant can't.

1077
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:33,337
My God, a man can do
what the elephant can't?

1078
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:37,608
I'll call that bugger to this Kiragoor.

1079
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:54,726
Which bloody worthless
buggers chopped this tree?

1080
01:14:54,925 --> 01:14:57,269
Oh, it was men from our village itself.

1081
01:14:57,761 --> 01:14:58,899
Why, what happened?

1082
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,702
What has happened you ask?!

1083
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,940
Oh my dear,

1084
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,106
do you know how much it has suffered?

1085
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,181
Can a tree suffer?

1086
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:13,277
What, are you asking can trees suffer?

1087
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,913
Why, don't trees have a soul?

1088
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,191
Does a tree have a soul?

1089
01:15:17,581 --> 01:15:19,788
If a tree doesn't have a soul,
how can it talk to me?

1090
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:23,228
What, can trees also talk?

1091
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:26,062
Go to the side and mind your business!

1092
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,997
If it cannot talk, how will it
teach me to chop without hurting it?

1093
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:33,363
Teach to chop without
hurting it, a tree?

1094
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:35,140
A tree...?!

1095
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:38,712
See, they don't know
anything about trees Razzak.

1096
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:40,770
Forget that brother, look here.

1097
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,712
Mothers grace! They've tried to chop
without supporting the wood.

1098
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,215
They have kept something there,
but he is saying otherwise?

1099
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:48,278
Damn you!

1100
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:53,324
Oh Razzak, that is what
my darling keeps telling me.

1101
01:15:53,617 --> 01:15:55,927
Yes, these sons of the
devil have half killed it!

1102
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,625
Hey, what do you think
chopping a tree is kids play?

1103
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:04,638
You can just take a saw or axe
and start chopping willy-nilly!

1104
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:07,709
Okay now,
what do you need to build a house?

1105
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,111
Wood!

1106
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:14,707
What is a plough made of?

1107
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,312
Wood!

1108
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,814
What do we need to make a cart?

1109
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:20,110
Wood!

1110
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,112
Forget all that,

1111
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,182
what are boats & ships made of?

1112
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,249
Wood!

1113
01:16:26,316 --> 01:16:29,320
Man became a man only
after he learnt to chop wood!

1114
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:35,792
Otherwise he would have remained like
a donkey, dog or pig say's our father.

1115
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,667
You have to learn a lot about trees.

1116
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:41,072
I'll teach you,
we'll start from today itself.

1117
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:06,862
The elephant couldn't do it...

1118
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:08,696
Daani?

1119
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:13,867
This is like drawing
a map to No-man's land!

1120
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,335
Huh, he looks like he will
be blown away in our village's wind.

1121
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:20,176
Will he be able to chop wood?

1122
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:28,185
Hey, what are you starting at?
Come and help me.

1123
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:30,256
She was the only thing missing!

1124
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,886
Get it down.

1125
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:41,927
Eat, these hot ragi balls!

1126
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,330
Instead of working they are
wasting the time telling stories.

1127
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,940
Its like they say, an unrestrained
monkey can burn down the city.

1128
01:18:01,277 --> 01:18:05,282
Madam doesn't seem to have
the information about my brother.

1129
01:18:06,316 --> 01:18:12,164
Once she sees our work, she will herself
reward us with two more bags of ragi.

1130
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:14,694
Razzak...!
- Brother?

1131
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:17,237
Enough talking, let's start working.

1132
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:19,634
Pull it...

1133
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,040
pull it hard.

1134
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:24,009
Slowly, don't hurt it.

1135
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,306
Pull, it's coming out!

1136
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:29,177
Hey don't hurt her pull it slowly.

1137
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:36,985
Oh my, the saw we couldn't budge
for a week, they removed it in one go!

1138
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:38,720
Oh this is nothing.

1139
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:43,059
Look at him, like Shankarappa said
he is truly extraordinary!

1140
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,065
Hey what is extraordinary about this.

1141
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:48,694
Once our Krishne Gowda's elephant...
- Yeah tell them.

1142
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:51,602
It couldn't push a tree trunk over!

1143
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:57,143
That is when, our Sonsappa
threw it onto the lorry in a snap!

1144
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,741
You know what Krishne
Gowda said after that? What?

1145
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:05,085
Sonsappa, you're alone
equal to 10 elephants he said.

1146
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:10,155
And he gave rewards of 5 bags ragi,
wheat... - Hey Razzak!

1147
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,782
Don't tell them all that.

1148
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,224
The have seen our work now, right!

1149
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:17,025
Why, won't you also give
tow bags rewards as well?

1150
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,157
Hey they are good people brother.

1151
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:22,163
How will they not give?
- Hey Razzak!

1152
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,705
After removing the saw,
I'm reminded of another tree.

1153
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:26,237
Do you know which one?

1154
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,831
You know... that big one...

1155
01:19:27,964 --> 01:19:30,001
Oh yeah that huge tree.

1156
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,143
Do you know the story behind that tree?

1157
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:37,207
Oh, you are extraordinary in both
chopping wood and story telling.

1158
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:38,742
SonsaPPa,

1159
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:42,119
if you keep on narrating we can listen
to not one but 10 of your stories. Go on...

1160
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:45,751
Razzak you tell this one.
- It was a huge tree near the forest.

1161
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:48,589
As an elephant couldn't
go there we went alone...

1162
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:51,655
it was humongous!

1163
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:54,065
Sonsappa and me at one go...

1164
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:58,662
You bloody fools, if they have
brought a third person to do the job,

1165
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:02,207
go and ask them what wrong
you have done and rectify it.

1166
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:06,804
I have never seen
such a thing ever before.

1167
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:09,380
All these day they
were like our brothers,

1168
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,979
but I don't know what
happened to them now!

1169
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:16,319
Okay mother.
We will ask them face-to-face.

1170
01:20:16,713 --> 01:20:20,320
Hey Karia,
we can't just leave like this.

1171
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,620
Yes Maaranna, you are right.
Let us ask them what their issue is.

1172
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,901
Hey where are all of you going,
come here and say cheers.

1173
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,766
What? Chairs?

1174
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:35,407
Yes, Christ has said that
the wine you drink is my blood.

1175
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:43,011
So if we say cheers before we drink
our wishes will get fulfilled.

1176
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:45,712
Really, whatever we wish will come true?

1177
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,152
Kaalappa,
just say cheers before you drink,

1178
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,953
then you will come
and tell me that it works.

1179
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:55,092
Okay, I'll try it.
- But Sons, this is not wine though!

1180
01:20:55,618 --> 01:21:00,158
Christ says, whatever we drink is wine.
Say cheers... let me.

1181
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:01,225
Oh like this!

1182
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:01,961
Now you!

1183
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:05,666
Come here.
- Chairs!

1184
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:15,148
Oh, you finished it in one go.
That is how you should drink this.

1185
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:18,948
Then, what do you think
of my brother Sonsappa?

1186
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:24,156
Brother...?
- No not that!

1187
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,753
Brother, put on a song.
- Okay.

1188
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:35,264
Hey give that radio here.

1189
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,067
Oh Sonsappa, enough let go now.

1190
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,803
Okay bye, see you tomorrow.

1191
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,775
See you brother, bye!

1192
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:23,315
Hey slowly Razzak, or else I will fall.

1193
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:50,869
Why are you all so quiet suddenly?
Did anyone die?

1194
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,675
Hey, get your drink and get lost.
What is your concern with whoever dies?

1195
01:22:55,905 --> 01:22:59,352
You used to be so lively, why are
you acting like sour arses today.

1196
01:22:59,676 --> 01:23:03,214
What Kaalappa,
are you all possessed or what?

1197
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,285
Who the hell is possessed,
what the hell are you saying?

1198
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:07,987
<i>Hey Kama no! Keep quite.</i>

1199
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:12,089
Let him talk Byrappa,
why are you stopping him?

1200
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:14,268
What is there to talk to you about?

1201
01:23:14,957 --> 01:23:18,200
You have brought and outsider to
chop our tree, is that honorable?

1202
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:19,831
We want nothing to do with you!

1203
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:22,971
Why do you say that,
what wrong have we done to you?

1204
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,243
Hey Kaala, keep calm. Keep calm Kaala!

1205
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:37,615
Hey come on let's go.
Leis get out of here!

1206
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:43,592
Hey Subba come, leis not
be around them anymore! Kaalappa...?

1207
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,263
What the hell happened to him?

1208
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:55,769
Shankarappa,
what has happened to these Gowdas?

1209
01:23:55,832 --> 01:23:57,004
Why did the leave crying like that?

1210
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:00,613
How will we know what is
in their hearts? Yes, exactly?

1211
01:24:00,737 --> 01:24:04,742
There are ways to know, what
is there in their hearts.

1212
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,257
Oh don't hide it any more,
tell us what it is.

1213
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:22,997
Those Gowdas had come.

1214
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:26,865
They came and told me...

1215
01:24:26,963 --> 01:24:32,106
to do some black magic to paralize
these lower caste bugger's limbs.

1216
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:38,276
But, I said if you do that
you families will be ruined

1217
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,076
and kicked them out.

1218
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,053
They came to do such a thing to us?

1219
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,322
Then what should we do sir?

1220
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:52,028
Take an axe or sword and chop off
the limbs of one of those Gowdas.

1221
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:56,032
Then everyone will fall in line.

1222
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:58,627
No sir!

1223
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:01,108
We can never do such a thing.

1224
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:05,144
No one in our lineage
has done such a thing!

1225
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:10,577
Oh then, those Gowdas will find someone
else to do the curse I refused to.

1226
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:14,176
Let them do that, then the curse
will ruin the family. - Useless buggers.

1227
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:15,881
We want nothing to do with them anymore.

1228
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:18,080
Bless us Swami.
- We'll take our leave.

1229
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:23,630
I never thought they
were such heinous men.

1230
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:26,998
This is what they give
us for considering them our own.

1231
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:31,104
We won't mingle with them
if it means the end of all of us.

1232
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:35,901
These buggers used to prance around
cause they were friends with the Gowdas.

1233
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:40,205
They used to drink together in the bar,
their wives used to always be together.

1234
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:43,682
This bloody Maara wouldn't
let me put up board on his land!

1235
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,682
Now let them suffer, damn buggers!

1236
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,053
Look Shankarappa,

1237
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:54,086
I have just let one
demons out of the bottle.

1238
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:57,996
Let us see what it is capable of!

1239
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:09,235
Hey”

1240
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,770
Hey Subbha!

1241
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:14,239
Hey Subbha, get up!

1242
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:18,881
What is you problem at this hour?

1243
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:21,788
What is it?

1244
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:24,088
Say what is it?

1245
01:26:24,814 --> 01:26:26,088
Am I nothing to you?

1246
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:30,660
Do you really have to ask?
You are my everything!

1247
01:26:30,887 --> 01:26:33,094
Then why won't you tell
me what happened in the station?

1248
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:35,931
Look Daani, don't ask me this one thing!

1249
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:37,059
Just go to sleep.

1250
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:44,007
How many times I have told her not to
but she keeps asking me about it,

1251
01:26:45,301 --> 01:26:47,144
Oh my god!

1252
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:55,021
Did you just kick me in the arse?

1253
01:26:55,144 --> 01:26:58,148
If you keep pestering like this,
I will have to kick you arse!

1254
01:27:13,129 --> 01:27:14,904
Daani...
- What is it?

1255
01:27:15,031 --> 01:27:17,204
It's hurting where you kicked me.

1256
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,336
Oh, what is it killing you?
Shut up and go to sleep!

1257
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,883
What did you expect it
feel good when I kick you?!

1258
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:33,251
Sonsappa, I wanted to
ask you something... - Go ahead.

1259
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:37,859
In Christianity,
can we remarry if we don't have kids?

1260
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:44,670
You can, but you don't need to.

1261
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:50,876
Kaalappa, it depends on
the wife's family capabilities.

1262
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,808
What do you mean?

1263
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:53,840
What I mean is...

1264
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,774
I'll tell you my own story.

1265
01:27:56,205 --> 01:27:58,879
My sister didn't have kids after 3 years
of her marriage,

1266
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,012
her husband wanted to remarry.

1267
01:28:01,244 --> 01:28:02,985
You sit Kaalappa I'll tell you...

1268
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:05,958
When I heard of this I was really upset!

1269
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:09,154
There is this big papal
tree in our village.

1270
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:14,225
I went to that tree, and asked what
should I do? Tell me what should I do?

1271
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:18,102
And I hugged that tree
and cried like a baby.

1272
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:20,834
Then, the tree told me...

1273
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:22,665
what I should do!

1274
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:26,837
Kaalappa, I put me saw on my shoulder...

1275
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,248
I went to him and told him.

1276
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:34,049
If you do get remarried,
I chop of you head!

1277
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:36,815
And he never spoke of marriage again.

1278
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:42,288
Kaalappa... let me know
if your sister has such a problem,

1279
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:44,092
I'll get my saw and chop their heads.

1280
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:51,662
The fact I asked you about the issue
that was my mistake!

1281
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:53,629
Come let's go get some breakfast.

1282
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:07,613
“Every morning I have
to remember so many people“

1283
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:12,825
Damn this bugger!

1284
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:16,158
He took 20 days to chop this.
But thank god it's finally done.

1285
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:19,688
But this is such a huge tree.
- Sonsappa what's next?

1286
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:26,339
Ifl had the right tools I alone
would have chopped this tree by now.

1287
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,801
Hey Sonsappa, think of us as your tools.

1288
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:33,711
Razzak is also here,
just tell us what to do and we'll do it!

1289
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:38,045
Razzak... You remember we
had gone to a village named Mudgere.

1290
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:40,618
The same thing happened there too,
right? - Yes brother.

1291
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:43,947
There, a sir used to
show us pictures of birds...

1292
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:48,118
Can you remember his name?
- Oh that was such a big name...

1293
01:29:48,184 --> 01:29:50,721
Yes, Chand sir!
- Hey, that's not it!

1294
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:54,962
It is not Chand sir, its Poornachandra
Tejaswi. - Yes, yes! - Kaale Gowda sir.

1295
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:59,303
You know what he said about me?
Hey Sons...

1296
01:29:59,361 --> 01:30:03,935
You're the only man who talks to trees.
I will write a story about you...

1297
01:30:04,133 --> 01:30:07,046
So do you know what I told him?
- Oh for god's sake don't start again!

1298
01:30:07,336 --> 01:30:11,284
There is a lot of time to listen to your
stories. Also my grandfather's tree...

1299
01:30:11,841 --> 01:30:16,347
has fallen on the pathway, you have to fell
it as well. So quickly finish this work!

1300
01:30:16,946 --> 01:30:20,120
Okay, you wouldn't understand
it even if I told you. - Go on!

1301
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:22,286
Get chopping, I'll be back soon.
- Hey where are you off to?

1302
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,026
I'm getting late for the market.

1303
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:30,031
Screw the market, we have to push
this up. Come, come and lend a hand.

1304
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:33,900
PUSH AND FLIP IT!
- PUSH AND...FLIP IT!

1305
01:30:33,996 --> 01:30:37,375
Hey, when I say Push and flip it,
you must say 'AISA'

1306
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:39,169
G01: it?

1307
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:42,979
Okay now, PUSH AND FLIP IT!
- AISA... AISA!

1308
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:47,586
You have to say it together or else the
tree wont budge. Okay let's start again...

1309
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:50,821
PUSH AND FLIP IT!
- AISA!

1310
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,620
JUST A BIT MORE!
- AISA!

1311
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:54,217
ALMOST THERE...!
- AISA!

1312
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,229
PUSH AND FLIP IT!
- AISA!

1313
01:30:56,252 --> 01:30:58,129
JUST A BIT MORE!
- AISA!

1314
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,131
ALMOST THERE...!
- AISA!

1315
01:31:00,356 --> 01:31:03,963
All we are doing is saying AISA.
This rotten tree didn't budge an inch!

1316
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:07,207
You have to push using your whole body,
Go back now.

1317
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:08,263
Okay move back, and let some space.

1318
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:11,233
Kaale Gowda sir,
come let's get those bamboos.

1319
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:13,804
Razzak, go get those stumps.

1320
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:20,748
Lift it, lift it... just a little more.

1321
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,312
Come go on, lift it a bit more.
Flip it over!

1322
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,687
Hey the trunk moved...!

1323
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:30,697
Hey now that it is up
place the big stump under it!

1324
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:35,033
Put it there now... - Oh my god!
- My back, it gave out completely!

1325
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:37,694
Hey Byra, what happened?
- What happened Subbayya?

1326
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:39,204
Oh god no!

1327
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:41,174
Come come, slowly now. Come to the side.

1328
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:44,936
Hey Razzak first come and look at him!

1329
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:48,046
Hey what happened there?
- Hey Subba, what happened to you?

1330
01:31:48,103 --> 01:31:52,313
What happened?
- Did Byrappa's back also break? Oh god!

1331
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:57,114
Hey Subba! Hey what ever you doing
when I told you to place the stump?

1332
01:31:57,179 --> 01:32:01,753
Oh no! The tree trunk is rolling away!
Oh no my tree, stop my tree!

1333
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:11,627
Hey, the trunk is rolling down.
Move aside. give way!

1334
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,300
Eeravva!

1335
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:21,044
Eeravva!

1336
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:47,868
Keep calm mother, you're safe now.

1337
01:32:47,997 --> 01:32:53,811
My water can has been crushed flat,
what would have happened if it were me?

1338
01:32:53,869 --> 01:32:57,043
Keep calm, nothing has happened, has it?
- Daanamma, you saved my life!

1339
01:32:57,106 --> 01:32:59,814
I was shouting that much,
can't you hear you old woman?

1340
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:02,716
Damn you!
- Damn you sons of bitches!

1341
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:08,126
Damn you homes wreckers! Damn
you to hell, you donkey faced buggers!

1342
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,956
I've seen what you have been doing,
have you come to take our live.

1343
01:33:12,988 --> 01:33:16,959
Do you think a life is your play toy?
Hey get lost, don't stand in front of me!

1344
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:20,732
Bloody worthless bugger!
Hey run Sonsappa... but my tree?

1345
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:23,669
Oh mom, nothing happened to you right?
- Are you okay Eeravva?

1346
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:27,372
Its those useless bugger,

1347
01:33:27,636 --> 01:33:33,712
Damn them, have they come
to chop wood or ruin my home?

1348
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:37,249
Hey Kaalappa please stop...
Come let's find our tree.

1349
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,656
Shut up and get lost!

1350
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:40,722
Such a big mistake has happened
to my brothers

1351
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:41,853
and these guy is worried about a tree trunk!

1352
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:43,260
You are the one who
talks to trees right?

1353
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:46,163
Go ask it where it went!
Shut your pie hole and get lost!

1354
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:50,994
Is this the guy who used
to say Sonsappa so polite?

1355
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,868
Okay come let us only find the tree.

1356
01:33:53,929 --> 01:33:57,672
Oh near those women!
Allah show mercy upon us!

1357
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:01,241
No brother, why should we bother.
Come let's go.

1358
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,307
But my tree? - Com brother,
we need no part of that tree!

1359
01:34:12,581 --> 01:34:19,191
Oh, such a big log came rolling
as if it was aim to get your mother!

1360
01:34:19,621 --> 01:34:21,794
If Daanamma wasn't there,

1361
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:24,167
today we would
doing the last rites for mother-in-law.

1362
01:34:24,226 --> 01:34:27,002
Ah, how many time will you repeat this,
won't you let me sleep in peace?

1363
01:34:27,196 --> 01:34:29,335
Even we would have done
the same if we were in her place!

1364
01:34:29,765 --> 01:34:32,177
I'm just sharing the
pain of what I saw...

1365
01:34:32,234 --> 01:34:33,178
just lie down & listen.

1366
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:35,306
Hey, do you want me to
go drink the urine of Gowdas

1367
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:37,611
because Daanamma saved my mom?
Shut up and to go sleep.

1368
01:34:38,707 --> 01:34:40,880
Look at him acting like a raging bull!

1369
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:43,714
I was just talking about
how you mom was saved!

1370
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:47,124
Why do you rage for that?
Damn sleep alone here like a ghost!

1371
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:50,262
Take it, there is 20 rupees here!

1372
01:34:50,652 --> 01:34:52,222
<i>Sh', and where is our rag?!?</i>

1373
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:53,789
Because of the great work you did,

1374
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:55,766
we don't even know where
our trunk rolled off to!

1375
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,935
Two of our men's back gave give out,

1376
01:34:57,993 --> 01:34:59,904
now will our women let
us take ragi out for you?

1377
01:35:01,897 --> 01:35:03,308
Gowda sir!
- What?

1378
01:35:03,732 --> 01:35:06,770
For whatever reason,
this time the tree did not listen to me.

1379
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:17,351
My lord the father up in the heavens,
never give such problems again.

1380
01:35:17,613 --> 01:35:19,752
Allah, show us mercy!
- Amen!

1381
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:26,756
Gowda sir, take your money.

1382
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:29,764
Razzak come let go.

1383
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:32,664
Allah Hafiz,
we are going from you village.

1384
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:36,610
Leis go Sonsappa,
I've had enough of this tree!

1385
01:35:38,801 --> 01:35:41,782
I knew it the very moment
the tree left without telling me.

1386
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:45,710
There is something very
wrong in this village Razzak!

1387
01:35:45,941 --> 01:35:49,718
Otherwise,
would the tree just up and go like that?

1388
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:53,883
Oh god! This is the last time. We should
never show our heads in this village again.

1389
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:56,154
Daani, just a bit more.

1390
01:35:56,218 --> 01:35:57,993
My veins are falling off giving
you a massage over and over again.

1391
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:01,226
I feel like you're getting
addicted to these massages.

1392
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:03,327
Its not like that dear.
- What is not like that?

1393
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:06,334
If you just lay quietly for a few days
the bones will snap back in place.

1394
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:09,334
Wait, if someone else
gets more oil to massage,

1395
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:11,168
I'll scratch their
face off with a cactus.

1396
01:36:11,233 --> 01:36:12,769
Oh my god!

1397
01:36:16,338 --> 01:36:18,284
Look here, its been 3 weeks now.

1398
01:36:18,674 --> 01:36:20,176
Everything is happening
in the bed itself.

1399
01:36:21,243 --> 01:36:24,087
Go now, go and get that Karia!

1400
01:36:25,147 --> 01:36:27,093
Don't get involved in this issue.

1401
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:29,253
<i>“Om!</i>

1402
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:34,666
I'll crawl here till the day I die. But
I want nothing to do with those buggers.

1403
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:36,994
You don't butt you
nose into everything you...

1404
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,070
Yes, I butt my nose everywhere.

1405
01:36:41,196 --> 01:36:45,872
All these days, the women took care
of the fields, the kids and homes.

1406
01:36:45,934 --> 01:36:49,882
Now they are struck with
cleaning up after you as well.

1407
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:53,651
That is what you wanted as well!
Cover yourself and snuggle happily.

1408
01:36:53,742 --> 01:36:55,187
To hell with you lazy buggers!

1409
01:36:56,044 --> 01:37:00,049
Do whatever the hell!
I had enough of trying to right you men.

1410
01:37:00,782 --> 01:37:02,693
What else do I have
to see with these eyes...!

1411
01:37:02,751 --> 01:37:04,788
Oh, what is it Vasachari
you rarely come her anymore?

1412
01:37:04,953 --> 01:37:07,160
Yes, Kaala had called for me.
For what?

1413
01:37:07,222 --> 01:37:10,226
To change replace
the teeth of the plough.

1414
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:12,899
Seems like Vasachari is here,
wait I'll be back.

1415
01:37:13,395 --> 01:37:16,342
Yes he is inside. Kaala, hey Kaala!

1416
01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:19,942
Vasachari, come.

1417
01:37:20,135 --> 01:37:21,910
How many days its been
since I called for you...

1418
01:37:22,204 --> 01:37:24,912
And you have come now?
Hey, I some urgent work.

1419
01:37:25,707 --> 01:37:27,243
How are you brothers now?

1420
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:29,411
Hey Kaala, where did you go to?

1421
01:37:29,678 --> 01:37:30,918
See for yourself.

1422
01:37:31,413 --> 01:37:33,154
There is no oil that I haven't
used to massage their backs.

1423
01:37:33,649 --> 01:37:37,324
Hey these oil massage and
home remedies are out dated.

1424
01:37:37,753 --> 01:37:39,061
Now its all about 'Doctors'.

1425
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:41,690
We have to go and get cured by Doctors.

1426
01:37:41,757 --> 01:37:43,794
Keep quite Aachari,
why do you say such horrible things!

1427
01:37:44,226 --> 01:37:47,207
If you rest for four days,
the pain will go on its own.

1428
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:49,105
In our youth we have
seen such things many a times.

1429
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:53,073
Did we act like this?
- Hey, don't talk about your youth Uncle.

1430
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:56,214
These days the pain doesn't just
disappear like it used to in those days.

1431
01:37:57,105 --> 01:38:00,917
Yes sir, please don't make
this bigger than it needs to be.

1432
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:03,149
Kaalappa,
take them to a doctor in the town.

1433
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:06,125
But which doctor do we show them to?

1434
01:38:06,348 --> 01:38:08,259
Hey, a guy in our village
had the same pain.

1435
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:11,696
There is a Doctor Appanna
in Priyapatna town.

1436
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:16,165
They took him there and gave
him current, it immediately cured him.

1437
01:38:16,358 --> 01:38:18,702
What... giving current cured him?

1438
01:38:18,927 --> 01:38:20,804
Giving current cured him instantly?

1439
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,731
Yes, that's what I said!

1440
01:38:22,931 --> 01:38:24,877
They took him lying down.

1441
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:28,010
But he came back walking on his feet,
after he took some current!

1442
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:34,242
Vasachari, you're right.
- Yes I am!

1443
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:36,416
It will be a mistake wait any more.

1444
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:38,789
Let's get the cart ready.

1445
01:38:40,849 --> 01:38:42,294
Hey Byra!
- What?

1446
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,928
That doctor has miracle hands it seems.

1447
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:48,695
I'll drive when going there,
on the way back you guys drive.

1448
01:38:48,857 --> 01:38:50,928
I will come sleeping like a king.

1449
01:38:52,894 --> 01:38:55,875
Pull it up form the bottom once...
your breath I mean.

1450
01:38:56,164 --> 01:38:57,643
I cannot sir.

1451
01:38:57,933 --> 01:39:00,812
If I breathe that deeply, it feels like
my hips will drain the life out of me.

1452
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:03,315
Which bloody fool brought
you to this hospital?

1453
01:39:03,372 --> 01:39:04,316
Its me sir.

1454
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:07,380
It was me, why do you ask?

1455
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:12,725
If you would have delayed a bit longer,
he would have died.

1456
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:15,387
Sir, why do you say such ungodly words?

1457
01:39:15,851 --> 01:39:18,058
Just because there is this Dr.
Appanna...

1458
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,623
You bring me patients in
the worst possible condition!

1459
01:39:21,723 --> 01:39:22,827
What am I to do now?

1460
01:39:24,693 --> 01:39:26,263
Look sister, test him for...

1461
01:39:26,328 --> 01:39:30,777
jaundice, BP, blood sugar,
and everything else you can think of.

1462
01:39:30,999 --> 01:39:31,739
Yes doctor.

1463
01:39:32,834 --> 01:39:36,680
Sir, they have is a sprained
back from trying to lift a tree...

1464
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:37,978
Are you the doctor or am I?

1465
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,716
You sir.

1466
01:39:39,775 --> 01:39:41,118
Then let me to do my work.

1467
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:42,721
Don't come wagging you tail in between!

1468
01:39:43,278 --> 01:39:48,023
Only when we check them completely,
will we know the defects.

1469
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:50,825
You village folk know only to doubt,

1470
01:39:50,886 --> 01:39:52,365
and die doubting.

1471
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:59,032
Sister, do his urine test, stool test, blood
test, all tests and get me the reports.

1472
01:39:59,061 --> 01:40:01,063
Okay doctor.
- If need be we will cut them up!

1473
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,271
What are those tests he just said?

1474
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:09,011
Stool, Urine and blood tests.

1475
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:14,915
Now come and pay an advance.

1476
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:27,763
See this, the right vertebra has twisted
and fallen on top of the left vertebra.

1477
01:40:27,989 --> 01:40:29,229
What does that mean Sir?

1478
01:40:29,658 --> 01:40:34,767
It means the right vertebra
has fallen on the left vertebra.

1479
01:40:35,664 --> 01:40:38,270
Right bravo... left bravo...

1480
01:40:39,101 --> 01:40:40,842
No not bravo.

1481
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:43,174
Bra, Vertebral

1482
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:45,780
Yes, that same bra...

1483
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,611
shouldn't it sit
one on top of the other?

1484
01:40:50,178 --> 01:40:51,316
Why are you laughing?

1485
01:40:52,848 --> 01:40:55,988
It is a miracle if they are still alive
after one has fallen on the other,

1486
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,793
It must be a direct act of God!

1487
01:40:58,854 --> 01:41:02,233
Oh no, Sir... now how to rectify it?

1488
01:41:03,058 --> 01:41:05,698
Don't worry.
Appanna is here. I'll take care.

1489
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:09,675
Nurse, - Yes doctor.
- Admit their patients

1490
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:14,180
and give them 4 times ultra violet heat
and 3 times current shock treatment daily.

1491
01:41:14,636 --> 01:41:15,910
Did you get it?
- Yes doctor.

1492
01:41:16,338 --> 01:41:17,646
Don't worry.

1493
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:20,854
Once this Appanna puts his hands to it,
he will clear everything.

1494
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:22,219
Just see the miracle of current.

1495
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:28,126
First to chop the tree...

1496
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:30,020
they brought in some outsiders.

1497
01:41:30,886 --> 01:41:33,867
Now they have gone to the
town to get treated for a sprain.

1498
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:36,968
If they had asked you to come and
set it wouldn't you have gone?

1499
01:41:37,025 --> 01:41:37,969
Hell, keep quite.

1500
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:41,573
Those city buggers
will empty their riches.

1501
01:41:41,897 --> 01:41:42,967
Then they will learn their lesson.

1502
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,709
Who know what lessons they will learn!

1503
01:41:48,036 --> 01:41:49,014
Please take you medicine.

1504
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:51,807
<i>Hey Kama...</i>

1505
01:41:52,908 --> 01:41:55,013
How do you feel about this hospital?

1506
01:41:55,577 --> 01:41:56,317
What would I feel?

1507
01:41:56,745 --> 01:42:00,818
Isn't it like the cell,
the urine pit in the police station?

1508
01:42:03,218 --> 01:42:04,026
Very true.

1509
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:07,357
There the inspector
beats you with a cane.

1510
01:42:07,956 --> 01:42:10,960
Here the doctor drains
our blood with a needle.

1511
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:16,966
The thing is, they have to take us there
forcefully, but we willingly come here.

1512
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:18,709
Hold this.

1513
01:42:23,772 --> 01:42:25,376
You both share your pains and sorrows.

1514
01:42:26,675 --> 01:42:28,382
Where are you off to?
- I'll back soon.

1515
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:31,854
<i>Kama... Hey Kama!</i>

1516
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:55,877
Curse this Appanna Doctor!

1517
01:42:56,071 --> 01:42:57,914
Hey what happened here?

1518
01:42:57,973 --> 01:43:00,249
This doctor was extorting money...

1519
01:43:00,308 --> 01:43:02,049
to treat a corpse for three days.

1520
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:03,612
That is why we are
burning down the hospital!

1521
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:04,679
Burning it down?

1522
01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:08,088
Hey Byra, Subbha!
Carefully, carefully now.

1523
01:43:08,283 --> 01:43:10,729
Sister, where are my boys?
- Who the hell know, go to the side!

1524
01:43:10,786 --> 01:43:12,060
I don't know where the doctor

1525
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,963
or patients are
and he wants me to find his boys!

1526
01:43:14,022 --> 01:43:17,902
Byra, Subbha... where are you?
- Call out to me you buggers!

1527
01:43:20,996 --> 01:43:23,636
You idiot, ride slowly!

1528
01:43:23,832 --> 01:43:28,247
We used to be able to somehow
sit up every now and then.

1529
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:34,051
But you took us to get current
and now laid us out for good.

1530
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:38,623
What, what is your problem?

1531
01:43:38,847 --> 01:43:41,851
What did I do?
What is my mistake in this?

1532
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:44,697
I took you for your
own good your buggers!

1533
01:43:44,853 --> 01:43:47,766
What can I do if your right
bra came and sat on the left?

1534
01:43:48,156 --> 01:43:49,829
Your fate is to blame!

1535
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:51,302
What is that 'Bravo' Kaala brother?

1536
01:43:51,593 --> 01:43:55,200
Oh that cheat Doctor, showed
me a photo and told me everything.

1537
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:58,270
But you won't understand even it.
Yes, like you said...

1538
01:43:58,633 --> 01:44:03,139
if our fate has shifted from left to right
and right to left, what can you do?

1539
01:44:03,204 --> 01:44:05,741
Then shut the hell up!
- Go on drive.

1540
01:44:05,807 --> 01:44:09,619
Subbha doesn't it feel like that
Kiragooravva is standing on our backs?

1541
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:23,132
If no one got cured
in the hospital either...

1542
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,135
maybe its just better to call Karia!

1543
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:31,270
What is going to happen
if we sit pondering old issues?

1544
01:44:33,635 --> 01:44:37,310
If you can't then say so,
I'll go and bring Karia myself.

1545
01:44:40,241 --> 01:44:45,691
Kaalappa, how long it has
been since I saw you! How are you?

1546
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:47,250
Kaalappa-J

1547
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:50,254
Maara!

1548
01:45:07,602 --> 01:45:08,239
Kaalappa.

1549
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:12,240
Are you just arriving now, come in.

1550
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,284
Come and sit down.

1551
01:45:52,213 --> 01:45:54,215
How much longer do we stay like this?

1552
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:58,063
Do you feel satisfied if we suffer on?

1553
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:03,797
Look, you are here. Come to the point.
Don't beat around the bush.

1554
01:46:06,695 --> 01:46:09,972
I won't, come and set Byra
and Subbha's sprained backs.

1555
01:46:10,865 --> 01:46:14,642
What Kaalappa, how long has it been
since they sprained their backs?

1556
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:18,143
Everyone has had a
turn at pulling on them.

1557
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:20,683
You even went to the city hospital as well.

1558
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,312
Who knows what internal injuries
might have happened?

1559
01:46:22,577 --> 01:46:23,817
Now if he comes

1560
01:46:23,879 --> 01:46:26,257
and does something you'll put all the
blame on him if anything goes wrong.

1561
01:46:26,948 --> 01:46:28,928
Hey Maara!
- What?

1562
01:46:29,784 --> 01:46:31,161
You are not like what you were before!

1563
01:46:31,285 --> 01:46:33,925
Who, are we not like
what we were before?

1564
01:46:34,322 --> 01:46:38,134
Sit and think and you'll
realise whose heart is pure.

1565
01:46:40,328 --> 01:46:43,241
We'll think about that later,
first come.

1566
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:46,145
What, do you think it's
that easy to snap out old sprains?

1567
01:46:46,234 --> 01:46:47,178
What do you mean?

1568
01:46:48,603 --> 01:46:53,074
We have to lock both hands together
and tightly hold it around the neck.

1569
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:55,210
The you must place the
head on top of the elbows

1570
01:46:55,276 --> 01:46:58,655
and lay him on the ground
and step on his spine with our feet.

1571
01:47:00,214 --> 01:47:01,625
What is he saying?

1572
01:47:02,783 --> 01:47:04,626
Why must you step on him with your feet?

1573
01:47:04,686 --> 01:47:07,064
What do you mean why?

1574
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:09,192
The back will be firm and the
nerves pop the spine back into place.

1575
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:10,895
That is why you must step on it.

1576
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:14,629
We have never seen you pop
the sprain with your feet before.

1577
01:47:15,964 --> 01:47:17,307
Why can't you use your hands?

1578
01:47:17,365 --> 01:47:18,810
Yeah why not!

1579
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,941
If you know how to,
go and try it out with your hands.

1580
01:47:23,004 --> 01:47:25,211
If it pops, I'm very happy!

1581
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,679
I'll send everyone to
you to pop their sprains. Go.

1582
01:47:39,587 --> 01:47:40,759
Okay then.

1583
01:47:41,923 --> 01:47:43,766
May you be blessed,

1584
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:56,205
Oh my, he just left.

1585
01:47:57,772 --> 01:48:00,275
With the knowledge you have,
is what you did right?

1586
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:04,118
You do it for everyone, what would you
lose if you did it for our brothers?

1587
01:48:04,345 --> 01:48:07,155
What, do think is
this right even to you?

1588
01:48:07,249 --> 01:48:10,253
When that Kaala left with
a worn look on his face...

1589
01:48:10,284 --> 01:48:12,059
did you feel the least bit bad?

1590
01:48:12,287 --> 01:48:16,133
I never knew the son
I bore was this inhuman!

1591
01:48:16,191 --> 01:48:19,297
You would not bear me if you knew it?
Mind you business.

1592
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:21,734
What demon has possessed you,
I don't know?

1593
01:48:21,796 --> 01:48:25,801
Look at him sitting like a stone.
Couldn't you advice him.

1594
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:28,370
And he is the eldest, damn you!

1595
01:48:28,636 --> 01:48:29,410
Hey you donkey...

1596
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:32,652
if you only knew of the fire
in our hearts. Leave it Maaranna.

1597
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:34,377
Just keeps yapping on like a...

1598
01:48:34,809 --> 01:48:38,086
If you ever butt your nose here again,
I'll chop your head off!

1599
01:48:39,347 --> 01:48:41,987
Did he really say that, that bugger!

1600
01:48:42,783 --> 01:48:43,784
Yes he did!

1601
01:48:44,051 --> 01:48:46,793
I felt like kicking his head off.

1602
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,968
He kept insisting that he
must step on you with his feet.

1603
01:48:50,057 --> 01:48:52,128
With his feet he wants to step on me?!

1604
01:48:52,727 --> 01:48:54,070
Worthless bugger!

1605
01:48:57,899 --> 01:48:58,934
Okay brother...

1606
01:49:00,068 --> 01:49:01,775
is snapping out a sprain that difficult?

1607
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,944
Let me have at it.

1608
01:49:11,746 --> 01:49:13,657
There is one there!

1609
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:17,954
Come on girls, it's getting
late leis finish our work inside.

1610
01:49:18,019 --> 01:49:21,091
Give me this hand. Hold it here.

1611
01:49:21,622 --> 01:49:23,966
Hold it, I am telling
you it will be alright.

1612
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:26,866
Give me that hand and hold it there.

1613
01:49:26,928 --> 01:49:28,839
You must hold it tight.

1614
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,671
Be gentle.
- Yes I will.

1615
01:49:31,866 --> 01:49:33,402
Now I'll press on the spine.

1616
01:49:36,037 --> 01:49:38,108
Hey keep calm, don't shout.
I should hear the snap.

1617
01:49:41,275 --> 01:49:42,811
Did it snap?

1618
01:49:45,213 --> 01:49:45,918
Did it snap?

1619
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:50,158
Did it snap now?

1620
01:49:53,788 --> 01:49:55,790
I can't take it anymore.

1621
01:49:57,124 --> 01:49:58,262
It just won't snap back in.

1622
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:00,765
I must try something different.

1623
01:50:16,911 --> 01:50:19,357
Did you hear the snap?
- There is no bloody snap just leave it.

1624
01:50:21,616 --> 01:50:22,754
Why won't it snap?

1625
01:50:23,317 --> 01:50:27,857
That bugger was right, we must lay you
down and step on it with the feet.

1626
01:50:34,963 --> 01:50:37,170
Give me you hands, hold it on your neck.

1627
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:41,175
Once I step on it, it must snap.

1628
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:43,580
Give me you hands, come now...

1629
01:50:49,077 --> 01:50:51,114
Did it snap?
- No it didn't, no!

1630
01:50:52,046 --> 01:50:55,220
Damn this sprain, how will it not snap!
Let me try it with my right leg.

1631
01:51:01,055 --> 01:51:02,329
Hold on, a bit more!

1632
01:51:02,924 --> 01:51:06,167
Hey it snapped, it snapped!
- Did it really snap?

1633
01:51:06,828 --> 01:51:07,772
Did it pop out?

1634
01:51:08,263 --> 01:51:11,335
It snapped!
Didn't I tell you it would?

1635
01:51:12,233 --> 01:51:13,940
See the sprain is gone.

1636
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:19,344
I cannot stand up.

1637
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:22,315
Neither can I.

1638
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:24,288
My back gave out!

1639
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:26,992
I am not able to stand up straight.

1640
01:51:28,049 --> 01:51:29,027
I think I sprained it.

1641
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:33,356
My back is killing me!

1642
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:37,358
Then was that snap
your back popping out?

1643
01:51:54,108 --> 01:51:55,678
Do it slowly.

1644
01:51:57,144 --> 01:51:59,146
You are my biggest pain...

1645
01:52:00,348 --> 01:52:01,122
Get down.

1646
01:52:01,782 --> 01:52:03,125
Get up and go inside.

1647
01:52:03,718 --> 01:52:06,096
Uncle... Uncle...

1648
01:52:06,287 --> 01:52:07,766
What is it?

1649
01:52:08,789 --> 01:52:10,268
Uncle should I help you up?

1650
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:11,763
Hey shut up go inside.

1651
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:14,972
Go uncle! Aunty... Aunty!

1652
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:16,706
See...

1653
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:19,174
even simple-minded kids...

1654
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,178
are now making fun of me.

1655
01:52:21,235 --> 01:52:23,647
Leave it be. Why did you call for me?

1656
01:52:23,704 --> 01:52:25,980
Yes, I did call for you.

1657
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:30,184
I do business in the market...

1658
01:52:31,179 --> 01:52:33,022
can I keep sitting here like this?

1659
01:52:33,848 --> 01:52:36,727
It's been 2 weeks and
I haven't gone to the market.

1660
01:52:38,219 --> 01:52:40,961
Now I can't trust that Kulawadi Karia.

1661
01:52:41,889 --> 01:52:43,698
I can't even go to the hospital.

1662
01:52:43,925 --> 01:52:45,632
Oh, why are you blabbering on?

1663
01:52:45,693 --> 01:52:47,263
Ijust a man in pain...

1664
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:51,101
if I blabber a bit...

1665
01:52:51,266 --> 01:52:53,212
would it kill you to listen for a while?

1666
01:52:54,068 --> 01:52:55,911
Don't get mad, go on tell me.

1667
01:52:57,672 --> 01:52:59,242
Tell me... does it hurt?

1668
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:02,043
Don't touch it.
- Now what do you want me to do?

1669
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,883
You know our Ragi Channabasappa...

1670
01:53:06,047 --> 01:53:07,720
a Pandit is visiting him.

1671
01:53:07,815 --> 01:53:09,590
Do something and bring him here.

1672
01:53:10,584 --> 01:53:14,225
Let us see if he can
rectify this mistake.

1673
01:53:14,756 --> 01:53:17,896
That is it...
I'll get him. Don't worry about it.

1674
01:53:17,959 --> 01:53:20,064
I'll take my leave. Be careful.

1675
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:22,334
Oh sorry...
- Oh, don't touch it!

1676
01:53:22,596 --> 01:53:24,234
'Suffer you buggers'

1677
01:54:14,882 --> 01:54:16,793
What are you starting at his face for?

1678
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:18,330
He is the panndit whose
come to cure the sprain.

1679
01:54:18,753 --> 01:54:19,731
Yes.

1680
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,300
Hey you worthless women,
how long will you take? Show them in.

1681
01:54:27,161 --> 01:54:28,902
Who is it?
- It is the pandit, he is here.

1682
01:54:30,264 --> 01:54:31,868
Come.
- Come sir.

1683
01:54:31,933 --> 01:54:33,742
He is the patient, Kaale Gowda.

1684
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:38,682
Greetings, Ragi Chennabasappa has told
me a lot about you. That is why I came.

1685
01:54:39,006 --> 01:54:40,076
Please sit.

1686
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:43,611
What happened?

1687
01:54:43,911 --> 01:54:44,753
Sprain.

1688
01:54:44,912 --> 01:54:46,619
Give me your hand, let me see.

1689
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,092
You're blessed.
The bone is perfectly alright.

1690
01:54:56,324 --> 01:54:59,794
There is just a small
tear in the muscle though.

1691
01:55:01,195 --> 01:55:02,299
Oh, then what are we to do now?

1692
01:55:02,663 --> 01:55:04,108
Oh don't worry!

1693
01:55:04,265 --> 01:55:08,941
You just see,
I'll make it vanish in just 4 days.

1694
01:55:08,969 --> 01:55:12,246
Kaalappa, get well soon
at the hands of the pandit.

1695
01:55:12,306 --> 01:55:14,718
Our bar is feeling lost without you.

1696
01:55:15,209 --> 01:55:17,120
Shall I leave now?
- Okay, I'll come you go now.

1697
01:55:17,178 --> 01:55:19,954
Okay, don't worry.
I'll cure him, you may leave now.

1698
01:55:21,282 --> 01:55:25,162
Gowda sir, I need an assistant
to prepare the medicine.

1699
01:55:25,653 --> 01:55:26,324
What do you need?

1700
01:55:26,654 --> 01:55:27,962
To grind the medicine...

1701
01:55:28,122 --> 01:55:31,126
even children will do,
like your kids or whoever!

1702
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,133
Where do I have that privilege?

1703
01:55:35,295 --> 01:55:38,242
I didn't understand.
There she is that barren cow...

1704
01:55:38,298 --> 01:55:40,278
She will help you.

1705
01:55:41,102 --> 01:55:42,979
Oh she is my wife, Nagamma.

1706
01:55:43,571 --> 01:55:45,244
What else does she have to do?
She'll help you.

1707
01:55:45,306 --> 01:55:47,217
Oh Naagu amma,

1708
01:55:47,274 --> 01:55:50,187
now we are introduced.
Okay, she will do.

1709
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:51,681
Where are you from?

1710
01:55:51,746 --> 01:55:54,955
We pandits don't have a home to go to.

1711
01:56:08,762 --> 01:56:11,641
Do you know where these roots are from?

1712
01:56:11,832 --> 01:56:13,641
They were brought from the Himalayas.

1713
01:56:14,234 --> 01:56:17,977
Where is the glass?
- Nagu amma, I need one more glass.

1714
01:56:18,038 --> 01:56:20,245
Do you prepare medicine wherever you go?

1715
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:21,615
Gowda sir.

1716
01:56:21,909 --> 01:56:24,321
We don't go and prepare
medicine in whomever's house.

1717
01:56:24,812 --> 01:56:28,225
Ragi Chennabasappa has
spoken very highly of you,

1718
01:56:28,248 --> 01:56:31,786
that is why I have come to
your house to prepare these medicines.

1719
01:56:32,053 --> 01:56:34,033
Otherwise, I would never...

1720
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:38,670
Donkey... can't you do
this one small thing properly!

1721
01:56:39,093 --> 01:56:39,969
Pick the glass.

1722
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:44,738
It's okay Gowda sir, be patient.

1723
01:56:44,799 --> 01:56:47,746
You are scolding Nagu amma
this harshly for such a small thing.

1724
01:56:47,968 --> 01:56:49,242
Oh my god!

1725
01:56:50,971 --> 01:56:53,975
Look Gowda sir,
while drinking the medicine...

1726
01:56:54,341 --> 01:56:56,082
you shouldn't be angry.

1727
01:56:56,344 --> 01:57:02,317
If you drink this medicine you'll sleep
tight and your pain will vanish by morning.

1728
01:57:03,017 --> 01:57:04,997
Nagu amma give this to Gowda sir.

1729
01:57:05,186 --> 01:57:06,164
It's for your own good.

1730
01:57:15,963 --> 01:57:16,941
Slowly, be careful!

1731
01:57:17,031 --> 01:57:19,409
After long time he has come outside.

1732
01:57:23,304 --> 01:57:25,944
Thanks to pandit's medicine,
I feel better now.

1733
01:57:26,741 --> 01:57:29,119
I can sleep peacefully now uncle.

1734
01:57:29,644 --> 01:57:30,714
Pandit.
- Yes.

1735
01:57:30,778 --> 01:57:33,122
There are 2 more men who
are bedridden due to sprains.

1736
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:35,121
You have to grind some
medicine for them as well.

1737
01:57:35,849 --> 01:57:38,193
Definitely, we will do it.

1738
01:57:38,786 --> 01:57:42,359
First let me help our Kaale Gowda able to
go to the market, then you are next in line.

1739
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:45,834
When a muscle tears...

1740
01:57:46,026 --> 01:57:48,836
we do what is called
a 'Round Stone Therapy'

1741
01:57:48,963 --> 01:57:52,843
If we do that everything
will come together.

1742
01:57:58,138 --> 01:58:01,813
But you must put your trust in me,
that's all.

1743
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:06,824
If you do, I will make the pain vanish!

1744
01:58:14,688 --> 01:58:16,827
Right-right!
Give way, my vehicle is coming!

1745
01:58:54,361 --> 01:58:55,965
Pandit...?

1746
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:01,973
Nagi...?

1747
01:59:03,938 --> 01:59:05,940
Hey, where the hell did you go to?

1748
01:59:22,723 --> 01:59:25,761
She ran away with all the
jewels in the house. Really?

1749
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:28,830
She put my name to
shame and has run away!

1750
01:59:28,962 --> 01:59:30,839
Oh poor fellow, see how he is crying!

1751
01:59:31,098 --> 01:59:33,874
What the hell do I do now uncle?!

1752
01:59:34,335 --> 01:59:37,179
Still, our Nagavva
is no the kind to run.

1753
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,347
That home wrecker
Pandit is to be blamed.

1754
01:59:41,709 --> 01:59:45,885
No, he came to cure the sprain but must have
put some spell or something on her...

1755
01:59:46,213 --> 01:59:47,715
and she ran away with him.

1756
01:59:49,283 --> 01:59:51,092
She gave all of us a bad name.

1757
01:59:51,151 --> 01:59:54,894
That she did.
- Now, we can't walk around proudly.

1758
02:00:06,734 --> 02:00:12,184
She shamed me in front
of the entire village, that...

1759
02:00:14,741 --> 02:00:16,049
Shameless...

1760
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:18,920
Uncle... uncle!

1761
02:00:20,314 --> 02:00:23,693
I have brought you lunch.
- Have you now, get it here.

1762
02:00:31,959 --> 02:00:34,098
Aunty ran away, right?

1763
02:00:35,896 --> 02:00:38,775
Oh she is a shameless... let her go.

1764
02:00:41,735 --> 02:00:44,045
Doesn't you mom make any sweets?

1765
02:00:46,807 --> 02:00:49,185
There-there, don't get upset.

1766
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:53,884
Aunty will soon come back,
and make sweets for you.

1767
02:00:54,615 --> 02:00:57,186
You have grown this much
but haven't learned anything.

1768
02:00:57,351 --> 02:00:59,194
Go, go and get some water.

1769
02:01:01,188 --> 02:01:03,190
No one will come back after they elope.

1770
02:01:03,357 --> 02:01:05,735
Do you think this is a small mistake?

1771
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:08,071
She will come back he says...

1772
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:15,080
Take it.
- Kaala, we found Nagamma!

1773
02:01:15,202 --> 02:01:17,204
We have brought her here, come outside!

1774
02:01:17,738 --> 02:01:21,083
Aunty is here, aunty is here! Aunty...!

1775
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:31,395
No way can she enter the house!

1776
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:35,093
I'm a man not a eunuch
to let her in like that!

1777
02:01:35,222 --> 02:01:37,634
First call for the Panchayat
and let them decide.

1778
02:01:38,125 --> 02:01:39,866
Hey, don't say that!

1779
02:01:39,927 --> 02:01:42,635
She made a mistake un-knowingly,
let her in!

1780
02:01:42,696 --> 02:01:45,575
You come dear...
- Aunty, you keep quite! What do you know?

1781
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,043
Don't try to preach to me.

1782
02:01:47,635 --> 02:01:51,344
Let the heads decide if the mistake
was her's or mine, then we'll see.

1783
02:01:51,705 --> 02:01:56,154
Don't my son, if we go to panchayat
we only will lose our respect.

1784
02:01:56,177 --> 02:01:58,054
Don't be stubborn, take her in.

1785
02:01:58,111 --> 02:02:01,354
Look, don't interfere in my
personal matter. Just shut up and go!

1786
02:02:01,715 --> 02:02:07,722
Mom, how many times to tell you
not to butt you nose in everything.

1787
02:02:07,788 --> 02:02:10,132
Go, shut up and go I say!

1788
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:15,139
Oh, I don't know what has possessed
this village and the men in it.

1789
02:02:15,863 --> 02:02:19,675
Look Kaala,
I can't see a Panchayat with my eyes.

1790
02:02:19,733 --> 02:02:22,373
Do whatever you want to, I'm going!

1791
02:02:22,869 --> 02:02:25,372
You won't prosper, none of you will.

1792
02:02:25,639 --> 02:02:29,212
If you make women shed tears,
how will you ever prosper?

1793
02:02:29,276 --> 02:02:32,382
No, how can we just let
her in without a proper inquiry?

1794
02:02:32,813 --> 02:02:37,626
Do a panchayat inquiry or whatever,
till then Nagi will stay with us.

1795
02:02:39,052 --> 02:02:40,861
Come...

1796
02:02:47,594 --> 02:02:50,336
What I'm asking is,
today you are asking for a divorce...

1797
02:02:50,697 --> 02:02:55,339
then why were you crying
day and night that my wife ran away?

1798
02:02:55,869 --> 02:03:00,147
I cried thinking that pitying
me they would get me remarried.

1799
02:03:01,075 --> 02:03:04,318
How was I to know they
would bring back her itself?

1800
02:03:04,578 --> 02:03:06,114
What the hell, are you a human being...?

1801
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,718
I write SOOsq. feet of land in you name.
Please somehow get me a divorce.

1802
02:03:12,953 --> 02:03:14,728
I could...

1803
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:21,739
but, what to do about Nagamma though?
Even her parents have disowned her.

1804
02:03:21,996 --> 02:03:23,373
What am I that heartless?

1805
02:03:24,264 --> 02:03:26,676
I'll give her my outhouse to stay in.

1806
02:03:26,734 --> 02:03:30,147
And provide provisions
as long as she is alive.

1807
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:33,912
That can be done.

1808
02:03:36,209 --> 02:03:38,155
You might be right Shankara...

1809
02:03:39,046 --> 02:03:41,151
I can do anything I want.

1810
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:44,092
But how will I get them a divorce?

1811
02:03:44,285 --> 02:03:46,026
Will the people agree?

1812
02:03:46,186 --> 02:03:48,962
What is there for the
people not agree to this?

1813
02:03:49,089 --> 02:03:51,899
Which honest man would say it's a right?

1814
02:03:51,959 --> 02:03:54,701
But still, it is a sensitive issue.

1815
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:56,672
What is sensitive in this?

1816
02:03:57,097 --> 02:03:59,304
Nagamma's husband Kaale Gowda is the one

1817
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,706
who is insisting that the
panchayat gets him a divorce.

1818
02:04:04,271 --> 02:04:05,716
Did he say that?

1819
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:08,111
Does that mean he doesn't want her?

1820
02:04:08,175 --> 02:04:10,655
He say's he wants
nothing to do with her.

1821
02:04:11,244 --> 02:04:13,781
She is also infertile.
- Oh say that then!

1822
02:04:14,247 --> 02:04:17,126
Barren cow,
what can he do with someone like her?

1823
02:04:17,184 --> 02:04:18,060
Isn't that true?

1824
02:04:19,253 --> 02:04:24,601
If the husband himself has said this,
how can we let this opportunity go Shankara?

1825
02:04:24,925 --> 02:04:26,063
But sir!

1826
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:29,903
These Kiragoor women are
not ordinary in any aspect.

1827
02:04:30,163 --> 02:04:31,369
They are extraordinary women,

1828
02:04:31,632 --> 02:04:34,909
no man has been able to tame them.
But now they are in our clutches.

1829
02:04:35,069 --> 02:04:36,309
If you take a cane

1830
02:04:36,370 --> 02:04:40,318
and spank Nagamma 4 times really hard,
then the rest will feel that pain.

1831
02:04:40,574 --> 02:04:45,683
Hey, why just 4? I'll trash her
8 times and get her to divorce him.

1832
02:04:47,147 --> 02:04:51,562
You came to see me
despite of your back pain,

1833
02:04:51,618 --> 02:04:52,722
I'm so haPPY-

1834
02:04:54,288 --> 02:04:57,132
Hey, how could I not come?

1835
02:04:57,191 --> 02:05:00,832
Hey, come fast.
- Yes, I'm coming.

1836
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:08,606
What do you have? ldly,
vada, masala dose, lemon rice, pulav...

1837
02:05:08,669 --> 02:05:10,239
Don't you have any sweets?
- We have Kesaribath.

1838
02:05:10,637 --> 02:05:12,878
Don't you have Mysorepak or jilebi?
- We don't have those.

1839
02:05:14,241 --> 02:05:15,584
Okay. Get it two plates each.

1840
02:05:15,709 --> 02:05:17,188
Four plates Kesaribath!

1841
02:05:18,679 --> 02:05:20,352
Lets celebrate with some thing sweet.

1842
02:05:20,947 --> 02:05:23,928
I'll come to you village's
panchayat tomorrow.

1843
02:05:25,319 --> 02:05:26,957
Hey, Day after that
you will be coming home.

1844
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:29,591
What is the issue in
coming to the panchayat?

1845
02:05:30,057 --> 02:05:31,900
Brother... brother!

1846
02:05:32,792 --> 02:05:36,069
What is your problem when I'm
praying you...! Shut you hole and wait.

1847
02:05:39,232 --> 02:05:40,973
Hey Krishna...

1848
02:05:41,635 --> 02:05:43,808
Tomorrow is like a festival for us!
I know sir.

1849
02:05:44,171 --> 02:05:45,912
People will come from
the surrounding villages.

1850
02:05:45,973 --> 02:05:49,819
Once the panchayat is over, everyone
will come here and have a couple of pints

1851
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:55,292
Don't fill only spirit,
add some water to it.

1852
02:05:55,716 --> 02:05:58,060
I was waiting till you finished
your prayers. - What is it with you?

1853
02:05:58,118 --> 02:05:59,995
You are the one who asked me to come.

1854
02:06:00,987 --> 02:06:03,991
Tomorrow there is a
panchayat in Kiragoor, come.

1855
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:05,262
What is it for?

1856
02:06:05,325 --> 02:06:10,274
Hey, one of these Kiragoor
women had eloped, that is it.

1857
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:13,277
Oh no, Kiragoor women!
Then I'm not coming!

1858
02:06:14,568 --> 02:06:16,570
Hey it will be like
watching a burlesque show,

1859
02:06:16,637 --> 02:06:18,776
come and bring another 4 men with you.

1860
02:06:19,172 --> 02:06:19,912
Okay then.

1861
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:23,681
Krishna"
put some in his mouth for free.

1862
02:06:23,944 --> 02:06:26,185
Give me the without the water.
Did you see me mix it?

1863
02:06:28,148 --> 02:06:32,688
Look, I don't know about
you men but we want Nagamma.

1864
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:35,964
I can't tolerate to see her get hurt.

1865
02:06:36,089 --> 02:06:39,036
What can we do for that,
will Kaalappa listen to us?

1866
02:06:39,192 --> 02:06:41,695
Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

1867
02:06:42,195 --> 02:06:46,610
If that Kaale Gowda leaves our Nagamma,
shall I bring her to our house?

1868
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,747
Are you stupid or crazy?
Shut up and keep quite.

1869
02:06:50,037 --> 02:06:51,345
She says whatever the hell!

1870
02:06:51,605 --> 02:06:54,176
Look, there will be lots
of people in the panchayat tomorrow,

1871
02:06:54,241 --> 02:06:57,814
if you open your mouth there
I'll stomp you into the ground!

1872
02:07:35,282 --> 02:07:38,593
Look there she comes,
the one who ran away.

1873
02:07:42,856 --> 02:07:46,030
The one who is walking behind
is the one who eloped, Nagamma.

1874
02:07:46,326 --> 02:07:50,604
And the one in the front
is the rowdy Daanamma.

1875
02:08:05,646 --> 02:08:07,717
What extraordinary looking she is!

1876
02:08:07,781 --> 02:08:09,260
Yes she is indeed extraordinary.

1877
02:08:09,783 --> 02:08:11,854
How come she didn't see any one of us?

1878
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:15,861
Jai Ugra Bhyrava!

1879
02:08:15,889 --> 02:08:20,395
I can see everything,
everything that you have done.

1880
02:08:20,827 --> 02:08:24,400
Hey Nagamma... come here Nagamma.

1881
02:08:25,365 --> 02:08:29,814
Come stand in front of these people,
accept your sins. Come!

1882
02:08:31,138 --> 02:08:33,914
Shankarappa go and
drag that Nagamma here.

1883
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:41,690
I will, beat all the demons
that have inhabited her body.

1884
02:08:41,748 --> 02:08:43,318
Bring that bitch here!

1885
02:08:44,651 --> 02:08:46,062
Can't you come when Swami calls?

1886
02:08:46,253 --> 02:08:49,860
You know to run away but don't
know how to act in the panchayat?

1887
02:08:51,658 --> 02:08:53,365
How many times do I have to call you?

1888
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,997
Don't you have any respect for me?

1889
02:08:56,063 --> 02:08:58,009
What did you see in that
pundit that you ran away with him?

1890
02:08:58,065 --> 02:09:00,170
Tell me why did you run away with him?

1891
02:09:00,233 --> 02:09:02,042
Which demon is possessing you?

1892
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:03,774
Which demon, which lady demon is it?

1893
02:09:04,104 --> 02:09:05,913
It seems like all the
gods have entered Swami's body.

1894
02:09:07,307 --> 02:09:08,786
Can't you see it in his eyes?

1895
02:09:08,842 --> 02:09:10,879
Lord Ugra Bhyraveshwara!

1896
02:09:10,944 --> 02:09:15,723
Make this woman confess her sins
and save this village from shame.

1897
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:17,895
Save us, save us all!

1898
02:09:18,385 --> 02:09:21,332
Which horrible demon has possessed you?

1899
02:09:22,756 --> 02:09:24,360
HEY!
- Speak the tru...!

1900
02:09:26,793 --> 02:09:30,366
You want a woman to tell
you why she might elope with a man?

1901
02:09:37,404 --> 02:09:40,942
Then why are you shaking that
stick here? Go and ask your wife.

1902
02:09:41,708 --> 02:09:42,686
She will tell you.

1903
02:09:43,243 --> 02:09:46,053
When her husband is alive
she ran away with a boyfriend...

1904
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:48,854
HEY... useless bugger!
- She brought shame to the entire village.

1905
02:09:49,916 --> 02:09:53,261
Speak the entire truth.
You said her husband right?

1906
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:57,825
Because she hasn't had a child yet,
asking her to allow him to remarry

1907
02:09:57,891 --> 02:10:00,701
can he, this man,
abuse her every day and night?

1908
02:10:01,094 --> 02:10:03,665
Look at him sitting here, damn you!

1909
02:10:03,897 --> 02:10:05,706
What else can I do with her
if I am too have kids of my own?

1910
02:10:07,066 --> 02:10:08,739
How can you live
with an infertile woman?

1911
02:10:09,836 --> 02:10:13,750
If drinks all day at
you bar and sleeps all night,

1912
02:10:13,807 --> 02:10:15,115
how the hell will they have kids?

1913
02:10:16,876 --> 02:10:18,321
Kids of his own?

1914
02:10:18,712 --> 02:10:22,091
Will you have kids if you only come
near your wife once in a blue moon?

1915
02:10:22,215 --> 02:10:24,695
Oh, are you a woman, you shameless!

1916
02:10:24,751 --> 02:10:25,889
Shit, you useless bugger!

1917
02:10:26,119 --> 02:10:29,726
If you were indeed born to you father,
go ask him how he gave birth to you?

1918
02:10:36,296 --> 02:10:38,207
Shut the hell up, you god man!

1919
02:10:38,665 --> 02:10:40,975
Shut your pie hole for now!

1920
02:10:43,637 --> 02:10:44,615
She talked back to the god man...!

1921
02:10:46,773 --> 02:10:50,846
He hasn't let that girl
near him for the past 2 years.

1922
02:10:50,911 --> 02:10:52,151
How will she have kids?

1923
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:56,293
You ask for kids,
will the drop from the sky?

1924
02:10:58,618 --> 02:11:01,098
Damn you bugger,
what kind of human are you?

1925
02:11:01,321 --> 02:11:04,234
Hey god-man,
this sister is not the one possessed.

1926
02:11:04,290 --> 02:11:06,634
This cunning cheat of an
man is the one who is possessed!

1927
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:09,670
Look at him sitting like
he knows nothing. Damn him!

1928
02:11:09,929 --> 02:11:11,602
What is happening here Karia?

1929
02:11:12,832 --> 02:11:17,008
You are the one who is impotent but
you abused her! You will never prosper!

1930
02:11:19,139 --> 02:11:21,278
If you ever come to the market again,

1931
02:11:21,341 --> 02:11:24,720
I throw chilly powder in
your eyes and break you limbs.

1932
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,016
Bloody butternut crap!

1933
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:33,959
Beat that bugger and teach him an lesson!
At least then her life will be better.

1934
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,727
Make sure he never comes
to the market ever again.

1935
02:11:36,322 --> 02:11:38,666
Bhagya... Bhagya, wait please!

1936
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,973
Hey you bloody bitch!

1937
02:11:48,034 --> 02:11:49,809
First I must get rid of your demons.

1938
02:11:50,003 --> 02:11:51,914
Or else you will corrupt
all the women in this village.

1939
02:11:55,642 --> 02:11:58,953
You are just sitting
and watching all of this!

1940
02:12:02,249 --> 02:12:05,162
I'll show your end today, let go!

1941
02:12:07,153 --> 02:12:09,258
That is my holy cane. It is a god!

1942
02:12:09,322 --> 02:12:11,962
You will burn if you touch it.
Let it go!

1943
02:12:12,025 --> 02:12:15,996
Is it, let me see this
holy cane your god burn me!

1944
02:12:18,865 --> 02:12:20,310
I'll break you heads open!

1945
02:12:22,269 --> 02:12:23,680
Oh my god!

1946
02:12:25,672 --> 02:12:26,650
What the hell?

1947
02:12:26,739 --> 02:12:28,878
What happened to you?
- Shut up you home wrecker!

1948
02:12:28,942 --> 02:12:31,923
First we must break your back,
you are the reason all of this happened!

1949
02:12:31,978 --> 02:12:35,983
If you had cured the Gowdas that day itself,
we wouldn't have to see all this today!

1950
02:12:36,049 --> 02:12:37,653
Shut up please!

1951
02:12:37,717 --> 02:12:41,290
These Gowdas had gone to Swami asked him
to put a curse on us,

1952
02:12:41,321 --> 02:12:42,891
and you want me to cured them?

1953
02:12:43,322 --> 02:12:45,632
What, what did you say?

1954
02:12:45,925 --> 02:12:46,960
You are the buggers!

1955
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:50,573
You gave a police complaint on us
and accuse us of putting curses on you!

1956
02:12:50,964 --> 02:12:53,001
Tell them Swami,
you tell the Shankarappa!

1957
02:12:53,166 --> 02:12:56,739
Let that go now.
Let's focus on the present issue.

1958
02:12:57,003 --> 02:12:59,074
Leis teach these rowdy women a lesson!

1959
02:12:59,138 --> 02:13:01,584
You keep quiet Swami! What is it...?

1960
02:13:02,275 --> 02:13:05,950
We were the ones who refused when
Swami said he would put a curse on you!

1961
02:13:07,948 --> 02:13:12,658
What did you say? When this
very Swami told us to chop you up...

1962
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:14,824
we said if we did such
a thing to our brothers

1963
02:13:14,888 --> 02:13:16,799
Kiragooravva wouldn't let us live!

1964
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:20,103
Let that go, now let's see about her...
- Kaalappa...

1965
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:23,333
On the life of our wife and
kids we never did such a thing!

1966
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:24,973
Why did you do such thing Swami?

1967
02:13:25,031 --> 02:13:26,806
This is getting way out of hand!

1968
02:13:26,933 --> 02:13:30,745
Hey, when we asked you this, you would
come flying to kick us you buggers.

1969
02:13:30,803 --> 02:13:32,043
Hey, you keep quite!

1970
02:13:32,138 --> 02:13:35,312
Swami had made us take
an oath not to tell anyone!

1971
02:13:35,775 --> 02:13:41,054
Yes exactly, he said if we
did our families would be destroyed!

1972
02:14:26,692 --> 02:14:28,137
Look here he is that home-wrecker.

1973
02:14:28,194 --> 02:14:32,142
What will you not cure the Gowdas,
what?! I will, I'll cure them all!

1974
02:14:32,365 --> 02:14:34,140
Its become all about you men!

1975
02:14:53,019 --> 02:14:54,123
<i>HEY GOG-man'.!</i>

1976
02:14:54,187 --> 02:14:57,293
If I ever see you here again,
I drink your blood you bugger!

1977
02:15:02,128 --> 02:15:04,699
Hey Kaali, catch them!
Don't let them go!

1978
02:15:04,764 --> 02:15:07,267
Oh its you! Why have you come here?

1979
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:10,746
What had you come to see? I had
not told you to never come here again?

1980
02:15:24,117 --> 02:15:26,791
Come, let us put an end to all of this!

1981
02:15:47,674 --> 02:15:50,553
Damn, you got beaten up by women!

1982
02:15:50,710 --> 02:15:52,951
If only I would have been there.

1983
02:15:53,012 --> 02:15:56,016
Each one of them was acting
like they were truly possessed!

1984
02:15:57,984 --> 02:15:59,258
Why the hell are they coming here?

1985
02:16:00,253 --> 02:16:02,927
Narayana, come. Leis run away!

1986
02:16:03,923 --> 02:16:08,599
Hey bugger, you are just
a welfare servant. I am police!

1987
02:16:08,828 --> 02:16:12,139
If the touch the uniform on my body,
they will be beaten up by the military!

1988
02:16:12,298 --> 02:16:14,869
Just stand behind me and enjoy the show!

1989
02:16:15,034 --> 02:16:18,015
Hey, if I don't strip you
down and beat each one of you.

1990
02:16:18,071 --> 02:16:20,244
I'm not my father's son, come you...
leis see!

1991
02:16:20,607 --> 02:16:23,713
Useless bugger! You were
the one who ruined this village!

1992
02:16:39,925 --> 02:16:41,871
Kaali come with me.

1993
02:17:03,783 --> 02:17:04,784
Kaali...

1994
02:17:06,252 --> 02:17:07,754
I've found it!

1995
02:18:01,173 --> 02:18:03,813
Don't think this
is the end of the story,

1996
02:18:03,943 --> 02:18:05,320
the news of rowdy women of
Kiragoor destroying a liquor store

1997
02:18:05,378 --> 02:18:06,823
has reached all over the nation,

1998
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:09,826
and gave a spark to the farmers welfare
reforms. K. P. Poornachandra Tejaswi
