1
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,501
'With the blessings of (late) Mr R.M.Kalanjiyam
who guides us as father, mother, teacher, God'

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,144
'This is a tribute to my director
(late) Mr Balu Mahendra'

3
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,516
'...who is always by my side
- Seenu Ramasamy'

4
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,395
'Ethakovil
Andipatti'

5
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,520
You are my only hope this year

6
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,585
Give me the collection
without the lucky draw

7
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,186
That can't be done

8
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,458
We are old hands at this

9
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,625
How can I give it
without the draw?

10
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,261
Get the money from
whoever wins this time

11
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,863
Day after is the draw
What if you win it?

12
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,460
Wait for a while

13
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,239
'Abracadabra'

14
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,610
'Jee boom baa!
Wake up, uncle'

15
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,862
Abracadabra...!

16
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,626
Uncle, drink your tea

17
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,370
Let go, uncle

18
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,971
You are stinking

19
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,237
Didn't you go to school?

20
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,242
Don't come anywhere near
my school hereafter, okay?

21
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,710
I am teased by everybody in school

22
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:07,984
Why...?

23
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,349
Like your father, do you also think
it is beneath your dignity?

24
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,288
One little kissy for me
and I won't come

25
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,321
Fat hopes!
Try catching me

26
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,755
- You think I can't?
- I always stand 1st in sports

27
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,562
- Didn't see you past 3 draws
- I had gone out

28
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,726
(giggles)

29
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:24,831
My dear girl...wait

30
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,498
Abracadabra!
Freeze like a statue

31
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,502
Look how my magic works

32
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,572
'Clean bowled, huh?'

33
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,979
How much is the chicken?

34
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,116
This is a rooster!

35
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,317
'- 8th pot of water
- Write it down'

36
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,717
Hey! Why are you standing here?

37
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,719
Don't you know innocent
young girls live here?

38
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,128
Wail

39
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,525
Hey! Hold this

40
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,325
Give it to your mother

41
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,763
If he says I'll get the amount
only when I win the draw...

42
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,500
...how long should I wait for that?

43
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,331
I haven't paid my son's fees

44
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,371
Let us see who wins
in the lucky draw tomorrow

45
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,670
Don't know what to do
I'm going through a rough patch

46
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,506
Lap ii UP

47
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,356
People visit the temple
and pray diligently

48
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,058
But they don't give this temple cow
even half a trough of water!

49
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,329
You call this 'idli'?

50
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,002
8 years since we got married

51
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,204
Don't even know
to make soft 'idlis'

52
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,241
If I throw this at you,
your head will split into two

53
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,875
I ground the batter
till it was fluffy

54
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,115
As if I don't know
how well you do a job!

55
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,443
Won't your brother Durai
behave himself?

56
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,148
Do I need to
break his knee?

57
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,117
I'll lose my temper one day soon

58
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,155
Then I'll end up
amputating his limbs

59
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,896
Bro-in-law, slept upstairs, huh?
Looks like you just came in

60
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,531
Taste the 'idlis' your sister has made
Soft as petals it seems!

61
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,539
What a family I chose to marry into!

62
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,539
I got fooled by
her complexion

63
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,950
Hey! Take care of your husband's needs

64
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,311
Looking at some damn program

65
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,485
Don't simply yell at me

66
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,479
Food won't digest if you scream

67
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,925
Then I must admit you in a hospital

68
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,193
My blessed fate!

69
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,563
Stepping out to collect debts, huh?

70
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,436
Listen, your son's behavior
is absolutely atrocious

71
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,929
Put him in place

72
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,470
If you turn a blind eye
things will turn ugly

73
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,943
Get lost!

74
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,474
As if he has done something
out of the ordinary?

75
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,676
Pouncing on him
Go, do your work

76
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,185
Looks like you're hell-bent
in sending us behind bars

77
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,283
'Attend to your work'

78
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,093
Can't you behave yourself?

79
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,198
Mummy, don't listen to random people

80
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,440
Half the people who gossip
won't even be alive 5 years later

81
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,671
In your dreams
you'll be fine!

82
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,077
There's someone to
even tend to the cows

83
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:26,441
Remember there isn't a single person
defending you in this house

84
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,982
- You're there for me, mummy
- For how long?

85
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,186
How much longer...?

86
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,219
Your brothers are rude
and forever sulking

87
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,222
What if they all gang up and
do something to you, huh?

88
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,621
What can they do?

89
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,358
Will they finish me off?

90
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,495
Then who will go to jail?

91
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,259
Listen, ma

92
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,264
I won't rest till all of them
drink poison and die

93
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,705
Get lost, you whacko!

94
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,504
Get a job you are
ideally qualified for

95
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,146
- Hey! Stop
- What...?

96
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,175
He's wearing my new shirt, ma

97
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,051
He's your older brother after all

98
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,749
Oh yes! A fine brother he is

99
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,216
Real bother!

100
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,823
Sir, we always start with a half

101
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,094
Even if you moan and drink
you don't cross a quarter?

102
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,971
- You are a fool
- Me, sir?

103
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,973
Fool of the first order!

104
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,576
India has listed alcohol
under food and beverages

105
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,106
So should you be a glutton?

106
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,146
No, I won't

107
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,886
Can you stuff 50 'idlis' atone go?

108
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,847
Won't your liver be ruined?

109
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,852
You need to have control

110
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,158
A little of what you just said
went into my pea-brain

111
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,566
Tell me, sir

112
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,296
Do you know the best
intoxicant in the world?

113
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
What, sir?

114
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,903
To drink and be in your senses

115
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,579
But you don't follow your own theory
Looks like you are creating a scene

116
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,941
That's performance

117
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,583
Like the actors in films

118
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,384
It's like that
I was acting

119
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,293
Bro, give me Rs 68

120
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,824
Rs 68

121
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,365
You know my house, right?

122
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,261
- Collect it from my house
- Why should I?

123
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,127
WhY Can't you?

124
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,537
- Milkman delivers at home
- Yes, sir

125
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,502
- Newspaperman also
- Yes, sir

126
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,142
Even bankers go home
to collect their loans

127
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,176
Can't you go home for this
teeny weeny starter?

128
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,643
Come here, brother

129
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,477
Go to my house

130
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,214
You'll find a clean shaven
chap in white, like a polar bear

131
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,387
That's my bro-in-law

132
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,126
Tell him, 'Dharma sir came to my hotel'

133
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,554
Had a couple of drinks

134
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,263
Ordered marinated intestine
as appetizer as well

135
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,362
He'll gladly pay you
Add your tips too

136
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,828
This has become a habit

137
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,395
Pay up or you will
out a sorry figure

138
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,172
He is such a big officer

139
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,134
How dare you embarrass him like this?

140
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,704
Won't he pay
if he had cash on him?

141
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,541
His pockets are empty

142
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,370
'If you insist on him paying for
the intestine, I'll fish yours out!'

143
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,308
'Mannerless fellow!'

144
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,311
How was my act?

145
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,418
How can you hit
a worker in my presence?

146
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,193
1st apologize to
that intestine-bro!

147
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,591
Okay, let's call a truce

148
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
You take this medicine regularly

149
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,173
Morning and evening before food

150
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,504
Okay

151
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,149
Most important, you can't smoke
when you are on this dosage

152
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,685
If you do, you'll croak

153
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,617
DO you get it?

154
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,189
By the way

155
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,756
I heard you have invested
in my brothers' chit fund

156
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,368
50000

157
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,705
You poor soul!

158
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,738
They didn't spare you either

159
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233
Am I a poor soul?!

160
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,537
Uncle, you know I speak
only the truth, right?

161
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,872
Uncle

162
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,380
How did you trust them and
invest Rs 50,000 in a chit fund?

163
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,428
My entire set of siblings and uncles
plan like a villain at night

164
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,756
You might lose your money

165
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,494
Be on your guard

166
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,368
Is it a deathwatch, wake or what?

167
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,501
Wake up!

168
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,445
How are you?
English son-in-law?

169
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,413
Aunt

170
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,382
- How are you?
- I'm doing good

171
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,783
Pumping water?

172
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
You pump water and booze
into you at dawn!

173
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
You are teasing me

174
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,559
Can a doctor become a patient?
What is this, son-in-law?

175
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,666
My dear aunts, forget
the fact I'm a patient

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,401
Make sure you don't
end up as debtors!

177
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,837
Did they lend you money
for your son's college fees?

178
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,401
- No
- My brother's won't

179
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,577
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,244
Sister-in-law, I am sharing
my pearls of wisdom, truth as it is

181
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,855
What is he saying?

182
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,450
They are planning to escape
in the middle of the night

183
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,358
- What nonsense!
- Don't start a panic attack

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,858
Aunt

185
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,834
Hello

186
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,232
Respected people
of this village

187
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,707
Chit fund investors, take out
your money before Deepavali festival

188
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,376
They plan to escape
one night all of a sudden

189
00:13:59,672 --> 00:13:59,748
Don't come to me later
lamenting you lost money

190
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,685
Don't come to me later
lamenting you lost money

191
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,815
I can't help you because
I don't have money flow

192
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,056
- Why is he saying this?
- He's piss drunk!

193
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,159
Whatever it is talk to me
I know I can convince you

194
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,400
'Keep your hands off me'

195
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,268
I told you so
Did you listen?

196
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,335
I've carried you as a kid

197
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,199
Forgot all that, huh?

198
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,502
'What audacity!'

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,002
'Raising your hands?
Is this a new habit?'

200
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,441
I was on the way to the library
They dragged me here

201
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,383
Ask them about it

202
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,447
If we let him out 2 more days
he'll turn all the investors against us

203
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,252
Shut up
Fraud...!

204
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,026
Ma, if we let him go out
we'll be bankrupt

205
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,919
- Get inside
- Don't bully him

206
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,992
- Acting over smart?
- What the hell?

207
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,890
I'll create such a ruckus

208
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,168
Ma, you're responsible for all this

209
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,528
- You go in first
- Ma, don't go

210
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,032
What are you saying?

211
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,369
What will you do?

212
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,936
You had better tell mother

213
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,636
Hey Bhima...!

214
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,912
Don't beat him

215
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,436
Ladies, go inside

216
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,647
How can they
thrash him like this?

217
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,383
Why are you coming behind me?

218
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,879
Only the women were
asked to go in

219
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,376
Are you a female?

220
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,053
Go check what's happening there

221
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,524
'Bhima, what you are doing
is legally wrong'

222
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,486
Let go of me

223
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,693
Told you to let go of me

224
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,460
What...?

225
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,232
Remove the shirt

226
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,898
Take off the shirt?

227
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,767
Oh! You mean your shirt?

228
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,704
Take it, I don't want
any of your belongings

229
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,262
Ask him to take off his pant

230
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,472
Why do you need the pant?

231
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,210
Have you built a swimming pool
for me to swim in there?

232
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,843
Hey, remove your shirt and pant

233
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,645
Take your damn pant

234
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,478
'If anyone tries to open the door...'

235
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,720
'...I'll make mincemeat
out of him for sure!'

236
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,688
Hey, it is so stuffy
Not even a fan in here

237
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,480
Yov! Bro-in-law

238
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,461
Let me know your bloody
scheming plans

239
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
What is your plan?

240
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,357
'Hey! Bhimarasu'

241
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,498
Planning to commit suicide
by consuming poison?

242
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,464
Or intend killing me
with poison?

243
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,796
'- Tell me and then disappear
- What temerity!'

244
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,774
'My dear henpecked bro-in-law'

245
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,369
Yov! World's best ass-kisser!

246
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,337
Freebie fellow!
Find out and let me know

247
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,579
They knocked him down
and locked him up

248
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,351
But I am put to shame, huh?

249
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,813
Such a disgrace!

250
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:17,753
Forget it

251
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,415
You must be used to it by now

252
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,282
Don't magnify it

253
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,628
Mummy, how can you
call yourself my mother?

254
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,003
They have stripped me
and locked me up

255
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,365
Is this Andaman jail or what?

256
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,236
Entire family will be in jail if I complain
to the Human Rights Commission

257
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,344
Why are you screaming, nutcase?

258
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,382
In your mission to disgrace them
you are demeaning yourself

259
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,621
Listen, you better be calm

260
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,023
The old man in the next road
has passed away

261
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,658
All the bigwigs in and around
our village are attending the funeral

262
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,493
That grandpa is no more?

263
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,493
Shouldn't I pay my last respects?

264
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,665
If you come out, the folks inside
will pay you their last respects!

265
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,330
Have you also given up on me?

266
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,264
Carry on, mummy

267
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,112
R013?'

268
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,577
'Please come here'

269
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,051
What, uncle?

270
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,185
'What's up?
You seem to be so happy?'

271
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,151
They played music on the speaker
So we were asked to go home

272
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,393
'Really. . .?
That's great'

273
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,127
'When I was inside...'

274
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,795
'msomeone shut the door by mistake'

275
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,629
'You're a big magician'

276
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,227
'Can you wave your magic wand
and open the door for me?'

277
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,130
'What happened?
Forgot the magic words?'

278
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,771
Okay, done

279
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,404
Abracadabra, please open the door

280
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,576
'ls the magic working, my dear?'

281
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,279
Just hold on

282
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,553
Magic has worked
You can come out

283
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,329
'You are a whizz kid'

284
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,122
'Go and watch
your favorite TV show'

285
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,457
Okay

286
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,096
What are you doing inside?

287
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,669
'I am repairing the motor'

288
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,433
Oh! Okay

289
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,410
'Who is this standing
ever so glamorously?'

290
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,341
Looks like a girl?

291
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,479
Maybe fought with her husband
and walked out in a huff?

292
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,653
Stupid female! She has come
straight here from the bathroom

293
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,690
How unfair!

294
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,028
These scoundrels are still alive

295
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,364
But you passed away ahead of them

296
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,628
Take her inside

297
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,570
Ma, let's leave this place

298
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,698
(eleQY)

299
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,646
(song from 'oLi viLakku')

300
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,131
<i>Stop...stop..-Stop!</i>

301
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,928
How can you sing a film song?

302
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,139
- Won't you sing your own song?
- Who wants to listen to that?

303
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,567
All that is fine

304
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,408
Why have you made
those artistes sit in that corner?

305
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,411
They are 'Thappattam' drummers who play
when the corpse is taken to the cemetery

306
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,009
'Thappattam' means wrong beat
Is that what you mean?

307
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,650
- Watch your words
- Respectmrespect

308
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,650
Hello, master

309
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,658
Bhimarasu, why is the boy
behaving like this now?

310
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,632
After all the old man was rich
He's spoiling for a fight, take him home

311
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,999
- Who named you 'Thappaltam?
- Our villagers

312
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,168
You are the right beat
Play now

313
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,262
You are the right beat
Play now

314
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,606
Mr Country bumpkin singer, come

315
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,204
"People at this funeral are mourning"

316
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:15,179
"Kith and kin at this funeral mourning
Hearts knotted and minds moaning“

317
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,045
“Shrouded in sorrow
The entire village in tow"

00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,983
"Villagers weeping filled with woe"

319
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,126
"You were a man wise
To everyone so nice“

320
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,462
How long will you drawl?

321
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,656
Dragging it like a piece of meal!

322
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,660
This respected old man had 4 wives
He lived his life to the fullest

323
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,106
Sing a happy tune
He'll leave this world peacefully

324
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,205
Change the mood
and start the music!

325
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,742
"Friends at this funeral are grieving
The loss of this soul so loving"

326
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,712
"Kith and kin at this funeral mourning
Hearts knotted and minds moaning“

00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,189
"You were a man wise
To everyone so nice“

330
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,300
"Our village guardian
Revered as our custodian“

331
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:12,063
“You were a kind soul
Kept our village under control“

332
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,754
"With flowers ornamented"

333
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,665
“With a rose garland scented
On this throne royally seated“

334
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,660
“With flowers ornamenting
Prince, you are in peace resting“

335
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,300
"Perfume fills the air
Fragrance with a flair"

336
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,304
"Scent of rose water essence"

337
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,546
"The essence fills our senses“

338
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:55,248
"You smell good head to toe
Vigilante with a golden halo“

339
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,319
"Perfumed body asleep forever
Paladin who has passed over"

340
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,042
"You look as innocent as a lamb"

341
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,578
You are giving my money
from my pocket!

342
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,192
I have to pay my electricity bill
Don't donate that cash

343
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,587
"As innocent as a lamb
No one will you harm“

344
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,760
"Untainted, upright indeed
Like a child unsullied"

345
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:50,764
“With innocence in place
your face glows with grace“

346
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:56,508
“You have stepped into Heaven
Leaving us behind, sadness woven“

347
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:03,014
"Personification of goodness, my lord
you're in Heaven now with God“

348
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,782
"People at this funeral are mourning"

To everyone so nice“

353
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:24,606
“You were a kind soul
Kept our village under control“

354
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,034
Clear out

355
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,274
Drag him out of here

356
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,515
- Let go of me
- Take him away

357
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,477
Take your hands off!

358
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,759
'Bro, do you know what he did?'

359
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,464
He asked the bank officer
if he was a flesh-peddler?

360
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,701
He asked the barber to tonsure his head
claiming his mother passed away

361
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,969
What will people think of us?

362
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,938
How can we live here
with our dignity intact?

363
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,032
Bro, will you do it or shall we?

364
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,636
He goes around telling all the villagers
we'll loot their money, can you beat that?

365
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,310
What's happening?

366
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:08,580
I must feed the chicken

367
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,784
What are you looking for, ma?

368
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,056
Don't know where I kept
the measuring cup

369
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,904
Bro, call constable uncle

370
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,633
Let's finish the job!

371
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,430
If he acts smart,
chop and bury him

372
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,640
I'll accept the blame

373
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,308
Can't bear this disgrace any longer

374
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,909
Hey! What do you mean?

375
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,881
I thought you'll threaten him

376
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,714
You want to finish him off for good?

377
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,781
Looks like marrying you
was my biggest mistake

378
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,551
Your family has decided unanimously
to make me eat gruel in jail!

379
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,223
'Marrying to preserve the family bond
doesn't mean life time bondage!'

380
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,428
Stop sweeping for a while

381
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,597
- Hello, Bhimarasu?
- Uncle

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,804
Dharma's actions are
just not right at all

383
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,742
We've lost our respect and dignity

384
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,773
'- We'll lose our business too
- What happened?'

385
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,645
With this anger mounting up
they might do something

386
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,007
Hey, be patient

387
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,916
How do you expect us
to be patient?

388
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,683
You mentioned a man's leg
being crushed in Theni bus stand

389
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,750
Just do that for us

390
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,015
That was punishment in our times for
chaps beyond reform and criminals

391
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,687
All that can't be done now

392
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:25,927
It will become another case

393
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:26,862
'Do you get it?'

394
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,798
There is another option
I'll come in person and explain

395
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,347
Ma?

396
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,341
Is that food for your son?

397
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,641
He hasn't eaten a morsel
since this morning

398
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,443
I'm taking this porridge for him

399
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:52,915
Poor thing!
Let him eat

400
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,926
Chitra, go with her

401
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,228
Duraim?

402
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,963
Dharmadurai

403
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:16,535
Did I ask you for jewelry
or a house of my own?

404
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,350
I can't bear to watch my son
being beaten up black and blue

405
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,581
Go away somewhere

406
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,788
Wherever your heart takes you

407
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,424
A place where you think
you'll be happy

408
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,886
Go there and live happily

409
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,027
Come back after 6 months or a year

410
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,332
Everything will change for the better

411
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:45,338
Instead of gobbling it in one go

412
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,034
Mix it well and eat, okay?

413
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,439
'Akka', even you are ignoring me?

414
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,011
They are planning to do
something awful to you

415
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,088
- Why do you buy trouble?
- Forget that

416
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:00,680
- Why do you buy trouble?
- Forget that

417
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,356
'ls the 'idli' hot?'

418
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,024
'Akka', let the sun rise
I will handle that too'

419
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,496
'Okay...?'

420
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,496
How can they be scared
of these specimens?

421
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,067
What's wrong with my mother?
Asking me to mix properly and eat

422
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,005
As if I don't have teeth to chew!

423
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,335
Why aren't you sleeping
in your room, bro?

424
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,642
Hey! I had stacked
my ironed clothes on this mat

425
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:26,745
You threw them away?

426
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,881
One track mind!
It's all fine over there

427
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,685
Ages since I slept next to mother
That's why I came

428
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,082
'Ma, slept next to you
when I was a kid'

429
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,786
'Decades now!'

430
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,954
'Ma, don't go in the middle of the night
to drink water and fall down'

431
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,693
'Whatever it is, wake me up'

432
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:43,897
Ioka)', ma?'

433
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,880
"I don't exist without my mother"

434
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,816
"How can anyone be born without her?“

435
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,913
"I have a mother I am proud of absolutely"

436
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,890
"Always in all ways she protects me"

437
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,451
"I don't exist without my mother"

438
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,918
Did you hear his song, bro?

439
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,592
He's trying to get
into her good books

440
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,196
Don't ever under estimate him

441
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,662
What does he gain by singing?

442
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,665
He can only eat 'idli'
and lie on his stomach

443
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,668
We will deal with him
in the morning, sleep now

444
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,604
Good night

445
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,265
'Uncle...?'

446
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,029
Abracadabra...sleep, uncle

447
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,364
Abracadabra...go to sleep, uncle

448
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,921
"Godspeed, my precious child"

449
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,367
"Prince of fields spread wide"

450
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:50,538
"Struggle to change and crush
lofty mountains to dust"

451
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,921
“To carry out a deed glorious
why look at time auspicious?"

452
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,484
"For an upbeat heartbeat
every direction is east“

453
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,022
"Godspeed, my brave darling“

454
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,560
"Prince of fields flourishing“

455
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:22,702
"Struggle to change and crush
lofty mountains to dust"

456
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:30,919
"if river Vaigai walks carefree
green earth will spread her saree“

457
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:37,451
"if you walk, brave hero
in open fields grains grow"

458
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:42,022
"Let each of your steps
be a stride of success"

459
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:50,067
"Lord Shiva, open your 3rd eye aglow
Son, victory lies ahead for you"

460
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:59,949
"Godspeed, my righteous child
Prince of fields spread wide"

461
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,377
Where are we going, sir?

462
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,714
We have to admit
a patient in the hospital

463
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,789
- When can I go off duty?
- After the job is done

464
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,892
Let me go early, sir
Oil level is low in the van

465
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,389
As if your van will turn into
an Ambassador by filling oil

466
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,065
Drive carefully

467
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,333
This is why I don't accept
to drive for your department

468
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,704
Sir, why were you suspended?

469
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,477
You don't question me
Focus on your driving

470
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,980
Baby, come here
Pick up a slip from this

471
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,542
'Wonder who will be
the lucky winner'

472
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,089
'Where did it disappear?'

473
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,937
Sahadeva, check if Durai
is in that motor room

474
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,473
Hey! What's happening?

475
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,978
He isn't there, bro

476
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,447
The cash bag is missing

477
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,272
What the hell?

478
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,942
This is where I left the bag

479
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,389
Bro, my clothes are missing

480
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,785
Is that important now?

481
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,625
Rs 800000 is missing!

482
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,658
What do you mean
the money is missing?

483
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,830
Last night I didn't
even step out to pee

484
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,027
Don't accuse me

485
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,900
Hey! Did anyone
ask you anything?

486
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,563
Why are you digging
your own grave?

487
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,032
Who slept in that room last night?

488
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,632
I usually sleep in that room

489
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,000
Last night I slept next to mother

490
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,410
When I was asleep
he must have pinched the money

491
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,975
'Akka', where is mother?

492
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,641
She's in the kitchen

493
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:40,972
What happened?

494
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,644
What is the matter?

495
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,976
Uncle, did you see anything?

496
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,819
He took even
Rs 5000 from my shirt

497
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,019
I've been telling you so often
not to leave your shirt outside

498
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,459
Did you listen to me?

499
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,591
Hey, shut up!

500
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,591
You say your clothes are missing

501
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,887
He claims the money is missing

502
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,730
And you say the man himself is missing

503
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:58,864
What a performance!

504
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,497
Dharma told me from day 1
you are all frauds of the 1st order

505
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,740
You've stashed it somewhere
and your act can win an Oscar!

506
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,067
Watch your words, I say

507
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,671
Already I had a bad experience

508
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,710
I believed her and gave you the money
You are as bad as that fraudster

509
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,507
ls 800000 a small amount?

510
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,979
They are trying to
rob us of our money

511
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,079
(Uproar)

512
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,886
What is that ruckus?

513
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,820
- I can hear raised voices
- Let me check

514
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,121
'You have to repay my share
It is for my son's education'

515
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,928
'You thought you can cheat me?'

516
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,826
'Will you prosper in life?'

517
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,535
(raised voices)

518
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,463
'How dare you interrupt me!'

519
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,900
'I need the money
Somehow get it for me'

520
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,540
You know who I am, right?

521
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,208
So...get down

522
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,872
'We have lost all our savingsi

523
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,170
Wait, if you scream
will you get your money?

524
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,741
Have we absconded?

525
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,915
VVait...wait

526
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,686
'What will I do now?'

527
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,884
Dharma ran away
with the chit fund money

528
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,520
Okay, go and get dressed

529
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,620
Go

530
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,653
Listen, lady

531
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,985
He isn't a stranger
you don't know from Adam

532
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,223
Do you understand?

533
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,219
Don't scream

534
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,993
I take responsibility
for your money

535
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,227
Trust me

536
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,599
Don't worry
Don't shout

537
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,837
No one will deprive you
of what is rightfully yours

538
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,037
Hey, you keep quiet
I'm talking to them, right?

539
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,098
Listen to me

540
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,735
Madam, please listen to me

541
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:14,941
You have to pay us back

542
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,214
The house, all their stuff and
the people are surely enough

543
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,046
You will get your
money back for sure

544
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,017
People who trust me
go back home

545
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,110
Those who don't, stay right here
We'll come back with the money

546
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,677
Let's go

547
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,356
'Madurai'

548
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:41,864
'Just like my mother said
I was happy and relaxed here'

549
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,773
'Though I was from a poor, illiterate family
This college has made me a doctor'

550
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,802
'Our gang was always intent
on being 'ripe' with knowledge'

551
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,578
'So we were called 'Fruit' gang'

552
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:59,946
'Subhashini, Stella, Kavitha
KesavamSelvaraj and l...'

553
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,483
'...all 6 of us wanted to become
doctors of repute'

554
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,691
Hassan, stop your atrocities

555
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,662
- Atrocitiesm?
- Won't you change?

556
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,399
First year students
are our friends

557
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,259
You think these boys
are our friends?

558
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:14,399
Get to know them

559
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,329
You can get friendly

560
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,696
Prevent ragging

561
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,268
Abolish ragging

562
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,508
Get lost
Smart Alecs!

563
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,709
Only if we get rid of you
this college will prosper

564
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,944
Say 'no' to ragging

565
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,848
'We are what we are
thanks to our prof Dr Kamaraj'

566
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,393
All of us wish to get educated,
find a good job and be well settled

567
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:44,633
'But many do not wish to earn
the honest way, preferring short cuts'

568
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,528
'This is the biggest problem
we are facing in our country'

569
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,801
If every citizen is duly conscious...

570
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:50,897
...he or she can earn

571
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,931
But only hassle
it may be slightly less

572
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,843
Like the farmers
who earn in this country

573
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,708
lam from a village

574
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,381
This is the only truth
I have learnt from life's experiences

575
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,947
In this world one who removes pain
from our body is God Almighty

576
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,814
You possess that strength

577
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,256
If you don't succumb to
a luxurious life style...

578
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,962
...you can also become God!

579
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,199
I am not here
to teach you

580
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,235
But to learn along with you

581
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,018
What happened to you?

582
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,465
You've been scrutinizing
your face and figure repeatedly?

583
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,028
What happened?

584
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,598
Nothing

585
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,449
Hey Stella!
What happened?

586
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,947
Dharma, lift her

587
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,779
Go...go...go

588
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,057
Go...give us way

589
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,651
Quick...quick

590
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,898
Move...move

591
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,732
Why did you faint
all of a sudden?

592
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,801
Didn't you sleep well?

593
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,704
What happened?

594
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,742
Sir, she keeps looking at herself
in the mirror ever so often

595
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,984
I think she is scared of something

596
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,711
It's common for 2nd year students
to face this problem

597
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,014
If it's only a 2nd year syndrome,
nothing to worry

598
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,925
Our job is to
only find the disease

599
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,295
To get terrified we suffer from
all those diseases is the biggest blunder

600
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,394
DO you get it?

601
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,861
Then who will cure the patient
or give them courage?

602
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,027
When I was in 2nd year...

603
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,028
...I tried pulling the hair
from my eyebrow

604
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,439
I actually plucked 1 strand!

605
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,045
I got the shock of my life thinking
I was suffering from leprosy!

606
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,037
How did you admit her in Casualty?

607
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,572
Sir, Dharma carried her

608
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:15,612
Is that right?

609
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,386
- Where are you from?
- Theni district, Ethakovil

610
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,349
- From a village?
- Yes, sir

611
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,784
No wonder you carried her
effortlessly like a bundle of grass

612
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,989
To carry a patient,
a doctor needs to be strong

613
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,674
I think I'll propose to him

614
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,472
You fainted

615
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,375
He carried you as a friend

616
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,617
You call that love?

617
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,387
How ridiculous, Stella?

618
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,782
There were so many students
But he was the one who lifted me

619
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,418
How do you explain that?

620
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:58,785
You'll get a solid whack from me

621
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,426
Right time!

622
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:00,462
Right time!

623
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,966
- Has the class started?
- Yes

624
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,600
My God!

625
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:19,899
What happened?

626
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,543
'How can he strike out my heart?'

627
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,343
'Is it some random heart?'

628
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,589
'It's my own heart
I drew with so much love'

629
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,323
'How could he?'

630
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,319
<i>'Souk;-...</i>

631
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,787
'What is your plan now?'

632
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,523
'l intend asking him why'

633
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:41,819
'And right now'

634
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,458
'Don't confront him now
Ask him tomorrow'

635
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,944
What are you doing?

636
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,346
Watch your step
You might fall down

637
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,049
- Listen to me
- Someone might come now

638
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,417
Wail

639
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,710
Where are you off to?

640
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,991
If you have the guts
follow me

641
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,050
I'm actor Ajith's fan

642
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,461
Whatever it is
I'll ask face to face

643
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,794
I agree, you are gutsy

644
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,999
But whatever it is, let's ask him
in the class tomorrow

645
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,330
Good girl, right?

646
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,068
Let's go

647
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,539
Our trend is to ask
without postponing

648
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,267
Watch your step, Stella

649
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,513
We will be waking up all the boys
if we make too much noise

650
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,086
'Who is it?'

651
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,590
Hey! Gluttons

652
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,458
What are you doing here?

653
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:53,899
Totally tanked!

654
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,171
Why did you strike out
the hearts I drew?

655
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,833
Is it necessary to
autograph it with a 'sorry'?

656
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,972
- Tell me...?
- I don't understand

657
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,641
Is it wrong for a girl to
propose of her own accord?

658
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,506
I'm awesome, right?

659
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,109
Who told you?

660
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,617
Are you drunk?

661
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,285
Me...?

662
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,612
Okay

663
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,586
Not just you

664
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,352
Nobody in this world loves me!

665
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,527
Who told you that?

666
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,299
Everyone loves you

667
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,934
Your mother loves you

668
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,803
Your father

669
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,774
Even our Subha...!

670
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,639
- Subha, do you love me?
- Of course, I do

671
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,436
- Let's hug then
- Sure...sure

672
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,806
- Come...come
- No...no...no

673
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,681
It will be misinterpreted

674
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,654
Dharma, do you love me?

675
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,853
Is this a blood test or what
to get immediate result?

676
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,726
Yes, please tell me

677
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,754
Profess your love to me

678
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,460
My dear lady, I love you

679
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,737
- Promisem?
- I swear I love you!

680
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,228
Finish your course and graduate

681
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,405
I'll personally come
and talk to your father

682
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,802
Regarding our wedding?

683
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,811
- Yes
- Hey, come...come

684
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,012
For instant result

685
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,283
Don't let go of it

686
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,486
Catch it

687
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,958
'Okay, go back to your room
safe and sound'

688
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,528
'We have reached our room'

689
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,794
'Aiyo! Stella...!'

690
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,269
'Come along'

691
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,974
'Stop giggling for no reason'

692
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,205
Sonny, if you don't know
accept you don't

693
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,447
Just don't say no

694
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,648
What's your girl's name?

695
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:49,674
Kala

696
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,122
Like the moon in the sky...

697
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,756
...there is a Kala on earth for this guy

698
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,158
Oh! Poetry it seems!

699
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,792
You rock, 'machan'!

700
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,287
Control your emotions

701
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,861
Don't miss the mood
by getting too emotional

702
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,232
If you do then the poem
will sound so lame!

703
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,525
Okay, continue in the same mood

704
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,736
Recite it once

705
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,399
Like the moon in the sky radiant
my Kala is on earth, equivalent

706
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,198
- Yes, that sounds good
- Thanks, bro

707
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,308
Boys, where can I find
Muniyandi master?

708
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:21,310
- Muniyandi master?
- No one by that name teaches here

709
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,546
Not here

710
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,620
He has been working here for 25 years
And I know him from his childhood

711
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,654
Hey Hassan, do you know
any professor named Muniyandi?

712
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,256
I know the hotel
Muniyandi Vilas

713
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,830
- Get lost, you bloody dolt
- Greedy fellow!

714
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,360
Sir, we don't know anyone
by that name teaching here

715
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,766
Come on, you are a student here and
you don't know your own master?

716
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,306
Sir, there is no one teaching here
by the name Muniyandi

717
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:57,279
Show me all the teachers here
and I'll tell you who Muniyandi is

718
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,485
- Okay
- Come

719
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,488
Where are you going?

720
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,359
- Who?
- Professor Muniyandi

721
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,357
- Muniyandi...?
- I'll get back and tell you

722
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,722
Do you know him?

723
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,970
Sir, there is no such professor here
Tell me what's the matter

724
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,005
For the consecration
of Goddess Shaklhi temple

725
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,539
I came to collect
a donation from him

726
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,445
I can do that for you
How much is it?

727
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,506
Sonny, it's not the money

728
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,246
He is the first educated person
from our village to do well in life

729
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,076
He is so academically oriented

730
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,219
He must be here, I'm sure
Let's look for him

731
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,219
- 'If any doubts, don't hesitate
- Hey! Nluniyandi!

732
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,390
- Hey! Hello, brother
- At last

733
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,887
How is it none of your students
know you by your name?

734
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,291
They don't know me
by that name

735
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,899
My dear boy, he is
Muniyandi from our village

736
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,537
Back in his school days when he used to
dress up as MGR and perform...

737
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,407
...whistles will rent the air!

738
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,138
He is exaggerating!
Go to your class

739
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,309
He was looking for you

740
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,308
He belongs to my village
Go to your class

741
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,346
Thank you very much
I'll take leave then

742
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,974
Thank you very much
I'll take leave then

743
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,477
- Muthu...Muthamma
- What?

744
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:06,613
Te a

745
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,919
Did you make the sweet?

746
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,317
It was a little too sweet

747
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,095
Bro, you're a natural flirt!

748
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,226
I've been following her
for a long time, doctor

749
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,056
She isn't falling one bit

750
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,430
You don't fall flat
Better to watch your step

751
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,102
Stella, you got out of your fear?

752
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,170
Sir, her fear vanished
into thin air right away

753
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,302
Sir, tea

754
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,040
Batted without a guard
And he got hurl!

755
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,121
Hey! Don't let your tongue run

756
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,285
Sir, I have a doubt

757
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,117
Go ahead

758
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,656
Muniyandi is your nick name, right?

759
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,430
Muniyandi is my original name

760
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,739
My dad passed away
when I was very young

761
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,763
My village was part of
Ramanathapuram district

762
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,708
Farming depended
only on rainfall

763
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,679
My mother knew nothing
but agriculture

764
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,579
I was 5 years old then

765
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,141
So hungry I would bring
the roof down it seems

766
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,750
That was when my mother found out
the Govt school provided mid-day meals

767
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:19,057
She enrolled me in that school
knowing I would be well fed at least

768
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,358
I went to school basically to eat

769
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:24,222
In the bargain
I ended up becoming a doctor

770
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:29,196
The mid-day meal scheme was initialed
by the ruling Chief minister Kamaraj

771
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,063
I didn't know back then

772
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,499
I found out much later

773
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,436
I took up his name to
ensure I never forget him

774
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,713
Later on I changed my name
in the Gazette as well officially

775
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,709
No matter how well qualified
a doctor I am...

776
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:49,782
...I'll always be known as
Muniyandi to my villagers, right?

777
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,722
- Hey! Kamaraj sir
- Oh! Kamaraj sir, huh?

778
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,532
Don't you know his name?
Just watch now

779
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,071
Muniyandi

780
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,307
'How's that?'

781
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,756
Hey! Dharman

782
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,665
Don't call him
He'll kill us with his poetry

783
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,471
'Ignore him, or else
you'll put him on a pedestal'

784
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,481
Who was the one who referred
to our sir as Muniyandi?

785
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,444
Isn't that his name?
How else to call him?

786
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,683
Ouch! My hand

787
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,248
Aaah! It's paining

788
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,493
What's the problem?

789
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,459
Don't know
Some fight I guess

790
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:16,202
Hey! Dharma, I'm your friend Arijit
I recited your poem and my love worked ou-

791
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,481
(grimacing in pain)

792
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,132
You are making a mistake
I won't spare you

793
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,982
Don't, Dharma

794
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,219
(grunts in pain)

795
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,395
Dharmamthafs enough
Leave him alone

796
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,420
'Dharma
Leave him'

797
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,161
Stop it

798
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,903
Come on, Dharma

799
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,302
Gomjust g0

800
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,081
Sir, if my parents get to know
it will become a major issue

801
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,314
Don't tell anyone at home

802
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,948
I'll take care

803
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,150
What happened, doctor?

804
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,886
Don't really know
what happened, doctor

805
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,985
But it turned into a nasty brawl

806
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:48,167
First of all for a surgery, get used to
holding a knife with steady hands

807
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,336
I'm really disappointed

808
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,174
I didn't expect this
from you at all

809
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,871
Apologize to Hassan

810
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,239
Excuse me, sir, actually
it was Hassan's fault

811
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,978
Dharma hit him
because he teased you

812
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,079
First ask Hassan to
apologize to you

813
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,297
Sir, Dharmadurai isn't the violent kind

814
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,859
Even the college magazine
features his poem on peace

815
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,198
Hassan, like Subha said
apologize to sir first

816
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,496
Stella...!

817
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:34,343
So the doctor writes a poem on peace
But breaks someone's head as well, huh?

818
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,310
Apologize to him

819
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,245
I'm sorry

820
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,290
Hassan, I'm really sorry

821
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,610
- Come here
- I'll be back

822
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,486
We need to talk to you
Can you come to the police station?

823
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,721
Watchman 'anna', we need to
visit the staff quarters urgently

824
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,354
- Can we please go?
- Get back soon

825
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:46,117
What happened?
At this time of night?

826
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,446
Can't you focus
on your studies alone?

827
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,549
I intend filing a case on you
for 'attempt to murder'

828
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:52,549
It will drag on for 2 years

829
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,321
You can't continue your
MBBS course hereafter

830
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,266
Better get yourself
a good lawyer

831
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,266
Do you know the clout
that boy's family has?

832
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,268
Do you know the clout
that boy's family has?

833
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:05,531
Does it make sense for all the students
to go around announcing 'I am a rowdy'?

834
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,451
Go straight, please

835
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,090
All this is very common
in a student's life

836
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,922
Today they will fight
They will gang up tomorrow

837
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,495
He shouldn't have hit your son

838
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:37,460
He feels bad about it, I know
Please don't file any case on him

839
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,441
He is the first doctor from
a very backward village

840
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,179
Please be magnanimous

841
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:49,373
Sir, he has hit my son on his head
What if his skull had cracked?

842
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:50,874
<i>Sake</i>

843
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,183
Nothing drastic has happened
Neither will it happen

844
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,448
I take full responsibility

845
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,552
After all both of them
are my students

846
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:05,260
Sir, Dharman, Hassan
We are all classmates

847
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:11,164
I apologize to you
on his behalf

848
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,273
Sir, how can I see
if I wear a helmet at night?

849
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,377
Hey! Come along

850
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,316
Bro, thanks a lot

851
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,610
Bro, I was so scared
I didn't know what to do

852
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,891
Our Kamaraj sir went
to Hassan's house

853
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,625
Hey! What's up?

854
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,931
Today even I'm excited

855
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,204
Because we are expecting
the semester results

856
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,029
I'm not worried
about any of you

857
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:50,073
But that chap who keeps laughing
Selvaraj, I'm worried for him

858
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,080
Those 2 girls were really brave

859
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,181
They rushed here
not minding the late hour

860
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,124
How about a cup of coffee?

861
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,586
Come along

862
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,666
Hi gluttons

863
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,068
We wanted to come
to the police station

864
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,039
Sir said you had left

865
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,481
Will we leave you
high and dry?

866
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:32,752
Tell me

867
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,491
- My dear gluttons!
- Yes, idiot

868
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,397
Hey! Shouldn't we be in class now?

869
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,668
Let's go

870
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,365
- Shall we go?
- Let's go

871
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,005
Let me drop you
at your hostel

872
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,368
Get ready soon and
come to our classroom

873
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:27,304
"I am a piece of paper adrift in the breeze"

874
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,505
Can I borrow your bike
for a minute?

875
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,910
Bro, it isn't mine...all yours

876
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,202
Thanks, man

877
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:40,013
"A smile as addiction
is my only religion"

878
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:45,986
"In my life, flower or thorn
Both are welcome"

879
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,957
"Always awesome“

880
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:55,029
Dark or fair isn't priority
Shoulder responsibility

881
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,236
Poetry. . .what lines!

882
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:20,188
“L was born in a remote village
My knowledge was honed in college“

883
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,392
Bro, where did you
find this old man?

884
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,461
Teacher from Virudhunagar
has donated his organs

885
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:31,728
"We dissected bodies
without being ill at ease“

886
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:38,235
“We didn't know to unseal
what the heart could conceal“

887
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:44,347
"I am a piece of paper in the wind afloat“

888
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:50,621
"In the hands of God I'm a work of art“

889
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,475
Dear students,
as a role model...

890
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,350
...Subhashini has volunteered
for organ donation

891
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:26,486
"Many a first love here
Multiple love-flops every year"

892
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:32,626
“Scars here that appear
Life's justification loud and clear"

893
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:38,629
“lf someone asked me
what my final wish would be"

894
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:45,302
"I would say when I am old and bent
I want to rejoin here as a student“

895
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:51,381
"A student am I
To-be doctor and wise guy"

896
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:57,648
“To serve people
is my mission possible"

897
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:03,989
"Seeing bodies diseased
as a shrine sacred"

898
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:10,300
"To treat right
God's oversight“

899
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:14,131
"Champion
Custodian"

900
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:21,211
"A medical student am I
To-be doctor, simple guy"

901
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:44,103
'I will be the flower if you are a plant
I will be the moon if you are the sky vast'

902
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,498
'l will be the body if you are my soul intact'

903
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:19,039
Dear students, thanks to the tax paid by
poor, uneducated farmers and laborers...

904
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,275
...all of you have studied
to become doctors

905
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,273
The people of this country
have educated you through their toil

906
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,481
You are indebted to them
You shouldn't forget them

907
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:34,580
As a means of thanking them,
there are many poor villages in India

908
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:39,023
People there await you
with pain and sorrow

909
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,591
You should offer
your medical service to them

910
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,192
I have been a strict disciplinarian

911
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,025
I might have hurl you
on many occasions

912
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:52,101
Treat me as a friend
and forget such moments

913
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,210
I'm also retiring this year

914
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,314
A doctor has to work
till his last breath

915
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,452
No rest at all

916
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:09,946
My young doctors

917
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:14,251
...my heartfelt wishes
for your bright future

918
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,339
Do visit the college
once in a while

919
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,132
You call what you did as 'dance'?

920
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,672
Go have a blast, bro

921
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,737
You rocked, man

922
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,112
- Hey! Hassan
- Don't act smart with me

923
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:47,127
Dharma, remember you told me when
we were in 2nd year, I've now graduated

924
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:51,660
Now I don't know whether
you'll come over and talk to my dad

925
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,625
But I'll always be
thinking of your visit

926
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,401
- You'll come, right?
- Definitely

927
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,334
- You should come
- I will

928
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,300
Take care
Godspeed

929
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,361
I wanted to
tell you something

930
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,660
Tell me

931
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,562
I forgot

932
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,714
I want to see you
being happy always

933
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,076
'Give him a breather'

934
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,201
Don't apply oil, grandma

935
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,244
I'll be back

936
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,675
Hey, where are you going?

937
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,474
- To the bathroom
- Wait, I'll come with you

938
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,846
I don't want to pee now

939
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,923
Hey, you can control, right?

940
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,289
Hey, you can control, right?

941
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,391
Won't embarrass me I hope

942
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,423
Keep quiet

943
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,667
'Gopal, tell me the truth
I'll drop you right here'

944
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,441
Won't I tell you if I knew?

945
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:15,771
Won't I tell you if I knew?

946
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,838
You've been wandering from morning
on an empty stomach with a vengeance

947
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,781
Stop at a hotel

948
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,615
Alex, stop near a road side eatery

949
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,717
Having decided to stop, do so
where they serve country chicken

950
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,956
I believe if you eat country chicken,
your life will run smooth on oiled wheels

951
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:32,516
I believe if you eat country chicken,
your life will run smooth on oiled wheels

952
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,726
That reminds me,
my vehicle needs oil

953
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:35,752
You can fuel it later

954
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,426
If you keep wagging your tongue
they will both pummel you!

955
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,167
'Awww! Don't hit me'

956
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:42,834
'- It hurts
- Don't hit'

957
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,168
'I'm the eldest son
Don't hit me on my head'

958
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,735
'My mother thinks it is a bad omen'

959
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,473
He's our only evidence
If you kill him, you'll be in a soup

960
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,475
He's our only evidence
If you kill him, you'll be in a soup

961
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:50,903
Don't use violence
in my vehicle, sir

962
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,435
Can't deal with court and case

963
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,373
We have better hideouts for it!

964
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,911
Sir knows a doctor named Kesavan

965
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,716
He'll frequently visit him

966
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,415
I don't believe a word
of what you said

967
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:04,754
Dharman is not like that

968
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,425
We were 6 of us in our gang

969
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,888
Of which 3 were girls

970
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,695
None of us are in touch
with each other now

971
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,528
Maybe he has gone to meet
one of our college staff or professors

972
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:16,565
<i>Wham?</i>

973
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,272
He may have gone to meet
our college staff

974
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,507
See if that works

975
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:21,667
See if that works

976
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,740
If I get to hear something,
I will keep you posted

977
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,272
Seeing the flustered state you are in
there's more to it than meets the eye

978
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,209
Please tread carefully

979
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,644
Nothing like that
Don't worry

980
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,544
We'll take care

981
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,515
- We'll take leave
- Let's go

982
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,620
Who is it?

983
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,664
Who are you?

984
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,534
Bro, how are you doing?

985
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,567
I don't recognize you

986
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:54,540
Are you Andipatti doctor?

987
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,803
Are you Andipatti doctor?

988
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,576
I'm Dharmadurai

989
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,847
Wasn't this your classroom?

990
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,646
This room is no longer in use

991
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,812
By the way
why are you here?

992
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,718
I need a favor

993
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,286
2 girls studied with me

994
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,055
Stella and Subhashini
I need their address

995
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,785
Stella and Subhashini
I need their address

996
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:13,817
Checked Facebook, Twitter and Google

997
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,193
My other friends also have no clue
Please help me

998
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,227
You're the first person
who celebrated my birthday

999
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,665
I can get the details from inside

1000
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,836
Why do you need it?

1001
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,778
Both of them always
wished me well

1002
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,276
Stella and Subhashini

1003
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,613
I want to meet them, bro

1004
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,302
Thanks, bro

1005
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:59,235
I still have 10 more years of service

1006
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,605
If my superiors find out
I gave you this information...

1007
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:01,607
If my superiors find out
I gave you this information...

1008
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,274
...I'll lose my job

1009
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,473
That will never happen
Don't even worry about it

1010
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:07,880
Bro...?

1011
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,816
- How is Muthamma doing?
- She has 2 kids now

1012
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,377
Super, bro, very good

1013
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,714
I'm not her husband!

1014
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,122
Why are you raking up the past
and adding salt to my wound?

1015
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:17,521
Why are you raking up the past
and adding salt to my wound?

1016
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,520
Okay, forget I asked
Give me the bag

1017
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,455
- Why is it so heavy?
- My clothes and books are in it

1018
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,855
- I won't take any money
- Just keep it

1019
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,298
- Shall I leave?
- Okay, sir

1020
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,966
Shall I take leave?
Bye, bro

1021
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:29,595
What did he want?

1022
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,572
Mr Dharma came

1023
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,675
Went around the campus

1024
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,443
Any problem, sir?

1025
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,673
Did he carry anything with him?

1026
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,584
He was carrying a bag

1027
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,854
Before he left he gave me
1000 bucks for expenses

1028
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,685
Tell me what it is about

1029
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,318
Nothingmhe took
some money from home

1030
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,859
If he comes back here, will you
please ask him to call this number?

1031
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,293
- I'll certainly inform you
- Thank you

1032
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:05,168
Look at his audacity, uncle
Donating our money to a stranger

1033
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,201
Let's find him first

1034
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:06,671
Hey! Mr Evidence...!

1035
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,299
Hey! Mr Evidence...!

1036
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,208
Even you are like them

1037
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:11,705
Won't you call me by my name?

1038
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,703
Then your name isn't Evidence?

1039
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,705
I thought like Alwyn and Edwin...

1040
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,548
...Evidence is also a Christian name!

1041
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,682
Get in
Let's go

1042
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:23,187
'Kodaikanal'

1043
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,190
'Kodaikanal'

1044
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:56,221
'Will we leave you
high and dry?'

1045
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,191
'Will we leave you
high and dry?'

1046
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,386
'Tell me'

1047
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,129
I'm Stella's classmate
Dharmadurai, sir

1048
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,235
I've heard about you
from my daughter

1049
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,705
Please come in

1050
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:18,970
ls Stella here?

1051
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,538
She has gone to the clinic

1052
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,575
Shall we talk it over
and fix it finally?

1053
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,579
- Sir...?
- Please sit down

1054
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,191
My daughter's most repeated line

1055
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,154
'Dharman will come'

1056
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,594
She even asked me to contact you

1057
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,831
But I advised her to wait

1058
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,329
Today you are here in person

1059
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,791
I can't believe it

1060
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,169
When can I fix the wedding?

1061
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:48,698
L...er

1062
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,609
Are you attached
to any clinic?

1063
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,812
You don't look like
you have a regular practice

1064
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,710
You shouldn't give it up

1065
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,344
Otherwise you'll forget medicine

1066
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,752
I learnt from my professor
to swim against the tide, sir

1067
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:02,286
Won't forget it till I die

1068
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,449
Won't forget it till I die

1069
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,623
Stella also got an offer
to work abroad

1070
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,364
But she refused to go

1071
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,827
She said her professor won't like it

1072
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:18,803
After a long time I feel
I've meta 100% honest man

1073
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,465
After a long time I feel
I've meta 100% honest man

1074
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,868
'I am with you
to protect you'

1075
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,321
My daughter died in a car accident

1076
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:35,685
My daughter died in a car accident

1077
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,826
She told me you'll definitely come
to ask me if you can marry her

1078
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,489
Not too many people here
know she has passed away

1079
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,288
You wouldn't have known either

1080
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,834
You're the man
my daughter fell in love with

1081
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:49,097
Which means...

1082
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,734
...you are my son-in-law

1083
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,670
Doctor, it's evident you are
disturbed about something

1084
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,372
Whatever it is, you must
get it out of your system

1085
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,147
I'm ready to help you
in whatever way possible

1086
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,869
"Without greed, a tongue that doesn't slander"

1087
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,533
"Without greed, a tongue that doesn't slander"

1088
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,500
"A blameless life untainted in sinful mire"

1089
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,037
'Thenkasi.

1090
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:39,410
“Harmony that dwells contented
in the heart of the good hearted"

1091
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,385
“With folded hands I surrender complete
to Lord Viswanathan of Kasi's golden feet“

1092
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:45,722
“With folded hands I surrender complete
to Lord Viswanathan of Kasi's golden feet“

1093
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:53,724
(devotional song on Lord Shiva)

1094
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,073
Tell me, bro

1095
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,771
Isn't there anyone
in this house?

1096
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:09,112
That Telugu lady sold
the house and moved out

1097
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,145
Someone from Nagercoil has bought it

1098
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,510
Where is the previous owner?

1099
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,920
Her daughter is working at
Dr Vallal Kalanjiyam's hospital

1100
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:15,648
Her daughter is working at
Dr Vallal Kalanjiyam's hospital

1101
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,124
I work as the watchman here

1102
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,093
Not watchman
You are watchwoman

1103
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,515
- I must see the scan reports
- Okay, doctor

1104
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:47,952
- Also check her weight
- Sure, doctor

1105
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:48,750
- Also check her weight
- Sure, doctor

1106
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,761
A person named Dharmadurai
has come to meet you

1107
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,595
I asked him regarding what
and he said 'personal'

1108
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,089
- I'll be there
- Okay, doctor

1109
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,294
What did she say?

1110
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,469
She is coming

1111
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:04,595
She is coming

1112
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,094
- Receptionist
- What. . .?

1113
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,066
This is a hospital

1114
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,500
Don't yell

1115
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:10,609
Switch on the fan

1116
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,100
There's a power outage

1117
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,311
No electricity

1118
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,707
- Are these lights running on battery?
- What...?

1119
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,476
From the moment he entered...

1120
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,986
...he has been bombarding me
with unnecessary questions

1121
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:21,111
...he has been bombarding me
with unnecessary questions

1122
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,616
I think he's drunk

1123
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,818
Is he related to you, doctor?

1124
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,163
Dr Dharmadurai

1125
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,251
It's getting late for me

1126
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,019
- When will they come?
- Are you asking me?

1127
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:54,417
- When will they come?
- Are you asking me?

1128
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,919
- I am talking to myself
- Oh! Thinking aloud, huh?

1129
01:16:58,513 --> 01:16:59,583
I feel sorry for you

1130
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:00,525
- Got stuck with this lot
- Wretched fellow!

1131
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:01,857
- Got stuck with this lot
- Wretched fellow!

1132
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,535
Hey! Hold on

1133
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:10,696
Hey! Hold on

1134
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:12,734
Won't you reverse carefully?

1135
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:13,733
What happened?

1136
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,633
Aiyo! Look at my plight

1137
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,912
I brought a patient to the hospital
and you made me a patient!

1138
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,610
You insisted on fuelling the van
and fueled him to break his limbs

1139
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,817
- Liftmlifl him
- Come...move

1140
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,627
- Hello!
- Hey! Subha

1141
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,801
How did you become like this?

1142
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,309
During the day in the reception!

1143
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,078
That too you are a doctor

1144
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,110
I didn't expect this of you

1145
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,810
I was under the assumption
you are doing well

1146
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,085
I lost touch with everyone
after I got married

1147
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,109
I lost touch with everyone
after I got married

1148
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,151
What can I ask
and to whom?

1149
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,350
When did you get
into this new habit?

1150
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,183
Addicted already?

1151
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,695
I sent you my wedding invitation

1152
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,721
It was returned to me

1153
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,101
How did you become like this?

1154
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:16,601
Subha, where is your husband?

1155
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,128
Subha, where is your husband?

1156
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,139
He lives in Hyderabad

1157
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,138
He comes down only once
every 2 months

1158
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,140
He's also a doctor

1159
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:30,173
I don't want you to get
into any mess because of me

1160
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,179
That's why I asked

1161
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,450
Isn't your mother at home?

1162
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,191
Are you all in touch
with me to inform you?

1163
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,270
Coffee

1164
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,443
Why are you looking so different?

1165
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,643
Are you practicing or not?

1166
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:02,841
Are you married?

1167
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,441
Where is your wife?

1168
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,678
I don't even know
where Stella is!

1169
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,880
Did you meet Kavitha?

1170
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,716
She was going to France
She mailed me

1171
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,217
I replied too

1172
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,155
I didn't get any response after that

1173
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,898
There are many ways
to stay in touch

1174
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,666
We all became engrossed
in our work, house etc, right?

1175
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,169
We all became engrossed
in our work, house etc, right?

1176
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,363
What happened to you?

1177
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:27,765
Nothing

1178
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,266
I was pampered a lot at home

1179
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,503
So I was really spoilt

1180
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,373
Look at me and talk

1181
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,183
You came in search of me, right?

1182
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,811
You came in search of me, right?

1183
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,352
You came looking for me

1184
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,652
Look at my face and talk

1185
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,251
You thought you could lie?

1186
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,528
Serve me a good bone

1187
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,298
Wail, I'll serve

1188
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,433
Serve some more
mutton pieces, my dear

1189
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,038
Don't hog all the meat

1190
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,538
Tomorrow...

1191
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,014
If a robber tries to snatch my jewelry...

1192
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,544
...I need strength to
hit him back, right?

1193
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,250
Shut up and just serve more meat

1194
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:45,284
Shut up and just serve more meat

1195
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,054
- Acting over smart!
- Serving only bones

1196
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:51,490
Nobody to question you, right?
So you let your tongue run

1197
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,422
I bought this cell phone
by borrowing money

1198
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:57,697
And I get messages
asking me to buy more

1199
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,256
Hey! Come here

1200
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,259
<i>Come</i>

1201
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:01,766
Go

1202
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:01,995
Go

1203
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,997
Go sit there

1204
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,033
Go, my dear lady

1205
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,336
- What do you want?
- I want to meet the doctor

1206
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,737
Want to consult immediately
or after an hour?

1207
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,474
Want to see him now
It's urgent

1208
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,611
Talk softly

1209
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:16,639
I'm standing right here

1210
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,282
I must see him immediately

1211
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:18,545
I must see him immediately

1212
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,447
Want to meet him now?

1213
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,455
I have to drink tea

1214
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,487
Look at your token number

1215
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:28,226
What is your token number?

1216
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:30,722
Bro, here you go

1217
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,495
Tea is only 8 bucks
but you've given 20?

1218
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,324
Buy some snacks along with tea

1219
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,694
You have a heart of gold

1220
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,603
Go, take a seal
I'll be right back

1221
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:39,663
I'll get the doctor for you

1222
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:41,071
Wail, we'll meet the doctor

1223
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,467
Patients are waiting, sir

1224
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,745
You are so sincere
even in your CRRI internship

1225
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,771
Why don't you take up
a Govt post as doctor?

1226
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,614
Mr Gopal

1227
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,108
I don't have money power
to buy any posting

1228
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,217
I'll serve my villagers back home

1229
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,620
Sir, these people came first

1230
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,219
Good morning

1231
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,785
Morning

1232
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,362
What is your problem?

1233
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,428
Name Kaluvayi
70 years old

1234
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:07,791
Suffering from indigestion

1235
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,428
Is that right?

1236
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:10,702
What did you eat?

1237
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:11,795
Went for a feast

1238
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,534
They ate all the meat
like they won't see another day!

1239
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,274
What is your name?

1240
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,770
Veerayi
Age 68

1241
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,639
- All of you have the same problem?
- Yes, doctor

1242
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:27,484
You think this is a center
to distribute digestive tablets?

1243
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,622
You've lined up here instead of chewing
betel leaves after feasting on the meat?

1244
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,828
So you've eaten one full lamb, right?

1245
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,161
You must go slow on meat
because of your age

1246
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,398
Okay, sir

1247
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,828
- Same medicine for everyone
- Okay, sir

1248
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,837
What is your problem?
Tell the doctor

1249
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,364
My name is Anbuselvi, age 24

1250
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:48,834
Kamakapatli is my village

1251
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,435
I feel very tired

1252
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,177
Prescribe a tonic
for additional nutrition

1253
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,640
Are you the agent
for these oldies?

1254
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:55,671
Not really, bro

1255
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,582
When my mother was unwell...

1256
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,146
...I was a kid

1257
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,749
I didn't know how
to get to the hospital

1258
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,653
I couldn't save my mother

1259
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,680
So whoever is unwell in the village...

1260
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,126
...I rush them at once
to the hospital

1261
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:08,693
Here you go

1262
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,686
This is for you

1263
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,460
And this is for your friends

1264
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,392
Let's go, grandma

1265
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,532
Wait for your turn
He will attend to you

1266
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,202
Watch your step

1267
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,437
Please go

1268
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:21,466
Bro...?

1269
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,798
Don't mistake me

1270
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:25,300
I don't understand
what you've written

1271
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,476
Is it for you to read?

1272
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,815
- Mr Gopal
- Sorry again!

1273
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,409
- Tell me
- Bro...?

1274
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:32,616
Take a look

1275
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,511
It looks like some doodle
you've scribbled

1276
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:35,810
I've studied until 10th grade

1277
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,483
Even I'm unable to read this

1278
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:41,226
Somehow a doctor's handwriting
is always a puzzle, bro!

1279
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,427
Please write legibly

1280
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,721
I've rewritten everything in Tamil

1281
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,230
Thank you, bro

1282
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:55,065
Did you call me, bro?

1283
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,101
See you

1284
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,415
Sir, shall we see
the other patients?

1285
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,945
Find out about Anbuselvi
and her family details

1286
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,118
Is she that beautiful?

1287
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,983
Beauty is beyond features
and fair complexion

1288
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,660
Actions speak louder than appearance

1289
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,929
I can't enter the thick skull of someone
who takes bribes from all my patients!

1290
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,968
Thank you so much
for your dig at me!

1291
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,965
Hello, Anbuselvi

1292
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,676
- Bought the medicines?
- Yes, I did

1293
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,544
If you need any snacks just buy

1294
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,571
Who is your father in Kamakapalti?

1295
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,176
Policeman Paraman's daughter

1296
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,419
Buy whatever you want
You don't have to pay

1297
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,982
Why, b r0?

1298
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,516
Time for a change!

1299
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:44,581
Your doctor is coming

1300
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,991
Note it down in my account

1301
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:51,020
Sir, got them refreshments
in my account at the tea stall

1302
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,562
Just because I take a tenner as bribe,
don't take action against me

1303
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,592
I have a family to take care of

1304
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,266
I'll take leave, bro

1305
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,541
Come...welcome

1306
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,116
'Akka', they have come in 2 cars

1307
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,117
Please come
How are you?

1308
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:57,719
Let's go

1309
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,468
When you have Vaigai river close to you...

1310
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,569
...you've come in search
of this forest river

1311
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,564
That's what puzzles me

1312
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,135
My daughter has studied
only up to 10th grade

1313
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,071
Your son is a doctor

1314
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,279
Will this alliance work out?

1315
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,072
It will all be fine

1316
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:18,282
They like each other, no?

1317
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,746
That's why we came
looking for you all this way

1318
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,154
Anbu, serve tea for everyone

1319
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:33,598
Give them

1320
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,034
What is your name, my dear?

1321
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,400
Anbuselvi

1322
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:45,537
As if our old lady
doesn't know her name

1323
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,537
She's just testing
if the bride can hear!

1324
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:51,041
Tea for me

1325
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,559
I have seen this girl somewhere

1326
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:05,393
Have you come for
the 100 Days Work scheme?

1327
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:07,166
I don't send her
to work anywhere

1328
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:10,129
Only to the cucumber garden
near the Vaigai dam

1329
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,699
Go inside, dear

1330
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,731
I'd like to tell you once more

1331
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,642
My daughter is just a 10th grader

1332
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,468
The groom is a doctor

1333
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:22,213
I doubt if I can meet
your high expectations

1334
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,244
I'll do the best I can afford

1335
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:25,916
We don't expect anything

1336
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:27,750
Your daughter will be our asset

1337
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,547
All in the game of love
Our hands are tied

1338
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,416
Ask your daughter
if she is agreeable

1339
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,993
Mr Gopal, our driver
is all by himself there

1340
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,298
Go and chat with him

1341
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,298
I anticipated this

1342
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,998
This is way beyond our means

1343
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,069
I'll lift you up
with all my strength

1344
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:55,905
Spread your wings
Fly and be happy, dear

1345
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:57,649
Pa?

1346
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,416
I want to talk to him

1347
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:05,183
Che Kumara! Start the car
and switch on the air-conditioner

1348
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,323
Did you discuss politics?
They've chased you away?

1349
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:08,685
I spoke the truth, man

1350
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,992
Truth should be told depending
on place, subject, person!

1351
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,698
Don't preach to me
Start the car

1352
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,559
Er...nothing serious

1353
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:20,300
My daughter wants
to talk to you alone

1354
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,040
I'll go talk to her

1355
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,340
Hey! Why are you in a rush?

1356
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:26,543
I'll be back in a jiffy

1357
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:30,414
Go to the rear portion
Meet my mother also

1358
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,013
Poor thing!
She's quite immobile

1359
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,150
Get her blessings

1360
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,766
I called you 'bro'
at the hospital

1361
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,307
I feel bad about that

1362
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:02,471
You are my fiancé now

1363
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:07,843
Who is this?

1364
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,720
My grandma

1365
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,452
Grandma?

1366
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,293
Can I marry your granddaughter?

1367
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:19,326
May you be always happy, my dear boy

1368
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:22,324
I'll take leave

1369
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:32,843
Hello, Anbu?

1370
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,278
Heard you're getting married

1371
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:35,309
Ignoring me right royally

1372
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:36,604
Hello, 'akka'

1373
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,142
Thanks, 'ka

1374
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,646
- Sit down
- It's okay

1375
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,382
Don't make a fuss, sit

1376
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:47,586
Your recipe on cucumber chutney
in 'Rani' magazine was too good

1377
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:48,622
Keep writing

1378
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:49,424
Thanks, 'ka

1379
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:50,718
The groom is a doctor it seems

1380
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:51,663
Yes, 'ka

1381
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:53,131
He belongs to our community

1382
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:54,798
They came forward
with this alliance

1383
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,728
Which is the venue?

1384
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,135
We wanted to perform
the wedding in our temple

1385
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,534
But many of his classmates
will be attending the function

1386
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,469
We wanted to celebrate
in a grand manner

1387
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:07,610
My father is trying to fix
Muthuvel wedding hall

1388
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,609
That may turn out very expensive?

1389
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,508
Can't worry about all that, 'ka

1390
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,513
We will also look
dignified in their eyes

1391
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,879
They will also be comfortable

1392
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,780
Okay, come in

1393
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,622
Come inside, Anbu

1394
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,456
This is for you

1395
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,460
- It's okay, 'ka
- Don't refuse

1396
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,496
Our village policeman's daughter

1397
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:33,466
Plus my favorite writer
Anbuselvi from Kamakapatti

1398
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:36,503
Won't we celebrate your wedding
with pomp and splendor?

1399
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,607
Take 'kumkum'

1400
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,472
He has come in search of you
knowing your background

1401
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:46,581
Take good care of him, okay?

1402
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,027
See you, 'ka

1403
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:00,291
1 minute, can I have
a word with you?

1404
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:05,468
Is it wrong for the groom to meet
the bride before the wedding?

1405
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,104
My friend wanted this clarified

1406
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:09,801
He asked you to find out, huh?

1407
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,709
Oh no! Not your son

1408
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,443
Shouldn't go normally
It isn't right

1409
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,475
But no harm

1410
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,150
Sir, enjoY

1411
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:23,649
I can't accompany you

1412
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,391
What's up, dear?

1413
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,096
It's my birthday

1414
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:33,364
HEP'

1415
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,323
Gopal, today is her birthday

1416
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:37,227
Is that so?
Bless you, dear

1417
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:38,697
Gopal, it seems
today is her birthday

1418
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,797
Let me eat this first, sir

1419
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,201
Tastes good

1420
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,703
Gopal, it seems
today is her birthday

1421
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:45,268
I don't understand, sir

1422
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:47,375
GOPAL, TODAY IS HER BIRTHDAY!

1423
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,442
I got it at last, sir!

1424
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:49,510
Shall we go up?

1425
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,181
Zip Zip zoom!

1426
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:56,553
Your father-in-law's house
could have been at a hilltop

1427
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:58,714
Who is it?

1428
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:00,283
Hello, aunt

1429
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:02,117
Good afternoon, Gopal 'anna'

1430
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:03,622
Your birthday, huh?

1431
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,189
Who is the guest, Anbu?

1432
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:08,330
Grandma, my fiancé is here

1433
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:10,193
The groom should not visit us
before the wedding, dear

1434
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:12,630
We didn't want to
break your custom

1435
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:15,164
But the situation was such
we had to bend a little

1436
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:16,669
Today is your groom's niece's birthday

1437
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,542
She insisted on giving candy
to her new aunt, what a tantrum!

1438
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,211
Rolled on the floor crying

1439
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:22,207
I didn't do-

1440
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:23,140
Okay...okay

1441
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:27,249
If you miss the car at 2:00 p.m
you may have to spend the night here

1442
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,749
We've come in our bike

1443
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,155
We'll drink tea
and leave very soon

1444
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,720
So don't worry

1445
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:34,689
<i>Come</i>

1446
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,559
Grandma, don't worry

1447
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,421
Okay

1448
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:39,823
Come in

1449
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:56,980
The shelves are lined with old books

1450
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:05,750
My dear, won't you sell
all these books to a vendor?

1451
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,055
You can mint money

1452
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:11,228
I write tidbits for magazines

1453
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:14,227
The library is nearby
I borrow books and read

1454
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,332
I send tips on farming
and recipes to magazines

1455
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,366
They pay me Rs 100 to Rs 500

1456
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,638
What is your professional name?

1457
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:22,266
Kamakapatli Anbuselvi

1458
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,372
Hey! Is that you?

1459
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:26,542
You are pretty famous

1460
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:29,480
Sir, you are marrying
a renowned writer

1461
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:36,382
But I'll gobble all the chocolates
with the wrapper!

1462
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:46,090
Do you really think
I'll be the right match for you?

1463
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,661
Only you will be Ms Right for me

1464
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:49,361
Really?

1465
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:55,298
I swear on myself

1466
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:17,129
"The wind blowing into Andipatti
brings in so much gaiely"

1467
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:21,695
"This fiancée of mine makes my head heady"

1468
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:28,466
"This petite girl pretty belle
Did not trust me fully“

1469
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:35,237
"Even when I swore so true
your fear shadows you"

1470
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:41,311
“With your charm and title
you'll catch a fair match to settle“

1471
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:46,490
"Why did you trap me?
This poor little Anbuselvi?"

1472
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:52,424
"A foreigner will abandon me
when my wallet gets empty"

1473
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:58,602
"She will sell cucumber even
Turn my home into Heaven"

1474
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:16,779
“To get married
formally we have agreed“

1475
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:22,293
"Keep your distance please
Do not break your promise“

1476
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:28,761
"if I caress you, just a bit
will Goonda Act apply, is it?"

1477
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:34,228
"Will the fox that teases the crab rest?“

1478
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:40,474
“My golden prickly acacia flower
You have no blotch or blemish whatsoever"

1479
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:47,549
“I'll tie the yellow sacred thread
Girl, on your chest will rest my head"

1480
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,400
- Tidbit Selvi, how are you?
- I'm fine, sir

1481
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:07,399
Sign here

1482
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,266
Congratulations
Heard you're engaged

1483
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,339
Yes, sir
He's standing out

1484
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,044
Won't he come in?

1485
01:36:14,335 --> 01:36:17,214
- He isn't literate?
- He's a doctor, sir

1486
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:46,669
“Will that day dawn, tell me?
Can neem oil become ghee?"

1487
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:52,277
"How can this mermaid be
suspicious of the sea?"

1488
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:58,819
"Will this poor girl be taken for a ride?“

1489
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:04,695
"I'll gift myself to you, my dear bride?“

1490
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:10,826
"I called all the men in town 'brother"'

1491
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:16,467
"Only you from now I call as 'dear' however"

1492
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:18,837
Look how she's showing off!

1493
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,746
This is called 'Skin care',
you ignorant woman!

1494
01:37:29,577 --> 01:37:35,289
"The wind blowing into Andipatti
brings in so much gaiely"

1495
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:39,656
"This fiancée of mine makes my head heady"

1496
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:46,567

“With your charm and title
you'll catch a fair match to settle“

1499
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:00,784
"Why did you trap me?
This poor little Anbuselvi?"

1500
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:04,551
"Why did you trap me?
This poor little Anbuselvi?"

1501
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:10,454
"A foreigner will abandon me
when my wallet gets empty"

1502
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:16,827

1504
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:28,671
"This fiancée of mine makes my head heady"

1505
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:36,216
Good afternoon, sir

1506
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:37,420
Hello, good to see you

1507
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:40,123
Sir, you are the policeman for
our village and you're farming now

1508
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:41,722
- How are you?
- I am fine, thank you

1509
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,457
You forgot all about us
once the alliance was finalized

1510
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,095
How can I forget you?

1511
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,627
In the village nearby
a scoundrel owes money

1512
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:49,624
So we came here
to collect it from him

1513
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:52,468
If you can fix the wedding date
I can pay a deposit for the hall

1514
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,602
Sure...sure

1515
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,040
Looks like my brother is
likely to get a Govt posting

1516
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:56,774
if you can manage 50-

1517
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,470
VVait...wait

1518
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,548
Get them some water to drink, dear

1519
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,039
Okay. Pa

1520
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:09,053
Tell me

1521
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,516
If you can give 50 sovereign
gold jewelry, we'll appreciate it

1522
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:13,519
Plus 500000 as part of the dowry

1523
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:16,158
Your daughter will be treated
with respect in the village

1524
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,054
I know you will do the needful

1525
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:21,526
You shouldn't think less of us
for not giving you our wish list

1526
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:25,167
We have spent around 2000000 on
my brother's education to make him a doctor

1527
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:28,269
Let us know your decision
We can fix the wedding date

1528
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:31,236
And...let my brother not know
we came hereto discuss terms

1529
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:32,237
He'll get mad at us

1530
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:34,103
Let's sort this out between us

1531
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:36,677
Tell us good news soon
We will take leave now

1532
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:38,582
See you

1533
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:42,143
What, mummy?

1534
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,480
I believe you're forever roaming
in and around the Koot road

1535
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:45,654
Who told you?

1536
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,420
He must have gone
to see one of his patients

1537
01:39:52,786 --> 01:39:55,096
Did you gift something to her?

1538
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:56,459
Should I buy?

1539
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:59,169
You are such a miser, I swear

1540
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:02,167
And I named you 'Dharma'!
I must have been off my mind

1541
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:04,704
If he doesn't buy
you call him a miser

1542
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,702
If he did, you will accuse him
of bequealhing his wealth to a girl

1543
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:10,409
You expect me to believe
you'll make such a will!

1544
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:14,848
This is a 'kumkum' box I got
at our temple when I was very young

1545
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:17,184
Tell her this is a gift from me

1546
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:18,456
This is for you

1547
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,525
She gives a mere brass box
and thinks it is the Kohinoor!

1548
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:25,353
- Mr Gopal
- Sorry, sir

1549
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:39,503
What's wrong ?

1550
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:47,110
We are conducting this wedding
selling my father's house and land

1551
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:52,214
My father and grandma have to move
into a rented house after I marry you

1552
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:58,289
How can we give all of a sudden
50 sovereign gold and 500000 cash?

1553
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:04,169
How can I come with you
by making my father a debtor?

1554
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:09,537
Your brothers have spent
on your education

1555
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:15,939
If you marry into an affluent family
they can pay you the dowry you want

1556
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:19,010
Did someone from my family
pester you with such demands?

1557
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:23,516
Not pester, but this is
the general norm, right?

1558
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:28,049
What worries me is they are saying
the wedding won't happen otherwise

1559
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:32,520
We have told all our friends and relatives

1560
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,495
I am scared

1561
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,267
Okay?

1562
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:53,041
My mother gave this kum-kum box
as her gift to her daughter-in-law

1563
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,399
How dare you humiliate me!

1564
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:15,469
What the hell?

1565
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:17,298
Why did you demand money
from Anbu's father?

1566
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:20,204
You've asked him to shell out
50 sovereign gold and cash

1567
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:22,476
We did it for your good

1568
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:23,440
What the hell?

1569
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:25,273
Even a farmer-groom gels
50 sovereign gold as dowry

1570
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:27,381
Because you liked her,
can we treat her like royalty?

1571
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:28,618
Planning to sell me, bloody mongrels

1572
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:30,452
People here pity you

1573
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:32,223
Did I ask you for money?

1574
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:33,423
How could you?

1575
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:34,385
What happened?

1576
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:36,786
He's hitting us because we went
and asked them for money

1577
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:38,695
How dare you ask for dowry!

1578
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:40,221
What's wrong with you?

1579
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:42,091
Dharma, calm down

1580
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:43,527
This is part of our custom

1581
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:45,132
In a wedding guests give gifts

1582
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:46,403
Does it mean we begged them to?

1583
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:47,433
Damn your custom

1584
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,798
What you asked is dowry!

1585
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:50,240
Gift is voluntarily given

1586
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:51,635
Not demanded, okay?

1587
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,236
We didn't force them to give

1588
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:54,512
You whacko!

1589
01:42:54,801 --> 01:42:56,246
Did we do something abnormal?

1590
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:59,245
You'll get a hospital if you marry
the bride of my choice

1591
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:02,419
Shouldn't the girl you choose
at least offer a clinic for you?

1592
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:04,279
Please don't interfere

1593
01:43:04,578 --> 01:43:05,818
I can handle it myself

1594
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:07,348
I'll butcher you

1595
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:09,787
There's a huge argument outside
Go and find out what's wrong

1596
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:11,228
First understand this

1597
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:13,225
I don't get involved
in these brawls with men

1598
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,297
Bad enough I am tense you made gravy
with okra instead of brinjal!

1599
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:19,264
Bloody glutton you are

1600
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,698
What is this fist fight for?

1601
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:22,674
They went and demanded dowry
behind my back, ma

1602
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:23,732
Shameless fellows!

1603
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:25,301
You are better off begging!

1604
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:30,275
They won't ask
I'll handle it

1605
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:31,549
You go inside

1606
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:32,578
Go...go

1607
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:33,783
He tore my shirt

1608
01:43:34,274 --> 01:43:35,810
It's okay, go in

1609
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,483
Go, Arjuna

1610
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:42,317
I thought they will be as united
as the Pandavas and named them so

1611
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:44,618
Someone has cast a spell on my boys

1612
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:47,697
Look what you did

1613
01:43:48,188 --> 01:43:50,225
We were compassionate and
you showed your true colors

1614
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:51,366
Go inside, dear

1615
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:54,298
Why couldn't you tell us
if you can't afford to pay up?

1616
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:56,165
Why cause a rift in our family?

1617
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:57,601
My brother has never
hit me till now

1618
01:43:58,098 --> 01:43:59,008
You goaded him
into hitting me

1619
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:01,006
How will your daughter
be happy in our house?

1620
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:02,473
She hasn't stepped
into our house as yet

1621
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,476
Are you trying to split
the 5 of us before that?

1622
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:06,114
Wonder what she will do then!

1623
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,579
We came down from our status
and you created a misunderstanding

1624
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:10,646
Is this your occupation
to split up a joint family?

1625
01:44:11,144 --> 01:44:13,283
Do you know how many girls
are waiting in a queue for my brother?

1626
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,753
He had to go and fall
for this guttersnipe!

1627
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,493
You came first to my house
proposing this match?

1628
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:23,063
I am not interested
in this proposal

1629
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:24,392
This wedding won't happen

1630
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:25,499
You can leave

1631
01:44:25,792 --> 01:44:27,169
Don't tell us

1632
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:30,499
You've made your daughter lure
my brother, tell him when he comes

1633
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:31,639
Let's go

1634
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:32,667
Disgusting!

1635
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:35,339
'If you don't have the money
go and beg or borrow'

1636
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:36,637
You thought we were losers, huh?

1637
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:38,480
Fat hopes he had

1638
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:45,417
My dear child!

1639
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,494
No need this match, dear

1640
01:44:52,252 --> 01:44:53,629
Not this family

1641
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,262
Tomorrow they may say
the gas stove exploded

1642
01:44:56,556 --> 01:44:58,035
Or she fell into the river

1643
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:00,635
They may do something
in their greed for money

1644
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:01,205
How can I lose you?

1645
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:03,174
How can I lose you?

1646
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:06,602
How will I live without you?

1647
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:10,373
Don't worry

1648
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:13,174
I'll get you married to a farmer

1649
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,612
He will take care of you happily

1650
01:45:16,276 --> 01:45:18,256
We don't want
an educated groom

1651
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:19,546
No need

1652
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,597
Mother...rna?

1653
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:37,000
Father doesn't want this alliance

1654
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:42,169
He is in my heart
as my husband, ma

1655
01:45:42,469 --> 01:45:44,506
God help me!

1656
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:58,418
Pa...?

1657
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:00,654
<i>“We”;?</i>

1658
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,792
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

1659
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,530
I didn't go for my duly tonight

1660
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,270
Why, pa?

1661
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:12,167
I don't mind going down
on my bended knees to the doctor

1662
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,239
My father need not fall
at anyone's feet and beg

1663
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:20,484
They came in 2 cars with
this proposal to our doorstep

1664
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:22,586
He will come for me

1665
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,446
I am positive

1666
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:27,225
Go with a relaxed mind

1667
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:28,356
Relax?!

1668
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,628
I'll rest in peace only when I die

1669
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:51,205
Have you sent
for the ambulance?

1670
01:46:51,505 --> 01:46:53,712
I want the postmortem report immediately

1671
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:14,369
Anbuselvi

1672
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:18,871
How could you leave us behind?

1673
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:42,161
I guarded the whole village and
I wasn't there for my daughter

1674
01:48:14,955 --> 01:48:17,458
You made an innocent girl
trust you and killed her

1675
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:19,395
We shouldn't have
let you into our village

1676
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:20,535
I won't spare your life

1677
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:21,567
Let go of him

1678
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:22,863
Trample him

1679
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:24,398
Don't spare him

1680
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:25,438
Move

1681
01:48:25,732 --> 01:48:27,234
He shouldn't enter our village

1682
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:28,410
I'll kill you

1683
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:30,371
Whatever it is
come to the station

1684
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:33,044
Constables, hurry up

1685
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,250
Move aside

1686
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:35,952
Kill him

1687
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:37,847
Don't let him in here

1688
01:48:54,494 --> 01:48:57,134
If you don't take proper action
we won't let it go, madam

1689
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:59,273
VVait...wait

1690
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:05,045
Call the doctor

1691
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:06,476
Okay, madam

1692
01:49:10,443 --> 01:49:12,389
Madam is calling you

1693
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:22,297
Greetings'

1694
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,933
'No one is responsible
for my death'

1695
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:31,107
'My suicide attempt and the proposal to marry
Dr Dharmadurai are not connected at all'

1696
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:35,471
'l have been suffering from stomach cramps
and migraine for many days'

1697
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:38,142
'l am not fit to get married'

1698
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:41,417
'That is why I decided to end my life'

1699
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:44,045
'No one is responsible for my death'

1700
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:46,153
'This letter clarifies my decision'

1701
01:49:46,446 --> 01:49:48,551
'P.Anbuselvi'

1702
01:49:50,483 --> 01:49:51,962
Look, doctor!

1703
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:56,530
If this girl had written this letter
only to me, I would have torn it

1704
01:49:57,023 --> 01:49:57,967
And locked you up

1705
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:05,301
But she sent this letter to me,
the headmaster, 'tahsildar' and librarian

1706
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:08,105
Sir

1707
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:09,469
SIR...?

1708
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,381
I am talking to you

1709
01:50:13,473 --> 01:50:15,248
Will you register a complaint?

1710
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:17,215
I'll take action against them

1711
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:21,253
Will you complain?
I'll lock him up for good

1712
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:26,622
Why are you hesitating, uncle?

1713
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,066
Register a complaint
We will see that he rots in jail

1714
01:50:29,356 --> 01:50:30,926
- Go ahead
- Why are you thinking?

1715
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,363
Register a complaint

1716
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:36,106
My daughter herself
didn't want to punish him

1717
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:38,603
What do I get by punishing him?

1718
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,302
I've lost my daughter
What is left for me?

1719
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:53,381
Your brother is coming back
from the police station

1720
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,318
Go in
We can talk later

1721
01:50:55,615 --> 01:50:56,616
Go inside the room

1722
01:50:57,117 --> 01:50:58,095
What happened, sister-in-law?

1723
01:50:58,385 --> 01:50:59,989
Be silent
You can talk later

1724
01:51:12,532 --> 01:51:13,408
What did I do?

1725
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,270
Don't throw it on me

1726
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:18,479
What could I do?

1727
01:51:56,142 --> 01:51:57,382
Dharma, listen to me

1728
01:51:57,677 --> 01:51:59,588
Come here

1729
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,123
Durai!

1730
01:52:01,147 --> 01:52:01,454
Durai!

1731
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:05,028
Be patient

1732
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:09,360
Come here

1733
01:52:09,656 --> 01:52:12,102
'Don't retaliate'

1734
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:14,403
Ma, come soon

1735
01:52:14,694 --> 01:52:16,105
Come here, son

1736
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:19,104
Maaa...!

1737
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:26,615
Gawd!

1738
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:52,636
Ma...?

1739
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:02,252
She pleaded with me

1740
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:11,159
I am a doctor and
they have killed her, ma

1741
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,158
They have killed her

1742
01:53:16,322 --> 01:53:20,600
Okay...calm down

1743
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:23,707
They killed her

1744
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:25,642
Tonsure my head

1745
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:27,008
Go away

1746
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,109
Listen to me...go

1747
01:53:29,402 --> 01:53:30,437
They killed my mother

1748
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:31,715
What are you saying?

1749
01:53:32,205 --> 01:53:33,707
He is pestering me
Take him away

1750
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:35,117
Take him with you

1751
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:36,182
Go, bro

1752
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:38,683
He isn't even agreeing
to tonsure my head, ma

1753
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:05,713
I won in the education race
and lost my life altogether, Subha

1754
01:55:00,026 --> 01:55:04,839
"Whichever side you may see
there is just 1 sky only"

1755
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:10,046
"Whichever path you may travel
many towns unravel"

1756
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:15,285
"Even when your love fails
a soft corner prevails“

1757
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:20,854
"A cockroach will still survive
even if its head you slice“

1758
01:55:21,147 --> 01:55:26,028
"if roses weep feeling sorry
tears will flow as honey“

1759
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,234
“lf you cry, my dear prince
enlightenment you'll experience“

1760
01:55:31,524 --> 01:55:36,530
“Hearing my order, dear
your cloud of sorrow will disappear“

1761
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:41,570
"Your cheek I will be
to bear your tears gladly“

1762
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:47,210
"Whichever side you may see
there is just 1 sky only"

1763
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:53,014
"Whichever path you may travel
many towns unravel"

1764
01:56:04,123 --> 01:56:09,038
"if happiness sought night and day
how will progress come into play?“

1765
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:14,301
"if noon is here to settle well
the heat will be unbearable as hell"

1766
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:19,310
"Only rivulets of tears
can wash way the mind's fears“

1767
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:24,520
“To wash your soul clean
flows another love-stream“

1768
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:30,051
"Change the lungs you breathe into
Fill to the brim with new love-02"

1769
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:35,493
"In another heart, another name
live to keep this love aflame“

1770
01:57:33,846 --> 01:57:34,722
I don't want any injection

1771
01:57:35,014 --> 01:57:36,015
I'll be fine with
these tablets

1772
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:37,051
Call yourself a doctor?

1773
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:38,226
How many patients
you would've injected?

1774
01:57:38,684 --> 01:57:39,685
Subha, no need, please

1775
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:48,237
Because you stopped drinking
You'll be fine

1776
01:57:48,528 --> 01:57:49,506
I know

1777
01:57:50,363 --> 01:57:54,334
Subha, you were in love
with me, in college, right?

1778
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:01,642
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

1779
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:03,552
You hid it from me

1780
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,698
Listen! They want you to settle
the money you took from them

1781
01:58:16,189 --> 01:58:19,363
Your house has no value at all

1782
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:21,730
But the land commands a good rate

1783
01:58:22,228 --> 01:58:27,337
Even if you will that property
you may have to pay about Rs 300000

1784
01:58:27,633 --> 01:58:31,080
They want the house
Are you prepared to part with it?

1785
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,680
Arjuna, Bhimarasu
What do you say?

1786
01:58:34,173 --> 01:58:35,208
Will you give the house?

1787
01:58:35,508 --> 01:58:38,250
Sir, it is ancestral property

1788
01:58:38,544 --> 01:58:40,251
We can't part with it

1789
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:44,255
Otherwise file a case
against Dr Dharmadurai

1790
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:47,429
Be precise about the section
We'll handle the case later

1791
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:49,723
Sir, you know my son, right?

1792
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:51,099
Don't you know him?

1793
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,300
I do, tell me

1794
01:58:52,592 --> 01:58:54,697
Weren't you classmates?

1795
01:58:55,194 --> 01:58:55,763
Ye s

1796
01:58:56,262 --> 01:58:57,832
You think my son is a thief?

1797
01:58:58,331 --> 01:58:59,309
Is he capable of stealing?

1798
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,339
Tell me

1799
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:01,042
How can you believe their stories?

1800
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:02,546
How can you believe their stories?

1801
01:59:03,236 --> 01:59:06,274
Listen to this truth from me

1802
01:59:06,572 --> 01:59:08,711
I haven't told this
to anyone till now

1803
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:11,188
I want to share this with you

1804
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:15,687
I am suspicious about
both my younger boys

1805
01:59:16,182 --> 01:59:18,423
If you enquire properly
they will cough up the truth

1806
01:59:18,718 --> 01:59:21,824
They stole the money
and chased my son away

1807
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:23,561
Good yarn!

1808
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:25,836
Ma, are you off your rockers?

1809
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:27,531
Why would we steal this money?

1810
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:29,397
If you have taken it
please return it

1811
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:30,799
Your mother herself is saying this

1812
01:59:31,297 --> 01:59:32,469
Thank god she didn't blame me

1813
01:59:32,765 --> 01:59:34,176
You were about to file something

1814
01:59:34,467 --> 01:59:35,309
First Information Report

1815
01:59:35,601 --> 01:59:36,409
Don't file it

1816
01:59:36,702 --> 01:59:37,510
You shouldn't

1817
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:40,613
Then they will publish his face
in all the newspapers

1818
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:42,784
Just a pittance after all

1819
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:47,190
If he treats a few patients
he can make up the missing cash

1820
01:59:48,714 --> 01:59:49,624
(overlap of voices)

1821
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:51,623
If you let them off
they'll go soot free

1822
01:59:51,918 --> 01:59:53,829
Why did you walk away in a huff?

1823
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,856
They keep talking
like a broken record

1824
01:59:56,355 --> 01:59:59,564
You aced it
with your law point

1825
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:05,673
My son went out of our village
and studied with great difficulty

1826
02:00:06,265 --> 02:00:09,109
They beat him up
in the middle of the road

1827
02:00:09,402 --> 02:00:10,779
Did he retaliate?

1828
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:12,140
Why didn't he?

1829
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:15,885
He paid heed to my words
and my dear son didn't hit back

1830
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:17,176
Don't get upset

1831
02:00:17,476 --> 02:00:19,888
For his good heartedness
he will be fine wherever he is

1832
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:22,352
Let us go in and sign

1833
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:24,327
Otherwise they may lock us up

1834
02:00:24,817 --> 02:00:27,798
If they do any such thing
I'll burn the station down

1835
02:00:28,087 --> 02:00:29,862
You seem very determined

1836
02:00:46,172 --> 02:00:47,515
- Morning, doctor
- Morning

1837
02:00:48,007 --> 02:00:50,180
- How are you doing?
- I am good, please sit down

1838
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:54,391
Doctor, Dr Dharmadurai is here

1839
02:01:06,325 --> 02:01:07,770
You bought this for me

1840
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:09,998
Of course it'll be nice

1841
02:01:10,296 --> 02:01:12,298
We picked it up
knowing you'll look good

1842
02:01:13,799 --> 02:01:15,540
- Let's go
- Where are we going?

1843
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:19,311
- Today is Independence day
- August 15th?

1844
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:21,310
Is today Independence day?

1845
02:01:21,807 --> 02:01:23,081
No, sir

1846
02:01:25,811 --> 02:01:28,519
- Independence day for me
- Taking off?

1847
02:01:29,015 --> 02:01:29,857
Come, da

1848
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:32,322
What about these patients?
Okay, Subha

1849
02:01:40,426 --> 02:01:42,565
Sir, your wife

1850
02:01:43,362 --> 02:01:44,466
Wait...I'll remove it

1851
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:47,302
Okay now?

1852
02:01:56,509 --> 02:01:59,183
I'm Dr Sivaraj
M.S, M.D from U.S

1853
02:02:01,447 --> 02:02:03,358
What's wrong with you?

1854
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:07,927
Your divorce came through
without any hassles

1855
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:09,358
You will soon get
the judgment copy

1856
02:02:09,655 --> 02:02:11,362
Please sign here

1857
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:15,897
- Need anything else?
- That's all

1858
02:02:17,463 --> 02:02:18,441
Let's go

1859
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:21,443
'What, Subhashini?'

1860
02:02:21,934 --> 02:02:23,413
'No goodbye, huh?'

1861
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:25,343
Think this is your victory?

1862
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:27,208
If I had lived with you...

1863
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:29,076
...I would have lost!

1864
02:02:31,110 --> 02:02:33,181
There are many poor people
living in the US too

1865
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:35,015
America will take care of that

1866
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:37,225
How silly of you, sir?
Shall we leave?

1867
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:40,030
He was so bugged when I said
we are living together

1868
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:42,265
I was shocked myself
Then why won't he be?

1869
02:02:42,555 --> 02:02:43,590
Forget it

1870
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:45,662
By the way, Subha...

1871
02:02:46,559 --> 02:02:48,197
...what is the problem?

1872
02:02:51,731 --> 02:02:53,039
He's a murderer!

1873
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:54,367
Murderer...?

1874
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:59,081
He looks like he has
no bad habits at all?

1875
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:01,383
He's a disciplined bad guy!

1876
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:04,721
I am pregnant

1877
02:03:05,277 --> 02:03:07,188
What's the urgency
to have a baby now?

1878
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,460
'Told him I was pregnant'

1879
02:03:09,749 --> 02:03:11,695
'But he asked me to
abort the baby'

1880
02:03:12,184 --> 02:03:14,664
'Tag along with him
and settle abroad'

1881
02:03:15,154 --> 02:03:17,498
I will start my practice here

1882
02:03:18,157 --> 02:03:19,295
Along with my classmates

1883
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:21,538
I promised my professor
I'll serve my people

1884
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:26,409
Okay?

1885
02:03:29,335 --> 02:03:30,643
'Without my knowledge...'

1886
02:03:31,137 --> 02:03:34,118
'...he had mixed abortion
tablets in the milk'

1887
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:35,477
'My baby...'

1888
02:03:35,775 --> 02:03:37,482
'...was gone!'

1889
02:03:45,451 --> 02:03:47,397
Why did you let him go soot free?

1890
02:03:49,155 --> 02:03:50,634
What could I do?

1891
02:03:56,462 --> 02:03:57,566
- Hey Dharma
- Just a minute

1892
02:03:58,063 --> 02:03:59,269
Let me have a word
with him, dear

1893
02:03:59,565 --> 02:04:00,566
Wail

1894
02:04:04,403 --> 02:04:05,575
She's someone...

1895
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:08,449
...who has donated her organs
while she was still a student

1896
02:04:09,608 --> 02:04:11,645
You can't even be compared
to the dust on her feet

1897
02:04:12,144 --> 02:04:13,589
- Hello
- Call yourself a doctor?

1898
02:04:14,613 --> 02:04:16,456
Wail, I'm talking, right?

1899
02:04:17,416 --> 02:04:20,397
It's wrong to check
the gender of the fetus

1900
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,491
You've killed her baby
without her permission

1901
02:04:34,233 --> 02:04:35,712
It's getting late, let's go

1902
02:04:50,716 --> 02:04:52,423
Not going to the hospital?

1903
02:04:53,686 --> 02:04:55,222
No, not today

1904
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:59,167
Everyone is inquiring as if
there was a funeral at home

1905
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:05,537
I should have forgotten
our Kamaraj sir's advice

1906
02:05:06,131 --> 02:05:08,202
Compromised with my husband

1907
02:05:08,501 --> 02:05:10,742
I should have aborted
my baby like he told me to

1908
02:05:11,237 --> 02:05:13,581
And I could have happily
settled in America, right?

1909
02:05:15,674 --> 02:05:17,312
I don't know how to enjoy life

1910
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:19,521
Isn't that what you're thinking?

1911
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:21,587
You're bound to think so

1912
02:05:24,717 --> 02:05:27,630
You think I'm a lunatic, right?

1913
02:05:33,759 --> 02:05:35,534
I think you look
like my Anbuselvi

1914
02:06:19,505 --> 02:06:21,075
Subha

1915
02:06:21,473 --> 02:06:23,350
I shared what I felt in my heart

1916
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,253
Sorry if I had hurl you

1917
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:29,222
Shall I stay elsewhere?

1918
02:07:27,373 --> 02:07:28,408
Tell me

1919
02:07:32,945 --> 02:07:35,357
I'm feeling very secure today

1920
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:47,003
“lf circumstances cause harm
won't happiness be lukewarm?“

1921
02:07:47,292 --> 02:07:52,435
“To quench thirst however
can a sieve hold the water?“

1922
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:57,471
“Like mother's milk as rainfall
you quenched my thirst, my girl"

1923
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:02,919
"We have no name for this bond we share
You gifted me your tender loving care“

1924
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:07,122
“The top of your head to caress
do I have the right, my princess?“

1925
02:08:07,413 --> 02:08:09,450
No water in the shower, Dharma

1926
02:08:14,153 --> 02:08:15,029
I'm coming

1927
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:16,424
My eyes are burning

1928
02:08:16,922 --> 02:08:18,492
Coming...coming

1929
02:08:19,324 --> 02:08:21,770
This is called water can consecration

1930
02:08:38,844 --> 02:08:40,915
'Anbuselvi Clinic
Dr S.Dharmadurai M.B.B.S'

1931
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:51,096
What is the matter?

1932
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,996
My sight is failing, I'm not
able to watch TV programs

1933
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:55,363
Look here

1934
02:09:11,276 --> 02:09:12,949
Watchwoman, what happened to your job?

1935
02:09:13,245 --> 02:09:15,156
Who will respect us enough
to offer us a job?

1936
02:09:15,447 --> 02:09:17,324
- Shall I take leave?
- Sure, bro

1937
02:09:18,317 --> 02:09:22,993
"Whichever side I may see
there is just 1 sky only“

1938
02:09:23,288 --> 02:09:24,198
My arms and legs pain a lot

1939
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:25,594
- What do you do?
- I'm jobless, sitting at home

1940
02:09:26,125 --> 02:09:27,331
Sometimes when you do nothing,
your body will ache

1941
02:09:27,626 --> 02:09:29,264
- Will you do me a favor?
- Tell me, doctor

1942
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:31,404
Walk for half an hour daily
Morning and evening

1943
02:09:31,897 --> 02:09:33,604
I'll prescribe a tablet
for your body ache

1944
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:39,105
"When you rest your head on my chest
there is an honesty, dearest"

1945
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:41,077
Shouldn't ride a bike
for too long a period

1946
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:42,613
Okay, Subha
We will buy a car soon

1947
02:09:43,142 --> 02:09:44,348
I shouldn't stamp you like this

1948
02:09:44,643 --> 02:09:46,919
- Little bit to the right
- Is it hurting here?

1949
02:09:47,212 --> 02:09:49,158
- Little behind
- Here...?

1950
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:54,625
“Hearing my order, dear
your cloud of sorrow will disappear“

1951
02:09:55,154 --> 02:09:59,296
"Your cheek I will be
to bear your tears gladly“

1952
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:20,948
- Good morning
- Good morning, bro

1953
02:10:21,246 --> 02:10:23,385
- How is work?
- Going very well

1954
02:10:23,882 --> 02:10:26,226
- What's this?
- This month's salary

1955
02:10:30,522 --> 02:10:31,523
Bless you

1956
02:10:32,024 --> 02:10:33,094
Thanks, bro

1957
02:10:33,392 --> 02:10:35,065
Ask the patient to come

1958
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:44,310
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning, please sit

1959
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:46,549
- What's the matter?
- Not able to crap

1960
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:48,074
Not passing motion?

1961
02:10:48,373 --> 02:10:49,249
What did you have last night?

1962
02:10:49,541 --> 02:10:51,248
- Ate 'parotta'
- 'Parotta'?

1963
02:10:51,543 --> 02:10:53,022
<i>How can you eat 'partake?</i>

1964
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,916
They've banned it in Kerala!

1965
02:10:55,214 --> 02:10:56,557
That flour is used
as glue to stick posters

1966
02:10:57,049 --> 02:10:58,551
If you eat that
you will be constipated

1967
02:10:59,051 --> 02:11:01,122
Eat a banana, drink plenty
of water, you'll be fine

1968
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:03,400
- What does your father do?
- My father is no more, sir

1969
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:05,391
Your father has passed away?

1970
02:11:06,124 --> 02:11:08,468
Here, eat the Blue java variety

1971
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:13,103
Don't eat 'parotta', sir

1972
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,651
Please come
What's your problem?

1973
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:25,121
I want to meet your doctor
regarding a personal issue

1974
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:26,980
Oh! I see
And you are...?

1975
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:28,383
My name is Kamaraj

1976
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:30,159
Tell him I'm a retired professor

1977
02:11:30,449 --> 02:11:32,554
Okay, sir, please sit
I'll inform him

1978
02:11:33,585 --> 02:11:35,121
Injection not needed

1979
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:36,922
Give only this medicine
thrice a day

1980
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:38,030
Okay...?

1981
02:11:38,323 --> 02:11:40,633
Go easy on ice cream, okay?

1982
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:44,304
Bro, retired professor Kamaraj
has come to see you

1983
02:11:44,596 --> 02:11:46,303
Shall I ask him to come in?

1984
02:11:55,974 --> 02:11:58,113
Sir, doctor has come

1985
02:12:00,379 --> 02:12:01,357
Hello, doctor

1986
02:12:01,847 --> 02:12:03,349
My name is Kamaraj

1987
02:12:03,849 --> 02:12:06,090
I was a professor in
Madurai Medical College

1988
02:12:06,385 --> 02:12:09,491
I heard a doctor is
practicing here

1989
02:12:10,022 --> 02:12:13,094
I taught a student with your name

1990
02:12:13,392 --> 02:12:17,238
I had a gut feeling
maybe you are that student

1991
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:20,032
That's why I came to see you

1992
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:22,504
Which college, doctor?

1993
02:12:27,306 --> 02:12:28,512
Dharmaduraim!

1994
02:12:32,544 --> 02:12:35,388
It's so unfortunate
I can't see your face now

1995
02:12:35,881 --> 02:12:36,621
Please come

1996
02:12:37,115 --> 02:12:38,059
Please come in, sir

1997
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:39,328
<i>Come</i>

1998
02:12:46,425 --> 02:12:50,066
This society always watches what we do

1999
02:12:50,362 --> 02:12:53,138
Whether you are together
or separated, it must be legal

2000
02:12:53,432 --> 02:12:55,412
That augurs well
for a man and a woman

2001
02:12:55,901 --> 02:12:57,608
In fact for the family too

2002
02:12:58,103 --> 02:12:59,980
You both get married soon

2003
02:13:00,272 --> 02:13:01,182
Before that...

2004
02:13:01,473 --> 02:13:04,283
...to think you can live together

2005
02:13:04,576 --> 02:13:06,613
...will not work in our village

2006
02:13:07,112 --> 02:13:09,956
Sir, we tried to
register our marriage

2007
02:13:10,248 --> 02:13:13,058
But getting address proof and
I.D proof is an uphill task

2008
02:13:13,352 --> 02:13:15,423
To prove our identity is so tough

2009
02:13:16,588 --> 02:13:18,431
You've already proved it, son

2010
02:13:18,924 --> 02:13:22,303
The way your patients shower
love on you is proof enough!

2011
02:13:22,594 --> 02:13:24,073
Thank you, sir

2012
02:13:25,564 --> 02:13:26,565
Hey!

2013
02:13:27,132 --> 02:13:29,237
Chase that cow away

2014
02:13:30,969 --> 02:13:33,074
Shooo!

2015
02:13:33,372 --> 02:13:34,146
Bhimarasu...?

2016
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:36,180
Why chase the cow
that belongs to the temple?

2017
02:13:36,475 --> 02:13:37,476
Are you brainless or what?

2018
02:13:37,976 --> 02:13:39,421
Does this land belong to us?

2019
02:13:39,945 --> 02:13:41,322
We are being paid
daily wages, get lost!

2020
02:13:41,613 --> 02:13:43,593
When have you listened
to good advice?

2021
02:13:46,318 --> 02:13:48,195
Go...get lost

2022
02:13:48,487 --> 02:13:50,057
Oh! God!

2023
02:13:51,123 --> 02:13:54,696
I don't know where my son is?
If he is struggling?

2024
02:13:57,496 --> 02:13:59,134
Karuppiah...!

2025
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:05,477
Won't you show my son to me?

2026
02:14:16,448 --> 02:14:18,450
- I'm Kesavan here
- Which Kesavan?

2027
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:20,054
Forgotten me, huh?

2028
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:21,194
Madurai Medical College

2029
02:14:21,486 --> 02:14:23,056
Hey! Kesavam!

2030
02:14:23,355 --> 02:14:24,197
How are you?

2031
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:26,628
- I'm fine, how about you?
- Top of the world!

2032
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:28,695
Kamaraj sir gave me your number

2033
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:30,264
Heard the good news

2034
02:14:32,464 --> 02:14:33,670
I'm very happy for you

2035
02:14:35,734 --> 02:14:38,977
Dharman's brothers came to see me

2036
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:42,013
They told me he ran away from home
with a huge amount of money

2037
02:14:42,307 --> 02:14:44,116
I can't ask him about this

2038
02:14:44,409 --> 02:14:46,616
- Ask him and clear it up
- I'll take care

2039
02:14:47,112 --> 02:14:49,149
After you fix
the marriage date...

2040
02:14:49,448 --> 02:14:50,426
...keep me posted for sure

2041
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:52,490
I'll bring all our friends and come

2042
02:15:04,429 --> 02:15:05,237
Where are you?

2043
02:15:05,530 --> 02:15:06,565
Subham?

2044
02:15:09,534 --> 02:15:11,343
Subha, what are you doing-

2045
02:15:13,371 --> 02:15:14,509
'30 rupees doctor?'

2046
02:15:15,006 --> 02:15:16,178
Yes, tell me

2047
02:15:16,475 --> 02:15:19,115
'My son is suffering from flu
and extensive shivering'

2048
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:20,981
Please prescribe a medicine

2049
02:15:21,346 --> 02:15:22,654
Go to a pharmacy near by

2050
02:15:23,148 --> 02:15:25,094
Boil 'nilavembu' brew and
give it to him, he'll be fine

2051
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:26,225
'Sure, doctor'

2052
02:15:26,518 --> 02:15:28,054
- Okay...?
- Thanks a lot, doctor

2053
02:15:28,353 --> 02:15:29,331
No problem

2054
02:15:30,555 --> 02:15:31,727
Subha, what happened?

2055
02:15:32,224 --> 02:15:33,567
Why are you out of sorts?

2056
02:15:34,359 --> 02:15:35,565
Running a temperature?

2057
02:15:39,164 --> 02:15:41,542
Hey! Where did you get
all these wads of cash?

2058
02:15:42,267 --> 02:15:44,110
Don't keep it at home
Not safe, deposit in the bank

2059
02:15:44,402 --> 02:15:45,574
Shall I get something
to eat for you?

2060
02:15:46,071 --> 02:15:48,278
Our friend Kesavan called

2061
02:15:48,573 --> 02:15:50,780
I believe you stole cash
from your house?

2062
02:15:51,443 --> 02:15:53,548
Your family complained
to him it seems

2063
02:15:54,045 --> 02:15:56,184
This is the bag
you brought here

2064
02:15:56,481 --> 02:15:58,051
I found all this in it

2065
02:16:00,051 --> 02:16:01,428
In the bag I brought-

2066
02:16:04,389 --> 02:16:06,198
I packed only my medical books

2067
02:16:09,594 --> 02:16:10,800
It was dark

2068
02:16:12,063 --> 02:16:13,235
I couldn't see

2069
02:16:14,799 --> 02:16:16,676
- It's okay
- What else did he say?

2070
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:19,582
He asked me to
solve this problem

2071
02:16:21,406 --> 02:16:23,079
Is this the reason
for your long face?

2072
02:16:23,375 --> 02:16:25,321
It isn't a problem at all
We can send it through someone

2073
02:16:25,610 --> 02:16:27,521
Get ready, let's go out somewhere

2074
02:16:29,214 --> 02:16:31,490
You have to return it
in person, dear

2075
02:16:32,617 --> 02:16:34,597
They should also know
you are doing well for yourself

2076
02:16:35,086 --> 02:16:36,724
That's the right thing to do

2077
02:16:37,222 --> 02:16:38,326
They won't reform

2078
02:16:38,623 --> 02:16:41,194
They would have branded me
a robber by now!

2079
02:16:41,626 --> 02:16:43,299
I don't want to see them

2080
02:16:43,595 --> 02:16:44,505
Why do we need their money?

2081
02:16:44,796 --> 02:16:46,605
We can send it through someone

2082
02:16:49,701 --> 02:16:51,612
Return this money

2083
02:16:53,505 --> 02:16:55,416
Bring your mother here

2084
02:16:57,842 --> 02:16:59,219
Because...

2085
02:17:03,782 --> 02:17:06,763
...I want her to hold
our baby in her arms

2086
02:17:10,655 --> 02:17:12,532
When did this get confirmed?

2087
02:17:13,425 --> 02:17:14,597
This morning

2088
02:17:29,274 --> 02:17:31,720
For this jobless officer
a junior officer, doctor?

2089
02:17:35,413 --> 02:17:37,757
Is this the job of
a jobless officer, doctor?

2090
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:07,255
Bro...?

2091
02:18:07,545 --> 02:18:08,683
Wine shop waiter!

2092
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:12,684
Can't even recognize you, wearing shades,
looking great like actor MGR

2093
02:18:13,184 --> 02:18:14,219
How are you doing?

2094
02:18:14,519 --> 02:18:16,362
I'm fine, not seen you
at my shop for a long time

2095
02:18:16,655 --> 02:18:17,725
I don't go there

2096
02:18:18,223 --> 02:18:19,463
Why is my house locked?
Isn't anyone here?

2097
02:18:19,758 --> 02:18:21,032
They faced too many problems

2098
02:18:21,326 --> 02:18:23,306
Key to your house is
with the police officer

2099
02:18:24,429 --> 02:18:26,466
- What about my family members?
- They are outside the village

2100
02:18:26,765 --> 02:18:28,301
Near the grove

2101
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:29,578
Okay

2102
02:18:39,644 --> 02:18:40,384
Hey!

2103
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:41,555
Brother...?

2104
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:43,185
'Akka'?

2105
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:46,428
'Anna', how are you?

2106
02:18:48,486 --> 02:18:49,590
Forgive me

2107
02:18:50,388 --> 02:18:51,765
I didn't do it intentionally

2108
02:18:52,557 --> 02:18:54,366
I swear I didn't know

2109
02:18:55,226 --> 02:18:56,637
I just came to know

2110
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:59,172
I'm not the Dharman you knew

2111
02:19:00,165 --> 02:19:01,405
I've stopped drinking

2112
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:03,270
I've started my own clinic

2113
02:19:03,568 --> 02:19:06,174
I'm getting married
to my college classmate

2114
02:19:06,604 --> 02:19:08,379
Life has changed

2115
02:19:08,807 --> 02:19:10,377
'Anna', sorry

2116
02:19:10,675 --> 02:19:11,551
Please forgive me

2117
02:19:12,043 --> 02:19:13,317
That money-

2118
02:19:30,462 --> 02:19:32,305
'Hey! What is his story?'

2119
02:19:32,597 --> 02:19:33,575
What did Durai say?

2120
02:19:34,065 --> 02:19:35,601
You're treating him
like the prodigal brother!

2121
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:37,239
You should be amputating his limbs

2122
02:19:37,535 --> 02:19:39,776
He humiliated us and
brought us to the streets

2123
02:19:40,271 --> 02:19:41,443
What further damage
did he intend doing?

2124
02:19:41,740 --> 02:19:42,548
Bloody thief!

2125
02:19:42,841 --> 02:19:44,752
Walking in with coolers
and showing off

2126
02:19:45,243 --> 02:19:47,314
'Left us without even
a change of clothes!'

2127
02:19:47,612 --> 02:19:49,785
My Dharma...my Dharmaduraim!

2128
02:19:51,449 --> 02:19:53,258
He looks like a prince

2129
02:19:53,551 --> 02:19:55,087
Why did you hit him?

2130
02:19:55,387 --> 02:19:57,333
Duraim?

2131
02:19:57,622 --> 02:20:01,126

2142
02:20:53,978 --> 02:20:55,013
What happened?

2143
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:57,390
My son fell down from
the stairs to the attic

2144
