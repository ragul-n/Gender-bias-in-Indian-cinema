1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,836
Until 1971,

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,758
Bangladesh was the Eastern wing

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,030
of the Islamic State of Pakistan.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,559
This story takes place

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,954
against the backdrop

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,639
of the democratic movement

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,910
against military rule in Pakistan

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,348
during the late 1960's,

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,152
which led to general elections.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,839
The military government

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,837
cancelled the election results,

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,758
and the subsequent Army crackdown

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,154
culminated in civil war

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,793
and independence of Bangladesh.

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,390
No.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,435
Not like that.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,669
From now on, you should use this.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,510
Take it.

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,395
Do it. Let me watch.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,996
No. Like this.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,830
<i>Allah is great.</i>

22
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,551
Ma, when's Anu coming home?

23
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,670
I don't know.

24
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,995
Is he learning a lot in there?

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,357
Yes.
He's going to be like your father.

26
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,676
Anu's mother!

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,750
Can I have some tea?

28
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,597
I've put the water on.

29
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,358
I keep asking you
about the medicine.

30
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,758
Asma's got fever again.
Please give her something.

31
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,793
I told you not to let
her wander outside,

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,752
she'll catch fever.

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,032
What else can she do?
She's got no one to play with

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,719
since you sent her brother
to madrasa.

35
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,078
Okay,

36
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,872
sit up straight.

37
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,629
Oh Allah!
You have such long hair.

38
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,315
You know who keeps their hair long?

39
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,390
Women and Hindu sadhus.

40
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,392
Following them,
muslim mystics also grow their hair.

41
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,352
Are you trying to adopt
their impious ways?

42
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,996
Only for the new students,

43
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,873
I cut their hair the first time.

44
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,436
From now on,

45
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,632
you'll have to do it on your own.

46
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,798
This is called a "crew cut".

47
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,558
Have you finished?

48
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,395
Are you the new boy?

49
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,189
- Your name?
- My name's Anu.

50
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,358
That's not an Islamic name.

51
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,673
Your proper name is Anwar.

52
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,869
Right?

53
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,755
- What's your father's name?
- Kazi Mazharul Islam.

54
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,799
From now on, your name here is

55
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,788
Kazi Muhammad Anwarul Islam.
OK?

56
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,918
Anwar come quick,
you'll miss lunch!

57
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,190
At first you'll feel bad here
but you'll get use to it.

58
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,192
Do you like fish?

59
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,872
I hate it.

60
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,117
Really? Why?

61
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,114
I don't know.
Even the sight of it makes me sick.

62
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,835
What's your name?

63
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,392
Rokon.
Muhammad Rokonuddin Khan.

64
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,630
Anwar the animal!

65
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,593
Why stand there like a tree?
Play, or go away.

66
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,199
What kind of game is this?

67
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,279
This new kid's a dunce.
Doesn't know shit.

68
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,032
See, there's your friend,

69
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,799
playing by himself. Weirdo!

70
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,595
Gojoin him.

71
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,029
What are you doing?

72
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,872
It's just another game,

73
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,232
much better than their games.

74
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,237
No ball, no boundary...

75
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,273
nothing's allowed here.

76
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,593
Let's play! Here's my ball!

77
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,313
- Where?
- Here!

78
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,480
Here, catch!
Now throw it back.

79
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,830
Nothing like playing with a ball!

80
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,198
Let's see who can catch it!

81
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
Are you from a town or a village?

82
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,509
A town. And you?

83
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,629
Village.

84
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,435
Why did you let him go with Milon?
You know I don't like it.

85
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,235
Don't put it on me.
Can't you convince your own brother?

86
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,118
My son shouldn't see
all that Hindu rubbish!

87
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,550
You two are ruining my boy.

88
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,115
It's your brother
who takes him everywhere.

89
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,390
Easy to blame me.

90
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,556
I told you not to go out.
Your father is very angry.

91
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,875
Anu!

92
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,475
You forgot the sweets!

93
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,515
What's this?

94
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,833
Let me see!

95
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,396
Get this heathen trash out of here!

96
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,359
I've had enough.

97
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,070
I'll send him off to madrasa.

98
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,829
Go to bed! Sleep!

99
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,034
Be quiet!

100
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,039
Sleep!

101
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,229
Rokon...

102
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,398
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

103
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,430
I can't sleep either.

104
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,479
I don't get it.
Why are they so mean to you?

105
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,118
You want something to eat?

106
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,117
What have you got?

107
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,158
Where did you get these?
Who gave them to you?

108
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,357
- My friend.
- Who's your friend?

109
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,313
I have a special friend.

110
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,519
A special friend?

111
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,390
Some day I'll tell you about him.

112
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,512
You all know about
the holy night of Meraj.

113
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,192
On this night, the Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him,

114
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,949
rode a winged horse
to have an audience with Allah.

115
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,513
On his way back from heaven,

116
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,110
he met Prophet Moses,
peace be upon him.

117
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,474
Prophet Moses
asked Prophet Muhammad:

118
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,993
"How many prayers did you get
assigned for your followers?"

119
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,558
Muhammad said:
"Fifty per day."

120
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,232
Moses cried out: "That's too much!
Go back and ask him to reduce it."

121
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,238
So, Muhammad went back to Allah.

122
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,479
On his return he told Moses
he got it reduced to five prayers.

123
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,990
Moses said: "That's still too much,
go back to him."

124
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,718
But Prophet Muhammad didn't want
to bother Allah any further.

125
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,558
...as I was saying,

126
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,435
you must do your ablutions
before each prayer.

127
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,437
There are 7 ways they get spoiled.

128
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,078
Down with Military Dictatorship!

129
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,158
Free Political Prisoners!

130
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,593
We want Autonomy!

131
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,112
<i>The ocean swells are rising</i>

132
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,478
<i>How can we sail through?</i>

133
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,919
Allah forgive us!

134
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,353
I'm leaving this evening
for pilgrimage.

135
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,518
I will return on Saturday,
Allah willing.

136
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,110
Papa!
When will you be back?

137
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,469
Saturday, Allah willing!

138
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,591
Please bring me some red shoes.

139
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,392
Your father won't have the time.

140
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,276
- Where's Milon?
- I'm here.

141
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,919
Don't waste all your time in town.

142
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,429
- Keep an eye on the house.
- Okay.

143
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,629
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

144
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,033
Ma, I'm full.

145
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,198
You're hardly eating these days.

146
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,959
Did you bring the mustard sauce?

147
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,116
Sorry Madam,
I'll bring it tomorrow.

148
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
There's a concert tonight
in the village.

149
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,792
A very good one. Come!

150
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,231
Oh Ma! Let's go!

151
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,793
You always bring trouble.
How can I go?

152
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,914
Kazi's gone for pilgrimage.

153
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,475
The concert's nearby. Let's go!

154
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,120
If Kazi finds out, he'll be angry.

155

Uttam, Shaheen, sit down.

171
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,154
What's new?

172
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,352

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,157
- Better he keeps his word.
- We'll see.

181
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,553
Wake up!

182
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,754
Prayer is better than sleep.

183
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,679
Wake up!

184
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,510
Get ready!

185
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,109
Silence!

186
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,149
Quiet!

187
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,992
What Arabic lesson were we on?

188
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,072
Oh yes, I remember.

189
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,193
Conjugate the verb "to do"
in the present tense. Anwar?

190
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,154
<i>He does, two boys do,</i>
<i>three or more do, she does....</i>

191
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,514
<i>two girls do, three or more</i> do...

192
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,030
Who can give me a sentence

193
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,188
with subject, object, verb
and preposition?

194
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,680
<i>Zaid beats Omar with the stick.</i>

195
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,677
You boy.

196
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,677
Explain the different noun forms
in this sentence.

197
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,356
Zaid is active, ends with "oon"
Omar, the subject, ends with "aan",

198
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,718
and the stick is...

199
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,590
"Stick" is an exception to the rule.

200
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,591
It should end with "ee"
but in this case,

201
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,951
stick ends with "aa".

202
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,515
Got it?

203
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,111
- Where are you from?
- Near Kumarganj.

204
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,316
My uncle lives there.

205
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,875
- What's the name of your village?
- Fulpur.

206
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,433
Fulpur. Pretty name!

207
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,828
Rokon!

208
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,032
Here is my robe. Wash it well.

209
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,918
Is your home far away?

210
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,198
Yes, very far.

211
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,356
Sir, what's your village like?

212
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,510
My daughter is very restless.

213
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,876
She's a bit older than you.

214
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,469
She likes to play by the pond.

215
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,675
There is a big tree there.

216
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,319
When its flowers fall on the water

217
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,397
it looks like a red carpet.

218
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,117
She always bathes there,
dunking her head below the water.

219
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,276
She disappears for a while,

220
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,191
but then, she comes up again
her hair draped in red flowers.

221
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,597
Will you go home for Eid?

222
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,629
No, it's too far
for the few vacation days I get.

223
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,308
But you should both go back home.

224
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,473
I won't go.

225
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,749
I'll go.

226
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,909
You've always used allopathy.

227
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,754
Try homeopathy for a month and see.

228
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Allah willing, his tonsillitis
will never return.

229
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,352
Please come have a seat,
Khan Bahadur.

230
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,277
Are you feeling better?

231
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,716
By the grace of Allah
and the means of your medicine,

232
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,119
- I'm much better.
- It's all Allah's will.

233
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,594
In fact,
allopathy treats only the illness

234
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,760
while homeopathy treats the patient.

235
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,076
You're right about that.

236
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,797
For example, fever.

237
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,235
We think it's an illness
but it isn't.

238
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,917
It's just a symptom.

239
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,355
What's needed is to treat
the root of all disease.

240
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,955
You see,

241
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,153
how anarchy
was threatening our country.

242
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,356
A little tear gas and gunfire
at demonstrations couldn't stop it.

243
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,633
We needed real medicine:

244
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,989
Martial law!

245
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,795
Now see, the troublemakers
have been cut down to size.

246
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,873
Don't you agree?

247
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,715
Ma, Anu's come!

248
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,354
Isn't it pretty?

249
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,677
- It's for you.
- Where did you get it?

250
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,759
At a village fair. Don't let father
see it. He'd get mad.

251
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,718
I'll hide it somewhere
even you won't find it.

252
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,079
Anu, have some milk.

253
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,595
What do they teach you?
The call to prayer?

254
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,951
<i>Allah is great.</i>

255
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,956
Silly girl!

256
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,234
- So, how are your studies going?
- Well.

257
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,956
Is your toupee cap
only for madrasa?

258
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,197
- Do they feed you well?
- Yes.

259
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,676
- You've made new friends?
- Yes.

260
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,630
Rokon.

261
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,438
The other kids tease him
'cause he's different.

262
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,076
But you know, he's really nice.

263
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,188
And your teachers?

264
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,517
I really like lbrahim sir.
He tells lots of stories.

265
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,798
You know what we call Halim sir?

266
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,228
Catfish!

267
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,915
But the Head Sir, he's scary.

268
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,468
It's getting late. Let's go.

269
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,071
What about this tomato?

270
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,271
Keep it for Asma.

271
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,756
<i>One night Abraham had a dream:</i>

272
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,112
<i>Allah asked him</i>
<i>to sacrifice his dearest one</i>

273
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,552
<i>Abraham pondered</i>
<i>who was dearest to his heart</i>

274
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:32,118
<i>Then he realized it was his son</i>

275
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,673
<i>He told his wife:</i>
<i>"Dress our son for a journey"</i>

276
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:49,834
<i>As they departed,</i>
<i>the mother looked on with foreboding</i>

277
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:57,833
<i>She wondered whether</i>
<i>her son would ever return</i>

278
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,669
<i>Arriving at Mina Mount</i>

279
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,839
<i>Abraham told his son</i>
<i>the will of Allah</i>

280
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:15,312
<i>His son said:</i>
<i>"We cannot defy His will"</i>

281
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,715
<i>Helplessly he allowed Abraham</i>
<i>to lay him down</i>

282
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,829
<i>But the moment Abraham</i>
<i>pressed the knife</i>

283
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,439
<i>on his son's throat,</i>

284
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,677
<i>at home, the mother's heart</i>
<i>began to cry out</i>

285
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,112
<i>Hearing her cries</i>

286
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,553
<i>the sky, the trees,</i>

287
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,357
<i>and the birds,</i>

288
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,678
<i>all began to weep</i>

289
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,314
Grab it! Hold it tight!

290
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,349
Bring the knife.

291
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,470
What are they doing to our cow?

292
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,717
They're not doing anything.
No need to watch.

293
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,914
Come put your Eid clothes on.

294
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,911
You look pretty.

295
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,913
Hey Milon, just pudding for us?

296
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,997
There's no main course?

297
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,034
Don't worry!
We have chicken for you.

298
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,913
Just eating beef once
won't make you a Muslim.

299
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,549
Uncle Milon,

300
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,194
look what Anu's done!

301
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,955
You've ruined your new clothes!

302
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,712
Look at that! Go and change.

303
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,154
Is Kazi back from Eid prayer?

304
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,075
- He's preparing the meat.
- We should go.

305
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,429
Come visit us later.

306
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,838
- Please wait a bit.
- We won't eat now.

307
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,511
You've spoiled your clothes!

308
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,876
Can I wear the shirt Milon gave me?

309
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,753
You needed an excuse
to wear Milon's shirt.

310
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,359
Don't you think I know?

311
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,551
Go ahead.

312
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,394
Uncle, Eid is a festive day.

313
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,034
Why do we wear white
like we're in mourning?

314
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,389
Good question.

315
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,990
Look at the pretty flowers!

316
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,395
Uncle will you bring me one?

317
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,513
Of course.

318
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,752
That white one!

319
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,473
Okay.

320
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,549
Abdur Rahim?

321
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,349
You're good in Islamic History,
Urdu and Farsi

322
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,038
but so bad at Arabic writing.

323
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,153
He's left handed,
but he's told to use his right hand.

324
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,916
If he could use his left hand...

325
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,588
The Arabic alphabet is sacred!

326
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,597
You can't use your left hand.

327
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,115
Who's next?

328
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,392
Muhammad Rokonuddin Khan?

329
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,518
You have no concentration.

330
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,076
You are particularly bad in Urdu.

331
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,758
You use Bengali words
in your Urdu writing.

332
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,278
But you're very good in Arabic!

333
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,199
Because I like Arabic.
I don't like Urdu at all.

334
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,749
You insolent boy!

335
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,072
Who are you to decide

336
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,238
what's good and what isn't.

337
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,352
This won't be tolerated here!

338
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,995
I've heard

339
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,349
you don't play with the others,

340
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,955
you wander outside the madrasa.

341
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,439
Some westernized schoolboys
must be corrupting you!

342
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,276
Understood?

343
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,159
Yes.

344
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,550
Get out!

345
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,630
They say I hang out in the bazaar,

346
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,278
with boys from un-lslamic schools.

347
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,151
But I never leave the madrasa.

348
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,798
I have no place to go.

349
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,712
This madrasa is my home.

350
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,838
I want to take you somewhere.
Do you want to go?

351
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,916
- Where?
- The place I go every day.

352
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,353
My secret hideaway.

353
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,035
Let's go.

354
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,433
I had no idea such a place
existed behind the madrasa!

355
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,758
Watch your step.

356
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,472
Do you get a strange scent?
Try to smell it.

357
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,193
Where did you get all this?

358
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,630
I just collect it. Nice isn't it?

359
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,758
See the picture of a winged horse?

360
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,113
I drew it myself.

361
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,071
What incredible stuff!

362
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,670
Only you and my special friend
know this place.

363
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,279
He comes here?

364
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,756
Remember the sweets
I gave you that night?

365
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,591
He gives me a lot of things.
But no one can see him.

366
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,192
Only he cares for me.

367
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,749
- Let me show you something.
- What?

368
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,555
Look at this!

369
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,913
Isn't it neat?

370
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,834
Her fever isn't going down.

371
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,510
Your medicine helped her last night

372
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,510
but now she's worse.
She needs a doctor.

373
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,798
No, she will get better.

374
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,433
Have trust in Allah.

375
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,711
Don't worry, I brought medicine.

376
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,276
The doctor refused to give it
without seeing her

377
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,393
but I explained the situation
and told him her symptoms.

378
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,113
He gave this syrup.

379
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,751
Give her one dose in the morning
and one in the evening.

380
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,272
How is she?

381
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,229
Give that to me.

382
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,552
You have no idea.

383
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,750
You know what
this antibiotic will do?

384
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,119
It will totally destroy
the effect of my treatment.

385
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,278
After much effort

386
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,755
I found a special remedy.

387
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,909
It's the best homeopathy
for her fever.

388
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,189
You understand?

389
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,228
Rokon, hurry up!
A rainstorm is coming!

390
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,555
Uncle Milon!

391
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,433
Asma is very ill.
We must go immediately.

392
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,076
I've arranged your leave.
Go get your things.

393
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,911
Fulpur! Anyone for Fulpur!

394
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,508
Milon!
Good that you brought Anu.

395
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,678
Karim, let's go.

396
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,917
Every day,
the floodwaters are rising...

397
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,272
Your mother did try to save her.

398
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,718
But luck wasn't on her side.

399
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,637
Uncle!

400
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,795
It's Allah's will.

401
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,474
You have to be strong
for your mother's sake.

402
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,515
She struggled so hard
with your sister.

403
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,313
I remember

404
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,470
when your mother came to
the house as a young bride.

405
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,276
She was like Asma, very restless.

406
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,232
She was only fourteen.

407
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,438
Kazi was much older

408
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,719
so she used to play with Milon.

409
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,558
Kazi was very different then.

410
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,872
He dressed like an Englishman.

411
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,595
But he suddenly changed.

412
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,598
He became deeply religious.

413
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,440
What a change that was.

414
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,592
Suddenly,
with toupee cap and beard...

415
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,994
His wife's games ended then.

416
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,390
A wall sprouted around the house.

417
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,638
She had to wear a veil,
even at home.

418
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,594
Kazi was a new Muslim,
full of fervor!

419
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,399
Your father is more mellow now.

420
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,239
<i>.... We bring you forth as infants</i>

421
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,878
<i>and make you reach youth</i>

422
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,312
<i>Some of you die at an early age</i>

423
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,832
<i>... Thus you see barrenness,</i>

424
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:40,878
<i>but when We bring the waters</i>
<i>down upon Earth</i>

425
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:48,191
<i>the land becomes alive</i>
<i>with exquisite flora and fauna</i>

426
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,230
<i>For Allah is the ultimate Truth</i>

427
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,513
<i>and He will bring the dead to life</i>

428
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,634
Rokon!

429
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,508
Lbrahim sir, where's Rokon?

430
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,477
He was here not long ago.
Look around.

431
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,588
What are you drawing?

432
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,753
I've been looking for you.

433
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,235
- When did you get back?
- A little while ago.

434
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,555
How's your sister?

435
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,834
She's... no more.

436
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,757
- What happened?
- Some kind of fever. I don't know.

437
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,838
Where do people go when they die?
What happens to them?

438
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,955
- I think they turn into birds.
- Really?

439
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,831
Anu, something's happening to me.

440
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,590
I couldn't sleep last night.

441
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,956
There's a strange noise in my ears.

442
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,994
It keeps getting louder.

443
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,312
Your hair's gotten long.

444
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,034
Yes, I've got to cut it again.

445
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,629
What's this?

446
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,111
It's a flute to charm snakes.

447
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,357
Just fasting and prayer
don't make you a Muslim.

448
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,152
You need true conviction.

449
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,312
Islam is a total way of life.

450
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,874
Thus it differs
from other religions.

451
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,595
It guides
not just our religious life.

452
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,473
Our social, economic, cultural,

453
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,558
even our political way of life

454
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,673
are clearly prescribed by Islam.

455
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,352
To understand this
you need Islamic knowledge.

456
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,397
But knowledge is not enough.

457
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,631
We also need Islamic practice.

458
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,879
In the name of secularism,
our sacred Muslim land

459
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,550
is being threatened
by forces of blasphemy.

460
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,230
We must be brave and confront them.

461
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,111
We have to prepare ourselves.

462
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,515
If needed, we will make Jihad!

463
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,519
Hurry up!

464
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,275
We have to make 300 before sunset.

465
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,950
Do we really need so many?

466
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,719
In Arabia,

467
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,993
stones or clay
were used after toilet.

468
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,797
But our country is full of water

469
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,273
and water cleans a lot better.

470
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,028
No one's stopping you
from using water.

471
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,312
But using clay is Muhammad's way.

472
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,235
That's true.

473
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,757
The Arab system's still better
than the English one.

474
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,511
Englishmen destroy trees
to make toilet paper,

475
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,471
but does it clean properly?

476
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,674
How did you find
the Head Sir's speech?

477
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,396
Wasn't it inspiring?

478
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,309
Yes, it was indeed.

479
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,157
But I have
a few modest reservations.

480
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,031
Such as?

481
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,989
What he said about
knowledge and practice,

482
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,872
could mislead the pupils.

483
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,958
You see,

484
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,789
Islam didn't spread here
through the sword.

485
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,430
It was the selfless Sufis
who went to low caste Hindus

486
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,031
to spread Islam's message
of peace and equality.

487
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,668
The kings of Iran and Arabia
conquered land

488
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,075
but not people's hearts.

489
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,430
It was thanks to the Sufis
that people embraced Islam.

490
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,914
The truth is:

491
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,670
You cannot make Islam
flourish with politics or arms.

492
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,670
It's by spreading Islamic knowledge

493
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,236
that Islam will prosper.

494
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,473
So our mission is only
to spread knowledge?

495
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,399
Knowledge for knowledge's sake?

496
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,236
No.

497
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,272
What are we doing here?
This is not just knowledge.

498
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,799
This is also practice.

499
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,879
Who is sent to madrasa?

500
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,512
Mostly orphans,

501
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,438
and children whose parents

502
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,791
are too poor to afford
food and clothing,

503
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,797
not to mention education.

504
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,034
They are sent to madrasa.

505
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,236
Our duty is to take care of them

506
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,874
and make them into true Muslims.

507
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,029
It's unfair to use
these children for political ends.

508
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,676
But in the name of secularism
the communists are endangering

509
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,155
the very existence of Islam.

510
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,920
Don't we need to confront them?

511
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,194
Then what's the difference
between the communists and us?

512
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,798
Can you separate Islam
from politics?

513
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,309
Now Pakistan's unity is at stake.

514
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,953
If Pakistan is torn apart,

515
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,277
Islam will be weakened as well.

516
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,552
Halim Miah, tell me one thing,

517
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,070
if Pakistan collapses,
why would Islam be endangered?

518
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,873
What makes you think that?

519
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,119
Did Pakistan establish Islam,
or rather enforce military rule?

520
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,397
Let's kill a bird with my slingshot.

521
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,632
There goes Nutty Boy!

522
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,878
Let's see where he goes.

523
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,752
Keep quiet. He'll hear us.

524
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,313
Throw it!

525
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,712
What's the matter?

526
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,795
Halim Miah!

527
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,275
What's going on?

528
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,078
It's Rokon,
he's been acting strangely of late.

529
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,508
His head's overheated.

530
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,712
Pour water on his head.

531
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,350
Then lock him in the storeroom.

532
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,470
Yes sir.

533
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,116
Let me see. How is he?

534
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,597
I've brought Rokon's food.

535
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,949
Let's go then.

536
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,517
Is he going to be all right?

537
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,397
I consulted a doctor.

538
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,592
He gave some medicine.

539
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,035
Give it after his meal.

540
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,955
The Head Sir
mustn't know about this.

541
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,954
Yes sir.

542
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,759
It's me Anwar...

543
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,476
Anu.

544
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,912
Do you recognize me?

545
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,709
Anu's mother?

546
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,310
If you continue to be frozen
with grief like this

547
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,959
you'll break down
physically and mentally.

548
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,832
I think you should go out,

549
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,430
maybe take a trip or something.

550
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,998
Once, home and outside
were like heaven and earth for me,

551
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,268
now it's all the same.

552
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,519
What I meant was...

553
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,197
If you went to your brother's place
for a few days,

554
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,153
you might feel better.

555
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,430
If I go, I won't go for a few days.

556
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,996
I'll go for a long, long time.

557
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,835
Why are you talking about leaving?

558
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,155
I know you don't like me anymore,

559
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,677
but this house is yours too.

560
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,594
Isn't it?

561
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,396
I've been rotting in this house
for those I loved,

562
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,676
but they've all gone.

563
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,995
There's nothing to hold me back.

564
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,469
Is this grief yours alone?

565
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,750
Haven't I suffered too?
Don't I have my own pain?

566
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,673
You do.

567
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,199
Those who hurt others
may have their own pain too.

568
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,919
Uttam, try to understand.

569
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,396
It's not a matter of democracy
or national liberation,

570
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,828
the issue is economic.

571
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,316
Here lies the question
of imperialism and class struggle.

572
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,829
You're still spellbound by
your communist ghosts.

573
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,315
You know something,

574
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,513
despite your differences,
you're like your brother.

575
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,070
Kazi's homeopathy
and your "Marx-pathy"

576
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,111
both came from Germany.

577
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,959
And fascism is also from Germany.

578
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,870
Whether Marxism or capitalism...
All "isms" are western.

579
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,596
These isms & schisms
just leave us screwed in the end!

580
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,789
So you also dismiss Islam
as western?

581
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,955
Not at all.

582
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,755
Our Islam has flourished
on our own soil.

583
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,794
Nothing's purely indigenous,
it's all mixed up.

584
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,310
Sit down.

585
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,673
- How is Rokon?
- He's worse today.

586
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,996
He didn't sleep last night.

587
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,072
He's out of medicine.

588
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,919
Go past the courthouse, take a left,

589
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,395
then take a right,

590
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,389
on the next corner is the pharmacy.

591
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,512
Show this prescription
and get more medicine.

592
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,799
Anwar, be careful!

593
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,549
The town isn't safe these days.

594
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,155
Yes, sir.

595
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,873
- May peace be upon you.
- Upon you also.

596
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,433
Peace for the people!

597
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,232
Vote for Boat Symbol!

598
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,115
<i>This is radio Pakistan.</i>

599
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,550
<i>Now a special election bulletin.</i>

600
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,076
<i>In Faridpur-2, the Awami league</i>
<i>candidate is ahead of</i>

601
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:17,035
<i>the Muslim league candidate</i>
<i>by a margin of 5,200 votes.</i>

602
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,389
Kazi?

603
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,352
Are you home?

604
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,389
Who's that?

605
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,033
Karim?

606
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,954
Come in.

607
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,595
What's the news?

608
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,436
My wife is much worse,

609
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,078
she's been in terrible pain.

610
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,075
Please give me some medicine.

611
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,436
I stopped giving medicine at home.

612
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,473
Go see the doctor in town.

613
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,151
I don't have money for a doctor.

614
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,830
Please, at least blow a prayer
on a glass of water.

615
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,278
I don't do that.

616
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,074
<i>In Chittagong-3,</i>
<i>the Awami league candidate defeated</i>

617
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,238
<i>the Nezam-e-lslam candidate</i>

618
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,352
<i>by 10,304</i> votes.

619
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,757
Take this money,

620
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,317
and take her to a doctor.

621
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,155
Go forward!

622
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,396
Go on!

623
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,676
Go further!

624
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,878
Allah, free this stupid boy

625
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,514
from the clutches
of the evil spirit.

626
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,188
<i>Allah is healer and forgiverl</i>

627
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,876
You must immerse yourself 101 times.

628
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,400
It'll force the evil spirit to flee.

629
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,633
Begin!

630
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,670
Go under!

631
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,155
One...

632
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,516
two...

633
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,276
three...

634
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,197
four...

635
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,470
five...

636
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,190
six...

637
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,956
seven...

638
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,308
He doesn't feel the cold.

639
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,916
It's going straight
to the evil spirit.

640
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,036
Eight...

641
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,190
nine...

642
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,750
ten...

643
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,039
He doesn't feel the beatings at all.

644
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,954
It's hitting
on the evil spirit's head!

645
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,870
Fourteen...

646
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,516
fifteen...

647
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,590
sixteen...

648
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,830
<i>All praise be to Allahl</i>

649
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,476
The spirit was bound to flee.

650
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,476
Halim Miah!

651
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,959
Bring him up!

652
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,671
<i>Rokeya, my daughterl</i>

653
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,350
Milon, can I take you across?

654
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,189
No, I'm going to Uttam's place.
Can you take me there?

655
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,916
Well, I've got ferry duty,

656
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,672
but I'll give you a quick drop.

657
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,352
What a game those English
got stuck in your heads!

658
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,472
Games shouldn't last
more than one hour.

659
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,597
But those cricket games

660
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,631
go on for five, six days...

661
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,751
Our "Danguli" sport
is more sensible.

662
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,839
There's no more game now,
all games are up.

663
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,279
They've stopped the cricket
to broadcast Yahya's speech.

664
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,277
The new parliament is cancelled.

665
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,633
We should have known,
that despite our victory,

666
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,230
the Pak army would never
concede power to the Bengalis.

667
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,954
The stadium must be on fire by now.

668
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,990
There's only one way left,
to fight for freedom.

669
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,909
Politics is just another game,

670
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,760
there's no benefit for you and me.

671
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,757
If people only knew

672
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,393
what true freedom is...

673
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,558
Blindly religious people like you

674
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,594
are to blame for the mess
our country's in today.

675
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,793
What did you say?
"Blindly religious"!

676
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,517
Actually no true religion,

677
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:53,956
be it Islamic, Hindu or Christian

678
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,471
will ever make people blind.

679
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,356
True faith opens your eyes!

680
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,636
<i>All games are forbidden</i>

681
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,398
<i>in Islam except threel</i>

682
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,718
<i>The horse race,</i>

683
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,230
<i>the sword fight</i>
<i>and the martial art of stick play.</i>

684
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,873
Hey you, come here!

685
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,074
One, two, three, four. Go back!

686
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,032
Now you, come!

687
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,595
One, two, three...

688
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,914
Stupid boy!
You almost got hurt. Go back!

689
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,759
Now split into pairs and fight.

690
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,269
Oh Ali!

691
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,193
Rokon, I'm leaving.

692
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,914
Come with me.

693
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,397
You go Anu.

694
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,670
I've got nowhere to go to.

695
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,234
This is for you.

696
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,878
What's in it?

697
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,199
Something special.

698
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,954
I should go.

699
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,434
Good bye.

700
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,316
Not on March 26th,

701
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,318
around 11 PM, the 25th.

702
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,110
What a horror it was!

703
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,393
There was massive gunfire.

704
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,353
The tanks came out on the streets.

705
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,918
People were screaming...

706
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,553
Where did they attack first?

707
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:07,194
First at the police barracks
then in the University area.

708
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,833
How did you escape?

709
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,034
They briefly lifted the curfew

710
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,074
and we fled
across the river to Jinjira.

711
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,113
There were thousands of refugees.

712
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,757
All went there to save their lives.

713
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,715
Later, the Army came and
shot at them randomly.

714
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,956
We heard that many people
were killed there.

715
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,948
We managed to flee,
on foot, on rickshaw,

716
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,596
by boat, whatever means
we could find...

717
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,633
<i>Ali, the Tiger of Allah,</i>
<i>thinks himself so handsome</i>

718
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,355
<i>seeing his own</i>
<i>masculine beauty in the mirror</i>

719
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,758
<i>Ali's son Hossain tells his father:</i>

720
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,236
<i>"If you only knew</i>
<i>my mother's true beauty"</i>

721
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,868
<i>Ali rushes to his wife and says:</i>
<i>"Show me your beauty"</i>

722
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,231
<i>"That you've hidden</i>
<i>even from your husband"</i>

723
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,112
<i>Fatema replies:</i>
<i>"It's not a physical beauty"</i>

724
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,835
<i>"That can be seen</i>
<i>with the naked eye"</i>

725
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,828
<i>Then Fatema utters her curse:</i>

726
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,950
<i>"Whoever beheld my divine image</i>
<i>will die in a fratricidal war"</i>

727
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,789
<i>Ali says: "Your curse is for</i>
<i>none other than your own son"</i>

728
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:34,191
<i>"Hossain witnessed your sacred self</i>
<i>in an invisible mosque"</i>

729
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,638
<i>Hearing Fatema's cry</i>
<i>Allah says: "I can save your son,"</i>

730
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,752
<i>"but no other child will</i>
<i>be spared their mother's curse"</i>

731
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,832
<i>Cries out Earth-Mother Fatema:</i>
<i>"O Allah, let me loose my son,"</i>

732
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:52,556
<i>"but let no other child</i>
<i>suffer the same fate"</i>

733
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,152
<i>The grace of Muhammad's daughter</i>
<i>illuminates the world</i>

734
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,875
<i>Thus Fatema's pain redeems</i>
<i>the suffering of all women...</i>

735
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,915
Ayesha!

736
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,756
Look at all the flowers
on her grave.

737
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,509
Just the other day,
Asma used to play here.

738
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,119
Do you remember

739
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,998
when we used to run around

740
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,316
and play hopscotch under this tree?

741
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,391
Look!

742
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,954
Asma loved butterflies.

743
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,435
I'd just started wearing saris.

744
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,835
We were playing and it came loose.

745
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,919
I was so embarrassed...

746
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,838
It all seems so far away.

747
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,752
What's near then?

748
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,838
- The fight.
- Fight?

749
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,792
What fight are you talking about?

750
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,878
Fight for freedom.
The Army's killing everyone.

751
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,198
We have to stop them.

752
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,549
I want to do something.

753
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,077
I want to go and resist...

754
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,990
You're all leaving this house.

755
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,675
I've got nowhere to go.

756
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,111
I've got no war to fight.

757
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,759
You go...

758
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,752
All of you...

759
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,397
They say the Army's coming
to Kumargonj any day.

760
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,475
They're already in Faridpur.

761
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:40,912
Wherever they go,
they burn homes and kill people.

762
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,431
Don't believe everything you hear.

763
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,315
They're coming to protect Islam,
to maintain peace.

764
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,272
Why would they kill people?

765
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,956
Why should Muslims kill Muslims?

766
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,593
What should we do now?

767
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,872
Other villagers are fleeing.

768
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,117
Some students raided
the police armory,

769
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,198
they've taken position
on the bridge.

770
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,992
They're planning to resist.

771
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,316
What's the point of resisting?

772
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,637
If you resist,
you'll just provoke them.

773
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,354
They say your brother is with them.

774
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,270
How did he get into this?

775
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,911
We must stop this foolishness.

776
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,874
You seniors
should talk them out of it.

777
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,317
The situation's getting worse.

778
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,349
Islam will prevail. Don't worry.

779
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,711
<i>If you wish to go to heaven</i>
<i>keep fear of Allah in your heart</i>

780
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,275
<i>If you want to be close to Allah</i>
<i>keep love within your heart</i>

781
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,349
<i>I'm just your daughter's age</i>

782
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,235
<i>I'll assume the side of sharia</i>
<i>to take an anti-Sufi stance</i>

783
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,149
<i>Don't take what I say to heart</i>

784
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,273
<i>You ignore the Holy Scriptures</i>
<i>What kind of Muslims are you?</i>

785
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,359
<i>Why are the mullahs</i>
<i>always angry with you?</i>

786
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,791
<i>Keep fear of Allah in your heart</i>

787
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,115
<i>You need wisdom to grasp the Koran</i>

788
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,154
<i>How can half-read mullahs</i>
<i>interpret intricate Scriptures?</i>

789
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,875
<i>Without knowing the text</i>
<i>they preach to others</i>

790
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,550
<i>The dogmatic mullahs</i>
<i>make a living from deception</i>

791
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,872
<i>We don't lust for heaven</i>

792
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,957
<i>We have no fear of hell</i>

793
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,720
<i>If you want to be close to Allah</i>
<i>keep love within your heart</i>

794
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,595
<i>You Sufis chant Allah's name</i>
<i>ignoring creed and prayer</i>

795
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,509
<i>You smoke pot during Ramadan</i>
<i>with the excuse of meditation</i>

796
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,315
<i>You don't go on pilgrimage,</i>
<i>you don't give charity</i>

797
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,149
<i>What do you have against</i>
<i>ritual sacrifice?</i>

798
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,750
<i>Why should Muslims</i>
<i>quaver at the sight of blood?</i>

799
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,508
<i>Keep fear of Allah in you heart</i>

800
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,675
<i>You're asked to sacrifice</i>
<i>your dearest ones</i>

801
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,474
<i>Are cows and goats</i>
<i>your most beloved?</i>

802
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,354
<i>Nothing is dearer than yourself</i>

803
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,950
<i>The supreme sacrifice</i>
<i>is self sacrifice</i>

804
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,790
<i>If you can, restrain your senses</i>
<i>and control your passions</i>

805
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,515
<i>Keep love within your heart</i>

806
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,589
<i>You roam around with women</i>
<i>without wedding them</i>

807
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,837
<i>You dance and sing together</i>
<i>without shame</i>

808
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,476
<i>The outside world is for men</i>
<i>The woman's place is at home</i>

809
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,355
<i>Keep fear of Allah in your heart</i>

810
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,475
<i>Woman is the seed of life,</i>
<i>source of creation</i>

811
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,672
<i>Those who believe in inequality</i>
<i>ock women into marriage</i>

812
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,352
<i>Woman is the vessel of love,</i>
<i>the Mother</i>

813
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,829
<i>Without her</i>
<i>we wouldn't come to earth</i>

814
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:28,752
<i>You need both man and woman</i>
<i>for procreation and creation</i>

815
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:34,917
<i>If you want to be close to Allah</i>
<i>keep love within your heart...</i>

816
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,669
I heard the Army's already
in Kumarganj.

817
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,310
If the Army's in Kumarganj,

818
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,158
why should that affect us?

819
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,510
Everyone's leaving.

820
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,119
What should we do?

821
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,955
The Army won't come to the village.

822
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,994
Calm down!

823
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,114
My Anu?

824
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,392
What will happen to him?

825
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,519
He's quite safe in the madrasa.

826
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,671
They say
there's fighting in the cities.

827
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,837
The Army isn't here to fight.

828
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,197
They've come to keep the peace.

829
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,350
I heard

830
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,590
Milon's gone to fight at the bridge.

831
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,268
He's a fool!

832
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,432
Don't even mention his name.

833
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,799
Don't worry.

834
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,314
Things will return to normal soon.

835
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,315
Ma!

836
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,915
The Army's coming!
They're burning houses!

837
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,876
- I'm so glad you've come!
- What do you mean?

838
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,719
I would have gone mad without him.

839
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,153
Can't you hear?

840
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,878
Where will I go with my Anu?

841
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,274
Kazi!

842
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,200
The Army's arrived!

843
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,119
Do you understand now?
Let's go. Please!

844
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,072
Everyone's hiding in the jungle!

845
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,229
Please come with us,
for Anu's sake.

846
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,113
You go ahead.
I'll look after the house.

847
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:12,117
<i>Allah you are sacred</i>
<i>We bring suffering on ourselves</i>

848
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,988
Let's go back.
I can't bear it anymore.

849
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,636
Anu's mother!

850
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,078
Who's there? Karim!

851
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,473
Don't worry!

852
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,398
The Army's gone.

853
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,595
Anu's father!

854
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,395
Karim,

855
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,999
any news from Milon?

856
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,714
There was a big fight on the bridge.

857
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:19,876
Ma.

858
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,588
Where are we?

859
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,633
Anu's father,
how did you pass the night?

860
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,118
Are you alright?
Did anything happen to you?

861
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,075
My books!

862
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,954
My house!

863
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,268
My home!

864
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,789
Is there anything left of it?

865
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,035
Come father! Let's go.

866
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,268
Look around you!

867
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,638
Your Muslim brothers have burnt

868
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,912
your sacred cloister to the ground.

869
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,840
Father!
Let's get out of here!

870
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,955
Father!

871
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,434
Let's go!

872
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,955
Where are you going?

873
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,072
I don't know
but there's no point in staying.

874
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,229
The Army's out again this morning!

875
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,034
They're shooting at people randomly.

876
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,196
They're burning everything.

877
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,238
And those who fought on the bridge?

878
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,715
They're all dead. All of them.

879
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,952
Not a single one left alive.

880
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,033
Anu...

881
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,559
let's go.

882
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,309
Please, come.
