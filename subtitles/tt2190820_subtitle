1
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,644
Hussaini speaking.

2
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:44,937
Work's done?

3
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,044
Work's done with the
blessings of the law.

4
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,040
And how is my son?

5
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,744
Rahil's phone has been
switched off since last night.

6
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,870
What the hell do I do
with this bastard son of mine?

7
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,245
Your son..you have
made him what he is.

8
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,042
Yeah. That is the tragedy of it all.

9
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,404
Anyhow. May Allah protect you!

10
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,808
May Allah protect you!

11
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,342
I swear. I had no idea.

12
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,538
I am telling you the truth.
That's what he told me.

13
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,069
What truth are you talking about?

14
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,539
I swear. I did not know.

15
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,142
Do you have a cigarette?

16
00:06:58,467 --> 00:06:59,707
Here.

17
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,676
Bring it forward.

18
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,173
Why did you do it?

19
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,404
They put Charlie in my hands, buddy.

20
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,971
You know how it is with me.

21
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,479
What could I do? What could I do?

22
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,712
This is why you did this?

23
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,772
Everyone thought
I was a..

24
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,711
Now look around. Who is the idiot?

25
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:42,768
You are an..

26
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,244
Yeah? See, who is the. now?

27
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,873
You still are an idiot.

28
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,210
All my life I have
thought about this..

29
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,372
Moment of death.

30
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,909
But now that it has arrived,
there is nothing special about it.

31
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,705
No White light.

32
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,713
It is only dark, Jesus.

33
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,179
It was my mistake, God.

34
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,770
Should have thought about life too.

35
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,409
Is there anyone who can deny fate?

36
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,670
What had to happen has happened.

37
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,081
And now what is
left is my loneliness.

38
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,080
But for this one friend I have.

39
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,984
And it shall remain with
me through this endless night.

40
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:25,204
Sir.

41
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,414
An inspector from Hill Road
police station is here to see you.

42
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,008
Good morning, sir.

43
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,604
Morning.

44
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,447
Are you the investigating
officer of this case? - Yes, sir.

45
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,976
Weird case.

46
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,472
Multiple homicides. Hidden cameras.

47
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,444
Crime scene recordings.

48
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,770
The media will sensationalize
this case for at least a week.

49
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,776
Any arrests? - No, sir.

50
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,771
Sir, I haven't Watched
the recordings yet.

51
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,877
And the protocol says that
the evidence should first be..

52
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,435
Oh! I see.

53
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:11,012
So, you're one of these
protocol following officers.

54
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,978
You, Ravi Nambyar.
Have you seen the video?

55
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,099
Yes, sir. As you requested.

56
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,307
...l've arranged all the
footages chronologically.

57
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,605
According to the date and time.

58
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,113
Yeah. So do we have a case?

59
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,644
Sir, I suggest that
you see that for yourself.

60
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:29,475
So..inspector Sameera Pavate.
Should we?

61
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,609
Of course, sir.
- You're the investigating officer.

62
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,671
Your approval is important.

63
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,168
That's what the protocol says.

64
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,109
You've already intervened once.

65
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,107
Sir, we've the same static
frame for the next 20 minutes.

66
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,673
No activity.

67
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,079
It's not my fault.
- What do you want me to do?

68
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,204
The police arrived. I had to run.
I don't know where he went.

69
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,976
I told you to take care of him.
You can't do one thing right.

70
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,969
Sir, this is where the
crime scene footage ends.

71
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,445
The media's full.

72
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,977
You were saying there
was some other footage.

73
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,109
Yes, sir.
There are recordings of 15 days.

74
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,476
And on 7 different dates.

75
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,011
So, what's the total footage?

76
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,544
Sir, 50 minutes 37 seconds.

77
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,670
Sir, should we see the recording
immediately before this?

78
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,745
No, let's watch from the beginning.

79
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:28,443
Let's find out why
these youngsters.

80
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,814
Let's first figure out how these
amateurs ended up where they did.

81
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:36,111
Sir, this is day 1 of the media.
5th December.

82
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,638
Shhhh..You will wake my dad
from his grave. Will that be nice?

83
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,010
Would you like it if my dad gets up
from his grave? What are you doing?

84
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:54,605
Sammy, pass.

85
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,535
Don't give her.

86
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,611
You don't have it.

87
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,739
Last time you smoked the pot
and you were coughing for a week.

88
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,141
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

89
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,840
Okay. Nothing will happen.

90
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,578
Do gargles in the morning.

91
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,238
Sorry. I am going
to bang this bong first.

92
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,608
My turn.

93
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,644
Are all these victims
in the footage?

94
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,002
No, sir.

95
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,647
No, sir. Not the boy in blue shirt

96
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,940
You guys are wasting all
the stuff because of this bong shit.

97
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,139
It's not a problem.

98
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,080
I've got a load of stash inside.
Don't worry.

99
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,971
Patty, go ahead.

100
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,473
Dude, careful talking about stash.
Dhobale has got his men everywhere.

101
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,609
What the fuck this is?

102
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,976
Patty, what have you done?
You have not fingered the hole.

103
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:47,778
It's all about when to
finger a hole and when not to.

104
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,574
When to put a finger
in the hole and when not to.

105
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:55,309
Sir, please these two
naive girls are not getting it.

106
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,041
So lord, please explain
it to them in more detail.

107
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,779
Of course. Of course.

108
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,643
Get ready.

109
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,375
Who wants to sit Where?
- Front seat.

110
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,539
The audience is ready.
- Audience, are you ready?

111
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,477
Yes, of course.

112
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,571
Respected. - Action.

113
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,675
Ladies and gentlemen.

114
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:16,838
Welcome to 'bong sucking class'.

115
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,381
This thing. Take a look here.

116
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:24,812
This long thing that
you see in my hands.

117
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,211
...is called a 'bong'.
Cameraman, please close in.

118
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,042
Look at this bong.
Nina, please make a close up.

119
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:37,081
There are two kinds of holes in a bong.
One large hole and one small hole.

120
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,703
Yuck! I can't do this anymore.

121
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:44,308
Look closely at my lips.

122
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,006
Alright.

123
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,774
<i>Okay.-</i>

124
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,506
Easy, easy.

125
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,737
Patty, you try.

126
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,507
"L once had a sweetheart"

127
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,477
"She was my heartbeat."

128
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,777
"She was my heartbeat."

129
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,074
"She was my heartbeat."

130
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,873
"She was my heartbeat."

131
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,708
Sir, I forward this?

132
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,537
You know what time it is?

133
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,605
It's Charlie time.

134
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,307
Will you hurry up, fatso?

135
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:46,606
Over acting.

136
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,340
I am the director.

137
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,107
You're the director.

138
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,404
Nina, go for it.

139
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,109
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

140
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,374
Nina. Nina, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

141
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,538
I know how it is.
Please let's move.

142
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,046
Sammy.

143
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,042
F' atty.

144
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,207
Tajmahal.

145
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,977
Girls, girls.

146
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,537
Naughty girls.

147
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:41,711
Sure..

148
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,980
Cuckoo bird approaches the parrot.

149
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:48,743
And another rejection for cuckoo.

150
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,444
Poor cuckoo.

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,443
Cuckoo.

152
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,937
Holy cow.

153
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,176
Who the hell is this bomb?

154
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,975
Agra, my boy is going mental.

155
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,844
This was as well.

156
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:22,276
I see. So,
she has a bodyguard as well.

157
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,374
Will you kiss her?

158
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,643
Hey! If the girl is not willing,
why don't you let off, dude?

159
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,469
Let her be.

160
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:45,180
Handle with care, buddy.

161
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,675
Very good.

162
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,044
Finally got the pink slip.

163
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,132
Hey! Can't you see?

164
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,635
You want to mess with him?!

165
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,138
Punch!

166
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,311
Action sequence.

167
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,411
Leave him. Leave him.

168
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,205
Sammy.

169
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:06,745
Leave him.

170
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,974
In this story have so much fun..

171
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:14,346
Sammy, no. Sammy, don't.

172
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:17,641
Sammy, no. Sammy, no.

173
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:18,968
Here..

174
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,644
Sammy, no. No.

175
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,638
Guys come on!

176
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,878
I said okay.

177
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,571
That's enough, enough.
Enough. It's enough.

178
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,944
I am cool. I am cool. - It's over.

179
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:35,107
Sam, no. Leave him now.

180
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,940
Leave it now. Leave it. - Sam.

181
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,804
Come on, man. Chill. It's over.

182
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,266
What chill? Do I have
a bloody air conditioner in me?

183
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,466
Why are you shouting at him?

184
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:45,311
Didn't I tell you
not to bring him along?

185
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,805
Bloody hell. - Where are you going?

186
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,141
It's the same problem
with you everywhere.

187
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,805
Sorry. Sorry.

188
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,913
Why are you doing this?
- I will bash your brains out.

189
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,113
Come here. - Sammy.

190
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,106
Stop it. Okay. That's enough.

191
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:05,537
Oh hell!
Always you've to do this. Always.

192
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:11,042
You don't know who he is.
He is a superman.

193
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,673
Chill out. This is ridiculous.

194
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,143
I don't know why l..
- You got great action or not?

195
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,944
Great, dude.
Like Rocky Balboa. Rocky Balboa.

196
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,669
Come on.

197
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,609
Let's go dirty dancing.

198
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,213
No more drugs for her.
- Let's go, baby.

199
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,140
Sammy, I am going to the car.

200
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,511
Patty, move. What are you doing?

201
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,337
Nina, we are also coming.

202
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:46,105
Patty. Patty, I am sorry.
Let's go now.

203
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,543
So much fun. - Forget the fun.

204
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,178
It Wasn't fun.

205
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,443
What the. - Oh my God!

206
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,969
There is a car behind us.

207
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,740
Stop the car.

208
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,245
How the hell do I do that?
He is banging from behind.

209
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,178
You have to stop the car.

210
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,046
We're going to die!
We're going to die!

211
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,705
We're going to die!

212
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,537
There are two against one.

213
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,873
They'll manage. What more could I do?

214
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh my God!

215
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,907
Sam, don't. - Beat him.

216
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,604
Beat him. Beat the rascal. Beat him.

217
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,771
Oh no!

218
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:45,737
Hey man!
Hey! Hey you! - Don't touch him!

219
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,843
I don't know what happened.

220
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,446
Hey stop that! Let's get out of here.

221
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,037
Let's go. - Sam, he will die.

222
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,944
Let him die then. Get lost.

223
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,437
What if someone saw us?
My God! My God!

224
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,107
Which road is this?

225
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,047
Sir, it's impossible to tell.
It is pitch dark.

226
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,378
And the license number.

227
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,443
Sir, we don't have a single frame.

228
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,846
What's the use of
all your tech expertise?

229
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,342
The date is 6th December, right?

230
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,434
He must be alive.

231
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,204
Take out a bulletin.

232
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,571
This accident must be registered
in some police station. - Yes, sir.

233
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,543
This is not done.

234
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,377
This is so..not done.

235
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,708
Okay, Sam. I really need
you to understand something.

236
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,973
Relax. First let's go in.

237
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:37,204
After that you got down.

238
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,644
And he pushed you first. - Come in.

239
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:39,407
Bloodstains, man. Bloodstains.

240
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,674
And you hit back in self-defense.

241
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,170
You've to get this right, Sam. - Sit.

242
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,804
I want you to understand this.
Okay? - Sit down.

243
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,975
Sit down. - Listen, Sam.

244
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,946
Was that asshole your long lost
brother? Someone very dear to you?

245
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,806
Why are you creating such ruckus?

246
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,199
What is your problem? - Chill. Chill.

247
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,273
I am chilled out. You try and
understand. The situation we are in.

248
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,106
Sam, there was a car there.
They saw us there.

249
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,641
Before they report us,
we should file a report.

250
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,974
Do you get that?

251
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,645
Common sense, guys. Stop freaking out.

252
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,079
Relax. We did make the call.
Patty, chill.

253
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,213
After 20 minutes.
That was so nice of you.

254
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,576
What would we tell the police?
What would we've told them?

255
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,570
We are on cocaine and alcohol.
What should we have told them?

256
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,974
Sir, we were playing
kung fu on the road.

257
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,947
Suddenly this guy like a jackass jumped
right in front of the car and you know..

258
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,840
We forgot to note down
the license plate also.

259
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,775
Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.
Take us to the jail, sir

260
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,074
Do you see the blood stains?
- No one's going to jail.

261
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,306
Do you see these blood
stains on my shirt'?

262
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,835
Just wash it off.
- Can you see the blood stains?

263
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:37,966
We could've taken him
to the hospital, guys.

264
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,880
There was still a twitch in his hand
and he was bleeding from his mouth.

265
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,842
It seems that we are
the bloody villains here.

266
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,369
What the fuck are you guys up to?
Just chill, Patty.

267
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:45,571
You're asking me to chill.
- Let's chill.

268
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,909
Yeah. Let's chill.
Let's get some more coke.

269
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,068
And sniff it all. - Chill. Chill.

270
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,666
And let's go party somewhere else.

271
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,908
And let's chill.
ls this what you want?

272
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,138
Oh no! Are you mad? - Chill!

273
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,637
Chill! Chill!

274
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,137
Fucking bitch!

275
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,974
It's okay.

276
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,035
I hate you. - Take her away.

277
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,377
She just isn't getting it.
- Shhhh..quiet down.

278
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,408
Relax. Relax.

279
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,799
Everyone was going through this shit.

280
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,508
Relax. Relax. Do you want
the neighbors to come here?

281
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,580
Relax. Jeevs, come on.

282
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,206
Close the door.

283
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,274
Thank you.

284
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:24,110
I will make such a fantastic film that
the entire World will sing my praise.

285
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:26,844
I will make such a film.

286
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,571
I will make such a film.

287
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:40,445
I am the king of the world.

288
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:43,173
I am the king of the world.

289
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,943
I am the king of the world.

290
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:48,808
I am the king of the world.

291
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,375
Deepak Kaye.

292
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,837
Not Deepak Kaye. It's Deepak K.

293
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:58,976
What's wrong with Deepak Kumar?
Your real name?

294
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,679
It's numerology.
Adds to your style quotient.

295
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,077
Style? I can see it.

296
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,376
Agra college. BA pass style.

297
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:12,540
Jeevanlal Trivedi,
you can just forget about it.

298
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,843
You've been here for 15 years.
Does anyone know you?

299
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,544
Mark my words. If I don't
get launched within this year..

300
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,545
“Then you can change my name.

301
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,944
You are already getting launched.
- What.

302
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:25,773
No, no. I mean it's great.

303
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,974
If you get launched, then I'll
get to bask in the glory as well.

304
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,443
Scoundrel.

305
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,679
Then I'll take this along.

306
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,507
Keep that down.

307
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,866
I will fix things up for you.

308
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,177
Forget it!
You can't do a thing. Leave it.

309
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,012
Love is not easy. Don't grumble.

310
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,104
Just watch what happens next.

311
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:58,275
What is this injustice, God?

312
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:02,376
He's surrounded by chicks
and I can't get even one.

313
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,935
Let's see what else is around.

314
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:06,940
This one won't do.

315
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,246
Oh! Pure butter and cream.
Wonder where you got it from, beauty?

316
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:16,841
Who are you? Let's see your face now.
Come in the focus, dear.

317
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:20,474
Such a pretty smile.
Shit! It's her again.

318
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,340
Oh Lord, do not forget she is mine.

319
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,707
Sam. Sam. Sam. Dude.

320
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,277
It's her, the girl from the nightclub.

321
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:30,207
Did you forget the night before?

322
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:33,579
The boy you fought with,
she was with him.

323
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,678
Shut up.

324
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:43,007
She is waving at you, man.

325
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,407
She is lighting up a cigarette.

326
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,108
And Sam reaches the girl.

327
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,780
What a lucky..

328
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,302
What is this beep sound?

329
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,340
Sir, I think the battery
of his camera is down.

330
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:07,103
Oh no. Not now.

331
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,244
They're shooting a conspiracy theory..

332
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,644
...and haven't charged the batteries.

333
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,276
Bloody amateurs.

334
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,974
Dude, what were you two talking about?

335
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,413
We were discussing
the beauty of the sea.

336
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,575
Come on, dude. Don't get irritated.

337
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,576
Tell me please.

338
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,872
This is once in a life opportunity.

339
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,077
I won't let it go by.

340
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,279
Yeah, dude.
We should grab this opportunity.

341
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,443
That I surely will.

342
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,680
No need to be so stressed.

343
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,008
You won't realize when the job's done.

344
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,880
Here comes the superstar
and psycho girlfriend.

345
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,673
Time for some melodrama.

346
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,405
Best of luck, Sam. Action.

347
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,137
How are you? - Great.

348
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,570
What happened?

349
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,072
You called. You were so excited.

350
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,769
Well, the news is such.

351
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,205
What happened?

352
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,303
You remember our friend
from the night before.

353
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,210
Yeah. - What happened? Is he dead?

354
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,579
No. I didn't see anything
in the newspapers.

355
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,139
Situation is a little
more complicated.

356
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,805
What? What happened? What happened?

357
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,810
A friend of his came to meet me today.

358
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,038
Who?

359
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,203
Friend of Rahil. Hera.

360
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,966
What the fuck! Who is Rahil?

361
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,913
You don't know who Rahil is?
- No. I don't know who he is.

362
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:34,012
The other night..the guy you smashed
into the speeding car. Accident.

363
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:37,173
I don't want to talk about this.
I have told you before.

364
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:40,476
The spark has been ignited.
There is going to be a blast soon.

365
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,809
She gave me an amazing piece of news.

366
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,068
Just hear it.

367
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,670
What? She knows.

368
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,513
Right. - Oh no!

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,344
Dude, you are freaking
me out now. Fuck.

370
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,209
There's another
interesting piece of news.

371
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,144
What?

372
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,010
Rahil used to work for Azmat Khan.

373
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,403
Who is Azmat Khan?

374
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,274
This is bullshit. Okay.

375
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,105
How do you know if
she is telling the truth?

376
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,838
You'll believe
everything she says now?

377
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,578
Who..who Azmat Khan?

378
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,580
Azmat Khan is a big don.
He lives in Dubai.

379
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,477
Read the newspapers.
She is talking crap, get that.

380
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,069
Tell her.. - Just listen. Just listen.

381
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:23,944
Maybe she's taking Azmat
Khan's name only for the effect.

382
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,913
But the point is, she knows.

383
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,978
This is not happening.
- I don't believe it.

384
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,310
Listen. What does she want from you?

385
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:37,003
Us! She needs us for an assignment.

386
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,641
- What assignment?
- Us? She only needs you!

387
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:39,934
What is the assignment?

388
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,566
<i>Assignment that Rah“
was supposed to do.</i>

389
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,013
No, I don't want
to do anything. - What?

390
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,576
What is happening?

391
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,733
We need to move some stuff.

392
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,645
What the fuck does that mean?
Move some stuff? Are you mad?

393
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,007
It means.

394
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,006
Now do you get it?

395
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,407
Charlie. You want to shift Charlie?

396
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,447
Have you lost your brains?
We have to do it.

397
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,699
Nina, I am going.
He has lost his mind.

398
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,941
Going? Go Where?

399
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,042
Talk properly.

400
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:09,205
Nina, I am the one caught up in this.
All of you need to help me now.

401
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:10,837
We don't need to help you.

402
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,277
O hero. - What?

403
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,240
We're all involved in this, get that?

404
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,177
Now whatever will happen to me,
will happen to everyone.

405
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,680
If I get trapped in this,
I'll take everyone down with me.

406
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:23,610
Listen, you junior artist.
You can do whatever you want.

407
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,577
Junior artist.

408
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,405
You fought with him at the nightclub.

409
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,571
This is your shit, man.
Why should we get involved?

410
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,099
You can do whatever you want.
This is your..

411
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,910
It was you,
who shoved him in front of the car.

412
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,975
You kicked him, didn't you?

413
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,874
And he fell down.

414
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,477
This is my shit?

415
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,337
If Azmat Khan's gang
gets to know this.

416
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,069
...all of us are going
to be neck deep in shit.

417
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:46,379
And I am definitely
not going to be alone there.

418
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,737
Get that?
- You can do whatever you want.

419
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,508
I won't do anything. - Chill.
Chill. Chill down. Chill down.

420
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,569
Put some brains into this half-genius.

421
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,204
One head butt and he'll roll over the
wall. He'll know what is what then.

422
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:56,769
You want to hit me. Come on then.

423
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,074
I am going to hit you bad, buddy.

424
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,044
What does he think of himself?

425
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:01,411
Guys, just chill. Okay.

426
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,435
Come on, come here. - Just shut.

427
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,103
No, no, no, listen.

428
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,903
Don't create a scene here. Okay?

429
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,670
We'll go home and talk about this.
Okay, baby. Baby.

430
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,876
Baby, I've an audition to go to.
I am going.

431
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,503
Get going, go to your audition.
- We're leaving. Okay.

432
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:15,912
We're leaving.
- Go to your audition. Coward.

433
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,372
What is this pussy
going to audition for?

434
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,546
This is not fair.

435
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:28,671
And what he did, was that fair?

436
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,571
He was trying to save
your ass there. Really.

437
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,874
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
give him license to fuck it then.

438
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,844
We should've let you die there, Sam.

439
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,740
Nina, don't say that.

440
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,974
Don't say that.

441
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,804
They are planning a heist
on Azmat Khan's cocaine.

442
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,335
Sir, there was an intelligence report

443
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,142
That before dying,
Hussaini was going to...

444
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,771
...pick up a huge
consignment of cocaine.

445
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,341
Ah! That is a perplexing situation.

446
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,710
You're being childish.

447
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,780
You believe just anyone.
- Not anyone. Sam did.

448
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,503
And Sam will never
want anything bad for me.

449
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,103
Yes, only I will want
something bad for you. Right?

450
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,438
Sam has a PhD on drug peddling. Right?

451
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,409
Why are you not getting this?

452
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,906
You know, what options do we have?

453
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:18,366
If we go to the police,
We'll be jailed.

454
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,971
They are not going to spare us.

455
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,299
And I don't want to do that.

456
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,007
My father will take
me back to Kolkata.

457
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,507
I don't want to do that. Okay?

458
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,535
And if we don't do it,
then that don Azmat Khan.

459
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,809
...or whatever his name is,
he will 5"" us over.

460
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,613
We don't have a choice. Okay?

461
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,346
And baby, and your Jeevs,
who was smoking with you.

462
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,738
...has already said yes to it.

463
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,278
Patty has also said yes.
We're the only ones left. Okay?

464
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:44,947
And by the way,
we don't have to do anything. Okay?

465
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,474
Sam will take the delivery.

466
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,979
We just have to shift
it from one car to another.

467
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,309
What shift? Are you mad?

468
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,878
This isn't some shooting
shift We're talking about.

469
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,308
Baby, this Sam will get us all killed.

470
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:58,041
We're actors, get that?
We aren't peddlers.

471
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,178
You are an actor. That is such a joke.

472
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,246
Yeah, of course, you are an actor.
There is a billboard of you right outside.

473
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,746
And people are in queue
for your autographs.

474
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,813
You're an actor.
Does anyone know you?

475
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,038
When did you work last?
Do you have any money?

476
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,309
Who paid for this t-shorts
and shorts? I did.

477
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,778
Are you going to tell me
about that now? - Yes, I will.

478
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,643
Because your father doesn't ask.

479
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,146
...for an account of
your money every month.

480
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:19,368
You getting it.

481
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,874
It's very easy for you.

482
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:26,448
And by the way, listen. Okay. Listen.

483
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,073
Sam's said. - Sam, yes.

484
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,309
Tell me this is not about Sam.
- This is not about Sam.

485
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,410
This is not about Sam. Okay?

486
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,776
This..listen.

487
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,507
This is for us.

488
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,011
This is for us, baby.
You and me. You and me.

489
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:45,444
Sam's said We'll be paid
two cores for doing this.

490
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,409
How much? - Two cores.

491
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,476
Yes. Two cores. Imagine.

492
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:54,014
We can make our own film.

493
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,707
We will produce it. We'll launch it.

494
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,543
We can be in the lead.

495
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,466
Imagine, baby. Just one time.

496
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,413
We've to do this just one
time and we can make our own film.

497
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,541
Baby, it's our dream. Right?

498
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,411
Come on. Once. Please say yes.

499
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,340
Okay. Okay. Okay?

500
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,708
Yeah, okay.

501
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,307
That's why I love you.

502
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,275
Rascal. - The door opened
automatically. Sorry.

503
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,370
Close it.

504
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,538
So, you tell me. - Okay.

505
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,473
That's Nina. Deepak. Sam and Patty.

506
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,043
And me, Jeevs.

507
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,841
Me Sohail.

508
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,046
How are you, Sohail?
- I said I am fine.

509
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,612
Let's talk business.

510
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,740
Sohail has a foolproof arrangement.

511
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,470
He will tell all of you.
- Just a minute. What's going on?

512
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,913
What are you doing?
Switch it off. Switch it off.

513
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:52,244
It's okay. I am making a private film.
Don't worry.

514
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,166
Private film in a public place.
Do it in your home. Stop it here.

515
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,340
Stop it. - Just be real.

516
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,344
Hey David Dhawan, don't you get it?

517
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,699
Tell him. - Calm down.

518
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,373
Switch it off. - What are you doing?

519
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,038
I hate waking up so early.

520
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,904
It isn't even sunrise yet.

521
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,002
I didn't wake you up to go to school.

522
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,511
Anyhow, this is your idea.

523
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,305
Can't you pamper me a little?

524
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:26,805
You're always so serious.

525
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,946
Baby has got a cactus up his ass.

526
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,303
And anyway, all this is fine
if you want to romance in jail.

527
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:35,576
Otherwise let's just stay focused.
Okay? - Yeah.

528
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,171
Listen.

529
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,978
Thank you.

530
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,242
You are not upset with me?

531
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,402
Where would I be being upset with you?

532
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:54,312
I love you, baby.
Come here. Come here.

533
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:00,113
What are you doing? - Again.

534
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,075
Hi.

535
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,344
Let's go. Let's go. - Sam. Sam.

536
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,642
Can I come with you?

537
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,833
Switch off the camera
and sit in the car. Hurry up.

538
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:09,676
<i>Okay.-</i>

539
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,981
Full exchange, goods exchange.

540
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,841
She's been sleeping
with Dips for six months.

541
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:41,076
And if I touch Sam..

542
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:44,412
Nina! Nina will feel bad!

543
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,072
Why? Why can't she
just stick to that one guy?

544
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,805
What's her issue?

545
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,469
And Nina..

546
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,207
Nina can never be anyone's.

547
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,345
She just wants to..twirl
around both of them.

548
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:05,979
All the fun.

549
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:07,871
All the fun.

550
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,140
They are here.

551
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:19,011
Hi. - Hello.

552
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:21,676
How are you?

553
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,737
Daylight heist at Pali-Naka.

554
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,143
They have really chosen the most
secretive location to transfer the bags.

555
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:29,804
Very intelligent.

556
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,604
What are you doing?
- Are you still angry?

557
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:36,539
Who am I to stay angry?

558
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:42,768
Let's go.

559
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,775
Call me. Okay?

560
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,778
Take care of yourself.

561
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,812
So you were saying about Nina.

562
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,937
Switch off the camera.

563
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,811
They have left an entire movie behind.

564
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,777
But still it is hard
to fuzz out the details.

565
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,204
Sir, can I ask one thing?

566
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,311
Just don't go on puzzle mode on me.

567
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,873
Later.

568
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,272
My head is very woolly right now.

569
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:30,637
But sir,
why did they have to do all this?

570
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:33,214
They could've come to
the police after the accident.

571
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,669
Were you ever involved
in a hit-and-run?

572
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,469
It scares people shitless.

573
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,741
But they seem to be normal people. How
could they even think this through?

574
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,769
Did you see the size of those bags?

575
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,645
It's worth millions.

576
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,805
Won't you do it if you get the chance?

577
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,899
Sir, I will never be able to do it.

578
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,437
I see. You're too honest.

579
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,711
Mumbai police is proud of you.

580
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,310
Believe me, sir.
I never even cheated in my life.

581
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,678
My dad said it once.
- Fine, fine. Later. Later.

582
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,675
Come on, play the video.

583
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,873
How did they find Rahil's body?

584
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,099
You said you took care of it.

585
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,807
How did they find his body?

586
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,480
Nothing will happen. Okay. - Nothing.

587
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,499
How will they know who is responsible?

588
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,003
Are you crazy? Don't do that.

589
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,766
If Rahil is dead, then who the
hell went to take the delivery?

590
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:26,871
His bloody ghost?

591
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,208
I know all that.

592
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:30,407
But they don't know
that you're responsible.

593
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,709
You really think of yourself
as the smartest arse, don't you'?

594
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,269
And why are you bloody laughing?

595
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,437
And what are we going to do with
the cocaine that we have in the car?

596
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:40,707
What will we do with that?

597
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,142
Azmat's gang.

598
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,577
They'll burn us all alive.

599
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,047
You do not have to sell the consignment.
That is Sohail's responsibility.

600
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:53,871
And when Sohail's caught,
what will he tell the police?

601
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,243
"Anna Hazare asked me
to collect the consignment."

602
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,644
He will take our name. Right? - Relax.

603
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:01,909
Nothing's going to happen. Just chill.

604
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,074
Chill!

605
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,945
Don't do that. Don't.

606
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:10,076
Now the coke will remain where it is.

607
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,476
Till the time you tell
me what their plan actually is.

608
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,605
It will remain in the car. That is it!

609
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:16,341
The plan will not change.

610
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,444
Leave the rest to me.
I still have aces up my sleeve.

611
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,480
This woman is our Armageddon.

612
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,771
Now this is a problem, Herra.

613
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,446
Rahil's body is really bad luck for us.

614
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,742
What if the others find out?

615
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:39,671
You know Dips. He will be in a rage.

616
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,640
How will they get to know, baby?

617
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:42,968
From you?

618
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,075
No, I didn't say that.

619
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:49,476
But..l am human after all.

620
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,670
Desires.

621
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,071
Blackmail, huh! - No, no.

622
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,448
I mean if everyone
asks me what happened.

623
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:06,748
They are my friends, after all.
What will I tell them?

624
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,041
Jeevs baby. - Yes.

625
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,512
You love me. Right? - Of course.

626
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:13,342
I've got a gift for you. - Really?

627
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,980
This is unbelievable. Seriously.

628
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:21,273
Just a little longer.

629
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,236
Then anything's possible.

630
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,644
Anything's possible.
Anything's possible.

631
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:31,774
Bugger off. Just switch off the camera.
Are you a bloody mad bugger?

632
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,470
How many times do I have to tell you?

633
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,945
No camera.
Switch it off. Don't you bloody get it?

634
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,672
I am living off your favors.
I will do as you say. Right?

635
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,073
You said and I did it. Okay.

636
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,601
<i>Okay.-</i>

637
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,680
Why..why are you blaming me?
Why are you blaming me?

638
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,710
Dips, I remember this
was our common decision. Okay?

639
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,144
We both had a..
- Not at all. Not at all.

640
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,643
It was all about "Sam this, Sam that".

641
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:56,611
And I was listening.

642
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,876
It's done now.

643
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,280
The police and gangsters
both will kill us.

644
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:04,241
We're all in a mess because of Sam.
- What Sam?

645
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,014
I am talking about us, Dips.

646
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,202
If not for Sam,
why the hell are we in this mess?

647
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,611
Would you let go of this already.

648
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:14,102
Really.

649
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:17,339
I mean, am I with you or with Sam?

650
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:21,543
Well, if you want, you may go sit with him.
I am sure he understands you better.

651
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,446
That is why when he was with you he was
sleeping with half the girls in Bandra.

652
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,075
What?

653
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,436
Wow! - Sorry.

654
00:41:32,634 --> 00:41:34,875
No, thank you.
- Fine. I said it in a fit of rage.

655
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,573
I really needed this right now.

656
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,941
Nina, what the. - Awesome. Thank you.

657
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,546
It is okay, Nina. - Thank you.

658
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,979
Life is a bitch and I am a dog.

659
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,678
Just go away from here, Jeevs.
I don't want to talk to you.

660
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:52,111
What's the matter? Dips there
seems so upset and you seem so glum too.

661
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,442
What's Wrong?

662
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,610
Yeah. Because life's not a bitch.

663
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:59,544
Nina is. All this is
happening because of me.

664
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,069
All because of me.

665
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:02,940
I took all the decisions.

666
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:08,009
Nobody respects me. - I do. I do.

667
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,840
What? - Respect.

668
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,808
Yourself.
- Everyone respects themselves.

669
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,945
I respect you, Nina.

670
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,668
I am serious.

671
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:20,145
You are sweet, Jeevs. Sweet.

672
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,439
Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,733
Second time someone's called me sweet.

674
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:25,338
Who said it the first time?

675
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,302
You did, just now.

676
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,044
Second time.

677
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,103
That was such a bad joke.

678
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:35,208
Actually, I had a girlfriend
and she called me sweet.

679
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,210
Girlfriend? Okay, not bad.

680
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,478
Come on. Who was she? - l..

681
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,137
I am better behind the camera.
- Don't be a spoilsport.

682
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,443
Camera's rolling and action.

683
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,409
I had a girlfriend. She called me sweet.

684
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,946
Where is she?

685
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,277
She ran away. - With whom?

686
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,037
With a friend of mine. - What?

687
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:01,444
Forget that. Tell me what's
going on between you and Patty.

688
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,310
Tell me that.
What's going on between you and Patty?

689
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:05,707
Patty.

690
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,374
Patty.

691
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:12,943
Patty.

692
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,507
Patty doesn't understand.

693
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,441
She is after Sam.

694
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:22,376
Sam. Nothing is possible
between Sam and her.

695
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,971
Sam's scared. If you find out.

696
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,774
So what if I find out?

697
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,699
Really, what difference does it make?

698
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,409
No. l..wasn't trying to say that.

699
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:35,343
Are you crying?

700
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:36,505
I am not crying.

701
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,614
You know, I've an image
that I always cry. But I don't.

702
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,111
Look, if you're crying,
then please don't cry.

703
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,011
I am with you. l..

704
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:49,033
What were you doing? - l..l..

705
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:51,166
What were you doing?
- I was just console..consoling.

706
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,579
Consoling? Jeevs,
you were hitting on me, don't lie.

707
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,204
Nina, please listen. - Damn you.

708
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,746
You're disgusting.
You're sick. You're a psycho.

709
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,475
I was consoling.
- Don't ever talk to me again.

710
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:04,274
Don't tell Sam about this
or We'll have a disagreement.

711
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,810
She is so soft.

712
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,910
But of all the people, me?

713
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,638
No. I don't know, Herra.

714
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,906
Just listen to me. Okay?

715
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,512
They won't find out anything.

716
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:19,312
I guarantee you that.
- How can you guarantee that?

717
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:22,377
I know it. I know. I know how it works.

718
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:26,214
Your bag. - Thank you.

719
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:29,374
What can we do? - We will.

720
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,515
Was your name on the list?
- Yes, it was but.

721
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:33,544
What is this?

722
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,704
Can we get some privacy? - Sure, sure.

723
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:38,577
What can we do? - Let me think.

724
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:43,241
It's really easy for you, Sammy.

725
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,372
Because you didn't get a phone call.

726
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,946
Then I will go. - Yes, you do that.

727
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:50,875
Tension there, tension here.
What happened?

728
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:55,273
Dips got a call from Dubai
to meet someone called Jabber.

729
00:44:55,434 --> 00:44:57,038
Now who is Jabber?

730
00:44:57,734 --> 00:45:01,307
According to Herra,
he works for Azmat Khan. - What?

731
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,510
Yeah. - What does he want?

732
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:08,937
He wants to know who had
assaulted Rahil at the night club.

733
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,743
So is..Dips going? - Yes, I am going.

734
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,811
What? - No, no, no.

735
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,940
Baby, if I don't go,
they will come home.

736
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,273
Yeah, but I am not
getting a good feeling.

737
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,405
Why? Everything was
taken care of. Right?

738
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,573
If anything happens to me,
it's all on you.

739
00:45:24,034 --> 00:45:26,299
It's not that serious.
- I see. Not serious.

740
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,780
Yeah, right. Not serious.

741
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,747
We take everything seriously,
don't we? - Relax.

742
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,305
Really! - Relax.

743
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,839
I don't want to be here. Okay? Bye.

744
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,676
Nina, l..
- Dips, come. We'll just go home.

745
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,303
Jeevan, I forgot my bag again.

746
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:45,414
Please get it for me.
- Yeah. Sure, Herra.

747
00:45:47,534 --> 00:45:48,945
The plot thickens.

748
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,246
Jabbar's calling them himself.

749
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:56,944
What date's the recording?

750
00:45:57,534 --> 00:46:00,447
17th December. - 17th December.

751
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:04,140
17th December is when we found..

752
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:07,142
...Hussani's dead body
was found in Madh creek.

753
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,437
Sir, I am sure this
is the same consignment.

754
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:14,208
...that Hussani was going
to collect before he died.

755
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,348
But he isn't talking
about any consignment.

756
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,845
He is asking about Rahil.

757
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:22,538
Why is Rahil so important?

758
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,372
Do we know anything about Rahil?

759
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,603
No, sir. Nothing yet.

760
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:37,466
Look, Hussani and Jabber are..

761
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:40,448
...Azmat's most trusted men in Mumbai.

762
00:46:41,967 --> 00:46:43,878
Hussani gets murdered.

763
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,133
The coke consignment vanishes.

764
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:48,205
And Jabber's looking for Rahil.

765
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,366
And this girl Herra tells them..

766
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,608
“That Rahil had to
pick up this consignment.

767
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,012
Sir, that means this girl Herra..

768
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:59,275
...was also involved in Hussani's murder.

769
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:05,043
And now she's using them
to transfer that consignment.

770
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,178
Call up the vigilance.

771
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,566
Find out whether Azmat
Khan or any of his men..

772
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,309
...called this boy Dips or not.

773
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,240
Yes, sir.

774
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,003
If We're lucky, we might
find out what they talked about.

775
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,972
That's too much.

776
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,810
Too much.

777
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:19,605
Oh no!

778
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:52,176
"Herra."

779
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:56,240
"I love you."

780
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,903
Sorry, sir. Sir, I will forward this.

781
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,410
Anything, just signal
us and we will come. - Yeah.

782
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:08,038
I just know. Okay. - I love you.

783
00:49:08,267 --> 00:49:09,644
Love you too.

784
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,306
Dude, all the best.

785
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:35,406
Oh no. That's a car.
That's a car. That's a car.

786
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,308
Chill. Chill. Chill. Relax. Relax.

787
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,413
<i>Okay.-</i>

788
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,470
Relax. - Oh my God!

789
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,805
Why is he going in? - Relax.

790
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:48,304
He's such a fool.
I told him to stay outside and talk.

791
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:49,573
Relax.

792
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,344
He's just doing as
they're telling him to.

793
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,480
Relax. - Jeevs, can you see anything?

794
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:57,772
I can't see a thing from here.

795
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,999
Where are you going?

796
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,708
I wanted to know what's
going on with whom.

797
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,410
Herra. Who else?

798
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:14,238
I can't tell you anything
for sure about her.

799
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:19,305
It's okay. Don't tell him.

800
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,713
Don't tell Sam that I asked.

801
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,404
Come on, babes. - And stay here.

802
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:27,705
Yeah, I am there.
But babes, I never gossip.

803
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,779
I am sure.

804
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,202
I know.

805
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,880
But if you want..you can tell him.

806
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,977
Okay. Fine. I will tell him.

807
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,947
It's not necessary. If you want.

808
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:50,944
If you feel you don't want to tell him,
it's fine with me.

809
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:52,807
Really. You know.

810
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:56,475
You're strange, babes. - Yeah. I mean..

811
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,814
Oh, oh, he's out. He's out.

812
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,377
He's out.

813
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,775
Okay, baby.

814
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:12,138
Okay, baby.
Come, come, come, come, come.

815
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:18,611
What? Baby, what happened?
- What happened?

816
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:21,408
Nothing. They just threatened me and..

817
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,710
And what? - Slapped me.

818
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:23,803
Slapped you. - What?

819
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,141
Where? - How bad?

820
00:51:25,367 --> 00:51:26,573
It's okay. - Slapped you Where?

821
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:28,978
Will you switch off the camera? - Yes.

822
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,639
You really thought
that I an": heartbroken?

823
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:36,512
Oh Lord! What a hot chick she is.
Just let me do her once.

824
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:42,411
Why are you crying?
His was the only shoulder you found?

825
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,311
Dips. - I am paranoid.

826
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,369
Dips, you're hurting me.
- I am paranoid.

827
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,706
Don't you fucking get it?
They know everything.

828
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,537
Don't you dare come here.
I am warning you.

829
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,204
Why are you threatening him?

830
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,942
Don't interfere between us.
This is our personal matter. Get that.

831
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:56,269
Nina.

832
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,280
Listen. - Look,
I don't trust you people at all.

833
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:00,875
Gangsters are out to get me.

834
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,241
That's enough from you.

835
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:04,506
Baby, just listen to me once.

836
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,338
Just listen once what Sam's saying.

837
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:08,808
Look, look, look, just listen.
- Just once.

838
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:10,845
Sohail has cracked the deal.

839
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,343
We just have to give
the final delivery tomorrow.

840
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:14,813
Yes, I know it's as
easy as you say it is.

841
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:17,345
Nina, please let's get out of this.

842
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,232
Baby, please. We'll figure this out.

843
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,271
Tomorrow at this time
We'll be counting money.

844
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:22,779
Is it that easy?

845
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,771
Jabber will kill us all.

846
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,743
They don't even spare their own men.
They killed Hussani.

847
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,212
There was such a big
article in the papers.

848
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:33,281
Talk softly. - What softly?

849
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:36,277
Dips. Dips, listen. Listen, Dips.

850
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,408
He's such a coward.

851
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,011
He comes to me often.

852
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,169
How many times shall I refuse him?

853
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:45,779
Refuse him for what?

854
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:47,578
For Nina.

855
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:49,241
Tell me.

856
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,112
You know what you need to do.

857
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:55,775
Give it back to him.

858
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,738
Here you go, Patty.

859
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:04,913
The solution to all your
problems is here. Charlie.

860
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:10,273
Come on, come on.

861
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,940
Back, back, go back.
Police. - Take it back.

862
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:16,848
Faster. Faster. - They're coming.

863
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:19,177
Faster. This way. - This way.

864
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,838
Come on, come on. Take the exit.

865
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:24,940
That way. In the front. - Left.

866
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:27,671
Run, run, run. That way.

867
00:53:28,134 --> 00:53:30,566
Get up, get up. Get up. Police.

868
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,274
Run. Jeevs, run. - Jeevs, run. Run.

869
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,678
Jeevs, run.

870
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,510
Come on, come on.

871
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,140
Come on, come on.

872
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,278
This way, this way.

873
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,173
What is she doing here?

874
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,780
We changed cars four times
so she doesn't find out.

875
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,506
Asshole slept with her
twice and blurted everything.

876
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:06,108
I really need to figure
out story behind this girl.

877
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:10,208
Don't you tell Sam.
I am not a bloody amateur.

878
00:54:10,234 --> 00:54:12,077
I am going after her. - Dude.

879
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:12,975
All the best.

880
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:19,270
Patty.

881
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,713
Patty, just get out of there.

882
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:25,141
Just get out of there. That.

883
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,937
To hell with your boss.

884
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:30,615
Hell with him. Just get out of there.

885
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,610
And don't go home. Meet us at the den.

886
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:43,513
Nina. Nina, listen to me.

887
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:45,338
It's not my fault.

888
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:47,874
The cops came and we just ran.

889
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:49,306
I don't know where he's gone.

890
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:52,505
I told you to look after him, Sammy.

891
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:53,478
You can't do a single thing.

892
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,379
And I told you he will mess things up.

893
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:58,038
He didn't mess it up.
- He messed things up.

894
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:59,478
And ran away. - He didn't mess it up.

895
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,133
No, no. - Nina, he has fled.

896
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:02,704
No. - I am there for you.

897
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:05,874
No, Sam, he cannot leave me.

898
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:07,479
He has fled!

899
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,702
I will make things right.

900
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:19,010
Patty, it's not what.
- Then what is it?

901
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:19,873
What are you saying?

902
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:21,707
I will never go back to Sam again.

903
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,007
What are you saying? - Wretch.

904
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,505
Patty.

905
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:28,377
If you can't be mine,
you can't be anyone else's.

906
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:31,210
So this is how it ended.

907
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:34,514
<i>Their bitter-sweet story.</i>

908
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,142
She is lying.

909
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,376
They didn't..kill Jeevan.

910
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,569
Sir, the reports haven't arrived yet.

911
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,208
And according to forensics.

912
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:56,476
...Jeevan was shot from Sam's pistol.

913
00:55:56,734 --> 00:55:59,476
<i>Et too, Brutus.</i>

914
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,970
Sir, do you think Jeevan knew..

915
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:15,406
...Jabbar was going to kill all of them?

916
00:56:16,434 --> 00:56:18,209
The question is, Pawata.

917
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:21,408
...why did Jabber want to kill them?

918
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:24,509
Because they transferred
Hussani's consignment.

919
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,442
That's what I thought too.

920
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:30,346
But just two scenes earlier,
my theory proved to be erroneous.

921
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:36,307
Yesterday morning the
narcotics department“.

922
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,845
...seized 50 kilos of cocaine
from Andheri in a raid.

923
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,274
Yes, sir. The same raid that we saw.

924
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,774
And at 11 o'clock they found out that.

925
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:48,443
...what they thought was
the year's biggest seizure.

926
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:52,038
...was actually 50 kilos of boric powder.

927
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,973
What? Boric powder?

928
00:56:56,634 --> 00:57:01,674
That means. - These children
mistook boric powder for cocaine.

929
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,404
And also died because of it.

930
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:08,014
How can that be, sir?
- Now that is how it is.

931
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:13,113
Sir, there's just one person
who can tell us what happened.

932
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:16,412
The ANC Wouldn't have
released Sohail yet.

933
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,380
Send a custody request for Sohail.

934
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:23,071
I think he won't remain
behind bars for too long..

935
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,205
...for the possession of boric powder.

936
00:57:27,434 --> 00:57:32,508
Longer it takes,
more complicated story it will become.

937
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:42,779
They were predestined to their fates.

938
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:47,371
If not for me,
there would have been someone else.

939
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,111
They had to die, anyway.

940
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:57,647
But then why do I feel
this desire to confess?

941
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:03,277
I am not what they thought of me.

942
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:16,011
Sir, isn't it possible that the consignment
they picked was cocaine only..

943
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,343
...and then someone changed
it at the parking lot?

944
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:21,142
As long as we don't know which one is a
lie we will have to believe everything.

945
00:58:22,034 --> 00:58:27,040
But none of them seem
clever enough to pull it off.

946
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,138
But sir, why would anyone do this?

947
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,538
Boric powder instead of cocaine.

948
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:33,007
And what would be the motive?

949
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,477
The narcotics division seized.

950
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,380
...two kilos of cocaine on
2nd December from a South African.

951
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,037
Later they found out
that it was just a decoy.

952
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:44,114
Because the real shipment
was arriving a week later.

953
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:46,907
So you mean to say
they were just a decoy.

954
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:49,908
And the real consignments
delivered somewhere else.

955
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:54,848
To allow safe passage to the big fish
smaller fishes need to be sacrificed.

956
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:57,269
Think hard.

957
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,211
Jabber, who is Azmat Khan's
most trusted man after Hussani.

958
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:07,406
Why will he get involved
with these people?

959
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:12,043
Sir, I am sure one of them knows
where the real delivery's been made.

960
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,576
Well, these are dead.
And Herra and Dips are missing.

961
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:22,408
So only Sohail can shed
some light on this matter.

962
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,374
Sohail Azam, sir.

963
00:59:25,434 --> 00:59:28,643
He's from Jalpaiguri.
He's been arrested twice before.

964
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:31,646
Once he was released
due to some technicality.

965
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,905
And second time he
was jailed for a year.

966
00:59:34,934 --> 00:59:37,175
He's known to be linked
to both Hussani and Jabber.

967
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:44,310
Get the belt.

968
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:49,240
Hello, sir.

969
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:50,911
Sir.

970
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:54,374
Sir.

971
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,908
Sir, I am just the driver.

972
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:01,975
I carry stuff around as
per my boss's orders. That's all.

973
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,532
Sir, I am just a servant.

974
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:06,444
I only do what my bosses tell me to.

975
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:07,874
I swear on my mother.
I am telling the truth.

976
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:09,344
I just.

977
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:11,604
Sir, honestly.

978
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:15,172
What was my question? - Sir..Yes.

979
01:00:15,233 --> 01:00:17,975
What was it that I asked you, you pimp?

980
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,702
Sorry, sir.

981
01:00:19,734 --> 01:00:22,874
I didn't ask you anything.
Why are you blabbering?

982
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,211
Sit.

983
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:26,778
You go out.

984
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,380
Now I am asking you.

985
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,408
What kind of stuff did you carry around?

986
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,713
Sir, why would the boss tell
a servant about what kind of stuff.

987
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:50,739
Really. So you never saw anything?
Or heard perhaps?

988
01:00:51,434 --> 01:00:52,845
What is the name of your boss?

989
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,235
Rahil.

990
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,573
When did you talk to him last?

991
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,346
He's the boss. He doesn't talk.

992
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,380
He only gives orders over the phone.

993
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,706
Do you want third degree?

994
01:01:03,734 --> 01:01:05,407
Do you know what third degree is? - Yes.

995
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,501
Ask, sir.

996
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,010
When did you talk to your boss last?

997
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:11,043
Yesterday.
Yesterday he called and asked me..

998
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,545
...to pick up the car from the parking.

999
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,907
Directly with your boss? - Yes.

1000
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:18,107
You bloody pimp.

1001
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,772
Is your fucking
boss reincarnation of...

1002
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,711
...Jesus Christ who
will resurrect after dying?

1003
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,545
What are you saying, sir?

1004
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,643
What was in the car?

1005
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,177
What was in the car?

1006
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,545
I swear on my mother. I don't know.

1007
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,477
I see. - But Sam didn't say that.

1008
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:41,912
He said that the final
delivery was your responsibility.

1009
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:44,672
You told everyone
how to deliver the goods.

1010
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,813
He is a lying bastard.

1011
01:01:47,134 --> 01:01:49,512
Shut your trap. Don't get loud here.

1012
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:53,141
So you know Sam.

1013
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,038
Think it over.

1014
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,806
Maybe you can figure out
something else from Rahil's tale.

1015
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,447
Sir, they are setting me up.
I swear on my mother.

1016
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,310
You blood pimp.
You already are set up.

1017
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:11,076
Jeevan, Deepak, Nina, Sam, Patty.

1018
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,807
They all took your name.

1019
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:14,911
It was entirely their plan.

1020
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:16,911
I was just a last minute addition.

1021
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:21,072
I have lot of cases. So do not faff
around. Just tell me the whole truth.

1022
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:26,807
Sir, he is a very dangerous guy.
He will skin me alive.

1023
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,542
If you don't tell the truth,
then I will skin you alive.

1024
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:35,673
You know, Sam.

1025
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,837
He knows me since three years.

1026
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,941
Go on. - Sam works for Hussani.

1027
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:44,436
What job? - Distribution.

1028
01:02:44,834 --> 01:02:46,711
We both get along together.

1029
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:49,008
Many a times he
gave me stuff on credit.

1030
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,509
So you are Sam's peddler.

1031
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:54,174
Yes.

1032
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:56,913
Then why did you claim
to work for Rahil then?

1033
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,801
Sir.

1034
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,239
Why did you say it?

1035
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,071
Sam told me to say so.

1036
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:04,302
When did he say it?

1037
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,707
In the meeting. He told everyone.

1038
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,780
That if anyone gets caught,
we must name it all on Rahil.

1039
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,010
How did you get involved in this plan?

1040
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,678
Sir, Sam called me two weeks ago.

1041
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:28,314
You called, boss.

1042
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:31,472
So, 'good for nothing'.
How's the business?

1043
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,544
What do I say, bro?
All according to whims of the cops.

1044
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,371
They are a little soft these days.

1045
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:42,706
Tell the boss to increase supply.
So that I can make a bigger cut.

1046
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:45,112
How much can you handle?

1047
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:49,745
In this situation,
three times the normal.

1048
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:51,511
Rascal.

1049
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:57,039
If I give you two weeks' credit,
how much can you sell?

1050
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,746
What are you saying?

1051
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:01,379
In two weeks, I can make a million.

1052
01:04:01,634 --> 01:04:02,772
Sure.

1053
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:06,905
Asshole.

1054
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:11,281
Sorry. - Don't use your brains.

1055
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:15,175
There's a card in my clothes. Get that.

1056
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,169
There's a number written on it. - Yes.

1057
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,709
Of a girl called Herra. - Yes. Hira.

1058
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,274
Herra. - Hira.

1059
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,237
Do as she says. Get that?

1060
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,147
Yes. - Get lost. Go.

1061
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,570
So where did you meet the girl?

1062
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:47,145
She called me at Pali Naka.

1063
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,180
Don't say anything rubbish.

1064
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:51,710
They should feel
that you're a big fixer.

1065
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,173
Madam, I am..

1066
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,338
Madam, how much will be the goods?

1067
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,038
You don't need to know that.

1068
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:02,610
No. What if someone asks me?
What will I say?

1069
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,374
No one will ask you anything.
And I will be there.

1070
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,773
Just do as I say.

1071
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,979
Now get going. I will call you.

1072
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,906
When you meet me in front of
them act as if we go along way back.

1073
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:25,076
Now move. Leave.

1074
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,413
When Sam told you about this
job and you met with that girl..

1075
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:38,212
...how much time passed
between these two meetings?

1076
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,978
Two-four days, sir.

1077
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,538
Two or four?

1078
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,510
Sam gave me the number
and I called the girl next day.

1079
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,104
The girl screamed at me.
She said, "Don't call me again."

1080
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:52,213
And two days later she called herself.

1081
01:05:54,234 --> 01:05:56,737
And.. - Think again.

1082
01:05:57,034 --> 01:05:59,878
No, honestly.
That's how it happened.

1083
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:05,645
Sohail and Sam met before the accident.

1084
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,975
Sohail..met Herra three days later.

1085
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,447
Between these two meetings,
Sam and Rahil had a fight.

1086
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:26,241
Now..in the video Rahil met
with an accident on 6th December.

1087
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,647
And in the same video Sam and Herra..

1088
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,579
“First met on 10th December.

1089
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,307
But..Sohail had already met
Sam one day before the accident.

1090
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:45,038
That means,
four days before he met Herra.

1091
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,006
5th December.

1092
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:51,004
According to Sohail.

1093
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:55,844
...Sam had already planned
the drug deal before the accident.

1094
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:04,366
Did Sam have a dream about
having a fight with Rahil.

1095
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:06,176
...where he will
accidentally lose his life?

1096
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:10,011
You mean Rahil was pad of this plan.

1097
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,273
Otherwise, why would Sam say..

1098
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,377
..."If caught, take Rahil's name?"

1099
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:17,443
Because Rahil is dead.

1100
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,413
And dead men don't tell tales.

1101
01:07:23,234 --> 01:07:25,578
And this Jeevan.

1102
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,312
He's a fraud. A cheat.
Sam's sycophant.

1103
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:30,444
All the dealers scatter
as soon as they see him.

1104
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,776
How long have you known him?
- As long as I've known Sam.

1105
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:34,002
What does he do?

1106
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,111
He says he works
for some film company.

1107
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,779
Every time we meet
he says just one thing.

1108
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,314
"L will make a film." Fraud.

1109
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,006
Did he give you a role in the film?

1110
01:07:44,067 --> 01:07:46,138
I've no connection with acting, sir.

1111
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:47,673
Anyway, on the
pretext of offering a pad...

1112
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:49,212
...he would probably
take stuff on credit.

1113
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,843
And the others?

1114
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,308
The others?

1115
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:57,414
Deepak and the girls.

1116
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,069
Yes. That girl, Herra.

1117
01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:01,214
She's an addict.

1118
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,404
She only did what Sam said.

1119
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:05,008
Herra introduced me to everyone.

1120
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,178
Boss.

1121
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:09,541
He's the solo supply
line in Mumbai for Charlie.

1122
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:13,411
No one can supply Charlie
in Mumbai without his permission.

1123
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:16,038
Kabul, Nepal, even Columbia.

1124
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,607
He has a strong hold
in all these places.

1125
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:24,941
Now, where will you get
this much stuff from? And how?

1126
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:27,035
Seems a bit mysterious to me.

1127
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,211
But then that is your problem.

1128
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:34,315
But once the stuff gets here, I guarantee
you that I will procure a buyer for it.

1129
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,580
Are you just going to stare
at me or offer me some tequila or what?

1130
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,070
Boss.

1131
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:47,941
You were talking about the big boss?

1132
01:08:48,034 --> 01:08:49,445
Quiet.

1133
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,706
Azmat Khan.

1134
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:56,278
So that was the plan.You were
going to rob Azmat Khan...

1135
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,405
...and sell his stuff back to him.

1136
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,838
Azmat boss.

1137
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:01,642
I swear on my mother, sir.

1138
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,666
If you swear by your
mom one more time...

1139
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:05,840
...I'll make sure
she sits right next to you.

1140
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:11,107
Did you know how much
goods they were talking about?

1141
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,643
I didn't know back then.

1142
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,476
Now you know they're
standing at Pali Naka. - Yes.

1143
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:35,946
Go there and transfer both
the bags in their cars. - Yes.

1144
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:39,140
The bags are really heavy.

1145
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:40,804
Is there a chopped up body inside?

1146
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:44,970
I told you think big.
Open it and take a look.

1147
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,938
Take a look.

1148
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,476
Holy shit!

1149
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:57,105
So much. - Here. Test it.

1150
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:06,642
It's A grade stuff, brother.

1151
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,180
So much and bag full.
- Two bags full.

1152
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,373
Where did you get it from?

1153
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:17,178
Those kids got it?

1154
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,111
It's just unbelievable.

1155
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:21,169
That's just what I say.
Why not keep it for ourselves?

1156
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,277
And leave the city.

1157
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:28,805
You do as much
you are told to. Got it?

1158
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,836
Otherwise keep your trap shut!

1159
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,870
Now get down.

1160
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:39,813
Brother, hitting a woman.
- Shut up, you pimp.

1161
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:41,972
Sorry. Sorry. - Now get down.

1162
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,340
And you get down too.

1163
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,472
So how did you dispose of that coke?

1164
01:10:57,701 --> 01:11:01,171
Oh no, sir.
I didn't even see it after that day.

1165
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,175
Day before yesterday
night Sam called me.

1166
01:11:06,534 --> 01:11:07,877
Sam, what are you doing?

1167
01:11:07,934 --> 01:11:10,175
What am I doing?
- You don't even look at me.

1168
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:11,644
I am looking at you now.

1169
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:14,748
Fuck. You are such a bastard!

1170
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,606
Why are you doing this?

1171
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,078
Look, don't trouble me.
I am already quite troubled.

1172
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:23,040
If I slap you,
then you will start crying.

1173
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:26,514
Next time if you come begging to me..

1174
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,644
...l won't listen to you.

1175
01:11:27,734 --> 01:11:29,873
Should I beg you
to fuck off right now?

1176
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:32,445
I won't leave you.

1177
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,944
Don't leave me.
Hold onto me. - I won't leave you.

1178
01:11:35,067 --> 01:11:37,047
Now go away from here.

1179
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,774
Boss, can I come in?

1180
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,177
Come.

1181
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:54,178
Boss, as per your instructions I
told them that the stuff will get sold.

1182
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:57,038
But what is the plan?

1183
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,307
You leave the plan to me.
First, did you get the gun?

1184
01:11:59,534 --> 01:12:00,512
Yes, boss.

1185
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,181
Show me. - German made,
works really smooth.

1186
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:06,971
Like butter.

1187
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:09,741
It's great.

1188
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:13,508
Boss, if you don't mind..

1189
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:16,174
What are you going to do with this gun?

1190
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:23,015
Suddenly there are a
lot of ass wipes in our plan.

1191
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:26,804
We might need to start
with a clean slate.

1192
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:30,244
Get that.

1193
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:32,139
When we received the
call from the control...

1194
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:33,703
...we were close to Hill Road.

1195
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:35,812
We arrived there in five minutes.

1196
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,440
But there was nothing.

1197
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:39,538
Look, we've seen the video footage.

1198
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:40,971
An accident did take place there.

1199
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:43,207
Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am. I am sure.

1200
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:44,641
There was no accident there.

1201
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:47,645
Can you see your video clipping again?

1202
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:56,212
What do we know about
this Deepak Kumar alias Dips?

1203
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,899
Sir, we found a strange clue..

1204
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,277
...when we searched Rahil's house.

1205
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:02,241
What?

1206
01:13:06,534 --> 01:13:08,536
Sir, this is Deepak
Kumar's show-reel...

1207
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,174
...which we found in Rahil's house.

1208
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,311
What do we know about Rahil?

1209
01:13:17,467 --> 01:13:19,743
He arrived three years ago from Kenya.

1210
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:22,508
And he's been spotted
with Azmat Khan's gang as well.

1211
01:13:22,601 --> 01:13:23,944
That's interesting.

1212
01:13:27,034 --> 01:13:28,980
Why don't you lead
the questioning this time?

1213
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:29,907
Of course, sir.

1214
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,137
The case is slightly complicated.

1215
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,505
I will monitor you.

1216
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:34,938
Thank you, sir.

1217
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,605
Tell me about Rahil.

1218
01:14:11,401 --> 01:14:13,972
Can't remember.
The one you work for. Tell me.

1219
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,808
Madam, I told sir everything“
- Sir's on a leave.

1220
01:14:17,134 --> 01:14:19,239
Talk to me. Tell me.

1221
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,399
Madam, I was just lying.

1222
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,744
Sam asked me to take
Rahil's name. So..

1223
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,246
What else did Sam
tell you about him?

1224
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:26,439
That's all.

1225
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,003
That's all - Yes, madam.

1226
01:14:28,134 --> 01:14:29,943
Do you know who murdered Rahil?

1227
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:32,481
Murder? No, madam. I don't
know anything about any murder.

1228
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,806
Look, we've evidence proving.

1229
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:35,438
“That you are involved
in Rahil's murder.

1230
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,406
If you tell the truth,
we can make you a witness.

1231
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:41,711
Otherwise your bosses will
kill you as soon as you step out.

1232
01:14:41,734 --> 01:14:44,408
Where is sir?
Call sir. I told sir everything.

1233
01:14:44,467 --> 01:14:46,003
Madam. - What?

1234
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:47,944
Don't you know what's gong on here?

1235
01:14:48,267 --> 01:14:49,439
Sorry, madam.

1236
01:14:50,534 --> 01:14:52,241
His lawyer is hereto see him.

1237
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:57,247
Tell him he's been
released long ago.

1238
01:14:57,634 --> 01:14:58,374
Okay, madam.

1239
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,046
Madam, this is illegal.

1240
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,443
There's been a murder
and you are pad of it.

1241
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:04,171
Now we will make a new charge-sheet.

1242
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:06,746
302, 120B, 307.

1243
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,946
And a non-bailable
warrant against you.

1244
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:11,475
Now do I tell you
what these sections mean?

1245
01:15:11,601 --> 01:15:14,480
Honestly, madam.
Sam told me.. - What did Sam say?

1246
01:15:14,534 --> 01:15:17,538
Sam said..l just told you.
Sam said, if you're caught.

1247
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:19,376
Not just me.
To everyone. Take Rahil's name.

1248
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,699
But Rahil's been murdered.
Why did he ask you to take his name?

1249
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,873
That's exactly why he said it.
Because he's been murdered.

1250
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,937
So you know he's been murdered.
- Right, madam.

1251
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:28,813
Now We'll make a new charge-sheet.

1252
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,580
Honestly, madam.
I Wasn't there. - Where?

1253
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:34,577
Where the accident took place.

1254
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:35,704
How do you know about the accident?

1255
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:37,077
Sam told me.

1256
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,443
Then why didn't you
tell me this before?

1257
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,713
Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I forgot.

1258
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:42,873
You forgot. - I forgot.

1259
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:45,147
What else did he say?
- Nothing else.

1260
01:15:45,234 --> 01:15:46,474
That's all. - Yes.

1261
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:47,944
Did you ask him about Rahil?

1262
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:50,240
No, Sam said that he
has taken care of Rahil.

1263
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:52,847
That means killed him.
- That's what it means.

1264
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:54,407
Meaning.

1265
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,736
Did Sam say Rahil's dead? - No.

1266
01:15:56,934 --> 01:15:59,107
So you just assumed that
Rahil has been murdered? - Yes.

1267
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,177
And Sam killed him.
- That's what it means.

1268
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,736
What did Sam say
when the body was found?

1269
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:05,244
Whose body? - Rahil's body.

1270
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,404
It was Herra who told me about it.

1271
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:08,845
How do you know what Herra said?
Where you there?

1272
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:10,810
No, no. Sam told me.

1273
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:11,937
But the body Wasn't found.

1274
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,472
Then how did Herra tell
Sam that the body's been found?

1275
01:16:16,867 --> 01:16:18,676
Herra told Sam about
the body because...

1276
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,940
...she did not want him
to move the cocaine.

1277
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,104
That must be, madam.

1278
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:23,076
Then three days later
she asked you to tell Sam..

1279
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,444
“That the consignment
can be delivered.

1280
01:16:25,534 --> 01:16:26,877
Yes, madam. That Herra told me.

1281
01:16:26,934 --> 01:16:29,744
So you deceived Sam. - No, madam.
Like I said Herra told me.

1282
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:32,871
So you made a new plan
with Herra to cheat Sam.

1283
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:34,099
No, madam.
We didn't make any such plan.

1284
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,671
And you went to collect the
consignment, Herra called the police.

1285
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:37,945
That's exactly what
must have happened.

1286
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,671
She is deceiving everyone.

1287
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:42,347
Why? Does Herra work for the police?

1288
01:16:42,834 --> 01:16:44,245
She deceived all of you really bad.

1289
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,480
She got you arrested
and also the consignment.

1290
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,503
But madam,
the consignment was a fake. - Fake!

1291
01:16:49,434 --> 01:16:51,641
You know the consignment
was a fake. - Madam.

1292
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,973
You know the consignment
was a fake. - Madam.

1293
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:55,981
You know the consignment was a fake.

1294
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:57,876
Yes, I knew.

1295
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,111
You know the consignment was a fake.

1296
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:00,906
No, madam.

1297
01:17:00,934 --> 01:17:02,999
Madam what?

1298
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,707
Say it.
Say it. That's enough of you.

1299
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:08,781
Sir, Sam told me that
the consignment was a fake.

1300
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,379
Your lawyer will keep searching
for you and here you will be..

1301
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:14,911
...under the third degree treatment.
Over here.

1302
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:16,771
Sir, I think his mouth will
only open in front of you now.

1303
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:19,274
Sir, I will tell you. But.

1304
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:21,711
Please save me from him.

1305
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:24,704
You're with the police.
No one can harm you.

1306
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:27,243
Who is he? - Rahil.

1307
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:29,075
Who should I save you from? - Rahil.

1308
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:31,803
That psychotic bastard Rahil.

1309
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,447
Knowing him was like
knowing the devil.

1310
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,111
Whenever he entered the room..

1311
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,180
...it felt like some
devil has entered the room.

1312
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:43,907
He's a psycho, sir.

1313
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,606
Completely unpredictable.
He has mad lust for power.

1314
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:49,246
He loves the fact that
people are terrified of him.

1315
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:52,309
No questions. Just do as he says.

1316
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:56,377
Why? Why are people
so afraid of Rahil?

1317
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,304
Madam, there's plenty
treatment for psychosis.

1318
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:04,744
But if such power backs the
psychotic, then only God help us.

1319
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,102
What power? - He's the boss's son.

1320
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:08,803
Hussani's son?

1321
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:11,103
He is the son of Azmat Khan!

1322
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,438
What nonsense!

1323
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:15,910
Sir, Azmat Khan doesn't
have any son by this name.

1324
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,737
He's his illegitimate son.

1325
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,944
Sir, we don't have
any such information.

1326
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,307
So does everyone know?

1327
01:18:23,401 --> 01:18:24,971
So everyone knows this?
That Rahil is son of Azmat Khan.

1328
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,607
No, sir. Very few know about it.
Because he's migrated from Kenya.

1329
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,141
Born and raised there
itself on Azmat Khan's money.

1330
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:34,948
Rahil also doesn't acknowledge Azmat
as his father. They don't get along.

1331
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:37,707
So did Hussani know Rahil's linage?

1332
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,980
Of course, sir. He was his uncle.

1333
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,610
What could he do? That's
why Azmat Khan sent him to Mumbai.

1334
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:46,047
I heard that he created
a big mess back there.

1335
01:18:46,201 --> 01:18:48,704
How was the relationship
between Rahil and Hussani?

1336
01:18:49,001 --> 01:18:53,677
Terrible. Hussani tolerated him only
because of Azmat Khan's sake.

1337
01:18:55,801 --> 01:18:59,078
Did Rahil ever mention the
nature of his relation with Hussani?

1338
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:02,573
Sir, he abuses him the entire day.

1339
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:07,171
He thinks Hussani stands
between Azmat and him.

1340
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,641
Brother, can I talk
to you about something?

1341
01:19:17,134 --> 01:19:17,874
Why?

1342
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:21,274
Did I ask you anything?

1343
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:23,409
Will you understand
only if I shoot you?

1344
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,739
Rahil. My brother. How are you?

1345
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,540
Don't get furious.

1346
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:29,639
Dips.

1347
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:32,603
Sam's friend Deepak. - Yes, madam.

1348
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,381
Yes, madam.
Rahil and Dips are very thick.

1349
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:36,537
Don't you know?

1350
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,204
And Sam? - Sam.

1351
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:42,307
Sam! He's only an
inconsequential wheeler dealer.

1352
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:47,110
The story that I just told you..

1353
01:19:47,401 --> 01:19:49,642
“They told me to
tell that to the police.

1354
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:51,608
Which two? - Rahil and Dips.

1355
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,110
Madam, everything I told
you until now was a lie.

1356
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:55,909
'A girl called Herra will answer.
- You're a big fixer.'

1357
01:19:55,934 --> 01:19:57,311
'My guarantee.'

1358
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,244
'Is there a body in it?
- A lot of cowards are involved.'

1359
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,306
'I've to clean them up.'

1360
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,738
Real plan of Rahil.

1361
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,807
I've a great plan.

1362
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,908
To deceive my rascal father.

1363
01:20:16,867 --> 01:20:18,278
Did you say anything true until now?

1364
01:20:18,534 --> 01:20:20,377
This time I am telling the truth.

1365
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:22,979
Ideal in drugs,
not in telling stories.

1366
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,971
What do you think?
I am enjoying myself.

1367
01:20:26,067 --> 01:20:27,444
Continue.

1368
01:20:28,234 --> 01:20:30,578
Tomorrow I will kill the old man.

1369
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,136
Patience.

1370
01:20:32,267 --> 01:20:34,440
No patience. I want to kill him now.

1371
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:36,611
I am telling you. He'll die himself.

1372
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:38,079
Why are you..forget it.

1373
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,473
Kill whom?

1374
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,606
He didn't mention it then.

1375
01:20:41,867 --> 01:20:45,440
But when I saw the news,
I figured Rahil must have done it.

1376
01:20:46,867 --> 01:20:48,744
Did Rahil kill Hussani?

1377
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:53,645
Yes, sir.

1378
01:20:53,734 --> 01:20:55,975
Who else would dare to
shoot Hussani in this city?

1379
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,913
What are you saying?
How much? - What?

1380
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:02,478
300 millions. - 300 millions.

1381
01:21:02,534 --> 01:21:04,480
I gave him the information.

1382
01:21:15,434 --> 01:21:16,708
Did anyone ask you?

1383
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:21,504
Then why are you blowing
your own trumpet?

1384
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,505
Will you understand
only after I shoot you?

1385
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:30,615
I lost my mind and just blurted out.
- Now I have lost mine.

1386
01:21:30,701 --> 01:21:35,480
Bro, he's a bloody idiot.
Hey asshole say sorry to bro.

1387
01:21:35,734 --> 01:21:36,678
Sorry, brother.

1388
01:21:36,867 --> 01:21:39,177
You seem to have grown
too big for your shoes.

1389
01:21:39,401 --> 01:21:40,744
As you say.

1390
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,802
Just tell us what we need to do.

1391
01:21:42,834 --> 01:21:43,642
Forget him.

1392
01:21:47,534 --> 01:21:49,514
I've a great plan.

1393
01:21:50,134 --> 01:21:52,080
To steal from my illegitimate dad.

1394
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:53,410
Tell us.

1395
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:56,707
You've a director friend,
don't you? - Yes.

1396
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,841
I've some work for him.

1397
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,140
As you say.

1398
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,477
So Jeevan was pad of this plan too.

1399
01:22:04,934 --> 01:22:09,144
Rahil knew that there is a friend of Dips
who obsessively keeps shooting.

1400
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,813
Sir, that means this video
was shot for a special purpose.

1401
01:22:13,234 --> 01:22:18,775
Yes. Because what Rahil needed
was somebody to capture on camera.

1402
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,508
The charade that he was
going to stage for all to see.

1403
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:23,275
Dips.

1404
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:27,813
Herra, Wasn't that too fast?

1405
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,780
Let's go.

1406
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,475
If someone sees us..
- Let's go. Let's go.

1407
01:22:39,534 --> 01:22:41,138
So Herra was driving that car.

1408
01:22:41,334 --> 01:22:42,142
Right, sir.

1409
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,807
And Rahil told her to follow him and then
at an opportune moment hit him.

1410
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:48,176
Right, sir.

1411
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,612
Baby. Baby, are you okay?

1412
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:04,043
Actually,
that's what Rahil is made of.

1413
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:06,336
Otherwise you took a full swing.

1414
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,246
I told you if you lie
again I will beat you.

1415
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:11,875
But I am not lying.

1416
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,207
You aren't telling the truth either.

1417
01:23:13,567 --> 01:23:16,548
Is Rahil made out of steel?
Who makes a plan like that?

1418
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:18,475
It was Dips' idea.

1419
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:20,199
Dips asked him to
jump in front of the can.

1420
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,372
...and Rahil agreed.

1421
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:25,974
No. Dips said that the accident
will be just like in the films.

1422
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:31,073
You know, all the action that you
see in movies that is not for real.

1423
01:23:31,434 --> 01:23:33,072
Come to the point.

1424
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,105
Hey! He brought us here.

1425
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:46,574
Why are you clapping?

1426
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:49,441
Sorry. As you say.

1427
01:23:51,467 --> 01:23:52,533
Here. - Yes.

1428
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,946
Are you sure they'll do it properly?

1429
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:56,273
Yes, sure.

1430
01:23:56,534 --> 01:23:58,070
They have a 100% success rate.

1431
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,970
No actor was ever
hurt on Anna's set.

1432
01:24:01,234 --> 01:24:03,771
See, if my father gets suspicious.

1433
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:06,542
...that all this is a drama,
then he'll send me straight to hell.

1434
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:07,609
What are you saying?

1435
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,978
Did you ever feel in the
films that the accident is fake?

1436
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:14,410
Baby, I am still scared. Let's
think of something else. Please.

1437
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:15,942
Baby's scared.

1438
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,007
My love,
it's this side or that side.

1439
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:21,646
No time to think.

1440
01:24:23,234 --> 01:24:24,838
Here he comes, Rahil.

1441
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:28,869
And why was Herra
involved in this plan?

1442
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,109
Madam, she's Rahil's girlfriend.

1443
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,610
She does exactly
what he tells her to.

1444
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,940
But lately he got insanely
pissed off at her.

1445
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:41,314
You slut, why did I send you there?
For my work or to spread your legs ?

1446
01:24:41,734 --> 01:24:44,681
Dips is lying.
I only did what you asked me to.

1447
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,304
He is lying.

1448
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,168
Now tell me who is lying?

1449
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:56,050
What did I send you there for? To
do the job or to spread your legs?

1450
01:24:57,234 --> 01:25:00,841
Dips is lying. Please believe me.

1451
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,477
You are the one who is lying.

1452
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:19,602
Who are you?

1453
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:21,508
Dips is lying-

1454
01:25:26,634 --> 01:25:27,635
Who are you?

1455
01:25:28,101 --> 01:25:28,909
Who are you?

1456
01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:30,544
I am a slut.

1457
01:25:31,634 --> 01:25:33,113
What did you go there for?

1458
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:35,543
What did you go there for?

1459
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:37,405
To spread my legs.

1460
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:47,939
Give her the dosage.

1461
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:51,114
Yes, brother. - She is a whore.

1462
01:25:51,467 --> 01:25:53,037
As you say, brother.

1463
01:26:09,134 --> 01:26:10,408
Bloody bastard!

1464
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:12,039
So where is she now?

1465
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:14,209
I don't know, madam.

1466
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:17,379
So what was all that? That
transfer from one car to another.

1467
01:26:18,567 --> 01:26:22,174
Sir, Sam thought that
Herra can cheat him.

1468
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,538
So we changed cars.

1469
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:26,246
So that Herra doesn't
know where the consignment is.

1470
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,279
And Sam didn't know..

1471
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:32,174
...that Jeevan is delivering
all the information back.

1472
01:26:32,634 --> 01:26:34,671
Sir, I understand about the rest.

1473
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,577
But Dips would even risk Nina for..

1474
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,647
Madam, Dips got all of
them involved because of her.

1475
01:26:40,901 --> 01:26:44,280
You should've seen my acting.
You would've been shaken.

1476
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,144
I am already shaking.

1477
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,908
They really thought I am scared.

1478
01:26:52,334 --> 01:26:53,836
If I had acted this well in films.

1479
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:55,005
...l would've certainly
got a Filmfare.

1480
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:57,738
We're making this
video to see your acting.

1481
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:02,440
Don't worry.
I'll make a film for you as well.

1482
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:04,274
What are you saying?

1483
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,444
Thank you. Thank you.

1484
01:27:07,634 --> 01:27:08,772
Let's have a beer.

1485
01:27:09,134 --> 01:27:12,138
But whatever you say..

1486
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:14,614
...my girl turned
to be a real slut too.

1487
01:27:15,467 --> 01:27:16,946
Now you have figured it out?

1488
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:19,644
Women should only be
treated like pet animals.

1489
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:24,746
How do you keep a dog collared?
Just like that.

1490
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:29,413
How much ever I love her,
she never stops harping about Sam.

1491
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,436
I am only good enough
to while away her time.

1492
01:27:33,267 --> 01:27:35,747
Bro, I am pretty sure the bitch must be
sleeping with him behind my back.

1493
01:27:36,101 --> 01:27:36,977
I am sure too.

1494
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:41,078
Once our job's done,
then I will take care of her.

1495
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,278
Hey, lover.

1496
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,838
The day we settle scores.

1497
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:49,470
...her score will be settled too.

1498
01:27:50,734 --> 01:27:51,678
Get that?

1499
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:54,576
Get that?

1500
01:27:57,434 --> 01:28:00,415
No ifs and buts.
Everyone has to die.

1501
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,110
They are friends. Right?

1502
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,041
All of them will die together.

1503
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,140
Don't worry.

1504
01:28:10,834 --> 01:28:14,372
You're my brother.

1505
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:16,277
You won't be harmed.

1506
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:18,877
Excuse me, sir.

1507
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:21,278
The vigilance has sent a recording.

1508
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:25,238
The number from which
Jabber called Dips was tapped.

1509
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:30,880
Hello. Deepak Kumar. - Yes.

1510
01:28:30,901 --> 01:28:32,005
Jabber wants to speak to you.

1511
01:28:32,234 --> 01:28:33,269
Hello. Jabber?

1512
01:28:33,701 --> 01:28:34,441
Deepak.

1513
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:36,012
Hello. - How are you?

1514
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,544
I am fine, Jabber. How..hello.

1515
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:39,669
And how is your friend?

1516
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:41,837
Friend?

1517
01:28:42,034 --> 01:28:43,240
I am talking about Rahil.

1518
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,937
Jabber, I don't know
anything about him.

1519
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:48,707
You asshole. Were you not
there with Rahil at the club?

1520
01:28:48,734 --> 01:28:52,409
Jabber, I swear.
I didn't do anything.

1521
01:28:52,467 --> 01:28:54,743
Are you going to tell me or
will I have to force it out of you?

1522
01:28:54,934 --> 01:28:58,074
Jabber, please spare me. l..l..

1523
01:28:58,234 --> 01:28:59,235
Now listen carefully. - Yes.

1524
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,175
Come and meet me.

1525
01:29:01,201 --> 01:29:02,599
And listen. - Jabber, I don't.

1526
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,639
My man will call you with
the place and time. - Hello. Hello.

1527
01:29:06,667 --> 01:29:07,509
Now disconnect the line.
- Jabber, please.

1528
01:29:13,034 --> 01:29:15,981
The last scene of this drama.

1529
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,874
Rahil had to make sure that Jabber
gets to know Sam's whereabouts.

1530
01:29:22,934 --> 01:29:24,004
Any guesses?

1531
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,807
Dips meeting with Jabber.

1532
01:29:38,467 --> 01:29:39,411
Hello.

1533
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,511
No, thank you.
- Try it. It's not that bad.

1534
01:29:45,034 --> 01:29:46,570
No, thank you.

1535
01:29:47,034 --> 01:29:49,036
I really don't know where Rahil is.

1536
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:50,942
I only talked to
him on the phone once.

1537
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:54,507
This feeling of yours.

1538
01:29:55,234 --> 01:29:56,508
This feeling of
yours is what I like.

1539
01:29:57,734 --> 01:29:59,270
You can give your
life for friendship.

1540
01:30:01,067 --> 01:30:03,138
After the Hussani incident.

1541
01:30:03,467 --> 01:30:06,004
...Rahil went underground.
He's..he's scared.

1542
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:09,346
He thinks you will doubt him first.

1543
01:30:09,367 --> 01:30:10,209
I see.

1544
01:30:11,234 --> 01:30:14,215
You tell me..what do you think?

1545
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:17,143
<i>Rahil..</i>

1546
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:21,616
...is bitter. He's mad.
He's always in a fit of rage.

1547
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:25,444
But Hussani was his uncle.

1548
01:30:25,501 --> 01:30:28,038
Right. This feeling of yours.

1549
01:30:28,734 --> 01:30:30,645
This feeling of yours.

1550
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:34,180
Let me tell you.
Rahil knew who is cheating us.

1551
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,479
And..he thinks they
killed Hussani as well.

1552
01:30:37,534 --> 01:30:41,175
They are dangerous people. He
says only you can take care of them.

1553
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:43,600
Who are they? - l..

1554
01:30:43,601 --> 01:30:44,705
Tell me their names.

1555
01:30:44,967 --> 01:30:46,674
Rahil will tell you on the phone.

1556
01:30:49,767 --> 01:30:50,643
Can I leave?

1557
01:30:57,467 --> 01:30:58,810
Sir, what do you think?

1558
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:01,278
What is the truth
in all that he said?

1559
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:06,574
The only truth is what we saw.
Rest everything is a fiction.

1560
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:13,407
When you have eliminated
the impossible.

1561
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:20,009
“Then whatever remains,
however improbable.

1562
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:22,303
...has to be the truth.

1563
01:31:23,134 --> 01:31:24,613
So you still have doubts.

1564
01:31:24,934 --> 01:31:28,643
I do have doubts and
it's important to have doubts.

1565
01:31:29,134 --> 01:31:34,015
We are building up the case file. Post
a bulletin for Rahil, Dips and Herra.

1566
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,273
Spend some official stationery.
Make up your case file.

1567
01:31:37,334 --> 01:31:38,142
Yes, sir.

1568
01:31:38,767 --> 01:31:41,304
I have kept a squad
of two to shadow Sohail.

1569
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:42,705
There must be a plan in place.

1570
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:44,611
How is he going to
meet Rahil once out.

1571
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,102
Khar-Danda? - Yes.

1572
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:04,077
Do you need any help in case diary?

1573
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,941
No, sir. I will manage it. Thanks.

1574
01:32:10,534 --> 01:32:12,241
Don't worry too much.

1575
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:15,505
About the ones who weren't found.

1576
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,540
No one can keep running forever.

1577
01:33:29,934 --> 01:33:32,346
'This seems to be
a never-ending pain.'

1578
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:37,472
'Just keeps on growing inside me.'

1579
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:43,080
'I cannot endure it any longer.'

1580
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:48,140
'This is the only thing left to do.'

1581
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,502
'Perhaps then I can find
salvation from this darkness.'

1582
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:04,342
The fish has taken the bait.
What are you still waiting for?

1583
01:34:05,067 --> 01:34:07,343
By the way, Sohail did
the right thing before dying.

1584
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:09,539
He blabbered a lot.

1585
01:34:09,767 --> 01:34:12,714
I had to handle it.

1586
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,074
'Every story has
an end and a beginning.'

1587
01:34:19,267 --> 01:34:21,338
The story that I just told you..

1588
01:34:21,434 --> 01:34:23,573
“They told me to
tell that to the police.

1589
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:25,012
Who is lying?

1590
01:34:25,334 --> 01:34:27,336
Hey.. say sorry to bro.

1591
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:29,540
You should've seen my acting.
You would've been shaken.

1592
01:34:29,734 --> 01:34:33,181
Did you ever feel in the
films that the accident is fake?

1593
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:37,076
To get in the game,
one needs to play the game.

1594
01:34:39,434 --> 01:34:40,708
Hussani.

1595
01:34:41,767 --> 01:34:44,043
Why do you worry
over such small things?

1596
01:34:44,534 --> 01:34:45,604
I told you.

1597
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,277
Everything's under control here.

1598
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:52,505
The old man's gone crazy.

1599
01:34:53,367 --> 01:34:56,610
How long will you
keep working for Hussani?

1600
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,811
I won't get a big chance.

1601
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:00,536
...till the old man does not die.

1602
01:35:00,734 --> 01:35:02,008
Dying is the easy pad.

1603
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,974
And anyhow,
Hussani's so troubled with Rahil.

1604
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,638
A little more to the right.

1605
01:35:16,467 --> 01:35:19,607
And then when will
this trophy come of use.

1606
01:35:21,134 --> 01:35:24,513
To get in the game,
one needs to play the game.

1607
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,343
Will you do it or not?

1608
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:32,948
I will. I will. I will do as you say.

1609
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:35,477
'Jabber was my drug-buddy.'

1610
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,475
'Rahil didn't like me doing drugs.'

1611
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:42,181
'And it was impossible
for me to live without it.'

1612
01:35:42,734 --> 01:35:45,374
'And this is where their plan began.'

1613
01:35:45,901 --> 01:35:47,642
'When Rahil found out.'

1614
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,446
'..he came looking
for me alone in the club.'

1615
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,911
You took drugs again.

1616
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:54,169
If I didn't love you.

1617
01:35:56,134 --> 01:35:57,772
Then I would've killed you right now.

1618
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,746
Are you locking horns with Sam?

1619
01:36:02,867 --> 01:36:06,246
'When he left,
Sohail was following him.'

1620
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:07,539
Hit him.

1621
01:36:08,501 --> 01:36:09,605
What the.

1622
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:13,575
The spot where Sohail ambushed Rahil...

1623
01:36:14,534 --> 01:36:16,912
...Jeevs was present
there with his friends.

1624
01:36:17,534 --> 01:36:20,481
And that is when their
plan started to change.

1625
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:21,535
He isn't dead yet.

1626
01:36:28,734 --> 01:36:31,112
Three bullets left in it. - Yes.

1627
01:36:34,867 --> 01:36:36,039
They have your name written on them.

1628
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,307
The kids that ran away from here.

1629
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:41,071
Go and find them right now.

1630
01:36:41,201 --> 01:36:42,578
And kill all of them.

1631
01:36:43,067 --> 01:36:45,547
Or else these three will
make their way inside your stomach.

1632
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:48,675
But how will you recognize them?

1633
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,104
I know one of them.

1634
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:52,009
Do you want me to find
you an auspicious time?

1635
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:54,044
Go and kill them.

1636
01:36:54,967 --> 01:36:57,811
'But Jeevs didn't
make it home that night.'

1637
01:36:58,434 --> 01:36:59,845
Do you have any stuff on you?

1638
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:02,613
Emergency quota is there, dude.

1639
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,137
Let's go puff them.

1640
01:37:04,367 --> 01:37:06,244
Otherwise my head will explode.

1641
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:11,274
Who asked you to rush the act?
Surely, the head will explode.

1642
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:14,910
Come on. - Sorry.

1643
01:37:28,101 --> 01:37:28,670
Yes.

1644
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,846
Four hours still left.

1645
01:37:39,767 --> 01:37:41,576
Should we bump him off or not?

1646
01:37:41,734 --> 01:37:43,077
We cannot step back now.

1647
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:46,910
'Plan's first pad was Rahil's death.'

1648
01:37:48,334 --> 01:37:51,076
'And second pad, Hussani's death.'

1649
01:38:07,101 --> 01:38:08,739
Give the phone to boss.

1650
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,814
Hello. - Hello.

1651
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:14,305
Everything fine.

1652
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,641
By God's grace. - Work is done?

1653
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,679
Yes. Work's done with
the blessings of the law.

1654
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:21,375
And how is my son?

1655
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:25,341
Rahil's phone has been
switched off since last night.

1656
01:38:25,967 --> 01:38:28,709
What the hell do I do
with this bastard son of mine?

1657
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,409
Your son..you have
made him what he is.

1658
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:37,312
Yeah. That is the tragedy of it all.
Anyhow. May Allah protect you!

1659
01:38:37,434 --> 01:38:38,708
May Allah protect you!

1660
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:47,803
'Now there was only one problem left.'

1661
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:49,808
'The witness to Rahil's death.'

1662
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:54,507
First we bumped off Rahil...
And then we got rid of Hussani.

1663
01:38:55,134 --> 01:38:55,805
Yeah.

1664
01:38:56,734 --> 01:38:59,840
Then we concocted the story that Rahil
bumped off Hussani and disappeared.

1665
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:06,909
I gave you such a menial job to do.
And you couldn't even do that properly.

1666
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,908
What should I do with you?
What should I do?

1667
01:39:09,034 --> 01:39:12,675
I am telling you, brother. That
guy did not return home last night.

1668
01:39:13,567 --> 01:39:15,376
Yeah? Then why didn't
you kill them there itself?

1669
01:39:15,734 --> 01:39:18,578
They seemed such kids.
Thought they will easily scare off.

1670
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:23,574
You seem to have grown
too big for your shoes.

1671
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,103
Don't press the trigger. Don't do it.

1672
01:39:28,434 --> 01:39:32,507
Who told you to think? Did I? No.

1673
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,642
I will do something.
I will do it. I swear.

1674
01:39:35,801 --> 01:39:38,839
Hey fatty! Hey you!

1675
01:39:39,267 --> 01:39:44,239
'And when Sohail found Jeevs,
it was too late.'

1676
01:39:44,567 --> 01:39:47,377
Bro, I was just about to
come over to you with the money.

1677
01:39:47,434 --> 01:39:51,348
You bloody hipster.
Where will you go with my money?

1678
01:39:51,567 --> 01:39:54,673
Exactly. Where will I go, bro?
How can I run away with your money?

1679
01:39:54,867 --> 01:39:59,338
I saw you last night. You
were partying with some hot chicks.

1680
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:02,341
So..what did you do last night?

1681
01:40:02,634 --> 01:40:05,444
Bro, I tell you.
I shot the most exciting action clip.

1682
01:40:05,601 --> 01:40:10,573
I put it on Youtube.
1000 hits in one day.

1683
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,743
Did I say something Wrong?

1684
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,838
I clearly told that patsy that
I don't want any witnesses alive.

1685
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,279
Now 1000 people have seen.
How Rahil got bumped off!

1686
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:34,207
Azmat Khan is going
to skin all of us alive now.

1687
01:40:35,067 --> 01:40:38,276
How will Azmat Khan react when he finds
out that the recording of this accident..

1688
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,211
Has been created by Rahil himself?

1689
01:40:41,967 --> 01:40:43,537
What? What do you mean?

1690
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:47,875
Say if Rahil has killed Hussani...

1691
01:40:48,267 --> 01:40:50,076
“then he must have made
some kind of fallback plan.

1692
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:52,745
Of how he is going to
escape the wrath of his father.

1693
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:55,237
What are you saying? - Think.

1694
01:40:56,567 --> 01:40:58,979
Rahil creates the
charade of his death.

1695
01:41:00,301 --> 01:41:01,678
Records it.

1696
01:41:02,467 --> 01:41:05,004
And then uploads it on Youtube.

1697
01:41:08,301 --> 01:41:13,046
For a truth to become a lie,
a lie needs to become the truth.

1698
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,980
I showed big brother your video.
- Really, bro?

1699
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,637
The boss said very good himself.
- What are you saying?

1700
01:41:18,834 --> 01:41:21,212
He said you've made a wonderful film.

1701
01:41:21,834 --> 01:41:24,440
You're a true assessor.
You recognized my talent.

1702
01:41:24,467 --> 01:41:26,538
I've shot in many different angles.

1703
01:41:26,601 --> 01:41:28,239
Yes, the boss said that.

1704
01:41:28,468 --> 01:41:29,606
He said so. - I see.

1705
01:41:31,567 --> 01:41:33,638
Now you will make a film for the boss.

1706
01:41:34,067 --> 01:41:35,137
What are you saying?

1707
01:41:35,534 --> 01:41:38,014
Swear on the camera. Please.

1708
01:41:40,167 --> 01:41:41,510
There are conditions. - Yes.

1709
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:44,641
These other youngsters
shouldn't know about it. - No.

1710
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,937
Every shot should look
real like an ad film.

1711
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:49,377
That's exactly what I've thought.
I will make it just like that.

1712
01:41:49,567 --> 01:41:51,137
And this will be our secret.

1713
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:54,273
Yes. It will.
It will remain a secret. Sure.

1714
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,501
Done? - Done.

1715
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:57,874
Swear on the camera. - I do.

1716
01:41:57,934 --> 01:41:59,971
Swear on it. - I swear on Bollywood.

1717
01:42:00,067 --> 01:42:02,047
Top secret.

1718
01:42:03,434 --> 01:42:04,276
Here.

1719
01:42:05,734 --> 01:42:06,769
Signing amount.

1720
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,241
'And that's how a new plan was made.'

1721
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:10,240
Thank you.

1722
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:13,245
'Hi, Sam.'

1723
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:15,404
'You happened to kill my boyfriend.'

1724
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:20,204
'We will get two cores to do this.'

1725
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:23,939
'And what happened
next had to happen.'

1726
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:27,144
What was in the car?
- Will you hit me that hard?

1727
01:42:27,301 --> 01:42:29,406
Of course not. We will pamper you.

1728
01:42:29,567 --> 01:42:31,444
Rascal. You think this is a joke.

1729
01:42:31,634 --> 01:42:33,272
Do you want me to.. - No, no.

1730
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,605
He's tense. Slowly.

1731
01:42:37,101 --> 01:42:38,705
What was in the car?

1732
01:42:39,134 --> 01:42:42,047
If the boss says..Was that right?

1733
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,744
Yes, say the complete line.
What was in the car?

1734
01:42:45,867 --> 01:42:49,041
Will the boss ever tell
us what was in the car?

1735
01:42:49,101 --> 01:42:50,978
Get some more feeling in the eyes.

1736
01:42:51,767 --> 01:42:53,610
I don't know what was in the car?

1737
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,273
Will the boss ever tell
us what was in the car?

1738
01:42:58,401 --> 01:43:00,278
Say it like that. - Yes.

1739
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:02,171
The plan will stay the same. Okay?

1740
01:43:03,067 --> 01:43:04,444
I will handle everything.

1741
01:43:04,634 --> 01:43:06,739
Do you know which
of your phone's tapped?

1742
01:43:06,767 --> 01:43:08,906
Some of my boys' phones
are getting tapped.

1743
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:12,747
Sometimes I've to pass
some information to the police.

1744
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,773
Fine. You think we
don't know anything.

1745
01:43:15,867 --> 01:43:18,780
Listen. Call Dips from
any of the tapped number.

1746
01:43:18,801 --> 01:43:21,805
According to Herra
he works for Azmat Khan.

1747
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:24,040
Sir. Sir,
I really don't know who Rahil is.

1748
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,544
We..we were jusj..Really, sir.

1749
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:29,275
I know that you don't know Rahil.

1750
01:43:30,034 --> 01:43:31,536
But tell me who did
he get in a fight with?

1751
01:43:31,701 --> 01:43:33,510
Jabber won't spare any one of us.

1752
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:34,907
You know what to do.

1753
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,702
Give it back to him!

1754
01:43:38,101 --> 01:43:39,910
Right where it hurts.

1755
01:43:40,034 --> 01:43:43,243
Parking number 30. Grey Santro.

1756
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,946
Go right now or you will lose the car.

1757
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:48,707
Get up.

1758
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,974
Excuse me, mister. - What?

1759
01:43:54,034 --> 01:43:56,014
Someone's calling you inside.
- Just a minute.

1760
01:43:56,134 --> 01:43:57,238
What. - Take a look.

1761
01:43:57,334 --> 01:43:59,780
What? Leave me. Leave me.

1762
01:43:59,834 --> 01:44:02,110
Who do you think called the cops?

1763
01:44:02,401 --> 01:44:03,175
Guys.

1764
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,206
I saw your acting.

1765
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:11,079
You did the right thing.
Got yourself arrested.

1766
01:44:12,201 --> 01:44:14,374
Okay, sir.
- The plan is still the same.

1767
01:44:16,267 --> 01:44:17,678
Do you remember everything?

1768
01:44:19,801 --> 01:44:22,077
Don't worry. I will be right there.

1769
01:44:23,301 --> 01:44:26,407
Sir, I will give my best shot.

1770
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:29,571
We've to act everyday
in our line of business.

1771
01:44:30,634 --> 01:44:31,977
Now..

1772
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,110
After Hussani's death.

1773
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,641
“Everything is your responsibility.

1774
01:44:40,667 --> 01:44:42,078
What to do?

1775
01:44:42,667 --> 01:44:44,738
You cannot refuse Azmat Khan.

1776
01:44:47,467 --> 01:44:49,674
What about her?
Did you think of anything?

1777
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:53,111
She takes a lot of drugs.

1778
01:44:54,334 --> 01:44:56,678
She won't live for
more than a week or two.

1779
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,076
You've fallen so deep in love
that there's no hope for you now.

1780
01:45:05,834 --> 01:45:07,313
Those are different people.

1781
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:11,843
I am not one of those who
lay down their lives for beauty.

1782
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:14,674
The case file's been prepared.

1783
01:45:15,334 --> 01:45:17,940
Call Dubai and give
my regards to the boss.

1784
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:19,937
Azmat Khan's wondering..

1785
01:45:20,734 --> 01:45:22,680
“Whether he should grieve
over his son's death“

1786
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,410
...or rejoice that he's finally
rid of his illegitimate son.

1787
01:45:27,967 --> 01:45:30,846
Tell him no point
in digging on his wounds.

1788
01:45:32,134 --> 01:45:34,774
It will heal with time.

1789
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:39,575
I really enjoyed working with you.

1790
01:45:49,734 --> 01:45:51,839
Try to understand.

1791
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:56,404
I understand.

1792
01:46:11,834 --> 01:46:15,941
There is just one way to get out.

1793
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:18,245
...of this love triangle
of Rahil and Jabber.

1794
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,141
Do as I say.

1795
01:46:25,634 --> 01:46:27,511
No need to worry.

1796
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,708
I won't let anything happen to you.

1797
01:46:41,534 --> 01:46:45,880
'Jabber never really got it..Man
who had created this web of deceit.

1798
01:46:46,367 --> 01:46:49,314
...had always understood
what was there in his head.'

1799
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,173
'So it had to be..'

1800
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:58,444
'When you have eliminated
the impossible.'

1801
01:46:58,667 --> 01:47:04,174
'..then whatever remains,
however improbable.'

1802
01:47:04,567 --> 01:47:06,103
'..has to be the truth.'
