Breaking news! 
Sameera Mahaa gets arrested!

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Sameera Mahaa, wife of Rahul Mahaa, who is 
in the top 100 on the recent Forbes list

10
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,210
and the owner of Mahaa Constructions 
and Mahaa Steels has been arrested!

11
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,580
She has been arrested 
in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu

12
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,370
for the murder of Punjagutta DSP 
Ashok Krishna of Hyderabad circle.

13
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,690
Sameera was here for Ayurvedic treatment 
and stayed in Valley View resort.

14
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,360
We were told that she was raped by 
DSP Ashok Krishna in the resort.

15
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,690
It is reported that she shot 
him with a gun as self-defense.

16
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,540
Ashok Krishna's body is 
taken for postmortem.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,020
What is the connection between 
Mahaa Constructions, Ashok and Sameera?

18
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,980
There is no official statement 
from the Mahaa family so far.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,630
We are expecting to hear from 
Sameera's lawyer soon.

20
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,690
-Take that off.

What was a cop from 
Hyderabad doing in your room?

27
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,270
How well did you know him?

28
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,580
Clean her up.

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,170
Send this to the lab.

30
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,380
Is this sample enough?

31
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,850
Previously, it was Abhaya and 
Nasifa and today, it is Sameera!

32
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,190
The names keep changing 
but the situation is the same.

33
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,000
How can we trust the police who has to 
protect us, when they break the law?

34
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,820
This being a high profile case,

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,760
the police are being 
meticulous in gathering evidence.

36
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,240
We've been hearing that DSP 
Ashok is very alcoholic.

37
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,650
Tell me, Sir. 
What do you know about Ashok?

38
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,190
Ashok sir used to attend office 
intoxicated since last year.

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,710
The whole department was aware of that.

40
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,120
Reporter: We are in front of 
Sameera's house right now.

41
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,800
There is news that she 
would arrive here shortly.

42
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,050
The court has granted bail 
to Sameera as expected.

43
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,170
[overlap of voices] The court gave 10 days 
time to the police to file chargesheet.

Banerjee, let's move.

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,590

53
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,040
You know what happened to me.

00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,920
And only I know how it happened.

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,480
It has caused immense pain 
and damage to me and my family.

56
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,170
I would like to thank the media

57
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,770
-for being understanding... 
-Tell us what actually happened, madam.

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,050
I am sure you have a lot of questions...

59
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,620
But today I would like 
to ask you something.

60
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,030
They've filed the police case by stating 
the rapist policeman as the victim

61
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,790
and me as the culprit for killing him.

62
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,710
Who is right and who is wrong?

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,460
Is it right to rape a woman?

64
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,180
Is it wrong to kill the rapist?

65
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,910
Whatever the court's verdict be, 
I know I did the right thing.

66
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,950
The scars on my body may disappear.

67
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,070
But I will always 
remember what I went through.

68
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,800
It's a reminder that...

69
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,610
I can fight.

70
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,640
No woman can express what she underwent.

71
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,130
And no family can accept it.

72
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,940
I am the voice for each one of 
those girls and their families.

73
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,010
Because...

74
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,740
I am with you.

75
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,240
I am you.

[camera clicks]

77
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,470
Sameera's case reflects yet again,

78
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,470
the atrocities happening 
on women in our nation.

79
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,200
Sameera's speech is trending 
at number one on social media.

80
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,430
Women welfare associations 
are demanding justice for her.

81
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,140
Sir, a moment please.

82
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,320
Any chance of the case being mishandled 
since it involves a police official?

83
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,140
Please! The FIR is registered 
with a charge of murder.

84
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,820
You are talking about a rape.

85
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,520
We have appointed our best 
officer to investigate this case.

86
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,530
Best officer?

87
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,210
The DIG has put us in a tough spot.

88
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,970
If the case is messed up, 
the media will destroy us.

89
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,030

your shelf by looking at your workout, sir

No need for sarcasm, Reddy.

93
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,970
This is a sensitive case. 
We have deal it very sensibly.

94
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,730
Okay, sir.

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,410
Where is Vikram?

96
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,070
Thanks, Ayyappa.

97
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,000
Sir, did you get any information?

98
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,990
I'm looking for some answers...

99
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,790
But there is a more of 
commas and question marks.

100
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,680
Okay, sir. I'll wait outside.

103
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,150
Hello!

104
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,110
Sam!

105
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,100
Are you leaving?

106
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,780
No.

107
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,310
-I am staying. 
-Why?

108
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,730
-How can I leave you alone? 
-I want to be alone.

109
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,400
-But Sam... 
-Rahul! Please!

110
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,520
You know why.

111
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,340
Okay.

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,010
Hello, Bhanu! I'm on my way.

113
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,440
No. She said she wants to stay alone.

114
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,110
[phone rings]

115
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,290
Tell me, Mr Banerjee.

116
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,650
Sameera! Watch the news.

117
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,560
Hmm...

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,470
According to the latest 
information on Sameera's rape case

119
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,020
the prosecution has appointed famed 
criminal lawyer Ratnakar Chetty.

120
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,130
In South India, Ratnakar has never lost 
a single case for the past twenty years

121
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,150
and there is no lawyer 
who has defeated him.

122
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,100
No one will be spared until we 
bring justice to Ashok and his family.

123
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,950
-I will settle all scores. 
-Are you submitting the evidence?

124
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,170
Who is this Ratnakar?

125
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,770
He is a tough lawyer, Sameera.

126
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,230
He can tamper the evidence, threaten,

127
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,980
change a lie and make a truth 
out of nothing just to win.

128
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,470
But don't you need proof 
to win a case, Mr Banerjee?

129
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,930
And we've submitted everything 
including Ashok's DNA to his semen,

130
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,860
It's clearly an open and shut case.

131
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,810
You're right, Sameera! But it is a 
'police officer' that was killed.

132
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,960
The media is brutally targeting 
the police department for TRPs.

133
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,750
Hence, they can create evidence or 
make it disappear with help of Ratnakar.

134
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,340
So? Should we be scared?

135
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,330
We should be careful.

136
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,080
There is an SI named 
Vikram Vasudev in Coonoor.

137
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,700
I've talked with him to get 
us the inside information.

138
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,760
But he is also a policeman, right?

139
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
He will do anything for money.

140
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,380
I asked him to meet you today.

141
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,770
I have already 
transferred 25 lakhs to his account.

142
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,650
So, it's a win-win situation for both.

143
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,280
-What if he changes his word?-He will be at risk.

144
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,220
We can file a police case 
accusing him of taking a bribe.

145
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,430
-But to meet him without you? 
-I spoke to our people at the court...

146
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,070
Ratnakar is submitting 
evidence by 10 am tomorrow.

147
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,020
So please understand. 
This is very urgent.

148
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,640
But if you could...

149
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,040
You know how important the work 
which I attending right now, Sameera.

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,900
-Please keep me posted. 
-Okay.

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,900
[doorbell dings]

152
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,870

[beeps]

154
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,880
Who is it?

155
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,730
Speak to Banerjee.

156
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,400
Sir!

157
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,680
Did you receive the money?

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,710
It's all spent.

159
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,680
But that was only the advance, right?

160
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,220
There will be more...

161
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,950
Why sir? Where are you?

162
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,080
I am going out on some important work...

163
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,230
We'll meet later.

164
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,300
Come back soon.

165
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,800
We have to save her, right?

166
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,290
Give the phone to her.

167
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,380
-I'll keep you posted. 
-Okay.

168
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm sorry. I just quit smoking.

169
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,970
If you don't mind...

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,660
And also, it's a no-smoking room.

171
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,490
Battery!

172
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,950
I don't like to ever hear a 'no'.

173
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,960
I feel restricted.

174
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,380
The situation should always 
be under our control, right?

175
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,450
Is it okay to break the law for that?

176
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,680
Why worry about the law? It will run 
its own course and we should run ours.

177
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,970
We live in a nation where the 
innocent parents were framed

178
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,730
for their daughter's 
murder in the Talwars's case.

179
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,150
Then, what is my value or yours?

180
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,750
[TV playing smoking

181
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,380
That spoilt the mood...

182
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,820
Look at this... a small symbol.

183
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,750
It shows how a small mistake 
can change our lives.

184
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,170
Yes.

185
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,410
All it takes is one bad decision.

186
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,370
Is that experience speaking?

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,240
Hmm. 
[chuckles]

188
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,390
Thanks, madam.

189
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,610
What information are the 
police going to give Ratnakar?

190
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,570
I will tell you.

191
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,180
Nirbheek revolver.

192
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,550
32 caliber

193
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,890
6 shots

194
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,570
15 meters range

195
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,570
A single shot might have suggested 
that it was done out of fear.

196
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,780
But the second shot suggests...

197
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,280
looks like vengeance.

198
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,780
It wouldn't be wrong to kill 
Ashok a 100 times for what he did.

199

[gunshots]

213
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,560
Shall we have some coffee?

214
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,040
No matter what, coffee from a 
machine doesn't taste good.

215
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,010
Banerjee said you would give 
me some inside information.

216
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,020
Well... Just asking...

217
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,530
Does coffee change the 
color of milk or vice versa?

218
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,600
I had that doubt since childhood.

219
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,400
Well... This case...

220
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,360
[scoffs] I mean the 
coffee should be tasty.

221
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,040
I am very particular about it.

222
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,880
That's not what I asked.

223
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,360
Do you see that file?

224
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,140
Whatever I write in that,

225
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,900
-it will decide your future.  
-Future?

226
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,940
I thought it will be decided in the court.

227
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,840
Whatever you submit to the 
court, it is just an information.

228
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,140
When I submit it, it becomes proof.

229
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,530
Have the coffee... It would turn cold.

230
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,110
It's very simple matter, madam.

231
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,180
Ratnakar will instigate a 
regional feeling to the police.

232
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,070
Moreover, the police are trying to 
save their reputation in your case. So...

233
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,870
The police will dance to 
the tunes of Ratnakar.

234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,480
But... they can't change the truth, right?

235
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,450
They will change the 
perspective of the truth.

236
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,840
I have followed your case 
very thoroughly, madam.

237
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,810
But one thing is bothering me.

238
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,560
You worked as a mere receptionist 
in a company for five years...

239
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,690
And you married the company's 
owner all of a sudden?

240
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,990
Are you here to give 
information or interrogate me?

241
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,140
I am here to make money.

242
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,650
Madam, I am very clear.

243
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,860
I want you to be clear 
and tell me the truth.

244
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,180
It's beneficial for both of us.

245
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,050
The truth is, I married 
Rahul because I loved him.

246
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,500
But... Did Rahul really love you?

247
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,700
What do you mean?

248
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,100
Actually...

249
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,650
You have a murder case against 
you. But you are saying it's a rape.

250
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,420
Rahul didn't make a single public 
statement in your support so far...

251
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,900
He doesn't need to show 
his support to the world.

252
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,740
The amount of 25 lakh rupees 
given to you wasn't Banerjee's.

253
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:24,940
[chuckles]

254
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,600
Why're you laughing?

255
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,660
Rahul doesn't need to 
show his support in public...

256
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,110
But he should show it to you, right?

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,810
Look at these.

258
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,060
These are pictures from events 
you've both attended in the past year.

259
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,950
If any of these pictures had both of you 
holding hands or whispering in one's ears,

260
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,980
we can think that he has 
immense love for you.

261
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,620
Your observational theory about 
holding hands and kissing each other is

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,210
ridiculous!

263
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,000
[scoffs]

264
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,890
The truth is... 
I like to keep my life private.

265
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,310
Is your husband a very 
private person like you?

266
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,600
Doesn't this look odd?

267
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,620
It looks like a bachelor party.

268
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,850
Probably he was too drunk 
to know what he was doing.

269
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,170
I thought the same.

270
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,360
Until I researched further,

271
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,560
and traced this picture to a dating site 
during Rahul's college days in London.

272
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,520
That dating site was not for men 
seeking women and vice-versa.

273
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,870
It's only for men.

274
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,800
Does that mean...

275
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,250
Rahul is a gay?

276
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,710
Shut up! 
You are crossing your limits.

277
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,790
How is Rahul connected to this case?

278
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,330
Madam,

279
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,690
if I could get this 
information just being an SI,

280
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,600
Ratnakar can get it very easily.

281
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,330
And whatever evidence he gets, he will use 
this as a weapon to break you in court.

282
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,560
He'll say your marriage 
was one of convenience.

283
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,700
Stop it! That's not it.

284
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,070
There is a lot of money in 
this marriage but no love.

285
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,080
-You married Rahul for money. 
-Shut up! You...

286
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,520
Rahul could give you 
status but not pleasure.

287
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,850
-You had an affair for your needs... 
-Enough!

288
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,230
Even if it was an affair, 
when a girl says no, it's a no.

289
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,490
-And this was a 'no'! 
-Yes!

290
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,630
I'm here to help you and my slight 
provocation stating Rahul being a gay...

291
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,230
...and your affair made you 
fumble words such as affair, no etc.

292
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,650
And Ratnakar is not going to 
highlight your 'no' but the 'affair'.

293
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,310
He will tarnish your character 
and easily win the case.

294
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,020
I did yelled like this 
to make you understand.

295
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,160
Madam...

296
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,340
Shall we talk about the truth now?

297
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,830
-Are you married, Vikram? 
-No.

298
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,040
Do you have a girlfriend?

299
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,740
I know a girl named Reshma 
whom I her through Whatsapp.

300
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,990
The funny thing about 
a relationships are...

301
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,070
they run on expectations and reality.

302
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,930
Expectations lead to disappointment.

303
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,040
And the reality leaves you in pain.

304
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,210
First, my dad left me 
disappointed when he died.

305
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,810
I was left with pain as I couldn't 
save my mother out of helplessness.

306
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,270
But after I met Rahul,

307
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,540
it felt different.

308
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,390
Hmm

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,370
Thank you, sir.

310
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,920
Look at the census. 
Don't you guys get it?

311
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,900
When you don't know how to do 
it, just leave your job and go.

312
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,420
Sir!

313
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,180
Good job.

314
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,410
Congratulations, Sameera.

315
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,280
I never realized when our professional 
relationship transformed

316
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,410
into a personal one.

317
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,320
Rahul, Dhanunjay Constructions are 
getting aggressive with their bidding.

318
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,260
Keep that aside.

319
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,600
Rahul, it's really important.

320
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:35,960
It can wait.

321
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,380
Sam!

322
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,390
Do you like me?

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,450
You have given me enough 
comfort to call you by your name...

324
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,450
Why wouldn't I like you?

325
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,150
Then, marry me.

326
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,030
Don't be surprised.

327
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,210
You were able to understand me 
well in such a short period of time.

328
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,850
I made this proposal out of confidence 
that you will accept me for who I am.

329
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,030
How could you lose your mother 
due to lack of money, Sam?

330
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,920
Marry me.

331
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,590
You will have status...

332
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,390
You will have money, 
prestige, basically a good life.

333
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,340
People generally express 
their love when they propose.

334
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,890
Why are you talking about 
status and reputation?

335
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,630
Because I cannot love you...

336
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,460
Affection... Yes. Caring... Yes.

337
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,400
But between us...

338
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,520
He found necessity in my love.

339
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,560
I found honesty in his proposal.

340
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,560
I married him with the hope that I could 
make him fall in love with me someday

341
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,370
Want to know how our honeymoon went?

342
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,860
This is beautiful, Rahul. Thank you.

343
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,990
That's your room.

344
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,540
Rahul is a businessman...

345
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,380
He spent his life marketing.

346
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,300
First, he told you what 
you'd like to hear.

347
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,130
-Then, he told you what you needed to know 
-Vikram!

348
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,190
I don't want to involve Rahul 
or his orientation in this case.

349
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,670
I see!

350
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,660
No wonder Rahul isn't here...

351
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
But it's difficult, madam.

352
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,500
The moment you enter a police station, 
they'll note down all your family details.

353
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,870
The moment you killed Ashok, Rahul 
automatically got involved in the case.

354
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
Ratnakar will definitely talk 
about your marriage in the court.

355
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,650
Don't become emotional and 
confess that Rahul is a gay.

356
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,410
We will be screwed.

357
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,850
But that's the truth!

358
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,830
Probably.

359
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,470
But you didn't divorce Rahul 
inspite knowing he was gay.

360
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,760
So Ratnakar will definitely stress that 
you married Rahul only for his money.

361
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,780
No one will sympathize with you.

362
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
So?

363
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,370
Sometimes, a question 
answers another question.

364
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,580
I didn't understand.

365
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,670
Madam...

366
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,840
Ratnakar did not become 
a lawyer overnight...

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,460
His wife is the daughter 
of a judicial judge.

368
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,640
Not sure whether he 
loved her or trapped her,

369
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,960
but his life transformed 
after the wedding.

370
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,990
Exactly!

371
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,180
That's what you should ask!

372
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,740
I thought Banerjee would have 
coached you by now...

373
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,300
Tsk! Very bad!

374
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
What could be more 
important than this case?

375
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,860
He's been to case-related work.

376
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,330
[aeroplane whizzes]

377
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,660
[notification tone]

378
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,270
We wanted to be discreet. 
But someone has found out!

379
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,220
What! But how?

380
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,190
I have no idea.

381
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,330
But I got a message 'Welcome to Coonoor'.

382
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,060
-Be careful. 
-Okay.

383
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,740
How are things with Vikram?

384
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,650
He is giving me tips to win over Ratnakar.

385
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,100
He seems to be good at what he does.

386
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,910
Okay, I will call you once I reach.

387
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,080
French fries with fish for 
her and double roti for me.

388
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,130
Make it fast.

389
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,440
How do you know about my preferences?

390
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,330
Investigation doesn't 
mean asking for information.

391
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,710
It's about gathering information.

392
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,230
What else did you find out?

393
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,580
Ashok.

394
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,790
Ashok?

395
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,710
I mean...

396
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,640
how long have you known Ashok?

397
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,220
Rahul introduced me to him.

398
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,550
He was the police security in 
charge for our company events.

399
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,480
He was on Rahul's payroll.

400
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,250
Why do you sanctify 
corruption with such fancy words?

401
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,370
Call it a bribe.

402
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,270
So, have you known Ashok 
for about two years?

403
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,660
Hmm.

404
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,190
Look at this, madam.

405
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,250
This is hotel surveillance 
footage on the day of Ashok's death.

406
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,810
He arrived but didn't wait.

407
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,450
He walked in without knocking the door.

408
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,530
The door was open as if 
you were expecting him.

409
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,420
I forgot to lock the door.

410
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,120
The same is mentioned in the FIR.

411
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,850
I just need the information that 
you know, which isn't in the FIR.

412
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,150
Ashok entered at 1.25 pm.

413
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,550
You've killed him exactly 
after one and half hour.

414
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,380
What happened during that time?

415
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,560
Were you raped so many times?

416
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,540
Or for so long?

417
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,630
Vikram! Mind your language!

418
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,430
[scoffs]

419
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,970
Your anger won't be valued 
as much as the proof in the court.

420
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,030
Proof?

421
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,090
What proof?

422
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,790
2010, Gitam College...

423
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,990
Annual Day Function.

424
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,570
This is you.

425
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,450
And this...

426
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,230
So what?

427
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,720
A lot of people attend college events...

428
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,620
Just because we posed together for a 
photo didn't mean we knew each other.

429
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,610
That's not the point, madam.

430
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,940
You denied knowing Ashok when I asked you.

431
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,560
Ratnakar will corner you with 
this same matter in the court

432
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,770
and calls it an illegal affair.

433
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,800
Because... When there was no 
affair, there is no need to lie...

434
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,970
And if a lie is proved, there is 
no need to reinforce the truth.

435
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,300
If you make conclusive statements...

436
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,210
what's the value of my feelings, then?

437
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,700
Of course, there is value.

438
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,980
If you tell me the truth...

439
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,520
I will help you escape 
from this situation...

440
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,690
And then, ask you how much I want.

441
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,830
[thunder rumbles] 
Good.

442
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,470
I married Rahul and was with him.

443
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,450
But I felt very empty. 
During that time...

444
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,120
Ashok...

445
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,530
Sam...

446
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,490
Hi...

447
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,790
I remembered all our good 
times from the past at once.

448
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,370
I don't know how to explain it... 
But Ashok was nice to me.

449
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,310
I connected to him emotionally.

450
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,130
In my 'nothing' life,

451
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,990
Ashok became something.

452
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,050
A friend...

453
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,500
A friend who never asked any questions.

454
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,610
A friend whom I could trust.

455
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,190
When I told him about my Coonoor 
trip, he offered to come along.

456
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,850
I never asked him why.

457
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,010
I left the door open for him that day.

458
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,860
I considered him as a good friend...

459
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,120
I understood later that 
he didn't think like me

460
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,210
Slowly he started dropping some hints.

461
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,940
What are you doing? Ashok!

462
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,690
Please, leave!

463
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,030
[locks bolt]

464
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,700
[mumbles]

465
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,100
[glass shatters] Ten 
years of friendship...

466
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,760
...and he was ready to give 
it all away just for sex.

467
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,770
I tried to fight back. I screamed...

468
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,820
But he was like an animal.

469
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,710
You asked for the truth, right?

470
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,890
This is the truth.

471
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,200
Does anyone else know about 
your friendship with Ashok?

472
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,290
Only Rahul, Mr Banerjee

473
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,060
and now you.

474
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,970
The soft copy of that 
college picture is at home.

475
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,960
I will delete it by morning.

476
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,370
Don't worry.

477
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,290
I will not disclose your 
college matters to anyone.

478
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,400
[chuckles]

479
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,170
Please don't share this with anyone.

480
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,700
All we need to think about now

481
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,380
is to figure out what Ashok 
did before you were raped.

482
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,950
We can.

483
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,910
Let's do it.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,380
FIR suggests a blow to the head.

485
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,560
You lost consciousness upon the blow.

486
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,020
We can get it medically certified...

487
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,850
By the time you gained 
consciousness he was on top of you.

488
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Will Ratnakar believe it?

489
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,050
To tell a lie, you need to hide the truth.

490
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,140
But to tell the truth, 
all you need is courage.

491
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,070
Of course, sometimes you have to 
resort to a lie for the sake of truth.

492
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,740
It's inevitable! [chuckles]

493
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,710
And it is not wrong too!

494
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,870
First you believe it, madam.

495
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,690
Then we will convince Ratnakar.

496
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,050
One more thing!

497
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,650
I gave you two ideas till now.

498
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,390
20 lakh rupees for each idea 
and it amounts to 40 lakhs.

499
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,780
-What? 
-Don't evade my payment at last moment.

500
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,930
Moreover, Mr Banerjee isn't here.

501
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,420
[door unlocks]

502
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,900
[notification tone]

503
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,890
Madam, your phone.

504
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,040
SECURITY IS VERY TIGHT HERE.

505
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,790
NO MATTER WHAT, 
THE JOB HAS TO BE DONE.

506
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,100
IT'S VERY HARD.

507
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,340
PLEASE, I AM COUNTING ON YOU.

508
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,710
Madam, why are you silent?

509
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,380
Er... Nothing.

510
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,720
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said?

511
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,750
When you want to be in 
control of a situation...

512
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,490
You should always trust a man who 
works for money rather than for love.

513
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,260
Er... It wasn't Gandhi... 
I came up with it.

514
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
[sighs]

515
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,910
Water?

516
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,490
Ok, come to the point.

517
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,200
Vikram!

518
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,010
How do you get 
something out of a locked room?

519
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,700
[smiles] It can be done. What's my cut?

520
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,680
Tell me your quote.

521
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,140
I didn't mean three 
crores. It's thirty lakhs.

522
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,360
Since you asked in particular... I'm 
quoting as per demand and supply theory.

523
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,740
Coonoor economics!

524
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,610
Okay.

525
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,950
That means there's 
something important in that room.

526
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,080
Idea, please.

527
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,760
The fire alarm will go 
off on lighting a cigarette.

528
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,750
Won't it go off with a lighter as well?

529
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,680
Damn, the timing of 
the dialogue is missed.

530
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,600
Once the alarm goes off,

531
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,930
everyone will rush 
out and we can enter.

532
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:23,820
Simple!

533
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,150
Let me know if you need anything else.

534
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,070
I'll give you a discount.

535
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,810
[phone rings]

536
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,870
Hello

537
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,650
Huh?

538
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,790
Tsk!

539
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,260
Which case?

540
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,530
One year back...

541
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,180
Missing case... from one year ago?

542
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

543
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,580
Okay.

544
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,300
Okay. I will call you. Bye.

545
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,310
Sorry, madam. Where were we?

546
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,700
Er... What is the missing case?

547
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,570
That is some other case...

548
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,750
Let's get back to our case.

549
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,570
You said one year back. What is it?

550
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,400
[sighs]

551
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,140
I've meddled with some 
guy's life unexpectedly.

552
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,320
Now that case has become a burden.

553
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,820
Who is it?

554
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,050
[sneezes] Why are these 
rains incessant, Sri Reddy?

555
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,160
Just call me Reddy, sir.

556
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,750
By the way... 
Why don't you visit Reshma for a massage?

557
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,420
All your pains would vanish at once.

558
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,760
No way. Her husband installed 
CCTV cameras at their house.

559
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,880
All those videos will become 
viral if we get caught.

560
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,750
The public is already upset 
with the police.

561
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,330
I bought some special ginger tea for you.

562
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,990
Hasn't your school reopened yet?

563
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,820
No.

564
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,400
Does he have to study 
now to be a collector?

565
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,760
Maybe not, but I won't 
end up as a constable.

566
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,820
Huh!

567
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,430
[coughs]

568
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,270
-Go look! 
-Hey!

569
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,130
Help him, lift him up!

570
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,550
Take a look at those papers.

571
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,230
That was the first time I saw him.

572
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,090
He looked very weak.

573
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,360
But there was determination in his eyes.

574
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,050
Those eyes are scary!

575
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,810
He didn't stop with that first visit.

576
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,980
He kept coming to the station.

577
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,850
Why isn't anyone taking responsibility?

578
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,970
Why are you not concerned? 
My father is missing.

579
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,710
-Do something. Please help me out, sir.-I'm checking, right? Wait for sometime.

580
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,840
-How can it be like this, sir?-Hey!

581
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,700
This is a Police Station.

582
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,850
Why are you shouting?

583
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,470
Sir...

584
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,450
It's been three days since 
my father had gone missing.

585
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,820
Nobody seems to care, sir.

586
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,020
Please help me, sir.

587
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,210
Please, sir.

588
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,410
-What is the name? 
-Professor Vinay Varma, retired.

589
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,990
Uhuh... What is your name?

590
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,730
Adarsh.

591
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,200
Adarsh!

592
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,270
Look, Adarsh. 
Coonoor has four police stations.

593
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,320
There are 400 pending cases and 25 plus 
missing cases.

594
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,610
We're responsible for all of them.

595
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,200
Investigations will take time. 
How can you call it lack of concern?

596
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,080
Have you lodged a complaint?

597
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,380
We have also filed an FIR, sir.

598
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,750
They've made a note, right?

599
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,830
We will verify and call you back. 
You can go.

600
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,390
The thing is that, sir...

601
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,430
Get going!

602
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,770
Why is he wearing a 
mask like Batman, Reddy?

603
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,140
Heard that he's got cancer, sir.

604
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,190
-Cancer? 
-Yes.

605
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,810
I hope it's not contagious.

606
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,120
-Someone get me soap immediately.-Okay, sir.

607
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,570
I'm already in recovery state.

608
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,730
Sir, the man inside has come 
to an agreement. Can I send him?

609
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,320
I wish everyone was like him!

610
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,370
What will they gain by 
creating a scene like Adarsh?

611
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,770
Except irritation and tension?

612
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,040
I told him the same, sir.

613
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,080
Don't waste your time here. 
Instead take care of your resort.

614
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,380
-Resort? 
-They own quite a big one.

615
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,290
Then what are we waiting for? Get the 
boy's file. We shall handle Suresh, sir.

616
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,810
Are you interested in the 
case or the resort, sir?

617
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,130
Do you want information or the share?

618
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,630
Sir!

619
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,470
Sir... Adarsh is here.

620
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,040
Is this your resort?

621
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,170
Yes, sir.

622
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,940
Are there any property issues?

623
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,040
Sir?

624
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,790
Umm...

625
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,010
Generally, some people 
run away out of pressure

626
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,550
and some commit suicide as they 
couldn't handle these property issues.

627
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,650
My father has no reason to run away.

628
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,220
Nor is he a coward to kill himself, sir.

629
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:25,970
Here, take the folder.

630
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,930
The reason that I'm still alive 
is because of his motivation, sir.

631
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,190
Then someone must have killed him.

632
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,320
No. That's not what I meant...

633
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,310
Just a doubt.

634
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,130
I am a policeman, right?

635
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,570
Look Adarsh...

636
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,870
There are 2 ways things 
happen around here.

637
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,680
One, through the superior's orders.

638
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,250
Two, through bribing the subordinates.

639
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,800
To get orders from above, 
it may take a week or a month or a year.

640
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,590
Moreover, there is no 
guarantee that the job will be done.

641
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,450
I'm fine with both ways...

642
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,750
How about you?

643
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,680
-How much will it cost, sir? 
-Ten.

644
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,880
Not in thousands.

645
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,100
Well said, Reddy!

646
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,890
[scoffs]

647
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,010
Cash or cheque?

648
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,850
[scoffs]

649
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,500
If it is possible, make it in cash.

650
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,840
If not, a cheque shall suffice.

651
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,920
There could be tax problem!

652
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,170
-Is it a crime to borrow, Reddy? 
-In that case, there is no issue.

653
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,190
I will have cash arranged, sir.

654
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,460
Give me the file.

655
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,360
Here, Sir.

656
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,310
Vinay Varma!

657
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,210
Sir!

658
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,230
That day, all of us went to the Collector 
to discuss about the temple issue, sir.

659
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,940
After that?

660
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,750
-Sorry, Sir. 
-Hmm. Then?

661
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,780
[gate creaks]

662
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,820
When I returned in the 
evening, I saw the car at home.

663
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,850
I thought the master had returned 
home. So, I went to my room.

664
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,410
-When did all this happen? 
-No idea, sir.

665
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,230
He is keeping secrets, sir!

666
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,190
Let's go.

667
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,920
Here is Dad's phone.

668
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,560
His phone is upstairs... 
His car is downstairs...

669
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,730
But the man is missing.

670
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,450
Okay. Type the password and give it to me.

671
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,130
I don't know, sir.

672
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,720
This is another secret, Reddy.

673
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,400
-Give it to Shahid and get it unlocked. 
-Okay, sir.

674
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,440
Where were you that day, madam?

675
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,030
After his chemo session in Coimbatore...

676
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,760
Chemo?

677
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,450
Chemotherapy is a treatment.

678
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,780
Uhuh...

679
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,960
We've started at 5.30 PM.

680
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,390
I was driving a bit 
slow because of the rain.

681
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,410
We gave a lift to a girl on the way.

682
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,300
I think her name was Vaishnavi.

683
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,630
Vaishnavi?

684
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,720
Who is she?

685
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,550
Er... no idea, sir.

686
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,710
It was raining that night. 
The girl was alone... So mom...

687
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,630
Why would you do such social service?

688
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,790
Don't you know highways 
are not safe at night?

689
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,860
-Why would you give a lift to a stranger? 
-Correct, sir.

690
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,800
Actually,

691
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,200
the girl didn't seem like that, sir.

692
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,910
She requested us to 
drop her at The Hotel Taj.

693
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,360
She had come till there and 
went away without intimating us.

694
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,060
-She left without intimation?-Yes, sir.

695
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,340
She said she got lost while trekking.

696
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,960
Who treks here, Reddy?

697
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,210
Mariamma temple is in a restricted area.

698
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,300
-But he says they picked her up here. 
-Yes, sir. We picked her up here.

699
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,750
Hey girl, where are you 
going alone at this time?

700
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,560
What happened?

701
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,550
She must have been a thief, sir.

702
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,050
This area is well known for robberies.

703
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,200
You are right.

704
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,680
Last night Reshma also knocked 
off some cash from my pocket.

705
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,270
[phone rings]

706
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,340
Sir

707
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,670
It's Vinay Varma's call, sir.

708
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,670
Hello

709
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,730
Sir, we are calling from 
Balaji Co-operative Bank.

710
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,360
Your loan of sixty lakhs has been cleared.

711
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,070
You can come and collect 
the clearance certificate.

712
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,710
Thank you.

713
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,040
-Reddy! Get me the call details. 
-Sir... Ok, sir.

714
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,300
Adarsh, get in the car.

715
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:16,960
What about me?

716
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,660
Take a jog, Reddy.

717
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,530
Sir...

718
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,330
60 lakhs?

719
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,960
Though, there is another 
year of loan period,

720
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,260
he pre-closed it citing it to be urgent.

721
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,790
Did he pay 60 lakhs in one go?

722
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,140
He paid 11 lakhs from his account, sir.

723
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,910
The other 49 lakhs was paid by Chirantan.

724
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,240
Chirantan?

725
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,830
[dials]

726
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,950
-Reddy!-Sir

727
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,970
You have four things to do.

728
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,210
First, trace out who Chirantan is. 
It is a Singapore based account.

729
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,440
Hello! We are calling from Coonoor.

730
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
Track Vinay Varma's phone signals

731
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,530
and collect CCTV footage 
from the locations.

732
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,680
I want details of Vinay Varma's 
car wherever it was spotted.

733
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,290
Send Vinay Varma's photograph to every 
police station in our area.

734
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,270
Put up missing posters 
all over the city.

735
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,910
"Whatever happens, he won't stop..."

736
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,590
Greetings, sir. The phone is unlocked

737
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,750
"No matter whoever is before 
him, he won't spare them"

738
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,380
-"Whatever happens, he won't stop..." 
-Adarsh...

739
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,240
"No matter whoever is before 
him, he won't spare them"

740
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,380
Why did you bring me here, sir?

741
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,780
Take a look at this picture.

742
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,660
This is the last picture 
on your dad's phone.

743
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,100
It was shot here.

744
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,110
He might have been in a hurry.

745
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,850
Or something must have happened 
while he was taking it.

746
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
What could have actually happened, sir?

747
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,290
That too at this point...

748
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,640
I don't understand anything, sir.

749
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,900
-What are you doing? 
-[coughs]

750
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,060
You could have been killed!

751
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,970
You missed by a fraction!

752
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,480
Don't you watch out...

753
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,280
First major clue.

754
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,500
I tried calling Chirantan, sir.

755
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,510
No one answered.

756
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,410
I even tried calling the 
Singapore mobile network.

757
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,570
It sounded like they were 
cursing in their language, sir.

758
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,340
Singapore language?

759
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,190
Yes, sir.

760
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,970
[phone rings]

761
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,740
Tea.

762
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,370
[gibberish] Don't call up!

763
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,450
Damn!

764
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,230
Get lost!

765
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,730
Sir, I tried speaking in 
Singapore language with my creditors...

766
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,010
It's already been a week 
since they've lent me money.

767
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,320
I'm trying to manage.

768
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,170
It's good that they 
have waited for a week.

769
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,990
Some people start calling 
within an hour of giving money...

770
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
They start calling within 
an hour of giving...

771
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,230
Look at this, Reddy.

772
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,040
The deposit was made at 2pm on July 
23 and there was a call at 2.30 pm.

773
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,960
There was a deposit at 11am on July 
27th and there was a call at 11.30 am.

774
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,310
Same... Same.

775
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,080
The call was from the 
same number every time.

776
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,090
This number is 040. Second major clue.

777
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,350
[tyres screech]

778
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,840
I asked Adarsh to come to the station 
and he said he was not well.

779
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,530
How is he feeling now?

780
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,670
[coughs]

781
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,570
It's alright, sir. I am ok.

782
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,440
We could not contact Chirantan till now

783
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,230
Each time money was deposited... 
A call came from the same number.

784
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,480
From which place, sir?

785
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,940
From Hyderabad.

786
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,840
Panjagutta Police Station.

787
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,800
Police station?

788
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,010
We don't know who it was...

789
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,810
We are getting the account details 
to find out who this Chirantan is.

790
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,770
Here, Vinay is missing...

791
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,790
There is Chirantan from Singapore and 
Hyderabad's Panjagutta Police Station...

792
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,170
What is the connection?

793
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,620
Before I established a connection,

794
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,090
What is the status of Vinay Varma's 
missing case?

795
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,760
Investigation is going on, sir.

796
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,150
Hand over the file and all the evidence.

797
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,020
I will take care of it. 
You handle the cricket betting case.

798
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,500
-Sir, actually Adarsh... 
-How much did you take?

799
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,300
Hmm?

800
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,930
How much did you take?

801
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,530
I gave it up.

802
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,960
I don't know if it was the money 
or the pressure...

803
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,560
I didn't pursue the case.

804
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,390
I let down Adarsh.

805
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,900
Adarsh did not even know if 
his father was dead or alive.

806
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,700
On one hand, his father was 
missing, he has cancer... [phone rings]

807
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,750
and a mother to look after.

808
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,920
[phone rings]

809
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,490
Dialer tone: The number you've 
called is not answering.

810
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,470
When someone like 
that asked me for help...

811
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,670
I let him down.

812
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,080
I ignored Adarsh.

813
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,010
[phone rings]

814
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,140
Dialer tone:The number you've called is busy.

815
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,810
Did you see him?

816
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,500
Hello...

817
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,750
Yeah, I'm coming.

818
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,430
Sir... Sir...

819
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,530
[coughs] 
Sir...

00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,710
[doorbell dings]

821
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,150
Why are you here?

822
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:03,640
Why didn't you tell me initially 
that money will not fix my problem

823
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,530
if you got orders from above, sir?

824
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,160
-Look, Adarsh! I... 
-My father always told me...

825
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,250
"It's you who should find 
solutions for your problems."

826
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,820
It was my mistake to depend on you.

827
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,280
Suresh is dealing with your case.

828
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,320
Mr Suresh is dealing with your case.

829
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,010
Dealing?

830
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,200
How much was the deal, sir?

831
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,480
I thought the police would do 
their job after taking a bribe...

832
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,840
I never expected them to cheat, sir.

833
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,770
See, Adarsh! 
You are unnecessarily over reacting.

834
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,650
Your dad's case...

835
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,700
It's not my dad's case, 
sir. He is my father!

836
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,860
Here's the balance amount, sir.

837
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,910
There is no more connection 
between you and me.

838
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,650
Deal closed!

839
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,930
[stammers] That's not the case, Adarsh...

840
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,360
I can't leave a job 
half done like you, sir.

841
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,770
That's why I am paying you 
the entire amount and leaving.

842
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,520
Reddy! Get the traffic signal 
CCTV footage. Fast!

843
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,800
Sir, if Suresh finds out...

844
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,630
Sorry, sir.

845
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,740
Phone signals show that Vinay Varma 
was at a lot of places that day.

846
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,400
Not all the areas...

847
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,420
I just need the route 
from Kotagiri to Vannarpet.

848
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,630
Why are you very 
particular about that area, sir?

849
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,090
This is Kotagiri and this is Vannarpet.

850
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,430
This is 19/20 hairpin bend 
where the accident took place.

851
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,020
Every vehicle has to pass through 
this toll gate.

852
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,500
I want the details of every black car 
that passed through this toll gate.

853
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,600
Urgent!

854
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,610
Keep going.

855
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,930
Not this one.

856
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,470
No.

857
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,230
Next

858
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,100
Next...

859
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,340
This one!

860
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,120
How do you know it's this one, sir?

861
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,390
There is no side mirror.

Who rented this car?

A lot of people rent our cars. 
How can I tell you who rented it?

July, 30th.

Let me check.

872
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,010
I offered a lift to a girl on the way...

873
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,350
I think her name was Vaishnavi.

874
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,300
Do you have Vaishnavi's address?

00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,260
We caught a thief in Coonoor a week ago.

879
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,200
We found this bag on him.

880
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,880
When we interrogated him, he said he 
stole it from a car rental company.

881
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,610
When we enquired with the company,

882
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,730
they said the car was 
booked in your name.

883
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,800
So, I came to return the bag.

884
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,440
Coonoor? Where is that?

885
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,830
We've never been there!

886
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,870
The details given by the 
thief matched yours. So...

887
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:51,790
That can't be right...

888
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,230
Maybe, my husband often goes 
out of station on cases.

889
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,280
He might've booked it.

890
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,050
Cases?

891
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,210
Don't you know you have come to a 
policeman's house, being a police officer?

892
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,370
My husband...

893
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,130
DSP Ashok Krishna.

894
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,680
DSP Ashok Krishna?

895
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,520
Every time there was a call 
from the same number.

896
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,170
Where from, sir?

897
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,540
Panjagutta Police Station.

898
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,530
Hmm. Yeah.

899
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,510
-Where is he now? 
-Nectar Gardens.

900
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,980
He's in charge of the security 
for the Maha Constructions' event.

901
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,040
[phone rings]

902
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,650
Hello!

903
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,940
I ordered you to leave the case but you 
still went ahead and reached Hyderabad?

904
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,800
-Sir! It's not that, sir. 
-Don't act smart!

905
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,410
Vinay Varma's son has 
been roaming around

906
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,000
the Punjagutta police station, adamant to 
meet DSP Ashok Krishna, since two days.

907
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,460
Sir, Adarsh is not in Hyderabad.

908
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,200
-He's in Coimbatore for treatment. 
-What are you saying? Vikram...

909
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,230
Do you take me for a fool?

910
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,490
If he meddles further,

911
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,950
he'll get a bullet in his head.

912
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:59,450
My father always told me,"It's you who 
should find solutions for your problems."

913
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,930
I couldn't leave the job 
half done like you, sir.

914
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,080
Nectar Gardens. 
He is the head of the police security...

915
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,670
He'll get a bullet in his head.

916
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,360
Take me to Nectar Gardens.

917
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,470
[indistinct announcement]

918
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,450
Hey, wait. Where are you rushing?

919
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,290
Sir, I have to meet the DSP.

920
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,400
Hey, what is it?

921
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:29,730
Sir... I have to meet DSP Ashok, Sir.

922
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,230
I will leave in two minutes, sir.

923
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,200
Hey, what is your problem?

924
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,600
-I want to meet Mr Ashok. 
-Why did you come even here?

925
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,010
-Send him out! 
-Sir, please hear me out.

926
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:37,610
-Ganesh, take him away, first. 
-Sir, it's not that... Sir...

927
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,980
Let go of me. Leave me! Please....

928
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,640
What's with this heavy traffic? 
Is there another route?

929
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,240
No, sir.

930
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,220
Hello.

931
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,040
Sir... That boy from Coonoor is here.

932
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,280
He is making a scene over here. 
Shall I take him to the station?

933
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,140
No! It will be a problem.

934
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,500
Bring him in.

935
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,580
Okay, sir.

936
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,200
Hey, let him go.

937
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,450
Hey! Come over here. Come...

938
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,130
Get my gun.

939
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,580
Don't stop! The signal 
is green. Keep driving.

940
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,250
-How much longer? 
-Ten minutes.

941
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,570
[honks] 
Damn!

942
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,570
Hey, stay here. Sir will meet you.

943
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,270
What is it?

944
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,490
Sir...

945
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,900
I am Adarsh, Sir.

946
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,450
I came from Coonoor.

947
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,420
Coonoor? But that place doesn't 
come under my jurisdiction!

948
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,810
My father is missing.

949
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,000
We are not able to trace him.

950
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,110
As soon as Chirantan deposited money, he 
got a call from Panjagutta police station.

951
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,440
I mean... That call was from you, sir.

952
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,180
I know nothing.

953
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,920
But, Sir... My father...

954
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,660
Damn it! I told you I know nothing!

955
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,570
Get out of here.

956
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,620
You know about that.

957
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,120
I am not leaving until you tell me.

958
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,540
-Sir, tell me. 
-Hey!

959
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,050
I don't know who Vinay Varma is. Get lost!

960
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:32,590
Vinay Varma...

961
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,680
I never told you my father's name, sir.

962
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,990
You know about my father for sure.

963
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,010
You talk too much!

964
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,410
I will kill you right here. Go!

965
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,860
If you know my father's name...

966
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,510
Then, you should be definitely 
knowing about his whereabouts.

967
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,560
Tell me, Sir.

968
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,570
I've been roaming around like a 
madman since three weeks, sir.

969
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,630
-[gun whirrs] 
-Please! He is my father. Tell me, sir.

970
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:10,640
[pants]

971
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,480
Okay, sir.

972
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,610
Let go of me...

973
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,600
[mumbles]

974
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,430
Shh!

975
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,030
[coughs] Why didn't you 
let me talk to Ashok?

976
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,500
He will kill you.

977
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,340
Let's go.

978
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,670
Try to understand, Adarsh.

979
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,340
There is a lot of pressure from above.

980
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,800
If there is pressure... 
It means they did something wrong, right?

981
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,080
[coughs]

982
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,350
Adarsh, trust me one last time.

983
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,180
-[coughs] 
-Adarsh... Adarsh...

984
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,600
Careful... Careful...

985
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,750
Faster... Faster...

986
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,980
Careful... Careful...

987
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:29,080
[indistinct people cheering]

988
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,100
Don't miss the kid. 
Boss wants him very badly.

989
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,460
Check everywhere.

990
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,660
[indistinct announcement]

991
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,540
Adarsh, we would be seen by them.

992
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,290
If they spot us...

993
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,060
-I met Vaishnavi just a while ago! 
-That's Vaishnavi, sir.

994
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,600
Announcement: I would like to 
introduce to you all... to my wife...

995
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,650
[applause]

996
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,840
Vaishnavi, who was on 
the stage on that day...

997
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,440
The day when Vinay Varma went 
missing, Ashok and you were in Coonoor.

998
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,740
Because of pressure from above,

999
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,570
that case was pushed aside.

1000
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,860
When we thought that 
case couldn't be solved,

1001
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,170
you've ended up killing 
Ashok at Vinay Varma's resort.

1002
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,090
I was in Taj Spa that day. 
You can check the records if you like.

1003
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,730
[scoffs] I always prefer to 
be in control of the situation.

1004
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,670
Don't you think I would come prepared?

1005
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,970
Your missing phone.

1006
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,370
Your finger prints are all over it.

1007
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,330
But it has the blood of Vinay Varma.

1008
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,990
Isn't that why you were 
curious about the missing case?

1009
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,710
Madam!

1010
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,450
What actually happened?

1011
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:55,060
Smoking and drinking 
is injurious to health.

1012
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,560
Sometimes, so is silence. 
[sighs]

1013
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,430
I'm not sure if you don't want to talk 
about it or have nothing to say,

1014
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,240
but in Vinay Varma's missing case,

1015
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,500
FIR has been filed on you and 
Ashok that they suspect you.

1016
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,260
Ratnakar will find 
out by tomorrow morning.

1017
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,550
Think about it for once.

1018
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,130
Imagine the judge in front of you and 
Ratnakar by the right-side holding the FIR

1019
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,460
Then you'll have to speak up.

1020
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,100
Vikram.

1021
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:26,870
I love your hair color.

1022
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,300
You got it done for Vaishnavi as well.

1023
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,090
[scoffs]

1024
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,630
I saw it on her Instagram page.

1025
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:34,870
Hey...

1026
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,050
Is that necessary to you?

1027
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,490
First, tell me what's the surprise is?

1028
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:41,900
Wait for it...

1029
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:43,980
We are on the way, right? 
Why are you worrying?

1030
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,830
[phone ringing]

1031
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,010
Sorry.

1032
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,240
Hello, Rahul!

1033
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,220
No. I will call you once I reach.

1034
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,130
If Vaishnavi calls you now, 
should I react the same way?

1035
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,560
I am getting married in ten 
days. I can't avoid him like that.

1036
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,480
Hey!

1037
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,380
Why are you getting married? Huh?

1038
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,420
Then? Do you expect me to be 
your secret affair forever?

1039
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,400
[sighs] 
Ashok...

1040
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,440
I've understood you, 
when you got married to Vaishnavi.

1041
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,400
That's different and this is different.

1042
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,240
You mean, the rules are 
different for you and me, hmm?

1043
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,470
God damn it, Sam! God damn it!

1044
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,200
Ok.

1045
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
Rahul's topic is over. 
Are you happy now?

1046
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:31,770
Please, Ashok.

1047
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,670
Right now, we are together.

1048
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,210
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

1049
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:36,900
Ashok! Why are you doing this?

1050
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,690

1052
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,340
Sam! Are you ok?

1053
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,260
Hey, are you blind?

1054
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,510
Who even gave you a license?

1055
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,720
-Huh? 
-What nonsense I say!

1056
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,090
Is this the way you drive a car?

1057
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,190
What if something went seriously wrong?

1058
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,920
You barged into my 
lane, rammed into my car...

1059
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,940
Hey, you bumped into my car 
and you are talking too much! Huh?

1060
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,380
Is there any sense in what you are saying?

1061
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,370
Because I am sensible, 
I haven't beaten you up.

1062
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,800
Pay for the damages and leave oldie!

1063
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,520
Ashok! Let's go, please!

1064
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,750
-Is this how you speak to elders? 
-Hey, what manners? Huh?

1065
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,700
-Huh! 
-Ashok!

1066
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,340
You are drunk and driving the car!

1067
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,640
-Do you know it is a punishable offence? 
-Ashok.

1068
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,190
-I will take you to... 
-Are you teaching me law?

1069
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:27,520
Why are you teaching me law?

1070
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,720
-Ashok, let's go! 
-You won't listen to me like this.

1071
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,210
Just a moment. 
[camera capture]

1072
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,620
-Ashok! 
-Why are taking pictures?

1073
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,970
Do you know who I am? Police!

1074
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,060
-Leave him Ashok! 
-Take a picture now! Come on, do it!

1075
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:38,850
Hey!

1076
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:45,540
[panting]

1077
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,330
Sam!

1078
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,310
I am sorry.

1079
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,200
Sam! Sam!

1080
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:55,320
I am sorry.

1081
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,360
Are you happy now?

1082
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,390
Have you vented all your anger? Hmm?

1083
00:58:58,810 --> 00:58:59,930
I couldn't control it, Sam.

1084
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:00,910
It is because of this anger...

1085
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:03,930
Sam, please. I love you.

1086
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:11,900
I am sorry, Sam.

1087
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,630
[car engine starts]

1088
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,000
Has your anger reduced?

1089
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,020
No. 
[birds chirping]

1090
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:50,930
Madam, madam.

1091
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,570
That has just been painted. 
I was worried it might stain you.

1092
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:54,540
Oh! Thank you.

1093
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,260
-How are you, sir? 
-Hmm.

1094
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,380
Is this Vaishnavi madam?

1095
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,620
[birds chirping]

1096
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,660
Yes.

1097
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,230
I knew you were coming...

1098
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,900
But, there's a small issue in the village.

1099
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,090
I need to go there. 
[door opens]

1100
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:14,590
What issue?

1101
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,020
The Government is proposing to displace 
Mariamma temple for road widening.

1102
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,610
The villagers are resisting and 
we have stalled the work.

1103
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,300
We need to meet the village head.

1104
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,110
Ok, you go.

1105
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,890
If I need something, I will call you.

1106
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,960
-I'll be back, sir. 
-Hmm...

1107
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,150
Sam!

1108
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:37,190
Sam!

1109
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,530
Sam! Where are you?

1110
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:42,780
You want to play?

1111
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,340
What will I get for finding you?

1112
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,270
Sam!

1113
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:47,850
Where are you?

1114
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,850
You've found me a long time ago...

1115
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,290
What are you still looking for?

1116
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,630
I've searched all the rooms... 
Where is the surprise?

1117
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:08,650
You have to wait.

1118
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,920
Ok, then you will have to wait as well.

1119
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,260
-"Even if I've watched many stories" 
-You decide.

1120
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,830
-"Different dreams are growing up" 
-Will you tell me or not?

1121
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,850
-"Are covered with the mask of reality" 
-You decide.

1122
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,420
-"Our forms which awoke from sleep" 
-You know my dream, right?

1123
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,570
That I want to settle 
down in a cool place happily.

1124
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,980
I've found a resort here.

1125
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:41,280
They are into some financial 
problems and are ready to sell it.

1126
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,700
I liked it as soon as I saw the pictures.

1127
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:47,470
Let us make it into a huge guest house...

1128
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:50,280
Only for us. Only for you and me.

1129
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,370
You have planned quiet well.

1130
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,990
"There is some different 
story within you and me"

1131
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:08,260
"which hided inside me, right?"

1132
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,110
"How it would be if anyone sees it?"

1133
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,980
"My mind goes crazy 
for you and chases you"

[doorbell rings]

1135
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:29,560
Who is it?

1136
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,020
My car met with an accident. 
I will tell you the details later.

1137
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,760
Hey, why are you here?

1138
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,080
I am here to meet Chirantan.

1139
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,000
Are you Vinay Varma?

1140
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:51,570
Is Chirantan here?

1141
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:54,450
Chirantan is my friend.

1142
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:55,950
I am Ashok.

1143
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,640
I am the one buying your property.

1144
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,090
Hello!

1145
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:03,680
I am not selling you my property.

1146
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:04,870
What?

1147
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,620
My property! My wish!

1148
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,570
I think I have the right to 
decide whom to sell it to?

1149
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,140
I will not sell it to you. That's final.

1150
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,430
Hey! 
Is this about the accident in the morning?

1151
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,390
You want me to apologize?

1152
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,970
-Come inside and we'll discuss it. 
-And I forgot one more thing.

1153
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,090
By tomorrow your advance will be returned.

1154
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,140
-Thank you. 
-Hey!

1155
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,270
Why are you crossing your limits?

1156
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,670
Bloody! I will kill you here right now.

1157
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,670
-Please mind your language. 
-Hey! Hell with the language!

1158
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,230
That's my property and 
I want it. That's all.

1159
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,290
-What nonsense? 
-Ashok!

1160
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,390
-What is wrong with you? 
-Sam! Make this old guy understand.

1161
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,300
-I'll kill him here itself. 
-Ok, I will speak to him.

1162
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,910
You go inside first. Please!

1163
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,820
Go!

1164
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,570
Uncle! I am really sorry for everything.

1165
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,010
I know what he is in the morning...

1166
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,540
Uncle, please leave it.

1167
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,250
I was driving the car 
and it was my mistake.

1168
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,600
I am really sorry.

1169
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,650
Actually, we heard you 
were in need of money...

1170
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,220
We liked the property.

1171
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,190
We have paid you the advance, right... 
take the balance also...

1172
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,430
-Include your car damages as well. 
-Just a moment.

1173
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,700
Unfortunately, money cannot buy respect.

1174
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:06,770
You probably have no idea.

1175
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,450
Uncle!

1176
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,080
Uncle, please!

1177
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,770
I'm asking you to stick 
to your deal ethically.

1178
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,790
You will have your respect.

1179
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,540
You speak a lot!

1180
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,580
Especially about ethics and respect. Huh?

1181
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,810
Don't talk about it. 
It doesn't sound right.

1182
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,590
You may don't know me. 
But I know you quite well.

1183
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,340
-What do you mean? 
-I will show what I mean.

1184
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,710
Rahul's dad was my college mate.

1185
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,910
I don't know what he is to you,

1186
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,280
but if Rahul and his 
family finds out about this...

1187
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,170
It won't be good.

1188
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,590
It's not too late.

1189
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,070
Change your ways before they come to know.

1190
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:51,700
Otherwise, 
I will be forced to tell that...

What did you do? Are you crazy?

1194
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,290
He was threatening you, Sam!

1195
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,980
-He was threatening you. 
-So what?

1196
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:20,250
Ashok!

1197
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:23,820
He is alive, Ashok.

1198
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:24,830
He is moving.

1199
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,680
We can save him.

1200
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:28,740
Ashok!

1201
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,600
Let's do something.

1202
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:31,670
Ashok!

1203
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,660
Ashok, help!

1204
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:47,980

-Ashok! 
-Sam!

I am here.

1212

Help me Sam!

01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,740
I am here. We have to do...

1226
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,660
Thank God, he is alive.

1227
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,930
We have to call an ambulance.

1228
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,680
-Hey! 
-Ashok!

1229
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,130
-What the hell, Ashok? 
-Are you crazy?

1230
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,400
If we take him to the 
hospital, we will end up in jail.

1231
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,400
No, Ashok. 
Let us report it as an accident.

1232
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,420
Let us first save him. 
We don't have much time.

1233
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,680
Hey, if he survives 
will he tell the same thing?

1234
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,220
We have to save him, Ashok! 
Ashok!

1235
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,790
[panting in pain]

1236
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,090
Shit!

1237
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,100
Ashok! 
[groans]

1238
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:28,880
[panting]

1239
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:29,700
Sam!

1240
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,720
Sam, Sam! Listen to me!

1241
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:42,810
Listen to me!

1242
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,360
-Listen to me carefully, Sam. 
-What did you do Ashok?

1243
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,280
Sam, go up, pick up the car 
and wait on the other side of the road.

1244
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,530
I will come. I will come.

1245
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,150
You go.

1246
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,630
Go! You go, Sam.

1247
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:54,280
Go, Sam!

1248
01:08:54,680 --> 01:09:00,600
[sobbing] 
Go Sam!

1249
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:13,080
[vehicle arriving] 
Wait here I'll be back.

1250
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:15,980
Grandpa!

1251
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,110
Grandpa!

1252
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:51,520
[panting] 
Shit!

1253
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:15,600
Shit!

1254
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:23,720
[thunders rumbling]

1255
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,880
[gasps] 
[thunders rumbling]

1256
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,900
I understood what fear was 
for the first time in my life.

1257
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,160
I didn't know how I got out of there.

1258
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,710
What happened? 
Where are you going?

1259
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,490
-That is... I was going for trekking... 
-Oh, Telugu?

1260
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:13,990
Come, first get in the car.

1261
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,310
How come you are 
trekking so late in the night?

1262
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:23,580
All my friends left in the morning...

1263
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,740
I was supposed to 
meet them halfway...

1264
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,560
But my phone switched off...

1265
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,530
So, I lost my way and I 
didn't know where to go...

1266
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,580
[coughing] 
Yeah, this forest is dangerous.

1267
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,100
Sorry, I didn't introduce you.

1268
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,500
He is my son, Adarsh.

1269
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,640
Oh!

1270
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,700
I didn't ask your name...

1271
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,590
Vaishnavi.

1272
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,200
Where shall I drop you?

1273
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,290
Taj Hotel.

1274
01:11:56,990 --> 01:12:00,030
Is Taj Hotel located in Lakshminagar, 
right son?

1275
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,250
-Yeah, but in this rain the road... 
-Hmm, right.

1276
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,250
Those roads clogs during rains...

1277
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,530
Let's do one thing.

1278
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,350
Come home with us.

1279
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,790
Once the rain stops, 
I will drop you at the hotel.

1280
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,570
Actually, 
I don't mind taking a rickshaw or a cab.

1281
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:22,620
[chuckles] 
You don't get cabs here.

1282
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,750
Even if you find a cab... 
this same problem, right?

1283
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:29,180
Ask your friends to pick 
you up after the rain stops.

1284
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,050
Can I make a call?

1285
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:32,830
Sure.

1286
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,540
Thank you.

1287
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,910
Hello, Ashok!

1288
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:41,980
It's me.

1289
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,350
It's me. 
I got lost. Can you pick me up?

1290
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,680
Where should he come to pick me up?

1291
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,410
Umm... Rajendranagar, House Number...

1292
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,110
-Mom... 
-Yes?

1293
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,190
We can share the location.

1294
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,540
Hello, I will share the location.

1295
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,430
Please come fast. 
[coughs]

1296
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:02,490
You will find the location 
in my husband's message.

1297
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,360
Please share it.

1298
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,900
What's his name?

1299
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,430
Vinay.

1300
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:10,290
Vinay Varma.

1301
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,900
[thunders rumbling]

1302
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
Did you send it, dear?

1303
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:23,160
[coughs] 
I think the rain has stopped.

1304
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,460
Hey son, call up your dad.

1305
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,170
His phone is switched off, mom.

1306
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,130
Switched off?

1307
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,480
[coughing] 
Adarsh, are you ok?

1308
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,100
Just two more minutes, 
son. We've almost reached.

1309
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:46,480
[coughing]

1310
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,500
Adarsh, get down slowly. 
You come inside.

1311
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:56,210
Careful. 
Bear it.

1312
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:25,550
[phone ringing continously]

1313
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:03,940
Vaishnavi!

1314
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,950
Vaishnavi. 
Where are you?

1315
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:10,920
Vaishnavi!

1316
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,950
Why are you out in the cold? 
Why don't you come inside?

1317
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,280
-Some phone was ringing here. 
-Phone?

1318
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,350
He keeps forgetting it.

1319
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:37,210
-He's become old. Come inside, dear. 
-Mother... Mother...

1320
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,180
Adarsh... 
Come in.

1321
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:49,160
[coughing] 
Adarsh!

1322
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:50,420
Have you taken your medicine?

1323
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:53,670
Excuse me.

1324
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,550
One phone call.

1325
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,360
[coin clunks]

1326
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:00,530
Ashok.

1327
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:07,650
Ashok! We have to go back.

1328
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:08,740
I dropped my phone.

1329
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,100
Lodge a complaint about your phone 
in the police station...

1330
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,770
Call up the phone network 
and get the SIM blocked.

1331
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:14,890
I will take care of the rest.

1332
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:20,140
What did you do with his body?

1333
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,440
Forget about it.

1334
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,290
You don't know who Vinay Varma is.

1335
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,880
We never came to Coonoor.

1336
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,940
-But Ashok- 
-Hey!

1337
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,280
I told you! Just forget it.

1338
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,600
After that, I was busy with my wedding, 
guests, and events.

1339
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,340
You asked me, right?

1340
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,290
That why I was not looking happy 
in the photographs.

1341
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:50,680
I tried telling Rahul several times...

1342
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,910
But I couldn't do it.

1343
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,510
That incident kept flashing in my mind.

1344
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:05,180
Ashok's very name terrified me.

1345
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,690
Even with all the fear, 
you managed to kill him.

1346
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,820
[chuckles]

1347
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,290
What I don't understand is...

1348
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:17,630
You went to the same Vinay Verma's 
resort a year later after killing him.

1349
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:20,120
That too, with the man you feared so much.

1350
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:20,990
Why?

1351
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,710
I was blackmailed.

1352
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,150
Blackmail?

1353
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:34,250
Who?

1354
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:58,670
WHO DIED HERE?

1355
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,360
Sam, what is that?

1356
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,250
Ah... 
Something I liked online and ordered.

1357
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:19,420
[panting]

1358
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:21,630
Ashok, pick the call...

1359
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,030
-Dial tone: The person you are dialing...  
-Tsk... Tsk...

1360
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:26,800
[dials]

1361
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,480
-Dial tone: The person you are dialing...  
-Tsk... Tsk...

1362
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:34,120
[phone ringing continously]

1363
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,320
Stop trying to figure out who I am 
and follow my instructions.

1364
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,820
You don't have any other option.

1365
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,150
Come to Coonoor tomorrow 
with two crore rupees.

1366
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,120
Hello!

1367
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:33,110
[phone ringing continously]

1368
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,020
I got the money.

1369
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,250
Follow my instructions... 
Go to room number 501.

1370
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,150
But...

1371
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,230
[door creaking]

1372
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:58,810
Hello!

1373
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:01,270
-Place the money above the fire place.  
-Huh?

1374
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:22,620
Hello. I've placed the money. 
Can I leave now?

1375
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,390
There is something else you need to do.

1376
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,660
-What?-Go and open the side drawer.

1377
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,600
A person will come to the room now. 
Kill him.

1378
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,630
What do you mean I kill him?

1379
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,460
Hello! Hello! 
[door creaking]

1380
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:39,630
Sam!

1381
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:41,330
Ashok?

1382
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,600
What are you doing here?

1383
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,870
Did he blackmail you as well?

1384
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,370
I tried calling you.

1385
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,640
I've been trying for a year, Sam.

1386
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,980
He told me to switch off the phone.

1387
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:58,950
I will handle it. Leave.

1388
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,580
No, Ashok. We both have done wrong.

1389
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,220
We have to make this right.

1390
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:08,100
How do we know he will 
stop blackmailing us?

1391
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,020
That's why let us meet Vinay Varma's 
family and confess.

1392
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:12,450
-Sam, Sam! Listen to me. Listen to me! 
-We have to ask for forgiveness.

1393
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,750
-I will take care. Just leave. 
-Ashok, please understand.

1394
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,420
Listen to me. You are not 
thinking straight. [phone beeps]

1395
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,800
You trust me, don't you? Sam?

1396
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:22,510
Who is it, Sam?

1397
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,230
Who is it?

1398
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,900
He is asking me to kill...

1399
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,200
He is asking me to kill you!

1400
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,200
What do you want me to do now?

1401
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,750
Is he asking you to kill me?

1402
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,590
I'll not spare him. 
I will kill him!

1403
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,660
-How many people will you kill? 
-Hey!

1404
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,530
Who did I do this for?

1405
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,340
Still you pushed me away, huh?

1406
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:46,110
I was scared.

1407
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,050
I wanted to share my life with you.

1408
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:55,990
But you said I didn't match 
your parents' expectations.

1409
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,620
I didn't ask you anything at that moment.

1410
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,900
I didn't ask you anything 
when you came to me.

1411
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,320
But I'm asking you now...

1412
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,890
If you've honestly loved me,

1413
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,560
let us go and confess, Ashok.

1414
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,640
Please, Ashok.

1415
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,870
Not if I have loved...

1416
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,300
I've always loved you.

1417
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,590
Even now.

1418
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:28,550
If this confession proves my love for you, 
then let's do it.

1419
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:34,100
This isn't for you but 
it's for the Sam I loved.

1420
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,500
But remember one thing.

1421
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,070
The truth will change everything.

1422
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,120
No one will stand by us.

1423
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:46,420
Will you be with me?

1424
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,580
Ashok!

1425
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,350
[mirror breaks]

1426
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,140
[glass shatters]

1427
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,020
Ashok. 
[gasps]

1428
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:48,120
Sorry, Sam.

1429
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,240
-To save myself... 
-Ashok, what are you doing?

1430
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,320
...he asked me to kill you.

1431
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,160
[mumbling] 
[panting]

1432
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:56,760
Sam! Don't... 
[gun shots]

1433
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:01,180
I tried telling the truth.

1434
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,600
But the man who loved me 
tried to kill me.

1435
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,210
I couldn't handle it.

1436
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:11,160
In a way, I think I have done justice to 
Vinay Varma's family by killing Ashok.

1437
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:13,280
Tell me, Vikram.

1438
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,990
Did I do it right or wrong?

1439
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:17,800
Right.

1440
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,450
You will be happy if I hand 
over this phone to you.

1441
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:33,570
I'll be happy if you give me the money 
you promised for giving you this evidence.

1442
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,490
Ah... You returned the phone but 
Adarsh knows I went to his house.

1443
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,520
How will you manage him?

1444
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,760
You said it yourself...

1445
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,060
You have done justice to Vinay Varma's 
family by killing Ashok.

1446
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,780
Isn't that enough for Adarsh 
to forgive you?

1447
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:01,210
[scoffs] 
Vikram...

1448
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:04,000
You are emotionally connected to Adarsh, 
right?

1449
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:08,210
Why are you helping me instead of him?

1450
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:10,560
[scoffs] I am helping Adarsh.

1451
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,130
Adarsh is hospitalized.

1452
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:15,740
He was very disturbed after 
the Nectar Garden events.

1453
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,800
I don't know much about medicine,

1454
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,730
but I think his cancer relapsed 
because of the trauma and tension.

1455
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:26,790
It seems there is a new treatment at UCLA 
in the US and would cost one crore.

1456
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,660
That's when I realized that Adarsh's life 
is more important than his father's death.

1457
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,410
[scoffs] Though this is wrong, the 
money is for the treatment.

1458
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:35,230
Vikram...

1459
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:39,910
It's not because you gave me evidence 
but I owe at least that much to Adarsh.

1460
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:44,410
For whatever Ashok did, I need to. 
It's my duty.

1461
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,320
Hello, Bhanu...

1462
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,070
Ah... I'll send a guy named Vikram.

1463
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,000
Keep one crore in cash ready 
and hand it over to him.

1464
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,770
Actually, keep two crores ready.

1465
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:02,810
I will speak to Rahul.

1466
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:03,850
Thank you.

1467
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,110
I thought of paying it that day...

1468
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:11,530
I am giving it today.

1469
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:16,970
Madam.

1470
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:22,730
Good luck.

1471
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,090
Thank you.

1472
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,840
[phone 
ringing] Hello!

1473
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:38,230
What? Hello... Hello... 
[thunders rumbling]

1474
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,330
Vikram!

1475
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,250
The police have arrested Banerjee.

1476
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,410
What?

1477
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,060
Hello, Ramesh. 
This is Vikram speaking.

1478
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,130
Which lawyer?

1479
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,180
Banerjee?

1480
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,450
Who is handling it?

1481
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:56,460
Suresh?

1482
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,140
Ok, ok.

1483
01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:02,450
How strange that Banerjee got caught 
at the crime scene with two crores!

1484
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:04,610
So Banerjee was in Coonoor!

1485
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:07,430
I thought you told me the truth.

1486
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:09,820
You hid something from me?

1487
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,320
Actually, I got one more call 
from the blackmailer.

1488
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,550
He demanded five crores this time.

1489
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,030
But I wasn't scared of his demands. 
[chaos] [glass shatters]

1490
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,990
He threatened to reveal to the cops 
about the two crores I hid in the room.

1491
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,080
I asked him for some time.

1492
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,610
Meanwhile, you sent Banerjee 
to get the cash.

1493
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,450
How could you be so stupid?

1494
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,820
Damn! 
Okay, you don't need me anymore.

1495
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,280
You have your plans. See you.

1496
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,360
It was such a waste of time!

1497
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,710
Vikram! Please don't say that. 
I really need to get out of this.

1498
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:50,620
Please! I am not asking you 
to do it for free.

1499
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,290
Madam, not everything is about money.

1500
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,600
I am wondering how you could be 
so foolish.

1501
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:01,960
If you agree that the 
money belongs to you,

1502
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,120
you will have totell 
about the blackmailer.

1503
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:06,120
If they ask about the blackmailer, 
you will have to mention Vinay Varma.

1504
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:09,340
If you say that Ashok killed Vinay Varma, 
your affair will be exposed.

1505
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,980
Only Ashok knows where Vinay 
Varma's body is. So you killed him.

1506
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:16,800
Conveniently.

1507
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,560
You don't know who the blackmailer is.

1508
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,930
You don't know where Vinay 
Varma's body is. [scoffs]

1509
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,490
No one would believe you.

1510
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,050
But that is why Banerjee 
has hired you.

1511
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,820
The court want proofs 
but not the information.

1512
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,010
It's not what you know.

1513
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,790
-It's what you can prove. 
-[scoffs]

1514
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,960
If we know where Vinay Varma's body is,

1515
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:48,560
we would definitely find Ashok's 
DNA on the body as he killed him.

1516
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,640
Then we can say Ashok was blackmailing 
you to expose your affair to Rahul.

1517
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,960
And we can create a scenario establishing 
Ashok as the culprit.

1518
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,950
[thunders rumbling] We need 
only one thing now.

1519
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:57,830
Madam, where is the body?

1520
01:28:59,140 --> 01:28:59,930
I really don't know.

1521
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:00,870
-Bullshit! 
-[gasps]

1522
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:02,330
It wasn't Ashok who hid the body. 
It was you!

1523
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,020
It isn't the Amazon forest to 
lose your way for four hours.

1524
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:07,300
Ashok doesn't have superpowers to vanish 
with a broken leg.

1525
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:08,840
I am not a fool to believe all this.

1526
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,660
What will you do if Ratnakar accuses 
you like this in the court?

1527
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:15,890
Vikram!

1528
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:17,890
I really don't know where the body is.

1529
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:19,370
I don't trust you.

1530
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:25,860
You had a greater motive 
to kill Vinay Varma than Ashok.

1531
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,490
Shall I tell you the reason?

1532
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,200
Vinay Varma would always 
be a threat to you.

1533
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,450
You were afraid that if 
your wedding was called off,

1534
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,210
the life that you had dreamt off 
would be gone.

1535
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:39,320
So you had to kill Vinay Varma 
to protect your dream life.

1536
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:41,860
Am I right?

1537
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:47,030
You don't know me but 
I know you very well.

1538
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,760
Don't worry.

1539
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,610
Mend your ways.

1540
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,060
It would be good for you.

1541
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:57,050
Uncle.

1542
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,160
I'm sorry.

1543
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:19,330
[shouts]

1544
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:24,810
Hey, Sam!

1545
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,210
He threatened me, Ashok.

1546
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,890
What will happen if Rahul 
comes to know the truth!

1547
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:42,670
It's true that Ashok's leg was 
caught and you went to help him.

1548
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:43,830
[vehicle arriving]But out of fear...

1549
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,610
-Ashok! Please go!-You might have convinced Ashok to go up.

1550
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,080
After Ashok left, 
you did not find Vinay Varma there.

1551
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:51,450
It's just you who knows 
about what happened later.

1552
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,150
The court wouldn't go by 
assumptions but they only need proof.

1553
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:02,780
And you said, "It's not what you know 
but it's what you can prove, right?"

1554
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:05,180
[chuckles] I 
got you again.

1555
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:07,710
When I made such a big accusation on you,

1556
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,420
you are saying that I can't 
prove it but you are not denying it!

1557
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:15,360
So I am correct.

1558
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,710
[raining]

1559
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,310
Vikram! 
Do you really think,

1560
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:27,620
I could move an 80 kg man from a 
crime scene and make him disappear?

1561
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,470
Logically no.

1562
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,690
So what I said is true.

1563
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,470
Ashok killed Vinay Varma 
and that's all I know.

1564
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:38,790
[sniggering] One can learn 
to lie confidently from you.

1565
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,510
You never told me that Rahul was gay.

1566
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:42,670
I found out myself.

1567
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,580
You didn't accept that Ashok was your ex.

1568
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:46,890
I made you accept it.

1569
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,300
Even now you are hiding something big.

1570
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:53,470
Won't you tell me?

1571
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,420
Your silence spills the truth.

1572
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,740
The blackmailer did not ask 
you to kill Ashok.

1573
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,640
Ashok never planned to kill you.

1574
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,800
You pre-planned everything 
and killed Ashok.

1575
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:13,540
Lies told with confidence 
doesn't become true.

1576
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:18,270
Just because you don't agree, 
the truth can't become a lie.

1577
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:21,710
It's a fact that Ashok 
killed Vinay Varma.

1578
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:23,290
It's a fact that Ashok tried to kill me.

1579
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:26,460
[scoffs] If the blackmailer 
threatened you both,

1580
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:28,760
he would've asked both of you 
to get the money?

1581
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:31,490
But Ashok didn't bring any money.

1582
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,320
How do you know?

1583
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:38,280
Ashok wanted to confess 
everything to Vinay Varma's family.

1584
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:40,400
How do you know?

1585
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:46,030
Ashok promised to tell the 
truth to the blackmailer.

1586
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,580
How do you know?

1587
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:49,790
[scoffs]

1588
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,800
Because...

1589
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,800
The one who blackmailer...

1590
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:05,920
...is me.

1591
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,750
You... 
[voice muted]

1592
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:20,010
I blackmailed you both for Adarsh.

1593
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,050
You played me? Huh?

1594
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:25,050
I started the game.

1595
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,160
But you changed the 
rules by killing Ashok.

1596
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,250
I didn't bring any money.

1597
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,040
If you want to report this to the police 
please do it.

1598
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,130
I am not responsible for 
Vinay Varma's missing.

1599
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,260
But, 
I am ready for anything.

1600
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,690
I'm not here because I'm scared.

1601
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,950
I am here to confess the truth 
to Vinay Varma's family.

1602
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:53,920
Will you confess?

1603
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:54,970
Will you confess?

1604
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:59,740
So I came here to inform 
you since I love you.

1605
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:03,480
But I never knew 
I was the only one in love.

1606
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,740
I'm an idiot.

1607
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:06,960
But I just realized.

1608
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:10,010
Money is more important to you.

1609
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:16,630
Because you chose to marry him instead 
of me even after knowing about Rahul.

1610
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,560
You have killed Vinay Varma as 
your wedding would get cancelled!

1611
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,350
You used me to hide the truth.

1612
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,400
Why? 
Were you scared...

1613
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,630
...that dreams of money and status 
would ruin if Adarsh reaches you?

1614
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:42,090
Sam, when you ignored me I realised...

1615
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,320
that I made so many mistakes for you.

1616
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,190
That's why, I've decided to confess.

1617
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,440
Ashok, do you what the truth is?

1618
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,440
You deserved better.

1619
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:03,360
I kept my distance because,

1620
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:08,030
I didn't want to create a mess 
between you and Vaishnavi.

1621
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:09,780
I wanted you to be happy.

1622
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,750
Ashok, it's not enough to be in love.

1623
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,540
We need to understand each other.

1624
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:15,600
And clearly you didn't understand me.

1625
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,280
Do you know how difficult 
this one year was, for me? Huh?

1626
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,250
I always wondered 
if you would forgive me.

1627
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:28,940
Because, who else do I have 
in this world apart from you?

1628
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,510
Ashok, I loved only you.

1629
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:46,280
If you think confessing is 
proof of my love then let us do it.

1630
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,570
But remember one thing.

1631
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,650
The truth will change everything.

1632
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,510
No one will stand by us.

1633
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:58,980
Will you be with me?

1634
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,250
[thud] 
[groans]

1635
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,670
When I heard Ashok screaming...

1636
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,520
that you were going to do something.

1637
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,440
[glass breaks]

1638
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:47,220
[glass shatters]

1639
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:51,280
-Sam! 
-Ouch!

1640
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,080
Sam! 
[gun shots]

1641
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:57,240
[panting] 
[gun shots]

1642
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:01,590
Open the door.

1643
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:05,190
[shouts]

1644
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,940
[indistinct voices]

1645
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:25,500
Two more steps... Just two more... 
I would've been in the room.

1646
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,370
I would've arrested you for killing Ashok.

1647
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,990
But I wouldn't have been able to 
save Adarsh if you get arrested.

1648
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:36,390
That's why I had to stop myself.

1649
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:38,130
I thought you were helping me.

1650
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,250
But you are playing games with me!

1651
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,430
I gave you all the information, right?

1652
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:45,310
You and I did all of 
these only for the money.

1653
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:46,740
Good!

1654
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,140
Listen to my plan then.

1655
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:52,560
No body! 
No crime!

1656
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:57,910
Right now there is nothing that can 
connect me to Vinay Varma's death.

1657
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:00,530
But everything is connecting you 
to Ashok's death now.

1658
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:03,310
Your game was over at the 
moment Banerjee caught there.

1659
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,910
To get away with Ashok's murder, 
you have to prove that he did everything.

1660
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:09,630
Which means evidence against Ashok has 
to be placed on Vinay Varma's body.

1661
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:10,970
And only I can do it for you.

1662
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:11,550
[scoffs]

1663
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:17,420
Madam, 
the situation is still in my control.

1664
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,670
Do you think I will give 
up if you torture me?

1665
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:23,600
[scoffs] You feel one hour as torture?

1666
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,310
How can you explain that 
torture to Vinay Varma's wife,

1667
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:30,520
who was waiting for one year, 
two months and seventeen days.

1668
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,650
And what about Adarsh's pain,

1669
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,550
who has been waiting for his father's 
arrival and fighting for his own life?

1670
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,010
Get out!

1671
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,110
Bhanu will not pay you now.

1672
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:45,040
Will you get the money only after you 
plant evidence on Vinay Varma's body.

1673
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:46,610
Got it?

1674
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:53,080
[scoffs] You won't be able 
to save Adarsh till then.

1675
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,120
By the way...

1676
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,840
...The situation is still in my control.

1677
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:09,880
Where is the body, madam?

1678
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,710
[raining] 
[thunders rumbling]

1679
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,410
[groans]

1680
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:37,130
[leaves rustling]

1681
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,890
[leaves rustling]

1682
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:20,490
How could you kill him so brutally?

1683
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:22,300
Tsk! 
I had to do it.

1684
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:23,580
So what?

1685
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:24,830
Move on.

1686
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:40,490
Don't play any more games...

1687
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,100
I've transferred 25 
lakhs to your account.

1688
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:45,070
Remember? Bribe.

1689
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,950
Sorry, it's a fancy word, right?

1690
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:48,980
Bribe!

1691
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:51,630
[scoffs] I will tell them 
you have asked for it.

1692
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:53,320
Like I said,

1693
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:57,080
situation will always be in my control.

1694
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,140
Case closed!

1695
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:13,940
Madam!

1696
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:07,770
Now the case is closed.

1697
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:14,190
Vikram! Vikram! Stop! 
How much do you want?

1698
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,520
Two? Five? Ten?

1699
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,140
Tell me, Vikram, 
how much do you want?

1700
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:23,710
I had to do it.

1701
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:26,050
So what!

1702
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:28,790
Move on!

1703
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,440
[guns cocking]

1704
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:07,900
Vikram!

1705
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,520
Please hand over the gun.

1706
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:37,300
You are under arrest for the murders of,

1707
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,300
-Vinay Varma and Ashok Krishna. 
-What?

1708
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,870
No, no, no. 
There's been a mistake.

1709
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,020
-You don't understand. Let me explain. 
-Listen to me.

1710
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:43,050
I am extremely sorry, madam.

1711
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:44,430
We have recorded evidence.

1712
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:48,360
Vikram Vasudev threatened me to confess.

1713
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,940
He even collected 25 lakhs bribe from me.

1714
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,030
-Vikram Vasudev is corrupt. 
-Excuse me!

1715
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:57,210
I am Vikram Vasudev!

1716
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:01,440
Coonoor PS, Tamilnadu State Police.

1717
01:45:05,710 --> 01:45:08,360
You've been talking to Adarsh Varma,

1718
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:11,800
son of Vinay Varma.

1719
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,320
[coughing] 
Adarsh!

1720
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:19,960
Adarsh!

1721
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,490
Stage two...

1722
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,660
Father, I am in stage two.

1723
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,640
[sobbing]

1724
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,060
Our sadness and our problems 
always look small to others.

1725
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,630
So never depend on anyone.

1726
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,920
Whatever is the situation, 
first accept it.

1727
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:47,500
And then fight it.

1728
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,000
Most importantly Adarsh...

1729
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:52,870
Never ever give up.

1730
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:54,960
Adarsh!

1731
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,550
Where would father have gone 
leaving his car and phone behind?

1732
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:59,080
It's raining outside, mother.

1733
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:01,440
He may have stopped at a friend's place. 
Don't stress.

1734
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,500
[speaking in Tamil]

1735
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:04,620
Sir, Sir, Sir!

1736
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:07,440
My father has been missing 
for two days.

1737
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,140
What is his name?

1738
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,140
Vinay Varma.

1739
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:11,460
-Reddy. 
-Sir.

1740
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,120
-Take the complaint and file the FIR. 
-Okay, sir.

1741
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:15,490
Mother... Mother...

1742
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:18,600
-Adarsh! Why are you so tensed? 
-Vaishnavi lied to us.

1743
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:23,420
She called someone from 
your phone, right?

1744
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:26,150
This number belongs to DSP Ashok Krishna 
of Punjagutta in Hyderabad.

1745
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,730
He has already raised a complaint 
about losing it.

1746
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,380
Try to understand, Adarsh.

1747
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,920
There is a lot of pressure from 
above to close the case.

1748
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:35,460
Doesn't pressure indicate that they did 
something wrong?

1749
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:36,620
I am helpless.

1750
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:38,470
-I have to close your father's case. 
-My father is not a case, sir!

1751
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:41,970
He is my father!

1752
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,010
You gave up but I never did.

1753
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:49,230
It's my father's strength 
that I have overcome cancer.

1754
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:52,550
I spent the whole of last year collecting 
all the evidence.

1755
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:55,420
I found out where my father 
lastly used his phone.

1756
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,340
What are you planning to do with these?

1757
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,250
I have a plan, sir.

1758
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,130
I am Vikram.

1759
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:15,840
Adarsh Varma, the son of Vinay Varma, 
becomes Vikram.

1760
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:17,570
I will narrate a story.

1761
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:21,250
I will make up all the lies by the 
incidents that had happened to me.

1762
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:24,220
I will become Vikram and 
create another Adarsh.

1763
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:27,660
I will use the lies to get the truth.

1764
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:28,940
There is no choice.

1765
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:30,530
And it is not wrong.

1766
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:33,040
Will she believe you? 
You said she saw you?

1767
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,850
They don't know how Vikram looks like.

1768
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,830
She only saw my eyes.

1769
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,460
I will cover those eyes.
