00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
<b>DDR</b>

2
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,500
'No matter how troublesome a marriage is...'

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,750
'It's still called "holy matrimony".'

4
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,166
'Everyone has his or her own reason to get married.'

5
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,541
'Some get married to make their mother get some rest.'

6
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,541
'But it's the daughters-in-law who rests.'

7
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,750
'Some get married for entertainment.'

8
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,875
'And then, there are some who don't even want to walk on its path...'

9
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:28,000
'But marriage finds a way to cross their path.'

10
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,708
'One such person is Kumar Shivram Kishan.'

11
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,708
'Don't mistake him to be single just because he is smiling.'

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,541
'He too is married.'

13
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,041
'Not once but thrice.'

14
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,833
'All of them happened without his consent.'

15
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,041
'This happened around a year ago.'

16
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,041
'So, let's have a look at the first accident.'

17
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:14,666
Are you okay?

18
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:15,833
I am fine.

19
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,916
My father is in the hospital. He is very serious.

20
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,791
I was taking these medicines for him. Can you please help me?

21
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,791
No problem.

22
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,791
Don't worry. Come with me.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,500
Your daughter is here.

24
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,041
We've brought your medicines, uncle.

25
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,083
Now, you will get well soon.

26
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,916
Now I'll have no regrets even if something happens to me.

27
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,958
I had just one concern.

28
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,875
That before I die, I should give my daughter's hand..

29
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,875
..into a suitable boy's hand.

30
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,375
Any way..

31
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,375
Yes?

32
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,875
Take care of her.

33
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,625
What?

34
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,000
Hello? Uncle?

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,333
Brother? Hello?

36
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,166
Uncle?

37
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,500
Now he won't say anything.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
He can at least hear me, right?

39
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,500
Hello? Uncle?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,250
I am sorry. He is no more.

41
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,500
How can he just die?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,250
He was alive a minute ago.

43
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,416
Papa!

44
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:32,500
Papa!

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,875
Papa, no!

46
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,666
He was a fortunate one, to die after getting his daughter settled.

47
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,166
Settled? Who got settled?

48
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,250
Yes, son.

49
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
You have fulfilled a dying man's wish.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,875
I didn't do anything.

51
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,458
Look, he left with a smile.

52
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,041
You are a great soul, son.

53
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,500
Here's your wedding gift.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,500
Come on, everyone. Give him your gifts.

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,625
'As wedding gifts, he got...'

56
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:07,333
'Rs. 45, 2 bananas, 2 oranges, a few change and a bottle of saline.'

57
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,708
'There's a saying: once bitten twice shy.'

58
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,500
'But when your time is bad, you end up biting your own self.'

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,708
'Shivram Kishan also loves to..'

60
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,666
'..bite into ice creams served at the weddings.'

61
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,250
'He went to his friend Ballu's wedding.'

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,625
How much does she give in year?

63
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:26,333
What?

64
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,500
I mean how many marriages does she attend in a season?

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,166
Sir, she is a very lucky mare.

66
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,833
The one who touches her gets married.

67
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,666
Her name is "the runaway mare".

68
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,166
No. I don't want to get married. My friend Ballu is getting married.

69
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,125
Okay. No problem.

70
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,166
He always said that he will settle down in Canada.

71
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,583
But he didn't have the money.

72
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,416
Then I advised him to get married and settle down here...

73
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,625
Close to his own people.

74
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,541
And look, he is getting is married today.

75
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:48,958
Kumar!

76
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:49,916
What happened, Jojo?

77
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,458
There is a big problem. - What happened?

78
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,500
Ballu was drinking and driving.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,541
Police arrested him.

80
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,000
So, what do we do now?

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,875
Now only you can help me from defamation.

82
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,541
Wear this and get on the mare.

83
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,333
But how can I take Ballu's place?

84
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,500
I am not asking you to get married.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,708
It's just for a while.

86
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,375
I'll get him released on bail by the time you guys reach the bride's house.

87
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,333
Please. Please, I beg of you.

88
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,708
You don't need to do that, but..

89
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:11,875
Please. Please.

90
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,791
Be there on time.

91
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,458
I will go like this... and I will keep going.

92
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,083
Go slow. Are you the one getting married?

93
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:25,208
What's the hurry? - No problem. We will go slowly.

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:25,833
Hello?

95
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,375
We have reached the bride's house. When are you coming?

96
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,500
We are just leaving the police station.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,208
Hurry up. - Okay.

98
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,166
Ballu, have you switched off your mobile phone?

99
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,208
Yes, brother. - Come on, get in. Hurry up.

100
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,708
To the airport.

101
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,916
It's time for the wedding vows. Get the bride.

102
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,458
I'll get her right away.

103
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh God, they are getting ready for the vows.

104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,500
Why is his phone switched off?

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,583
Sir, start walking around the fire.

106
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,958
Hold on, can I just talk to you for a second?

107
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,375
Hurry up.

108
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,666
Look, we cannot get married.

109
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,583
Why?

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,333
Look at me.

111
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,541
Aren't you surprised?

112
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,708
Why would I be surprised?

113
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,041
Because I am not Ballu.

114
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,000
I know. You are Ballu's friend.

115
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,458
Right. You were supposed to be getting married to Ballu, right?

116
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,708
Ballu had shown me your photo.

117
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,416
I liked you as soon as I saw your photo.

118
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,250
Ballu showed you my photo?

119
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,208
Yes.

120
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,708
And we are the ones who sent the Rs. 50 lakhs needed for your business.

121
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,666
50 lakhs? - Yes.

122
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,166
Ballu!

123
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,750
So he's off to Canada.

124
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,125
Look, I have been deceived.

125
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,458
I cannot get married to you.

126
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,875
What are you saying?

127
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,250
All the guests are here.

128
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,958
Then find a suitable one among the guests and get married.

129
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:41,875
But I cannot get married to you.

130
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,583
Look, I have already been through one tragedy.

131
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,541
I am the one who has gone through an tragedy.

132
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,500
I am a model.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,791
While walking on the ramp accidentally all my clothes came off.

134
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,791
Because of that I have face a lot of humiliation.

135
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,125
My marriage has already been called off thrice.

136
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,916
Please don't say that.

137
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,708
If you don't marry me, I will jump into this fire and kill myself.

138
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,500
Look, I can understand your problem.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,208
But you too should try to understand my problem.

140
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,500
You cannot marry me. - No, I can't.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,875
But I can kill myself.

142
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,875
Hey! Hello!

143
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,541
'Do something good and get something bad in return.'

144
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,333
'This is what has been happening in Shivram's life.'

145
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,666
'But in spite of that he didn't change.'

146
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,875
'So far he would personally come forward to help others.'

147
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,375
'This time someone came to him to seek his help.'

148
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,916
'What could the poor guy do?'

149
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,708
Help!

150
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,416
Help! Please help me.

151
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:52,875
Those goons are after me.

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:53,958
How can they be after you?

153
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,583
There is something called as law and order in this city.

154
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:56,583
Let's go and handle them.

155
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:02,666
There are 10-15 of them. - 10-15! Hop on. Hurry up.

156
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,500
Let's follow them. - Yes.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,333
Hello?

158
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello, Anil? I ran away from my wedding.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,083
Who asked you to run away?

160
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,750
They were getting me married to someone else.

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,083
It doesn't matter to me where you get married.

162
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,833
What are you saying, Anil?

163
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,958
You said you love me.

164
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,708
That was before I knew that you were a don's sister.

165
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,208
So please, it's over.

166
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,625
Anil! Anil, please don't do that.

167
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,916
Where will I go, if you don't support me?

168
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,125
Just go to hell.

169
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,583
Hello?

170
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Hello.

171
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,958
Anil...

172
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,500
Look, I don't know who you are.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,125
But please, don't cry.

174
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,500
Everything happens for a reason.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Hey, hello.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,708
Where are you going?

177
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,458
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

178
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,583
Get down. - Just leave me.

179
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,250
Get down. - Let me die.

180
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,083
Have you lost your mind? - Then what should I do?

181
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,625
You want to die because a guy left you?

182
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,416
You have just one reason to die?

183
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,125
But have you ever thought how many reasons you can have to stay alive?

184
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,500
You can live for the one who is made only for you.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,166
The one you cannot tolerate a single tear in your eyes.

186
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,958
The one who never let go of your hand.

187
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,958
Come, let me take you home.

188
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:27,916
Let's go.

189
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,625
Now how will I face everyone?

190
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,083
My brother... he will kill me.

191
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,791
He is your brother, not an executioner .

192
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,791
I will talk to him.

193
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,541
Tiger-bhai. - Brother.

194
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,500
He is your brother? - Yes.

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,750
'That's Tiger-bhai, the infamous don of this city.'

196
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,125
'Everyone fears him.'

197
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,333
'He hates only one thing, dowry.'

198
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,333
'He seeks double from those who seek dowry.'

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,500
Let go of my hand, please.

200
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,708
You made your brother see this day?

201
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,708
Let's go home.

202
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,583
Everyone in this city gets scared of me and runs away.

203
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,916
But when you ran away, I got scared.

204
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,583
Stupid, how can my anger ever be more important than your happiness?

205
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,625
I will do whatever you say.

206
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,541
Yes, sir. That's what I was telling her.

207
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,375
A brother will never wish bad or evil for his sister.

208
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,375
But you are a don, and also her brother...

209
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,458
Anjali, you don't need to run away with the boy you like.

210
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,875
You should rather settle down with him.

211
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,875
Yes.

212
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,583
I like this boy.

213
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,583
What?

214
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,333
Tiger-bhai!

215
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,416
Tiger-bhai!

216
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,916
Move aside! I want to talk to him.

217
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:18,958
He doesn't listen to anyone.

218
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,250
But he will have to listen to me, otherwise I will be in trouble.

219
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,583
Tiger-bhai is deaf. How will he listen to him?

220
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,625
Tiger-bhai!

221
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:26,750
Look...

222
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,041
I am not the boy for whom your sister ran away from her wedding.

223
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,583
Look, I was on the road and your sister was running.

224
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,833
And your goons... your staff was after her.

225
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,000
So I thought I should save her from them.

226
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,208
I saved her from committing suicide.

227
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,458
Please forgive me, sir. I am a married man.

228
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,333
Why are you folding your hands like this?

229
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,916
I will hold my hands while sending off my sister.

230
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,041
Sir, you don't understand.

231
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,500
I already have two wives.

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,250
Yes, we will get you married right here.

233
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,916
Like you, I too am in a hurry.

234
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,583
Look, you are misunderstanding me.

235
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,500
I have nothing to do with your sister.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,708
You won't take dowry?

237
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,375
That's so nice of you. I too am completely against dowry.

238
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,750
But remember one thing, my sister shouldn't lack anything.

239
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,708
Because here, there are plenty of guns but only one sister.

240
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,708
Priest, you may begin.

241
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,041
'This is how tragically Kumar Shivram got married thrice.'

242
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,250
'His wives brought him good luck.'

243
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,583
'Now he has money and is also the CEO of the Provogue company.'

244
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,375
'What he doesn't have is peace of mind.'

245
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:56,250
He always come to me to find that.

246
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,083
Look carefully at this man!

247
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,500
This man who looks innocent, is married to three women.

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,416
Out of the fear that his wives don't meet each other accidentally...

249
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,500
He has kept one in Borivali, one in Andheri and one in Bandra.

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,041
He has also told them that he spends one night at home and two on duty.

251
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,833
So that he can spend a day with each of them.

252
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,125
Out of the fear of getting caught he has saved his wives numbers as....

253
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,583
Head office, Branch office and Area office.

254
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,208
In the disguise of three offices, he runs three household...

255
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,583
And yet, he roams around in a carefree manner.

256
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,666
With cameraman Karan, it's me, myself.

257
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,541
Are you done with your shooting?

258
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,750
I was just joking.

259
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,750
My life is in a mess and you are joking.

260
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,166
All my three wives say that it's okay if I spend two nights in my office...

261
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,750
But I should wish them good morning before I go to office.

262
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,666
I should say bye to them.

263
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,416
All three of them want a good morning kiss.

264
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,916
Now for one kiss I have to travel 30 kilometers.

265
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,708
I am more like a local train now.

266
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,208
I don't know who all should I love.

267
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,125
How do I love them?

268
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,500
If this is creating so much problem for you...

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,833
Why don't you keep them at one place?

270
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,000
At one place?

271
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,958
Who made you a lawyer, you dimwit?

272
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,958
If they even got a hint of each other's existence...

273
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,500
They will either kill me or themselves.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,250
I am not asking you to keep them in the same house.

275
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,166
Keep them in the same building.

276
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,333
Keep them on different floors.

277
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,000
So they won't find out about each other if they are on separate floors?

278
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,791
Do you know Jatin Matre?

279
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,458
No. Why does he too have three wives?

280
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,875
No. He is not that ill-fated.

281
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,083
He just has one wife.

282
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,500
He stays in your Bandra building, on the same floor.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,541
Really? - Yes.

284
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,500
When you don't know who stays on your floor, in your building...

285
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,458
Then how will your wives find out about who stays in the other floors?

286
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:25,750
It's not a bad idea.

287
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,166
But it is not easy to get three flats in the same building.

288
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,833
My love, this is Mumbai. Everything is possible here.

289
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,000
Look over there. Cocktail Tower.

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,166
It's a new building. Forget three, you will get ten flats in it.

291
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,958
The one who made you a lawyer did the right thing.

292
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,000
Three wives on different floors in the same building.

293
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,000
And you on the top floor.

294
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Me? Why?

295
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,791
I will use you as an excuse to meet the three of them.

296
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:47,708
No one will get suspicious.

297
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,750
I am anyway not getting any case and you are making me spend more?

298
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,083
I will bear the expenses, why are you cribbing?

299
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,708
But.. - Welcome to Cocktail Tower.

300
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:53,833
Welcome to Cocktail Tower, my love.

301
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,958
But I don't want to stay there!

302
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,666
'Shivram Kishan took my advice..

303
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,125
..and brought three flats in Cocktail Tower.'

304
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:06,041
'Now let's see how peaceful is his life.'

305
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,375
Two wives serve me and this one make me serve her.

306
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,291
Anyway, whatever God wills.

307
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,416
Simran, I am getting late.

308
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,958
You take more time to bathe once than I take in a year.

309
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,500
You will wither one day.

310
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,500
The tea is also...

311
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,166
What will you have?

312
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,625
Hot tea... or me?

313
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,666
Sweetie, you make it difficult for me to go to office.

314
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,166
Then why do you leave me and go?

315
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,666
Come on, Shiv. At least be a little romantic.

316
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,041
A little everywhere becomes a lot for me.

317
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:58,791
What?

318
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,250
I mean, you give me a lot of love, little by little.

319
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Now what do I tell you.

320
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,875
No, I will show you. It's just a trailer.

321
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,625
Bai (Maid).

322
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,291
Say bye when I let you go.

323
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,000
Our maid.

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Behind you.

325
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,375
Champa, can't you knock before entering?

326
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,375
Can't you lock the door?

327
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,041
First dust the bedroom.

328
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,875
No, I will go the kitchen first.

329
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,500
The bedroom takes a lot of time.

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,500
It's always very dirty.

331
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,250
Sorry, it fell.

332
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,708
Anyway it was old.

333
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:54,958
Let it be, sweetie.

334
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,041
I don't think Champa is in a good mood today.

335
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,000
Some other time.

336
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,875
Anyway, you are always in the mood.

337
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,416
I'll go meet Karan and then leave. Okay? Bye.

338
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,666
Okay. Bye.

339
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,166
Rude!

340
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,166
"Rude!"

341
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:16,166
6th floor.

342
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,583
Hi.

343
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,791
What is this, sweetheart? You are always playing video games.

344
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:26,833
Then what else should I do?

345
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,833
You don't have time for me.

346
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,000
You have brought such a big house for only me?

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,000
Of course, sweetheart.

348
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,750
It's for both of us.

349
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,833
We are together only for one night.

350
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,541
You are on duty for the other two nights.

351
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,375
I am on duty only for namesake. Actually, I am with my wife.

352
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,750
What?

353
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,708
I mean, I am always thinking about you.

354
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,291
Ram...

355
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,250
Don't you think there should be a child in this house?

356
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,666
Whose child will we get?

357
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,291
Not someone else's child.

358
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,125
I am talking about our child. - Okay.

359
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,458
I really wish to play with the kids.

360
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,083
You are a grown up. Why do you want to play with kids?

361
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,791
You don't understand anything.

362
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:04,958
Let it be.

363
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,500
I rather meet the ladies in this society and spend my time.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,958
Have you lost your mind? You will meet the ladies of this society?

365
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,958
Here no one meets anyone. No one disturbs anyone.

366
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:13,958
That's why I have come here.

367
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,500
You know what happened in that building?

368
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,625
A woman came to sell soaps.

369
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,500
She hit her on the head with a stick and stole all the jewelry.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,166
You better stay away from the women.

371
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,958
Actually, I don't want anyone to come between us.

372
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,666
You are so possessive about me.

373
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:30,708
That I am, baby.

374
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:35,250
I love you. - I love you too.

375
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,833
Can I go now?

376
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,125
No.

377
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,791
Okay then, I'll get going.

378
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,791
No.

379
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,458
Okay then, I'll get going now.

380
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,291
Fine, go.

381
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:50,125
Okay, baby. Bye. - Bye.

382
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,708
Let's rock on 4th floor.

383
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:52,333
Yes!

384
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,875
Simran! Anjali! Juhi!

385
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,333
Good morning, darling.

386
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,500
You are late. I have been waiting for you.

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,250
Can't help it, darling.

388
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,708
First the head office, then the branch office and now the area office.

389
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:05,875
Area office?

390
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,916
I will go after I meet you.

391
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,416
You work so hard.

392
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,500
And still you take such good care of me.

393
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,541
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.

394
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:15,791
How sweet.

395
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,750
Look what I have here.

396
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,916
Wow. Sweet porridge, fried bread with chickpeas. My favorite.

397
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,000
Where did you order from?

398
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,750
I haven't ordered it from a hotel.

399
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,875
I made it.

400
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,458
You? - Then what!

401
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,208
We don't have a maid.

402
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,500
Don't worry, darling. I will get a nice maid for you.

403
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,958
But the way, what's the occasion?

404
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,583
You forgot? It will be a year today.

405
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,500
Oh God, how can I forgot!

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,166
It's been a year since we got married. Happy anniversary, darling.

407
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,500
No. I haven't made it for our anniversary.

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,875
It's for papa's death anniversary. - Oh.

409
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,708
He too had left this world on this day.

410
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,958
Yes, there is not much difference in his death anniversary and my marriage.

411
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,041
He departed and I got stuck.

412
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:55,958
What?

413
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,125
He was a nice man. I am missing him.

414
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,208
Wait. First feed papa.

415
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,875
Papa? - Yes, I have hanged his photo.

416
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:08,208
Look, over there.

417
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,041
Oh.

418
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,166
How is it?

419
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,375
Very nice.

420
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,333
It looks like he is laughing at me.

421
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,458
Should I go feed him?

422
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,458
Yes. I'll go and get water.

423
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,500
You are laughing and displaying your 8 inch long teeth.

424
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,083
If you would've waited for another five minutes on that day...

425
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,458
I would've escaped this fate.

426
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,125
But you kept her hand in mine and exited.

427
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,250
You didn't give your daughter to me, you made my life...

428
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,583
Now what do I tell you?

429
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,875
You messed up my life and now you want to have these delicacies?

430
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:40,833
Right, old man?

431
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,500
"Right, old man?"

432
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Cute old man.

433
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,541
Such old man are hard to find in the market.

434
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:46,625
Again old man?

435
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:47,500
Papa, darling.

436
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,041
Do one thing, feed papa. I am leaving. Okay?

437
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,333
But at least eat some from his plate.

438
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,458
I'll eat it in the evening, darling.

439
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,458
I already have too much in my plate, and she wants me to eat that.

440
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,375
Don't be so surprised.

441
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:01,500
Apart from these forced wives, Shivram Kishan also has a girlfriend.

442
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,500
'Deepika. She is very religious.'

443
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,875
Do you have any idea how much I missed you?

444
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:31,958
You missed me, huh?

445
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,291
I came back from London after a year...

446
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:34,583
And you didn't even come to receive me at the airport.

447
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,875
Deepu, now what do I tell you? Work always keeps me busy.

448
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,416
You know I opened three offices in the past one year.

449
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:42,166
Wow, Kumar! That's great news.

450
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,916
Dad too will be very pleased.

451
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,083
No, I cannot show my offices to your dad.

452
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,041
What do you mean? - Your dad is such big businessman.

453
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,625
My three offices are nothing when compared to his.

454
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,875
I want you to have ten offices, instead of three.

455
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,208
For God's sake. Please, don't say that.

456
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:55,833
Why?

457
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,833
Then how will I spend time with you, Deepu?

458
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,250
I don't just need your time.

459
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,208
I need your companionship for a lifetime.

460
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,333
You know, God have already given a lot, without even asking for it.

461
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,666
But if there is anything I have asked God for myself...

462
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,625
It's you.

463
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,875
I love you, Kumar.

464
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,250
When are you going to meet my dad?

465
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,125
I will meet your dad. I will meet him anytime you want.

466
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,125
Not anytime, today, right now.

467
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,208
Do one thing. First show your dad a good photo of mine.

468
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:28,125
If he rejects my photo, I'll go meet him to get myself selected.

469
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,666
Baby, the thing is, it's not nice to get insulted on the face.

470
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,916
Don't take my father lightly.

471
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:36,916
He has a very different philosophy of life.

472
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,166
Have you brought your documents?

473
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,458
Yes, sir. Here are my documents.

474
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,083
Your degree is fine. Have you brought your life partner's photograph?

475
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,416
No, sir. I don't have her photo.

476
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:51,916
That's what is important.

477
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,958
My boss lives by the principle that, character comes first.

478
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:58,000
Here, each staff's desk should contains his or her life partner's photo.

479
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,583
Understood? - Yes, sir.

480
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,666
Go and get your life partner's photo.

481
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,166
Sorry, sir.

482
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,125
Have you brought his photo?

483
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:05,250
Yes sir, I have.

484
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,708
Okay, you wait. Sir is saying is prayers. He will send for you.

485
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,916
Uncle... Is dad inside?

486
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes. He is praying.

487
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,541
Dad...

488
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:21,541
Dad, I have to go to my rehearsals. I am getting late.

489
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,458
I am keeping Kumar's photo on the desk.

490
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:31,458
If you have time to spare, you can have a look at it.

491
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,041
Yes, tell...

492
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,833
Hey! She left.

493
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,958
Oh no.

494
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:43,208
Stop Deepika.

495
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,875
She left, sir.

496
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:45,916
Oh God.

497
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:47,250
Sir, candidates are here for the interview.

498
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,500
Shall I send them in? - Yes, send them in.

499
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,500
She got angry once again.

500
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,416
May I come in, sir?

501
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,291
Come in. - Thank you, sir.

502
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,083
Good morning, sir. - Please have a seat.

503
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:04,500
Thank you, sir.

504
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,375
You had asked me to get my fianc's photo.

505
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,083
So I have...

506
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,250
Sorry, sir.

507
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,708
Here you go, sir.

508
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,750
I am going to get married to him.

509
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250
What does he do?

510
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,125
He works at a security agency, sir.

511
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,208
Are you sure he is the one you are going to get married to?

512
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,625
Yes, sir.

513
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,375
Fine. Take this photo and keep it on your desk.

514
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:28,083
Yes, sir.

515
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,208
Get this straight, if you change the photo, you will also have to change your job.

516
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,041
Remember that. - No, sir. The photo won't change.

517
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,416
Thank you, sir.

518
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:39,541
Thank you, Vicky. I got the job because of you.

519
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,833
Who is he?

520
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,625
'If you change the photo, you will also have to change your job.'

521
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,208
'Remember that.'

522
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,208
No. The photo won't change.

523
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,583
Deepu!

524
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:05,958
Deepu!

525
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,541
Deepu!

526
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,291
Deepu!

527
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,666
Hey sweetie...

528
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,333
Sweetheart...

529
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:13,875
Baby! - Uncle...

530
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,250
Uncle, at this age you are teasing a girl? Don't you have any shame?

531
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,166
Come here.

532
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,666
She is my daughter.

533
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,625
Sweetie!

534
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,208
How much more will you make me run?

535
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,000
You should have stayed there for another two minutes.

536
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,708
I was just about to finish my prayer.

537
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,416
Two minutes?

538
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,208
You pray for two hours.

539
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,875
I don't understand what you ask for all this long.

540
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,541
I ask God for your happiness.

541
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:42,916
What else can I ask for, dear?

542
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,125
Oh really? - Yes.

543
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,708
So, did you have a look at the photograph?

544
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,500
I see God's photograph every day.

545
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,208
Not God, Kumar's photograph.

546
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,541
You didn't have a look at it, did you?

547
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,041
No, I didn't. Sorry, dear.

548
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,958
What will I know from the photograph?

549
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,833
Do one thing, invite him to our house tomorrow.

550
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,125
We will meet face to face.

551
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:07,125
You are sure? - Sure.

552
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,416
There is a call from the enquiry office.

553
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:20,541
Now which is this fourth office?

554
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,000
Don't answer it. I'll take it.

555
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,958
You came running as if it's your girlfriend's call...

556
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,291
And you don't want me to answer it.

557
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,500
This is the problem with you women. You can think about nothing but love.

558
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,166
Can you do me a favor?

559
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,125
What? - Will you remove the clothes?

560
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,916
Really? - My clothes. From the wardrobe.

561
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:44,041
Here's your phone.

562
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:44,750
Hello?

563
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,750
You take so long to answer your phone.

564
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,666
I was busy with work.

565
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,083
Forget about work.

566
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,583
Dad wants to meet you in the evening.

567
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,291
In the evening? Okay. I will be there.

568
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,041
Okay, bye.

569
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,125
Hey, how can you just say bye.

570
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,583
I gave you such a good news.

571
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,000
Won't you even give me a kiss?

572
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,291
Listen...I...

573
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,500
I won't hang up otherwise.

574
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,500
Give me a kiss.

575
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:13,625
Who were you kissing on the phone?

576
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,500
I was kissing my phone.

577
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,083
You should kiss it as well. I have got a very big assignment.

578
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,833
Really? - Yes.

579
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,666
This is called black magic.

580
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:26,500
I got a black dress for you and you got the assignment.

581
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Anyway, you look very hot in this dress.

582
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,208
Champa, you always come at the wrong time.

583
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,833
You should change your timings.

584
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,250
You should change your timings.

585
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,125
This is the only time that suits me.

586
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,583
Shall I go and wear this black magic?

587
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,583
Sure. - Okay.

588
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,458
Champa... come an hour late...

589
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,500
And I will pay you 500 rupees more.

590
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I will give a thousand, if you finally manage to kiss him.

591
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,083
This maid...

592
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:10,833
Hi, sweetheart.

593
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,083
Hi.

594
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:17,041
Look who is here.

595
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,833
Why is he here? - What do you mean by why?

596
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,708
When did brother come?

597
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,333
Hello, Tiger-bhai.

598
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,250
Tiger-bhai...

599
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,541
Welcome.

600
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,333
After a long time.

601
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,000
Your face has shrunken.

602
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,208
Have you been running?

603
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,500
No, brother. I just keep going up and down the stairs so...

604
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,583
You don't need to ask.

605
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,208
You are my brother-in-law.

606
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,208
I will give you whatever you want.

607
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,708
I wasn't asking for anything. What I was saying was...

608
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,375
I am not going to listen to you.

609
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,416
I am thinking of buying him Sachin Tendulkar's music album.

610
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,708
But Sachin doesn't sing.

611
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,666
And he too doesn't listen.

612
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:49,916
Don't fight.

613
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,750
Look what I brought for you two.

614
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,375
Don't you think it's a little too small for us?

615
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:58,916
Shut up. It's not for us, but for our child.

616
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,916
I am the only uncle, but I have a lot of desires.

617
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,166
Brother too wants to hear a child's laughter echo in this house.

618
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,791
He wants to hear a child's laughter echo in this house?

619
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,583
But he never listen to the child's father.

620
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,875
The pickle? It's nice. Home-made.

621
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,333
And he wants to hear the laughter.

622
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:17,041
You are always... - I am joking, sweetheart.

623
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,958
Anjali, get him something to eat.

624
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,750
In the meanwhile, we will talk.

625
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,750
Sure, brother. I will get it right away.

626
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,916
Have a seat. - Okay.

627
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,375
Say something.

628
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,083
Should I?

629
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,041
You will be infested with worms.

630
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:34,125
You made me marry your sister at gunpoint.

631
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,833
You know there is no difference in you and the old man downstairs.

632
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,083
He keeps eating delicacies with a smile on his face. - Yes.

633
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,250
And here, you too are eating delicacies with a smile on your face.

634
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,250
I am done eating.

635
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,916
Anyway, I am on a diet.

636
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,208
You are on a diet. - Yes.

637
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:46,458
Why are you alive?

638
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,333
So many diseases get launched every year.

639
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,083
Why don't you get yourself infected with one and die? - Yes.

640
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,041
You know because of you I have three wives.

641
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:58,125
Not three, you should have only two children.

642
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:58,958
Oh God.

643
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,000
Look, he is feeling shy.

644
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
He talks a lot. He's so funny.

645
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
Don't you guys tell him that he is deaf?

646
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,500
He knows.

647
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,666
But he doesn't want to show others that he is deaf.

648
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:09,958
Okay.

649
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,166
Don't worry.

650
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,291
Happiness will soon knock at your doors.

651
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:14,750
The One above listens to everyone.

652
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,375
The above does listen, I know.

653
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,625
You don't need to accompany me, I will manage on my own.

654
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,583
Okay? Bye, Anjali.

655
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,166
Bye, brother.

656
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,500
Since when is he like this, without a sound system?

657
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,458
Actually once he was cleaning his ears with his gun...

658
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,708
And by mistake he clicked the trigger.

659
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,083
Doctor managed to save his life, but he couldn't save his ears.

660
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,416
Why are you crying?

661
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh God. - Oh shit.

662
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,583
I am so sorry. I ruined your shirt.

663
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,166
Go and quickly change it. - Yes.

664
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,833
No. Why? Why change? I will clean it.

665
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,750
Why not? Come with me. - I will clean it.

666
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,208
I will get into trouble if I change.

667
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,875
This is looking so nice.

668
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,416
And look, it's matching my dress as well.

669
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,250
True. But how will the one above...?

670
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,125
The one above? - God.

671
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:54,666
How will I face Him, when He will question me...

672
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,208
I have got such a loving wife but I don't give her time.

673
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,375
How will I face Him?

674
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,416
Oh! How sweet! - Yes, sweet.

675
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:04,958
Tell me, not just your time, you have given her your whole life.

676
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,708
Yes.

677
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,416
Let me go. Stop hugging me, Anjali.

678
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,916
Anjali? - Geetanjali.

679
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,000
But I heard you say Anjali.

680
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,875
The Geeta stayed inside and only Anjali came out.

681
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:14,833
It happens, sometimes.

682
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,500
Well, I was thinking, should we shop from Geetanjali for you?

683
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,375
Oh...

684
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,833
I thought for the first time you said a name and that too the wrong one.

685
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,416
See, I made a mistake as soon as I took a name.

686
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:27,291
That's why I affectionately call you darling, sweetie, sweetheart.

687
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,166
I pray everyone should get a husband like you.

688
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,125
Don't say such things, baby.

689
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:35,125
God does answer ones pray sometimes.

690
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,416
Yes. What's troubling you now?

691
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:45,666
I am in trouble.

692
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,458
Anjali changed the shirt which Simran has made me wear.

693
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:49,500
Now I am getting out of the building.

694
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,250
If Simran sees me, she will start suspecting.

695
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,333
Please take care of it

696
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:53,958
Hey, hello. Listen to me.

697
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,083
Take care of it.

698
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,083
But what should I...

699
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,583
How did Shiv's clothes change? - Sister-in-law!

700
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,958
Sister-in-law, give me the papers. I will get the test done.

701
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,166
Forget that.

702
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:33,416
First tell me, Shiv left the house wearing a black shirt.

703
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,166
And now when I saw him downstairs, he was wearing a blue shirt.

704
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,708
You mean the black shirt appeared blue to you?

705
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:39,666
What do you mean?

706
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,791
It was blue.

707
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,791
No, sister-in-law. It happens.

708
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,083
You must have studied in science.

709
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,250
No. - Superb.

710
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,750
Then you will understand it better.

711
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,208
The sky is black in color, right?

712
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,375
But because of sun's ultraviolet rays it appears blue to us.

713
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,833
It happens because of the distance.

714
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,541
But the distance wasn't that much, Karan.

715
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,083
I say there shouldn't be any distance between you and Ram.

716
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,500
Not Ram, Shiv.

717
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,125
Shiv. Ram. Kishan. All are the same.

718
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,708
There is no distance between you two.

719
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,125
Where there is distance, there is love.

720
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:10,375
Where there is love, there is acceptance.

721
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,916
Where there is acceptance, there is no scope for suspicion.

722
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:16,125
So, give me the papers. I have to get the test done.

723
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:19,250
Fine.

724
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,250
Case solved.

725
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,583
Champa... sister-in-law doesn't understand science.

726
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,166
Did you understand?

727
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,500
I understood.

728
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,791
But Mrs. Gupta didn't.

729
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,166
Once similarly Mr. Gupta's shirt changed.

730
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,833
So she threw it down... - The shirt?

731
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,958
No, Mr. Gupta.

732
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:45,000
Saw! Mr. Gupta would've survived if his wife could understand science.

733
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,000
Science is very important.

734
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,333
What happened, dad?

735
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:02,791
Why are you staring at him?

736
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,375
I think I have seen him somewhere.

737
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,583
Where did I see him?

738
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,500
Dad, he owns a very big business at such a young age.

739
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,708
You must have seen his photo in a business magazine.

740
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,041
Yes, correct.

741
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,333
I have seen his photo. - Yes.

742
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,583
Where did I see his photo?

743
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,500
Are you married?

744
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,875
What are you saying, sir?

745
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,875
Marriage... I never got married, even a little.

746
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,458
Young men these days are always so tensed...

747
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,000
That they looked married in spite of being single.

748
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,833
Don't worry. You are my future son-in-law.

749
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,500
I like him.

750
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,916
Thank you, dad.

751
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:43,958
Love you.

752
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,625
During our time, girls used to..

753
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,125
..run away when they heard about their marriage.

754
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:52,125
And sir, nowadays don't even feel shy when they run away from the house.

755
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,791
He is a funny guy.

756
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,791
Here, have some sweets.

757
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,416
Deepika's dad likes me.

758
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:10,000
Congratulations. Now your funeral is confirmed.

759
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,000
Not funeral, you evil one. The fourth one.

760
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,833
You are getting happy as if this is your first wedding.

761
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,416
Yes, it is my first one, happening willingly. The others were...

762
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,166
Mother?

763
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:20,000
I seek your blessings, mother.

764
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,166
Bholu. God bless you, son.

765
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,208
How are you?

766
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,458
I am fine. How are you?

767
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:26,500
How can I be fine?

768
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,291
You got married a year ago.

769
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,500
When will you come to the village with my daughter-in-law?

770
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,208
Mother, I'll come as soon as I can spare some time from work.

771
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:38,666
If you cannot come with her then at least send me her photograph.

772
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,333
If you don't send her photo..

773
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,875
..then I'll come there and take her to our village with me.

774
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,666
Take her away, mother. I will at least get rid of one trouble.

775
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,041
Idiot, you are address your wife as trouble?

776
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:55,416
Remember... never break a woman's heart.

777
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,500
And never ruin a family.

778
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,500
I haven't, mother. You can ask anyone you want to.

779
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,166
Who do I ask? That idiot also stays with you.

780
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:04,875
He is right here. - Say hi.

781
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,208
He says hi.

782
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,708
May God keep him happy.

783
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,791
Mother wants you to consume poison and die.

784
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:10,666
What?

785
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,625
No, mother. I am just joking.

786
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:14,666
Fine.

787
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,041
Send her photo as soon as you are free.

788
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:18,333
Okay, mother. I will send it.

789
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:23,125
Take care of yourself. Okay, bye. Love you.

790
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,041
What happened? - Mother wants my wife's photograph.

791
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:27,041
Then send it. Send any one of the three's photo.

792
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,833
A few days ago, father had called.

793
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,291
He said he wanted my wife's photo.

794
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,625
The problem is, I don't remember whose photo I had sent him.

795
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:33,500
So what difference does it make?

796
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,083
Anyway your parents stay separately.

797
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,416
They got divorced 15 years ago.

798
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,041
Send anyone's photograph. It won't make a difference.

799
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:40,833
Whose shall I send? Anjali or Juhi?

800
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,500
Simran is too much for a village...

801
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,666
Send Juhi's.

802
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,666
I should send Juhi's? Mother will like her.

803
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:58,125
Excuse me.

804
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:02,125
Your cap.

805
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,083
Your cap. - Thank you so much.

806
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,958
You are welcome.

807
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,916
I see you cycling here every day.

808
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:12,416
Oh yeah. And I see you jogging.

809
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,791
Right.

810
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:15,958
Would you like to have some juice?

811
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,041
Yeah, sure. Come. - Let's go.

812
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,625
By the way, where do you stay?

813
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:20,875
Cocktail Tower.

814
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,000
No ways! Really?

815
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,458
I too stay at Cocktail Tower.

816
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,708
Shut up! Which floor! - Which floor!

817
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,083
Fourth floor. - I live on the eighth floor.

818
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,250
We stay in the same building and we met each other only today.

819
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,416
I know. Actually my husband says...

820
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:37,041
"In such big societies everyone is busy doing their own thing."

821
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,500
"No one disturbs anyone."

822
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,458
My husband too says the same thing. - Really?

823
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,708
Our husbands think alike.

824
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,625
Then we should get them together some day.

825
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,916
Now that we have met, they too will have to meet.

826
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,375
Right. - What will you have?

827
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:49,833
I always have Indian gooseberry juice.

828
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,500
One watermelon juice and one Indian gooseberry juice.

829
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,458
Sorry, madam. The Indian gooseberry juice just got over.

830
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:58,000
I have just one glass left. And she has ordered for it.

831
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,083
You can have it.

832
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,375
I will have something else.

833
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:01,583
No, it's okay. Really.

834
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,458
I just heard you saying that you always have that one.

835
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:05,541
Excuse me. - Yes?

836
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:06,916
One orange juice, please.

837
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,791
Give this one to her. - Okay, madam.

838
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,375
Oh my God.

839
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,083
It feels so good to talk to both of you. - Right?

840
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:15,875
I wish we have met sooner.

841
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,333
I get so bored at home.

842
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,041
I am facing the same problem.

843
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,625
You know, same here.

844
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,291
But I have joined a ladies' club.

845
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:27,458
In fact, our club is having an annual function next week.

846
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,208
It is going to be a very big event.

847
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:30,500
I am telling you, you should join it.

848
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,750
You two should join it. We will have a lot of fun.

849
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:33,833
It will help us kill some time.

850
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,458
And we will also get a chance to meet each other.

851
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:37,458
Not a bad idea. - Yeah, actually.

852
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,458
By the way... - Simran.

853
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:45,750
Juhi. - I am Anjali.

854
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,500
Sweetheart, why don't you go and do it in the balcony?

855
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,500
Okay.

856
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:05,458
Oh God.

857
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,458
Listen...

858
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:09,291
Yes?

859
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:12,916
How come your underwear fell from upstairs?

860
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,041
Upstairs?

861
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,375
Yes, it fell from one of the floors above ours.

862
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,500
How is that possible?

863
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,208
That's what even I am wondering...

864
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,458
How can your underwear fall from someone else's house?

865
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,458
I am not the only one in this building wearing underwear of this brand.

866
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:26,416
Someone else too can wear one of the same brand.

867
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:27,583
Yes, I know.

868
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:30,708
That's why I embroider a star on all your underwears.

869
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,333
What?

870
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,500
Here, look at this.

871
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,458
Why did you have to show your talent on the underwear?

872
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:38,583
Forget that.

873
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,333
First tell me how did it fell from one of the floors above ours?

874
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,000
What do I know? You should have been more careful.

875
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,041
You remember your father's death anniversary...

876
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,833
But you don't know where your husband's underwear keeps wandering.

877
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,125
Father's death anniversary? - Yes.

878
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,833
Whose father's death anniversary? - Whose...?

879
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,916
If you had one, you would have remembered, right?

880
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,375
You want to play with the kids.

881
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:53,875
You don't know where the underwear has been playing...

882
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:54,583
And you want to play with the kids.

883
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:55,875
What are you saying?

884
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:56,833
"What are you saying?"

885
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:00,833
Madam...

886
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,166
Madam, my sir's underwear had fallen down.

887
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,375
This underwear belongs to the owner of this house.

888
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:06,583
No, it belongs to my sir.

889
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,166
Hey, won't I recognize my husband's underwear?

890
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,416
And won't I recognize my sir's underwear?

891
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,458
I am the one who always removes it.

892
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:14,458
What?

893
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:15,583
I mean I wash it and keep it for drying.

894
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,208
So I am the one who will remove it, right?

895
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,375
Today as usual, I was removing it but it fell down.

896
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,458
Now give it back. - I told you, it belongs to my husband.

897
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,166
Why are you looking the other way?

898
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,041
Tell her whose underwear it is.

899
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,375
Tell her.

900
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,625
Sir! - What sir?

901
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:31,500
It is mine.

902
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,375
Yes, it is yours.

903
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,916
It's mine, and I have taken it. Now go away from here.

904
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,250
But sometimes you...

905
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,250
Why sometimes? I wear it every day.

906
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,500
Have you ever seen me without an underwear?

907
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,166
Oh God.

908
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:41,416
Why God? It's my underwear. I am taking it.

909
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,416
Now go away from here. Go.

910
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,166
How did this happen?

911
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:46,083
Oh Lord.

912
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,500
She ruined my mood so early in the morning.

913
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,416
Go and get a cup of coffee for me.

914
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:53,416
Go.

915
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,291
How do I tell her?

916
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,750
Thank you so much, sister-in-law.

917
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,500
You took such good care of my underwear.

918
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,041
Give my underwear to Ram.

919
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:02,583
I mean give my regards to Ram.

920
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,000
Coffee? No.

921
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,041
Oh, you have already made it?

922
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:09,041
Fine, then I will have some.

923
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:11,250
She is stupid.

924
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,916
She doesn't recognize her employer's underwear.

925
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:14,583
She is just his maid, not his wife.

926
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:15,416
True.

927
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,125
But I still don't understand...

928
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,333
How did your underwear fell from one of the floors above ours?

929
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,125
Like it fell from above... some day it must have fallen down from here.

930
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:23,833
And this stupid maid must've thought it's her employer's...

931
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,250
And took it upstairs with her.

932
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,166
Again if falls down, something similar will happen. Up and down, this is life.

933
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,166
Don't try to think about that. Think about this. Look at this.

934
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,500
The marital fast. Heavy discount.

935
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,166
Wow, discount.

936
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:34,750
You will come with me for shopping?

937
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,166
Definitely. - Awesome.

938
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,458
I will buy four new underwears for you.

939
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,958
Sure. - Throw this one away.

940
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:45,208
I wonder who all must have worn it. Disgusting.

941
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:46,583
When did sir go downstairs?

942
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,041
Champa?

943
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:49,916
What happened? Why do you look so baffled?

944
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:51,750
Mr. Karan, I just don't understand.

945
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,250
What is it that you don't understand?

946
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,083
Look, I was removing the clothes from the balcony.

947
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,166
Sir's underwear fell Slipped from hands.

948
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,291
I saw it landing on the sixth floor. Okay?

949
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:05,500
When I went down there, sir was already there.

950
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,625
He was already there? - Yes.

951
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,750
Champa, he was bound to be there. Have you studied science?

952
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:10,833
I never went to school.

953
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,208
Superb. Then you will understand this even better.

954
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,541
Scientist Newton has said...

955
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,416
If you throw two things from a height...

956
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,500
The one with more weight reaches down first.

957
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,625
Now tell me what weighs more your sir or his underwear?

958
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,666
Sir. - So who will reach down first?

959
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,458
Sir. - So you are so smart.

960
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:25,958
Yet you look baffled.

961
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,000
Don't tell your madam about this. She will think that you are stupid.

962
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,666
I am not that stupid.

963
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:30,875
I know Newton.

964
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,500
I work at his place as well.

965
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,500
Yes. - Okay, bye.

966
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,750
You know, here there is an offer of buy one and get two free.

967
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:43,583
Really?

968
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,416
There are many places where you get three free.

969
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,750
Really? - Yes.

970
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,708
Here you go.

971
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:51,166
Thank God, we became friends.

972
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,375
Otherwise I would have to come for shopping alone.

973
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:54,333
Seriously.

974
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,791
By the way, this idea of yours of doing shopping was great.

975
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:59,791
And your idea of embroidering a star on the underwear was mind blowing.

976
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:00,666
Stop it.

977
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,000
Why should I stop it? When I wear a tight pants...

978
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,000
It has got imprinted on my...

979
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,958
Which floor?

980
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,958
First floor. Let's go. - Come.

981
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,875
Let's also buy a watch.

982
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:30,583
Who needs a watch, baby... when one's time is going bad?

983
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,750
I want to buy lingerie. Are you coming with me?

984
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,250
No, I want to buy some bangles.

985
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,958
Second floor. - Thanks.

986
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,083
Sweetheart listen... - Yes?

987
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,333
Nothing. Go ahead, I will go and get the trolley.

988
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:46,333
Okay? - You are just too much. Hurry up.

989
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,583
Kishan!

990
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:55,833
Juhi! What are you doing here?

991
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,333
I came here for shopping.

992
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,333
But how did you get the time to visit a mall?

993
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:02,500
I didn't get the time. I came here with my boss for some work.

994
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,875
You don't have time for your wife.

995
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,375
And you are visiting a mall with your boss?

996
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,333
Come with me, let's do some shopping.

997
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,541
Shopping... No. Let's go this way instead.

998
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:09,875
Why over there?

999
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,083
My boss is over there.

1000
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:12,500
He will get angry if he will see you with me.

1001
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,875
Is he your boss or your wife that he will get angry?

1002
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,500
Nowadays boss think that they are the wife, darling.

1003
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,958
Come, let's go there and shop.

1004
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,958
Over there, we don't have to fear anyone.

1005
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,833
Only if your office will leave you alone.

1006
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:31,958
Give it to me. Let me talk to them. I will tell them...

1007
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,000
I disconnected it.

1008
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Why is he disconnecting my call?

1009
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,541
Look, you will get Everything over here.

1010
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:41,541
Go and check it out. Go. Go. Go.

1011
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,541
Excuse me.

1012
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,250
I need your help.

1013
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:50,458
Yes?

1014
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,333
Actually, I am here to buy clothes for a newborn.

1015
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:57,416
But I have no idea what kind of clothes suit on babies.

1016
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,500
Everything suits well on babies.

1017
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,708
But just remember that the material should be soft.

1018
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,291
Money is not a problem.

1019
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,500
I have a lot of money.

1020
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,916
I just want the clothes to be good.

1021
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,833
Hold on... Look over there.

1022
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,375
That's the best brand for kids.

1023
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:19,083
I don't use credit cards. In my business we always deal with cash.

1024
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,875
I think you can't hear me properly.

1025
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,833
I mean yearning to hear... a child's laughter.

1026
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,500
I am making preparations for that.

1027
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,916
You don't understand... hold on.

1028
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:30,291
Let me call my husband.

1029
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:32,708
He will help you. Okay? Have a look around.

1030
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,708
Listen... - Yes? Are you done? Shall we leave?

1031
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:35,958
Please help him.

1032
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:38,125
I am unable to help myself and you want me to help others?

1033
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:39,791
It will take just two minutes. Please help him. - Okay.

1034
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:43,791
Thank you. - Excuse me?

1035
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:50,458
Strange. No one is ready to help me.

1036
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:51,500
Let's go. Let's go from here... - My bangles.

1037
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,875
They sell secondhand goods here. Let's go.

1038
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,458
We won't buy anything from here. - Secondhand things in a mall?

1039
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:55,791
Here it is, Mr. Gulabchand.

1040
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:59,791
Please check it.

1041
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:05,708
Can you see properly?

1042
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,291
Are we doing shopping or jogging? - Let's go.

1043
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,708
I can see everything very clearly.

1044
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,708
I can see everything really very clearly.

1045
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:21,541
I will get into trouble if my boss spots me.

1046
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:24,416
Oh no.

1047
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,500
What's he doing over here?

1048
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,875
What happened?

1049
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,458
I'll go and drink some water, okay?

1050
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,708
Hey...

1051
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:36,125
Okay. So he is his boss.

1052
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,833
Who was that guy with you?

1053
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:40,083
He was my husband.

1054
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,541
Husband? - He brought his wife here for shopping.

1055
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:43,750
Do you have a problem with that?

1056
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,166
No, I don't have any problem.

1057
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,000
But you should stay happy, dear.

1058
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,291
How can I be happy?

1059
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,000
He doesn't come home for two days at a time because of you.

1060
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:50,791
Because of me?

1061
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,000
You have made one man in-charge of four offices.

1062
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,791
I... - And then you also ask him to accompany you to a mall.

1063
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:55,625
When did I...

1064
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,291
You should come here with your wife for shopping...

1065
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:58,625
And not my husband.

1066
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,416
But... - Are you gay?

1067
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:03,250
I have a daughter. - Move aside.

1068
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,500
Fraud.

1069
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,666
He is already married.

1070
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,291
And he wants to marry my daughter as well.

1071
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:11,291
Sorry, sister.

1072
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,833
Sister! - Anjali!

1073
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,916
Where were you? - Where was I?

1074
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:17,083
Where were you? - You have been calling me.

1075
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:18,875
I have been disconnecting your calls. Where have you been?

1076
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,458
I have been looking for you.

1077
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:21,625
You had gone to take a trolley, right?

1078
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,375
I found a tractor instead... I met my boss up there.

1079
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,291
He made me go crazy.

1080
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,333
Your boss? - Yes.

1081
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,125
He followed you here? - Yes.

1082
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,125
And if he sees us here, he will take me back to office.

1083
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:30,458
Let's get out of here, quickly.

1084
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,750
Are we shopping or running?

1085
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,458
The discounts will get over.

1086
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,250
I am so dead.

1087
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,458
He will not leave me alone here either.

1088
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:42,583
Oh, so he is your boss.

1089
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,958
He has made our lives miserable.

1090
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:46,541
I will teach him a lesson.

1091
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:50,250
Who was the guy who was just talking to you?

1092
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,708
He was my husband. - Husband?

1093
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,375
Do you have a problem with that?

1094
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,875
No, I don't have any problem.

1095
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,750
But you are going to have a problem.

1096
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,291
He has two...

1097
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:01,125
Not two, he is handling four offices for you.

1098
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,000
Because of you he doesn't get any time to spend with me.

1099
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,625
We have a crib at home but no child.

1100
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,666
Crib? Child?

1101
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:13,166
I am... - You are his boss. But I am his wife.

1102
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,708
Let me warn you, tomorrow we celebrate the marital fast day.

1103
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,125
If you don't send him home before the moon rises..

1104
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,750
.. then I'll be your worst enemy.

1105
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,416
Got it? Move aside now!

1106
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:26,708
The first one doesn't know that he already has a second one.

1107
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:33,666
And the second one isn't aware of the first one's existence.

1108
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,458
You!

1109
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,875
What are you doing over here?

1110
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,708
Surprise!

1111
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,541
You give a lot of surprises.

1112
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,250
Now I can give only what I get, darling.

1113
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,916
Look what I bought for you. How is this?

1114
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:45,958
Is this of my size?

1115
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,666
Size? It will fit someone or the other.

1116
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:48,833
Look at the color, baby. Look at the color.

1117
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:49,875
How's the color?

1118
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,458
Forget that. Come with me.

1119
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,375
Let me show you what I have selected.

1120
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:57,000
Come with me.

1121
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,000
Stay here. I will be right back.

1122
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,791
Where did that scoundrel go?

1123
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,791
He was here just a moment ago.

1124
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,083
I didn't do anything.

1125
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,666
I didn't do anything.

1126
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,708
I didn't do anything.

1127
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,625
This girl pulled me inside.

1128
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:32,875
What do you mean by pulled you?

1129
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:35,583
My husband was standing here.

1130
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,333
So he is your husband as well?

1131
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:38,750
What do you mean by yours as well?

1132
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,708
Excuse me... what do you want, sir?

1133
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:42,791
Oxygen.

1134
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,125
Then why are looking for it over here?

1135
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:48,125
Go outside.

1136
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,708
Three wives?

1137
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,666
Instead of marrying such a boy, I'll be happy..

1138
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,291
..if my daughter stays Unmarried all her life.

1139
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,625
Where is he? Let me get hold of him...

1140
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:09,416
He will spend the marital fast day in prison.

1141
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,375
No. No, dear.

1142
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:14,791
Okay, take it.

1143
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:15,833
May I help you, ma'am?

1144
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,083
Yeah, please. - Yeah. No problem.

1145
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:18,458
Thank you. Thank you so much. - No problem.

1146
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,458
I will help you take this outside.

1147
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:26,541
Hello.

1148
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:27,750
When is her birthday?

1149
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,250
Actually, we came shopping for her birthday.

1150
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,375
Fourth wife?

1151
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:31,875
That too with a child?

1152
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:33,416
She will cut the cake today.

1153
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:34,583
Stop. Stop.

1154
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,666
Stop. Stop.

1155
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,291
She too is your wife, right?

1156
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,375
Excuse me. He is not my husband.

1157
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:41,625
He is just helping me.

1158
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,833
You shouldn't have told the truth.

1159
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,000
You should have lied like the other three did.

1160
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,666
The other three girls lied because I asked them to...

1161
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,291
Together we fooled him.

1162
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:51,708
You ruined it for me.

1163
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,833
Come, let me help you get outside. April fool.

1164
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:54,916
You...

1165
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:58,125
Mind blowing.

1166
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:01,416
April fool?

1167
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:04,375
Good that he fooled you.

1168
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,291
But...

1169
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,458
You are suspicious about him, right? That's why he did this to you.

1170
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,583
But... in front of everyone in the mall... - But what?

1171
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:15,208
How could you even think that one man can marry three times?

1172
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:20,291
Stop laughing. Please. Stop laughing. Stop laughing.

1173
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,750
The boy who can make an April fool of me in the month of October...

1174
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,166
He can do anything.

1175
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:27,875
Stop laughing...

1176
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:31,875
Stop laughing.

1177
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:55,000
I am expressing my sorrow and you are dancing?

1178
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,208
Sit down.

1179
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:01,416
Sit.

1180
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:04,875
You know what happened today?

1181
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:08,291
All the three stumps where balled away, boss.

1182
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:12,500
My three wives fought with Deepika's father.

1183
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,833
But you know, your brother still didn't get stumped out.

1184
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:22,416
I took the fourth one in front of him and said April fool.

1185
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:25,000
Brother, you are sloshed.

1186
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,916
So far I just have three.

1187
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,583
The fourth one is yet to come, my brother.

1188
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:34,333
Fourth is pending.

1189
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,416
You know everything.

1190
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:40,541
But fourth is not actually fourth.

1191
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,083
She is the first.

1192
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,458
You know everything.

1193
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,208
She met me first.

1194
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:49,916
She loved me first.

1195
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:54,166
She wanted to marry me first.

1196
01:00:54,666 --> 01:01:02,416
But before we marry... I was buried.

1197
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:06,250
You know everything.

1198
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,000
I met with three accidents, got three wives.

1199
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,958
And not in a very big gap.

1200
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,666
One after the other, boss. One after the other.

1201
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:19,958
I was attacked thrice.

1202
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:24,666
The earth moved away from below my feet.

1203
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,875
But I am still standing.

1204
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,500
Do you understand?

1205
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,458
You know everything.

1206
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:35,666
I understand, my brother.

1207
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:40,750
What do you understand?

1208
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,958
What do you understand?

1209
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,083
Do you understand what happens when Anjali changes..

1210
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:50,833
..the shirt Simran had made me wear?

1211
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:56,125
Do you understand what happens I address Juhi as Anjali?

1212
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:58,250
He says he understands.

1213
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,208
He understands.

1214
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:06,875
Have you ever seen a star embroidered on an underwear?

1215
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:12,375
She makes such a big star with a thick thread on my underwear.

1216
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,708
I cannot tell the second one that what is hurting me...

1217
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:19,833
Because it has been made by the first one.

1218
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,625
Do you understand?

1219
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,708
When my three wives affectionately feed me, I love that.

1220
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:29,375
It's love, emotions.

1221
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,375
But...

1222
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:36,375
Do you understand the motions caused because of those emotions?

1223
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:45,000
You only understand Newton.

1224
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,166
Call your Newton here.

1225
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:50,958
Call him here. Forget three, get him married just twice...

1226
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:57,583
You can change my name if your Newton won't take a u-turn.

1227
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,500
He understands.

1228
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,125
Tomorrow is the marital fast day.

1229
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:08,083
All my three wives have said that they want me before..

1230
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,375
..them when the moon rises.

1231
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,541
Face to face.

1232
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,458
Ask... ask your uncle.. what is his name?

1233
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:23,333
Ask Newton, does he have any formula...

1234
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:31,875
Is there any idea to produce one man at three places at the same time?

1235
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:35,125
Is there any science?

1236
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,875
He understands.

1237
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:41,916
Man...

1238
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,166
You know...

1239
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:47,875
You know...

1240
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:51,875
What do you know?

1241
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,333
But You know everything, Boss.

1242
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:59,500
You got me trapped in three marriages.

1243
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,541
Now You are the one who will get me out of this mess.

1244
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:05,208
And You are the one who will help the moon rise.

1245
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,250
And You are the one who will help me rise out of this mess.

1246
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,291
Otherwise, I will be dead, Boss.

1247
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:10,750
Please save me.

1248
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,083
I am like your younger brother.

1249
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,958
The one up above...

1250
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,875
Hello?

1251
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,875
Hello!!

1252
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,000
All across the country married woman..

1253
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,958
..are fasting for their husband's long life.

1254
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,208
Woman got all decked up and are ready in the morning itself.

1255
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,458
And as the dusk arrives..

1256
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,833
..they all have either gone to the terrace or are near the windows.

1257
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,166
Now they are waiting for the moon to rise.

1258
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:51,166
The moon rise is expected in another half an hour.

1259
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,916
There is only half an hour left for the moon to rise.

1260
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,541
How will you show all three, your face at the same time?

1261
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:06,541
Have you thought of something?

1262
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,500
I have.

1263
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,500
The moon will be seen and so will I.

1264
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:24,458
Hello?

1265
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,250
You are waiting for me, right?

1266
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,375
But I am not coming.

1267
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:28,291
What? - What?

1268
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,750
Your husband does everything differently, sweetheart.

1269
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,333
As we got married in a different manner...

1270
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,750
We should end your fast also in a different way.

1271
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,791
The name you are hiding in your palm...

1272
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:40,041
Go and look out from the balcony...

1273
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:44,041
He has brought the moon in this palm for you..

1274
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,375
Listen...

1275
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,208
Where can I find Shivram Kishan?

1276
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:31,833
Go straight, on the right there is a temple.

1277
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:32,541
You will find them there.

1278
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:36,375
Go and call him here. Tell him his father is here.

1279
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,083
I should call the Gods?

1280
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:39,750
Are you drunk?

1281
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,208
You are joking with a senior citizen?

1282
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,208
Shivram Kishan is my son's name. - Oh.

1283
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:46,791
Listen...

1284
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,041
I don't like drinking.

1285
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:51,166
I drink to drown my sorrows.

1286
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:52,500
This is what Rishi Kapoor said.

1287
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,375
Oh no, Rishi Kapoor didn't say that.

1288
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:55,708
He was the hero of the film.

1289
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,208
Anand Bakshi said it.

1290
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:00,916
I listen to the radio 24/7. I know everything.

1291
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:04,583
You remember the names of the people in the film industry.

1292
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:05,500
Uncle...

1293
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,625
You are a watchman. - Why did he come here?

1294
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,916
You should know who all stay in this building.

1295
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:11,916
Uncle...

1296
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,375
Sorry.

1297
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:15,083
Karan!

1298
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:16,291
I seek your blessings.

1299
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,833
God bless you.

1300
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,416
How are you?

1301
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,333
I am absolutely fine.

1302
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:24,666
Tell me where in this labyrinth does our Bholu stay?

1303
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,708
Come with me.

1304
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:29,458
What bring you here all of a sudden?

1305
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,000
It's not sudden, son.

1306
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,833
I've been planning to meet my son and his wife since a long time.

1307
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,208
So I came here today.

1308
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:36,500
Come on, quickly take me to their house.

1309
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,708
House? Which house?

1310
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,958
I mean which wife's photo had he sent you?

1311
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:42,333
Which wife?

1312
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:43,791
Does he have many?

1313
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:47,208
No. I mean which photo of his wife did he send you?

1314
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,000
Actually, the security of this place is very tight.

1315
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,291
You have to show the owner's photo at the lift.

1316
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:55,750
Only then does it stop at that floor.

1317
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,041
I am telling the truth.

1318
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,041
Strange.

1319
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,333
This is the photo he has sent me.

1320
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:08,250
Oh, sixth floor.

1321
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:12,250
Come with me. Come, let's go.

1322
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:23,291
Even the army doesn't have such tight security.

1323
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,208
This is how it is here.

1324
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:27,958
Son, will I need to show the photo every day?

1325
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:31,541
No. Once it is logged into the system, I mean stored...

1326
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,166
You just have to come and press on the 6th floor button..

1327
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,666
If you press any other button, it will ring the alarm.

1328
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:41,041
Oh. Fine.

1329
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:42,500
We have reached.

1330
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,500
Your Bholu stays here. And your nave daughter-in-law.

1331
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,791
From Kumar Shivram Kishan to Ram Kumar?

1332
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:52,416
People make a big name in the city and he has cut his name short.

1333
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:56,416
That's because he does big things, uncle.

1334
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,333
Yes, Karan?

1335
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:14,541
Your father is here.

1336
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,083
Father is here? Where is he?

1337
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:18,250
He is here. - Here where?

1338
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,375
Here, at your house, on the sixth floor.

1339
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:24,416
What? Father has come from the village. Mother...

1340
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:26,416
Not your mother, your father is here.

1341
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:27,791
Mother too is here.

1342
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:31,500
She is standing right before me.

1343
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,500
What do I do now?

1344
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,625
What will you do?

1345
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:34,833
Do one thing...

1346
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,500
You had sent her Juhi's photo, right?

1347
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Quickly take her to the fourth floor.

1348
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,833
Then we will decide what we should do.

1349
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,750
I... will meet you in some time. Okay?

1350
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,500
Vishal, how do I know where you can find fried bread.

1351
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,458
Mother!

1352
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:49,541
Mother!

1353
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:51,625
I seek your blessing. - My Bholu!

1354
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:54,166
Always be happy, son.

1355
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,916
You have gone fat.

1356
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,083
Fat? - Yes.

1357
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,500
You are the first mother in this world to call her child fat.

1358
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,500
Usually all mothers say, "You have lost weight."

1359
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,041
Son, I thought I should say something different as I am in the city.

1360
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,875
Otherwise you will think that your mother is orthodox.

1361
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:12,750
Okay. But, why did you come here without informing me?

1362
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,083
Why? Did you feel bad? - Yes, of course.

1363
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,791
No, I mean if you would have informed me I would have sent one or two...

1364
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,833
Sent one or two... where? Why? How?

1365
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:21,791
What do you mean? - My office staff.

1366
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:23,166
To receive you.

1367
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:26,833
I know how busy you are. - Yes, mother.

1368
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:28,791
That's why I came here without informing you.

1369
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,083
Come on, introduce me to your wife.

1370
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,500
You did the right thing. - Come on, let's go.

1371
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,083
You did the right thing, mother.

1372
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:35,416
Come...

1373
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:38,500
It's a big house.

1374
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,916
Juhi, look who is here.

1375
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,166
Why did you bring her? Couldn't you find anyone younger?

1376
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,500
Younger? - Yes.

1377
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,083
What work will a maid of this age be able to do?

1378
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,125
Maid?

1379
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,250
Not a maid, she is my mother. Your mother-in-law.

1380
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:53,166
Come here and seek her blessings.

1381
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,458
Mother! I am sorry.

1382
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:56,958
I am sorry, mother. - God bless you, dear.

1383
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:58,458
God bless you.

1384
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:03,833
I know females in the city only wait for their maids.

1385
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:07,458
But dear, mothers and sisters too pay a visit sometimes.

1386
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,375
Wow. Well said, mother. You are amazing.

1387
01:16:09,875 --> 01:16:10,166
Shut up.

1388
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,500
Go and keep my bags inside.

1389
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,125
But why didn't you inform us that you are coming here?

1390
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,750
From where I am, we only inform when someone leaves...

1391
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,708
Not when someone arrives.

1392
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,291
Father didn't come with you?

1393
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:25,291
Your father left 15 years ago.

1394
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:26,750
I am so sorry, mother.

1395
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,375
I didn't know that father is no longer.. - He is alive.

1396
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:30,791
He is very much alive.

1397
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:33,000
And he is having a lot of fun too.

1398
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:40,208
After he married a fair-skinned female from Kashmir we parted ways.

1399
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:43,375
But father, why did you and mother separate?

1400
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,250
Now what do I say, dear?

1401
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,375
A breeze blew and a flower fell off from the branch...

1402
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:53,625
It's either the fault of the breeze nor of the branch.

1403
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:54,958
I didn't get you.

1404
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,625
Let me explain.

1405
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,500
The thing is, uncle liked to recite poetry when he was in the army.

1406
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,625
The army man part of him has retired but the poet in him is still active.

1407
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,541
This was a poetry?

1408
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,375
Yes.

1409
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,500
Father, you should stop reciting poetries.

1410
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,875
I am sure mother will come back to you.

1411
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:14,750
When are you giving me "the good news"?

1412
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,625
Mother, I will go and meet Karan.

1413
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,666
Okay. - Mother, Karan will give you "the good news."

1414
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,458
He spends me time with him than with me.

1415
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,625
Did you hear her taunt?

1416
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,708
Son, your father was in the army.

1417
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:30,708
Yet he spared enough time to make it possible for me to see your face.

1418
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,625
Mother, you have started talking about children as soon as you came.

1419
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:36,041
Sit, relax. Enjoy your breakfast. I will back in a jiffy. Okay?

1420
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:38,416
He has not one but four offices, uncle.

1421
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,458
Why does he need four offices?

1422
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:44,083
Why doesn't he combine all four and get them under one roof?

1423
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,791
Have you studied science, uncle?

1424
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:46,666
No.

1425
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:49,875
Superb. Then you will understand this even better.

1426
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:55,458
When sulfate, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen are filled into a cylinder...

1427
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,166
It doesn't just burn a stove but the entire house.

1428
01:17:57,666 --> 01:18:00,166
It causes a blast.

1429
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,833
Are you married?

1430
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:02,625
No.

1431
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,125
Then you will understand this even better.

1432
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:08,500
A house runs on home-science and not science.

1433
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,708
Okay, uncle.

1434
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:11,500
Father, when did you arrive?

1435
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,875
I seek your blessings.

1436
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:17,500
Father! Where are you these days?

1437
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,958
Your wife told me that you don't come home at night.

1438
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,500
Are you a businessman or a watchman?

1439
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,875
What do I do? I have a lot of work to do.

1440
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:23,791
I don't get the time.

1441
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,250
You need to balance your work and your home life.

1442
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,666
Because a house.. - Runs on home-science and not science.

1443
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:30,750
Heard that?

1444
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,500
He is not even married and yet he understands.

1445
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,083
You too should understand.

1446
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,791
You should spend some time with your wife as well.

1447
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:38,250
You should keep her happy.

1448
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,500
I keep her happy. Now do you want me to crack jokes to her?

1449
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,500
You keep me happy?

1450
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,833
Tell me, what's so special about tomorrow?

1451
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,000
Tomorrow?

1452
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,000
Forget whatever it is.

1453
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,250
Tomorrow we are going to give father a tour of Mumbai.

1454
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,083
He is leaving the day after tomorrow.

1455
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,208
Who said I am leaving? I have just come here.

1456
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:52,166
I want to meet my old friends.

1457
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:54,333
I am not going anywhere for another 20 days.

1458
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,666
Dear, you were saying something, right?

1459
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:57,583
What's so special about tomorrow?

1460
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,625
Father, tomorrow is my birthday.

1461
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:03,416
Really? - Did you remember?

1462
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:04,583
Yes, of course.

1463
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,958
A man can lose his memory but never forget his wife's birthday.

1464
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,791
Tomorrow I will celebrate your birthday in such a way...

1465
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,791
You will feel as if it's your first birthday.

1466
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:19,708
Bholu, have you made all the arrangements?

1467
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:20,625
Yes, father. I am on it.

1468
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,833
Okay, listen, I am going to the market...

1469
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,500
To buy a gift for Anjali.

1470
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,875
Don't cut the cake until I come back. - Okay.

1471
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:33,708
Sweetheart, I must say... you don't look like 35 years old.

1472
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,750
Hey! Shut up! I am only 26.

1473
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:37,500
Heard that?

1474
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,833
If I had asked a direct question she would have said 21.

1475
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:43,500
Now she at least mentioned somewhere close to her real age.

1476
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,500
Karan, check who is at the door.

1477
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:59,125
Doomed!

1478
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,416
Simran and Juhi.

1479
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:04,125
What?

1480
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,416
Your two wives have come to meet the third one.

1481
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:07,875
Why have they come to meet her?

1482
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:11,625
What do I know?

1483
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,083
Open the door. Someone is ringing the bell.

1484
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:14,875
It's the kids, darling.

1485
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,208
They are just ringing the bell and running away. - Yes.

1486
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:17,583
I don't think it's the kids, my friends must be here.

1487
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:18,833
I have invited them as well.

1488
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:20,541
I'll go and answer the door. - Friends?

1489
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:23,416
When did they become friends?

1490
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:25,958
I am so dead.

1491
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,208
Yes, actually.

1492
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:29,000
Hi! - Hi!

1493
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,916
Hi Juhi! Hi Simran!

1494
01:20:31,416 --> 01:20:32,500
I was waiting for you two. - I am hiding myself.

1495
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
What are you doing? - Happy birthday.

1496
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,500
There is no place to hide here. - Many many happy returns of the day.

1497
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,916
Thank you so much.

1498
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,833
Move aside, Karan. - Why didn't you tell us beforehand?

1499
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,333
We would have brought a gift for you.

1500
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:42,791
Your husbands didn't accompany you?

1501
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:44,541
My husband is on a night duty.

1502
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:45,666
Mine too.

1503
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:47,250
Luckily my husband is at home today.

1504
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,166
He is on my duty today. - Back off.

1505
01:20:49,666 --> 01:20:50,583
Come, let me introduce you to my husband.

1506
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:51,375
Let's go.

1507
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,750
I am going to jump down. - Have you lost your mind? You will die.

1508
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,750
I just got lucky.

1509
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,708
What have you... - Let me explain.

1510
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:13,166
To you, to you and to you too.

1511
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:15,500
And me as well. You have ruined everyone's cake.

1512
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,541
And your face is also completely unrecognizable

1513
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,958
Really?

1514
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:24,291
Happy birthday to you.

1515
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,416
What's wrong with your voice?

1516
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,416
I swallowed the candle along with the cake.

1517
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,083
The candle keeps flickering inside.

1518
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,083
I cannot speak properly.

1519
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:33,916
But why did you put your face on the cake?

1520
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:36,166
It's your birthday. Everybody would have applied cake on your face.

1521
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:38,916
I thought I should apply it on mine instead.

1522
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:41,541
You are just too much. Go and quickly wash your face.

1523
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:42,916
Then I will introduce you to them.

1524
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,958
No. Today is your birthday. This is your birthday cake.

1525
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,583
I will stay this way all day long.

1526
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,166
Let me meet your friends.

1527
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:50,666
Hello, Simran. Hello, Juhi.

1528
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,125
Hi. - Hello.

1529
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:58,208
Wait a minute. How do you know their names?

1530
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,291
Sister-in-law, you took their names when you met them at the door.

1531
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:02,083
Oh.

1532
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,750
The cake is on my face and not inside my ears.

1533
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,250
Karan, what are you doing over here?

1534
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,625
I.. sister-in-law, I am a lawyer. I handle all the legal matters.

1535
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:11,750
Sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.

1536
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:12,833
And sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.

1537
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,125
All married female in this building are my sisters-in-law.

1538
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,500
I have 32 sisters-in-law and 30 brothers.

1539
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,500
Why are there 2 less brothers?

1540
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,541
There are two extra sisters-in-law.

1541
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:18,750
Idiot!

1542
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,583
Have you come here to celebrate my wife's birthday or..

1543
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:22,875
..count your brothers and sisters-in-law?

1544
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,500
Happy birthday to you.

1545
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,458
Thank you, sweetheart. Come, let's click a selfie.

1546
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:29,541
Superb idea.

1547
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:32,416
I too will click a selfie with my hubby on my birthday.

1548
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,958
Go ahead, click it. I didn't stop you.

1549
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,833
With you? - Yes.

1550
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:41,666
All husbands look the same when they have cake on their face.

1551
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,500
My God, your husband is so funny.

1552
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,333
I know. - I think we all need a photo.

1553
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,916
Yes. - Let's take a selfie. Come. - Yeah.

1554
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:48,875
Come, my sisters-in-law.

1555
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:49,833
Come, come.

1556
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,375
I'll show this photo to everyone at the club's function tomorrow.

1557
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:56,375
Smile!

1558
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:18,541
Rukmani?

1559
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:26,583
You?

1560
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,916
I am seeing you after ages.

1561
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:34,250
How are you?

1562
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,500
See for yourself...

1563
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,458
How incomplete your soldier is without you.

1564
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,875
You had brought a fair-skinned female from Kashmir, right?

1565
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:44,500
I fell in love with her because I missed you, Rukmani.

1566
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,041
I could see your face in hers.

1567
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:51,916
I was a fool not to be able to see your face in a doctor or an engineer's face.

1568
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:53,958
And I kept waiting for you.

1569
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:56,166
You don't know...

1570
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:58,791
The day that female came before me...

1571
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:01,208
That night the temperature had gone below zero.

1572
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:05,458
Even if the temperature falls, a person resistance shouldn't.

1573
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,041
Please forget about it.

1574
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,375
Please forgive me.

1575
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,791
That girl from Kashmir passed away after five years.

1576
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,833
That was bound to happen.

1577
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:20,458
Not everyone can survive a soldier's attitude.

1578
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:23,250
You are just too much.

1579
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,958
You know that our Bholu got married?

1580
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,250
Yes, my Bholu's wife is so sweet.

1581
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,000
She is really well-cultured.

1582
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,291
She takes good care of me.

1583
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:37,583
She takes such good care of me. - Of me as well..

1584
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:40,291
When did you meet her? I am staying with her.

1585
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:42,000
Who are you staying with?

1586
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,041
She is with me. - What are you saying?

1587
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:46,000
On which floor are you staying? - On the fourth floor.

1588
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,250
And I am on the sixth.

1589
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,166
This means... this means..!

1590
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,750
Your son is just like you.

1591
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,125
He too got married twice.

1592
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:56,500
Today it's either him or me.

1593
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,875
Wait, Rukmani.

1594
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:00,583
I have seen happiness in my daughter-in-law's eyes...

1595
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:03,041
And loyalty in my son's eyes.

1596
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:04,625
I too noticed that.

1597
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,333
We will talk to him.

1598
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:09,625
But until then, we will let things be as they are.

1599
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:13,125
We will meet the mornings and evenings, here, in the garden.

1600
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,666
Will you come to meet me, Rukmani?

1601
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:18,916
I have been waiting for you since the past 15 years.

1602
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:22,916
And still you ask me that question.

1603
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:32,666
Father?

1604
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:35,500
Mother?

1605
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,416
What happened? Why did you two stop?

1606
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:38,625
Hurry up.

1607
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:42,625
If we are late, the performance in the club will begin.

1608
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:09,541
That's my friend.

1609
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:42,333
Fantastic!

1610
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,208
Come on, let's go meet her. Let's go.

1611
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:45,750
Sure.

1612
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,041
Hi!

1613
01:28:48,541 --> 01:28:51,041
Superb performance Deepika. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

1614
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:52,916
Meet my friends, Anjali and Juhi.

1615
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:53,666
Hi. - Hi.

1616
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:55,416
We loved your performance.

1617
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,291
You were stunning. - Thank you.

1618
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,833
Thank you isn't enough.

1619
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,250
You will have to come to my place for tea.

1620
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,791
Sure. - And have lunch at my place.

1621
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:03,208
And dinner at my place.

1622
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:04,875
We three stay in the same building.

1623
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,625
Oh wow. In the same building?

1624
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:07,583
So cool.

1625
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:08,708
So tell us, when are you coming?

1626
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,750
Actually, I am soon going to get married.

1627
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,500
I will come with my husband.

1628
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,458
Promise?

1629
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:18,125
Promise.

1630
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:20,333
Thank you.

1631
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:22,000
Give it to her. - Okay. - Thank you.

1632
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,291
You know, I always have an ice-candy from here whenever I go from here?

1633
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:27,000
It's yummy, you know.

1634
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,833
But you shouldn't consume so many calories.

1635
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:32,916
Husbands keep their arm around your waist only till its slim.

1636
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:35,125
I think you shouldn't fall in love looking only at the waist.

1637
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,208
Love should be forever.

1638
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:41,208
Like them, you know.

1639
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:46,375
My mother-in-law. - My father-in-law.

1640
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:47,041
What?

1641
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,500
They are your mother-in-law and father-in-law?

1642
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I am so sorry. I thought they are husband and wife.

1643
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,875
What is this my mother doing here, in Mumbai?

1644
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,916
And my father-in-law too.

1645
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:58,500
You are here and the brightness is back.

1646
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,500
Otherwise, the lamps were losing their luminance.

1647
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,541
At this age one should be lighting lamps in front of the photo.

1648
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:10,208
And you want to bring light back into your life.

1649
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,500
Stop your nonsense. Have you lost your mind?

1650
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,750
I am telling the truth. Your father is romancing at this age.

1651
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,041
Who will he romance with at this age?

1652
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,375
You know my friend Juhi, who stays on the fourth floor?

1653
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:23,916
He is having an affair with her mother-in-law.

1654
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,875
You mean mother and father have met?

1655
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:27,291
Mother and father?

1656
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:29,333
Our father and their mother have met?

1657
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:32,000
Yes. We saw them together twice today.

1658
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,750
The first time we saw them, They were hugging each other in the garden.

1659
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,666
And the second time at Bandstand, drinking coconut water.

1660
01:30:37,166 --> 01:30:38,750
Is it?

1661
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:42,125
One heart tells to the other.

1662
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:45,916
I have fallen in love, again.

1663
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,291
Father is back.

1664
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:49,166
Ask him where was he.

1665
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:53,708
Father...

1666
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:54,916
Where were you?

1667
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:58,500
Dear, I had gone to the army club to kill some time.

1668
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,791
Oh really? But there is no army club over here.

1669
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:02,833
Yes, there isn't.

1670
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,500
I searched hard, but I couldn't find it.

1671
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,958
And you, come inside.

1672
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:10,041
I want to discuss something very important with you.

1673
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:11,916
Can I finish a small task and then join you, father?

1674
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:15,791
Do come back. - Sure.

1675
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:18,625
Listen... why was he staring at you as if you are doing something wrong?

1676
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:20,833
This is the problem with senior citizens.

1677
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:27,000
They do something wrong and pretend as if you are doing something wrong.

1678
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,333
Just make sure that he doesn't call up mother.

1679
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,916
Mother? - Their mother... the one he is having an affair with.

1680
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:34,333
Not my mother.

1681
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,208
Yes.

1682
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:40,208
"For the first time, I have seen love in my beloved's eyes."

1683
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:51,625
Mother...

1684
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,625
You were not in the garden.

1685
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:55,166
Where were you?

1686
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:58,625
I met a lady of this building in the garden.

1687
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:00,875
I went to attend a spiritual discourse with her.

1688
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:02,625
Okay.

1689
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:05,250
You really enjoying attending a spiritual discourse, don't you?

1690
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:10,500
Dear, at this age one enjoys attending spiritual discourses.

1691
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,041
Make me a cup of tea, please.

1692
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:16,416
Should I give you coconut water instead?

1693
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:18,458
I already had coconut water.

1694
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:19,666
At the spiritual discourse?

1695
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:23,916
But the coconut water is found in the coconut.

1696
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:26,166
I think you are tired.

1697
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:30,166
Let me make tea for you instead.

1698
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:41,916
Where is mother? - Kishan, come here.

1699
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:44,041
You should send mother back to the village.

1700
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:45,583
Why? You cannot serve her anymore?

1701
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:47,416
No. You don't know.

1702
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:49,541
Mother is having an affair.

1703
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,541
What nonsense! - Honestly.

1704
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:55,000
She is romancing sixth floor's Anjali's father-in-law.

1705
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,541
Oh really?

1706
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,041
You aren't surprised. - I am surprised.

1707
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,833
A lot, from within. But what can we do?

1708
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:03,125
When someone stays away from someone for a long time...

1709
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:04,500
This happens.

1710
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,833
But this is wrong.

1711
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,500
Why? Don't you get upset when you have to spend two nights without me?

1712
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Mother got separated from father 15 years ago.

1713
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,500
It is possible that mother sees her husband in that man.

1714
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,375
Oh really?

1715
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:17,625
In how many woman do you see me? - Three.

1716
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:19,333
Two of them are married and one is still single.

1717
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:21,875
If you ask stupid questions you will get stupid replies.

1718
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:24,541
Just make sure she doesn't call up father.

1719
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:25,833
Their father.

1720
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,250
Do I have to explain everything?

1721
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:28,500
When did I ask that?

1722
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,416
But you were going to.

1723
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:32,208
You know darling, I love you.

1724
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:35,041
So I know what you are about to ask.

1725
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:36,625
I love you too.

1726
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:41,458
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.

1727
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:45,458
Okay. Okay.

1728
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:55,500
'What does he do?'

1729
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,958
'He works at a security agency, sir.'

1730
01:33:58,458 --> 01:33:59,916
'Are you sure he is the one you are going to get married to?'

1731
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:03,708
'Yes, sir.'

1732
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,625
I just spoke to Anjali. - Okay.

1733
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,041
She is coming with her husband. Let's take her along.

1734
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:11,000
I keep dreaming about having a child...

1735
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,958
Whereas you don't even have time to love your wife.

1736
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:15,375
There is a time to love, sweetheart.

1737
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:20,500
You want me to love you now, in front of everyone?

1738
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,916
Love you, sweetheart.

1739
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:23,916
Anjali?

1740
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:26,625
Strange. You just said no to love.

1741
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,208
It's a completely different feeling to love after refusing to.

1742
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:30,958
I won't let you go.

1743
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:32,500
You are so sweet.

1744
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,041
Her husband is so romantic.

1745
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:35,375
He started in the compound itself.

1746
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:36,916
So sweet.

1747
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:39,333
I pray everyone gets a husband like him.

1748
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:40,916
I am late once again.

1749
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:44,750
What lie will I say today?

1750
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,750
Sir?

1751
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,666
Champa!

1752
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:49,583
Madam!

1753
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:53,583
Who is she? - My maid.

1754
01:35:27,916 --> 01:35:31,416
It doesn't feel right.

1755
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:35,375
Now I have loved you in front of everyone because you insisted.

1756
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:36,666
What will people say if they see us like this?

1757
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:38,250
Go. Your friends must be waiting for you.

1758
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,333
Go on.

1759
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:42,250
How does he know?

1760
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,416
I sometimes don't understand what he says or does.

1761
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:47,416
Disgusting. - What happened, Champa?

1762
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:50,500
Sir, I don't understand what is going on in this society.

1763
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,791
Sir was hugging some other woman.

1764
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:55,291
And madam was watching it. And she didn't even say anything.

1765
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,500
It's nothing. - It's nothing?

1766
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,500
You say it's nothing?

1767
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,041
Now if someone else gets "the good news"...

1768
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,708
Don't tell anyone that I told you that sir was with someone else...

1769
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:06,166
Champa... Have you studied science?

1770
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:07,916
Does this too involve Newton?

1771
01:36:08,416 --> 01:36:11,166
No, this is medical science. What he was doing was..

1772
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:13,791
..called mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration system.

1773
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:14,541
What?

1774
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,375
I mean to breathe into someone else's mouth through your mouth.

1775
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:21,375
Champa, it is possible that that lady was having a problem breathing.

1776
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,333
So he was helping her.

1777
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:26,458
Sir, I know what I saw. He was hugging her.

1778
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:28,250
Now he can't go breathe into every woman's mouth, can he?

1779
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:29,958
Wouldn't he be considered characterless?

1780
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:31,250
What are you saying? - Yes.

1781
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:34,708
Instead of mouth-to-mouth he must be giving chest-to-chest science.

1782
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:37,791
Oh. Now I understood. I understood.

1783
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:40,125
Don't tell that to sister-in-law. She will think that you are stupid.

1784
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:44,583
Sir, I am not that stupid. I understand mouth-to-mouth.

1785
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:48,500
But sir, I got confused because it was chest-to-chest.

1786
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,500
Sir, will you do me a favor?

1787
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,791
Yes, Champa?

1788
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,708
Can you accompany in the lift?

1789
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:54,708
Why?

1790
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:57,541
Because sometimes I have problem breathing in the lift.

1791
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:02,166
Please come with me, sir. - Get lost.

1792
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:06,375
Yes, I do.

1793
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:07,291
Yes, Deepu?

1794
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:09,500
Kumar, dad just called me up.

1795
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,625
He was saying strange things about you.

1796
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:12,958
I fought with him.

1797
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:14,250
Really? What did he say?

1798
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:17,208
First come and meet me. And also bring Karan along.

1799
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:20,166
I want to discuss something very important.

1800
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:21,583
What? Court marriage?

1801
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:24,750
Yes, there is no other option left.

1802
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,750
My dad keeps having strange suspicions about you.

1803
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:31,250
Today, once again he said there is already someone in your life.

1804
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:32,666
Oh really?

1805
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,166
Did he say that? - Yes.

1806
01:37:35,666 --> 01:37:38,916
But I swear, Deepika. You are the only one I love.

1807
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:40,250
I know.

1808
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,000
That's why I want us to get married as soon as possible.

1809
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,708
She is right. Quietly go to the court and get married.

1810
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:49,125
It won't create a scene. And it is better for you as well.

1811
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:50,458
Try to understand.

1812
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:53,375
Of course. And I will also escape from facing any music.

1813
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,833
I mean the music played at the wedding.

1814
01:37:56,333 --> 01:37:56,625
Okay then, done.

1815
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:58,416
You come to the court with your witness. - Okay.

1816
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,208
You come to the court with your witness.

1817
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,791
I will get you two married.

1818
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:03,291
Perfect. - Cheers to that.

1819
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:07,291
Cheers.

1820
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:09,375
Oh wow.

1821
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:11,500
Somebody's looking hot today.

1822
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,250
I'm going to meet a foreign delegation that's why I am wearing a suit.

1823
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:16,541
I'm not going to get married.

1824
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,291
When did I say that you are going to get married.

1825
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:20,333
No...

1826
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:23,166
I thought when you are going through a bad phase...

1827
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:24,750
Anyone starts suspecting you for no good reason.

1828
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,791
That's why I said all that.

1829
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:28,500
Oh come on, Shiv.

1830
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,250
Your love doesn't lack anything. Why should I be suspicious of you?

1831
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,583
You mean the world to me, baby.

1832
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:37,375
Bye.

1833
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,583
Where? - Not the maid, baby. I am saying bye to you.

1834
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:40,791
I am in a little hurry.

1835
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:43,125
You can note this one down. I will settle the score tomorrow.

1836
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:44,500
Can I go now? - Okay.

1837
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,208
Thank you, baby.

1838
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:48,250
All the best. - Bye.

1839
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,666
Father, I am going to do something very important.

1840
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,875
I cannot do it without your blessing.

1841
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:56,250
Son, I met your mother.

1842
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,125
Mother? - Yes. Your mother.

1843
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,916
What's this scene about having two of them?

1844
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,833
Well father, these two... - What two?

1845
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:08,000
Two 'Laddoos' (sweets). Offer two of them Lord Hanuman.

1846
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,375
And two at the Shani temple.

1847
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:11,583
I have pledged something. - Okay, father.

1848
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:13,541
He must have prayed for that old woman.

1849
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:16,083
What else could it be?

1850
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,916
Listen... brother has sent clothes for the kids.

1851
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:20,416
Come, I will show them to you.

1852
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:24,416
I'll be right back, father.

1853
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:28,666
Kids?

1854
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:30,708
What all is he hiding?

1855
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:34,708
Where are they?

1856
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,875
Yes? - Where are you?

1857
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:44,875
You won't be able to get married if the judge leaves. Hurry up.

1858
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:48,500
Okay, Anjali. See you in the evening.

1859
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,750
Okay.

1860
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,750
Bye, father. I am going. I am getting late.

1861
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:56,500
Bye, sweetheart.

1862
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,666
Bye

1863
01:39:58,166 --> 01:40:02,041
He already has two wives, now he wants a third one?

1864
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:03,791
He is one step ahead of me.

1865
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:05,166
I am going, mother.

1866
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,666
Stop. Sit.

1867
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:10,791
What's this scene about two marriages?

1868
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:13,125
Look mother, the two...

1869
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,500
Yes, mother. I will offer two 'Laddoos'.

1870
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,041
Two to Lord Shani and two to Lord Hanuman.

1871
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:17,875
'Laddoos'? - Yes. That...

1872
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:21,041
Yes. 'Laddoos'. Yes, do offer them.

1873
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:23,333
Why are you offering 'Laddoos', mother?

1874
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,500
For the peace in this house and for him to come to his senses.

1875
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,083
Doesn't everyone need to come back to their senses, mother?

1876
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:34,541
Yes, of course. So then I will offer two for you as well.

1877
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,666
I know why she is offering 'Laddoos'.

1878
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,791
I am sure she must have prayed for that old man.

1879
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,041
Give me your blessings, mother.

1880
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:42,000
So far I have only accidentally done good deeds.

1881
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,541
This time I am going to do a good deed... Just pray that no accidents take place.

1882
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:47,208
My blessings are always with you.

1883
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,291
Just remember... never break a woman's heart.

1884
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:53,083
And never ruin a family.

1885
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:56,541
Because of this I am going to end up fulfilling 28 vows of marriage.

1886
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,791
There are 7 vows in a marriage, not 28.

1887
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,166
Yes, but for a person who loves you four-fold...

1888
01:41:01,666 --> 01:41:02,791
For him 4 times 7 is 28.

1889
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,125
What? Four?

1890
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:06,666
You heard that, mother? That's why I say...

1891
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:09,166
I pray that everyone gets a husband like him.

1892
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,333
He is. God is slowly giving it to everyone.

1893
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:12,625
See you, mother.

1894
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:13,458
Bye.

1895
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:17,458
Bye, darling. - Bye.

1896
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:21,708
Sorry, I got a little late.

1897
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:23,291
You reached at the accidental weddings on time.

1898
01:41:23,791 --> 01:41:24,166
And here when you were given a specific time, you are late.

1899
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:25,000
Forget about it now. Where is Deepika, Karan?

1900
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,791
She was here. She has gone to get her witness.

1901
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,208
We are so dead, brother.

1902
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:31,250
What happened? - Look over there.

1903
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,500
Oh damn. When did all four of them meet each other?

1904
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,750
What do I know?

1905
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,166
Do one thing... I am leaving, you handle them.

1906
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:37,208
Why do you always get me trapped?

1907
01:41:37,708 --> 01:41:38,375
Say the witness met with an accident.

1908
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:41,125
Say something. Say anything. - What will I say?

1909
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,166
No, you take care of everything over there.

1910
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:45,541
I will explain everything to them. They will understand.

1911
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:47,750
I know. I trust them. - What happened?

1912
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,333
I will call you back, brother.

1913
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:51,833
Deepika, actually... - Karan, what are you doing here?

1914
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:54,541
What are all three of you doing over here?

1915
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:55,875
Do you know each other?

1916
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,333
He stays in our building.

1917
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:59,916
Yes, and he handles our husbands' legal matters.

1918
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:02,875
Not just your husband, sister-in-law... I also save her future husband.

1919
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:06,250
I mean save his tax. It is my job.

1920
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,333
But why hasn't Kumar reached as yet?

1921
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:10,416
Actually, he just called me.

1922
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,833
His witness met with a small accident.

1923
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:13,625
What?

1924
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:16,291
And Kumar is with him at the hospital.

1925
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:18,333
But I am feeling really bad. I am really sorry.

1926
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:20,125
You have been troubled unnecessarily.

1927
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:23,041
No. What can one do when it's an emergency, right?

1928
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,708
Yeah, actually. In fact, I am happy that your boyfriend is so nice.

1929
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:30,208
He thought saving someone's life is more important than to get married.

1930
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:33,125
I pray everyone gets a husband like him.

1931
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:35,791
Of course, He will. He always does. I know.

1932
01:42:36,291 --> 01:42:39,416
I suggest, I'll take another date for your wedding, say after two days?

1933
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:41,125
Okay? Will that be fine?

1934
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:42,708
Yes. I think that's perfect.

1935
01:42:43,208 --> 01:42:45,208
We too will come here on that date. Right?

1936
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,083
Yes, absolutely. - Sure. No problem.

1937
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:49,166
Okay, Deepika. Take care. Bye.

1938
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:53,708
Bye. - Bye. - Come with me, sister-in-law. This way.

1939
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,875
Come, let's go and check.

1940
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:57,750
I think you misheard him.

1941
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,083
He is already married twice.

1942
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,125
Why would want to get married the third time?

1943
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,458
After all he is our son, and not some wild bull.

1944
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:05,166
I am telling the truth, Rukmani.

1945
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:08,583
He is here. Let's go over there and enquire.

1946
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:10,458
Mother?

1947
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:11,583
Father?

1948
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,625
What are they doing here?

1949
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:15,791
Excuse me?

1950
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:18,166
Where do couples get married?

1951
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:19,458
They are getting married?!

1952
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:20,916
They are in such a hurry!

1953
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:24,083
They fell in love yesterday and today there are in the court to get married.

1954
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:26,083
Anjali, with the speed at which they are going...

1955
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:29,083
I think your husband will have a sibling before you two can have a child.

1956
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:31,166
Oh my God. I will go and inform Kishan.

1957
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:35,250
And I will inform Ram.

1958
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:36,833
Please check and let us know.

1959
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:42,125
Look sir, no one by the name of Shivram Kishan is getting married today.

1960
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:43,708
Are you satisfied now?

1961
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:45,500
Let's go now.

1962
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,208
Hi. - It's good in a way.

1963
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:48,500
Hey.. - Hi.

1964
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,833
You are here. - Yes, I am here.

1965
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:51,833
You didn't go to the hospital to save your friend's life?

1966
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:53,875
I had. He survived so I came here.

1967
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:55,458
You friend barely survived today.

1968
01:43:55,958 --> 01:43:56,416
So, shall we get married now?

1969
01:43:56,916 --> 01:43:58,500
But my witnesses have already left.

1970
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,416
Oh. - Shall I call them back? - No. Why?

1971
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:02,250
Court marriages anyway don't last for long.

1972
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,250
Let's do one thing... Let's get married in a temple.

1973
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,750
You reach at the temple with all the things required for the wedding.

1974
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,500
Okay? - How will I know what are the things required?

1975
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Go. - I am lawyer. What do you think I am?

1976
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:14,000
Let's go. We will go to a temple and get married over there.

1977
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:20,083
Dad.

1978
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:23,541
What did you think? You'll go to the court and I won't come to know about it?

1979
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:24,875
Then what else could I do?

1980
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:27,041
You left me no choice.

1981
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:29,208
So, this is your choice?

1982
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:31,500
He is a cheat. How many times do I have to tell you that?

1983
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,083
He is a scoundrel. He is engaged.

1984
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:35,791
No, he is not engaged.

1985
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:39,416
Oh really? You are not engaged to anyone?

1986
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:42,125
No, sir. I never got engaged to anyone.

1987
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:45,125
Okay. I will show you.

1988
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:49,458
Pooja!

1989
01:44:49,958 --> 01:44:51,500
Yes, sir?

1990
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,500
Tell them. Are you engaged to him or not?

1991
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,250
What will she say, sir? Let me tell you.

1992
01:44:58,750 --> 01:44:59,833
This is the first time I am meeting her.

1993
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:01,416
And you say that I am engaged to her.

1994
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:04,375
I didn't say that. She is the one who told me.

1995
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:06,166
Tell them.

1996
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:07,291
Tell them.

1997
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:08,208
Yes, sir.

1998
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:10,458
Saw? - No.

1999
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:12,333
He is telling the truth. - What?

2000
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:15,125
I am not engaged to him.

2001
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:16,416
Heard her, dad?

2002
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:18,375
Hey, but...

2003
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:23,250
Then why do you have this photograph pinned up on your desk?

2004
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,625
Wait a minute.

2005
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:29,833
I had left this photo of Kumar on your table.

2006
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:31,166
You? - Yes.

2007
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:34,500
But this... - Yes, sir. I too had brought my fianc's photograph.

2008
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,875
But I don't know how it got changed.

2009
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:39,208
I didn't want to lose my job, sir.

2010
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:40,916
Hence I didn't say anything.

2011
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:44,041
I am very sorry, sir. - What sorry?

2012
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:48,750
Because of your mistake I suspected my future son-in-law.

2013
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,666
I broke my daughter's heart.

2014
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:53,875
You are fired. Find a new job.

2015
01:45:54,375 --> 01:45:56,291
Get out.

2016
01:45:56,791 --> 01:45:57,583
Spare her, sir.

2017
01:45:58,083 --> 01:45:59,875
Anyway, a person only lies when he or she is helpless.

2018
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:02,458
And no one can know that better than me.

2019
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:03,708
Let it be, sir.

2020
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:08,666
Yes, dad. Please forgive her.

2021
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:12,333
Fine, I will forgive her because you have asked me to.

2022
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,666
Go. - Thank you.

2023
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:16,791
Thank you, sir. Because of you I didn't lose my job.

2024
01:46:17,291 --> 01:46:19,833
No problem. I anyway have a bad habit of rescuing girls...

2025
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:22,416
Even if by doing that I end up trapping myself. No problem. Please carry on.

2026
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:26,416
Thank you, sir.

2027
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:34,541
Now I shall never doubt you.

2028
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:36,416
And I will also get you two married.

2029
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:39,500
That too in a grand manner.

2030
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,750
Nice? - Friends, relatives...

2031
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:43,666
Everyone should get an invitation.

2032
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,541
It should be a grand wedding. - Sure.

2033
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:47,541
And distribute all these invitation cards today itself.

2034
01:46:48,041 --> 01:46:49,166
Daddy, these are my personal invites.

2035
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:52,333
I will send them. - Okay. Not a problem.

2036
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,000
Hey... welcome. Come in.

2037
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,375
Wow, papa. The preparations are going on in full swing.

2038
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,708
Sister-in-law, let me know if you need me to do anything.

2039
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:01,250
Yes, there is something.

2040
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,083
Sweetheart!

2041
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,333
Karan, you stay at the Cocktail Tower, right?

2042
01:47:05,833 --> 01:47:07,208
Yes, sister-in-law. - Three of my friends stay there.

2043
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:09,500
I have already called them up. You just need to give them these invites.

2044
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,500
Okay? Thank you.

2045
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:19,541
Brother, your three wives will be attending your wedding.

2046
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:23,541
Now how will you get married?

2047
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:40,541
The date is fixed. The invites have been distributed.

2048
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:42,291
Don't worry, I will get married.

2049
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:45,916
You just wait and watch.

2050
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:47,791
It's going to be your funeral.

2051
01:47:48,291 --> 01:47:49,666
Papa, I wanted to say something. - Yes, son?

2052
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,416
You are doing a lot for our wedding. - Yes.

2053
01:47:51,916 --> 01:47:53,083
I too have a small desire.

2054
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:57,041
Tell me, what is it? I am ready to do anything you say.

2055
01:47:57,541 --> 01:47:59,041
Because one gets married just once in a lifetime.

2056
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:01,625
It's not like one gets married 3-4 times. So, tell me.

2057
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:06,083
Yes. At my wedding, I want everyone to recall their wedding.

2058
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:07,416
Let me not be the only groom present there.

2059
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,208
Let Deepika not be the only bride present there.

2060
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:12,166
Every boy should be a groom and every girl should be a bride.

2061
01:48:12,666 --> 01:48:14,833
Son, I am getting you two married.

2062
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:16,500
I am not organizing a group wedding.

2063
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,708
No, we are the only ones who will be getting married.

2064
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:20,333
But you know, every boy should be dressed as a groom.

2065
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:21,500
Every girl should be dressed as a bride.

2066
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,541
You know, it's going to be a theme wedding.

2067
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:25,291
Each couple looks like a newlywed couple.

2068
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:28,083
Wow. What a great idea! - Yeah.

2069
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,708
Isn't it, dad?

2070
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:31,875
Yes.

2071
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,416
Of course.

2072
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:38,416
Get my wedding dress.

2073
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:51,916
Priest, you are going in slow motion and that is causing me loose motions.

2074
01:48:52,416 --> 01:48:54,875
Please hurry up a little. Please go. - Sure.

2075
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:56,416
My brother! My brother! My brother!

2076
01:48:56,916 --> 01:48:58,208
You have come up with an amazing theme!

2077
01:48:58,708 --> 01:48:59,500
No one knows anything.

2078
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,916
Since morning two sisters-in-law have kissed me...

2079
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:02,458
They thought I am their husband.

2080
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:04,916
No one's father can recognize who is the real groom.

2081
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:07,375
Where is Kumar?

2082
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,500
He has made so many idiots dressed as grooms.

2083
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,875
Kumar!

2084
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:15,291
Sorry, sorry. Hello.

2085
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:16,041
Kumar?

2086
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:18,708
Uncle, your groom is over there.

2087
01:49:19,208 --> 01:49:20,500
What made you come up with such a strange scheme.

2088
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
No one is able to recognize anyone.

2089
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,625
Papa, I am over here.

2090
01:49:24,125 --> 01:49:26,458
Saw? No one is able to recognize anyone.

2091
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:28,625
Thank God the brides aren't hiding their faces under the veil.

2092
01:49:29,125 --> 01:49:31,000
Otherwise I would've been slapped 40 times since morning.

2093
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,791
Papa, before a few more brides join us why don't you call for my bride, please?

2094
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:37,375
Son, that's why I am here. Deepu has been...

2095
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:39,708
Look there she is.

2096
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:41,833
Deepu!

2097
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:45,833
Look dear, here he is.

2098
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,666
Kumar, it would've been so nice if your parents could've joined us..

2099
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:55,000
..to celebrate this joyous occasion.

2100
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,500
They wanted to come, but they suffer from joint pain.. - Hernia.

2101
01:49:59,000 --> 01:49:59,791
Hernia?

2102
01:50:00,291 --> 01:50:03,500
Actually the joint pain is so bad that it is causing hernia.

2103
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,708
And that is why they cannot walk around.

2104
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:09,708
Yes.

2105
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:12,750
But it's not like we wanted to them to do a parade.

2106
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,458
They would've sat on the sofa..

2107
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:16,208
..and gave their blessings to their son and daughter-in-law.

2108
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:17,875
But papa, they cannot even sit.

2109
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:21,000
Actually, their piles have also swollen up.

2110
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,083
Piles have swollen up?

2111
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:26,375
But I had heard that villagers are very healthy.

2112
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:29,625
You have heard it right.

2113
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:32,125
We consume pure clarified butter and we have a lot fun.

2114
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:34,083
Brijmohan!

2115
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:36,791
How do my parents know him? - I don't know.

2116
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:38,208
Congratulations.

2117
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:41,166
I knew you would come.

2118
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:43,375
Hello, sister-in-law. - Hello, brother.

2119
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:45,000
I am so happy to see you here.

2120
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,416
As you are here Deepu will also get a mother's blessings.

2121
01:50:47,916 --> 01:50:48,916
Come with me.

2122
01:50:49,416 --> 01:50:50,500
Dear, seek their blessings.

2123
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:51,708
Hello.

2124
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:53,208
God bless you, dear.

2125
01:50:53,708 --> 01:50:56,041
He is my childhood friend Brijmohan.

2126
01:50:56,541 --> 01:50:56,791
Hi.

2127
01:50:57,291 --> 01:50:58,333
And he is my future son-in-law.

2128
01:50:58,833 --> 01:51:01,000
Seek their blessings, son.

2129
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,708
God bless you, son.

2130
01:51:03,208 --> 01:51:04,250
He is well-cultured.

2131
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:06,291
He is indeed well-cultured.

2132
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:08,708
Your son too stays in this city, doesn't he?

2133
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:09,833
Why didn't he come with you?

2134
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:12,625
He is handling four offices. He doesn't have time to spare.

2135
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,333
What a co-incidence!

2136
01:51:14,833 --> 01:51:17,333
My son-in-law too handles four offices. - Oh really?

2137
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:19,500
Then son, always remember this.

2138
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,333
You need to balance your work and your home life.

2139
01:51:22,833 --> 01:51:25,625
Because a house.. - Runs on home-science and not science.

2140
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:27,541
Correct.

2141
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:30,166
Who said that?

2142
01:51:30,666 --> 01:51:32,375
Today you won't come to know.

2143
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:33,791
Today, everyone looks the same.

2144
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:36,625
Come, let's go and meet our friends. I mean let's go and find them.

2145
01:51:37,125 --> 01:51:41,958
Let's go, sister-in-law.

2146
01:51:42,458 --> 01:51:46,458
Look, my friends are here.

2147
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:47,583
Come, let me introduce you to them.

2148
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:48,708
Go ahead. I will be right back.

2149
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:50,750
Where are you going? - I'll go and meet the priest.

2150
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,458
Forget all that, come with me.

2151
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:56,916
You go ahead. - Come with me.

2152
01:51:57,416 --> 01:51:57,625
Hi!

2153
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,291
Simran! Anjali! Juhi!

2154
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:00,750
So good to see you guys. - Hi.

2155
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,166
Congratulations... - Leave, I'll handle them.

2156
01:52:02,666 --> 01:52:03,625
I am so happy for you, Deepika.

2157
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:05,375
You are looking so beautiful.

2158
01:52:05,875 --> 01:52:06,833
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

2159
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:08,625
Hey, won't you introduce us to your husband?

2160
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:09,916
Yes.

2161
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:11,875
Please show us your face.

2162
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:13,875
Why are you feeling so shy?

2163
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:15,583
Let me show it to you.

2164
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:17,541
He is my Kumar.

2165
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:18,500
Karan!

2166
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
No. There is some confusion.

2167
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
Actually, you mistook me for Kumar and dragged me here.

2168
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,083
I too didn't stop you. The excitement shouldn't end, right?

2169
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:28,250
Where is Kumar?

2170
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,125
I will go and find him.

2171
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,458
Priest, why is it taking so long? Quickly start the wedding.

2172
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:35,125
First let me get all the things place.

2173
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:36,500
It's not like you are making a barbeque.

2174
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,666
You just need to add four sticks. Quickly start the wedding.

2175
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:40,666
Look, I will be starting the wedding at the said auspicious time.

2176
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:46,000
If you are in a hurry you can elope and get married.

2177
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:49,875
The marriage will only take place after I let go of the groom.

2178
01:52:50,375 --> 01:52:53,000
You wanted 2 crore rupees as dowry, right?

2179
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:56,458
Now, if you want the groom back, give me 5 crore rupees.

2180
01:52:56,958 --> 01:53:00,583
And listen, if you want to say something, message me.

2181
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:04,583
Because I don't listen to anyone.

2182
01:53:08,625 --> 01:53:09,333
Hey... the groom ran away.

2183
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:12,791
Let's catch him. - Yes, let's go.

2184
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:14,791
We will get the ransom money by day after tomorrow.

2185
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:17,125
Until then, you two take care of this groom.

2186
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:19,416
Tiger-bhai, the groom ran away. - The groom ran away.

2187
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:21,125
Tiger-bhai! - Tiger-bhai!

2188
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:24,458
Tiger-bhai! The groom ran away. - He ran away.

2189
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,000
Tiger-bhai...the groom ran away.

2190
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,541
He ran away. - Police has come?

2191
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:29,583
Not the police. The groom ran away. - He ran away.

2192
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:31,666
The groom ran away and has entered the wedding take place next door.

2193
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:35,666
The groom ran away. - Yes.

2194
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,125
Hello.

2195
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:45,791
Hello.

2196
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:48,333
Hello. Look, this is a theme wedding.

2197
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:50,541
Please wear a groom's attire.

2198
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:53,416
Don't worry, we won't leave without eating.

2199
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:54,791
We are from the groom's side.

2200
01:53:55,291 --> 01:53:58,833
You didn't get me. You should change your dress.

2201
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:00,291
You don't understand, papa.

2202
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:02,291
If it gets even a little late then it will be too late.

2203
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,250
Don't worry at all.

2204
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:05,333
I was talking about something spicy and tangy, right? - Yes.

2205
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:07,125
Sister-in-law, you should try this. It is very tasty.

2206
01:54:07,625 --> 01:54:09,708
Quickly eat them and then go home. This wedding will take a while.

2207
01:54:10,208 --> 01:54:11,541
We are not in a hurry. We have a lot of time to spare.

2208
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:14,208
Yes. We will enjoy the entire wedding.

2209
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:18,000
Don't worry. I have permission till midnight.

2210
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:19,875
Mr. Verma.

2211
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:23,875
This man will be the death of me.

2212
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:27,708
Shiv! - Ram! - Kishan!

2213
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:29,208
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

2214
01:54:29,708 --> 01:54:31,708
You should try these first! They are mind-blowing.

2215
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:33,000
I swear they are delicious.

2216
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:34,833
Forget about this. I just saw Kishan over there.

2217
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:35,833
What are you saying, sister-in-law?

2218
01:54:36,333 --> 01:54:37,708
Yes, and I saw Shiv. - And I saw Ram.

2219
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,291
Oh I understood, sister-in-law.

2220
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:40,458
You are dressed as James Bond..

2221
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:42,416
..but you cannot handle four glasses on your own.

2222
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:45,916
This is a limit. I'm already so worried..

2223
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:48,833
Okay then, tell me. Where is he?

2224
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:50,500
He isn't there, right? - No.

2225
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,041
That's it, sister-in-law. This is happening because of hallucination.

2226
01:54:53,541 --> 01:54:55,250
I am sure you three have studied science. - No.

2227
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:57,166
Superb. Then you will understand this even better.

2228
01:54:57,666 --> 01:54:58,916
This is what happens during hallucination.

2229
01:54:59,416 --> 01:55:01,375
When we love someone from the bottom of our heart...

2230
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:04,916
His image is so well engraved into our minds that we see him everywhere.

2231
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:08,625
This is what happens during hallucination.

2232
01:55:09,125 --> 01:55:14,708
Okay, tell me, can you see your husband in the man standing with Deepika?

2233
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,500
Yes!

2234
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,750
Come on, sister-in-law.

2235
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:21,750
How can you three see Shiv, Ram and Kishan in the same person?

2236
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:30,916
Look, now look at him again. Do you see him in that man now?

2237
01:55:31,416 --> 01:55:31,708
No. - No.

2238
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:33,416
So that's hallucination.

2239
01:55:33,916 --> 01:55:35,208
Science is a very complicated thing.

2240
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:37,458
Forget about it. Enjoy the wedding. Now come on, enjoy these.

2241
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:39,375
I'll go and arrange for some more snacks. Tell me what will you have?

2242
01:55:39,875 --> 01:55:43,375
The one with fritters or the one with curd? Anyway, I will get both of them.

2243
01:55:49,166 --> 01:55:50,125
Aslam... - Yes?

2244
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:51,500
Everyone here is dressed as a groom.

2245
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,916
How will we find our groom?

2246
01:55:54,416 --> 01:55:55,500
Don't use your brains.

2247
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,708
Think of a way to find our groom.

2248
01:56:01,208 --> 01:56:01,875
Idea.

2249
01:56:02,375 --> 01:56:04,833
We'll apply vermillion on everyone's forehead and look at their faces.

2250
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:05,750
Yes.

2251
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:09,250
Where is he?

2252
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,291
Priest, I am the one who is getting married.

2253
01:56:11,791 --> 01:56:15,750
So why are you feeding yourself?

2254
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:18,708
Watch where you are going! - You are having 'Laddoos' (sweets)?

2255
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:20,750
Deepu has been looking for you.

2256
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,333
Okay. - Go on now.

2257
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:23,458
And why are you having these 'Laddoos'?

2258
01:56:23,958 --> 01:56:25,625
Have you come here to eat these 'Laddoos' or to get them married?

2259
01:56:26,125 --> 01:56:26,625
You are strange.

2260
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:28,916
Your three wives are looking for you.

2261
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:31,458
Quickly get married and leave.

2262
01:56:31,958 --> 01:56:33,250
Did you hear what I said?

2263
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:35,416
You...

2264
01:56:35,916 --> 01:56:39,416
Who was that idiot?

2265
01:56:43,083 --> 01:56:46,583
You have already applied it four times.

2266
01:56:50,041 --> 01:56:51,083
Brother-in-law, what are you doing over here!

2267
01:56:51,583 --> 01:56:52,333
Are you a wedding guest?

2268
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:54,916
Yes. What brings you here?

2269
01:56:55,416 --> 01:56:56,458
I am here for business reasons.

2270
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:57,958
I was holding a groom on ransom.

2271
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:00,000
But he ran away and came to this wedding venue. - Oh.

2272
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,958
I wonder which idiot came up with this theme.

2273
01:57:02,458 --> 01:57:03,291
Everyone is dressed as a groom.

2274
01:57:03,791 --> 01:57:05,416
If I find the person who came up with this theme...

2275
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:07,291
He will be the first person I'll shoot.

2276
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:08,625
No, brother. A wedding is going to take place over here.

2277
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:10,416
You should stay calm. Enjoy yourself a little.

2278
01:57:10,916 --> 01:57:11,958
Brother-in-law, you may go. I will go and find him.

2279
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:12,833
Okay, brother. - Go.

2280
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:16,833
Let's go.

2281
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,791
Go and stand at the gate, so that the groom doesn't escape.

2282
01:57:24,291 --> 01:57:27,333
Only one wedding is taking place, but there are many grooms present here.

2283
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:29,708
I think it's time for some fireworks.

2284
01:57:30,208 --> 01:57:34,291
Understood?

2285
01:57:34,791 --> 01:57:39,208
Everyone come forward for the garlanding ritual.

2286
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:42,458
Hey!

2287
01:57:42,958 --> 01:57:43,916
Here as well?

2288
01:57:44,416 --> 01:57:45,916
I think they couldn't get married in the court.

2289
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:48,666
Have they come here thinking that a group wedding is taking place?

2290
01:57:49,166 --> 01:57:52,666
Bride and groom, exchange your garlands, please.

2291
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:04,333
Brother?

2292
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:06,250
No one will move.

2293
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:09,500
I am looking for my groom.

2294
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,500
Everyone, remove your turbans.

2295
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,500
Remove them. Otherwise I will shoot you.

2296
01:58:25,541 --> 01:58:29,041
All of you too should remove your turbans.

2297
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:37,625
Are you deaf?

2298
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:40,875
Remove your turban.

2299
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:44,875
Remove it.

2300
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:50,500
Remove it or I will shoot you.

2301
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,708
Remove it, son.

2302
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:53,291
Remove it, Kumar. - He will shoot you.

2303
01:58:53,791 --> 01:58:54,416
Remove it. - Remove it.

2304
01:58:54,916 --> 01:58:58,416
Remove it. - Remove your turban, son.

2305
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:02,833
Remove it or I will shoot you.

2306
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:04,166
Remove it.

2307
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:06,416
Boss, we found the groom. - Remove it.

2308
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:08,333
Remove it.

2309
01:59:08,833 --> 01:59:11,416
Boss, we found our groom.

2310
01:59:11,916 --> 01:59:14,291
Where have you been!

2311
01:59:14,791 --> 01:59:17,875
I am very sorry for troubling all of you.

2312
01:59:18,375 --> 01:59:21,583
All of you can wear your turbans now and enjoy the wedding.

2313
01:59:22,083 --> 01:59:23,875
Priest, you may begin.

2314
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:26,708
Let's take him away. - Let's go.

2315
01:59:27,208 --> 01:59:30,708
You barely escaped, brother. - Yes.

2316
01:59:37,416 --> 01:59:40,416
Priest, why are you wasting our time. Why don't you put all of it at one go?

2317
01:59:40,916 --> 01:59:44,416
Come on...

2318
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:57,250
Bholu!

2319
01:59:58,791 --> 01:59:59,333
You?

2320
01:59:59,833 --> 02:00:01,291
You are getting married again?

2321
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:03,041
But you already have me.

2322
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:05,583
What are you saying? Not you, he has me.

2323
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:09,291
How does it affect you? He is my husband.

2324
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:11,083
He isn't your husband. He is my husband.

2325
02:00:11,583 --> 02:00:12,625
Have you two lost your mind?

2326
02:00:13,125 --> 02:00:14,166
He is my husband. - What?

2327
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:16,416
Hey! Enough of this nonsense.

2328
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:17,583
You started joking again?

2329
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:21,083
Dear, they are the same three women who fooled me at the mall.

2330
02:00:21,583 --> 02:00:23,208
They said that he is their husband.

2331
02:00:23,708 --> 02:00:25,958
Hello. He is my husband, Shiv.

2332
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:28,500
He isn't Shiv. His is Ram, my husband.

2333
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,041
No Deepika, I am telling the truth.

2334
02:00:30,541 --> 02:00:32,916
He is my husband, Kishan. - Shut up.

2335
02:00:33,416 --> 02:00:35,541
Have you three lost your mind?

2336
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:36,958
He isn't anyone's Shiv, Ram or Kishan.

2337
02:00:37,458 --> 02:00:39,500
He is my Kumar.

2338
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,500
Hold on.

2339
02:00:55,750 --> 02:01:01,708
Answer the question I ask you in yes or no.

2340
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:08,625
Are the three of them your wives?

2341
02:01:09,125 --> 02:01:14,000
Mother... - Yes or no.

2342
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:18,083
Yes.

2343
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:21,500
Shameless!

2344
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,208
You are already married three times...

2345
02:01:23,708 --> 02:01:25,500
And you were about to get married for the fourth time!

2346
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,083
Why didn't you just die before doing such a shameful deed?

2347
02:01:28,583 --> 02:01:33,125
I wouldn't be as sad on your death as I am now.

2348
02:01:33,625 --> 02:01:38,250
You ruined the lives of four girls.

2349
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:39,958
Is this what I taught you?

2350
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:43,083
Is this what I taught?

2351
02:01:43,583 --> 02:01:46,333
You remember what I always told you?

2352
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,500
Never break a woman's heart.

2353
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,750
And never ruin a family!

2354
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,583
You broke everyone's trust.

2355
02:01:56,083 --> 02:02:00,000
You ruined everyone's life. Everyone's!

2356
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,875
Rukmani! That's enough.

2357
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:03,791
Stop it.

2358
02:02:04,291 --> 02:02:09,708
I always said that my Bholu is very nave.

2359
02:02:10,208 --> 02:02:11,708
But I was wrong.

2360
02:02:12,208 --> 02:02:13,875
You are a cheat.

2361
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:16,791
A beguiler.

2362
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,416
No, mother.

2363
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:22,500
Your Bholu is not a cheat.

2364
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,625
I have not cheated anyone.

2365
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:28,000
Juhi, tell me..

2366
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:32,583
..your father placed your hand in my hand at the hospital and passed away.

2367
02:02:33,083 --> 02:02:40,166
Did he ever ask whether I already had anyone in my life?

2368
02:02:40,666 --> 02:02:42,291
And Anjali, you?

2369
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:44,416
You were going to commit suicide, right?

2370
02:02:44,916 --> 02:02:46,500
I saved your life.

2371
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,666
Your brother forced me at gunpoint to get married to you.

2372
02:02:51,166 --> 02:02:54,666
Who was the one who cheated?

2373
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:58,958
And Simran, you?

2374
02:02:59,458 --> 02:03:05,958
I had told you that my friend fooled me into getting at the wedding venue.

2375
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:07,666
But you weren't ready to listen to me.

2376
02:03:08,166 --> 02:03:11,458
You wanted to jump into the holy fire and kill yourself.

2377
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:13,833
Should I have left you to die?

2378
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:22,041
How have I cheated you when I held you hand to save your life?

2379
02:03:22,541 --> 02:03:25,666
Yes, I did make one mistake, mother.

2380
02:03:26,166 --> 02:03:29,333
I didn't tell these three of them about each other.

2381
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:33,083
Because if I had told them, then they would have killed themselves.

2382
02:03:33,583 --> 02:03:41,583
Mother, now you tell me, how can I kill the ones whose lives I have saved?

2383
02:03:42,083 --> 02:03:47,333
If there is anyone whom I have cheated, then that is you, Deepika.

2384
02:03:47,833 --> 02:03:50,708
I didn't tell you that I got married three times.

2385
02:03:51,208 --> 02:03:53,250
Now you tell me, what should have I done?

2386
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:55,916
People try to forget tragedies.

2387
02:03:56,416 --> 02:03:59,541
But I have been truthfully living with them.

2388
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:01,541
I didn't want three families.

2389
02:04:02,041 --> 02:04:04,208
But I thought if I have been through tragedies...

2390
02:04:04,708 --> 02:04:05,916
Then these three have also gone through one.

2391
02:04:06,416 --> 02:04:07,875
It's not their fault either.

2392
02:04:08,375 --> 02:04:12,083
I just wanted one family.

2393
02:04:12,583 --> 02:04:14,333
There was just one person that I love.

2394
02:04:14,833 --> 02:04:15,750
You, Deepu.

2395
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:19,750
And I didn't want to lose you.

2396
02:04:23,375 --> 02:04:24,625
"Never break a woman's heart."

2397
02:04:25,125 --> 02:04:27,166
"Never ruin a family."

2398
02:04:27,666 --> 02:04:30,125
To keep my promise to you, your Bholu...

2399
02:04:30,625 --> 02:04:33,500
...Shivram Kishan got divided into three parts, mother.

2400
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,291
I've been running faster than a clock so that I can give time to everyone.

2401
02:04:37,791 --> 02:04:39,666
I have kept everyone happy.

2402
02:04:40,166 --> 02:04:42,083
I showed everyone my face before I left in the morning...

2403
02:04:42,583 --> 02:04:46,500
..so that there is a smile on their face all day.

2404
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,750
I tried to keep everyone happy.

2405
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:50,333
Ask them, mother. Ask them.

2406
02:04:50,833 --> 02:04:53,541
Have I not been honest in the little time that I've spent with each of them?

2407
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:56,458
Have I cheated them even a little?

2408
02:04:56,958 --> 02:04:58,916
Ask them, mother.

2409
02:04:59,416 --> 02:05:03,416
If I would've rejected them and led my own life...

2410
02:05:03,916 --> 02:05:07,541
Then neither you would have been happy nor God.

2411
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:10,291
If you still feel that I am wrong...

2412
02:05:10,791 --> 02:05:14,125
Then you can punish me however you want.

2413
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:16,916
You have given me life.

2414
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:23,958
Even if you wish to take away that life, I won't say a word.

2415
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:27,958
I won't say a word.

2416
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:39,791
My son.

2417
02:05:51,291 --> 02:05:55,958
What have you decided, Deepu?

2418
02:05:56,458 --> 02:06:00,250
A person who can love the tragedies that happened to him...

2419
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:04,250
His love should never suffer from any tragedy.

2420
02:06:43,291 --> 02:06:43,958
This is good, brother.

2421
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:45,625
All four of them stay on separate floors...

2422
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:48,458
But they have accepted each other.

2423
02:06:48,958 --> 02:06:52,041
Karan, there is something that I don't understand.

2424
02:06:52,541 --> 02:06:54,291
What happened to me, was it comedy or a tragedy?

2425
02:06:54,791 --> 02:06:56,416
Consider it to be comedy. You will be able to digest it better.

2426
02:06:56,916 --> 02:06:58,125
Anyway, you don't need to fear anything now.

2427
02:06:58,625 --> 02:07:00,500
Everyone knows about your four marriages.

2428
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:01,791
You are right.

2429
02:07:02,291 --> 02:07:04,916
But if Tiger-bhai finds out about it then he will shoot me.

2430
02:07:05,416 --> 02:07:07,916
He won't be able to understand the comedy.

2431
02:07:08,416 --> 02:07:09,291
Tiger-bhai!

2432
02:07:09,791 --> 02:07:11,791
From his forehead I can foretell that he doesn't listen to anyone.

2433
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:15,750
Even his medical reports say that.

2434
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:17,958
How are you, Tiger-bhai?

2435
02:07:18,458 --> 02:07:19,375
He is Mr. Daruwala. - Hi.

2436
02:07:19,875 --> 02:07:22,291
He will look at your hand tell us when will you have a kid.

2437
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:23,041
Strange.

2438
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:24,583
In science one can know that through ultrasonography...

2439
02:07:25,083 --> 02:07:25,875
You will tell us just by looking at his hands?

2440
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:28,625
I am an astrologer. I'll first tell how good is..

2441
02:07:29,125 --> 02:07:30,500
..the relationship between the husband and wife.

2442
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,500
If that is good then only will they have kids.

2443
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,125
Come on, show me your hand.

2444
02:07:37,625 --> 02:07:38,250
Oh my God.

2445
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:39,916
What happened? Is this the first time you are looking at a naked hand?

2446
02:07:40,416 --> 02:07:43,041
No, you are destined for four marriages.

2447
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:46,125
Four kids! That great news.

2448
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:47,708
Four marriages.

2449
02:07:48,208 --> 02:07:50,625
It will take four years? Yes. It takes that long. - Yes.

2450
02:07:51,125 --> 02:07:53,166
I have no problem with it. - Marriages. Four. Four.

2451
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:55,125
You want 400 rupees? You will get it.

2452
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:56,750
Take him back to where we got them from. - Okay.

2453
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,500
Let's go. - You may leave. - He is destined for four marriages.

2454
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,500
He doesn't listen to me.

2455
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,500
Look, he said that you will have four kids.

2456
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,791
But I would still say that two kids are enough.

2457
02:08:04,291 --> 02:08:05,208
He has four wives.

2458
02:08:05,708 --> 02:08:08,625
If each wife has two kids, he will have eight kids for sure.

2459
02:08:09,125 --> 02:08:11,750
Not eight, it should take nine months to deliver a child.

2460
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:14,750
Otherwise the child born is weak. Have you not studied science?

2461
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,750
I think you were on in seven months.

2462
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:18,041
If you had stayed in for another two months...

2463
02:08:18,541 --> 02:08:19,625
..then you would've got two working ears as well.

2464
02:08:20,125 --> 02:08:22,166
You don't need to apologize.

2465
02:08:22,666 --> 02:08:25,875
Don't worry. I will bear all the expenses of your child.

2466
02:08:26,375 --> 02:08:27,750
Remember what I had told you?

2467
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:31,041
I am the only uncle, but I have a lot of desires.

2468
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:32,708
Sir!

2469
02:08:33,208 --> 02:08:34,541
Congratulations.

2470
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:36,958
Sir! Congratulations!

2471
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:38,083
Congratulations!

2472
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:41,125
Many, many congrats. Please have some sweets.

2473
02:08:41,625 --> 02:08:42,250
What's the occasion?

2474
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:45,708
He didn't invite me but of course I'll offer sweets to everyone.

2475
02:08:46,208 --> 02:08:48,416
My employer got married for the fourth time.

2476
02:08:48,916 --> 02:08:50,458
She too knows about the four kids?

2477
02:08:50,958 --> 02:08:52,958
What? Sir, you have four kids as well?

2478
02:08:53,458 --> 02:08:54,416
No, you are misunderstanding him.

2479
02:08:54,916 --> 02:08:56,958
Come on, sir! You hid your wives from everyone...

2480
02:08:57,458 --> 02:08:58,541
And you also hid four kids.

2481
02:08:59,041 --> 02:09:00,583
Now I will tell everyone.

2482
02:09:01,083 --> 02:09:02,666
Madam! Madam, listen! - Champa!

2483
02:09:03,166 --> 02:09:04,541
There is good news. - Have you lost your mind? Listen to me.

2484
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,625
He is going with her to distribute the sweets.

2485
02:09:07,125 --> 02:09:09,166
A child does makes you that happy.

2486
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:10,583
When are you getting married?

2487
02:09:11,083 --> 02:09:12,791
Brother, I am still just a kid.

2488
02:09:13,291 --> 02:09:14,333
I know you are a lawyer.

2489
02:09:14,833 --> 02:09:16,208
But you will get married, won't you?

2490
02:09:16,708 --> 02:09:17,750
There is a girl whom I consider to be my sister.

2491
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:20,708
All her talks about marriage has given me earache.

2492
02:09:21,208 --> 02:09:23,125
But look, she too found a groom today.

2493
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:25,041
Really? Who?

2494
02:09:25,541 --> 02:09:25,958
You.

2495
02:09:26,458 --> 02:09:27,166
Me?

2496
02:09:27,666 --> 02:09:30,625
Congratulations.

2497
02:09:31,125 --> 02:09:34,083
Saw that? Tragedies can happen to anyone.

2498
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:36,541
Just pray that no one gets married accidentally.

2499
02:09:37,041 --> 02:09:38,208
No harm is done to the other person.

2500
02:09:38,708 --> 02:09:40,375
All it takes is a 'Laddoo' (sweets).
