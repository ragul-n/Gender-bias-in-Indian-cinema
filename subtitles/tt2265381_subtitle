1
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,207
Heavy blood loss!

2
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,040
Get him fast!

3
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,499
Commissioner, he needs
medical treatment.

4
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,665
lt's illegal to take him
without my permission.

5
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:13,124
He's just a patient to you
but he's my son!

6
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,290
How disciplined l had raised you!
But what have you grown to be!

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,415
l hate to see you!

8
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,582
How many crimes you've committed
using my name and power!

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,707
Balu, stop it here!
Hereafter you're on your own.

10
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,165
l'm going away from you.

11
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,957
l'll see you again the day l come
to know you've reformed.

12
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:50,624
Shiva, auspicious time has elapsed,
Divya would've got married!

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,707
3 years later...

14
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,415
Delhi

15
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,540
Exams are over
so hostel will be closed.

16
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,499
Rahul is leaving Delhi by flight!

17
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,415
lfwe don't catch him now,
we can never catch him.

18
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,707
He mustn't board the flight,
let's kill, send him in mortuary van!

Where is Rahul?
- He's in room, why?

22
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,124
He's going back to Hyderabad, right?
To give him send off.

23
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,332
What's Rahul's room number?

24
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,582

Tell me something new,

30
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,290
We must watch Rahul getting beaten up!
We mustn't miss the show!

31
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,332
Rahul! Open the door!

32
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,415
Open the door!
lf you're a man, come out!

33
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,582
Come out...open the door!

34

Break open the door!

35
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,707
We came here to kill and
he has committed suicide!

36
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,749
l said in an emotion
l didn't mean to kill him.

37
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,082
What shall we do now?

38
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,582
Call police.

39
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,624
His feet are moving,
l think he's still alive!

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,707
Hold him boys!
Get a stool!

41
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,082
Get up and loosen the knot.

42
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,540
You call the ambulance.
Remove the noose!

43
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,207
Put him on bed!

44
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,665
Rahul...get up!

45
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,249
l'm sure Raja would bash him up!

46
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,040
And we must enjoy Rahul's
cries of distress...

47
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,707
Move fast boys!

48
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,040
Did you call the ambulance?

49
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,040
Make it fast! Fast!

50
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,499
You said they came to bash Rahul!

51
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,624
lt looks like a procession
not bashing up someone.

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,290
We were resting happily in room,
why did you disturb us?

53
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,582
Go quickly, l'm getting late to party.

54
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,707
He's playing a drama!
Put him down!

55
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,707

00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,749
Beat him boys!
- Stop...stop...

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,040

00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,082
First decide now, whether you
want to kill me or save me!

61
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,999
Decide and then do it.

62

We came to kill you!
- Fixed?- Fixed!

63
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,957

Okay, kill me!
- Kill him boys!

65
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,415
Wait...wait...

66
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,582

67
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,749
Who broken open the door to save me?
- Why?

68
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:45,332
Nothing, l want to hug him,

69
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,707
lt's me, Rahul!

70
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:53,332
Hey Laddu! You're my true friend!
You saved my life, thank you!

71
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,957
What?- l saw your feet moving and
said you're still alive.

72
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,374
Was it you?

73
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,332

l got you off the noose and
brought you down.

77
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:14,040
But finally one intelligent guy
asked to call ambulance,

78
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,749

79
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,499

You're great!

88

Look at him! Learn from him!
This is friendship!

89
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,290
What are you here for?

90
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,165
You wanted to enjoy seeing me

91
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:01,665
Stop...stop...
No use in beating them!

92
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,040

Can't you see the board?

96
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,040

98
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,707
This song is not for you!

99
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,749
Lachamma lost her hen...

100
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,207
Lachamma lost her cock...

101
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,040
Lachamma lost her egg...

102
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,499
Once upon a time l had
a devastating girl friend...

103
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:30,290
We had a break-up after a tiff...

104
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:35,082
When l went to pub in bad mood,
they insisted on a girl...

105
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,707
They put up a board of
no entry for stags...

106
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,499

No boys no income to pubs...

00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:32,040
Girls are here for free drinks only...

112
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:36,749
And they call it as ladies' night...

What's this din?
You sing, bro!

lf girls come with girls,
they're welcomed...

117
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,457
lf boys come with boys,
they're chased out...

118
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:30,249
Are girls so great and
boys so waste?

119
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:35,540
You better know it now

120
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,290
Buddy!

l'll marry the man who buys
me these bangles.

132
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,999
Please don't do it, you and
your madness of bangles.

133
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,999
l'll buy it for you. Okay?

00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,499
Will you buy it?

135
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,290
Then, marriage is cancelled.

136
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,290
What a girl!
Mad about bangles!

137
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,290

bangles cost, madam?

138

220
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,707

227
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,707
Runway has been closed
due to heavy rain,

228
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,749
so flight has landed in Goa.

229
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,749
Don't come to airport, mom.

230
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,290

Take it, call your home.

238
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,790
lf you don't call home
getting angry on me,

239
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:14,332
your people would come to the airport
and get worried unnecessarily.

240
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,582
ls it necessary?

241
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:25,332

Not to hurt you!

242
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,332

l'll call and chase you,

245
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:47,624
may be you're expecting this,
but l'm not like that.

00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,124
No problem, make a call.

247
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,165

253
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,290

food or someone's brain.

266
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,499
Okay brother!

267

268
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,124
After 3 years Priya is coming...

269
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,290
lt's pouring heavily, right?

270
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,082

00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,332
How is Geetha?

277
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,374
What am l to say, mother?

278
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,540
l'm more worried about you going
away than l'm not having any kids.

279
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,457
lt's 3 years since
l've seen you, mother.

280

You don't worry, l'll talk to your

our daughter-in-law?

00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,707
Let's go there at least for her sake.

295
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:57,165
You came this far to bring
a change in him, right?

00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,457
We'll know if he has changed
or not only ifwe go to him, right?

297

l lost the cap on the way
to the airport.

310
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,999

So, you're to going to meet your

Your attention please!

318
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,374
We're unable to tell you
when your flight will take off,

319
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,499
we're arranging refreshments
to all the passengers.

320
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,582
Three times!
- Visited thrice?

321
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,415
l thought of coming but couldn't come.

322
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:35,999
Now, fourth time l'm in
Goa unexpectedly,

323
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,707
but can't go out to see!

324
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:45,957
This time you're seeing Goa!
Who you are with?

325
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:48,957
What will you do?

326
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,540
For the present l'll make
a phone call.

327
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,582
How are you buddy?

328
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:02,582
How am l? Have you forgotten it?
l knew you'd forget it.

329
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,582
l'm getting married in 2 hours.

330
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,707
l called you on phone, gave SMS,
sent Email and invitation card too.

331
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,499
But still you forgot it.

332
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,040
l'm ashamed to tell that
you're my friend.

333
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,707
What's today's date?

334
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,290

00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,957
Stop...stop it!

338
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,540
l should be shouting on you,
why are you shouting on me?

339
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,499
No use in inviting people
to marriage,

340
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,499
you must have the sense
of receiving the guests.

341
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,415
Buddy! Are you in Goa?

342
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,499
Do you think l'm Goa because
my Hyderabad flight got diverted?

343
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,582
ln 10 minutes, l'll send a car.

344
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,624
Send immediately, hang the phone.

345
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,207
ln exam tension l forgot
about his marriage.

346
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:49,040
Had Jaya aunt been here,
she would've killed me!

347
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,040
Priya come, let's go to the marriage.

348
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:55,415
To marriage?

You'll get bored alone here.

352
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:13,457
Fourth time you wish to see Goa is

353
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,040
Come, let's go.

Buddy! Why are you leaving immediately?

359
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,165
What happened?

360
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:34,999
What else?
Did l forget your marriage?

361
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:38,249
Look Priya, we came here after a
great struggle to attend his marriage,

362
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,624

about his marriage,

363
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,040
Please forgive me.

No need, you can leave!
Go...go...go...

369
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,582
Would l allow you in
if you fall at my feet?

370
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,290
Go...go...why are you coming in?

371
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,124
Are you asking me to go away, aunty?

372
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,290
l didn't come here for him
but for you, aunty!

373
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,457
You're good in apple polishing!

What? When did you marry?

378
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,040
What's this so suddenly?

379
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,499
Very beautiful! You're very sweet!

380
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:42,624
l think l'll cast evil eye on you!

381
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,707
l can't believe it!

382
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,540
Not only you, she too can't believe it.

383
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,457
She's still in that shock!

384
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:49,540
You could've at least
informed me, right?

385
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,707
l haven't yet told my mother too, aunty!

386
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,040
Aunty, you must break
this news to them.

387
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,040
Aunty will support us fully! Okay?

That's why you've come here.

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,415
l'll take you to task later.

390
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,665
You're standing in sun, come in.

391
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,249
Come in...come in...

392
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,332
Yamuna, come here. Rahul's wife!

393
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:14,707
Aunty, l need to talk to Rahul.
- Okay...okay.

394
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,707
Nothing nephew, just on diet off late.

395
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,165
l must go back to airport immediately.
- Why? What happened?

396
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,499
Why did you tell aunty
that we're married?

397
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,582
Oh that thing! l've a reason
to tell like that.

398
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,457
l don't want to hear your reasons,
what did you tell me in airport?

399
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:33,999
Didn't you promise to behave properly?

400
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,290
l told you one more thing in airport.

401
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,624
l promised you wonderful
time in Goa, right?

402
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,665
How is it connected with this?

403
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,624
Just wait for 10 minutes,
you'll understand it.

404
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,582
lf you don't understand by then,
go to aunty,

405
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:45,499
and tell her it's a lie! Okay?

406
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,040
Arrangements are excellent!

407
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,290
What do you think of us then?

408
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:03,290
What nephew?
- What?

409
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,082

413
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:21,249
Did you design it yourself?
- Come to the point.

414
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:25,499
l bought many saris and jewels
to Priya for this marriage.

415
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,415
But my luggage is stuck in airport.

416
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:32,374
You want your wife to appear

417
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,582

425
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,249
Aunty, l want to tell you something.

426
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,665
You don't need to tell me anything.

427
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,582
Just one minute, aunty...
l want to tell you something.

428
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,249

You're very lucky, you know that?

432
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,040
Rahul is very good boy!

433
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,249
lf l had a daughter, l would've
made him my son-in-law.

434
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:27,457
He's very mischievous but there's love
behind those mischievous acts.

435
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,374
People who understand him know it.

436
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:34,332
My son and Rahul are same to me.

437
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,207

Aunty, not that...
- Take it! See! You'll like it.

441
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,457
How is it?

00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:19,124
That is...nothing aunty!

446
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:22,457
Rahul always tells about you.

447
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:29,332

00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,165
Who is she?
- That girl in maroon sari.

453
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,499
Her face ravishing!
- Forget her face, look at her waist!

454
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,082

455
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,624
How do l look?

456
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:11,290
Don't stare at me...

457
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:18,707
Don't smile piercingly...

458
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:34,457
Don't stand before me
and devour my heart...

459
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:41,957
Don't take my life with
your swinging waist...

460
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:51,290
Won't my heart burn on seeing
your scorching beauty?

461
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:51,665
Like a thunder a dream
has struck me...

462
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:58,749
lt turned me into a queen
on earth...

463
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:06,499
The palace turned bright
with happiness...

464
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:13,582
As the most beautiful dances...

465
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,249
Everything changed in moments
because of you...

466
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:22,707
And my cheeks blossomed
like flowers...

467
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,707
Go on a pilgrimage to Kasi.

468
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:40,624
Priest...

469
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:50,249
Brother-in-law, stop...
Please marry my sister...

470
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:19,582
This magical thought
didn't start now...

471
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:27,082
May be this had started in
our previous birth itself...

472
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:35,457
What's this sudden expectation
in my heart?

473
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:42,957
l didn't have this feeling earlier,
why now?

474
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:46,749
Your wish must live on forever...

475
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:51,499
My entire life must be with you
like this day...

476
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:52,082
Looks like you've got close
to all of them.

477
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,707
Yes, your people are taking
good care of me.

478
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,457
Had l introduced you as my friend,

479
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,207

chair and served you a cool drink,

l wanted you to be a special guest,
so l lied to them.

481
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:09,332
Do you think this goes
to your credit?

482
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,957
l got little importance for your lie,

483
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:17,165

for my lies!

484

What did you tell them?

485

01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,040
Have a peg!
- No uncle.

520
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,082
Don't hesitate, have it.

521
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,624
l'm little afraid, uncle.
- Why?

522
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,040
l won't stop with one peg.

523
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,332
Have as many pegs as you like.

524
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,082
Sure?
- Sure.

525
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,124
Drink!

526
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:14,165
Nephew! Where, how and
when did you get married?

527
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,290
You're stopping my drink,

528
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:18,499
Drink!

529
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,457
He'll tell!

530
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:27,249
Ask me now!

531
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:32,249
Where, how and
when did you get married?

532
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,499
Uncle, don't tell anybody!
- Okay.

533
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,082
Sure?
- Sure.

534
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:44,582
My marriage took place then...
there and like that!

535
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,707
Aren't you asleep?

536
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:18,082
No.

537
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,999
What are you looking at?

538
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,457
May l ask you a thing?

539
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,082
What?

540
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:35,665
Did l ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

541
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:42,499
No!

542
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,332
0Do you know why l told you this?

543
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:47,582
Why?

544
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:52,082
Because you're not that beautiful!

545
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,999
Bloody idiot!
Get up Rahul!

546
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:32,207
Get up!

547
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,457
Do you know what's the time now?

548
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:00,624
Did l ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

549
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,999
l know your answer.
Get up quickly.

550
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,707
All are ready and waiting for us.

551
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:10,165
Let me sleep for some more time.

552
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:13,290
Our flight is scheduled
to leave at 1 pm.

553
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,499
Then, we must leave.

554
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:22,207
Let's leave now.
- Why so early?- Yes.

555
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,707
Airport is near by, let's stay here
for some more time and then go.

556
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,957
We've to leave and we're going.
That's it.

557
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,707
Just some more time with
uncle and aunty, please.

558
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:35,457
Don't tell me anything.
We're going, that's all.

559
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:59,999
Jaya aunty, remember your love
all my life - Priya

560
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,374
Next time you must stay
here for a month.

561
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,040
Whether that fool comes or not.

562
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,165
l'll show you entire Goa!

563
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,040
Looks like you're leaving
without telling me something.

564
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:30,165
We both are not married.
- l know it. - You know it?

565
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:34,332
How can you marry without me?
l knew you were lying.

566
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:39,082
But liked your lie and that girl too!

567
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,749
That girl is very good!

568
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:44,165
Neither l nor your mom can find
a better girl than her for you.

569
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:46,999
Give it.

570
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,415
Present these bangles and
express your love to her.

571
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,374
Why are you dull?

572
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,624
l'm asking you!

573
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:20,415
For leaving early?

574
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,207
Don't open your eyes or talk
till l ask you!

575
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,999
Be silent!
- Why?

576
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,249
Where are you taking me?

577
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,457
What did you tell me?

578
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:45,499
You said you missed visiting
Goa three times,

579
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,290
and missing it for
the fourth time also,

580
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,540
we've four hours
before our flight leaves,

581
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,624
you'll not miss this time.

582
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,249
There's something deep
inside the heart...

583
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:24,665
Gestures don't make any sense...

584
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:29,290
There's something hidden
in the words..

585
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,082
Do something in action...

586
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:57,582
From yesterday to today...
it has changed totally...

587
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:11,999
lmaginations of the past have
become wishes to reach you...

588
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:50,165
l'm seeing you everywhere...
l'm hearing you always...

589
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:53,582
l'm seeing a life every moment...

590
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:58,415
At last l'm the smile on your face...

591
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:05,499
Why should there be
a change like this?

592
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:12,749
What's the reason behind all this?

593
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:18,665
Though we know the answer,
we ask the question...

594
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,582
Come out from the depths
of the heart...

595
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:54,040
The thought reaching the eyes...

596
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,457
The desire in the eyes fall
on the smile of lips...

597
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:02,499
lt hides in the laughter...

598
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:09,624
The thought stopped there...

599
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,749
lt crosses, what would happen to me?
What would l become?

600
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:22,749
Just one word only,
what are you waiting for?

601
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,165
l'm allergic to take off.

602
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:09,124
Had you not come to the marriage,
l would've got bored!

603
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,415
Have you forgotten anything?

604
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,999
Your clothes! You've forgotten it.

605
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:24,290
Where would l get my luggage?

606
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:27,124
There!

607
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,415
1 Mother!

608
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,540
How is Jaya aunty?
How did the marriage go off?

609
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,540
Fine, mom.

610
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,707
How was the bride?
- Fine.

611
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,624
How did you write your exams?
- Fine, mom.

612
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,040
Sister!
When did you come?

613
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:03,165
Last night.
- How are you? Are you fine?

614
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,040
l'm fine.

615
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:10,374
l'm here from America for you and
what are you looking there?

616
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:11,749
Nothing sister.

617
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:16,999
Sister!

618
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:27,749
Brother!

619
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:14,457
Rahul, food is getting cold,
get your sister too.

620
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:15,499
Sister!

621
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,915
Sister!
- What?

622
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,499
Come quickly, sister.
Let's have lunch.

623
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,207
Wait a minute.
- Okay.

624
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,290
You're practicing time is getting
reduced with every passing day, Shiva.

625
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,707
Prakash is practicing
14 hours everyday.

626
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,665
lf you don't increase the practicing
time, he'll surely win.

627
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,624
Practice? Let's see in the final.

628
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:20,040
To win he must participate, right?
Find Prakash's house.

629
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,499
l got it.

630
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,415
Who is he? She's talking to him.

631
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,124
You're after her from the day
she joined this college.

632
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,290
You've told her l love you
hundred times,

633
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,957
and she has said no
two hundred times.

634
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,957
You forget her, let's first take
Prakash to task.

635
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:43,165
We can take care of Prakash later,
first her!

636
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:53,999
What are you talking to her?

637
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,290
She had a doubt and
l was explaining her.

638
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,957
Doubt?

639
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:01,082
Tell me now...

640
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:02,999
Go away!

641
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,249
How many times l've told you?
Can't you understand?

642
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,457
Whether you like it or not,
you're mine!

643
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:12,249
Whether you cry or laugh,
it's for me only.

644
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,374
Whether you like it or not,
you'll marry me only!

645
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,999
On the auspicious Thursday
of Telugu month Chaitra,

646
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:29,040
Goutham and Divya's marriage
will be solemnized.

647
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:34,332
This is notjust a ring!
Our family's fortune!

648
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:37,707
l'm handing it over to you,
take care of it well.

649
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:44,540
Where did you buy this ring?
lt's very beautiful!

650
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,499
She didn't even tell us about it.

651
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,582
He gets enraged for talking to her,

652
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,207
can't imagine what he would
do if she marries?

653
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,374
That's why, kept it secret.

654
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,040
What's it Shiva?

655
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,374
This is what you've understood
in all these years!

656
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:03,665
You said l'll create trouble in
your engagement, you're wrong.

657
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,499
lf l knew this before
l wouldn't create trouble,

658
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,707
l would've killed!

659
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,457
Till now l said l don't like you!

660
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:19,332
Just now you said you don't love me.

661
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:24,540
No man who loves a girl
would hurt her in any way.

662
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,082
He wouldn't torture her.
He wouldn't threaten to kill her.

663
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:30,124
Yours is love but a craze!

664
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:34,165
l'll not leave you,
l'm telling you again.

665
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,749
You're mine.

666
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,040
Give that ring to me.

667
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:50,040
Leave me!

668
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:05,582
No Shiva!

669
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,040
l searched everywhere but
didn't find it, madam.

670
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,082
You've been searching from
morning, night has fallen.

671
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:28,707
Go home now.

672
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:34,374
No, l can't go home
without that ring.

673
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:37,582
My mother-in-law told me to take
good care of it before giving me.

674
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,040
l've understood it, madam.

675
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:41,457
l'll search the entire night
and find the ring.

676
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:45,665
Shiva and his friends booze here,
they may come her any time now.

677
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,957
lt's not good for you to stay here.
Go home.

678
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:06,165
Sister...sister...
what happened sister?

679
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,290
Why are you crying?
Tell me sister.

680
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,124
What happened?

681
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:31,332
Where is Shiva?
- There!

682
01:21:51,458 --> 01:22:01,415
Where is the ring? Threw it here, right?
Find it! Find, it bastard!

683
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,082
Find it!

684
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:09,290
Will you kill my sister? Bloody!

685
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:12,040
lf you don't find the ring,
l'll kill you. Find it!

686
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:16,040
Find it!
How dare you beat my sister!

687
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:22,040
Find the ring!
Find it...find it...

688
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:28,499
Find the ring!

01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:53,582

690
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,749
Priya too loves you?

691
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:00,207
Yes sister.

692
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,040
Shiva will not agree.

693
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,165
l don't know who Priya was
when l fell in love with her.

694
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:07,499
l can't change my heartjust
because she's his sister.

695
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:09,082
Get up!

696
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,332
A brother like you!

697
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:14,207
She's also a girl like me.

698
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:20,415
As much as l love you,
Priya too love her brother.

699
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:21,999
May be more also.

700
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:25,332
l would be sad if anyone
separates me from you,

701
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:29,290
likewise Priya too would be sad
if anyone separates her brother.

702
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,415
l'll be with Prabhu,
you do the shopping.

703
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:47,290
As usual clean the stores.

704
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,207
Why are you so late?

705
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:54,499
l hate party as much
as l hate shopping.

706
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,957
What would you like to have?

707
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,624
What else?
- You tell me.

708
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:04,165
What's your dad saying?

01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,999
Look who is here?

710
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:21,707
Cool! You would've forgotten it
and he too!

711
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,624
No need to get involved
in each other's lives.

712
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,332
He's coming towards us!

713
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:35,124
May be on some otherjob.
- No, he's coming towards us.

714
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,499

Don't get angry!
She loves someone else.

01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:15,249
But l'll not chase and
torture her like you.

720
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:16,582
l love her sincerely.

721
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:20,540
l hope some day Priya will
understand my love.

722
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,999
l came here to tell you this.

723
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:25,332
Tell Priya l had inquired about her.

724
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,040
Finished shopping so quickly!

725
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,624
Didn't you bring anything for me?

726
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,749
Do you love anyone, Priya?

727
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:53,249
Yes, that is...

728
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,249
Do you love anyone?

What has happened to you?

730
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,249
Not today, l've been watching
since the day you came here.

731
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:03,582
You're no more yourself.

732
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:05,624
l'm your elder brother.

733
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,999

746
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:50,082
Would he not like you?

747
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:54,415
lf he doesn't like you,
l'll make him like you. Okay?

748
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:55,665
You don't worry.

lf that rogue manages to trap you,
l may not be able to bear it.

755
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,999
Who is that rogue?

756

01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,249
You talk very funny.

812
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:06,749
Brother-in-law is pulling your legs.
- Why?

lf l'm here for long,
there would be trouble.- Why?

821
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,624
Because l've lot of business,

822
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:31,707
What businesses?

823
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,624

Reliance? Ambani owns it, right?
He says he owns it.

l supply them materials.
- What do you supply?

828
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:55,707
Let me blabber something,
Rahul will manage later.

829
01:31:56,083 --> 01:32:00,457
Material means l grow vegetables,
they sell it,

01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:03,082
l pump out petrol, they sell it,

831
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,582

832
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,415
Don't you believe me?
You look shocked!

833
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,040
Shall l tell you frankly?
- Tell me.

834
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,165
First impression on seeing you
is you're a useless guy!

835
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:14,499
l didn't expect you're such
a big shot!

836
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,290
Your Priya is very lucky.

837
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:18,707
Who is this Priya between us?

838
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,415
Don't you know the girl you love?

839
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,249
Priya, my young sister.

840
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,665
ls Priya your sister?

841
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,749
l always call her as Pandu..

842
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:31,749
Very nice name sir.

843
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:35,082
Not yours, brother-in-law,
your phone is ringing.

844
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:38,040
Don't keep it there, it's affect
kidney, keep it here.

845
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,040
Brother-in-law is very careful.

846
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:42,374
What?

847
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,290
Has Shankar cheated us?

848
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:47,707
Go with few men and break his limbs.

849
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:50,957
Do you've to tell me this also?

850
01:32:57,541 --> 01:32:59,165
Who was it?

851
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,207
Sorry brother-in-law.

852
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:05,290
l can tolerate anything
but not cheating.

853
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,207
Hope he doesn't find me.

854
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,499
Brother-in-law isn't
suspecting us, right?

855
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:13,665
He knows you'd break limbs
if anyone cheats you.

856
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,790
Brother-in-law!
- Have you come?

857
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:20,040
l'm calling you here and
why are you looking back?

858
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:22,374
He's playing fun because
you're his brother-in-law.

859
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,457
Playing fun, right?

860
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:29,332
What was your feeling when you
met Priya for the first time?

861
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:30,707
lt's difficult to say.

862
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:35,165
How can he if you say Priya?
Say Pandu!

863
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,957
Priya means your Pandu.
- My Pandu.- My sister.

864
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:40,707
What was your feeling
when you first met her?

865
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:42,582
What did Priya tell you?
- Nothing.

866
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:44,082
l'll also not tell you anything.

867
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:46,499
Priya must tell first anything
that's between us.

868
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:49,124
l mean brother-in-law's idea is...

869
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:52,957
l'm getting nervous when you
whisper into his ears.

870
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:56,374
Say it openly what ever you want to.
l'll not be confused.

871
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,624
He's playing fun again.

872
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,624
Brother-in-law, l don't know how time is
flying away while talking to you.

873
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:04,582
When you come to know,
you'll come after my life.

874
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:05,749
l'll take leave.

875
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,624
Why are you insisting on
leaving, brother-in-law?

876
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,999
Please sit here,
let's talk for some time.

877
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:13,665
May be he's having some program
with Priya, l mean Pandu.

878
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:18,624
Finally one word, brother-in-law.
- Tell me.

879
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,582
My father will discuss about marriage.

880
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,457
l'll discuss about the financial aspect.

881
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:25,665
Tell me what do you want as dowry.
- l want my life.

882
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,082
What?

883
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,957
Pandu is my life.

884
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:31,749
Give your Pandu as dowry to me.

885
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,290
My heart is filled with happiness on
hearing your words, brother-in-law.

886
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,165
lf you know the truth,
your heart will stop.

887
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,207
l'll take leave now.

888
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:41,374
l like you very much, brother-in-law.

889
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,249
Will you ask me to marry you also?

890
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:47,499
Playing fun again.
- Let me leave with this happiness.

891
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:49,124
Playing fun!

892
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:02,332
Who are you?

893
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,040
Why did you come here?

894
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:13,540
Nobody is in home.

895
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:21,082
Did l ask you to take me to Goa?

896
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:25,582
Did l ask you to introduce me
to Jaya aunty as your wife?

897
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:30,249
Did l ask you to get me dressed
up beautifully in marriage?

898
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:33,957
Did l ask you to save
my life that night?

899
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:38,040
Did l ask you to take me
around Goa?

900
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:41,499
You did everything
without me asking for it,

901
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:45,665
why did you leave without telling
me what l was eagerly waiting?

902
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:11,040
Priya! O my dear, my heart is
drowned in your love...

903
01:37:11,333 --> 01:37:21,290
Do you know you're an island of
love in my lonely imaginary world?

904
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:26,790
Even wind touching you
would say l love you...

905
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:31,749
ln the smile of my sulking lover,
l see my love...

906
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:13,707
did my life seek help from you?

907
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:18,540
Did youth play hide
and seek with you?

908
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:24,082
lf you think thrill
is other name of love...

909
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:28,249
My lips will hide you...

910
01:38:28,458 --> 01:38:33,040
l'll not leave you alone,
l'll not let anything hurt you...

911
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:37,540
l'm the life of your dream...

912
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:39,707
What do you say?

913
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:53,124
l'm vast like the sky...
Can't you fall on me like shining stars?

914
01:39:53,333 --> 01:40:02,124
l'm flying in your mischief...
Can't you overwhelm me with your love?

915
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:07,207
l'll love you much more
than you think...

916
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:11,624
l'm there for you always, my love...

917
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,707
What would become of me
caught in your magic?

918
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:20,707
Hi brother!
- How did you write exam?

919
01:41:21,083 --> 01:41:22,082
Very well.

920
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,624
Sorry, l can't pick you up.

921
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,207
l'm going to airport to
pick up mom and dad.

922
01:41:27,416 --> 01:41:30,499
l can judge how happy you're
in your words.

923
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:34,040
l've asked Rahul to pick you up,
has he come?

924
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:35,624
He's here.

925
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:37,040
Can you please give
the phone to him.

926
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,040
Brother wants to talk to you.

927
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:45,290
No formalities between us, Shiva.

928
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:48,499
You're increasing petrol
prices every day,

929
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:52,415
it's very difficult, it's burning our
pockets as well as our hearts.

930
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:56,707
What? Don't keep phone there.
- Why sir?

931
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:59,624
lt's affect you.
- How do you know sir?

932
01:42:07,583 --> 01:42:11,082
l didn't want to disturb your exam
so didn't tell you about our problem.

933
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:13,040
What's the problem?

934
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:14,374
Your brother!

935
01:42:26,166 --> 01:42:27,582
What shall we do now?

936
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:32,415
Let's break up!

937
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:36,374
lt's difficult for us to unite,
your brother will not agree.

938
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:38,540
That's why l sent my friend
to your brother.

939
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:40,999
He's very good man,
he'll take good care ofyou.

940
01:42:41,208 --> 01:42:43,957
Your brother too liked him very much.
You'll also start liking him.

941
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:47,957
You, your brother and he,
all three of you can be happy.

942
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,665
Please forget me, Priya.

943
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,290
Why are you crying?

944
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:09,249
Where would l go leaving you?

945
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,707
For this hug, l played this drama.

946
01:43:15,166 --> 01:43:17,749
Hold me...hold me!
lf not l'll go.

947
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,999
Brother! Come fast! You carry on...

948
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:56,040
Why are you shouting?

949
01:44:56,250 --> 01:45:00,499
Rahul, this is the first chase
in my life.

950
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:02,207
First chase?

951
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:06,124
l never expected there would
be a chase in my life too.

952
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:16,582
This is the first and last
chase in our lives. Got it?

953
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,624
Then, this chase must be
most thrilling!

954
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,415
Shall we do one thing?
Shall we fly the car in air?

955
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:24,707
Shall we do another thing?

956
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:28,207
There's a pond,
let's plunge car into it for variety.

957
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:32,040
No Rahul, l don't know to swim.
Flying in air is better.

958
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:33,290
You...

959
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:46,249
0Come...come...

960
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,999
lfwe get caught now,
we're finished.

961
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,124
He's catching up!

962
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:52,207
Priya stop!

963
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:09,707
You'll die man!

964
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:35,165
Are you playing with me?

965
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:55,499
What's this?

966
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,665
This is a chase Rahul!

967
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:05,290
lsn't it good? l'll change it.

968
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:07,499
This is good.

969
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:13,374
What's this Rahul?
Shall l stop playing the song?

970
01:47:13,583 --> 01:47:15,665
Notjust the song,
you too stop talking.

971
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:17,165
Sit silently.

972
01:47:17,375 --> 01:47:20,499
Enjoying this dangerous chase!

973
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:23,749
lf you get caught,
you'll be in trouble.

974
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:30,124
3Bloody, you're finished today!

975
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:32,457
Stop...stop l'll take you to task!

976
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:49,749
Brother's jeep has slowed down.

977
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,457
lt has stopped!

978
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:56,165
Stopped?

979
01:47:57,125 --> 01:47:59,124
May be run out of petrol.

980
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:09,624
Our car too is slowing down.

981
01:48:11,458 --> 01:48:12,207
We're also running out of petrol.

982
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:16,415
Slowing down...stopping...
- Will it stop?

983
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:18,999
What happened?

984
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:22,582
l think we too have run out of petrol.

985
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,290
Not think, it's over!

986
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:44,582
Brother has got down.

987
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:50,624
Till now l thought he wouldn't catch up
but l'm scared now.

988
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:55,499
Whatever may happen between us,
don't get down from the car.

989
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:03,249
Rahul fast!

990
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:47,999
l didn't expect to get caught
so quickly.

991
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,082
l thought l would get some time
if l send another man in my place.

992
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:53,749
l've to make a new plan now.

993
01:50:54,416 --> 01:50:55,499
No need.

994
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:59,707
By now my mom and dad
would've reached home.- So what?

995
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,957
My brother fears only one in
this world, that's my father.

996
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:08,415
He shivers if my dad
looks at him angrily.

997
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:11,749
Father is not talking
to brother for 3 years.

998
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:15,040
He has come now forgiving him.

999
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:19,165
lfwe meet my father and
tell him everything.

1000
01:51:19,166 --> 01:51:22,207
No!
- Why?

1001
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:26,040
lfwe tell him,
your father may not forgive Shiva.

1002
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:30,457
lt's not correct to split them
for our union.

1003
01:51:32,083 --> 01:51:33,374
What shall we do now?

1004
01:51:33,583 --> 01:51:36,415
You don't do anything,
you trust me, right?

1005
01:51:38,416 --> 01:51:42,540
Then, do what ever your father
and brother ask you to do.

1006
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,999
Leave the rest to me.

1007
01:51:50,083 --> 01:51:51,415
Don't get down from car.

1008
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:06,082
Brother!

1009
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,624
Brother please no!

1010
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:26,999
Brother please...

1011
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:28,749
Sit inside!

1012
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:01,624
Sir, your father and mother are here.

1013
01:53:05,291 --> 01:53:07,165
This was when we went to Singapore.

1014
01:53:07,375 --> 01:53:09,165
Did he take you to Singapore too?

1015
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:13,374
Look, he has changed.
- l don't believe it.

1016
01:53:16,083 --> 01:53:20,665
Because of Rahul's sister,
dad stopped talking to me for 3 years.

1017
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:23,040
3 years!

1018
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:25,749
lf he comes to know about this matter,

1019
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:28,540
dad will never see me again
in this life.

1020
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:37,207
lf you or Rahul disturb their
happiness in these days,

1021
01:53:38,166 --> 01:53:39,665
l'll kill him immediately.

1022
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:49,207
l'll not tell daddy anything,
l'll do as you say.

1023
01:53:50,333 --> 01:53:52,749
You don't need to kill Rahul.

1024
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,457
Rahul told me to do as you say.

1025
01:53:56,666 --> 01:53:57,499
That's why!

1026
01:54:05,041 --> 01:54:06,582
What's that?
- Shiva is coming.

1027
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:29,290
How are you dad?
- l'm fine.

1028
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,749
Are you happy now?

1029
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:32,540
l don't have any regrets now, mom.

1030
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:48,999
Do you know him, Shiva?

1031
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:53,165
Father, he's...l don't know him.

1032
01:54:53,375 --> 01:54:55,499
He's alive, let's take him
to hospital immediately.

1033
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,040
We don't who he is, stay out of it.

1034
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:00,082
A man is dying and
you say stay away from him.

1035
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:02,124
He may die ifwe don't
take him to hospital.

1036
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:03,040
Call ambulance.

1037
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:06,082
1 lt'll take time for ambulance
to come here, father.

1038
01:55:06,333 --> 01:55:08,290
There's a hospital near by.

1039
01:55:09,125 --> 01:55:12,249
What are you watching?
Carry him.- Okay father.

1040
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:16,624
Be careful, carry him.

1041
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:19,249
Come.

1042
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:50,624
Who are you? What's your name?
Who beat you?

1043
01:55:55,166 --> 01:55:57,749
A man beat and left me on road.

1044
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:00,207
l didn't know where l was
and where to go,

1045
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:02,040
l entered the nearest house,

1046
01:56:02,291 --> 01:56:06,290
l swear l didn't know it
was your house!

1047
01:56:07,291 --> 01:56:11,207
Uncle, he is...
- My son Shiva!

1048
01:56:11,458 --> 01:56:14,707
He carried you to hospital.

1049
01:56:15,083 --> 01:56:18,415
Did you carry me?

1050
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:25,457
Who is she, uncle?
- My daughter Priya.

1051
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:32,499
She nursed you like her own meeting
doctors and buying your medicines.

1052
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:36,165
For my sake!

1053
01:56:38,333 --> 01:56:41,332
Who beat you?

1054
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:44,124
Tell me his name.
l'll see his end.

1055
01:56:44,333 --> 01:56:47,290
l'll break his limbs
and lock him up.

1056
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:06,040
Shiva, you're sweating,
increase the speed of fan.

1057
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:13,624
Tell me who he is,
what's the trouble?

1058
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,290
Like your Priya,
my sister too is very beautiful,

1059
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,290
while she was in college,
a rogue was torturing her,

1060
01:57:21,458 --> 01:57:25,582
tell me Shiva, what would you do
if anyone teases your sister?

1061
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:26,624
Please tell me.

1062
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,040
That is...
- My son would've bashed him.

1063
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:33,957
l too did the same, uncle.
l bashed him black and blue.

1064
01:57:34,416 --> 01:57:35,207
Then?

1065
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:41,124
Flashback is quite long,
for some energy...

1066
01:57:41,333 --> 01:57:43,624
Brother, juice please.

1067
01:57:48,541 --> 01:57:50,749
What are you looking at?
Give him the juice.

1068
01:57:57,333 --> 01:58:00,457
Poor boy can't hold it,
help him to drink.

1069
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:01,957
Okay father.

1070
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:04,582
Please co-operate.

1071
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:11,665
Did you make the juice, Priya?
- Yes.

1072
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:14,499
Juice is also very sweet like you.

1073
01:58:15,291 --> 01:58:17,790
You beat him and what next?

1074
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:20,582
Then, l fell in love with a girl, uncle.

1075
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,207
You know about the problems
lovers face now, uncle.

1076
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:27,124
l got it, her parents don't like it
and sent men to attack you.

1077
01:58:27,333 --> 01:58:27,999
Am l right?

1078
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:30,499
Not her parents, it's her brother
who doesn't like me.

1079
01:58:30,708 --> 01:58:31,707
What's his problem?

1080
01:58:32,083 --> 01:58:34,665
l told you about beating
up a man, right?- Yes.

1081
01:58:34,666 --> 01:58:37,415
That's him!
He's that man!

1082
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:41,040
He's seeking revenge by
becoming a hurdle in our love.

1083
01:58:41,041 --> 01:58:42,457
Bloody idiot!

1084
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:47,624
You beat him 3 years ago,
why can't you bash him again?

1085
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,999
How can l beat him?
He's our family member, right?

1086
01:58:50,208 --> 01:58:51,707
Family member? How?

1087
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:56,040
Uncle, if l marry his sister, he'll
become my brother-in-law, right?

1088
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:57,499
lt's not good to beat brother-in-law.

1089
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,540
We've to live together, right?
Ain't l right, Shiva?

1090
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:07,957
You're right, l like you.
You've to learn a lot from him.

1091
01:59:08,166 --> 01:59:12,124
What are you saying uncle?
l've so much to learn from them.

1092
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:15,207
They both are Gods who
saved my life, uncle.

1093
01:59:32,208 --> 01:59:34,999
He's bring back to life
the old Shiva in me.

1094
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:37,665
No!

1095
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,290
l've changed.

1096
01:59:42,083 --> 01:59:44,290
Please let me be like this,
it's good.

1097
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,290
Are you denying me my wish, brother?

1098
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:57,582
No, l'll accept anyone in this world,
but not him!

1099
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:01,374
He told you to do
what ever l say, right?

1100
02:00:02,166 --> 02:00:03,957
Go back to Delhi with mom and dad.

1101
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:06,749
Go back.

1102
02:00:09,416 --> 02:00:10,457
l'll go brother.

1103
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:17,040
Not because Rahul told me
but you told me to go.

1104
02:00:18,291 --> 02:00:22,290
l love you as much as l love Rahul.

1105
02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:35,290
We'll confirm the tickets,
you stay here.

1106
02:00:35,541 --> 02:00:38,290
Don't go away, stay put here.
- Okay.

1107
02:00:48,083 --> 02:00:49,040
Why?

1108
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:52,040
You're sending Priya too along
with your parents to Delhi,

1109
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,374
for that!

1110
02:00:53,583 --> 02:00:54,374
So what?

1111
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:56,207
Turn back and see!

1112
02:00:57,708 --> 02:01:00,582
l'm also going to Delhi in
the same flight.

1113
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:02,499
Here's the ticket!

1114
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:09,290
You're an hurdle for everything
but in Delhi nobody can stop me.

1115
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:14,290
Once your father leaves to office,
l'll romance with your sister.

1116
02:01:14,541 --> 02:01:16,082
Hey you...

1117
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:26,165
Tickets are confirmed,
we'll leave now.

1118
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:27,374
Cancel it dad.

1119
02:01:27,583 --> 02:01:30,082
She said she has some work there.

1120
02:01:30,333 --> 02:01:31,707
Geetha called me just now.
- Why?

1121
02:01:32,083 --> 02:01:33,249
That is...that is...

1122
02:01:34,416 --> 02:01:35,957
Geetha is pregnant, dad!

1123
02:01:36,166 --> 02:01:39,040
Why are you hesitating
to share happy news?

1124
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:44,374
We've been waiting to hear this news.

1125
02:01:44,583 --> 02:01:45,582
l'm very happy.

1126
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:47,082
Why are you rushing?

1127
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:49,415
Aren't you eager to meet daughter-in-law?

1128
02:01:49,416 --> 02:01:52,624
He too is eager to meet his wife.
lsn't it?

1129
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:56,999
Where are you all going?

1130
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,665
We were going back to Delhi
but cancelled it.

1131
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:01,207
ls it? Why?
- My Shiva is going to become a father.

1132
02:02:03,125 --> 02:02:08,499
That's really happy news!

1133
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,290
l wish you've a son just like you.

1134
02:02:18,083 --> 02:02:20,040
Enough...enough...

1135
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:22,499
Father, we're getting late,
he's getting late to flight.

1136
02:02:22,708 --> 02:02:25,165
Shall we go?
- Flight? For me?

1137
02:02:25,375 --> 02:02:26,499
No!

1138
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:28,707
l came here to send off a friend.

1139
02:02:30,083 --> 02:02:31,540
What's that?
- Ticket?

1140
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,415
l picked it up from ground
to write a number.

1141
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:45,540
Father, wait here, l get the vehicle.

1142
02:02:49,291 --> 02:02:50,707
What happened, Shiva?

1143
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:52,290
Any problem?
- What happened?

1144
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,749
Your mother and sister
are waiting there.

1145
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:56,249
No problem, just starting trouble,
it'll start

1146
02:02:56,458 --> 02:02:57,040
l've a car, let's go in it.
- No need!

1147
02:02:59,708 --> 02:03:02,207
l think petrol pipe got
blocked again, dad.

1148
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:03,624
Okay see it.

1149
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,582
Please listen to me, leave it.

1150
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:16,999
l know everything, please be quiet.

1151
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,665
Do it fast, they're waiting.

1152
02:03:19,041 --> 02:03:21,040
Please listen to me.

1153
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,207
What happened?

1154
02:03:25,625 --> 02:03:29,374
l told you, is it necessary?

1155
02:03:29,375 --> 02:03:30,499
Uncle, please tell him.

1156
02:03:30,708 --> 02:03:33,124
You wait, you do it fast.

1157
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:36,582
Why are you asking him
to do it, uncle?

1158
02:03:36,791 --> 02:03:39,499
Please it's not good!

1159
02:03:39,708 --> 02:03:41,707
Sip it fast!

1160
02:03:45,208 --> 02:03:48,624
l think petrol is contaminated.

1161
02:03:49,166 --> 02:03:52,332
lt's smelly!
- lt'll be smelly, l know it.

1162
02:03:52,541 --> 02:03:54,457
They're mixing petrol with something.

1163
02:03:54,458 --> 02:03:57,332
You don't listen to me, Shiva.

1164
02:03:58,416 --> 02:03:59,290
Come uncle, let's go in my car.

1165
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:02,582
lt's new car and AC too.
Come Shiva.

1166
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:11,707
How is your girl friend?

1167
02:04:12,791 --> 02:04:13,540
Very good, uncle.

1168
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:15,082
Girl friend?

1169
02:04:15,333 --> 02:04:18,415
l didn't tell you, right?
He loves a girl.- ls it?

1170
02:04:18,625 --> 02:04:21,165
He fell into our home after he
got beaten up by her brother.

1171
02:04:21,375 --> 02:04:24,124
Really?
- Yes, he beat me black and blue.

1172
02:04:24,333 --> 02:04:27,749
Oh no! Please bring her once to home.
l want to meet her.

1173
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:29,707
l'll definitely bring her to you.

1174
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:35,332
How will she be?
- She's like a golden doll!

1175
02:04:36,333 --> 02:04:38,290
She has no resemblance
with her brother.

1176
02:04:38,541 --> 02:04:41,290
He's a worst fellow,
a rogue to the core.

1177
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:46,249
Abuse him, he must be...
- Mother, no need of it.

1178
02:04:46,458 --> 02:04:49,540
What else then?
Will he beat him for loving his sister?

1179
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:53,540
How could he dare beat
after meeting him?- Right?

1180
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:58,665
Let me get him, let him lose
the hands that beat you.

1181
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:01,499
Mother, please stop it now.
- Aunt, he kicked too!

1182
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:05,999
May he lose his legs too!
- Mother, please stop it.

1183
02:05:06,208 --> 02:05:09,457
No use in scolding him.
- You're right dad.

1184
02:05:09,666 --> 02:05:13,124
We must scold his parents,
they didn't raise him well.

1185
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:16,290
We must tonsure their heads
and take them on a donkey.

1186
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,540
Do her parents like you?

1187
02:05:20,041 --> 02:05:23,124
l'm doing all this to win
their favour, aunty.

1188
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:30,457
Move Priya.

1189
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,332
You thank Rahul and come.

1190
02:05:37,125 --> 02:05:39,499
Have parents-in-law left?
Was the flight on time?

1191
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:41,540
They're outside.
- What?

1192
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:45,499
Why?
- l lied to my parents.

1193
02:05:46,375 --> 02:05:47,749
l told them you're pregnant.

1194
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,707
l know you're hurt but please
don't tell anyone it's a lie.

1195
02:05:53,375 --> 02:05:56,124
Do you know what you're saying?

1196
02:05:56,333 --> 02:05:59,165
You know we've been
waiting years for a child.

1197
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:02,207
Have you turned into a joke
and drama?

1198
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:04,499
How can l lie to them?

1199
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:06,415
Sister-in-law!

1200
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,707
l'm extremely happy dear.
What great news you've given us!

1201
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:17,999
l was never so happy in life, dear.

1202
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,082
Geetha, you'll take rest fully.
They'll take care of everything.

1203
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:54,624
Are you fine, Divya?

1204
02:07:56,166 --> 02:07:57,415
Why are you shocked?

1205
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,499
Didn't recognise me?

1206
02:08:03,333 --> 02:08:04,999
l know you've not forgotten me.

1207
02:08:06,375 --> 02:08:07,582
But l've forgotten you.

1208
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,665
Your brother has come back
to scratch the old wounds.

1209
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:14,040
l loved you then,

1210
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:16,415
your brother loves my sister now,

1211
02:08:17,333 --> 02:08:18,332
account is settled,

1212
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,499
your brother beat me and
warned me to leave you alone,

1213
02:08:23,125 --> 02:08:24,124
l left you,

1214
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:27,957
now l beat your brother and
warned him to leave my sister,

1215
02:08:30,125 --> 02:08:31,374
but he hasn't left her,

1216
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,999
accounts are not tallying,

1217
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:38,290
if your brother chases my sister
in the name of love,

1218
02:08:39,333 --> 02:08:40,207
to settle the account,

1219
02:08:40,416 --> 02:08:42,999
l may have to start chasing you
in the name of love.

1220
02:08:43,208 --> 02:08:45,457
You know how my love would be!

1221
02:08:46,541 --> 02:08:48,290
Put some sense into your brother.

1222
02:08:49,291 --> 02:08:53,582
Whether we should meet again or not
depends on your brother's decision.

1223
02:08:53,791 --> 02:08:55,082
You're not hurt, right?

1224
02:09:20,166 --> 02:09:21,457
Did he do like that?

1225
02:09:21,708 --> 02:09:24,707
Did he threaten your sister?
We mustn't spare him alive.

1226
02:09:27,125 --> 02:09:30,332
Father, what had really happened was...

1227
02:09:30,541 --> 02:09:33,040
l can't believe what Rahul said,

1228
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:35,040
tell him what did he do?

1229
02:09:36,541 --> 02:09:40,457
Shiva, l'm giving up my love for her.

1230
02:09:42,333 --> 02:09:44,374
Today her brother threatened
my sister.

1231
02:09:45,125 --> 02:09:47,249
He threatened to stop
loving his sister.

1232
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:51,290
My family is more important
to me than my love.

1233
02:09:55,333 --> 02:09:59,332
Will you meekly surrender for his threat?
Are we not with you?

1234
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,165
You're marrying that girl, okay?

1235
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:07,707
That's not right, dad!
- Why?

1236
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:12,957
No father, from what Rahul says,
l think he'll go to any length.

1237
02:10:13,166 --> 02:10:16,040
He threatened his sister now,
tomorrow he may beat his mother,

1238
02:10:17,083 --> 02:10:18,624
may be kill Rahul too,

1239
02:10:19,125 --> 02:10:23,707
l think it's better to give up love
than to hook up with such rogues?

1240
02:10:24,083 --> 02:10:27,290
Are you asking Rahul to kill
his love fearing his threats?

1241
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:30,249
Rahul is very good boy, dad.

1242
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:32,415
He says family is over above love!

1243
02:10:32,625 --> 02:10:37,290
How can such a good boy be
happy in a rogue's family?

1244
02:10:37,541 --> 02:10:39,707
Rahul will find a better girl than her.

1245
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:42,499
lt necessary, let's find a girl
for him ourselves.

1246
02:10:47,291 --> 02:10:48,749
Any how...

1247
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:56,374
l remember my father
on seeing you, uncle,

1248
02:10:56,375 --> 02:10:58,749
l felt sharing with you would
reduce my burden.

1249
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:02,415
Sorry if l had disturbed you.

1250
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:03,707
You were great!

1251
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:25,707
How dare he plays me using my dad!

1252
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:29,165
Look, how l hit back using his sister!

1253
02:11:29,375 --> 02:11:31,290
l hit his weakest point.

1254
02:11:31,583 --> 02:11:34,499
Give me one more large.
- For me too!

1255
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:37,999
Father, just for relaxation...

1256
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,207
Make me also a double large.

1257
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:43,207
You've a double large only
when you're happy, father.

1258
02:11:43,416 --> 02:11:46,249
What's the reason, dad?
- You!- Me?

1259
02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:48,540
l had a doubt whether
you've changed or not,

1260
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:50,082
from today l've no doubt.

1261
02:11:50,333 --> 02:11:51,624
What did he do to clear it, uncle?

1262
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,624
The way he convinced Rahul...

1263
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:56,165
Very good!

1264
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:58,707
l like you son!
- lt's not my greatness, dad.

1265
02:11:58,708 --> 02:11:59,749
l told him the fact, dad.

1266
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,124
l've seen many people like her brother.

1267
02:12:02,333 --> 02:12:05,124
l told him to be careful, that's all.

1268
02:12:05,416 --> 02:12:07,499
l'm not talking about the
advice you gave to Rahul.

1269
02:12:08,083 --> 02:12:10,665
The hint you gave me, right?
l'm talking about that.

1270
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:12,749
What hint did l give you, dad?

1271
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:15,290
Just recollect what you
said about Rahul!

1272
02:12:18,625 --> 02:12:20,999
l said Rahul is good boy and
he would get a good girl.

1273
02:12:21,208 --> 02:12:22,457
Then?

1274
02:12:23,291 --> 02:12:25,582
lf necessary, let's find a girl
for him ourselves.

1275
02:12:25,791 --> 02:12:29,124
l got it why you said like that.
- What did you understand from it, uncle?

1276
02:12:29,125 --> 02:12:29,582
Didn't get it yet?
He said that our Priya.

1277
02:12:29,583 --> 02:12:38,374
l like Rahul very much.
When you said today morning how much

1278
02:12:38,375 --> 02:12:42,040
l got an idea then Rahul would
be perfect match for Priya.

1279
02:12:43,166 --> 02:12:45,082
Now that his love has also failed.

1280
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,582
We can meet his parents with
this marriage proposal.

1281
02:12:46,791 --> 02:12:51,665
What do you say?
- Father...not that...

1282
02:12:52,041 --> 02:12:54,540
Priya, come here!
- Coming.

1283
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,290
Come dear.
Sit here dear.

1284
02:12:57,375 --> 02:12:58,249
What's it dad?

1285
02:12:58,458 --> 02:13:01,040
There were two reasons
to come to Hyderabad.

1286
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:05,374
One to meet your brother and
second to find a groom for you.

1287
02:13:06,333 --> 02:13:08,124
l like Rahul very much.

1288
02:13:09,333 --> 02:13:10,999
What's your opinion?

1289
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:13,707
That is you...marriage...

1290
02:13:14,083 --> 02:13:17,165
You wanted to marry after PG, right?

1291
02:13:19,666 --> 02:13:23,040
lf brother says so,
that's my idea too.

1292
02:13:23,416 --> 02:13:24,707
lt seems she'll marry
after 2 years, dad.

1293
02:13:25,083 --> 02:13:26,665
May be it was then.

1294
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:29,749
Now your brother is
asking you, accept!

1295
02:13:31,625 --> 02:13:35,707
Ask him to say it, dad.
- Not a big deal.

1296
02:13:36,083 --> 02:13:41,499
He gave me this idea.
Tell her to marry Rahul.

1297
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,249
father, l think brother
doesn't like Rahul.

1298
02:13:47,458 --> 02:13:50,499
Nothing like that.
He loves Rahul very much, right?

1299
02:13:51,250 --> 02:13:53,332
Very much!
- Then, tell her.

1300
02:13:53,333 --> 02:13:56,415
Tell her to marry Rahul.
- l'll tell her, father.

1301
02:13:56,416 --> 02:14:01,165
Priya, you marry Rahul!

1302
02:14:03,291 --> 02:14:04,082
Okay dad.

1303
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:10,040
O my dear, l'm nothing
without you...

1304
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:14,165
l'm mad in your love...

1305
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:55,040
Sensational! Your dark kohl
laced eyes are sensational...

1306
02:14:55,291 --> 02:15:01,582
My heart is eagerly waiting
for you, my dear...

1307
02:15:02,083 --> 02:15:06,249
For you my dear...

1308
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:15,332
My heart says l love you...

1309
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:21,707
Come what so ever l'll wait
for you, my love...

1310
02:15:22,458 --> 02:15:24,540
For you my love...

1311
02:15:25,041 --> 02:15:29,540
My words and my silence
is for you only...

1312
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:55,707
Cuckoo will not keep quiet
and is singing new songs...

1313
02:15:56,083 --> 02:16:00,415
Let this flight in the world of bliss
carry on till our marriage...

1314
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:05,540
Where ever l may go,
l'll reach you only...

1315
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:10,082
May l entangled with you forever...

1316
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,124
My love is fragrant flower
spreading fragrance around me...

1317
02:16:16,333 --> 02:16:20,499
Love is like that...
everything is wonderful...

1318
02:16:20,708 --> 02:16:22,707
Mornings are for you...

1319
02:16:23,083 --> 02:16:25,290
Moonbeam is for you...

1320
02:16:25,541 --> 02:16:27,999
Sweet nothings are for you...

1321
02:16:28,208 --> 02:16:30,999
My life is for you...

1322
02:16:51,541 --> 02:16:56,332
lts not easy to write a simile that's
not written in love stories...

1323
02:16:56,541 --> 02:17:01,082
Words have gone silent and silence
is magical, feelings are plenty...

1324
02:17:01,333 --> 02:17:06,499
Your smile is saying
it loudly, my dear...

1325
02:17:06,708 --> 02:17:10,707
Enough of confusion, be mine...

1326
02:17:11,291 --> 02:17:16,582
Even if our love is written is air,
it won't wither..

1327
02:17:16,791 --> 02:17:20,999
Though drowned in waves,
it'll reach the shore...

1328
02:17:21,208 --> 02:17:31,165
My love is for you...
- For you...

1329
02:17:53,541 --> 02:17:55,374
Leave it!

1330
02:17:56,625 --> 02:17:59,332
What ever you do,
he turns into his favour.

1331
02:18:00,166 --> 02:18:01,165
Leave it for Priya.

1332
02:18:02,083 --> 02:18:05,207
He's alive still because
Priya loves him.

1333
02:18:05,416 --> 02:18:06,582
l threatened his sister
but he didn't give her up.

1334
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:08,582
l bashed him but he didn't
give her up.

1335
02:18:10,291 --> 02:18:11,415
There's only one option left now.

1336
02:18:13,375 --> 02:18:14,290
To kill him!

1337
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:16,249
What are you saying?

1338
02:18:16,708 --> 02:18:17,415
Yes.

1339
02:18:19,250 --> 02:18:21,040
l'll kill Rahul!

1340
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,207
What will you achieve if you
go to jail after killing him?

1341
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:32,415
lts important that he dies,
no rule that you must kill him, right?

1342
02:18:35,625 --> 02:18:36,332
How?

1343
02:18:46,666 --> 02:18:49,040
ls it you?
- Come in.

1344
02:18:51,541 --> 02:18:55,707
Brother...brother...
Prabhu has sent him, brother.

1345
02:19:04,333 --> 02:19:05,290
Sit down, Shiva.

1346
02:19:12,291 --> 02:19:13,374
He's handsome.

1347
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:14,957
Kill him?

1348
02:19:15,291 --> 02:19:18,249
How much?
- Rs.10 lakhs.

1349
02:19:18,708 --> 02:19:20,332
Take full payment.

1350
02:19:21,208 --> 02:19:22,499
Count it.
- Okay brother.

1351
02:19:22,708 --> 02:19:26,665
You don't misunderstand me.
- Details are behind the photo.

1352
02:19:30,708 --> 02:19:36,040
Brother...brother...
Be careful!

1353
02:19:38,083 --> 02:19:39,665
How did fall down?
- l don't know brother.

1354
02:19:40,041 --> 02:19:41,165
What the hell were you doing?

1355
02:19:41,375 --> 02:19:45,290
There are so many here,
can't you take care of my brother?

1356
02:19:46,583 --> 02:19:47,499
What?

1357
02:19:47,708 --> 02:19:49,707
Got him?
Did you get him?

1358
02:19:51,083 --> 02:19:52,082
How many more days?

1359
02:19:52,333 --> 02:19:54,040
How long will you search for him?

1360
02:19:54,458 --> 02:19:56,290
How long have you been
searching for him?

1361
02:20:03,166 --> 02:20:07,499
Comb the entire area,
find his place, get his details,

1362
02:20:07,708 --> 02:20:08,999
l must get every information
about him...

1363
02:20:09,208 --> 02:20:13,082
lf you don't come with him,
l'll kill you all.

1364
02:20:14,375 --> 02:20:15,290
Brother...

1365
02:20:16,625 --> 02:20:19,124
What happened to him?
Call ambulance. Call!

1366
02:20:19,333 --> 02:20:21,207
Call!

1367
02:20:22,708 --> 02:20:25,040
What happened?

1368
02:20:25,041 --> 02:20:26,665
Look at me!

1369
02:20:27,041 --> 02:20:27,499
Brother!

1370
02:20:37,541 --> 02:20:39,499
Do you know him?

1371
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:41,499
ls it he who beat you?

1372
02:20:50,083 --> 02:20:52,124
Yourjob will be done,
you can go. Go!

1373
02:20:52,125 --> 02:20:53,624
lsn't the payment enough?
Ask me more.

1374
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,415
l'm going to kill him for my sake
not for you. Go away!

1375
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:01,499
lf you want ask more money,
don't say you'll do it for free.

1376
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,582
Are you doubting my intention?
Won't you believe me?

1377
02:21:05,791 --> 02:21:08,707
Come...come....
Look at him!

1378
02:21:09,083 --> 02:21:10,624
Look at the plight of my brother.

1379
02:21:11,416 --> 02:21:14,040
He went to Goa and
came back like this.

1380
02:21:14,291 --> 02:21:16,540
He went after some girl
in the beach,

1381
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:19,374
won't youth be mischief?

1382
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:23,332
He beat my brother mercilessly.

1383
02:21:24,083 --> 02:21:26,457
l'm madly searching for him.

1384
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,582
l found him because of you.

1385
02:21:28,583 --> 02:21:30,624
When did it happen?
- About a week.

1386
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:34,207
Yourjob will be done, you go!

1387
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:45,290
l got him at last!
Bring him to me in 30 minutes! Go!

1388
02:21:50,291 --> 02:21:53,040
What happened in Goa?

1389
02:21:53,583 --> 02:21:55,082
That is...
- What happened in Goa beach?

1390
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:57,957
Tell me the truth.

1391
02:22:20,333 --> 02:22:23,207
Brother!

1392
02:22:32,750 --> 02:22:34,665
How dare you touch my sister?

1393
02:22:35,291 --> 02:22:36,332
Where are you?

1394
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:37,290
Brother!

1395
02:22:46,375 --> 02:22:48,040
Kill him boys!

1396
02:22:55,166 --> 02:22:58,290
Brother!

1397
02:23:12,666 --> 02:23:14,999
Brother...
- What happened to Shiva?

1398
02:23:15,208 --> 02:23:16,707
Please listen to this!

1399
02:23:23,291 --> 02:23:24,499
How dare you beat us!

1400
02:23:24,750 --> 02:23:27,374
l'll not spare you alive!

1401
02:23:29,208 --> 02:23:31,249
Where did Shiva go?
- l don't know.

1402
02:23:31,458 --> 02:23:33,332
When did he leave home?
- About an hour.

1403
02:23:33,541 --> 02:23:34,499
Okay, listen carefully.

1404
02:23:34,708 --> 02:23:37,040
Don't cut this conference call,
Keep the phone on.

1405
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,332
l'll bring your brother.
Okay?

1406
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:41,207
Hold him boys!

1407
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:07,290
Listen carefully, l don't have time.

1408
02:24:07,541 --> 02:24:08,957
l want a number to be
traced immediately,

1409
02:24:09,166 --> 02:24:10,290
note the number.

1410
02:24:22,333 --> 02:24:26,499
lt's in Dhoolpet tower!
- Dhoolpet tower?

1411
02:24:50,666 --> 02:24:52,457
Hey stop!

1412
02:24:54,291 --> 02:24:55,540
Don't kill him now!

1413
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:58,582
First the man who beat
my brother must come here.

1414
02:24:58,791 --> 02:25:01,207
Shiva, you wanted him dead.

1415
02:25:01,416 --> 02:25:06,290
l'll kill him as you watch.
Then l'll kill you.

1416
02:25:11,375 --> 02:25:13,249
Keep an eye till then.

1417
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,999
Where are you coming from?
- From Afzal Gunj.

1418
02:25:36,208 --> 02:25:38,040
Can you guide me back to that place?
- Okay.

1419
02:25:38,541 --> 02:25:41,290
Go straight and turn left,

1420
02:25:44,208 --> 02:25:48,665
further up there's a street,
turn left again,

1421
02:25:49,250 --> 02:25:52,040
there's temple of Goddess Mother,
turn right there,

1422
02:25:56,541 --> 02:26:00,040
further straight you'll see a place
where they make idols,

1423
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:01,707
turn left there,

1424
02:26:06,375 --> 02:26:09,290
further up you'll see a barber shop,

1425
02:26:10,083 --> 02:26:13,999
take the street opposite to it,
straight up it's Afzal Gunj!

1426
02:26:33,375 --> 02:26:34,624
Why haven't they come yet with him?

1427
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,540
No use in trusting those fools,
l'll go and get him myself.

1428
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,624
Come on boys!

1429
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,999
You both stay back here.
Keep an eye on him.

1430
02:27:15,666 --> 02:27:18,707
Where is Shiva?
- Strange! l'm really lucky today!

1431
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:48,207
Where is Shiva?

1432
02:28:01,541 --> 02:28:03,290
l don't get one thing.

1433
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:06,040
He came here with money
to kill you,

1434
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:09,499
and you came here searching
to save him,

1435
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:11,332
but l got one thing clearly,

1436
02:28:11,541 --> 02:28:14,249
for that girl you both beat my brother,

1437
02:28:14,708 --> 02:28:18,540
l'll get that girl here and rape her
as you watch it,

1438
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:24,165
notjuts me l'll have her gang
raped by all my men here.

1439
02:28:24,166 --> 02:28:27,582
Let me what the hell can you do!
Go boys! Get her!

1440
02:28:31,333 --> 02:28:34,999
You must cross me first
to reach her!

1441
02:29:42,333 --> 02:29:45,999
lt's not a gang rape
if ten men rape a girl,

1442
02:29:46,208 --> 02:29:49,707
when a single man comes and
bashes up 10 men like you,

1443
02:29:50,083 --> 02:29:51,749
that's known as gang rape!

1444
02:30:28,375 --> 02:30:30,415
What's this?
Why did you do like this?

1445
02:30:30,708 --> 02:30:34,040
What happened was...
- l know what had happened!

1446
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:35,040
What did Rahul tell you?

1447
02:30:35,291 --> 02:30:37,374
He told me about you
approaching Kala.

1448
02:30:37,583 --> 02:30:40,290
Sorry father.
- Why say sorry, son?

1449
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:43,749
You were quite adventurous,
l didn't know till Rahul told me.

1450
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:45,207
What did he do, father?

1451
02:30:45,541 --> 02:30:46,582
You don't know, right?

1452
02:30:46,791 --> 02:30:49,457
The man who beat Rahul,
that girl's brother,

1453
02:30:49,666 --> 02:30:52,374
he paid a goon Kala to kill Rahul,

1454
02:30:52,583 --> 02:30:55,999
and Shiva risked his life
and saved Rahul's life.

1455
02:30:56,208 --> 02:30:58,415
You could've told me before
taking this risk, son.

1456
02:30:58,416 --> 02:30:59,457
Where is Rahul?

1457
02:31:01,416 --> 02:31:04,665
Brother-in-law...brother-in-law...
- Me?

1458
02:31:05,041 --> 02:31:07,040
Please come in brother-in-law,
let's discuss inside.

1459
02:31:07,291 --> 02:31:09,082
No Shiva, l'll go.

1460
02:31:09,333 --> 02:31:11,165
Please come in.
- No Shiva.

1461
02:31:11,375 --> 02:31:12,040
Be careful!

1462
02:31:12,291 --> 02:31:14,082
How come lace got untied now?

1463
02:31:14,333 --> 02:31:16,082
l'll tie.

1464
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:22,249
Please forgive me.

1465
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:23,957
Please marry my sister, brother-in-law.

1466
02:31:24,166 --> 02:31:26,332
Please Shiva, neither l want you
nor your sister.

1467
02:31:26,541 --> 02:31:29,290
l don't want this marriage.
- Brother! Let him go!

1468
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:31,249
You go away!
You go!

1469
02:31:31,458 --> 02:31:34,665
l was playing fun.
- You go!

1470
02:31:35,041 --> 02:31:38,082
Stop Priya!
Come...come, brother-in-law!

1471
02:31:38,333 --> 02:31:40,040
We're all one family!
Take it easy!

1472
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:42,124
Hold it properly! We'll get wet!

1473
02:31:42,125 --> 02:31:43,707
l'll be back in a moment!
- Brother-in-law!

1474
02:31:47,125 --> 02:31:50,332
You're very funny!

1475
02:31:51,000 --> 02:33:29,000
A PuLi-DDR Presentation ;)
