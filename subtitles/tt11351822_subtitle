♫ Uravugal Thodarkathai from Aval Appadithan (1978). ♫

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
I didn't ask much of life.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
A cigarette in one hand.

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
A beer in the other.

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
A beautiful girl on my shoulder.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
An even more beautiful sunset.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,560
And get lost in her eyes as she admires the sunset.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Hello?

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Hello, Dato!

10
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
How are you, Dato?

11
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
**** you Dato!

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Is that so?

13
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,440
Anirudh Sir is in Malaysia, right?

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Could you please find out when he's free?

15
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,200
I'd like to invite him over to my house for dinner.

16
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
All right, Dato.

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Isn't it our duty to honour such a great musician?

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
My wife and daughter are big fans.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Thank you, Dato!

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
It's short RM33.

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
That's for your beer.

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
What's this for?

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Tips.

24
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Kuala Lumpur City.

25
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,200
A concrete jungle of a million animals masquerading as
humans.

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,640
To date, 324 people have committed suicide in Kuala Lumpur.

27
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
I will be the 325th person.

28
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
If I delay any longer, I may end up being the 326th.

29
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Before committing suicide you're supposed to tell someone
why you're doing it.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
It's a ritual.

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,080
I'm not a fan of writing letters.

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
So I'm going to pour my heart out to you instead.

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
But don’t expect me to tell you the whole truth.

34
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Because we don’t know each other.

35
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
So please, don’t laugh at me.

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
♫ Aadavarellam Aadavaralam from Karuppu Panam (1964). ♫

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You see, I’m a lonely man.

38
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,920
I don’t have many friends.

39
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,280
My roommates are a lizard and two cockroaches.

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,840
A rat used to drop by once in a while.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Since it came to see me so often,

42
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I adopted it as my pet.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I even named it.

44
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Tiger.

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,080
But Tiger got run over one day.

46
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,760
To cure my grief, I drank for the first time in my life.

47
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
If you ask me who my best friend is these days,

48
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
I can only point to my friend - Alcohol.

49
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
This is Jasmine.

50
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Jasmine Vasudevan. My ex-girlfriend.

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
I was devastated when we broke up.

52
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,720
She gave me the “It’s me, not you” bullshit.

53
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Lying ****.

54
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
But something good came out of all this heartache.

55
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I made friends with Gudang Garam cigarettes.

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,440
Wise men said its best to mend a broken heart with
cigarettes.

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Bad advice.

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I just ended up screwing up my lungs along with my broken
heart.

59
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,960
8 letters, 124 missed calls, 48 messages, 13 e-mails.

60
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
I even tried calling her from a public phone.

61
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,440
But I was so naïve back then.

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,320
I didn’t know you could create a fake Facebook account.

63
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
In the end, that's how I found out.

64
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,840
She was dating a bloody fair pig by the name of Dr. Karthik.

65
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Doctors. A menace to Tamil society.

66
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
May Dr. Karthik die a horrible death.

67
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
On nights such as this, when I'm drunk and emotional, I
imagine...

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,480
♫ You used to long for my touch. ♫

69
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,480
-♫ Now all you do is push me away. ♫
-...in a light drizzle, holding a red umbrella,

70
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
-♫ My pain and sorrow ♫
-Jasmine will come looking for me.

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,520
♫ My pain and sorrow ♫

72
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,920
♫ will lessen with time. ♫

73
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000
♫ I never thought ♫

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,480
♫ they'd only get worse with time. ♫

75
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
♫ The heavens wept. ♫

76
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,520
♫ Winds scattered the earth. ♫

77
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,480
-♫ As I watched you walk away, ♫
-She'll knock on my door.

78
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,760
♫ I swear I did not shed a tear. ♫

79
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
♫ On a beautiful Sunday, ♫

80
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
♫ you walked in like a goddess. ♫

81
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,120
♫ With your scent, ♫

82
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,120
-♫ you come to me upon the wind. ♫
-She'll ask for my forgiveness and kiss my dry lips.

83
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,000
I’ll say, “A kiss won't suffice.”

84
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
She’ll smile coyly.

85
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,840
In this very same bed, our naked bodies will merge as one
again.

86
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I can only imagine such things.

87
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,720
♫ I’m a Bangladeshi in Malaysia♫

88
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,680
♫ Times are very hard now♫

89
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
♫ It’s hard to make a living♫

90
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,680
♫ You have the luxury of leisure only once you’re rich♫

91
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,680
♫ When you become rich you must know God♫

92
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,720
♫ You don’t have the luxury of leisure when you’re poor♫

93
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,320
The son of a ***** next door sleeps with a nameless
prostitute.

94
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,000
Done so soon? It hasn’t been more than 10 minutes.

95
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,680
"Kill my desire or Kill me." says Bharathi.

96
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,240
Easier said than done, Mr. Big Time Poet.

97
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
It's a terrible world we live in.

98
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,000
How long do you expect a 27-year-old boy to remain
steadfast?

99
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:49,520

102

♫ What is there to boast about?♫

103
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:14,240
♫ What a wicked life!♫

104
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,360
Is Koli (Chicken) home?

105
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Tell him I'm not home.

106
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I can hear you loud and clear. Come out now.

107
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,120
How are you, Brother?

108
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,520
Why don’t you answer my calls, *****?

109
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,040
Why? What is it?

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,080
Come with me. I need to speak with you.

111
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,040
Talk? I have work man. The night shift.

112
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
It’s only the night shift so come with me.

113
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Koli. The biggest mistake of his life

114
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
was being my roommate in college.

115
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,800
Apart from Alcohol and Gudang Garam,

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,680
he’s the only dog who understands me.

117
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,800
You could even call him a worthless fellow.

118
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
This boy will never do well in life.

119
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,640
I've told him not to mingle with that fella.

120
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,720
When has he ever listened to me?

121
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,320
So what’s your story? Talk to me.

122
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
I am disheartened, Bro.

123
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,880
Why? Because of Jasmine?

124
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,960
It’s got nothing to do with Jasmine.

125
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Then?

126
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Something else.

127
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,440
Life seems empty.

128
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Why is it like this?

129
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,920
There are a few job vacancies at my workplace.

130
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,560
I can get you the job if you want.

131
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
RM4,000 basic salary. Shift work.

132
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
Just say the word and I can get you in.

133
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,920
I’m not cutout for an office job.

134
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
What’s the point, Koli? You go to work. Earn money.

135
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,080
What comes after that? What do you have in your life?

136
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,680
What comes after that? Find a nice girl
once you’ve started earning money.

137
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,480
Then get married. Have some kids. And life will sort itself
out, Bro.

138
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,000
And what comes after that?

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,920
What do you mean? You grow old.

140
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Happiness, sorrow, misery.

141
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,240
Deal with all that and then die happy.

142
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,600
So we're all going to die at the end of the day?
Then why wait 20, 30 years?

143
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Why not just die now?

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,160
Go die then. No one can stop you.

145
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,600
Life is for living, Man.

146
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Life isn’t meant to be analysed.

147
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Spouting a load of garbage.

148
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Get that shit away from me.

149
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,680
I offered you a cigarette, not a kiss.

150
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,480
How can you tell me to live, Koli?

151
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Is there a guidebook to life?

152
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
Live this way. Be this way. Did anyone teach us?

153
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,600
Is this taught in any college or school?

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They don’t teach you anything useful.

155
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,920
*****.

156
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Don’t take this the wrong way, Bro.

157
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,760
But you are your biggest enemy.

158
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,280
You’re overthinking things. Relax.

159
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Go. Travel.

160
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,160
Drink till you drop. Fuck around.

161
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Be happy.

162
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Instead of upsetting yourself like this.

163
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,040
What's your problem? Life seems empty?

164
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,320
Bro, there’s this chick named Girija in Sentul.

165
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,880
The hottest there is. Curves in all the right places.

166
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Skin as white as milk. Her skin blushes at the slightest
touch.

167
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
That brothel’s got a girl like that.

168
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Go there. Enjoy yourself.

169
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
So you're heading there tonight?

170
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,440
And your mother goes around telling everyone I spoilt you.

171
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,160
How can you tell me to f**** a stranger for 10 minutes of
bliss?

172
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
Shut up and drink, Man.

173
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Cheers!

174
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,200
There's a place in hell for sinners who do not respect
cigarettes.

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,800
Saturday night. Around 10 at night.

176
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I was getting drunk while walking through Changkat.

177
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,960
I've probably walked these streets a hundred times.

178
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,800
That's when it dawned on me. The ultimate truth.

179
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
F***. The alcohol must be getting to me.

180
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,920
Solitude is my orgasm. Death.

181
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,600
Even if I live another 30 or 40 years,

182
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,880
I know for a fact that I won't have
a big change or any happiness in my life.

183
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,240
We're born destined to die.

184
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,920
So does it matter when you die?

185
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
It’s just a matter of finding an auspicious date.

186
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,120
That very moment I decided to commit suicide,

187
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,040
I felt intoxicated.

188
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,480
This must be the ultimate high.

189
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
My dear God,

190
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,040
send my soul to hell.

191
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I've heard heaven is a No Smoking Zone.

192
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,720
P.S. If there is such a thing as reincarnation.

193
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,440
Make it up for me in my next birth.

194
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Please.

195
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Thank you.

196
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Busy day at work, B? You look tired.

197
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
The usual stuff. Nothing much.

198
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,720
I have some good news.

199
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,960
I’m being considered for the Staff Engineer role.

200
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,920
Wow. Congrats.

201
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,840
Thanks. But nothing’s been confirmed yet.

202
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
Keeping my fingers crossed.

203
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
The posting’s in Germany by the way.

204
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,680
We can get out of this country.

205
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
How was your day?

206
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Not bad.

207
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I've cooked dinner. Would you like to eat?

208
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,080
No, I’m not hungry. You eat then head to bed first.

209
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
What’s wrong?

210
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
Eat and sleep. Is that all I’m good for?

211
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Would it kill you to talk to me, Jay?

212
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Fine. Don’t sleep. Watch some TV instead.

213
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,680
I have project reports to write. I’ll talk to you later.

214
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,920
...death doesn't come so quickly.

215
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
....he is still alive.

216
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,840
The dance sequences in this movie are awesome.

217
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Could we take a vacation?

218
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
What was that?

219
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
A quick vacation?

220
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,880
Maybe at the end of the year.

221
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,240
You know I'm really trying to get this Germany project.

222
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,120
Until then, I'm totally stuck.

223
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,200
Fine. Forget about it.

224
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
We’ll go at the end of the year.

225
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,160
Why? Are you bored?

226
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,160
Brother! Sura (Shark) is coming!

227
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
Boredom has nothing to do with it.

228
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
Life just seems empty.

229
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
That’s why I think we should try for a baby.

230
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,640
But you don’t want to.

231
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,680
At least a baby will keep you occupied.

232
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,040
Don’t expect me to have a baby out of boredom, Jay.

233
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,520
You’re being very selfish, Nithya.

234
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,840
What? Are you worried about the weight you'll gain?

235
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,880
Or are you running away from commitments?

236
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,480
I just can't understand you, Nithya.

237
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,600
Not at all.

238
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,480
There’s an emptiness between us.

239
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,080
How do you not feel it too?

240
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,560
How can you expect me to bring a child into all this?

241
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
I’m not a ******* baby-making machine for you and your
mother.

242
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Why are you shouting? What’s your ******* problem now?

243
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Who’s shouting? You’re the one shouting at me.

244
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,200
Depressed b****.

245
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,200
Don’t change the channel.

246
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,680
Yes, Dato. I'm good. How are you?

247
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Actually I wanted to discuss the quotation you sent.

248
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
All good, Dato.

249
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
OK.

250
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,960
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

251
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,400
Hello, Jay?

252
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,360
Nithya? Is everything all right?

253
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Are you OK?

254
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,720
I need to speak to you. I feel very…

255
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Sorry. I’m busy right now.

256
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Can we talk tonight?

257
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
Nithya? Are you there?

258
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
It’s OK. I’m fine.

259
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You carry on.

260
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,720
What kind of neurotic society you have created.

261
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
If you don't love each other,

262
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,720
at least be humane,

263
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,720
and tell frankly,

264
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,720
that it was beautiful to be
together but now it is finished.

265
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Say goodbye.

266
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
How long have you been married?

267
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
That's an odd question.

268
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
About 4 years now.

269
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
In these 4 years,

270
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
have you ever felt like calling
it quits and running away?

271
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,800
Not just once but 10,000 times.

272
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,600
Then why?

273
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
You’ll get over it with time.

274
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,120
You’ll learn to live for others.
Not only for yourself.

275
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,440
Hard to imagine, right?

276
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,000
But that’s just the way it is.

277
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
You’ll eventually get the hang of it.

278
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,160
I don’t think I can live like that.

279
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I have my limits.

280
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,040
There will come a time when
I won’t hesitate to call it quits.

281
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Jay?

282
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Jay?

283
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,160
Are you listening?

284
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,520
I can’t seem to sleep.

285
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,440
Can you talk to me?

286
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,800
Do you love me?

287
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Hmmm?

288
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
I love you, Jay.

289
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,840
I really loved you.

290
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,480
I’m sorry if I’ve ever hurt you.

291
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,800
But why have you changed?

292
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Married life,

293
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
do you know I had such high hopes?

294
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,600
But...

295
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
...nothing's turned out right.

296
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,760
It was all a lie.

297
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,720
♫ Andru Vandhadhum
from Periya Idathu Penn (1963). ♫

298
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,720
♫ This same moon came then. ♫

299
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,840
♫ This same moon comes now. ♫

300
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,840
♫ There is only one moon for all of time. ♫

301
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,840
♫ The same moon for both of us. ♫

302
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,200
On a beautiful Sunday night, the full moon smiles at me.

303
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
That would make a good song.

304
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,960
♫ This same moon came then. ♫

305
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,320
But I don't know why.

306
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,200
In the presence of such a beautiful moon.

307
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,440
I felt embarrassed to jump and smash my head open.

308
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,960
So I postponed my suicide to a new moon day.

309
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,640
Don't think I'm coming up with excuses because I fear death.

310
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,160
Put yourselves in my shoes,

311
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,200
you'd say the same thing.

312
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,440
♫ On a beautiful Sunday, ♫

313
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,680
♫ you walked in like a goddess. ♫

314
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,920
♫ With your scent, ♫

315
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,200
♫ you come to me upon the wind. ♫

316
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,320
♫ I got lost in your mesmerising smile, my love. ♫

317
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,160
♫ The heaven's wept ♫

318
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,760
♫ when you said this wasn't love. ♫

319
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,800
♫ I shattered ♫

320
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,760
♫ like glass. ♫

321
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,560
♫ I shattered ♫

322
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,880
♫ like glass. ♫

323
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,880
♫ On a beautiful Sunday, ♫

324
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,760
♫ you walked in like a goddess. ♫

325
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,320
♫ With your scent, ♫

326
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,440
♫ you come to me upon the wind. ♫

327
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,600
I dedicate this song to.

328
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Jasmine.

329
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,360
Excuse me.

330
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
Excuse me.

331
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,320
I saw your performance. It was really good.

332
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I am listening to a very nice solo
after a long time.

333
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,560
Thought of informing you this.

334
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,400
Thanks.

335
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,560
Are you okey?
You look so nervous.

336
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,520
Nothing like that.

337
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,240
You want to have a drink?

338
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Alright, but not inside the bar.

339
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,800
Why?

340
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I am not very comfortable with crowds.

341
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,600
Interesting, you will perform in a crowd, but hate it.

342
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Nithya.

343
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,680
That's your full name?

344
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,520
Not Nithyaveni? Nithyakalyani?

345
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
It's My Thoughts Are All of Nithya (a movie).

346
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,680
I'm kidding. My name's just Nithya.

347
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Do you know what your name means?

348
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
No.

349
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Constant. Beginning. Everlasting. Without a beginning or an
end.

350
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,200
♫ We sang of that glorious light, which has no beginning or
end. ♫

351
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
♫ Oh, bright wide-eyed girl... ♫

352
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,800
Not bad. A guitarist who knows the Thiruvempavai.

353
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,760
I wouldn't say I know it.

354
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,040
I just happen to remember some parts.

355
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
What's your name?

356
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
Cheers.
- Cheers.

357
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Here's to your song.
- Thanks for the drink.

358
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,560
No problem.

359
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Do you know they mix fish gallbladders in Stout?

360
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,440
A fish's what?
- Gallbladder.

361
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:01,680
Yeah. Not many people know that.

362
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
Yeah. Not many people know that.

363
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,280
Actually I think we've met before.

364
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
You look quite familiar.

365
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,600
I was going to ask you the same thing.

366
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,120
Do you come to this pub often?

367
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,400
I wouldn't say all the time. Only some times.

368
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
Once in awhile. When I feel like it.

369
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,840
The live band is quite good.

370
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
But I'd never seen you perform before tonight.

371
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,800
Sorry. Don't take it to heart.

372
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,480
No. It's OK.

373
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,400
You wouldn't have had many
chances to see me perform anyway.

374
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,240
If an artiste cancels their slot

375
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,560
or if they're running late. That's when they call me.

376
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm more like a filler.

377
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,560
They should give you a prime slot on the weekend.

378
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,920
If you ask me, you did good.

379
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,240
To tell you the truth,
I've been thinking about quitting music.

380
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,840
And here you are telling me this.

381
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,560
But why? I don't get it.

382
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,240
You are so talented and you want to waste it.

383
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,200
It's because of people like you that

384
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,680
In a world devoid of art
even a doodle is considered an art.

385
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,360
A Tamil girl who's read Bharatiyar.

386
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,760
Not bad.

387
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
A revolutionary woman who's read Bharatiyar.

388
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,600
You see

389
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,720
everyone seems to think being talented is a blessing.

390
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,960
But none of them get it.

391
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,160
Being talented is a curse.

392
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
The ultimate curse.

393
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,840
The pain and suffering that comes with it.

394
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,920
An ordinary person will never understand.

395
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm not talented like you.

396
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,240
But, you know, pain and suffering is a part of life.

397
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,360
The world is full of terrible things.

398
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,400
War. Disease. Death. Destruction. Hunger.
Famine. Poverty. Terrorism.

399
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,640
The only beauty in life is music.

400
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,160
To create beauty and meaning when there is none in life.

401
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,160
If I didn't have music in my life,
I would have killed myself a long time ago.

402
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Actually you are blessed to be able to do this.

403
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,800
I'm not saying you need to become a rockstar.

404
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,680
At least keep performing in bars for now.

405
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
You will get your just rewards.

406
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,640
For those animals who don't even appreciate music.

407
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,880
I don't know much longer I can tolerate it.

408
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,520
But let's see how far this goes.

409
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,560
But you can't say that.

410
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,880
I've heard many people sing at the bar.

411
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,560
And I've never felt like praising any of them.

412
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,560
But when you performed, the pain present in your song

413
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
was a truly soulful experience.

414
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,560
That why I feel you should keep performing.

415
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Thanks.

416
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,840
You are very eloquent.

417
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,600
Actually it's been a while since I've spoken like this.

418
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
So what do you do for a living?

419
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm a part-time Bharatanatyam teacher.

420
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,560
Full-time housewife.

421
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
You're married?

422
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Yes. Why?

423
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
No. Nothing.

424
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,680
Who's Jasmine? Your girlfriend?

425
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
It's all right if you don't want to talk about it.

426
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,480
It's nothing like that.

427
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
My ex-girlfriend.

428
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,880
I'm sorry.

429
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,840
It's fine. There's nothing to be sorry about.

430
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,240
She must be hard to get over
if you're dedicating songs to her.

431
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Getting over her was the easy part.

432
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
In a few years, the way she looks,

433
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
they way she talks,

434
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
you forget these things by the passing of time

435
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
But

436
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
the worst part of a break-up is

437
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
the memories.

438
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,040
You can neither forget nor change a memory.

439
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,760
They'll stay with you to your dying day.

440
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Yeah.

441
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,400
Something I read a long time ago.

442
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,200
It said to write the name of person
you're trying to forget on a red piece of paper

443
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,840
then silently recall those memories

444
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,160
before burning the paper and throwing
the ashes into the sea or a river.

445
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,200
The universe will then slowly take
these memories away from you.

446
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
It's an Egyptian belief.

447
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,600
Have you ever tried it?

448
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
I don't have anyone I want to forget that badly in my life.

449
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
I just thought it might help you.

450
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,680
It may actually work.

451
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,640
I don't really believe in things like this.

452
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,080
But I'll bear it in mind.

453
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,640
Want to eat cucuk cucuk (skewered meatballs)?

454
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,080
It'll be awesome.

455
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,320
They're one of the best stalls in Kuala Lumpur.

456
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,640
To tell you the truth.

457
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,440
I've never had lok lok in my life.

458
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,720
What? Seriously?

459
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,560
You must be the only Malaysian who's never eaten lok lok.

460
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
That may actually be true.

461
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,160
Then you're definitely eating it tonight. My treat.

462
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,160
OK.

463
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,920
Text me when you're performing next. I'll try to make it if
I'm free.

464
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,520
I'll definitely let you know.

465
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
All right then.

466
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
It's late. I should head home.

467
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,120
Thanks for keeping me company.
I had a good evening.

468
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,280
I had a good evening, too.

469
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
After a really long time.

470
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,240
Thanks to you.

471
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,320
Where did you park your car?

472
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,600
Want me to walk with you?

473
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,800
No. It's nearby.

474
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
It's OK. Good night.

475
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,800
Good night. Take care.

476
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Hello?

477
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,400
Do you remember me?

478
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,200
Yeah, of course.

479
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,680
I'm performing tonight at 9.

480
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
Where?

481
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Rhythm of Chennai.

482
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,640
All right. I'll come by if I'm free.

483
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
OK. Bye.

484
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
That was awesome. I really enjoyed it.

485
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,560
Thanks.

486
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,240
You seem different.

487
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,760
You're here alone?

488
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,840
Yeah. My husband isn't interested in music.

489
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,600
Have you had dinner? Would you like to have dinner?

490
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,840
I haven't eaten yet.

491
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,800
Isn't it late for you?

492
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,360
No.

493
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,680
I've been meaning to ask you.

494
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,360
Not many Tamil girls listen to rock music.

495
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,040
How come you do? Why are you so unique?

496
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Nothing like that.

497
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,720
There are quite a few people like me.

498
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,800
We listen to everything from The Beattles to Ilaiyaraaja.

499
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,400
It's your turn.

500
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,640
Oh, yeah.

501
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
What is your date of birth?

502
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,720
25th November, 1989.

503
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
So you're a 7.

504
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,800
No wonder we get along so well.

505
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Numerology? You believe in that sort of thing?

506
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,880
No. Absolutely not.

507
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,680
How can mere numbers decide someone's destiny?

508
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,840
Astrology. Palmistry. Palm-leaf manuscripts.

509
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,920
I think of it as meaningless entertainment.

510
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,800
And your date of birth?

511
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
It's all right if you don't want to tell me your age.

512
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,360
November 13th, 1987.

513
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't get why some women are so sensitive about their age.

514
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,640
What's the big deal?

515
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,000
So what if people know how old you are?

516
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Are women that vulnerable?

517
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,840
Are you a feminist?

518
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,920
I'm a rationalist.

519
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Feminism is a concept that men created.

520
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,680
They emphasised the idea of open-sex in the name of 'female
empowerment'.

521
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
But who benefits from open-sex? Men or women?

522
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,920
Some dumb women go around thinking that's gender liberation.

523
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,880
It sickens me.

524
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,120
Sorry. Am I talking too much?

525
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,000
I don't get the whole 'men and women are equal' argument.

526
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,640
There is absolutely no way men and women are equals.

527
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,120
Women are truly superior to men.

528
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,800
If God exists, he's definitely be a man.

529
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:16,680
Why?

530
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Because no woman would run the universe this badly.

531
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,880
Do you believe in God?

532
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,600
I don't believe in any God.

533
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,200
Me. You. That cat in the street.

534
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,240
That tree. The sky. Electricity.

535
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,600
It's all just a beautiful coincidence.

536
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,120
I don't think God created any of it.

537
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
What do you believe in?

538
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,160
The God as you know is not the same God I believe in.

539
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,800
I see an energy in this universe.

540
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,840
Something that human beings can never fathom .

541
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,720
A force greater than our puny minds can comprehend.

542
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,720
That is my God.

543
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,960
But of course, I think religion is overrated.

544
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,360
You can do this but not that.

545
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,760
Eat this but not that.

546
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,520
Wear this dress but not that hat.

547
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
Bullshit.

548
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,840
Religion is full of them.

549
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,800
Yeah.

550
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,480
If we got rid of religion,
all the world's problems would be solved.

551
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,440
As if that would ever happen.

552
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,040
Even if all of mankind died, religion would still survive.

553
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Who's turn is it?

554
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
No idea. You go ahead.

555
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
What are your dreams like?

556
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,120
Dreams? What do you mean?

557
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,360
Everyone has ambitions, goals, desires.

558
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,480
What are yours?

559
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Tough question.

560
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,960
I need time to think. You start first.

561
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
I have many crazy dreams.

562
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,160
But...

563
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,760
I want to go bungee jumping.

564
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,760
I want to go skydiving.

565
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,960
I want to set foot on the ISS Space Station at least once in
my life.

566
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,320
I have plenty of dreams like this.

567
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,280
What else?

568
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,160
Other than that...

569
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,360
I want to go on a long bike ride in the pouring rain.

570
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
You know how to ride a bike?

571
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,680
I don't even know how to start a bike.

572
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,960
People usually dream of ferraris,
mansions and becoming a millionaire.

573
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,160
Don't you have such aspirations?

574
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,240
Dreams should be big.

575
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Why limit yourself to houses and cars?

576
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Your turn. What are your dreams?

577
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,720
I don't have dreams.

578
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,080
Quit joking.

579
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
For real, Nithya.

580
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Why would I lie to you?

581
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,640
To be human is to have desires.

582
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,120
Are you going to become a priest?

583
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,120
These days priests have more desires than lay people.

584
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,320
But think about it.

585
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Goats. Cows. Lizards. Chickens. Cats.

586
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,720
Why even that cockroach.

587
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,720
Do they have desires?

588
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,360
And yet they're all living happily.

589
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,080
What's meant to happen, will happen.

590
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,560
So why sit around worrying?

591
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Goats and cows have told you they're happy with their lives?

592
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Answer me.

593
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,720
A cow told you?

594
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,800
Looks like it's going to rain.

595
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,040
How did you get here?

596
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,720
By bus.

597
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,600
Let me give you a lift home.

598
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
No. That's all right. I'll find a way.

599
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,640
Just come with me. I'll drop you off.

600
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,200
♫ This same moon came then. ♫

601
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,040
♫ This same moon comes now. ♫

602
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,560
♫ There is only one moon for all of time. ♫

603
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,520
♫ The same moon for both of us. ♫

604
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Thanks, Nithya.

605
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Good night. I'll see you around.

606
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
Good night.

607
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,080
Shall I make breakfast? Eat something before you go.

608
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,800
Never mind. I'm running late.

609
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
I'll grab something on the way.

610
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,520
Bye.

611
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,560
One small Moskovi, Bro.

612
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
Let me pay my share.

613
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
No. Forget it. What's the big deal?

614
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,240
I'm not drinking if you don't let me pay.

615
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:50,160
♫ I can't live without you in my life. ♫

616
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,440
What's the purpose of that ?

617
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,280
A small believing that the nature will
look out for us if we do so.

618
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,000
To happiness.

619
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,040
To more happiness.

620
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
It's OK actually.

621
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,480
I wouldn't say it's awful.

622
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,760
What did I tell you.

623
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
Is this really vodka?

624
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,080
Lets just assume that it is.

625
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:09,840
♫ I can't live without you in my life. ♫

626
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:21,360
♫ I can't live without you in my life. ♫

627
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
A classic.

628
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,000
That was my favourite Malaysian song.

629
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,040
Do you sing?

630
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Only in the shower.

631
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
How about a song for me?

632
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,760
No. It'll be bad.

633
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Just sing.

634
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Which song?

635
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,320
Your choice.

636
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,080
Fine. I'll sing.

637
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
But it's going to be bad.

638
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,760
♫ One dewy night, at the Yamuna river. ♫

639
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,200
♫ Radha waits to dance with her beloved Krishna. ♫

640
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
♫ With eagerness she watches the path for him. ♫

641
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
♫ But young Radha wilts in the end. ♫

642
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,920
♫ Night has passed. Day has passed. ♫

643
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:20,960
♫ Night has passed. Day has passed. ♫

644
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,480
♫ But her King has not come to her. ♫

645
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,520
♫ With unblinking eyes, the maiden searches everywhere. ♫

646
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:36,400
♫ But Krishna isn’t at the pasture. ♫

647
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,840
♫ Is desire one of love's tortures? ♫

648
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,880
♫ But Krishna isn’t at the pasture. ♫

649
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,160
♫ Is desire one of love's tortures? ♫

650
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,320
♫ Poor Radha. ♫

651
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
You sing well actually.

652
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,320
You're lying.
- I mean it. You sing well.

653
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,680
Thanks.

654
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Your beautiful smile; the radiance of a budding bloom.

655
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,360
The love from your heart; the waves of the blue ocean.

656
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,640
Your dulcet voice; as sweet as the cuckoo's call.

657
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,320
Maiden Kannammaa, I have fallen helplessly in love with you.

658
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,920
You are talking about rules and regulations, Kannamma

659
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,600
What are they for?

660
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,760
For those who are angry, Kannamma

661
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,280
The are no rules nor regulations

662
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,600
With the blessing of our elders,

663
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,640
the wedding rituals can be done later.

664
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,640
I will wait for you. Look here.

665
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,960
A kiss on the cheek.

666
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,320
What does it mean to lie here by the sea,
in the moonlight, reciting Bharatiyar poems?

667
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,360
Kavithai punnar inpam.

668
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,960
Don't get it?

669
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,680
Poetic ecstasy.

670
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
No one will ever be as good as Bharatiyar.

671
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,560
You know what's sad?

672
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Kannamma doesn't exist.

673
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,360
She isn't real.

674
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,160
So these are poems for a fictional lover.

675
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,280
An imaginary lover for the romantic poet.

676
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,000
But some say that Kannamma was
a low-caste girl he fell in love with in his youth.

677
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,840
If you look at it that way, Bharatiyar failed at love, too.

678
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,760
Like you.

679
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,120
Yeah. Like me.

680
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,880
Knowing it is doomed for failure,

681
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,000
how can you love someone that much?

682
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,120
The sea at night actually scares me.

683
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,640
Why?

684
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
I don't know.

685
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,320
It just scares me.

686
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,600
It seems so dark and mysterious.

687
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,800
Maybe it's because I don't know how to swim.

688
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,520
So what? You can always learn to swim.

689
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,960
I love the sea at night.

690
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,280
Feels like I'm floating all alone in the universe.

691
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,920
Nithya.

692
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
A shooting star!

693
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,440
Quick! Make a wish!

694
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,640
What did you wish for?

695
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,720
I'm not telling you. What did you wish for?

696
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,800
This the first time I've ever seen a shooting star.

697
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,080
So what did you wish for?

698
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,040
I don't believe in shooting stars.

699
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,680
What a bloody waste.

700
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
Hello?

701
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,040
Happy birthday, Nithya.

702
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,600
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

703
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,360
The pleasure is mine.

704
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Are you free tomorrow around 10am?

705
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,040
I think I'll be free. Why?

706
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,120
Don't guess. Give me a solid answer.

707
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,560
Fine. I will be free.

708
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,680
Now tell me why.

709
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,240
It's a surprise. I'll WhatsApp you.

710
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,840
Good night.
- Good night.

711
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,520
[TEXT MESSAGE]
Many more happy returns to my dearest wife.

712
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,880
Love you so much.

713
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,160
I'm going to be late. I'm in a meeting with clients.

714
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,600
Don't wait up for me.
OK? Love you. Bye.

715
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,160
Whose bike is this?

716
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,160
It's mine.

717
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,320
Was this the surprise?

718
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,360
When did you buy it?

719
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,080
I'm kidding. It's my friend Koli's bike.

720
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,920
He has a car now. The bike just sits there.

721
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,920
So I've "borrowed" it for the day.
- that's cool.

722
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,240
Shall we make a move?
- Where are we going?

723
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,640
It's a surprise.

724
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,480
Come over here.

725
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,800
No. I don't know how to swim.

726
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,080
Don't worry. I'm here. Just get in.

727
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Will you save me if I drown?

728
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,240
I'd give my life to save yours.

729
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,880
Don't make me laugh!

730
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,680
Thanks.

731
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,040
Get home safely.

732
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,800
I'm sorry, Nithya.

733
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,400
A week ago, I was contemplating suicide.

734
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,680
Today, I'm head over heels in love.

735
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,480
What do I really want?

736
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,480
But that's not important.

737
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,720
Nithya is angry with me.

738
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,080
Justifiably angry.

739
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,400
What am I going to do?

740
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,320
Will you honour a request?

741
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,120
We shouldn't see each other again.

742
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,360
Why not?

743
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,560
Please don't ask me why.

744
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,720
I don't feel like explaining myself.

745
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,360
This is all my fault.

746
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,960
I should have seen this coming.

747
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,760
Nithya, please listen to me...
- Please.

748
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,360
Don't.

749
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,240
Fine.

750
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,080
I'll send you home.

751
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,960
Repeatedly sulking for women

752
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,400
made me ashamed of myself.

753
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,120
My mind says, "Get over it, F*****"

754
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
But when have we ever listened to our minds?

755
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,640
[TELEVISION]
You must always be happy.

756
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,240
I don't want to be the reason for your pain.

757
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,600
You love me a lot, don't you?

758
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,840
This is Brother Babu.

759
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,880
A great man who raised us on Chivas and Singleton.

760
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,160
I come here when I want to drink good quality whisky.

761
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,560
What's up? You seem upset.

762
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,560
I'm vegetarian today.

763
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,280
So you're a religious man now?

764
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,680
Not exactly.

765
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,080
Guruji says to go vegetarian every
Tuesday if you want to get married quickly.

766
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,080
But you're drinking alcohol.

767
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,960
Alcohol is vegetarian. It's vegetables.

768
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,680
So you're itching to get married?

769
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,760
What's come over you?

770
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,120
What's the hurry?

771
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,000
I didn't want to get married but since I'm getting older

772
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,600
my family looked for a girl. I agreed to meet her.

773
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,920
Of course they did. That's just what parents do.

774
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,680
It's their duty.

775
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,800
But what happened to your brains?

776
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,920
Adhering to marriage and traditions in this scientific age.

777
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,760
Truth be told, I was fed up at first.

778
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,720
Then I met the girl.

779
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,960
She looks amazing. We ended up liking each other.

780
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,320
She's a teacher.

781
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,520
It'll be easier for me to get a loan now.

782
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,640
So I agreed to the wedding.

783
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,640
Don't make me curse you.

784
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,560
Who the hell gets married for a loan?

785
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,240
Are you going to sit around twiddling
your thumbs after getting married?

786
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,520
Why are you picking on me, Bro?

787
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,680
Lots of people get married.

788
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,080
You're making it sound like I'm the only one.

789
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,400
Wouldn't it be nice to have some companionship?

790
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,480
Are you currently happy?

791
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,480
Yes.

792
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,040
How happy?

793
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,040
Very happy.

794
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,320
Is that so?

795
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,360
Don't think of this as advice.

796
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,960
Some good natured advice

797
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,960
from someone who's been through a lot.

798
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,520
If you truly want to be happy,

799
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,400
don't even entertain the idea of love and marriage.

800
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,040
So you're saying true love doesn't exist, Bro?

801
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:37,120
Of course, it exists. It definitely exists.

802
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,160
But the gift of true love comes with pain and suffering.

803
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,040
Mark my words.

804
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,960
Don't take it to heart.

805
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,720
But you were in love once.

806
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,720
And you were true to her, right?

807
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,840
What was her name?

808
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,320
Jasmine.

809
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,840
Yes, Jasmine.

810
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,840
He truly loved her.

811
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,680
But that didn't stop her from leaving him.

812
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,160
That girl was nuts, Bro.

813
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,480
She tried to change him. He refused to change.

814
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,160
So she got annoyed and left.

815
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,400
Why did you bring that up?

816
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,320
Why are you bringing that up now?

817
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,720
So he was supposed to become a millionaire overnight?

818
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,840
Apart from changing their names, womens excuses will never
change.

819
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,640
Everyone gets screwed over in the end.

820
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,000
Brother Babu?

821
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,320
Forgive me for asking.

822
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,840
If you live without any companionship
whatsoever to the end of your days,

823
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,200
do you truly believe you will be happy?

824
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:34,920
Why not?

825
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,840
As Rajini (a famous actor) put
it so eloquently in one movie.

826
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,160
Wife. Family. Kith and kin.

827
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,480
I rather burn to death on a pyre than drown in a sea of
relatives.

828
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,800
He's right!

829
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,520
Thanks, Bro.

830
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,000
My heart was content

831
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,280
now I'm just confused.

832
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,120
Alcohol. Food. Women. Comfort.

833
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,760
If you have a good taste for them,

834
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,360
there's a place for you in heaven.

835
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,360
What? Don't you get it?

836
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,680
Get high every day.

837
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,360
Head to Thailand twice a month.

838
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,600
There you have it. Bliss.

839
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,520
No Jasmine.

840
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,280
No Nithya.

841
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,400
The moon is not here as well.

842
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,600
But I can't seem to end my life.

843
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,160
Why?

844
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,360
I've slowly begun to forget Nithya.

845
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,920
Five to six months have passed.

846
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,960
Hello?

847
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:06,960
Do you remember me?

848
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,960
I need to talk to you.

849
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,320
Now.

850
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,960
I'm downstairs.

851
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,640
How have you been?

852
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,560
What about you?

853
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,680
This was very sudden.

854
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,560
Can't I come by to see you?

855
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,560
You said it wasn't a good idea to meet anymore.

856
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,000
They've relocated Jay at work.

857
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,960
I am leaving to Berlin in the morning.

858
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,560
My flight's at 4.30am.

859
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,960
I contemplated not telling you.

860
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,200
But it didn't feel right.

861
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,160
Don't go, Nithya.

862
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:33,040
At least let me come to the airport.

863
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,280
Don't do that.

864
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,520
There will be too many people at the airport.

865
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,560
It wouldn't look good if I cried while leaving.

866
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,480
Bye.

867
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,200
I've only just begun to slowly forget Nithya.

868
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,040
She should have left without saying goodbye.

869
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,760
Why did she come all this way just to hug me and cry?

870
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,120
I will never understand women and their love.

871
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,520
Lips are cigarettes,

872
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,400
kisses are the light that ignites.

873
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,960
At 2 in the morning,

874
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,120
in the empty street in front of Malayan Mansion

875
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,200
is when I last saw Nithya.
