BLUE SKY, GREEN SEA, RED EARTH

2
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,219
Blue sky, green sea, red earth

3
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,964
2 'Kings' please

4
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,910
Where are you off to?

5
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,515
Didn't I warn you, Suni
I'm doing this ride all by myself?

6
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,653
What will I do
all alone in Kannur?

7
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,855
I don't know myself
where I am going

8
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,759
You've enough money
for petrol and food, right?

9
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,595
What does it matter
where we go?

10
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,668
I've been hunting for a bike
ever since you mentioned the trip

11
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,102
But didn't get one

12
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,838
This is my uncle's 'daughter'!

13
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,408
Slinked off with it saying
I wanted to buy some fish

14
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,180
So you've eloped with
your uncle's 'daughter', eh?

15
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,649
What else can I do
when you make such sudden plans?

16
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,951
What are our plans?

17
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,952
Before nightfall as of now
to reach Jinto's homestay

18
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:58,957
Nice!

19
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,059
So let's go

20
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,933
Kasi

21
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,108
Why don't we take a train?
It'll take only 2-3 days

22
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,011
- Who told you I'm going there?
- Where else?

23
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,476
To the Himalayas

24
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,725
Himalayas...!
Cream... nice

25
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:33,560
- Cream...?
- Malana cream, world's best hashish

26
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,505
'My solo ride to the Himalayas
is still a distant dream'

27
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,843
'Suni has always been like this'

28
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,914
'His entry is always unexpected'

As the chalice of earth brims in plenty"

32
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:51,798
"The blue sky at the tip of my fingers
Before my eyes an ignited world lingers"

33
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:56,931
"Along untrodden paths, to climb into
nonstop breezy palanquin of feathers"

34
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:12,043
"Zoom on and on to reach new heights"

35
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:23,855

and a racy rhythm too"

surging like tiny tongues of pain?"

41
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,450

00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:52,336
"A tune that's a new refrain
with notes as fine as the pollen"

45
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,336
Be ready, 2 bikes
are approaching

46
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,737
okay

47
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,191
Pull the twine

48
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,431
Push him down

49
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,967
Suni...!

50
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,146
Get the money

51
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,036
Finish him off

52
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,060
Look! More bikes

53
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,326
Let's escape

54
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey! Are you okay?

55
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:52,973
What happened?

56
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,339
Are you alright?

57
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,968
You okay?

58
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,206
Who are those guys?

59
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,374
- Suni, are you okay?
- I'm alright

60
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,974
- You are not hurt, are you?
- I'm alright

61
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,384
- Are you from Kerala?
- Yes

62
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,256
- I am from Kochi
- I'm from Calicut

63
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,919
It's not right to ask
a rider where he's heading

64
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,428
But, you know
this place is dangerous

65
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,160
Yeah man
Thieves, naxals, police

66
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,964
We had no idea

67
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,027
Hey Jitu, let them
ride with us

68
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,902
- Yes... why not?
- Let them

69
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,237
You should
ride with us, man

70
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,334
- Where are you off to?
- Puri

71
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,305
Puri?

72
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,880
What's in Puri?

73
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,280
Music, women and waves

74
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,975
Can you boys handle that?

75
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,020
- Come with us, man
- Come on

76
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,709
sanjay!!

77
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,144
Jinu... the man!

78
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,245
Bro, long time

79
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,414
She's lshita

80
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,392
- Our country's most wanted surfer girl
- Good to meet you, lshita

81
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,585
Meet the rest of the gang

82
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,644
'Puri'

83
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:14,144
'The freedom and happiness
every man searches for... plenty here'

84
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,944
'I feel being happy
is all that matters'

85
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,296
Where are you going?
What are you up to?

86
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,492
Surfing
Aren't you coming?

87
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,330
This isn't like washing clothes
in the hostel with detergent Surf!

88
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,506
You'll swallow salt water

89
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,240
What happened?
Aren't you going?

90
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm going!

91
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,110
The waves are really bad, huh?

92
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,211
Yeah!
Really... really bad

93
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,117
It's okay

94
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,517
How is Puri?

95
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,523
Puri is peaceful

96
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,460
So Sanjay told me
you are from Kerala?

97
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
I love that place

98
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,428
I'm from Pondicherry

99
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,499
Pondicherry?
Do you know Tamil?

100
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,573
Do I know?!
I'm a Tamilian

101
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,668
I love that language

102
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,541
'Body for land
Life for Thamizh'

103
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,110
Anyway, let's go

104
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,707
Go ahead

105
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,243
I'll wait for you here

106
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,516
Small waves, no?

107
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,246
Okay

108
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,391
Thank God!
Great escape!

109
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,603
Kasi

110
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,940
- She says she's returning to Australia
- So what?

111
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,169
She says she'll take me along too

112
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,300
Okay! go

113
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,849
Tell me, Kasi
Is this love... or lust?

114
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,510
Shut up and sleep

115
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,291
Whatever it is, no problem

116
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,498
Pig! I'll kill you

117
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,397
Okay, good night

118
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,501
Aiyo!

119
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,457
- Hi Kasi?
- Hi lshita

120
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,788
It's time to surf

121
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,860
I don't know

122
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,363
- You have to teach me
- Come ya, I can teach you

123
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,567
The waves are good today

124
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,014
'I feel if you want to be happy
be with a happy person'

125
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,393
Hey guys!
Let's play this forest game

126
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,987
- Forest game?
- It's fun

127
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,726
There is a forest nearby

128
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,361
If you walk through it for 2 kms
you come to a fantastic beach

129
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,066
But listen, wrong direction
and you go around in loops

130
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,367
We'll get in at different
entry points in the forest

131
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,673
Whoever reaches
the beach first, wins

132
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:16,939
Do you want to play?

133
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,407
Will there be animals?

134
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,881
May be a few wolves

135
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,783
Last time we played
a guy didn't return

136
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,980
That's all

137
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,987
- Pearly
- I dare not go there

138
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,822
- You want to go, Lee?
- No, thank you

139
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,859
I'm coming too

140
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,000
Sorry... only boys

141
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,417
- Alright boys, see you on the beach
- Good luck, Jinu

142
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,055
See you
Bye

143
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,632
- Good luck, man
- See you guys

144
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,041
- Bye, bro
- See you, dude

145
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,707
I'll see you there

146
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,958
okay

147
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:36,890
See you

148
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,630
- Hey Jinu!
- Kadhi... there you are

149
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,901
- Where the hell were you, man?
- I think we should go that way

150
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,682
There's the beach!

151
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,546
Yeah! We made it

152
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,175
Run... run... run

153
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,885
Wow! This is beautiful

154
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,116
Yeah! Jinu

155
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,125
About time you guys

156
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,931
Hey!

157
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,889
Suni isn't here as yet

158
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,159
Don't stress, man
He'll find his way

159
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,596
I'm going to find him

160
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,158
No Kasi, its against the rules

161
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,293
F*** the rules

162
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,168
Come on, man
Not nice, huh?

163
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,241
Suni!??

164
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,853
SUNI

165
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,202
I figured I won't be
able to find my way

166
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,679
I knew you'd come
looking for me

167
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,412
I decided to sit here
and not tire myself

168
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,183
- Come, let's take a walk
- Alright

169
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,895
Ah toddy!
It is our destiny

170
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,771
Brilliant night, eh?
Puri is Puri

171
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,048
Kasi...?

172
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,854
Do you know the most
important rule of surfing?

173
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,921
Golden rule
One man, one wave

174
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,067
Do you have a girl friend?

175
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,066
I'm sorry

176
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,989
Catch it
Good one

177
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,396
Send it this way

178
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,366
- Catch it, Jin
- I got it

179
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,130
Move here

180
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,070
Kasi, come on

181
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,265
Send it to Kadhi

182
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,205
Good one, Kasi

183
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,901
This way

184
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,476
Be rig ht back

185
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,548
Why don't you play with us?

186
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,212
I'm not in the mood

187
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,216
You want to do something?

188
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,152
Do what?

189
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,322
Come with me?
Come on

190
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,210
Hey!
Are we lost?

191
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,509
- I think it's that way
- That way?

192
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,997
Who is that girl?

193
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:42,595
You don't look like
you've gone through so much

194
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,378
I thought I could forget

195
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,249
We leave tomorrow morning

196
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,615
Why?

197
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,159
I mean... where?!

198
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,100
Kolkata

199
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,443
Okay, I'm no one
to hold you back

200
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:29,176
But I'd like to know about
your trip and where you reach

201
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,289
Rider brotherhood, bro

202
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,088
She moved on with
a surfer dude, man

203
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:43,598
Really?

204
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,327
Check out this picture

205
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,599
- Safe ride, dude
- Thank you

206
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,654
Come on guys
Let's help them

207
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,483
Push

208
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,251
Bye guys

209
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,188
Push
That's it

210
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,420
That's it

211
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:50,493
"Oh wandering soul...!"

212
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:59,507
"What is your direction...?"

213
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,172
'I knew lshita was
key to my happiness'

214
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,310
'Maybe happiness
is not what I want'

215
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,674
What's wrong?

216
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,221
This headlight has
conked off again

217
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,317
What do we do?

218
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,359
Ride in front

219
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,879
- Kasi...?
- What?

220
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,779
I feel like
eating biriyani

221
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,749
In the middle
of the night...?

222
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,253
There is no night or day
to eat biriyani in Kannur

223
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,550
There is a place
in Kolkata also

224
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,666
Kasi, where are we?

225
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,899
We've been wandering
around these hills for so long

226
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,441
I have no idea

227
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,603
I can't go a single foot forward
I'm switching off here

228
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,887
Bamanghati
What's that place?

229
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,421
Who knows!

230
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,632
Suni?

231
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,296
Kasi!?

232
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,297
Who are these people?

233
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,971
- Where are we?
- I don't know

234
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,084
Goodness!

235
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,691
Last night I heard
the sound of Bullet bikes

236
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,631
Here, only 2 kinds of
people ride a Bullet

237
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,742
Either the police
or militants

238
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,606
Which category
do you belong to?

239
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:36,375
No sir, we were just
wandering and got lost

240
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:43,519
Oh I see! You mean, you got here by just
wandering all the way from Kerala?

241
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,657
Yes

242
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:50,862
Fine, please come
to my house also

243
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,832
It's okay
Put your guns down

244
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,869
Help them with their bags

245
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:55,995
Please come

246
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:05,443
Why don't you take a dip
in the river and refresh yourself?

247
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,492
What a strange creature!

248
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,605
Please eat

249
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:53,689
Do you have a destination in mind?
Or intend to continue wandering?

250
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,664
Just wander

251
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:00,967
Gauri...?

252
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:05,564
Serve them some more

253
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:29,690
When E.M.S formed his 1st
communist govt in Kerala...

254
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,223
...I was around 20 years old

255
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:39,127
When he came to Calcutta for
a meeting, we were all so happy

256
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,537
All of us went to meet him

257
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:50,726
Two qualities a good politician
must have... honesty and courtesy

258
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:58,075
"Sacrificial tombstones..."

259
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,259
I forgot

260
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,321
I've forgotten everything

261
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:32,150
When mining companies
laid their eyes on our villages...

262
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,656
...they began calling us militants

263
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,122
Fought them

264
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,391
We fought them

265
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,242
And in that long period
of conflict I met my wife...

266
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,246
...and lost her also

267
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:14,319
Even before I lost her
I had already faced defeat

268
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:25,269
I lost her because I delayed
moving out of those villages

269
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:32,880
But at least I could bring the villagers
and my daughter Gauri here

270
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,274
Companies...

271
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,889
...companies are
running this country

272
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,713
Where are you
going actually?

273
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,982
Nagaland

274
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,020
Where is Nagaland?

275
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,356
There

276
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,294
There?

277
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,405
Why are you going there?

278
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,213
To meet his girl

279
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:49,047
So far... just to meet her?
She is very lucky

280
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,825
Kerala is here
and Nagaland there

281
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,795
Then how did they meet?

282
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,529
Tell me

283
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,341
'The day Dalit student
Raji committed suicide'

284
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,544
'Not being able to
pay her college fees'

285
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:42,500
'Long live
Student federation of India'

286
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,773
'Long live the revolution'

287
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,075
'Raji's suicide triggered
agitations all over Kerala'

288
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,344
'In our college also'

289
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,318
Colleges are no longer for education

290
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,355
They are now just business

291
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,322
We are not students any more

292
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,156
Just tools for them
to make profits

293
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,593
If we want to see
our friends every day...

294
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,493
...we have to ensure now
they have money for their fees

295
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,228
These business men have
imposed that liability on us

296
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:11,205
'Our college had students
from all over India'

297
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:28,117
'Take action against banks
for refusing loans'

298
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,188
'Police... render justice'

299
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,369
'Long live
student unity'

300
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,876
Hello?

301
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,338
Hello?

302
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,727
'The final day of
the 6th semester series exams'

303
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,971
'That's the day
they started talking'

304
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,372
Kasi

305
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,371
Kasi

306
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,378
Assi, can I ask
what you told?

307
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,610
- Kasi
- No, Shyam

308
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,053
Hello

309
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,116
I'll be right back

310
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,419
Hello

311
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,690
Hey, Shyam

312
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,697
This is my friend, Assi

313
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,299
Hello

314
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,664
Assi... Kasi

315
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,771
Kasi... Assi

316
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:02,738
She wanted to thank you
for protecting her in today's strike

317
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,039
That's okay

318
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,177
I'm leaving
See you later

319
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,797
- Thank you
- You're welcome

320
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,736
Assi, 4th year
architecture, rig ht?

321
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,172
- Yes
- You can speak Malayalam?

322
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,734
All my friends speak
to me in Malayalam

323
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,710
And I reply in English

324
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,009
Oh! Okay

325
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,351
I've seen you many times

326
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,556
Me too
Leading all the fights

327
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,621
Kasi

328
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,742
I have to go now

329
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,543
okay

330
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,521
Shall I call the college
intercom at night?

331
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,089
But girls say
you never call anybody

332
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,155
I never had to

333
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:43,269
- When did you start dreaming this big?
- I've not finished, Kasi

334
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,744
Hills all around... and...?

335
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:45,836
Yellow flowers

336
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:49,213
- That's not how yellow is pronounced
- That's how we say it in Kannur

337
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,114
Oh really?

338
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,675
Kasi, comrade is waiting

339
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,277
Okay
Come

340
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,122
Kasi, you've not been introduced
to comrade Shekar yet, right?

341
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,661
Lal Salam
(Red salute)

342
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:08,295
Raji's suicide is
a good political issue for us

343
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,637
'It was the same day
Kasi argued...'

344
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:17,702
'...with those who tried to exploit
Raji's death for gains in the election'

345
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,378
You are Malikavettil
Abdu Haji's son, right?

346
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,785
No wonder this arrogance!

347
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:33,123
However staunch a Leftist you are
your dad's blood runs in you!

348
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:39,195
Today's strike was to fight
for a girl's right to live

349
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,396
Never again step into
this hostel with such conspiracies

350
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,353
Catch that white-guy

351
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,357
Catch him!

352
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:16,163
Assi is from Nagaland, right?

353
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,831
Yeah

354
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:26,171
Assi's dad was in Assam Rifles
posted in Nagaland

355
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,545
He is a Marathi
who married a Naga girl

356
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,709
So she's mixed

357
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,780
They both were killed

358
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,683
Shot dead!

359
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,634
It's dad... one sec

360
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,538
Hello?
Dad?

361
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,429
Hello?

362
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,826
I thought you went off to sleep

363
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,831
I don't sleep much
I sleep late

364
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,419
Tie him to the tree

365
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,946
Hello?

366
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,457
Was that Suni?

367
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,493
Yes, do you know him?

368
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,060
Yes, he's with you always

369
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:53,629
All my friends were out
because of the strike

370
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,031
Didn't you go, Assi?

371
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,735
No

372
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,430
Do you want to go?

373
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,831
Yeah, but how...?

374
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,034
We can ride on
my motorcycle

375
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:11,779
'That day itself I knew
Kasi had decided his destiny'

376
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:28,391
"Did half your crystalline tears
glisten to glide away?"

377
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:37,072
"As golden flames sway
in your dreams alive"

378
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:44,817
"Did half your crystalline tears
glitter to be wiped away?"

379
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:52,451
"As golden flames blaze
in your dreams alive"

380
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,027
What happened
to your mom and dad?

381
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,662
I'm sorry

382
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,136
While raiding for militants
one of my dad's men...

383
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:15,042
...killed a powerful civilian
family member by mistake

384
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,619
And they took revenge

385
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,478
Still taking...!!

386
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,387
That day my mom
fought like a panther

387
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:30,089
They had to kill
my mom to get to my dad

388
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,159
Tell me something about yours

389
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,900
I was born and brought up in Dubai

390
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:46,810
My grandfather brought me here
insisting I do college in Kerala

391
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:51,784
Two years ago rest of my family too
returned to settle here

392
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,589
You are very lucky, Kasi

393
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,864
After Paru's husband died...

394
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,995
...if she happened to like
a guy, she'll smile at him

395
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,065
It means you can walk
into her house even at midnight

396
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,010
She has smiled at me!

397
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:18,943
And?

398
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,208
And what else?
I went to her house

399
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,547
- Don't bluff
- I swear it's true

400
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,450
Hey. go

401
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:53,174
"Like the night-rain on these lanes
with scent of thunder clouds"

402
00:57:53,536 --> 00:58:00,818
"Moonlit glow to these tears
like a consolation appears"

403
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,218
I think I'm in love with you

404
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:17,188
"Unaware... within the soul
random memories dwell"

405
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:33,204
"Within the heart's depth,
silence like unspoken pain pervades"

406
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:06,653
Assi?

407
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,953
Which is the most
beautiful place you've seen?

408
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,047
Tawang!

409
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,691
- Arunachal Pradesh?
- Exactly

410
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:20,599
"Like the night-rain on these lanes
with scent of thunder clouds"

411
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:28,635
"Moonlit glow to these tears
like a consolation appears"

412
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,054
What is it Suni, my boy?

413
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:49,925
It's festival time at the temple
If you happen to go there, come home

414
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,660
- I'll give you delicious fish curry and rice
- Okay sister

415
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:59,203
Sister? Call me Paru
when you come home

416
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,190
Dear God!
You heard my prayers

417
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,661
Come in Suni, my boy
There's yummy fish curry and rice

418
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,870
Eat... Suni, my boy

419
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:42,010
What do you think?
Is this love or lust?

420
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,216
Aren't both the same?!

421
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,966
Did you meet Paru
again after that?

422
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:06,296
No

423
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,174
Will you meet her again?

424
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,106
No

425
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,816
Never again

426
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,792
Kasi, how is it here?

427
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,699
Excellent

428
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,099
We've seen
and learnt a lot

429
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,175
Really?

430
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,112
You want to
tell me something?

431
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:27,310
Dada, we can make
a machine for this

432
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,185
Machine?
What kind of machine?

433
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,359
Look at this

434
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:38,523
Aah! A machine
to powder rice

435
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,002
The idea is good

436
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,501
But where will
the money come from?

437
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,037
Bimal'da, we don't need money

438
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,970
Just that scooter will do

439
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,007
- Scooter?
- Yes

440
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,502
Who is there
in Nagaland?

441
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,809
Gauri told me everything

442
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:33,176
It's true that I lost out in the fight
with the mining companies

443
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,317
But do you know what
was my biggest failure?

444
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,854
Losing my wife, Gauri's mother

445
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,701
Son, don't delay!

446
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,603
'In Nagaland Assi's life
may be in danger'

447
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:04,141
'Though I was ready to give up everything
for her, what hurt me most was... she left me'

448
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,216
'And I was afraid
of getting hurt again'

449
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:12,256
"Don't delay!"
'These words of Bimal'da'

'Before snow covers the roads...'

451
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,228
'...first I should reach Nagaland'

452
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,123
'I must see Assi'

453
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,369
Where to now?
Himalayas?

454
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,551
Via Nagaland
Let's go

455
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:39,305
Bimal'da, I'll never forget
all these days here with you

456
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,314
- Will you come back?
- Let's see

457
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,779
Have you found
your destination?

458
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:51,024
I'll definitely
reach where I must

459
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:57,388
I will wait for
the sound of Bullets

460
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,741
Bye, Gauri

461
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,764

You go ahead
Catch me in the highway

486
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,284
- Rs 10, eh?
- Yes

487
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,857
Go...!

01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,178
Dada?

Take the U-turn

495
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:03,060
Where were you?

496
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,661
A lorry...

497
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,927
...almost killed me!

498
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,534
- Did you fall?
- Nothing serious

499
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:16,533
- Now my bike has a puncture too
- That road was full of nails

500
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,676
Read this

501
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:40,265
Kasi, this guy was sitting
in the lorry that tried to kill me

502
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,392
Aw! Come on!
You are imagining it

503
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,435
Kasi, you have to believe me

504
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,062
I'm damn sure

505
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:56,175
It is reported here
he's trying to escape to Nepal

506
01:22:56,604 --> 01:23:00,142
Shyam's dad's enemies
were the guys who killed him

507
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,691
Will we nab him if we follow?
What if we confirm it is him?

508
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,161
What is it?
What happened?

509
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,165
Malayali?

510
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:17,203
No wonder the roads
are full of nails!

511
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,535
You've got to live up to
your native nature, eh?

512
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,301
Just look at my bike

513
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:26,101
Do you have
Sub Inspector Alex's number?

514
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,010
Did you note the lorry
registration number?

WB 052757

516
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,341
Call and tell him

517
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,058
Is it someone you know?

518
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:07,709
Wheel chain is ruined
It has to be changed

519
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,254
It has to come
from the town

520
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,252
Father!

521
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,393
We are here

'But next day onwards...'

531
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,467
Did you guys see Shyam?

532
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:06,436
'Shyam was missing!'

533
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,836
Did Shyam tell you
he was going anywhere?

534
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:12,878
No

535
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,442
Where is Shyam?

536
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:21,785
We are still searching, Assi

537
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:24,885
Probably an emergency at home

538
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:29,689
No! He would have told me
I am worried, Kasi

539
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,203
Don't worry
We'll find him

540
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:54,650
We've informed the Andaman Police
They'll inform his people

541
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,588
I'll also let you know
if I get any information

542
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,589
Thank you, sir

543
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:14,404
Kasim, Sub Inspector Alex here

544
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:35,927
Greetings, sir

545
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,486
Body is completely decomposed

546
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:38,893
Don't know what happened

547
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,797
We can't say anything
until after the postmortem

548
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,412
Shvam...?!?!

549
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:05,783
My God!

550
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:06,917
5hyam!!

551
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:20,332
'By the time warrant was issued, Vendor had
absconded somewhere North of India'

552
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,833
'Everything might be coincidental'

553
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:26,808
'Even Suni imagining
he saw Shyam's murderer!'

554
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,356
What's your name?

555
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:44,690
Raghav!

556
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,829
I mean, Raghavan

557
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,402
They must be hungry...?

558
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,980
Aren't you hungry?
Let's eat whatever is here

559
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:04,710
He'll be back with
the chain by then

560
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:20,823
How long have you
you been living here?

561
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:24,630
Around 20 years

562
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:27,893
Ever gone back to Kerala?

563
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,060
I killed a man back home

564
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,161
In a frenzy of
politics and youth

565
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,833
I didn't think twice when
leaders asked me to do it

566
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:39,639
When it came to a point
where I'd be in jail, I left Kerala

567
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:43,442
Wandered around a lot
and finally reached here

568
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,678
This is also a kind of jail

569
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,019
Dada!

570
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,122
There! Your man is here

571
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,201
Okay...?

572
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:16,080
We were just leaving

573
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:19,614
Don't leave
at this late hour

574
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:21,950
I heard about
some riots up north

575
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:26,921
Sleep here and
leave early tomorrow

576
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,731
Can you drop him off in the town?

577
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,625
Sure, why not?

578
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:45,005
Raghav'etta
this is on our behalf

579
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,039
We may not
meet again, eh?

580
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:54,119
When I see you guys I feel there's still
hope to achieve something in life

581
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:57,188
As if I have people to call
my own from back home

582
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:04,962
Raghav'etta, this road we came by
can lead you back home too!

583
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,657
All the way from Kerala

584
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:51,767
'All along I kept meeting up with destiny
on the same road I chose to avoid it'

585
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:55,342
'One thing I was
always sure about was...'

586
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,312
'...my destiny
is my decision'

587
01:32:58,372 --> 01:33:01,251
'And I chose
to be with her'

588
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:37,722
My father's family says
I always bring misfortune and death

589
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,084
It's not your fault, Assi

590
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:46,357
No?

591
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:52,330
First it was my parents
And now... Shyam

592
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,912
Do you have to go back
to Nagaland after college?

593
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:10,147
Grandma doesn't
want me to go to Nagaland

594
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:13,915
She says their revenge
is not over yet

595
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:18,426
And I don't want to go back
to my father's family in Mumbai

596
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:21,393
They call me chinky... Nepali

597
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,106
Shall I look for
a job in Bangalore?

598
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,779
Will you come to
meet me there?

599
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:14,248
I will come to even
Nagaland to see you

600
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,911
But Assi...

601
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,389
Will you come home?

602
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:25,224
You want to come to my house?

603
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:34,872
To Chendamanglur Malikaveettil
Abdul Haji's house?

604
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:38,442
I know my father will agree

605
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,307
I'm not committing any sin, Suni

606
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:41,846
He will agree?!

607
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:43,982
He's post-modern!!

608
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,381
He may not be modern

609
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:49,046
But he's never opposed
my decision even if he wasn't for it

610
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,784
If he did, I'll go
to Bangalore with Assi

611
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,325
Where else will she go?

612
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:57,762
In short, you can't
live without her?

613
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:01,389
'Engineering student
Shyam's murder'

614
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:06,928
'Regarding the gruesome murder of
college student Shyam, Andaman native...'

615
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:09,064
'...investigations are progressing'

616
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:14,944
'His body was found 3 days ago
in a decomposed state'

617
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:18,244
'His college mates
identified the body'

618
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:22,447
'Arrest warrant has been issued
against the accused Anil Vendor'

619
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:28,323
'Shyam's parents arrived from Andamans
yesterday to receive his mortal remains'

620
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:30,555
'Just another month more in college'

621
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,061
'Shyam is no more'

622
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:36,091
'So also the vacation
plans to Andaman'

623
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,234
'Assi needed a change'

624
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:43,103
'I was wondering how to tell
my family about this, when...'

625
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:49,046
- Peace be with you
- And upon you be peace, father

626
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:52,243
I saw the news about a boy
from your college murdered?

627
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,115
He was my close friend

628
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:03,019
We also saw you
hugging a Nepali girl

629
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:05,097
This is not America you know!

630
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:06,790
Who is she?

631
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,897
My college mate

632
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,536
Is that all?!

633
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:18,033
If members of the organisation, friends
and family ask me, what shall I say?

634
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:19,236
Tell me

635
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:22,878
Let it not be said
in future, that I lied

636
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:24,143
Who is she?

637
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:28,086
I love her!

638
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,356
When are you coming home?

639
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,536
How can you take such
a decision all by yourself?

640
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:57,013
What will I tell
my own family?

641
01:37:57,071 --> 01:38:01,042
My dear Asma, stop blabbering
What do you want me to do?

642
01:38:01,108 --> 01:38:02,553
You know his nature

643
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,852
Wasn't it your ideological father
who brought him from Dubai...

644
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:09,450
...when he was just 10
and pampered him rotten?

645
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:13,862
Your organisation is more
important to you than our son

646
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,333
Don't play with my son's life

647
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:19,996
My dear Asma, use
your God given brains!

648
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:24,201
If we don't agree, what if he registers
his marriage and lives with her?

649
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:26,608
What will we tell
everyone then?

650
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:30,376
Isn't it better for us to
get them decently married?

651
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:33,543
After all, she is an orphan, no?

652
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,501
Hello?

653
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:53,401
Fathima, did you hear?

654
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,997
Kasi is bringing a girl
home from his college

655
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,304
The family is planning
to get them married

656
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:03,337
'The organization is planning to
ramp down its own youth wings'

657
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:09,912
'And concentrate on People welfare party
in view of the upcoming elections'

658
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:14,621
'Not many from where I come from
will accept her... l knew'

659
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:18,595
Kasi, those at home
have always been bourgeoise

660
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:21,064
Why don't you stay
with Pachu in Bangalore?

661
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:24,068
Or at Jinto's homestay
estate in Wayanad?

662
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:25,000
And then?

663
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,163
And then what else?

664
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,467
Live your life
happily forever

665
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:02,604
Since me coming in is of no use and
your father can't stand the sight of me...

666
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,301
...I better go, Kasi

667
01:40:04,365 --> 01:40:05,139
okay

668
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,337
Call me

669
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,244
You can eat chicken curry and
rice pancake hereafter daily, eh?

670
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:13,376
Don't worry
Everybody will love you

671
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:16,611
Shall I go? I'm in
the next district

672
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,246
Okay, see you

673
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,456
Kasi'kka??

674
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:01,093
Do you know who she is?

675
01:41:01,188 --> 01:41:04,499
Isn't she Assi'tha
She's so lovely!

676
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:06,469
- Wafa??
- Yes

677
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,539
- Where is mother?
- Inside

678
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:20,183
'In Karnataka election community
votes supported the Right wing'

679
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:21,412
They've come

680
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:28,187
'Though Party was shocked, they're confident
a similar situation won't arise in Kerala'

681
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:30,353
We'll meet at
the mosque tonight

682
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:34,627
Elections are next month
Isn't it a little too late already?

683
01:41:34,688 --> 01:41:36,361
We'll discuss it tonight

684
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:40,530
Our treasurer now has
family matters to deal with

685
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,800
okay

686
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:49,645
Why don't you
think it over again?

687
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:52,148
Religion is different
from noble ancestry

688
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,278
To me religion, nobility and state
are all one and the same

689
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:01,258
She does not even
speak Malayalam

690
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:04,124
Oh Lord! Why is my son
destined this way?!

691
01:42:04,184 --> 01:42:07,654
It's alright, Asma
God will set things right

692
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,265
My sister is in Dubai

693
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,863
But her daughter
likes to live here

694
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:32,617
lam leaving for Kochi directly
after the meeting at the mosque

695
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:34,784
I'll be back
only after 2 days

696
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:38,256
Get the downstairs room
ready for her to stay

697
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:41,162
By the time I come back
be ready to get married

698
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:42,165
Abdulla'ka

699
01:42:42,222 --> 01:42:44,361
- ls Fathima at home?
- She is

700
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:48,566
Ask her to come and stay here
Let this girl have some company

701
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,301
Father?

702
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:54,574
Mother?

703
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:27,371
I'm sorry, mom
if I disappointed you

704
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:29,845
What is she saying?

705
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:32,247
She says she is sorry
if you are upset

706
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:34,946
And that she likes
Kasi'ka very much!!

707
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,692
Ask her what she'd like to drink?

708
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:44,661
Assi'tha, what would you like?
Tea, coffee or a cool drink?

709
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:46,594
Do we have cool drinks?!

710
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:49,258
Tea will be fine

711
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,328
She says tea will do

712
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:53,997
She seems to know
Malayalam, grandma!

713
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:02,979
While they were playing inside the jungle
there came a huge elephant

714
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:07,583
The elephant roared, trumpeted
And they were all shivering

715
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:10,655
Now what happened?
They were all frightened

716
01:44:18,685 --> 01:44:21,723
And they start running
running inside the jungle

717
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,597
In between the big trees

718
01:44:23,657 --> 01:44:25,261
Hello, ladies

719
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:31,267
God! What am I seeing?
That too, before marriage!

720
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:37,281
- What is it?
- Nothing

721
01:44:52,853 --> 01:44:54,457
Do you like it here?

722
01:44:57,524 --> 01:45:01,028
Nobody likes me... right?

723
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:04,933
You like her, don't you, Wafa?

724
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:09,276
- Yeah, she loves me a lot
- I love you too

725
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:16,921
Wafa... shall I bite
and eat you up?

726
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,482
That's not a problem, aunt

727
01:45:55,582 --> 01:45:58,620
I didn't take it seriously at all

728
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:02,959
Isn't it better not to marry
within close relations?

729
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:05,333
I am not at all upset

730
01:46:06,059 --> 01:46:09,063
My dear child
God will bless you!

731
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:12,434
His father wants
to get them married

732
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,639
We are forced to obey
the men of our house, isn't it?

733
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:17,704
How can I help you, aunt?

734
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:19,841
Teach her the ways
of our religion?

735
01:46:19,906 --> 01:46:21,442
Does she know Malayalam?

736
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:24,078
I can't understand
her Malayalam

737
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:26,114
What shall I do first?

738
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:29,126
Teach her Malayalam
or the ways of our religion?

739
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,761
Eat, my dear

740
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:36,900
Good morning, Assi

741
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:38,401
Good morning

742
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:41,564
I am Fathima

743
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:42,971
Oh hi!

744
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,511
Sorry, I overslept

745
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:49,705
And you said
she doesn't know Malayalam?!

746
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:55,081
Now you've got a new
older sister, eh?

747
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:02,921
Look who has come!

748
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:05,018
Fathima?
When did you come?

749
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:06,461
What's news?

750
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:10,126
You are the one
making the headlines!

751
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,999
Where did you
get the Bullet bike?

752
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:14,163
It came by train cargo
I went to bring it

753
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,908
Assi, she's Fathima
My childhood friend

754
01:47:16,997 --> 01:47:19,204
We are already friends

755
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,109
I came because aunt said you had
snatched a girl from college

756
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:28,150
She has entrusted me to
teach her our religious ways

757
01:47:28,241 --> 01:47:31,552
There's no need for all that
Just give her company

758
01:47:31,645 --> 01:47:33,522
Isn't that rig ht, mother?

759
01:48:01,675 --> 01:48:03,450
She may be an orphan
and a Christian

760
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,650
But on what basis are you
allowing her to stay here?

761
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:07,919
Election is round the corner

762
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:10,756
As it is the people from our own
community disagree with us

763
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:14,230
To top it all a Chinese girl
lives in our treasurer's house

764
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:04,014
'My father had many reasons
to go back on his decision'

765
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,615
'But not me!'

766
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,130
I thought people here
will understand the situation

767
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,097
Let's go to Bangalore

768
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:33,168
We'll find jobs or something

769
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:41,211
Everything will be alright

770
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:45,618
Kasi, we just need
to wait for little more

771
01:50:11,237 --> 01:50:14,650
My dear teacher
I'm totally confused

772
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:16,278
What's there to think about?

773
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,653
How can she marry
without convening?

774
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:21,817
But he isn't allowing us to do that

775
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:31,896
When my daughter fell in love with
a Hindu what an uproar it caused!

776
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:34,370
Asma, do you remember
what a ruckus you made?

777
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:39,702
He was even ready to convert
Yet none of you agreed

778
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:45,372
My daughter is full of woes
when she calls from Saudi even now

779
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:53,256
- Which place does she belong to?
- Who knows?

780
01:50:56,449 --> 01:51:01,330
Isn't it inauspicious if you have
a non-muslim living in the house?

781
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:05,426
So the kids will
look like her, eh?

782
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:09,197
If families like yours also
stoop to such levels...?

783
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:13,971
Unheard of things
are now happening here

784
01:52:11,157 --> 01:52:12,465
What's happened?

785
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:23,070
Where is Assi?

786
01:53:20,827 --> 01:53:24,832
Don't worry!
I've spoken to Abdulla'ka

787
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:28,511
We'll make him understand
and get Fathima married to him

788
01:53:28,601 --> 01:53:30,979
He will be alright

789
01:53:34,374 --> 01:53:37,014
Kasi, sit... eat

790
01:53:55,995 --> 01:54:01,604
'I didn't try to find out how Assi could go
away to Nagaland without a word to me'

791
01:54:01,868 --> 01:54:06,544
'But when my mother started the topic
of marriage to Fathima again...'

792
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,880
'...I decided to hit the road'

793
01:54:08,975 --> 01:54:10,283
'For answers!'

794
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:12,987
Tawang?

795
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:19,119
What are you up to?

796
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:21,427
I am going
on a journey

797
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:30,000
And this?

798
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:31,531
On my bike

799
01:54:32,932 --> 01:54:33,910
Where to?

800
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:36,505
I don't know

801
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:37,871
Yet?

802
01:54:40,506 --> 01:54:41,985
I'll also come

803
01:54:42,508 --> 01:54:43,316
No!

804
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,116
Did you call Assi?

805
01:54:49,415 --> 01:54:50,291
No

806
01:54:51,517 --> 01:54:53,588
She has not
reached Bangalore

807
01:54:54,187 --> 01:54:58,329
- Has she gone to Nagaland?
- Some things are best forgotten

808
01:54:59,092 --> 01:55:00,594
That's why I'm going
on this journey now

809
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:02,104
When are you leaving?

810
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:04,307
Tomorrow

811
01:55:04,964 --> 01:55:07,672
Okay, I'm leaving
Happy journey

812
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:41,239
'Mind, body and bikes
are begnning to get tired'

813
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:45,447
'Riots everywhere
through out Assam borders'

814
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:55,350
Looks like trouble

815
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:58,361
Shall we go back and
cross over during the day?

816
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:01,661
Let's not turn back
We'll see what happens

817
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,756
What happened, my child?

818
01:56:35,154 --> 01:56:37,191
Kasi?
What is it?

819
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:39,664
Don't cry

820
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:45,506
- What's your name?
- Fatimah

821
01:56:49,268 --> 01:56:50,713
Where's your house?

822
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,579
We'll take you home

823
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:00,622
Will you come with us?

824
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:17,799
Over there

825
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:20,769
This way

826
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:37,621
Shall we go back?

827
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:40,549
How can we
leave her alone?

828
01:58:41,147 --> 01:58:43,286
Where is your house, dear?

829
01:58:43,783 --> 01:58:45,126
There

830
01:58:46,352 --> 01:58:47,558
Come

831
01:58:48,521 --> 01:58:49,727
Don't cry

832
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:51,894
Everything will be alright

833
01:59:10,676 --> 01:59:11,882
Anybody here?

834
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:20,191
Who are you?!

835
01:59:21,187 --> 01:59:23,724
We came to
return this child

836
01:59:23,789 --> 01:59:25,735
We didn't do anything

837
01:59:25,825 --> 01:59:27,930
But who are you?

838
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:30,307
Answer!

839
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:32,368
Fatimah!

840
01:59:32,465 --> 01:59:33,705
Mummy

841
01:59:47,647 --> 01:59:51,356
They haven't done
anything wrong!

842
01:59:51,484 --> 01:59:54,829
They saved my baby

843
01:59:55,488 --> 01:59:57,365
Please forgive us

844
01:59:57,456 --> 01:59:59,493
Fathima told us everything

845
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:02,267
Thank you very, very much

846
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:15,509
You should both leave now

847
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:19,556
They might come back any time
Leave right now!

848
02:00:19,645 --> 02:00:21,283
Kasi?

849
02:00:34,827 --> 02:00:36,704
Kasi...?

850
02:01:06,058 --> 02:01:11,633
"Even after wandering
through the jungles..."

851
02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:21,749
Why are we here?

852
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:26,815
This trip is over for me

853
02:01:26,946 --> 02:01:31,019
I must get back home
I'll send the bike by train

854
02:01:33,619 --> 02:01:35,292
What about Assi?

855
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:38,859
After coming so far?

856
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:41,870
I began this ride alone

857
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:46,609
Kasim! So that's all
between us, eh?

858
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:52,381
If I'm not even able to take care
of my old parents... then what?!

859
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:56,783
"Even after wandering
through the jungles..."

860
02:01:57,376 --> 02:02:02,325
"...sages lose their hearts"

861
02:02:03,416 --> 02:02:04,486
Brother?

862
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:12,302
Is there any train to South India?

863
02:02:13,392 --> 02:02:16,100
Chennai, Hyderabad,
Bangalore... any of these places?

864
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:18,468
No, don't disturb me

865
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:32,456
"if I leave the love of my heart,
I won't find again"

866
02:03:12,485 --> 02:03:13,555
Hello?

867
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:20,534
Kasi'ka?

868
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,468
Where are you?

869
02:03:22,528 --> 02:03:24,405
We've made
a thousand calls

870
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:27,876
You've not even bothered
to tell us if you are dead or alive

871
02:03:27,933 --> 02:03:29,105
Where is mother?

872
02:03:32,838 --> 02:03:34,112
She just slept

873
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:38,479
She has been so worried and
worked up on what's happened

874
02:03:38,544 --> 02:03:40,182
Tell her I'm coming back

875
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:43,082
Really?!
Where are you now?

876
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:44,822
I don't know

877
02:03:44,917 --> 02:03:46,828
And will Assi
be with you?

878
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:47,830
No

879
02:03:48,487 --> 02:03:49,693
Why?

880
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:26,069
"Wandering through million births
I've got this cherished human life"

881
02:04:26,225 --> 02:04:31,800
"And if this life withers away without you
it is no longer precious to me, my dear"

882
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:37,476
"Address my love, oh Lord!"

883
02:04:37,603 --> 02:04:42,450
"Protect my love, oh God!!"

884
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:44,244
"I won't let you go"

885
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:49,687
"I will always keep you in my heart
I won't let you go"

886
02:04:49,782 --> 02:04:55,164
"You will always be
in the cockles of my heart"

887
02:04:55,254 --> 02:04:57,734
"if I leave my beloved of my heart..."

888
02:04:57,823 --> 02:05:01,669
"won't find my life again
I won't let you go"

889
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,072
"I won't let you go... ever"

890
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:45,194
- I'm sorry, Suni
- What for, Kasi?

891
02:07:51,363 --> 02:07:54,037
I wanted to forget everything

892
02:07:56,769 --> 02:07:59,443
This journey was only for that

893
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:06,651
Even trying to get close
to lshita was for that reason

894
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:12,656
And also the people we met
like Bimal'da and Raghav'tten...

895
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:16,831
...were regretting
what they had lost

896
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:22,836
That was when I realized
I had to meet Assi

897
02:08:24,963 --> 02:08:29,878
But in yesterday's riot
when I saw that lady...

898
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:35,118
...she reminded me of my mother
and I lost grip on myself, Suni

899
02:08:54,226 --> 02:08:57,867
I understand what
you are going through, Kasi

900
02:09:02,067 --> 02:09:07,141
With no one to rescue her
that kid stranded on the road...

901
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:10,820
...isn't she like my Assi?

902
02:09:16,915 --> 02:09:19,122
I want to meet her, Suni

903
02:09:20,452 --> 02:09:25,424
I didn't come with you to see
the Himalayas or smoke Malana cream

904
02:09:26,058 --> 02:09:30,006
Wasn't it just to see you
and Assi together again?

905
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:39,009
Kasi

906
02:09:39,471 --> 02:09:43,510
Do you remember the dream
I told you about in our hostel?

907
02:09:43,809 --> 02:09:47,757
Yellow (!) flowers
and mountains all around

908
02:09:49,414 --> 02:09:51,325
That was Gauri's land

909
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:54,795
My mom showed them
to me in my dreams

910
02:09:56,922 --> 02:10:02,372
The moment you meet Assi
I promised Gauri I'd go back to her

911
02:10:03,962 --> 02:10:06,841
I had the same
dream last night

912
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:11,547
Shall I go back
to her now, Kasi?

913
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:23,252
'I always thought I was
protecting Suni and Assi'

914
02:10:24,249 --> 02:10:25,922
'But I was wrong'

915
02:10:26,919 --> 02:10:31,868
'Suni's only intension
was to ensure I meet Assi'

916
02:10:32,858 --> 02:10:38,137
'Assi was only trying to ensure
I had no problems in my life'

917
02:10:39,131 --> 02:10:41,475
'They were all protecting me'

918
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:45,982
'They were all
loving me'

919
02:11:13,999 --> 02:11:18,999
Ap International

920
02:11:46,698 --> 02:11:51,698
"As the blue sky graces, drizzles
in my mind, like a wave, I veer away"

921
02:11:57,409 --> 02:12:02,409
"Like wandering clouds obscure
I wander in search of desire"

922
02:12:10,122 --> 02:12:15,122
Ap International

923
02:12:34,646 --> 02:12:42,646
"In a halo of kaleidoscopic illusion
silently time stood still"

924
02:12:55,634 --> 02:13:00,634
"Are you in front of me, unfading?
Or within you am I residing?"

925
02:13:06,712 --> 02:13:14,712
"Knocking at the heart that hums
to an off-beat rhythm I waltz"

926
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:22,622
Ap International

927
02:13:49,488 --> 02:13:54,488
"As the blue sky graces, drizzles
in my mind, like a wave, I veer away"

928
02:14:09,808 --> 02:14:11,617
"Move away"

929
02:14:19,451 --> 02:14:22,330
"I veer away"

930
02:14:23,021 --> 02:14:28,021
Ap International

931
02:14:44,309 --> 02:14:46,550
"I veer away"

932
02:14:52,617 --> 02:14:54,688
"Veer away"

933
02:15:03,428 --> 02:15:08,428
"Are you in front of me, unfading?
Or within you am I residing?"

934
02:15:14,773 --> 02:15:19,773
"Knocking at the heart that hums
to an off-beat rhythm I dance"

935
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:32,619
Ap International

936
02:17:23,802 --> 02:17:26,248
Does he like the food?

937
02:17:28,707 --> 02:17:30,448
Do you like the food?

938
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:32,945
Very nice!

939
02:17:34,679 --> 02:17:36,522
He likes it, grandma

940
02:17:50,295 --> 02:17:55,005
I can't believe he came all this way
to see you, but you both should leave!

941
02:18:01,773 --> 02:18:04,515
The people who are already
provoked by your presence...

942
02:18:04,576 --> 02:18:07,955
...will be angry
with his arrival

943
02:18:26,765 --> 02:18:31,737
Grandma says they are
still out for revenge

944
02:18:33,705 --> 02:18:37,414
She thinks we should
leave this place

945
02:18:40,812 --> 02:18:42,792
What will we do now?

946
02:18:47,385 --> 02:18:49,524
We can ride on
my motorcycle

947
02:18:54,392 --> 02:18:55,530
Forever?

948
02:19:32,097 --> 02:19:33,405
Assi

949
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:37,739
This way

950
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:48,853
Assi!

951
02:20:48,239 --> 02:20:51,015
Kasi, where will we go now?

952
02:20:51,109 --> 02:20:53,111
It would have started
snowing in Tawang

953
02:20:53,244 --> 02:20:55,190
Do you want to go?!

954
02:20:56,750 --> 02:21:08,621
