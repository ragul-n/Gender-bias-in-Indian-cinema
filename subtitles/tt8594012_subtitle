1
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:31,419
We want Justice!

2
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:39,946
Arrest Arjun, immediately!

3
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:43,305
We want Justice!

4
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,740
We want Justice!
Sir, reporting from Commissioner Office

5
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,115
Sir, many people have gathered here to protest

6
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:50,948
Is media there?

7
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,155
A lot of media is present.

8
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,634
I need extra police force, sir.

9
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,593
Give me permission for lathi charge sir.

10
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:56,677
Iathi charge?
Yes sir.

11
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,636
Lathi Charge in front of all the media
will be very damaging for us

12
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,719
But the situation here is getting out of hand Sir

13
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,553
Listen to me, they will shout for a while,
tire and leave Do not take unnecessary risk

14
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:14,803
We want Justice!
Arrest Arjun immediately!

15
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:16,803
Charge!

16
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,636
Sir, Arjun is here

17
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,636
To prove a lie as truth is easy

18
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:42,094
But to prove truth is difficult

19
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:44,386
My name is Arjun Lenin Suravaram

20
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,636
My job is to place truth in front of the public

21
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,469
Reporter Arjun has surrendered

22
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,303
This case is now handed over to
Special branch officer Vikram Kumar

23
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,385
I told you I am on leave today.
Why did you still disturb me?

24
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,594
DCP Sir specifically asked for you
Here is the case file Sir

25
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,969
Is the case big or small? It is a big case Sir.
You will earn praise if you solve it

26
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,969
And would we get money if we let him go?

27
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:12,469
Yes, Sir

28
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,094
What is his name?
Arjun Lenin Suravaram, Sir

29
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,928
Is there any link between his
righteous sounding name and his deeds?

30
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,303
Did anyone come for him?
No Sir

31
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,261
What does your father do?

32
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:59,678
Hello and welcome to Doordarshan News
My name is Suravaram Chandrasekhar

33
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:00,844
Today's headlines

34
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,053
Education Minister Gnananandam has submitted
his asset details to election commission

35
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:13,178
He has properties worth 8.5 Million rupees
8.5 Million! His car itself is worth 20 Million rupees.

36
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,011
See, how they cheat and loot the public

37
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:20,261
Government has confirmed 19 dead in a road accident in Himachal Pradesh
This news is old. It was on Facebook yesterday

38
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:24,386
Yes Sir, I saw it too, on Twitter
Shall we watch a TV drama instead?

39
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:30,178
News is that popular Bollywood
actress has reached size zero by dieting

40
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:37,178
Huh! Half the population in the country is forced
to diet due to poverty. This is hardly newsworthy

41
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,511
It is such a shame

42
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:45,136
You always carry your office frustrations home

43
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,011
If you do not like the news you read,
why don't you just tell them so?

44
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:48,844
I did tell them!

45
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:54,177
Mr. Suravaram Chandrasekhar,
what is this nonsense since the last 15 years?

46
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:58,136
We must show news that is useful to the society Sir

47
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:01,843
Why do you harass us even at this retirement stage, Sir?

48
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:05,718
Do your job if you like to, else resign and leave

49
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:06,344
Roll

50
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,678
If any lovers are seen in parks on lovers' day...

51
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:16,678
Back in the days, there were morals and ethics
in journalism. Now, there are no such things

52
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:21,969
My grandfather was a noted reporter for Swadesi Mitra Patrika

53
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:27,261
My father followed his footsteps and
I inspired by my father became a Doordarshan News reader

54
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:30,218
While People inherit wealth,

55
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,469
we inherited ideals

56
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:37,011
Huh! What's the use? They just bring trouble

57
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:41,511
Do you know my only reason
for happiness amidst all these problems?

58
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,053
My son, at least,
has not entered this media field

59
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,636
That was not by his choice. You forbid it

60
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,053
Whatever be the reason, he is happy, right?

61
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,303
How can you say he is happy?

62
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,303
As his father, wouldn't I know that?

63
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:57,469
Following my advice, he is in a comfortable IT job

64
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,844
Do you know what have I always prayed for?

65
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,969
He should never touch the camera

66
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,844
He should never hold the mike

67
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,511
He should never enter the media field at all

68
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,844
Pub culture in on the rise in Hyderabad

69
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,928
Among the popular ones is Nectar pub.
They are illegally selling drugs here

70
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,719
This club is run by a powerful politician

71
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,178
And that's why Excise and
Police departments stay away from it

72
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,969
Many innocent minors are getting
addicted to drugs and ruining their lives

73
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,178
They don't come for coke but for cocaine

74
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,969
They don't take a peg, they want the drug

75
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:40,719
Exclusively for TV99 viewers with Cameraman
Rambabu, this is Arjun Lenin Suravaram

76
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,636
Is it recorded? Yes, Come on

77
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,011
Why do we risk our lives for this unpopular channel?

78
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:49,011
Hey, you should join a devotional channel.
You will be a perfect fit

79
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:53,593
Sure, that devotion is better than this nonsense.
Also, you know, I'm expecting some good news today

80
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,136
Why?

81
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:57,053
I forwarded one Sai Baba message yesterday
to 30 people on whatsapp

82
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,219
It will work dude

83
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:01,303
Do some real work for now

84
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:13,136
Oh no, poor girl! She is using an injection.
Maybe she has fever

85
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,511
That is not a medicine

86
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,844
It is MDMA, Methylene-deoxy-methamphetamine,
a psychoactive drug

87
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:19,261
It is also called a recreation drug

88
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:21,636
why take such risks for recreation?

89
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,678
Why not drink some alcohol,
eat biryani and sleep?

90
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,303
I do the same

91
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:33,344
Oh no!
The camera has fallen down

92
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:38,053
Oh no!
The camera has fallen down

93
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:40,719
Let me go and get it before someone finds it

94
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:41,969
Hey, don't tell them it's me.

95
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,928
Hi - Hi

96
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,303
I am Arjun

97
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,511
Arjun

98
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:26,386
What do you need?

99
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,928
That car key is mine

100
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,011
I know

101
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,053
How do you know it is mine?

102
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:34,219
I know this is not a car key but a camera

103
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:43,428
Bro, did you take the car key?
It's BMW, XYZ series

104
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,261
Let's go dude, babes are waiting

105
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:48,969
I cannot wait any longer

106
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,011
Your covering is terrible.
She knows that's a camera

107
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:57,178
Sorry madam

108
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:58,928
Why did you put the camera?

109
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,219
Did you come to shoot the girls here?

110
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:02,386
There is not a single figure here worth that effort

111
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:06,177
Is it so? If I give this camera to the bouncers,
they will tell you who's worth what

112
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,511
No! Hey, go man

113
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,261
Hello madam, excuse me

114
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,553
Hello, just excuse me
What?

115
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,261
Listen to me
what?

116
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:13,886
I will explain

117
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:16,428
Tell

118
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,219
They are supplying drugs in this pub

119
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:21,636
What, I cannot hear you

120
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,553
They are supplying drugs in this pub

121
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,553
I still can't hear

122
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:31,886
we are doing a sting operation
They are selling drugs in this pub!

123
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,844
That's how you must say for her to hear!

124
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:43,428
Why is everyone looking at me like that, dude?
You said it loudly enough for not just her, but everyone present!

125
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,469
Why is he walking towards me?

126
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:57,761
Hey, I have a plan. There is an exit on the right side

127
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:01,386
I will run first and then you follow me

128
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:04,678
Why did boars come into this pub?

129
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,636
Sir, Have you seen my friends?

130
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,386
Don't you know?

131
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:18,927
Oh no

132
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:21,969
No exit here or here either. How do I get out man?

133
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:25,386
Run fast.
Fast? This sting operation has stung me hard.

134
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,469
Oh no, stop guys. I am done

135
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:32,303
Which channel do you report for?

136
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,843
How do you know that I am a reporter?

137
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:38,011
I got a doubt when you identified the car key as a camera

138
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,344
And now you just confirmed it

139
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:43,678
Oh! I am a journalism aspirant.
I studied in the UK

140
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,136
You work at?
BBC - BBC?

141
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:48,678
Yeah, BBC

142
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:49,844
What's BBC, dude?

143
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,261
We must not reveal our channel's name in a sting operation, Is it?

144
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:56,011
Looking at you two,
I can hardly believe that

145
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:57,094
We too can't believe it!

146
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,469
I mean, we joined just this morning

147
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,678
TThat is British broadCast?

148
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,553
Hey, where is my bag?

149
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:05,344
What bag? Isn't it enough that I managed to escape

150
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,011
Hey, laptop and all the footage we shot is in that bag

151
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,594
All our effort is wasted,
Sorry dude

152
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,261
Will this be useful?

153
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,094
Are you really from BBC?

154
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:31,511
Trust me

155
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,594
Hey, you won't say even the truth so convincingly!
Anything for breaking news!

156
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,469
Let's Dance

These guys work for BBC

173
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:48,803
Arjun, can I have your number please?

174
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,178
Number it seems, give it

175
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:02,761
♫ Wolves in sheepskin ♫

176
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:07,761
♫ Nothing escapes our eye,
Truth may lie in the darkest corners ♫

177
00:16:07,803 --> 00:16:12,510
♫ But even when we bring the truth to light,
not sure how much of it reaches the public ♫

178
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,928
♫ until we see it on TV screens
and then our heads start spinning again ♫

179
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:19,428
When will you solve the RTC strike issue?
When are you going to address the Sand shortage?

180
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:41,761
♫ Confusion...
Chaos.. ♫

181
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,136
Hey Balaji
Hello Uncle

182
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,969
Where are you these days? Not to be seen?

183
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:53,969
I am a lawyer, Uncle. It has been hectic
at the court with too many cases to handle

184
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,428
But your dad said you are not going to the court at all.
Is that what he said?

185
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:02,303
Even if you do go to the court,
who is stupid enough to trust you with their case?

186
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:10,218
A peculiar case of a son cheating his father has come
Should I tell you about that uncle?

187
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:14,094
A son cheating his father? Sounds interesting,
Tell me more.. Balaji, The son is a journali...

188
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,011
Arjun is waiting for you

189
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,468
Well, the case is postponed uncle,
I shall talk about it some other time

190
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,302
Ok

191
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,136
Idiot

192
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,261
Same to you, aunty

193
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:30,678
“Oh dear one, my dear secret friend”
Oh no!

194
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,761
Your broom, Thanks Lawyer sir,
It is my duty

195
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:45,261
Lawyer Sir, I wished you good morning on
Whatsapp and you didn't reply

196
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:46,261
I didn't check

197
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,928
Such a lie! I did see two blue ticks

198
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,594
You caught me there, you naughty!
I miss you!

199
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,719
I need to leave now

200
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:59,011
Shall I tell you what I feel when I see you, Lawyer Sir?

201
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:04,803
Your fragrance is like the smell
of a mop drenched in phenyl

202
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:16,719
Wow, that makes my day,
- But you cheated me

203
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:21,386
Me? Swear and say Did I ever even touch
you in my life? You just did

204
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,803
Even her compliments stink.

205
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:30,428
You need a shower dude

206
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:36,594
So, BBC is your dream?
Yeah

207
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,553
You know what is my dream?

208
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,136
Everyone must have problems

209
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:44,928
everyone should then need lawyers
and everyone should come only to me

210
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:47,053
I will then become a great and famous lawyer

211
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:49,136
It is in your hands to turn my dream into a reality

212
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:50,636
In my hands? Yes - How?

213
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:54,428
Make me sit as a panelist in just one LIVE debate
show on your TV channel and that shall be enough

214
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,844
What is the relation between a
debate show and you getting popular?

215
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,844
Crazy man!

216
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:03,719
Popularity that we do not get by arguing any number of cases in court,
we get by sitting in just one LIVE debate show

217
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,969
It will make me famous

218
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,761
People will recognize me, take selfies
and my Twitter followers will increase too

219
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:12,219
Hashtag with my name will go viral.
Please, please dude

220
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:13,511
Ok - Ok?

221
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:21,761
Did she play them or did she get played?
Let us see who used whom on our big debate

222
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,261
Today's panel members are Pavitra, our victim

223
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:24,677
Sakunthala madam

224
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:30,928
Instead of saying that girl has been exploited,
it sounds better if you say she played them

225
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:36,219
See, it is a completely negative mindset.
I cannot support her argument

226
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:40,427
Who the hell are you to support and decide
what is positive or negative? Who the hell are you?

227
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:43,343
Sakunthala madam, please calm down,
What? Madam, please show some respect

228
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:47,052
Oh no - I've become so by giving respect to all

229
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,344
Cry, cry now

230
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:55,553
Do not cry dear. I am here for you,
Everyone's watching, this is broadcast live

231
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,469
How long will you use girls like this?
For how long?

232
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:00,093
What is your worry, idiot?
What is it?

233
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,927
Do not point a finger,
I will when I am frustrated

234
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:04,302
Talk carefully,
Do not point your finger

235
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,052
Talk properly, What is this?
Styling your hair with gel doesn't make you a gentleman.

236
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,469
Hey, why are they fighting like this on a LIVE show, dude?

237
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:15,386
You wanted to become famous right?
THIS is your chance. Go, Slay!

238
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:17,053
Ok, I will take care of it now

239
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,719
Hey, stop it,
Silence

240
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:26,011
For example, when milk is overflowing on the stove,
one must turn the gas off

241
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:30,261
But if you only blow at the milk instead,
it will rise up and fall over

242
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:35,469
Similarly, go to a Police station if you have some problem
Go to the court if you need a solution

243
00:20:35,553 --> 00:20:37,511
There will be many efficient lawyers like me

244
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,844
Is Constitution of India dead?

245
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:44,719
Those fighting on the streets behave better than you,
You should have some basic sense

246
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:45,761
What is this sound pollution?

247
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:48,136
What you said is correct Sir,
I do not have the energy to talk with you sir

248
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:52,511
Talking to you increases my stress levels Sir
Not that Sir... - Do not point your finger Sir

249
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,510
See sister, he is accusing me,
You wait

250
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:59,177
Please calm down,
Why are you preaching like a holy saint?

251
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,802
Hello,
What?

252
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,260
I am holier than that Pavitra

253
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,844
- Is it?
Yes, My foot

254
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,011
Damn! I don't want to put my mouth in your mouth

255
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,136
Mouth to mouth means lip kiss, right Sir?

256
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,761
What did he say?
He is talking of a lip kiss

257
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:17,218
Oh no! On Live television,
you dare ask me for a lip kiss?

258
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,135
Madam, that is not what I meant,
You rascal

259
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:21,343
Madam, this is a live show,
I do not mean to argue with you

260
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:24,844
Hey, she is actually beating me!
Shakuntala madam, please

261
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:26,178
Please madam

262
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:31,178
I will not let you get away,
People like you make this world a filthy place to live in

263
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:36,886
What happened, man?
Oh no! Kavya dude - Kavya

264
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:42,511
Hi Arjun - Hi Kavya,
where are you?

265
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:45,178
I am in TV99,
Oh, what are you doing here?

266
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,761
I mean, what are you doing there?

267
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:48,386
I will start as a reporter here

268
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:52,303
Hello, hello

269
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,094
Give me some space

270
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,303
Where are you?
I am at my channel's office

271
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:59,844
Oh, are you in BBC? - Yeah

272
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:04,428
I was thinking of calling you and you called me instead

273
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:11,261
Shall we meet in the evening?

274
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:12,761
Sure

275
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,011
I feel it is wrong to lie to her

276
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,052
I will meet her this evening and tell her everything

277
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:24,886
Hey, lie as much as you want to girls and they would still believe

278
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,303
But try telling the truth for once and they will never believe that!

279
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:30,177
They are sadists dude,
What shall we do now?

280
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:31,303
I am wondering too

281
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,344
How do I get out of here?

282
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,011
Hey, are you still alive?

283
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:39,219
Sakunthala bust my arse!
Please tell me the way to exit.

284
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,553
Hi Kavya - Hi,
When did you come? - Just now

285
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:45,427
What is wrong?
Kavya

286
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:48,803
I am going to share some happy news,
with you all. Come on

287
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:51,968
A new reporter is joining our channel from today

288
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:55,302
Welcome Miss Kavya - Thank you

289
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:58,594
One second! I have yet another small surprise

290
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:02,261
Miss Kavya is my daughter,
Daughter?

291
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,844
Daughter of CEO? - Daughter? - Daughter?

292
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:09,761
Is that a big deal? Come on

293
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,553
Hey Lawyer! - Sakunthala is coming

294
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,718
I will kill you. I am coming, you rascal - Oh no, I am terrified!

295
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,428
We share the same feeling.
Is the game not over yet? No

296
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:20,844
It is dangerous for us to be here

297
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,428
Come Kavya, let me introduce you to our staff
Let us leave from that door. That door seems a little too far.

298
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:30,011
Rama, program producer - Hi Hi Vijay,
camera operator - Hi - Hi

299
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,469
Hello, He is Jayanth, editor.
And this is our Technical staff

300
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:38,011
This is news reader Ramya, Hi,
Hi Composer Manikyam, Hi

301
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:41,261
And this is all our Marketing staff - Hi
Mounik - Hello

302
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:45,260
Vishal and your name...
Shhhh... Be quiet

303
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:50,094
Kavya, If you want,
we can hire extra resources

304
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,678
You idiot...

305
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,303
We have been exposed, dude

306
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,844
I pulled the door instead of pushing it open, sorry

307
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,011
Who are you?

308
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:06,803
I am Arjun's friend,
these are visiting hours I presume.

309
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:14,261
Arjun, they have seen your back enough.
Turn around now.

310
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,678
Oh, it's you Arjun!

311
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:21,219
Why are you standing there? Come, come

312
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:27,761
Kavya, he is Arjun, a senior reporter in our channel

313
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,135
He is Rambabu, our cameraman

314
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,928
Hello madam, nice to meet you.

315
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:36,344
Since how long has he been working here?

316
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:41,011
He is working with us for the past 1 year,
Arjun has immense respect for me and our channel

317
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,053
Hi

318
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,344
Kavya - Huh - What?

319
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:52,636
Kavya, stop

320
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:56,011
Kavya - Don't you dare touch me

321
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:59,719
I can't stand the sight of you.
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

322
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:00,886
Is this a small matter?

323
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:04,303
You thought I would fall for you because you said BBC?

324
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:08,511
How could you think so low of me?

325
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:14,344
I am not angry about this lie Arjun,
I am angry about you being such a dishonest person

326
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,093
If this is the situation due to a small lie

327
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:35,719
imagine what will happen when your father
gets to know that you are a reporter

328
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:38,844
Lawyer Sir,

329
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,136
you spoke so well in the TV debate

330
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:43,178
Did you watch?
Yes

331
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:45,469
Oh God! She saw me being beaten up.

332
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:48,636
What's this?
My heart

333
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,428
You idiot!
Here he comes

334
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,844
I cooked for you at home and you are eating here!
Come, sit

335
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,261
That is I exactly why I am eating here

336
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:01,261
Don't you have any shame?
This is my friend's house

337
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:05,177
You should be ashamed coming to My friend's house
Your friend's son is my friend. You do know that, right?

338
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:09,261
When you come home for breakfast tomorrow,
I will replace the chutney with poison and feed it to you

339
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,678
Both taste the same anyway, Subba Rao

340
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:13,761
See, he addresses his Dad by name

341
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:15,511
What is the problem between you two?

342
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:18,219
He studied law,
But has he ever gone to the Court?

343
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:20,553
He sits at home all day and watches TV

344
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:22,219
You go to the Police station every day

345
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,511
Have you become the Police Commissioner yet?
You are after all a Constable

346
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,553
You idiot

347
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:30,303
I've had to mortgage every asset I had for you to
become a lawyer, but I have not traded my honesty

348
00:26:30,594 --> 00:26:34,553
Go to the Police station, open my locker and
see how many cases I have solved

349
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,469
Only then will one know of my achievements

350
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:39,761
But I don't do this for a promotion,

351
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:41,719
It is for my own satisfaction

352
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:44,261
Hey Balaji,

353
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:49,969
your dad means well for you.
He is the only one tolerating your tantrums

354
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:51,219
Had it been me,

355
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,219
I would have thrown you out of the house long ago.

356
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,511
I need to attend to some urgent work
I have some work too, I'll come along

357
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,094
Why do you need a fruit,
when you have all your honesty Subba Rao?

358
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:03,803
See, whenever I wish to speak
on a matter, this is how they escape

359
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,678
Bujjamma, what is for breakfast?

360
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:07,636
Heart idly, father-in-law

361
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:09,553
Father-in-law?

362
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:14,594
Why haven't we telecast the Pub footage yet?

363
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,428
It is not mentioned in this week's program list either

364
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,136
Arjun Sir asked us not to telecast, madam
- Arjun!

365
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:21,969
What is this?

366
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:25,428
Previous work footage shot by
Arjun for our channel, madam

367
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:26,928
Why are you editing this now?

368
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,803
He has applied for a job at some other channel madam

369
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,011
CEO Sir has asked us to edit this and give

370
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:32,844
Where is Arjun?

371
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:34,594
Why did you call us here?

372
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,428
We recently did a sting operation in a pub

373
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:39,261
We found some students from schools
and colleges taking drugs there

374
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,511
Upon further investigation, we came to
know they are your children

375
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:46,678
Play the footage

376
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:01,928
Don't worry

377
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,303
My intention is not to scare you.
Then why have you called us here?

378
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:05,636
To extort money?

379
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,511
How much do we need to pay up to stop this telecast?

380
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:09,678
As much as you will need to help your kids transform

381
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:12,428
Be assured

382
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,303
this footage will never be telecast

383
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,678
You are spending all your money on your children,

384
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,094
please spend some of your time too

385
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:26,928
Hitting or scolding them will not make a difference.
Instead, sit with them, talk to them

386
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,969
Spend some time with them. Please

387
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:33,928
He's always like this, dear.

388
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,719
Arjun once asked me,

389
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:43,178
if I need four days' worth of sensational news or
would I rather save four lives

390
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:45,719
I agree with his school of thought

391
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:51,886
Since he was not supposed to name the channel during a
sting operation, he must have lied to you about being a BBC reporter

392
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:57,094
Working at BBC is his dream.
He told me so when he joined this channel

393
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,678
That's why I agreed to give him the work
footage for his application

394
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:06,886
It's ok if we can't help him,
but let's try not to come in his way

395
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:19,553
Hello

396
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:26,593
interview for the post of investigative journalist in British Broadcasting
Corporation, that is BBC,

397
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,136
We have sent a formal email to you

398
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:28,844
Ok

399
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:38,803
May I come in Sir

400
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,428
Yes, please come in

401
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:41,678
Have a seat

402
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:42,719
Thank you

403
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:47,636
Mr. Arjun, this opening is for an investigative journalist

404
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,594
It's all about how deeply you can investigate
and how well you present the case

405
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:52,553
Mr. Arjun,

406
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:55,844
we have a case for you to analyze
It's a case of a young lady,

407
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,053
her name was Christine

408
00:29:57,136 --> 00:30:00,886
She was found dead having fallen
from the eighth floor of her apartment building

409
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:05,553
The door was locked from the inside and there were
no traces of any visitors on the security cameras

410
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:09,761
You need to investigate whether this is a
suicide or a murder and as an investigative journalist,

411
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:12,969
how you will present this news in a sensational manner

412
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,594
Sir, one more time please

413
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,719
What? One more time?

414
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:19,553
Is this a movie to show you again and again?

415
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:22,678
It's an interview man. You have a language problem

416
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,011
That's the reason for your hesitation and fumbling

417
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:26,761
People like you do not understand unless
there are Telugu subtitles

418
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:31,053
A girl died falling from the eighth floor
Main door is locked from inside

419
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,719
There is no evidence in the security cameras of anyone visiting her

420
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:37,261
As an investigative journalist,
you should find out whether this is a murder or a suicide

421
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:40,594
And how are you going to present this case
as a sensational news

422
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:43,719
These South Indian reporters are not
capable of presenting in English Sir

423
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,844
What's happening in whose bedroom...
Christine, the victim,

424
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,053
was found dead, jumping from the
eighth floor of the City Tower Apartment

425
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:50,594
However this is considered to be a suicide by the City Police

426
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:55,469
But, we do have a few clues, that'll prove this
was not a suicide but a very well planned murder

427
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:57,761
The victim Christine had freshly painted toe nails

428
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:01,510
As you can see all the toe nails on the right
leg have been painted

429
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,761
But on the left leg, only three of them
have been painted, leaving two unpolished

430
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:08,761
Also the nail polish bottle has been left open
on the table in her living room

431
00:31:08,844 --> 00:31:11,428
Nobody would even care to paint their
toe nails before killing themselves

432
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:15,219
Reports suggest that there were no traces
of any visitors in that apartment

433
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,594
But there were two cups of coffee on that table

434
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:22,386
Which shows us the victim was not alone but had company
And this person would've been a friend

435
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,928
As you can see, the door was also locked from inside

436
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:29,969
Which clearly tells us a fact that he or she was not just a friend,
but more than a friend to her

437
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:33,594
And surprisingly if you all notice,
the security camera footage was all deleted

438
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,053
And even more surprisingly,

439
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:41,553
there was no sign of any struggle at all which leads us to the conclusion
that this was not a suicide but a very, very well planned murder

440
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:44,844
This is Arjun Suravaram, reporting for BBC news

441
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:51,053
English is just a language Sir, not knowledge

442
00:31:58,386 --> 00:31:59,469
Mr. Arjun

443
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,552
We been Selected

444
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,719
Congratulations

445
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:06,553
Thank you sir..
Thank you

446
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,094
One Second, One Second

447
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,219
Congratulations
- Thanku Sir,

448
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:25,219
You made our TV99 proud

449
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:31,928
If tomorrow, someone asks you which channel
did you work for previously, you must say TV99 - Claps - Sure Sir

450
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:35,802
Congrats, you achieved it

451
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:38,594
He should be your role model, understood
Got it, Sir-Yes Sir

452
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:42,261
Kavya is the one who sent your work footage to BBC

453
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,511
Thank you for sending across the footage, Kavya

454
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,719
Please keep your 'thank you' to yourself

455
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:54,428
Are you still angry with me?

456
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:57,761
What I said to you is no more
a lie, but a reality now. A lie is always a lie

457
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,636
Correct, but hiding the truth is equally wrong

458
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:05,178
No one here is hiding any truth

459
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:08,844
Is that so? Then why did you chat with me at the ice cream store?
- Because I knew you

460
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,428
You asked for my phone number.
- Because I had some work

461
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,136
You call me every day?
- Because I don't have anything else to do

462
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:13,719
Why did my lie make you cry?

463
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,636
I need to go

464
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:27,553
Where to?

465
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:30,094
Personal

466
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:30,969
What personal?

467
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,761
None of your business

468
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:47,594
Arjun!

469
00:33:52,844 --> 00:34:00,094
BBC cake, dude! Cut it Cut it!
What are you waiting for? Cut it

470
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:29,803

But, I don't know how to say it

507
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:30,719
You can tell me whatever it is

508
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,761
I want to tell my father that I am a reporter

509
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:38,053
Is this why you brought me to this coffee shop?

510
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:40,219
No Kavya,

511
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,261
it's just that I am not sure if he will understand

512
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:46,011
He is your father Arjun

513
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,511
He will understand a few things only if you tell him

514
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:53,969
Those who love us, understand even the unsaid, Kavya

515
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:12,928
Hey, drag him out
- Ok Sir

516
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:16,011
Hey, get up
Get up, move idiot

517
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:17,469
Sir, where are you taking me?

518
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:18,843
Arjun!
- Move

519
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:20,094
I think it's a mistake Sir

520
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,677
Sir please - Move idiot Sir,
what did I do? Keep moving.

521
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:23,969
Sir... Sir, please say

522
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,802
Sir, please... Sir

523
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,635
Why are you arresting him without any reason?

524
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:29,761
He forged his Degree certificate, he's a fraud

525
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:35,303
What should I do if not arrest him?
Exchange love notes with him like you?

526
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,760
Sir, stop Sir. You can't go in without permission Sir

527
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:50,553
Hey... Sir, please stop
Who's Karthik here? Stop Sir

528
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,261
I'm Karthik Sir

529
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,593
Rascal, all your misdoings... Sir?
Put him in the Jeep

530
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:56,843
What happened, Sir? Sir
Move rascal, move

531
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:59,678
Sir, why are you taking me Sir? Please Sir

532
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:12,260
Sir, don't hit Sir. We know nothing Sir Sir,
please don't hit Sir We don't know Sir, really

533
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:16,094
Please don't hit Sir!
You rascals, how dare you?

534
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:26,636
Sir...
Excuse me Sir

535
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,136
Who are you?

536
00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:33,969
My name is Arjun Sir. I've nothing
to do with the forgery case Sir

537
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,428
What is your profession?

538
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,969
I work as reporter in TV99 Sir

539
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:39,511
What, reporter in TV99?

540
00:39:41,303 --> 00:39:44,303
Why didn't you say so before?
I would have shown double the respect to you

541
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,427
We don't take such complaints madam
FIR number 225

542
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,219
I'm receiving obscene messages Sir

543
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:17,094
Why are you hitting him Sir?
You have no right to hit without a reason

544
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:18,011
Who are you?

545
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,303
I'm a lawyer and this is my ID card

546
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:21,594
I'm Arjun's friend

547
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:23,344
Who are you?

548
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:25,136
I'm Arjun's father, Sir

549
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,803
What's the reason to arrest them Sir?

550
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,428
Education loan forgery

551
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:44,011
These five idiots cheated banks
and took education loans

552
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:48,761
They submitted fake documents to prove they are studying
MBA and MS in London's Cambridge University

553
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:58,011
These guys individually have cheated five different banks.
Not one or two rupees but a total of 13 Crore rupees

554
00:40:58,094 --> 00:40:59,552
13 crores?

555
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:01,094
They planned and looted

556
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:03,218
Sir, I haven't taken any loan in any bank Sir

557
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,803
Hey, do not interrupt when sir is talking

558
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:06,761
Sir, what proof do you have that they are the culprits?

559
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,594
Hey, get the documents

560
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:13,219
These are the documents they submitted to the bank

561
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:16,511
Duplicates that look exactly like the originals

562
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:23,178
Fake Degree Certificates, fake school certificates,
fake passport, driving license, PAN card, ration card...

563
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,385
They didn't leave anything out

564
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:27,303
They made all fakes and cheated five banks

565
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:32,386
My certificates, my ID proofs and my signatures

566
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:34,219
All these are mine Sir

567
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:35,928
That's why we arrested you

568
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:41,636
Sir, those education loans must have been
transferred into some bank account

569
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:42,928
Did you check those account numbers?

570
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:47,386
All those accounts are on their names. We couldn't trace them
so far as wrong addresses were stated in those bank accounts

571
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:52,178
Three days ago, as part of BBC's background
verification process, his address was provided to us

572
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:53,844
That's how we caught him

573
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,844
Using the same method,

574
00:41:55,886 --> 00:42:01,678
we collected the details of all those whose background verification
was done in the last one year, from all Police stations in Hyderabad

575
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:03,594
And that's how we caught hold of all these guys

576
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:05,511
Sir,

577
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:08,011
my son works in a software company

578
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:10,719
He has nothing to do with BBC Sir

579
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,594
There's been some mistake somewhere

580
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,594
Software Company!
Do you know where he works?

581
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,135
In Infosys Company Sir

582
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,469
Huh! It's been one year since your son quit that job

583
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,718
He joined as a reporter in TV99

584
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,843
Father is not even aware of what the son is doing

585
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:26,844
Sir, please

586
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:29,719
Not just the banks but he cheated even you

587
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,678
Is this true?

588
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:49,219
Please don't judge them as criminals
based on these papers alone, Sir

589
00:42:49,344 --> 00:42:49,928
Hello

590
00:42:50,261 --> 00:42:58,553
these very 'papers' are proof whether a person is dead or live,
educated or not, is eligible to vote or not, Sir

591
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:03,761
Hey, book an FIR and put them all behind bars
- Sir, please Sir

592
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:06,303
Sir, he may have just told a small lie

593
00:43:06,428 --> 00:43:09,636
He wouldn't have done all this, Sir
He wouldn't have cheated Sir. Sir please Sir

594
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:13,928
You came with the lawyer, right? Settle it in court
Please sir, tell them not to file the FIR

595
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,928
Please Sir, tell them

596
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,761
Take your hands off me!
Please sir. Take your hands off me

597
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,094
You dare hit my father?

598
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:29,219
Rascal, how dare you kick a policeman!
Sir... - Beat him up

599
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,552
Will you hit the police, rascal?

600
00:43:32,553 --> 00:43:34,844
Sir, please ask them to stop sir
Sir, he's kid Sir

601
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:38,386
I beg you Sir. Leave him Sir
Go, Please Sir, Hit him

602
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:44,178
At least you tell him, Subba Rao
Please Sir, -ask them to let him go, Please Sir, leave him

603
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,261
Beat him up!
- I beg you Sir

604
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:54,469
After examining the preliminary evidence,
it is clear that these five conspired and cheated the banks

605
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:59,344
With no fear of law or punishment,
such crimes are on the rise

606
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,844
This crime cannot be excused

607
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:07,844
they are sentenced to one year of imprisonment under section 120B of IPC
and another six years under sections 417 and 420 for cheating the banks

608
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:11,886
In total, they shall be sentenced
to seven years of rigorous imprisonment

609
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:18,802
This special court orders them to deposit
the loot amount of 13 crores within 10 days,

610
00:44:18,803 --> 00:44:27,261
To discourage anyone from attempting such forgeries in future,
this special court issues an interim order to cancel the certificates of the accused

611
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:28,678
The court is adjourned

612
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,261
I didn't commit any mistake Sir
Sir, please Sir

613
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:44,510
Sir how will you recover the 13 crores? Did they commit this crime
together? Are you going to get the money from them or not?

614
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:46,469
What action are you taking to ensure such
crimes do not occur again?

615
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,344
Move aside, move

616
00:44:53,678 --> 00:44:56,261
Move aside, move

617
00:44:58,553 --> 00:44:59,261

After that, no one will believe us

623
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:20,261
Sir,

624
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,136
Can I please call my mother?

625
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:24,094

My mom is waiting at the hospital for
me to arrange the money for the surgery Sir

630
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:39,844
I need to inform her Sir

Where are your parents?
- In Chittoor Sir

632
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:44,928
Do they know about your arrest?
- No Sir

633
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:45,969
Hey - Please Sir

634
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:47,094

How is dad?

638
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:08,678
We are waiting for you, son

639
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:10,053
Did you get the money?

640
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:12,219
Did your office give you the loan?

641
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:16,928
Mom
I cannot arrange the money for the operation

642
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:19,261
What is wrong, son?
Why do you sound so desolate?

643
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:20,761
Tell me son, what is the matter?

644
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:28,094
Police have arrested me, accusing me of cheating
banks with fake documents, mom

645
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:32,094
Court has cancelled all my certificates, mom

646
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,928
My life is over, mom. I am ruined!

647
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:39,344
What are you saying, son?
I don't understand what is happening

648
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:43,344
When will you deposit the surgery fee?
How long can we postpone the operation?

649
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:45,261
Is this a charity home where you can stay free of cost?

650
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:50,427
No sir, my son will come today for sure

651
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:54,386
The chief doctor has asked us to discharge your husband,
if you don't pay the money by tomorrow

652
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:57,428
Why don't you go to Government hospitals,
instead of troubling us like this?

653
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:59,136
Why do you come to harass us?

654
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:05,136
Karthik

655
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:08,178
You took great troubles to educate me, mom

656
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:12,678
But, I am of no use to you now.
- Don't say such things, dear

657
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:17,178
No mom, it doesn't matter if I live or die

658
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:18,927
My life is a waste, mom

659
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,469
Who is that on the phone, Lakshmi?

660
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:22,678
Is it Karthik?

661
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:27,344
Ask him to come fast. I long to see him

662
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,386
What is wrong, dear?
Why are you crying?

663
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:39,343
These five idiots cheated banks and took education loans
It is clear they cheated banks with intended conspiracy

664
00:47:39,344 --> 00:47:44,886
Education loan forgery, To cancel their certificates
Passport, driving license, PAN card, ration card, do not leave anything

665
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:48,927
What have you done with the 1300 crores you stole?
Will you recover money from them or not?

666
00:47:48,928 --> 00:47:50,968
This special court issues interim orders

667
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,635
Are their parents involved too in this cheating?

668
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,386
Karthik, Is it justified to betray meritorious
students for your greed?

669
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,344
Hello, Karthik

670
00:47:58,594 --> 00:48:02,011
Karthik, come to me dear,
I am very frightened

671
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,678

Damn! Hey, clear this first

675
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:32,094
Karthik,
Move, move

676
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:32,969
Karthik

677
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:35,719
what happened son?
Why don't you talk, son?

678
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:37,593
There has been an accident at Punjagutta centre

679
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:39,511
Accused Karthik spot dead

680
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:42,511
Accused Karthik spot dead

681
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:54,344
Karthik... Karthik... Oh no!

682
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:59,719
Oh no, my son! Karthik...

683
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:07,969
We often see Chit fund and Credit Card scams but
the new scam on the block, is Education Loan forgery

684
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:09,844
Is making news.

685
00:49:09,928 --> 00:49:13,968
Police have arrested the five graduates behind this scam

686
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:19,136
One of the accused died trying to escape by
jumping out of the police van

687
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:25,761
After this incident, the other four have been
granted a conditional bail with self guarantee

688
00:49:26,053 --> 00:49:36,928
Police are now also questioning bank officials as a bank Manager is
reported missing. Looks like this case is getting more and more complicated

689
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,969
No BBC nothing,

690
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:43,218
I just need my son to stay safe with me

691
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:47,719
This incident leaves parents worried
about the future of their children

692
00:49:56,678 --> 00:49:57,761
Balaji

693
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:01,761
Take these house documents,
Uncle

694
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:07,969
Sell this house and everything in it at whatever
price and get the money we need

695
00:50:08,636 --> 00:50:12,344
Take this and Let us pay the court's fine and be done

696
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:19,844
Let us not stay here anymore.
Let us go to a place where no one recognizes us

697
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:23,553
Hey, what is this senseless talk?

698
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:29,594
Will selling the house or
paying the court fine solve our problem?

699
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:31,553
We will achieve nothing

700
00:50:32,178 --> 00:50:38,261
All the education you provided to your son
with such great difficulty, is now void

701
00:50:38,344 --> 00:50:42,844
The Court has stamped your son's certificates as fake

702
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:49,636
Your son today is as good as an uneducated idiot

703
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:52,053
He will never get a job in his life

704
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,844
He will have to beg or live as a daily wage labourer

705
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:57,011
You have to submit all your certificates in a week

706
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,761
You are aware this is an international channel

707
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:03,136
If all documents and procedures are not perfect,
we will not confirm you for the job

708
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:04,386
Its in your hand.

709
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:09,969
Arjun,

710
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:13,761
these are the case details I have collected
In this case. Along with five of you,

711
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:20,761
there are four youth in Khammam, four in Rajahmundry, two from Nizamabad
and two more in Guntur who have been arrested under similar charges

712
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,261
And we don't know how many more
out there have been arrested

713
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:24,178
Arjun,

714
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:30,553
these documents tell us the students
are from different cities and different colleges

715
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:32,886
They have no link to each other

716
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:35,844
But they are all tied together by
the same conspiracy

717
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,928
Arjun, we need to find out who is behind this

718
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:44,469
Do not think link a victim Arjun,
think like a reporter

719
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:10,053
What happened Arjun?

720
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:16,719
The photo on this original certificate and on that fake
certificate in the Police station is the same

721
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:24,094
Not just that, in fact, this same photo
exists on all the loan papers as well

722
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:27,136
Do you think the certificates and
photos were leaked from your college?

723
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,094
It is highly impossible for such a leak to
occur from a Government College

724
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:33,344
If not from the college, then where?

725
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:35,803
Leak from JNTU means...

726
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:39,969
Balaji, in addition to my certificates,
I did use this same photo at another place

727
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:40,844
Where?

728
00:52:43,178 --> 00:52:44,136
DoT consultancy

729
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:54,761
Hey flower - seller

730
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:56,136
What, Sir?

731
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,760
This consultancy office is closed,
When do they open?

732
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:01,136
No idea Sir, it is closed since a long time

733
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:06,177
Hey, I am trying to find out and
why did you have to break the lock meanwhile?

734
00:53:06,178 --> 00:53:08,511
There will be trouble if someone spots me in my uniform here

735
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,469
If this is closed from long as she says it is,

736
00:53:11,678 --> 00:53:13,011
why is this lock so new?

737
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,053
It means someone is coming here, on the sly.

738
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:17,511
Hey, you stand guard outside,
Ok

739
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,011
Let us go inside

740
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:23,303
Hey, won't this shutter go any further up?

741
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:38,928
Why is the place so big, dude?

742
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,678
Look thoroughly everywhere

743
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:41,844
We should not miss a single paper

744
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,303
We have searched everywhere
and cannot find a single clue

745
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:13,094
I didn't find any clue either

746
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:16,010
I already told you Arjun,

747
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:20,344
the certificates must have been leaked from your college
Listen to me and let us quickly get out of here

748
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:11,594
What is this Arjun, looks exactly like an original certificate?

749
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:44,969
Oh My God!

750
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:54,678
B Sc, B Com, B Tech, MBA...
All kinds of certificates are here

751
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:57,428
Hey, this is an MBBS certificate dude!

752
00:55:57,636 --> 00:55:59,260
I think I have seen this Doctor somewhere

753
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:02,178
Arjun, look here. Holograms of all Universities!

754
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:08,719
The holograms are original. To print these,
one must definitely have Government license

755
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:10,803
Arjun, look so many stamps here

756
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:22,469
Nagarjuna University, Osmania University, JNTU, Andhra University,
Kakatiya University, All the Universities! Stamps of every University are here

757
00:56:23,386 --> 00:56:26,594
But these certificates are not enough to get a loan from the bank.
One will need more documents

758
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,928
There are only certificates here.
I do not understand this Arjun.

759
00:56:32,386 --> 00:56:33,428
Don't you still get it?

760
00:56:33,844 --> 00:56:39,844
As we suspected, they are not just taking education loans based on
fake education certificates. They are even Selling these fake certificates

761
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:42,928
This is a BIG scam

762
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:50,635
Now, I remember. Last month I had gone to this guy for
Malaria vaccine and he injected here instead of giving it here

763
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:52,843
I had such a big swelling, I was suspicious then itself.

764
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:54,969
At the outset, this Consultancy seems like it is aiding students

765
00:56:55,469 --> 00:56:56,844
But in reality, it is only ruining their lives!

766
00:56:56,928 --> 00:56:58,928
Just like it ruined my life,
Frauds! Rascals!

767
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:03,344
Then there must be so many fraud Doctors
and fraud Engineers all across our society

768
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,011
We should somehow get a hold of this, Arjun

769
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:06,969
Yes, there are photos on the certificates

770
00:57:07,053 --> 00:57:09,511
We can trace them and know who they are

771
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:15,218
How will we trace them with just these photos?
How will we know where and which department they belong to?

772
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:18,511
This is very tough.
This is practically impossible

773
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:20,678
It Is possible

774
00:57:21,928 --> 00:57:28,719
Including our channel, there are 44 satellite channels in total across
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Of them, 17 are News channels,

775
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:35,219
where we know reporters and these reporters know,
friends, their friends of friends...

776
00:57:35,636 --> 00:57:39,303
There will be at least one person we know in every channel,
We should take their help

777
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:43,636
Kavya, email these fake certificate details to everyone.

778
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:44,469
Ok

779
00:57:44,844 --> 00:57:49,928
Just ensure the News must be telecast on all news channels
on the same day, at the same time and in the same manner

780
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,053
Why at the same time?

781
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,386
We will be safe only if we do so

782
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,594
Won't there be a problem if news is
unofficially telecast in this manner?

783
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:58,803
I am counting on that. For only when
a problem arises, we find a solution

784
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:02,928
Ok dude, but what news should we telecast?

785
00:58:07,094 --> 00:58:11,719
In the raids by special task force in Hyderabad,
many fake certificates have been seized

786
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,969
Many of those imposters may be employed in
Government and private sectors

787
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:16,594
We are now going to show you their details

788

790
00:58:28,928 --> 00:58:31,261
Hello Dear, your photo is on TV

What are you talking about? - Yes,
they are also showing your certificates.

792
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,011

Pa

797
00:59:33,053 --> 00:59:36,011
The fake certificate news is being shown on
not just one but all channels

798
00:59:36,053 --> 00:59:37,511
I have no idea how this leaked to the media

799
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,968
A man named Karthik was found dead yesterday

800
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:41,553
Looks like the matter will escalate

801
00:59:41,636 --> 00:59:45,719
Everyone working with us in our fake certificate
offices is worried and repeatedly calling to ask about this news

802
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:47,136
They are concerned about this information leak

803
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,719
If they get caught, we will be traced too

804
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,719
Suresh Babu, age 29, Kakatiya University,
B Sc certificate of year 2004

Raghu, age 31, Nagarjuna University,

806
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:02,386
How many in total?
52 members

807
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:05,719
Who conducted this raid?

808
01:00:05,844 --> 01:00:08,969
The police did not do this raid
Even an FIR has not been filed

809
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:10,969
Then this must be fake news

810
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:14,053
We do not need to worry about this

811
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:19,844
No! If this is fake news, then we should worry for real

812
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:25,678
Do these 52 people have any link with one another?

813
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:28,178
All are working in different departments

814
01:00:28,303 --> 01:00:30,511
They would have never met or seen each other

815
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:35,053
Which means, we are the
Only common link between them

816
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:44,761
Check which consultancy branch did these
52 certificates, leak from?

817
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:54,344
All certificates are from our Ameerpet branch, Pa

818
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:56,969
Who is In-charge of that branch?

819
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:03,344
I am that branch's in-charge,
but I have no connection with what has happened

820
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:06,135
Wait a minute. Not 52 but 51

821
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:08,678
One certificate does not match in any of our branches

822
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:12,635
Whose is that certificate?

823
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:17,344

826
01:01:30,136 --> 01:01:32,428
Did you take the certificate to show it on TV? This is bad, dude

827
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:35,844
I am going to get to them with your help,
You are my trump card

828
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:39,094
You will say anything, Trump card, Obama card, Bush card

829
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:42,261
Didn't you find anyone else?
No dude, I am scared

830
01:01:42,386 --> 01:01:44,344
Do not fear. You will have no trouble

01:01:44,886 --> 01:01:45,553
I am here for you

832
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,386
OK, that is reassuring

836
01:02:12,136 --> 01:02:15,469
Arjun, I have reached. I am on the road opposite
my office Tell me what do I do now?

837
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:17,928
Do not get anxious after listening to what
I am about to tell you now

838
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:20,261
They are going to kidnap you in some time

839
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,593
What? Kidnap? How are you saying this so casually, man?
Sir, a life of royalty shall commence from today for you

840
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:26,178
Sir, glorious fortunes will embrace you from today
They have already started. You please leave

841
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:27,136
What now?

842
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:27,844
Yes dude,

843
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:31,678
Only when they kidnap you,
I can follow them and know their hideout.

844
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:34,178
We can catch the entire gang together

845
01:02:34,553 --> 01:02:37,011
But they will not kidnap you until I come out

846
01:02:37,303 --> 01:02:38,344
They will just follow you

847
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:40,303
Follow me?
- Yes

848
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:43,136
What is this, dude? How do you know
all this without being here?

849
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:48,178
On your left in 30 feet distance, there is a man inside
a grey building wearing a blue color shirt. Look at him

850
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:53,219
Behind you, at 20 feet distance,
there is a guy wearing a black colour cap

851
01:02:54,011 --> 01:02:56,969
Two people on a bike at 40 feet distance are on your left

852
01:02:57,803 --> 01:02:59,969
A guy in pink shirt and red cap is on your right

853
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,428
All of them are stealthily following you

854
01:03:05,594 --> 01:03:07,218
Ok, but where are you dude?

855
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:08,428
I am following you too

856
01:03:08,803 --> 01:03:12,344
Opposite you at 50 feet, I am in the red car

857
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:16,553
Thank God!
Looks like he is talking to some body

858
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:19,678
Why is he talking on the phone outside
without going into his office?

859
01:03:19,803 --> 01:03:21,511
Maybe he is meeting someone,
Yes

860
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,011
Wait for my order

861
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:25,344
Ok, what should I do now?
I am sure you have a plan, right?

862
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,552
There is a guy in blue shirt, sipping tea, sitting on a bike,
on your left. Yes

863
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:32,510
Sir, I really recommend this policy Sir

864
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:34,053
Go and keep talking to him. Wait for my word

865
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:35,844
Ok

866
01:03:39,053 --> 01:03:40,510
Excuse me,
Yes

867
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:41,428
Is this tea nice, Sir?

868
01:03:41,511 --> 01:03:42,553
It tastes just like my wife's tea

869
01:03:42,594 --> 01:03:43,593
It is that good?

870
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:45,011
You clearly aren't married then!

871
01:03:45,261 --> 01:03:47,553
No Sir, how do you know that?
Experience

872
01:03:49,094 --> 01:03:53,011
It does not seem like he is talking to a stranger.
Looks like he is talking to someone he knows well

873
01:03:53,303 --> 01:03:54,386
I am suspicious about this

874
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:55,886
I asked you to wait, right?

875
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,511
Hey, give him your visiting card

876
01:03:57,678 --> 01:04:00,178
Where is this address Sir?

877
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,802
Will you take an insurance policy
from me if I help you? Of course, I will

878
01:04:03,803 --> 01:04:05,885
What a fool! Agreed to take a policy in return for an address

879
01:04:05,886 --> 01:04:08,428
This idiot is believing my offer

880
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:11,636
I will give you benefits which I have never offered to anyone

881
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:15,094
He has given him a piece of paper and is talking to him.
I think he is the one we are looking for.

882
01:04:15,178 --> 01:04:18,219
Can you also get your family and friends to take policies from me?

883
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,553
They will take it right away Sir,
What?

884
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:23,510
In fact, should I share some shocking news?
They are right here

885
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:28,844
Shall I show you? That guy in red shirt is my brother,
He will take a policy

886
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:33,553
That guy in pink shirt and red cap is my co-brother.
He will also take one policy

887
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:36,719
Those two, sipping tea on that bike.
Yes

888
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:37,844
They are our step brothers

889
01:04:37,886 --> 01:04:39,678
They will take two
- Two - Yes

890
01:04:39,928 --> 01:04:41,968
That guy talking on the phone, up there

891
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:46,718
He is pointing at our boys. Surely,
he is the one we are looking for.

892
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,136
Three policies?!

893
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,011
Three! Sir

894
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,760
Sir, you are God sent for me!
No, they will only send you to that God

895
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:55,428
What?

896
01:04:55,511 --> 01:04:57,761
Keep the visiting card in his pocket and Move

897
01:04:57,969 --> 01:04:58,969
Keep this card. Bye - Sir...

898
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,553
You had asked me for this address and are now
leaving without finding out?

899
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:03,886
That is my card and I am that lawyer

900
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:04,886
You? - Yes

901
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:06,302
I don't understand, Sir

902
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,969
You will understand everything in some time

903
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:08,511
What does that mean?

904
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:10,678
What next?

905
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:11,761
Thank you Sir

906
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:14,053
He is leaving from here. He is leaving

907
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:16,178
Go get him guys

908
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:25,843
Come on Sir, give me your Aadhar cards and ID proofs

909
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:28,053
Oh no! Hey, no!
Oh no,

910
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,261
who are you guys?

911
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:34,428
Did you check his bag?

912
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:38,303
Brother, he is an insurance agent
An Insurance agent?

913
01:05:39,094 --> 01:05:41,928
Hey, that lawyer is playing around with us. Finish him off

914
01:05:42,136 --> 01:05:42,636
Ok brother

915
01:05:43,136 --> 01:05:46,219
Why did you beat me so much for just
asking an Aadhar card?

916
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:52,761
Hey, our plan worked well,
They are following me

917
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:56,969
They have changed their plan now,
They are not coming to kidnap you

918
01:05:58,469 --> 01:05:59,636
They are coming to kill you

919
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:04,469
What? Kill me?

920
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:07,511
Do something, dude.
What's taking you so long?

921
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,011
What should I do now?

922
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:11,011
RUN

923
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:24,886
Go

924
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:37,469
Push him in guys
Arjun - Hey

925
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,219
Hey Arjun, please save me

926
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:40,469
Arjun - Close the door

927
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:43,219
Hey please, I have nothing to do
Move

928
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:46,053
Beat him up!

929
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:01,094
Bring that fellow

930
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:03,178
Sir, please Sir

931
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:04,969
Lock it
I am sorry Sir

932
01:08:09,594 --> 01:08:11,011
Sir, please Sir

933
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:12,511
Bring him in

934
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,469
I told you to deliver the goods quickly, didn't I?

935
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:27,386
Shabana, get inside now

936
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:40,093
Pa, we kidnapped that lawyer.
He wanted to trick us and escape

937
01:08:40,094 --> 01:08:43,428
I felt like killing him right there,
But someone came to save him

938
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:47,386
That's why we kidnapped and brought him here.
Idiot, you did not kidnap him,

939
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:52,011
instead he tricked you into this kidnap
You should have brought that guy instead

940
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:55,969
What he needs is evidence,
He will surely come looking for it

941
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:04,261
Before he reaches, Kill this fellow

942
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:08,011
Make sure he does not get any evidence. Burn everything

943
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:11,678
Hey, tie his hands and legs

944
01:09:12,219 --> 01:09:14,385
Throw in all the files and burn him along with them

945
01:09:14,386 --> 01:09:16,719
Let him and the evidence turn to ashes

946
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:23,553
Let's have a drink? What?
A Drink dude

947
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,760
Police raids are on at various places
across the state, in connection with this scam

948
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:38,927
Crime branch officials have sealed all branches of Dot Consultancy

949
01:12:38,928 --> 01:12:42,053
They are going to investigate the case

950
01:12:42,094 --> 01:12:46,386
Officials have begun investigation into those involved in this scam

951
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:51,469
All students with original certificates
fear they may be pulled into this scam

952
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:55,719
It is now confirmed that Dot Consultancy is
involved in the Education loan scam

953
01:12:55,803 --> 01:12:58,761
Four branches of Dot Consultancy have been sealed

954
01:12:58,844 --> 01:13:05,053
Banks have decided to temporarily keep education
loans in abeyance because of this scam

955
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:09,719
What is the update on the scam, Sir?
Has the body found at Dot Consultancy been identified yet?

956
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:13,428
Our investigation reveals the deceased's name is Ram alias MK

957
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:18,053
He migrated from Burma to India.
We do not have any further information at this time

958
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:20,053
Sir, do you have a picture of the man found dead?

959
01:13:20,844 --> 01:13:21,803
Here is his picture

960
01:13:24,803 --> 01:13:26,969
Hey, That photograph is
of somebody else!

961
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:27,636
What?

962
01:13:28,178 --> 01:13:31,636
This man was not even present there, at that time.
They have meticulously planned the dead body swap.

963
01:13:34,761 --> 01:13:37,261
Who is this man?
What happened to the actual dead body?

964
01:13:48,678 --> 01:13:51,261
Have you identified who the 52 fake certificates belong to?

965
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:59,094
All 52 certificates alleged by TV channels,
to be fake have been proven to be original in our verification

966
01:14:00,594 --> 01:14:01,511
Here is the evidence

967
01:14:03,761 --> 01:14:07,386
We suspect someone is intentionally
feeding fake news to media

968
01:14:07,469 --> 01:14:13,803
If any news channel engages in such fake news
broadcasts again, we will take legal action

969
01:14:14,053 --> 01:14:14,594
Thank you

970
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:16,927
Sir, sir...
Please Sir

971
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:18,760
Stop Sir,
We need an answer

972
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:19,843
Please sir, tell us

973
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:22,844
Arjun, how did all those fake
certificates turn original suddenly?

974
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:24,678
Something is not right

975
01:14:25,136 --> 01:14:27,760
I can vouch a genuine background verification was conducted

976
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,678
They did call up every college to check authenticity.
All certificates are original

977
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:31,303
What?

978
01:14:32,386 --> 01:14:34,636
I feel we are barking up the wrong tree

979
01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:39,928
If that was so,
why did they kidnap Balaji?

980
01:14:40,011 --> 01:14:41,136
And the evidence?
Why did they burn all the evidence?

981
01:14:41,803 --> 01:14:42,928
Why did they change the dead body?

982
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:50,844
There is a huge network behind this

983
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,803
And there will always be ONE mastermind for every network

984
01:14:56,761 --> 01:14:59,053
The man killed in Dot Consultancy
must be some one important for them

985
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:00,844
That must be the reason they switched the bodies

986
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:09,719
He will definitely come looking for us

987
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:16,219
No matter who he is or where he is,
I will show him hell

988
01:15:37,261 --> 01:15:42,803
After pulling off a Rupees 9000 Crore scam,
Vijay Mallya too left India peacefully

989
01:15:44,844 --> 01:15:47,303
What is your scam compared to him?

990
01:15:48,094 --> 01:15:51,678
And yet, how hard are you trying, weaving stories of murders,
changing dead bodies and so on? What are all these scripts for?

991
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:54,636
Leave it Sir, you will get angry If I say something

992
01:15:57,594 --> 01:15:59,678
I will get angry even if you do not say anything

993
01:16:00,636 --> 01:16:02,636
There is no logic in what you are saying

994
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:06,177
You say that your certificate was leaked from Dot Consultancy

995
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:15,928
All the other 52 certificates were also found at the same Consultancy
If your certificate is original, then those 52 certificates can be original too, right?

996
01:16:32,636 --> 01:16:33,344
Who is there?

997
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:38,136
I am asking who is there?

998
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,219
Why don't you speak?

999
01:17:19,303 --> 01:17:20,969
Did you find any evidence?

1000
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:26,552
Police checked everything and
they found no evidence of who had broken in

1001
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:31,094
No evidence even in the forensic report.
It is very clean

1002
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:42,844
There should definitely be finger prints of our men, at least.
If even those are missing in the report, he must have erased it all

1003
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:51,594
No matter how smart someone is, he will certainly
commit a mistake. Search this entire place

1004
01:18:56,636 --> 01:18:58,303
Motion capture camera

1005
01:18:58,844 --> 01:19:02,594
180 degree motion sensor and 3 frames per second

1006
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:07,928
Whoever moves in front of this camera,
it automatically clicks a picture

1007
01:19:09,136 --> 01:19:18,678
He put this camera here to find out who we are.
Now this same camera will lead us to him

1008
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,344
Arjun! Arjun

1009
01:21:08,803 --> 01:21:09,511
Arjun!

1010
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:10,803
What happened?

1011
01:21:11,469 --> 01:21:12,344
What happened, brother?

1012
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:13,678
Arjun!

1013
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:14,678
Arjun!

1014
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:15,428
Son Arjun

1015
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:16,428
careful

1016
01:21:16,928 --> 01:21:17,344
careful

1017
01:21:20,928 --> 01:21:21,928
Arjun, My son

1018
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:24,094
Arjun, My son

1019
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:26,094
What happened to you?

1020
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:26,928
Arjun!

1021
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,094
Arjun!

1022
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:54,969
Police came exactly at 4:21pm

1023
01:21:55,386 --> 01:21:57,178
How did the Police get to know?

1024
01:21:57,386 --> 01:22:02,886
The control room got a call from an unknown number
Police acted on that tip off.

1025
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:06,594
He escaped in a Police jeep,
he may be a Cop, right?

1026
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:19,803
If he was a cop he would either work for money or fame. If he wanted fame,
he would have bragged about it on TV, if he wanted money, he would've come to us.

1027
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:22,802
He is not a cop.

1028
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:29,303
If he is not Police, how come without an FIR, news about fake certificates
was telecast in all the channels, at the same time, in the same manner?

1029
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,886
Same time?

1030
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:35,386
Yes, all channels telecast the news at the same time.
But that is common, right?

1031
01:22:36,553 --> 01:22:41,344
Name Ramakrishna - Age 32
Name Sukumar, age 33 - Sagar, age 27

1032
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:46,386
It is common to be telecast on the same day,
but not common if it comes at the same time

1033
01:22:47,636 --> 01:22:55,636
He should either be wielding influence in the media or
should be someone working in the media. Maybe he is a reporter!

1034
01:22:57,011 --> 01:23:01,178
It was telecast on 13 channels in total,
how will we know which channel does he report for?

1035
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:09,261
Collect details of all the reporters who telecast
this fake news. I will find out who he is

1036
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:16,178
Arjun!

1037
01:23:30,053 --> 01:23:31,136
Dear husband

1038
01:23:38,303 --> 01:23:39,428
How are you feeling?

1039
01:23:41,344 --> 01:23:44,303
What are you doing son?
Mom, I need to go

1040
01:23:44,594 --> 01:23:46,053
Where do you have to go, son?

1041
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:49,886
You may be fearless,
but you should think of your parents too, right?

1042
01:23:50,344 --> 01:23:52,678
Arjun, it is not safe for you to go out at this time.

1043
01:23:53,053 --> 01:23:55,510
Kavya, they can say something like that because they do not know.
But how can you say that too?

1044
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:56,469
What is there to understand?

1045
01:23:57,303 --> 01:23:58,969
What if that bullet had not missed its mark?

1046
01:24:00,053 --> 01:24:01,344
Can you imagine what could have happened?

1047
01:24:01,928 --> 01:24:03,844
I always told you that not to take up this reporter's job

1048
01:24:04,386 --> 01:24:10,678
This society does not need the good you do, son.
Let us leave the good and bad to the public, Let us just tell them the truth

1049
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:14,428
Truth! Huh, do you know what the truth is?

1050
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:21,761
In the last 10 years, 73 reporters like you were killed
in this country, trying to expose some scam or the other.

1051
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:27,844
Not even one case has been solved. No body has been punished,
No body remembers even the names of those journalists

1052
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:29,678
This is THE truth here

1053
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:32,511
That is why we fear for your safety, son

1054
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:35,219
I understand your pain father

1055
01:24:36,636 --> 01:24:37,386
but I need to go

1056
01:24:37,761 --> 01:24:41,760
You all have gone mad behind TRPs.
Trying to sell the news, you are selling away your souls.

1057
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:44,136
What you are doing is not journalism but prostitution.

1058
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:18,303
After my release on bail,
I started collecting all the news on fake certificates.

1059
01:25:18,803 --> 01:25:22,344
Separately each of these instances
may look like just another news item.

1060
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:26,303
I did not understand till I collated
all the news articles and I found that this is a huge scam

1061
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:34,303
Look here.
Almost 15 Lakh students are passing out every year in our Telugu states

1062
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:37,886
Just 6 Lakh of those students are getting jobs

1063
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:43,553
The other 9 Lakh students are ending up on streets,
jobless

1064
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:49,094
The reason for all this is each of these
fake certificate guys in this room

1065
01:25:59,053 --> 01:25:59,553
Father,

1066
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,053
you are feeling bad about the 73 reporters who died

1067
01:26:07,303 --> 01:26:11,011
But do you know how many people died
because of just this one fake engineer?

1068
01:26:25,261 --> 01:26:27,385
Stop stop stop,
Yes, I stopped

1069
01:26:27,386 --> 01:26:30,052
Brother Vamsi
Yes dear?

1070
01:26:30,053 --> 01:26:32,427
Is the new school building inaugurated yet?

1071
01:26:32,428 --> 01:26:34,968
Not yet dear, we are all waiting for MLA sir

1072
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:35,802
Is it?
Yes Sir

1073
01:26:35,803 --> 01:26:36,843
Then
who is he?

1074
01:26:36,844 --> 01:26:39,386
He is the Engineer who constructed this school
Is it?

1075
01:26:39,969 --> 01:26:43,178
Sir, hello Sir
Ok

1076
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:49,094
That is fine dear,
why did your teacher call me?

1077
01:26:49,594 --> 01:26:52,635
Nothing Dad,
she has a small doubt

1078
01:26:52,636 --> 01:26:54,093
What is the doubt?

1079
01:26:54,094 --> 01:26:58,094
To know whether
you are the one who signed my progress report or not

1080
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:01,593
Yes, I did not sign it right?
I signed it.

1081
01:27:01,594 --> 01:27:03,510
Why did you sign dear?
Did you get less marks?

1082
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:06,468
No Dad, I always come first in my class

1083
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:07,843
Then, why did you sign on my behalf dear?

1084
01:27:07,844 --> 01:27:13,803
All my friends are making fun of me looking
at your thumb impressions on my progress card, Dad

1085
01:27:16,178 --> 01:27:17,803
Yes, MLA sir is here

1086
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,178
Dad, you come too
Careful dear

1087
01:27:41,844 --> 01:27:42,428
Where are you, man?

1088
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:46,552
Sir, I have come to drop my daughter at the school.
I will be there in half an hour Sir

1089
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:47,511
Workers are waiting, come fast

1090
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:19,718
Not just here, but we will construct such high quality
schools in all districts. Hey, what?

1091
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:21,594
Our Government's main intention is that

1092
01:28:22,553 --> 01:28:23,636
Here, see Sir

1093
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:31,718
Oh .. This is just an air crack and
is very common in any new building

1094
01:28:31,719 --> 01:28:34,053
Thank God, I was worried Sir
Don't worry

1095
01:28:40,053 --> 01:28:41,386
These kids are our future...

1096
01:28:46,094 --> 01:28:47,094
I will meet you later

1097
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:53,135
Sir, they are small kids.
Better we alert them right away and send them out Sir

1098
01:28:53,136 --> 01:28:56,178
They will thrash us if we tell them now
Let us come in the evening and get it repaired

1099
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:01,261
Hey...

1100
01:29:01,511 --> 01:29:02,219
Hey...

1101
01:29:16,428 --> 01:29:19,886
Children,
go out. Fast, fast. Move fast kids

1102
01:29:21,386 --> 01:29:22,053
Divya

1103
01:29:23,386 --> 01:29:25,093
Come on. Go!

1104
01:29:25,094 --> 01:29:31,635
Oh no! Come out fast,
Ramu Come fast, come out

1105
01:29:31,636 --> 01:29:32,928
Divya

1106
01:29:33,303 --> 01:29:34,136
Daddy

1107
01:29:34,636 --> 01:29:35,303
Divya

1108
01:29:36,219 --> 01:29:37,636
Divya

1109
01:29:39,011 --> 01:29:40,928
Chinnu, move

1110
01:29:45,636 --> 01:29:46,094
Get up

1111
01:29:47,344 --> 01:29:48,011
Daddy!

1112
01:29:48,428 --> 01:29:49,553
Divya

1113
01:30:20,178 --> 01:30:22,636
I always come first in my class

1114
01:30:22,928 --> 01:30:28,886
All my friends are making fun of me looking
at your thumb impressions on my progress card, Dad

1115
01:30:31,553 --> 01:30:32,594
Baby Divya

1116
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:33,594
Divya

1117
01:30:35,844 --> 01:30:36,469
Divya

1118
01:30:42,928 --> 01:30:46,219
God!

1119
01:31:01,094 --> 01:31:07,428
That day along with Divya, 43 other children
got crushed and died under the rubble, unable to breathe, Dad

1120
01:31:08,094 --> 01:31:09,094
What was their mistake?

1121
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:24,218
Not just fake Engineers, Doctors, College Professors, Railway Engineers,
Bank managers, Pilots, Software Engineers, Lawyers, Builders, Police Officers...

1122
01:31:24,219 --> 01:31:31,511
There are fake certificate employees in every department
When so many lives were snuffed out because of just this one fake Engineer,

1123
01:31:33,136 --> 01:31:35,178
how many must have died because of all these people here?

1124
01:31:36,678 --> 01:31:39,969
Then isn't the prostitution you mentioned better than all this, Dad?

1125
01:31:41,678 --> 01:31:48,386
It is terrible that the Engineer was arrested
but walked free in just two weeks

1126
01:31:53,011 --> 01:31:54,178
Arjun

1127
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:57,136
I was angry because of my love for you

1128
01:31:58,969 --> 01:32:05,303
But now, after listening to what you said,
I am angrier at these people.

1129
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:09,553
If an individual makes a mistake, only he may be ashamed

1130
01:32:10,261 --> 01:32:14,927
But when such large number of people
commit a mistake, the whole society stands ashamed

1131
01:32:14,928 --> 01:32:23,636
In my service, I have only seen reporters
who toe the boss's line, but for the first time, I see a committed reporter in you.

1132
01:32:27,428 --> 01:32:29,094
I feel very proud, son

1133
01:32:30,636 --> 01:32:35,678
Do not leave any of these criminals.
Whatever happens, I will stand by you.

1134
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:09,553
Yes, I was the one who dealt with that school collapse case

1135
01:33:09,594 --> 01:33:13,177
In any case, usually, we get some small evidence
at least. But, we didn't get any clue in this case

1136
01:33:13,178 --> 01:33:16,344
Even that Guru Murthy's
certificate passed the background verification

1137
01:33:16,553 --> 01:33:17,344
What's this Sir?

1138
01:33:18,094 --> 01:33:21,344
Can't we do anything when so many
innocent kids have been killed?

1139
01:33:22,553 --> 01:33:25,219
Law doesn't care for emotion my dear,
It cares only for evidence

1140
01:33:25,303 --> 01:33:27,803
Get some evidence
and I'll ensure justice.

1141
01:33:30,261 --> 01:33:32,344
There are only two things for us to do now

1142
01:33:32,678 --> 01:33:37,177
One is to get hold of Guru Murthy or
to prove his certificate is fake

1143
01:33:37,178 --> 01:33:40,177
When there are so many 'fake' idiots,
why are we only targeting Guru Murthy?

1144
01:33:40,178 --> 01:33:43,511
Because Guru Murthy's certificate
is one of the 52 certificates we found at Dot Consultancy

1145
01:33:44,678 --> 01:33:45,719
But where will we find him?

1146
01:33:47,428 --> 01:33:50,719
A guy who gets away with a crime shall
certainly commit the same crime again

1147
01:33:51,261 --> 01:33:54,553
Hey, Uncle and you go and find out
if there are any new constructions underway, in his name

1148
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:57,094
We'll find out how is he passing off his fake
documents as original

1149
01:34:02,344 --> 01:34:03,927
Metro rail project!

1150
01:34:03,928 --> 01:34:08,260
Its raining revenues for Metro rails due to
the ongoing RTC strike.

1151
01:34:08,261 --> 01:34:10,219
Trains are all looking overcrowded with passengers.

1152
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:18,218
Who gave the news of fake certificates,
telecasted on November 27th?

1153
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:18,719
Tell me

1154
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,343
Bang Bang

1155
01:34:20,344 --> 01:34:22,803
NTv reporter received the news from ABN channel's reporter.

1156
01:34:24,428 --> 01:34:30,261
I had to tell your name in connection with the fake
certificate news telecast on November 27th. Be careful

1157
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:31,053
Hello Fatima

1158
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:33,010
Sakshi channel's reporter Swetha gave me the news

1159
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:36,261
♫ Don't get caught lest you suffer,
Bang Bang ♫

1160
01:34:36,844 --> 01:34:40,011
♫ Will get you dragged on a leash should you run,
Bang Bang ♫

1161
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,969
♫ If I get my hands on you, you will be history
Bang Bang ♫

1162
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:45,718
♫ You will be beaten black &amp; blue
Bang Bang ♫

1163
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:50,177
Sir, where is Mr. Guru Murthy?
No idea when he comes or where he is

1164
01:34:50,178 --> 01:34:51,843
Wait right there till he comes

1165
01:34:51,844 --> 01:34:54,969
This building is also his construction so I was too
scared to stand under it. I'd rather stand outside.

1166
01:35:00,344 --> 01:35:02,968
♫ Whichever remote corner you may be hiding in
I shall lay a trap to uncover you ♫

1167
01:35:02,969 --> 01:35:11,969
As per Government rules, every Degree certificate should be
29.7 centimeters in length and 21.5 centimeters in width

1168
01:35:12,053 --> 01:35:19,927
It should definitely be printed on Tivec quality paper
Paper thickness should be 0.156 mm

1169
01:35:19,928 --> 01:35:23,552
Every letter should be printed only with German ink

1170
01:35:23,553 --> 01:35:30,428
The secret symbol in this certificate is visible
to our eyes only when seen under UV light

1171
01:35:30,553 --> 01:35:34,469
Physically, everything in this certificate is perfect

1172
01:35:34,636 --> 01:35:40,344
Wow, 362434. It's perfect

1173
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:45,761
Sir, has Engineer Sir Come?
- No, he hasn't

1174
01:35:57,761 --> 01:36:00,343
Every certificate will have a unique number

1175
01:36:00,344 --> 01:36:01,969
That won't repeat in another certificate

1176
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:04,053
Why wouldn't they verify the photo on the certifcate, Sir?

1177
01:36:04,136 --> 01:36:07,678
He must have been 20 when this photo was clicked.
By now, he'd be 45 years old

1178
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,386
He also won't recognise himself unless we tell him..

1179
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:11,594
Correct Sir,

1180
01:36:11,844 --> 01:36:14,094
My photo on Aadhar card looks like Prabhas!
What?

1181
01:36:14,428 --> 01:36:15,386
Almost!

1182
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:21,511
See, the certificate you gave
matched in our University database

1183
01:36:22,094 --> 01:36:23,844
This certificate belongs to Mr. Guru Murthy

1184
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:26,136
This is definitely an original certificate

1185
01:36:27,219 --> 01:36:28,844
Sir, has he come?
No, man

1186
01:36:32,344 --> 01:36:34,844
I'll tell
it's the TV 9 reporter

1187
01:36:37,386 --> 01:36:41,344
Tyvek Paper, Germen ink, one can somehow
source all these from black market,

1188
01:36:41,553 --> 01:36:46,178
But how can a fake certificate made by a random
guy get validated in back ground verification.

1189
01:36:46,553 --> 01:36:51,468
Damn, What skill! Made a perfect match like
Keerthy suresh to Savitiri!!

1190
01:36:51,469 --> 01:36:54,344
This looks more than original

1191
01:36:56,094 --> 01:36:57,719
Canot find the one I am looking for.

1192
01:36:58,594 --> 01:37:00,094
Don't even know,
If he is the one I should be looking for

1193
01:37:01,094 --> 01:37:02,969
Only one person is the the solution to all this

1194
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:05,386
Hey, he hasn't yet come and
I will tell you when he's here

1195
01:37:06,803 --> 01:37:08,843
It's almost done Sir
Hey

1196
01:37:08,844 --> 01:37:11,968
♫ You are the puzzle I shall never get tired of cracking ♫

1197
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:12,802
Sorry

1198
01:37:12,803 --> 01:37:16,719
♫ You shall be my trophy ♫

1199
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:22,678
Cheers - Yeah

1200
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:29,761
Who are you?

1201
01:37:29,762 --> 01:37:30,928
Hey, go

1202
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:31,969
Hey, who let you inside?

1203
01:37:32,428 --> 01:37:33,594
Do you know who I am?

1204
01:37:36,803 --> 01:37:37,761
Why are you hitting me?

1205
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:40,053
Do you know who I am?

1206
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:43,511
It hurts! Give a reason and then hit

1207
01:37:45,636 --> 01:37:47,261
Who gave you the fake Engineering certificate?

1208
01:37:47,719 --> 01:37:49,928
What fake, it is an original certificate

1209
01:37:50,011 --> 01:37:51,927
Guru Murthy, B Tech and 82%

1210
01:37:51,928 --> 01:37:53,386
Is it?
Yes

1211
01:37:53,553 --> 01:37:54,719
Spell Engineering

1212
01:37:55,344 --> 01:38:03,344
Engineering spelling... E N J...

1213
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:08,761
Y... Buddy, it seems like he didn't even clear Class 1.

1214
01:38:10,344 --> 01:38:14,802
You don't even know how to spell Engineering and you
construct buildings? Idiots! All my certificates are original.

1215
01:38:14,803 --> 01:38:15,636
Are they original?

1216
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:19,594
No! No! Fake only,
fake for sure

1217
01:38:19,678 --> 01:38:21,136
Listen to me carefully

1218
01:38:21,344 --> 01:38:23,428
I need the name and address
of the guy who gave you the certificate

1219
01:38:24,553 --> 01:38:27,803
No! Abdullah,
SAS Computer center, Ameerpet

1220
01:38:33,636 --> 01:38:35,553
Abdul, fake certificates

1221
01:38:36,803 --> 01:38:38,553
Tell him we're coming for a certificate

1222
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:42,969
Guru bro, after a long time.
How are you?

1223
01:38:43,053 --> 01:38:46,386
I'm fine. My person is coming,
give him the certificate he needs

1224
01:38:46,678 --> 01:38:49,803
I can't hear anything bro,
seems like bad signal?

1225
01:38:49,844 --> 01:38:51,136
Why don't you come out and talk?

1226
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,303
I can not come any more out than this

1227
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:57,594
Cool, cool bro! I'll give for sure.

1228
01:38:57,719 --> 01:38:59,094
Who is he, by the way?

1229
01:38:59,803 --> 01:39:00,761
My brother-in-law!

1230
01:39:01,761 --> 01:39:06,468
I have done everything you asked. So,
please leave me now. Please

1231
01:39:06,469 --> 01:39:07,969
These are the problems you get
If you don't study

1232
01:39:08,469 --> 01:39:11,344
In such times you should say 'save me',
not 'leave me'. No!

1233
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:42,427
♫ I am coming for you
will catch you no matter what, will not leave you. ♫

1234
01:39:42,428 --> 01:39:45,386
♫ Can you stand up to me if you meet?
Will not be scared of you. ♫

1235
01:39:57,678 --> 01:39:58,886
Hey, who do you want?

1236
01:39:59,969 --> 01:40:00,843
I came to meet Abdul

1237
01:40:00,844 --> 01:40:02,969
♫ Can you stand up to me if you meet?
Will not be scared of you. ♫

1238
01:40:03,053 --> 01:40:07,803
♫ Can you stand up to me if you meet?
Will not be scared of you. ♫

1239
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:09,719
Mr.Guru Murthy sent me

1240
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:12,344
Which certificate do you need?
BTech Computer Science

1241
01:40:12,428 --> 01:40:14,636
It costs Two Lakh rupees
Ok

1242
01:40:18,011 --> 01:40:19,178
Come after two days

1243
01:40:19,428 --> 01:40:23,553
Two days! That means they're definitely not printing the
certificates here. They're printing them elsewhere

1244
01:40:24,219 --> 01:40:25,386
I need it urgently, Sir

1245
01:40:27,844 --> 01:40:29,553
What's the urgency?

1246
01:40:29,803 --> 01:40:31,928
I'm leaving to Dubai tomorrow early in the morning
Dubai?!

1247
01:40:33,178 --> 01:40:34,261
Show me the flight ticket

1248
01:40:35,303 --> 01:40:37,469
Flight ticket... is in the mail

1249
01:40:38,386 --> 01:40:39,469
He has no brains at all

1250
01:40:39,594 --> 01:40:42,469
How will a flight ticket come into the mail
just like that? It's unnecessary risk

1251
01:40:42,553 --> 01:40:44,303
I would have dealt in some other manner,
you know?

1252
01:40:45,511 --> 01:40:47,218
Balaji, do you have a Credit card?

1253
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:48,344
Do I have a Credit card?

1254
01:40:49,053 --> 01:40:52,386
Of course I do. Platinum Credit Card,
Only for VIP customers, you know?

1255
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:54,219
Arjun, manage for two minutes

1256
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:55,386
Password Sir

1257
01:40:57,636 --> 01:40:58,761
Anyway, why do you need the card?

1258
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,219
So I can book a ticket to Dubai and
immediately email it to Arjun

1259
01:41:07,053 --> 01:41:07,636
What happened?

1260
01:41:08,469 --> 01:41:09,386
I forgot the password Sir

1261
01:41:11,386 --> 01:41:12,136
One minute Sir

1262
01:41:15,219 --> 01:41:15,928
Go, Go

1263
01:41:21,053 --> 01:41:23,928
Balaji, you received an OTP on your phone. Tell the OTP.

1264
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:26,469
54... Huh!

1265
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:30,553
Tell the password, otherwise,
you can't leave from here

1266
01:41:33,469 --> 01:41:40,761
0000

1267
01:41:44,303 --> 01:41:47,261
Did you forget THIS?
My memory is a bit weak Sir

1268
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:52,761
Ok!

1269
01:41:55,678 --> 01:41:59,386
Oh no, 75000?

1270
01:41:59,969 --> 01:42:02,678
Did you book a ticket for yourself too?
Business class

1271
01:42:03,844 --> 01:42:05,719
Does he need business class now?

1272
01:42:05,803 --> 01:42:08,178
Cost will go up if it is needed immediately

1273
01:42:08,844 --> 01:42:09,928
I'll pay once my certificate is given

1274
01:42:11,636 --> 01:42:14,678
Srinu, I have reached safely. You go carefully

1275
01:42:23,386 --> 01:42:32,678
♫ I'm searching and I will catch you ♫

1276
01:42:45,094 --> 01:42:49,219
We shouldn't bring outsiders here,
but since you said it's urgent

1277
01:42:49,719 --> 01:42:52,428
I'm not doing it for money,
but only to help you

1278
01:42:57,178 --> 01:43:00,344
Such a big setup! Is this a mansion or the Bigg Boss house?

1279
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,761
Hey, open the gate
Hello brother

1280
01:43:18,219 --> 01:43:19,386
Sir, please stop

1281
01:43:19,469 --> 01:43:21,803
CEO is on leave and I'm the CEO for today

1282
01:43:22,303 --> 01:43:23,844
Sir, I request you Sir

1283
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:32,386
Catch!

1284
01:43:32,553 --> 01:43:35,636
You're entering without permission,
You think this is a TV studio or a tea stall?

1285
01:43:38,094 --> 01:43:40,011
What do you need?
I need information

1286
01:43:40,094 --> 01:43:44,053
If you need information, you should be calling JUST DIAL,
You get all details from a Sub to a Pub.

1287
01:43:44,136 --> 01:43:45,469
You...
Stop

1288
01:43:46,844 --> 01:43:48,136
Nice Chemistry, man

1289
01:43:48,344 --> 01:43:52,219
I WANT INFORMATION

1290
01:43:53,053 --> 01:43:55,594
I DON'T GIVE YOU.

1291
01:43:58,844 --> 01:44:00,969
If you stay here for one more minute,
I'll shoot you

1292
01:44:01,511 --> 01:44:02,594
Oh no!

1293
01:44:07,136 --> 01:44:07,719
Sir,

1294
01:44:08,178 --> 01:44:10,011
I didn't mean shooting with a gun

1295
01:44:11,303 --> 01:44:16,053
But only with this mobile camera.
I was just kidding! Just for fun

1296
01:44:19,094 --> 01:44:20,928
Hello Dina bro

1297
01:44:22,136 --> 01:44:23,844
What?
His name is Arjun

1298
01:44:23,886 --> 01:44:25,511
I am checked his flight ticket..

1299
01:44:25,636 --> 01:44:28,761
He needs to leave for Dubai tomorrow morning
for a job. Very urgent, bro

1300
01:44:30,053 --> 01:44:33,594
Hey, I said not to bring any new people here, right?
Why did you bring him?

1301
01:44:33,678 --> 01:44:36,469
He is not a stranger.
He is Guru Murthy's brother-in-law.

1302
01:44:37,636 --> 01:44:40,136
If Sarkar gets to know, he'll slaughter you

1303
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:42,469
Hey Suki, come here

1304
01:44:43,428 --> 01:44:49,386
I'll go down and get a certificate print
Ok

1305
01:44:50,636 --> 01:44:54,844
Keep an eye on him
Ok

1306
01:44:58,469 --> 01:45:01,928
Drop all your phones here!

1307
01:45:02,011 --> 01:45:03,928
You also, keep your phone here and step back.

1308
01:45:06,386 --> 01:45:08,511
I'll ask you three questions

1309
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:12,136
I'll let you go, if you answer even one

1310
01:45:12,219 --> 01:45:15,386
Will you let me go if I answer, Sir?
Deal ok Sir! Please ask

1311
01:45:15,844 --> 01:45:19,178
Who stole certificates from Dot consultancy?

1312
01:45:26,636 --> 01:45:27,553
Pass!!

1313
01:45:28,386 --> 01:45:30,553
This question is a pass... Oh no!

1314
01:45:32,136 --> 01:45:36,011
Who's the reporter who gave the 'fake' news
that was telecast on November 27?

1315
01:45:41,428 --> 01:45:44,178
Ah... This question also I choose to pass Sir!

1316
01:45:45,928 --> 01:45:48,094
Who killed my son?

1317
01:45:48,303 --> 01:45:52,011
Is your son dead Sir?
Oh.. So sad... RIP!

1318
01:45:54,094 --> 01:45:56,553
Hey, WHO KILLED MY SON?

1319
01:46:10,511 --> 01:46:11,678
It's very secure here

1320
01:46:12,886 --> 01:46:13,969
That means they are hiding something here

1321
01:46:14,136 --> 01:46:15,719
Hey, pass me a cigarette

1322
01:46:19,844 --> 01:46:20,511
Who is that?

1323
01:46:53,928 --> 01:46:59,385
Oh no, so many SERVERS! Is he just selling
certificates or running a software company?

1324
01:46:59,386 --> 01:47:02,303
So many servers means,
they may be maintaining a BIG database

1325
01:47:02,886 --> 01:47:06,803
Let's see what all skeletons
will tumble out of this cupboard?

1326
01:47:40,636 --> 01:47:42,886
Oh my god, so many certificates?

1327
01:47:43,136 --> 01:47:45,511
They're storing every certificate they sell

1328
01:47:45,844 --> 01:47:49,136
Why are there so many certificates for the same name?
What do you understand by this?

1329
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:54,635
52 certificates said to be fake are proven to be
original in our department's verification

1330
01:47:54,636 --> 01:47:56,052
This certificate of Mr Guru Murthy is indeed original

1331
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:57,428
How did the fake certificate turn original?

1332
01:48:07,636 --> 01:48:08,636
If my guess is correct,

1333
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:13,678
they're collecting original certificates
from students and selling the fake certificates by matching the names

1334
01:48:14,136 --> 01:48:15,928
Matching?
Don't you understand?

1335
01:48:16,344 --> 01:48:18,553
What's your full name?
Addala Balaji

1336
01:48:18,969 --> 01:48:25,803
Ok! There are 104 Universities in total in the States of Andhra
and Telangana put together. There are about 3400 Colleges under them.

1337
01:48:25,928 --> 01:48:29,261
About 15 Lakh students are passing out
every year from these colleges

1338
01:48:29,678 --> 01:48:35,053
There definitely will be a guy named
Addala Balaji among these 15 Lakh students.

1339
01:48:35,344 --> 01:48:38,636
Yes buddy, there are a few 'Addala Balajis'
on Facebook too. I hate them

1340
01:48:38,761 --> 01:48:39,303
Yes!

1341
01:48:39,553 --> 01:48:42,969
If I match his name to your certificate,
he will become a lawyer too.

1342
01:48:43,594 --> 01:48:44,428
Oh yes!

1343
01:48:45,428 --> 01:48:51,136
See those two certificates, same name,
same serial number, but different photos

1344
01:48:51,469 --> 01:48:54,219
That means they are Cloning the certificates

1345
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,761
Even if they call the University / College,
for background verification, all details will match

1346
01:49:00,761 --> 01:49:02,511
Such a PERFECT CRIME!

1347
01:49:02,761 --> 01:49:05,844
Arjun, I have a doubt,
What if the names don't match?

1348
01:49:06,011 --> 01:49:08,052
If the names do not match,
it is not possible

1349
01:49:08,053 --> 01:49:11,553
What's this name, Arjun Lenin Suravaram?
It sounds rare

1350
01:49:11,969 --> 01:49:14,594
No one would have such a name,
it won't match

1351
01:49:15,469 --> 01:49:17,928
He is paying 3 Lakhs,
let's try once

1352
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:19,511
Ok, give the details

1353
01:49:22,844 --> 01:49:29,760
But for them to do all this, they need
certificate of every student passing out every year

1354
01:49:29,761 --> 01:49:32,594
How can they get hold of Lakhs of certificates every year?

1355
01:49:34,428 --> 01:49:35,178
Consultancy?

1356
01:49:36,678 --> 01:49:37,553
That's closed, right?

1357
01:49:37,803 --> 01:49:39,553
Not just Dot Consultancy, Balaji,

1358
01:49:39,761 --> 01:49:40,219
look here

1359
01:49:41,469 --> 01:49:45,178
They are running numerous consultancies
in different names in every district

1360
01:49:45,594 --> 01:49:47,719
So, that's how they're getting original certificates from students

1361
01:49:48,678 --> 01:49:51,594
If we bust this, this will be a bigger scam than VYAPAM!

1362
01:49:52,969 --> 01:49:58,094
He's a lucky person. There is a match for such a
rare name too. That too with 81% marks from JNTU

1363
01:49:58,219 --> 01:50:02,386
Yes, why wouldn't it match? After all we are in this business
for the last 17 years. Any name will match

1364
01:50:03,844 --> 01:50:04,469
Hey, what happened?

1365
01:50:04,969 --> 01:50:08,969
Name and surname matched! That's fine,
but how can the date of birth also match?

1366
01:50:09,094 --> 01:50:09,594
Is it?

1367
01:50:11,469 --> 01:50:12,511
Is his photo there?

1368
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:16,094
Let's check the original certificate

1369
01:50:19,803 --> 01:50:24,511
Kavya, we can prove the scam ONLY when we have
all this data with us. I'll transfer the data to you

1370
01:50:24,803 --> 01:50:26,011
Connect to the system in the OB van

1371
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:37,136
Damn! Both are the same

1372
01:50:39,011 --> 01:50:43,344
I swear I know nothing! I got greedy,
please forgive me brother

1373
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:46,636
I really don't know any details Sir, please leave me

1374
01:50:46,886 --> 01:50:52,136
I have no more patience.
All of you don't choose to die for just one guy

1375
01:50:52,428 --> 01:50:55,761
We are all media people.
If something happens to us, You can't escape

1376
01:51:01,053 --> 01:51:04,011
You say. Your time is up!

1377
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:14,386
Pa, a guy has come for a certificate. But he came to take
his original certificate pretending to ask for a fake certificate!

1378
01:51:14,594 --> 01:51:15,219
What's his name?

1379
01:51:15,344 --> 01:51:16,719
Arjun Lenin Suravaram

1380
01:51:16,969 --> 01:51:18,928
Arjun Lenin Suravaram

1381
01:51:20,094 --> 01:51:22,261
I think, I have heard this name before

1382
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:25,719
Check, if his name is there on our education loans list

1383
01:51:26,094 --> 01:51:28,177
send me his photo immediately

1384
01:51:28,178 --> 01:51:28,803
Ok Pa

1385
01:51:29,803 --> 01:51:33,594
Check if the name Arjun Lenin Suravaram
is on the channel's staff list

1386
01:51:46,469 --> 01:51:48,927
His name matched in the previous education loan list.

1387
01:51:48,928 --> 01:51:50,053
The name matches, Sir

1388
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,928
He's just a bloody kid!

1389
01:51:59,428 --> 01:52:02,678
He should not escape from our mansion
Ok Pa

1390
01:52:05,553 --> 01:52:07,136
Hey, all of you come

1391
01:52:09,636 --> 01:52:12,261
Arjun,
they know where you are!

1392
01:52:13,969 --> 01:52:15,719
They barged into our channel and attacked us

1393
01:52:24,969 --> 01:52:25,678
Arjun

1394
01:52:35,803 --> 01:52:37,968
100% downloaded, you hurry out now

1395
01:52:37,969 --> 01:52:40,428
No matter what, this evidence must reach the public

1396
01:52:42,344 --> 01:52:45,844
Kavya, it's dangerous to go to the
channel now. Go to Subba Rao uncle

1397
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:47,428
And you?

1398
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:48,886
I can't come out right now

1399
01:52:49,303 --> 01:52:51,177
No, I cannot leave you behind like this..

1400
01:52:51,178 --> 01:52:52,261
Kavya, just GO

1401
01:53:31,386 --> 01:53:32,094
Stop it

1402
01:53:33,803 --> 01:53:34,719
What happened, Kavya?

1403
01:54:45,886 --> 01:54:49,677
Sudden power outage means something is wrong

1404
01:54:49,678 --> 01:54:50,553
Go and check

1405
01:54:50,761 --> 01:54:51,303
Come on,

1406
01:55:01,719 --> 01:55:05,428
Hello Balaji, where are you? Buddy, I left with
the hard disk but Kavya has gone back for you

1407
01:55:09,969 --> 01:55:10,553
who's that?

1408
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:32,427
I know you are here, come out on your own,

1409
01:55:32,428 --> 01:55:34,302
else you will meet your end.

1410
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:35,553
You cannot escape.

1411
01:55:36,636 --> 01:55:38,511
Switch the power on

1412
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:09,969
Sir, Madam has been constantly calling

1413
01:59:10,969 --> 01:59:12,386
Say something and manage
Ok Sir

1414
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:19,428
These days, even if a normal person finds any evidence,
he's immediately posting that on Social Media

1415
01:59:19,678 --> 01:59:21,511
And you have a TV channel with you

1416
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,678
Why wouldn't you put out all the evidence in the open?

1417
01:59:26,803 --> 01:59:28,053
Why all this drama?

1418
01:59:29,261 --> 01:59:31,553
I really wish what happened
that day was a mere drama Sir

1419
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:39,968
Hey, are you fine? I am ok,
but where is Subba Rao uncle? He has not come here yet.

1420
01:59:39,969 --> 01:59:41,386
He still hasn't reached?

1421
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:44,678
One moment

1422
01:59:46,969 --> 01:59:49,219
Hello Uncle.
Where are you?

1423
01:59:49,761 --> 01:59:50,678
I am at the Police station.

1424
01:59:51,136 --> 01:59:51,886
Where is the hard disk?

1425
01:59:52,053 --> 01:59:54,136
It's safe with me, you don't worry

1426
01:59:54,594 --> 01:59:55,761
What is your plan?

1427
01:59:56,219 --> 01:59:58,719
I'm going to tell this directly to the public.
What do you wish for me to do?

1428
01:59:58,803 --> 02:00:00,843
Come to the rear gate of the office with the hard disk

1429
02:00:00,844 --> 02:00:02,594
I will be there in an hour

1430
02:00:04,136 --> 02:00:07,344
Sir, ACP Sir is calling you urgently.
What is the matter? No idea Sir,

1431
02:00:07,636 --> 02:00:10,053
he has asked you to bring that Dot Consultancy case file

1432
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,968
Subba Rao Sir
Do me a favour

1433
02:00:21,969 --> 02:00:22,678
Please tell me Sir

1434
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,969
We have found a small clue in our Constable
Chalapathi murder case at that Dot Consultancy

1435
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:27,844
What clue Sir?

1436
02:00:28,678 --> 02:00:29,969
He must have seen the CCTV footage

1437
02:00:35,594 --> 02:00:36,094
Look

1438
02:00:40,969 --> 02:00:45,928
This guy's name is Arjun,
I guess, you know him well

1439
02:00:46,386 --> 02:00:49,761
What's his link to that place?
Why was he there?

1440
02:00:51,261 --> 02:00:52,593
How would I know Sir?

1441
02:00:52,594 --> 02:00:53,594
One minute

1442
02:00:58,678 --> 02:00:59,844
Subba Rao
Sir

1443
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:01,803
Does this video remind you of anything?

1444
02:01:07,719 --> 02:01:14,011
Criminals can run away at the sight of Police,
but Police and criminals should not run away together

1445
02:01:15,261 --> 02:01:16,303
what's happening?

1446
02:01:17,219 --> 02:01:18,136
What are you hiding?

1447
02:01:19,094 --> 02:01:22,178
If you don't tell, I'll have to take action on both of you

1448
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:26,594
Sir, no Sir. Please listen to me Sir

1449
02:01:27,178 --> 02:01:29,011
Sir, one minute

1450
02:01:32,844 --> 02:01:36,636
I have some evidence to prove that
I have done no wrong. Come with me

1451
02:01:37,178 --> 02:01:37,803
Where?

1452
02:01:38,261 --> 02:01:39,136
To Arjun's house

1453
02:01:40,969 --> 02:01:42,761
Why would ACP go to your house?

1454
02:01:42,844 --> 02:01:43,802
To check the evidence?

1455
02:01:43,803 --> 02:01:46,053
Seeing all the material you have gathered,
ACP will only support us

1456
02:01:46,969 --> 02:01:47,386
No Buddy,

1457
02:01:48,761 --> 02:01:51,928
On that day at DoT Consultancy,
Tura Sarkar's gang was also present

1458
02:01:52,969 --> 02:01:54,928
But the CCTV footage has only me

1459
02:01:55,803 --> 02:01:56,594
Why is their footage missing?

1460
02:01:58,219 --> 02:01:59,136
Something is wrong

1461
02:02:01,803 --> 02:02:03,553
Is there no one at home?
No Sir,

1462
02:02:03,761 --> 02:02:06,219
I sent all of them to a safe place
Ok,

1463
02:02:07,469 --> 02:02:08,053
Sir, please come

1464
02:02:09,303 --> 02:02:09,844
Sir, please come

1465
02:02:10,136 --> 02:02:11,344
All these are proofs that..

1466
02:02:19,553 --> 02:02:21,011
Welcome Subba Rao!

1467
02:02:24,094 --> 02:02:30,636
Seeing all this, I am impressed how
I managed to create so many fake guys

1468
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:33,261
I hope now you know who I am

1469
02:02:33,928 --> 02:02:37,428
I am Thura Sarkar,

1470
02:02:40,553 --> 02:02:42,303
where is my hard disk?

1471
02:02:43,803 --> 02:02:44,636
What is this Sir?

1472
02:02:45,928 --> 02:02:48,969
Restoring a lost item to the owner is Police's job

1473
02:02:49,803 --> 02:02:53,844
Isn't it justified to give back his lost item,
Subba Rao? Give it.

1474
02:02:54,511 --> 02:02:56,719
Sir, this is wrong.
This is ONLY correct

1475
02:02:56,844 --> 02:02:59,136
If you don't give the hard disk,
you can't leave from here,

1476
02:03:01,511 --> 02:03:02,844
Hey Subba Rao,
stop

1477
02:03:20,803 --> 02:03:21,844
What happened to Subba Rao?

1478
02:03:22,303 --> 02:03:23,219
Where is he?

1479
02:03:26,469 --> 02:03:27,344
Is he in the room?

1480
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:30,261
Subba Rao!

1481
02:03:41,428 --> 02:03:42,136
Sorry Sir

1482
02:04:13,053 --> 02:04:18,303
Your friend's son is my friend too,
Subba Rao. See, he calls his dad by name

1483
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:22,094
Daddy

1484
02:04:26,094 --> 02:04:27,094
Daddy

1485
02:04:29,053 --> 02:04:30,011
Daddy

1486
02:04:34,219 --> 02:04:41,511
When I called you Subba Rao,
you would ask me to call you Daddy, but I never did

1487
02:04:43,053 --> 02:04:46,969
Now, when I'm calling you Daddy,
you are not listening

1488
02:04:48,428 --> 02:04:53,511
Daddy, just once Daddy...
Daddy...

1489
02:05:08,553 --> 02:05:09,136
Hello

1490
02:05:09,594 --> 02:05:11,511
Arjun Lenin Suravaram

1491
02:05:12,219 --> 02:05:12,803
how are you?

1492
02:05:13,678 --> 02:05:14,219
Who is this?

1493
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:16,178
Tura Sarkar!

1494
02:05:18,219 --> 02:05:21,761
The Department did not reward Subba Rao for his sincerity

1495
02:05:22,011 --> 02:05:23,844
Hence I did the honors

1496
02:05:25,469 --> 02:05:31,303
A constable nearing retirement,
a useless lawyer and a worthless channel...

1497
02:05:31,636 --> 02:05:35,969
This is your network, but my network...
It is the whole system

1498
02:05:37,469 --> 02:05:39,053
Do you have a TV around?

1499
02:05:40,511 --> 02:05:41,636
Go and watch it

1500
02:05:46,969 --> 02:05:49,885
Arjun Suravaram found to be the master
mind in the fake certificates scam

1501
02:05:49,886 --> 02:05:54,968
Shocking facts are emerging in this case
loaded with dramatic twists

1502
02:05:54,969 --> 02:06:01,594
Police sources have gathered that Arjun who was originally
arrested for an education loan fraud, has continued his

1503
02:06:01,678 --> 02:06:03,344
activities, upon getting bail

1504
02:06:03,386 --> 02:06:08,177
Police have raided house of the accused Arjun,
who in the garb of a reporter, cheated banks

1505
02:06:08,178 --> 02:06:11,927
In the raid, police found incriminating
material of his activities.

1506
02:06:11,928 --> 02:06:16,844
Arjun clandestinely got thousands of jobs
to unqualified people

1507
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:20,386
He is the alleged culprit behind the murder of one Ram K
Mian

1508
02:06:20,469 --> 02:06:25,303
at Dot consultancy and is also responsible for a Police
Constable's death at the same premises

1509
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:35,636
He even murdered Police constable Subba Rao
who is his close relative, in his desperation to cover up his crimes

1510
02:06:35,719 --> 02:06:39,678
ACP Sharrif has ordered immediate arrest of Arjun

1511
02:06:39,761 --> 02:06:42,303
Police is on the look out for Arjun

1512
02:06:43,553 --> 02:06:50,594
You love breaking news on channels, don't you? And Now,
YOU are the breaking news on all channels

1513
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:57,136
What will you do now, will you try to stop me?
Or will you save yourself?

1514
02:07:22,053 --> 02:07:23,303
You search the other side

1515
02:07:25,178 --> 02:07:26,136
Lock the doors

1516
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:46,343
Unemployed youth are protesting outside Commissioner's
office demanding Arjun's arrest in the fake certificate scam

1517
02:07:46,344 --> 02:07:49,678
Unemployed youth are protesting outside Commissioner's
office demanding Arjun's arrest in the fake certificate scam

1518
02:07:49,761 --> 02:07:51,928
Riots are breaking out at many places too

1519
02:07:51,969 --> 02:07:55,136
Police have intensified search to nab
the absconding Arjun Suravaram

1520
02:07:55,219 --> 02:08:01,261
Journalist Unions have revoked Arjun's primary membership

1521
02:08:01,344 --> 02:08:03,803
He's also one of the graduates,
who is a victim in the fake certificate scam

1522
02:08:03,844 --> 02:08:05,261
I was arrested a year ago for no fault of mine,
my certificate was also cancelled

1523
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:06,761
I was arrested a year ago for no fault of mine,
my certificate was also cancelled

1524
02:08:06,844 --> 02:08:10,553
Though I studied Engineering, I am forced to work in a petrol bunk
for a meagre Rs.150 per day, as I could not find a job

1525
02:08:10,636 --> 02:08:13,053
Just with one fake certificate, they are easily stealing jobs,
without any talent. The reason for all this is Arjun Suravaram

1526
02:08:13,136 --> 02:08:17,803
Just with one fake certificate, they are easily stealing jobs,
without any talent. The reason for all this is Arjun Suravaram

1527
02:08:17,844 --> 02:08:19,469
Arjun Suravaram should be punished

1528
02:08:19,553 --> 02:08:25,385
I am not the only one affected by this. Many students have suffered.
Arjun Survaram must be brought to justice.

1529
02:08:25,386 --> 02:08:28,261
Arrest Arjun!

1530
02:08:29,219 --> 02:08:35,178
We want justice!

1531
02:08:48,428 --> 02:08:51,511
You had escaped from the Police at the Hospital,
then why did you surrender now?

1532
02:08:52,469 --> 02:08:53,303
For evidence

1533
02:08:53,803 --> 02:08:54,553
What evidence?

1534
02:08:55,261 --> 02:08:57,844
There are so many proofs to say that you are a criminal

1535
02:08:58,261 --> 02:09:00,678
What evidence do you have to prove that you are speaking the truth?

1536
02:09:01,344 --> 02:09:02,928
Evidence collected from Burma Mansion

1537
02:09:03,219 --> 02:09:03,844
Where is it?

1538
02:09:09,261 --> 02:09:10,136
Tell me

1539
02:09:10,303 --> 02:09:11,219
It is right here!

1540
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:17,386
I don't believe you.
Don't believe me

1541
02:09:17,844 --> 02:09:20,053
But believe your dead Constable Subba Rao

1542
02:09:24,636 --> 02:09:25,719
Open his locker and check

1543
02:09:26,386 --> 02:09:28,719
I'll KILL you if this turns out to be a ploy

1544
02:09:38,011 --> 02:09:38,594
Leave the room

1545
02:09:58,011 --> 02:10:04,636
Go to the Police station and check my locker, how many cases
I have solved. Only then you will know my merit

1546
02:10:21,803 --> 02:10:23,969
Where is the Interrogation Officer?
He has gone out, Sir

1547
02:10:24,511 --> 02:10:26,303
Where?
Sir, he is in the locker room

1548
02:10:41,136 --> 02:10:42,969
Vikram, what are you doing here?

1549
02:10:43,219 --> 02:10:44,719
I came to check the case details Sir

1550
02:10:47,594 --> 02:10:48,594
Did he disclose anything?

1551
02:10:51,511 --> 02:10:52,344
No?

1552
02:10:55,303 --> 02:10:56,219
Don't worry

1553
02:10:58,261 --> 02:11:01,094
criminals can never get away

1554
02:11:04,928 --> 02:11:06,594
I will go and take care of him Sir

1555
02:11:33,928 --> 02:11:36,219
A cop is trained not to believe
things that he sees with his own eyes

1556
02:11:36,678 --> 02:11:38,844
When so many people are involved in this scam

1557
02:11:39,178 --> 02:11:43,469
why did you believe that I would get the hard disk
from the locker and give it to you?

1558
02:11:43,511 --> 02:11:45,719
I could be a corrupt officer too, right?

1559
02:11:46,344 --> 02:11:48,969
No corrupt officer will send their kids
to a government school, Sir

1560
02:11:50,844 --> 02:11:51,469
I know Sir

1561
02:11:52,594 --> 02:11:56,553
your son was also among the children
who died in that school collapse

1562
02:12:29,803 --> 02:12:32,553
How did you know that I will be on duty today?

1563
02:12:32,969 --> 02:12:35,844
I'm a Reporter Sir, Can I not find out that much?

1564
02:12:49,178 --> 02:12:50,303
Hey, where's that fellow?

1565
02:12:50,803 --> 02:12:53,844
Rascal! He hit me and escaped from that AC duct Sir

1566
02:12:55,511 --> 02:12:59,178
But don't worry,
criminals can never get away Sir

1567
02:13:00,844 --> 02:13:02,928
How could he escape through such a small hole?

1568
02:13:03,094 --> 02:13:05,844
People like you can't fit Sir,
but guys like him can

1569
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:26,344
Arjun

1570
02:13:27,511 --> 02:13:28,094
STOP!!

1571
02:13:38,053 --> 02:13:50,761
♫ Che Guevara... Che Guevara... You are Che Guevara today ♫

1572

1573
02:14:01,178 --> 02:14:03,511

1574
02:14:05,511 --> 02:14:08,553

1575

1577
02:14:19,719 --> 02:14:23,969
Anyone can become a Doctor, Engineer or Government
Employee without ANY qualification, with just a fake certificate

1578
02:14:24,303 --> 02:14:29,136
We now have the full details and undeniable
evidence about the gang behind this fake certificate scam

1579
02:14:29,303 --> 02:14:32,219
Behind every student, there is a
mother's dream, and a father's hard work

1580
02:14:37,261 --> 02:14:40,428
Certificates that we earn with
great hard work are not just pieces of paper.

1581
02:14:40,511 --> 02:14:41,344
It is our identity

1582
02:14:41,428 --> 02:14:44,843
Some guy is robbing our identity without our
knowledge and is selling them off to some undeserving people.

1583
02:14:44,844 --> 02:14:46,219
Hey guys, watch this

1584
02:14:48,094 --> 02:14:50,843
Not just our hard work but
they are also looting our dreams

1585
02:14:50,844 --> 02:14:53,635
Lives of thousands of students are
in a terrible quandary because of this 'fake' mafia

1586
02:14:53,636 --> 02:14:55,553
It is forcing many to commit suicides

1587
02:14:55,636 --> 02:14:58,428
They accused him of forgery and now
he is the one presenting evidence.

1588
02:14:58,553 --> 02:15:01,469
Only once the evidence comes out,
will we know if he is guilty or innocent.

1604
02:18:38,511 --> 02:18:46,219
Arjun, you have proved you would stop at nothing
to seek truth! Good job Arjun! You are an inspiration for us.

1605
02:19:25,969 --> 02:19:28,344
Telugu states woke up with a shock

1606
02:19:28,428 --> 02:19:31,969
Numerous agents involved in this case and many working in
Government

1607
02:19:32,053 --> 02:19:37,844
and Private Firms with fake certificates, without actual
qualifications are being arrested nationwide

1608
02:19:38,178 --> 02:19:42,094
It is shocking that Government doctors, Engineers, bank
officials, school teachers,

1609
02:19:42,178 --> 02:19:45,677
college professors and Police officers are among those
getting arrested.

1610
02:19:45,678 --> 02:19:48,594
Some of them are also working abroad
There are fake driving licenses too in these fake certificates

1611
02:19:48,636 --> 02:19:54,135
A minister is also found to be involved in this racket.
This explains how deep rooted and powerful this mafia is

1612
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:56,928
The Police department has paid tributes to the
services of Constable Subbarao

1613
02:19:57,011 --> 02:20:04,886
The main accused in this case, Tura Sarkar suffered severe head injury
while trying to destroy all evidence and is undergoing treatment

1614
02:20:04,969 --> 02:20:07,011
He is under tight security

1615
02:20:16,094 --> 02:20:20,178
My dear colleagues, I'm going to announce some good news

1616
02:20:20,844 --> 02:20:28,511
Our channel has risen from 46th position to 3rd position
Come on, let's give ourselves a big hand!!

1617
02:20:34,094 --> 02:20:34,969
Arjun!

1618
02:20:35,344 --> 02:20:38,844
You are the reason for this achievement today

1619
02:20:39,719 --> 02:20:47,386
You joined us when no body knew about TV99.
Today everyone knows us, ONLY because of you

1620
02:20:48,803 --> 02:20:52,761
And you leaving us all at this time makes me sad

1621
02:20:53,303 --> 02:20:56,844
But I am sure BBC suits you better

1622
02:20:57,386 --> 02:20:58,803
I am not joining BBC Sir

1623
02:21:00,386 --> 02:21:01,178
What?

1624
02:21:02,553 --> 02:21:07,261
It doesn't matter where we work Sir,
but what we do alone matters!
