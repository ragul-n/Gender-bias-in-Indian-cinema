1
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:14,743
Aadupuliyamtom

2
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:36,667
Knight of the Chola Kingdom and who ruled
the Chalukya city, king Udaya Manhandan.

3
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,632
In a typical full moon of autumn season,
when the trees shedding their leaves

4
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:45,080
King Udaya Manhandan went to
Thiruseni jungle for hunting.

5
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:55,232
Sempakam, daughter of the
jungle king Thimmayya

6
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:58,466
At first sight, Udaya Marthandan had fallen
in love with her

7
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,971
and married her with the
consent of Jungle king.

8
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:24,347
I am really lucky, Sempakam.
King, I am the lucky.

9
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,546
I was born in a caste who
cant touch even your shadow.

10
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:35,013
And, now I am sleeping in your lap,
which means I am really lucky

11
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:40,246
I have only one thing to give you
back for your love and concern.

12
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,447
That's my life...

13
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:53,641
Palaces were made for Sempakam
at the boarder of Thiruseni jungle

14
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
After many years, in the month of Avani,
Vallathurayan from Valluvar fort

15
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,532
came up with a big army and fought
with Udaya Varman.

16
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:07,413
King, army of Velluthurayan defeated
our horse cavalry.

17
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,606
Wthin some times they will
defeat this fort.

18
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,038
Before that, its better you to
escape from here.

19
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,232
The king who ﬂed from the palace,
reached near Sempakam

20
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,213
This palace is also surrounded
by enemies.

21
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:29,240
Story of Udaya Marthandan is going
to end today.

22
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,206
N o.

23
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:36,514
M
m

24
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:43,515
Even lakhs of soldiers could not
able to defeat them

25
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,232
You are a normal woman.
What can you do?

26
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:54,979
I can do. A normal woman cannot do
anything.

27
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,611
But, to protect your life
my spirit will be there

28
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:12,515
Spirit of Sempakam protected
the king and the palace.

29
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:28,233
After the demise of the king, priests
took the spirit of Sempakam to Idol of Kali

30
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,632
and placed in front of the fort.

31
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:36,412
Thus, that idol of Kali which is half
spirit and half god has become

32
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:43,482
the God of Vedar caste. And later, the fort
of Sempakam became 'Sempaka kottai'

33
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:15,246
Yeah, that's the guy.
Best businessman of the year, Sathyajith.

34
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:21,067
Even if he is a great guy, there will be a
rotten story in his life.

35
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,566
And, I will find that.

36
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:27,567
Leave two columns in tomorrows newspaper.
I will boil Sathyajith and place there.

37
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:33,746
Kunjinarayanan's one question is enough
to change his life upside down

38
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,513
What?? I am still in the office.

39
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,337
I came just now.

40
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,710
At 10 'O'clock I have meeting at..hh..
Labour commission office

41
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,008
Your meeting will be at..umm
sharp 11 O'clock.

42
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,332
Sir doesn't have any interest
in welcome ceremony.

43
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:59,213
Sathyajith sir has only one interest, ..
Chutney... Chutney????

44
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,499
Hey, I said it here

45
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,674
From 1? to 26," conference.
At Hongkong.

46
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,173
You can fix it afterwords.
Lets see.

47
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,410
Good morning

48
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,637
I called you
Didn't pick up.

49
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:22,073
I don't pick up. Boss told me to don't
attend any rascal's call.

50
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,641
Really'?!
Yeah..

51
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:29,566
I know that, you are not only Sathyajith
sir's manager, but also friend.

52
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,432
Oh really!!! so, you came after knowing
everything, right baby'?!

53
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:37,404
I don't need interview for a long time
I just need to ask one question.

54
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,532
For shaming him, right?

55
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,537
You wont see sir in this life even
if you try your best, Konchunarayan.

56
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,732
Man, celebration is going on there as he
won the award.

57
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,732
'Ne are busy as we are going there.
You get lost.

58
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,406
In which hall?

59
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,499
Hey, its not in any hall. At the center
of some real men.

60
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,310
Real men??? where is it??

61
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,207
Cute baby..
Give me the baby

62
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:20,512
D
u

63
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:24,039
Wham is there to give her?

64
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,206
Hold this... are all happy??

65
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,412
We can visit this house before going.
Mother in this house is ill.

66
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,466
Mung

67
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:54,539
<i>Willa.</i>

68
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,340
Only one question. I wont leave you
without answering that question

69
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,740
No need of than. You get lost.

70
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,107
Hey.. ask me.

71
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:10,251
You were very poor, rascal and a criminal
15 years ago

72
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:14,532
And now, how did you become a big builder?
I need to know than...

73
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,274
I should know that"

74
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:25,146
Question is serious. So, our answer
should be serious.

75
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,366
Konju sir, please come
Whats the matter?

76
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,066
We could sit and write it down.
Ac is inside this room.

77
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:34,266
Ac?? in this room???
Yeah, even wifi is available here.

78
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,799
So, what about password?
My clothes.

79
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,799
Oh teared.

80
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,799
Hey, what are you doing?
You.. stop there

81
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,566
m;
WW?

82
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,707
I will tell the password of wifi.
No. I don't want.

83
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:49,266
Dear, its spicy,

84
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,366
HE]

85
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,347
Master, shall I get some drinking water?

86
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,645
Very spicy..
Give them dear.

87
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,639
What happened?

88
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,413
There is a worm inside this.

89
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,203
Worm???

90
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,741
Hey, there is no worm inside this
Give me than.

91
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,407
There is nothing inside this, dad.

92
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,666
Here is the cash.

93
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,766
Clan master..
Sir..

94
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,032
Keep this. Ask me if you need
anything else

95
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,032
OK sir.

96
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,637
Come dear...

97
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,612
There is no specific definition in
psychiatry for your condition.

98
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,499
I have discussed this case with
many world class professionals.

99
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,332
Many times.
They are also helpless.

100
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,566
Its dangerous to increase the dose
of sleeping pills again

101
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,741
So, my treatment wont be helpful
for you here after.

102
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,644
I have been telling to him from the first
day of consultation that it wont be helpful

103
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,647
<i>mm?
Get out and stay (here.</i>

104
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,303
Oh..l got it.

105
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,278
Nowadays, one cannot tell a truth.

106
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,479
I need to sleep doctor.
At least for some time. Please

107
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,746
Sathyajith, I wont say that what I studied
and practice are the only rights

108
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:13,074
The real medicine could be anything
which cures a person.

109
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,971
WEE

110
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,504
I may not say this to a normal
patient who comes to see me

111
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,066
I can't stop saying this to you
as you are my friend.

112
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:29,140
There is a great person who used
to wonder us in the study of mind

113
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:37,244
His observation has great value than the
thousands of books we taught in psychiatry

114
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,675
Perhaps, he could help you to solve
your mental problem.

115
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:48,977
Maheshwara Yogi. His devotees might say
he is a prophesier..

116
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,199
Where is he, now?
Its difficult to find him

117
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,044
But, one guy could say it correctly.

118
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:08,782
Swamiji is in the Agastyakoodam forrest.

119
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:20,439
He will return from there only after
new moon. Where will he go next?...

120
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:24,680
I don't know..
Is it the ﬂight of air India?

121
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,338
WEE

122
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:51,133
Exactly 366 km from here

123
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:54,547
Hey Sathya, I am wondered that
you believed this

124
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,799
That doctor is Yogi's agent.

125
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,474
Campaigning with intelligent people is
the current trend in bluffing.

126
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,166
Haven't you seen in TV?
I too got pot..don't you need jack pot?

127
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,599
If he is a cheater, why
has he gone to forrest?

128
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,299
Because, he cant stay in village or town

129
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,440
People who abscond after borrowing money
from someone, return back as swamies.

130
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:17,132
Keep quiet, lady. Why do you always say
'right' or 'left' when someone in the car?

131
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:20,033
This is a useless journey.
Keep quiet man.

132
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,342
OK.

133
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,199
See, she took us to the forest and left.

134
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,476
Though its machine, this
stuff is a lady, right?

135
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:43,514
This is awesome. What Jagathi bro said is
true 'this jungle is full of forest'.

136
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:47,614
Hey Sathya, don't take rest inside
Come out and see the forest, man.

137
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,999
Where has he gone?

138
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,413
Hey Sathya..Sathya..
Sathya...

139
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,632
Oh..ok.
Shall we go?

140
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,999
To where'?!
Until we meet Yogi.

141
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,412
Are animals there in this forest?
Yes, of course.

142
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,732
Then, we will definitely meet Yogi.

143
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:08,978
Sathya, only swami has fast. The tigers
and lion do not have any fast.

144
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:12,999
Oh my god, may they have eaten something.
Come on, man

145
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,971
You wont understand, right?
What is this? Grass hm!!!!??

146
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,704
Hey, come.
I am coming

147
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,405
Now we cant go. Its river.

148
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:58,342
Oh bear... bear..bear..oh god..

149
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:04,409
Hey stop there Come here.
Come here

150
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:11,310
Was it not bear'?!
That's a human being, right?

151
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,212
Sathya.

152
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,566
He is a forest man who
came to collect honey.

153
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:21,266
He says to reach Agasthyakoodam
we need to cross a big river

154
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:25,443
Good, now we cant go, right?
He will take us the other side You come.

155
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:27,439
Damn it.

156
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,366
Do we really need this?
Hey sit.

157
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:40,008
Don't worry. Haven't you seen this in
films? I have seen this sinking in films

158
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,466
muslin

159
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,032
another guy took us in a boat and
left in this deep forest.

160
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,014
Now who will take us from here'?!
And to where??!!

161
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,237
Again forest, right?

162
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:17,666
Hey, I am hungry.
Your hunger will be gone when you see Yogi.

163
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:21,166
Really'?! Is he running a hotel there?
And, good dishes will be there.

164
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,340
Tiger fry, Lion curry, pepper bear.

165
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,340
Shut up and come on.

166
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,707
Sathya, stop here. Do you have any idea
where are you going?

167
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,541
Sathya, we can go back.

168
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,766
Saju, you can go back if you want to.

169
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:45,632
Anyway, I wont be going back without
meeting Maheshwara yogi.

170
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,011
Even if I need to face any dangers

171
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:07,410
A decomposing memory is haunting you.

172
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:19,684
Two years and six days ago, you bought
an old divine land in your name

173
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,780
'Sempaka Fort.'

174
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:37,547
You bought monstrous spirits for money
who were waiting for you.

175
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:42,345
Fate..
Unchangeable fate.

176
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:52,050
Those spirits sleep in that land for around
last twelve years

177
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:58,243
13 days remaining to complete twelve years.

178
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:02,441
Before that, a big 'crisis'...

179
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:15,567
If we let those spirits go out from there,
prayer and chanting cant stop them

180
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,247
They will destroy the entire family.

181
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,546
Swami," what is the remedy?

182
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:38,146
The persons they search should come
in front of them. That's the solution.

183
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:47,317
In the next 13 days, you should be there in
that land where spirits sleep.

184
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,708
The next day of new moon,
I will reach there

185
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,543
Until than, follow my instructions.

186
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,177
Take sand from the four corners of
Sempaka fort. And, bring that here.

187
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,699
Swamiji don't know as he is in the forest.

188
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,699
Its police case if someone smuggle
sand in native.

189
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:15,083
Be careful. Those spirits have decided
death for you and your family.

190
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:27,105
You need to win the death.
'DEATH'

191
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:33,333
Why he needs this sand? It may be for
giving to some higher officials

192
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,333
We can just take some sand from anywhere

193
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:38,132
How could he know it belong
to Sempaka fort or not?

194
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:41,132
Shut up. Just now, he told about
the destruction of my family.

195
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,233
I cant celebrate that, the way you
does right now.

196
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,533
Hey, are you serious'?!
Wham do you want now?

197
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:49,378
Bring sand from Sempaka fort, right?
I will go and bring it.

198
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,080
Spirits wont play with me.

199
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,306
Sempaka Fort.

200
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,239
So, we have reached Sempaka fort.

201
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:32,783
If swamies hear some fort's or villa's
name, they will say it belongs to spirits.

202
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:38,038
Is this spirits don't live in
a small house? Silly ghost..

203
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,777
Valley of ghosts.

204
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:59,367
Song in horror movies.

205
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:16,638
Hail

206
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,099
First corner. ls the ghosts still wear the
same white and white clothes.

207
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,977
Or, are they new generation?

208
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,047
Sometimes ghosts might die by watching
new generation boys of today.

209
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,732
Second corner.

210
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,099
Firstly,; Yogi will tell to take sand from
four corners.

211
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,273
Then, he will tell to take money
from four bags.

212
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,404
Third corner is...
here..

213
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:03,273
The last one. Fourth corner.

214
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,307
Over. Now, I shall go near Yogi.

215
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,572
What a wind.

216
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,246
Who has opened this door?

217
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:47,208
How did this close?
Damn wind.

218
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:52,533
Hi, smell of chicken.

219
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,639
So, food is being prepared here, right?

220
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:04,206
Hey...

221
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:06,740
where is it?

222
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,508
H ere..

223
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,410
Oh.. there...!!

224
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,509
Hey, a guest has come. A special guest.

225
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:24,209
This set up is good.

226
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:29,508
Yogi.. this is not the land of spirits.
Its the land of some cool guys.

227
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:34,233
Its

228
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,738
If you find no one in a house,
will you make food there?

229
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,333
Come here dear.

230
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,746
If you are that nervous,
I need to see you.

231
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,647
So, there is no cooking here, right?

232
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:58,408
Oh, its parcel, right?
I will show you..

233
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:03,114
Hey... dean.
What is this?

234
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:06,312
You are staying here
And, now are you playing hide and seek?

235
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,204
Come here

236
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:12,303
What?

237
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,613
I went there and came back.

238
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,642
Hey...

239
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,741
Who has put this cloth in your mouth?

240
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:40,666
I only put this cloth in my mouth as I may
frighten by listening my own crying.

241
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:44,308
What happened, actually?
Haven't you gone to Sempaka fort?

242
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,510
Haven't you brought the sand?

243
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:50,366
Then...
Tell me what exactly happened?

244
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:55,783
It was not clear. Just a shadow"
He is a great guy.

245
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,240
'Who??
That yogi in the forest.

246
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:02,438
He wont be caught by tiger or lion
He is divine ...divine.

247
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,700
I teased him when he said ghost
in that fort. But...

248
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:12,107
I went there and came back.

249
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,681
When l opened the eyes it was standing
in front of me by wearing saree and blouse

250
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:05,449
Before it attacking me, I attacked.
I bit her neck.

251
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,066
Then...

252
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:10,014
That was the nurse here.
She has eight stitches.

253
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,032
That is ...she..

254
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,011
Dracula...

255
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:18,011
Please take care of her, sister.
Get lost.

256
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:24,766
Hey, where is the sand you took?
Its inside the car's dicky.

257
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:27,566
Elm

258
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:32,607
You shouldn't go to Sempaka fort. You
cant come back They will kill you, sure

259
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,615
My Amala and Ami should be saved.
Even if I need to die..

260
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:10,741
You have to hand this over to father
Arulmozhi in Thanjavoor.

261
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:15,544
This,..you have to give to usthad Alam Ali
who is in Erwadi.

262
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,204
Not any messenger. By yourself.

263
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:57,705
The one who is judged has to come
at any cost.

264
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,042
You are tested, right?
Yes father.

265
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:45,480
I will do what is needed.
But, the final decision...

266
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:08,509
Danger is coming"

267
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,205
May Allaha bless you.

268
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,442
Plan for how many days?

269
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,203
I don't know...

270
00:43:32,134 --> 00:43:34,599
Things for which I am going
should be alright.

271
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,011
Oh. "TY--

272
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,638
From where Sunny and Appu join you?

273

Their wives will start calling me
when you leave from here.

274
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:52,214
You guys are friends from the childhood.

275
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:55,348
Sometimes you guys need to get
together and celebrate That's usual..

276
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,599
This time, even though they are with me,

Anyway, a journey is good for you now.

Hey, nothing.

295
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:09,177
You will learn it, when dad

Sathya, shall I keep in the car?

You rascal"
This is temple, don't use bad words.

314
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,333
Mother goddess, give me knowledge

322
00:46:56,534 --> 00:46:59,981
My dear Jyothi, don't put
pressure in this matter.

323
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,633
When Samyajith became a big businessman, why
did he appoint me and Sunny as in charge

324
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:08,081
His good heart. I wont ask him
questions such as 'what or 'where'..

325
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:10,533
- Will you come if something
happen to mother, Appu?

326
00:47:10,534 --> 00:47:13,733
Then, I have to come, right?
Then I will bring you.

327
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:16,578
How??
I will kill mother.

328
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:24,176
Really. Every morning mother goes to
kitchen first. I will switch on the gas.

329
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,171
Hey JyothL. don't play with me.

330
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:28,473

00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,599
Appuetta...

333
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:34,771
Killing your mother.

334
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:56,733
WEE

335
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:58,733

I didn't call you.

336
00:47:58,734 --> 00:48:00,233
I was asking him whether he said the truth.

337
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,533
You will be in problem of
eight (big trouble), ok.

338
00:48:01,534 --> 00:48:05,233
Its

339
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:08,733
0k, I will say. When you write 1, it has a
beginning and an end.

340
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:14,741
3 has got three ways 5 has away towards
there and here. But 8 doesn't have any ways

341
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,533
The guy who goes inside will doomed
with troubles, poverty etc.

342
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:21,066
That's called problem of eight.
So, you know everything, right?

343
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,132
Yes, I know.

344
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,511
Are you going to face
it by knowing all this?

345
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:31,766
Rogue has come though he is lame.

00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,566

00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:44,466
Hungry for dying.
Why are you so lame?

350
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:47,004

00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,799
Laugh... you laugh.

00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,699
We don't have any time to waste

356
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,633
Should I drive the car?
No, I don't have license.

357
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:10,333
Oh, I didn't think about that.

358
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:11,766
Hey, come here.

359
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,576

Shall we go back to our memory?

361
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:26,199
Some years ago...

362
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,975

Sit sit..

367
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,976
In Mahabharata, when Srikrishnan was teaching
Arjun the knowledge to break Padmavyuham,

368
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:09,799
(a military strategy), Abhimanyu who was
a fetus inside Subhadra's uterus learned it

369
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,543
As a result, Abhimanyu became
a warrior at his birth.

370
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,200
In the mythology and purana which were
crossed the ocean are being researched

371
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,499
for this by western countries for
hundreds of years.

372
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,500
In Mahabharatha, Abhimanyu knew everything
about the news happen around him and palace

373
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,376
Now, your doubt is, whether your babies
are able to do like this.?

374
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,735
Yes its possible.

375
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:42,741
That divine method is called
Esabana shamina abhimanyu therapy.

376
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:49,480

method to the world have reached here.

As mother Subhadra was sleeping, Abhimanyu
could not listen all military strategy

Through Esabana shamina Abhmanyu therapy,

397
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,442
Dear... oh Swami..

398
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:21,638
Swami, its my wife pregnant.

399
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:24,366
And please take care of her specially.
What?

400
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,566
She might sleep inside the class.
That..

401
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:29,166
There wasn't any need of class,
if he had slept over night.

402
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,043
Fernandes??!!

403
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,745
Swami, my wife has not become pregnant.
We don't do that kind of work.

404
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,679
But, I doubt there is a small pregnancy.
Ohh..

405
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:46,499
So, I came to know whether she could
sit in your class, swami.

406
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,299
<i>Fernandes“.</i>

407
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,376
This pregnant lady should get our help
at any cost. So, take the money and admit

408
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,732

So, patient's wish and doctor's
order was the same.

00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,374
Hey...

411
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,442
We gave a chance to those
who deserved to be bluffed. That's all

412
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,266
I didn't think that it
would work out like this.

413
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:25,566
It will work out again Visa cheating.
Marriage cheating..goat..manchiyam( tree)

golden yam, silver owl, pearl of snake.

415
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:32,344
Along with intelligence and education, god
gave one more thing to Malayali, 'greed'

416
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,999
This is its price

417
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,571
If we don't cheat these guys
others will cheat.

418
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,199
After Kasargod operation, we
will leave Kerala Enjoy...

Hey, cock is crowing...

423
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,799
Then, in the morning, will cock
sing song instead of crowing?

424
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,780
Wham a joke?..
Hey, take the hands off..

01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,281
In the presence of all of you, today
it should be done.

504
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,472
In front of this Kaliamman, I am
going to tie her knot(marry)

505
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:22,509
Play the music..

506
01:08:22,634 --> 01:08:25,433
Come mathangi, this is the good time.
No..

507
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,711
Kaliamma is present in Mathang's body now.
Stop it..

508
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:34,533
Kaliyamman knows only to drink blood,
Aadhiswaran knows how to sheds blood

509
01:08:34,534 --> 01:08:36,605
<i>Aadhiswara...
hey“.</i>

510
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:11,267
CBI... hey CBI... come out side.
Now, we don't need to fear any police.

511
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,310
Its for the first time drinking
peacefully in 3000 acres

512
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:22,800
Bimini

513
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,800
Don't drink alcohol where
kaliamman is present.

514
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:28,499
Oh really!!! she is learning to be mother.

515
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,299
Hey kid, don't say big things
with your little mouth.

516
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,033
Go and bring some pickle.
Make a drink man.

517
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:35,206
Go go..

518
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,678
You...

519
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:51,166
Who has tied you?
Thank god, they haven't cut us.

520
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:54,546
Hey, tell me who has tied you?
See, they are coming.

521
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,280
I know why you are here.

522
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,375
The guys who came to throw us out,
have not gone back properly.

523
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,976
The place Kaliamman sits is belong to us

524
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,371
Blood of those who come to sell this place
will be sheds on the face of Kaliamman

525
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,140
You have misunderstood u; Mathangi madam
Why do we throw you out?

526
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:32,648
We are some social workers from Kerala
We did a lot of social work in kerala

527
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,408
That's why we are tied like this

528
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:41,066
Yes. Serving rice to unmarried girls
giving spoken English classes for

529
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:43,666
those old couples who are
abandoned by their children.

530
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:46,633
<i>Mam.</i>

531
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:51,640
Now, we would like to do our social work
in Tamilnadu also. We came here for that"

532
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:56,199
When we came here, we got a good place
to stay. So, we stayed here... that's all..

533
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,671
And, we have seen directly the
power you possess, madam.

534
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,172
Now, we have become your fan.

535
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:06,799
If you are lying, Kaliamman show me that.
Then, no one will go back

536
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,579
If you are lying, Kaliamman show me that.
Then, no one will go back

537
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,780
How is that?
Wham? How?

538
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:59,566
Now you did it, right?
Oh..that one

Not like that... laugh nicely...

Shall I show one more trick?

Don't come here in search of her by thinking
that no one is there to take care of them.

555
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,272
I will be here"
for their protection.

556
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,146
Malli..
Catch... catch.

557
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,776
Stop there. Don't pamper my
daughter by buying these stuffs.

558
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,374
I wont let her to see even
a colourful dream.

559
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,506
You will go one day.
By leaving my daughter's cry.

560
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,738
Wham if I am not going?

561
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,612
I didn't say it simply to
challenge Aadhiswaran.

562
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,980
I love you..

563
01:19:28,034 --> 01:19:33,040
I love to be a guardian to you and your kid

564
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,146
I was asking Kaliamman for
permission to make you my own.

565
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:02,548
This doll is so beautiful, right mom?

566
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:06,547
Do you like him, mom?
who?

567
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:11,208
The person who came to fort.

568
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:21,041
I like him very much.
I like he should be with us, mom

569
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:30,110
Its not wrong. Kaliamman has sent him for
your child's happiness and your protection.

570
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:10,271
Get inside with right leg first.
God bless you.

571
01:24:58,534 --> 01:25:02,983
Now, I am the wife of a man.
Don't hurt me. He will come now.

572
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:08,434
Who?? Sathyajith???
He only send him here.

573
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:11,641
Hey, don't talk about him like this..
Hey, stop it.

574
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:17,342
Wham did you think about him?
Lover.. blessing from kaliamman.

575
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:21,566
Do you know, why he came here?
And why he married you?

576
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:23,342
<i>Do you know'?!</i>

577
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:28,640
I stopped my wish for you, when you cut me

578
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:34,566
Again it started, when he came to meet me

579
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:39,566
Aadhiswara, you wont get
Mamhangi through force.

580
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:46,007
If you stay with me and obey me, you will
get money and Mathangi for ever.

581
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:49,240
Advance.

582
01:25:51,667 --> 01:25:56,412
I need only her, 'Mamhangi'

583
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:13,010
My coming back, his beatings, loving you
were all acting

584
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:21,738
He came here as he is paid
to throw you out.

585
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:24,540
You became failed in front of you.

586
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:27,974
Your Kaliamman also failed.

587
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,047
It was not the registering of marriage
in the register office,

588
01:26:36,067 --> 01:26:39,674
it was the consent to go out from here.
Did you get it now.

589
01:26:43,134 --> 01:26:45,307
0k, leave it. I am here for you

590
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,978
Though he tied the knot,
you are mine.

591
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:57,776
Only mine" come...
come.come on..

592
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,480
Why are you afraid of me?

593
01:27:02,701 --> 01:27:04,703
Leave... leave me...

594
01:27:06,734 --> 01:27:08,599
Try

595
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,580
Leave me... leave..

596
01:27:15,067 --> 01:27:17,479
Malli... malli..come.

597
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,142
Are they inside?
Nobody is here

598
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,175
come here, pal.

599
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:49,480
Aadhiswaran has made
the first night awesome

600
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:51,300
No WW
Why?

601
01:28:51,301 --> 01:28:55,477
According to the circumstantial evidence,
in this ground, Aadhiswaran might have

602
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,479
beaten a century or else
Mathangi would have taken the wicket.

603
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,566
Anyway, I could go and say bravely
that I have emptied the sempaka fort.

604
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:07,466
Though we have conducted many cheating;
this is our first marriage cheating.

605
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:10,733
Bride groom operation success.
Nobody is inside the house.

606
01:29:10,734 --> 01:29:14,648
Aadhiswaran might have taken her, or else,
she has gone from here with her girl

607
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,666
Anyway, the culprit is Aadhiswaran.

608
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:20,547
Sathya, everything is over as
per your plan Whats next'?!

609
01:29:20,767 --> 01:29:22,610
Shut it down.

610
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:36,466
Mom... mom..mom
they are burning our house

611
01:30:36,467 --> 01:30:39,539
I am afraid, mom
Don't worry.

612
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:46,147
He cant go so long. He will be brought back
again by goddess Kali.

613
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,146
Mom..

614
01:31:18,367 --> 01:31:21,644
When Appu told about you, I didn't
think that you are this skillful.

615
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:27,667
Business of 3000 acres is pending
because of her and her's Kaliamman

616
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,336
Now, its over, sir.

617
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:36,976
Its more than you asked.

618
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:48,643
If similar problems come, definitely I
will call you. You have to settle it.

619
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:53,741
That's cool.
Give me that"

620
01:31:54,534 --> 01:31:58,141
Credit of this money is mine
This was my contract.

621
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:06,516
How loving was he?
Why is he doing this?

622
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:10,314
Wont he come again?

623
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:18,005
Are you hungry?
No mom Its 0k

624
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,071
Where are they now?
who?

625
01:32:49,767 --> 01:32:51,178
Mathangi and daughter'.

626
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:58,583
'Ne cheated foolish rich people so far.
But this., to tie a woman knot..

627
01:32:59,267 --> 01:33:03,716
Luring a small girl by saying lies.
We shouldn't have done this

628
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,171
Bro, don't cut jokes. We will cry.

629
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:13,399
Sadness of mom and daughter is mixed
with this along with soda and water.

630
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,471
Take it in a sip.

631
01:33:17,301 --> 01:33:24,480
Though I have earned lakhs, tears of that
mother and girl is not going from heart.

632
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,975
I got hand full of money.
And, head full of curse.

633
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,073
It wasn't needed.

634
01:33:32,401 --> 01:33:36,713
Mom, I am hungry.

635
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,473
Is there anything to eat?

636
01:33:43,534 --> 01:33:45,104
Just coming.

637
01:34:08,134 --> 01:34:13,311
We need to find them This sin
wont be forgiven until that.

638
01:34:13,534 --> 01:34:16,105
<i>'E?</i>

639
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,133
I have decided it after
thinking a lot.

640
01:34:18,134 --> 01:34:19,204
Sathya, you..

641
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:22,433
She is the woman whom I tied knot.

642
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:25,415
She should be with me when
I am going back

643
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:52,044
I have searched in forest and village
I couldn't see her.

644
01:34:54,034 --> 01:34:57,504
You remember your word, right?
Bring her here, if you find her.

645
01:34:57,634 --> 01:35:01,377
I am searching her not to handover her to
you, its to hold her hands

646
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,979
Mom..l am hungry"

647
01:35:25,734 --> 01:35:31,377

Shall I call you dad?

671
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:06,575
Be with me always..

672
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,307
See, here..

673
01:41:06,067 --> 01:41:09,514
I ended everything here.
But, you didn't say this to us.

674
01:41:10,567 --> 01:41:13,446
I was trying to hide
everything even from me.

675
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:19,549
When Sempaka fort came for
sale, I bought it for this

676
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:22,033
Shall I ask you one thing?

677
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:25,641
You cruel.. Did you send me alone
to here after doing all this?

678
01:41:26,134 --> 01:41:27,306
How poor am I?

679
01:41:27,367 --> 01:41:30,032
Mom and daughter crushed and
made my juice

680
01:41:30,033 --> 01:41:34,004
Now, they can put one straw
and drink like this

681
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:38,108
If the ghost catch me, will my
wife believe that?

682
01:41:38,234 --> 01:41:40,339
She will say that I caught
ghost's butt.

683
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:45,366
OK then, you continue talking
I just remember one thing.

684
01:41:45,367 --> 01:41:48,566
My aunt's driver's neighbour is
celebrating his child's baptism

685
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:52,033
I need to conduct that on behalf
of his dad. I will be back soon

686
01:41:52,034 --> 01:41:55,208
OK bro.. don't think that I
am leaving you guys alone

687
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,743
ok bro..

688
01:41:58,567 --> 01:42:00,566
I will be back.
Don't go alone..

689
01:42:00,567 --> 01:42:02,444
Die or death; We will be together'.

690
01:42:02,567 --> 01:42:04,566
Stop there"
catch him.

691
01:42:04,567 --> 01:42:06,366
Baptism or ghost; Which one is
important for you?

692
01:42:06,367 --> 01:42:10,440
Don't worry about baptism.
We need to tie your legs

693
01:42:22,567 --> 01:42:29,212
We have a respectful life now.
And, it was made by Amala

694
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:33,012
Advised and made me to start business.
And, we have reached until this point..

695
01:42:33,234 --> 01:42:35,646
In return, at least I need to
protect her life.

696
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:42,449
I have only one prayer; Amala and kid
shouldn't come here till this pooja over.

697
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:59,637
See, dad..
God has heard your prayer.

698
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,777
Dad...
honey..

699
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:07,540
She hasn't sleep from the day you left home

700
01:43:07,767 --> 01:43:10,543
She got fever. When she
cried, I brought her here

701
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:13,113
Good..its a good place to be calm.

702
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:17,347
Good place. Is this a fort?
Yeah..graveyard!!

703
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:20,203
What Saju? Wham happened?

704
01:43:20,267 --> 01:43:22,033
I don't know. When I am happy,
I am like this nowadays

705
01:43:22,034 --> 01:43:25,675
Spirits take everyone there
whom they wish to see there

706
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:30,514
Going back is impossible
If try so, its dangerous

707
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:48,703
Don't go..

708
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:40,099
Who are you?
My name is Malli

709
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,137
Are you Tamil?
Yes..

710
01:45:42,367 --> 01:45:46,247
Aama (tortoise)
I don't know Tamil, ok

711
01:45:46,367 --> 01:45:52,181
I will teach you everything. Come.

712
01:46:05,534 --> 01:46:06,706
Sathya.

713
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:09,079
What??

714
01:46:09,401 --> 01:46:12,733
It used to be like coming to a festival
when you guys join together.

715
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:16,633
Songs, talkings..how fun was that?
Now, what happened to all?

716
01:46:16,634 --> 01:46:21,634
Hey, nothing.
No. It seems all of you have some tension.

717
01:46:21,734 --> 01:46:24,099
And, this place too. Its like.

718
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,707
Hey, nothing is here
You don't think unnecessarily. Come.

719
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,172
Who is that'?!

720
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:56,076
Umm good Where did you get this song?
Malli taught me.

721
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:03,080
Mall??? who is that Malli?
She belong to here.

722
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,175
She is Tamil.

723
01:47:13,001 --> 01:47:16,710
Good eyes and smile.
She is cute..

724
01:47:17,534 --> 01:47:19,514
I like Malli a lot.

725
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:25,612
Malli knows a lot of tricks.
I will show it now..

726
01:47:27,101 --> 01:47:28,978
Hey, slowly..

727
01:47:35,101 --> 01:47:36,273
Nice..

728
01:49:03,134 --> 01:49:04,766
Hello
Appuvetta.

729
01:49:04,767 --> 01:49:09,307
Yes Jyothi. I will be back soon, ok.
Shhhh.. Don't talk.

730
01:49:09,767 --> 01:49:13,112
Now you can listen a sound, right?
What sound?

731
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:18,466
I don't listen anything.
Don't hurry, you thief.

732
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:22,472
Mother is only going to the kitchen.
Gas is switched on.

733
01:49:22,734 --> 01:49:25,066
Honey"
Or else, you cut the call.

734
01:49:25,067 --> 01:49:26,671
I will call you back after your
mom's blast.

735
01:49:27,267 --> 01:49:32,166
Hey, I will come soon.
No need. Just come for the ceremony.

736
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:34,433
I am coming now. You go and switch off
that gas, please..

737
01:49:34,434 --> 01:49:35,640
Then ok.

738
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:39,433
If I tell them that I am going, they
will stop me by saying Yogi's name.

739
01:49:39,434 --> 01:49:44,434
My wife is bigger than the ghost of dead.
She is a monster: Only I know that..

740
01:49:44,634 --> 01:49:49,200
Uncle"
Keep quiet. Honey, don't say anybody

741
01:49:49,201 --> 01:49:52,533
I will go and inform them through phone.
I wont say. You can go uncle..

742
01:49:52,534 --> 01:49:53,706
Good girl..

743
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:48,310
Police confirmed that it was an accident.
Then, what madness you are telling, Sathya?

744
01:51:52,067 --> 01:51:54,138
Its not madness Truth..

745
01:51:55,334 --> 01:52:00,306
This may be the only thing which happened
in my dirty past that I haven't told you.

746
01:52:03,101 --> 01:52:05,980
I am ready to accept any punishment you say

747
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:12,679
But, before that... our child.

748
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:17,978
I cant bear if you say anything about
our girl who is innocent.

749
01:52:18,434 --> 01:52:22,109
How she will be the culprit for the
mistake you did, Sathya?

750
01:52:28,368 --> 01:52:32,339
You are tired. Go and sleep for some times.
Umm go..

751
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:41,012
Come on mom. I need to sleep.

752
01:52:42,267 --> 01:52:43,245
Come...

753
01:54:20,067 --> 01:54:25,574
Sathya.. Sathya.
I saw" our girl..l saw her..

754
01:54:57,034 --> 01:55:02,746
Ami... Ami"
Swam..my daughter.

755
01:55:03,567 --> 01:55:08,209
Take the child and lie down inside
Sathya... what happened?

756
01:55:15,634 --> 01:55:20,634
Mom, I am hungry.. am hungry"
Mom"

757
01:55:22,334 --> 01:55:27,334
<i>“mm</i>
U

758
01:55:28,234 --> 01:55:30,407
You go and take some water.

759
01:55:35,634 --> 01:55:37,333
Honey,"
Swami..

760
01:55:37,334 --> 01:55:41,305
Sathyajith, both of you stay outside.
Let she be here.

761
01:55:47,001 --> 01:55:49,607
Come..come..

762
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:27,676
Spirit of Malli is preparing for
destroying everything

763
01:56:46,367 --> 01:56:54,548
Kaliamman placed here is the safeguard of
the spirit who was buried 6 centuries ago..

764
01:56:56,367 --> 01:57:00,645
When Kaliamman's power has diminished
because of the absence of regular prayer..

765
01:57:01,067 --> 01:57:04,640
The spirit who was buried in it
has become powerful.

766
01:57:08,367 --> 01:57:11,541
That power is present in child's spirit.

767
01:57:16,334 --> 01:57:18,712
We have to start pooja immediately.

768
01:57:23,634 --> 01:57:29,414
Within next 60 hours we could
be able to control the spirit.

769
01:57:33,734 --> 01:57:35,611
Otherwise...

770
01:57:49,434 --> 01:57:52,244
We need to find child's bones.

771
01:58:21,201 --> 01:58:22,509
Honey..

772
01:58:23,634 --> 01:58:28,083
Honey no... oh dean.

773
01:58:57,801 --> 01:58:59,542
Swami, my daughter;

774
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:04,671
My dean.

775
01:59:13,701 --> 01:59:15,476
Why did you come now?

776
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:18,473
Did you come when I was waiting for you?

777
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:21,576
Did you come when I was hungry?

778
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:24,580
Did you come'?! did you come'?!

779
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:29,572
Do you know how did I die?
Due to hunger..

780
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,675
Hunger... due to hunger.

781
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:42,576
Mum

782
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:48,700
I loved you more than
I loved my mom

783
01:59:49,101 --> 01:59:51,274
Why did you kill me?

784
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:59,278
Sorry... pardon me my dear.

785
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,673
Do you know 'why did I come'?

786
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:08,200
I will kill your daughter
the way you killed me.

787
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:10,579
And I will kill her mom too.

788
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:16,081
I will kill all people you like

789
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:20,340
You should die by watching all this

790
02:00:21,134 --> 02:00:26,584
Kill you kill... kill
I will kill all...

791
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,978
I will kill all of you.

792
02:00:33,401 --> 02:00:37,281
Its the spirit of a child whose
childishness was not gone

793
02:00:38,101 --> 02:00:42,277
We cant stop her with prayer or
scare her with divine stick

794
02:00:43,101 --> 02:00:44,671
Swami lost his guts.

795
02:00:44,734 --> 02:00:47,681
Lost love is the revenge of that child.

796
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,133
Only a person who has blood
relation with her can control her.

797
02:00:53,134 --> 02:00:56,115
So, we need to find the
blood group of ghost.

798
02:00:56,767 --> 02:01:02,012
Her mother should come and control her.
Matahngi..

799
02:01:02,134 --> 02:01:07,033
Mamahngii'? Is this yogi going to conduct
any dance party with all these ghosts'?!

800
02:01:07,034 --> 02:01:09,605
He has a lot of hair,
but, I don't think he knows dance.

801
02:01:11,034 --> 02:01:15,505
Mother... Mother is not alive.

802
02:01:18,034 --> 02:01:19,012
No..

803
02:01:20,634 --> 02:01:23,638
Matangi is still alive..

804
02:01:34,701 --> 02:01:37,682
Only one death has happened here.

805
02:01:38,467 --> 02:01:41,448
Only a single spirit's presence is here

806
02:01:53,367 --> 02:02:00,148
I will tell you the whole direction
Bring her here..

807
02:02:00,367 --> 02:02:06,443
Only Mathangi can save
your daughter's life.

808
02:02:23,367 --> 02:02:27,800
Mathangi should come here even
if you need to face any dangers

809
02:02:27,801 --> 02:02:29,246
Remember..

810
02:02:30,267 --> 02:02:33,441
Now only 30 hours remaining.

811
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:57,712
Hey..

812
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:11,300
You told than, Mathangi and
child had gone from here.

813
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,714
You told me that, you couldn't
find them after searching.

814
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:19,176
You were betraying me, right?
Don't you want to see them?

815
02:03:19,301 --> 02:03:21,178
Do you want to see them?

816
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:26,974
Go... go and watch.
Go and watch.

817
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:47,974
You killed both of them and trying
to escape by blaming me??

818
02:03:48,734 --> 02:03:51,078
Did I tie her knot?

819
02:03:51,301 --> 02:03:53,474
Did I lock the door and
made them to starve?

820
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:56,273
You... you killed them.

821
02:03:57,201 --> 02:04:00,200
Mathangi is the girl who
serve goddess of the clan.

822
02:04:00,201 --> 02:04:04,980
If they come here, they will kill you.
Go... go man..

823
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:14,072
Good..l shall make the
pit for burial, right?

824
02:04:15,201 --> 02:04:17,078
I will kill you..

825
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,176
You never loved her.
lam the guy who loved her.

826
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:28,181
So, its my right to bury her.
Go... go

827
02:05:23,168 --> 02:05:24,772
Where is Matangi?

828
02:05:26,267 --> 02:05:27,769
You killed her, right?

829
02:05:28,601 --> 02:05:31,548
I came after knowing that she is alive

830
02:05:35,568 --> 02:05:37,411
I need to see her.

831
02:05:41,434 --> 02:05:46,577
She is alive because of me.
You cant see her... go

832
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,607
You betrayed me twice.
Tell me, where is Mathangi?

833
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:54,338
Leave him..
Did we come to fight with him?

834
02:06:54,701 --> 02:06:56,681
You did the mistake.

835
02:06:59,067 --> 02:07:03,482
My daughter's life is in danger.
Only Mathangi can save her.

836
02:07:03,701 --> 02:07:07,171
Please show me her.
I am begging..

837
02:07:07,634 --> 02:07:10,171
She is there inside.
She is mad..

838
02:07:18,734 --> 02:07:21,499
You are her madness.
If she see you..

839
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,599
Let she take her revenge.
I am ready to accept that.

840
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:29,050
Go..l am the watchdog of her madness.
With pleasure..

841
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:33,242
You are stopping that also, right???

842
02:09:18,434 --> 02:09:20,641
No one should come to see my child.

843
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:26,733
Nobody should come to
pamper her with love.

844
02:09:26,734 --> 02:09:32,412
My girl is gone She died
due to hunger and thirst.

845
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,380
She was rotten in front of me

846
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,480
Why did you keep me alive?

847
02:09:43,067 --> 02:09:44,671
Why you left me?

848
02:09:46,701 --> 02:09:54,779
My Kaliamman brought you here
I lived for this moment.

849
02:09:56,067 --> 02:09:58,047
And, acted like a mad woman

850
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:04,037
Mathangi, its true that I betrayed you

851
02:10:04,267 --> 02:10:07,441
But, I changed my mind
and came back for you

852
02:10:08,401 --> 02:10:09,675
No..

853
02:10:11,401 --> 02:10:14,382
Who are you'?!
I am his wife..

854
02:10:15,401 --> 02:10:21,477
Wife. She betrayed me in the first night.
And you??

855
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,778
He wont do anything for free.

856
02:10:25,501 --> 02:10:29,244
He earned by betraying me.
HE earned by killing my child.

857
02:10:30,067 --> 02:10:31,774
Now, why did you come?

858
02:10:32,167 --> 02:10:36,138
Mathangi, I know there is no
excuse for what happened?

859
02:10:36,701 --> 02:10:39,978
I came for begging you.

860
02:10:40,201 --> 02:10:43,410
Only you could save my daughter'.

861
02:10:44,667 --> 02:10:48,444
Mathang's daughter's spirit
is there in her body.

862
02:11:06,234 --> 02:11:10,341
If you see me as an enemy, you wont come.
But, consider me as a mother.

863
02:11:11,134 --> 02:11:15,549
You are like a god to me.
Please save my daughter:

864
02:12:37,567 --> 02:12:41,538
I was sure that you would come
You belong to a family which did sacrifices

865
02:12:41,768 --> 02:12:45,648
Only you could be able to calm
down your daughter's spirit.

866
02:12:46,567 --> 02:12:47,739
Come..

867
02:12:57,267 --> 02:12:58,746
Hey..

868
02:13:02,268 --> 02:13:07,650
Forest men and women can die,
die and decay"

869
02:13:09,101 --> 02:13:11,240
No one will be hurt.

870
02:13:13,734 --> 02:13:19,514
By defeating my daughter's spirit,
I should save them, right?

871
02:13:21,634 --> 02:13:25,980
So, what is the punishment for
the one who betrayed?

872
02:13:26,434 --> 02:13:30,075
What is the penalty for the murderer?
Tell me..

873
02:13:44,234 --> 02:13:48,614
I came to see him to be punished

874
02:14:13,634 --> 02:14:18,083
Mathangi is more dangerous than
the spirit of Malli.

875
02:14:38,634 --> 02:14:44,209
Mathangi, Sempakam is not the woman who
took the life. Instead, she gave the life.

876
02:14:44,634 --> 02:14:47,979
Mother gave her life to protect
the one who married her,

877
02:14:48,434 --> 02:14:51,313
not to save someone who
betrayed her by marrying

878
02:14:56,534 --> 02:15:00,539
'Kill for kill' is the
justice for Vedar clan

879
02:15:02,767 --> 02:15:09,685
Like my daughter, your child should die.
Die and decay"

880
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:20,779
Before that, if you destroy the spirit,
I will do it with my hands

881
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,673
Malli..

882
02:16:41,501 --> 02:16:45,574
You need this child's life, right?

883
02:16:48,601 --> 02:16:51,400
You know the pain of pregnancy.
You are a mother.

884
02:16:51,401 --> 02:16:53,176
Do you need to kill her?

885
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:59,278
Everybody waits for the sympathy of
a mother named Mathangi.

886
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:02,700
Your daughter's spirit doesn't
deserve to be wandered

887
02:17:02,701 --> 02:17:04,299
She should reach heaven

888
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:08,077
Her bones are kept near
homakundam (ritualistic fire)

889
02:17:09,301 --> 02:17:13,181
you have to shift it to the fire
with your hands

890
02:17:14,801 --> 02:17:17,782
Malli will get moksha only after that.

891
02:17:18,601 --> 02:17:23,675
If you wish to kill her again,
then take this"

892
02:18:06,334 --> 02:18:09,333
You know the pain of pregnancy.
You are a mother.

893
02:18:09,334 --> 02:18:11,733
Your daughter's spirit doesn't
deserve to be wandered

894
02:18:11,734 --> 02:18:13,304
She should reach heaven

895
02:18:13,534 --> 02:18:19,610
Your goddess Sempakam is not the woman who
took the life. Instead, she gave the life.

896
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:32,413
Kill mother. Kill all of them.

919
02:21:56,267 --> 02:21:57,439
Honey...

920
02:21:59,167 --> 02:22:00,441
Mathangi.

921
02:22:58,167 --> 02:22:59,669
Swami...

922
02:23:01,067 --> 02:23:02,671
Wish you all the success.

923
02:23:04,367 --> 02:23:12,149
Your family is the sacrifice of a mother.
There is no god greater than mother.
