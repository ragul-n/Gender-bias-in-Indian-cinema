1
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:04,339
Mom, dad.

2
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:06,881
Why do I keep getting the same dream
over and over again?

3
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:09,506
It's been haunting me for years now.

4
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,964
I don't understand.

5
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:39,756
What are you saying, man?
We're going to make money off a barber?

6
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,923
No, no, bro.

7
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:43,006
Harry is London's
Mr Forgetful.

8
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,839
- Mr Forgetful.
- Whenever he hears a loud sound...

9
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,339
Like bang, thud, bam.

10
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,631
It puts pressure
on the vein in his ear.

11
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:52,881
And he forgets everything for a minute.

12
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,214
Come, come, let's have some fun.

13
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:56,089
What's up, Harry?

14
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,631
Give him a makeover, will you.

15
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,714
Woah...

16
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:04,798
Ugly, isn't it

17
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,173
Come... Come... Come... Come.

18
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:14,339
Where's the spray?

19
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,881
Why are you spitting?!

20
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:20,381
Are you crazy, use the spray.

21
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:22,964
Thank you.

22
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,798
- Yes.
- Nice one, man.

23
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,548
- How much, Harry?
- 5 pounds.

24
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:47,006
But Harry, I've only got 20.

25
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,881
- I'll give you change.
- Here.

26
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,923
- Here.
- Thank you.

27
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:08,964
Yes?

28
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,923
I gave you 20 pounds.

29
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:11,923
You owe me 15 back.

30
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:13,423
- You gave me 20 pounds?
- Yeah...

31
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,214
- So I have to give you 15 pounds back.
- Yeah.

32
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:18,964
Thank you.

33
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:28,964
Yes?

34
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:30,089
You owe me 15 pounds.

35
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:31,923
Thank you.

36
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,339
15 pounds...

37
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,173
15 pounds...

38
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,548
Thank you.

39
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:41,964
Thank you. Thank you.

40
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:43,173
- Hey... wait.
- We have enough change now.

41
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,006
Thank you. Thank you.

42
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,339
- See you, Harry.
- Come again.

43
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:50,923
What a loser.

44
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,256
- We're rich, you poor guy! We're rich.
- Yeah...

45
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,798
That absent-minded loser.

46
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:02,506
Today I'm on a fast...

47
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,214
...that's why my punch was slow.

48
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,548
How dare you take advantage
of Harry's condition?

49
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:07,714
Return my brother's money.

50
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,173
Sorry, Max. Sorry.
We'll never do it again.

51
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,631
- Sorry.
- Sorry Bro. Sorry, Max.

52
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,089
Where did my money go?

53
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:13,673
Max...

54
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,964
- Those two boys came in here...
- And took your money.

55
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:17,423
Shit...

56
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,214
Fantastic.

57
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,214
I didn't even realize.

58
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,714
25..35..

59
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,339
Because of your forgetfulness ...

60
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:27,423
...we're already in a lot
of trouble with Big Bhai.

61
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:28,714
When will you learn?

62
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,423
Hey, lower your volume.

63
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:31,339
Look who's talking.

64
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,673
You're going to forget
everything anyway.

65
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:33,923
- Stay in your limits.
- Shut up.

66
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,298
- I'll punch you in the face.
- Hey...

67
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:37,673
Hey...my brothers, Max, Harry.

68
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:39,589
You two are at it again.

69
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:42,006
If you two are going to fight,
and quarrel...

70
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,798
...then I'm going to blow my cool too.

71
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,423
You're doing it again.
Talking like a female.

72
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:47,339
There's no point correcting him.

73
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,756
He forgot to tick the gender box.

74
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,173
It happens.

75
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,756
Correction...shit happens.

76
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:56,923
Correct.

77
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,298
Guys, smile please.

78
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,548
Big Bhai's here.

79
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,589
London is known for two things.

80
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:25,089
Big Ben and Big Bhai.

81
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,256
And now for the real question...

82
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:32,131
Did you guys arrange for Michael
Bhai's 5 million pounds?

83
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,839
Did you?

84
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,006
- We didn't.
- You didn't.

85
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,006
Speak up.

86
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,464
- We asked Yes Bank for a loan.
- Okay.

87
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,089
But Yes Bank said No.

88
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,589
- They said no, dear brother.
- I see...

89
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,589
- That's all...
- That's all...!

90
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,214
Sir, sir, not my pinky...not my pinky.

91
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,548
- That's all isn't it...
- It was a mistake.

92
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:58,339
No son, you're the mistake.

93
00:07:58,423 --> 00:07:59,756
Remember!

94
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,714
The Police are after me.
Take this.

95
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,089
This contains Michael
Bhai's 5 million pounds.

96
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,214
I'll collect it later.

97
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:07,839
Keep it safe.

98
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,548
Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds

99
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:11,673
Keep it safe.

100
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,256
Michael Bhai's 5 million pounds

101
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,256
Keep it safe.

102
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:15,881
Check if the Police
are still out there.

103
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,339
Police!

104
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,631
Michael Bhai's dirty laundry.
Wash it carefully.

105
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,631
I found money in
Michael Bhai's trousers.

106
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,006
Actually,
we've got a plan to pay you back.

107
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,548
- I see...
- Let me explain.

108
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:46,423
But, please take a seat first.

109
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:47,673
- Come, come.
- Fine, fine, I'll sit down.

110
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:50,423
Harry, make Big Bhai
look like a heroine.

111
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,756
- Hero.
- Yeah... Hero.

112
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,256
Hey...

113
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,714
Big Bhai, shall I trim your hair?

114
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,923
No, make them grow longer.
At least this tall.

115
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,756
Please, spare him the sarcasm.
No sarcasm.

116
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,423
What sarcasm?

117
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,589
Do you have any idea how many times
you guys have made...

118
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,714
...my blood boil?

119
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,339
Shave their heads!

120
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,214
- Hey useless?
- Yes brother?

121
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,381
Are you done?

122
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,173
You're ready.

123
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,881
Then show me the mirror.

124
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,006
There's the mirror.

125
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,006
Show me the back.

126
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:54,548
Here you go.

127
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:57,881
Stop spinning me around
and show me the back.

128
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:00,339
Take a good look.

129
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:01,881
Look...

130
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:11,464
Did you actually make
my hair grow longer?

131
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:12,464
Yes, sir.

132
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,423
I used an extension
on the front and back.

133
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,048
Ok..enough of all this.

134
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,464
Let's get back to the point.

135
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,923
What plan have you made to
return Michael Bhai's money?

136
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:23,714
Speak up.

137
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,673
Sir, meet our family planner.

138
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:27,881
Go on, tell him what the plan is.

139
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:29,673
Speak up.

140
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,006
You've heard of London's
tycoon Thakral, right?

141
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,256
We're dating his three daughters.

142
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:36,548
And once we marry them...

143
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,298
...forget 5 million,
we'll pay you 10 million instead.

144
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,423
- 10 million...
- 10 million!

145
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:44,923
Hey Missy...stay in your limits,
understand.

146
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:47,006
- Yes, sir.
- And you come here.

147
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:51,673
Why would those billionaire
girls marry useless people like you?

148
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:54,214
Because we have already
made them fall in love with us..

149
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:56,339
We'll marry them
in a couple of months.

150
00:10:56,631 --> 00:10:58,214
Michael won't give
you more than one day...

151
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,214
...and here you are asking
for a couple of months.

152
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,673
Nonsense.

153
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:03,589
Then what should we do, Big Bhai?

154
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,214
I've got an idea.

155
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,339
Hey missy, listen carefully.

156
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,839
This one's completely original,
a new plan.

157
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:13,131
I...will flirt with the girls.

158
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:18,256
And you will save them.

159
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,756
You call that original?

160
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,214
Of course it's original!

161
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:26,673
Yes, it's original.

162
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:28,298
- Original.
- Original.

163
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,839
Hey, babies.

164
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,839
Beautiful.

165
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:44,173
I wanted to ask you a question.

166
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,423
Do you know what
number Newton invented?

167
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,506
Come on, it's simple.

168
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:49,923
Do you know what
number Newton invented?

169
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:50,881
The kissing number?

170
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:52,089
Yes...

171
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,714
Give me a kiss...

172
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,798
Today is World Kiss day.

173
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,756
So I deserve some kisses.

174
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,839
Come on, babies.
Let's make some babies.

175
00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:04,131
Give me a kiss, ladies...

176
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:08,131
...and Big Bhai's all yours.

177
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,131
You said that they are
very well mannered girls.

178
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,131
Save me from them.

179
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:32,548
Hospital,
ICU, Morgue, take me anywhere.

180
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:33,923
But save me from these girls.

181
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,006
Wait a second.

182
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,423
That means.. you know this guy?

183
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:38,881
I see...

184
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,881
So, this was your plan all along?

185
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:41,923
Why did you do all this?

186
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,256
We wanted to impress
you girls and propose to you.

187
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:46,048
Yes.

188
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,714
And we wanted to ask you a question...

189
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:49,881
What?

190
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:51,006
What number did Newton invent?

191
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,673
You're dead meat.
You're all dead meat.

192
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:56,423
You're all going to get beaten up!
It's going to be very painful.

193
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:57,881
Foolish.

194
00:12:58,381 --> 00:12:59,798
What number did Newton invent?

195
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:00,881
The kissing number!

196
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:02,173
Can we get one kiss...?

197
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:03,714
No way!

198
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:56,048
Idiot.

199
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,923
Oh my God! I got a kiss from the queen!

200
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,214
Guys, please be on your
best behaviour, okay.

201
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:08,214
You should look as civilised,
decent, and cultured as our dad.

202
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:16,214
Beauty. Beauty. Beauty.

203
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:17,506
Papa...

204
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:22,756
Daughter. Daughter. Daughter.

205
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,506
- Papa.
- Come my, darlings.

206
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,214
Papa, these are the boys
that we told you about.

207
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:30,339
Papa, Max and Harry are both born and
brought up in London, this is Max.

208
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,173
- This is Harry.
- And this is Roy.

209
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,756
- Papa, we wanted you to...
- No.

210
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,506
Boys talk only.

211
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:38,798
I've bought new horses for you.

212
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,214
Go and check them out.

213
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:41,923
But papa, can we stay here too...

214
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,714
Like I said. Go.

215
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,714
Okay. Okay.

216
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:46,714
Good luck.

217
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,173
Thank you.

218
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:52,631
So, Mr. Astronaut.

219
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,298
You three should be
ashamed of yourselves.

220
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,423
Horsing around with
girls who are half your age.

221
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:18,048
What's wrong?

222
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,381
Why are all the horses
coming this way?

223
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:21,006
Run! Run!

224
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:35,048
Kriti!

225
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,506
Papa!

226
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:37,548
Roy!

227
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,048
Come quickly!

228
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:24,214
Neha!

229
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:05,131
Thank you.

230
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:11,589
- Kriti.
- Harry.

231
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,589
Kriti. Are you okay?

232
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,048
Harry...

233
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,756
You were jumping from
one horse to another...

234
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,173
How did you do that?

235
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,381
Actually, I was...

236
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:24,589
I don't know.

237
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,131
My children.

238
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:27,714
Papa.

239
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,089
Are you okay?

240
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,131
Is everything okay?

241
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:30,923
Yeah, papa.

242
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,089
Oh, God.

243
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,214
I will never find more
deserving and able sons-in-law.

244
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,048
Boys, turn on.

245
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:42,464
Papa...

246
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,881
I mean you're on, boys.
You're on.

247
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:48,423
Bring your mother over tomorrow.

248
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:53,968
So this is your mother,
who's amongst the heavens?

249
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,385
Yes.

250
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,302
"Spicy Mumma!"

251
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,302
Look at that bird made out of gold.

252
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,677
Hey...

253
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:07,885
That's so wrong!

254
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:10,812
Return my mother's photo.

255
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,271
- You'll tear it son.
- Give it back.

256
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:13,479
Papa.

257
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,771
Papa.

258
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:16,021
Listen, this is not fair.

259
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,896
- I will talk to him.
- Papa...

260
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:20,396
We've decided that the destination
wedding will be in Italy.

261
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,146
- When did we decide Italy?
- I think it should be Ibiza.

262
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,229
I said Vegas!

263
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,146
We go Vegas every year!

264
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,354
Oh no, not again.

265
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,062
One minute. One minute. One minute.

266
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,812
Listen to your father first.

267
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,330
Please continue.

268
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:38,372
As always, our ancestral
globe will decide the destination.

269
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,580
I will spin it.

270
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,080
Wait a minute.

271
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,080
Who owns this globe?

272
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,663
Your father,
So he will spin it.

273
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,247
- Father, spin your globe...
- Okay.

274
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:51,288
- Ready.
- Here we go.

275
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,538
Sitamgarh?!

276
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:01,997
What the hell is Sitamgarh?

277
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:03,497
Sitamgarh sounds so boring.

278
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,205
- I'm spinning it again.
- Come on.

279
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,622
Vegas. Vegas. Vegas.

280
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:09,038
Come on, Ibiza.

281
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,330
- Sitamgarh? Again?
- What the hell.

282
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,913
- Sitamgarh, Again?
- What's going on?

283
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:15,788
Wait. Wait. Wait. Vegas.

284
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:16,747
I'll move it to Vegas.

285
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,288
- Vegas.
- Vegas.

286
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,913
Sitamgarh.

287
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,122
Does anyone even
know where Sitamgarh is?

288
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,622
I don't know.

289
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,247
Behind the 3rd mountain
of the Ujjain mountain ranges...

290
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,080
...situated on the banks
of the Brahma Sagar river.

291
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,788
Is a Kingdom,
filled with history

292
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,788
Our Sitamgarh.

293
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:53,705
Sitamgarh.

294
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,205
Harry.

295
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:59,163
How do you know?

296
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,872
Yeah, Harry. How do you know?

297
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:04,955
I don't know.

298
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,330
Actually,
on second thoughts, it can be fun.

299
00:22:07,455 --> 00:22:09,413
I mean everyone goes
to Italy and Ibiza.

300
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,663
This can be adventurous.

301
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:11,705
- What say?
- Yeah.

302
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,163
So a traditional Indian wedding.

303
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,372
Exactly.

304
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,580
Ok fine, if it's Sitamgarh,
then so be it.

305
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,580
Papa, our wedding
will be in Sitamgarh.

306
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,205
Congratulations!

307
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,080
Baby, look at those peacocks!

308
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,413
I'm so glad you shaved your beard.

309
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:56,455
Why did you do it?

310
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,413
I was looking elder than your father,
that's why.

311
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:44,622
YUCK!

312
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:49,997
A pigeon's yuck brings good luck

313
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,413
Come let's go

314
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:55,872
Welcome to Hotel Sitamgarh Palace.

315
00:23:56,247 --> 00:24:01,330
Myself Winston Churchgate
via Mumbai via London branch.

316
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:03,080
The new damager.

317
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,747
Pardon. The new manager
of this magnanimous,

318
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:09,705
monumental,
majestic, masterpiece palace.

319
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:11,288
Bell boy.

320
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,122
Mamma Mia...I've told you
so many times.

321
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:17,122
Sticks and stones don't break my bones
but carrying this load's a disaster.

322
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,455
I'm joking.

323
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:20,080
Luggage.

324
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,997
King...Surya Singh Rana!

325
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,705
- What?
- You are the king of this kingdom!

326
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:33,872
This is your kingdom!
You're the king!

327
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,580
The emperor.
The Badshah.

328
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:39,038
If I am Badshah,
who are you Honey Singh?

329
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:40,455
Mamma Mia...

330
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,955
The King of classical dance,
Master Bangdu.

331
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:46,830
This is your reincarnation.

332
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,372
You're right,
I was born in this nation.

333
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:52,163
No, reincarnation!

334
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:53,997
Re... What?

335
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,247
The great bodyguard Dharamputra!

336
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,205
Aakhri Pasta.

337
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,455
Oh my God!!
He recognises me.

338
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:04,955
- Idiot.
- It's on your name tag.

339
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,872
Prince Bala Dev Singh!

340
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,038
My lord, my benefactor.

341
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,538
And you even have hair on your head now!

342
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:21,747
Take me under your refuge.
I beg you.

343
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,872
- Hey, come here.
- This guy is crazy..

344
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:26,622
- You're standing on my hand!
- Sorry. Sorry.

345
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,205
Where are you taking me?

346
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,205
Let go of me!

347
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,413
I am not joking.

348
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,247
- Everybody is reborn!!
- He keeps talking rubbish.

349
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:36,080
He has some mental problem.

350
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:37,330
Sorry, sir. Please come.

351
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:39,288
Please follow me.
Please.

352
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:30,872
"Until I don't behead every member
of Sitamgarh's Royal family"

353
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:35,497
"Time will change,
and so will the Ruler"

354
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,913
The black mountain tribe?!

355
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,622
Pasta was right.

356
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:19,247
Winston!

357
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,788
Mr. Winston.
Mr. Winston. Mr. Winston.

358
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:24,538
I want Pasta.

359
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,080
Most certainly.

360
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,955
With red sauce or white sauce?

361
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:29,955
No, not that pasta.

362
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:32,497
The guy who works for you.
Your bellboy.

363
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:33,705
Where can I find him?

364
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:37,122
He behaved atrociously
in front of you dignitaries.

365
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,372
- So I fired him.
- Fired him?

366
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,205
- But where can I find him?
- Madhavgarh.

367
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:44,247
Quite far from here.

368
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,122
Can I borrow the hotel vehicle?

369
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:50,122
Sure, sure... 1200 rupees per hour.

370
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,122
Put it on my account.

371
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:55,372
Account? How desi.

372
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,372
Account.

373
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:05,163
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

374
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,964
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

375
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,111
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

376
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:14,028
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

377
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:17,153
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

378
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,528
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

379
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:23,195
- Long live...
- King Parikshitaap...

380
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,234
Let the proceedings begin.

381
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:35,734
Some of the local
businessmen have a complaint.

382
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,609
- Complaint?
- Yes.

383
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:44,693
- What did my son do this time?
- Your Highness, my 5-year-old son...

384
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:52,359
...giggled at the sight
of Prince Bala Dev Singh's bald head.

385
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:54,901
And that made Prince Bala Dev furious.

386
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,193
Shave their heads!

387
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,401
Why did he do this, Your Highness?

388
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:09,526
When Prince Bala was born,

389
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:11,901
he had a lot of hair on his head...

390
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,109
...which is why I named him Bala.

391
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:17,818
But at the age of 2, after
the royal head shaving ceremony...

392
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,568
...his hair never grew back.

393
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:21,818
Damn.

394
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:25,068
He's been bald ever since.
Unfortunately.

395
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:26,276
Take a look, Your Highness.

396
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:28,276
He didn't even spare
my 5-year-old kid.

397
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,401
He shaved his hair too.

398
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,734
Bala!

399
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,943
Have mercy on me, son.
I'll feed you porridge.

400
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:32,359
Feed me porridge?
First, I'll feed you this arrow.

401
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:33,401
Bala!

402
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:37,068
Put it down.

403
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:38,484
I said put it down.

404
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,276
Put it down.

405
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,193
Such cruelty against my subjects.

406
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:49,401
If I hear another
complaint against you...

407
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,984
...then I will banish
you from this kingdom.

408
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,068
Forgive me, father. Forgive me.

409
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,068
I lost my mother
when I was very young...

410
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,026
...and after the royal ceremony,
I lost all my hair forever.

411
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,401
I beg for your forgiveness.

412
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,193
Please forgive me.

413
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,568
Okay don't worry, son. Get up.

414
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:12,693
I just saw them!

415
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:14,443
Where are you entering?!

416
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:15,651
In front of everyone?!

417
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:16,984
Please forgive me.

418
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:19,693
Come here.

419
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,318
My good son.

420
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:31,484
Son...love your subjects,
and they will love you back.

421
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,568
After all you'll be the king after me.

422
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:35,359
When?

423
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:38,651
I am just joking.

424
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,734
My funny son.

425
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,693
Very nice, son.

426
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,068
I knew my son would reform some day.

427
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,193
And today you have.

428
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:54,776
Bravo.

429
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,109
Come son, it's time for supper!

430
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:58,568
After you, father.

431
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:00,776
My noble son.

432
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,651
You want to murder your own father?!

433
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:37,443
You're banished!

434
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,443
"Finally you get
what you deserved."

435
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:59,901
"Every body's abusing you."

436
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:04,401
"We're going to celebrate."

437
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:08,734
"Bring something to eat."

438
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:13,276
"Finally you get what you deserved."

439
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:17,734
"Everybody's abusing you."

440
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:22,193
"We're going to celebrate."

441
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:27,068
"Bring something to eat."

442
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:46,609
Prince Bala has been washed
down the royal drain.

443
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:51,151
He lost the kingdom,
the throne, everything

444
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:54,151
Disperse. Disperse. Disperse.

445
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:55,734
Curse you!

446
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:58,859
- What's that in your hand?
- It's a royal invitation.

447
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:02,734
From the King of Sitamgarh,
Surya Singh Rana.

448
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:05,484
On the occasion of his birthday...

449
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:09,901
...there will be a grand celebration in
his kingdom for the next seven days.

450
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:15,359
And this invitation accidentally fell
into the hands of your servant Pasta.

451
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:16,776
- Pasta.
- Yes?

452
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,901
This isn't just an invitation,
it's a weapon...

453
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:21,276
A weapon which I can use
against my father for revenge.

454
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,734
I've heard that King
Surya Singh Rana doesn't have a son.

455
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,734
He has three daughters.

456
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,401
Madhu, Mala, Meena.

457
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:31,068
- Who is the eldest one?
- Madhu.

458
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:36,443
And if I marry his
eldest daughter, Princess Madhu...

459
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:40,026
...then I will take over the
kingdom of Sitamgarh and finish...

460
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:43,359
...my father and his subjects.

461
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:46,026
Mamma Mia...but how will you go there?

462
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:50,651
Many King's and Prince's will be
bringing gifts for the king.

463
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,068
What will you take for him?

464
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,068
You're a pauper,
down-trodden, penniless, beggar...

465
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,776
Oh shit!

466
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:59,693
I stepped in shit!

467
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,068
Shit...

468
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:08,901
Shit...

469
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:36,786
Today, on the occasion of King
Surya Singh Rana's birthday...

470
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:42,702
Princess Mala,
Princess Madhu, and Princess Meena...

471
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:46,952
...have organised this celebration.

472
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,911
Arriving first, the king of Turkey...

473
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:55,077
...Mehmood Bin Maktum.

474
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:21,327
The king has brought
One million gold coins...

475
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:26,827
...and these two swords
studded with precious gems.

476
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:33,994
And now, arriving from
the kingdom of Madhavgarh...

477
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:37,786
...Prince Bala Dev Singh.

478
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,702
Greetings and pleasantries.

479
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:17,036
Princess Madhu.

480
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:22,452
Is she Princess Madhu or morning dew?

481
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:30,369
What is the meaning of this,
Prince Bala.

482
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:36,661
Why did you arrive in the kingdom of Sitamgarh
sitting in this squeaky wheel-barrow?

483
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:41,119
Your Highness, on the way I came
across an old lady who couldn't walk.

484
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:47,327
And I didn't waste a minute to send that 82
-year-old lady home on my royal chariot...

485
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:52,161
...and I came here on
this broken wheel barrow.

486
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,369
Because my father used to say...

487
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:58,202
"Do your duty,
and you shall be rewarded."

488
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,244
- Your Highness-
- But Prince Bala...

489
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:06,244
...today is my uncle,
our king's birthday.

490
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:10,702
Didn't you bring him a gift
on this grand occasion?

491
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:16,036
Your Highness, I could've brought
you horses and elephants, or...

492
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:19,536
Elephants and horses.

493
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:22,327
Gold and silver coins, or...

494
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:25,952
Silver and gold coins.

495
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:29,119
But these are just illusions
Your Highness.

496
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:33,827
Prince Bala has brought a gift
far more valuable for you.

497
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:35,369
And that gift is...

498
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:40,786
This piece of shit...

499
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,661
I mean soil, your honour.

500
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:46,661
A piece of Madhavgarh's soil.
Blessed by our ancestors.

501
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,119
This makes a man stay
young for a long time.

502
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:51,369
Makes him healthy and vigorous.

503
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:54,286
In fact, this gift isn't
for you Your Highness...

504
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,702
...It's for your 120 queens.

505
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,369
Really?
Bring it to me, quickly!

506
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:01,702
For the sake of the queens.

507
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:07,036
It contains Shilajit, Makradwaj, Kayakalp,
and Chavanprash, Your Highness.

508
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:08,786
Open sesame...

509
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:10,827
No, no, no...

510
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:15,452
Suryabhan...

511
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:20,661
Distribute the rest of the gifts
amongst my subjects.

512
00:41:20,702 --> 00:41:22,994
- Long live...
- The king...

513
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:25,619
- Long live...
- The king...

514
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,327
- Long live...
- The king...

515
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,786
Every year, on the King's birthday...

516
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:33,661
...you torture yourself this way.

517
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,786
What madness is this, sire?

518
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:41,036
This isn't madness,
This is my punishment.

519
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:44,202
This punishment reminds me...

520
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:47,661
...that another year has passed...

521
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:52,869
...and I still haven't
become the King of Sitamgarh.

522
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:58,286
But now...time is going to change.

523
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:02,077
And so will the ruler.

524
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:04,077
But how?

525
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:14,702
Everything may be fair
in love and war...

526
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:20,244
But victory comes
to the conspirators.

527
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:21,827
There will be an attack!

528
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:26,744
...and people will blame
the oldest enemy of this kingdom.

529
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:32,369
The chief of the Khookha Tribe, Gama.

530
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:41,619
I'll make a royal dance
chamber here, Pasta.

531
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:43,911
And this is where I'll
shoot arrows at poor people.

532
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,411
Mamma Mia...before you start dreaming
of making a torture chamber...

533
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:48,244
- ...you must win Princess Madhu's heart.
- Hurry up, hurry up!

534
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:50,202
- Master has begun dancing.
- Oh yes!

535
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:53,411
- Master has begun dancing?
- Dance!

536
00:42:53,494 --> 00:42:56,161
Let's go and see
what's happening here?

537
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,827
"I am a guy..."

538
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,536
"I am a guy..."

539
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:08,536
"I am a guy that loves a guy."

540
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:17,702
"Yes, I love a guy..."

541
00:43:18,077 --> 00:43:20,577
"Waiting for a dashing handsome guy.'

542
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,286
"That sweeps me off my feet."

543
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,077
Master Bangdu!

544
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:27,744
Bangdu?

545
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:31,702
"I'll wound him with my sight."

546
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,327
Oh God.

547
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,327
I am exhausted.

548
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:46,494
Amazing, Master Bangdu.
How are you so talented?

549
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,577
Yes, who is your teacher?

550
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:50,077
My teacher?

551
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:52,244
Govinda and Pradbhudeva.

552
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,786
- Govinda and Pradbhudeva?
- Yes.

553
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:59,161
The almighty Lord Govinda...
He's my teacher, and my Lord.

554
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:02,411
But Almighty, I am so tired now.

555
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:05,702
Silly girls,
less giggling and more dancing!

556
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:06,661
Yes, teacher.

557
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:10,661
Don't you want my blessings?

558
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:12,036
Forgive us, teacher.

559
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:14,869
God bless you.

560
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:16,869
God bless you.

561
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,452
You can come a little closer!

562
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,452
"Let me go..."

563
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,786
"Why, are you in a hurry..."

564
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,161
"My heart skips a beat..."

565
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,286
"Why is that?"

566
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:28,619
Oh wow

567
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:31,952
These words should
be composed in a song.

568
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,161
Let me go.

569
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:35,952
How can I let you go?

570
00:44:36,036 --> 00:44:38,744
Someone might see us, teacher.

571
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:43,036
Who would see us here?

572
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:49,827
Prince Bala!

573
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,452
Prince Bala!

574
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:56,161
Bangdu. How did you escape?

575
00:44:56,244 --> 00:45:00,577
6-months-ago, when I was
teaching dance in your kingdom...

576
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:01,786
What is going on here?

577
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:03,202
What are you doing?

578
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:04,161
You can't just come in here like that.

579
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:06,911
Master Bangdu.
Stop this singing and dancing.

580
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:10,536
Prince Bala's regular
dancers didn't show up today.

581
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:14,744
So he said to get some girls
from here. Come on. Go get the girls.

582
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:20,077
Bloody Pasta, let's see
who lays a finger on my girls.

583
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:33,452
Prince. Prince. I beg you...please...

584
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,494
Prince, this is a temple of knowledge!

585
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,327
Temple of knowledge, huh?

586
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:39,286
Yes.

587
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:42,494
- I want some knowledge!
- What?

588
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,452
- No, no, don't take her.
- Leave me.

589
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:48,202
- Leave me.
- What is this cruelty, Prince?

590
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:51,911
These children built this
with sheer dedication and effort.

591
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:54,619
I will show them dedication
and effort!

592
00:45:54,702 --> 00:45:57,202
- Please my prince, let them go.
- No, no.

593
00:45:58,327 --> 00:45:59,577
I want all of these qualities too!

594
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:02,327
They would've never imagined this
in their wildest dreams.

595
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:04,036
I will be their wildest dream!

596
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,536
No, no,
Leave me. Leave me...

597
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:08,786
Give them freedom, Prince.

598
00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:10,494
Get that man as well!

599
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:12,994
Go on boys, grab him too.

600
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,869
Prince Bala, think about me too!

601
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,202
No, not like that!

602
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:25,286
Prince, maybe you don't remember...

603
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:28,619
...but first you gave orders to
execute your royal executioner.

604
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,452
When he heard about these orders,
he ran away.

605
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,952
And when there was no one
to execute us, then how would we die.

606
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:35,911
So we all ran away.

607
00:46:36,286 --> 00:46:39,494
You mean till date,
I have never killed anyone?

608
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:40,869
No.

609
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:43,994
I don't have any innocent's
blood on my hands?

610
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:46,077
Disaster.

611
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:49,286
My life feels worthless.

612
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,036
But Prince,
what brings you to Sitamgarh?

613
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:57,452
I want to marry Princess Madhu.

614
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:00,786
You and marriage?

615
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:04,661
Of course, of course...

616
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:06,036
Amazing.

617
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:07,661
I'll take your leave.

618
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:09,286
Go, you may leave.

619
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:10,202
Goodbye.

620
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,202
Long live the Prince.

621
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:14,411
And I'll go and tell the king,

622
00:47:14,577 --> 00:47:17,744
That you may be half
man half woman for others...

623
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:23,077
...but a naughty
boy for Princess Mala.

624
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:26,369
Devil's Double, Prince Bala.

625
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:27,952
I will help you.

626
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:29,036
Correction...I am on your side.

627
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:31,577
You will tell me everything...

628
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:32,744
...about Princess Madhu.

629
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:37,411
So that in a week's time I can
coochie-coo with the princess.

630
00:47:40,577 --> 00:47:43,619
Hug her, and kiss her...

631
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,327
- Fall in mad love.
- Impossible.

632
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:47,286
Why is it impossible?

633
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:50,161
Because her bodyguard
never lets anyone near her.

634
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:52,286
I've dealt with many
bodyguard's like that before.

635
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,536
He's no ordinary bodyguard.

636
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:57,827
He's the royal guard of Sitamgarh.

637
00:48:01,202 --> 00:48:04,286
He's the mightiest of the mightiest.

638
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:14,827
The Royal bodyguard... Dharamputra.

639
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,661
Wow Dharamputra,
Wonderful.

640
00:48:21,952 --> 00:48:24,327
"Brave heart..."
"Strong as a mountain..."

641
00:48:24,577 --> 00:48:25,577
"Fearless..."

642
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:28,952
Meena, these words should
be composed into a song.

643
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:34,036
Remember Princesses, you must
have a firm grip on your sword.

644
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,786
Like this?

645
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:41,577
Because a weak grip,
is the sign of a weak heart.

646
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,702
Yes.

647
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,411
Absolutely right, Dharamputra.

648
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,161
Brilliant, Prince Bala.

649
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,827
I'm guessing your sword
skills are quite impressive too.

650
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,911
My father used to say...

651
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:56,161
"Knowledge...must always be shared!"

652
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:00,494
Then why don't you share
your knowledge with us as well.

653
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:02,494
We would like to
see your sword skills too.

654
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:06,202
Pardon me,
but I don't fight with women.

655
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:11,619
I was talking about having a duel with
our bodyguard Dharamputra.

656
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:18,702
We're dead meat.

657
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:28,994
I'm not carrying my royal sword.

658
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:31,202
We are.

659
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,369
Where is it?

660
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:45,452
What else are you
hiding down in the cellar?

661
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:47,619
May victory be yours.

662
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,744
Side, please.

663
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:00,286
Attack!

664
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:05,827
The sword broke.

665
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:07,619
Let's all go home.

666
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:09,202
We still have this.

667
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:10,202
Here you go.

668
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:11,202
Fight.

669
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:14,369
Thank you.

670
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:19,369
Attack!

671
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:24,286
The bodyguard swings his sword,
but Prince Bala ducks.

672
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,702
Now Prince Bala attacks
with all his might.

673
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:28,244
Prince Bala seems to be winning.

674
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:29,911
Prince Bala seems to be winning.

675
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,577
But Dharamputra pushes him.

676
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,619
And the Prince falls
in the Princess' arms.

677
00:50:34,286 --> 00:50:35,827
What happened now, Prince Bala?

678
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,327
Nothing.

679
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,411
Just an excuse to get close to you.

680
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,327
- What?
- Yes, my dear.

681
00:51:10,702 --> 00:51:12,369
- Bangdu.
- Yes, my prince?

682
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:14,577
He is very strong.

683
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:16,744
Doesn't he have any weaknesses?

684
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,202
He doesn't have any weaknesses.

685
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:23,869
But, he's someone's weakness.

686
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:25,786
Who's?

687
00:51:26,952 --> 00:51:28,661
Princess Meena.

688
00:51:29,244 --> 00:51:33,911
We must get
Princess Meena on our side.

689
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:52,327
Princess.

690
00:51:52,702 --> 00:51:55,494
What am I doing here?
And why are you in this condition?

691
00:51:56,244 --> 00:51:59,077
I am ruined. I am finished.

692
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,161
Stay away from me.

693
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:02,911
You're a monster, not a protector.

694
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,077
- Stay away from me.
- What did I do?

695
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:08,202
What did you do?

696
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:15,577
Like an animal,
all night after drinking, you kept...

697
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,952
I kept screaming and yelling...

698
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,286
that I am a helpless woman,
not some object!

699
00:52:28,286 --> 00:52:29,911
I will kill myself.

700
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:33,286
I am a monster, not a protector.

701
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:35,536
I've got no right to live.

702
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:36,369
Huh?!

703
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,202
I've got no right to live!

704
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:39,786
I've got no right to live!

705
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:40,494
Dharam!

706
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,744
Dharamputra!

707
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,286
No...

708
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:49,744
If you kill yourself, then you'll
be taking two more lives with you.

709
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:51,036
- Two more?
- Yes.

710
00:52:52,286 --> 00:52:58,619
Princess Meena and
your child in her womb.

711
00:52:58,744 --> 00:52:59,786
Mamma Mia...

712
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:02,411
The Royal protector
forgot his own protection.

713
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:05,286
No, no, don't blame him...

714
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:06,202
He's just a...

715
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,952
"Soldier, Soldier..."

716
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:09,827
"Who with his sweet talks..."

717
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:11,536
"...stole my heart."

718
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:14,286
These words should
be composed in a song.

719
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:18,577
Princess,
even if I accept this relationship...

720
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:20,536
...the King will never
give his approval.

721
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:21,619
He will.

722
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:23,786
Of course he will.

723
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:25,536
But in order to get his approval

724
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:30,744
You all must help
me marry Princess Madhu!

725
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:37,452
She's here. She's here.

726
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:41,036
Where is Master Bangdu?

727
00:53:41,744 --> 00:53:44,369
Meena? Mala?

728
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:46,619
Where is everyone?

729
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:51,494
Save me!

730
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:52,952
Dharamputra. Dharamputra.

731
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:54,036
No, listen.

732
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:54,827
Help!

733
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:57,911
That's your duty,
but this is your responsibility.

734
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:08,244
Princess. Don't move.

735
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:09,911
Don't move.

736
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,619
He's poisonous.

737
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:15,286
If he bites you,
then you will die.

738
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:18,327
No. Don't look into the spider's eyes.

739
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:20,286
Look into my eyes.

740
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:24,869
May I keep my hand on your shoulder?

741
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:29,327
Look at me.

742
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:34,869
Are you flirting with me?

743
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:39,452
I'm not flirting with you, I'm just
speaking in the spider's language.

744
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:40,827
C'mon, smarten up.

745
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:42,286
Okay.

746
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,911
From which mouth do I thank you?

747
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:00,869
Do it from this mouth.

748
00:55:01,244 --> 00:55:03,744
God's made such a beautiful mouth.

749
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:06,327
Don't be shy.

750
00:55:06,702 --> 00:55:08,244
You saved my life.

751
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:09,869
No..

752
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:14,786
I saved my life.

753
00:55:16,077 --> 00:55:17,077
Madhu.

754
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:18,494
Bala.

755
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:20,994
- Madhu.
- Bala.

756
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,244
Madhu.

757
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:24,369
Bala.

758
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,911
Where did this come from?

759
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:20,411
Bloody fools.

760
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:28,511
The reason for inviting all of you
here wasn't just for my birthday...

761
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:30,427
...in fact, I had a different agenda.

762
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:31,802
Suryabhan.

763
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,261
Tomorrow, on the final
day of the festivities...

764
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:39,094
All three Princesses
will choose their groom.

765
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:47,022
As the tradition follows...

766
00:58:47,302 --> 00:58:50,844
...the Princesses will
set the royal birds free.

767
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:56,594
And whoever the royal birds
sit on will be their groom.

768
00:58:57,302 --> 00:58:59,511
And now for the most
important point...

769
00:59:00,177 --> 00:59:03,011
The groom chosen for Princess Madhu

770
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:06,969
will be inaugurated as
the new King of this kingdom.

771
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,511
- Long live...
- The king!

772
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:11,802
- Long live...
- The king!

773
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:14,136
- Long live...
- The king!

774
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,719
- Long live...
- The king!

775
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,802
Disperse.

776
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,594
Curse you!

777
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:21,511
You're getting me wrong, son.

778
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:24,302
I said disperse.
Meaning leave.

779
00:59:44,177 --> 00:59:47,511
Let the ceremony begin.

780
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:23,677
Baldy.

781
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:31,344
Princess Madhu's future groom
and the new King of Sitamgarh...

782
01:00:31,552 --> 01:00:34,367
- Glory to...
- Prince Bala Dev Singh.

783
01:00:34,802 --> 01:00:36,594
Mala, Meena...

784
01:00:57,802 --> 01:00:58,927
Impossible!

785
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:00,511
This cannot happen!

786
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:02,052
He's not even Royal blood.

787
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:06,386
Forget that Suryabhan,
look over there.

788
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:07,761
What's happening there.

789
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:12,094
Forget about Royal blood.

790
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:13,802
He's not even a man.

791
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:16,052
Your Highness,

792
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:21,011
Bangdu is a man.

793
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,594
I've checked him myself.

794
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:32,431
Prince Bala,
now you're the new King of Sitamgarh.

795
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:35,844
Therefore, your orders are my command.

796
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,469
Suryabhan,
why are you going into Gama's cave?

797
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:57,677
Going there is like inviting death.

798
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,052
I am inviting death.

799
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:10,677
But not my death....

800
01:02:25,927 --> 01:02:26,802
What do you mean?

801
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:33,427
I mean Gama is my last ticket
to the throne of Sitamgarh.

802
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:59,761
Suryabhan, what brings you here?

803
01:03:00,467 --> 01:03:06,219
Till date, our personal enmity has
lead to the deaths of many innocents.

804
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:08,927
And in order to finish this enmity...

805
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:12,844
...the King has sent you an invitation
to the wedding of his princesses

806
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:15,511
He has taken the first step
to create peace and friendship.

807
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,511
Brother, we should go there
in order to finish this enmity.

808
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:45,761
I am a wild dog.

809
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:50,511
I am as dangerous as I am loyal.

810
01:03:51,682 --> 01:03:56,802
I can sniff out the
traitor from the loyalists.

811
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:02,844
If I ever see you here again,
I'll eat you alive.

812
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:20,386
Things didn't go as you had planned,
but at least we made it out alive.

813
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:25,386
Who said things didn't go as planned.

814
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:26,511
What do you mean?

815
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:28,844
Look... Gama's brother.

816
01:04:32,386 --> 01:04:33,594
The food's delicious.

817
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:34,802
I love it.

818
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:37,469
- Give me more. Give me more.
- Take some more sauce.

819
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:39,302
- Sauce?
- Yeah...

820
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:41,719
If you can get Pasta in this era,
then why not sauce.

821
01:04:41,802 --> 01:04:43,011
Boss, some sauce?

822
01:04:43,856 --> 01:04:46,335
But Dharamputra, you must admit.

823
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:50,166
God works in mysterious
ways to unite lovers.

824
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:54,386
God doesn't work in mysterious ways,
his highness Bala does.

825
01:04:54,552 --> 01:04:55,427
What?

826
01:04:56,134 --> 01:05:00,121
I switched the royal
birds with my pets...

827
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:04,256
Neil, Nitin and Mukesh.

828
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:05,677
What?

829
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,052
Then where are the royal birds?

830
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:10,261
In our plates.

831
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,072
Disgusting!

832
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,749
Now let's go...

833
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,219
And prepare for the wedding.

834
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:18,302
What about me, boss?

835
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:20,677
You go and play with Giggly

836
01:05:20,757 --> 01:05:22,344
Okay boss.

837
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,386
Mamma Mia.

838
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:27,177
Giggly...

839
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,677
Sauce.

840
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,219
What are you looking at?
This red sign of marriage?

841
01:05:42,427 --> 01:05:45,937
Mirror-Mirror on the wall,
we're husband and wife after all.

842
01:05:46,136 --> 01:05:48,094
Will you tell on me now.

843
01:05:48,302 --> 01:05:50,511
You take a call.

844
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:57,511
Your Majesty,
how are you so sure that he will come?

845
01:05:58,261 --> 01:05:59,719
Look...

846
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:10,344
You should come as a
representative of Khookha Tribe.

847
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:16,136
Once the relationship between us gets
better, then Gama will thank you for it.

848
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:35,177
Gama will kill.

849
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:54,594
Revenge!

850
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:24,724
- Long live...
- Master Bangdu!

851
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:28,765
- Long live...
- His Highness Bala Dev Singh!

852
01:07:29,015 --> 01:07:32,224
- Long live...
- Dharamputra!

853
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,632
- Long live...
- The king!

854
01:07:45,832 --> 01:07:48,432
- Long live...
- The king!

855
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:51,515
- Long live...
- The king!

856
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:15,840
Close the doors!

857
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,145
Quickly.

858
01:08:19,081 --> 01:08:20,444
Close the doors!

859
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,593
Your Highness... Gama!

860
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:58,240
Bala, what are you doing here?

861
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:01,407
- You hide too.
- But you are the king.

862
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:03,073
You should protect your subjects.

863
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:04,365
To hell with the subjects.

864
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:07,073
- I am leaving.
- How can you leave me?

865
01:09:07,365 --> 01:09:09,157
You love me, don't you?

866
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,532
I don't love you.

867
01:09:13,573 --> 01:09:17,823
I did everything so that
I could take over your kingdom.

868
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:21,365
And the pigeon that
sat on me...

869
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,740
...wasn't your royal pigeon,
that was my pet.

870
01:09:26,073 --> 01:09:27,657
I had switched them.

871
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,990
I know.

872
01:09:30,282 --> 01:09:32,948
I saw you switch those pigeons.

873
01:09:34,157 --> 01:09:37,968
But I thought you were doing that
because you didn't want to lose me.

874
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:41,428
I thought you were doing
that for our true love.

875
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:45,198
And I had such blind faith in
my God and my ancestor's blessings...

876
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:47,198
...that I switched
those pigeons again.

877
01:09:48,282 --> 01:09:49,907
Yes, Prince Bala.

878
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,282
The pigeons that sat on
you three were our Royal birds!

879
01:09:55,948 --> 01:09:57,698
So our love was true...

880
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:02,157
...but unfortunately you're
not worthy of that love.

881
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,870
Mala. Meena.

882
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,240
You saved my life.

883
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,490
No.

884
01:11:16,282 --> 01:11:19,532
I saved my life.

885
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:45,198
Dharam!

886
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:31,198
Dharam.

887
01:12:36,532 --> 01:12:38,698
You killed my brother?

888
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:47,648
Until I don't behead every
member of Sitamgarh's royal family...

889
01:12:47,849 --> 01:12:53,240
... my revenge won't be complete!

890
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:01,011
Pasta.

891
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:03,053
I remember everything.

892
01:14:03,136 --> 01:14:04,720
Prince Bala.

893
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:10,222
My poor servant,
your master remembers everything.

894
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:11,886
Oh shit.

895
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:13,338
Oh shit.

896
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,803
What happened, master?

897
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:17,303
This means Kriti belongs to me.

898
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,720
Not Max.

899
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,636
And Neha belongs to Max.

900
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,803
Not Roy.

901
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,345
And Pooja belongs to Roy.

902
01:14:29,435 --> 01:14:30,803
Not me.

903
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:38,178
Meaning, in this life we're
marrying our sisters-in-law?

904
01:14:38,303 --> 01:14:39,386
Oh my, God.

905
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,366
But maybe God made me remember everything
so that we don't commit this sin.

906
01:14:45,969 --> 01:14:50,428
And so that I can make everyone
remember their true love.

907
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:57,698
But we only have 36 hours
to make them remember...

908
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:00,636
- Oh, God.
- God is over there.

909
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:04,094
Lord, I am running out of time.

910
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,928
Please help your devotee
in this testing period.

911
01:15:08,643 --> 01:15:10,157
Give me your blessings, Lord.

912
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:20,167
Ohh...

913
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:20,803
What happened?

914
01:15:20,936 --> 01:15:23,512
Lord, I am running out of time.

915
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:24,972
Please help your devotee.

916
01:15:25,136 --> 01:15:26,095
Give me your blessings, Lord.

917
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:29,511
God isn't deaf.
He heard the first time.

918
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:30,345
Let's go.

919
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:46,095
Oh...

920
01:15:48,696 --> 01:15:51,774
- Lord, I am running out of time.
- God, why are you joking?!

921
01:15:51,902 --> 01:15:56,104
The task of reminding everyone of their
past life has been given to a man...

922
01:15:56,345 --> 01:15:57,803
...who forgets everything
all the time.

923
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,369
Let's go, Prince Bala.
We're running out of time.

924
01:16:20,805 --> 01:16:24,425
Pasta, now I must go
to everyone and remind them...

925
01:16:24,508 --> 01:16:26,383
...that Kriti doesn't belong to Max.

926
01:16:26,466 --> 01:16:28,675
She belongs to me.
Pooja doesn't belong to me.

927
01:16:28,758 --> 01:16:31,258
She belongs to Roy.
And Neha doesn't belong to Roy.

928
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,800
- She belongs to Max.
- Mamma Mia

929
01:16:32,883 --> 01:16:36,966
But Prince Bala,
when will I find Giggly, my lost love.

930
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:38,508
You will...
You will find her soon.

931
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:40,175
Park the car,
we'll find her till then.

932
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:41,425
- Park the car.
- Okay

933
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,677
You saved my life.

934
01:16:52,425 --> 01:16:56,341
No, I didn't save your life.
I saved my life.

935
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,925
- Madhu.
- Bala.

936
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:24,925
- Madhu.
- Bala.

937
01:17:25,591 --> 01:17:27,716
- Madhu.
- Bala.

938
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:29,008
Madhu.

939
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,508
Harry!
How dare you?!

940
01:17:34,069 --> 01:17:35,841
You smashed them to pieces.

941
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:38,008
Bloody creep! You pervert!

942
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:40,883
You're supposed to marry my sister tomorrow
and today you're trying to kiss me.

943
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:42,883
I will...
I will kiss you.

944
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:44,258
- You pervert!
- Baby.

945
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:46,175
We've been reborn.

946
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:49,883
- You don't belong to Max, you belong to me.
- Reborn my foot!

947
01:17:50,054 --> 01:17:51,504
My chest!

948
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:55,550
And not just that,
Pooja doesn't belong to me...

949
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:59,170
- She's that scoundrel Roy's
- You've lost the plot!

950
01:18:00,216 --> 01:18:03,883
And Max belongs to Roy.

951
01:18:04,324 --> 01:18:05,273
Max belongs to Roy?

952
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:06,697
Max belongs to Roy?

953
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:10,201
- You've broken my nose!
- You've gone mad!

954
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,388
Pooja. Sheila.

955
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:13,966
Neha.
Madhu...

956
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,800
- Listen to me!
- Mamma Mia, she's Kriti.

957
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:17,425
Kriti. Kriti.

958
01:18:17,576 --> 01:18:20,258
Go to a doctor and
get some treatment done!

959
01:18:20,591 --> 01:18:22,966
God, why do you always...

960
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,091
Poo poo?

961
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,341
Why do these pigeons only shit on me?

962
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:30,008
Prince Bala, look at the bright side.

963
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:32,050
They are making you
look whiter than white.

964
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:34,216
- What?
- I am joking.

965
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:37,091
I'll go and make my brothers remember.

966
01:18:37,258 --> 01:18:38,591
Where are they?
This way.

967
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,383
I will tell them everything.

968
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:50,758
Pooja. Thank God I found you.

969
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,383
I must tell you
something very important.

970
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:55,258
We're reborn.

971
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,591
Calm down.

972
01:18:58,008 --> 01:19:02,758
Even I have something
important...to show you.

973
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:07,716
No! No! No!

974
01:19:07,796 --> 01:19:09,883
Sister-in-law, please.
Close your curtains.

975
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:11,383
This is wrong.
Absolutely wrong.

976
01:19:11,466 --> 01:19:13,100
Wrong?
Oh, come on.

977
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:13,994
No No!

978
01:19:14,074 --> 01:19:17,341
Pooja, Pooja...Pooja
understand what I'm saying!

979
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:19,216
You're my sister-in-law.
Sister-in-laws are respected.

980
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,341
Give me your blessings.
I am leaving!

981
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:22,841
Harry!

982
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:28,300
It's a sin..I cannot commit this sin!
...It's a grave sin.

983
01:19:28,383 --> 01:19:30,925
Wait..baby

984
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,466
I feel like doing
something behind your back.

985
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,966
Then go ahead, baby.

986
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,383
Do whatever you want

987
01:19:38,258 --> 01:19:39,091
No...

988
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:55,112
Roy!
Harry, yuck...

989
01:19:55,192 --> 01:19:56,577
- Makeup!
-Harry!

990
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:58,466
Who kisses their
sister-in-law's back?

991
01:19:58,546 --> 01:20:02,341
That's exactly what I am saying.
Who kisses their sister-in-law's back?

992
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:04,720
But she is my future wife.

993
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,760
She is not your future wife.

994
01:20:06,906 --> 01:20:09,576
Try to remember.
You love Pooja, remember!

995
01:20:09,656 --> 01:20:10,293
- Huh?
- What?

996
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:11,841
Pooja! Pooja!

997
01:20:12,552 --> 01:20:13,576
- You love Pooja?
- No, no.

998
01:20:13,656 --> 01:20:15,633
My sister Pooja.
You love my sister?

999
01:20:15,716 --> 01:20:17,216
No, no, baby he's lying.

1000
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:19,883
No baby...look at her face.
She is your sister-in-law.

1001
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:22,091
- Leave her.
- What is he saying?

1002
01:20:22,175 --> 01:20:25,425
You shut up! Come outside
I don't know what he's saying

1003
01:20:25,508 --> 01:20:28,550
You will remember too!
You will remember everything!

1004
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:32,258
Come outside! Baby,
there is nothing between me and Pooja!

1005
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:35,216
- Get out! Pooja is my sister!
- Don't do this Roy!

1006
01:20:36,508 --> 01:20:39,216
My sister is having
an affair with my future husband?

1007
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:40,633
Disgusting.

1008
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:42,466
- Listen to me.
- You listen to me!

1009
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:45,050
Wait a second.
Just tell me something.

1010
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:46,970
What have I ever done to deserve this?

1011
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,508
Not now, but in the previous life.
But there is no personal grudge.

1012
01:20:49,675 --> 01:20:51,550
This is a thought
from the previous life.

1013
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:52,970
To hell with your thought.

1014
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,452
Think about Neha.

1015
01:20:54,758 --> 01:20:57,091
Neha keeps thinking about Max herself.

1016
01:20:57,175 --> 01:20:58,050
- Huh...
- What?

1017
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:00,675
They are having an affair.
They are lovers.

1018
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:01,886
When did this happen?

1019
01:21:01,966 --> 01:21:03,300
- One week ago?
- No, no

1020
01:21:03,508 --> 01:21:04,508
- One month ago?
- No!

1021
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:05,841
- One year?
- No, brother!

1022
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:07,175
600 years ago.

1023
01:21:07,633 --> 01:21:09,008
Have you lost your mind?

1024
01:21:09,341 --> 01:21:11,497
- What are you saying?
- Hey...

1025
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:21,816
"I am a guy...that..."

1026
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:25,314
"...loves guys."

1027
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:32,162
"I am a guy, that loves guys."

1028
01:21:33,008 --> 01:21:34,526
You were a dancer!

1029
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:37,928
Your teachers were
Prabhudeva and Govinda!

1030
01:21:38,008 --> 01:21:38,883
Try to remember.

1031
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:40,591
- 600-years-ago...
- Yes yes.

1032
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:43,383
- Govinda and Prabhudeva were my teachers?
- Yes... yes...

1033
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,008
What on earth are you saying?

1034
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,341
What did you just say?

1035
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:48,925
What on earth are you saying?

1036
01:21:49,008 --> 01:21:51,800
This...mixing up genders.

1037
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:53,883
Why do you do it?
Why?

1038
01:21:54,258 --> 01:21:55,591
Because you are a dancer.

1039
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:57,925
- You are a clown.
- And you're a donkey's...

1040
01:21:58,008 --> 01:21:58,966
Hey...

1041
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,008
Oh, Lord. have some mercy on him.

1042
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:11,008
This pigeon did a poo poo
on me in the morning.

1043
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:13,300
And now on you.

1044
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:14,591
Do you know what this means?

1045
01:22:18,341 --> 01:22:19,841
Neil, Nitin, Mukesh..

1046
01:22:20,175 --> 01:22:23,091
These three have been reincarnated.

1047
01:22:23,716 --> 01:22:24,925
- What?
- Yes...

1048
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:27,008
- The pigeons have been reincarnated too?
- Yes...

1049
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:30,091
We three made a meal
out of these three pigeons.

1050
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:31,883
We made soups out of them.

1051
01:22:32,008 --> 01:22:34,216
- I remember. I remember.
- You remember...

1052
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:38,008
No!...I just remembered that
you're the dumbest person on earth.

1053
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:43,805
Neil, Nitin and Mukesh!

1054
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:47,468
Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.

1055
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,255
Wow baby, your arms are in season.

1056
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,091
- They just grew another inch.
- I see...

1057
01:22:56,508 --> 01:22:57,758
- Now my turn.
- Okay

1058
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:01,341
Wow...what a waist.

1059
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:03,175
You lost another inch.

1060
01:23:03,716 --> 01:23:04,966
You like it?

1061
01:23:06,383 --> 01:23:07,754
- Hi, Pooja.
- Hi

1062
01:23:08,091 --> 01:23:10,197
Listen Kriti,
I need to have a word with you.

1063
01:23:10,508 --> 01:23:11,385
Go on.

1064
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,716
Max, can you please leave.

1065
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:16,808
How rude?
Why should he leave?

1066
01:23:17,091 --> 01:23:18,339
Pooja, he's my fiancee.

1067
01:23:18,591 --> 01:23:20,730
Say whatever you want in front of him.
We don't have any secrets.

1068
01:23:20,953 --> 01:23:22,341
Oh really...

1069
01:23:22,466 --> 01:23:27,050
then maybe it's not a secret that
Max and Neha are having an affair.

1070
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:28,633
- What?
- What?

1071
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,841
What?

1072
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:32,636
No, baby...she is lying.

1073
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,553
I'm not having an affair with Neha.

1074
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:36,008
Mother swear.

1075
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,998
Awww baby, I trust you.

1076
01:23:38,216 --> 01:23:40,611
And anyway, she's like this.

1077
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,224
Like what?
What do you mean by like this?

1078
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:45,970
Kriti, I am talking to
you as a concerned sister, okay

1079
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:49,966
Oh, so as a concerned sister
I've got something to tell you aswell.

1080
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,008
Before pointing fingers
at my fiancee...

1081
01:23:52,091 --> 01:23:53,425
...you should keep
your fiancee in check.

1082
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,841
What do you mean?

1083
01:23:54,925 --> 01:23:56,421
Pooja, I didn't want to say this...

1084
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:58,374
...because it will spoil
your mood before the wedding.

1085
01:23:58,679 --> 01:23:59,839
But I am sorry, you've asked for it.

1086
01:24:00,216 --> 01:24:02,928
Your Harry is a pervert.
He was flirting with me.

1087
01:24:03,008 --> 01:24:04,883
- What?
- He tried to kiss me.

1088
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:05,925
He came this...
No...

1089
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:07,925
- This close, baby...
- Pervert!

1090
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,764
I knew he was a lowlife, but
I never thought he'll stoop this low.

1091
01:24:12,425 --> 01:24:14,008
- I won't leave that scoundrel
- Hey..

1092
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:16,008
Don't you dare say
anything about my Harry.

1093
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:20,878
He's such a decent guy that
he didn't even kiss his own fiancee...

1094
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:22,724
...why would he try to kiss you?

1095
01:24:23,685 --> 01:24:24,566
Pooja...

1096
01:24:25,253 --> 01:24:26,341
I want an honest answer.

1097
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:29,663
What's going on between you and Roy?

1098
01:24:30,591 --> 01:24:32,550
Nothing. Have you lost your mind?

1099
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:34,758
- Don't lie to me.
- Wow...

1100
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:36,925
Match made in Heaven.

1101
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,050
Her fiancee is hitting on me...

1102
01:24:39,216 --> 01:24:40,883
...and she's hitting on her fiancee.

1103
01:24:41,008 --> 01:24:42,394
What a couple.

1104
01:24:42,474 --> 01:24:45,883
Wait. I'll let you in
on a little secret about her.

1105
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:49,829
Back in college,
she stole your boyfriend.

1106
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:53,091
By telling him that you're a lesbian.

1107
01:24:53,633 --> 01:24:55,216
Don't believe her.

1108
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:57,175
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

1109
01:24:57,508 --> 01:24:59,716
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

1110
01:25:00,425 --> 01:25:02,216
Keep your volume down!

1111
01:25:03,091 --> 01:25:05,383
Have you gone ballistically paranoid?

1112
01:25:05,862 --> 01:25:06,531
Sorry but

1113
01:25:06,675 --> 01:25:11,591
What is this mackerel,
shrimp, tuna, fish market?

1114
01:25:11,675 --> 01:25:12,758
For God's sake.

1115
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:16,008
The henna ceremony is going to commence.

1116
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:19,508
And guests are embarked
their prolific presence.

1117
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:23,425
My God...this is not bus stand,
taxi stand, rickshaw stand.

1118
01:25:23,508 --> 01:25:25,133
Try to understand.

1119
01:25:25,552 --> 01:25:27,925
Please go to your rooms and get ready.

1120
01:25:28,008 --> 01:25:29,091
Please...

1121
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,591
Such low class people
have come to my hotel

1122
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:39,300
Why did I leave England
and come to this place?

1123
01:25:39,383 --> 01:25:41,395
- My God.
- An apple a day keeps the doctor away

1124
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:44,550
Everyone's soulmate is right here,
but where's my silly Giggly.

1125
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,050
The apple of my eye.

1126
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:47,050
Pasta!

1127
01:25:49,425 --> 01:25:52,050
- Mamma Mia...
- Mr. Winston.

1128
01:25:52,216 --> 01:25:53,966
Hey...I fired you!

1129
01:25:54,091 --> 01:25:55,300
Who rehired you?!

1130
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:57,508
Mr. Manager, everyone is reborn again.

1131
01:25:57,591 --> 01:25:58,758
This nonsense again.

1132
01:25:58,841 --> 01:26:01,716
I swear on my blood,
everyone's reborn again.

1133
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,883
Listen...

1134
01:26:08,094 --> 01:26:10,529
- Just like the movie "Karz"!
- What is this disgusting?

1135
01:26:10,609 --> 01:26:12,195
Get out! Get out from here!

1136
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:15,172
What is this disgusting.
Bloody blood on my head!

1137
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:17,368
How dare he touch my face?

1138
01:26:17,618 --> 01:26:18,368
My gosh

1139
01:26:29,743 --> 01:26:30,826
Sauce...

1140
01:26:49,035 --> 01:26:50,618
Hey Mister!

1141
01:27:07,326 --> 01:27:09,618
Bloody idiots.

1142
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:12,993
Why are you upset?
Have some more.

1143
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:18,076
Dharam!

1144
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:26,160
- Harry's really annoyed me.
- Yeah, but what shall I do, man?

1145
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:27,845
- Forget it, man.
- I'm not understanding-

1146
01:27:27,925 --> 01:27:28,703
My dear brother.

1147
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:30,493
- You!
- Max!

1148
01:27:31,743 --> 01:27:33,535
You tried to kiss Kriti, didn't you?

1149
01:27:33,618 --> 01:27:35,826
No..you're getting me wrong.

1150
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,785
Wrong.
He only tried to kiss your girlfriend.

1151
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:42,368
- But he licked my girlfriend's back.
- I am not a serial licker.

1152
01:27:42,743 --> 01:27:44,326
Listen to me...

1153
01:27:44,493 --> 01:27:46,785
- We've been reincarnated...
- Get lost!

1154
01:27:47,118 --> 01:27:48,868
And stay away from my Kriti!

1155
01:27:51,118 --> 01:27:52,737
- Listen to me...
- Just stay away.

1156
01:27:52,817 --> 01:27:54,368
Your henna is so dark.

1157
01:27:54,722 --> 01:27:55,826
Very rare.

1158
01:27:55,906 --> 01:27:57,160
It's so beautiful.

1159
01:27:57,243 --> 01:27:59,992
- Kriti. Kriti.
- You pervert!

1160
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:01,231
Pervert?

1161
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:04,993
No, no

1162
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:06,701
No. I won't touch you.

1163
01:28:07,201 --> 01:28:08,868
Carefully...just...

1164
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,216
Listen to me.

1165
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:13,535
Look into my eyes.
Look deep into my eyes.

1166
01:28:13,993 --> 01:28:15,368
You will remember something.

1167
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:16,785
1419

1168
01:28:17,035 --> 01:28:18,201
Remember what happened in 1419

1169
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,368
- Pepper spray.
- Pepper spray?

1170
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:31,243
- Neha listen!
- I don't want to hear anything!

1171
01:28:31,326 --> 01:28:32,974
- Give me a towel, man!
- Go to hell.

1172
01:28:33,054 --> 01:28:34,413
-Somebody give me a towel!
- You go to hell.

1173
01:28:34,493 --> 01:28:36,035
I don't care either.

1174
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:38,035
Bloody pervert.

1175
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:42,410
Mamma Mia,
Prince Bala what is wrong with you?

1176
01:28:42,493 --> 01:28:46,035
You used to kill and
now you're getting killed!

1177
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:52,598
My brothers are quarreling with me.

1178
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:55,576
These three women are
quarreling within themselves.

1179
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,826
The wedding is in 31 hours.

1180
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,743
If we don't do something...

1181
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:03,118
...then we'll have to
marry our sisters-in-law.

1182
01:29:03,201 --> 01:29:06,076
Mamma Mia, we prayed to God...

1183
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,826
...he will definitely send
an angel to rescue us.

1184
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:13,035
- Where is that angel?
- Here I am.

1185
01:29:14,668 --> 01:29:16,993
I remember everything.

1186
01:29:17,243 --> 01:29:21,121
I look a little ugly...
People say I am silly.

1187
01:29:21,201 --> 01:29:22,785
But I am 1419's...

1188
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,785
...Giggly!

1189
01:29:30,285 --> 01:29:32,326
Master Bangdu!

1190
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,993
Your sweetheart's
going with someone else.

1191
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:36,826
In the previous life,
"Oh I am exhausted."

1192
01:29:37,326 --> 01:29:41,326
Dharamputra!
It doesn't matter what anybody says..

1193
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:45,035
...you're the strongest bodyguard.

1194
01:29:46,118 --> 01:29:47,410
What the hell is he saying?!

1195
01:29:47,743 --> 01:29:50,298
Meena, Mala, Madhu...

1196
01:29:50,743 --> 01:29:53,410
...can I soap your
backs again and rub you.

1197
01:29:53,493 --> 01:29:54,910
What?

1198
01:29:58,368 --> 01:30:00,743
King Surya Singh Rana.

1199
01:30:01,285 --> 01:30:03,160
Stop being over smart

1200
01:30:03,368 --> 01:30:05,285
Whenever I wore a skirt.

1201
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:07,285
You would keep staring...

1202
01:30:09,285 --> 01:30:10,618
...at me and flirt.

1203
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:11,951
Hey...

1204
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:19,657
Prince Bala...I remember
your 'Phish Phish'...

1205
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,743
This is how you would dismiss.

1206
01:30:21,826 --> 01:30:22,910
Who is he?

1207
01:30:23,035 --> 01:30:23,618
Remember?

1208
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:27,118
Mamma mia...Winston
Churchgate is Giggly?!

1209
01:30:28,326 --> 01:30:29,910
Aakhri Pasta!

1210
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:33,672
Your love has finally
found it's destination.

1211
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:36,910
"My dear Pasta..."

1212
01:30:36,993 --> 01:30:38,910
"...when you lay your sights on me..."

1213
01:30:38,993 --> 01:30:42,201
"...you make this Giggly shy."

1214
01:30:42,285 --> 01:30:43,910
"Swing that bat."

1215
01:30:43,993 --> 01:30:46,035
"I am your Giggly..."

1216
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:49,910
"This game is so much fun."

1217
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,285
You're my husband, I am your wife.

1218
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:56,826
Shower me with your love...
...or I will tear your apart.

1219
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,326
Mamma!

1220
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,826
- I cannot be your love.
- Hey Mister!

1221
01:31:03,618 --> 01:31:05,955
- Show me!
- Wow, so nice!

1222
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:09,035
Hey...tell me,
who's going for the operation?

1223
01:31:09,118 --> 01:31:10,493
- You or me?
- Operation.

1224
01:31:10,785 --> 01:31:12,618
Of course.
Don't you want kids.

1225
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,660
I've even come up with names?
Shabana, Sultana, Ruksana.

1226
01:31:16,743 --> 01:31:19,201
And after that...please stop.

1227
01:31:20,826 --> 01:31:22,035
Pasta.

1228
01:31:22,118 --> 01:31:25,743
You always said that God
will send an angel to rescue us.

1229
01:31:26,618 --> 01:31:28,285
- Do you know who that angel is?
- Who?

1230
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:30,076
Giggly.

1231
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,201
Giggly?

1232
01:31:31,493 --> 01:31:34,701
You anointed her forehead
and she remembered her past.

1233
01:31:35,201 --> 01:31:40,229
Meaning, I will have to show
Kriti something personal...

1234
01:31:40,451 --> 01:31:41,493
...and then she will remember.

1235
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:44,701
Prince Bala, what personal
thing are you going to show her.

1236
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:45,826
Not that.

1237
01:31:46,285 --> 01:31:47,326
Look at this!

1238
01:31:48,076 --> 01:31:49,993
Makduddin!

1239
01:31:57,035 --> 01:31:59,326
- See you at the wedding.
- Bye, bye...

1240
01:32:00,868 --> 01:32:01,826
Makduddin!

1241
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,955
Hey mister... Operation.

1242
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:05,951
- Mamma Mia.
- Hey, come here!

1243
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:20,828
- Hi.
- Harry?

1244
01:32:24,285 --> 01:32:26,576
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

1245
01:32:30,076 --> 01:32:33,451
- You killed my spider.
- Shut up!

1246
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:35,743
How dare you?

1247
01:32:36,035 --> 01:32:37,868
I know guys like you very well.

1248
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:39,326
When you can't score with a girl...

1249
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:42,160
...you throw acid on her face
to vent your anger and frustration.

1250
01:32:42,243 --> 01:32:45,535
And since you couldn't find any acid
here, you threw a spider on my face.

1251
01:32:45,618 --> 01:32:46,910
- No..
- You freak.

1252
01:32:47,868 --> 01:32:49,785
Wait... I am not going
to spare you today.

1253
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,410
What kind of a love story is this?

1254
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:53,826
- My bum...
- I will make your bum burn!

1255
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:55,493
- Stop. Don't hit me.
- Say sorry!

1256
01:32:55,576 --> 01:32:56,993
First my front side
and now my backside!

1257
01:32:57,076 --> 01:32:58,451
Stay away from me!

1258
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:09,410
"You're my everything!
You're my sweetheart!"

1259
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,826
My Makduddin...

1260
01:33:12,035 --> 01:33:14,785
You cannot die, son. Wake up.

1261
01:33:14,868 --> 01:33:17,535
Wake up for me, son.
Wake up.

1262
01:33:17,776 --> 01:33:19,910
Do you want oxygen?

1263
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:21,326
Let me give you oxygen
from here

1264
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:27,493
My soulmate!!

1265
01:33:28,579 --> 01:33:31,743
Guys! I am telling you, you're making
a big mistake blaming Harry.

1266
01:33:31,993 --> 01:33:33,201
He can never do something like that.

1267
01:33:33,326 --> 01:33:34,410
Never?

1268
01:33:34,493 --> 01:33:36,326
Pooja, he threw a poisonous
spider on my face.

1269
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,955
He only threw a spider on your face...

1270
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:40,160
...he was telling
me to lick a piece of shit.

1271
01:33:40,243 --> 01:33:42,285
- Yuck...
- That's impossible.

1272
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,118
Impossible?!

1273
01:33:43,285 --> 01:33:45,285
Who told you that I'm
having an affair with Neha?

1274
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:45,955
Harry.

1275
01:33:46,035 --> 01:33:48,410
And who told you that Roy loves Pooja.

1276
01:33:48,576 --> 01:33:49,743
- Harry.
- See...

1277
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:52,785
Harry is the root of all these problems.
Let's go and speak to him now!

1278
01:33:53,547 --> 01:33:54,285
Come.

1279
01:33:55,868 --> 01:33:57,743
Forgive me, pigeons. Forgive me.

1280
01:33:58,406 --> 01:34:01,151
In the previous life, I ate you.

1281
01:34:01,356 --> 01:34:04,035
In this life you cannot eat me...

1282
01:34:04,201 --> 01:34:07,451
...but you can shower
me with what you ate.

1283
01:34:08,686 --> 01:34:09,763
Shit on me.

1284
01:34:09,951 --> 01:34:11,160
Shit on me
as hard as you can.

1285
01:34:11,243 --> 01:34:13,951
Its the only way to atone for my sins,
angry birds.

1286
01:34:14,031 --> 01:34:19,576
Dad. Harry's completely lost it.

1287
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:22,326
No my child, don't lose heart.

1288
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:27,160
I will take Harry to
the best psychiatrist in town.

1289
01:34:27,243 --> 01:34:28,035
Please don't cry

1290
01:34:28,318 --> 01:34:30,993
No doctor can treat him, Thakral

1291
01:34:31,451 --> 01:34:33,285
This is Sitamgarh.

1292
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:38,660
And ghostly possessions
are pretty common out here.

1293
01:34:38,743 --> 01:34:41,326
- What nonsense.
- This is not nonsense.

1294
01:34:41,535 --> 01:34:43,035
In fact it's the truth.

1295
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,288
- My god!
- Look...

1296
01:34:44,701 --> 01:34:50,326
"Pasta, when will
we walk down the aisle."

1297
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:51,868
Take a look at the Hotel Manager.

1298
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:54,535
Now he's wearing a sari, he's put on
lipstick, and his voice has changed.

1299
01:34:54,615 --> 01:34:56,201
He's behaving so weirdly.

1300
01:34:56,285 --> 01:34:59,201
- You're not my wife.
- Come here...

1301
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:00,657
Similarly...

1302
01:35:01,087 --> 01:35:03,368
your son-in-law's
been possessed as well.

1303
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:07,035
My poor Harry, he's possessed.

1304
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:08,743
So sorry.

1305
01:35:08,826 --> 01:35:10,201
Don't worry, dear

1306
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:13,035
I know someone who...

1307
01:35:13,413 --> 01:35:15,205
...who is an expert
in exorcising ghosts.

1308
01:35:15,371 --> 01:35:17,288
Ramsey Baba.

1309
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:19,621
Why are we here?

1310
01:35:19,705 --> 01:35:22,330
- Scary looking place, man
- Who are we meeting here?

1311
01:35:23,038 --> 01:35:24,621
Ramsey Baba...

1312
01:35:24,955 --> 01:35:27,121
...he will exorcise
the ghost possessing you.

1313
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:28,871
- Ghost?
- Yes...

1314
01:35:29,705 --> 01:35:31,121
But Ramsey Baba has a problem.

1315
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:32,163
- What?
- What?

1316
01:35:32,246 --> 01:35:33,913
He's possessed by a ghost himself.

1317
01:35:33,996 --> 01:35:35,038
Who's ghost?

1318
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,121
His wife.

1319
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:37,705
- What?
- What?

1320
01:35:38,413 --> 01:35:40,038
What if he makes things worse?

1321
01:35:40,413 --> 01:35:42,121
No, he won't.
He will set things straight.

1322
01:35:42,205 --> 01:35:46,871
Because he thinks straight, he talks straight,
and his methods are straight too.

1323
01:35:46,955 --> 01:35:48,038
Look...

1324
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,705
Ramsey Baba is coming
straight towards us.

1325
01:36:25,455 --> 01:36:29,121
Hey upside down mister
...look straight this way.

1326
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,121
Harry!

1327
01:36:36,705 --> 01:36:39,288
I'll remove your inner cherry.

1328
01:36:44,788 --> 01:36:46,955
Sometime I feel I am the God.

1329
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:49,788
Sometimes I feel I am God.

1330
01:36:52,996 --> 01:36:55,371
- You're joking..
- And I am not joking.

1331
01:36:55,455 --> 01:36:56,205
Yeah yeah

1332
01:36:57,705 --> 01:36:58,496
My darling!

1333
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:02,913
I won't give up until I
exorcise the ghost inside of you.

1334
01:37:05,705 --> 01:37:07,205
What is going on here?

1335
01:37:09,121 --> 01:37:10,330
You think you're an exorcist?

1336
01:37:10,663 --> 01:37:11,871
All he does is laze around all day.

1337
01:37:12,788 --> 01:37:14,996
And stuffs his face.

1338
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,788
But give him a job,
he'll never do it straight.

1339
01:37:16,871 --> 01:37:18,955
You guys are here.

1340
01:37:19,913 --> 01:37:21,038
I didn't know.

1341
01:37:21,746 --> 01:37:24,080
What would you guys like to have?
Black tea, green tea.

1342
01:37:24,163 --> 01:37:25,413
Guys..

1343
01:37:25,621 --> 01:37:29,121
How will he exorcise my Harry,
when he's possessed himself?!

1344
01:37:32,288 --> 01:37:33,455
Sorry...

1345
01:37:33,746 --> 01:37:34,830
Sorry...

1346
01:37:35,455 --> 01:37:39,038
Wife strength...husband patience.

1347
01:37:39,413 --> 01:37:40,580
But...

1348
01:37:40,663 --> 01:37:44,746
- Mr Ramsey...my nipples...my nipples...
- I'll get rid of everything...

1349
01:37:44,955 --> 01:37:49,871
With my power and devotion
I will destroy the ghost inside you.

1350
01:37:50,038 --> 01:37:51,955
Hocus-Pocus!

1351
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,288
Idiot...what is this?

1352
01:37:55,788 --> 01:37:57,621
Take my favourite heroine's name.

1353
01:37:57,955 --> 01:37:59,288
Alia Bhatt.

1354
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:01,496
Oh, sorry.

1355
01:38:02,246 --> 01:38:04,038
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay.

1356
01:39:08,496 --> 01:39:11,663
Why are you hitting me?
The ghost is inside of you, not me!

1357
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:12,788
This man is crazy!

1358
01:40:55,663 --> 01:40:57,288
"Won't you take my blessings?"

1359
01:41:02,871 --> 01:41:05,413
He remembers!
He remembers!

1360
01:41:11,955 --> 01:41:14,163
Bangdu!!

1361
01:41:54,538 --> 01:41:56,163
Forgive us, birds. Forgive us.

1362
01:41:56,955 --> 01:42:00,205
We had heard of a saying,
'bird's of a feather flock together'.

1363
01:42:00,663 --> 01:42:02,038
But let's change it a bit.

1364
01:42:02,705 --> 01:42:05,038
Birds of a feather,
shit on us together.

1365
01:42:05,496 --> 01:42:09,288
Shit on us. Shit on our head.
Shit wherever you want to shit

1366
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:14,496
Siskeria!
What is this?

1367
01:42:14,871 --> 01:42:17,288
First the ghost was possessing only
one. Now both of them are possessed.

1368
01:42:17,455 --> 01:42:20,038
Father. This place is jinxed.

1369
01:42:20,413 --> 01:42:22,121
Let's cancel this wedding.

1370
01:42:22,496 --> 01:42:24,455
"Then how will we return
Michael and Big Bhai's money?"

1371
01:42:24,788 --> 01:42:26,288
No. No, we won't cancel the wedding.

1372
01:42:26,371 --> 01:42:28,080
My brothers are not possessed.

1373
01:42:28,663 --> 01:42:31,663
If they were actually possessed,
that shaman would've exorcised them.

1374
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:35,246
They are just getting
nervous before the wedding.

1375
01:42:35,871 --> 01:42:37,288
I will talk to my brothers.

1376
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:39,705
Meanwhile you guys go and get ready.
Its almost time.

1377
01:42:39,955 --> 01:42:41,496
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

1378
01:42:45,371 --> 01:42:48,496
"We made a mistake,
please forgive us."

1379
01:42:48,955 --> 01:42:49,788
Stop it.

1380
01:42:51,663 --> 01:42:52,663
Look behind you!

1381
01:42:56,038 --> 01:42:56,788
Dharamputra.

1382
01:42:56,996 --> 01:42:59,288
Wrong. We're in big trouble.

1383
01:43:00,455 --> 01:43:01,913
Big Bhai's called a dozen times.

1384
01:43:02,538 --> 01:43:04,246
Michael is coming
over for the wedding.

1385
01:43:04,663 --> 01:43:05,205
- What?
- What?

1386
01:43:05,371 --> 01:43:05,871
Yes.

1387
01:43:06,163 --> 01:43:10,080
So please stop acting stupid and
get ready for the wedding functions.

1388
01:43:10,455 --> 01:43:12,205
Max, He was right.

1389
01:43:12,871 --> 01:43:14,621
We've all been reincarnated.

1390
01:43:14,913 --> 01:43:17,288
Wait a minute.
Let me explain.

1391
01:43:17,705 --> 01:43:19,455
Brother, it's very-very simple.

1392
01:43:19,955 --> 01:43:23,788
His wife is not his wife.
She is your wife.

1393
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:27,246
And our sister-in-law.
And my wife is not my wife.

1394
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:29,288
She is his wife.
And our sister-in-law.

1395
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:32,496
And your wife is not your wife.

1396
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:34,496
- She is my wife.
- Kriti is mine.

1397
01:43:37,163 --> 01:43:37,996
Max.

1398
01:43:39,205 --> 01:43:40,746
Stay in your limits.

1399
01:43:41,871 --> 01:43:43,038
Let me tell you.

1400
01:43:44,288 --> 01:43:50,705
Kriti...was mine,
she still is, and forever will be.

1401
01:43:57,163 --> 01:43:59,080
Max! What are you doing?!

1402
01:44:01,996 --> 01:44:03,080
Stop it you guys.

1403
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,080
Prince Bala.

1404
01:45:29,038 --> 01:45:30,330
What did you just say?

1405
01:45:31,455 --> 01:45:32,871
Prince Bala.

1406
01:45:37,496 --> 01:45:38,330
Dharamputra.

1407
01:45:50,788 --> 01:45:51,746
Bangdu.

1408
01:46:06,455 --> 01:46:09,913
You know, now I've finally
understood fate's master plan.

1409
01:46:12,288 --> 01:46:14,621
It's all predestined.

1410
01:46:14,996 --> 01:46:16,830
And Mr. Forgetful here...

1411
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:21,621
He caused us so much trouble, because he kept
forgetting! I abused him so much for it.

1412
01:46:21,996 --> 01:46:24,163
But imagine,
if he didn't have this condition...

1413
01:46:24,413 --> 01:46:27,996
...and didn't wash Michael's money, we
would've never gone after these three girls.

1414
01:46:28,121 --> 01:46:28,913
Yes.

1415
01:46:29,163 --> 01:46:32,538
Saving the girls,
and their dad accepting us.

1416
01:46:33,455 --> 01:46:37,830
The spinning of that globe
and always stopping on Sitamgarh.

1417
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:41,913
All of this happened so that

1418
01:46:42,038 --> 01:46:46,288
we could take on the responsibility
of getting our true love.

1419
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,371
The biggest player...is God.

1420
01:46:51,246 --> 01:46:53,038
Imagine 1419...

1421
01:46:54,788 --> 01:46:57,496
1419...
And now 2019.

1422
01:46:58,121 --> 01:47:03,121
Even after 6 centuries
our true love still prevails.

1423
01:47:03,496 --> 01:47:05,330
- Correct.
- What's correct?

1424
01:47:05,538 --> 01:47:07,455
We only have 22 hours
until the wedding.

1425
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:09,080
Let's come up with a plan.

1426
01:47:11,621 --> 01:47:13,455
We've hurt them a lot, haven't we?

1427
01:47:14,621 --> 01:47:17,330
First let's go and
apologize to them three.

1428
01:47:17,996 --> 01:47:19,288
But will they forgive us?

1429
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:26,871
We know that we have hurt you three a lot
and we're not worthy of your forgiveness.

1430
01:47:27,663 --> 01:47:30,038
But if possible, please forgive us.

1431
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:34,663
Shit on us. Shit on our head.

1432
01:47:38,871 --> 01:47:40,413
Why aren't they shitting on us?

1433
01:47:44,955 --> 01:47:47,038
What if they have forgiven us?

1434
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:53,205
O pigeons, if you have forgiven us...

1435
01:47:53,455 --> 01:47:58,121
...then please give us a sign so
that we know that you've forgiven us.

1436
01:48:01,621 --> 01:48:02,663
They've forgiven us!

1437
01:48:02,746 --> 01:48:04,163
He scratched his
head to show the sign!

1438
01:48:05,455 --> 01:48:08,038
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

1439
01:48:09,746 --> 01:48:12,705
Now we must remind the girls.

1440
01:48:12,788 --> 01:48:13,871
- Yes
- Come on.

1441
01:48:14,038 --> 01:48:14,746
Come on

1442
01:48:15,038 --> 01:48:16,080
Bye bye birds!

1443
01:48:18,913 --> 01:48:19,955
Gentlemen...

1444
01:48:20,538 --> 01:48:22,955
And my ladies.

1445
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:23,871
Girls.

1446
01:48:25,163 --> 01:48:26,913
Before you react...

1447
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,246
- We want to tell you something.
- Speak up.

1448
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:33,496
...their cousin brother,
lets welcome the famous singer...

1449
01:48:33,788 --> 01:48:35,955
Pappu Rangeela.

1450
01:48:36,038 --> 01:48:37,246
Brother Pappu.

1451
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:38,871
Come, come lets go!

1452
01:48:38,955 --> 01:48:39,913
Pappu?

1453
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,746
Sounds like some roadside singer.

1454
01:48:51,496 --> 01:48:53,121
"Revenge!"

1455
01:48:53,788 --> 01:48:54,830
Gama!!

1456
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:59,830
"Revenge!"

1457
01:49:52,538 --> 01:49:53,705
"Gama!"

1458
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:24,705
Where is Pappu?

1459
01:50:32,288 --> 01:50:34,913
- "Revenge-Revenge-Revenge."
- Coming. Coming.

1460
01:50:34,996 --> 01:50:35,788
We're going.

1461
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:31,621
"Sa...Re"

1462
01:51:32,496 --> 01:51:34,871
You've got such a
beautiful voice, brother.

1463
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:37,330
Sing with me.

1464
01:51:37,496 --> 01:51:38,955
Sa Re...

1465
01:51:39,038 --> 01:51:40,246
Great.

1466
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,371
You guys sing too.

1467
01:51:41,538 --> 01:51:42,955
- Sing guys!
- Sing baby!

1468
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,830
Sa Re...

1469
01:51:44,913 --> 01:51:45,996
No, no,...

1470
01:51:46,163 --> 01:51:50,371
You guys sing...
Sa Re Ga Ma...

1471
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:53,413
Ga Ma...

1472
01:51:53,996 --> 01:51:55,955
Gama!

1473
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,538
They are on a higher pitch.

1474
01:52:00,871 --> 01:52:04,413
You know what, you guys sing...

1475
01:52:04,871 --> 01:52:06,871
Ga Ma Ma Re Ga.

1476
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:10,163
- No, no, no, no
- Why not? Don't be scared.

1477
01:52:10,246 --> 01:52:11,871
- Please sing.
- Baby, come on!

1478
01:52:11,955 --> 01:52:14,413
Ga.. Ma..Ma.. Re..Ga..

1479
01:52:15,038 --> 01:52:17,663
- Sing!
- Baby, come on sing.

1480
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:20,913
GAMA WILL KILL US!

1481
01:52:21,038 --> 01:52:23,455
Ga Ma Ma Re Ga.

1482
01:52:23,663 --> 01:52:26,871
GAMA WILL KILL US!

1483
01:52:28,205 --> 01:52:29,371
Absolutely right.

1484
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:31,413
Gama will kill.

1485
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:34,621
Our wedding is tomorrow.

1486
01:52:35,413 --> 01:52:37,788
On one hand we want
the girls to remember the past life...

1487
01:52:37,996 --> 01:52:41,038
...and on the other hand we don't want
brother Pappu to remember the past life.

1488
01:52:42,163 --> 01:52:46,621
Otherwise Pappu will turn
into Gama and kill us all.

1489
01:52:48,705 --> 01:52:50,413
Why do you think so negative?

1490
01:52:50,746 --> 01:52:52,996
- Does he remember yet?
- No.

1491
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,205
So then he won't remember.

1492
01:53:28,705 --> 01:53:31,163
- Hey! Why are you hiding?
- Let go of me! I don't want to come!

1493
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:38,746
- The sounds are coming from here.
- I can hear that too.

1494
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:39,996
Bodyguard.

1495
01:53:40,538 --> 01:53:42,830
Go inside, and check who it is.

1496
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,330
Bodyguard my foot!

1497
01:53:44,746 --> 01:53:45,871
That was in my previous life.

1498
01:53:46,246 --> 01:53:47,246
You go.

1499
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:54,705
I think he's doing
these things in his sleep.

1500
01:53:55,163 --> 01:53:59,455
He's mad, he's smashing
his head against the window.

1501
01:54:13,955 --> 01:54:16,080
A L D A B.

1502
01:54:16,246 --> 01:54:17,246
Marathi?

1503
01:54:21,496 --> 01:54:22,996
Don't move. Don't move.

1504
01:55:07,413 --> 01:55:08,788
He's fallen asleep.

1505
01:55:10,996 --> 01:55:13,371
But what does A L D A B mean?

1506
01:55:14,538 --> 01:55:15,455
What does it mean?

1507
01:55:15,705 --> 01:55:17,205
Maybe some shop Dubai?

1508
01:55:17,371 --> 01:55:19,080
It's some shop in Dubai!

1509
01:55:29,996 --> 01:55:32,288
B A D L A (Revenge)
It means Revenge!

1510
01:55:32,871 --> 01:55:33,538
Revenge?!

1511
01:55:33,663 --> 01:55:36,663
Meaning he's starting
to remember everything!

1512
01:55:37,413 --> 01:55:41,288
- Run. Run. Run. Run.
- Gama's revenge! Gama's revenge!

1513
01:55:41,371 --> 01:55:43,163
This way.
This way.

1514
01:55:43,246 --> 01:55:45,788
Slowly, slowly!

1515
01:55:56,496 --> 01:56:02,621
"My sweety,
my angel, Giggly's crazy about you."

1516
01:56:02,746 --> 01:56:04,163
- Get lost!
- Hey Mister!

1517
01:56:04,246 --> 01:56:05,413
It's time for the wedding.

1518
01:56:06,288 --> 01:56:07,455
Where are the grooms?

1519
01:56:10,455 --> 01:56:13,288
It's time to marry our sisters-in-law.

1520
01:56:13,413 --> 01:56:15,246
Let's go.

1521
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,288
We're so screwed and
you're trying to make jokes.

1522
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:19,455
This whole thing is a joke!

1523
01:56:19,788 --> 01:56:21,163
The girls don't remember anything.

1524
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:23,663
But Gama's starting
to remember everything.

1525
01:56:23,746 --> 01:56:25,496
I say let's just leave everything
and run away from here!

1526
01:56:25,705 --> 01:56:26,455
No.

1527
01:56:28,163 --> 01:56:29,205
We won't run away.

1528
01:56:29,413 --> 01:56:31,455
If God has brought us this far...

1529
01:56:32,705 --> 01:56:34,121
...He will lead us
to our destination too.

1530
01:56:34,996 --> 01:56:36,121
Mamma Mia.

1531
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:40,246
I've got some extra good
news for you three!

1532
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:41,621
And I am not joking.

1533
01:56:41,788 --> 01:56:43,080
Giggly was chasing me...

1534
01:56:43,163 --> 01:56:45,080
...and whilst I was trying to escape her
...we landed up in the basement.

1535
01:56:45,246 --> 01:56:49,413
Call it romantically or accidentally...
...Guess what I found?

1536
01:56:49,496 --> 01:56:50,413
What?

1537
01:56:50,496 --> 01:56:53,330
This painting from our previous life.

1538
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,455
This is that same painting!

1539
01:57:01,913 --> 01:57:04,788
Oh, God. This will
sort out all of our problems!

1540
01:57:05,121 --> 01:57:09,621
If the girls see this painting,
they will remember everything.

1541
01:57:09,913 --> 01:57:10,538
Yes!

1542
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:13,371
Pasta and Giggly,
many thanks to you two.

1543
01:57:14,205 --> 01:57:15,705
God bless you, God bless you!

1544
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:16,455
Hey Mister!

1545
01:57:16,663 --> 01:57:20,038
Come on, let's find the girls
and show them the painting together.

1546
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:20,996
Yes.

1547
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:23,038
You check in the room
and we'll check the hall.

1548
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:23,955
Okay!

1549
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:25,496
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1550
01:57:27,788 --> 01:57:29,871
See...
Even the prince took my blessings!

1551
01:57:29,955 --> 01:57:32,871
- You will marry me now, won't you?!
- I will never be your husband!

1552
01:57:32,996 --> 01:57:34,455
- Mamma Mia...
- Let me teach you!

1553
01:57:34,871 --> 01:57:35,996
Hello, Reception.

1554
01:57:36,413 --> 01:57:39,371
Some guy is supposed to
bring the poster of my new album.

1555
01:57:39,705 --> 01:57:40,913
Please send him up.

1556
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,080
Thank you.

1557
01:57:58,496 --> 01:58:01,080
Brother-in-law, please come in.

1558
01:58:01,413 --> 01:58:03,080
Brother Pappu!

1559
01:58:06,788 --> 01:58:09,121
Oh wow!
You brought the poster.

1560
01:58:10,788 --> 01:58:12,080
- Poster?
- Yes.

1561
01:58:12,246 --> 01:58:14,705
The poster of my new album.
'Revenge Again'

1562
01:58:15,038 --> 01:58:17,080
- Please.
- Here you go.

1563
01:58:38,788 --> 01:58:40,413
Where?

1564
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:44,913
I'll go and get everyone.

1565
01:58:45,705 --> 01:58:46,996
Where are my glasses?

1566
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:50,371
You can't see the poster?

1567
01:58:50,455 --> 01:58:51,996
My eyesight is quite weak.

1568
01:58:52,163 --> 01:58:55,705
I kept it somewhere here...

1569
01:58:56,538 --> 01:59:00,121
Brother Pappu...
try checking under that pillow.

1570
01:59:00,413 --> 01:59:01,371
Yes, yes.

1571
01:59:09,871 --> 01:59:11,455
- What are you looking for?
- My glasses.

1572
01:59:11,746 --> 01:59:12,246
Glasses?

1573
01:59:15,205 --> 01:59:16,080
Here they are.

1574
01:59:16,163 --> 01:59:17,996
- Thank you.
- Let me clean them for you

1575
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:19,538
Here you are

1576
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:20,455
Thank you.

1577
01:59:22,413 --> 01:59:23,121
What is the time?

1578
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:24,788
It's 6 o'clock.

1579
01:59:24,871 --> 01:59:26,788
Time to go for a jog.

1580
01:59:28,371 --> 01:59:29,121
Jog?

1581
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,163
Unbelievable.

1582
01:59:32,371 --> 01:59:35,080
Only 30 minutes until his
wedding and he's gone to jog.

1583
01:59:35,705 --> 01:59:37,538
This generation I tell you...

1584
01:59:38,163 --> 01:59:41,737
"Changed-Changed-Changed"

1585
01:59:41,885 --> 01:59:44,594
Papa, where are those three?!
We've been looking for them for ages.

1586
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:46,177
They aren't in their room and they
aren't answering our calls either!

1587
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:47,844
- I was just asking the same thing!
- I don't know what's happening.

1588
01:59:48,635 --> 01:59:49,885
- Have you seen them?
- No my dear.

1589
01:59:49,969 --> 01:59:50,760
Kriti...

1590
01:59:51,094 --> 01:59:51,635
Yeah?

1591
01:59:58,427 --> 02:00:00,680
- Long live...
- The King!

1592
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,639
- Long live...
- The King!

1593
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:05,260
- Long live...
- The King!

1594
02:00:06,344 --> 02:00:07,552
Where did you three get lost?

1595
02:00:07,635 --> 02:00:08,677
This place...

1596
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,010
Forget the place.

1597
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:11,844
Tell me where are the boys?

1598
02:00:12,135 --> 02:00:13,219
Here we are.

1599
02:00:13,385 --> 02:00:14,344
Max.

1600
02:00:14,427 --> 02:00:16,344
- We were looking for you.
- Where is Harry?

1601
02:00:16,427 --> 02:00:17,427
Actually Mala...

1602
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,844
- Mala?
- Who's Mala?

1603
02:00:19,427 --> 02:00:20,427
Mala...

1604
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:25,427
I mean before we proceed with the wedding,
there's something we need to tell you.

1605
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:27,219
Actually, we want to show you.

1606
02:00:27,302 --> 02:00:30,594
Yeah...
Just let Harry come...

1607
02:00:31,052 --> 02:00:32,885
Harry is coming.

1608
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,686
Is he coming or going?

1609
02:00:40,387 --> 02:00:41,793
Why is he wearing jogging clothes?

1610
02:00:43,302 --> 02:00:44,135
Where are you going?

1611
02:00:44,406 --> 02:00:45,440
Where are you going, meaning?

1612
02:00:46,049 --> 02:00:47,427
What are you guys wearing?

1613
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:48,219
Who's getting married?

1614
02:00:48,302 --> 02:00:49,177
What do you mean?

1615
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,094
You, me and him!
we're all getting married today.

1616
02:00:51,453 --> 02:00:52,560
We're getting married today?

1617
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,052
Of course it's your wedding today.

1618
02:00:54,517 --> 02:00:55,510
Where is that painting?

1619
02:00:55,594 --> 02:00:57,427
Painting? What painting?

1620
02:00:58,344 --> 02:01:02,427
"Everything's changed."

1621
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,677
Oh...I forgot to see the poster.

1622
02:01:22,251 --> 02:01:25,952
"The king has sent you the invitation
to his Princesses wedding..."

1623
02:01:26,334 --> 02:01:28,522
"...as a gesture of his friendship."

1624
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:33,341
"We must go there in
order to finish this enmity."

1625
02:01:33,641 --> 02:01:38,997
"My revenge will be complete
only after I kill you all."

1626
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:41,677
"REVENGE!"

1627
02:01:48,385 --> 02:01:50,802
I am sure Gama must
have seen the painting by now.

1628
02:01:50,885 --> 02:01:53,219
- Be strong.
- Not now Giggly, let us think.

1629
02:01:53,302 --> 02:01:55,959
Shut up! I'll tell you what to do.

1630
02:01:56,753 --> 02:01:58,263
- Take a rope-
- Got it.

1631
02:01:58,417 --> 02:02:00,509
- and tie a tight knot.
- Tied it.

1632
02:02:00,717 --> 02:02:02,510
And then hang yourselves.

1633
02:02:02,594 --> 02:02:05,052
Because when Gama arrives...

1634
02:02:10,734 --> 02:02:12,552
He's come!

1635
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,657
REVENGE!

1636
02:02:18,552 --> 02:02:20,510
You killed my brother!

1637
02:02:20,590 --> 02:02:22,469
I didn't kill him!

1638
02:02:23,052 --> 02:02:24,622
Why did you enter like this?

1639
02:02:24,802 --> 02:02:28,385
And Pappu, why were you
singing in such an angry tone earlier?

1640
02:02:30,594 --> 02:02:31,885
Papa!

1641
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:37,635
- C'mon let's go!
- What is going on?!

1642
02:02:43,302 --> 02:02:44,344
Will someone please tell me

1643
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:45,719
What is going on?

1644
02:02:45,927 --> 02:02:46,927
What do you mean by what's going on?

1645
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:48,760
Gama remembers everything now.

1646
02:02:48,844 --> 02:02:51,219
Remembers what?
And who is Gama?

1647
02:02:54,885 --> 02:02:56,260
What's happening?

1648
02:02:57,153 --> 02:02:58,260
Let me find out.

1649
02:02:58,527 --> 02:02:59,746
- Pappu, darling!
- Harry!

1650
02:03:00,135 --> 02:03:04,010
Pappu, darling! Come to me!
Where are you guys going?

1651
02:03:04,094 --> 02:03:05,260
Pappu, they got scared and ran away

1652
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:06,927
Pappu, my shirt will tear!

1653
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,760
Pappu, what is this commotion, dude?

1654
02:03:08,969 --> 02:03:10,719
No commotion, only Gama.

1655
02:03:10,802 --> 02:03:11,802
Gama!

1656
02:03:39,927 --> 02:03:41,094
Dharamputra.

1657
02:03:41,302 --> 02:03:42,594
You remember everything?!

1658
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,594
Yes, my beast and protector

1659
02:03:47,635 --> 02:03:49,177
I remember Gama's revenge too!

1660
02:03:49,385 --> 02:03:50,677
Run!

1661
02:03:55,302 --> 02:03:58,260
Gama, hold your pyjama!

1662
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:03,802
I am choking!

1663
02:04:07,052 --> 02:04:09,635
You hit my husband?!

1664
02:04:09,883 --> 02:04:12,469
I curse you!

1665
02:04:12,802 --> 02:04:14,510
May you get diarrhea..

1666
02:04:14,594 --> 02:04:17,302
...just when the zipper of
your trousers gets stuck.

1667
02:04:18,052 --> 02:04:19,594
You'll be travelling by helicopter...

1668
02:04:19,677 --> 02:04:23,639
...and you start to feel cold
and the pilot turns off the fan.

1669
02:04:23,719 --> 02:04:25,063
May you rot to death.
ROT!...

1670
02:04:25,271 --> 02:04:26,719
May your corpse rot.
ROT!...

1671
02:04:26,802 --> 02:04:28,219
May you rot even after you're dead.
ROT!...

1672
02:04:28,302 --> 02:04:29,639
May you get beaten by a broom.
ROT!...

1673
02:04:29,719 --> 02:04:31,135
And your home's raided.
ROT!...

1674
02:04:31,219 --> 02:04:32,802
And worms feast on you.

1675
02:04:34,064 --> 02:04:35,260
I'm rotting...

1676
02:04:56,052 --> 02:04:57,344
Mala!

1677
02:05:05,052 --> 02:05:08,427
Sweetheart...where do
you go leaving me alone?

1678
02:05:08,635 --> 02:05:11,935
These words should
be composed into a song.

1679
02:05:12,084 --> 02:05:13,377
I'm not going to spare any of you!

1680
02:05:13,457 --> 02:05:16,469
Let's run before
Gama composes our death.

1681
02:05:17,066 --> 02:05:19,385
Will someone tell
me what the hell is going on here?!

1682
02:05:19,802 --> 02:05:21,318
Don't you remember anything
after seeing Gama?

1683
02:05:21,469 --> 02:05:23,219
- Who the hell is Gama?
- Gama...

1684
02:05:23,553 --> 02:05:25,177
Pappu Rangeela aka Gama.

1685
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:26,596
Me, Harry aka Bala.

1686
02:05:26,816 --> 02:05:28,469
You, Kriti aka Madhu.

1687
02:05:28,969 --> 02:05:30,302
Madhu... - Bala.

1688
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,052
Madhu... - Bala.

1689
02:05:33,802 --> 02:05:36,094
Madhu... - Bala.

1690
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:38,552
Harry, get away from me!

1691
02:05:38,885 --> 02:05:40,260
Even with all this chaos around us...

1692
02:05:40,622 --> 02:05:42,677
Wait here. I'll tell Pooja.

1693
02:05:43,177 --> 02:05:44,266
This guy is the biggest pervert!

1694
02:05:46,427 --> 02:05:47,302
You're so cute!

1695
02:05:47,385 --> 02:05:48,302
Pooja!

1696
02:05:48,927 --> 02:05:51,760
So I was right.
You're having an affair with Roy.

1697
02:05:51,844 --> 02:05:53,111
- No, this is just the rebirth...
- Shut up.

1698
02:05:53,385 --> 02:05:54,538
What kind of a sister are you!?

1699
02:05:54,793 --> 02:05:56,135
I'm going to tell Neha!

1700
02:05:56,219 --> 02:05:57,260
Listen to me first!

1701
02:05:57,501 --> 02:06:00,635
- "Soldier Soldier"
- "Who with his sweet talks..."

1702
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,641
Shameless! You too?!...

1703
02:06:03,044 --> 02:06:05,427
- And that too with my Max?!
- He's Dharamputra!

1704
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:07,594
Max. How could you do this?

1705
02:06:07,719 --> 02:06:09,531
- You cheat.
- You are-

1706
02:06:09,677 --> 02:06:12,510
- Kriti.
- What is going on?

1707
02:06:12,594 --> 02:06:14,885
What do you mean by what's going on?
I am trying to tell you!

1708
02:06:14,969 --> 02:06:16,927
Max doesn't belong to you,
he belongs to me.

1709
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:19,635
Max doesn't belong to you,
he belongs to Neha.

1710
02:06:19,719 --> 02:06:21,510
- And you belong to me...
- Revenge!

1711
02:06:21,594 --> 02:06:23,177
What revenge, man?! Let me
explain everything to her first!

1712
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,802
Take your stupid revenge
after I explain everything to her!

1713
02:06:32,346 --> 02:06:34,135
Wait a minute!

1714
02:06:34,427 --> 02:06:35,510
Look at this girl.

1715
02:06:35,667 --> 02:06:36,594
- Hit her.
- What?

1716
02:06:36,677 --> 02:06:37,719
- Smack her on the face!
- What?!

1717
02:06:37,802 --> 02:06:39,219
Give her a tight slap!
Give her a tight one!

1718
02:06:39,302 --> 02:06:40,805
- No.
- Hit her. Hit her, I'm holding her hands!

1719
02:06:41,011 --> 02:06:41,969
So exciting!

1720
02:06:42,562 --> 02:06:43,885
Go into a flashback!

1721
02:06:46,344 --> 02:06:47,427
Where have you reached?

1722
02:06:54,491 --> 02:06:56,094
Come back from your flashback!

1723
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,094
- Do you remember now?
- Bala.

1724
02:06:59,177 --> 02:06:59,969
Madhu

1725
02:07:00,635 --> 02:07:01,302
Bala.

1726
02:07:01,719 --> 02:07:02,385
Madhu

1727
02:07:03,302 --> 02:07:04,094
No!!

1728
02:07:06,469 --> 02:07:08,135
Harry you've started again!

1729
02:07:08,302 --> 02:07:10,260
Who told you to hit her again?

1730
02:07:13,759 --> 02:07:15,635
Gama can't see. Run!

1731
02:07:17,135 --> 02:07:18,177
Run!

1732
02:07:29,177 --> 02:07:30,969
I won't spare anyone.

1733
02:07:31,052 --> 02:07:32,677
Guys, what is going on?!

1734
02:07:42,094 --> 02:07:43,927
He is blind, but not deaf.

1735
02:07:44,802 --> 02:07:46,469
Don't make any noise.

1736
02:07:49,255 --> 02:07:50,219
Come on.

1737
02:07:51,094 --> 02:07:54,885
Keep coming
Keep coming

1738
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:08,745
You remember, he's blind not deaf!

1739
02:08:11,002 --> 02:08:13,677
- I am a wild dog!
- Come, don't make a sound

1740
02:08:21,594 --> 02:08:23,344
Now he has three knives in his bum!

1741
02:08:23,427 --> 02:08:24,677
Pull. Pull.

1742
02:08:24,927 --> 02:08:28,302
Don't twist. Don't twist.
You scoundrel!

1743
02:08:32,594 --> 02:08:33,719
Come, Michael Bhai

1744
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,302
Come, come

1745
02:08:51,469 --> 02:08:53,552
Slowly, slowly

1746
02:09:01,698 --> 02:09:03,136
Neil, Nitin, Mukesh!

1747
02:09:07,356 --> 02:09:08,100
Mukesh!

1748
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:10,594
Please don't make any noise!

1749
02:09:19,552 --> 02:09:22,719
- Hurry up!
- He got me right on the nerve!

1750
02:09:47,594 --> 02:09:50,094
Why is there so much silence here?!

1751
02:09:54,427 --> 02:09:56,552
It's a wedding, boss.

1752
02:09:57,802 --> 02:09:59,335
Calls for an explosion.

1753
02:10:00,344 --> 02:10:02,177
Michael Bhai is Suryabhan!

1754
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:04,469
What is going on?

1755
02:10:04,552 --> 02:10:07,385
- Please just shut up!
- Which is why Michael Bhai arrived...

1756
02:10:07,552 --> 02:10:09,844
...today instead of tomorrow.

1757
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:15,844
To see...whether you three
are getting married or not.

1758
02:10:16,885 --> 02:10:22,344
And to see...if someone's
trying to stop the wedding.

1759
02:10:23,177 --> 02:10:25,052
Hey overgrown moose...

1760
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:27,260
Bahubali's nephew.

1761
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,760
- Should I pull the pin?
- I'm Gama!

1762
02:10:31,052 --> 02:10:34,385
- GAMA!!!
- Leave me.

1763
02:10:39,344 --> 02:10:42,219
"I am a wild dog."

1764
02:10:42,802 --> 02:10:48,302
"I can sniff out the
traitor from the loyalist."

1765
02:10:58,219 --> 02:11:01,336
It's a good thing...you
shot this monster.

1766
02:11:01,677 --> 02:11:02,635
Yes Michael Sir!

1767
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:04,469
This monster made our lives hell.

1768
02:11:04,552 --> 02:11:05,219
Look...

1769
02:11:05,302 --> 02:11:07,344
He stabbed me four times.

1770
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:08,597
Filled my bum with holes.

1771
02:11:08,677 --> 02:11:10,510
You can use it to sieve flour.

1772
02:11:10,677 --> 02:11:11,760
I am in so much pain right now.

1773
02:11:11,885 --> 02:11:14,177
Can you please call a doctor?

1774
02:11:14,427 --> 02:11:16,260
Michael Bhai, you won't believe me,

1775
02:11:16,469 --> 02:11:19,344
but in your previous life you were...

1776
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:20,802
Suryabhan.

1777
02:11:21,219 --> 02:11:22,594
Yes!

1778
02:11:22,796 --> 02:11:23,969
I remember everything.

1779
02:11:24,844 --> 02:11:25,594
Look and learn!

1780
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,969
You should take lessons from him.

1781
02:11:27,135 --> 02:11:29,219
He just reached and
remembered everything.

1782
02:11:29,469 --> 02:11:33,260
Suryabhan! I've been chasing
her around the hotel for three days,

1783
02:11:33,344 --> 02:11:34,510
but she doesn't remember anything.

1784
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:36,760
All she keeps asking is...
"What's going on?

1785
02:11:36,927 --> 02:11:38,344
What's going on? What's going on? "

1786
02:11:38,424 --> 02:11:41,177
- We remember everything!
- Yes Suryabhan

1787
02:11:42,094 --> 02:11:44,219
We were supposed to get
married in our previous life.

1788
02:11:44,632 --> 02:11:46,302
But unfortunately...

1789
02:11:47,053 --> 02:11:49,971
the marriage dais fell
on us.

1790
02:12:00,052 --> 02:12:01,385
No Prince Bala!

1791
02:12:02,969 --> 02:12:04,302
Prince Bala?

1792
02:12:04,552 --> 02:12:07,677
600-years-ago the dais
didn't fall on its own.

1793
02:12:09,010 --> 02:12:10,594
Someone made it collapse.

1794
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:15,344
You killed my brother?

1795
02:12:15,844 --> 02:12:19,594
My revenge will be complete
after every single one of you is dead.

1796
02:12:19,677 --> 02:12:21,344
Make it fall! Make it fall!

1797
02:12:24,802 --> 02:12:27,585
Make it fall! Make it fall!

1798
02:12:38,383 --> 02:12:39,418
Yes, Bala.

1799
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:42,719
Our love was
left incomplete because of him.

1800
02:12:43,427 --> 02:12:46,594
It was him who killed us all and Gama.
Suryabhan!

1801
02:12:47,885 --> 02:12:48,844
Yes, it was me.

1802
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,260
I uprooted the pillars.

1803
02:12:52,302 --> 02:12:53,927
What are you going to do about it?

1804
02:12:54,344 --> 02:12:55,635
And I didn't just kill you guys...

1805
02:12:56,927 --> 02:12:59,177
...I even killed Gama's brother.

1806
02:13:08,714 --> 02:13:11,219
You killed Gama's brother!?

1807
02:13:11,576 --> 02:13:13,094
I killed Gama's brother.

1808
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:15,469
Prince Suryabhan. What are you saying?!

1809
02:13:15,552 --> 02:13:17,522
I killed Gama's brother.

1810
02:13:26,759 --> 02:13:28,427
Who the hell hits like that?

1811
02:13:28,747 --> 02:13:30,760
Michael's flat on the ground.

1812
02:13:32,427 --> 02:13:33,719
Attack!

1813
02:13:41,302 --> 02:13:43,094
Why did you take it out?

1814
02:13:43,232 --> 02:13:44,552
- Why did you take it out?
- Sorry.

1815
02:13:46,052 --> 02:13:48,485
- Why did you put it back in?
- Sorry!

1816
02:13:48,756 --> 02:13:51,969
You will kill me before
anybody else will, idiot!

1817
02:13:52,052 --> 02:13:53,219
Bala, are you okay?

1818
02:13:54,838 --> 02:13:56,639
- Come in front of me and ask!
- Sorry.

1819
02:13:56,719 --> 02:13:59,088
- Come in front of me and ask!
- Are you okay?

1820
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:01,052
Yes, I am fine.

1821
02:14:09,802 --> 02:14:11,052
This is Dharamputra's fist...

1822
02:14:11,135 --> 02:14:12,302
...not Max's.

1823
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:15,719
- Hi?
- Hi.

1824
02:14:16,427 --> 02:14:18,309
- Get ready for more
- And...I'm screwed again like London

1825
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:39,719
Wait! This isn't your job!

1826
02:14:56,594 --> 02:14:57,719
Prince Bala!

1827
02:14:58,010 --> 02:14:59,427
Fate works in mysterious ways.

1828
02:15:00,219 --> 02:15:01,177
Destiny.

1829
02:15:02,149 --> 02:15:04,177
600-years-later...

1830
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:06,760
Same old you,
same old me, and the same old place.

1831
02:15:08,802 --> 02:15:10,677
There is one thing about history that
you should know...

1832
02:15:11,427 --> 02:15:18,094
When it repeats itself, everyone
seems to be in the same position

1833
02:15:21,927 --> 02:15:24,010
There is something you should
know about fate too!

1834
02:15:25,635 --> 02:15:27,927
When fate completes a full circle...

1835
02:15:29,135 --> 02:15:32,344
...the tables turn on their own.

1836
02:15:47,469 --> 02:15:51,010
"REVENGE!"

1837
02:16:21,427 --> 02:16:22,922
Won't you hug your brother?

1838
02:16:26,524 --> 02:16:28,010
Hey, don't be scared I won't hurt you.

1839
02:16:28,094 --> 02:16:29,719
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure!

1840
02:16:32,885 --> 02:16:33,885
Peace!

1841
02:16:34,385 --> 02:16:36,469
Gama...won't kill.

1842
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:44,043
Don't cry children.

1843
02:16:44,385 --> 02:16:45,427
Don't cry.

1844
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:46,469
Let's go.

1845
02:16:46,635 --> 02:16:47,385
God bless.

1846
02:16:47,469 --> 02:16:48,885
- God bless you all.
- Bye daddy...

1847
02:16:51,552 --> 02:16:52,635
It's alright.

1848
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:54,427
Papa...

1849
02:16:55,347 --> 02:16:57,197
- No, no
- So cute..

1850
02:16:59,185 --> 02:17:01,135
Go children, take care.

1851
02:17:02,219 --> 02:17:04,052
Don't worry you can come
back after our first night.

1852
02:17:05,038 --> 02:17:06,743
No, no

1853
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:12,460
- Don't cry my darling
- It's okay.

1854
02:17:12,594 --> 02:17:13,677
Let's take daddy's girls instead.

1855
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,010
Come on.

1856
02:17:15,094 --> 02:17:16,135
Stay with your dad.

1857
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:17,719
Stay here and lay eggs!

1858
02:17:17,802 --> 02:17:19,177
Come on.
