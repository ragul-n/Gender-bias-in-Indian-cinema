[devotional song]

00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,919
'Losing mother at the age 4 years,
can be considered my bad luck.'

I loved at the age of 25?'

[loud scream]

13
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,114
'To know what I'm fighting for'

14
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,041
'you must know what
happened in my life 6 months ago'

LOVER

'Sampath is care of address for sinners
in Rayalaseema popular for pilgrimages'

00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,755
'He's the biggest idiot
I know since childhood.'

18
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,004
'It's good that we speak less about him.'

19
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,575
'If he lights a Cigar,
it indicates someone is at risk'

20
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,513
A journalist should write
something to provide for his home

21
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,670
but should he also sacrifice his life
this way by writing at his will?

22
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:26,510
'He's Jaggu, he's like a brother to me.'

23
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,416
'Whatever Sampath says
is like an order for him'

24
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:31,796
No. Don't do it.

25
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,200
Neither Jaggu asks for anything
nor Sampath says something.

26
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,622
Jaggu takes it as friendship
as they grew up together.

27
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:42,669
But I see Sampath's selfishness in it.

28
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:47,075
Why didn't you wash the knife? Is it to
show and pose at your wife? Go and wash it

29
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:52,116
He stabs and I wash it,
how long do I endure this bro?

30
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:55,072
Hey, idiots do curse
while they get stabbed.

31
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,840
Curses of people dying are very powerful.

32
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:02,383
Neither should a word escape the victim's
mouth nor should he swallow anything.

33
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,122
[car starts]

34
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,991
She's Sweety, Jaggu's daughter.

35
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:20,200
I'll take you to task if you spill
the milk. Sit and drink them.

36
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,158
She's my sister in law.
She could be termed as a Goddess.

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,168
We got to pay her fees.
They've been sending notice.

38
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,372
Haven't we just paid recently?

39
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,616
That was the first term fee.
We should pay the second term fee.

40
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,075
Okay let's see.

41
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:34,908
They always take the last place among
the people brother feels are his own.

42
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,241
He notices them only after the
whole village is taken care of.

43
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,375
Sister-in-law.

44
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,491
Here's Sweety's fee receipt.

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,866
Why do you do this now?
Can't we take care?

46
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:54,908
Hello, don't feel too bad.
These aren't for you, but for me.

47
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:58,283
I've grown up without
knowing what's a family.

48
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:02,715
I shall give the happiness I missed from
childhood to my kids in double... triple..

49
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:04,547
make it ten times.

50
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,455
-This is just a rehearsal for that. Okay?
-Uncle!

51
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:08,638
This is my life ambition.

52
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,213
[welding crackles]

53
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,575
Finally I'm Raj.

54
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,645
Not just this city...
No... No...

55
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:21,552
I'm one of the best customized
motor bike builder in this state.

57
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,672
[vrooming]

58
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,658
I love romancing bikes.

59
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,168
Why do I need a bike designed
by someone for someone?

60
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,892
I'll design it according to my likes.

61
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,366
Be it a bike or life.

62
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:25,523
He's my friend Radha,
my technical support.

63
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,456
He's now developing a program to
start the bike using a mobile phone.

64
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:33,911
[sprays]

65
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,178
[motorcycle starts]
Hey!

66
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,238
Yes! Got it.

67
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,867
What's this? Will it start by touch?
-It didn't start because you touched it.

68
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,317
-It started as I touched this.
-Oh!

69
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,283
What's this dude? This technological
advancement is surprising!

70
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,575
This is nothing. You know,
a car can be started without a key

71
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,950
and steering can be handled without
being in the car and apply the brakes too?

72
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:01,741
Super dude

73
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:06,280
Above all, we can adjust money
from our idiot for the Bangkok trip

74
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:09,727
[tyres screech]

75
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,288
Biryani for breakfast?
[indistinct dog barking]

76
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:16,033
Who's the idiot who cooked
biryani early in the morning?

77
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,953
That's yesterday's left over.
I left it for the dogs.

78
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,766
Maybe the dog didn't eat it. So he is.

79
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:23,643
Hey. How many times do I tell
you not to feed biryani to dogs?

80
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,661
Okay, I'll feed you from tomorrow.

81
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,200
Hey Udalu...

82
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:36,450
Where did you disappear Raj?
It's been long since you're seen

83
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,616
Settle my account.

84
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:39,158
What?

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,606
I've seen a lot of such funny tricks. I'm
asking the amount for the bike I gave you.

86
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,950
-What I should get.
-What I gave is more than enough.

87
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:49,337
You make bikes out of scrap and ask
for money as if it's from the showroom.

88
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,337
'Settle my account".
Even I want the account settled.

89
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,575
I'm an idiot to have come to
speak with him. Dirty rascal...

90
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,075
How much do you need?

91
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:03,442
Bro, this is not gambling to
look at the other's game first.

92
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:04,705
This is life.

93
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,672
Anyway what he gives
you itself is peanuts.

94
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,345
How can you run your home
if you keep donating that?

95
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,991
I'll take care of that and you take this

96
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,789
What did you say? Peanuts?

97
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,402
Do you mean Jaggu is working
with me without paying him?

98
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,364
What if not?

99
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,981
Whats the payment for the ones who
work hard and for the useless ones?

100
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,335
Come here.

101
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,613
Doesn't he know how to work?
You think he is brainless?

102
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,404
How many times did you
see Akhari Poratam film?

103
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,283
-25 times.
-For what?

104
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,700
In the climax fight, my heartthrob
Sridevi collides her truck into a flight.

105
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,518
She jumps after the
blast and dies falling down.

106
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,685
She already knows it would blast once.

107
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,483
So I used to watch if she could
jump a bit earlier atleast once.

108
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,346
But she jumps after the blast
everytime and dies falling down.

109
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,053
I got pissed off and stopped watching it.

110
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,658
-Dumb idiot... go.
-Wouldn't she live if she jumped early?

111
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,354
You come here. Ask him.

112
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,894
Which is heavier among a Kilo
of iron and a Kilo of cotton?

113
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,110
-Tell him.
-It's iron.

114
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,483
Ain't it bro? How could cotton be
heavier than iron? Iron is heavier.

115
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:02,463
[chuckles]

116
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:03,565

He is of no use to us.
Let's sell it out.

119
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,075
Hey, just wait. Move aside

120
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,229
You did it great, how much does it cost?

121
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:30,200
25 thousand.

122
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:31,805
-He's paying money for Bangkok.
-Here, take it.

123
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,450
I think I paid a little too much.

124
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:40,561
-Where's the key?
-This doesn't have a key.

125
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,741
Either to start or stop it,
it's all with this phone.

126
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,575
-Give the phone
-Phone is a bit costly.

127
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,200
-Huh, how much does that cost?
-It's a Lakh.

128
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,325
One Lakh, smart start!

as if to ask for donations for a festival?

wouldn't he have understood who we are?

Go...

172
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:06,450
We thought well for the whole
night and have got two offers for you.

173
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,369
If you leave that Sampath and come to us,

174
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,288
you're next to uncle... I mean brother.

175
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:18,582
If you say that's not possible,
you can neither work there nor here.

177
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,158
Huh... Hey!

178
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,325
Didn't we ask that boy to leave?
Why is he coming back?

179
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:36,033
We asked you to leave right?
Did you forget something?

180
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:40,075
Look dude, give him what he needs
and send him. We've got to settle things.

181
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:44,283
-You go bro.
-Am I Sampath to leave you like that?

182
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,991
If you are here,
who would drop me at the airport? Come on.

183
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,900
Oh! What's this mess?

184
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,728
Guys, this looks to be
a headache, take a look.

185
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,050
Huh, why do you look at each other?
Go and look into his matter.

Come on, what's this man?
Haven't you been in the morning?

189
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,700
Just manage for two minutes bro,
I'll just be back

190
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,616
Keep talking for two minutes.
I'll just be back.

191
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:14,950
Hey, I don't need tea now.
It's time for my flight, we'll leave.

192
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,783
Why do you look at his face? Don't you
have the bats? Bash him up.

193
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:23,450

Is that kick boxing dude?
-My feet are frying due to the heat bro.

197
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,825
Why do you tell your
troubles when you have to bash him?

198
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,533
Here, buy slippers.

199
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,866
-What about me?
-He'll give you. Go to him.

200
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:52,283
-Mommy!
-You go guys.

201
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:58,659
Hey idiot, what're you doing?
Hit him on the face.

202
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,730
Don't wait till I come, come on hit him.

203
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,749
Be the man that you say! Go!

204
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:09,866
It's my turn now. No...

205
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,572

Oh no!

207
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,116
Hey. Finish him man.

208
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,741
It's fun when we have a working
gun at the end of a fight man!

209
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,750
You don't shoot words when you
got a gun in hands scum bag.

210
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:31,920
It's the bullets.

211

[gunfires]

212
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:39,866
Oh no, he shot me in the arm pit.

The dirty rascal ruined my shirt.

215
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,283
Why am I feeling the pain
when it's him who got shot?

216
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,908
Oh god! Is it me who was shot?

217
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:59,450
You idiot, to hell with
your gun. Damn you!

218
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,464
It's a country bullet.
Let's go to the hospital.

219
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,668
Bro, there would hospitals in Bangkok too.
Just drop me at the airport.

220
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,575
Bullets are not
allowed in the airport bro.

221
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:10,830
Doctor!

222
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,908
-Hey, why are you shouting?
-Where's the Doc? It's an emergency

223
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,294
-What's this?
-I got shot.

224
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,825

-He's coming behind!

225
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,575
-What's this?
-It's a waiting token.

226
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,727
What do I wait for?
I've got a flight to board!

227
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,397
Hey! Where are you going?

228
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,708

We'll take care. Let's go.

231
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,429
Take his CBP, shift him to the ward
and keep him in observation for a day.

232
00:16:58,757 --> 00:16:59,336
Okay ma'am.

233
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,007
-I don't want the injection.
-Why are you scared?

234
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:15,417
-How any times do I tell you?
-Wait a minute.

235
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:20,373
God! I was supposed to be in Bangkok.

236
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,635
You threw me here on a hospital bed.

237
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,142
Hell with my life.

238
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:26,967
-Hi Lakshmi.
-Hi sister.

239
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,162
Where's the patient on this bed?

240
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,075
The time my dream came
before my eyes wearing a white dress.

241
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,450
Okay.

242
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,200
Temperature is fine.
Did you take the tablets?

243
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,836
I don't want tablets, I'll have tonic.

244
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:01,908
I'll give you a chocolate
if you take the tablets.

245
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,962
-Promise me?
-It's a promise.

247
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,220
-Hello!
-Baby, try it once again.

248
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,961
Mom. I'm at the hospital.

249
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,472
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

250
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,491
-Malayalam?
-Yes, Malayalam.

251
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,450

253
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:33,616
Is every Malayali a Jessi?
She's not a Christian!

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,241

[music]

256
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,328
If it weren't for you,
my husband wouldn't be alive.

257
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,478
How would we have known these matters
madam? We can't forget your help.

258
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:22,075
Whats my greatness in this? Being elders
you should bless me, not join hands.

259
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:23,866
Oh dear girl!

260
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,369
Are they her relatives?

261
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,758
-We will take leave.
-Okay.

262
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:36,200
Relatives of Charita ma'am? Not just them,
everyone in the hospital are her relatives

263
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,645
Anyone would help by giving
10 to 20% of their salary.

264
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:43,340
But she gives away her whole
salary if someone is in troubles.

265
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:44,716
Isn't it surprising?

266
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,758
Isn't it great that the god who created
people like us created that girl too?

267
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:51,096
What did you say?

268
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,450
Isn't it great that the god who created
people like us created that girl too?

269
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,825
I'm done with you, you can leave.

270
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,542
-I'll give medicine in time as you said.
-Good morning sir.

00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:08,967
-It's time for the bus, we'll go now ma'am
-Is it? Ok

274
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,180
The operation would be in this
week. You may get a call anytime.

275
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:12,987
Ok madam.

276
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:16,283
-Meet the Doctor before you leave, ok?
-Ok madam

-I'll stab you.
-Oh no.

282
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,083
No. Ask her to come. Come on.

283
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,750
That fellow...

284
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,750
What's wrong, any problem?

285
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:55,691
Doctor: Helper! Get the stretcher. We've
got to shift the patient to the ward.

286
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,541

288
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:13,250
BP is high. You've been through
just a minor surgery, okay?

289
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,458
So, don't worry.

290
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:19,000
Take both of them now,
and this one after lunch, okay?

291
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,625
No, those are to be taken
after meal. It's this one now.

292
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:32,924
No, it's this one bro.

293
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,771
She told me bro. It's this one.

294
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:38,003
What's the confusion for?
Call that girl, she would give it herself.

295
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,833
Please come to my bro. He needs
your guidance in taking the pills.

296
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,708
He's not much educated, so got confused.

297
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,458
Good.

298
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,083
-Bro, call that girl once.
-Is it fun for you?

299
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,000
Really bro, it's paining. Oh God.

300
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:12,250
Looks like stitches broke loose.
Please call her once bro.

301
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,402
My brother says it's paining.

302
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:30,884
Near the stitches.

303
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:37,125
Anesthesia is fading. So there would
be some pain. Nothing to worry, okay?

[mobile game sound]

305
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,570
Bro.

306
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,187
Bro! Call her once.

307
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:55,625
I'm here as I thought you were weak. You
look to be hyper active. I can't bear it.

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,333
-I'm leaving
-Brother!

309
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,958

-You shouldn't move.
-Actually...

314
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:21,028
As the doctor asked me to
be under your observation.

315
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:26,291
Look, he asked us to observe you.
Not that you should observe us.

316
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,286
Hey man! It's your hand that's
injured. your legs are fine.

317

You boulder!

318
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:44,039
-Where did your brother go?
-He left on some important work doctor.

319
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,887
-Oh no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a sister.

320
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:48,321
-No!

321
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:54,333
-What's wrong?
-Are you and sis... That's for the world

322
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,041

I mean

324
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:01,386
-You're the doctor who checks my heartbeat
-Ok

325
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,575
Doctor, you please stay right here.
I'm very scared.

-Shhh. Take rest.

328
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,768
Doctor, will you check the BP?

329
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:26,157
-I mean, it's been a long time
-Not needed. Didn't I give you tablets?

00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:31,500
I'm sweating. There's a napkin in
the bag, can you give it please?

It's time the Doctor comes
on rounds. I need to go. Please.

335
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,500
Doctor!

336
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:03,849
Why are we drinking on a
hospital dude? Okay, open it.

337
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,000
What a girl dude? Mind blowing!

338
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,923
I never expected such a girl
would come into my life dude

339
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:14,599
Why are you getting so much excited?
Is the girl so good looking?

340
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,380
-No idea, I haven't seen her.
-Yeah.

341
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,252
No one among us have seen her.

342
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,625
None of you have seen her. Kindness of
Mother Teresa, beauty of Angelina Jolie

343
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey...
Ain't it a bit too much?

344
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,708
-Not at all.
-He's onto her.

345
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,750
Earlier when I heard the stories of great
lovers, I thought they were exaggerating.

346
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,833
But now I say that's no exaggeration.

347
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm feeling what they felt back then.

348
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,300
[music]

349
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:45,004
Where did he vanish?

350
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:17,708
"Is the naughty dream in
me facing me in your form?"

351
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,750
"Has some love trap pulled me?"

352
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:40,558
"Is the naughty dream in
me facing me in your form?"

353
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:46,166
"Has some love trap pulled me?"

354
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,774
"These thoughts in heart are like
uncontrollable naughtiness"

355
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:57,675
"What's this sweet pain like a
silence unable to carry words"

356
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:03,775
[music]

357
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:48,583
"Such a big cyclone in me and
so much noise in the heart"

358
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:54,208
"I'm escaping from expressing as
its trouble for me to reveal"

359
00:27:54,675 --> 00:28:00,000
"The distance in between us
is just a step if measured"

360
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:04,796
"I'm unable to cross it as if
life is filled in that one step"

361
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,786
"Shall I build a bridge between
us with the four letters of LOVE?"

362
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:16,587
"Shall I write you a love letter
joining the stars in the sky?"

363
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:20,482
[glass shatters]

364
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:33,541
"Is the naughty dream in
me facing me in your form?"

365
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,103
"Has some love trap pulled me?"

366
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:44,777
"These thoughts in heart are
like uncontrollable naughtiness"

367
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:50,600
"What's this sweet pain like a
silence unable to carry words"

[bulb flickering]

370
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:33,327
He's been screaming and hallucinating
the whole night. No one slept.

371
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:37,000
Send him out of here
somehow madam, please.

372
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,381
-Hey, get up you!
-Darling!

373
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,166
Whom are you calling
darling? You get up first.

374
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,958
Why is everything misplaced?

375
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,285
-What happened?
-All this was done by you.

376
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,166
-Oh no! Looks like I was high lst night.
-What did you say?

377
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:59,208
I mean that might be a reaction
of Anesthesia and Antibiotics.

378
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,408
Ok come Doctor, you got to check my BP.

379
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:03,771
My BP has gone high without your touch.

380
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,452
Hello, you've been discharged.
You can leave now.

381
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,438
Discharged? How can they do that?

382
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:09,674
You are not my headache anymore.

383
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,083
Oh no. Doctor, don't say so please.

384
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,708
What if something happens after I go out?
Who is responsible? Tell me your honour?

385
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,092
My responsibility is only
up to in patient ward.

386
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,141
Though you have no
responsibility as a Doctor,

387
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:25,605
As a lover... I mean as a patient
I'll be only under your observation.

388
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,583
Did she give you a chocolate?

389
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,041
They wouldn't. We shouldn't trust them.

390
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,125
You see mine and I'll see his

391
00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:54,432
One, two, three, four, five, six... Stop!

392
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:55,250
Huh?

393
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,291
We've completed the seven steps. No one
can separate us for seven births now.

394
00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:06,083
You'll lose your job if he's
seen in the surroundings again.

395
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:13,133
[music]

396
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:18,590
Thanks sister.

397
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,666
-Isn't mom here yet?
-Today is double shift and she'll be late.

398
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,873
How many days should I be here more?

399
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:28,115
Doctor did say that you can leave soon.

400
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,137
Poor mom!

401
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:34,232
She goes to Rani Madam's house in the
morning, then to Latha sister's house,

402
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:38,875
she comes home after finishing
work there, gives me breakfast,

403
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,708
sends me to school and
then leave for factory work

404
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,416
I should study well and be
helpful to mom soon.

405
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,416
-Sister.
-Yeah.

406
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:56,291
That uncle had been taking your name for
the whole night. I think he likes you.

407
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,911
You don't know these things.
He's just a patient.

408
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,291
A doctor who can't love a patient
is also equal to a patient, doctor.

409
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,625
-Security!
-Oh no, what's with you man?

410
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:06,367
-Come on.
-Hey.

411
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:07,750
-Move.
-Hey!

412
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,791
-Did you note the vitals of patient?
-Yeah I did.

413
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,750
Please bear for a while.

414
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,796
How are you? When did you come here?

415
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:19,446
We came in the morning.

416
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:24,500
His asthma has increased.
He is unable to move even his feet.

417
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,833
I thought of showing him
once to the doctor once.

418
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:27,541
Okay.

419
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,306
But the operation should
have been done already?

420
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,960
None informed us madam.

421
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,708
One minute

422
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,882
-Sir.
-Yeah.

423
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,396
Actually this person
should've been operated next.

424
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,208
How could they operate someone
else who is far behind in the list?

425
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,534
Maybe she didn't turn up at
the given appointment time.

426
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:00,890
So can we sit without
handling another surgery?

427
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,559
Maybe the next person
in order was operated.

428
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:07,541
-I asked them. They said no one called.
-What shall I do for that?

429
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,041
Aren't you the in-charge sir?
Ain't it your responsibility?

430
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:19,291
Are you teaching me responsibility?
I'm MBBS, FRCS and a senior surgeon.

431
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:23,215
You're a nurse after all.
Mind your own business.

432
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:25,472
Do you think this is a
hospital or a market?

433
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:28,498
She's talking without even
considering my seniority.

434
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:30,054
Charitha.

435
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,975
-This isn't how behave with your superiors
-Sir

436
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:37,141
-Apologise to him.
-Sir, they operated somebody instead him.

437
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,125
-What if something happens to him?
-Shut up.

438
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,958
Am I not here to take care
if some mistake takes place?

439
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,896
Do ask her in that way, sir.

440
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:47,097
She is talking like we're into some
business here instead of operating.

441
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,578
I should suspend you for
your reckless behavior,

442
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,797
But I'm leaving you as
this is your first time.

443
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:55,198
-Now, get out from here
-Sir

444
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,208
You get out from here
first. I'll look into this.

445
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,666
-Why do you mess with these seniors dear?
-There is some mistake happening.

00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,093
-Do they serve Vodka to the visitors?
-It is not Vodka.

450
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,503
It's water. It costs 2000 bucks per litre.

451
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:43,358
-They spend 2000 bucks to drink?
-It's just to wash their face.

452
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:50,191
Sir, central Minister is calling
-Tell him I'm at Varadarajulu Sir's house.

453
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:02,483
I'll make him call sir.

454
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,660
Sir, I need your blessings.

455
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:15,044
It's my daughter's wedding.
If you agree, I will get my kids...

456
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,236
Ow!

457
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:28,532
[snip]

458
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:33,733
What man? Do you think this is like the
normal blood dripping from your hand?

459
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,275
It isn't available even in 10 out of
Ten Lakh people after searching hard.

460
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,150
How carefully should you
deal with such a rare blood?

461
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,025
Hey, leave him

462
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:46,066
Why do you get tensed
for such a small matter?

463
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:50,191
Nothing related to you is a
small matter for me uncle.

464
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,983
Good Morning Sir..

465
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:12,275
His health is deteriorating. It's safe
if we that operate him the earliest

466
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,025
How far has that donor search come?

467
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:18,114
[phone ringing]

468
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:20,608
-Hello
-How far did it come?

469
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:21,309
Sir,

470
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:27,463
our people have been intensely
searching from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.

471
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,524
It's rare blood group.

472
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:34,804
So you'll listen to a good
news in a week at the most.

473
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:35,510
Good

474
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:37,325
Sir... Sir.

475
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:42,025
The amount you sent is spent sir.

476
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,108
If this financial help is strong,
we can speed up even this search process

477
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:51,558
Don't think about the amount. My
father-in-law's life is important to me.

478
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:57,275
Oh no, should you say that again?
You'll listen to good news in a week.

479
00:36:57,525 --> 00:36:59,066
-It's confirmed
-Okay.

480
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,906
-Ok, what about that donor?
-As I told you...

481
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,616
...the donor is not legally eligible.

482
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:10,941
So, we can illegally give slow poison,
make the brain dead and start our work

483
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,566
That will take some time.

484
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,171
I see.

485
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:23,150
What's the matter dude?
You asked to assemble urgently

486
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,658
-Drink called us.
-Its before us.

487
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,265
-Raju's love story is become a mess
-Should we have a peg or not?

488
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,737
Should we have a peg or not?

489
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:38,721
-Babe said get lost in Malayalam.
-Raju's fuse is out listening to that.

490
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:44,066
-And we've come to helping in that.
-Then what's this crap instead of sipping?

491
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,358
-Should we have a peg or not?
-Stop it rascals.

492
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:49,144
Give me some idea to love.

493
00:37:49,548 --> 00:37:53,265
If the ideas have to come out, this
should go in. Come on, let's have it.

494
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,101
Don't behave like
parents of greed, please.

495
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:58,997
Idea dude

496
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:02,165
Girls are mad about brands these days.

497
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:05,073
You wear branded clothes from top
to bottom and move in front of her.

498
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:07,483
-Let's see why will that girl not love you
-Correct

499
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,733
-Hey, I'm not looking for a branding
-Then?

500
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:12,566
-For a bonding in between us.
-Then you must watch James Bond films.

501
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:13,441
Next.

502
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,292
Write 'I Love you
Charitha' on a big ballon

503
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:18,910
and hoist it high in air
at our clock tower junction

504
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:20,885
Love is in the air dude,
she will fall immediately.

505
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,302
[chuckles]
This is awesome.

506
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:25,900
She already feels I'm a vagabond. You
don't give me such cheap ideas again.

507
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:32,025
Hey, will a vehicle in neutral
move even if on full throttle?

508
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:33,775
It's similar telling my matter to you.

509
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,647
That's why I called
Nelson to be on a safe side

510
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,413
Who, that black Seenu?
Is his name Nelson now?

511
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:40,976
He should come and move the vehicle now.

512
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:42,816
-He's the only flirt king of our batch.
-Ask him to.

513
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,086
Darling, I came for a small meeting.

514
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,124
-I'll catch you later. Yes.
-Okay darling. Bye.

515
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,186
Muah!

516
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:54,941
Sweet heart, keep it when I say.
Speaker.

517
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,612
-Darling, keep it now.-Okay bye.

518
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:00,961
-Keep it now.-Bye.

519
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,919
[disconnected tone]
Did you get it that way?

520
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:04,560
[chuckles]

521
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,108
What do you guys know about
the sweet problems of lovers?

522
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:09,983
-Damn, move
-Thank you

523
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,108
-Why are the waste boys idle?
-As he's not serving the drink

524
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,861
You should build a
bridge to my love matter.

525
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,668
I'll even paint it,
say what's the matter?

526
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,499
What is it now?

527
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:23,098
-That girl should be tamed aint it?
-Yes

528
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,836
What would you get engaging
with these fools in girls matter?

529
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:28,484
At least the work will be done catching
up with professional flirts like me.

530
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,228
Oh no, she looks like a
boy is dressed up as a girls

531
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,107
he's giving a show like he has
hoisted a flag on Everest by wooing her.

532
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:36,965
[laughing]
Oh no!

533
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,376
Why are you not laughing?

534
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:42,455
Fearing that the drink might spill.

535
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:44,066
-It won't, smile
-Stop it guys

536
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,051
I didn't put the drink
before you to dance

537
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:46,787
Then?

538
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:47,983
To make my love matter step ahead

539
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:50,026
-Hey Nelson.
-No tension.

540
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,592
I don't know what you do.

541
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,893
Bring her to Coffee
Day one day. Just once.

542
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,093
I'll take care of rest of the story.

543
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,233
Oh no, my head is breaking dude.
Stop somewhere and we shall have tea.

544
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:00,983
-Hey
-What?

545
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,900
I'm thinking how to get her for coffee,
what's with the tea now?

546
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:07,650
She'll come running as and when you
call as you are the Prince of Nepal

547
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,183
Brain should work sharply
to convince girls, dude.

548
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:12,128
That's why we'll have a
tea and go, stop here.

549
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,505
Hey, sugar is less.

550
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:26,367
[music]

551
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:40,316
-Hey.
-Yes.

552
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:44,023
When someone is in love,
just his lover looks beautiful.

553
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,521
But why is every girl
looking like Miss World to me?

554
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:51,610
Hey, people get so getting bored of
wives after seven years of marriage.

555
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:53,902
Why are you doing so just
after seven days of love?

556
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:59,191
-You think this is any weakness?
-That is...

557
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,191
Damn it! You'll go blind.
Are you doubting my love?

558
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:09,858
I'll not move even an inch even when a
hundred such beauties come and tempt me.

559
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:12,650
You said you won't move an inch,
but went in a jet speed.

560
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,802
[music]

561
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:22,805
I have a doubt.

562
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:27,234
when someone is in love,
just his lover looks beautiful.

563
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,424
But why do I feel you
look like Miss World?

564
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:34,478
Kindly don't misunderstand me.

565
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:38,222
I'm already in love.
There, my love stays in that hostel.

566
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,052
As you disturbed me
being in such deep love,

567
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:43,576
I couldn't stop complimenting your beauty.
That's all.

568
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:45,691
-I feel I have seen you somewhere.
-Sister, your bag.

569
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:49,775
What are you here? Where's my darling?

570
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:05,608
Gods must be crazy dude.
Is it you? Why are you like this?

571
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:08,608
She will be that way.
Do you know now? Leave her now.

572
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:16,400
Bro, your sister is making
me go mad in the modern dress

573
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:22,066
I'm already fix and now seeing
like this I'm fix like Fevicol

574
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:24,150
-Oh God, I'm fixed.
-Yes, you are right.

575
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,525
Doctor...

576
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,460
I know why you are following me.

577
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,711
Look, I have no belief in love at first
sight or love on the first day of meeting

578
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:38,108
And if you still follow me,
I even get irritated.

579
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,608
-Why have you said so?
-What else will someone say then?

580
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,525
What did you just say?
I'm making you go crazy in modern dress?

581
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:46,900
What opinion will someone
have on such people?

582
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:49,816
Whats the big thing about opinion?
One incident is enough for that to change.

583
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,951
We are born one day
and die on another day.

584
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:57,870
Similarly we change our self after some
incident. So, opinion can change any time.

585
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,983
Ok, you come once for coffee with me.
Maybe opinion on me might change

586
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:06,650
What if it doesn't change?

587
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:10,733
You should never disturb me again.

588
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:26,441
Come on

589
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:33,733
-Coffee
-Haven't you've called for the same?

590
00:43:35,816 --> 00:43:37,191
-Hey!
-Oh no

591
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,775
-Come here
-Don't shout so bro

592
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:42,733
Okay. When did I shout?

593
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:44,566
-Shut up
-Ok

594
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,441
-Order please sir.
-Two coffee.

595
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,941
-Regular or large sir?
-Bring large and we can sip for long

596
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:55,733
You need any extra cream Sir?
Any particular flavour Sir?

597
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,066
Mix something you wish but it
should be like coffee, that's it

598
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:00,816
-Ok sir.
-Go.

599
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,445
-Sir, is your order done?
-What do I do?

600
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:06,601
He is telling me a grocery
list when I ordered coffee.

601
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:08,816
Okay, focus.

602
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,608
Keep watching the girl

603
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,150
Keep looking into her eyes.

604
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:20,400
-Huh, she's not seeing me.
-You should make her see you bro.

605
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:23,025
-What's the matter?
-Hey says she's not seeing him

606
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:25,525
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'll go and tell her to see

607
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:29,358
-Sit, I'm here right?
-Ok

608
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:35,858
Now, put your hands on the
table and take them close to her

609
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:40,358
-It may not look good dude
-Come on do it dude, do what I say

610
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,816
Just do like she sees and
not like doing something

611
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,900
Put both your legs
straight towards the girl

612
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,263
What's this dude?

613
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,628
Put the hands forward,
legs out, hold the breath.

614
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:56,978
Are you making him do any Yoga poses?

615
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,358
-Wait, I'll look into their matter.
-Hey!

616
00:45:03,941 --> 00:45:06,816
To the respected sir, have you just come?

617
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,191
Best couple. Yes I'm
saying it, best couple

618
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:18,316
You're like made for each other madam

619
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,191
Sorry, I keep saying
it out whatever I feel.

620
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:22,805
Sir is our regular customer.

621
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:25,053
He's brought many girls here before
but you are the perfect match.

622
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,983
-Go on. To tell more about sir,
-Sir.

623
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:33,858
-Someone's calling you at table number two
-Which idiot will call me?

624
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:38,108
-Yes, they're calling me. Move
-Please come

625
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,233
See you madam.

626
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:47,691
Bro, now put your finger in
her hairs and rotate slowly.

627
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,900
-What?
-Do what I said bro.

628
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,816
-She may hit me.
-She'll fall for you bro.

629
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:07,493
Do you feel something?

630
00:46:07,863 --> 00:46:10,649
I feel it's better to show
you to some psychiatrist.

631
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:14,608
I've a known Doctor and
will take the appointment

632
00:46:20,025 --> 00:46:22,150
-Girl
-Oh no, why are you hitting me?

633
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,483
Do I come with girls, idiot?

634
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:27,275
Come on dude, they come
with girls to such places.

635
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:30,358
I increased the dose thinking your
image may damage. Is it any wrong?

636
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,941
-Come on bro, leave it
-Oh no

637
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:34,430
Idiot, should stare into her eyes?

638
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,271
Should I put fingers in hairs?

639
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,687
As if you're an international
flirt and should I follow you?

640
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:41,358
Actually what... Oh no, I'll say...

641
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,829
Actually the page changed as
phone fell down because of him.

642
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:46,908
That is actually the technique
for girls to make boys flat

643
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:49,316
-It's just a communication problem.
-Communication problem?

644
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:52,691
You've completely ruined it rascals. Damn!

645
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:58,148
Why's do all of this?
Won't you find another girl? Why me?

646
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:03,900
If you ask me why not
just me but none knows it.

647
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:09,025
Each boy has some voltage fluctuation in
his body when he sees a particular girl.

648
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:14,108
And then, he'll not understand
what and why he does something

649
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,733
He'll not set right until that girl
comes and sets the fuse right again

650
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:20,941
They switch on the main and say marriage
and then the meter runs round fast

651
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,269
You get such a long bill and
transformer will blast seeing that.

652
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:25,070
What do you say madam?

653
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:28,733
You said last time.

654
00:47:29,438 --> 00:47:32,108
I will give the respect and value
who the people standing on word

655
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:38,025
Will you come again?

656
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,858
Hey,
have you come to set y love or to cut it?

657
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:42,775
You rascals...

658
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,691
Sorry bro, facts came in flow.
Don't think otherwise

659
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:46,275
Facts?

660
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,941
Oh no, bro why are you hitting me?

661
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,900
I didn't do anything and
why are you hitting me?

662
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:54,033
You didn't do anything,
why couldn't you do something?

663
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,675
Did we quit smoking as
they said it in films?

664
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,716
Will we stop meeting when the girl
we loved asked to stop meeting?

665
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:03,550
What's wrong Sir?

666
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:06,758
That is... Baby has a small problem

667
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:07,841
What's the problem?

668
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:08,841
She's here

669
00:48:09,175 --> 00:48:10,883
This Doctor is fine for us, you carry on

670
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:18,425
What?

671
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:20,716
I came for the baby, Doctor

672
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:23,091
I'm not the Doctor but sister

673
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:23,633
No..

674
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:25,841
Sorry, it became a habit.

675
00:48:25,925 --> 00:48:28,383
You are sister for all but a Doctor for me

676
00:48:31,383 --> 00:48:32,091
What's wrong dear?

677
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:36,341
That is... fever. She got fever

678
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:39,008
That was in last month, right uncle?

679
00:48:40,758 --> 00:48:43,758
I mean, she's not eating food
now as she had fever last month.

680
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,966
Have a look please..
She's bringing back everything sent.

681
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,841
Here...

682
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:52,892
It's not my lunch time yet, and you
brought me before that. [indistinct siren]

683
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:56,740
That is...

684
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:00,200
Doctor...Emergency Doctor..

685
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:01,966
Emergency Doctor..

686
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:08,008
Doctor, heavy bleeding... Head injury

687
00:49:10,716 --> 00:49:13,508
Get admission written urgently
for him and he must be operated

688
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:15,383
Where are the people of him?

689
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:18,425
Oh, who is he?

690
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,466
Hit and run case Sir, he was on the roads

691
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,841
He's got a head injury and we
shall operate him urgently.

692
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,550
You go and sign on the surety papers

693
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:28,508
You know what's surety right?

694
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,258
Whatever happens to him,
complete responsibility is yours

695
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,675
You go and call the Police at the outpost

696
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:36,088
Sir, my boss doesn't accept
even for a minute delay.

697
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:38,374
He would fire me if I say such things.

698
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:40,758
Please sir,
you do something and save him sir

699
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,341
Brother please...

700
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:45,383
See, they bring and leave.

701
00:49:45,758 --> 00:49:46,550
What can we do?

702
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:47,841
Pull him to a side

703
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:50,675
Doctor, please.
We can't him like that. He'll die.

704
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,050
If needed I'll give that surety Doctor.

705
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:55,758
Staff is not eligible

706
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:04,258
When I can't do anything when a
life is going in front of my eyes,

707
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,341
why are these jobs for us?

708
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,425
I'll give that surety

709
00:50:23,258 --> 00:50:24,591
Do you know what a surety is?

710
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:26,385
I'll take care of whatever happens

711
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:32,655
[music]

712
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:40,383
Hey, you signed in emotion for
the impression of that girl.

713
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,341
That case is a risk it seems.

714
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,383
Maybe this is a risk,
why do we need all this?

715
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,758
I felt can take any risk dude.

716
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,716
But seeing just one drop
of tear in her eyes...

717
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:57,508
Uncle...

718
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,341
we'll come here tomorrow right?

719
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:03,383
Shall we leave now? School time is over

720
00:51:05,675 --> 00:51:06,133
Come on dear

721
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,422
Hey, she just smiled and why is
this like she said I love you?

722
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:22,792
[phone ringing]

723
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:25,591
-Hello, who is it?
-Raj.

724
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,550
Where's he going so?

725
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:37,633
-Hello, who is it?
-It's me, Charita

726
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:42,008
Can you come once to the hospital?
I want to speak with you

727
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:46,425
'She called me for the first
time and asked me to come'

728
00:51:57,841 --> 00:51:58,508
Charita

729
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:11,341
Come...

730
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,466
What, is she searching
for a place to propose?

731
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,341
Move inside..

732
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:30,425
What inside..?

733
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:45,633
Sir...

734
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,300
Who is he?

735
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:52,091
He's the one you signed and gave life

736
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:54,341
He said to see and talk to you

737
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,091
Talk... with me

738
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,008
And he

739
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:01,258
Many thanks sir

740
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:06,383
Many thanks for saving my life Sir

741
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:09,008
Is he saying to have a cold? Please see

742
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:11,841
Nothing so, he's saying you thanks

743
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:13,591
For saving him..

744
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,925
All those to say thanks are saying it

745
00:53:25,091 --> 00:53:25,883
Get well soon sir

746
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:30,591
Dude, success?

747
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:35,675
He can't see anyone happy right?

748
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:36,258
Me?

749
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:37,883
-No, God
-God?

750
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:39,716
He joins such at the correct time.

751
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:44,716
We can't smile, cry, express or swallow.
Life gets ruined

752
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:45,633
Move

753
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,175
Unsuccess...

754
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,591
Don't feel bad dude

755
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:50,758
Not that dude...

756
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:55,383
He can't bear if someone
is sad or if I'm happy

757
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:57,883
Every dog has its day

758
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:02,550
Raj..

759
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:04,008
It's here

760
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,508
No idea what twist would she give now

761
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,966
You are the care of
address for bad luck, go

762
00:54:15,008 --> 00:54:17,985
Can't you see even a
drop of tear in my eyes?

763
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:24,272
[music]

764
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:25,216
Didn't I tell you?

765
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:28,508
One incident would
change the total opinion

766
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:33,844
Hey Charita... Charita.

767
00:54:57,716 --> 00:55:02,675
"You said something like that"

768
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:07,258
"I would think that as some wonder"

769
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:12,008
"You heard something from my heart"

770
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:16,883
"I think you really haven't believed"

771
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,675
"Why do you say that?
Is this any small matter?"

772
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:25,425
"Has the dream come and
stood as you before me?"

773
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:30,716
"It's just that and what's surprising?"

774
00:55:30,883 --> 00:55:35,258
"This is the signature of a new love"

775
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:40,002
"Is it, ok then says my heart"

776
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:44,167
"It's into a surprising trance"

777
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:46,247
What are you looking for?

778
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:49,015
I'm here to donate blood.

779
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:53,469
Here, take this apple.

780
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:54,990
-Those aren't necessary for my body.
-You have to eat it.

781
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:01,300
-Sir, I will give blood.
-I will give.

782
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,164
Raj, what happened?

783
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:03,054
They are here to donate blood.

784
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:07,051
-Everyone in there are our guys.
-Good.

785
00:56:14,758 --> 00:56:18,577
"This is the way taken every day"

786
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:23,559
'Why is it today like
an overflowing river?"

787
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:28,141
"This is the land showing me the way"

788
00:56:29,415 --> 00:56:32,917
"It's become breeze when you are with me"

789
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:37,841
"Small fun touching like a rain drop"

790
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:42,466
"What did it say in my ears and pull me?"

791
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:47,831
"When the haste is chasing like a cyclone"

792
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:51,856
"How would I know what's ahead?"

793
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:56,910
"It's just that and what's surprising?"

794
00:56:57,356 --> 00:57:01,328
"This is the signature of a new love"

795
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:06,469
"Is it, ok then says my heart"

796
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,530
"It's into a surprising trance"

797
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:17,900
[music]

798
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:35,582
"My age is running with no stability"

799
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:40,086
"It stood still unable to move for you"

800
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:44,915
"What is thought as some fun"

801
00:57:45,968 --> 00:57:49,797
"Is becoming a great bonding"

802
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:54,246
"Is this the wealth coming as a boon?"

803
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:59,005
"Is this the shackle
hugging all over the body?"

804
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:04,698
"Let me offer my lonely life"

805
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:08,434
"let me share half of my life"

806
00:58:09,383 --> 00:58:13,700
"It's just that and what's surprising?"

807
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:17,861
"This is the signature of a new love"

808
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:23,201
"Is it, ok then says my heart"

809
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:27,351
"It's into a surprising trance"

810
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,232
"It's just that"
Hi.

811
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:45,519
"Oh... Is it, ok then"

812
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:04,700
[indistinct people chattering]

813
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,841
Did they change ward of Laxmi?

814
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:17,091
No madam, that girl left.

815
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:20,716
I asked to say and leave if discharged

816
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,716
She didn't get discharged
but left without information

817
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,425
Sir,
a patient being treated here went missing.

818
01:00:06,508 --> 01:00:09,716
Yes, they come and go.
Ok, about whom are you saying?

819
01:00:09,925 --> 01:00:10,716
About Laxmi

820
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:11,675
Laxmi?

821
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:14,591
What's Laxmi going missing?

822
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:16,300
This is slow poison..

823
01:00:21,008 --> 01:00:22,800
What has that got to do
in the ward with patients?

824
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,675
How did that come there?

825
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,216
He's the in-charge of that ward.

826
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:30,216
Ask him sir

827
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:35,008
I'm not leaving anyone if
something happens to Laxmi.

828
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,800
I'll put the whole matter to media

829
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,841
Why do you get so angry
for everything Charita?

830
01:00:40,425 --> 01:00:44,258
Maybe they left home
not liking the hospital.

831
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,133
You don't worry.

832
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,550
You don't make it an issue
unnecessarily saying media and Police.

833
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,133
I'll look after this case personally

834
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,050
Please.

835
01:00:52,425 --> 01:00:54,316
-Please.
-Okay sir.

836
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:07,630
'After our love story began,'

837
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,970
'I took her on a long drive to
Gandikota for the first time'

838
01:01:11,853 --> 01:01:17,050
A small house in such beautiful
location after getting 60 years

839
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,300
and waterfalls just next to it

840
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:26,012
Two trees next to that and a
swing to those and us both in that.

841
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:31,716
It feels great swinging so and
remembering the old remembrances right?

842
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:34,528
You're thinking what to do in 60 now.

843
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:37,923
Would you think of what to
do now after getting into 60?

844
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:40,883
So many take birth and die in the world.

845
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:44,258
We are born as humans, there should
be a meaning to this life, right?

846
01:01:44,466 --> 01:01:46,091
Meaning means, what to do?

847
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:51,091
If someone thinks of us even
when we are not in this world,

848
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,425
it's like our life has got a meaning

849
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:56,008
What's there,

850
01:01:56,466 --> 01:02:00,341
if we take few Lakhs loan and die
without repaying he remembers lifelong

851
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:03,675
I was talking about remembering.
Not scolding.

852
01:02:04,508 --> 01:02:05,841
Here she starts.

853
01:02:06,175 --> 01:02:07,216
Okay...I'll just be back.

854
01:02:08,216 --> 01:02:08,966
Where are you going?

855
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,550
Nature is calling, I'll wish and come.

856
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:30,244
Raj!

857
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,341
Hey. Who the hell are you guys?

859
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:08,633

Raj...

863
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:28,966
Please leave me.

864
01:03:29,175 --> 01:03:32,006
Raj...

865
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,958
'Why and who did that?'

866
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:10,791
'We complained at the police station too'

867
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:13,250
'and got to know that similar activities
took place there even in the past'

868
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:14,559
'Charita was frightened a lot'

869
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:17,116
Was it the same place we recieved
another such complaint earlier?

870
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:18,128
Yes sir.

871
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,208
Anyways, we'll call the suspects and
you'll have to come to the police station

872
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:24,708
On the whole, something is happening

873
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:26,875
Okay Sir.

874
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,625
-What happened?
-We missed the girl

875
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:35,416
I need time for 2 days, one guy
has ruined the entire plan. Yes

876
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,708
I said to bro and he said
would take care of everything

877
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:44,625
You don't think of all these,
take care about Charita

878
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:49,250
I'll find out what happened.
You don't take tension

879
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:53,583
You take Charita away for few days

880
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:59,208
'I too felt the same. She too said should
leave to Kerala for Onam festival.'

881
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:06,083
You're leaving me and going,
don't you feel anything at all?

882
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,458
You don't say film dialogues.
I said, will be back in one week

883
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,083
-I too will come
-Hey. Don't you understand?

884
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,916
It'd be a problem at home
if you come, is it required?

885
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:18,610
Bye

886
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:22,958

I don't like sending Charitha alone.

887
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:30,583

01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:43,705

Hey

893
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,458
Hi, what are you here?

894
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:11,854
Why did you hit me in public?

895
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,911
Why can't you say?
What's all this? Are you mad?

896
01:06:15,111 --> 01:06:18,333
Won't you pull the chain and push me out
from running train if I did? Don't I know?

900
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:47,791
Yes, all from our films are your girls

901
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,833
like Nayantara, Anupama Parameshwaran,
Keerthi Suresh, Nitya Menen...

902
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:52,568
Will you stop the nonsense?

903
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,541
How much?

904
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,329
No cash Sir,
only cards or even PayTM will do.

905
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:12,760
You've developed well man.

906
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,761
Okay

907
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:20,458
-Charita dear, are you fine?

Mother-in-law, I your to be son

909
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,583
See, how I managed her.

910
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,041
Welcome to Kerala

911
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,916
She isn't my mom but the maid.

912
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,666
Why's this so rich?

913
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,333
Are they paying salary or
giving away the properties?

914
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,375
Don't feel over excitement...

915
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:39,791
Madam, Charita baby has come
along with some guy too.

916
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,375
One festival in an year
and why are you so late?

917
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,916
Why've you gone so lean,
aren't you having food in time?

918
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:49,333
And him...

919

-Oh no, what's this?
-Mom, he's a patient of mine.

923
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,541
He's mad and came for a treatment.

924

Don't worry, everything will get alright.
Come

925
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:15,625
No pressures, I've come down

[windows creak]

928

There is fresh air here. This isn't
like your place. This is Kerala

929
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,308
Come on, there's attached toilet.

930
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,417
There's also the geyser. You can fresh up.

931

Keep your bag inside. Please sit. Okay?

932

Ok, you come.

933
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,208
Hey, where are you going?
Come on, you too can be right here

934
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,583
Nothing as such and don't think too much

935

You are here and I'll be there

936
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,750
What's the matter?

937
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:54,000
He wishes to be in a lodge.
He's not liking to give us a trouble

938
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:58,000
No... You stay

939
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,041
-No problem...
-What did you say?

940
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:05,625
I said you don't like troubling
us and want to go to a lodge

941
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,375
Why will I go to lodge when
there's such a huge house?

942
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,791
We'll send your mother there
and there'll be no disturbance

943
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:15,416
Disturbance... No disturbance at all.
You stay and no problem

944
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:18,750
Yes mother in law, no problem even for me.

-No problem.
-Ok, you come.

946
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:22,916
Mother in law,
why do you pull her saying no problem?

947
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,083
-Let your daughter be right here
-Get ready and I'll show you my place

-What sir, how are you?
-Who... Ok

01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:02,250
What was her name...
Yes, isn't Charita there?

952
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,333
-Why to ask Sir...
-What?

953
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:06,875
-What's the problem?
-Yes, a problem

954
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,250
Your guy is a big problem.

955
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,391
No idea what spell he cast on her...

956
01:10:10,778 --> 01:10:13,091
...but she's not coming to duty properly
after he entered into her life.

957
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,166
They both have been to Kerala for Onam.

958
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,083
-Sister...
-Yes, Coming..

After so long...

963
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:29,000
Are you fine..?

964
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,791
I'm fine... How about you?

965
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,166
My friend Neelima,
she's done nursing with me

966
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:34,791
-Hi
-Hi

967
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,558
Name is great but isn't
matching at all for the face

968
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:39,784
Kerala girls look smart.

969
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:41,868
-Why is your friend like this?
-Am I not beautiful?

970
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:48,600
-Telugu?
-She has worked in Hyderabad.

971
01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:51,007
I mean you look good.

972
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:53,745
-But your name is more beautiful
-Thank you.

973
01:10:55,141 --> 01:10:56,725
You both should come to my house.

974
01:10:57,225 --> 01:10:58,391
Definetly.

975
01:10:58,475 --> 01:10:59,141
Okay.

-Bye.
-Bye.

977
01:11:01,016 --> 01:11:01,600
Come.

978
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:07,725
Dad is nature lover. He bought this
selling the house at the village

979
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,308
I've a great relation with this place.

980
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:16,058
From the small steps holding dad's
finger till the steps in the recent days,

981
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:21,391
sleeping right here with my head
in dad's lap when I get any problem

982
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:24,933
and till the stage he consoles me...

983
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:26,808
All those incidents are
in front of my eyes always

984
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,100
The love that was in dad's
eyes those days is now.

985
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,183
It's seen in your eyes

986
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:39,391
Maybe dad sent you to me

987
01:11:39,891 --> 01:11:40,641
Is it?

988
01:11:41,933 --> 01:11:45,058
Then, is it your dad who
cancelled my Bangkok trip?

989
01:11:50,433 --> 01:11:52,016
Did you like our place?

990
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,183
My house

991
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:55,391
Did you like my mom?

992
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:00,042
-Will you take good care?
-I don't have mom right?

993
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,751
Your mom is my mom from now.

994
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:15,308
Get up early,
we got to go for offering Onam

995
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:19,683
-Mother-in-law, items are super
-Kerala special

996
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:25,475
-Mother in law, do you have BP?
-What?

997
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,558
Mom, he is asking whether you have BP

998
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:33,016
-Fit.
-You are old but still fit

999
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,350
-Young here but still very weak.
-Yes

1000
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:37,256
Mother in law.

1001
01:12:38,162 --> 01:12:38,456
-What time do you sleep at nights?
-What?

1002
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:44,308
-He is asking what time do you sleep.
-At 10.

1003
01:12:44,808 --> 01:12:48,100
-You don't get up at midnights right?
-Midnight...

1004
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:51,016
Why do you ask?

1005
01:12:51,141 --> 01:12:54,516
Nothing,
if she wakes up and finds you missing

1006
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:57,183
and then seeing you with me
in my room BP would shoot up.

1007
01:12:57,266 --> 01:12:58,266
That's why I am asking as a precaution

1008
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:02,266
-You are going too much
-What's he saying?

1009
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:05,975
He has an indigestion problem
and is asking what to do

1010
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:12,933
-Exercise, it makes you fit
-My good mother in law... You are super

1011
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:20,391
Tomorrow is Onam and we shall
get up early. Sleep early

1012

Hey man, does Raj stay here?

1046
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:51,608
He stays right here, what's the work?

1047
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:55,108
We do if it's repair but he has
to come if it's modification.

1048
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,275
Leave all that, I got to meet him.
Where can he be found now?

1049
01:17:57,316 --> 01:18:00,858
None would know where he's at
any time except Jaggu Bhai.

1050
01:18:00,941 --> 01:18:01,941
Go and meet him

1051
01:18:02,066 --> 01:18:04,441
Jaggu, where does he stay?

-Where are you put up now?
-At a building construction work

1054
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,358
Will you do the job right here
or should you go elsewhere?

1055
01:18:24,347 --> 01:18:26,809
Why are you sitting alone in the room when
there are relatives all over the house?

1056
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:27,659
-Come on
-Raj

1057
01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:30,440
Would relatives visit every day?

1058
01:18:30,532 --> 01:18:31,655
We should definitely spend time
with them only when they come.

1059
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:33,358
Come...

1060
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:35,910
Why have you become ready?

1061
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,108
He's working in Ananthapuram and
now came to Kerala for marriage

1062
01:18:41,275 --> 01:18:44,316
Yes, I'll shift to Ananthapuram
after marriage. No problem

1063
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,733
Mom, I don't have him in heart
and I don't like this marriage

1064
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,983
Please forgive me and leave

1065
01:18:53,777 --> 01:18:55,133
Oh no, why did they get up?

1066
01:18:57,025 --> 01:19:00,650
You don't want this marriage
or don't want to marry at all.

1067
01:19:00,858 --> 01:19:03,066
-Give me a clarity
-Please sir, be seated

1068
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:10,275
I didn't understand what you spoke to
them but I understood that you hurt them.

1069
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:14,566
-Will they come back again if you do so?
-Will you stop?

1070
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,683
They're not the relatives who
would come to our marriage.

1071
01:19:17,235 --> 01:19:19,038
but the ones who came
to see me for a match.

1072
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,233
Marriage and to you?

1073
01:19:27,025 --> 01:19:29,900
What are these multiple choice with
me at home? Is your mom any mad?

1074
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:34,483
-Ok, what did you say your mom about me?
-I said you are mad

1075
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,941
-Am I mad? Am I mad?
-Yes

1076
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:43,108
Yes, I said you are mad.
But did mom get a doubt at least for once?

1077
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,566
Mother in law, yes I am mad.

1078
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,775
Mad about your daughter.

1079
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,193
Give her to me in marriage
and I'll keep her in my heart

1080
01:20:01,691 --> 01:20:03,588
I thought I can convince

1081
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:08,549
but not knowing how mom would react now

1082
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,512
Sorry mom.

1083
01:20:17,202 --> 01:20:21,491
If you both liked each other,
it's ok for me too.

1084
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,356
Ask him to call his parents.

1085
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,983
Your parents... people... call... come

1086
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:34,025
-No problem?
-No problem... No problem

1087
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:36,191
-Happy?
-Very happy

1088
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:36,900
-I too am happy
-Very happy

01:20:45,816 --> 01:20:48,483
Say, why did you come to my guy?

1093
01:20:49,691 --> 01:20:50,650
What work do you have with him?

1094
01:20:50,691 --> 01:20:52,434
Bro, I'm saying the truth.

1095
01:20:52,658 --> 01:20:55,554
We haven't come for your guy.
We came for that girl Charita.

1096
01:20:55,754 --> 01:20:56,608
Is it for Charita?

01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,641
-Hello.-Jaggu, I need to talk to you.

1099
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:06,903
Meet me once.

1100
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:16,316
Is Raju in touch with you?

1101
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:21,566
He's not seen these days and is
not reachable even over phone

1102
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:25,983
It's okay, how far did
our assignment reach?

1103
01:21:28,919 --> 01:21:30,525
I think even that girl
is not still found right?

1104
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:34,025
It seems she's not coming
even to the hospital

1105
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:37,858
Our guys are saying that even
those records have gone missing

1106
01:21:39,071 --> 01:21:41,150
It seems she's from Kerala,
so maybe she's gone there

1107
01:21:47,483 --> 01:21:50,191
You thought I won't do the
work or I can't do the work?

1108
01:21:51,316 --> 01:21:55,108
One chance...
Give me one chance and I'll excel

1109
01:21:56,650 --> 01:22:00,483
Hey, this guy seems to be hungry.
Take him and feed biryani

1110
01:22:01,107 --> 01:22:02,941
Go, they prepared chicken biryani.
Go and eat

1111
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:06,066
Chicken Biryani...
Idiot said no when I asked in the morning

1112
01:22:06,937 --> 01:22:08,983
-Ok, I'll look into his matter today
-Okay.

1113
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:12,200
Ask Raju to meet me if he calls

1114
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,318

1118
01:22:47,433 --> 01:22:50,733
Raj has called,
it seems his engagement is fixed.

1119
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:55,566
I used to think the girl he
marries is very lucky till date

1120
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:58,900
But to get such a girl,
it's really luck of Raj

1121
01:23:01,858 --> 01:23:03,233
Oh no, why haven't you put curd?

1122
01:23:14,397 --> 01:23:14,900
Jaggu

1123
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:19,941
You have the clarity about the
work we are doing now, right?

1124
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:23,695
But you're striving to save someone.

1125
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:27,630
Even after knowing who's behind this

1126
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:39,673
He is the dangerous criminal who
shook whole of the South India.

1127
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:41,089
You too know that

1128
01:23:41,836 --> 01:23:42,971
There's none to question
about whatever he does

1129
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:44,646
There's no one who says
no to what he asks too

1130
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,041
Sir, please forgive me.

[crushing]

1132
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:51,268
None can stop him if he
wishes to do something

1133
01:23:51,702 --> 01:23:55,275
Raj is moving around in love with
that girl and you too know that

1134
01:23:56,636 --> 01:24:01,358
My worry is that he may risk his life
in the process of saving that girl

1135
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:14,358
Are we going?

1136
01:24:16,825 --> 01:24:20,108
Poor fellow,
who else does he have other than us?

-Hey.

1139
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:34,691
Bro... Sweety!

1140
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:37,231
-How are you sister in law?
-I'm fine.

1141
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:38,358
Charita.

1142
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:41,900
It's clear on your face
that you're very happy

1143
01:24:43,438 --> 01:24:44,116
Give those here

1144
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:49,881
-Hi sister.
-Charita's mom.

1145
01:24:50,492 --> 01:24:51,143
Hello

1146
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:52,612
Sweety, come

1147
01:24:52,812 --> 01:24:54,066
Please come

1148
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,400
Come baby

1149
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:57,975
Bro, I got to talk with you.

1150
01:24:58,175 --> 01:24:59,858
We can talk after you
fresh up bro, come inside

1151
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,447
Come on... Drink

1152
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:10,421
What's wrong,
why are you dull from yesterday?

1153
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:15,233
Bro, change that shirt first. I'm
unable to see you in that dirty shirt

1154
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:19,378
Raj, I have something to speak with you

1155
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:22,232
-Should you talk right away?
-I need to.

1156
01:25:31,441 --> 01:25:33,275
Tell me bro, you said
there's something to talk

1157
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:34,941
Need to discuss about Charita.

1158
01:25:37,692 --> 01:25:40,649
We have to think a bit and
decide about your marriage.

1159
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:42,702
I know what you wish to say bro.

1160
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:47,170
God took away mom when I was a child.

1161
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:52,615
I think he realized the mistake,
so sent her back in the form of Charitha.

1162
01:25:54,133 --> 01:25:57,765
I'm getting back all the love
I missed from childhood now bro

1163
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:02,066
I'm very happy.
All of this is because of her.

1164
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:10,525
Isn't this what you wanted to say? I know.
Come on bro, all are waiting at home.

1165
01:26:28,275 --> 01:26:30,733
-Hello-Jaggu, how far did our assignment reach?

1166
01:26:31,484 --> 01:26:32,974
Yes, it's on.

1167
01:26:33,552 --> 01:26:34,691
You said you don't believe
in threads and rings?

1168
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,691
I don't believe them still.
You're my confidence

1169
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:39,858
Here...

1170
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:52,308
-Where is brother?
-There

1171
01:26:52,516 --> 01:26:54,350
Brother, come.

1172
01:26:55,391 --> 01:26:56,516
I'll call later.

1173
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:24,891
My dear.

1174
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,433
I feel very happy seeing you both.

1175
01:27:36,975 --> 01:27:39,266
You finally achieved your wish.

1176
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,433
Come on jump.

1177
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:48,350
-Bye Sweety
-Bye uncle, bye sister.

1178
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
-Look into that work
-Yes

1179
01:27:57,558 --> 01:27:59,683

Is Raju there?

1191
01:28:39,016 --> 01:28:40,058
He is not here..

1192
01:28:40,725 --> 01:28:42,850
I've come out. Do you need to talk to him?

1193
01:28:43,266 --> 01:28:44,475
I need to speak to you.

1194
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:46,850
Come to the place of your engagement.

1195
01:28:47,475 --> 01:28:51,049

01:29:04,908 --> 01:29:06,075
What's wrong brother?

1199
01:29:06,283 --> 01:29:08,325
Haven't you boarded?
What about sister in law and baby?

1200
01:29:11,575 --> 01:29:12,283
Ok bro.

1201
01:29:12,658 --> 01:29:15,491
You said you got to talk something.
Come on, let's sit and talk

1202
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:24,782
What's wrong brother, any problem?

1203
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:27,183
Where's the girl?

1204
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:28,696
Which girl brother?

1205
01:29:30,252 --> 01:29:31,813
The girl you escaped from the hospital

1206
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:46,340
Your life is in danger
because of that girl

1207
01:29:47,175 --> 01:29:51,355
He does anything for money and this
is in regards with his uncle's life

1208
01:29:52,314 --> 01:29:54,958
Listen to me and say
where you hid that girl.

1209
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,694
Why do you fear brother?

1210
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:59,438
Let's lodge a police complaint.
I've got complete proofs

1211
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:02,241
Charita please listen to
me and give them the girl.

1212
01:30:03,658 --> 01:30:05,158
Raj loves you more than life.

1213
01:30:06,433 --> 01:30:08,058
He can't bear something happening to you.

1214
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,921
Please understand why I am saying.

1215
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,169
I'll see to it that
nothing happens to you.

1216
01:30:13,514 --> 01:30:17,565
Will we give Sweety if she was in
that girl's condition, brother?

1217
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,009
What you said is right,

1218
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:25,183
your guy looks to be an emotional fool.

1219
01:30:25,825 --> 01:30:26,616
We got him.

1220
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:31,741
Stay on the line.

1221
01:30:37,616 --> 01:30:38,783
Talk to Sampanth.

1222
01:30:43,283 --> 01:30:46,450
We can't believe anyone in this
business. But I believed you.

1223
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:48,794
I got a doubt when
Charita's record was missed.

1224
01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:50,283
Okay, still nothing is out of hands.

1225
01:30:50,908 --> 01:30:52,283
Handover the girl to
them and you come back.

1226
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:54,626

the most, but he will be alive.

Your brother called her

1240

and asked to come to the place
of engagement. So she went there.

1241

Did brother call?

1242

Anyone would go to Kerala
to bring down his madness.

1287

These are the phone calls
made by you to brother.

They asked to delete the entire
data of Charita at the hospital.

1294
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:46,216
They didn't say why.

1295
01:40:46,383 --> 01:40:49,384
Two people visited the garage too.
I thought it was for you when they asked.

1296

-Do you have their photos?
-No.

-Do you know Lakshmi?
-I know.

1308
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:56,781
Her dad left her as a girl was born.

1309

From then her mother brought
her up with great difficulty

1310
01:41:59,883 --> 01:42:02,716
Then, what we're doing is a good deed.

1311
01:42:03,133 --> 01:42:05,258
Mother is into so many troubles
because of the girl right?

1312
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:08,466
It's like mother's trouble
is gone if that girl is die

1313
01:42:10,033 --> 01:42:10,750
Do you know where he lives

1314
01:42:12,808 --> 01:42:13,546
Have you seen her?

Ahhhh! Varadaraj!

1327

What has Charita done to him?

1328
01:43:22,117 --> 01:43:23,225
He has liver cirrhosis

1329
01:43:24,366 --> 01:43:26,104
and is looking out for
liver transplantation

1330
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:28,734

matter if you came so far

1338
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:53,108
I should see Charita.

1339

hit, none of you'd go alive

1346
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:16,445
Don't get excited.

1347
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:20,608
You give that girl normally to me and
I'll handover your Charita very safely.

1348
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:21,641
That's it.

1349
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,000

1352
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:34,275

-When did she go missing?

1356
01:44:41,166 --> 01:44:42,025
Do you know the exact date?

1357
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:44,983
she went missing two days
before you left for Kerala

1358
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:48,900
Raj, please come once to hospital

1359
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:51,983
My friend's sister.
Can you please drop her in station?

1360
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:53,900
Was it Lakshmi whom I dropped at
the station and get into the train

1361
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:56,044
She is Neelima my friend.
she's done nursing with me

1362
01:44:56,447 --> 01:44:57,047
Hi.

1363
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,066
Neelima?

1364
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:00,616
I've a small work, I'll
meet Neelima and come

1365
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:05,441
What dude?

1366
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,100
Where is Charita's bag?

1367
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:08,316
Where is Charita's bag?

1368
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:15,275
Hello Charita

1369
01:45:15,541 --> 01:45:16,483
Hello, I'm Raj

1370
01:45:16,958 --> 01:45:19,441
Where's Charita?
Aunty is in to great tension.

1371
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:20,900
Do you know about Lakshmi?

1372
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:23,275
She's getting treated right here

1373
01:45:25,775 --> 01:45:27,747
Someone gave her slow poison

1374
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:33,441
She's now recovering now.

Should we give away the girl?

1379
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:47,441
Bro, its Varadaraj. There is no way out.

1380
01:45:47,958 --> 01:45:48,941
You'll have to let go of the girl

1382
01:45:53,275 --> 01:45:53,925
What boss...

1383
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:56,196
I'm ready to give the girl,
but one condition.

1384
01:45:56,546 --> 01:45:57,571
Charita shouldn't know this matter

1385
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:01,821
Tell me where to bring the girl
and I'll say where to bring Charita

1386
01:46:02,213 --> 01:46:04,488
Two different places and
should happen at the same time

1387
01:46:04,838 --> 01:46:06,696
Ok for me, say the place

1388
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,488
I'll call at 9 tomorrow
morning and fix the place

1389
01:46:09,755 --> 01:46:11,113
Everything should be done in half an hour

1390
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:12,021
Done.

1391
01:46:16,463 --> 01:46:17,113
Hey Raj,

1392
01:46:18,463 --> 01:46:20,440
She's a kid dude. Think about it once.

1393
01:46:20,963 --> 01:46:23,655
I want Charita at any cost

1394
01:46:30,334 --> 01:46:31,386

1395
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:32,980

I'm ready

1400
01:46:42,505 --> 01:46:43,780
Is everything ready?
Everything is ready sir.

1401
01:46:50,963 --> 01:46:52,071
If you say, we will leave sir.

1402
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:58,905
Hello..Sir.

1403
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:03,030
Where is Charita sister, brother?

1404
01:47:03,338 --> 01:47:03,938
How's she?

1405
01:47:04,588 --> 01:47:05,780
Can I meet her once brother?

1406
01:47:09,463 --> 01:47:10,280
We are now going there now.

1407
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,780

01:47:34,463 --> 01:47:35,280
-Brother
-Yes

1410
01:47:35,546 --> 01:47:36,988
Can I talk with Charita sister?

1411
01:47:37,796 --> 01:47:39,363
We're anyways going to the hospital,
right dear?

1412
01:47:40,046 --> 01:47:40,655
Okay.

1413
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,238
You're doing so much
for me. Thanks brother.

1414
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:20,230
Get down dear

1415
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:23,521
Here...

1416
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:25,271
Move...

1417
01:48:38,505 --> 01:48:39,905
Sir, we've reached market yard

1418
01:48:40,588 --> 01:48:41,188
Be on line

1419
01:48:45,005 --> 01:48:46,613
Where's the girl? I'm ready.

1420
01:48:47,838 --> 01:48:49,613
Charita will be before you
if I say yes in a minute

1421
01:48:49,921 --> 01:48:51,613
Even the girl will be before you
in a minute if I say yes.

1422
01:48:51,755 --> 01:48:53,280
Why so late, come on say

1423
01:48:54,213 --> 01:48:56,405
If you want to see the girl,
I should first see Charita

1424
01:48:58,046 --> 01:48:59,571
See, a Maruthi van is
coming in front of you

01:49:36,763 --> 01:49:37,611
Wait!

1428
01:49:39,463 --> 01:49:41,196
We shall confirm she's the girl right?

1429
01:49:48,518 --> 01:49:49,002
Hey!

1430

1431
01:50:02,255 --> 01:50:04,780
Everything is fine, blood group is matched

1432
01:50:07,338 --> 01:50:08,905
Hey, leave her

01:50:40,713 --> 01:50:41,363
Raj,

1437
01:50:42,005 --> 01:50:43,405
Look at me Raj.

1438
01:50:45,088 --> 01:50:47,238
Raj, talk to me Raj

1439
01:50:51,296 --> 01:50:52,655
It seems Sir will talk with you

1440
01:50:55,921 --> 01:50:57,446
Boss, thank you so much.

1441
01:50:58,088 --> 01:51:00,946
You gave life to my Father-in-law.
I can never repay your help.

1442
01:51:01,255 --> 01:51:02,405
I'm very happy boss.

1443
01:51:02,713 --> 01:51:03,946
You too are happy right?

1444
01:51:04,296 --> 01:51:07,030
I saw, I've seen all your love. It's good

1445
01:51:13,796 --> 01:51:14,613
Where's the girl?

1446
01:51:16,963 --> 01:51:18,571
Where's Lakshmi, Raj?

1447
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:22,655
Tell me what happened to the girl, Raj?

1448
01:51:23,546 --> 01:51:24,488
Tell me Raj.

1449
01:51:24,713 --> 01:51:27,821
You wasted all my hard
word of all these days.

1450
01:51:30,796 --> 01:51:33,655
Oh, did she know? I haven't said anything.

1451
01:51:34,255 --> 01:51:35,821
Leave this, I was saying something.

1452
01:51:37,713 --> 01:51:38,738
Yes about your help right?

1453
01:51:39,338 --> 01:51:40,905
I have a bad habit Raj.

1454
01:51:41,296 --> 01:51:43,044
I can't sleep at peace when
there are any debts unpaid

1455
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:45,142
It's a big problem with no sleep

1456
01:51:45,546 --> 01:51:47,754
so your lover here is my problem

1457
01:51:53,255 --> 01:51:55,988
If people who know this are alive,
they frustrate Father-in-law.

1458
01:51:56,421 --> 01:51:57,946
So, no way out.

1459
01:51:58,505 --> 01:52:00,321
Is it you first or her?

1460
01:52:05,005 --> 01:52:05,738
Raj..

1461
01:52:07,255 --> 01:52:08,155
Nothing will happen to the girl

1462
01:52:09,338 --> 01:52:10,280
and nothing will happen to you either.

1463
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:11,771
Believe me

1464
01:52:14,005 --> 01:52:16,071
Hey, take care about that girl

1465
01:52:16,421 --> 01:52:17,530
No one should come near the girl

1466
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:20,321
-Confirm the doctors and then send.
-Okay sir.

1467
01:52:23,505 --> 01:52:24,363
What's with you man?

1468
01:52:25,296 --> 01:52:28,946
You always say careful with the girl.

1469
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:33,155
Your father in law should be careful first
if the operation has to take place right?

1470
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:36,905
Are you safe first?

1471
01:52:44,630 --> 01:52:46,405
Is the car you are going safe?

1472
01:52:49,657 --> 01:52:50,902
What're you talking rascal?

1473
01:53:25,489 --> 01:53:26,530
We can't attack him directly.

1474
01:53:26,989 --> 01:53:28,493
Our only option is the technical edge

1475
01:53:30,713 --> 01:53:31,738
He uses a high end car.

1476
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:35,180
If we can get the ECU in that to
our control, we can hack that car

1477
01:53:35,655 --> 01:53:37,638
Car hacking, how's that?

1478
01:53:38,155 --> 01:53:40,513
You go as a company
executive and get access the car

1479
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:47,180
His car runs with ECU.

1480
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:49,846
ECU means Engine Control Unit,
just like our computer

1481
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:53,071
Door locks, steering, breaks and
everything are controlled through that

1482
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,696
We connect this device in that car and
install our software in that car's ECU

1483
01:53:58,005 --> 01:53:59,738
Then our software runs in that car.

1484
01:54:03,338 --> 01:54:05,905
And this is SMD, Spring Mobile Device
[device beeping]

1485
01:54:09,186 --> 01:54:13,946
Antenna here receives the signals through
the network of simcard and transmits to us

1486
01:54:14,486 --> 01:54:16,470
It activates our
software through Bluetooth

1487
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,488
Then the whole system is compromised
and the controls come into our hands

1488
01:54:19,713 --> 01:54:22,738
I don't understand anything what
you said. Will this work out?

1489
01:54:24,713 --> 01:54:28,780
Chris Wellsec and Charlie Miller applied
it on BMW X series in 2013 and hacked

1490
01:54:28,963 --> 01:54:30,738
and next they hacked
Jeep company cars also

1491
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,469
So I designed this device
with that same protocol

Didn't like the song creep?

Ok, tell me which song does your
uncle like and I'll play the same

didn't get a clarity

Hey...

believe a rascal like you?
