26th January 1948: Jalianwala Bagh Day

15
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:10,443
The refugees are forcibly trying to occupy
land in the Suburbs of Calcutta.

16
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:14,152
The landowners are
determind to drive them off.

17
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:20,153
In face of such confrontation, people are
building colonies, building localities.

18
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:34,505
Long live the motherland.

19
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:48,850
Dear children, on this glorious day we
establish a school.

20
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:53,339
Mr. Ishwar Chakraborty here,
will teach you

21
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,527
English and History. And I will
teach you Sanskrit and Bengali.

22
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,304
Remember, education is the backbone of the
nation.

23
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,240
Chant together the national anthem.

24
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,573
Brother Haraprasad...

25
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,579
Yes...

26
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:16,821
When we left the village you said we're...
going to our new home... is it here?

27
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,749
Yes, this is your new house.

28
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,318
Then why's there such a lot of fighting
here...

29
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,289
That will pass, and peace will prevail.

30
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,027
Your brother Ishwar is there...

31
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,765
He'll fight for his only little sister's
sake, we too will fight...

32
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,106
Please, listen to this low caste woman...

33
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,179
My name is Kaushalya...

34
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,709
I belong to the Bagdi Caste and my one and
only Aviram.

35
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,083
Where's your home town?

36
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,349
Dacca...

37
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,553
Then we can't accommodate you.

38
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,366
Only those from Pabna
are here. If we can't

39
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:59,089
keep the difference
then what are we left with?

40
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,130
We're low caste people sir...
a little shelter... out in some corner...

41
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,266
Mother, run...

42
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,076
There... the landlord's thugs
to carry us off in trucks...

43
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,510
Don't get caught...

44
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:27,754
Aviram... Aviram...

45
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,490
Say, the glory of Indian nation.

46
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:41,468
Mother... Mother...

47
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,340
Give me my snuff box...

48
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,398
This place used to be called Palm Ground.

49
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,129
The wealthy landlord's abandoned
uncultivable land...

50
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:19,608
I name this place... New Life Colony...

51
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,841
I asserted this name we have to trace out
Aviram's mother...

52
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,047
How would you find her?

53
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,050
I'll go to a newspaper office and give the
news in the papers...

54
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,482
Let's go tomorrow morning...

55
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,523
Ok...

56
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,497
Let no youth sleep tonight... we'll have to
keep guard and remain awake...

57
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:47,348
No youth will sleep in the night...

58
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,671
will have to keep guard.

59
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,577
How small is the child, can't even tell his
mother's name...

60
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,172
sad...

61
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,043
A missing boy has been found a refugee...

62
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,018
News editor...

63
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,757
refugee, who isn't...

64
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,987
Benimadhab is it your first job?

65
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,656
Yes, sir...

66
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,388
just joined today...

67
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,432
Working for a paper nowadays is an
opportunity for serving the nation...

68
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,100
My foot!

69
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:18,867
Beg you pardon!

70
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,067
You will find out...

71
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,372
Get the message.

72
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,107
Nathuram...

73
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,176
Hey... listen...

74
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,346
If you want to succeed in this job, learn to
cheat...

75
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,557
Nathuram Vinayak Godsey murders Mohan
Das Karam Chand Gandhi.

76
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:44,645
Gandhi shot at on his way to
the prayer ground...

77
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,132
this afternoon... at...

78
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,361
Hey Ram!...

79
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:00,037
We have been duped, somewhere we have
been duped...

80
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,857
Aviram go inside...

81
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,387
Sita come

82
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,480
Brother this is not our new home?

83
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,582
Ishwar, news about Aviram has appeared in
the papers in the lost and found column...

84
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,252
But will his mother get the news?

85
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,326
Brother won't you look for our new home?

86
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:57,559
Driver... Ishwar since when you are in
Calcutta?

87
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,370
O - Rambilas you too are here.

88
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,470
In college you used to say
you will go to England...

89
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:10,465
Well, my father died. The burden of running
the business fell on my shoulders...

90
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,344
come with me. Where would you go? Where?

91
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,219
I haven't decided...

92
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,491
Crazy! Just as in college.

93
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,827
Where are your folks?

94
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,688
I have a little sister with me...
no one else...

95
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,122
Why? Your father and mother?

96
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,929
...It's only six years since we met.

97
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,597
What all happened in these 6 years?

98
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,403
1942 and 1948.

99
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,270
Where are you staying?

100
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:39,941
Nowhere.

101
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,943
What coincidence! My guru, Swamiji
will be visiting my house today.

102
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:48,050
One of his disciples is a great ustad.
He will play music...

103
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,924
Met you today... you never missed a
single music conference in college.

104
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,255
Let's go and celebrate,
come over to my place.

105
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,969
How brilliant you were in college.

106
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,001
Of course we weren't very intimate,
you were too serious for the likes of us.

107
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:55,178
We used to call you 'Ocean of Learning'.

108
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,762
Near Ghatshila we have a foundry
and a rice mill...

109
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,854
in a small place called Chhatimpur.

110
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,101
We have been searching for a reliable person
to handle the cases up there.

111
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,531
The pay is meagre and there's no hope of
promotion...

112
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,510
will you take this?

113
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,676
Your salary will be 150/- per month.

114
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,781
For our accounts it will be shown as 250/-

115
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,300
Look around for another person... Rambilas.

116
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,479
This is exactly the answer
expected from you.

117
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,801
I know you never did anything wrong
in your life. Then it is final.

118
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,372
The guru's blessings have fallen on you, he
has seen you and smiled... come.

119
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:27,968
If you want you can leave for Chhatimpur
tomorrow. Just let me know, ok?...

120
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,707
Driver, move...

121
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I abandoned this life's boat

122
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,901
Oh Lord in your name

123
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,012
If I sink and die

124
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,279
Master, my name will be scandalized

125
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:21,156
The shoppers are shopping

126
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:27,333
How many coloured lights

127
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,211
glimmer inside the shop

128
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,900
Please make him come to his senses.
He is going on a procession again.

129
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,287
For cash dole...
life is not for oneself but for others.

130
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:08,945
The person who limits himself
with his own interest, he is not loving...

131
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,816
Haraprasad, I want a word with you...

132
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,543
Let's go...

133
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,864
Haraprasad...

134
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,704
Tell me...

135
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,305
I am leaving.

136
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:46,306
A friend of mine owns a rice
mill in Chhatimpur near Ghatshila.

137
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,318
I shall leave tonight by train.

138
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,656
Also for you I have made one...

139
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:56,020
In the English language
there is word: Deserter.

140
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,688
Forgive me, but I'll have nothing
to do with you anymore.

141
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,865
Wait...

142
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,832
all my responsibilities for this girl.

143
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,236
And Aviram... you brought him here.

144
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,472
Tread him to death before you leave.

145
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,677
I'll take his responsibility.

146
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,947
And those... who have no one?

147
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,147
I've lost all in a moment.

148
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,990
I threw away all and came away. I have to
raise a house again.

149
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,421
Let not such a disaster come ever in Sita's
life.

150
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:37,158
She shouldn't die of poverty.
Apart from this I have no responsibility...

151
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,205
Shame!

152
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,415
Brother, where were you through out the
day? I was feeling so lonely...

153
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,380
I was searching around for our new house.

154
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,087
Did you find it?

155
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,921
Yes... let's go.

156
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,802
You and me, will start tonight.

157
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,604
And Aviram?

158
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,174
We'll take him with us.

159
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,851
Lord Krishna... prays to Jadava...

160
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:48,835
Sorry, slightly late.

161
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:49,907
Good day...

162
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,877
This luggage. You won't have to carry it...
Take it up...

163
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,181
A little sister...

164
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,120
My name is Mukherjee... foundry workshop
foreman.

165
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,026
Mr. Rambilas the owner has sent a message.
You are his friend... aren't you?

166
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:12,286
I've had the house cleaned and come to meet
you... come...

167
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,566
we have to go along the banks of
Subarnarekha. That is the short cut...

168
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,209
you have come and dispelt a lot of our
worries.

169
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,471
Mr. Rambilas is a very religious person.

170
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,990
He has made a Hanuman temple
for worshipping and dug well...

171
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,045
My dear little lady what's your name?

172
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,615
Sita...

173
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,041
Are we going to our new home?

174
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,688
Yes lady, a new country, a new home.

175
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,451
How far is it?

176
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,435
There the blue hills in the distance,
sprawled against the sky.

177
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:24,768
By their side the river criss crosses,
wends its way...

178
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:30,155
There's your new house.
So many flowers, birds, butterflies.

179
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,478
Such large empty rooms, song and music.

180
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,249
Subarnarekha, a golden ray,
right beside it, is your house.

181
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:39,951
Don't lie...

182
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,749
One shouldn't lie to children.

183
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,889
Oh! Look...

184
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,407
Just at the outskirt of the town is your
quarter.

185
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,644
In the center of the Sal forest, is a
dilapidated aerodrome... a big affair...

186
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,748
During the war the Sahibs had constructed
it.

187
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:24,485
I'll take you there.
Near the forest is our mill.

188
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,468
I've had water drawn from the well...
get washed.

189
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,442
Oh! Akhil Babu...
- Come Avi...

190
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,009
The owner's friend Mr. Ishwar has come.

191
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,214
Now you have a company.

192
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,621
Mr. Akhil works in the Railways
he is a decent man...

193
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,578
lives next door.

194
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,722
I've stuck in this stony terrain, just
for the sake of two morsels of food.

195
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,088
I come from a land of plentiful water. But
even there's a problem.

196
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,916
A few days ago a film unit landed here

197
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,960
and the price of milk
went up from 6 to 10 annas.

198
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,666
Just when got settled down in Chhatimpur, a
transfer order arrives.

199
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,733
Brother, come look what a lovely garden...

200
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,190
He is reminded of his mother isn't it?

201
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,833
Aviram... Aviram...

202
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,952
Here come the manager.

203
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,949
Seems to be alright today.

204
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,593
He suffers from mental illness.

205
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:11,101
A strange person. A few years ago his
daughter eloped with a man.

206
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,230
After that he had become so grim.

207
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,308
Manager the owner's friend Mr. Ishwar has
come.

208
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,121
Hello.

209
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,082
Who? The new cashier!

210
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,295
Mr. Mukherjee, please show him his office.

211
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,827
Please take the charge of cash. The farmers
have started appearing.

212
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,734
In the paddy fields today

213
00:21:55,735 --> 00:22:01,735
Sunlight and Shadows play hide and seek

214
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:09,336
who has set them floating clusters

215
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:14,393
of white clouds in the blue sky

216
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,868
Hello, Mr. Chakraborty.

217
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:22,264
Sita is picking it up very fast.
I wish she would learn classical music.

218
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,812
Learn well. Maybe her
future lies in music.

219
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,777
Please start again.

220
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,465
Today, the bee forgets to suck nectar

221
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:41,824
and flies about reveling in sunshine

222
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,428
and why on the sand banks the cranes flock
together?

223
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,532
It's all fixed. The afternoon bus
will take Aviram.

224
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,609
Where to?

225
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,011
Jhargram. Where he'll study in a school and
stay in a hostel.

226
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,880
Aviram will go away!

227
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,682
He must study... he'll have to grow up.

228
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,479
There is no school here.

229
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,617
There will be the summer holidays soon.
He'll be back then.

230
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,425
Will you be able to stay far away?

231
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,159
Won't you feel sad all alone?

232
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,838
Let's start after lunch
by the afternoon bus. It leaves by 4 p. m.

233
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,235
Let's go to bathe.

234
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,685
What fun, I'll stay in a hostel.

235
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,464
Get out of my sight.

236
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,099
You...

237
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,404
I won't stay there long. I'll soon be back.

238
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,334
After you've gone, who will I play with?

239
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,008
You just said get out of my sight.

240
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,044
During the war the aeroplanes used to land
here

241
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,821
and hide in the forest.

242
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,087
This is the pilot's clubhouse. Know what
that means?

243
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,457
Sure.

244
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,918
After bombing over Burma

245
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,518
the Sahibs used to come back
here and would revel all right.

246
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,637
Come...

247
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,426
Aviram where are you? We won't get the
bus after this.

248
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,397
I'll back in the summer vacation.

249
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:53,475
The wind flows merrily today,

250
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:57,775
life surf on the swollen tide

251
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:04,883
the day will pass in idleness

252
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:09,418
playing on the flute

253
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,652
Don't be afraid, he is a harlequin.

254
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:45,955
He does it for money.

255
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,054
Chaitanya, come...

256
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,744
Why do you frighten the children?

257
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,813
I didn't. She just chanced
to be on my way.

258
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,287
What's your name?
- Sita.

259
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,160
Where do you live?
- In my new home.

260
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,067
Come, I'll reach you home.

261
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,541
Have you read the Ramayana?
- No...

262
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,789
It's the story about Sita.

263
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,983
In Mithila there was a king called Janak.

264
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:54,975
One day while ploughing the empty fields

265
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:58,466
he found a baby girl... Sita.

266
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:00,870
Sita truly is the earth's daughter.

267
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,371
The very same Sita one day went back into
the arms of the earth.

268
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,976
The earth parted in two,
and took Sita within its bosom.

269
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,755
Now that was much later.

270
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,557
In between the 7 chaptered Ramayana.

271
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,257
I'll hear the whole story one day.

272
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,038
After this many years passed.

273
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,364
Salute.

274
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,923
You are not paying heed to what Budhan
says.

275
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,750
I am telling you his wife will have a son.

276
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,227
Give him 7 days leave
to go to his home.

277
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,165
Go to the manager.

278
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,469
Where is the manager?

279
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,701
Hasn't he come yet?

280
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:10,937
What else am I saying?

281
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,710
Come...

282
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,486
Haven't you heard the news?

283
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:31,962
What's happened?

284
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,124
Since yesterday the Manager has gone mad.

285
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,059
As soon he sees humans he growls and tries
to bite them.

286
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:42,134
They have taken him to Calcutta by last
night's train.

287
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,457
Who's the letter from?

288
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,609
Rambilas. The manager has retired.

289
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,862
From today I am the manager.

290
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,962
It's a great promotion for you.

291
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,103
I'll go and inform Sita...

292
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,604
and about Budhan...

293
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,037
I'll see to it. You go ahead.

294
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,814
You've to invite us for dinner.

295
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,151
Inform Sita, my wife will also come with me.

296
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:41,355
Keep him happy. The new manager, the
owner's friend.

297
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:31,576
See the dawn is coming

298
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,292
The people wake up

299
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:02,944
The breeze wakes up

300
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:07,431
The birds wake up

301
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:10,611
The sky appears

302
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,001
Oh! Shyam

303
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:45,451
Why did you still lie asleep

304
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:57,112
Where were you

305
00:33:57,113 --> 00:34:00,862
Awake all night?

306
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,804
See the dawn is breaking

307
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,186
Suddenly it seems that you have really
grown up.

308
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,027
And you're becoming tiny everyday. You
went to work without having anything.

309
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,757
Where does your mind wander?

310
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,765
Don't scold me... let's go.

311
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,132
Why do you always sing such sad songs?

312
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,735
It seems for the both of you there is
nothing but sadness and suffering.

313
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,144
An article written by Aviram
appeared in the papers.

314
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:21,681
I felt happy seeing his name in print
but was shocked while reading.

315
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,420
People don't like these.
Show things that are beautiful.

316
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:30,625
Only then people will see, listen
and read.

317
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,394
I don't think that carefully when I sing
brother.

318
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,334
Oh! Have you read the last letter of Aviram?

319
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,298
Oh! No.

320
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,507
His final exams are over.

321
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,806
He says he won't be able to come home. He
is going on a trip with his friends.

322
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,828
I felt dejected after reading it.

323
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:57,418
For exams he has not been
able to come for a year.

324
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,819
He has worked hard. Let him roam about.

325
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,095
Lets go inside there's something to discuss.

326
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,026
The Mukherjees will have dinner with us.

327
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,670
Why?

328
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,432
The old manager has retired now I am the
manager, that's why they want a party.

329
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,668
Oh! You have become the manager?

330
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,705
But today the market is
closed. You take rest.

331
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,407
I'll try to arrange something.

332
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,744
Hi, Avi, you wrote that you

333
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:42,360
will travel around with friends?

334
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,848
Didn't feel like it.
I had been working hard for the exams.

335
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:46,271
So I thought I would come here
for a rest

336
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:47,761
as there is plenty of time
before the results.

337
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,807
Mukherjee is coming to dinner see if Sita
needs help.

338
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:56,973
Your brother is now manager. He's got ahead
in life.

339
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,780
How did your exam go?

340
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,301
Not bad. Brother, I've made a deal
with a big publisher to print my book.

341
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:04,783
I'll finish writing it here.

342
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,522
What rubbish you write, I just don't
understand it.

343
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
We can start our old quarrels a little later
Brother.

344
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,264
He will do well in exam.

345
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:27,371
He must, I've applied on his behalf
to study in Germany.

346
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,380
I'll send him to
Germany to study engineering.

347
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,885
The exams are over. I am back.

348
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,225
Why?
- What's why?

349
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,322
You wrote a long letter that you
would travel around with friends.

350
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,753
Didn't like the idea of going alone.

351
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,799
Silly...

352
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,232
I've found a publisher for my first novel.

353
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,983
I've begun writing. I've never had anything
published before showing it to you.

354
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,773
Won't you listen? To hell with you...

355
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,344
Ah! Leave...

356
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,075
Have I hurt you?

357
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,947
In one year you have grown up so much...

358
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:55,039
The hero of my new novel is a boy,

359
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,325
who can faintly recollect his childhood.

360
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:05,493
He can make out that his parents
were very poor.

361
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:08,791
He remembers the name of his village.

362
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:12,711
But there are many
villages by the same name.

363
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,608
All he knows is that one had
to cross a very vast river,

364
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:21,288
right on its banks was his home.

365
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:27,656
Since childhood he used to wonder where
had he come from.

366
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,695
He remembers his mother,
shivering with cold at night

367
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,701
as they arrived at a crowded
railway station.

368
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,196
Thereafter somewhere
his mother got lost.

369
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:46,710
He yearned to rest his
head on his mother's lap.

370
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,340
I've not a mother but you all are there.

371
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,775
Throughout the year I have been yearning to
return home...

372
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,648
You never wrote all these.

373
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,956
Well. I was never able to write it down.

374
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:37,361
Why I used to feel like
this I have realized today...

375
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,400
You never realized before?...

376
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:40,737
Not at all.

377
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:46,607
Didn't you too?

378
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,078
No.

379
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,364
Since when have let all these remain hidden
in your heart?...

380
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,272
Since a long time.

381
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,594
Let's go, it's getting late.

382
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,642
On this day

383
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:33,643
there is such happiness

384
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,982
On the swing

385
00:43:07,983 --> 00:43:11,649
sways Shyam

386
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,941
On this day

387
00:43:52,942 --> 00:43:57,990
there is such happiness

388
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,980
Is the food ready?
- Except the mutton.

389
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,026
Tomorrow, you see, I'll go out.
- Where to?

390
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,585
Oh! Yes, Jharagram... not in the morning...
in the afternoon...

391
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:06,036
I'll start after lunch by night... it won't
inconvenience you, I hope.

392
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,599
Where are you going Brother?

393
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:16,208
Well, something has happened... I've
decided but in reality I haven't.

394
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,713
What do you say?

395
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,256
Why are you talking senselessly?

396
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,596
Senselessly? How is it senseless?

397
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:40,264
What is it? Behaving so childishly...

398
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:47,176
Untidy habits... I'd just tidied the room...
guests will come... never do this again...

399
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,575
What madness!

400
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,289
Hey, listen...
- What is it?

401
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,859
Do you remember your mother?
- No.

402
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,989
Then how is it that your way
of scolding is exactly like hers?

403
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,939
Walking with a stiff neck
and frown upon your face...

404
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,146
I don't know...

405
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,967
Sometimes I get startled.

406
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:29,945
I feel I am being scolded
by my mother again...

407
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,887
I am your mother...

408
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,869
You won't go away like Mother?

409
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:58,505
I don't find Aviram...

410
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,084
He has gone to buy some meat near the station.

411
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:06,586
My lady...

412
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,585
I came to learn how the preparation is
progressing...

413
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,823
my wife wouldn't let me come alone... she is
afraid I might marry you.

414
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,035
The rice is probably getting burned
... please come.

415
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,805
Akhil Babu has been transferred back here.

416
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,837
After so many years I've come back again...
The time to retire is also near.

417
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,880
I'll take Akhil Babu to Biswas house and be
back... the food is not ready yet.

418
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,212
Akhil Babu please dine with us tonight.

419
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,320
Yes...

420
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:43,222
Excuse me... could you tell me where is Mr.
Iswar Chakraborty's house?

421
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,619
Oh! Aren't you Binod?...
- I am Aviram.

422
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,329
Avi... you have grown up so much, we read
your articles and like it very much.

423
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,836
Welcome, my brother will be so happy to see
you.

424
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,177
What a surprise... you have arrived so
suddenly... please sit.

425
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:13,813
Sita... Sita...

426
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,362
Will you leave tomorrow morning?
- Yes...

427
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,656
Coming to such a place you ought to have
had more time with you...

428
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,592
I've come with some real bad news.

429
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,469
Haraprasad's wife committed suicide last
night.

430
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,010
What?...

431
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,313
During the last 8 years, Haraprasad
lost jobs from 7 schools.

432
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:43,162
Never could fit himself anywhere,
for the last 2 years, he's been jobless.

433
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:45,584
I've heard that he
has been begging now.

434
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:51,993
And the two children?

435
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,223
Their incessant cries for food made
their mother hang herself...

436
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,804
and this letter...

437
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,973
She left it, it's addressed to you.

438
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,081
Mr. Ishwar Chakraborty, Chattimpur.

439
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,458
Brother, from this suffering
there is no other way out.

440
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:30,862
In my last moments I utter your name.
If you can please save the two children.

441
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,436
Your luckless sister, Renuka

442
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,378
Where are the two kids?

443
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,223
Haraprasad took them away from the funeral
pyre.

444
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,333
Before he left he gave me this letter

445
00:49:57,334 --> 00:50:00,319
and said, this last letter
should reach its destination.

446
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,831
But I'll not let my children
be brought up by a deserter.

447
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,167
Where has he gone to?

448
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,406
No one knows.

449
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,109
You know what he is like,
he talks in riddles.

450
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,940
In answer to me he said,

451
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:21,507
"Darkness cannot be the end,
I am going in search of light!"

452
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,709
Please don't mind since early morning,

453
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,977
the police, the burning
ghat rushing about,

454
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:37,662
the train journey... please don't mind.

455
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,465
Brother I'm frightened.

456
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,901
Why is everyone telling me that I've grown
up?

457
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,196
Crazy girl...

458
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,534
I'll never ever go anywhere,

459
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:30,348
leaving you... because you'll suffer.

460
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,216
Go to sleep...

461
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:37,391
Sita sleeps... Sita sleeps...

462
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:27,775
Aviram you have passed with good marks.

463
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,605
Come I want to talk with you.

464
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,464
You've passed so what will you do now?

465
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,829
I'll go to Calcutta.

466
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:59,603
I've nearly completed writing it.

467
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,071
Ha, the rubbish you write.

468
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,815
Only sadness, suffering and tears...

469
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,581
even I don't like reading it.

470
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,317
But all this is what we truly see around us.

471
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,799
You'll end up like Haraprasad. Listen...

472
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:50,921
everyone desires to achieve a little
and then cling to it. This is the rule.

473
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,974
Anyway... listen I want to send you to
Germany to study Engineering.

474
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,109
These papers arrived today, read them.

475
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,044
It's a 4 year course, complete it,
come back, and give me peace...

476
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,721
go home and tell Sita you have passed.

477
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,314
Well...
- Go.

478
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,598
What's happened to you?

479
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,134
I've done so well in the exams and still you
aren't pleased.

480
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,871
What have I done?

481
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,208
Not because of you.
I am unhappy for other reasons.

482
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:50,953
What for?

483
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:04,863
If I've to join this course at Hamburg, I'll
have to leave in 3 weeks time.

484
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:06,635
Where to?

485
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,673
Brother wants to send me to Germany. I
don't want to go... want to write.

486
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,498
What will I do being an Engineer?

487
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,216
Should I talk to Brother?

488
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,484
No.

489
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:29,349
Sita, Brother will compel me to go.

490
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,859
I shall leave the
country in 3 weeks time,

491
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,657
then for 4 years I
won't be able to see you.

492
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,476
Sita I've saved up a
little from my allowances.

493
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:48,874
If I buy something... for
you, will you accept it?

494
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:52,848
Yes.

495
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,748
Today at the fair if I buy a necklace
for you, would you take it?

496
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,251
Tell me.

497
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,108
Sita we'll get married.

498
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,083
The same old clubhouse for the pilots...

499
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:13,994
is it still there?

500
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,364
It was such a long time ago there was a
war...

501
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,632
Yes

502
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:36,941
Won't you sit down for a while?

503
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:55,868
What are you thinking about?

504
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,640
Nothing.

505
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,039
Avi don't go to Germany.

506
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,266
You have found truth in a certain
occupation. Why should you leave it?

507
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,005
I've been searching for something
like this to give me strength.

508
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,844
Sita having you by my side
I feel much stronger.

509
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:41,073
I shall not leave.

510
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,346
What that you have put away!

511
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:35,834
Where did you get it from?

512
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,075
Er... r. Mrs. Mukherjee gave it to me.

513
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,416
Take it.

514
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,706
Did you call me?

515
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,485
Yes, I've sent off a reply to Germany,

516
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,954
You'll have to leave in a few days.

517
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,799
You didn't give me even a little time
to think it out.

518
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,235
No.

519
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:25,639
What? Rambilas has come!
Suddenly.

520
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,850
Hello! Iswar, I just dropped in.

521
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,421
Salute...

522
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,318
My brother.

523
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:36,859
Salute...

524
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,023
Let's go to my house.

525
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,970
Let's go.

526
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,048
I give you 2 annas.

527
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,414
He is giving you 2 percent share in the mill
and factory as a partner.

528
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,581
Deepak, bring the papers.

529
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,758
Let's go and see your house.

530
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,526
Have a look at the partnership papers.

531
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,460
I really don't need to.

532
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,605
Deepak go away...

533
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,581
When you first came, I couldn't give you any
security...

534
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,138
But now you have proved yourself.

535
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:44,155
And it's really not possible
for me to look after the mill.

536
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,933
I've invested 50 lakhs
in my export scheme.

537
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:50,089
After 3 months I'll go to the continent.

538
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,613
And my wife, she's become
very fond of ceramic arts,

539
01:02:53,614 --> 01:02:55,200
she wants to visit Switzerland.

540
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,962
Come over to Calcutta after some time... on
an auspicious day.

541
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,202
I'll have the agreement ready.

542
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:11,452
Rambilas, I am so obliged to you. It is
because of you that I have everything.

543
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,047
It's business Brother. I am giving 2 percent
share, so you'll look after the mill.

544
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,786
Guruji has sent you his blessings.

545
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:21,997
Where are you going?

546
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,260
Towards the station for a walk.

547
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,068
Ok...

548
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,997
Your brother? I'd thought that apart from
a younger sister you have no kin.

549
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,769
I found him when he was a child... to
me he is like a younger brother.

550
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,781
What! You don't know his caste and let him
stay in the house?

551
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,112
What does that matter?

552
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,960
Everything depends on caste.

553
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:45,399
It's because of such things

554
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,913
I have decided to contest in the
election from Chhtimpur next year.

555
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,855
Rambilas, he is very good-natured boy.

556
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:52,957
But he might not be from a good caste.

557
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,230
Oh! Another thing stop the old boiler of the
mill.

558
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,503
Why... my mood has been spoiled.

559
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,076
Come after some days to Calcutta.

560
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,893
Mr. Ishwar a calamity has occurred at the
station, would you come and see it?

561
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,825
What's happened?

562
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:30,765
A little ago a train full of refugees
was going towards Dandakaranya...

563
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,061
two old women were taken down
from the train by the guard,

564
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:35,398
one of them is on the
point dying...

565
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,687
perhaps by now, she is dead...
the other is probably not related to her,

566
01:04:39,688 --> 01:04:42,209
said that the afflicted one belongs
to your hometown...

567
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,508
Bikrampur, near the village Bajrajogine.

568
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:46,782
Is that so?

569
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:47,983
Yes, let's go and see.

570
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,780
In her last moments,
even the medical officer could do nothing.

571
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,554
Oh! Bagdibou open your eyes for once and
see.

572
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,528
What's happened Brother?

573
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,724
A Bagdibou has died.

574
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,586
My mother...

575
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,357
Oh! Bagdibou...

576
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:04,921
Mother...

577
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,029
Before my mother passed away she told me
certain facts about birth.

578
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,465
In a moment everything changed.

579
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,245
What shall I do now?

580
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:37,819
You tell me.

581
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:45,419
Whether you send him abroad or not
at least send him to Calcutta.

582
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,558
Don't keep him in this village.
He's a low caste boy you see!

583
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,734
If there is talk about it here, Mr. Rambilas
might come to know.

584
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,217
Mr. Rambilas is a very religious person,

585
01:07:57,218 --> 01:08:00,502
all your efforts of all these
years will come to naught.

586
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,801
Oh! Another thing find a groom for Sita.

587
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,438
I want to marry her off as soon as possible.

588
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,679
What?

589
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,328
I don't want to go to Germany.

590
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,007
All right.

591
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,345
What will you do?

592
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,579
I'll go to Calcutta and try for a job.
If I am able to, I'll write.

593
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,252
Well.

594
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,915
Some people are coming to have a look at
Sita today.

595
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,564
I'm getting Sita married off soon.

596
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,001
I want to marry Sita.
She also wants it.

597
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,401
You ought to leave by the morning train for
Calcutta.

598
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:47,441
Try and earn a living, stand on your own
feet. I'll be happy if you can do that.

599
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,882
Sita, this is the sixth time
I'm asking you.

600
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,251
They are waiting in the drawing room to have
a look at you.

601
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,025
Wear a good sari and come with the tea and
snacks.

602
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,173
They have been waiting for you for quite a
long time.

603
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,665
If you give way to anger,
it will tell on your health...

604
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,640
I'm coming.

605
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:54,816
Salute...

606
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:55,717
Salute...

607
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,494
Everything is set sir.
They've agreed about the dowry.

608
01:11:07,495 --> 01:11:10,223
In the next six days there is an
auspicious day.

609
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,938
Make all arrangements for that very day.

610
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:49,365
Who shall I talk to

611
01:11:49,524 --> 01:11:54,708
about my sadness?

612
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:12,789
Without Mohan

613
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:20,423
my heart is sad.

614
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:37,709
See the dawn is here.

615
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:45,624
The ten directions are waking up.

616
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:52,314
See the dawn

617
01:12:52,315 --> 01:12:57,097
is breaking.

618
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:08,306
I've a hundred qualities.

619
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:28,203
Come my life's wealth.

620
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:35,138
Show me the way.

621
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:46,349
Come Mohan.

622
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:27,987
You are being unjust Brother!

623
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:13,737
A letter from Rambilas came today
regarding the partnership.

624
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:17,203
He has told me not to come
Calcutta for the time being.

625
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,912
He'll finalize everything after he returns
from abroad.

626
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,585
He has conveyed his condolences
for Aviram's mother.

627
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:33,918
And he has added that I should not be
shocked about Aviram's caste.

628
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,033
Brother, you never indulge in untruths.

629
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:49,637
Efforts of a lifetime are right before me.

630
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:51,979
Brother...

631
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,214
Shut up...

632
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,826
I'll see to it that
this marriage takes place.

633
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:03,082
If something else happens...
I wish you die before that.

634
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:06,828
Yes...

635
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,931
you will be dead.

636
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:57,612
You are leaving?

637
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,039
Shall I perform the last rites
of my mother in Kalighat?

638
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,920
A few of my mother's
relatives stay in that colony,

639
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,923
I'll try to find a place to stay. Bye...

640
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,749
You have nothing else to say?

641
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,096
I'll not harm our Brother.

642
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:18,992
Will you harm me?...

643
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:24,272
Sit down.

644
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,840
Only after 5 days is my marriage.
Do you know that?

645
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:35,983
Yes...

646
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,348
Avi... I'll go with you.

647
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,953
I too will not harm our brother.
Last night he wanted that I die.

648
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,219
Give me some time.

649
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,292
I'll go and fix up a place.

650
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,688
Everything is ready sir.

651
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:13,244
The auspicious moment has come.
Bring the bride.

652
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,915
Sita has gone, she'll be back soon.

653
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,955
She was writing something.

654
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:47,498
A few more years passed away.

655
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:16,265
Salute, Sir.

656
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,850
Hello, how are you?

657
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:32,753
Pulling on somehow.

658
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:41,455
For 6 years he's been... mad.

659
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,490
Not mad, he has killer's eyes.

660
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:51,399
The way he was looking... I was trembling.

661
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:01,638
Man has crossed the limits
of the Earth's boundaries,

662
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:05,786
from limitless space, the
first Voyager's safe return.

663
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:11,513
Circling for one and half hours
in space, around the earth.

664
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:15,826
The first step in unveiling
the mystery of space.

665
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:21,701
The courageous and successful conquest of
space by the Soviets.

666
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:27,565
The triumph of human science
and intelligence is seen in this...

667
01:22:27,566 --> 01:22:32,846
the Russians have sent a man
called Gagarin in outer space.

668
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:02,366
In the rains he has come.

669
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:28,163
The clouds thunder

670
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:31,963
the lightning flashes

671
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,334
in a shower of colours.

672
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:02,395
You have such a lovely voice Sita,
you are wasted sitting at home.

673
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:07,139
I look after the house and my child,
and so much running around.

674
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,778
You can do it sitting at home. Like Reba
who stays in the Southern Colony.

675
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:12,813
Are the paper bags ready?

676
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,447
Not even 500 yet.

677
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,576
Binu take them out of the corner and give
them to Aunty.

678
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:37,232
Take this, I'll come the day after.

679
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:50,080
Father still has not come back mother!

680
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,278
He'll be back any moment.

681
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:01,620
Brother was right.

682
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,571
No one wants to see sadness and suffering.

683
01:25:04,572 --> 01:25:06,272
But everyone's ready to bear them.

684
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:09,527
They are suffering all around. But
they don't want to hear about it.

685
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,231
Did you go to the publisher?

686
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,565
Yes, here are the manuscripts.

687
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,528
It's risky to publish
this type of writing.

688
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:17,372
And the price of printing
paper has gone up.

689
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,009
There is good news.

690
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,987
I met my class friend, Anil, on the way.

691
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,805
He's got a good job
with state transport.

692
01:25:30,806 --> 01:25:33,450
If I'd learn driving, I
could have got a job now.

693
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,428
Will you give up writing?

694
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,024
Driving a bus is better than writing for
nothing.

695
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,098
When will you get it?

696
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,432
What's the hurry?

697
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:46,471
I've to learn driving and apply for the job,
will have to undergo training.

698
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,241
What shall I do?

699
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,007
All efforts have failed.

700
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,519
Why not write to Brother for once?

701
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:08,322
Binu says he gets a headache every day,
even at this age.

702
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,862
Continuous semi-starvation.
So our Brother...

703
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:15,800
I mean, Brother must have a good
amount in savings.

704
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,103
Before I approach him, I'll take Binu
with me and beg on roads.

705
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:25,940
I'll commit suicide... I'll do
the worst things possible.

706
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:35,252
Kajal was suggesting, how would it be,
if I start singing?

707
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,590
Song...

708
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:40,750
Yes, Kajal will bring listeners to the house
who'll give money.

709
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,220
What are you saying?

710
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,687
Reba does that.

711
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,430
Don't listen to all that.

712
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:47,334
Why?

713
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,434
You won't understand it... I'll be back.

714
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:55,672
What did I say?

715
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,543
Whatever I say... 'you won't understand'.

716
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,684
Hey, Binu your mother sings very well,
doesn't she?

717
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,180
Yes, Mother, that song
about the rice fields.

718
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,656
Would you listen?
- Yes.

719
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:15,763
Mother, what do rice fields look like?

720
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,058
Listen! And you will be able to see.

721
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:25,808
Today in the paddy fields

722
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:29,280
Sunlight and shadows

723
01:27:29,281 --> 01:27:32,403
play hide and seek

724
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:37,081
who floated the white clouds

725
01:27:37,082 --> 01:27:39,716
in the blue skies

726
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:47,233
the bee forget to sip the honey

727
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:50,788
flies around in the light

728
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:59,396
why do the birds meet on the banks of the
river

729
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:21,147
I shall not go back home

730
01:28:21,148 --> 01:28:24,426
shall not go back home

731
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:28,876
I'll break the skies as under

732
01:28:28,877 --> 01:28:32,333
and spread around nature

733
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:38,035
I won't go back home today.

734
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,121
How late is the night?

735
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,229
No answer comes forth

736
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:15,606
Carry on I'll be following you.

737
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:22,318
Tomorrow morning the villagers will gaze

738
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:25,943
dumbfounded at a pair
of bodies... hanging.

739
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,582
Haraprasad, it's you?

740
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,653
No, this is my ghost.

741
01:30:36,654 --> 01:30:40,499
I'm defeated. I'm ruined...

742
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,097
just about living.

743
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,735
A palm tree stuck by lightning.

744
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:50,675
I protested...

745
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:57,641
protesting for whom? Protesting for what?

746
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:05,948
Now I'm bankrupt. Whacked all around.

747
01:31:05,949 --> 01:31:10,094
I'm caught firmly in a trap.

748
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:22,501
But, hey you deserter, Oh, coward, you had
accepted a job.

749
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:24,969
So, why have you been reduced to this?

750
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:29,773
You are about to swing in space too...

751
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:37,440
The fact remains that whether
you protest or run away

752
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:43,093
with your tail between your legs
it matters little either way.

753
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,395
Everything is topsy turvy.

754
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:54,729
We are all resourceless, ethereal,

755
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:57,566
we've been wiped out.

756
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,112
How late in the night, it is?

757
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,188
Does an answer come forth?

758
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,461
Are we going to our new home father?

759
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:22,268
Just see today I'm starting work.

760
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:26,073
Tomorrow I'll give the landlord the rent
and day after we'll leave.

761
01:32:33,114 --> 01:32:35,582
You are so late? Won't you be late for work?

762
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,043
There's still time, I've just seen a house.

763
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:39,843
I'll go out on the route with the bus today.

764
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,088
Where will you go?

765
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:46,116
I don't know, yesterday they made me take
the bus around the city.

766
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:53,028
I noticed water in the brake joint
and I couldn't get the brake to work.

767
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:57,369
Somehow I was able to get back, who knows
what sort of a bus they will give me today.

768
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:00,796
See what a state your sari is in!

769
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:05,577
I have... have a box full of silk sarees.

770
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:11,277
Today, I'll buy two sarees for you on my way
back from work. Today is pay day.

771
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:14,755
If I can return from work due to kindness of
their bus.

772
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:22,289
Binu, what toy you desire most?

773
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:24,364
A train.

774
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:36,506
I'll go to the new home.

775
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,611
Mother how late in the night is it?

776
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:45,285
It's quite late.

777
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:47,645
Won't father come with a train?

778
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:49,222
He'll come.

779
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,792
Mother how does the new home look like.
Have you seen it?

780
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,328
That was when I was child.

781
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:05,304
When I was a child of your age, a person
showed it to me.

782
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:11,783
The winding river and blue, blue hills,

783
01:34:11,784 --> 01:34:17,784
up there the butterflies
flutter around and sing songs.

784
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:19,845
Have you been there?

785
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:27,455
No, from the distance I saw
the way leading to it.

786
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:31,196
I'll go to Subarnarekha.

787
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:37,897
Certainly, someday you will go there.

788
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:48,938
Scold father for coming home late.
Place the toy train near my pillow.

789
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:52,275
Yes, my dear, sleep.

790
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:24,944
On the swing sways Shyam.

791
01:35:42,837 --> 01:35:44,566
The driver died on the spot.

792
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,775
Don't break it suddenly... not so loud.

793
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,009
What happened?

794
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:51,375
The brakes were not working near the Tala
Park.

795
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:54,584
The little girl not even 12.
She was a beautiful girl.

796
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:55,746
500 people set the bus on fire.

797
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:57,909
The police turned up late.
Couldn't save him.

798
01:35:58,819 --> 01:35:59,717
Is this the driver's house?

799
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:19,527
See! We are totally defeated.

800
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:24,632
We are not even capable of committing
suicide.

801
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:39,647
Ishwar will you take me once to Calcutta?

802
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:44,614
I've no money, but you've lots of it.

803
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:53,256
In Calcutta now there's fun.

804
01:37:54,368 --> 01:38:00,368
In the shops, hotel and race course,
what horrifying fun.

805
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,542
You'll see and be stupefied.

806
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:09,812
How people give themselves up with the
flow.

807
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:15,350
Running with the crowd is the right thing to
do.

808
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:20,358
Gratification of the senses
is the only way to salvation.

809
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:22,028
Gratification?

810
01:38:22,029 --> 01:38:24,429
You have led an ascetic's life.

811
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:29,900
Turbulent, wild, enjoyment to the hilt.
It's such an intoxication.

812
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:36,870
In spite of total loss... intoxication.

813
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:39,201
Will you go to that bestower's fair?

814
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,280
Yes...

815
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:44,413
Let's be quits with the devil.

816
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:39,996
Desirous of merit, Vajasravasa gave away
everything.

817
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:49,476
He had a son named Nachiketa.

818
01:40:00,794 --> 01:40:06,794
The god of death told Nachiketa
do not seek self knowledge.

819
01:40:11,193 --> 01:40:15,004
Ask for any other boons.

820
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:23,508
The celestial dancers are out of reach
even for the gods.

821
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:31,014
If you want music, dance etc...
it will all be yours.

822
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:37,062
Nachiketa was a fool.

823
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:40,100
Nachiketa!

824
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:41,034
Me!

825
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,001
Waiter.

826
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:06,591
Is this Ambrosia?

827
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:08,153
Sir, it is Bourbon Whisky.

828
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:10,827
As was said by Maitreyee.

829
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:16,631
What will I do with that which does not
confer immortality.

830
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:23,267
Thus spoke Maitreyee... What is not
ambrosia... what shall I do with it?

831
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:27,674
Sir, I'll call the head waiter,
that's French wine.

832
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:29,841
Pour it...

833
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:35,688
in the absence of honey.

834
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:37,415
I will have mollasses, there's a dictum
ingrained in the scripture.

835
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,591
Pour it.

836
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:44,687
Not in listening but it's in the memory.

837
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:49,759
Listening is the Upanishad pleasure in
renunciation.

838
01:41:51,839 --> 01:41:55,718
The self cannot be realized by the weak.

839
01:41:55,719 --> 01:41:58,046
The maximum is pleasure.

840
01:41:58,047 --> 01:42:04,047
There is not pleasure in a little
that is what you are 'Shetaketu'.

841
01:42:24,204 --> 01:42:25,466
Take the gentleman home.

842
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:33,809
Home!

843
01:42:57,971 --> 01:42:59,802
Arise, awake and behold.

844
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:04,159
The boons are due to you.

845
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:09,178
The way is a like a sharp razor's edge.

846
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,210
That's what the sages tell us.

847
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,218
They didn't see the Atom Bomb.

848
01:43:18,625 --> 01:43:19,592
They didn't.

849
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:27,027
Never, haven't seen war,
havn't seen famine.

850
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:31,462
Haven't seen the riots,
haven't seen the country split up.

851
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:38,367
Unreason is the hymn for worshipping the
Sun.

852
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:48,183
What's after that?

853
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,271
Immerse it...

854
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:09,239
After killing seven soldiers,
Haraprasad died.

855
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:19,786
O peace, O peace. Remember my deeds...

856
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:55,379
Like to listen to singing?

857
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:58,454
Who?...

858
01:44:58,759 --> 01:44:59,589
Good.

859
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,032
The money sir?

860
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:28,921
The daughter of a gentleman. She's never
done this. This is the first time.

861
01:45:29,623 --> 01:45:31,386
Sir, when you will see her, you will be
charmed.

862
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:43,395
Sita, he came from a village,
lots of money.

863
01:45:44,037 --> 01:45:44,799
I'll take Binu to my house.

864
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:45,905
Kajal!

865
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,269
Don't fret, the first time
is always like this.

866
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:49,542
Kajal...

867
01:45:49,976 --> 01:45:52,501
He's come to listen to your singing.
He'll listen and he'll go.

868
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,747
Do not fear, you'll get used to it.

869
01:45:57,084 --> 01:46:00,815
Binu's 3 months school fees. Your
household expenses. Keep this 50 rupees

870
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,669
Make the gentleman happy
and he will give lots more.

871
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:05,790
I won't take anything from
that, you helpless one.

872
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:27,574
I'll take you to that room.

873
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:28,943
Please wait.

874
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:30,714
In that room.

875
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:31,975
I'll take you to that room.

876
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:33,884
Getting ready, please wait.

877
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:40,086
Extreme penury. A gentleman's daughter is
forced to do this.

878
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:38,766
Ha Ram...

879
01:51:14,701 --> 01:51:18,431
This night too, has an end.

880
01:51:18,432 --> 01:51:24,372
Days pass into months,
months into years...

881
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,242
The plane was late.

882
01:52:02,248 --> 01:52:03,237
The smugglers were apprehended.

883
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,542
Yes, with 2 lacs worth of gold.

884
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:07,485
Come listen.

885
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:13,889
The boss talking about Ishwar Chakraborty's
case.

886
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,921
The one about a woman's murder in a
colony...

887
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:17,691
That wasn't murder, it was suicide.

888
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:20,118
The case dragged on for 2 years

889
01:52:20,119 --> 01:52:22,524
before it was proved a
suicide, only yesterday.

890
01:52:23,336 --> 01:52:24,095
The boss was saying...

891
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:26,763
After working all night I'm least bothered.

892
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:30,808
The company is setting up a new rotary
machine...

893
01:52:31,377 --> 01:52:33,504
the Company has an expansion scheme
also...

894
01:52:33,847 --> 01:52:36,645
He said, that you have been handling the
case from the beginning.

895
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:41,744
You know nearly all of them. And the child
Binu, the dead lady's son, you know him.

896
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:47,750
If you please the boss now then you have
prospects for the future.

897
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:49,927
Brother, I report legal matters.

898
01:52:50,797 --> 01:52:53,994
I'm fed up of writing about red lights and
snatching...

899
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:56,961
Are you daggling the Magsasay award before
my eyes?

900
01:52:59,172 --> 01:53:04,576
Ishwar has been asserting that he is guilty
and he has never lied in his life.

901
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:06,141
I'm feeling sleepy.

902
01:53:08,548 --> 01:53:13,542
If the boss hears that for mere sleepiness.

903
01:53:16,823 --> 01:53:18,256
It's a dog's life.
I'm going to get a statement.

904
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,660
It seems, I've seen you somewhere

905
01:53:31,271 --> 01:53:32,465
No, I don't to seem to recognize you.

906
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,030
Hey, master Binu, when did you arrive?

907
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:37,401
I've brought him
to his uncle.

908
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:39,771
Are you related to Mr. Ishwar?

909
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,276
No... I'm a friend.

910
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:44,916
I've heard that Ishwar
never lied in his life.

911
01:53:45,552 --> 01:53:48,350
But in this case all along he has been
saying... He is guilty.

912
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:49,688
Yes...

913
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:56,351
Listen, in a previous era Kshudiram became a
martyr...

914
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:01,572
with peaceful steps,
with a chant on his lips,

915
01:54:01,573 --> 01:54:05,564
with his own hands he'd put
the noose around his neck.

916
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:10,505
He knew what he was, that was his strength.

917
01:54:11,144 --> 01:54:15,604
Today, we the group of Kshudiram's we
don't know what we are!

918
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:19,516
Therefore, we think that fighting means
getting beaten up.

919
01:54:19,986 --> 01:54:23,149
And being a martyr means dying like
roadside dog.

920
01:54:24,224 --> 01:54:25,816
Call for immersion.

921
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:31,823
Ishwar has realized this, that's why says he
is guilty.

922
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:35,361
O mother... open the doors.

923
01:54:42,075 --> 01:54:43,406
Will you do me a favour please?

924
01:54:44,143 --> 01:54:44,843
Yes...

925
01:54:45,178 --> 01:54:47,339
I don't wish to face Ishwar any more.

926
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:51,861
After a great catastrophe,

927
01:54:51,862 --> 01:54:56,019
I'd rather not burden him any more.

928
01:54:57,323 --> 01:54:58,415
If you please...

929
01:54:58,524 --> 01:54:59,786
Ok, I'll take Binu to his uncle.

930
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:03,558
Not an uncle, in this world he's the sole
relative he has.

931
01:55:05,298 --> 01:55:07,858
Binu your uncle will take you to your new
home.

932
01:55:08,701 --> 01:55:11,101
The one you used to hear from mother,

933
01:55:34,961 --> 01:55:36,223
Good day, you are going back to homeland.

934
01:55:38,464 --> 01:55:39,761
It is said that you are a truthful person!

935
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:42,693
You've come here to have some fun!

936
01:55:46,172 --> 01:55:46,900
It's true.

937
01:55:48,508 --> 01:55:50,220
I haven't lied.

938
01:55:50,221 --> 01:55:55,471
You won't go unscathed,
even... you are guilty.

939
01:55:56,249 --> 01:55:56,949
Me?

940
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,616
You too are guilty.

941
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:00,280
You, me all of us.

942
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:05,790
You think that it's only my sister who has
suffered?

943
01:56:06,225 --> 01:56:07,192
Don't you have sisters?

944
01:56:07,493 --> 01:56:08,653
Mother!...

945
01:56:14,934 --> 01:56:17,368
Good day... your nephew.

946
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:32,948
Mr. Mukherjee has sent this letter.

947
01:57:29,008 --> 01:57:30,370
Sir, after such fiasco,

948
01:57:30,371 --> 01:57:33,154
Mr. Rambilas isn't
keeping you any longer.

949
01:57:33,155 --> 01:57:35,937
You are very truthful and
have held yourself guilty.

950
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:38,876
Consequently, I've become the manager.

951
01:57:38,877 --> 01:57:42,617
You and your sister's things
are in the company's bungalow.

952
01:57:43,156 --> 01:57:46,578
Please remove them from the
land and vacate the house.

953
01:57:46,579 --> 01:57:50,062
That house is now mine. Yours
faithfully, Jogen Mukherjee.

954
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,535
In this paddy field,

955
01:58:51,536 --> 01:58:55,751
Sunlight and shadows

956
01:58:55,752 --> 01:58:59,755
play hide land seek

957
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:06,500
In the blue skies who sets afloat

958
01:59:06,505 --> 01:59:10,102
those white clouds

959
01:59:43,576 --> 01:59:45,703
Uncle.

960
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:50,378
My Binu.

961
01:59:54,754 --> 01:59:59,224
Uncle is this the Subarnarekha River?
- Yes...

962
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:00,249
Put me down.

963
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:07,028
There in distance are the blue, blue hills.

964
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:09,842
There are empty big rooms up there.

965
02:00:09,843 --> 02:00:13,638
In the garden the butterflies
flutter around and there is music.

966
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:19,770
Uncle, Mother told me that there
lies our new home.

967
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:26,743
Tell me the truth. Are we going to a new
home?

968
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:32,814
Tell me the truth... tell me please.

969
02:00:39,098 --> 02:00:39,928
Tell me...

970
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:07,857
Yes, we are going to our new home, Binu.

971
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:09,761
Truly.

972
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,000
Truly.

973
02:01:16,302 --> 02:01:19,068
What fun! My father is there?

974
02:01:19,069 --> 02:01:22,502
I'll find my mother there, let's run.

975
02:01:31,717 --> 02:01:36,711
You have run out of breath,
Uncle, walk faster.

976
02:01:43,362 --> 02:01:44,226
Why have you stopped?

977
02:01:44,764 --> 02:01:45,856
Come, come...

978
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:11,280
Why have you become old, Uncle... faster...

979
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:24,499
Come... come.

980
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:57,530
Victory to man,

981
02:02:57,532 --> 02:03:03,532
to this newborn ever living.
