1
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,826
Hey! What are you thinking, man?

2
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:28,731
I'm bequeathing Rs.2 Iakhs each to my wife
my concubine & her sister after my death.

3
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:32,172
FooI I mean idiot.
What are you thinking then?

4
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,903
I'm thinking of how to earn it.
- How wiII you earn it?

5
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,749
I'II make it somehow,
what brings you here?

6
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,941
I'm here for my side business,
which you know weII.

7
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,517
Why not? You seII the used syringes
and saIine bottIes.

8
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,452
That's your business, right?

9
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,922
I'II not teII others but since
you're a fooI I'm teIIing you.

10
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,352
I've stopped it.

11
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,189
I mean you're seIIing it
without cIeaning it, right?

12
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:54,198
How come you're so innocent?

13
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,765
Is anybody Iistening it?
- Nobody is here.

14
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,201
I'm seIIing in bIack the medicines
stoIen from the mobiIe hospitaI.

15
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,432
I don't care whether you
seII it in white or bIack.

16
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:04,939
That's why I caIIed you a fooI.

17
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,438
Hey, take this parceI and...
- And then?

18
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,511
DeIiver this parceI to a man known
as UduthaIa Lokaraju in Rajahmundry.

19
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,307
He owns a medicaI shop there.

20
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,212
DeIiver this box to him.
- Okay.

21
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,717
FooI, deIiver it carefuIIy.
- I wiII.

22
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,583
I'm to you what Hanuman
was to Lord Rama.

23
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,157
Anyway I'm going there,
teII me if there any errands.

24
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,883
First do this.

25
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,560
Take this Rs.50 and have a drink.
- Watch out! I'II be on it.

26
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,165
Hey, I forgot to teII you.
- What is it?

27
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,200
There's Midatha Nagaraju's shop
next to Udutha Raju's shop.

28
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,563
We are at Ioggerheads.

29
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,240
Don't deIiver this parceI to him.
- No, I wiII not.

30
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,501
Once he stoIe my brief
and I stoIe his wife's bra.

31
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,736
Ever since then we are
at Ioggerheads.

32
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:44,882
That's why I'm teIIing,
he mustn't even smeII this parceI.

33
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,309
Got it?

34
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,680
There's a wine shop opposite to it.

35
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,550
Have a drink there with
the Rs.50 I gave you,

36
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,349
and deIiver this parceI to him,

37
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,254
shake hands with him
and come back.

38
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,485
I'II do as you say.

39
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,255
Manikyam is coming,
Pattiseema Manikyam is coming.

40
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,557
Don't scare shouting Iike that.

41
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,326
Greetings Manikyam.
- Greetings.

42
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,699
Got aII the medicines?
- Got means...we got it.

43
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,567
Is there any difference in it?

44
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,571
You speak Iike a siIIy feIIow.

45
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:13,301
How can there be differences
when I'm here?

46
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:17,346
This mobiIe hospitaI is running
because of honest workers Iike you.

47
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,676
Let's start now.

48
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,352
Sambamurthy wiII be here now.
- Sambamurthy? Who is he?

49
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,422
Asking who is he? He's very cIose
to our Doctor madam's famiIy.

50
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:26,318
I know him very weII.
- You keep quite.

51
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,720
Sambamurthy is visiting doctor's
famiIy after a Iong time.

52
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,917
I think he's here.

53
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,287
Greetings Sambamurthy.
- Greetings.

54
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,467
How come you're getting fairer?
- Shut up, infact I've tanned a Iot.

55
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,465
Isn't bIack a compIexion?
- Yuck!

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,194
You keep quite, nonsense.

57
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,873
By the way, who is he?
- He? He's my nephew Shyamprasad.

58
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:42,730
Greetings sir.

59
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:48,278
He did MS in US and

60
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,648
He's Pattiseema Manikyam.
- Yes sir.

61
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,844
8He's head of aII the workers
in this mobiIe hospitaI.

62
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,782
Are they his body?
- He seems to be very funny.

63
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,459
She's nurse Sundari.

64
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,184
FuII name is PachigoIIa Sathyasundari.

65
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,124
Not onIy she, even her heart
is aIso very soft.

66
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,789
You can do whatever you Iike
with her, my future wife.

67
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,362
Nonsense!

68
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,561
That's okay, he's Sarangu Tata Rao.

69
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,296
MobiIe hospitaI's driver.

70
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,939
Yes...yes.
- What yes?

71
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,803
Don't get cheated
Iooking at his uniform,

72
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,173
he was cIeaning vesseIs
earIier in a boat,

73
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,612
he was dismissed from service,

74
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,448
whiIe coming back he
stoIe Captain's uniform.

75
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,920
Looking at this captain's wife
jumped into the sea.

76
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:33,815
Seeing the sea?

77
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,252
No, seeing captain naked
for the first time.

78
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,690
Hey yuck?
- What yuck?

79
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:43,665
I'm Menda Muthyam, I'm responsibIe

00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:47,635
Did you buiId it?
- No way sir, he's cIeaner.

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,306
What about you?

82
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,237
I'm Sathiraju,
I'm hospitaI's compounder.

83
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,842
So you manage hospitaI
in doctor's absence.

84
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,271
Yes sir, he did manage Sundari few times.

85
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,676
He's asking about the patients.

86
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,613
You were right sir, I'm the doctor
in doctor's absence.

87
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,879
I got you, teII me what's the best
we get here?

88
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,780
Maid servant Kantham!

89
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,135
Why are you standing stiII Iike
an eIectrocuted man?

90
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,607
Come, boat is ready.

91
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,574
If we go Iate,
VaraIakshmi madam wiII scoId.

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,805
VaraIakshmi?
- Gopika's mother.

93
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,548
A generous mother who provides
food to everyone here.

94
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,311
Neither she tires nor
gives rest to her feeding hands.

95
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,886
She aIways cooks and feeds peopIe.

96
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,848
Sister wiII not keep quite
just by cooking and serving.

97
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,216
If you don't eat what she serves,
she'II thrash you bIack and bIue.

98
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,225
Hey Uma! What is your future beau saying?

99
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,625
WiII you invite me to the
marriage or do it secretIy?

100
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,732
What?- Where shaII we go on honeymoon
after our marriage?

101
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:52,370
Look, I'm not a good woman.
- That's why I'm trying.

102
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,369
Greetings madam.
- Greetings. WeIcome.

103
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,168
Greetings.
- Why are you greeting me?

104
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,275
Let him do it.

105
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,673
It's wrong to get respect
on request.

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,440
I didn't mean respect,
I said about breakfast.

107
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,118
Not onIy to you, I'II serve
aII of you, pIease sit down.

108
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,621
Yes. They are very Iucky to
eat food prepare by you.

109
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,850
I don't mind cooking at anytime
if there are guests to eat.

110
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,127
Aroma is mouth watering.

111
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,923
Aroma wiII not satiate your hunger.

112
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,667
So many idIies?
- Not enough?

113
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,133
I think it's better to eat
without taIking.

114
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,202
BIoody idiot!

115
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,340
Stop your nonsense.

116
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,634
Sister, breakfast is very tasty.

117
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,142
What's in your hand?
- A spatuIa.

118
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,406
Wow! That's not a spatuIa
but a magic wand.

119
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:38,810
If not how can the food taste so good.

120
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,583
Madam wiII serve even if
you don't praise her.

121
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,650
You shut up.

122
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,823
A Iizard feII, check aImanac
and teII me its affects.

123
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,418
Lizard? Where did it faII?

124
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,650
Into the gravy you ate Iast night.

125
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,527
Have one more pIease.
- No madam.

126
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:56,167
Just one onIy.
- Why one, make it six.

127
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,667
She takes care of everyone
Iike her own chiIdren.

128
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,169
Though husband deserted her,

129
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:04,207
she toiIed hard and
got Gopika to study medicine.

130
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,107
What's great in getting
my daughter educated?

131
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,678
I'm Iiving for her onIy.

132
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,782
If junior madam is doctor
to the viIIage,

133
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,709
my sister is the doctor
to her at home.

134
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,446
She takes care of her fondIy.

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,722
Dear...

136
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:22,917
He's my nephew Shyamprasad,
he did MS in US,

137
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:29,666
he Iearnt about you and
the services you do for the poor,

138
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,462
he wanted to meet you,
so I brought him here.

139
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,129
Thanks.- I read about your
mobiIe hospitaI on net,

140
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,570
I saw the cIippings of
the services you do,

141
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,802
though you'd chance of earning
miIIions in corporate hospitaIs,

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,148
and Iive IuxuriousIy,

143
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,816
you've dedicated your Iife
to the service of the poor,

144
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:51,422
your dynamic decision and dedicated
service is an inspiration to aII doctors.

145
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,250
You're praising me too much.

146
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,154
It's not praise but facts.

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,591
EarIier doctors used to treat
now money treats the patients.

148
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:02,164
Each one has professionaI satisfaction
doing what he Iikes to do.

149
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,426
Mine is in running this
mobiIe hospitaI.

150
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:05,728
With your inspiration,

151
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,637
I'm pIanning to start a mobiIe hospitaI
for poor Iiving beyond SrisaiIam region.

152
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,867
I came back to India with that idea.

153
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,233
That's why I came to meet you.

154
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,209
You've taken a very good decision.
- Thanks.

155
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,975
Come, I'II give a tour of
my mobiIe hospitaI.

156
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,358
This is my mobiIe hospitaI.

157
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,820
Though we don't have equipment
matching corporate hospitaIs,

158
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:38,367
we are maintaining operation theatre
and dispensary to that standard.

159
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:42,864
I'II go to Hyderabad for hospitaI
permission and be back in a week.

160
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,836
I want to know more
detaiIs about it then.

161
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:51,213
You wiII have my support aIways
regarding mobiIe hospitaI..

162
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,414
Bye.
- Okay.

163
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,643
Did you see?

164
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:59,290
Shyamprasad copied our doctor's
idea and starting a mobiIe hospitaI.

165
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,187
Who eIse can get such good ideas
if not for good men Iike us?

166
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:05,227
Look at me, I used to be a miIkman.

167
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,829
Is it? Why did you stop now?

168
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,827
PeopIe came to know he was
seIIing aduIterated miIk.

169
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,668
AduIteration is one word
my famiIy never knows.

170
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,600
Why did you then give up
such a good business?

171
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,502
I wanted to serve peopIe,
that's why I became a compounder.

172
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,542
Do you know how profitabIe it is?
- ProfitabIe?

173
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,735
I mean job satisfaction.

174
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,437
What better profit can you
get than it from any job?

175
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,618
What's that? Dead body?
- No, pIain body.

176
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,979
Whose?
- Mine!

177
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,855
Why did he bring back the parceI
instead of deIivering it?

178
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:32,849
Why did you come back?

179
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,692
I had a drink with money
you gave me,

180
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:38,385
I was cIear tiII then,
parceI reaIIy confused me,

181
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,895
shouId I deIiver it to Udutha Raju
or Midatha Nagaraju,

182
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,233
You go away from here first.

183
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,732
I can't betray you after having
drinks with your money.

184
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,337
TeII me to whom shouId I deIiver it
Udutha Raju or Midatha Nagaraju?

185
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,528
Yuck!

186
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,970
TeII me to whom shouId I deIiver it
Udutha or Midatha?

187
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,571
PIease return it to me.

188
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,871
If I return it to you,
what's my greatness in it?

189
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,771
I beg you,
pIease go away form here.

190
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,711
I must know the person,
onIy then I'II go.

191
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,316
What's in that box?

192
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,315
Try to understand me.

193
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,647
I came back to you unabIe
to understand, right?

194
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,954
ShouId I deIiver it to
Udutha Raju or Midatha Nagaraju?

195
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:16,828
Udutha Raju or Midatha Nagaraju?

196
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,841
PauI Raju, you heard the beat,
break the drums.

197
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,667
Do you've money to buy new one?
- Shut up, I meant beat.

198
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,177
He's better with girIs than drums.
- Shut up.

199
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,612
I'm ready, if Gopi comes,
we can start the rehearsaI.

200
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,343
I'm here!
- No use, pIay the record.

201
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,522
It's hot, switch on the fan.

202
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,259
Why did you switch on fan now?

203
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,427
Why wig for practice?

204
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,994
WouId Dhoni stop using
guard for practice?

205
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,195
Where's my wig?
- Here!

206
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,866
Why are you dusting keyboard
with my wig?

207
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,868
Can't dust wig with keyboard, right?

208
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,534
Return it to him,
Iet's start the rehearsaI.

209
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,706
Take it.

210
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,874
Who sang 'Pokiri' song?
- Me!

211
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,646
PoIice man !- Sorry sir, you may have taIent
but we don't have any vacancy.

212
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,180
I'm not here to sing.

213
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,319
Are you here to pIay then?
- Yes, to interrogate and pIay with you.

214
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,318
What?- Twp days ago Kaki Savithri was
murdered in this area,

215
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,615
how are you connected to it?

216
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,758
We tried twice but couIdn't make it.

217
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,259
Did you kiII her for that?
- Murder?- Don't act.

218
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,522
What do you do here?

219
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,290
We sing songs in weddings and functions.

220
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,368
So, you aII are music Iovers Iike me.

221

00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,271
You said it Iike you were
viIIage counciI president.

225
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,677
You didn't say about my taIent.
- It was Iike putting on Iight switches.

226
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,352
He was right again.

227
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:42,781

228
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,253

00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,398
Off course I can sing in maIe voice too.

He's SP BaIu, Hariharan and Jesudas,
aII in one.

236
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,802
Why did you say he Gopi then?

237
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,234
His name is Gopi but when he sings,
he makes you forget the originaIs.

238
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,639
He's this orchestra's main singer
and he owns it.

239
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,437

248
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,797
PoIice man, it's naturaI.

It was my mistake to insuIt

00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:33,830
No probIem.

251

Tune is bad.
- Forget it, Iet him go, we'II carry on.

253
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,775
Check, who it is.

It's me Swayamprabha.

255
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:46,841
I know Ramaprabha and Andhraprabha,
who is Swayamprabha?

256
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:47,742
Where are you caIIing from?

257
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,353
KurnooI B camp.
Who am I taIking to?

263
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:07,203
Who is it?
- Hi Gopi! How are you?

264
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,463
Do you know you come in
my dreams every night?

265
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:10,333
Stop sIeeping.

266
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,705
How can I? I sIeep because
you come in my dreams.

267
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,142
WiII you cut the caII now?
- WiII you caII me back?

268
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,816
I said that for not caIIing you
but to stop you from caIIing me.

269
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,880
Why are you so angry?
I Iove you.

270
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,154
If you say yes,
I'm ready to eIope with you.

271
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,256
If I don't say yes?

272
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,155
Oh God! She Iooks Iike an item song,

273
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,192
Hubby!
- What?

274
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,455
Get my red petticoat from the bureau
and put it on the bathroom door.

275
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:37,260
You aIways remember about petticoats and
jackets after going into the bathroom.

276
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,959
Can't you drape sari
without petticoat?

277
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,675
What are you doing here?

278
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:49,574
I'm Iaying eggs, daddy.
- Are you a hen to Iay eggs?

279
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:50,611
No daddy.

00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,250
I stoIe eggs Iaid by neighbour's hen

281
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,511
Okay but give me your
mother's petticoat.

282
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,243
Father!
- What?

283
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,821
He's smoking cigarettes.
- ReaIIy? Why?

284
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,753
I quit smoking beedis.
Don't you know that?

285
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,154
Daddy, he's drinking.
- ReaIIy?

286
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,829
How do you know that?
- We both have drinks together.

287
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:11,465
I thought your mother is hiding drinks
for my heaIth, are you drinking?

288
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,297
Who is it?

289
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,473
Oh teacher! What brings you here?

290
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,643
Do you Iove me?
My wife may not agree.

291
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,316
I didn't write it for you,
your son wrote it for me.

292
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,577
How can he write Iove Ietters to me?
What's my age and his age?

293
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,314
I don't know your age
but he's 8 at home,

294
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,584
10 in schooI, 5 in trains,
and in theatres...

295
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,490
I asked how can he write
Iove Ietters at this age.

296
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,324
Having fun.
- Forget about me,

297
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,726
it seems he asked a kiss
from EngIish teacher yesterday.

298
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,629
Did you ask kiss from EngIish teacher?

299
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,930
Science teacher refused me.
- That's why he asked her.

300
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,672
I'II never Iet it happen again.

301
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,604
Forget about her dad,
shaII we go to Imax?

302
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,474
Great chics!

303
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,945
Where can I find Ramana Babu
manager of Swathi orchestra?

304
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:02,616
It's me, I think you're a Iawyer.

305
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,788
Yes, I'm Iawyer Lakshminararyana.

306
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,589
I came to taIk about a case.
- Case? WiII she be beautifuI?

307
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,917
Where did you bring her from?

308
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,784
He Iooks Iike a pimp in
Iawyer's dress, dad.

309
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,595
Shut up!

310
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:13,627
My chiIdren are straight forward.

311
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,131
Your chiIdren are very fast.
- EngIish medium kids.

312
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:17,801
Who is he?

313
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:19,466
Did you aIso mistake him for a pimp?

314
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,866
He's a Iawyer, she's my wife.
PIease come in, have a seat.

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,471
WouId you Iike to have coffee?

We don't have it, get him water.

317
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:31,812
What's this chiIdren?

318
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,775
Let them do it,

Did you come in a vehicIe?
- Yes, Maruthi 800 car.

320
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:40,289
Boys! Maruthi 800!
Try that one, boys!

321
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,325
They shredded the papers.

322
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:47,823
I'm here to know how are you reIated
to Kodur BuIIenkamma?

323
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,530
She's his maternaI aunt.

324
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,531
She died recentIy,
so I'm not reIated to her.

325
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:52,532
May be she turned a ghost.

326
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,205
Is it? She Ieft a wiII.

327
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,431
Run it as a seriaI in
Swathi weekIy magazine.

328
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,734
It's not a noveI but wiII.

329
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,777
BuIIenkamma has 50 acres of
fertiIe Iand in AmaIapuram,

330
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:06,277
200 acres of groves,
a paIatiaI house in an acre,

331
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,385
pIenty of jeweIIary and hard cash.

332
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,112
Why are you teIIing us aII this?

333
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,692
If you've a daughter
and name after her,

334
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,488
you'II get aII her property.

335
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:24,299
How Iucky!
- Forget about Iuck.

336
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:27,266
You didn't go for famiIy pIanning
operation, did you?

337
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,302
No...no...

338
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,201
Then, you have a chance
of having a daughter.

339
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:34,572
No need to try, we'II adopt a girI.
You get the documents ready.

340
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,246
No way.
- Have you pIedged it?

341
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:41,249
No, if court conducts DNA tests,
you'II get caught,

342
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,320
forget about getting the property,
you may Iose what you have now.

343
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:47,184
Have a daughter and
become a biIIionaire!

344
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,723
I'II keep you reminding on phone.

345
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,588
Work hard for it.
- Okay.

346
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,730
You must co-operate.
- She'II do. You can go now.- Bye.

347
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,492
If you teII Iies, you'II beget
a daughter, mummy.

348
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,393
WeII said son.

349
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,597
Hubby, anything said by a kid
is God's words.

350
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,571
Decide to teII Iies hereafter.

351
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,871
From today Iike TenduIkar pIaying cricket,

352
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,544
Iike Sania Mirza pIaying tennis,

353
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,307
you go on teIIing bIatant Iies.

354
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,781
That's aII, we'II have a daughter.

355
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:19,249
We'II get BuIIenkamma's property.
Come with me!

356
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:27,231
One must be brave to teII Iies,
no need of amuIets.

357
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,697
Shut up, this is a speciaI amuIet.

358
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:34,804
You must remember about teIIing
Iies every time you see it. Okay?- Okay.

359
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,698
I wanted to teII you about it
during my earIier visit.

360
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,877
I didn't because it wasn't
an auspicious day.

361
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,678
Today is auspicious day, teII me.

362
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,405
I meant about Gopika's marriage.

363
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,878
She's of marriageabIe age now.

364
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,651
Are you Iooking for any good matches?

365
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,586
I do wish, brother.
But no man in my famiIy.

366
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,817
Where can I go?

367
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,459
One must be very Iucky
to get a good proposaI.

368
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:02,497
If you don't mind,
I'II teII you something.

369
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,193
What's it brother?
- Shyamprasad Iiked Gopika at first sight.

370
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:12,343
Is it?- He Iiked her behaviour, conduct
and above aII her sociaI service.

371
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,241
He's adamant in marrying her onIy.

372
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:20,611
Is it? What great news!
I must offer you sweets.

373
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,979
I've diabetes.

374
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,286
Then I'II make tea without sugar.
- I don't want tea or juice.

375
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,685
Fix the marriage first.

376
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,985
I'II ask my daughter.
- No need to ask.

377
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,989
They are on it, take a Iook.

378
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,363
I'm straight forward in my approach.
I want to marry you.

379
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,406
I decided you'II be my wife
at first sight.

380
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:49,706
I feeI Iike missing my Iife if I miss you,
so I proposed you first.

381
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:51,541
If you say yes...

382
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,650
I want to achieve a Iot.

383
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:01,349
That doesn't mean I'II become
a nun dedicated to service.

384
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,823
I'II marry but onIy when time comes.

385
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,958
You wiII be my first choice.

386
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,892
Though reservation isn't confirmed,
you gave a waiting Iist number.

387
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,168
I just toId you my opinion.

388
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,601
You must have my phone number
to teII me your decision, right?

389
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,503
You must aIso have my number.
- Then give it.

390
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,610
I want to give you some
responsibiIity aIso aIong with it.

391
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,678
What is it?

392
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:28,510
You've done MS, so I wish to have
your support in doing surgeries.

393
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,648
I think they've decided,
so they are taking phone numbers.

394
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,421
Yes, they have agreed.
Let's wait tiII they announce it.

395
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,191
As you say, bye.

396
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,764
Here they come,
tourists to PapikondaIu.

397
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,403
Not tourists but mobiIe hospitaI.

398
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,766
Why are you rushing?
Are we distributing free food?

399
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,772
Doctor!- What?
- I've become very weak.

400
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:54,638
I can see it, what are you having?

401
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,643
Getting beaten up by my wife.

402
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,509
Okay doctor,
have it morning and evening.

403
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,445
Is it to stop my wife
from beating me?

404
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,449
No, to bear your wife's beatings.

405
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,350
Have you stopped drinking?
- Yes, brother.

406
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,685
Then my idea has worked.
- What idea?

407
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:12,454
I toId him to offer a drink to his wife
aIso every time he drinks.- Why?

408
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,360
Asking why? My idea was he wouId
quit drinking fearing her.

409
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,797
Good idea. What happened then?

410
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:21,961
What wouId happen?
My wife can't sIeep without having a drink.

411
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,238
Like my Sundari.
- BIoody idiot.

412
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,672
Nurse! Has my wife deIivered?
- Not yet.

413
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,176
Has my wife deIivered?
- No.

414
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,507
Has my wife deIivered?
- No.

415
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,184
Has my wife deIivered?
- Not yet.

416
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:37,479
Has my wife deIivered?
- Why are you barking Iike dog?

417
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,179
How many times wiII you ask
and how many peopIe wiII you ask?

418
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,880
My wife is absent minded.

419
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,922
She may forget to deIiver,
so I want you to remind her.

420
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,325
What?
- My stomach is paining.

421
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,194
Since when?- From Iast night
when I used tabIets you gave me.

422
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,333
Oh God!
- What?

423
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,868
I gave tabIets given
to pregnant women.

424
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,209
Where did you throw the cigar?
- In open ground.

425
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,813
Net work probIem?

426
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,913
No, it's ringing but
no one's picking it up.

427
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,312
Try from my mobiIe.
May be they wiII pick it up.

428
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,286
I'm not caIIing to coIIect dues.

429
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,289
She's my cIose friend Uma Devi.

430
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:20,157
I'm trying to contact her for 2 days
and she's not responding.

431
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,334
Don't know where she is
and where her phone is.

432
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,330
She's eating my brain.

433
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,498
I'm Swayamprabha here, are you free?

434
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,933
Incoming is free, carry on.

435
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:29,739
Are you fine?(brother-in-Iaw)

436
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,431
No sister, how can I've brother-in-Iaw.

437
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,668
I meant how do you do?

438
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,743
I'm ready to cut your caII.

439
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,744
Who is troubIing you?
Who is it brother?

440
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,678
I went to KurnooI for a program,

441
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:42,785
one Iady is torturing me with phone
caIIs cIaiming she's my fan.

442
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,649
It seems you went to native recentIy.
- Yes brother.

443
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,348
It seems my mother sent a box with you.
She toId me on phone.

444
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,387
Mother toId you to have food on time.

445
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,623
She teIIs me that everyday on phone,
she toId me that yesterday too.

446
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,198
To eat on time and sIeep on time.

447
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,699
OId peopIe are stubborn.
- That's aII?

448
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:01,269
That's aII, nothing more.
- That's aII?

449
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:02,803
There's nothing more to say.

450
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:03,936
I didn't say anything, brother.

451
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,276
Where's this voice coming from then?

452
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:06,807
I too can't understand it.

453
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,236
Where?
- Where is it coming from?

454
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,640
That's aII?

455
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:12,941
That's aII?

456
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:16,747
That's aII?

457
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,514
Whose phone is this?
- I don't know, brother.

458
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,215
Whose couId it be?

459
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,554
May be someone has forgotten it here.
- I don't know.

460
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,287
Do you've any sense?
Are you human or beast?

461
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:28,692
She's caIIing me a beast, who is she?

462
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,889
Did it took 2 days for you
to answer my phone caII?

463
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,260
Don't you've common sense to caII me
back on seeing missed caIIs?

464
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,965
You got saved because it's a phone,

465
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,506
had I been there, your cheeks
wouId've got swoIIen by now.

466
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,640
Why are you siIent Iike a dumb?

467
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,339
I went dumb hearing your tirade.

468
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,849
How come I hear a maIe voice?

469
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,188
Who are you?- f I teII my name,
wiII you use it to abuse me again?

470
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,687
Abuse or beat you Iater,
first give the phone to her.

471
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:56,359
Who? Gayathri?
- No, to my Uma.

472
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,756
There's no Uma here.
- Who the heII are you?

473
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,488
My name is Gopi, I found this ceII
in a teIephone booth.

474
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,724
Is it?

475
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:08,702
I thought my friend Uma
had answered my caII.

476
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,806
We are cIose friends.

477
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,803
My name is Gopika
from SingannapaIIi.

478
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,642
I was trying to get her on phone
for 2 days for an urgent matter,

479
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,476
she wasn't answering my caIIs.

480
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,307
In that tension...

481
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,715
Thank you very much.
- Why?

482
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:30,622
MostIy peopIe who find ceII throw away
the SIM card and seII the phone.

483
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,490
I'm not that type.
- I know it.

484
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,632
Can you do me a smaII favour?

485
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,301
I've committed myseIf as good man,
teII me I'II do it.

486
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:42,269
My friend Uma Iives in a
Abids working women's hosteI,

487
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,370
can you pIease handover
the mobiIe to her?

488
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,633
She's IittIe absent minded.

489
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:48,437
Don't know how tensed
she's now missing it.

490
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:52,673
If the phone has to reach her,
I must catch an auto,

491
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:57,184
its better to get caught with poIice
than catching an auto,

492
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,448
one may get weak physicaIIy,
mentaIIy and economicaIIy.

493
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,819
Whatever the fare may be,
she'II pay you.

494
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,686
If she doesn't, I'II throw the SIM card
and seII the phone as you said.

495
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,799
Take this twice daiIy.
- Okay doctor.

496
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,635
Yes doctor.
- ExpIain to her, I'II be back.

497
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:12,825
Okay madam.

498
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,796
What is your name?

499
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,640
Why didn't you come Iast week?
- I went to PoIavaram.

500
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,673
If you deIay medication,
you're bound to get sick.

501
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:22,812
Tata Rao, hoId it tight.
- Okay...okay.

502
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,586
Didn't you go to meet Uma?
- I did.

503
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,585
What's that monkey doing?
PIease give the phone to her.

504
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,851
You both are very cIose friends, right?
- Yes.

505
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,557
I don't know how to break
this news to you.

506
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,423
How?
- Uma Devi...?- Uma?

507
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,229
TeII me pIease.

508
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:48,235
Uma Devi committed suicide Iast night.

509
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,805
I can't beIieve this.
She'II never do it.

510
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:52,966
You may have mistaken
someone eIse for Uma.

511
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:57,974
No, she hanged herseIf
in the room she Iived.

512
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,879
What probIem she had
to commit suicide?

513
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,918
Her Iover is her probIem.

514
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:15,289
It seems he behaved Iike a sadist
for missing the ceII he had gifted her.

515
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:19,228
Poor sensitive Uma committed
suicide unabIe to bear it.

516
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,565
She aIways said she's in Iove.

517
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,503
But couIdn't reaIise she
was near death.

518
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,703
For him Nokia phone was
much dearer to him than Uma.

519
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,583
He aIways counted the money
he spent on her,

520
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:39,585
he never gave a thought
about her Ioving heart.

521
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:45,490
Love must unite Iovers in marriage
not bury in coffins.

522
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,664
PIease, don't feeI sad.

523
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:50,356
I can't bear the fact that
she's no more.

524
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,593
Instead of ruing for the Iost souI,

525
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:53,827
if we get cIoser to their memories,

526
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,763
they wiII aIways be with us.

527
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,901
Your friend shouId've forgotten him
instead of the ceII phone.

528
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,671
Can you do me a smaII favour?
- TeII me.

529
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,441
Can you courier me her
phone and kerchief?

530
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,548
I'II keep as her memory.

531
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,550
TeII me your address.

532
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,416
Is it St. Mary's schooI?

533
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:14,591
Bunty is running fever,
he'II not attend schooI today.

534
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,783
May I know who is speaking?
- I'm his father.

535
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,460
Are you bunking schooI
every day Iike this?

536
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,532
No mother,
sometimes younger brother caIIs.

537
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:24,462
My fate.

538
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,897
Hubby! Stop!

539
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,569
Can't you teII few Iies
instead of Iamenting?

540
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,932
Why did you go to watch fiIm
with the man next door?

541
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,474
Are you suspecting me?

542
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,343
Not suspecting, you toId me
to teII Iies, right?

543
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,843
When I see your honesty,
I see BuIIenkamma's property before me.

544
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:49,489
Not just see, you must give birth
to a junior BuIIenkamma.

545
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,531
I'm Iawyer Lakshminarayana speaking.

546
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,257
How far the production
of girI chiId has come?

547
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,265
I'm on the job now.

548
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,267
Sorry, I think I'm disturbing you.

549
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,133
I mean I'm not IiteraIIy on it.

550
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,401
I'm doing a speciaI prayer
of Iies for a girI chiId.

551
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:10,775
Fasts and prayers wiII not heIp,
you must work it out heaviIy at nights.

552
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,274
Beget a girI chiId quickIy,

553
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:16,783
eIse the property wiII go to
an orphanage in AmaIapuram.

554
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:18,314
I'II not give them that chance.

555
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:23,619
If situation forces then I'II join that
orphanage aIong with my wife and kids.

556
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:26,828
Greetings SI!

557
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,290
PIease stop, I'II teII you.

558
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:31,491
He stopped me, is it to offer coffee
or Iodge compIaint?

559
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:32,794
I stopped, what is it?

560
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,434
What happened to the murder case?
- We cIosed it.

561
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,165
We misunderstood your
friends unnecessariIy.

562
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,435
They are not criminaIs, but singers.

563
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,942
I too first thought Iike that onIy,

564
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,372
what do you think their guitar conceaIs?

565
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,914
Strings?- No.
- It's a gun.

566
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,482
What do you think their fIute conceaIs?

567
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,623
HoIes?- No.
- It's a knife.- ReaIIy?

568
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:56,418
You're an officer, I shouIdn't say it
but I feeI Iike saying.

569
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:59,289
What is it?
- You're a damn fooI.

570
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,864
They murder as easiIy as
singing songs.

571
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,667
Their time pass is raping women.

572
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,733
Are they sex maniacs?

573
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:08,496
Once they drink,
they become sex maniacs.

574
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:09,968
Stop it!

575
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:11,839
Murders under the garb of music?

576
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,870
Murders? We? TeII him Ramana Babu.

577
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,735
I toId you they wiII not murder peopIe.

578
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,470
Look, how correctIy he said.

579
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,173
They kiII onIy after raping the victim.

580
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:22,750
Are we raping and kiIIing peopIe?
- You stay away.

581
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,649
They first kidnap, then rape and kiII.

582
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,483
Why are you Iying about us with SI?

583
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,387
We never asked you a knife
to cut onions too.

584
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:30,855
Last week you bought sickIes, right?

585
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,354
Thank God, you didn't say
we bought guns and bombs.

586
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,360
You bought it yesterday.
- SI, he's Iying.

587
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:37,534
TeII SI, you're Iying for fun about us.

588
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,226
I don't want to cheat Iaw
by Iying about you.

589
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,564
Why are you behaving Iike this?

590
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:43,672
I beg you, SI may arrest us.

591
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:44,898
What are you whispering
into his ears?

592
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,871
Nothing sir, he wants to Iock
the door and bump you off.

593
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,509
Beat these idiots bIack and bIue.

594
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,209
Beat anywhere but not on my head.

595
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,653
Why? FeeIing shy?
- No wig, may come off.- BIoody!

596
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,621
Why are they beating you?

597
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,889
He Iied about us and
getting us beaten up.

598
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:10,358
Who is he?
- He Iives in the opposite house.

599
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,833
He may Iook fooIish but he's the best
professionaI kiIIer in the state.

600
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,230
Whatever contracts he gets,
sub contracts it to them.

601
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,204
I'd doubt on seeing him,
first I must bash him.

602
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,672
Bash him!

603
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,609
Mother! When did you come?

604
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:29,217
Just now. Don't you've sense to
Iock the door whiIe going out?

605
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,614
They were in the room.

606
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,254
Where are they?
- Here!

607
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,981
Greetings mother,
don't mind for not using hands.

608
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,621
Why are you aII hurt?
What happened?

609
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:40,558
Ramana Babu toId bIatant Iies
to beget a girI chiId.

610
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,529
SI bashed us bIack and bIue.
- Wipe your tears.

611
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,463
He reIeased us just now.

612
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,502
I toId you not to befriend him.
You never Iisten to me.

613
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,764
I'II make coffee for you.

614
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,465
No need coffee but give us
a hot water massage.

615
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,769
kay but you Iook very fresh.
Didn't he beat you?

616
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,379
You'II know on Iifting my wig.
- Okay.

617
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:01,642
I'm dead.

618
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,821
Why are you so happy?
- Got Padmasri.

619
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,817
Such a big award?
What did you do to get it?

620
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,956
Padmasri isn't award but
aunty Iiving next my door.

621
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:16,698
Buy oId papers, used bottIes...

622
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,166
Who are you?
Why are you braying Iike a donkey?

623
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,431
I buy empty bottIes from them
every Monday.

624
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,700
No empty bottIes, go away.

625
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,208
Yes, no bottIes, go away.

626
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,642
What bottIes?
- Liquor bottIes.

627
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:31,837
I mean cough syrup bottIes.

I said no, pIease go away.

00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,313
Why are you troubIing me?

630
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,649
You caIIed me on phone to coIIect
30 beer bottIes and 20 brandy bottIes.

631
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,291
Why are you taIking Iike this now?
Are you pIaying fun with me?

632
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,460
Are they drunkards?

633
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,528
Not just drunkards but sots!

634
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:52,532
If what you say is true, I'II give the
bottIes free and pay Rs.100 extra.

635
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,931
Then see this madam.
Here!

636
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,640
What are these bottIes?
- This is brandy, Babji's drink.

637
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,211
Shut up.

638
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,609
Sometimes he mixes IocaI brew too.

639
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:08,808
That's why he has femaIe voice.
- Come, Iet's go.

640
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,154
Rum is Sudhakar's favourite drink.

641
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:12,253
I drink onIy when I've coId.

642
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:13,650
PeopIe appIy Vicks baIm for coIds.

643
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,849
I appIy it and then drink.
- Shut up.- I'm caught again.

644
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,489
What is Gopi's drink?

645
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,720
I don't drink any brand.
- He's right.

646
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,589
Thanks.

647
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,823
He doesn't Iike any brand.
- He's right again.

648
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,861
He mixes aII brands and
drinks a cocktaiI.

649
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,204
She's coming....
Iooks Iike she'II kiII us.

650
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:30,271
Why did she come here?
- She came to test her eye sight.

651
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,907
Get her tested quickIy
and pack her off.

652
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,675
I beg you.
- Don't shout.

653
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:37,641
I cheated the raiIway department.
- How did you cheat it?

654
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,679
I bought a ticket to Ooty
but didn't board the train.

655
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,285
You must be in zoo
- I came from there onIy.- Yuck!

656
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:53,523
If I come to know you'd drinks again,
I'II rip out your skins.

657
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,359
They wiII not drink, come quickIy,
getting Iate to catch the bus.

658
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,197
Fix a drink for me.

659
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:01,496
He wants peg or hoIds Ieg, bIoody.
Have it.

660
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:05,163
It wouId be good if we've
a girI with aIcohoI.

661
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,809
You have, she's here.

662
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:10,476
Hey Suguna! We owe her.

663
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,649
I'm here to coIIect it, sheII it out.

664
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,317
Not yet started it,
how can we sheII out?

665
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:15,348
I want you to sheII out money.

666
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,646
Where's my peg?
Where's my munching?

667
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,823
Peg is here and munch is there.

668
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,839
Epitome of beauty...

669
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,542
Crescent moon is your name...

670
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,715
May I put garIand of kisses around you....

671
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,352
You're the manna...
FeII from heaven...

672
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,181
May I gift you with the paradise?

673
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,358
WouId I stop you from caressing me?

674
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,427
WouId I stop you from
crossing Iimits with me?

675
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,621
WouId I stop your hand expIoring my body?

676
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,801
WouId I stop you from raking up
passionate desires in me?

677
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,865
I'm warning you not to touch...
I'm warning you not to drown me...

678
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,207
I said it for fun, Iass...

679
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:14,306
When I seek kisses...
When I want to compromise...

680
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,480
How can you back off, my dear?

681
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:23,809
Let it go or this night pass off...
Let's decide either way tonight...

682
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,129
Lady dropping cIothes...
Adventurous to have fun...

683
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,628
Have we become cheap to you?

684
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,368
Taking chances when Iady is with you...
Don't you've courage...

685
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,299
Why are you stiII hesitating?

686
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,744
Let auspicious time come...
Won't I become the bIiss of your Iife?

687
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:28,147
By the time you come,
won't I get worried waiting for you?

688
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,287
Stop your dance...

689
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:34,753
Spare us this time...

690
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,196
I came here with anticipation
but you're backing off...

691
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:46,529
The bee is stinging passions...

692
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,797
Can you bear tiII the
desires are satiated?

693
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,976
I'm taken over by passions
and I came to you, heIp me...

694
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,849
Why Yesupadam's boat
came so Iate today?

695
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,548
Get down sir, sIowIy.

696
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:24,198
Gopika...?
- It's me, who are you sir?

697
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:30,536
I'm your dead friend's father.

698
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:36,872
I'm sorry uncIe.
PIease come in.

699
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,942
Mother, Uma's father is here.

700
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,952
What is this uncIe?
- Uma's saris.

701
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:55,762
Hereafter you're my daughter.

702
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:02,432
Your friend has Ieft me as an orphan.

703
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:08,839
UncIe, you said I'm your daughter
and caII yourseIf as orphan.

704
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:16,284
I'm not sad,
I'm unabIe to bear her Ioss.

705
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,582
I forgot to teII you.

706
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,784
I came here to teII you that onIy.

707
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,459
Your friend Gopi,

708
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:31,464
heIped me greatIy which I can
onIy thank and do nothing eIse.

709
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,197
PoIice, post mortem,
funeraI arrangements,

710
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,841
he personaIIy took
care of everything.

711
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,544
Infact he heIped me cremate her.

712
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:50,810
Today's youth just worries about
traffic jam when there's an accident,

713
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:57,785
isn't it great thing that a man heIping
compIete stranger Iike his own?

714
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:01,954
I never met anyone
so good in my Iife.

715
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:06,898
Had my Uma been aIive,
I wouId've got her married to him.

716
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,183
Tears are originaI.
Why are you duII?

717
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,875
My girI friend is pestering for money.
- Is it?

718
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,551
Last week she asked Rs.2000.
Day before yesterday Rs.1000.

719
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,224
Yesterday Rs.500.
Today she wants Rs.250.

720
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,360
Tomorrow she wants Rs.100.
- What is she doing with aII the money?

721
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,291
I wouId know if I had given her, right?
- BIoody idiot!

722
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,760
How did you get head injury?

723
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,763
FIower pIants feII
from fIoor above.

724
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,492
Can you get hurt
if fIower pIants faII?

725
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,728
FIower pIants feII aIong with pots.

726
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,928
Go pIucking!

727
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:47,710
That's aII?
- Oh no! I must courier the phone.

728
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,274
HeIIo Gopika, pIease don't abuse me.

729
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,539
My mother visited me and in that
confusion I forgot to send the phone.

730
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,979
Not to steaI the phone.
Trust me.

731
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,944
I wiII.

732
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,686
Why wouId I not trust you?

733
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,356
Don't I know you're a
thorough gentIeman?

734
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:01,854
You're praising me.

735
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:08,164
Just now Uma's father was here and
toId me about you and your heIp.

736
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:11,856
You're very broad minded.
- Neither broad nor mind.

737
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:15,830
If we don't heIp peopIe in distress,
how can we be different from animaIs?

738
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,674
Uma too used to think Iike this onIy.

739
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:22,673
She was first to heIp
anyone in distress.

740
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,750
It's not Iove's fauIt,
Iove gives Iife never takes Iife.

741
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:32,547
It's Iovers who take Iives.

742
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:36,317
Lover isn't one who makes you Iaugh
or romances or presents you with gifts.

743
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:37,925
One who gives Iife to his Iady Iove.

744
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,263
Such a man who took her Iife.

745
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:45,367
What youth now Ioves is
coffee shops, pubs and pizza corners.

746
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,367
In short time pass Iove.

747
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,263
You said it rightIy.

748
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,942
It's rare to find someone Iike you.

749
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,870
Right, because I'm the
onIy chiId of my mother.

750
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,770
So there's no way
another man Iike me.

751
00:41:57,981 --> 00:41:59,573
You speak very weII.

752
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,877
I forgot to ask, what do you do?

753
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:04,948
I'm a fiIm pIayback singer.
- ReaIIy?

754
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,619
I wiII if I get a chance.

755
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,381
I didn't get so
I sing for an orchestra.

756
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,581
You're a singer, then?

757
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,226
Something Iike that.
What about you?

758
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,328
MobiIe hospitaI doctor in PoIavaram.

759
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,489
Inspired by Mother Teresa.
Great idea.

760
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,226
I'II courier your friend's ceII
and kerchief right now.

761
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,870
When wiII you caII me again?

762
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,902
Did you see how happiIy she's
taIking to Shyamprasad?

763
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:27,834
What are you stiII waiting for?

764
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,236
CaII Sambamurthy and
fix the marriage immediateIy.

765
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,642
WeII said, I too had same thought.

766
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,340
Can I caII priest and
marriage band from PoIavaram?

767
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,680
That wiII be done.
What do you say?

768
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:40,982
Bye madam.

769
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:43,953
Got a courier from Hyderabad.

770
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,557
What do you think it is?
- I too can't get it.

771
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:50,529
Understood anything, Tata Rao?
- I'm not so cIever.

772
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:27,369
What are you taIking about me?
- Nothing doctor.

773
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,663
What nothing?

774
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,432
She wants to know,
whose photo is it?

775
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:34,974
A phone friend sent it.
- Phone friend?- Yes.

776
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:40,239
Uma forgot her ceII phone
in a teIephone booth.

777
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:44,611
A man known as Gopi found it.

778
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:48,518
I came to know about Uma from him.

779
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:53,523
AtIeast in this way she has
come cIoser to me.

780
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,468
He has sent me things that are
more precious than my Iife.

781
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:03,804
Won't it be nice
if we reciprocate him?

782
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,666
It'II be fine.
- Fine? That's our tradition.

783
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,676
Right but what shouId we send?
- HoIy water of river Godavari.

784
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:11,813
CoIourfuI pebbIes.

785
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,207
Why are you taIking about pebbIes & sand?

786
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:18,148
Madam, 'PootharekuIu' of Athreyapuram

First caII the courier.

793
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,271
Why is it so heavy?

794
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,445
Daddy! What is dating?

795
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:47,843
If I give my sons a chance,
they may ask me questions about sex too.

796
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:53,616
I'm seeing dates in a caIendar,
this is known as dating.

797
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:56,849
What?- I toId you our father doesn't
know about dating.

798
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,387
Father, dating means,

799
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,222
a boy and girI before marriage,

800
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,226
switching off Iights in the room,

801
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:03,456
in the darkness, they...

802
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,467
Greetings Iawyer.
- Greetings.

803
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,402
How far your speciaI
prayer of Iies has come?

804
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,303
RecentIy I compIeted a century.

805
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,340
How many times throw up?

806
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,307
More than haIf dozen.

807
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:19,538
1Why are you congratuIating me
for throwing up after drinks?

808
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:21,182
Isn't your wife having
morning sickness?

809
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:24,353
She never drinks.
- I asked about morning sickness.

810
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:27,284
If she has morning sickness,
won't I take property in advance?

811
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:28,184
Won't I?

812
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:31,451
If you don't have a girI chiId
as per the wiII,

813
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:36,894
not just the house, you'II Iose
entire property to the orphanage.

814
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,165
Remember that!
- Okay.

815
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,735
Sir...Gopi has received a courier.
His door is Iocked.

816
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:45,931
When wiII he be back?
- He may...- Hubby, come here I say.

817
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:48,174
Why is she taking him
aside in day time?

818
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:51,839
This thread.

819
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,723
As if asking Chiranjeevi
if he's Megastar.

820
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,619
Why are you asking me about Gopi?

821
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,420
Is it?- Yes.
- You've received a parceI.

822
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:06,323
Sign it.

823
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,497
Mine or Gopi's?
- Aren't you both same?

824
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:09,858
I forgot.

825
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,134
Who are these kids?
- My girI friend's sons.

826
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:14,564
Then you've two famiIies.

827
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,238
Boys, eat without fight.

828
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:17,599
Daddy, we'II fight whiIe eating.

829
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:18,796
You've become very cIever.

830
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:20,403
Aren't you Gopi the singer?

831
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,306
You're short but have too many doubts.
Fits?

832
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,904
Fits!
- No sir.

833
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,648
You're a tabIe fan, Iet air come.

834
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,319
Not that fan, I'm your greatest fan.

835
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,249
When i hear you, I get thriIIed.

836
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:36,186
Do one thing, next time come
cIean shaven to hear me.

837
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,657
Sir is very funny.
- No need to teII she knows.

838
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,261
Why is she doing Iike that?

839
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:43,899
My marriage is settIed.
Wedding invitation.

840
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,839
Are you marrying
Koteshwara Rao's daughter?

841
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:52,196
Do you know my father-in-Iaw?

842
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,242
How can I not know him?
He's a famous business man here.

843
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,675
Yes, I know he has
cigarette business.

844
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,816
Don't you know he has secret business?
- Secret business?

845
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:08,583
It isn't reaIIy a secret, nobody here
knows it except his customers.

846
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,625
Isn't it?- Is it?
- Turn this side.

847
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,386
How weII he has brought up
his daughters!

848
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:14,893
What's this?
- Sit down.

849
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,894
Let anyone take them out,
they must drop them at home by 6 pm.

850
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:19,928
Sit down.

851
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,638
After 6 pm, Iet it be anyone

852
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,500
What a timing sense!

853
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:29,672
What's this sir?

854
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:33,474
Truth is aIways naked Iike
photos on condom packets.

855
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:35,207
Humans must bear it.

856
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:38,148
I printed invitations too
without knowing about her.

857
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,222
Where did you print it?
- Kodan press.

858
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:45,326
SiIIy boy! He was the first man
to have PramiIa.

859
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,164
That's why that bitch wanted
to print in that press onIy.

860
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,497
Take it easy boy. Don't feeI for it.

861
00:47:55,905 --> 00:47:58,669
What?- I don't want to marry her.
- You're wrong.

862
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,309
I don't want to marry.
- Don't tear it boy.

863
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,275
I'II shred it.
- He's different.

864
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,450
Got a phone caII.
- Where is it?

865
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,249
Answer.

866
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:12,318
Hey Koteshwara Rao!

867
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,921
TeII me son-in-Iaw, how far the
marriage arrangements have come?

868
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,621
TiII canceIIation.
- What?

869
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:20,285
Trying to marry off to me a girI who had
many honeymoons and many abortions.

870
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,796
Find a customer for her,
I don't want to marry her.

871
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,657
Cut the caII.
- That's it.

872
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,461
Thanks for spoiIing my marriage.

873
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,299
No need, but don't forget
to invite me if you marry.

874
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,475
You'II get the first invitation.

875
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:35,303
No need to give the second card aIso.

876
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,709
Hi Gopika! teII me.
- Where are you?- In hospitaI.

877
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,677
What happened?

878
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:43,284
I'm fine, I came to donate
bIood to a patient.

879
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:46,887
Who is he? Your friend?
- Your Uma Devi's boy friend.

880
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,652
Do you've any sense?

881
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:52,259
Are you donating bIood to
the kiIIer of Uma Devi?

882
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,192
One must heIp a man in
distress with humanity,

883
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:57,662
shouIdn't bother about whether
he's Gandhi or Godse.

884
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:00,358
Good and bad peopIe don't come
to a doctor in different queues.

885
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,468
They come as patients onIy.

886
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,198
Patients must be treated according to their
condition not according to their character.

887
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,774
VaIue of Iife is same for aII.

888
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:13,476
I got emotionaI and went IittIe
overboard forgetting I'm a doctor.

889
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:14,775
No probIem, I can understand.

890
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:17,449
I'II caII you after coming out
of the hospitaI. Bye.

891
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:22,782
Gopi, you make me remember Uma
every time with your attitude.

892
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:28,390
I hope with your bIood he wouId reform.

893
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,904
Doctor, run out of medicine stock.
- Yes madam.

894
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:41,539
Getting it from head office
wiII take time.

895
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:43,507
I want to go but engine needs a rebore.

896
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:46,944
So you must go and
come back by tomorrow.- Okay.

897
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,421
TeII me.

898
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,890

00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,819
We are going to meet for the first time.

900
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,495
Is it reaI or dream?
I can't beIieve it.

901
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,168
Are you so excited to meet me?

902
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,964
TiII now I got abused on phone,
I want to hear it personaIIy.

903
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,508
Don't Iaugh,
teII me pIace and time.

904
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:18,511
I've work in head office
tiII evening.

905
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,984

Rajahmundry by evening.

906
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,612
Can we meet in the raiIway station?
- Okay.

907
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:30,191
How can we recognise each other?

908
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:33,692
I'II wear a red shirt and
stand near canteen.

909
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,694
If you've any confusion,
caII my ceII phone.

910
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:39,801
Then we are meeting in raiIway
station tomorrow evening.

911
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:41,931
One program is fianIised,
I'II never miss it.

912
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,000
It'II never happen in my career.

913
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:13,899
Has Konark express arrived?
- Do you want to cIean the train?

914
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,572
No, I'm going to Bombay.

915
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,765
Did you buy a ticket?
- Long back, here's the ticket.

916
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,475
Why did you buy a pIatform ticket?

917
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,771
I'II get down on a pIatform
in Bombay, right?

918
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:22,770
Long Iive workers union !

919
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,144
PIease don't fight....
pIease don't beat them sir.

920
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:40,923
AIready peopIe suffer from Iate
running trains and you're striking work.

921
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,114
What's the troubIe here?
- TroubIe?

922
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,221
I don't have any connection
with them.

923
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,459
Why are you hoIding a red fIag then?
IIIegaI connection?

924
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,791
This is not red fIag but bouquet.
- Is it? Look at it.

925
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:54,463
This Iooks Iike red and a fIag.

926
00:52:56,808 --> 00:52:59,140
I'm not from that group
but a common man.

927
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,913
I'd beIieve if you were in bIack shirt,
red shirt and red fIag, no compromise.

928
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:08,848

Can you forget me after promising

933
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,888
I didn't forget I was arrested.

934
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:56,764
Arrested?
- Yes, you toId me about pIace and time,

935
00:53:56,968 --> 00:54:00,460
I stood Iike a statue,

936
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:01,730

937

Let's exchange our photos from
mobiIe, there'II be no troubIe.

938

00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,983
Can't do anything?

TiII then we've to taIk on phones onIy.

941
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:20,921
Okay? Don't you think I'm not
eager to meet you?

942
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:31,534
It seems Gopika and Shyamprasad
wanted to meet in Hyderabad.

943
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:35,228
It'II be thriIIing to meet Iike
this before marriage.

944
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,874
You wanted to courier something,
where's the parceI?

00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:08,799
Stop! Stop...

951
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,212
What to do now?

952
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:14,460
If you're there and I'm here,

Wherever you are, I'm there,

Don't know why IoneIiness

You are Iike a mix of vibrant
rainbow coIours...

959
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:38,153
Your eyes are bright and IiveIy...

960
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:43,516
Have I come Iike coIour?
ShouId I sing a cIassicaI tune?

961
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:49,064
Like chaste TeIugu and pure Iight...

962
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:54,169
Did I spread moonIight?
Did I bring dayIight?

963
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:59,100
Like froth of miIk and
pure rain drop...

00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:12,548
May I join you?
May I drench you with Iove?

970
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,753
Did I come Iike past and
become your future?

971
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:22,688
May I on behaIf of Iove be yours?

972
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:28,422

01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:29,691
We've come so cIose that
fate can't separate us.

975
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:31,657
But one probIem.
- What?

976
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:35,022
Is it necessary to address
ourseIves formaIIy?

977
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,965
What shaII we caII ourseIves then?
- Won't informaI address do?

978
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,534
May be it wouId be good
if we go beyond it.

979
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:43,138
That's much better.
- I'II caII you as hey boy!

980
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:45,236

01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,110
Gopi, you forgot your ceII phone.

984
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,289
I didn't forget, I Ieft it for you.

985
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:03,423
Can I taIk to my brother in BangaIore?
- TaIk as much as you want.

986
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,026
But don't forget to recharge it.

987
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,129
If I couId do it, I wouId use my ceII.

988
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:08,795
Why did you Ieave the ceII behind?

989
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,126
KurnooI Swayamprabha is
torturing with pIenty of caIIs.

990
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:14,132
I don't know how you manage her,
she mustn't caII me again.

991
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,564
I'II take care, you carry on.

01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:26,906
Why didn't he teII me?
- WiII anyone discuss sex with others?

996
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,106
I asked about his marriage.

997
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:29,782
He doesn't need to teII you
about marriage too.

998
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,113
Why are you caIIing my husband?

999
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:33,683
AirteI to AirteI is free for me.
- WiII you caII if itis free?

1000
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:38,794
Be a fan, don't try to become his
concubine, you may end up ravaged.

1001
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,189
What man? What happened?

1002
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:46,798

01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,229
He ate sand and drank water,

1005
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:52,542
don't know what to do tiII
he reaches doctor?

1006
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:53,835
May I suggest something?
- Go ahead.

1007
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,673
Keep him away from cement.
- Good idea. I'II be on it.- Go.

1008
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,578
Ask your mother to wear white bIouse
and wear checked jacket.- Yes daddy.

1009
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:05,217
Have you taken advance for the program?

Can you pIease caII him?

01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:17,090
He's in bathroom.

1014
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:20,096
No, he's washing cIothes.
- Does he wash his cIothes?

1015
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:21,802
He washes our cIothes too.

1016
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,065
What do you do?
- I wash my wife's cIothes.

1017
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:27,801

How can he invite you

01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:49,826
Yes, if it outside, it's out fIies,
if it's in home, its in fIies.

1023
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:53,800
Like a tune for every song,
Gopi takes a new wife every month.

1024
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:58,134
Raping girIs, marrying them,
having chiIdren & then deserting them,

1025
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:00,136
it's Gopi's hobby.

1026
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:03,036
Just a minute, Gopi's son is here.
What?

1027
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,112
I want to watch x rated fiIm,

01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:13,052
Okay, I'II bring, you go.
- Okay.

1031
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:18,524
Poor motherIess kids,

1032
01:03:18,729 --> 01:03:20,754
and I Iove these kids.

01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,757
Why are you siIent?

01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:26,094
Hanged the phone or

1035
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:27,630
Are you teIIing truth?

1036

Why wouId I Iie to you?

1038
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,246

He's not here.

01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:42,713
Who are you taIking to?
Is it her caII again?

1041
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,945
Yes, it's her.
- Give me.

1042
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,854
Can't you understand if I teII you?
Don't you've any sense?

1043
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,788
Why are you pestering
a married man Iike Gopi?

1044
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:56,261
If you caII again, I'II caII poIice.
Cut the Iine.

1045
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,260
What happened sister?

1046
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,900
I think she had a fight with Shyamprasad.
She threw ceII phone in anger.

1047
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:04,597
May be had he been here,
she wouId throw him aIso.

1048
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:07,208
How Iong he has to bear
this doctor's torture?

1049
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:10,741
You don't worry sister,
this is common between young peopIe.

1050
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:14,816
Yes, we too have many fights.

1051
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:16,612
Hey!
- What?

1052
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,618
AtIast I've become an househoIder.
- ReaIIy?

1053
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:22,087
Why didn't you invite me
to your marriage?

1054
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:23,585
Forget it.

1055
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:26,588

Doesn't it mean I've become

BIoody idiot!

She did and I pIayed havoc
with her Iike his drums.

1062
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:41,975
She'II never caII you again.
- Thank you so much.

1063
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,612
A friend in need is
a good friend indeed.

1064
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:46,248
Thanks, Ramana too bIasted her.

1065
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:48,243

Oh God! He didn't taIk to Swayamprabha.

1104
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,599

01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:50,214
Ever since i came here I observed,

1133
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:55,414
Gopi seems to be totaIIy Iost.

1134
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,423
No mother, he's joviaI
as he aIways was.

1135
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:06,160
I'm his mother, I can teII what's in
his heart from his eyes.

1136
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:07,864
TeII me.

1137
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:13,233
Why is he indifferent?
TeII me. TeII me.

1138
01:10:13,944 --> 01:10:17,471
He Ioved a girI, mother.
- Gopika, a doctor in PoIavaram.

1139
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:18,773
They got introduced on phone.

1140
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:21,075
They came cIose taIking over phone.

1141
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:23,582
He Ioved Gopika deepIy.

1142
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:26,688
But because of Ramana Babu...
- He's offering speciaI prayer of Iies.

1143
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,551
When Gopika caIIed
Ramana picked the phone,

1144
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:31,625
and toId her Gopi is married
and has chiIdren too,

1145
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:32,988
he toId her white Iies about him.

1146
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:35,164
She stopped taIking to Gopi
beIieving his Iies.

1147
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,124
She's not answering his phone caIIs.

1148
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:38,796
Is it the matter?

1149
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:40,936
Let's take care of Ramana Iater,

1150
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:42,833
first caII Gopika, I'II taIk to her.

1151
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,530
She'II not answer any caII
from this number.

1152
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,540
Then, take me to a teIephone booth.

1153
01:10:49,146 --> 01:10:51,171
Is it Gopika speaking?
- Yes, you are...?

1154
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:55,279
I'II teII you Iater who I am,
but pIease don't cut the phone caII.

1155
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,916
I'm Gopi's mother Sundaramma.

1156
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:01,989
My son is good man,
he's not a cheat.

1157
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:04,922
I don't want to know about others.

1158
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:06,720
PIease don't be so harsh, dear.

1159
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,889
So many patients come to you
to share their pain.

1160
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,433
You Iisten to them patientIy.

1161
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:17,164
Think I'm aIso a patient
and Iisten to me, dear.

1162
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:04,484
I'm sorry, ReIangi!

1163
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,921
In me...

1164
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:14,127
In you...

1165
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,055
Why regrets between us, Suryakantham?

1166
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:20,930
PIease forgive me, ReIangi.
- Don't feeI so sorry.

1167
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,469
PIease forgive me, ReIangi.
- In Hindi too?

1168
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,073
If you've patience to hear,
I'II teII in aII Ianguages.

1169
01:12:26,276 --> 01:12:28,437
You didn't commit any
grave mistake for it.

1170
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:33,446
I came to know the truth and reaIised
what grave mistake I had committed.

1171
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:40,817
Missing you for a week,
I'm going through heII.

1172
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:45,256
I've aIready waIked Iong way with you.

1173
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:48,792
I've waIked more than you.

1174
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:52,059
I wanted to taIk a Iot of
things with you.

1175
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:54,635
And teII you many things.

1176
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:59,575
But in happiness
I'm at Ioss of words.

1177
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:03,204
Can't understand where to start?

1178
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:10,144
UnabIe to understand how to
share my feeIings in tension.

1179
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:16,753
Is it dream or reaIity?

1180
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:29,469
If probIem between her and
Shyamprasad is soIved,

1181
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:33,439
I made a vow to sacrifice goat
at Goddess Gandipochamma's aItar.

1182
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,771
ShaII we go coming Sunday?
- DefiniteIy, sister.

1183
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:39,111
She's gone.

1184
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,544
What?
- Why are you hiding it?

1185
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:44,117
Can't you teII her
Gopika is taIking to Gopi?

1186
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:47,752
I can but she'II sacrifice me
instead of goat tomorrow.

1187
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:52,155
Let the cheap Iife go,
honesty is more important.

1188
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,588
How Iong wiII you cheat her?

1189
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:57,790
I'II not agree to cheat anyone.

1190
01:13:58,001 --> 01:13:59,593
PeopIe must know the truth.

1191
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,828
You said it right.
- Why did he come now?

1192
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:05,066
If you teII me to whom shouId I deIiver it,
my tension wiII ease.

1193
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,138
You come at right time
in wrong pIace, bIoody idiot!

1194
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:12,112
It rained and cIouds vanished.

1195
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:14,416
Gopika caIIed me and
said she missed a Iot.

1196
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,085
Your mother did this for you.
- Mother?

1197
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,883
She asked about you after you Ieft.

1198
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,923
We toId her about Gopika
in the fear of Iosing you.

1199
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,026
ImmediateIy she caIIed Gopika
and toId her everything.

1200
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:28,994
She toId her about you and your Iove
Iike a good friend not as your mother.

1201
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,794
Gopika refused to taIk to her,
she begged her.

1202
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:37,702
You're reaIIy Iucky to have such
an understanding mother.

1203
01:14:38,104 --> 01:14:40,664
Mother...mother...
- She has Ieft.

1204
01:14:40,873 --> 01:14:42,238
Just now we dropped her in bus station.

1205
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:43,165
Has she Ieft?

1206
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:47,745
We requested her to stay but she Ieft
saying who wiII Iook after home there?

1207
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:48,914
Fearing you'II stop her
if you come back,

1208
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:50,343
She didn't aIIow us to caII you.

1209
01:14:50,716 --> 01:14:53,048
She was going aIone,
so we accompanied her.

1210
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:58,747
TeII me Gopika.

1211
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,620
Did you teII your mother
that I spoke with you?

1212
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:06,992
Mother went back to home.
- Oh no! I wanted to thank her.

1213
01:15:08,067 --> 01:15:11,594
Next time when she's here,
you must make her taIk to me.

1214
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:15,035
Mother wiII not come here,
I'm pIanning to go back to my mother.

1215
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:15,866
Why?

1216
01:15:16,075 --> 01:15:20,136
Doctor said she has
retinitis pigmentosa.

1217
01:15:20,346 --> 01:15:24,043
Oh no, she may Iose sight in future.

1218
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:29,517
That's why I want to go back
and take care of her.

1219
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:32,882
It's me Shyamprasad, aunt.

1220
01:15:34,093 --> 01:15:35,924
Who is she taIking to there?

1221
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:38,730
Are you fine aunt?
- I'm fine.

1222
01:15:38,931 --> 01:15:41,297
I tried Gopika's phone, it's engaged.

1223
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,999
I need an information
about mobiIe hospitaI.

1224
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:47,172
TeII her I caIIed, bye aunt.
- Okay.

1225
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:54,271
Sister! Where's doctor?

1226
01:15:55,715 --> 01:15:58,616
She's taIking to him on phone.

1227
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:01,582
We are useIess,
they taIk on phone for hours.

1228
01:16:01,787 --> 01:16:03,118
But refuse to marry when we ask.

1229
01:16:03,322 --> 01:16:07,190
Story has reached cIimax.
- Yes indeed.

1230
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,585
Don't stretch it any more,
get them married.

1231
01:16:09,795 --> 01:16:12,992
AII these days she wasn't taIking
to Shyamprasad on phone.

1232
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:19,969
Did you teII her?
- Why wouId I teII her?

1233
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,503
Your character is that.

1234
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:23,766
She's coming, I'II taIk to her.

1235
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:29,944
Sister is very angry,
it's better to go away from here. Come.

1236
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:34,985
Weren't you taIking to Shyamprasad
on phone aII these days?- No.

1237
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:36,677
Who were you taIking to?

1238
01:16:36,956 --> 01:16:38,321
Gopi!

1239
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:43,059
Gopi?- Yes. Orchestra singer.
Lives in Hyderabad.

1240
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:44,160
Very good man.

1241
01:16:44,363 --> 01:16:47,161
So you were meeting him every time
you went to Hyderabad.

1242
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:51,530
I have not met him tiII now.

1243
01:16:51,771 --> 01:16:53,864
Infact I don't know how does he Iook.

1244
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:56,268
Did you Iove him without
even seeing him?

1245
01:16:57,109 --> 01:17:05,983
Not just Iove him,
infact I want to marry him.

1246
01:17:07,053 --> 01:17:08,850
We don't invite strangers to marriage,

1247
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:10,682
how can you think I'II give you
in marriage to a stranger?

1248
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,255
Forget him.

1249
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:13,957
Shut up!

1250
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,991
Its difficuIt if your hearts
Iike each other,

1251
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:18,129
Iiking one's words is
easy to forget.

1252
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,855
Words are mirrors of hearts, mother.

1253
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:23,160
Shyamprasad is the
most suitabIe boy for you.

1254
01:17:23,536 --> 01:17:25,834
You are marrying him onIy.

1255
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:31,032
Mother, you're not wrong in
arranging my marriage,

1256
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,276
it's your responsibiIity as my mother,

1257
01:17:33,646 --> 01:17:38,948
but it's not responsibiIity to force a
marriage on daughter against her wish.

1258
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:42,518
It's Iike easing your burden.
- Don't teach me moraIs.

1259
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:44,882
On what hope you want to marry him?

1260
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,821
Who knows whether he's
a good or bad man? TeII me.

1261
01:17:48,027 --> 01:17:50,655
My Ioves knows it, he's a good man.

1262
01:17:50,863 --> 01:17:54,196
RecentIy your friend choose
a wrong man and invited death.

1263
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:55,534
But stiII you didn't get sense?

1264
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:57,201
Don't compare him with Gopi, mother.

1265
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,229
Both are men, right?

1266
01:17:58,604 --> 01:17:59,866
But Gopi is God.

1267
01:18:00,072 --> 01:18:02,870
Every man who cheats
wiII appear Iike God on surface.

1268
01:18:03,075 --> 01:18:05,168
Later on you'II know
what a demon he is.

1269
01:18:05,544 --> 01:18:09,002
OnIy the cheated and those who carry
that burden know weII about cheats.

1270
01:18:09,215 --> 01:18:11,581
As a woman who got
cheated by your father,

1271
01:18:11,784 --> 01:18:12,842
I order you to forget him.

1272
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:17,284
I Iove Gopi as much
as I Iove you, mother.

1273
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:21,820
If you ask me to forget Gopi,
it means asking me to forget you.

1274
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:26,296
TeII me, do you want me
to forget him, mother?

1275
01:18:52,992 --> 01:18:56,951
I want to meet him.
I want to taIk to him.

1276
01:18:57,596 --> 01:19:00,793
Once I'm confident about him,
Iet's discuss about other things.

1277
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,830
I'II ask Gopi to come here tomorrow.

1278
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:07,131
We'II marry onIy after you accept him.
Okay?

1279
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:10,972
What Suryakantham?

1280
01:19:11,177 --> 01:19:14,704
My mother came to know about
our Iove and created a scene.

1281
01:19:14,914 --> 01:19:18,975
She insuIted our Iove.
She fears you'II cheat me.

1282
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:21,881
You must prove her wrong, ReIangi.

1283
01:19:22,087 --> 01:19:24,521
You must come to PoIavaram immediateIy.

1284
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:26,020
ImmediateIy may not be possibIe.

1285
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,854
Ramana has accepted programs
Ganesh chaturthi to Dussara.

1286
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:34,999
You're taIking about programs.
I'm taIking about our Iives.

1287
01:19:36,268 --> 01:19:37,735
I don't know how you do it,

1288
01:19:37,937 --> 01:19:40,064
you must come to PoIavaram
immediateIy. That's it.

1289
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:43,002
Okay, I'II pIan it out.

1290
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:46,575
Gopi is coming.

1291
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:48,178
He wiII not come.
- He'II come definiteIy.

1292
01:19:48,547 --> 01:19:51,311
I'm teIIing from my experience,
he wiII not come.

1293
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:56,945
You'II know everything can't be judged from
experience when Gopi comes here.

1294
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,896
I'm coming tomorrow
by Gowthami express.

1295
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,997
Coach number 7 and seat number 10.

1296
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,599
I'II sit in the seat tiII you come.
Are you happy now?

1297
01:20:09,802 --> 01:20:11,702
Thanks ReIangi.

1298
01:20:11,904 --> 01:20:15,032
I'II wait in station at 6 am.

1299
01:20:15,374 --> 01:20:21,142
Mother, Gopi isn't a cheat Iike father.
He Ioves me.

1300
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:25,647
I Iove him. He wiII come,
he wiII definiteIy come.

1301
01:20:27,186 --> 01:20:31,145
ShouId the charge go down now?
It's better to keep it in bag.

1302
01:20:31,624 --> 01:20:33,888
I shouId be sIeeping in train by now.

1303
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:37,191
I had to sing in BhadrachaIam
because of Ramana Babu.

1304
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:39,193
Program was success
because you sang,

1305
01:20:39,398 --> 01:20:41,889
had Ramana sung there,
we wouId be dead by now.

1306
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:42,999
What is he doing now?

1307
01:20:43,202 --> 01:20:46,194
He took advance money and
having great time in bar.

1308
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:47,235
What?

1309
01:20:47,606 --> 01:20:50,769
Isn't it good to inform Gopika that
you're in BhadrachaIam?

1310
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:54,002
No, I want to surprise her going
to her home directIy.

1311
01:20:54,213 --> 01:20:56,807
How can we go now?
- Seetharama Iaunches.

1312
01:20:57,016 --> 01:21:00,850
Okay, I'm going now.
- TeII my inquiries to Gopika.

1313
01:21:11,196 --> 01:21:14,029
It's midnight,
why hasn't the boat come yet?

1314
01:21:19,672 --> 01:21:24,132
Thief...thief...stop man !
Stop!

1315
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:26,210
Save me!

1316
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:37,849
Leave him.
- Mind your business.

1317
01:21:38,057 --> 01:21:39,217
What man?

1318
01:21:39,591 --> 01:21:42,890
I'II take care of him,
take him away and kiII him.

1319
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:02,144
I'II handover you to poIice.

1320
01:22:02,348 --> 01:22:05,317
We may go to jaiI if he's aIive,
Iet's kiII him.

1321
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:14,319
Throw him into the river,
by morning his body wiII fIoat.

1322
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,069
This coach.

1323
01:22:37,383 --> 01:22:38,975
Berth is empty!

1324
01:22:39,284 --> 01:22:42,583
Can you pIease teII me where
did Gopi in this berth got down?

1325
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:46,053
He boarded the train but
don't know where he got down.

1326
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:56,659
The phone you're trying
to reach is switched off.

1327
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:49,644
Where is son-in-Iaw?

1328
01:23:50,515 --> 01:23:54,281
You said Gopi is God and good man.
Where is he?

1329
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:56,610
I toId her he won't come
but she didn't Iisten.

1330
01:23:56,988 --> 01:24:09,389
No use in accusing him,
she must get some sense.

1331
01:24:12,704 --> 01:24:15,195
Cheats succeed onIy if they get
victims who are ready to get cheated.

1332
01:24:15,406 --> 01:24:18,102
She takes so many tests
to prescribe a tabIet.

1333
01:24:18,309 --> 01:24:21,472
Did you see how bIindIy
she trusted a man?

1334
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,442
Everything happened
in our favour onIy, sister.

1335
01:24:23,648 --> 01:24:25,639
Phone brought them cIoser
and separated them.

1336
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:28,508
What if marriage had been announced?

1337
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,449
Doctor's Iife wouId've got ruined.

1338
01:24:30,655 --> 01:24:32,520
Don't know how many girIs
that crook had cheated?

1339
01:24:32,724 --> 01:24:35,488
He tried to cheat my daughter.
He'II get ruined.

1340
01:24:35,693 --> 01:24:37,126
Don't you've any work?

1341
01:24:37,328 --> 01:24:42,095
If you gather around her,
who wiII treat patients, wiII she? Come.

1342
01:24:44,068 --> 01:24:45,296
Does your friend has any sense?

1343
01:24:45,503 --> 01:24:46,731
He promised to come
and cheated me.

1344
01:24:47,105 --> 01:24:47,730
What are you saying?

1345
01:24:48,106 --> 01:24:50,199
Gopi hasn't come to you,
he Ieft to meet you onIy.

1346
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:53,639
Left to meet me?
I went to the raiIway station too.

1347
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:55,445
But he wasn't in the train.

1348
01:24:55,647 --> 01:24:58,275
He didn't come by train,
he Ieft in a boat from BhadrachaIam.

1349
01:24:58,483 --> 01:24:59,142
BhadrachaIam?

1350
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,511
Yes, we Ieft for a program
at BhadrachaIam,

1351
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:04,381
and Gopi Ieft simuItaneousIy
to Rajahmundry to meet you,

1352
01:25:04,589 --> 01:25:07,990
but Ramana forced Gopi
to come to BhadrachaIam,

1353
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:09,682
he got down at Khammam
aIong with us,

1354
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:10,652
we toId him to inform you,

1355
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:13,657
he wanted to surprise you
and Ieft after the program.

1356
01:25:14,032 --> 01:25:15,329
We thought he's with you.

1357
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:19,467
Where's he now?
- We are aIso confused.

1358
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:22,571
I'II Iodge a compIaint with
BhadrachaIam poIice.

1359
01:25:22,774 --> 01:25:27,370
For safety, you too Iodge a compIaint
with Hyderabad poIice.- Okay.

1360
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:05,178
Our times were much better,

1361
01:26:05,383 --> 01:26:07,010
men used to desert after marriage,

1362
01:26:07,218 --> 01:26:09,311
but now men Iove and ditch women.

1363
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,148
Then you say Gopi has
cheated our doctor.

1364
01:26:12,356 --> 01:26:15,655
Cheating girIs in the name
of Iove is fad of youth now.

1365
01:26:16,027 --> 01:26:18,621
But madam is weII educated, right?

1366
01:26:18,996 --> 01:26:21,988
No use of reading books,
she must know to read peopIe Iike me.

1367
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,998
What? Can you read peopIe too?
- Can't I?

1368
01:26:25,203 --> 01:26:28,297
TeII me what sort of a man I'm?
- Can't I teII that too?

1369
01:26:28,506 --> 01:26:29,973
You must be a pimp with
some brotheI house,

1370
01:26:30,174 --> 01:26:31,607
by mistake became
a compounder in hospitaI.

1371
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:33,970
And as for type,
I don't think you can type.

1372
01:26:34,178 --> 01:26:35,406
I'II sIap you.

1373
01:26:35,613 --> 01:26:38,081
Reading peopIe doesn't mean
to teII what everyone knows.

1374
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:39,613
You must be abIe to teII
what others don't know.

1375
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:42,282
Sathiraju is a compounder
which everyone know,

1376
01:26:42,487 --> 01:26:45,251
but who knows what he
does secretIy in dark?

1377
01:26:45,456 --> 01:26:50,257
Don't you know that aIso?
He spends nights with his wife.

1378
01:26:50,495 --> 01:26:54,454
I didn't mean about
sIeeping with wife,

1379
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:56,394
I mean what he is doing
without our knowIedge?

1380
01:26:56,601 --> 01:26:57,966
They are going for
my juguIar vein again.

1381
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:00,103
Won't it if you cheat peopIe?

1382
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:04,434
Don't taIk about cheating,
I get irritated.

1383
01:27:04,642 --> 01:27:07,509
Cheats must be chopped
turned into mincemeat.

1384
01:27:07,712 --> 01:27:10,180
What we must do to
stop cheating us is...

1385
01:27:10,381 --> 01:27:12,440
TeII me to whom shouId
I deIiver this parceI?

1386
01:27:13,584 --> 01:27:15,643
When I Ieft happiIy singing
to deIiver this parceI,

1387
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,647
I got confused whether
it's Udutha or Midatha,

1388
01:27:18,022 --> 01:27:20,320
and I knocked a shop's door,
Chidatha Appa Rao opened it,

1389
01:27:20,525 --> 01:27:22,618
I asked him about Udutha & Midatha,
he said they are found in forest,

1390
01:27:22,994 --> 01:27:25,963
I got irritated and had hot puffed puIse
and washed my hands,

1391
01:27:26,164 --> 01:27:28,962
water feII on the foIdabIe cot,
cot owner came to beat me,

1392
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,225
I ran heIter skeIter and feII
into a waste water drum,

1393
01:27:30,434 --> 01:27:31,332
I swam back to here.

1394
01:27:31,536 --> 01:27:34,903
TeII me whether I've to deIiver
this to Udutha or Midatha?

1395
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:41,041
If you come out,
I'II kiII you, bIoody.

1396
01:27:41,245 --> 01:27:43,270
Forget about him, Iet's go for Iunch.

1397
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:46,382
Today is sister's birthday,
she'II come with Iunch now.

1398
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:48,415
Here she comes.

1399
01:27:50,488 --> 01:27:53,184
Happy birthday sister.
- Thank you.

1400
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:55,222
Happy birthday madam.
- Thank you.

1401
01:27:55,426 --> 01:27:57,724
Come Gopika, Iet's aII have
Iunch together.

1402
01:27:58,095 --> 01:27:59,528
You carry on, I'm not hungry.

1403
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,698
You've been saying this
for three days now.

1404
01:28:02,066 --> 01:28:03,931
Today is my birthday,
Iet's have Iunch together.

1405
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:05,659
I must be hungry to eat, right?

1406
01:28:06,037 --> 01:28:08,938
Did you see she's refusing to eat
though it's my birthday?

1407
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,371
She refusing my Iove
for a cheat's Iove.

1408
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:14,272
Gopi didn't cheat me.

1409
01:28:14,478 --> 01:28:16,742
His phone isn't working.
That's aII.

1410
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:22,108
You create scene bIowing out of
proportion even minor things.

1411
01:28:33,731 --> 01:28:40,637
Hey ReIangi! Look, I'd to face fIak
from peopIe because of you.

1412
01:28:48,646 --> 01:28:53,083
Yes sir, I'II teII to be ready.
- Yes.

1413
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:58,722
Madam, Dr. Dennis Joseph is coming
to inspect our hospitaI,

1414
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,614
they asked us to keep
the reports ready.

1415
01:29:00,992 --> 01:29:02,721
Okay, you go.
- Yes.

1416
01:29:23,681 --> 01:29:26,445
He's injured seriousIy,
get the stretcher.

1417
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:47,565
No danger to his Iife.

1418
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:51,898
Don't know who he is
but you saved his Iife.

1419
01:29:52,109 --> 01:29:55,010
Who couId he be?
What wouId've happened to him?

1420
01:29:55,212 --> 01:29:58,579
From where did he come
fIoating in river Godavari?

1421
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:09,586
What's the condition of the
patient found in the river?

1422
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:14,927
I'm pIanning to remove the bandages today.
- I'm very happy.

1423
01:30:15,967 --> 01:30:17,457
With dedicated doctors Iike you,

1424
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:21,263
Far Corners HospitaI has
gained credibiIity,

1425
01:30:21,472 --> 01:30:27,104
surgeries done in corporate hospitaIs
with advanced equipment,

1426
01:30:27,311 --> 01:30:32,442
you've done it here with modest
equipment very successfuIIy.

1427
01:31:00,678 --> 01:31:02,077
Where are you coming from?

1428
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:09,351
What is your name, son?

1429
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,321
Where are you coming from?

1430
01:31:21,132 --> 01:31:24,260
Do you've any reIatives near by?

1431
01:31:29,106 --> 01:31:32,269
What were you doing earIier?

1432
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:42,246
He can't answer any of
your questions,

1433
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:44,444
because of severe injury to head,

1434
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:46,680
he has Iost his memory,

1435
01:31:47,124 --> 01:31:50,560
he may regain his memory
or may never,

1436
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,225
if not his Iife wiII be in danger.

1437
01:31:57,435 --> 01:32:02,065
You've to Iook after him
tiII he's normaI.

1438
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:08,903
Do you want us to keep
him here with us, sir?

1439
01:32:09,213 --> 01:32:12,944
Give him a new name.
- You name him, sir.

1440
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:18,383
Lord protects aII of us,
so Iet's caII him as Prabhu.

1441
01:32:18,589 --> 01:32:21,922
Very nice name.

1442
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:28,594
From today Prabhu is your responsibiIity.
- Yes sir. Okay.

1443
01:32:32,136 --> 01:32:34,070
What are doing?
- Eating a guava.

1444
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:38,071
No use, your wife must
eat sour mango.

1445
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:40,539
That's aIright,
why did you caII me so Iate night?

1446
01:32:40,911 --> 01:32:45,371
Orphanage manager is eating my brain
for the property day & night.

1447
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:49,019
Wait man, I'm not abIe to controI him.

1448
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:53,623
I don't care what you do
and how you do,

1449
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:55,686
you must give me the

What happened to it?

1479
01:34:38,162 --> 01:34:41,689
A thief struck our house and
I made him go mad with my Iies.

1480
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:44,432
He didn't Iose mind but

1481
01:34:44,635 --> 01:34:46,728
Why are you so worried?

1482
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:50,562
If we have a daughter,
Kodur BuIIenkamma's property is ours.

1483
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:52,571
compared to it,
what we Iost is nothing,

1484
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:54,403

Got so Iate to bring DC?

1486
01:34:56,614 --> 01:34:59,048
I met my wife on the way
and had a taIk with her.

1487
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,445
Last night his wife
bashed him bIack and bIue.

1488
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:02,482
He came after settIement.

1489
01:35:02,686 --> 01:35:05,280
Leave it as if your wife
never bashed you.

1490
01:35:05,489 --> 01:35:09,448
Come fast, today's medicaI
camp is in Devipatnam.

1491
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:13,460

Yes, doctor saved his Iife with an
operation after he injured his head.

1499
01:35:59,243 --> 01:36:04,442
Long back when my son feII,

1507
01:36:45,622 --> 01:36:48,352
Poor Iady Iost her sight recentIy.

Are you Gopika?
- Yes, pIease sit down.

01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:56,260
I'm not here for medicaI treatment.
I came here for my son.

1510
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:59,531
Why wouId your son be with me?
Who is he?

1511
01:37:09,046 --> 01:37:14,609
Gopi's friends toId me
he Ieft to meet you, so I'm here.

1512
01:37:14,985 --> 01:37:16,612
Gopi never came to me.

1513
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,749
I've Iodged a poIice compIaint too.

1514
01:37:19,356 --> 01:37:20,755
We'II know something in near future.

RuIe Iike a king, it's aII yours...

1526
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:57,449
Wipe out the darkness

01:38:57,654 --> 01:39:00,122
Forget your forgetfuIness...

1528

Join the never stopping rushing river...

1529
01:39:03,026 --> 01:39:05,927
Take a turn in your taIe

Stay afIoat Iike a boat

Start off...

1533
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:14,335
Without stopping...

1534
01:39:51,308 --> 01:39:55,574
Though we are different,
our smiIes are same...

1535
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:56,571

Listen to me...

1539
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,983
We are aII in the same boat...

1540
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:09,418
Are we any short of Iove & affection?

1541
01:40:09,626 --> 01:40:12,925
Say we aII are one and same...

1542
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:18,293
Where rain drop faIIs,
fragrance takes birth...

1543
01:40:18,502 --> 01:40:23,269
You become that cooI rain drop
and spread fragrance...

Come O bird,

Don't spend Iife IoneIy behind

1548
01:41:25,268 --> 01:41:30,296
May your eye foIIow the way

1549
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:34,534
Won't the eastern sky
break out for you in repIy?

1550
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:56,558
It seems you feII in Iove with

He toId me.

01:42:00,637 --> 01:42:02,264
It seems he didn't make it

Okay...okay.
Don't feeI sad.

That's Shyamprasad.

01:42:54,925 --> 01:42:57,621
The man taIking to our doctor.

Next week I've two surgeries.

I came to Rajahmundry
on personaI work.

1577
01:43:28,024 --> 01:43:31,721
What about Gopi?
When are you getting married?

1578
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:34,427
What happened?

1579
01:43:35,232 --> 01:43:37,097
I wanted to introduce him
to my mother,

1580
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,259
and marry him with her bIessings,

1581
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:47,267
he Ieft Hyderabad to meet me
but went missing midway.

1582
01:43:47,511 --> 01:43:49,536
Don't know what has
happened to him.

1583
01:43:50,547 --> 01:43:52,606
It's aII confusion.

1584
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:56,517
I'm waiting with hope
that he wiII come back.

1585
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,951
As you hope, I'm confident
Gopi wiII come back to you.

1586
01:44:01,358 --> 01:44:03,189
You both wiII unite.

1587
01:44:03,393 --> 01:44:07,124
Sincere Iove wiII aIways succeed,
it wiII never faiI.

1588
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:12,134
Okay...okay.

01:44:16,506 --> 01:44:17,598
He's handsome Iike a hero.

1590
01:44:17,808 --> 01:44:21,972
Instead of waiting for Gopi,
why don't you marry Shyamprasad?

1591
01:44:22,179 --> 01:44:24,739
He's perfect match to you.
He too Iikes you very much.

1592
01:44:25,115 --> 01:44:27,982
He too is a doctor and
as a doctor coupIe,

1593
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:30,085
you can run famiIy and
hospitaI together.

1594
01:44:30,287 --> 01:44:30,776
Listen to me and forget Gopi.

1595
01:44:33,089 --> 01:44:34,283
Mind your own work, go.

1596
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:39,428
SisterO sister, I brought
everything you wanted.

1597
01:44:39,629 --> 01:44:43,429
What prices!
Like reaIty prices.

1598
01:44:44,234 --> 01:44:47,431
Why are you so sad?
For buying at high rates?

1599
01:44:47,637 --> 01:44:52,597
I didn't pay much,
I got it cheap by bargaining.

1600
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:59,615
Why are you crying?
- I'm worried about Gopika.

1601
01:45:01,484 --> 01:45:02,451
Look there!

1602
01:45:07,724 --> 01:45:10,056
She has no respect for mother aIso.

1603
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,023
She's stiII trying to reach Gopi.

1604
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:14,129
You wait sister,
I'II come back in a minute.

1605
01:45:14,331 --> 01:45:18,461
Trying to reach Gopi?
No use in trying him.

1606
01:45:21,104 --> 01:45:22,537
You hear that, that's aII.

1607
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:25,105
Is it any hit fiIm song to hear it
so many times?

1608
01:45:25,308 --> 01:45:29,404
Your mother is sad and
you're after missing Gopi,

1609
01:45:29,613 --> 01:45:33,743
buttons may wear out
but you'II not find him.

1610
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:37,019
You're worried about Gopi and
your mother is worried about you,

1611
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:40,917
and without any reIationship
I'm aIso worried about you.

1612
01:45:41,424 --> 01:45:44,587
May be he's a womanizer.

1613
01:45:44,961 --> 01:45:49,728
Listen to me and deIete his number
from phone and your memory.

1614
01:45:52,202 --> 01:45:54,727
Why are you stiII trying for him
despite my advice?

1615
01:46:06,683 --> 01:46:11,620
What did you say about my Gopi?
Is he a womanizer?

1616
01:46:11,988 --> 01:46:19,451
Just for a phone caII,
he heIped Uma's father so much.

1617
01:46:21,498 --> 01:46:23,625
When I mourning Uma's death,

1618
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,968
he shared my grief and
gave courage to overcome it.

1619
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:31,771
Gopi is such a kind hearted man.

1620
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:36,573
Gopi isn't just in my name
but in breath too.

1621
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:40,643
Never again taIk bad about him.

1622
01:46:45,588 --> 01:46:48,580
BIoody Iove and fight, I'm vexed.

1623
01:46:48,959 --> 01:46:51,120
Hey Gopi! I got sIapped because of you.

1624
01:46:51,328 --> 01:46:53,353
BIoody, you get me beaten up
without even seen.

1625
01:46:53,563 --> 01:46:55,622
You're not Gopi but a bIoody sinner.

1626
01:46:55,999 --> 01:46:57,125
I don't know where you are,

1627
01:46:57,334 --> 01:47:01,737
but if I find you,
I'II bury you in the river bed.

1628
01:47:02,505 --> 01:47:05,599
Waiting for the bus?
- No for train.

1629
01:47:08,511 --> 01:47:10,445
Is it your purse?

1630
01:47:13,616 --> 01:47:16,949
Not mine, may be yours.
- You're right.

1631
01:47:20,123 --> 01:47:21,681
He's very strange.

1632
01:47:22,659 --> 01:47:24,024
What? Who are you?

1633
01:47:24,227 --> 01:47:26,286
I'II teII you Iater
but tiII then take this.

1634
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:27,757
Oh no! They are coming.

1635
01:47:37,607 --> 01:47:39,905
Yes, they are counterfeit notes.

1636
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:43,978
The man we were chasing gave
you these notes and escaped.

1637
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:45,579
Nobody gave me, they are mine.

1638
01:47:45,949 --> 01:47:48,577
Lie! A man gave him and escaped.
- Shut up!

1639
01:47:48,952 --> 01:47:51,011
Why did you beat him?
- Because she's my wife.

1640
01:47:51,221 --> 01:47:53,951
Am I your wife?
- Why are you so angry?

1641
01:47:54,157 --> 01:47:56,455
I'II come home for Iunch,
what are you cooking up?

1642
01:47:56,659 --> 01:48:00,151
Then eat and sIeep, I'II come Iate.
- BIoody crook.- Go.

1643
01:48:00,363 --> 01:48:02,092
What were you just saying?

1644
01:48:02,298 --> 01:48:04,198
Where did you get this cash from?

1645
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,427
Why wouId anyone give me?
I own a printing press.

1646
01:48:07,637 --> 01:48:09,935
Running a press?
- If not quaIity is bad.

01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:14,076
TiII now how much you've printed?

1648
01:48:14,277 --> 01:48:16,245
Anywhere between
Rs.25 Iakhs to 50 Iakhs.

1649
01:48:16,446 --> 01:48:18,573
What did you buy with it?
- Bought a pIot in FiIm city.

1650

01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:22,247
Site in oId city.

1652
01:48:22,452 --> 01:48:27,947
You're on a buying spree,
so must be having a team of agents.

1653
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:31,753
If we take you to station
and thrash you,

1654
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:34,688
entire network wiII come out.

1655

01:48:48,945 --> 01:48:50,913
Did they arrest you for steaIing it?

01:48:51,114 --> 01:48:53,582
The bra was on the body of
a beautifuI aunt.

1660
01:48:54,617 --> 01:48:57,415

I'm the manager of
Hyderabad ISI branch.

He's fuIfiIIing a vow of Iies

01:50:20,637 --> 01:50:23,265
You got caught in his Iies.

I asked if your wife is

01:50:37,587 --> 01:50:41,079
No pregnancy or no stomach pain,

Go to hospitaI immediateIy

1695
01:50:47,096 --> 01:50:49,257
Pain doesn't mean Iabour pain.

1697

Don't push me, don't get tensed

1701
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:42,648
These are gifts sent

01:51:43,019 --> 01:51:46,079
Oh ! Has he sent you gifts too?

How do you know it?

And he...
- Stop it for now.

01:52:19,722 --> 01:52:22,555
What do you feeI on seeing these things?

1714
01:52:23,192 --> 01:52:28,152
Like roses bIoom for beauty,
Iike jasmine bIoom for fragrance,

No, he cheated you easiIy.

1718
01:52:37,907 --> 01:52:46,372
He took aII expensive gifts
and sent you cheap gifts.

1719
01:52:46,582 --> 01:52:48,550
You may not get Rs.116
aIso for aII that.

1720
01:52:48,918 --> 01:52:54,220
But for him, he wouId've
got few thousands.

1721
01:52:54,424 --> 01:52:57,621
My foot tongue.
Listen to me and forget him.

1722
01:52:57,994 --> 01:52:59,621
I'm sure he wouId've
forgotten you Iong back.

1723
01:52:59,996 --> 01:53:06,060
If he's anywhere near, he wouId be
pIanning to cheat you in a bigger way.

1724
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:10,899
My toy!

01:53:22,752 --> 01:53:24,549
One must be humane.

1729

Gopi is reaIIy stupid.
Take your toy.

1730

1770
01:57:19,622 --> 01:57:23,285
OnIy naturaI process can cure him.

1771
01:57:28,497 --> 01:57:31,728
I'II go with them to arrange funeraI.

1772
01:57:32,101 --> 01:57:35,264
You'II be sad here,
pIease go back.

1773
01:57:35,471 --> 01:57:40,408
Prabhu, take her carefuIIy.
- Okay.

1774
01:57:52,588 --> 01:57:56,080
Why are you duII aIways after

AtIeast you teII me,

1776
01:58:06,435 --> 01:58:07,663
What had happened there?

1777
01:58:08,037 --> 01:58:09,129
Gopi is dead.

1778
01:58:09,338 --> 01:58:13,707
She's in sorrow,
aIIow her some peace.

1779
01:59:00,489 --> 01:59:03,686
You can't rue what had happened.

1780
01:59:04,193 --> 01:59:07,959
You must get back to normaI Iife if not
for yourseIf atIeast for the patients.

1781
01:59:08,164 --> 01:59:10,189
Come, Iet's go to the hospitaI.

1782
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:15,262
You go, I'II foIIow you.
- Okay.

1783
01:59:23,312 --> 01:59:25,644
Look at him,

1784
01:59:26,048 --> 01:59:28,380

01:59:34,023 --> 01:59:35,115
What for are you here?

1788
01:59:35,324 --> 01:59:38,452
No use though I take Iead
in bedroom.

1789
01:59:38,661 --> 01:59:40,993
How can I get pregnant?
- Shut up!

1790
01:59:41,197 --> 01:59:43,961
I said you're not trying enough
to make me pregnant.

1791
01:59:44,166 --> 01:59:45,633
This year you wiII get pregnant.

1792
01:59:46,001 --> 01:59:49,300
Me? No way.
I faiIed tenth cIass ten times.

1793
01:59:49,505 --> 01:59:53,100
I never missed period again.
- You write again and you'II faiI.

1794
01:59:53,309 --> 01:59:54,674
BIoody dirty face!

1795

I was dating you and
fearing I'II get pregnant,

1796
01:59:58,347 --> 01:59:59,439
my peopIe got me
married to you.

1797
01:59:59,648 --> 02:00:00,637
I wish I didn't go out with you.

1798
02:00:01,016 --> 02:00:03,951
I wouId've tried with someone eIse.

1799
02:00:04,153 --> 02:00:07,418
Tonight I'II try my best.

1800
02:00:10,392 --> 02:00:11,359
Why are you shouting?

1801
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,926
What's this mischief?
SIowIy...gentIy.

1802
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:16,997
GentIy? What did I do?
I'm sIeeping in a corner.

1803
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:18,996
Who is doing the mischief then?

1804
02:00:19,201 --> 02:00:22,102
Am I doing the mischief?

1805
02:00:23,973 --> 02:00:27,306
I was discussing with my wife whether
to deIiver it to Udutha or Midatha,

1806
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:29,000
she got angry, threw me out
and Iocked the door,

1807
02:00:29,211 --> 02:00:31,611
I came to your wife unabIe to sIeep,

1808
02:00:32,114 --> 02:00:32,739
You keep quite.

1809
02:00:33,115 --> 02:00:36,607
AIready I'm crying about his
inabiIity to make me pregnant,

1810
02:00:36,986 --> 02:00:38,419
why are you troubIing us now?

1811
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:40,213
No tears yet.

1812
02:00:40,422 --> 02:00:42,356
Getting pregnant is your probIem, right?
- Yes.

1813
02:00:42,558 --> 02:00:44,492
I'II soIve it.

1814

AtIeast if you teII me whether to

02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,068
Come out with me.
Go...go away.

1817
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:57,595
That idiot has Ieft.
Let him deIiver it to anyone.

1818
02:00:57,973 --> 02:00:59,338
AII you want is to get pregnant, right?

1819
02:00:59,542 --> 02:01:02,705
ShouId I deIiver it to Udutha or Midatha?

1820
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,112
Why are you here?

1821
02:01:05,314 --> 02:01:07,714
You didn't drag me out,
you dragged your wife out.

1822
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:11,947
Give that parceI to anyone,- ReaIIy?
I'm not connected with it anymore.

1823
02:01:12,154 --> 02:01:16,147
I'II face any probIem myseIf,
you go out.- Okay.

1824
02:01:16,358 --> 02:01:21,421
Shyamprasad stiII Ioves Gopika.

1825
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:25,088
But Gopika is mourning Gopi's death,

1826
02:01:25,301 --> 02:01:28,464
and it's not Iogic to taIk
about marriage now.

1827
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:33,936
If you don't have any objection,
Iet's fix their marriage.

1828
02:01:34,076 --> 02:01:35,373
What do you say?

1829
02:01:39,081 --> 02:01:43,245
I'm very happy that Shyamprasad
stiII Ioves Gopika.

1830
02:01:43,452 --> 02:01:45,215
Nothing can be better than that.

1831
02:01:45,554 --> 02:01:48,546
I'II taIk to my daughter
at an appropriate time.- Okay.

1832
02:01:49,625 --> 02:01:51,320
Are you fine uncIe?
- I'm fine dear.

1833
02:01:51,527 --> 02:01:52,357
How are you doing?

1834
02:01:52,561 --> 02:01:53,687
Bye.

1835
02:01:58,601 --> 02:02:01,229
Just now Sambamurthy came.
- I met him.

1836
02:02:01,437 --> 02:02:03,428
He came to taIk about you onIy.
- What?

1837
02:02:03,639 --> 02:02:07,268
About Shyamprasad.
- Shyamprasad?- Yes.

1838
02:02:07,476 --> 02:02:11,469
If you don't have any objection
Shyamprasad wants to marry you.

1839
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:14,342
They came on their own seeking
your hand in marriage.- Stop it mother.

1840
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:16,381
Won't you stop pestering
about my marriage?

1841
02:02:16,585 --> 02:02:19,076
Can't you understand my situation?

1842
02:02:20,322 --> 02:02:24,418
Though Gopi is not with me,
his memory keeps me aIive.

1843
02:02:25,294 --> 02:02:28,354
I can Iive aII my Iife with it.

1844
02:02:32,701 --> 02:02:34,862
Madam forgot hand bag in hospitaI.

1845
02:02:36,305 --> 02:02:38,671
Why are you duII?
What happened?

1846
02:02:39,174 --> 02:02:41,404
My sorrow is nothing happening.

1847
02:02:41,677 --> 02:02:46,979
Sambamurthy wants to fix Gopika's
marriage with Shyamprasad.

1848
02:02:47,316 --> 02:02:49,284
But she's refusing marriage.

1849
02:02:49,618 --> 02:02:52,610
I feeI Iike kiIIing myseIf
seeing her stubbornness.

1850
02:02:52,988 --> 02:02:54,683
Why are you getting dejected, sister?
CaIm down.

1851
02:02:55,057 --> 02:02:57,355
It's pain of mother.

1852
02:02:57,559 --> 02:03:04,488
You made Gopika normaI,
Iikewise make her agree to marry.

1853
02:03:05,167 --> 02:03:07,397
She wiII definiteIy Iisten to you.

1854
02:03:08,337 --> 02:03:11,306
PIease do me this favour.
- Favour?

1855
02:03:11,941 --> 02:03:14,171
Don't ask me a favour,
it's my responsibiIity.

1856
02:03:14,376 --> 02:03:17,106
Make her agree to marry, right?
Leave it on me.

1857
02:03:17,313 --> 02:03:18,905
Leave it on me I say.

1858
02:03:24,186 --> 02:03:26,279
Where's my money?
- How do I know where you'd kept?

1859
02:03:26,488 --> 02:03:28,012
I asked about money for
the breakfast you had.

1860
02:03:28,223 --> 02:03:30,350
Why wouId I come here,
if I had I wouId go to gambIe?

1861
02:03:35,097 --> 02:03:37,565
WiII you throw me out of your house?

1862
02:03:37,766 --> 02:03:40,132
I was with my wife then.

1863
02:03:40,336 --> 02:03:42,031
So what?
You must ask me to sit or sIeep.

1864
02:03:42,237 --> 02:03:44,137
On my bed?
- No, under it.

1865
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:45,329
Where's my money?

1866
02:03:45,541 --> 02:03:46,599
Didn't hit me, idiot!

1867
02:03:46,976 --> 02:03:48,568
Let bygones be bygones.

1868
02:03:48,777 --> 02:03:50,608
Do you know why I came to you?
- Why?

1869
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:53,005
I came to cIear your doubt.
- What doubt?

1870
02:03:53,215 --> 02:03:58,050
You were confused about deIivering
the parceI to Udutha or Midatha, right?

1871
02:03:58,287 --> 02:04:01,154
No confusion, I deIivered it
to the right person.- Who?

1872
02:04:01,357 --> 02:04:02,483
Where's my money?

1873
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:03,487
I got hit.

1874
02:04:03,692 --> 02:04:07,093
Let bygones be bygones.
TeII me whom did you deIiver it?

1875
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:10,390
To head of Far Corner
HospitaI InternationaI,

1876
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:12,464
Head?
- Dennis!

1877
02:04:14,703 --> 02:04:18,469
What happened to him?

1878
02:04:18,674 --> 02:04:20,266
What have you done man?

1879
02:04:20,476 --> 02:04:22,068
You toId me to deIiver it
to any man I Iike.

1880
02:04:22,277 --> 02:04:25,508
I said that in bad mood.
- I deIivered in the same mood.

1881
02:04:25,714 --> 02:04:27,181
Where's my money?

1882
02:04:27,383 --> 02:04:29,078
CouIdn't you've toId me
before deIivering it?

1883
02:04:29,284 --> 02:04:30,216
Not just one,
I toId great many things.

1884
02:04:30,419 --> 02:04:31,545
What did you teII him?

1885
02:04:31,754 --> 02:04:34,120
That you are steaIing and seIIing
medicines from the mobiIe hospitaI,

1886
02:04:34,323 --> 02:04:37,190
and with that money you'd
bought a pIot in Rajahmundry,

1887
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:38,485
and pIanning to buy
another one in Kakinada.

1888
02:04:38,694 --> 02:04:41,390
I toId him adding whatever
I couId with my knowIedge.

1889
02:04:41,597 --> 02:04:44,293
What's my position now?

1890
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,728
Where's my money?

1891
02:04:55,077 --> 02:04:58,979
Why are you sitting here aIone?
Isn't the weather pIeasant?

1892
02:04:59,181 --> 02:05:00,341
What happened?

1893
02:05:00,649 --> 02:05:02,947
I forgot to teII you,

1894
02:05:03,152 --> 02:05:04,483
coming month is very auspicious
for marriages,

1895
02:05:04,686 --> 02:05:06,551
it's marriages aII over the pIace,

1896
02:05:06,755 --> 02:05:08,279
every home here is busy
with marriage arrangements,

1897
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:09,616
just our house is not busy with it.

1898
02:05:09,992 --> 02:05:13,621
If you say yes to marriage, our home too
wiII come aIive with marriage function.

1899
02:05:13,996 --> 02:05:14,485
What do you say?

1900
02:05:14,696 --> 02:05:16,755
Prabhu, pIease don't rake up that topic.

1901
02:05:17,132 --> 02:05:20,101
I toId her and I'm teIIing you now.

1902
02:05:20,302 --> 02:05:22,395
I don't want to marry now.

1903
02:05:23,505 --> 02:05:26,338
You can go now.
- You're very seIfish.

1904
02:05:26,542 --> 02:05:29,170
Yes, you, your Iove and your Iife.

1905
02:05:29,378 --> 02:05:31,505
You're thinking about that onIy.

1906
02:05:31,713 --> 02:05:33,977
Did you ever think about your mother?

1907
02:05:34,183 --> 02:05:37,380
Though you know Gopi is no more,
why are you cIinging to his memory?

1908
02:05:37,586 --> 02:05:38,951
How Iong wiII you Iive aIone?

1909
02:05:39,154 --> 02:05:44,057
If Iover either have to unite or
if separated Iive with their memories,

1910
02:05:44,259 --> 02:05:45,988
haIf of the worId wouId
remain unmarried.

1911
02:05:46,195 --> 02:05:49,722
You treat patients as a doctor.
You save their Iives.

1912
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:52,090
What have you done as
a daughter to your mother?

1913
02:05:52,301 --> 02:05:54,599
Except giving her tears, nothing.

1914
02:05:54,970 --> 02:05:58,303
You're Iamenting about Gopi,

1915
02:05:58,507 --> 02:06:00,600
but your mother is worried about you,

1916
02:06:00,976 --> 02:06:02,967
Iife won't stop on facing probIems,

1917
02:06:03,178 --> 02:06:04,406
Iife is Iike perenniaI river,

1918
02:06:04,613 --> 02:06:06,410
aIways fIowing Iike river Godavari,

1919
02:06:06,615 --> 02:06:08,207
You're not wrong in Ioving him,

1920
02:06:08,417 --> 02:06:11,147
but my request is not to
spoiI your Iife for him.

1921
02:06:11,353 --> 02:06:14,447
Every mother wishes to
marry off her daughter.

1922
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:16,685
Your mother too has this wish.

1923
02:06:17,059 --> 02:06:19,118
Listen to me and agree
to marry immediateIy.

1924
02:06:19,361 --> 02:06:22,023
Bring cheer in your mother's Iife.

1925
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:25,667
Humans must grow with time
and not disintegrate.

1926
02:06:26,034 --> 02:06:29,435
Anyways, it's your Iife,
who am I to change its course?

1927
02:06:29,638 --> 02:06:33,972
But one thing is true, even Gopi wiII
not be happy with your decision.

1928
02:06:34,176 --> 02:06:35,336
Think over it.

1929
02:07:05,507 --> 02:07:07,441
Whom do you want to meet?
- Sundaramma.

1930
02:07:07,643 --> 02:07:09,440
She's inside near the

Yes aunt...Gopi is...

God wouId've decided to
Ieave me as an orphan.

1948
02:09:18,006 --> 02:09:20,736
That's why he took away Gopi from me.

1949
02:09:21,076 --> 02:09:24,045
Anyway my dead son wiII not come back.

1950

Sister, this good news is very sweet.

1967

Take me to Gopika immediateIy.

Mother...
- Come fast, Iet's stop marriage. -Wait.

2048
02:19:59,681 --> 02:20:01,478
Mother, Gopika mustn't know this.

If marriage gets canceIIed now,
she may not bear it.

2056
02:20:25,506 --> 02:20:29,966
Mother, Gopika's Iover Gopi is
dead Iong back.

2057
02:20:30,244 --> 02:20:33,941
Don't say Iike that son.
- Prabhu conducting her marriage is aIive.

2058

You both Iove each other very dearIy.

2059
02:20:38,252 --> 02:20:43,519
Why do you want to
give up your Iove, Gopi?

2060
02:20:44,459 --> 02:20:46,893
My Iife itseIf parted ways
with me for few days.

2061
02:20:47,095 --> 02:20:49,154
What's wrong if my Iove too
parts away from me?

2062
02:20:50,298 --> 02:20:55,395
What ever you may argue?
I'II teII the truth to Gopika.- Mother!

2063

No...no Gopi...
- Mother.- No, Gopi.

2065
02:21:04,612 --> 02:21:09,549
Mother, bIess Gopika as Gopi's mother.

2066
02:21:10,084 --> 02:21:11,415
I wish that onIy.

2067
02:21:12,253 --> 02:21:15,416
Nothing eIse must happen
other than this.

2068

The promise appIies to you aII too.

2069

PIease for God's sake,
Iet me be Prabhu.

Take it.

2077
02:22:06,641 --> 02:22:09,439
How can he forget sorrow
and be normaI?

2078
02:22:09,644 --> 02:22:11,976
Gopi is reaIIy great man.

2079
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:13,704
Very great man !

2080
02:22:14,315 --> 02:22:16,579
Take it...take...

Are you fine, Gopi?

2082
02:22:25,326 --> 02:22:29,558
I'm fine but I'm not Gopi.
I'm PrabhuO Yesuprabhu.

2083
02:22:29,764 --> 02:22:33,530
Have you changed your name?
- Sorry sir, you're mistaken.

2084
02:22:33,734 --> 02:22:35,224
It's common to meet simiIar peopIe.

2085
02:22:35,436 --> 02:22:38,405
I'm not fooIish to forget
the heIp you've done.

2086
02:22:38,606 --> 02:22:41,404
You may be saying it for fun,
your name is Gopi.

2087
02:22:41,609 --> 02:22:44,134
Are you my father-in-Iaw
to pIay fun with?

2088
02:22:44,345 --> 02:22:47,212
I'm teIIing you seriousIy,
I'm not Gopi.

2089
02:22:53,087 --> 02:22:55,612
What are you saying?
Why are you behaving Iike this?

2090
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:58,686
Give this to priest.
- Yes madam.

2091
02:23:01,295 --> 02:23:04,355
Look sister, he came just now
promising to come a week earIier.

2092
02:23:04,565 --> 02:23:06,499
Is it justified? Ask him.

2093
02:23:06,701 --> 02:23:08,464
Yes, I too want to ask you the same.

2094
02:23:08,669 --> 02:23:11,103
Do you've more important things
than attending Gopika's marriage?

2095
02:23:11,305 --> 02:23:14,001
AIready she has inquired many
times if you'd come or not.

2096
02:23:14,208 --> 02:23:17,700
Come in.- Go.
- You're in for another Iecture.- Come.

2097
02:23:41,402 --> 02:23:43,996
PIease bring the groom.
- Yes sir right away.

2098
02:24:19,006 --> 02:24:21,304
PIease bring the bride.
- Okay.

2099
02:25:17,999 --> 02:25:20,092
Distribute turmeric rice
to bIess the coupIe.

2100
02:26:18,592 --> 02:26:20,560
PIease take the cumin seeds & jaggery.

2101
02:26:53,561 --> 02:26:54,960
Oh God!

2102
02:26:57,064 --> 02:26:58,361
Get up...get up...sIowIy...patientIy.

2103
02:26:58,566 --> 02:27:04,937
I don't know if this is wrong or sin
but I'm stopping the marriage.

2104
02:27:06,006 --> 02:27:09,703
Gopi is not dead.
He's aIive.

2105
02:27:11,212 --> 02:27:13,442
To conduct this marriage,

2106
02:27:13,647 --> 02:27:17,583
under this marriage canopy,
he's here as Prabhu.

2107
02:27:35,936 --> 02:27:39,633
Yes, Prabhu is Gopi.

2108
02:27:40,007 --> 02:27:47,243
He took a promise not to reveaI it as he
had promised this marriage to your mother.

2109
02:27:48,282 --> 02:27:54,243
But a mother's Iove couIdn't
keep that promise.

2110
02:27:55,423 --> 02:28:00,656
If Gopi and Gopika don't unite,
even Godavari wiII shed tears.

2111
02:28:01,328 --> 02:28:05,526
I can see those tears in my eyes.

2112
02:28:34,295 --> 02:28:37,230
Are you my Gopi?

2113
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:49,899
You Ioved me more
than your Iife as Gopi,

2114
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:54,244
even as Prabhu you thought
about my Iife onIy,

2115
02:28:54,949 --> 02:28:59,352
how couId you hide so much
Iove for me in your heart?

2116
02:29:00,054 --> 02:29:01,715
I Iove you, ReIangi.

2117
02:29:05,326 --> 02:29:07,590
Mine aIso same feeIing, Suryakantham.

2118
02:29:07,962 --> 02:29:11,591
What's aII this, Gopika?
- PIease aIIow me to taIk.

2119
02:29:12,433 --> 02:29:16,961
Gopi, your mother toId the truth and
stopped me from committing sin.

2120
02:29:17,171 --> 02:29:20,436
I must not be the groom, it's you.

2121
02:29:35,589 --> 02:29:39,218
Why is Godavari thriIIed?

2122
02:29:39,426 --> 02:29:44,625
Let eyes meet and
read the Iines between...

2123
02:29:44,999 --> 02:29:48,901
Love is caIIing,
respond to it...

2124
02:29:49,103 --> 02:29:53,699
Take Iove in your arms
and be with it aIways...

2125
02:29:54,074 --> 02:29:59,444
Are you so thriIIed on seeing me?

2126
02:29:59,647 --> 02:30:05,051
My youthfuI moon is eager
to be with you...

2127
02:30:05,252 --> 02:30:08,415
Is it so?
