1
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,917
I am a citizen, I want to say something

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,916
How did you get in? Where are the guards?

3
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,958
The guards are all here.

4
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,792
At this time of the night?

5
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,000
Needed your complete attention

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,958
Are you insane?

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,958
Do you realize the consequence of barging into my house like this?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,958
And do you realize the consequence of not doing your work properly?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What consequences?

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,958
I will remove you and give this work to someone else

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,458
Obviously, when an employee does not work properly, the owner
replaces him

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Hahahahahaha

13
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:19,667
Mr. Owner, as you are beaten in a lockup tomorrow

14
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:26,000
you will be able to understand my power

15
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,375
you will also appreciate the true ownership of the country

16
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,333
The power you enjoy is granted by the people not for personal ego
trips

17
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:41,917
but for the benefit the country and the people

18
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,500
This country

19
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,000
has everything even without you

20
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,333
You have nothing without the country

21
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,042
Here is a list..

22
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:03,084
of cases that you have delayed for years for your petty personal
benefits..

23
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:07,416
You have 15 days to decide these cases

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,750
Decide as you may, but decide you must

25
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:19,375
and from now on decide everything on time and on merit

26
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,292
Are you threatening me?

27
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:30,833
The owners never threaten an employee, they serve a notice

28
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,833
I, Muhammad Mohsin

29
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,667
(People repeating)

30
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,541
The Citizen of Pakistan

31
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,583
am the owner of Pakistan

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,458
This land

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,792
and the people

34
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
are mine

35
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,375
The government of this country

36
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,959
is appointed by me

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,708
and is answerable to me

38
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,458
I take a vow

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,833
to stand against

40
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,708
any individual

41
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,625
or organization

42
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,125
both foreign and domestic

43
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:14,334
that operates against my country

44
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,208
or violates the law of my land

45
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,167
and that I will

46
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,375
without considerations of association

47
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:26,584
language or religion

48
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:31,583
exercise my utmost strength to defeat them

49
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,375
For I

50
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,875
the citizen of Pakistan

51
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,625
Its real Owner

52
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,209
am the ultimate guarantee of its existence

53
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,000
Please bring me the file for Zahid enterprises

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,333
Ok, where is Hamza?

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,666
Its Ok, I will talk to him

56
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,291
Where are you Hamza?

57
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,208
Dad, I am coming from the yard, just crossed the tower

58
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,583
You have the Zahid enterprises file, right?

59
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,542
Yes dad, I am going to the gym before coming to the office

60
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,083
Okay son but be on time. I have to meet the lawyers

61
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,208
You arrogant rich man's son

62
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,083
What is it?

63
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,708
Donâ€™t know dad! this guy just fell of his bike and is accusing me

64
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,458
Hey step out

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,333
Hey man

66
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,083
Step out

67
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,917
Hamza what's happening? Where are you?

68
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,041
Dad, he fell down by himself and is now hitting my car

69
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:51,791
Hamza

70
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,833
Whatâ€™s wrong with you?

71
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,417
Sir wait, let me deal with him

72
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,250
what's his problem?

73
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,125
Sending out your dad eh?

74
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:58,709
What's the problem with you?

75
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,958
What the hell is wrong with you?

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,958
Move it from here

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,083
Hamza..What exactly is happening?

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,083
Oh shit

79
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,125
Tanu grab the gun

80
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,209
Run....

81
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,083
Hamza..Hamza..

82
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,458
Helloo!!

83
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Hamzaaaa...

84
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,041
Hello

85
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,750
What are you looking at? Get lost

86
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:30,709
Mostly Altaf the snatchers take the victim along and force them to
draw money from the ATMs

87
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,708
they then set the victim free, at times they even take the car and
snatch the cell phones

88
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,375
Most probably Hamza will call you in a while

89
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,417
Hello..

90
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,584
Whats wrong Altaf?

91
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,583
Hamza has been kidnapped

92
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,833
I have said it over and over again

93
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,750
That I don't want to live in this country

94
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,834
This is a jungle, it is nothing but a lawless jungle

95
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,750
But you have no time or interest in anything except your business

96
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:17,667
Money, Money, Money is all that you are concerned with. Can you buy
me my son?

97
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,417
I can't imagine what Hamza must be going through right now

98
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,875
I hope he is okay?

99
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,500
Fatima please calm down a little

100
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:30,584
Calm down? It is so easy for u to say that. CALM DOWN?

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,458
He is a part of my blood and flesh. Do you understand that?

102
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,208
I canâ€™t breathe

103
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,000
Fatima, please have some patience

104
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,125
Patience

105
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:44,000
No! I donâ€™t want to be patient... I am not going to be patient...

106
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:49,084
and you, you went to the police? And what is the police going to do?

107
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,792
Answer me! What can the police do?

108
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,416
We will just pay them, whatever they want, and get our son back

109
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:01,208
and after that, I am not staying here anymore. Do you hear me?

110
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:08,500
Me and my son won't stay in this country anymore

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,750
I would like to meet Maalik please

112
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,875
He is right behind you

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,750
I am sorry, I donâ€™t understand

114
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,125
That's ok . . took me ages to understand it myself

115
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,334
How can we help you?

116
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:53,041
My son has been kidnapped. He is my only child

117
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,958
I have never bothered anyone

118
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,541
If something happens to him

119
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,417
His mother won't make it....

120
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,750
Please! Help me get my son back

121
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,458
We will get your son back, but

122
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,291
there is a question that you must answer first

123
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,125
Sure?

124
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,500
Why would Shamshair Singh risk his life

125
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,250
for Hamzaâ€™s life?

126
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,583
I am prepared to do anything

127
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,833
I will pay whatever you ask

128
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,959
Sheikh Sahib...

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,375
If money

130
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,250
could bring our loved ones back

131
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,459
I would have done it too

132
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,542
Then what is it that you want?

133
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,292
Eye for an eye Sheikh sahab

134
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,333
Commitment, ownership

135
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,958
your word

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,208
that when another Pakistani needs you

137
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:56,667
you will be prepared to do whatever it takes

138
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,708
If and when that moment arrives, I will hold nothing back

139
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,708
Clear... Clear

140
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,500
Please tell your DIG friend, we want all the forensic evidence

141
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,875
and if you have spare keys of the car, please get them

142
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,459
Yes, sure

143
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,208
Naeem...

144
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,250
Shorty ... yes sir

145
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,209
I need three teams

146
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,834
One will extract the car

147
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,458
The Second will provide cover on ground

148
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,833
Right

149
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,833
and the third will spot any tail from air

150
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,583
Okay sir

151
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,083
Right sir

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,583
Ssss.. when the pictures so sweet, I can imagine her in real?

153
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,625
tell me.... You mustâ€™ve tasted her eh?

154
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,250
Hey, what are you staring at?

155
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,250
I will pick her up too

156
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,000
Tie his hands

157
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,500
Yes boss! The package is ready

158
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,667
It's big game, I will cost you 5 million.

159
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,667
You are Sheikh Altafâ€™s son?

160
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,167
Yes

161
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,375
Bring him along

162
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,375
Hello

163
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,167
I am sending you some fingerprints and CNICs

164
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,042
Please exclude the CNICs

165
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,375
and identify the rest of the prints

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,292
Okay how about this one?

167
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,625
Heâ€™s our Gardener

168
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,458
And this?

169
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,542
Sir this is the guy

170
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,000
Sure?

171
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,250
Yes sir, he was hitting the bonnet

172
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,583
Who is he?

173
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:51,917
Letâ€™s find out

174
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,666
I am sending a cell number, please give me current location and Call
Detail Records

175
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,625
Peter!! get the team ready

176
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,209
I am sending you coordinates and a picture

177
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,125
Come on quick

178
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,500
What is wrong with him?

179
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,208
I think heâ€™s having fits, must rush him to the hospital

180
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,417
Yes! Pick him up, let's take him

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,250
Hurry

182
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,750
Itâ€™s a positive match

183
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:59,917
You kidnapped Hamza sheikh yesterday and abandoned his Vehicle in
Malir. I want him back.

184
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,458
What the hell is this? My uncle is inspector of police

185
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,459
You donâ€™t know me.. I am a party worker

186
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
When we are done with you no one will recognize your body

187
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,708

191
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,167
OK OK ...

192
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,708
We sold him on to a man named Rasheed

193
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,542

194
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,958
Shorty . . calls were made to this number, bring him in

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,042
Leave him tied to the chair all night

196
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,458
No food... no water

197
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,125
tomorrow we take him to the village

198
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,250

199
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,667

200
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,250
Okay

201
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,625
This is Mr. Rasheed's house?

202
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,125
Yes it is

203
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,125
Actually, I am invited tonight.

204
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,667
Is this address correct?

205
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,791
Wait here and someone will come?

206
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,209
Excuse me, madam, where are you going?

207
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,833
Mr. Rasheed is upstairs?

208
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,792
Yes, he is. I will take you there

209
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,833
Come in

210
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:14,375
It's okay relax.. just relax.. Alright?
Keep this, he won't be needing it ..

211
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,125
Look! There is definitely a mistake. You can call my dad, he is a
senator

212
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,750
I am a man of substance

213
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:33,250
In the next 30 min, your substances will be swell

214
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,125
an hour later they'd by totally numb

215
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:40,000
even if your dad is the prime minister

216
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,667
there would be no option but to amputate your substances

217
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,583
You will get up, when I get Hamza

218
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,375
till then have a chill time on the ice. Excuse me Iâ€™ll be back.

219
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,292
Just a minute

220
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:53,750

221
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,792

224
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,500
Bullshit!!

225
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,417
You are wasting your time with a cheap gangster.

226
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,458
How much are they asking to get Hamza back?

227
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,208
Hey, they donâ€™t want money

228
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,125
Its not about money. These are nice people

229
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,959
What nonsense?

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,917
Nobody does anything without money

231
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,708
Chilling eh?

232
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,792
There is a flat near Saba Avenue

233
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,416
Hamza is on the 3rd floor

234
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,542
How many men?

235
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,500

236
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,417

237
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,250
Yes

238
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:27,959
Vehicles?

239
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,875
No

240
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,375
Okay

241
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,125
I will give you the phone

242
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,709
Tell them that you are sending a vehicle over; they should put Hamza
in the vehicle.

243
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,791
There's a vehicle waiting outside. Send the boy right now

244
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,500
Move

245
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,375

248
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,041
And you are totally out of danger now

249
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,500

We have a child here

276
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,917
He is in a pretty bad shape

277
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,041
his fingers have been chopped as well

278
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,041
The wound looks pretty bad

279
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,750
We are bringing him in

280
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,292
You know I donâ€™t like you

281
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,750

You canâ€™t do that. Thatâ€™s cheating! Tch..

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,708
Baba, this is why I never play with her

285
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,667
What do you mean itâ€™s cheating. Baba I canâ€™t do that right?

286
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,666
No you canâ€™t. You just made that rule yourself

287
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,708
Ujji learn how to act your age

288
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:20,875
You canâ€™t do it from the right but you can do it from the left

289
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,042
Assalam o Alaikum

290

I can never repay you.

299
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,458
You have not only saved our son, but

300
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,250
our entire family, we would have fallen apart

301
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,459
We were..

302
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,834
We were in unimaginable agony

303
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,792
Mam . . No obligations are necessary..

304
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,500

It's been a very long day and we are drained

308
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,500
If you permit we would like to go home ..

309

317
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,584
Sherry! Why are you hiding behind him? Come on over

318
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,458
She acts so innocent before you, knocked off a guys face .. again

319
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,167
It was spur of the moment I swear boss

320
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,208
Hi Sherry! Long time.

321
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,333
Hey, how are you?

322
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,250
I am great

323
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,584
I see, you still kicking some ass eh

324
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,458
You know me

325
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,458
Who is the boss?

326
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,750
Him actually..

327
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,667
So boss..

328
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,916
Good work sherry

329
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,250
How is the child?

330
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,209
Actually, I put him to the hospital

331
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,250
Poor soul was so sick and completely petrified

332
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,375
You know they were holding him for 5 weeks

333
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,750
Can you believe that?

334
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:11,250
Physically, he is going to be ok but.. mentally he is scarred for
life

335
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,333
What kind of humans are these?

336
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,042
I am telling u, boss, they are not humans

337
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,041
You should give me some free hand

338
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,041
You shouldâ€™ve seen his parents

339
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,333
They were walking dead

340
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,375
We literally pulled them out of their graves and of course..

341
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,917
they want to see you and show you their gratitude tomorrow

342
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,125
Invite them over at 11

343
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,750

344
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,125

Will you marry my brother?

359
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,042
Is he asking that?

360
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,791
No, I swear to God, I didnâ€™t say anything, come on

I didnâ€™t think so either.. let him ask and then Iâ€™ll tell

364
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,208
Ujji, you are sleepy you act insane when you are sleepy

365
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,458
Dad

366
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,042
Dad, please talk to him

367
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,792
After that.. they will surrender themselves at the police station..

368
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,000
and confess to their crimes

369
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:33,125
and be sentenced by the courts for at least 10 years in prison

370
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,084
and tell your lawyers not be too smart ..

371
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,833
But.. But you just canâ€™t let them go away..

372
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:45,125
They will never do what you are asking them to..

373
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,084
They will run away

374
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,167
Donâ€™t worry nobody has ever run away

375
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,916
Relax...Relax...

376
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,250
and one last thing

377
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:58,875
I really don't like your faces

378
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,250
so if you get out of prison before ten years

379
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,875
we will be waiting for you

380
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,500
Assalam o Alaikum Dad

381
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Walaikum Asalam

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,542
Dad, it's time

383
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,500
Yeah . . . there is no cure for time

384
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,750
Dad I'm going to do it

385
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:51,500
You are an idealist, like your mother

386
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,083
Dad.. you agreed

387
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,834
It is the highest level

388
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:05,334
Without idealism, there is nothing

389
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,583
Dad do take care of yourself

390
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,459
take your medicines

391
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,459
I don't want to break jail

392
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:24,875
Nahhh . . I am a tough goat

393
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,542
Take care dad

394
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:35,458
Goodnight

395
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,958
So Mr. Asad.. you are saying, that you have killed two men?

396
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,458
I have killed many men

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,500
but except the two.. rest were in line of duty

398
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:57,250
Let me get this straight

399
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,875
There must Incident Reports for these murders

400
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,709
Uh no..

401
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,709
Eye witnesses?

402
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,167
Uhhh no..

403
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,125
The families must have filed a report?

404
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,292
No..In both cases. No

405
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,541
Why would you want to confess then?

406
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:27,084
It's the right thing to do

407
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,625
Mr. Asad can I have some details?

408
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,333
We haven't received our rightful 200 million yet. Pakistan and
China, are robbing this country

409
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,000
We will not let this happen

410
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,625
We will show China and Pakistan the consequences of their actions

411
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,083
Every 24 hours, we will kill one of the hostages and send them to
you

412
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,167
So that you may repent

413
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,833
Hello

414
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,833
Have you sent the transport? OK

415
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:47,291
I wasn't sneaking out, I didn't want to disturb you

416
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,708
Something wrong?

417
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,625
You play with that thing when something is wrong

418
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:11,792
No nothing is wrong, everything is fine..

419
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,000
The stupid phone rings in the middle of the night

420
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,375
and hubby dear leaves

421
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,583
Yeah it's pretty normal

422
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:27,459
Itâ€™s normal for a wife not to know about her husband

423
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,792
When will he return?

424
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,125
Is he alright?

425
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:37,250
Would he even return or... uhh yea..

426
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,291
I guess it happens to everyone. I guess its normal

427
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,458
Heyyy.. I always come back, donâ€™t I?

428
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,084
Because you are lucky so far

429
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,208
Yeah I am lucky, Iâ€™m very lucky!

430
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,208
And you know

431
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,708
Iâ€™m very jealous of this baboon, he gets more attention than I do

432
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,875
Yeah because heâ€™s with me and youâ€™re not

433
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:08,417
You know, you are lucky she likes you, otherwise I would've kicked
your butt

434
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,375
Hey I have to go, don't worry, I'll be back soon,

435
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,167
Asad, when will you be back?

436
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,541
Damn cockroach

437
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,375
Gentleman we have a hostage situation, they have kidnapped Chinese
engineers...

438
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,334
a hostage is being killed every 24 hours, this is unacceptable

439
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,417
Let's pay them a visit

440
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,166
We are doing HALO. This is your target area

441
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:42,083
You will flank Tangos from the right and secure the hostages

442
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,625
The choppers will pick you up here

443
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,083
Any questions?

444
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:48,792
No sir!

445
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:53,625
C130 leaves in 10 minutes. I want you on the tarmac in 5

446
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:54,709
Sir

447
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,625
Asad, hurry come here

448
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,208
Are you OK? Do we have to go to the hospital?

449
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,875
No.. not the hospital. Place your hand here!

450
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,333
Not here. . . here

451
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,291
Did you feel something?

452
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:10,916
Something moved ..

453
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,833
See, he knows you

454
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,375
How do you know it's a he?

455
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,625
I know my baby.. Move your hand

456
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,000
I will have a baby boy

457
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,125
And I will call him Azal..

458
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,125
Azal, Asad

459
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,584
Both names are short and unique

460
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,625
Okay.. But, what if itâ€™s a girl, I will make small ponytails

461
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,250
What will we call her?

462
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,250
you tell me

463
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,625
Arooj..

464
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,333
You OK?

465
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,250
Delta in position

466
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,791
Our demands have not been met

467
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:48,875
appears you love your money more than your people

468
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,625
Bravo in position

469
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,834
Charlie in position

470
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,583
Alpha in position

471
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,125
Ok go.

472
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,750
Grasshopper come in, over

473
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,583
Go

474
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,083
This is grasshopper, coming in

475
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,833
Grasshopper 30 sec

476
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,208
Cover the Chinese, move them back

477
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,750
Son you will be fine

478
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,250
Hopper 2 coming in

479
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,583
Ok coming, over

480
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,291
We have to take off

481
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,208
Wait wait

482
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,042
Sir how can we leave him?

483
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,666
Shit.. you have to take off

484
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,167
Shit

485
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:52,292
Wait

486
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:17,708
See that. There

487
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,959
You... You are really a Pathan

488
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,625
Sir, can I have some first aid please

489
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:10,750
Assalam o Alaikum sir

490
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:11,292
All good?

491
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:11,833
Sir...

492
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,375
How are the boys?

493
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,583
Aa... sir both are hit, they are in the hospital

494
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,167
both are out of danger sir

495
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:20,791
Good okay

496
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,833
I'll go and see them at CMH

497
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,208
Sir

498
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:28,541
and one thing more, you should also go to the hospital

499
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,208
Is everything's ok?

500
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,583
Your wife has probably had a fall

501
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,791
Ohh shit

502
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,541
What's with him?

503
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,791
Sir, she was expecting ..

504
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,875
Ok.. go with him

505
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:39,542
Sir

506
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,000
Asad?

507
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,708
You know I have been thinking

508
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,625
Oh is it 12?

509
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,250
What 's at 12?

510
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,958
You think at 12

511
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,625
you want to listen or donâ€™t you?

512
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,417
Ok ok go on

513
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:41,500
Husband and wife are like the needles of a clock

514
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:43,750
Okay

515
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:47,709
When they get married, they are really close to each other..

516
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:52,000
But with time, come children, responsibilities, work..

517
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,625
and they start moving away from each other

518
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:59,959
in the middle age, they are farthest from each other, it's like 6 in
the clock

519
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,916
slowly the responsibilities are over

520
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:09,750
Children get busy in their own lives, and the old couple drifts back
to each other

521
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:16,750
like its 12 all over again. I want it to stay 12 all our life

522
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:20,125
Yeah that's actually pretty nice

523
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:24,666
But you know, you have some Sikh genes in you

524
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:28,042
I'll hit you in the head with this bottle

525
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,583
Ah thatâ€™s ok, if you hit a soldier in the head, it's no harm done

526
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,500
Then I will hit your ankle

527
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,875
Hey, not the ankle. That hurts

528
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,333
Hey Seher I can't find my holster

529
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,333
Ohh Asad were you looking for this?

530
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:24,042
Exactly, what I was looking for. Thank you

531
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,583
Asad how will you live without me?

532
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,458
I won't live without you

533
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:29,417
Asad?

534
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,125
Hmmm..

535
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,167
Have you ever shot someone?

536
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:40,916
Uhh see I don't even know how to use this, the max I have done is to
wink at someone

537
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:41,875
And who did you wink at?

538
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:42,959
You

539
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:49,958
Hey don't worry, I just sit behind a table and push a pen

540
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So you relax

541
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:52,917
Nothing will happen to me

542
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,333
Bye

543
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:53,958
Take care

544
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,417
And it's the spoon in the box?

545
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:13,291
Yes

546
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:13,875
Ok

547
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:18,083
if you have any problem, just call me

548
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,333
Ok

549
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:22,833
Haider..

550
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:28,708
I don't understand.. How will Asad care for such a small child

551
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,583
Oh he will manage . . it's his daughter

552
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,375
But he doesn't know anything about babies

553
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:39,334
He was asking me, whether she is normal? why are her eyes open?

554
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:43,083
He thinks that babies open their eyes after a week or so ..

555
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,792
He probably thinks it's a puppy

556
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,333
I thought the same too

557
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,333
A puppy?

558
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,375
Thatâ€™s ridiculous, Haider

559
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:55,125
Actually, you never get to see a baby that small

560
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:59,042
Exactly my point Haider, we should have kept her for a while

561
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:02,375
Right now, being alone is the worst thing for him

562
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,833
Caring for a child will keep him focused

563
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,500
Besides it's not difficult to take care of a baby

564
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,750
Really? In that case you will take care of the next baby

565
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:15,084
hmm . .. means we should start planning for the next one?

566
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,958
Haider..

567
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,750
Sir, The General is here

568
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,334
Aani, have you had breakfast?

569
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,958
I was in China when I heard the terrible news

570
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:53,792
I always prayed that your fate be better than mine

571
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,459
But its Allah wills, be strong

572
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,375
Hmmm . .

573
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,042
If the wife is good looking

574
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,958
Then the children are good looking

575
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,916
Thatâ€™s true dad, I wish grandpa had known that too

576
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,792
I am very happy, that you've got your wits about

577
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,333
Would you like to have breakfast dad?

578
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,750
Yes, I am famished

579
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,209
Please have a seat

580
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:51,500
It's not easy to raise a child alone

581
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,125
You raised a child alone

582
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:59,084
Yes I did..but there were two major differences

583
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:03,958
One, you weren't newly born, the other that you were a boy

584
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,750
Women are complicated

585
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,333
Dad there is three of us

586
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:15,167
You , me, and this lady, we can raise a little girl

587
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:19,958
Son, I have got time, I will retire soon

588
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,875
How will you manage? How will you find time?

589
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:30,375
I was thinking Dad that I should apply for an early retirement...

590
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,250
I will have more disposable time

591
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:40,500
Hmm okay.. But if we both retire what will we do then?

592
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:45,084
Except security we donâ€™t have a skill

593
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:46,208
Ahhh thatâ€™s true?

594
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,333
Okay

595
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,417
Make a plan and we will do it ...

596
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,250
I have go now

597
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,708
Dad, at times I wonder

598
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,250
If only we had an intelligence report

599
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,583
About

600
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,875
where Allah keeps all the deceased...

601
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,084
we would carry out a raid, and bring them all back

602
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:12,292
Yes, that should surprise him. Bring your mom too

603
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:23,792
Son, always remember .. Man feels no pain. You know that right?

604
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:54,708
Mom, Dad doesnâ€™t know that you work at someoneâ€™s house .. what if he
finds out?

605
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:00,208
Your dad is a proud man .. so I donâ€™t want to tell him

606
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:05,917
But I want to help him in supporting the house

607
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:11,791
Mom .. I also want to help .. so let me do something too.

608
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:17,500
Youâ€™re looking after the house .. youâ€™re looking after your sister..
that is a lot of help

609
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:22,875
Lets talk about this later... I am getting late.... Good Bye

610
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:43,250
Hey, Shorty where is the General?

611
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,542
Sir, he is waiting outside

612
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:45,208
Oh okay

613
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,125
Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go we are getting late

614
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,167
Allah hafiz

615
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,708
Assalam o Alakium dad!

616
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,875
Hahahahha

617
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:54,208
O Walaikum Assalam

618
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,375
I was just finishing off my cigarette. Canâ€™t smoke in the car

619
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,375
How is my Ujjuu?

620
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:00,959
Hahahhaa

621
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:04,417
Whatâ€™s wrong? You havenâ€™t shaved today?

622
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,583
Dad, nobody is looking at me now?

623
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,125
When you are going to take loan from these bankers

624
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:12,250
You need to wear a suit like them.

625
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,000
Hahaha

626
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,417
Go and wear a suit, Go on

627
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,375
Okay dad

628
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,292
I will finish my cigarette till then

629
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,458
Iâ€™ll be right back

630
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Letâ€™s go little baby, come on

631
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:21,375
Thatâ€™s too less

632
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,417
should be a little more

633
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,333
Let me see your work first and then maybe you get a raise

634
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:30,584
Give this to me and then see

635
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:35,625
Will you make it? Great! Here are the threads and beads

636
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,875
This is the design. Make a copy of this design

637
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,917
Then we will see your work.. okay?

638
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:49,041
When I am finished ... how do I give this to you?

639
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,667
Our NGOâ€™s office is on the next street

640
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,959
It has a green color board

641
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,583
My name is Bilqis. You can deliver it at the office

642
00:52:57,833 --> 00:53:01,666
Or I will come back after 2 days and I will collect it from you

643
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,208
Please repeat?

644
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,458
Sir, a woman is here for the interview

645
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:10,959
O okay .. Send her in

646
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,583
Sir, Musa sir is also here

647
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:18,958
Umm..okay send the woman first and then send Musa

648
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,333
Sir, can I go meet Musa?

649
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,333
Yes, yes go on!

650
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,583
My baby

651
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:28,125
are you feeling hungry?

652
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:34,917
Assalam o Alakium sir

653
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:36,000
How are you, sir?

654
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:38,167
Heyyy Shorty, how are you?

655
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,000
Very good sir

656
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:39,667
How are you?

657
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:40,792
I am great

658
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:41,500
Howâ€™s everything?

659
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:42,334
Good sir

660
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,125
Continuing with the job Sir

661
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,125
I will be retiring in a few months

662
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,417
Oh, any plans after retirement?

663
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,500
I havenâ€™t decided anything yet

664
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,416
Do you need men?

665
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:25,500
Of course I need men . .

666
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,250
the day you retire you have a place waiting

667
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:28,792
Done?

668
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,541
Yes sir

669
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,083
Okay

670
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:30,792
Want some tea?

671
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:31,667
Sure sir

672
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:43,708
I am missing Sher Shah today..I hope he is okay..

673
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:12,333
Baba, baba

674
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:15,750
Mujahidin are here

675
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,792
Mujahidin? How many men?

676
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:20,959
Four or five of them

677
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:25,916
Make them sit ..I will be over

678
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:30,167
Zarmina, Zarmina

679
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:32,292
Yes, what is it?

680
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:36,667
Make tea for 4,5 men

681
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,416
OK!

682
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:48,250
This is a political issue.. itâ€™s a war between the kings for land
and country

683
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:53,708
I have nothing to do with it

684
00:55:53,958 --> 00:56:01,375
Whether the name of King is Zahir Shah or some Russian..My life
remains the same

685
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:07,167
Nadir shah, Jihad is our religious duty

686
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:16,500
Of course it is, but this is politics not religion, our religion has
not been attacked

687
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:21,875
The Russians are not asking us to abandon our religion and join
theirs

688
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:31,041
If that happens I will be the first to fight them

689
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:36,375
If that doesnâ€™t happen, I have no fight with the Russians

690
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:38,917
Nadir shah, you donâ€™t understand

691
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:48,166
I understand everything; my children need good food and good life

692
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,125
I donâ€™t need a war

693
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:59,583
You are free to do as you please in your own area, your own village,
your own country

694
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,959
Sher Shah seemed worried today

695
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:17,292
He is young, hot blooded and easily influenced

696
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:21,833
I know someone like that

697
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:31,500
We will have to leave here

698
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,583
Leave why?

699
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:43,292
A brutal war is coming ..I canâ€™t bear to see my children being
consumed..

700
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:47,792
But you said Russians will not harm us, they cant come here?

701
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:56,750
Yes, but when the forest catches fire, it burns everything in its
way

702
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:58,667
But where will we go?

703
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:04,875
Far from this place .. to Karachi

704
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:09,583
Karachi? ..What will we do there?

705
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:16,709
We will wait for the war to end

706
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:34,625
Baba are we going to Karachi?

707
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,292
Probably yes

708
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,084
Is Karachi a good place?

709
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:46,209
I think it's good...The thing is, there is no war there.

710
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:52,208
Do they have schools for girls?

711
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:55,167
I think they do

712
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,792
Can I go to school there?

713
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:09,917
Of course if things are good, sure you can go

714
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,542
Are there people who will stop me from going to school?

715
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:31,167
Donâ€™t worry, when I allow you, no one can stop you.

716
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,417
Malalai Run

717
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:38,000
Sher Shah we are getting late

718
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,750
Sher Shah get in, weâ€™re getting late

719
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,833
No mom you guys go ahead, I have some work here

720
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:55,500
Sher Shah donâ€™t do this. Let's go

721
01:00:56,042 --> 01:01:01,000
Mom I said I have work ..I will come when I am done.

722
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:09,083
Baba you go ahead, Goodbye.

723
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,250
I have brought you milk, you must drink it

724
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:05,750
Mom place it outside, I will be right there

725
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,500
Okay. I am keeping it outside, donâ€™t forget it today.

726
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:15,750
Dad, you shouldn't have involved yourself in this election business

727
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,417
These people are very vicious

728
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,333
I have talked to him

729
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,792
Walaikumassalam

730
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:24,541
He will not do anything now...

731
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,041
and nor will he go anywhere...

732
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,666
he will go straight to the school, teach children...

733
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,500
wonâ€™t talk to anyone about politics

734
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:35,292
wonâ€™t go to the election office ... just come home straight from
school

735
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:39,666
Dad, you donâ€™t have to listen to anyone

736
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,834
Our country is a mess because of these cowards

737
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:46,833
they donâ€™t do anything themselves and expect others to do things for
them

738
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,916
how can we expect change without doing do something about it?

739
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,333
How will things be set right?

740
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:55,250
What can the two of you do? Tell me, what can you do?

741
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,333
You will lose even the two meals you get a day

742
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,625
Mom, you donâ€™t know anything. Just leave it

743
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:02,834
You don't know anything

744
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,458
You think

745
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,125
the feudal lord will stay quiet?

746
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:08,209
his men are vicious

747
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,250
He owns the police

748
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,625
and do we have money for the elections?

749
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,625
That must be my rickshaw

750
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,708
Lord, May I go now?

751
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,250
Have you taken anything from here?

752
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,459
No my lord

753
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:37,833
Hahahahaha

754
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:41,542
Even if you do, where will you run?

755
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:54,084
Salam Lord

756
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,333
Be quiet all of you!

757
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,750
Donâ€™t worry, we will win, weâ€™ve already won

758
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:07,875
We will eat fish, have opium and make more babies

759
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:14,750
We will win

760
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:17,667
Lord... we are being humiliated in the area

761
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:20,542
A school teacher contesting elections against you

762
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:24,208
We shouldâ€™ve killed him a long time ago

763
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:27,791
Do not kill him...

764
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:35,916
If you kill him, who will spread the tales of his misery?

765
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:44,125
Power must be advertised, not just exercised

766
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,125
Come here

767
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:01,791
And Listen

768
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,042
Did you make the flag?

769
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:15,833
Lord... you asked me to make a flag so I made it

770
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:17,584
Moustache?

771
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:22,667
Lord, it's symbol of pride for a man

772
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:30,542
Lord... Lord... we can remove it

773
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:36,833
But then... what symbol of man do you want on the flag?

774
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,334
You know teacher?

775
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,541
Working women is not a good thing

776
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,667
My daughter is a lawyer

777
01:08:56,125 --> 01:09:03,000
And no country in the world has ever progressed, if half of its
population stays at home

778
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,125
These are the sayings of educated people.

779
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:21,708
People here are illiterate and ignorant

780
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,917
Narrow minded

781
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,417
Women going out of their homes

782
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,459
These are dangerous times

783
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,417
You sister isnâ€™t home yet.

784
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,875
She isnâ€™t?

785
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:12,417
No...

786
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,417
Where is Dad?

787
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,292
He is gone to look for her

788
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:20,125
She has never been this late. I hope she is OK

789
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,125
Please donâ€™t worry

790
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:25,792
I have a bad feeling about this, my heart is sinking

791
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:31,875
Dad... where is Ayesha?

792
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:35,334
Where is she... where is my daughter?.. Where is she??

793
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,625
Why arenâ€™t you answering? Tell me, answer me

794
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,500
She isnâ€™t there

795
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:39,084
She isnâ€™t?

796
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:40,250
No

797
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:44,334
I asked her colleague, he told me that she left on time

798
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,708
Have you asked the rickshaw driver?

799
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:50,333
Yes I asked him. He said that he waited for her but Ayesha didnâ€™t
show up

800
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:55,000
The Lordâ€™s men... The Lordâ€™s men have taken her

801
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:59,334
Oh God! My poor girl?

802
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,958
Move over... I will ask the rickshaw driver myself

803
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:03,750
Letâ€™s go to the police station

804
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,167
What good will going to the police do? The SHO is Lordâ€™s slave

805
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:10,875
Whatever the rickshaw driver says, we will have to go to the police

806
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:14,959
Going to the Police will be so scandalous? Don't you know that?

807
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,667
I am sure she will be back in a while..

808
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:18,750
Oh, my daughter!!!

809
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:20,792
Come on lets go, we are going to the police

810
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,167
Why donâ€™t you talk straight, teacher?

811
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,750
She is young..

812
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,542
she is pretty ...

813
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:32,709
she is educated ..

814
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,417
She has gone off with someone with consent

815
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,833
Has she expressed her interest in anyone?

816
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,958
You know whatâ€™s going on!!

817
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:45,625
besides Rajab came to our house in the morning

818
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:48,791
Musa khan...

819
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,250
Yes sir?

820
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,208
she has an interest in Rajab?

821
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,875
Hold your tongue

822
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:01,542
Son of a *****...

823
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,958
Donâ€™t you have any manners?

824
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,917
I will beat the crap out of you

825
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:09,000
If she has eloped with someone, is it my fault?

826
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:13,416
You are recklessly accusing a noble man without a reason..

827
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,125
I have understood everything

828
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,292
Your sister had an affair with someone

829
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,250
you have killed her for honour

830
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,334
And now I will investigate this

831
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:28,417
SHO sir... please donâ€™t bother... we will look for her ourselves

832
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:31,542
How can I not bother, teacher?

833
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:34,042
A girl is missing

834
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:37,125
God knows what you have done with her

835
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:40,250
I have a duty

836
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:45,292
Listen son... I will go and talk to the Lord myself

837
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,000
Letâ€™s go son

838
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:48,667
Talk to whoever you want

839
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:53,125
But he stays here till the matter is solved

840
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,333
SHO sir... he is my son

841
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:58,500
we are already very worried

842
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,250
That's all teacher

843
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,709
don't interfere in the matters of the state

844
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,583
Musa khan... take him away

845
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,292
teacher

846
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:17,250
You must go now

847
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,125
How are you?

848
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:39,292
Do you need anything?

849
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,250
You are scum..

850
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,542
how dare you?

851
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:48,042
these feudals are powerful because of scum like you

852
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,666
Watch your mouth..

853
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,500
youâ€™re in no position to yell at me

854
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:59,833
Very soon you will kissing my feet ..

855
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,083
begging me for mercy ..

856
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,416
Let me go, you scum

857
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:11,125
donâ€™t you understand, the feudal will do the same to your daughters?

858
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:13,584
No he won't..

859
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:21,042
because I will keep giving him daughters of others

860
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,666
But you and me come later, first you must satisfy the master

861
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:30,458
later I will break you

862
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:48,583
In the whole wide world you have given us Pakistan

863
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,542
You think you are GOD??

864
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:10,667
You are beautiful..

865
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,916
people were right about you..

866
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,917
and also proud

867
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:29,459
I have always wanted people to call me

868
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,333
My Lord.. My Lord..

869
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,500
Say it like you say in the court .. My Lord

870
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,458
Who is it??

871
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,500
sir, the school teacher is here..wants to see you

872
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:44,875
Your father is here.

873
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:52,875
tell him I am busy .. I will see him in the morning

874
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:54,917
Wait

875
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Yes?

876
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:06,292
Let me hear your father grovel and beg and plead..

877
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:09,875
He realizes his place now ..

878
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,958
Then I will come and hear you plead

879
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:20,583
Daughter?

880
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:24,459
You have a daughter?

881
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,375
Sir ..

882
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,458
Sir she is innocent and naive..

883
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,042
She hasn't done anything

884
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,791
Please let my daughter go free

885
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:35,584
Let her go free?

886
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,500
Teacher Iâ€™m treating you with respect ..

887
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:43,334
what are you saying?

888
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:46,083
Are you accusing me of something?

889
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,708
I know we are political rivals ..

890
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:56,291
but accusing me to win an election is so unfair

891
01:16:56,958 --> 01:17:01,833
Sir, my wife won't be able to bear it, she will die..

892
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,417
Sir I beg of you, for God sake..

893
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:05,417
for the sake of the Holly Prophet...

894
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,791
What is happening here?

895
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:15,291
are the women of the area not safe?

896
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:18,958
What is the Police Officer doing?

897
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:22,583
call him here...

898
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,458
Teacher, go home .. and you too

899
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:33,833
until you have found the Teacher's daughter..
I Donâ€™t want to see your faces

900
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,458
Any news?

901
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:49,417
Where is my Ayesha?

902
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,750
Where is my Ahsan?

903
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,042
Why you won't say something??

904
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,542
Why are you quite?

905
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,750
Where is my Ayesha?

906
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:04,334
Where is my Ahsan?

907
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,125
Why are the mosques announcing this?

908
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,375
why are they saying this about my daughter?

909
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,291
Why donâ€™t you say something?

910
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:24,000
My kids..

911
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,334
My Ashan

912
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,292
Why are you not saying anything?

913
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,750
Why won't you speak?

914
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:37,792
Where are my kids? Where are they?

915
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,917
Lord.. May I come in?

916
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,583
Come in Ghungru come in

917
01:18:52,542 --> 01:18:54,375
They came to me earlier

918
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,125
His son was being aggressive ..

919
01:18:57,792 --> 01:18:59,459
so I locked him up

920
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:03,834
When we find the body of the sister we will charge the brother with
murder

921
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:09,167
You are getting smart Ghungru..

922
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,500
you will rise in rank

923
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,083
Tell me...

924
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:22,833
What makes you think that you will find the girl's body?

925
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:26,208
I have served you long enough, sir.

926
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:36,125
She is gone.. my daughter is gone

927
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,292
she left me..

928
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:41,083
Allah.. How many times did I tell you?

929
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:44,458
I told you that no one stands with truth

930
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,792
Liars .. everyone is a liar

931
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,083
Cowards and meek

932
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,833
The honest can never win here ..

933
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,709
Look, they silenced you..

934
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:58,416
Silenced my daughter... Oh God silenced my daughter...

935
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:01,625
I told you... I told you...

936
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,250
But you wouldn't listen

937
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,542
My daughter is gone now.. sheâ€™s gone forever

938
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:08,583
She's gone. What do I do?

939
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:22,625
Murderers... Murderers...

940
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:24,458
Asma!

941
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:28,209
Asma control yourself

942
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:31,583
Asma .. Asma come to your senses

943
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:33,334
Asma.. open your eyes

944
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,416
Asma.. Asma.. someone please call doctor

945
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:37,916
Asma!

946
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,875
go away teacher

947
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,958
go to your principles and seek comfort

948
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:46,084
Oh and Teacher

949
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,583
When you bury your daughter and your wife..

950
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,250
Bury your son too ..

951
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,666
I'm dead to you

952
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,333
Baba..

953
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:31,584
Do you think you can win the elections without us?

954
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:32,750
It's difficult this time

955
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,250
Then ..?

956
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:35,958
Who are you?

957
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:42,375
Do you want to enjoy the fruit or ...

958
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,417
or not enjoy the fruit?

959
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,583
Umm OK

960
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:51,042
OK

961
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:57,958
then let us meet after the elections..

962
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,333
OK

963
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:12,167
Sir, there's a huge crowd outside

964
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,583
I'll talk to them right after this call

965
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,083
Get ready to be the Chief Minister

966
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:22,458
Mend fences with the enemies and throw crumbs to the greedy ..

967
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,958
Sure sure. Allah Hafiz

968
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,958
Allah Hafiz

969
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:33,125
We need clear majority

970
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,584
how do we get it?

971
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,041
Same as always, use money

972
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,584
use human greed for power

973
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,625
I can arrange all this but on two conditions ...

974
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,166
Your party must support me all the way ..

975
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,708
and

976
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,042
Mr. Imtiaz Ijaz... will be the CM..

977
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,042
Mr. Imtiaz Ejaz will be the CM..

978
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:09,250
but will you be able to do this?

979
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:19,083
I exist to serve ..

980
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:23,375
Sir, tomorrow you will join this party

981
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:25,584
What's in it for me?

982
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:48,209
Sir, you have already been rewarded

983
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,333
Without us you would not have won the elections

984
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,875
if you have any doubt on this

985
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:05,375
we can always hold election again for your seat

986
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:10,541
A simple complaint to the election commission..

987
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:16,875
and the person who stamped all fictitious votes for you will confess
..

988
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,125
But

989
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:24,417
if you hold your end of the bargain.. you will win the next
elections too

990
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:27,500
and if you don't ...

991
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:34,083
You will not only lose your seat now..

992
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:40,333
but will also face the consequences of backing out ..

993
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:43,292
Tomorrow eh?

994
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:10,167
you watch too many movies ..

995
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:19,334
He becomes MPA and is drinking juice ..

996
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,583
How stupid ..

997
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:35,291
In the whole wide world you have given us Pakistan

998
01:27:37,292 --> 01:27:38,209
Who gave you this?

999
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:41,500
A man came over and said its very important that you see it ..

1000
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:45,333
you should not take things from people you donâ€™t know.. Open it

1001
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:49,209
Wait wait

1002
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:52,416
Leave ..

1003
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,958
Zara..

1004
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,250
Yes papa?

1005
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,666
What is the problem? Have you spoken to Imtiaz..

1006
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:37,292
what is wrong?

1007
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:41,167
I have spoken to him.. but he won't listen

1008
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,125
He has simply refused to be the CM..

1009
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,208
What do we do now?

1010
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,250
We will have to look for a new candidate for CM

1011
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:58,292
someone who is acceptable to all

1012
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:01,959
We have only four days

1013
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,958
You have confessed to a murder you did not commit and you are saying
this is the best option?

1014
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:11,583
Baba the police and the court are under their control ..

1015
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:14,167
We have no hope here

1016
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:15,833
Everyone is afraid of them

1017
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:20,083
even the lawyers won't take our case..

1018
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:23,125
we need to get out from this area ..

1019
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:24,084
we have to get to a higher forum before we are heard ..

1020
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,125
I will be loyal to

1021
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:06,709
and will always support Pakistan

1022
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,500
And I

1023
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,209
as a

1024
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,458
Chief Minister

1025
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,333
Will discharge my duties with

1026
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,333
Honesty

1027
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:19,917
utmost intelligence

1028
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:23,584
and diligence

1029
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:25,792
That I

1030
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,250
will perform

1031
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:29,500
my official duties by

1032
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:32,625
being impartial to all people

1033
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:35,125
without any fear

1034
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:38,042
without favor or hatred

1035
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:40,625
in accordance to the law

1036
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:43,584
and will provide justice to all

1037
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:08,042
You had everything . . why did you back off?

1038
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:16,459
even if I wanted to, I couldnâ€™t tell you..

1039
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,791
But I can tell

1040
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,375
who is responsible for this..

1041
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:24,750
Who?

1042
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:27,750
The one who benefits the most

1043
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:30,334
Benefits the most?

1044
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:33,458
Him?

1045
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:37,542
Poor guy will be a martyr

1046
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:57,792
This is not fair. The hands that work, canâ€™t afford the produce

1047
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:09,333
You are right. The hands that work have a certain right to the
produce

1048
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:19,041
You have worked harder than me, you take it

1049
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,625
I will take it next time, this is yours

1050
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,708
I have to go and get some money for home

1051
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,708
Heyy gorgeous, what's the hurry?

1052
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,417
What is your name hoty..

1053
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,750
Talk to me, where are going?

1054
01:32:48,792 --> 01:32:49,709
Hey, she's mine

1055
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:14,125
Zarmeena... Zarmeena...

1056
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,958
God, where the hell is she?

1057
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,125
Zameena..

1058
01:33:17,542 --> 01:33:18,459
She is slow..

1059
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,250
I swear..

1060
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:20,000
I know..

1061
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:21,666
Yes sir

1062
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:24,791
I told you like 30 minutes ago to get me glass of milk..

1063
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:27,208
Do you not understand.. get me glass of..

1064
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,292
Can you please translate?

1065
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:30,041
Milk.. milk..

1066
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:32,083
He wants milk, milk okay

1067
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,625
Woman, do you get it? Milk

1068
01:33:34,667 --> 01:33:35,667
Go get it

1069
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:36,541
Oh okay, I'll just get it..

1070
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:48,625
Can you help me get home Please?

1071
01:33:49,042 --> 01:33:50,875
My home is very near

1072
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,542
Just help me cross these people

1073
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:31,000
Thanks

1074
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:47,834
The Police does not collect evidence and the people don't testify

1075
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:51,792
We are all responsible for this state of affairs

1076
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:53,959
What do I do?

1077
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,708
everybody is sympathetic

1078
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:58,541
everyone knows

1079
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:00,542
I am telling the truth

1080
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:06,917
but nobody is doing anything to help

1081
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:09,375
because they can't do anything

1082
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,458
Look, as long as he is the CM

1083
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:19,125
you cannot do anything, about him or his men

1084
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:30,542
I have a piece of land, if I sell it, I can pay your fee

1085
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,750
paying my fees won't solve your problem

1086
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:43,042
Once the snake winds itself around a prey the only way to break the
grip is to cut off the snake head

1087
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:54,417
We have to cut off the head

1088
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:26,125
Sir, you are away from the bull

1089
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:27,167
See that?

1090
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,667
That's his firing pattern

1091
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:31,958
Double tap to the throat

1092
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:34,792
Are we to bring the man down or score points?

1093
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,250
Salam o Alaikum

1094
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,542
Umm.. If you have to go to the NGO, I can take you there..

1095
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:05,042
Day after tomorrow

1096
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:06,834
Oh but..

1097
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:08,417
I won't be there day after tomorrow..

1098
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:11,209
Friday? I will be here on Friday?

1099
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:19,959
Are you insane? What if someone sees you here?

1100
01:37:20,917 --> 01:37:23,750
Go from here.. Go..

1101
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:26,750
You want to eat this?

1102
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,292
Bhabi , feeding her is tricky. Let me try. . .

1103
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,416
Youâ€™ll get tired..

1104
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,792
Asadbhai, nobody gets tired of feeding a child

1105
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:34,542
Control to Raven over

1106
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,291
Raven clear

1107
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:39,500
Sir, kindly, come on a landline phone

1108
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,208
Okay... excuse me

1109
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:44,959
Bhai have you decided anything?

1110
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:46,292
About what Bhabhi?

1111
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:47,750
AsadBhai..

1112
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,625
AsadBhai..You have a long life ahead of you... how will u manage it?

1113
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:53,708
Bhabi... I canâ€™t go through all of it all over again

1114
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:57,750
All ok?

1115
01:37:58,833 --> 01:37:59,750
There was an attack on the CM

1116
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,042
Is he okay?

1117
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:03,041
Yes he is safe..

1118
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:05,208
but security guards were killed

1119
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,166
You incompetent idiots

1120
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,167
stupid .. useless

1121
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:16,375
all you can do is harass the poor villagers..

1122
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:20,041
you are just pimps and boot leggers?

1123
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:22,875
If I rely on you all my hard work will be destroyed

1124
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:27,458
you... I want the security that is available to the President

1125
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:32,625
Sir, that is available only to the Federal government, Provincial
officials cannot have it..

1126
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,125
Hmmm...? I am the Chief Minister...

1127
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:40,959
I want that security!

1128
01:39:29,167 --> 01:39:33,250
Sir, some people are here regarding the security proposals that we
invited

1129
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,125
Hmm... are they any good?

1130
01:39:36,708 --> 01:39:38,583
He is a retired general of the Special Forces sir...

1131
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:41,375
Call them . .

1132
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:45,500
they have certain requirements first

1133
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:48,875
What is this?

1134
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:53,208
Sir, they need licenses for certain weapons

1135
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:55,625
They also need some equipment

1136
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:56,667
And sir..

1137
01:39:57,292 --> 01:40:01,334
they want to install CCTV cameras all over the CM house

1138
01:40:02,958 --> 01:40:03,708
Not possible..

1139
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,000
Exactly my point Sir

1140
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:09,792
your new suite.. And your office

1141
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:14,792
Sensitive matters of government happen there... that should not be
recorded..

1142
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:17,000
Cameras will not be installed ..

1143
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:17,667
Call them in

1144
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:18,792
Yes sir

1145
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:27,750
Assalam o Alaikum

1146
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,583
Walaikumassalam..

1147
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:31,583
My son Asad..

1148
01:40:34,792 --> 01:40:37,167
Are you sure

1149
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:39,834
you can protect me?

1150
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,500
We are Special Forces sir

1151
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:44,041
we are the best in the world

1152
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:51,208
What will you charge?

1153
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,958
We are expensive Sir

1154
01:40:57,625 --> 01:40:58,375
Reason?

1155
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:01,416
We think your life is very precious..

1156
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,833
what do you think?

1157
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:08,791
Haha

1158
01:41:10,667 --> 01:41:12,292
I like your answer

1159
01:41:14,792 --> 01:41:17,000
1-year agreement... 3 months probation

1160
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,208
Alright, sir... you have the requirements

1161
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:29,125
There will be slight changes but..you will get the approvals

1162
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:30,459
Thank you

1163
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,500
Hey Asad... I donâ€™t have a good feeling about this..

1164
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,667
Why Dad?

1165
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:48,916
This is a very taxing job and will have a lot of conflict

1166
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:56,166
are we doing the right thing protecting this feudal

1167
01:41:57,542 --> 01:42:01,750
Dad..They are all feudal.. Besides they are the choice of the people

1168
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:04,542
Look at it this way, itâ€™s good money..

1169
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:08,250
Itâ€™s a high profile contract..we get our choice of equipment..

1170
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:10,709
and we are professionals.. This is what we do

1171
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,792
we are not concerned with politics..

1172
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,875
Everybody is concerned with politics

1173
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:19,875
we are not mercenaries

1174
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:22,250
it's our own land

1175
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,375
Anyway... you carry on

1176
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:30,708
Iâ€™m taking Arooj home..Letâ€™s go

1177
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:11,375
I am not Ramzan... my name is Nadir Shah

1178
01:43:12,292 --> 01:43:14,209
Oh..I must be mistaken..

1179
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:17,333
Where does Mr. Ramzan live in this area?

1180
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:20,333
May be in some other area... I donâ€™t know

1181
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:22,666
Oh okay.. Thank you

1182
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:32,791
Excuse me sir

1183
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:35,916
Please place all your metal objects here

1184
01:43:37,792 --> 01:43:39,667
Here? In front of everyone?

1185
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:43,125
Sir, put all your metal objects here

1186
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:47,334
I am your CMâ€™s right hand

1187
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:52,209
If you cooperate with me, I will get you promoted

1188
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:56,167
Please sir, I am requesting you

1189
01:43:56,625 --> 01:44:02,333
I just told you.. No one orders Rajjab around ...

1190
01:44:06,125 --> 01:44:10,292
Leave me, I will have you dismissed

1191
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:16,792
Major, my orders did not mean that you start beating my people

1192
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:19,375
Apologize to him

1193
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:29,208
Sir your orders are that nobody can bring in weapons

1194
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:34,208
in future, if you want him to bring in weapons, we will allow him

1195
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:38,000
presentlywe have followed your orders Sir

1196
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,500
I will think about this and let you know..

1197
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:47,709
Thank you

1198
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:49,083
Yes, sir...

1199
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,875
she hit you here?

1200
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:01,125
Sayien...

1201
01:45:01,375 --> 01:45:02,333
It hurts

1202
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:04,208
You were beaten by a girl?

1203
01:45:04,542 --> 01:45:08,500
Lord, she is not an ordinary girl... she is strong as an Ox

1204
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:14,125
when you wear pants and shirts, you become sissy

1205
01:45:16,708 --> 01:45:17,750
Hey, how are you?

1206
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:21,291
Haven't seen you in many days

1207
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,375
You look upset?

1208
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,458
Was it your father, the other day?

1209
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:36,167
Where the hell have you been?

1210
01:45:38,292 --> 01:45:39,709
You havenâ€™t been to work for 3 days..

1211
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:41,958
Do own the city?

1212
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:44,208
I am not feeling well

1213
01:45:44,667 --> 01:45:46,000
I have high fever

1214
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:50,875
Eh.. Itâ€™s good that you have fever..you are hot

1215
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:54,334
Be at your place at 7 in the evening

1216
01:45:54,750 --> 01:46:00,000
Or I will rearrange your face

1217
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:02,583
Letâ€™s go

1218
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,417
Listen..please give me some money, I need to buy medicine

1219
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:11,541
Money doesnâ€™t grow on trees.. You will have to earn it

1220
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:12,458
Lets go

1221
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:17,667
How much?

1222
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:24,833
How much is this for?

1223
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:25,667
60..

1224
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:27,375
Make it forty my friend

1225
01:47:26,208 --> 01:47:26,750
Sayien .

1226
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:38,625
Sayien . Lord..The same police officer has taken a girl, there will
be problems, it is a business of 5 million a month..

1227
01:47:39,042 --> 01:47:43,167
we have worked hard to set this up and have brought the girls from
far and wide

1228
01:47:43,208 --> 01:47:47,375
Calm JJ down..and call the IG of police

1229
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:15,792
The boy..Ahsan..

1230
01:48:16,333 --> 01:48:18,541
We have started communicating with him

1231
01:48:19,167 --> 01:48:20,167
I have thought of something..

1232
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:21,209
What?

1233
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:23,333
The smaller the chain

1234
01:48:23,792 --> 01:48:27,959
and the sooner its broken the better

1235
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,250
Yes, but

1236
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:30,792
If he

1237
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:33,625
doesnâ€™t return to the jail.. then..

1238
01:48:33,667 --> 01:48:36,417
it will be a problem ..

1239
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,292
Did we get him out of Jail?

1240
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:40,458
No

1241
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:43,291
Then it is the problem of Jail authorities

1242
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,333
Huh.. Okay..

1243
01:48:56,375 --> 01:48:57,792
So is it that easy to get out of here?

1244
01:48:58,375 --> 01:48:59,625
and kill him?

1245
01:48:59,917 --> 01:49:00,959
I just told you

1246
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,125
I can help you

1247
01:49:03,917 --> 01:49:06,542
and you were in the jail.. how could you kill anybody?

1248
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,666
can you get me out of here?

1249
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:14,584
Yea..

1250
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:18,167
this is very common here.. We do it all the time

1251
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,083
Uhmm..But how will I kill such a powerful man?

1252
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,292
A Bullet goes through everybody

1253
01:49:30,167 --> 01:49:31,834
We will give you the plan

1254
01:49:32,833 --> 01:49:33,833
But why?

1255
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,500
Because you are dear to me..

1256
01:49:37,833 --> 01:49:41,833
And even if youâ€™re not, he is our enemy

1257
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:45,541
Why donâ€™t you do this yourself?

1258
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:48,083
We are doing it ourselves

1259
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:52,375
you are just playing your small part

1260
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:54,375
we are doing the rest

1261
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,958
The feudal lord is coming for a meeting tomorrow

1262
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,333
and he will have a press conference there

1263
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:17,208
I will be PTVâ€™s cameraman

1264
01:50:17,542 --> 01:50:19,209
This is your card

1265
01:50:19,917 --> 01:50:21,209
You will be the audio recorder

1266
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:28,375
this is your microphone with which you record him

1267
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:31,167
Aha...do not press the button

1268
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:36,500
there is a pen pistol inside . . with only 1 bullet... when you take
his interview

1269
01:50:36,542 --> 01:50:39,167
You can't miss, its straight in the face

1270
01:50:39,583 --> 01:50:41,291
What if real PTV reporters come?

1271
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:45,375
Donâ€™t worry we have taken care of it. They wonâ€™t come

1272
01:51:57,833 --> 01:51:59,708
Does the power go off at this time daily?

1273
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:04,250
don't know... there isn't a fixed time

1274
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:07,416
It comes and goes as it pleases

1275
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:12,833
I donâ€™t understand where the country is heading? What is our future?

1276
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:16,958
We are

1277
01:52:18,542 --> 01:52:20,125
waiting for someone.

1278
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,667
someone who will come and

1279
01:52:23,917 --> 01:52:25,625
fix everything for us

1280
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:27,000
Who will come?

1281
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:30,542
No one will

1282
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,125
How did you.....?

1283
01:52:39,042 --> 01:52:40,125
I got bailed Baba

1284
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:44,125
Bailed out??

1285
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:45,833
Yes

1286
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:46,708
How?

1287
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,833
Who bailed you out? Who was the lawyer?
When was the court hearing?

1288
01:52:52,792 --> 01:52:56,792
One of my close friends hired a lawyer

1289
01:52:57,708 --> 01:52:58,791
Which friend?

1290
01:52:59,417 --> 01:53:00,792
I met him in the jail

1291
01:53:06,792 --> 01:53:08,042
Anyway Baba

1292
01:53:08,792 --> 01:53:10,334
Donâ€™t worry

1293
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:12,750
Everything will be fine

1294
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:15,375
Itâ€™s not that simple son

1295
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,208
But Baba... nothing lasts forever

1296
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:22,958
not even people

1297
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:25,666
The Feudal won't live either

1298
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:28,584
Anyway,

1299
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:34,666
I am going to sleep. Ok?

1300
01:53:56,333 --> 01:54:01,750
A society where people take the law in their own hands, cannot
survive

1301
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:07,833
If you donâ€™t like the law, you can change it

1302
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:10,875
But you cannot take the law in your own hands

1303
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:15,417
I have stood for this principle all my life and I will not

1304
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,792
back off now

1305
01:54:18,667 --> 01:54:22,542
even if I have to lose my last hold . . my son

1306
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:24,375
Mr. Mohsin

1307
01:54:28,042 --> 01:54:29,750
you will remain in custody till we figure this out..

1308
01:54:30,042 --> 01:54:32,125
I am ready to be

1309
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,583
wherever you ask me to..

1310
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:40,750
I have one request though

1311
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:45,875
My son is not a bad person

1312
01:54:46,167 --> 01:54:47,959
He is acting emotionally

1313
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:52,625
please save him

1314
01:54:53,458 --> 01:54:55,875
He is my last hope.

1315
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,708
SS come in

1316
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:09,666
Lord... my son has been kidnapped...

1317
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:14,417
The kidnappers want 80 million rupees

1318
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:20,333
Chchchch... I feel so sorry for my country. Where are we headed?

1319
01:56:25,833 --> 01:56:27,000
Paliwala

1320
01:56:28,875 --> 01:56:30,917
I can tell the police...

1321
01:56:31,833 --> 01:56:34,291
They are lazy, incompetent, recruited under undue influence, not
merit

1322
01:56:36,292 --> 01:56:37,875
I donâ€™t know what they will do?...

1323
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:42,500
Yours son's life is in danger

1324
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:49,208
The other option is that I involve myself personally

1325
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,250
Yes Lord

1326
01:56:55,125 --> 01:56:56,833
Hmmm... arrange the money

1327
01:56:57,792 --> 01:56:59,917
I will find out who is behind this

1328
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,042
Lord... I can pay only 30 Million, I donâ€™t have any more

1329
01:57:05,917 --> 01:57:07,084
Hello

1330
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:10,333
My dearest friend

1331
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:11,292
Mr. Paliwala, Lord..

1332
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:12,750
Mr. Paliwala...

1333
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:15,833
someone has kidnapped his son

1334
01:57:17,542 --> 01:57:19,334
find out who has him

1335
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:22,333
he will bring 50 million tomorrow

1336
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:28,958
after taking the 50 million, should I let the kid go?

1337
01:57:56,667 --> 01:57:58,334
You informed against me?

1338
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,708
If it wasn't for you Father

1339
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:03,958
you wouldâ€™ve been dead by now

1340
01:58:04,792 --> 01:58:07,459
yourcompanion had planned to kill you after the task.

1341
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,417
I donâ€™t care about myself anymore

1342
01:58:12,417 --> 01:58:16,084
I have just one desire..to bring that man down.. That's it

1343
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,625
Son, you do not understand

1344
01:58:21,625 --> 01:58:24,500
There is a way of doing things..

1345
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:26,417
The law still exists

1346
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:28,459
Dad, you donâ€™t understand

1347
01:58:29,583 --> 01:58:31,166
There is no law here

1348
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:33,708
you are again following the nonexistent law

1349
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:37,541
Didn't the feudal lord kill our Ayesha?

1350
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:40,417
Hasnâ€™t Rajjab killed so many?

1351
01:58:41,833 --> 01:58:43,500
Doesnâ€™t everybody know the reality?

1352
01:58:43,958 --> 01:58:46,750
Then what should we do? Wait for our turns?

1353
01:58:48,083 --> 01:58:50,125
Son.. Nobody testifys

1354
01:58:50,167 --> 01:58:52,167
Who will testify now?

1355
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:54,125
What should I do?

1356
01:58:55,958 --> 01:58:56,833
Should I die?

1357
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,417
You will go back to jail. We will look into this..

1358
01:59:02,417 --> 01:59:05,834
and if you are telling the truth, you will get everything

1359
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,917
witnesses

1360
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:09,166
lawyers....

1361
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:10,416
and justice

1362
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:12,833
Sir...

1363
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:15,416
Nothing will happen here

1364
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,250
Yes it will

1365
01:59:20,083 --> 01:59:24,583
after that.. we killed the Teacher's daughter and threw her body in
the canal

1366
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:26,500
she was a nice girl

1367
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:28,750
but what could I do?

1368
01:59:29,458 --> 01:59:35,333
The SHO knew everything.
He implicated the teachers son in the murder

1369
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:39,750
but what could he do? It wasSayien'sdesire

1370
01:59:41,083 --> 01:59:42,750
Lord.. I have my own my daughters..

1371
01:59:43,625 --> 01:59:49,458
how can I harm my own daughters for the sake of others

1372
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:55,708
Who will save me? Who will help me?

1373
01:59:57,167 --> 01:59:57,959
This police...

1374
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:02,000
or these courts...

1375
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:06,458
no one will save me

1376
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:10,708
I have to help myself

1377
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,583
He is...

1378
02:00:13,792 --> 02:00:14,750
like me...

1379
02:00:17,417 --> 02:00:19,292
a captive of this system

1380
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:20,375
System... ???

1381
02:00:21,292 --> 02:00:23,084
the other 120 million people are not doing this...

1382
02:00:24,167 --> 02:00:25,667
just these few thousand?

1383
02:00:27,083 --> 02:00:29,333
they use the system as an excuse

1384
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:33,292
What should I do? Set him free?

1385
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:45,666
Ask him to confess, he must say all this in front of the police and
the the courts

1386
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,000
Ok

1387
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:54,792
Announce your verdict.

1388
02:00:55,917 --> 02:00:57,459
You have 15 days

1389
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:07,083
Within these 15 days, you have to confess all your crimes to the
police

1390
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:10,000
And if you don't..

1391
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:14,125
I think it was a secret agency or something

1392
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:18,083
God knows who all exist in this country

1393
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:22,792
What is this Major?

1394
02:01:25,042 --> 02:01:30,042
Ah... I donâ€™t know sir but he is not our security responsibility

1395
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:33,417
From now on he is

1396
02:01:34,917 --> 02:01:36,709
You will now provide security to him too

1397
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,000
Ah..ok Sir.

1398
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:42,000
but we will not extend support against government agencies

1399
02:01:43,333 --> 02:01:46,083
or in any illegal activity

1400
02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:48,875
Then what is the use of hiring you?

1401
02:01:48,917 --> 02:01:52,500
Sir, we are a company, we operate under the law of the land

1402
02:01:53,083 --> 02:01:55,166
we are not mercenaries

1403
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:17,375
So the wolf took a sheep..at night the shepherd realized that one
sheep was missing

1404
02:02:17,958 --> 02:02:27,583
next day the shepherd was very careful, but the wolf was yet able to
take another sheep

1405
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:35,583
the shepherd was worried so he came up with plan

1406
02:02:36,208 --> 02:02:47,625
next day the shepherd himself wore a sheepâ€™s skin and waited

1407
02:02:47,917 --> 02:02:58,417
When the wolf camethe shepherd, understood and killed the wolf.

1408
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:11,333
Moral of the story, sometimes to get your enemy, you must look
harmless to the enemy

1409
02:03:12,792 --> 02:03:13,959
Assalam u Laikam

1410
02:03:14,792 --> 02:03:18,042
Sit down, Sit down

1411
02:03:26,125 --> 02:03:33,958
Malalai, you must eat something, you are very weak

1412
02:03:35,917 --> 02:03:42,000
No..i donâ€™t want to eat..i am very sleepy

1413
02:03:42,417 --> 02:03:52,667
Malalai..Malalai..Malalai...I am going to get mom

1414
02:03:53,458 --> 02:03:55,625
Sayien its beautiful weather today

1415
02:03:55,667 --> 02:03:59,459
Yes . .. Just Donâ€™t use the underpass youâ€™ve built ...

1416
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,833
Its flooded

1417
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:03,250
Sayien, what about the mega project?

1418
02:04:03,875 --> 02:04:05,333
You are not paying me enough.

1419
02:04:06,167 --> 02:04:08,250
Sayien, There isnt much in it.

1420
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:11,042
But yes if I get that 500 flat scheme too...

1421
02:04:11,083 --> 02:04:12,375
then I could do something

1422
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,750
I will not give that project to you

1423
02:04:16,333 --> 02:04:18,208
People will die because of your construction

1424
02:04:18,917 --> 02:04:21,959
Uhh... sir, Pakistan has a big population

1425
02:04:22,333 --> 02:04:23,458
It leads to scandals

1426
02:04:24,208 --> 02:04:26,541
Sir there are no earthquakes here. .

1427
02:04:26,583 --> 02:04:29,083
the buildings will be fine for the next 8 to10 years

1428
02:04:29,583 --> 02:04:33,500
God knows, where you and I will be, in 10 years...

1429
02:04:33,792 --> 02:04:37,167
and even if a few thousand people die . . so what?

1430
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:41,083
Hmm... Hmm...

1431
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:44,000
Whoâ€™s she?

1432
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:48,958
Sir, there is a maid in our house, I think she is her daughter

1433
02:04:49,333 --> 02:04:50,958
I have seen her for the first time, sir

1434
02:04:51,625 --> 02:04:53,333
Get lost from here

1435
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:57,167
But remember this, I will deduct the entire dayâ€™s salary

1436
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:23,791
Let me take you to the hospital..

1437
02:05:24,417 --> 02:05:26,042
No son, we will go ourselves

1438
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:28,083
Uh... donâ€™t be sacred, I will get a rickshaw for you

1439
02:05:29,083 --> 02:05:30,541
No, we will manage

1440
02:05:30,833 --> 02:05:32,875
Uh no... It is raining, how will you manage to go?

1441
02:05:32,917 --> 02:05:37,500
Mom this is the same guy who met baba, we can go with him

1442
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,833
Lets go

1443
02:05:39,125 --> 02:05:40,375
No no, Iâ€™ll do it

1444
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:41,917
Come, have a seat

1445
02:06:33,625 --> 02:06:36,750
Lord, is everything all right? You are very quiet today

1446
02:06:40,667 --> 02:06:41,917
I donâ€™t feel so good

1447
02:06:43,042 --> 02:06:44,459
Are you okay, Lord?

1448
02:06:54,792 --> 02:06:57,084
I donâ€™t want these woman now

1449
02:06:59,125 --> 02:07:01,792
I want fresh meat now ... new women

1450
02:07:02,125 --> 02:07:03,792
Lord, that is a good thing..

1451
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,458
Good choice..

1452
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:08,500
You know my friend, the Builder ...

1453
02:07:08,833 --> 02:07:09,750
Yes Lord..

1454
02:07:10,917 --> 02:07:18,334
A woman works there... her daughter is...

1455
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:22,292
Sayien, youâ€™re upset because of a maidâ€™s daughter?

1456
02:07:23,083 --> 02:07:24,666
She will be here at your feet, tomorrow

1457
02:07:25,333 --> 02:07:26,666
All you have to do is order me

1458
02:07:29,125 --> 02:07:30,458
I just did.. Didnâ€™t I?

1459
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:32,750
Itâ€™s done then, Sayien, itâ€™s done!

1460
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,583
Hmmm...

1461
02:08:12,792 --> 02:08:14,584
Sir, he didnâ€™t steal, sir

1462
02:08:15,917 --> 02:08:17,292
I told you, I canâ€™t let him go

1463
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:22,417
You should meet the Chief Minister, he is a nice man

1464
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:26,375
If you have any problems in going there, I will take you there
myself

1465
02:08:26,417 --> 02:08:28,167
How can I go, sir?

1466
02:08:28,792 --> 02:08:30,167
You do something

1467
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,583
Sir... sir....

1468
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:38,417
Start the investigation again

1469
02:08:38,458 --> 02:08:42,250
Sir.. one minute please, one minute, sir

1470
02:08:42,833 --> 02:08:46,208
I will go, wherever you ask me to

1471
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:53,708
Hey,Moosa? How are you?

1472
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:55,208
All good, sir

1473
02:08:55,958 --> 02:08:57,333
Are the dances going on?

1474
02:08:57,375 --> 02:08:58,042
No Sir

1475
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,292
Nothing much happened today

1476
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:02,334
I think, everyone turned decent

1477
02:09:03,042 --> 02:09:03,584
Really?

1478
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:05,583
Carry on then..

1479
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:06,583
Yes sir

1480
02:09:40,792 --> 02:09:41,542
What is it?

1481
02:09:43,042 --> 02:09:47,000
Sayien... I have brought her... the girl you asked her

1482
02:09:47,792 --> 02:09:48,875
You brought her?

1483
02:09:48,917 --> 02:09:49,875
Yes Sayien.

1484
02:09:50,667 --> 02:09:55,125
But Lord, But Lord, she isnâ€™t here willingly... youâ€™d have to urge
her

1485
02:09:56,292 --> 02:09:58,334
Oh... That will be even more pleasing

1486
02:10:00,542 --> 02:10:01,000
Go

1487
02:10:01,458 --> 02:10:01,958
Lord..

1488
02:10:10,208 --> 02:10:13,250
You guys can go now, I will see you later

1489
02:10:14,875 --> 02:10:16,292
Come on, Sir wants to see you

1490
02:10:17,667 --> 02:10:18,709
Where are you going?

1491
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:20,750
You sit here, your Mom will talk to him

1492
02:10:20,792 --> 02:10:21,334

Come, your mother is calling you

1495
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,333
What are you doing here?

1496
02:11:18,375 --> 02:11:21,208

Nobody will come here

1516
02:11:54,708 --> 02:11:55,333
Come here

1517
02:11:55,375 --> 02:11:56,292

1525
02:12:21,125 --> 02:12:22,167

1540
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:52,458
Put it aside

1541
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,292
Ahh...

1542
02:12:54,375 --> 02:12:55,250

Come here

1544
02:13:17,125 --> 02:13:18,792
Your mother is here

1545
02:13:33,833 --> 02:13:39,916
Had I not taken farishtay, this would not have happened

1546
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:46,333
I should have left her at the hospital with malala

1547
02:13:47,083 --> 02:13:49,500
I was worried because of you

1548
02:13:50,458 --> 02:13:54,500
Zarmina stop it.. For god sake be quiet about this

1549
02:13:55,042 --> 02:13:57,959

1550
02:13:59,958 --> 02:14:02,875
I have to go to the hospital

1551
02:14:03,333 --> 02:14:06,000

1552
02:14:07,042 --> 02:14:09,959

Things are better there now

1558
02:16:01,667 --> 02:16:05,667

02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:12,042

02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,875
Goodbye

1565
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:42,958
My heart [echo]

1566
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:48,167
My heart is hidden in my loverâ€™s chest

1567
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:50,041
My heart [echo]

1568
02:16:50,083 --> 02:16:56,083
You have taken my body but couldn't take my heart

1569
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:57,958
My heart [echo]

1570
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,833
My love has undergone every suffering

1571
02:17:04,875 --> 02:17:11,917
So it has passed all the stages of pain

1572
02:17:11,958 --> 02:17:23,666
The heart couldn't let go

1573
02:17:23,708 --> 02:17:27,791
Took my body but couldn't take my heart

1574
02:17:27,833 --> 02:17:33,833
My heart [echo]

1575
02:18:11,417 --> 02:18:14,709
It is limitless

1576
02:18:15,333 --> 02:18:18,791
It has no boundary

1577
02:18:19,167 --> 02:18:24,167
This is love. It has no border

1578
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:33,792
Cry in as many ways as you want

1579
02:18:33,833 --> 02:18:38,000
He listens... Cry hard

1580
02:18:38,042 --> 02:18:41,209
He listens... Cry hard [echo]

1581
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:47,958
The conversation that was between the hearts

1582
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:55,292
Everything is finished in life

1583
02:18:55,333 --> 02:19:07,125
There is no evil found in love

1584
02:19:07,167 --> 02:19:10,875
You have taken my body but couldn't take my heart

1585
02:19:10,917 --> 02:19:33,209
My heart [echo]

1586
02:20:07,917 --> 02:20:09,584
Just let go moosa sahab

1587
02:20:34,083 --> 02:20:37,583
We will protect our women and our homes.

1588
02:20:42,458 --> 02:20:44,375
We will progress

1589
02:20:45,417 --> 02:20:50,792
But our women will remain protected inside the four walls

1590
02:20:57,167 --> 02:21:01,834
We will never abandon the traditions and customs of our
forefathers

1591
02:21:01,875 --> 02:21:07,667
There is a man standing in the 10th row... long hair...
has a beard and is wearing a turban...

1592
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:09,125
Keep an eye on him

1593
02:21:09,167 --> 02:21:11,209
Decency is our beauty. Our language is our identity

1594
02:21:14,458 --> 02:21:20,875
We will remain hungry, but we will never live a single day
shamelessly

1595
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,208
Control..Is the DSP here?

1596
02:21:43,958 --> 02:21:44,916
Yes, sir, he is here

1597
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:49,833
Okay ask him to meet me before going

1598
02:21:50,125 --> 02:21:50,833
Okay sir

1599
02:21:55,625 --> 02:21:59,417
You came with two Pashto speaking women the other day

1600
02:22:00,542 --> 02:22:02,125
What do you know about them?

1601
02:22:03,375 --> 02:22:05,083
They live here, in Neelam Colony

1602
02:22:08,042 --> 02:22:12,250
Whatsoever you know about them...

1603
02:22:12,875 --> 02:22:13,833
any address...

1604
02:22:13,875 --> 02:22:15,833
any phone number... write it down

1605
02:22:33,708 --> 02:22:35,750
Listen, you were there at their home

1606
02:22:36,042 --> 02:22:37,459
You would know them...

1607
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:39,083
This is a very serious matter

1608
02:22:40,042 --> 02:22:42,000
Whatever you know, just tell us exactly

1609
02:22:43,833 --> 02:22:47,416
Sir, I like this girl, sir

1610
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:50,167
But she has disappeared

1611
02:22:51,083 --> 02:22:52,458
This is all I know

1612
02:22:55,583 --> 02:22:56,875
Where did you meet her?

1613
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:01,250
Sir, I work on the security of UN,

1614
02:23:01,792 --> 02:23:05,125
I found her at their branch there..

1615
02:23:07,375 --> 02:23:08,208
Men?...

1616
02:23:10,792 --> 02:23:12,459
I mean how many men are there in the house?

1617
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,292
Father...

1618
02:23:13,333 --> 02:23:14,041
brother...

1619
02:23:14,083 --> 02:23:14,833
husband?

1620
02:23:15,833 --> 02:23:17,500
Sir, only an old father, sir

1621
02:23:22,083 --> 02:23:23,583
Sir, is she okay?

1622
02:23:28,625 --> 02:23:30,208
I donâ€™t know that exactly..

1623
02:23:46,958 --> 02:23:48,833
Okay,, Let Mr. Musa come through

1624
02:24:14,583 --> 02:24:15,958
Sir, Musa speaking

1625
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,042
My car has been stolen and I am here at the police station.

1626
02:24:18,083 --> 02:24:18,750
I will be coming in a while

1627
02:24:18,792 --> 02:24:19,292
Musa?!?

1628
02:24:32,583 --> 02:24:33,708
What is this nonsense?

1629
02:24:34,625 --> 02:24:35,292
Who are you?

1630
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:37,542
I am are your death

1631
02:24:38,833 --> 02:24:40,250
I think there is a misunderstanding.

1632
02:24:41,417 --> 02:24:42,250
Whatâ€™s wrong?

1633
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:44,042
I donâ€™t even know you

1634
02:24:47,083 --> 02:24:49,666
When You mistreated that poor girl..

1635
02:24:50,667 --> 02:24:52,625
Werenâ€™t you afraid of death then?

1636
02:24:52,667 --> 02:24:54,292
What are you saying?

1637
02:24:54,333 --> 02:24:56,083
Bro, I have always done good for the citizens

1638
02:24:56,125 --> 02:24:57,167
At least move this aside

1639
02:24:57,208 --> 02:24:58,291
Sit, we can talk about this

1640
02:24:58,333 --> 02:24:59,125
It must be a misunderstanding

1641
02:24:59,167 --> 02:24:59,875
Come sit

1642
02:25:02,917 --> 02:25:04,334
Now you are so afraid of death

1643
02:25:05,917 --> 02:25:06,750
Good bye

1644
02:25:09,833 --> 02:25:10,666
Ahh...

1645
02:25:14,667 --> 02:25:15,625
Son of a *****

1646
02:25:20,542 --> 02:25:24,000
You bastard. You sister was with the Chief Minister

1647
02:25:24,042 --> 02:25:25,792
You should be happy about this..

1648
02:25:26,333 --> 02:25:28,208
Now you die like a dog

1649
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:30,333
Respectable my foot

1650
02:25:35,417 --> 02:25:36,625

1658
02:27:05,667 --> 02:27:07,500
He wanted to return to his own village

1659
02:27:11,375 --> 02:27:13,458

02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:42,667
Greetings

02:29:45,417 --> 02:29:46,125
Stay happy

1703
02:29:54,667 --> 02:29:58,542
I was left alone with my little children, when my husband passed
away

1704
02:29:58,583 --> 02:30:00,583
It was my husbandâ€™s home

1705
02:30:00,625 --> 02:30:03,375
I have worked hard as a widow

1706
02:30:03,417 --> 02:30:04,375
Gave my Children good education

1707
02:30:04,417 --> 02:30:06,042
sometime ago

1708
02:30:06,292 --> 02:30:10,250
Some people started buying the area

1709
02:30:10,292 --> 02:30:12,667
They told us that they will build a plaza here

1710
02:30:13,208 --> 02:30:16,583
I didnâ€™t want to sell

1711
02:30:17,125 --> 02:30:18,708
When I questioned them

1712
02:30:19,042 --> 02:30:21,000
They beat up my sons badly

1713
02:30:21,042 --> 02:30:22,292
They threatened us

1714
02:30:22,333 --> 02:30:23,708
And I was so scared

1715
02:30:23,750 --> 02:30:26,875
I was kicked out of my own house

1716
02:30:28,208 --> 02:30:29,958
I went to the police

1717
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
but nothing happened

1718
02:30:32,917 --> 02:30:35,834
I didnâ€™t have the money to go to the court

1719
02:30:36,292 --> 02:30:38,584
I went to the media..

1720
02:30:38,917 --> 02:30:41,750
They kidnapped my son

1721
02:30:41,792 --> 02:30:44,250
Sir, itâ€™s been fifteen days

1722
02:30:44,292 --> 02:30:46,792
I haven't seen my son

1723
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,833
I want my son, sir
