[Sita and Rama Marriage]

2
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,484
42...

3
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,936
44...
- What is this?

4
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:36,737
I told you to study during exams.

5
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,349
But you were going around temples.

6
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,994
Now that the results are expected,
are you going around Basil plant?

7
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,362
45...

8
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:45,185
Are you her umpire?
- Calculator.

9
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,532
Shit!

10
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:50,726
Hey! Will you not speak?

11
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:53,599
Hello! She will not speak
till the results are declared.

12
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,631
Why?
- Today is mute day!

13
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,555
Don't you know 'mute'? Full silence.

14
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,664
She has vowed to remain
silent the whole day.

15
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:00,892
Is it?!
- Yes.

16
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:05,034
Your English is horrible!

17
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,609
She can't speak in English.

18
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,832
That is why her stomach
is burning with jealousy.

19
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:09,859
Acidity!

20
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,139
Hey! Come here.

21
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,793
No use of telling you.

22
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:17,133
It is because of your father
who supports whatever you do.

23
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,975
Where is he?

24
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,854
Dear Daughter!

25
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,519
Do not worry. I have prayed to God.

26
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,505
You will surely pass in 1st class.

27
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,194
Her passing the exam is doubtful.
But you say she will get 1st class!

28
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,614
Father and daughter
behave the same way.

29
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:38,225
O My Son!
- Mom.

30
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,978
Put some more camphor.
She will get more marks.

31
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:43,324
Oh! Definitely. Definitely.

32
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:44,497
Take blessings.

33
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:49,695
Are you all joking?
I have never seen her studying.

34
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,336
How will she Pass?

35
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,993
In the same way she passed
all these years. - Yes.

36
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,183
Let me see.

37
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,807
What about result?

38
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,268
It was announced two hours back.

39
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,422
I am asking about
my daughter's result.

40
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:04,685
As recommended by you, I have
cleared her result in 1st Class.

41
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,021
My dear Daughter!
You have passed in 1st class.

42
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,024
Really!

43
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,404
How is it possible?

44
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,317
We always win.

45
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,291
I know it is Match-fixing.

46
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:23,339
Look! Your father
is there to help you now.

47
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:27,721
But some day a man will
come to teach you a lesson.

48
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,441
Then you will realize.

49
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:32,141
Father! Did you hear her?

50
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:35,007
My father will get a husband for me.

51
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:40,415
I will watch whether he
will pamper you or discipline you.

52
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,220
Father! Do I need a Mother?!

53
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:47,164
Don't you want?

54
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,597
If you agree, shall I search a new
Mother from the matrimonial column?

55
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:52,785
Of course. You may search.

56
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:57,699
I am also fed up of seeing
the same face all these years.

57
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,946
Hello! Do you think
you deserve a 2nd marriage?

58
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,742
Are you trying to get
a 2nd wife for my husband?

59
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,769
Give the stick.

60
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,092
I will surely get...

61
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,241
Give the stick.
- Run...

62
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,283
Brother! Stop fighting. It is time
to go for marriage. We are late.

63
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,134
Brother-in-law has come.
- Finally he has arrived.

64
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,699
Greetings!
- Greetings!

65
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,249
Brother!
Sister-in-law! Are you fine?

66
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:29,895
Yes. We are fine.

67
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,466
The marriage hall is
bubbling after your arrival.

68
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,970
I will attend only
the main function.

69
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,715
You and your sister can
look after the other things.

70
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,269
Please come.
- Welcome.

71
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,940
The arrangements are excellent!

72
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,141
Not bad...

73
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:54,545
Oh! English Grandma!
So Nice to see you. Namaste!

74
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,253
OMG!

75
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,056
It is very difficult to manage Sari.

76
00:05:58,136 --> 00:05:59,841
Do not get so exit!

77
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,382
It is 'excite'.
- I know.

78
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:05,808
Your Sari falls every few
seconds like a traffic signal.

79
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,595
How? You first pin it up.

80
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,733
Sorry! I forgot.

81
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,708
Naughty Grandma! I feel so shy.

82
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,272
Instead of wearing Sari
properly she is covering her face.

83
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,541
Stupid girl!
- Grandma! Have juice.

84
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:21,500
I will serve juice. You go.

85
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,308
Take. Mother! Have juice.

86
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,443
Thanks. You may go.

87
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,289
By the by... Where is our enemy?

88
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,154
Yes... Where is our enemy?

89
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:32,102
She has come.

90
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,884
Look there!

91
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,412
Pumpkin!

92
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,130
Hey bride! How are you?

93
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,656
I am fine.
I think you will also be fine.

94
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,770
She also seems fine.

95
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:48,291
I heard some news.

96
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:51,149
Oh! Wind news?!
- No. Air news.

97
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,166
Proceed.

98
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,533
Heard she has passed
in 1st class this time also.

99
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:55,702
Yes.

100
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,583
Just as Kohli hits
century every time

101
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,199
I also get 1st class every time.

102
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,569
I am always a topper.

103
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,108
You are just lucky!

104
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,766
Stomach burning?

105
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,804
It is because she
scores only pass marks!

106
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:14,433
I may be an average student.
But my selection is top class.

107
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:18,597
My husband is foreign-returned.
He is like a Prince. Understand?

108
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,260
That is why my father is celebrating
the marriage in a grand scale.

109
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,010
Isn't it?
- Of course.

110
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,940
Do not be proud.

111
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:28,774
I will select an excellent
husband for my grand-daughter.

112
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,660
Her husband will
arrive in grand style.

113
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,306
He will make the celestial
being blow the trumpet.

114
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,966
Send message through the clouds.

115
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:43,976
He will come like a shining star.

116
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,628
Will arrive with rage like wind.

117
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:13,813
Please tell him not to hit us.

118
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:16,887
We will never spoil your land again.
Forgive us.

119
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,403
Please forgive.

120
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,058
Kethaka.

121
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,364
We will never hit you.
Please spare us.

122
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,260
Okay.

123
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,744
We will not spoil your land.
We were wrong.

124
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:36,169
Instead of asking for forgiveness,
mend the farm.

125
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:39,851
We should do our work.

126
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,264
Get the spade.
- You are right.

127
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,449
Which is your native?

128
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,601
Bengaluru.

129
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:55,243
Though city bred, you are
doing farming work better than us.

130
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:59,388
A tree may grow very tall but
its roots are fixed to the ground.

131
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:03,153
In the same way,
wherever we go, our genesis is here.

132
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:06,476
I learnt to love land
from my grandfather.

133
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,548
Learnt to love
people from my father.

134
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:13,942
And learnt to do work
perfectly from elders like you.

135
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,679
You speak well.
Thank you for helping us.

136
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,926
This world is full
of selfish people.

137
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:27,071
But Farmers like you,
work hard for others.

138
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,821
You should fold hands
only for Mother Earth.

139
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:32,891
Just bless me wholeheartedly.

140
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,360
May God Bless you!
- May you lead a good life!

141
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,976
May God bless you!

142
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,939
The groom has arrived!
Play music.

143
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:55,788
Wow!

144
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,094
Namaste!
- Hi!

145
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,710
You drive very well!

146
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:15,291
You also look handsome.
- Thank you.

147
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,965
I like your attitude.

148
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,117
The groom is good looking. Isn't it?

149
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:49,422
Hello!

150
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:55,338
Hey Arya!

151
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:57,705
Hi Uncle! Hi Aunt!
- Hi!

152
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,131
Why have you come alone?

153
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,133
Where is the groom?

154
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,178
He is here...

155
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,638
Oh! There...

156
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:17,043
Look at my husband.
He is like a Prince.

157
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,841
Are you showing
off before your bride?

158
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:28,565
I fell down on the way.
But You left me.

159
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,061
I was shouting at you to stop.
But you came without caring.

160
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:32,227
I got hurt.

161
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:35,055
Father-in-law! A stone
hit me when I fell down. Look!

162
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:38,468
Uncle! At least you
see if I am bleeding.

163
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:40,688
I have a sensitive skin.

164
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,350
I hate you.
- Hey get up.

165
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,273
Stupid! He is shameless.

166
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,815
Mummy!

167
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,032
Son-in-law!
Please come inside.

168
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,767
Send Nayana to apply medicine.

169
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,842
You will be fine if you
take bath in hot water. Come.

170
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,324
It is a new one!

171
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:00,310
Hi! What is the matter?

172
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,478
Didn't get Tea or
Coffee since morning.

173
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:03,972
I did not ask you.

174
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,317
Understood. Continue.

175
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,161
You must have heard the name Arya.

176
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:10,011
Many girls have tattooed this
name on their body. - Oh!

177
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,943
Yes. Your name?

178
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,227
Spicy dish made with pulses!

179
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,635
Oh! Are you a vegetarian?

180
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,270
Only my name is such.

181
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,563
But if you interfere in my
affairs, I can punch you.

182
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:22,902
Brother! I love it.

183
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:26,490
I heard you saying something
about me. That I am very...

184
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,055
Bad looking.

185
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,897
Did you hear her words? Village
girls cannot be enticed so soon.

186
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,132
I can do it.

187
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,083
Okay sir.

188
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,537
Hey Small Robot!

189
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,131
She is wearing torn cloth.
Still she is good looking.

190
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,012
Isn't it so?

191
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,907
Guests are waiting.
Go and serve Coffee.

192
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,136
Okay. Go.
- You go.

193
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,901
I thought you were enjoying
her cuddle. But you got a shock.

194
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:20,459
How was it?
- Madam!

195
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:23,067
Oh No! Let us go.

196
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,202
She may come.

197
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:28,904
If we marry a handsome guy,
all girls will try to woo him.

198
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,478
And we should do spy work.

199
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:33,950
But if we marry
an average looking guy

200
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,573
he will woo us and
follow us everywhere.

201
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:38,163
See there! Your Man is
following some other girl.

202
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:43,557
See there! Your Man is
following some other girl.

203
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,549
Some girls are like Pop song. We
forget it immediately after hearing.

204
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,940
Few other girls are like rap song.
People forget it while hearing.

205
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,577
But you are like a melodious song
which people want to hear always.

206
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,991
You are always in memory.
Is it?!

207
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,706
He is a womanizer!

208
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:05,013
Give a stick.

209
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:07,825
Boss! Did I tell
the dialogue properly?

210
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:12,222
Turn the other side.
Hear what I say.

211
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,349
Why are you following me?

212
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,858
You did not tell your name.

213
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,180
Tell your name.

214
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,100
Why should I tell?

215
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,043
Give me a stick. I want to hit him.

216
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:27,588
She says she will not say.

217
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,911
Shut up. Ask her again.

218
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:31,136
Calm down.

219
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,200
Please tell your name.

220
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,158
No.

221
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,179
Shameless fellow! She doesn't
want to tell. Still he is after her.

222
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,332
Say that you will not
marry if she doesn't tell.

223
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:43,827
Tell.

224
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:46,743
If you do not tell your name now,
I will not marry.

225
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:53,162
He is a flirt!
I cannot bear to see this.

226
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,415
Take me. Please take me from here.

227
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:05,781
I am not bothered
whether you marry or not.

228
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,066
Get lost.

229
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,554
Hey!
- She cursed me.

230
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:10,949
Bro! Bro!

231
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:15,276
I am confused. Why should
I interfere in your affairs?

232
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:16,860
You can speak to her.

233
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:21,499
Nobody will mistake if you
ask because you are the groom.

234
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,381
But people will mistake me if I ask.

235
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:24,663
I am right. Isn't it?

236
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,143
If Nayana knows that I am
helping you, she will appreciate me.

237
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:29,587
Correct.

238
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,837
Show that color...

239
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:33,583
That one...

240
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:34,966
It is nice. Isn't it?

241
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,678
It is very nice, Geetha.

242
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,659
It is not nice. I do not want it.
- Of course It is nice.

243
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:19,094
Hey Geetha!

244
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,746
You wanted to see the village. Come.

245
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:27,668
Okay. Let us go. Things
are not working out properly here.

246
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:28,811
Let us go.

247
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:33,584
Let us go to the mountain peak.
- Stop!

248
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,100
What is the matter?

249
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,767
Who is the groom? You or Me?!

250
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:37,563
Of Course You.

251
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,307
Who should be the
centre of attraction?

252
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:40,668
You...

253
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,904
But if you go round with your biceps

254
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:44,485
everyone will look at you only.

255
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,459
Who will see me?

256
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,186
I will lose my attention, You know.

257
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,850
Attention gets value
only if there is competition.

258
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,551
I mean... You are also good looking.
You have a great physique.

259
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,307
Really!
- Yes.

260
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:58,922
Use them. Show your biceps.
Show you sexy thighs.

261
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,667
I feel shy.

262
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,836
No need to feel shy.

263
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:06,079
Try to understand.
Attention seeking is important.

264
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,037
Is it?

265
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,153
Come here.

266
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,553
If you show off your
strength before marriage

267
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,255
your wife will be under
your control afterwards.

268
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,604
Isn't it?
- Yes.

269
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,388
You have made me realize.
Wait and watch.

270
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:18,319
I will go around in underwear
the whole of this place.

271
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,471
Is it?
- Yes.

272
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:20,622
Turn right.

273
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,200
What are you looking at?

274
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:23,581
Fool.

275
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,084
Thighs...
- Thanks.

276
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,750
It is great. Let us go.
- Nonsense.

277
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:28,349
Sexy thighs!

278
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:32,395
Look at my thighs.

279
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:34,314
I did it.

280
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,510
I have got six packs chest.

281
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,145
Stupid! Why are
you roaming like this?

282
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,791
It is the trend now.
- Trend? - Yes.

283
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:45,042
Fool! Go and wear proper clothes.

284
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:46,041
Generation gap.

285
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:48,613
You will not understand
the pulse of youth like us.

286
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:49,955
Old models.

287
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:52,910
Ouch! Oh Sorry.

288
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,149
It is okay. No problem.

289
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,152
Wow!

290
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:57,443
Do you like it?
- Yes, Of Course.

291
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:58,897
Can I touch it?

292
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,070
Please...

293
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,099
Cool...
- This side...

294
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,342
Amazing. How did you get it?

295
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:07,945
Daily 200 Push-ups and 100 biceps.

296
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:09,798
Now I am going for
my thighs work out.

297
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,186
So nice!

298
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,337
My thighs!

299
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:13,826
You naughty!

300
00:20:13,906 --> 00:20:15,800
Can I meet you later?
- Why?

301
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,942
To do exercise.
- Okay.

302
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,100
Naughty.

303
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,672
Hey Baby! Let us do Push-ups.

304
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:28,783
Is it?
- Yes.

305
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:32,907
I will teach you Karate
and Kung Fu later. - Okay.

306
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,745
You flirt! Come.

307
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,063
Flirt!

308
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,138
What did I do?

309
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,926
I came to show you our village.

310
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,660
But you have driven so far.

311
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,087
Stop!

312
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,291
My grandfather...!

313
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,052
See there.

314
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:17,911
Ranganna! Ranganna!

315
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,648
Ranganna!

316
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:23,827
Grandpa! Grandpa!

317
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,042
Why did you do look this?

318
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:28,288
Ranganna is a farmer.

319
00:21:29,594 --> 00:21:30,490
So what?

320
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,988
A farmer ends up dying.

321
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:35,639
Death!

322
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:38,321
What do you mean?

323
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,084
We take loans for doing agriculture.

324
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,167
But no rains since
3 years and so no Produce.

325
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,010
Banks send us notice repeatedly.

326
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:49,590
Unable to bear the insult,
every farmer takes this decision.

327
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:53,382
Death is not the end to everything.

328
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,098
Do not cry, My child.

329
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:57,456
I have some money.

330
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:00,451
Keep this.

331
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,286
I will repay your loan.

332
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:05,812
I do not want.

333
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,611
Do not hesitate.

334
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,057
You will clear the debt this year.

335
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,530
But what about next year.

336
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:17,281
If there are no rains,
we will be left to the same fate.

337
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:23,969
What is the remedy to this?

338
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,108
Water.

339
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:31,974
Our difficulties will
be solved only on the day

340
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:35,568
when we get water without
having to depend on rains.

341
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,208
If we get water properly, we can
produce food grains twice a year.

342
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,437
Then nobody has to
give loan to a farmer.

343
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:48,566
Farmer will earn and clear
the debt of this country.

344
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:56,409
Lift him.

345
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,457
Please come, Sir.

346
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,852
Sir! Your time was good.
He came and rescued you.

347
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:09,262
Please take.

348
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:11,061
See you.

349
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,286
Madam!

350
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:35,061
Don't scream. They are seeing you
secretly while you are wearing sari.

351
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,772
You should close
the door and wear sari.

352
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:37,938
He is right.

353
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:40,741
How can she complain when
she is dressing up with doors open?

354
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:41,704
Yes.

355
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:44,477
Shameless fellows!
How dare you teach me morality?

356
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:46,880
Get lost. Get lost.

357
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:48,086
O God!
- Idiots.

358
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,125
Did they see everything?

359
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,730
Of Course.

360
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,092
You?
- I did not see anything.

361
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,402
Then come later.

362
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:57,765
Later? Why?

363
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:00,928
Naughty fellow!
Look how he is staring.

364
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:03,826
Staring?!

365
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,782
Baby! Did I woo her?

366
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:10,758
Come later. Let us go.

367
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:12,783
She is also telling
me to come later.

368
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,111
It is confusing.

369
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:16,793
Nobody told the time.

370
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,506
Brother!
- Yes.

371
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,450
Calling you for taking food.
- Coming.

372
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:33,329
She looks so beautiful in
this photo. Isn't it? - Yes.

373
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:36,097
Geetha! When was this photo taken?

374
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,054
This is also nice.

375
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:41,975
When was this photo taken?

376
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:54,013
Hey!

377
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:04,822
Is it alright?

378
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,310
It is difficult
to overtake this lady.

379
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,032
Madam!
- Get lost.

380
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,243
You are old and fat. Hey Fatty!

381
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:15,320
What did you say?
- Hey Fatty! - Go away.

382
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,689
He is calling me fat.

383
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,289
Geeta! Eat this.

384
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:20,672
For me?

385
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,281
I will give you also. Eat.

386
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:32,745
I am sorry.

387
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:35,272
Get lost.

388
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:38,466
You...!

389
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:02,957
Hey!

390
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:07,149
He is always looking at my mole.

391
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,097
He looked at my mole thrice.

392
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,640
Tit for tat.

393
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,509
What do you mean?

394
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,495
Shall we see him secretly
when he is bathing?

395
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,567
Shut up. Don't you feel ashamed?

396
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,685
The boy is handsome.
That is why I said.

397
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:22,868
What shall we do then?

398
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:25,257
We have to use our
boys to teach him a lesson.

399
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:27,191
We want Thousand rupees.

400
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,386
Okay.

401
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,104
Who is the target?
- Arya.

402
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,809
Not possible.
- Why?

403
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:35,096
If we fight with him,
he will kill us.

404
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:37,039
Okay then.
I will give Five thousand rupees.

405
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,683
Five thousand rupees!

406
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,756
I am reminded of my
lost sister when I see you.

407
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,705
I will do the job even
at the cost of my life.

408
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,190
This is a brother's promise.

409
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,031
You also promise.
- Your younger brother's promise!

410
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,045
Are you sleeping here? Wait.

411
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:06,923
Why have you come now?

412
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:09,210
I cannot sleep in my room.

413
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,847
Shall I sleep next to you?

414
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:12,609
No. I will not sleep next to you.

415
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:14,872
You will put your legs on me.

416
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,940
You sleep here.
I will sleep in your room.

417
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,082
Thanks.

418
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:24,553
Sleep next to me.
- Shut up and lie down.

419
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,925
He is the one. He has
covered his face with blanket.

420
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,406
You go.

421
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:40,435
Hey!
- Lie down.

422
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,031
Come. Let us run.

423
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:47,386
Someone is hitting me.

424
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,237
I am scared. I will go to my room.

425
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,539
What happened?
- Success.

426
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,582
We have thrashed him.

427
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,175
Did you beat him properly?

428
00:27:58,255 --> 00:27:59,362
We beat him black and blue.

429
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:01,196
Give me a high five!

430
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,673
Hey! What are you doing?

431
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,586
That...
- I want silence.

432
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:16,535
Very good.

433
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,072
Why did I get scared of him?

434
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:21,538
I think these boys did not beat him.

435
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,120
Stop it.

436
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,603
Can't you do a work properly?

437
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,348
Is it a Government
job to do with care?

438
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:31,401
You asked us to beat a person.
- You!

439
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,423
It is not our problem.
- Then whose?

440
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:34,938
Navigation.

441
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,112
Navigation?!
- Yes.

442
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:37,903
She mistook the person
to be someone else.

443
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,498
Who did you show to them?
- Who did you show to them?

444
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:44,115
I showed the right person.

445
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:47,261
Okay. You should not miss this time.

446
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,279
Should not miss this time.

447
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,170
Should not miss.

448
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,417
Are you here?

449
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,382
Bro!

450
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,510
Bro!

451
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:13,847
Why did you come back here?

452
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:16,221
Move aside. I will also sleep here.

453
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:17,792
I am scared to sleep there alone.
- Get out.

454
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:20,876
Please...

455
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,956
Okay. You sleep.

456
00:29:23,189 --> 00:29:24,423
Do not come searching for me again.

457
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:25,348
Okay.

458
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,450
Sleep.

459
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,738
You also sleep here.
Okay. I will sleep alone.

460
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:33,416
He should not come to me again.

461
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,630
He is sleeping there.
- Okay. Go.

462
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,486
Hey! Who is that?

463
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,209
Come directly and hit me.

464
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,658
I will cry if I get angry.

465
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:57,940
He will not get up again.

466
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,793
What happened?

467
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:00,398
We have flogged him.

468
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:02,524
He cannot get up.

469
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:04,667
Come here.

470
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:06,964
For me?

471
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:10,910
Will you not give me?

472
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:12,604
Oh! Why did you slap me?

473
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:15,157
He is roaming around.

474
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:19,232
Are you lying?

475
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:22,398
You have to beat him
in front of me. Go now.

476
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,583
Quiet.
- Careful.

477
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:29,665
Quiet.

478
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,727
Run!

479
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:43,773
He looks so strong!

480
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:46,319
What are you doing here?

481
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:51,008
Security...
- We are guarding the place.

482
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:52,165
Inside the house?!

483
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,463
Special duty.
- Even for me.

484
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,984
I suspect these two.

485
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,005
Why do you suspect us?

486
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,395
We promise. Special duty for us.

487
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:00,801
Yes. For me also.

488
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,044
Give that.

489
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,742
Turn right.
- That...

490
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:05,910
Walk.

491
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:09,054
Special duty?

492
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:22,297
Where did you learn this?

493
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:23,698
Is it nice?
- Super.

494
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,549
Geetha!
- Yes.

495
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:28,021
Come fast.

496
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,645
Come and sit.
- What Grandma?

497
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,422
Look! He has drawn
beautiful designs.

498
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:33,518
You also get it done.

499
00:31:33,598 --> 00:31:35,090
I don't want.
- Sit. Get it done.

500
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,118
You draw.

501
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,117
Why is he not seeing?

502
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,025
Can't he see it?

503
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,558
Is he acting?

504
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,128
Someone stop the fan.
It is disturbing me.

505
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,447
Sorry. Please...

506
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:04,103
I was scared that this
day will surely come.

507
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,577
Still I cannot bear this.

508
00:37:09,913 --> 00:37:11,221
Hello!

509
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:13,607
Uncle! What is this?

510
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,738
You celebrated the marriage happily.

511
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:18,485
But crying like a small child now.

512
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:21,855
She grew up in my heart.

513
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,356
But now she is going to
live in somebody else's house.

514
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,158
Will I not feel the pain?

515
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:32,866
Why Sir? Hasn't Aunt left
her mother's house and come?

516
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:34,855
Hasn't your Mother
left her maternal house?

517
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:39,935
This relationship
cannot be forgotten.

518
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,569
She is just going out of your house.

519
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:45,963
Not from your heart.

520
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:52,019
While going to husband's house

521
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,130
every girl will have
some unknown fear.

522
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:59,444
Parents should overcome
her fear and give her strength.

523
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,256
Bless her that she should
get the same happiness that

524
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:05,180
she got in her maternal
house at her in-law's place also.

525
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:09,181
A girl's strength lies
in her endurance to face things.

526
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:10,661
Explain that to her.

527
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,776
Your words are blessings to her.

528
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,242
Your laughter is her strength.

529
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,410
Go and live happily.

530
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,033
Superb.

531
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,138
You spoke so well.

532
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:37,652
Though you are younger to us,
you spoke better than us.

533
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:42,129
A marriage hall is like
a place of mourning at this time.

534
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:47,027
But you taught us the responsibility
of parents at this time.

535
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:52,134
I am proud of your parents who
have brought you up with culture.

536
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:55,714
Which place do you belong to?

537
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:56,675
Bengaluru.

538
00:38:58,991 --> 00:38:59,916
My visiting card.

539
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:04,353
Oh! N.K. Constructions.
I have heard about it.

540
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,452
May God bless you!

541
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:39,990
Sir! Boss started drinking
more after you left for Village.

542
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:44,733
Aarya!

543
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:47,909
You never drink.
Why are you drinking now?

544
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,459
Dad! I gave you permission
to drink just one peg.

545
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:53,949
I told you to have a light drink.
But you are drinking too much.

546
00:39:55,692 --> 00:40:02,213
I was upset that you are not here.
So I drank more.

547
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,315
Okay... I have stopped.

548
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:12,671
I love you.

549
00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,186
I love you, My son.

550
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:29,368
I have no one other than you.

551
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,330
Even I do not have
anyone other than you.

552
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,875
Stop this drama. I have arrived.
Why do you need this now?

553
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,491
Okay. Don't want.

554
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,919
Let us go to sleep.

555
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,153
Come.

556
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:11,021
Good Morning.
- Good Morning, Sir.

557
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:14,308
So...Let's begin the day.

558
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:18,643
Sir! Government has called
for tender for Airport and Highway.

559
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,423
Among these two projects,
I think Airport is a better project.

560
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,914
No... No...
I think Highway is a better option.

561
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,979
Because we have experience in that.

562
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,399
Why don't we take it as a challenge?

563
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,615
Our Company profile
will become bigger

564
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,296
if we take up the Airport project

565
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:34,629
But we will get more
profit in Highway.

566
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,418
You don't know the
profit in Airport.

567
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:39,031
Exactly. I support Airport project.

568
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,687
I do Sir.
- Even I.

569
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:43,464
I will still suggest
for Highway, Sir.

570
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:45,230
Me too...
- Me too...

571
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:49,382
Sir!

572
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,910
Decision is yours.
Please take a call.

573
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:07,039
Good Morning Sir!
- Good Morning.

574
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:08,616
Good Morning.

575
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:12,522
Thank you. - We are discussing
whether to take up Airport

576
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:15,072
or Highway project.

577
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:16,301
What is your choice?

578
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:30,111
Dam.

579
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:32,431
Yes Sir. But...

580
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:33,627
Why Dam?

581
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:39,544
Karnataka already has KRS,
Tungabhadra, Linganamakki...

582
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,063
Yes. Almatti,
Harangi, Hemavathi, Kodasalli.

583
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,706
Vanivilas, Shanthisagara,
Basavasagara Renukasagara...

584
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:49,498
Haridra, Rajalakshmana Gowda,
Kandwa, Kadra, Bhadra, Supa...

585
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,498
Totally there are 17 major dams.

586
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:59,470
But I have a proposal to Government
to give this dam to plain region.

587
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,265
But why?
- Life savior.

588
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,063
Life savior! For whom?

589
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:05,914
Farmers.

590
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:07,929
But why?

591
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:09,647
When we talk of great inventors

592
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:12,483
we speak about those who
invented aircraft, electricity etc.

593
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:15,900
But according to me, great inventors

594
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,645
are the farmers
who grow food grains.

595
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,286
Farmer is the first Scientist.

596
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:24,520
Without food,
there will be no invention.

597
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:30,132
But our Company will
not get any profit from this.

598
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:33,172
Of course we are doing business
and money making is our intention.

599
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:36,359
We cannot expect to get profit
from every business that we do.

600
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:40,588
Every person who eats food
is indebted to its supplier.

601
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:44,463
If he commits suicide because
of difficulties, we all will die.

602
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,432
Now their situation
is very precarious.

603
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:51,784
Because of the dam
we are going to construct

604
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:54,281
the lives of millions of farmers,
who depend on rain water

605
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:56,884
to grow even one produce,
will change.

606
00:43:58,112 --> 00:44:00,984
Their land will get
water throughout the year.

607
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:02,822
If there is water,
there will be produce.

608
00:44:03,105 --> 00:44:04,588
If there is good produce
there will be farmers.

609
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:07,085
If farmers are there,
Country will also thrive.

610
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,998
And I have all the required
documents for that.

611
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:40,211
Hello!

612
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,623
Government has given
permission to build dam

613
00:44:42,703 --> 00:44:44,791
in the place where we had made

614
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:48,216
a deal with Malaysian Company
to build a Chemical factory.

615
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:54,966
If I try to stall it using my power,
media will create controversy.

616
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:56,430
So

617
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:59,004
you handle it.

618
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:00,742
Okay Boss.

619
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:15,975
The project is blocked.
It has to be completed...

620
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:43,554
This is my visiting card.

621
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:50,628
Instead of constructing
roads and relaxing in AC room

622
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,186
do you want to construct dam

623
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:53,803
and improve the lives
of farmers in the place

624
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:58,695
where we have planned
to build a Chemical factory?

625
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,682
I lack both decency and patience.

626
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:05,235
If you oppose me

627
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,253
I will not send you to
Doctor with minor injuries.

628
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,911
I will send you direct

629
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:14,865
to God.

630
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:20,712
I think you are scared.

631
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,093
Take care.

632
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:13,724
Who are you?

633
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:15,994
My father's visiting card!

634
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:05,799
A useless fellow like you warned
a King sitting in his Assembly.

635
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,247
Still he was sitting quiet.

636
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,450
You should have understood then that
the King has the support of a Prince.

637
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,398
If your father a Hero?

638
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:48,658
Father is the Hero for every son.

639
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:52,146
And son is the Hero
for every father.

640
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:24,911
I think you are very scared.
Take care.

641
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:34,878
I will break your limbs
if you do not listen to me.

642
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:37,598
I will not stay here.

643
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,803
I am not like your Father
to listen to whatever you say.

644
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:43,922
Henceforth you should study in
Bengaluru and stay in this hostel.

645
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:45,551
Father!

646
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:46,577
Lakshmi!

647
00:49:46,657 --> 00:49:48,193
What does she lack here?

648
00:49:49,388 --> 00:49:52,875
This girl is studying in this hostel
since 2 years leaving her parents.

649
00:49:54,398 --> 00:50:00,726
Look! If you come home without
any reason, I will break your leg.

650
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:06,668
Let us stay in Bengaluru for
a few days till she gets adjusted.

651
00:50:07,224 --> 00:50:08,641
You first come out of this place.

652
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:10,811
You have pampered her a lot.

653
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:13,971
No...
- Mother!

654
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:17,325
Mother! Come.

655
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:23,014
I will also come.

656
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,591
Hello!

657
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,451
Hello...

658
00:50:57,665 --> 00:50:58,516
Who is that?

659
00:50:59,194 --> 00:51:00,156
Silence.

660
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:10,728
What happened?

661
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:16,606
I am not getting adjusted
to this City, Hostel or College.

662
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:19,152
I feel like going back to my native.

663
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:22,999
Initially even I was feeling so. You
will get used to it in due course.

664
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:24,503
Come to sleep.

665
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:26,629
You go. I will come later.

666
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:28,120
Okay.

667
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:37,423
What are you thinking about?

668
00:51:37,832 --> 00:51:40,597
I was thinking about
the dam project.

669
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,794
Stop pondering over it.
Enjoy your life.

670
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,180
It is party time, Man.

671
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,910
I feel I have enjoyed a lot in life.

672
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,865
Don't you think it
is time to get serious?

673
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:54,459
Forget it.

674
00:51:55,105 --> 00:51:58,562
You had been to a marriage.

675
00:51:58,732 --> 00:51:59,937
Tell me about it.
- Hey!

676
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,132
Dad!
- Come here.

677
00:52:02,658 --> 00:52:04,291
Did you like any girl there?

678
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,554
I will tell at the appropriate time.

679
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:08,779
At the right time?
- Yes.

680
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:13,966
Even I spent my whole life working.

681
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:18,764
I do not remember
how I spent your age.

682
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:21,893
I am not upset about it.

683
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,708
Because I knew that my son

684
00:52:26,788 --> 00:52:30,341
will live the life which I missed.

685
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:35,134
You should feel that
you enjoyed your life.

686
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:40,268
Now you enjoy the
life which I missed.

687
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:46,038
Every Father advises his
son to study and work hard.

688
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:50,278
But you are telling
me to enjoy life.

689
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,561
You are the world's best father.

690
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:57,233
You are the world's best son.

691
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:06,490
Hey! Not able to see
you often after your marriage!

692
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,480
Enjoying life?

693
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,054
'My foot!
Only I know my difficulties.'

694
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:11,395
Are you fine?
- Fine. Thank you.

695
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:12,756
Are you fine?

696
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:15,231
He is my God now.
I lead life according to his wish.

697
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:18,640
'God!
- She acts well.'

698
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,903
I need a help from you.

699
00:53:20,983 --> 00:53:23,825
Ask anything you want. I
am prepared to even give up my life.

700
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:26,006
Can you get me Geetha's number?

701
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,202
I am sorry.

702
00:53:27,386 --> 00:53:29,884
Just now you said that you
will give up your life for me!

703
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:31,538
You do not know my wife.

704
00:53:31,618 --> 00:53:33,572
She looks like a female
but acts like a male.

705
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:34,748
What?!

706
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:36,997
I was mentioning
about her character.

707
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:39,019
She is a rowdy. You know...

708
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,364
Do not forget that you are a Man.

709
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:44,230
After marrying her I have
forgotten that I am a male!

710
00:53:44,365 --> 00:53:46,325
Come on! Be a Man.

711
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:48,196
Speak in base voice just once.

712
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:49,181
She will shake with fear.

713
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:50,199
Is it?
- Yes.

714
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:51,970
Try it.
- Okay. I will try.

715
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:54,751
Hey You!

716
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:55,889
What is it?

717
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:58,134
Nothing. You go.

718
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,143
She is eating well
and has become fat!

719
00:54:01,223 --> 00:54:02,407
Nayana!
- What?

720
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:04,051
Give Geetha's number.
- Why?

721
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:06,606
To check her caller tune!
Why are you bothered?

722
00:54:06,686 --> 00:54:08,216
Give.
- Okay. Come in.

723
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,499
My God! She is fully shaken.

724
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:12,914
If I had known before,
I would have spoken

725
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:14,194
in base voice from the beginning.

726
00:54:14,274 --> 00:54:15,130
Shake hands.

727
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:19,342
Is this base voice!

728
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,526
Hey! Give me her number.

729
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:29,040
You were flirting with girls other
than the bride in the marriage.

730
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:30,659
Flirting!

731
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:32,132
What is it?!

732
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:34,705
You stupid fellow!

733
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:36,068
Mummy!

734
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,691
Do you want number?!

735
00:54:38,771 --> 00:54:40,944
Not for me. For brother.

736
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,292
Brother!
- Tell me.

737
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:45,765
Did you ask for any number?

738
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,144
No...

739
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:48,980
Bro!

740
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,885
You...

741
00:54:57,734 --> 00:54:59,732
Did she give?
- Yes.

742
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:01,047
Then give.

743
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:05,182
What happened?

744
00:55:05,262 --> 00:55:06,719
She hit me.

745
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,683
She hit me hard like
they grind banana in a mixer!

746
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:10,928
Don't feel bad.

747
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:13,188
Your wife only hit you.
I will not tell anyone.

748
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,465
Please get the number.

749
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:17,386
She was hitting me only at night.

750
00:55:17,466 --> 00:55:19,450
But now because of you, she
has hit me in the morning. Get lost!

751
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:21,753
Your wife is there!
- Mummy!

752
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:24,968
Please get me the number.
- I cannot get.

753
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:29,426
What shall I do?
Not able to adjust to anything.

754
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,040
Shall I call Aarya?

755
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:43,924
Let me try.

756
00:55:46,015 --> 00:55:47,336
Please get me the number.

757
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:48,686
Not possible. No. I can't.
- Please...

758
00:55:49,295 --> 00:55:50,395
Hello!

759
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:57,149
Get her number.
- Not possible.

760
00:55:58,897 --> 00:55:59,771
Wait a minute...

761
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:09,957
Who is that?

762
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:11,393
Who?

763
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:12,389
You!

764
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:14,834
It is You. Right?

765
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:16,694
Yes. It is Me.

766
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:19,010
It is Me.

767
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,847
Did you think about me?

768
00:56:21,623 --> 00:56:25,056
I need a favor from you.

769
00:56:25,136 --> 00:56:26,850
Okay. Done. No problem.
I will do anything for your sake.

770
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,107
Give me 2 hours time.
I will come to your town.

771
00:56:28,187 --> 00:56:30,769
No need to come to my town.
- Why?

772
00:56:30,976 --> 00:56:32,481
I am now in Bengaluru.

773
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:34,457
Bengaluru!
- Yes.

774
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:42,039
Hi Geetha! What a surprise!

775
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,394
I did not expect you to call me.

776
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:46,368
I thought you would
have forgotten me by now.

777
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:47,961
Thank God! You have my number.

778
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:50,356
I did not expect
that we will meet here.

779
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:52,601
You wanted some help from me.
What is it?

780
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:55,905
Bike?

781
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:57,444
Yes. Bike.

782
00:56:58,889 --> 00:56:59,969
Don't you have Car?

783
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:02,180
Car!
- Yes.

784
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,416
Do you want to go somewhere?
- Yes.

785
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,658
Shall we go on bike?
- No.

786
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:19,020
'She is not talking...'

787
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:22,530
Adjusted to College?
- Yes.

788
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:25,973
Are you staying in your
relative's house? - No.

789
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,659
Are you staying in PG?
- No.

790
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,701
Then you are staying in hostel.
- Yes.

791
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:33,482
Speak something.

792
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,978
If people see me speaking to myself

793
00:57:35,058 --> 00:57:36,725
they will think I
am 'Guldu'(slang word).

794
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:38,927
What does 'Guldu' mean?

795
00:57:41,423 --> 00:57:42,868
You spoke at least now...

796
00:57:42,948 --> 00:57:45,740
Million dollar question.
'Guldu' means Me.

797
00:57:46,437 --> 00:57:47,317
Is it?!

798
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:55,264
Shall we go by auto?

799
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,810
I have seen couples
fondling in auto.

800
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,789
But these two are
maintaining 2 feet gap.

801
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:16,624
Song problem?
Come on! Let us play the music.

802
00:58:19,718 --> 00:58:22,852
'Geetha... Sangeetha...'

803
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,318
What a wonderful song! I love you.

804
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:32,744
Thank you.
I play such love songs to lovers.

805
00:58:32,824 --> 00:58:34,737
Hey! Stop the auto.

806
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:37,598
Stop it I say.
Stop it.

807
00:58:37,678 --> 00:58:39,457
Why?
- Are we lovers?!

808
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:42,273
Don't we look like siblings to you?

809
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:45,404
Why are you speaking
in a wrong sense?

810
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,401
Wrongly?
- Yes.

811
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,812
Stupid.

812
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:48,985
I will never travel by auto again.

813
00:58:49,885 --> 00:58:50,767
Get lost.

814
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:53,186
Hey Geetha!

815
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:55,834
I will not come. Come near
hostel at 10 A.M. tomorrow.

816
00:59:05,872 --> 00:59:08,453
Girls have no time sense.

817
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:10,223
She told me to come at 10.

818
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,250
It is 10.30 now.
Still she has not come.

819
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:32,715
Are you playing with me? Wait...

820
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:48,573
100% You must be a female ant.

821
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,307
Are you maintaining
distance from boys?

822
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,824
Most probably your
name must be Geetha.

823
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:03,677
Bye.

824
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:05,688
Finally you laughed.

825
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:07,432
Shall we go?

826
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:12,369
Madam!

827
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,164
You are not ready to
travel in auto or bike.

828
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,347
And I cannot walk
on road with the bike.

829
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:21,721
Please sit. I will not apply brake
even if a bulldozer comes in front!

830
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,148
I promise!

831
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,814
I will tell you if
I see any bumps or pits.

832
01:00:25,894 --> 01:00:27,294
Please believe me.

833
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:32,730
Friend?
- Yes. Friend.

834
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:35,754
Only friend.

835
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:37,370
Yes... Only Friend.

836
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,847
'At least she agreed to sit.'

837
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:50,547
You are sitting with fear like how
small children sit on giant wheel.

838
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,553
People will mistake us.

839
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:54,162
I will see to it that
we do not touch even an inch.

840
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:55,651
Sit comfortably.

841
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:58,537
Okay.

842
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:32,211
Day before yesterday she
said we are like siblings.

843
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:33,907
Then she said we are friends.

844
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:35,279
After that 'Girlfriend'.

845
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:36,723
Then 'Wife'.

846
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:37,930
After that it is 'Knife'.

847
01:04:38,484 --> 01:04:40,338
Why are you discouraging me?
Keep quiet.

848
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,636
You still do not know above wives.

849
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:45,021
If I get hair on food
and question her about it

850
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:46,328
she says it might have flown

851
01:04:46,408 --> 01:04:48,880
due to wind and advises
me to remove it and eat silently.

852
01:04:49,435 --> 01:04:51,553
At the same time,
if she sees a long hair on my shirt

853
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:52,707
she starts abusing me.

854
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:55,656
We have no excuses.
She is torturing me.

855
01:04:56,658 --> 01:04:59,845
I think wives are
born to torture us.

856
01:04:59,925 --> 01:05:02,471
If I become Prime Minister
I will ban the concept of 'wife'.

857
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:03,786
Please.

858
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,307
Do not speak cheaply about wife.

859
01:05:06,387 --> 01:05:08,040
A girl holds an important
position in family.

860
01:05:10,138 --> 01:05:11,422
Have you not heard this song?

861
01:05:11,502 --> 01:05:13,233
"If you have a wife at home..."

862
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:14,722
Stop.

863
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:22,523
When?
- Long back.

864
01:05:22,603 --> 01:05:24,154
Is it?
- Yes.

865
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,357
What a good friend you are?!

866
01:05:26,437 --> 01:05:27,814
Thank you. Shall I leave?

867
01:05:27,894 --> 01:05:29,064
Bye, Madam.
- Okay.

868
01:05:29,144 --> 01:05:30,010
Thank you.

869
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,042
Bye Bro.
- Enjoy.

870
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,924
Baby!

871
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:35,789
Baby!

872
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:38,871
What is it?

873
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:40,687
Look at the star there.

874
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:43,404
Is it? Where?

875
01:05:43,543 --> 01:05:44,550
Here.

876
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:55,007
We farmers consider
Land as our life.

877
01:05:55,146 --> 01:05:58,123
Our life will brighten because of
the dam you are going to construct.

878
01:05:58,203 --> 01:06:00,282
You are like God to us.

879
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,942
May God bless you!

880
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:04,914
You are praising us a lot.

881
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,567
It is my duty.

882
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:10,553
I just want to do
some good to farmers.

883
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,984
Any kind of work in Dam
area will be looked after by Arun.

884
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:23,838
Minister has been
calling you repeatedly.

885
01:06:25,243 --> 01:06:28,464
He has called many times.
It is better if you receive.

886
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:30,046
What shall I tell him?

887
01:06:32,461 --> 01:06:34,285
Should I say that we were thrashed?

888
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:38,293
We should not spare the
persons responsible for this.

889
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:42,126
I will definitely stop
the construction of the dam.

890
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:45,523
Till now that project
was of the Minister.

891
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:48,313
It is mine from now.

892
01:06:51,332 --> 01:06:53,006
Make a plan to attack him.

893
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:58,198
It is a surprise!

894
01:06:58,388 --> 01:07:00,438
You have come to Bangalore
without informing.

895
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,870
I felt like seeing my daughter.
So I came.

896
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:06,752
You could have come to the factory.

897
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:09,436
You are there to take care of that.

898
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:10,602
Jeeva!
- Yes Sir.

899
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:11,505
Go to the temple.

900
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:12,887
Okay Sir.
- Temple!

901
01:07:13,077 --> 01:07:15,865
Yes. I called Geetha. She is there.

902
01:07:16,396 --> 01:07:18,284
I want to surprise her.

903
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:30,579
Which temple?
- It is...

904
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:35,077
What did you do?!

905
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:37,662
I am sorry. I missed.
- Hey, loafer.

906
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,566
Can't you see?
- Are you scolding me?

907
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:42,539
Yes. Shut up and get down.

908
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,885
Listen to me. Jeeva!

909
01:07:43,965 --> 01:07:47,206
Can't you see?
You have hit a parked car.

910
01:07:47,639 --> 01:07:49,411
Why are you fighting? Come back.

911
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:50,628
Sir! Just a minute.

912
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:52,467
Hey!

913
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:55,141
What nonsense are you talking?

914
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:56,575
Where are you going?

915
01:07:56,702 --> 01:07:57,776
I will come now.

916
01:07:59,766 --> 01:08:02,948
Hey Jeeva! Keep quiet.

917
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:04,328
He hit my auto.

918
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:06,514
Jeeva!
- Vishwa!

919
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,664
I am telling you.
- Ravi.

920
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:11,468
He hit my auto.

921
01:09:42,331 --> 01:09:43,369
Geetha!

922
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,150
Hey Geetha!
- What?

923
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:48,454
What is all this?
- Stop...

924
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:51,188
It is festival.

925
01:09:51,268 --> 01:09:52,472
Very nice.

926
01:09:52,677 --> 01:09:54,327
Will you take a photo?

927
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:57,853
Shout.

928
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:21,297
Take off your hand.

929
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:23,883
Don't you know I do not like
such things? - I am Sorry.

930
01:10:23,963 --> 01:10:25,220
Why did you keep your hand on me?

931
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,071
I do not want any explanation.
Give the phone.

932
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:28,777
I have to delete the photo.
Give phone.

933
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:29,893
Will you not give?

934
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:30,938
Give phone.

935
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:35,394
Do not come near. Stand far. I will
delete the photo and give you back.

936
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,252
Only my photos are
there in your phone.

937
01:10:52,393 --> 01:10:53,810
When did you click these?

938
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,913
Why should you keep my photo?

939
01:10:54,993 --> 01:10:55,923
It is just casual.

940
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:57,950
Why have you kept
it if it is just casual?

941
01:10:59,772 --> 01:11:03,447
Does it mean you love me?

942
01:11:09,813 --> 01:11:10,962
Alas!

943
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,747
You told you were my friend.
But cheated me.

944
01:11:12,827 --> 01:11:14,885
You are a cheater.

945
01:11:15,473 --> 01:11:16,621
Why did you do like this?

946
01:11:16,701 --> 01:11:19,119
You were saying that you
are my friend but betrayed me.

947
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:29,210
I never thought that
you will do like this.

948
01:11:32,206 --> 01:11:34,779
Hey! Do not touch me.

949
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,814
Get lost!

950
01:11:57,602 --> 01:11:58,487
Geetha!

951
01:12:03,492 --> 01:12:04,267
Geetha!

952
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:14,364
Geetha!

953
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:15,959
Geetha!

954
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:19,639
Do not be scared.
She will not be harmed.

955
01:13:19,903 --> 01:13:21,757
We will take care of her.

956
01:13:22,054 --> 01:13:25,375
Go and destroy that demon.

957
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:39,596
Lord Rama was not there
when Ravana touched Sita.

958
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:43,291
So Ravana was not killed there.

959
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,912
Today, Are you touching
Sita in the presence of Rama?

960
01:16:47,178 --> 01:16:51,319
Stop it! You are a cheat.

961
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:54,156
Are you trying to
murder someone now?

962
01:17:07,284 --> 01:17:09,315
She is okay now. You can take her.

963
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:10,800
Thank you, Doctor.
- Welcome.

964
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:17,509
Receive the call.

965
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:20,081
You go.

966
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,751
Okay.

967
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,132
Hi Dad!

968
01:17:46,272 --> 01:17:47,297
What happened?

969
01:17:47,442 --> 01:17:49,711
You look disturbed since 2 days.

970
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:51,949
Nothing...

971
01:17:55,855 --> 01:17:59,052
Dad! What happened?

972
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:01,381
As usual.

973
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:02,970
Are you sure?

974
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:05,272
Nothing serious.

975
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:08,658
I will say at the right time.

976
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:12,323
Ramanna was telling me

977
01:18:12,403 --> 01:18:15,575
that you have not been
eating food at home since 2 days.

978
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:18,582
What happened to you?

979
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:23,043
Nothing. Just office tension.

980
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:24,337
Are you sure?

981
01:18:24,777 --> 01:18:25,703
Yes.

982
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,296
Every morsel of grain
we eat is decided by God.

983
01:18:48,376 --> 01:18:52,162
But it is wife who decides
the type of food we eat.

984
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:55,378
So do not oppose wife.

985
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:57,584
Wow! Super dialogue.

986
01:18:57,784 --> 01:19:01,360
If I get the capacity to control
my wife after reading this book

987
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,422
I will make a wig for you
out of a wild animal's hair.

988
01:19:07,532 --> 01:19:10,373
'How to pacify your angry wife?'

989
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,369
This is what I need.

990
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:15,118
Just kiss your wife
when she is angry.

991
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,416
Her anger will subside immediately.

992
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:21,073
Super idea.

993
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,268
Hey!

994
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:25,630
What?
- Where is Mother?

995
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,574
My mother died 2 years back.

996
01:19:27,654 --> 01:19:30,075
Are you showing your sense of
humor because you are in good mood?

997
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:31,276
I enquired about my wife.

998
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:33,520
It has been 2 hours
since she went up.

999
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,413
Is it?!
- To the terrace.

1000
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,108
Are you joking?
Stop your comedy and work properly.

1001
01:19:38,188 --> 01:19:39,502
Otherwise I will throw you out.

1002
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,254
Why are you laughing?

1003
01:19:41,334 --> 01:19:43,103
I am already standing outside.

1004
01:19:43,753 --> 01:19:46,397
Punch dialogue! Wait.
I will fix you during lunch hour.

1005
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:54,730
Baby! Today I will
give you a sweet baby!

1006
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:09,169
How is my perfume?
It smells good. Isn't it?

1007
01:20:09,987 --> 01:20:11,450
Hey!

1008
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,219
Are you there?! Then who is this?

1009
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,720
I had a doubt when I hugged you.

1010
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,139
Still you hugged her?

1011
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:20,234
What I mean is...

1012
01:20:20,314 --> 01:20:22,221
You flirt like this when I am here.

1013
01:20:22,301 --> 01:20:24,959
I can imagine how you will
behave if I am not there...

1014
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:26,910
Baby! Just shut up.
What are you talking?

1015
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:31,917
Why will I touch her when
I have a beautiful wife like you?

1016
01:20:31,997 --> 01:20:34,074
You say.
- How dare you?

1017
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:37,484
Help!

1018
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:40,877
Namaste! How come you are here?

1019
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:42,646
We have brought food.

1020
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:44,987
Why did you take the
trouble of bringing this?

1021
01:20:45,067 --> 01:20:47,398
You are all working
so hard to alleviate

1022
01:20:47,478 --> 01:20:49,521
the problems of farmers like us.

1023
01:20:49,601 --> 01:20:51,877
Nothing wrong in
bringing food for you.

1024
01:20:51,957 --> 01:20:53,348
We have brought food for everyone.

1025
01:20:53,428 --> 01:20:56,977
Give food for all of them.
- Have food.

1026
01:20:59,951 --> 01:21:02,576
Listen to me.

1027
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:04,656
Call Aarya.

1028
01:21:06,634 --> 01:21:08,080
Call him.

1029
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:16,349
Geetha!

1030
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,850
Aarya!

1031
01:21:18,971 --> 01:21:21,026
What happened?

1032
01:21:21,302 --> 01:21:24,390
Father is not well.
- Is it?!

1033
01:22:01,635 --> 01:22:03,598
Hey! Stop.

1034
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:09,810
Where are you going?
- See you. Bye.

1035
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,571
Why? Will you not come?

1036
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:14,732
No. People will mistake
if I come. You go.

1037
01:22:14,812 --> 01:22:17,651
Why will they mistake?
You are my friend.

1038
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,308
She has started
the same thing again.

1039
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:23,526
What?
- Yes. Friend...

1040
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,402
Shall I go? Bye.

1041
01:22:27,678 --> 01:22:28,723
Start.

1042
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:38,057
What happened?

1043
01:22:38,555 --> 01:22:39,918
Why are you crying?

1044
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:41,953
I fainted because of low BP.

1045
01:22:42,033 --> 01:22:44,146
Baby! Don't fry.

1046
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:45,737
It is 'cry'.
- I know.

1047
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:48,462
Geetha!

1048
01:22:49,563 --> 01:22:51,714
Who told you that
father is not well?

1049
01:22:51,794 --> 01:22:54,704
Grandma!

1050
01:22:55,894 --> 01:23:00,391
I thought my son will recover
if he looks at his daughter's face.

1051
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:01,907
So I called him.

1052
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:04,895
Look at him. How shining?

1053
01:23:06,577 --> 01:23:08,050
How did you come?

1054
01:23:08,742 --> 01:23:13,558
Sister! Why are you irritating
her by asking such questions?

1055
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:18,505
You said your BP became low.
What happened to you?

1056
01:23:18,585 --> 01:23:21,654
He is depressed since few days.

1057
01:23:21,734 --> 01:23:24,671
He is upset since
returning from Bangalore.

1058
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:26,975
What happened? Tell me.

1059
01:23:27,183 --> 01:23:28,311
That...

1060
01:23:28,449 --> 01:23:32,545
Nothing happened.
Brother-in-law is tired

1061
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:34,966
He will be fine if
he takes rest for few days.

1062
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:39,180
Why are you making
this a serious issue?

1063
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,415
Go and do your work.
All of you go.

1064
01:23:43,642 --> 01:23:45,205
Do not get tensed.

1065
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:54,539
You go.

1066
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:56,345
Go and take rest.

1067
01:24:34,596 --> 01:24:36,042
Mummy...

1068
01:24:36,122 --> 01:24:37,911
How did this...

1069
01:24:40,103 --> 01:24:42,995
Will you not ask how this happened?

1070
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:44,456
Wife slipped and fell down from bike

1071
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:45,998
when she was travelling
with her husband.

1072
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,607
Poor lady! I am worried
about the wife's condition.

1073
01:24:48,687 --> 01:24:51,590
Her husband will take care of her.
You worry about me.

1074
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,755
My hand got fractured.

1075
01:24:54,835 --> 01:24:56,897
Will you not ask how this happened?

1076
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:00,660
If I ask you will lie that
you slipped in the bathroom. Right?

1077
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,204
No. I will tell the truth.

1078
01:25:02,284 --> 01:25:04,729
Okay. Tell.
- My wife hit me.

1079
01:25:04,928 --> 01:25:07,938
When did your wife
become so strong?!

1080
01:25:08,018 --> 01:25:12,105
She was the only person to hit me.
She only punched my face.

1081
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,174
Then who did this?

1082
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:16,567
Our house maid.

1083
01:25:16,647 --> 01:25:18,834
Why did she hit you?

1084
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:21,593
I hugged our maid mistaking
her to be my wife.

1085
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:25,884
Couldn't you differentiate
between wife and maid after hugging?

1086
01:25:25,964 --> 01:25:30,286
I realized. But I thought
my wife has become better.

1087
01:25:30,366 --> 01:25:33,451
You deserve this.

1088
01:25:33,531 --> 01:25:36,365
Sister! Your husband says
that the maid is better looking.

1089
01:25:36,445 --> 01:25:38,389
Better change the maid soon.

1090
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,726
She will kill me!
Where is the book?

1091
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,677
See you.

1092
01:25:47,088 --> 01:25:48,126
I am going to Bangalore.

1093
01:25:48,206 --> 01:25:50,238
We are searching a groom for you.

1094
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:53,532
I will marry the boy
whom my father chooses.

1095
01:25:56,582 --> 01:25:58,429
I want to tell you something.

1096
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,768
Why don't you find a boy for you?

1097
01:26:01,432 --> 01:26:03,272
You...!

1098
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:19,623
Bye!
- Bye!

1099
01:26:29,482 --> 01:26:30,803
You said you have exam.

1100
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:33,785
Instead of studying in hostel
why have you come to temple?

1101
01:26:33,974 --> 01:26:37,403
Don't you know that we
have to fulfill our prayers

1102
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:39,585
if we have to pass the exam?

1103
01:27:27,335 --> 01:27:28,961
Again to a temple!

1104
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:31,576
This is the last temple.

1105
01:27:37,747 --> 01:27:39,927
What happened?

1106
01:27:40,328 --> 01:27:41,712
Do you feel tired?
- Yes.

1107
01:27:47,608 --> 01:27:49,233
Why are you crying?

1108
01:27:49,703 --> 01:27:53,787
I do not have strength
to climb the stairs. I will fail.

1109
01:27:53,867 --> 01:27:56,596
I am unable to fulfill my prayers.
- Keep quiet.

1110
01:27:56,676 --> 01:28:00,123
What shall I do? I will fail.

1111
01:28:00,203 --> 01:28:02,012
Listen.

1112
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:05,805
Pray to God that this
lamp should not extinguish.

1113
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,182
Why?

1114
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:08,973
You pray. I will tell you.

1115
01:28:12,825 --> 01:28:15,947
O God! The lamp
should not extinguish.

1116
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:19,311
Please...

1117
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:22,000
It has extinguished.

1118
01:28:25,839 --> 01:28:27,449
I will surely fail this time.

1119
01:28:27,529 --> 01:28:29,857
Pray once more.

1120
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,109
Once more?
- Pray.

1121
01:28:35,616 --> 01:28:39,845
O God! Please...
The lamp should not extinguish.

1122
01:28:39,925 --> 01:28:41,289
Please...

1123
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:43,597
It has not extinguished!

1124
01:28:46,176 --> 01:28:47,990
Kalaam did not become
a renowned Scientist

1125
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:49,690
by praying to Saraswathi,
Goddess of learning.

1126
01:28:49,983 --> 01:28:51,875
Ambani did not become
rich by praying to Lakshmi

1127
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:53,387
Goddess of Wealth.

1128
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:58,030
I am not able to understand.

1129
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:00,684
I am putting in my efforts
by covering the lamp with my hands.

1130
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:05,771
The result is that the
lamp is not getting extinguished.

1131
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,616
We should put in efforts.

1132
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:11,937
If everyone burdens God
without making any effort

1133
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,279
what will God do?

1134
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:20,012
Which God will appreciate
if we expect everything from Him

1135
01:29:20,092 --> 01:29:21,646
without making any efforts?

1136
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:25,507
Look! You study.

1137
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:27,898
Then write the exam.

1138
01:29:28,557 --> 01:29:30,982
Leave the rest to God.

1139
01:29:35,105 --> 01:29:36,578
I have to go to hostel.

1140
01:29:37,242 --> 01:29:38,504
Why?

1141
01:29:38,726 --> 01:29:40,331
Take me to hostel.

1142
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:44,372
Why? Did I speak anything wrong?

1143
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,444
I want to study.

1144
01:32:20,938 --> 01:32:24,722
Is it proper if everyone
burdens God with his problems?

1145
01:32:25,089 --> 01:32:26,970
We should also make efforts. Right?

1146
01:33:23,555 --> 01:33:25,720
I have written the exam.

1147
01:33:26,132 --> 01:33:28,025
For the 1st time.

1148
01:34:09,069 --> 01:34:10,309
What?!

1149
01:34:29,595 --> 01:34:33,297
Shankar sir has deceived us.
Why did he do like this?

1150
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:36,687
He has cheated us.
I curse that he will never flourish.

1151
01:34:36,767 --> 01:34:37,743
Wait!

1152
01:34:37,823 --> 01:34:39,850
All of you wait.
Do not create tension.

1153
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:42,805
Mr Shankar!
We have Court summons for you.

1154
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,685
We are arresting you.

1155
01:34:45,176 --> 01:34:47,079
Do not strike a pose.

1156
01:34:47,159 --> 01:34:49,141
You wanted to take
away the farmers land

1157
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:51,500
to build a chemical
factory here. Right?

1158
01:34:52,373 --> 01:34:55,495
I have the file
where you have signed

1159
01:34:55,575 --> 01:34:58,340
that you will be building
a chemical factory here.

1160
01:34:58,521 --> 01:34:59,816
Signature!

1161
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:08,114
It is a fake one.
- Do not act.

1162
01:35:08,341 --> 01:35:10,046
You tricked them that you are

1163
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:12,105
constructing a dam
here and took their lands.

1164
01:35:12,589 --> 01:35:15,294
You have destroyed the
livelihood of the farmers.

1165
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:22,546
Sir! We thought you are God
who has come to improve our lives.

1166
01:35:22,626 --> 01:35:28,033
So we gave away our lands to you.

1167
01:35:28,171 --> 01:35:31,315
But you betrayed us. You...

1168
01:35:31,395 --> 01:35:33,387
No...!

1169
01:35:37,502 --> 01:35:43,484
This land belonged to our
forefathers and we worship this.

1170
01:35:44,712 --> 01:35:50,330
But you lied that you will get water

1171
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,441
and improve the cultivation.

1172
01:35:53,521 --> 01:35:56,361
You have hurt us.

1173
01:35:56,673 --> 01:35:59,233
You will be destroyed!

1174
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:41,350
Who is that?

1175
01:36:56,077 --> 01:36:57,263
Attack him.

1176
01:37:56,093 --> 01:37:57,616
Kill him.

1177
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:58,387
Come.

1178
01:38:58,467 --> 01:39:00,158
Come here.

1179
01:39:00,329 --> 01:39:01,828
You scoundrel.

1180
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,246
What happened?

1181
01:39:06,517 --> 01:39:08,797
Tell the truth.

1182
01:39:08,877 --> 01:39:14,297
He will not talk.
He has betrayed his employers.

1183
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:17,939
I will tell you the truth.

1184
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,523
Is this true?

1185
01:39:59,338 --> 01:40:00,534
Say.

1186
01:40:00,737 --> 01:40:02,500
Tell the truth.

1187
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,359
I was greedy.

1188
01:40:05,034 --> 01:40:07,785
So I connived with Lawyer
and Police and committed mistake.

1189
01:40:10,165 --> 01:40:11,721
Please forgive me.

1190
01:40:12,733 --> 01:40:14,446
You sinner!

1191
01:40:14,526 --> 01:40:17,418
No! Stop it.

1192
01:40:17,838 --> 01:40:18,883
Stop!

1193
01:40:19,401 --> 01:40:20,500
Stop!

1194
01:40:20,902 --> 01:40:21,801
Stop!

1195
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,521
My father can do lots of business

1196
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:28,186
if his intention
is only to make money.

1197
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:30,277
But he wanted to help the farmers

1198
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:33,257
and desired that you
get water throughout the year.

1199
01:40:33,337 --> 01:40:37,064
So he didn't hesitate
to start this dam project

1200
01:40:37,144 --> 01:40:38,876
when I presented this idea to him.

1201
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:43,423
He did not care for profit and
spent his earnings for this project.

1202
01:40:44,274 --> 01:40:49,184
My father is a Samaritan
who registered his personal property

1203
01:40:49,264 --> 01:40:54,492
to your names because you will
not feel the loss of your lands.

1204
01:40:58,015 --> 01:41:00,914
But you blame such
a person as cheat.

1205
01:41:02,636 --> 01:41:05,182
My father is not a betrayer.

1206
01:41:05,262 --> 01:41:07,479
He will give up his life
for those who believe him.

1207
01:41:09,153 --> 01:41:11,906
Even if he is insulted like this

1208
01:41:11,986 --> 01:41:13,762
he is so magnanimous

1209
01:41:13,842 --> 01:41:16,134
that he will live for the
farmers till his last breath.

1210
01:41:17,211 --> 01:41:21,431
He is a divine person
who cares for everyone.

1211
01:41:22,573 --> 01:41:23,804
Such is my father.

1212
01:41:47,266 --> 01:41:50,414
Call Advocate Kulkarni and tell
him to handle these legal issues.

1213
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:56,516
These legal problems are common for
Construction companies like ours.

1214
01:41:57,332 --> 01:41:59,179
Why is he disconnecting my call?

1215
01:41:59,497 --> 01:42:00,888
Wait and see.

1216
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:04,962
But we are building this
dam project for the 1st time.

1217
01:42:05,042 --> 01:42:07,958
We have purchased land
from farmers legally.

1218
01:42:08,038 --> 01:42:10,346
This is not a problem for villagers.

1219
01:42:14,352 --> 01:42:17,806
I think the Minister
is behind these problems.

1220
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:21,597
Let us not talk about the Minister.

1221
01:42:21,805 --> 01:42:23,215
Our focus now should be on...
- Hello!

1222
01:42:23,295 --> 01:42:25,534
I am in an important meeting.
Will call you later.

1223
01:42:25,614 --> 01:42:26,908
Listen...

1224
01:42:27,591 --> 01:42:29,675
This project is very
prestigious for our Company.

1225
01:42:29,755 --> 01:42:31,284
Are you disconnecting
while I am talking?

1226
01:42:31,783 --> 01:42:32,945
Just see what I will do.

1227
01:42:33,025 --> 01:42:37,781
Already there is news in
market that this project is delayed.

1228
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:40,016
But we should complete
this project fast.

1229
01:42:40,096 --> 01:42:41,842
Aarya!
- Dad.

1230
01:42:42,264 --> 01:42:43,377
Speak.

1231
01:42:44,913 --> 01:42:46,234
I am sorry.

1232
01:42:48,504 --> 01:42:49,528
What is the matter?

1233
01:42:49,608 --> 01:42:51,001
Why are you screaming?

1234
01:42:51,493 --> 01:42:53,963
Okay... Tell me. What is the matter?
- I am near the hostel. Come now.

1235
01:42:54,163 --> 01:42:55,208
Come fast.

1236
01:42:59,213 --> 01:43:01,281
Let him come. I will yell at him!

1237
01:43:01,558 --> 01:43:05,156
Will you come or not?
- Hello! It is Me

1238
01:43:07,122 --> 01:43:08,264
Father!

1239
01:43:08,344 --> 01:43:10,824
I will call you later
if you are busy now.

1240
01:43:10,904 --> 01:43:12,761
What is the matter?
- Nothing.

1241
01:43:13,681 --> 01:43:15,588
We are discussing
about your marriage

1242
01:43:15,668 --> 01:43:18,173
with your aunt's son Chandan.

1243
01:43:19,411 --> 01:43:22,456
I called to know your opinion.

1244
01:43:23,182 --> 01:43:24,967
Why are you silent?

1245
01:43:25,047 --> 01:43:27,957
Marriage!

1246
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:30,392
Only if you wish.

1247
01:43:30,472 --> 01:43:34,198
I need some time.
I will call you later.

1248
01:43:34,357 --> 01:43:36,212
Okay.

1249
01:43:37,022 --> 01:43:41,934
She needs time. I will talk to her.

1250
01:43:42,014 --> 01:43:44,176
Okay.
- Okay Vishwa!

1251
01:43:56,804 --> 01:43:58,194
What is the matter?

1252
01:43:58,274 --> 01:43:59,911
Why are you asking angrily?

1253
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:02,056
Why did you call me?

1254
01:44:03,848 --> 01:44:05,543
Nothing.
- What?!

1255
01:44:05,785 --> 01:44:07,715
I was in an important
meeting with Father.

1256
01:44:07,795 --> 01:44:08,899
I left in mid-way
and have come here.

1257
01:44:08,979 --> 01:44:11,729
Do you mean your Father
is more important to you than me?

1258
01:44:11,809 --> 01:44:13,210
What nonsense are you talking?

1259
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:14,524
Is your Father not important to you?

1260
01:44:14,604 --> 01:44:16,018
In the same way my
father is important to me.

1261
01:44:16,098 --> 01:44:18,260
Look! Do not talk about my father.

1262
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,080
Your father and my father
are of different type.

1263
01:44:20,515 --> 01:44:22,045
Do not speak like an insane person.

1264
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,919
Am I talking like a mad person?!

1265
01:44:23,999 --> 01:44:25,593
Are you calling me mad?

1266
01:44:26,161 --> 01:44:27,254
Okay. Forget it.

1267
01:44:27,334 --> 01:44:28,811
Now tell me the matter.

1268
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:31,289
Nothing.

1269
01:44:31,767 --> 01:44:32,991
What do you mean?!

1270
01:44:33,504 --> 01:44:35,054
Nothing.

1271
01:44:35,221 --> 01:44:37,262
Then did you call me for fun?

1272
01:44:38,182 --> 01:44:40,438
Speak. Tell something.

1273
01:44:42,388 --> 01:44:45,453
I am going to my native place.

1274
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:47,274
Why?

1275
01:44:47,918 --> 01:44:49,302
My family has selected
a groom for me.

1276
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:50,686
That is why.

1277
01:44:50,963 --> 01:44:52,222
Did you agree?

1278
01:44:52,554 --> 01:44:54,360
Shouldn't I agree?

1279
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,529
Why should you agree?

1280
01:44:55,609 --> 01:44:57,729
Should I not agree to marry
the groom selected by my father?

1281
01:44:57,929 --> 01:45:00,109
Why should I take permission
from you? Who are you to me?

1282
01:45:00,656 --> 01:45:01,680
Who am I?!

1283
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,717
You thought about me when
you didn't have anyone here.

1284
01:45:04,797 --> 01:45:06,848
Ask that. It will answer who I am.

1285
01:45:07,416 --> 01:45:10,170
You thought you will be
safe with me wherever you go.

1286
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,242
Ask your mind.
That will say who I am.

1287
01:45:14,222 --> 01:45:16,353
I just thought of you as a friend.
Nothing else.

1288
01:45:16,512 --> 01:45:18,435
You are not a small child.

1289
01:45:18,515 --> 01:45:21,009
Both of us know our
feelings towards each other.

1290
01:45:21,089 --> 01:45:23,362
What is there between us?

1291
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:25,092
What special is there?

1292
01:45:26,051 --> 01:45:28,267
Then... Are we not friends?

1293
01:45:28,347 --> 01:45:30,266
Started your drama again...

1294
01:45:30,346 --> 01:45:32,594
Are you cheating me after
calling me your friend?

1295
01:45:32,674 --> 01:45:35,070
You are a cheater.
- Are you insulting me?

1296
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,418
Are you teasing me?

1297
01:45:38,654 --> 01:45:43,326
You mistook when I held
your shoulders in the bike

1298
01:45:43,406 --> 01:45:47,023
and hugged you in
front of exam hall.

1299
01:45:47,449 --> 01:45:49,148
Are you taking advantage of that?

1300
01:45:49,534 --> 01:45:51,312
I didn't know you have
such cheap mentality.

1301
01:45:51,392 --> 01:45:54,038
Stop it.
I am not cheap. But you are.

1302
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:56,473
I am a straight forward person.

1303
01:45:56,553 --> 01:45:58,292
I will directly tell
what I feel. Listen.

1304
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:00,479
I love you.

1305
01:46:02,783 --> 01:46:03,973
I love you.

1306
01:46:06,941 --> 01:46:08,989
Do not be shocked.

1307
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:11,191
I am the only Man
who says I hate you

1308
01:46:11,271 --> 01:46:14,718
the very next moment after saying,
that I love you.

1309
01:46:14,798 --> 01:46:16,960
Yes. I hate you.

1310
01:46:17,947 --> 01:46:19,089
I hate you.

1311
01:46:20,202 --> 01:46:23,709
Because I will turn mental if I
live with an insane person like you.

1312
01:46:23,789 --> 01:46:26,124
Thank God! I am saved.

1313
01:46:27,024 --> 01:46:30,034
The person who marries
you will be doomed.

1314
01:46:30,297 --> 01:46:32,663
What did you say?! Doomed!

1315
01:46:34,795 --> 01:46:36,448
He is not an ordinary
person like you.

1316
01:46:36,528 --> 01:46:37,901
Extra ordinary.

1317
01:46:38,752 --> 01:46:40,842
My father will find
a Prince as husband for me.

1318
01:46:40,922 --> 01:46:45,282
Let me also see if you will
be happy with that extraordinary

1319
01:46:45,362 --> 01:46:48,326
Prince or miss living with
an ordinary person like me,

1320
01:46:48,406 --> 01:46:51,349
who will take care of
you like a Princess. Get lost.

1321
01:47:19,394 --> 01:47:20,889
Father!
- Tell me. Dear.

1322
01:47:21,131 --> 01:47:22,418
I agree to this marriage.

1323
01:47:22,498 --> 01:47:25,642
Ready?! Just now
you said you need time.

1324
01:47:26,272 --> 01:47:28,176
I am saying after thinking over it.

1325
01:47:28,256 --> 01:47:29,477
I am ready for this marriage.

1326
01:47:29,557 --> 01:47:33,114
Did you think well? Do you agree?

1327
01:47:33,341 --> 01:47:35,212
Father! I agree.

1328
01:47:36,972 --> 01:47:37,985
Okay.

1329
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:39,324
I will come there.

1330
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:41,333
Come. I will send car.

1331
01:47:43,741 --> 01:47:45,407
Jyoti!
- Yes.

1332
01:47:45,487 --> 01:47:47,223
Geetha has agreed for this marriage.

1333
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,759
You are wrong, Geetha.

1334
01:47:53,839 --> 01:47:55,800
If you take decision in anger,
you will have to repent later.

1335
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,942
Listen to me.

1336
01:47:57,594 --> 01:47:59,874
You will never get a good
boy like Aarya in your life.

1337
01:47:59,954 --> 01:48:02,274
I know you love Aarya very much.

1338
01:48:03,426 --> 01:48:06,818
You hold him in your heart. No use
even if you go far away from him.

1339
01:48:07,216 --> 01:48:11,785
Do not destroy your love
for the sake of your ego.

1340
01:48:12,189 --> 01:48:14,315
Please Geetha. Do not go.

1341
01:48:14,395 --> 01:48:15,599
Geetha!

1342
01:48:16,143 --> 01:48:19,389
I will marry only the
person selected by my father.

1343
01:48:20,974 --> 01:48:22,032
Geetha!

1344
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:24,724
Geetha!

1345
01:48:40,045 --> 01:48:41,002
Welcome.

1346
01:48:41,294 --> 01:48:42,658
Father!
- Come.

1347
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:46,853
I am tired. Let me take some rest.

1348
01:48:46,933 --> 01:48:48,124
Okay. Go.

1349
01:48:52,546 --> 01:48:53,932
Sir!
- What?

1350
01:48:54,401 --> 01:48:56,097
Aarya!
- Who is he?

1351
01:49:02,616 --> 01:49:03,705
Yes.

1352
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:07,279
Brother-in-law!

1353
01:49:27,389 --> 01:49:28,306
Father!

1354
01:49:30,613 --> 01:49:34,084
Who is Aarya?
- My friend.

1355
01:49:37,387 --> 01:49:41,425
No need for that friendship.

1356
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:43,068
Why?

1357
01:49:52,823 --> 01:49:57,914
Once upon a time

1358
01:49:59,311 --> 01:50:00,733
we were close friends.

1359
01:50:08,788 --> 01:50:09,909
Well done Shankar.

1360
01:50:09,989 --> 01:50:11,482
You have got a big
project from Government

1361
01:50:11,562 --> 01:50:13,265
at the start of your career.

1362
01:50:13,445 --> 01:50:15,362
Congratulations!
- Thank you, Ramesh.

1363
01:50:18,066 --> 01:50:21,934
Wonderful!
My soul mate has become an Engineer.

1364
01:50:22,221 --> 01:50:23,280
Give.

1365
01:50:24,357 --> 01:50:26,586
Enough. Leave Bangalore
and come back.

1366
01:50:26,666 --> 01:50:30,305
We have lots of property.
You can sit and relax.

1367
01:50:30,385 --> 01:50:32,578
Come back.
Let us all live happily together.

1368
01:50:32,724 --> 01:50:36,702
You have helped me a lot
in my life and for studies.

1369
01:50:36,986 --> 01:50:41,240
If I do not achieve anything,
it will be an insult to you.

1370
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:45,440
So I have to stay back
in Bangalore for some more days.

1371
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,217
Naughty! Are you staying
back to achieve something

1372
01:50:48,297 --> 01:50:50,537
or you are in love with someone?

1373
01:50:50,808 --> 01:50:51,745
Nothing of that sort.

1374
01:50:51,825 --> 01:50:53,676
Ma! He is teasing me.

1375
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,170
I will select a girl
for you and get you married.

1376
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:58,610
Promise me.

1377
01:50:59,726 --> 01:51:01,338
Look how he is dominating me!

1378
01:51:01,418 --> 01:51:02,484
Both of you are my children.

1379
01:51:02,564 --> 01:51:03,848
If he is controlling you,
you also do.

1380
01:51:04,686 --> 01:51:06,485
Not only are you going far.

1381
01:51:06,565 --> 01:51:09,083
You are also distancing
my sister Meera from me.

1382
01:51:09,403 --> 01:51:11,741
Have you started the same thing?

1383
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:14,934
Why should I separate
brother and sister?

1384
01:51:15,435 --> 01:51:19,760
Meera wanted to study medicine.
She got seat on merit.

1385
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:22,246
I gave her permission to study.
Is it wrong?

1386
01:51:22,326 --> 01:51:24,301
I have never stayed without Meera.

1387
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:27,211
I have left her in Bangalore

1388
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:29,893
because of the only
reason that you are there.

1389
01:51:31,782 --> 01:51:32,937
Do not worry.

1390
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:35,036
She is my responsibility.

1391
01:52:06,545 --> 01:52:10,143
My love is real. Believe me.

1392
01:52:10,913 --> 01:52:16,439
I have not taken
this decision in haste.

1393
01:52:16,967 --> 01:52:20,426
I am saying only
after thinking over it.

1394
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:25,988
I will speak to Narasimhan tomorrow.

1395
01:52:26,068 --> 01:52:27,501
Do not tell now.

1396
01:52:28,072 --> 01:52:29,612
Let the exams be over.

1397
01:52:30,424 --> 01:52:34,956
You know that my brother
is short-tempered.

1398
01:52:35,502 --> 01:52:39,852
If he takes me back to native
before completion of studies

1399
01:52:40,293 --> 01:52:42,274
our dreams will be shattered.

1400
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:49,556
Okay. I am going
to Hyderabad tomorrow.

1401
01:52:50,342 --> 01:52:53,516
I will return only after few days.

1402
01:52:54,822 --> 01:52:56,275
You be careful.

1403
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:03,574
May you live long!

1404
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:09,158
Give for us also.

1405
01:53:11,968 --> 01:53:14,639
Why are you grim on a festival day?

1406
01:53:15,352 --> 01:53:17,538
I am reminded of Meera.

1407
01:53:18,112 --> 01:53:21,779
She is not with us on the festival
day. I do not feel cheerful at all.

1408
01:53:23,058 --> 01:53:26,025
She has gone only for studying.
Still you are sad.

1409
01:53:26,307 --> 01:53:29,988
What will happen to you
if she gets married and goes away?

1410
01:53:30,127 --> 01:53:31,671
Not possible.

1411
01:53:31,843 --> 01:53:34,472
What do you mean?
Will you not perform her marriage?

1412
01:53:34,552 --> 01:53:35,817
Of course I will.

1413
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:38,400
But I will find
out a good groom from

1414
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,676
our family and perform marriage.

1415
01:53:40,891 --> 01:53:45,658
Even after marriage,
Meera should be here, with me.

1416
01:53:46,197 --> 01:53:47,865
From where will
you get such a groom?

1417
01:53:47,945 --> 01:53:49,435
Don't we have such
a boy in our house?

1418
01:53:49,515 --> 01:53:56,244
Ramesh Sir! Work honestly.
Do not betray your employers.

1419
01:53:57,704 --> 01:53:58,956
Namaste!
- Come.

1420
01:53:59,036 --> 01:54:00,740
February accounts
are there in this book.

1421
01:54:00,906 --> 01:54:03,389
You go. He is thinking
of some other thing.

1422
01:54:03,469 --> 01:54:05,444
No Madam Let him see once.

1423
01:54:05,524 --> 01:54:08,142
Have you seen?
- Yes.

1424
01:54:08,222 --> 01:54:11,214
Your name signifies Trust.
You may go.

1425
01:54:11,294 --> 01:54:14,546
Okay. See you.

1426
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:20,181
Jyoti! Who is it?

1427
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:23,896
Meera?
- Yes.

1428
01:54:23,976 --> 01:54:24,990
Give.

1429
01:54:25,946 --> 01:54:28,071
Meera!
- How are you?

1430
01:54:28,283 --> 01:54:30,683
Are you all fine?
- Yes. We are fine.

1431
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:33,096
But you have forgotten everybody.

1432
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:34,962
It has been many
months since I saw you.

1433
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,923
I will come to see you tomorrow

1434
01:54:38,003 --> 01:54:39,344
No, Brother.
- Why?

1435
01:54:39,424 --> 01:54:41,753
I am not in Bangalore now.
- Is it?!

1436
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:44,007
I am outside, in a camp.

1437
01:54:44,087 --> 01:54:45,999
When will you come to our place?

1438
01:54:46,297 --> 01:54:50,351
I have to travel from one
place to another during camp.

1439
01:54:50,431 --> 01:54:52,095
I cannot assure
you when I will come.

1440
01:54:52,175 --> 01:54:55,333
It may take 3-4 months to get over.

1441
01:54:55,413 --> 01:54:58,066
What?! 3-4 months more?

1442
01:54:58,146 --> 01:55:02,696
Yes. I will come directly
there once it is over.

1443
01:55:02,846 --> 01:55:05,689
Okay. At least call me often.

1444
01:55:05,769 --> 01:55:07,176
Okay Brother.

1445
01:55:12,095 --> 01:55:16,883
Congratulations! I saw the reports.

1446
01:55:16,963 --> 01:55:18,564
You are now 3 months
pregnant. Right?

1447
01:55:29,793 --> 01:55:32,000
Madam! This boy's name is Abhi.

1448
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,538
He is a Doctor. He will be
suitable for your sister-in-law.

1449
01:55:34,618 --> 01:55:36,171
What is happening here?

1450
01:55:36,251 --> 01:55:39,353
Meera's and this boy's
horoscope match very well.

1451
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:41,290
Who told you to select
a groom for Meera?

1452
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:42,801
He is a Doctor...

1453
01:55:42,946 --> 01:55:44,772
Who said? He?
- Yes.

1454
01:55:44,852 --> 01:55:47,139
Sir! Please get up. You may go.

1455
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:49,201
Why?
- Please go.

1456
01:55:49,555 --> 01:55:50,641
He is a good boy.

1457
01:55:50,721 --> 01:55:53,207
I will not get my sister
married to an outsider.

1458
01:55:53,287 --> 01:55:55,234
He is a Doctor.
- Not possible.

1459
01:55:55,372 --> 01:55:57,524
I will find out a good boy
from our family and get her married.

1460
01:55:57,604 --> 01:55:59,447
Where will you get
such a trustworthy boy?

1461
01:55:59,527 --> 01:56:01,377
I will surely get.

1462
01:56:03,315 --> 01:56:05,163
Money received after selling
cocoanuts. You may count.

1463
01:56:05,243 --> 01:56:06,546
Not now. You go.

1464
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:07,911
I have to do loading. That is why...

1465
01:56:07,991 --> 01:56:09,170
You go now. Vishwa!

1466
01:56:10,126 --> 01:56:12,412
Stop working in our house from now.
You have worked a lot.

1467
01:56:12,492 --> 01:56:14,360
Why? Have I done anything wrong?

1468
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,561
Do not come for work.

1469
01:56:15,641 --> 01:56:17,272
Please do not say so.

1470
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:20,261
I will not leave this
house even if you kick me out.

1471
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:22,065
I will be always your servant.

1472
01:56:22,145 --> 01:56:24,235
Do not say so.

1473
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:26,746
You are not our servant from now.

1474
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,050
You belong to our house.
- I can't understand.

1475
01:56:30,792 --> 01:56:33,360
My sister Meera and
you will get married.

1476
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,071
Sir!
- Yes.

1477
01:56:37,236 --> 01:56:40,357
He grew up in our house.

1478
01:56:40,618 --> 01:56:43,961
He is the suitable
husband for Meera.

1479
01:56:45,816 --> 01:56:46,884
Come.

1480
01:56:51,018 --> 01:56:57,622
It is better if you meet
Meera once and speak to her.

1481
01:56:58,558 --> 01:57:00,611
That is wrong.

1482
01:57:01,019 --> 01:57:03,326
What is this?

1483
01:57:03,406 --> 01:57:09,317
Narasimhan has propagated
that you are Meera's husband.

1484
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:12,340
Shall we go and meet
her without his knowledge?

1485
01:57:19,371 --> 01:57:23,041
Bro! She is not in the hostel.

1486
01:57:23,789 --> 01:57:29,025
She has not reached the
hostel still. What does it mean?

1487
01:57:29,268 --> 01:57:30,979
Where did she go?

1488
01:57:33,136 --> 01:57:36,535
Someone has come in auto.

1489
01:57:58,051 --> 01:57:59,263
Come.

1490
01:58:03,617 --> 01:58:04,520
Meera!

1491
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:07,396
Vishwa! You here?

1492
01:58:08,869 --> 01:58:10,070
What is this?

1493
01:58:13,867 --> 01:58:16,546
Please do not tell my brother.

1494
01:58:17,969 --> 01:58:19,558
Please do not tell this matter.

1495
01:58:19,974 --> 01:58:21,933
Call you at 10 tomorrow.

1496
01:58:22,013 --> 01:58:24,031
Sir!

1497
01:58:24,518 --> 01:58:26,301
Sir!
- Vishwa!

1498
01:58:27,468 --> 01:58:28,653
What happened?

1499
01:58:28,733 --> 01:58:29,803
Sir!

1500
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:31,513
Meera...

1501
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:33,965
Meera?

1502
01:58:34,669 --> 01:58:36,313
Shankara...

1503
01:58:36,706 --> 01:58:37,824
Shankara?

1504
01:58:37,904 --> 01:58:39,446
Both of them have eloped.

1505
01:58:42,168 --> 01:58:43,580
Hey!

1506
01:58:44,001 --> 01:58:45,124
Sir!

1507
01:58:45,429 --> 01:58:47,461
Meera is my sister.

1508
01:58:48,014 --> 01:58:51,667
She will never defame me.

1509
01:58:53,887 --> 01:58:56,560
Shankara is my soul mate.

1510
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:01,363
He will not betray me.

1511
01:59:02,865 --> 01:59:04,851
I have grown up in your house.

1512
01:59:05,403 --> 01:59:08,918
If you think I am lying,
you may cut my tongue.

1513
01:59:09,188 --> 01:59:14,232
Sir! Meera is pregnant.

1514
01:59:18,113 --> 01:59:19,644
What did you say?!

1515
01:59:19,724 --> 01:59:23,359
Call the hostel and ask
if you do not believe me.

1516
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:25,097
Call the hostel and ask.

1517
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:29,151
She has cheated us.

1518
01:59:37,056 --> 01:59:39,968
Is Meera pregnant?

1519
01:59:40,122 --> 01:59:43,277
Don't you know that
Meera has married Shankar?!

1520
01:59:49,587 --> 01:59:51,059
What is this?

1521
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:07,636
I could not keep up my word.

1522
02:00:10,154 --> 02:00:12,113
Please forgive me.

1523
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:16,474
Why are you feeling bad?
You are not at fault.

1524
02:00:17,593 --> 02:00:19,906
I will never leave
you under any circumstance.

1525
02:00:20,943 --> 02:00:22,260
Even now I am telling you.

1526
02:00:23,886 --> 02:00:25,934
I will marry your sister.

1527
02:00:27,401 --> 02:00:29,216
What are you saying?

1528
02:00:29,598 --> 02:00:32,459
If you agree, I will

1529
02:00:35,044 --> 02:00:36,800
marry your sister even now.

1530
02:00:48,423 --> 02:00:49,812
Vishwa!

1531
02:01:02,678 --> 02:01:04,327
He is a true friend.

1532
02:01:07,459 --> 02:01:11,262
Do you want to have
friendship with a betrayer?

1533
02:01:13,945 --> 02:01:16,984
I was listening
to you all these days

1534
02:01:17,952 --> 02:01:20,255
At least this time you listen to me.

1535
02:01:27,002 --> 02:01:29,769
No need for that friendship.

1536
02:01:41,505 --> 02:01:45,255
Geetha! Do you love Aarya?

1537
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:51,164
Do not marry someone
else when you love a person.

1538
02:01:51,778 --> 02:01:55,320
Do not agree now and
then spoil the family honor

1539
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,130
later because you want
to live with that person.

1540
02:02:00,265 --> 02:02:01,400
Geetha!

1541
02:02:02,956 --> 02:02:04,568
Stop.

1542
02:02:05,232 --> 02:02:08,546
My father built a fort
of love for me in childhood...

1543
02:02:08,626 --> 02:02:10,940
Made me a Princess of that fort...

1544
02:02:11,264 --> 02:02:13,714
Was serving me like a servant...

1545
02:02:13,794 --> 02:02:17,124
gave me whatever I wished for

1546
02:02:17,505 --> 02:02:21,518
and found his happiness
in my happiness.

1547
02:02:21,933 --> 02:02:25,226
No boy can give
a girl such affection.

1548
02:02:26,243 --> 02:02:28,346
Of Course I said I love him.

1549
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:31,232
But how did you think
that I will go after him?

1550
02:02:35,129 --> 02:02:41,972
My father loved me even before
I started calling him my father.

1551
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:45,376
I cannot cause him pain.

1552
02:02:45,603 --> 02:02:47,695
If I do,
there is no purpose in my life.

1553
02:02:48,272 --> 02:02:50,741
I have been telling from
the beginning and even now.

1554
02:02:50,821 --> 02:02:55,922
I will marry the boy
chosen by my father for me.

1555
02:02:58,613 --> 02:03:01,675
Grandma! You have been telling

1556
02:03:02,029 --> 02:03:06,924
that my husband will
be like a Prince. Isn't it?

1557
02:03:07,996 --> 02:03:10,063
It is a lie.

1558
02:03:10,502 --> 02:03:12,443
Nobody can become a Prince or be

1559
02:03:12,523 --> 02:03:14,534
like Lord Rama as
soon as he is born.

1560
02:03:14,983 --> 02:03:19,549
It will be known only after seeing
the way he looks after his wife.

1561
02:03:19,629 --> 02:03:22,403
Life is not about marrying
the person we love.

1562
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:25,298
We should sacrifice our life for
the sake of the person who loves us.

1563
02:03:25,378 --> 02:03:27,211
That is life.

1564
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:50,358
Aarya!

1565
02:04:51,063 --> 02:04:52,025
Dad!

1566
02:04:52,105 --> 02:04:53,499
Let us go and bring Geetha.

1567
02:04:53,579 --> 02:04:55,236
How did you know about Geetha?

1568
02:04:58,529 --> 02:05:03,441
I had hid a truth
from you all these years.

1569
02:05:04,716 --> 02:05:07,112
I have to tell that to you today.

1570
02:05:38,818 --> 02:05:39,867
Geetha!

1571
02:05:40,434 --> 02:05:41,680
Where is Geetha?

1572
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,569
Sir! Geetha is missing.

1573
02:05:46,419 --> 02:05:48,252
Geetha!
- Search for her.

1574
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:51,065
Look there.
- Geetha!

1575
02:05:55,055 --> 02:05:55,976
What happened?

1576
02:05:56,056 --> 02:05:59,891
A person betrayed us 28 years back.

1577
02:06:00,142 --> 02:06:04,734
Today the same person and
his son have kidnapped Geetha.

1578
02:06:17,908 --> 02:06:19,563
Where is he?

1579
02:06:25,962 --> 02:06:29,619
Where are you? Come out.

1580
02:06:29,699 --> 02:06:31,235
Come.

1581
02:09:15,534 --> 02:09:17,216
Are you tired?

1582
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:20,308
Shall I tell something?

1583
02:09:21,857 --> 02:09:23,899
I did not kidnap

1584
02:09:26,446 --> 02:09:27,553
your daughter.

1585
02:09:31,461 --> 02:09:32,810
You see for yourself.

1586
02:10:01,561 --> 02:10:03,609
Are you surprised?

1587
02:10:03,941 --> 02:10:08,584
They have taken this decision
because they know a truth.

1588
02:10:10,965 --> 02:10:14,396
Do you also want to know that truth?

1589
02:10:18,901 --> 02:10:23,543
My love is true. Brother!
It is true that I love Shankar.

1590
02:10:23,737 --> 02:10:25,162
Shankar!

1591
02:10:25,528 --> 02:10:30,793
Yes. His name is also Shankar,
like you.

1592
02:10:31,817 --> 02:10:33,553
Dr Shankar.

1593
02:10:33,782 --> 02:10:36,577
Sir! Accounts are not tallying.

1594
02:10:37,090 --> 02:10:39,200
I fear that we will be caught.

1595
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:42,715
See how I will adjust the accounts.

1596
02:10:42,795 --> 02:10:44,998
I will find out a good
boy for her and get her married.

1597
02:10:45,078 --> 02:10:46,512
From where will
you get such a groom?

1598
02:10:46,592 --> 02:10:48,096
Don't we have such
a boy in our house?

1599
02:10:48,176 --> 02:10:52,576
Ramesh Sir! Work honestly.

1600
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:55,371
Do not betray your employers.

1601
02:10:55,522 --> 02:10:57,141
February accounts
are there in this book.

1602
02:10:57,221 --> 02:10:59,922
Your name signifies Trust.
You may go.

1603
02:11:04,704 --> 02:11:07,506
What?! 3-4 months more?

1604
02:11:07,586 --> 02:11:08,765
Yes.

1605
02:11:09,076 --> 02:11:11,982
Okay. At least call often.

1606
02:11:12,062 --> 02:11:13,165
Okay.

1607
02:11:18,341 --> 02:11:21,025
You are now 3 months
pregnant. Right?

1608
02:11:26,512 --> 02:11:27,584
What shall we do?

1609
02:11:28,477 --> 02:11:29,999
I want this child.

1610
02:11:46,286 --> 02:11:47,372
Hello!

1611
02:11:47,452 --> 02:11:49,087
Hello! Is Meera there?

1612
02:11:49,167 --> 02:11:50,990
Yes. She is here.
Wait a minute. I will call her.

1613
02:11:53,882 --> 02:11:54,823
Hello Brother.

1614
02:11:54,903 --> 02:11:57,404
Why didn't you call
me since so many days?

1615
02:11:57,805 --> 02:11:59,119
That...

1616
02:11:59,576 --> 02:12:00,565
Nothing.

1617
02:12:00,645 --> 02:12:02,539
Hope everything is fine.

1618
02:12:02,619 --> 02:12:04,182
Yes.
- That...

1619
02:12:04,262 --> 02:12:07,123
You come here after
finishing your work.

1620
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,611
No issues.
- Okay.

1621
02:12:13,901 --> 02:12:17,222
'Is she in trouble
and hiding it from me?'

1622
02:12:18,329 --> 02:12:21,547
Money got after sale cocoanuts.
How much shall we take?

1623
02:12:21,627 --> 02:12:24,274
I will not get my sister
married to an outsider.

1624
02:12:24,354 --> 02:12:25,263
Watch it.

1625
02:12:26,832 --> 02:12:28,633
I will change the whole story.

1626
02:12:28,713 --> 02:12:30,853
I will surely get.

1627
02:12:33,255 --> 02:12:35,027
Money received after selling
cocoanuts. You may count.

1628
02:12:35,107 --> 02:12:37,615
My sister Meera and
you will get married.

1629
02:12:37,695 --> 02:12:39,794
Sir!
- Yes.

1630
02:12:59,022 --> 02:13:01,181
I made a big mistake.

1631
02:13:01,884 --> 02:13:04,153
I should have told this
matter to Narasimhan before.

1632
02:13:04,673 --> 02:13:06,655
That...
- You keep quiet.

1633
02:13:07,817 --> 02:13:11,126
Immediately both of you
come with me to our native.

1634
02:13:13,309 --> 02:13:15,545
Sister-in-law is not in hostel.

1635
02:13:18,034 --> 02:13:20,507
Someone has come in auto.

1636
02:13:31,871 --> 02:13:33,194
Meera!

1637
02:13:34,370 --> 02:13:36,472
Vishwa!
- What is this?!

1638
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:40,191
Please do not tell my brother.

1639
02:13:40,355 --> 02:13:43,676
Your brother wanted
you to get married to me.

1640
02:13:43,756 --> 02:13:45,069
What nonsense are you talking?!

1641
02:13:45,149 --> 02:13:46,816
You should become mine.

1642
02:13:46,896 --> 02:13:50,285
You are a servant in our house.

1643
02:13:50,441 --> 02:13:53,355
Do you deserve to marry me?

1644
02:13:54,142 --> 02:13:58,708
I love Dr Shankar.
I have got married to him.

1645
02:14:00,438 --> 02:14:02,436
Excuse me! Stop a minute.

1646
02:14:02,516 --> 02:14:03,717
Why?

1647
02:14:03,797 --> 02:14:08,500
Meera will have trouble
in packing the luggage alone.

1648
02:14:09,157 --> 02:14:11,026
I will also go and help her.

1649
02:14:11,348 --> 02:14:13,873
I am sorry.
I was tensed and forgot about it.

1650
02:14:13,953 --> 02:14:16,211
Never mind. I will go.

1651
02:14:21,886 --> 02:14:25,235
I will not spare
anyone who obstructs me.

1652
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:28,370
Meera!

1653
02:14:31,282 --> 02:14:32,327
Meera!

1654
02:14:43,265 --> 02:14:47,361
Meera! Be Careful.

1655
02:14:52,486 --> 02:14:55,434
Meera has forgotten the hostel key.

1656
02:14:55,514 --> 02:14:57,593
Sir! Turn back towards the hostel.

1657
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:02,092
Be careful.

1658
02:15:04,113 --> 02:15:05,897
Meera!

1659
02:15:06,136 --> 02:15:07,207
Meera!

1660
02:15:08,071 --> 02:15:09,010
Meera!

1661
02:15:16,934 --> 02:15:18,498
Leave me.

1662
02:15:25,798 --> 02:15:27,284
Meera!

1663
02:15:32,349 --> 02:15:33,657
Meera!

1664
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:17,580
Someone has come. Let us go.

1665
02:16:28,757 --> 02:16:32,535
Meera! What happened?

1666
02:16:32,882 --> 02:16:34,236
What happened?
- Brother!

1667
02:16:34,874 --> 02:16:35,986
Shankar.

1668
02:16:36,172 --> 02:16:38,917
What happened? Who did this to you?

1669
02:16:40,205 --> 02:16:41,999
Vishwa.
- Vishwa!

1670
02:16:42,843 --> 02:16:49,037
Please save my child.

1671
02:16:49,183 --> 02:16:51,623
I will surely save.

1672
02:16:52,973 --> 02:16:54,589
Doctor! Fast.

1673
02:16:54,669 --> 02:16:57,296
Please tell brother
that I made mistake.

1674
02:16:57,376 --> 02:16:59,189
I will tell.

1675
02:16:59,269 --> 02:17:01,328
Will he forgive me?

1676
02:17:01,408 --> 02:17:03,046
He will forgive you.

1677
02:17:03,126 --> 02:17:04,628
Doctor! Fast.

1678
02:17:04,708 --> 02:17:06,527
I made mistake.

1679
02:17:06,675 --> 02:17:08,131
Your brother will forgive you.

1680
02:17:08,211 --> 02:17:10,771
Please tell brother to forgive me.

1681
02:17:27,952 --> 02:17:29,121
Sir!

1682
02:17:32,643 --> 02:17:35,860
We could not save Shankar.

1683
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:38,158
We have to perform surgery
and take out the baby.

1684
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:40,884
7 months... Premature baby.

1685
02:17:41,735 --> 02:17:42,939
Meera!

1686
02:18:22,907 --> 02:18:24,450
Look!

1687
02:18:27,564 --> 02:18:29,397
He will not survive.

1688
02:18:30,553 --> 02:18:33,639
People have assembled here.
Let us go away.

1689
02:18:42,441 --> 02:18:45,961
Some unknown persons
admitted you here

1690
02:18:46,041 --> 02:18:48,904
when you met with an
accident outside the hospital.

1691
02:18:49,206 --> 02:18:51,935
It has been 4 weeks
since you were admitted.

1692
02:18:52,125 --> 02:18:54,709
You had gone into trans-coma.

1693
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:13,880
Get down.

1694
02:19:36,153 --> 02:19:38,567
'If I had told the truth
to Narasimhan on that day'

1695
02:19:38,997 --> 02:19:40,768
'you would not have
become an orphan today.'

1696
02:19:43,611 --> 02:19:48,399
'But if I tell the truth now,
his sister will become a widow.'

1697
02:19:50,954 --> 02:19:54,009
'Let this truth remain with me.'

1698
02:20:26,129 --> 02:20:31,344
If my tears will make you cry

1699
02:20:31,424 --> 02:20:33,478
I will never cry again.

1700
02:20:34,199 --> 02:20:37,737
You should always be smiling.

1701
02:20:43,691 --> 02:20:47,012
From now, I will live for you.

1702
02:21:28,238 --> 02:21:29,739
Narasimha!

1703
02:21:45,413 --> 02:21:47,135
Narasimha!

1704
02:21:52,020 --> 02:21:53,309
Ma!

1705
02:22:01,048 --> 02:22:03,435
I will kill her
if anyone comes near.

1706
02:22:06,204 --> 02:22:08,042
Please do not harm my daughter.

1707
02:22:08,258 --> 02:22:11,346
Please leave her.

1708
02:22:13,288 --> 02:22:15,054
Please leave her.

1709
02:22:17,177 --> 02:22:18,406
Chandan!

1710
02:22:19,784 --> 02:22:20,786
Come.

1711
02:22:49,598 --> 02:22:50,998
No, Shankar.

1712
02:22:52,022 --> 02:22:53,367
No!

1713
02:22:55,671 --> 02:22:56,993
I will kill her.

1714
02:23:13,201 --> 02:23:16,469
You killed my sister
in front of my eyes.

1715
02:23:27,553 --> 02:23:29,640
He says she is his sister...

1716
02:23:37,660 --> 02:23:42,227
How could you hit a pregnant girl?

1717
02:23:56,881 --> 02:24:01,468
He should have lived
happily with his parents.

1718
02:24:01,814 --> 02:24:03,911
But you made him an orphan.

1719
02:24:12,809 --> 02:24:18,725
You did not allow a sister
to ask for pardon from her brother.

1720
02:24:20,211 --> 02:24:22,716
Will you tell brother to forgive me?

1721
02:25:22,326 --> 02:25:24,586
I made a mistake on that day.

1722
02:25:25,623 --> 02:25:27,461
Let it not happen today again.

1723
02:25:28,379 --> 02:25:29,720
Your daughter...

1724
02:25:31,926 --> 02:25:35,222
I did not come here for
the sake of your daughter.

1725
02:25:36,168 --> 02:25:38,154
Neither for the sake of my parents.

1726
02:25:38,234 --> 02:25:39,360
But to say that he is your soul mate

1727
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,101
who can give up his
life for your sake.

1728
02:25:42,222 --> 02:25:43,370
Shankara!
