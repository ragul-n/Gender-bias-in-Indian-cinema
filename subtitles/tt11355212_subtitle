1
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,158
'Wear your mask properly
Maintain social distance'

2
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:31,603
'Wash your hands frequently'

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,907
'Take your vaccine on your turn
Let us eradicate Corona'

4
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:38,194
'No animals or birds were harmed
during the making of this film'

5
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,971
Hello, everyone.

6
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,315
Slum clearance...

7
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,312
is getting rid of people
living in the slums.

8
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,384
Isolating these people
is what happens here.

9
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:47,405
This is the biggest housing board built by
the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board.

10
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:49,210
This is Kaveri Nagar.

11
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:53,126
Kaveri Nagar in OMR-Thoraipakkam...
is well known in Chennai.

12
00:01:57,274 --> 00:02:00,768
The story of Kaveri Nagar,
is a story of deceit.

13
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:06,989
Kaveri Nagar is about 30km
from Chennai city.

14
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,982
These people, who hail from
various parts of the city...

15
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,210
...the real residents of Chennai,

16
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:15,706
...are locked away like refugees here.

17
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,506
All these people are daily wagers.

18
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:24,307
They work as domestic help,
sell fish, drive auto rickshaws, etc.

19
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,648
The displacement has taken
their incomes away...

20
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:29,914
...thereby the education of their children.

21
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,101
For medical emergencies...

22
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,133
...they still depend on the
Royapettah Govt. Hospital.

23
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:50,035
Their new houses should have been built
at or around their existing homes.

24
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,326
The politicians took
money to clear the slums

25
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,554
along the river banks
where they lived...

26
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,858
and gave the land to
corporate companies,

27
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:07,891
shopping malls,
and private medical colleges.

28
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,194
Right now, Kaveri Nagar houses...

29
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,229
...close to 250,000 people.

30
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,184
Many sold their houses
to continue living in the streets.

31
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:23,290
It's like snatching a bird from its nest
and locking it up in a cage.

32
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,594
This is their life today.

33
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,662
The police have declared Kaveri Nagar,
as a Prime Crime Zone.

34
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,272
They are monitored 24x7 like prisoners.

35
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,651
There are CCTV cameras everywhere.

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,608
From their perspective,
this is a...

37
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:44,294
' JAIL '

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,403
Come, let's go into their lives
and see what it's like.

39
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,834
' KARNA '

40
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,792
Hey, hey!

41
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,674
What do you think you're doing?

42
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:15,130
Bro, I'll get down at Kaveri Nagar.
Keep going!

43
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,050
Going to Kaveri Nagar? I got you, brother.

44
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,546
Just one stop away, ma'am
he'll be out soon.

45
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:20,659
Okay.

46
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,234
Please don't mind, ma'am.

47
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,798
Madam, you work for
an IT company, is it?

48
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,104
Yes.

49
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,446
You'd get about
50-100 thousand, a month?

50
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:34,829
Hmm.

51
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:38,938
What a life, brother! We live in the same
city but we can barely make a hundred bucks.

52
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,126
These folks come here and
make hundreds of thousands.

53
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,125
Isn't that right, bro?

54
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:45,581
I'm burning my back driving
this everyday, and for what? 300 bucks.

55
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,810
What do we do?

56
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:50,611
They are fans of the government
that chased us away.

57
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,298
These days, it's so easy to set up an
IT Company. Everything is free.

58
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,333
But try getting a loan
to buy an auto rickshaw?

59
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,098
"Get me, that. Get me, this" and what not?
They drive us nuts, bro!

60
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:02,630
Let it go, bro!
Why talk about our stinky lives?

61
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:07,392
My my, do you smell the perfume?
It's getting the vehicle high!

62
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:08,928
Hello, can I get your number?

63
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,694
Are you seriously hitting on me?

64
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,130
- Please stop the auto now.
- Wait wait...

65
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:14,074
Did you just abuse me?

66
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:15,571
You think we locals are scumbags?

67
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,914
I'll stab you and then cut you into pieces.

68
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,448
- Brother, please don't.
- Shall I do it?

69
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,406
Bro let her go.
She ran her mouth by mistake.

70
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,187
The mere sight of us
makes you run your mouth, eh?

71
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,093
- I'll scrape your tongue out.
- Sorry, brother.

72
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:28,013
She made a mistake.
Let it go, bro.

73
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,664
What do you mean "let it go"?

74
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:32,352
She questioned my birth.
I can't let it go.

75
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,541
Wait, till I slice your mouth away!

76
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,384
Sorry brother! It was a mistake.

77
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:37,728
What? Brother?

78
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,686
Who is your brother?

79
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,261
Sorry, sir. My bad, sir.

80
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,334
Who said you can call me "Sir"?

81
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,563
Sorry brother. No no, sir.

82
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,750
Alright. Pay me your
fine for slandering.

83
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,747
- Give me your phone.
- It's an iPhone!

84
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,245
It's worth 50 thousand.

85
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,587
And I... shall take the iPhone.

86
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:55,891
- It's just a phone, let it go.
- Get going.

87
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,387
That's Karna. A small time thief.

88
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:02,419
But he gets beaten up by cops,
like he's a big time criminal.

89
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,717
Don't cry, Karna.

90
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:09,946
Don't cry.

91
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:12,173
It's okay, it's okay.

92
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,010
Sir...

93
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,275
Sir!

94
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,314
What now?

95
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,579
Get me a smoke, sir!

96
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:24,115
Shall I get you some liquor as well?

97
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,267
That's up to you, sir!

98
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:27,034
If you did, you'd be
my guardian angel.

99
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,144
Haven't you had enough
with the beating?

100
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,448
Sir, my body aches
from the beating.

101
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,138
My throat hurts.

102
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,019
I'll take a few puffs to easy my pain.

103
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,478
Just get me one, sir.

104
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:38,707
Come on, boy.

105
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:40,051
This isn't right.

106
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,701
- I'm not supposed to...
- Just one, sir. Please.

107
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:47,731
Sir...

108
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,998
Who's going to light it?

109
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,803
That too?

110
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,835
Such is my life.

111
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:08,352
' RAAKI '

112
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,645
What's up, mate?

113
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:18,989
Here to pray?

114
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,525
Well, no...

115
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,176
I heard they sell 'packets' here.

116
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:24,403
What packets?

117
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,861
Chief, I mean joints.
The dope.

118
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:29,702
I have a packet of holy ash,
feel free to pray and take it.

119
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,160
Bro, 'Beeda Shop' Durai sent me over.

120
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,888
Beeda Shop Durai?

121
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,538
You should always
mention the name first.

122
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,187
You think I sell candies that
I can handover immediately?

123
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,838
Such amateurs! Give me a hundred.

124
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,798
Hundred?

125
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,294
It's only 50 bucks on ECR.

126
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,022
Go ahead and get it there.

127
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:47,061
Bro, hold on...

128
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,557
Don't get pissed.

129
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:50,517
Give me a hand.

130
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:53,549
Brother...

131
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,968
The 50 bucks stuff is crap.

132
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,349
I've got the 'real' stuff for you.

133
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,269
- Ask me how...
- How?

134
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,917
The original stuff - 'Idukki Gold'.

135
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:06,182
Certified original stuff.

136
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,488
Look now...

137
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:08,717
Isn't it brown?

138
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,637
Take a close look at it...

139
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,866
See that it's green?

140
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,363
Looks brown from afar...

141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,053
and green up close.

142
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,549
This is how you know it's good stuff.

143
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:18,778
- Get it?
- Get this...

144
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,813
Why did you hit me?
We were just talking!

145
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:23,155
Couldn't you tell from the slap
that I am a certified cop?

146
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,422
Damn you cops!

147
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,806
Come on, guys!

148
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:29,299
If you don't let us do our business,
how will the nation grow?

149
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,603
India will grow once you
scumbags disappear.

150
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:37,363
Meet Raaki from the Two-Storey Gang
of Kaveri Nagar.

151
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,090
This is his sister, Maria Pushpam.

152
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,086
Raaki is big fish
in his business.

153
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,506
And he learnt the trade from...

154
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:46,694
This is not a hand.

155
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,154
It's a gun!

156
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,690
A gun?

157
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:52,378
If any of them dare to
mess with me...

158
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,568
Bam, bam, bam!

159
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,526
I'll just shoot them
and walk away.

160
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:01,133
Looks like your gun isn't
loaded these days?

161
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,587
Raaki has just one rival.
Manickam aka Manick.

162
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,699
Kaveri Nagar's Three-Storey Gang.

163
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,403
He came to Kaveri Nagar
from Pudhupettai in the year 2000.

164
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:11,923
"Don't you dare mess with me
I'll force you down the sea"

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,419
"I'll twist your hands and feet
I'll tear your face down."

166
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,104
"Don't pick a fight with us
Or it will be the end of you."

167
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,294
That's Manick.

168
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,138
The brave soldier of the ruling party.

169
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:24,557
- Leader, bless us.
- Welcome, boss!

170
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,205
His confidante, Kaliyan.

171
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,739
They also sell pot for a living.

172
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,194
The two gangs
are perpetually at war.

173
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,920
Who gets to sell here
and live here...

174
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,224
is decided by government and authority.

175
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:44,064
Like seeds that shoot up into
plants amidst all the filth...

176
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,099
Raaki and Manick rose up.

177
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:48,019
Raaki wants to kill Manick.

178
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,323
And Manick wants to kill Raaki.

179
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:07,296
To tackle the increasing crime rate, they
setup a new police station in Kaveri Nagar.

180
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:11,366
Custodial deaths, petrol bomb attacks...
this police station has seen it all.

181
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,826
A robbery case, sir.

182
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,130
A chain-snatching case, from OMR.

183
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,704
FIR has been filed.

184
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:20,006
"Three youth from Kaveri Nagar arrested."

185
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,542
The boss wants that as the headline.

186
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,810
We did nothing, sir!

187
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,461
I was there for painting work.

188
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,611
We know everything.
These guys...

189
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,685
- I'll take leave, sir.
- Sure, see you!

190
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:32,717
- Mr. Devaraj, keep me posted on previews.
- Sure.

191
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,790
Sir, I need a conduct certificate.

192
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:35,904
Can I meet the inspector?

193
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,939
He will be here soon.
Wait there.

194
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,243
The inspector has been in the
station for two hours now.

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,510
What is he doing, sir?

196
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,352
He's handling a high pressure job.
Sit there and wait.

197
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:52,186
Dude, what's happening inside?

198
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:56,256
He probably ate beans, looks
like it's 'Fast and Furious' in there.

199
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,363
It's fireworks inside.

200
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:35,654
Dude, stop laughing or he'll beat us up.
You know him, right?

201
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:47,251
Why did you laugh?

202
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,557
Sir... it's nothing.

203
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,054
Come on, why did you guys laugh?

204
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:50,822
Nothing, sir.

205
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:52,819
I won't hit you.
Tell me why.

206
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:55,046
For the last 2 hours,
you were inside the toilet.

207
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:58,234
It was like an action film with DTS sound.

208
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,034
It was pretty amazing, sir.

209
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,262
Fascinating sounds, sir.

210
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,530
What's the issue?

211
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,872
Well, it's piles.

212
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:08,832
Piles?

213
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,558
Piles is known in Tamil as "Moolam".

214
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,286
"Moolam"?

215
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:14,899
There are two kinds.

216
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:16,819
External and internal piles.

217
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:19,315
I suffer from internal piles.

218
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:23,078
Anal canal blocked with a huge growth.

219
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,766
No matter how hard I squeeze,
no shit comes out.

220
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,302
Only blood.

221
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,146
You think it's funny?

222
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,373
Should I show you how much it hurts?

223
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,638
- No, sir.
- Shall I show it to you?

224
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,557
Let me show you.
You laughed, right?

225
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,590
You crooks! Now watch me...

226
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,278
People out here deal with
pokes and strokes in the back...

227
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,314
- You guys find it funny?
- Sir, don't.

228
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:45,504
What happened, sir?

229
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,925
Why were they near the toilet?

230
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:49,344
I thought these accused guys
can sit in the back.

231
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,146
- You enjoy embarrassing me.
- Nothing like that, sir.

232
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:54,950
What do you mean, no?

233
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,218
Be happy!

234
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:59,405
- You think it is funny?
- Sorry, sir!

235
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,438
You idiots, what did you ask him?

236
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,320
We didn't say anything, sir!

237
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:05,165
He's here.

238
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:08,582
Previously, Inspector Perumal
was posted at Pondy Bazaar station.

239
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,541
He made money in every possible way.

240
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,459
The commissioner office received
many complaints on him.

241
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:16,186
He got suspended for taking a bribe.

242
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:19,027
And got his job back
by paying a bribe.

243
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,638
He didn't lie low
in Kaveri Nagar either.

244
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:25,862
He is raking in the moolah
by taking money from both gangs.

245
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,894
Perumal is corrupted, yes!

246
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,238
But he's a terror.

247
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,579
He had Kaveri Nagar
completely under his control.

248
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,413
'KALAI'

249
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,742
Ma...

250
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,430
Bro, stop the vehicle.

251
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:21,581
Hold on boy.
Driver, stop the vehicle.

252
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,115
- What happened, son?
- Stop the vehicle.

253
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,763
Brother, stop the vehicle.

254
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,750
Ma...

255
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:04,090
Ma!

256
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,315
Kalai...

257
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:08,890
Ma!

258
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:12,691
Ma!

259
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,381
My precious!

260
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:28,205
- Hey, Velamma!
- Yes, brother?

261
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:32,314
- Isn't that your son, Kalai?
- Yes, he just got released.

262
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,618
- Uncle Muthu!
- How are you, Kalai?

263
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:35,885
I'm fine, uncle.

264
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:38,266
So many years, for what?
Stealing two candy bars.

265
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,147
Damn them and their laws.

266
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,104
Don't worry. I've filed a case
at the World Court.

267
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,790
This government will have to give answers
for relocating us here.

268
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,902
Disaster resettlement in India.

269
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:50,592
Don't worry.

270
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,936
I'll see you around.

271
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,587
His name is Muthu Karuppan.

272
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,006
During the evacuation
of the Saidapet Slums...

273
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,310
he tried setting himself ablaze to protest.

274
00:15:58,349 --> 00:15:59,731
He was saved though.

275
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,459
He's a social activist.

276
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,416
Come in...

277
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:06,950
look at your father.

278
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,170
Dad...

279
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,355
He worked so hard to make a living
and spent it all on liquor.

280
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,005
With twitching limbs,
and no one around to help...

281
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:22,464
...he's curled up in a corner.

282
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:25,306
I didn't want to bother you with it,
so I didn't say anything.

283
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,496
Dad...

284
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,565
It's me, Kalai.

285
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,019
Dad!

286
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,936
You asked to see your son
before you die, right?

287
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:41,818
Now, you'll die in peace.

288
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,584
Dad!

289
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,504
Dad...

290
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,843
Bowl the ball, man.

291
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:51,648
Calm down, he is bowling.

292
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:54,950
Damn!

293
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,525
I'm not able to connect one shot.

294
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:01,824
Dude, wait for it, the next one is
a rocket shot!

295
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:03,859
"So Mita Sai Baba."

296
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,010
Bowl, dude!

297
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,307
Saw that? Raaki's rocket shot!

298
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:14,342
You're going to run
all the way to Kasimedu.

299
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,330
- Hey, Karna.
- Bowl, dude.

300
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,155
Which town are they from?

301
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,536
- Not sure!
- They probably think our hood is heaven.

302
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:40,378
How many more scapegoats
are going to be sent here?

303
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,142
We should put up a 'House Full' board
outside the hood and stop them.

304
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:47,789
Hey, baby!

305
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,325
Where are you from?

306
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:50,477
What does it matter to you?

307
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:51,515
Keep going.

308
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,203
They're from that area, dude!

309
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,662
You got owned!

310
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:56,275
That's a shady area, you wouldn't know.

311
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,120
I see!

312
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,462
We have a bet match tomorrow.
- Let's nail it!

313
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,074
Bro, Kalai is back from prison.
He's home now.

314
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,112
Dude!

315
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,491
Hurry up.

316
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:08,064
Kalai!

317
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:09,102
Dude, Kalai!

318
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,712
- Dude!
- How're you doing?

319
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,480
Hands off!

320
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,592
What? You forgot us, dude?

321
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,936
Who said I forgot?

322
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:17,549
My dad is dying.

323
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:18,816
Mom is picking rags.

324
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:20,275
Did you guys care to check?

325
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,094
- You all seem to be doing great!
- Come on, dude.

326
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,693
What do you mean we didn't care?

327
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,728
Your mom screams at us
if we offer money!

328
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,608
She thinks you were in jail
because of us.

329
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:30,950
She's pissed off with us.

330
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,294
Go ask your dad.

331
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,214
We bathe him once a week.

332
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:37,670
Who do you think got him medicines
and his favourite horse-seeds?

333
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,552
Not even your mom knows.

334
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,626
You think you are his only son?

335
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,966
Let it go, dude!

336
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,461
Why talk to a guy who
doesn't value friendship? Let's go.

337
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:49,843
Let's go.

338
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,146
Hop on, kid.

339
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:54,989
Guys, wait!

340
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,717
What?

341
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,291
I'll get you guys ice candies.

342
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,288
Friends?

343
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:16,608
"Not a penny with me,
but I sure am wealthy!"

344
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:20,064
"My friends are my fortune,
I have plenty!"

345
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:23,059
"He worries for one,
like a mother for a son."

346
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,592
"He'll be beside me,
through the long run."

347
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,587
"Lub dub, lub dub goes the heart."

348
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,005
"Friendship will never let it fall apart."

349
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:36,077
"Lub dub, lub dub goes the heart."

350
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:39,494
"Friendship will never let it fall apart."

351
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,566
"Cares for us like a father and mother."

352
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:46,061
"I won't lose him, where
can I find another?"

353
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:49,018
"Not a penny with me,
but I sure am wealthy!"

354
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,589
"My friends are my fortune,
I have plenty!"

355
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:55,507
"He worries for one, like
a mother for a son."

356
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:59,040
"He'll be beside me,
through the long run."

357
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:29,530
Dude, I'm so happy to see you.

358
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,102
Karna, enough with it!

359
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,712
My darling, come here!

360
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,514
I thought about you all the time.

361
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,008
Remember those amazing days in Nochikuppam?

362
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,312
- Heaven, dude!
- Hide and seek...

363
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,386
Playing by the sea...

364
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,726
You got your willy stuck in your fly.

365
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,146
I can go on, dude!

366
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,296
Right, Raaki?

367
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,331
Karna...

368
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,403
Kalai isn't like us.

369
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:04,666
Our buddy Kalai was the class topper!

370
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,394
We would have studied too...

371
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:08,467
if only they'd let us.

372
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:11,194
Those douche bags threw us out.

373
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,379
Raaki would have got a job
in the Railways through sports quota.

374
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,987
I would have sung and danced
my way into an orchestra.

375
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,445
Our lives are ruined now.

376
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,939
You ended up in jail as a kid.

377
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:29,126
We are listed as "Wanted".

378
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:31,853
Dude...

379
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,850
Don't hang out with us.

380
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,037
We are all thugs.

381
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,379
At-least you live a good life.

382
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:42,758
Otherwise, they'll brand you too.

383
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,330
You just got out of jail.

384
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,210
Don't be around here.

385
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,746
Leave.

386
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,472
Don't hang out with me, dude!

387
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,738
- You should do well.
- Dude...

388
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:59,347
- Yeah, don't hang out with us.
- You should forget us.

389
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:06,261
This is Papamma.

390
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,563
She delivers milk
for a living...

391
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,714
but she presses her faded sarees...

392
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,672
...and lives a life of dignity.

393
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:21,235
You call this house but
nothing is where it should be!

394
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,846
What are you looking for, dear?

395
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,805
Where could it go?
I left it here.

396
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:30,413
What are you raiding the house for?

397
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:32,832
It's not like your husband
left behind a fortune.

398
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,136
I'm looking for the gift
my friend gave me.

399
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:36,443
Which one?

400
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,285
The big white one...

401
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,088
...with a picture deity
Balaji on the back?

402
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,776
"So Mita Sai Baba."

403
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:44,851
Exactly, my angel!

404
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,117
Where's the phone, Mom?
Get it, please. I'm late.

405
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:48,269
I'll whack you!

406
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:51,955
You stole it from the milk booth agent.
You call that a gift?

407
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,221
Who do you think you're fooling?

408
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:56,256
Now that you know it,
give me the phone.

409
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:59,866
I gave it back to him saying
I found it on the ground.

410
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:00,672
Mom!

411
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,938
You know the phone is worth
25,000 rupees?

412
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:05,818
You speak as if you earned it.

413
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:06,931
Mom, give it to me.

414
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,160
I'll thrash you!

415
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:11,347
Why can't you make a honest living
instead of stealing?

416
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,421
Look at Mallika's son, Ramesh.

417
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,379
He goes to work and lives with dignity.

418
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:17,798
Why can't you be like that?

419
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:20,717
You should be proud
that your son fits in.

420
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:22,944
- But look at you, always complaining.
- Oh I see...

421
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:26,131
I have seen it all.

422
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,781
Someone will come teach you a lesson.

423
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,893
You wait, I'll teach you a lesson.

424
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,890
Eat something before you go.

425
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:33,928
Idiot.

426
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,387
Such a pain.

427
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:39,341
Sir, I studied till 12th grade.

428
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:40,992
I will do any job.

429
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,030
Where do you live?

430
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:42,835
Kaveri Nagar.

431
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,678
The one in Thoraipakkam?

432
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:45,830
Yes, sir.

433
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:47,789
Kaveri Nagar?
No jobs available here!

434
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,554
How come you have a board
that says you're hiring.

435
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:51,821
Yes, but that is for...

436
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,048
Kaveri Nagar guys will rob my
place if I hire them.

437
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:55,546
Why would a thief look for work?

438
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:58,387
- We don't hire people from there.
- No jobs here. Get going.

439
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:21,274
Dude, take this.

440
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:40,205
Oh no.

441
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,968
Hey! Who are you?

442
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,389
Who are you?

443
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,270
How dare you enter my house?

444
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:48,499
Stop screaming.

445
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:50,573
Mind your tone.

446
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,646
How dare you lock my doors
and windows? Get out!

447
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,259
I'll be out after they leave.

448
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:56,179
- I'll slap you. Get out!
- Shut up!

449
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:00,480
Selvam, not here.

450
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:01,594
He'll be down eventually.

451
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:04,550
I'm talking to you, you jerk.
Where are you going?

452
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,509
- Get out of here!
- All this over one laptop.

453
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,659
Play your hide and seek game
outside my place.

454
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:11,040
I'm not here to molest you.
Wait, I am going.

455
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:13,267
Get. Out.
Of my house.

456
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:14,765
It's not like I nailed you down.

457
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:15,994
Nail me down?

458
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,029
You'll nail me down in my own house?

459
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,218
Just wait till I cut you into pieces!

460
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,485
Where is the tool box?

461
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:23,443
Calm down!

462
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,246
Try coming closer now.
I'll cut you into pieces.

463
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,126
Are you really trying to scare
a gangster like me with a small knife?

464
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:30,816
Get out before I carve your face out.

465
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:33,350
I've got enough scars already.

466
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm going to kill you, "DVD" guy.

467
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,269
What "DVD"?

468
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:37,344
DVD player!

469
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,725
I'm a player, alright!
Let's play a game.

470
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:40,838
Sure, why not!

471
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,835
I've made fish curry.
Why don't you rest here?

472
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,446
Fish curry? Great, let me
change into a lungi.

473
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:46,291
Hey!

474
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,136
Idiot!

475
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:48,557
You're dead now!

476
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:50,094
What a devil.

477
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,283
I'll get you!

478
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:53,832
Where are you running away?

479
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,776
How are you, sister?
I'm going for a jog.

480
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,389
- Stop it, you thief.
- Move it, man!

481
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,554
- You half-trousers...
- Sister, stop that crazy woman!

482
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,267
- Why are you chasing me?
- Stop running!

483
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:02,995
You crash into my house.

484
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,685
I'm going to trash you, now.

485
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:05,875
Wait up!

486
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,565
- Damn, it's them.
- Sir, catch him.

487
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,598
- Here you are.
- Arrest me, sir!

488
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,018
Lock me up for any case, sir!

489
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,438
Arrest me, sir!

490
00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:16,090
If I see you again,
I'll cook you alive.

491
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,586
- Take me, sir.
- We arrest you every week.

492
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,314
It's just a waste of money.

493
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,696
Look at her staring.

494
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,731
Wait till we break your legs one day.

495
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,806
Get going, woman.

496
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:29,262
Hey, you!

497
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,029
Hi!

498
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:36,134
Is your dad an MLA?
How did they let you out so soon?

499
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:39,974
Dealing with cops is child's play to me.

500
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:41,818
Oh, you think you are some big shot?

501
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:43,930
Should I come up?

502
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,274
Let's play a game?

503
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,693
Damn you, murderer!

504
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:53,184
He's studied till 12th Grade.

505
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:54,222
I've done a check.

506
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,104
He is a decent guy.

507
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,062
Our customer Anand
recommended him.

508
00:26:58,598 --> 00:26:59,712
Where are you from?

509
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,941
I live in Saidapet, sir.

510
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:03,552
Work diligently, okay?

511
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,011
Go ahead.
Start working.

512
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,163
Thank you, sir.

513
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,261
We've been waiting for a long time.

514
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,024
Yeah, we have no buses...
but there are no share-autos either.

515
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:48,211
Anyone for Kaveri Nagar?

516
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,706
Sister, move in.
Make space.

517
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:53,510
Going to Kaveri Nagar?
Get in, sister.

518
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,795
- Are you coming for the movie?
- No, I'm not.

519
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,299
Are you from Kaveri Nagar?

520
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:30,952
Yes.

521
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,986
The manager said you are from Saidapet.

522
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:34,790
Uhm...

523
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:36,979
Nobody hires anyone from Kaveri Nagar.

524
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:39,514
That's why I lied.

525
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,626
Please don't rat me out.

526
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:42,664
Hmm.

527
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,352
And you are from?

528
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:46,389
Me?

529
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,075
T.Nagar.

530
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:54,950
Sister.

531
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:56,870
Das asked to buy some Biriyani.

532
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:58,483
Got cash?

533
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,904
- For how much?
- Fifteen bucks.

534
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,509
Here.

535
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:07,584
Look at that!

536
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,274
Our girl has a biriyani shop!

537
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,925
She's damn hot!

538
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:13,498
She's got a string of boys guys
lined up behind her.

539
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:15,686
Dude, I've already tugged at her strings.

540
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,874
She's hot stuff.

541
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,218
She's mine!

542
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,256
Got it?

543
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:23,942
Okay...

544
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:25,210
How about some biriyani?

545
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:29,318
You'll get the girl.
I'll get what? Biriyani?

546
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:30,547
Come on.

547
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:31,661
Hands off.

548
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:34,349
People sacrifice their lives
for their friends. Come on.

549
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:37,152
- You come along too, Shorty.
- You are such a pain!

550
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,304
Hello, there.

551
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:40,339
Selling biriyani, I see.

552
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,914
Hello, you crook.

553
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:44,026
You called me a crook?

554
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,827
Twisted roads make twisted people.
Life lessons.

555
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,517
- Good one.
- Thanks, mate!

556
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,706
- Chicken or Beef?
- Pork.

557
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,624
I see, no wonder it's sizzling hot.

558
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,658
What? Double meaning?

559
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,078
Nope. Just one meaning.

560
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:01,536
You disturb my business,
and I'll shove it in.

561
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:04,608
- She says she will shove it in!
- Is this how you treat customers?

562
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:07,066
Does the biriyani come with
chunks of meat?

563
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,254
For 15 bucks?
You only get 'kuska' rice.

564
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:10,445
Just 'kuska'?

565
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:12,595
Just 'kuska'.
Did you expect Anushka then?

566
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:13,709
Ah, Anushka!

567
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:15,744
- She's super hot.
- I know, right?

568
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:17,102
Who is the lucky guy?
- Who knows.

569
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:18,778
All I know is this one's mine.

570
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,736
- Hey!
- Three plates of biriyani.

571
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:21,888
First pay up the money.

572
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,808
We are not going anywhere.

573
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:26,112
Show me the money
before you touch the 'kuska'.

574
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,301
Dude, got any money on you?

575
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:31,757
- Now I know why I was invited.
- Don't be silly, dude. Give it.

576
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:33,293
You guys are everything to me.

577
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,597
Here you go.
Give me some biriyani.

578
00:30:38,246 --> 00:30:39,936
Look at you grab the plate!

579
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:41,741
Serve some more rice, miss.

580
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,432
Here!

581
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,462
Just one cup for 15 rupees?

582
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,995
Did you expect a bucket?
This is all you get for 15 rupees.

583
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,838
I gave you 50 rupees, not 15!

584
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:54,912
- Take it.
- I need my change!

585
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,757
I won't give it to you!

586
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:57,216
Then I won't return the plate.

587
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:58,982
Pour some more.

588
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,787
Should I empty it on your head?

589
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,746
She's got a big mouth.

590
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,699
Shorty, how do you like it?

591
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:09,696
- It's good.
- It's average.

592
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,194
- Hey!
- I was joking, it's good.

593
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,531
What about the change?

594
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:19,296
This isn't going to work out.
Let's get going.

595
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:22,291
So you quit studying to sell biryani?

596
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,480
Why do you keep stirring me up?

597
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:26,554
Because you stir my heart, babe!

598
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,051
Double meaning again?

599
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,971
Single meaning again.

600
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,506
You still didn't answer my question!

601
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,003
Why didn't you continue school?

602
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,616
Who'll pay for it?
Your dad?

603
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:37,013
So you'll go to school
if I pay for it?

604
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:38,933
I can tell from your face
that you don't have money.

605
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:40,800
Don't look at my face
when I offer money.

606
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:42,950
Look at my generous heart.
Life lessons.

607
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:43,757
See you around!

608
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:45,638
- Do shower tomorrow.
- Fool!

609
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:46,677
Bye!

610
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:49,594
What's up, Zamin?
How's the business going?

611
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:50,438
Going good.

612
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,936
Super!
It this beef rice?

613
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:53,587
- Chicken rice.
- I see...

614
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:55,277
Where are we going?

615
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,736
There, my sister has come!

616
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,230
What's the matter?

617
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,766
Want to have beef rice?

618
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:04,032
I don't like beef rice.

619
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:05,837
You don't like it?

620
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,179
Fine, do you like the person
who is cooking it?

621
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,099
I've seen your sister around.

622
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,862
So... you like her?

623
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:14,669
I do.

624
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:17,510
Are you pimping me out?
Is this why you got me here?

625
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:18,317
Get lost!

626
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:19,200
Sister!

627
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:20,160
Come on...

628
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,198
Get here, Raaki!

629
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:23,733
Sister!

630
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:26,611
Look! He's got no bad habits.

631
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,301
He wants nothing from you, but you.

632
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,606
I'll thrash you.

633
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,912
Don't you dare come home.

634
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,370
- Well done, sister.
- Little punk trying to act grownup.

635
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:35,597
What happened?

636
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:36,635
Failure.

637
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,938
Get a take-away from Zamin.
We'll need munchies.

638
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,622
Dude, keep calm.
I'll handle it.

639
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,966
Okay? Let's go.

640
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:46,696
Here...

641
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,763
How long will you keep
saying no to marriage?

642
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,352
If I wanted to be married...

643
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:56,525
I would have said yes when
Laundry Murugan proposed to me.

644
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:58,944
I can't imagine a life
leaving my brother alone.

645
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,477
He was a little boy then,
he is a grown man now.

646
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,664
He wants good things for you.

647
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:09,926
I'll turn Kaveri Nagar
upside down for you, just say yes.

648
00:33:09,965 --> 00:33:13,114
I can't explain it!
If we had a mother, you'd understand.

649
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,034
How do I tell my younger brother?

650
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,376
Think of me as our mother.

651
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,827
My get my periods
only once a year.

652
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:27,898
The first doctor I went to
said there's a tumour.

653
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:31,315
Another doctor said we'd have to
remove my uterus.

654
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,539
How can I get married
with such complications?

655
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:40,339
What if my in-laws throw me out
for being infertile?

656
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:41,875
You think you can bear that?

657
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:45,907
Let me live like this.

658
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,326
I'll die someday.

659
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:52,627
Think of me as your mother,
and cremate me.

660
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:58,003
Hey!

661
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,536
Dude, don't cry.

662
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,608
We'll get her treated in
one of the rich hospitals.

663
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:05,646
Don't cry!

664
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:07,718
Dude...

665
00:34:08,294 --> 00:34:11,866
In a time when parents
abandon their own children...

666
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,786
look how my sister turned out.

667
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,858
She sacrificed her love for me.

668
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,470
She's thrown her life away.

669
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:19,509
Why?

670
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:22,925
Don't cry.

671
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:24,691
Please...

672
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:29,683
If my mother was alive, she'd have never
let this happen to my sister.

673
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,523
It is finally hitting me...

674
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,405
we really need our mother.

675
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:37,594
We're all here for you, man!

676
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:39,014
Why do you say that?

677
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:43,430
But who is the mother I knew?

678
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,352
Who?

679
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,734
It's my sister, dude.

680
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:50,611
She didn't want me to be alone,
but she's been so lonely.

681
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,720
Is she just a sister to me?

682
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,717
She's my mother!

683
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:57,946
Don't cry, dude.

684
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:04,243
I'm going to make my sister's wedding
the grandest Kaveri Nagar has ever seen!

685
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,357
What do you mean "I"?

686
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,395
What am I here for?

687
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,966
- WE are going to do it.
- We'll make it happen!

688
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:10,310
Let's do this, dude!

689
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:11,349
Done.

690
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,610
Good morning, sir!

691
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:17,088
- Good morning!
- Check zero, please.

692
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:20,678
What's for lunch today?
Curd rice?

693
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:23,405
See you!

694
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:29,626
I've never seen you in Kaveri Nagar.
I've been there for 5 years now.

695
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,237
What?

696
00:35:35,078 --> 00:35:36,154
Actually...

697
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:39,110
they accused me of stealing
as a child and put me in jail.

698
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:41,030
Just got out.

699
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,437
- For 250.
- Got change?

700
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,635
- Sir, want a bill?
- No need.

701
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,971
Move ahead, please.

702
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,752
Now that you know I was in jail...

703
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,749
...you don't want to
talk to me anymore, right?

704
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,051
Not really...

705
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,163
My younger brother is in jail too.

706
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,467
I was reminded of him.

707
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:37,286
"My scrambled eggs
Can I give you a kiss?"

708
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:40,666
"My shredded flatbread
Can I devour you?"

709
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:44,045
"My scrambled eggs
Can I give you a kiss?"

710
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,386
"My shredded flatbread
Can I devour you?"

711
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:50,650
"The kohl in your eyes
Messes with my heart."

712
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:53,914
"Why do you torment my poor soul?"

713
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:57,600
"The kohl in your eyes
Messes with my heart."

714
00:36:57,638 --> 00:37:00,979
"Why do you torment my poor soul?"

715
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,358
"When you walk closer to me
You're like a quarter of booze."

716
00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:07,738
"Come quench my thirst
Like purified mineral water."

717
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:11,117
"When you walk closer to me
You're like a quarter of booze."

718
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:14,496
"Come quench my thirst
Like purified mineral water."

719
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:17,875
"My scrambled eggs
Can I give you a kiss?"

720
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:21,293
"My shredded flatbread
Can I devour you?"

721
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,672
"My scrambled eggs
Can I give you a kiss?"

722
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,475
"My shredded flatbread
Can I devour you?"

723
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:28,514
Get away!

724
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:30,816
Why do you always point
a knife at me?

725
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:31,776
Here you go!

726
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:32,814
What's this?

727
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,078
Cash, dough, money...

728
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,307
What for?

729
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,805
You wanted to go to school!

730
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:40,646
There are so many children in Kaveri Nagar
who don't go to school.

731
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:41,952
Would you sponsor everyone?

732
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,795
I'm generous as Karna.

733
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:46,906
I'd give everything to Kaveri Nagar,
if I had the money!

734
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,672
I know what this money is for!

735
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,669
- Take you money and leave.
- Don't be stupid.

736
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:51,974
I never got to study.

737
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:54,394
At least one person in the family
should be educated.

738
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:55,584
Shut your face!

739
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:57,466
I stopped going to school
two years back.

740
00:37:57,504 --> 00:37:59,386
I was wearing my
sister's uniform yesterday.

741
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,307
Oh I see!

742
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,533
No wonder the uniform
was all tight and hot.

743
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,646
So, where is the sister?

744
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,258
I might kill you just about now.
You better get going!

745
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:11,904
I won't take money once given,
and won't return money once taken.

746
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:14,592
Make me your business partner.
I'll see you around.

747
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,128
"My scrambled eggs."

748
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,971
Hey, yellow T-shirt!

749
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,085
Wait up.

750
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:22,080
Take your money back.
Stop!

751
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:24,730
"My scrambled eggs
Can I give you a kiss."

752
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,805
"My shredded flatbread."

753
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,494
Go on, and dance.

754
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:30,720
The UN will declare the verdict soon.
Dance with joy!

755
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,141
Kill it, boys!

756
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:34,907
Quick!

757
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,094
Get going.

758
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:41,626
How dare you sell dope in our area?

759
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,507
Here comes OMR's owner.

760
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:45,504
Should I put up
a hoarding for you?

761
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,616
Who do you think you are, big mouth?

762
00:38:47,654 --> 00:38:50,611
How dare you peddle drugs in our area?
This is our zone!

763
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,453
- Raaki's already furious with you guys.
- What will he do?

764
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,603
- If he gets hold of you, you're dead!
- Whack him!

765
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,034
Ready?

766
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,952
"I'll beat you black and blue
And bend you backward."

767
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,526
Bowl to me.

768
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:59,424
I'm going to slay you guys today.

769
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,859
That's an old photo of mine.
I should tell them to update it.

770
00:41:12,883 --> 00:41:15,187
How did you get there on time?

771
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,146
Shorty told me you went alone.

772
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
- So I came after you.
- Dude!

773
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,139
I'll sort you out later.

774
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,251
Let it go,
we'll get them one day.

775
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,133
Where is the leader?
He said he'd be here.

776
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:26,822
I called him, he is on the way.

777
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:33,888
Turn the car around.

778
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:36,653
- Pandi, how are you?
- Good, sir!

779
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,534
- Hey, Suresh!
- Hello, sir!

780
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:40,877
- Hello, leader.
- Come in, sir!

781
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,106
- Hello, leader!
- Wait here.

782
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:44,178
- How are you doing, Sasi?
- I am good, brother.

783
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,710
Manick, where is the inspector?

784
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:50,938
- He's inside.
- Come with me. Stay here, rest of you.

785
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:53,472
It's become a habit for you guys!

786
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,584
Boss, they keep bothering us!

787
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,656
- Perumal sir, hello!
- Welcome.

788
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:06,874
Come here.

789
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,026
Do you have any brains?

790
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:09,830
Don't know how to speak to an officer?

791
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,019
- You thought I am your servant?
- No, leader.

792
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,365
Let's go.

793
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,835
- What happened, sir?
- Go and ask your inspector.

794
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:17,587
Now you know our clout?
See you around.

795
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,853
- I'm going to smash his mouth in.
- Buzz off.

796
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:21,427
Get going, fool.

797
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:23,155
Keep walking.

798
00:42:23,194 --> 00:42:26,765
These days we can commit
pretty much any crime.

799
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:29,222
As long as we're part of
a political party, or start one.

800
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,643
Then let's start one.

801
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:32,563
Start one?

802
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,022
What do we call it?

803
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,250
Karna, Raaki Welfare Association?

804
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,784
Sounds good.
Let's add your mom's name as well!

805
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,973
No, she already talks way too much!

806
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:43,315
Make sure my birthday celebration
is nice and grand, okay?

807
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:45,120
- Of course, leader!
- I'll see you around.

808
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,766
Boys, he's letting you go.
Get going.

809
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:51,533
- Can we leave?
- Yes, get going.

810
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:52,954
- How come?
- You know him, right?

811
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:54,259
Not again!
Get going.

812
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:57,331
- Sir, we never got that biryani we ordered.
- Why don't I home deliver it?

813
00:42:57,446 --> 00:42:58,214
Cocky!

814
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:01,018
We pay him money too, right?
That's why he let us go!

815
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,706
Oh, shut up. We never got even
for a broken head.

816
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:08,890
Dude, they've literally
broken your skull.

817
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,886
- How many stitches?
- 12.

818
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,998
Look what they've done to him.
Say something!

819
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:16,070
- Dude, not now. After the elections.
- Damn with the elections.

820
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,374
I'll crack their shells
and feed you brain curry.

821
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:19,450
Let's go.

822
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:21,600
Calm down, dude.
Let's do it together.

823
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:23,405
I'll take care of it.
Come on, buddy.

824
00:43:23,443 --> 00:43:25,018
Don't be so pissed!

825
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:27,296
Brother, chicken gravy for 20 rupees.
Eggs for 10 rupees.

826
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,086
Girl, get me another egg!

827
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,237
- This one's your second.
- Okay, fine!

828
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,696
- What?
- One plate rice and an egg.

829
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:37,843
Dude, what's with her?

830
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,915
Yesterday, she had only one board.
Today there is three.

831
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,027
Looks like her business is booming.

832
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:45,139
What did you do, Karna?

833
00:43:45,178 --> 00:43:46,944
So Mitta Sai Baba!

834
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:49,978
I can't tell you.
It's the secret to picking up a chick.

835
00:43:53,357 --> 00:43:54,816
Brother, here you go!

836
00:43:56,698 --> 00:43:58,502
'Desappan Biryani Stall'

837
00:43:58,541 --> 00:43:59,654
Who is this guy?

838
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:01,574
Don't be disrespectful.
He's my dad!

839
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:03,533
I see you're sentimental
about your daddy.

840
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:06,029
I've set aside some biryani for you.
Want to eat?

841
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,986
- Awwww!
- What "Awwww"?

842
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,674
I made the egg and chicken curry
using your money.

843
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:13,186
It turned out good.
Everything got sold!

844
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,592
Oh, I see.

845
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,395
- You pitched in too.
- Indeed.

846
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:20,083
Which means you're my partner.
Here is your share.

847
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,426
Save up this money.
It'll be handy for the wedding.

848
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:23,846
Whose wedding?

849
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:24,845
Our wedding.

850
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:25,920
Excuse me?

851
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,723
- Don't dream about getting married to me.
- Oh, really?

852
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:32,064
I will marry a guy who works in IT
and settle down in America.

853
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,829
American dream in
your egg curry, I see.

854
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,763
- Of course, what did you expect?
- A bit too much.

855
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:39,144
When we were in Ayodhi Kuppam,
we had a stall in Marina beach.

856
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:42,701
There was a guy with an Audi car
who drooled over me.

857
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:43,507
Audi car?

858
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:45,888
He even had a tattoo with my name.

859
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:47,578
He got your name inked?

860
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:49,498
But I still turned him down, you know?

861
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,840
Why did you turn him down, Miss World?

862
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,298
He had no hair.
He was bald.

863
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:55,987
I've got a full head of hair though.

864
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:57,485
Yes, but do you have
an Audi car?

865
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,595
I've got no Audi car,
but when I dance, I'm an all-star.

866
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:02,899
- Get going.
- Hey, Malar!

867
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,014
Hey!

868
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,637
"Miss or Missus?"

869
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,939
"Miss or Missus?"

870
00:45:25,978 --> 00:45:27,014
Hi!

871
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:30,816
"Sassy, slinky, saucy, fancy
This girl that I fell for."

872
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:34,387
"Brothers, buddies and my boys
Hear this gaana-western fusion."

873
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:37,459
"Caught in the feeling
I'm oozing poetry."

874
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:40,954
"Intoxicated in this narrow street
I'm scheming ways to woo you."

875
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:44,294
"She's the one for me."

876
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:47,712
"Put on your fancy shirt, dude
I'm getting married."

877
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,130
"Am I lucky or what?
Oh, the look she threw me"

878
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:54,163
"I landed this bombshell as my lover."

879
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,813
"Miss or Missus?"

880
00:45:57,581 --> 00:46:00,422
"Miss or Missus?"

881
00:46:16,973 --> 00:46:20,314
"The nightingale of housing board
She cusses like a sailor"

882
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:23,578
"I swooned at her expletives
I gotta marry her."

883
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,294
"Miss or Missus?"

884
00:46:33,446 --> 00:46:35,750
"Miss or Missus?"

885
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:40,704
"She's like gizzard curry
She's buzzing with energy."

886
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:44,083
"Every snap of her fingers
Can charge a phone."

887
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:47,386
"She's made herself a home
In my heart."

888
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:50,803
"Oh, girl with the mole
Boil me like turmeric in water."

889
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,144
"My love for you pours out
Like tap from water."

890
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:57,638
"Make me a chunky meat
In your 'kuska' rice, dear."

891
00:46:57,677 --> 00:47:00,979
"Scram, boy Just get out."

892
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,784
"You're a swine I'm solid."

893
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,435
"Your antics won't work here"

894
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:05,933
"I'm original teak You're fake"

895
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:07,853
"I'll smash your nose"

896
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,542
"I'm the power You're sugar."

897
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:11,270
"Why can't I touch you?"

898
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:12,960
"You fizzy drink
Come bloom for me"

899
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,573
"I'll build you a tower of love"

900
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,339
"I'm a don
You're quite the scene."

901
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:18,605
"Hop onto my van."

902
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:20,294
- Oh, no. Run!
- Catch him.

903
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:26,784
"My love is strong
Like beef tailbone soup."

904
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:30,010
"Babe, we're strong as the Fort
Our life's rock solid"

905
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,389
"I'll earn a living pedaling rickshaw
And you'll live like a queen."

906
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:36,806
"You'll lead a fancier life
Than the Queen in London"

907
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:40,186
"I have a yellow sacred thread
Ready for our wedding"

908
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,910
"I'm like the Rama to you, Sita
Pick me already."

909
00:47:43,949 --> 00:47:47,290
"Sassy, slinky, saucy, fancy
This girl that I fell for."

910
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:50,707
"Brothers, buddies and my boys
Hear this gaana-western fusion."

911
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:53,894
"Caught in the feeling
I'm oozing poetry."

912
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:56,966
"Intoxicated in this narrow street
I'm scheming ways to woo you."

913
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:59,155
"Miss or Missus?"

914
00:48:00,384 --> 00:48:02,496
"Miss or Missus?"

915
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,914
He is such a nasty guy.

916
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:07,502
Don't waste your time
talking about him.

917
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,331
I'll sort him out someday.

918
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,590
Hey, Kaliyan!

919
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,470
It fell right on the head, right?

920
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:19,430
You moron!

921
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,773
We gave it back to you, didn't we?

922
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,885
- I'm coming for you.
- Come at us.

923
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:24,998
Get up, dude!

924
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:27,278
- Let's break them into pieces.
- Don't let them get away!

925
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:29,453
Dude, run.

926
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:34,867
Go, go, go.

927
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:37,440
If they catch us,
we'd be minced meat.

928
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:40,013
We'll be gone by then.

929
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,723
Get the ladder from there!

930
00:48:56,486 --> 00:48:58,099
Put it up.

931
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,981
Hold tight.

932
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:02,784
- Dude, let's jump.
- Are you crazy?

933
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:06,125
- We'll crack all our bones.
- They'll rip us apart anyway, just jump.

934
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,194
Climb up, take my hand.

935
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:13,114
Come on.

936
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:20,986
This way.

937
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:24,173
You think you can run away?

938
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:27,898
Raaki, if I catch you,
you are dead!

939
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:30,586
Safe landing!

940
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:32,582
"Catch me if you can!"

941
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,811
I won't spare you.

942
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,501
Dude, run!

943
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,766
I will rip you guys into pieces!

944
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:39,725
Let's have a party tonight!

945
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,146
No way!

946
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:44,448
I didn't see any news on TV.

947
00:49:44,486 --> 00:49:45,600
Get my towel!

948
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:46,714
Here you go, leader!

949
00:49:46,752 --> 00:49:48,058
You are always on your phone!

950
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:48,979
So, Manickam...

951
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:50,822
Yes, leader!

952
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:52,397
Taking this to the police...

953
00:49:52,435 --> 00:49:53,856
...registering a complaint...

954
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,699
why go through all the trouble?

955
00:49:55,738 --> 00:49:57,350
- It'll go on forever.
- Okay, leader.

956
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:58,464
Just finish him off.

957
00:49:58,502 --> 00:50:00,653
- What say?
- Fair enough, leader.

958
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:05,530
Manickam probably pressured the counsellor,
now the inspector will warn us.

959
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,830
No, you don't have to come here.

960
00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:11,213
I'll send.

961
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:14,438
Hey.

962
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,819
The guy who got hurt,
Kaliyan, hasn't complained.

963
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:18,432
No call from the counselor either.

964
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,698
- What does that mean?
- Well, sir...

965
00:50:20,736 --> 00:50:24,000
You've probably got two days
before they put up your obituaries.

966
00:50:24,038 --> 00:50:25,728
Sir, we won't let that happen.

967
00:50:25,766 --> 00:50:28,992
- Not if we beat them to it.
- Yes, sir!

968
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,066
Why are you always picking fights?

969
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:33,638
Won't you try and make
a life for yourselves?

970
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:35,635
Go now!

971
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,248
- See you, sir.
- See you.

972
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:38,707
- Raaki...
- Sir?

973
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:41,050
Dude, wait for me.

974
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:46,003
So, Raaki...

975
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:55,834
- Let's get going!
- What did Perumal say?

976
00:50:55,872 --> 00:50:59,136
I can't talk about it now,
but I'll tell you soon.

977
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:00,902
Here, eat!

978
00:51:02,899 --> 00:51:04,205
My mother made it.

979
00:51:04,243 --> 00:51:06,470
- I don't cook so well.
- Thought as much!

980
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:08,429
That's why I asked.

981
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,541
Just eat now, will you?

982
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:11,654
Who is she?

983
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,461
She's my girl.

984
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:15,341
She runs a biriyani stall
near the 4-storey building.

985
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:17,338
- What's your name?
- Rosa Malar.

986
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:21,485
You look so beautiful,
are you sure you are in love with him?

987
00:51:21,523 --> 00:51:24,403
Take your hands off me.
I'm talking here!

988
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,206
- You could have done better.
- He manage to woo me somehow.

989
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:29,702
- You mongrel.
- Why did you hit me, Ma?

990
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:32,621
You've got yourself a lovely girl.
Now lead a good life.

991
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:34,118
I'll take care of it.

992
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,766
Make him do the dishes
at your stall. He'll learn something.

993
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:41,338
Ma, stop talking.
Take your daughter-in-law's blessings.

994
00:51:41,376 --> 00:51:43,834
- Why did you hit me?
- I have to get her blessings.

995
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:46,560
Such a nice daughter-in-law.

996
00:51:46,598 --> 00:51:48,634
May you be blessed?

997
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,323
Great!

998
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:56,198
Karna?

999
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,307
What happened, sister?

1000
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:01,421
Where is Raaki?

1001
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:03,110
His phone isn't reachable either.

1002
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:05,606
I've also been trying for last 3 days!

1003
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,754
He never goes anywhere
without informing me.

1004
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:12,058
Don't be worried.

1005
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:13,632
I'll take care.

1006
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,590
I have a bad feeling about this.

1007
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:17,702
Go home, sister.

1008
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,378
Thank you, sir!

1009
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,298
Sir, fill 5 liters of petrol.

1010
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,910
Your first salary, is it?

1011
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,600
You are not going to treat me?

1012
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:35,290
Consider it done.

1013
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:38,208
Dude, have you seen Raaki?

1014
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:39,706
We're looking for him too.

1015
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:42,086
He said he'd come for a bet match.
Where is he?

1016
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,699
I'll punch your face in.

1017
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,350
I'm the one searching for him.

1018
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:46,939
- Let me know if you see him.
- Okay, buddy.

1019
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,344
I'll let you know if I see him.

1020
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:01,594
Hey, stop the vehicle.

1021
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:03,130
Where are you coming from?
Answer me.

1022
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:04,973
Are you drunk?

1023
00:53:05,011 --> 00:53:06,470
Come here!

1024
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:07,776
Why are you out so late?

1025
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:10,656
- Coming from work, sir.
- Go see the inspector.

1026
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:12,730
- Please, sir.
- Go on.

1027
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:14,008
Stop! Where are you
coming from?

1028
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:15,432
- From work.
- Show me your license.

1029
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:17,222
- Kalai Arasan, sir!
- Kalai Arasan?

1030
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,195
- Where are you going?
- The two-storeyed building.

1031
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:20,794
- Hey...
- Sir?

1032
00:53:23,712 --> 00:53:25,094
Do you know Raaki?

1033
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:27,091
I do, sir.
He is my friend.

1034
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,666
Call him now.

1035
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:30,854
Sir, I don't have a phone.

1036
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:31,968
Are you selling pot?

1037
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:34,464
No, sir!
I work at a petrol bunk.

1038
00:53:35,347 --> 00:53:38,803
He looks suspicious.
Check him.

1039
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,186
Sir...

1040
00:53:40,224 --> 00:53:41,914
Check him!

1041
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,157
No, sir. I really work
at a petrol bunk.

1042
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:46,291
- I am not lying.
- Why are you out so late?

1043
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,558
Take your hands off.

1044
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:49,248
Sir, please believe me!

1045
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:53,318
- Sir...
- Let go of my hand.

1046
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:55,123
You're a peddler, right?

1047
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:59,078
Sir, he's got money.

1048
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:00,499
Where is this cash from?

1049
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,266
It's my first salary, sir!

1050
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:03,763
Which fuel bunk?

1051
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,376
Saamy Service Station in Adayar.

1052
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:06,950
Got the phone number?

1053
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:08,794
- Sir, please don't.
- Tell me.

1054
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:11,405
I got the job by lying
I am from Saidapet.

1055
00:54:11,443 --> 00:54:13,786
If they find out I am from Kaveri Nagar,
I'll lose my job!

1056
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:16,090
I asked you for the
phone number.

1057
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,434
Sir, please don't.

1058
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:20,045
- Get him into the police jeep.
- Sir, please.

1059
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,005
Come on.

1060
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:22,733
- Move it.
- Please, sir!

1061
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:24,307
Sir, give me a minute.

1062
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:27,264
Look at him speeding away.
Catch him.

1063
00:54:29,107 --> 00:54:31,027
Here's the number, sir!

1064
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,982
Call this number.

1065
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:35,942
Yes, sir?

1066
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,246
Does a guy named Kalai
work at your bunk?

1067
00:54:38,285 --> 00:54:40,742
- Kalai?
- The one from Kaveri Nagar.

1068
00:54:41,587 --> 00:54:43,315
Sir, he said he was from Saidapet.

1069
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:45,158
No sir, he's from Kaveri Nagar.

1070
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:48,653
If you're hiring someone,
won't you do a background check?

1071
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:50,266
You should at least
get an ID proof.

1072
00:54:50,304 --> 00:54:51,686
How can you be so careless?

1073
00:54:51,725 --> 00:54:54,298
Actually, a well-known customer
recommended him.

1074
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,638
What if he slits your throat
and robs the bunk?

1075
00:54:58,406 --> 00:55:00,749
You're running a business.
Be careful, sir.

1076
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:03,206
Okay, sir.

1077
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,662
Be a good employee.

1078
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:09,773
If I get any complaint against you,
I'll skin you alive.

1079
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:12,230
Get him address
and send him away.

1080
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:14,227
Come with me.

1081
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:23,174
Dude, let it go.

1082
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:26,477
It's not like its some fancy job.
We'll find another one.

1083
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,626
Dude...

1084
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:32,736
Drink up your tea.
We'll deal with Perumal soon.

1085
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,536
Have you seen Raaki?

1086
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:39,226
He's been gone for 5-6 days now.

1087
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:41,875
Did Kerala Police catch him
buying "stuff" from Idukki?

1088
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:43,450
Hey, that's Raaki!

1089
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:45,792
Dude!

1090
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,827
- Hey, Raaki!
- Hop on, dude.

1091
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:57,120
Raaki!

1092
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,194
Raaki, where did you disappear?

1093
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:00,821
- Where's your phone?
- I'll tell you later.

1094
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,918
- Where were you?
- Move, I'll tell you later.

1095
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,298
- Your sister got worried.
- I'll tell you everything, dude!

1096
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:09,024
Your phone was switched off.
We looked for you everywhere.

1097
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:11,789
Dude, it's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

1098
00:56:12,826 --> 00:56:14,861
Raaki, watch out.

1099
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,765
Dude, we are trapped.

1100
00:56:44,198 --> 00:56:46,464
Karna, take Kalai and run away.

1101
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:48,230
Tiger, get him.

1102
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:53,837
Raaki, run away.

1103
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,749
Run!

1104
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,627
Get him.

1105
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:06,624
They are right behind us.

1106
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:09,274
- Get them!
- Don't let them get away.

1107
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:13,114
Kalai, jump over!

1108
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:28,627
They're here.

1109
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:30,547
Kalai, careful!

1110
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:32,544
Get up, Kalai!

1111
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,888
Run!

1112
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:36,269
- Run, Kalai!
- Surround them.

1113
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:39,610
Surround them.

1114
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:44,141
Kalai, get away somehow.

1115
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:56,928
- Kalai, run away.
- No, dude...

1116
00:57:56,966 --> 00:57:58,963
Kaliyan, finish him!

1117
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,186
Run!

1118
00:58:04,224 --> 00:58:06,643
Just get out of here!

1119
00:58:06,758 --> 00:58:08,986
I'm turning left,
you go the other way!

1120
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:12,288
Okay, I'll escape somehow.
You get away too!

1121
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:15,590
Run!

1122
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,774
You're dead, man

1123
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,310
I am coming for you!

1124
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:50,611
You go that way.
You, this way.

1125
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:03,667
Manickam, are you okay?

1126
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,240
I am fine.
Finish him off!

1127
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:24,902
Kalai, come with me!

1128
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,429
Raaki, go away!

1129
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:49,325
Dude, let's run away.
Come on.

1130
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:51,552
Hurry up.

1131
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:10,176
Kaliyan!

1132
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,549
Karna...

1133
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:22,387
Raaki!

1134
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:36,749
Raaki!

1135
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,765
Why?

1136
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:52,877
Dude... Raaki...

1137
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:56,256
Raaki...

1138
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:00,403
Buddy, are you okay?
Buddy...

1139
01:01:00,902 --> 01:01:02,285
Dude!

1140
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,358
Marb...

1141
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,394
marb...

1142
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:08,429
marbles.

1143
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:10,541
Raaki? Raaki!

1144
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,448
Raaki!

1145
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,941
My friend, you are gone.

1146
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,549
Buddy...

1147
01:01:38,189 --> 01:01:41,453
'In the blood-stained land
Now...'

1148
01:02:31,066 --> 01:02:33,715
Sir, the forensic team is on their way.

1149
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:34,867
Fingerprints, sir.

1150
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:36,979
Shut up!

1151
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:39,091
Get here soon.

1152
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:57,869
I'm going.

1153
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,405
Hey, where are you going?

1154
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,632
Dude, I'll go to the police station.

1155
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,859
I've committed a murder.
They will eventually get me.

1156
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:06,715
- What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?
- No, I'll surrender.

1157
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,160
Let me go, dude!

1158
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:09,619
Don't talk crap. Move.

1159
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:22,445
How many times do I tell you?
Stop annoying me.

1160
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:45,984
Take this.

1161
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,986
Dude, drink up!

1162
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:12,672
Gulp it down.

1163
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,130
Go ahead.

1164
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:31,603
They killed Raaki.

1165
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,054
Don't cry!

1166
01:04:38,093 --> 01:04:39,590
Please don't cry, dude.

1167
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:41,434
It's all over.

1168
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:45,734
Stop crying!

1169
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:49,229
Listen to me.

1170
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,469
Don't stop the car.
Keep driving.

1171
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:08,928
Come on, guys.

1172
01:05:09,696 --> 01:05:12,614
We shouldn't spare him.
Kill him right here.

1173
01:05:12,653 --> 01:05:13,843
Break the door!

1174
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:16,341
Break it open!

1175
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:18,643
You killed our Kaliyan.

1176
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,408
- Stop this and leave now.
- I won't rest until I kill you.

1177
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:23,789
Get them out.
I'll take care of them.

1178
01:05:33,043 --> 01:05:36,883
- Sir, they got my buddy. Let me do this!
- Listen to me. Leave now!

1179
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,416
I'm not letting this go.
Their death is in my hands.

1180
01:05:40,454 --> 01:05:42,144
Let them out!

1181
01:05:42,182 --> 01:05:44,678
Manick, don't create a ruckus.
Get out!

1182
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:45,907
Chase them away.

1183
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:49,440
- Your death lies in my hands.
- Everybody out!

1184
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,859
Chase them away.

1185
01:05:51,898 --> 01:05:53,971
Go... go.

1186
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:56,774
Send everyone out.

1187
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:59,424
What are you staring at?
Send them out.

1188
01:05:59,462 --> 01:06:00,806
- Ma...
- Move on.

1189
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:09,715
Go and sit down.

1190
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:11,290
File an FIR.

1191
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:14,016
Velan, we're producing them in
court tomorrow. Get the weapons.

1192
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,734
- Get the fingerprint analyst.
- Okay, sir.

1193
01:06:17,779 --> 01:06:18,779
Dude!

1194
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:21,504
Dude, what's wrong?

1195
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:26,611
The inspector has asked you to leave.
You must come when we send word.

1196
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:31,219
What have you written?

1197
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:33,293
Don't be so considerate.
Make it strong.

1198
01:06:33,331 --> 01:06:34,291
Velan, come here!

1199
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,826
Don't be scared.
We'll be fine.

1200
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:42,739
- Sir!
- Sir!

1201
01:06:42,778 --> 01:06:45,581
The full area is under our control.
Accused has been arrested.

1202
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:47,309
- Have you filed the FIR?
- Yes, sir!

1203
01:06:47,347 --> 01:06:48,614
- Sir.
- No problem.

1204
01:06:48,883 --> 01:06:50,434
The fingerprint analyst is working on it.

1205
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,123
If the finger print matches,
we'll go ahead.

1206
01:06:52,147 --> 01:06:53,890
- The post-mortem report...
- It will be ready by morning.

1207
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:55,373
Sir, they are the accused.

1208
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:59,213
Coffee or tea, sir?

1209
01:06:59,251 --> 01:07:00,058
Coffee.

1210
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,286
Get him a coffee.

1211
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,803
Sir, I don't think you need
an introduction to Kaveri Nagar.

1212
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:17,798
It's a very tough area, sir.
Really challenging to work there.

1213
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:20,064
This is really a punishment for me.

1214
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:23,942
Sir, the fingerprint on the weapon
doesn't match with his.

1215
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:26,781
Not a match?
- Sir, I'm the one who did it. The machine must be faulty.

1216
01:07:27,706 --> 01:07:29,165
Let's check your fingerprints.

1217
01:07:29,203 --> 01:07:32,006
Sir, why are you checking
his fingerprints?

1218
01:07:32,045 --> 01:07:35,117
- Sir, it wasn't him. I did this, sir!
- Why are you acting up now?

1219
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:36,269
Sir, it was me!

1220
01:07:36,307 --> 01:07:38,112
Perumal, what's happening?

1221
01:07:38,573 --> 01:07:40,224
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir!

1222
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:41,568
Sir, I did it.

1223
01:07:47,366 --> 01:07:50,438
Sir, trust me. It was not him.
- Shut your mouth.

1224
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:52,512
He didn't do anything, sir!

1225
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:55,046
Sir, he is a decent guy
with a job at the petrol bunk.

1226
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:56,621
He didn't do it!

1227
01:07:59,616 --> 01:08:01,613
Sir, please don't...

1228
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:07,488
Sir, his fingerprint is a match.

1229
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:10,714
- Sir, listen to me. It's not him.
- I said, shut up!

1230
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:12,058
Sir, I did it.

1231
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:15,206
Sir, we'll charge him as A1
and him as A2?

1232
01:08:15,245 --> 01:08:18,547
There are already complaints
on you for false accusations.

1233
01:08:18,586 --> 01:08:20,813
This is unnecessary trouble.
Let him go.

1234
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:21,851
Okay, sir.

1235
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,040
Velan!

1236
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:26,035
Sir, Kalai is an innocent guy.
Let him go.

1237
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,186
There's no one else
to take care of his parents.

1238
01:08:28,224 --> 01:08:30,144
Poor Kalai.
Please tell him, sir.

1239
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:31,834
Don't create trouble here.
Get going.

1240
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:33,600
- Go away.
- Kalai is innocent, sir.

1241
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:37,056
- Go now.
- Sir...

1242
01:08:41,126 --> 01:08:42,394
Why are you still here?

1243
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,237
They let me go, right?
Go home.

1244
01:08:51,226 --> 01:08:52,186
Wait, ma'am.

1245
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:54,067
The inspector said she could leave.

1246
01:08:54,106 --> 01:08:55,296
You go ahead, ma'am.

1247
01:09:10,003 --> 01:09:11,155
Kalai...

1248
01:09:11,578 --> 01:09:14,918
When the judge questions you at the court,
say you didn't kill him.

1249
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:16,661
Say you were beaten up
and forced to accept.

1250
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:17,990
I'll take care of everything.

1251
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,102
Kalai, listen to me.
Don't be scared.

1252
01:09:20,141 --> 01:09:23,290
What are you doing here?
He told you to go. Get going.

1253
01:09:23,328 --> 01:09:25,248
Kalai, don't be scared.
I'm here for you.

1254
01:09:50,054 --> 01:09:54,048
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,

1255
01:09:54,086 --> 01:09:57,734
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
on earth as it is in Heaven.

1256
01:09:57,773 --> 01:10:02,189
A young man from our community,
a treasured friend, has been lost.

1257
01:10:02,227 --> 01:10:06,566
Give us the strength to
overcome this grief.

1258
01:10:06,605 --> 01:10:08,986
In His name, we pray.

1259
01:10:09,024 --> 01:10:11,098
Amen. Amen. Amen.

1260
01:10:18,509 --> 01:10:19,509
Dude!

1261
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,658
Is the funeral done?

1262
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,269
He didn't look dead.

1263
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:27,533
You know how he gets drunk
and passes out on my lap?

1264
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:29,606
That's how he looked
in the ice box.

1265
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:33,370
His sister kept weeping,
asking why we abandoned him.

1266
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:35,328
I didn't know what to say.

1267
01:10:36,096 --> 01:10:39,053
During the burial, they asked us
to throw handful of sand on him.

1268
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:42,701
I started shivering.

1269
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:44,544
I didn't do it.

1270
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:46,579
I ran away.

1271
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:52,147
I'll find a good lawyer
and get you out on bail.

1272
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:53,875
Don't worry.

1273
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,754
You mongrel, you're the reason
he stole as a kid...

1274
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,405
...now you've made him a murderer!

1275
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:02,093
- No, I didn't...
- What else do you want from him?

1276
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:03,475
Ma, he didn't do anything.

1277
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:05,818
You piece of garbage.
You'll die a ghastly death.

1278
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:08,659
- Filthy dog, you won't be at peace!
- Ma, don't hit him.

1279
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:09,965
Ma, stop beating him up.

1280
01:11:10,003 --> 01:11:12,538
You've wrecked our family.

1281
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:14,573
Ma'am, what's all this ruckus?

1282
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:15,955
You should leave, boy.

1283
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:17,414
Ma, he didn't do anything!

1284
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:18,835
Let go, ma'am.

1285
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,371
Son, come out.

1286
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,021
Hey, Karna...

1287
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:24,211
Ma...

1288
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:33,197
- Ma, what did he do?
- He's the reason for everything.

1289
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,270
Why would you hit him
for something I did?

1290
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:38,266
- Ma'am, come with me.
- Leave now.

1291
01:11:38,304 --> 01:11:41,184
Let me say a few words to him.
- Get going, ma'am.

1292
01:11:41,222 --> 01:11:43,296
- Kalai...
- Ma!

1293
01:11:43,334 --> 01:11:46,483
Keep moving!
- Let me speak to him for a couple of minutes.

1294
01:11:49,094 --> 01:11:51,053
Ma'am, please.
I beg you...

1295
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:52,781
Don't create a ruckus.
Get going.

1296
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:54,163
You heard us.
Just leave.

1297
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:58,003
- You are so annoying. Get going.
- Ma'am, please!

1298
01:12:02,342 --> 01:12:06,029
Looks like my son's fate
is to spend his life in jail.

1299
01:12:38,669 --> 01:12:39,706
Ma...

1300
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:44,853
Ma?

1301
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:47,157
Ma!

1302
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:19,526
Karna...

1303
01:13:20,448 --> 01:13:22,560
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

1304
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,211
What is the matter with you?

1305
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,330
- Why do you want to slit your wrist?
- Let go of me.

1306
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,051
- Are you crazy?
- Leave me alone!

1307
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,165
I'm so furious!

1308
01:13:29,203 --> 01:13:30,394
- Drop it down.
- Let go.

1309
01:13:30,432 --> 01:13:31,891
Drop it, now.

1310
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,771
I asked you to throw it down.
Don't you dare...

1311
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:43,142
Are you crazy or what?

1312
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,410
Go ahead. Slap me.

1313
01:13:45,062 --> 01:13:46,330
What's wrong?

1314
01:13:47,021 --> 01:13:48,749
I met Kalai's mother in jail.

1315
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:52,051
She accused me of being the reason
behind all this mess...

1316
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,509
...hit me and humiliated me.

1317
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:56,813
I don't wish to live anymore.

1318
01:13:57,581 --> 01:13:59,654
It's nothing.
Don't cry.

1319
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:02,189
I'm losing everyone one by one.

1320
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:04,224
Raaki left me.

1321
01:14:04,685 --> 01:14:06,413
My mother doesn't talk to me.

1322
01:14:06,874 --> 01:14:08,794
I don't have anybody else.

1323
01:14:08,832 --> 01:14:10,291
I am here for you, right?

1324
01:14:11,059 --> 01:14:12,595
Will you be there for me?

1325
01:14:12,902 --> 01:14:14,515
I promise, I'll be there.

1326
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:16,627
You won't leave me?

1327
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,586
I won't!

1328
01:14:19,853 --> 01:14:22,656
"Oh, girl..."

1329
01:14:23,155 --> 01:14:24,307
"Oh, girl..."

1330
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:28,646
"You're my only love."

1331
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,451
"You're my only love."

1332
01:14:31,373 --> 01:14:33,293
"Oh, girl..."

1333
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:37,133
"Oh, girl..."

1334
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:40,243
"You're my only love."

1335
01:14:40,358 --> 01:14:41,894
"You're my only love."

1336
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:59,981
"I fade into thin air
I become the breath we share"

1337
01:15:00,019 --> 01:15:05,933
"I melt away into the sea
I become a fish with you."

1338
01:15:05,971 --> 01:15:11,577
"In the canvas of your body
I become a nail that creates art."

1339
01:15:11,616 --> 01:15:17,453
"In my passion for you, girl
I become a face where kisses live."

1340
01:15:17,491 --> 01:15:25,491
"Like a pair of shade-loving flowers
We become one with the showers."

1341
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:31,699
"I fade into thin air
I become the breath we share"

1342
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:37,997
"I melt away into the sea
I become a fish with you."

1343
01:16:23,731 --> 01:16:29,453
"A flower's impression on the leave
Eyelids fluttering like peacock's plume."

1344
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:35,174
"For a thousand years I shall treasure
This violence of blissful pleasure."

1345
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:40,973
"Being an infant in your arms
This intoxication never wanes."

1346
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:46,656
"What are we now?
Just two children."

1347
01:16:46,694 --> 01:16:52,377
"To make my sweetheart blossom
We became seeds of love."

1348
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:57,638
"In Cupid's diary
We became a love story."

1349
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:06,777
"I fade into thin air
I become the breath we share"

1350
01:17:06,816 --> 01:17:12,537
"I melt away into the sea
I become a fish with you."

1351
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:20,371
Do you know why I like you?

1352
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:21,869
Why?

1353
01:17:22,752 --> 01:17:27,398
Because you said, if you had the money
you'd give it all to Kaveri Nagar!

1354
01:17:29,203 --> 01:17:31,392
Would you be okay with it
even after we get married?

1355
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,307
Of course!

1356
01:17:55,469 --> 01:17:56,659
Die!

1357
01:17:58,771 --> 01:17:59,771
Karna...

1358
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:05,913
Damn it, he dodged it!
Throw the next TV.

1359
01:18:05,952 --> 01:18:06,989
This way!

1360
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:19,968
Malar, are you okay?

1361
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:41,971
Malar, what happened?

1362
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:44,275
I am okay.
Let's get out of here.

1363
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:46,502
You scoundrels.
Come down.

1364
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:48,038
Just wait till we get there.

1365
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:49,382
Revenge, is it?

1366
01:18:49,728 --> 01:18:51,341
Come and get me if you can!

1367
01:18:53,184 --> 01:18:54,184
Karna...

1368
01:18:54,336 --> 01:18:55,449
Come at me.

1369
01:18:55,488 --> 01:18:56,717
Karna...

1370
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:02,323
Let him go.

1371
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:04,896
You oaf!

1372
01:19:15,955 --> 01:19:17,376
Let's leave, come!

1373
01:19:17,414 --> 01:19:19,181
- Die!
- You scumbag.

1374
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,369
You people killed my Kaliyan...

1375
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:24,326
I'll kill you and then
kill that jerk who's in jail.

1376
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:46,598
Don't do it, boy.

1377
01:19:49,517 --> 01:19:50,553
Karna!

1378
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:53,049
You'll get yourself arrested,
don't do this.

1379
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,853
You hothead, stop this nonsense!

1380
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:56,891
Come on!

1381
01:19:57,619 --> 01:19:58,886
Stab me.

1382
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:00,883
You aren't satisfied with two deaths?

1383
01:20:01,267 --> 01:20:03,187
Why do you keep going back to this?

1384
01:20:03,225 --> 01:20:04,262
I didn't start this!

1385
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:06,259
Look at what they did!

1386
01:20:07,526 --> 01:20:10,752
You old hag.
Take your son home.

1387
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:14,208
- Or I'll stab him right here.
- I dare you to do it.

1388
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:17,971
- I beg you, think of me as your mother.
- Ma, what's wrong with you?

1389
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:19,891
- Just give up all of this.
- Come and stab me.

1390
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:23,232
Shut up, don't prolong this.
- I didn't do anything. It's him!

1391
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:26,035
I won't say this again.

1392
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:28,877
Take your son home now,
or you'll be carrying his corpse home.

1393
01:20:28,915 --> 01:20:31,334
You're the big guy here.
Let me apologize on his behalf.

1394
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,715
Don't beg that guy, Ma.

1395
01:20:33,753 --> 01:20:36,096
I'm sparing your life now,
thanks to your mother.

1396
01:20:36,134 --> 01:20:38,515
- Or what?
- I'll blow your death horn!

1397
01:20:38,553 --> 01:20:40,896
Let's go, boy.
- I'll blow your death horn!

1398
01:20:41,664 --> 01:20:44,237
I'm sure I'll get you someday.

1399
01:20:44,275 --> 01:20:46,003
Come at me!

1400
01:20:46,502 --> 01:20:48,422
I won't spare you.

1401
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:05,856
'The customer you are
calling is not available'

1402
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:14,803
No problem. We can file a 437 CRPC.

1403
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:16,838
Then book a bail in lower court.

1404
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:19,117
- Okay, madam.
- If we don't get it, then sessions court.

1405
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:22,445
It's my responsibility to escalate it
to high court and get the bail.

1406
01:21:22,483 --> 01:21:26,016
Wherever we go, we'll have
to deal with police, PP and the likes.

1407
01:21:26,285 --> 01:21:27,859
It'll cost minimum 2 Lakhs.

1408
01:21:28,435 --> 01:21:30,048
Give me a lakh as advance.

1409
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:31,507
- 1 lakh?
- Brother...

1410
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:35,539
I'll get one lakh to you in a week.
Please start work on it.

1411
01:21:35,577 --> 01:21:37,537
I'll start work only after
you bring me the money.

1412
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:50,169
Brother! Pushpa sister has
been taken to the police station.

1413
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,552
- Really?
- Yes.

1414
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:57,811
- Murugan, bring me that file.
- Sir, where is Pushpa?

1415
01:21:58,157 --> 01:21:59,731
She's there.
That way.

1416
01:21:59,769 --> 01:22:01,497
- You sit right there.
- Hey Karna!

1417
01:22:01,536 --> 01:22:03,456
We did nothing, but
they brought us in.

1418
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:12,096
What happened, sister?

1419
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:20,429
What is he looking for in my house?

1420
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:22,003
Wait, he's checking.

1421
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:28,416
Raaki is no more.
What more could you want?

1422
01:22:28,723 --> 01:22:30,989
You can't let us live with dignity?

1423
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:36,403
Sir, what is it you want?

1424
01:22:36,979 --> 01:22:38,477
You've ruined our home.

1425
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:40,742
You're treating a lady like a suspect.

1426
01:22:42,009 --> 01:22:43,584
She's innocent, sir!

1427
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:45,619
Get it!

1428
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:52,877
Her brother is dead,
now his sister starts peddling?

1429
01:22:54,413 --> 01:22:56,409
Sir, don't say such things.

1430
01:22:56,448 --> 01:22:58,637
She never even ate a meal
from Raaki's money.

1431
01:22:58,675 --> 01:23:00,134
She runs a petty shop with dignity.

1432
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:01,478
Where did this come from?

1433
01:23:01,517 --> 01:23:03,398
Raaki must have hid it.

1434
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,049
Raaki hid it?

1435
01:23:05,472 --> 01:23:07,315
Where else did he hide stuff?

1436
01:23:08,966 --> 01:23:10,233
I don't understand.

1437
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:14,073
I received a call from control room
about 5kg dope in Kaveri Nagar.

1438
01:23:14,112 --> 01:23:16,301
There's half a kilo in this.
Where is the rest?

1439
01:23:16,339 --> 01:23:17,376
Perumal!

1440
01:23:17,683 --> 01:23:19,373
Keep making these false allegations...

1441
01:23:19,757 --> 01:23:21,600
I'm going to shoot you one day.

1442
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:24,864
You're questioning us here,
but will you ever do this to Manick?

1443
01:23:24,902 --> 01:23:26,861
- Be quiet.
- Who are you?

1444
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:28,857
How dare you hurt The Gun?

1445
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,893
Look, he's hitting me.

1446
01:23:30,931 --> 01:23:32,467
Hey, I'll shoot you too!

1447
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:35,270
You dare not raise your hand on me!

1448
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,997
Look, he's hitting me!

1449
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:41,529
Sir.
She's innocent!

1450
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,872
She's never been to the
police station before.

1451
01:23:46,176 --> 01:23:47,405
Please let her go, sir.

1452
01:23:50,745 --> 01:23:52,704
Take her back home.

1453
01:23:54,624 --> 01:23:55,624
Thank you, sir.

1454
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,118
Sir, the boys?

1455
01:23:58,694 --> 01:24:01,382
Who am I to pin the case on?

1456
01:24:02,803 --> 01:24:04,454
You can pin it on me.

1457
01:24:07,565 --> 01:24:09,254
Perumal is lying, Karna.

1458
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:11,673
When he walked out of the house...

1459
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:12,902
he had nothing with him.

1460
01:24:13,363 --> 01:24:15,513
Let it go, sister.
He's let us go.

1461
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:20,813
Guys, take The Gun to the hospital.
I'll drop her home.

1462
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,157
- Okay.
- Take care!

1463
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:24,000
Come.

1464
01:24:30,297 --> 01:24:33,792
If Raaki were here,
he wouldn't have let this happen.

1465
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:50,419
Whose picture is this?

1466
01:24:52,109 --> 01:24:53,109
'E. Murugan'

1467
01:24:55,027 --> 01:24:59,213
If I wanted to marry,
I'd have said yes to Laundry Murugan.

1468
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:00,403
Laundry Murugan...

1469
01:25:08,505 --> 01:25:09,657
Okay, I'll call you back.

1470
01:25:10,617 --> 01:25:15,763
Sir, just yesterday, we met the country
doctor and got herbs to cure piles.

1471
01:25:16,147 --> 01:25:18,912
He said you should strictly avoid oil.
What is this?

1472
01:25:19,142 --> 01:25:22,637
What do I do?
I don't want to eat this either.

1473
01:25:22,944 --> 01:25:24,403
My stupid tongue won't listen.

1474
01:25:25,862 --> 01:25:27,398
Sir, hello!

1475
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:29,395
- Come Karna, want some fritters?
- No thank you!

1476
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:30,547
You'd asked for me, sir?

1477
01:25:31,622 --> 01:25:33,312
What's that chick saying now?

1478
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,387
Who, sir?

1479
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,075
The lady lawyer!

1480
01:25:38,304 --> 01:25:41,107
She said she'll get him out for a lakh.

1481
01:25:41,145 --> 01:25:42,336
She'll wipe you clean.

1482
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:43,835
Idiot!

1483
01:25:45,753 --> 01:25:48,249
Karna, careful.
Don't trip.

1484
01:25:48,288 --> 01:25:51,897
I planned for a lift here, but no budget.
So we have to take the stairs.

1485
01:25:51,936 --> 01:25:54,125
Sir, about the lawyer...

1486
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:57,888
Even if you throw 10 Lakhs at her,
she can't get Kalai out.

1487
01:25:57,926 --> 01:25:59,808
She's a scammer. A fraud.

1488
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,457
Saw what happened to
Three-Storey Gang Bhaskar?

1489
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,301
She milked him for 6 Lakhs.

1490
01:26:04,838 --> 01:26:06,451
She lost the case anyway.

1491
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,141
He's in Puzhal prison now.

1492
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:10,406
She's not your deity,
but your devil.

1493
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:12,595
But sir, she seemed like a good person.

1494
01:26:12,787 --> 01:26:15,667
In these wretched times,
evil people appear good.

1495
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:17,433
And good people appear evil.

1496
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,808
Why don't you suggest
a good lawyer, sir?

1497
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:26,457
A lawyer can't do anything about this.
I can, though.

1498
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:28,377
How, sir?

1499
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,950
I'll drop a weapon in the crime scene.

1500
01:26:31,181 --> 01:26:33,753
I'll produce it as new evidence.

1501
01:26:34,214 --> 01:26:36,864
I'll plant evidence of Kaliyan's blood.

1502
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:41,741
I'll ask two men to surrender at the
Chengalpet court, admitting to the murder.

1503
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,968
I'll change the old forensic report.

1504
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:45,696
The judge will be thrown off.

1505
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:47,731
He'll take it out on me.

1506
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:51,379
He'll dismiss the new evidence,
Kalai will be released.

1507
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:53,414
This will cost 10 Lakhs.

1508
01:26:53,798 --> 01:26:55,910
I'll start work immediately
if you give me 2 Lakhs.

1509
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,483
I need to submit the
charge-sheet in 90 days.

1510
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,747
It's been 30 days.
There's 60 days to go.

1511
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:04,013
Your time starts now.

1512
01:27:33,043 --> 01:27:34,617
Did you take the money
from my pants?

1513
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:38,419
Ma? I'm talking to you.

1514
01:27:39,878 --> 01:27:40,685
Are you deaf?

1515
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:44,525
I thought you were doing petty theft.
What's with this bundle of cash?

1516
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:46,675
Whose life are you ruining, you scum?

1517
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,014
Where did you get this from?

1518
01:27:51,053 --> 01:27:52,704
It doesn't concern you.

1519
01:27:52,742 --> 01:27:55,353
This money... it's going to kill you.

1520
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,349
Ma, stop with your rants.
My ears hurt.

1521
01:28:01,113 --> 01:28:03,725
You do all this because
you have a mother.

1522
01:28:03,763 --> 01:28:07,142
I don't want to live to see your
obituary ceremony poster.

1523
01:28:07,603 --> 01:28:09,984
Your two mates' lives have
already ended.

1524
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:11,520
I'm leaving.

1525
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:14,745
I'm leaving this house.
I can't live with you any more.

1526
01:28:15,283 --> 01:28:16,397
I'll go away somewhere.

1527
01:28:17,049 --> 01:28:19,200
I've beaten up this mongrel,
I've burnt him...

1528
01:28:20,352 --> 01:28:23,539
he doesn't change one bit,
stubborn jerk!

1529
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:24,653
I'm done.

1530
01:28:28,646 --> 01:28:29,952
See you.

1531
01:28:30,413 --> 01:28:32,064
I'm never going back there.

1532
01:28:32,409 --> 01:28:34,291
I'm not going back
until this ends.

1533
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:36,173
Here he comes.

1534
01:28:47,885 --> 01:28:49,920
Karna, how did you get
all this money in 2 days?

1535
01:28:50,918 --> 01:28:52,915
I applied for a bank loan.

1536
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,413
What? You're joking?

1537
01:28:54,451 --> 01:28:56,571
Of course! You're asking a thief
how he got the money?

1538
01:28:57,139 --> 01:28:59,366
I just need to get Kalai out.

1539
01:28:59,712 --> 01:29:00,825
I'm off, sir!

1540
01:29:06,969 --> 01:29:08,045
Oh, hey...

1541
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:14,534
Didn't somebody storm
out of the house?

1542
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:17,606
One must always stand by their words.

1543
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:19,949
Always so melodramatic.

1544
01:29:20,179 --> 01:29:21,446
You're making fun of me?

1545
01:29:21,485 --> 01:29:23,904
Not just the house,
I'm going to leave this world.

1546
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:26,285
You'll understand my worth
only when I die.

1547
01:29:26,707 --> 01:29:28,013
Wait, wait...

1548
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:31,584
You'll be like this for
as long as I am alive.

1549
01:29:32,313 --> 01:29:35,117
You'll know my worth
when I'm gone.

1550
01:29:35,155 --> 01:29:37,075
Stop with the TV serial dialogues!

1551
01:29:37,382 --> 01:29:40,301
You think this is a TV Serial?
I'll hang in front of your eyes.

1552
01:29:41,952 --> 01:29:44,755
Ma, why do you keep
making 'rasam'?

1553
01:29:44,793 --> 01:29:47,904
How about some chicken
curry or fish curry?

1554
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:52,665
Your mother is hanging herself,
you're asking for chicken and fish curry?

1555
01:29:52,704 --> 01:29:54,048
I'm going to die.

1556
01:29:54,086 --> 01:29:56,889
Bring home some woman
who will cook for you.

1557
01:29:58,387 --> 01:30:02,189
Ma, before you hang,
just make me one omlette?

1558
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:04,070
That's right, a little tighter
around the neck.

1559
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:08,179
Damn, what a miss.

1560
01:30:08,717 --> 01:30:09,717
Oh, no!

1561
01:30:11,597 --> 01:30:12,597
Ma...

1562
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:16,934
You're laughing?

1563
01:30:16,973 --> 01:30:19,584
You just stood by and watched
while I was hanging?

1564
01:30:19,968 --> 01:30:21,968
I know your worn out saree
will just tear, don't I?

1565
01:30:22,272 --> 01:30:25,613
You're my shadow. You're stuck with me.
You'll go nowhere.

1566
01:30:26,496 --> 01:30:27,917
Please give up all this nonsense.

1567
01:30:28,608 --> 01:30:30,374
It scares your mother!

1568
01:30:30,413 --> 01:30:32,525
Ma, just one more month.

1569
01:30:33,024 --> 01:30:34,598
It's for Kalai's bail.

1570
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:36,864
Once Kalai is out of jail,

1571
01:30:36,902 --> 01:30:39,974
I'll do whatever the hell
you want me to do.

1572
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:41,625
I promise on you, Papamma!

1573
01:30:42,432 --> 01:30:43,545
You're my darling!

1574
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:47,309
How are you, Rani?

1575
01:30:50,995 --> 01:30:52,185
My brother got out of jail.

1576
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:55,795
But now, you're in here.
Just my luck.

1577
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,675
Hey, my buddy's getting
out of here real soon!

1578
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,709
I've made all the arrangements.
You'll be out soon!

1579
01:31:03,283 --> 01:31:04,358
- Dude.
- What?

1580
01:31:04,397 --> 01:31:06,547
From here, it looks like
you're the one behind bars.

1581
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:08,083
Be careful!

1582
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,849
So Mitta Sai Baba.

1583
01:31:09,888 --> 01:31:12,729
You think they can touch me?
I'll take care.

1584
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:14,342
I'll see you?

1585
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:21,945
Police officer Perumal called me.

1586
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,057
- Tell him Karna is here. He knows.
- Okay, sir.

1587
01:31:24,096 --> 01:31:26,745
Can I go? Thanks, bro!

1588
01:31:26,784 --> 01:31:28,781
Is Perumal here?

1589
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:30,395
What?

1590
01:31:30,701 --> 01:31:33,465
"Let's douse the fire with wine."

1591
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:37,190
"This is the pinnacle of pleasure."

1592
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:40,531
"Let's hit the heights, come on."

1593
01:31:40,569 --> 01:31:43,987
"Let's fill the night with some ecstasy."

1594
01:31:44,025 --> 01:31:47,328
"Let's float in our magical world."

1595
01:31:47,366 --> 01:31:50,745
"Soak it all up just this once."

1596
01:31:50,784 --> 01:31:54,125
"Let's get the third eye to open."

1597
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,960
Sir!

1598
01:32:02,227 --> 01:32:03,227
Sir!

1599
01:32:03,763 --> 01:32:06,144
Hey Karna.
Come, come!

1600
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,525
This is amazing.

1601
01:32:08,563 --> 01:32:10,445
That's why I invited you
to my house party.

1602
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:11,520
What will you drink?

1603
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:13,209
- No thanks, sir.
- You must.

1604
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:14,784
One cognac, please.

1605
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:18,547
Enjoy yourself!

1606
01:32:25,766 --> 01:32:28,800
- How's it?
- It feels like heaven, sir.

1607
01:32:31,987 --> 01:32:33,638
Why did you call me, sir?

1608
01:32:33,677 --> 01:32:35,558
You see the fat man?

1609
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:37,209
In the black coat?

1610
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,091
Yes, do you know who he is?

1611
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:41,856
Who is it?

1612
01:32:41,894 --> 01:32:44,160
Session court judge. Mr. Vishwanathan.

1613
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:50,073
Aren't judges supposed to be good?
- Judges are human too.

1614
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:53,376
I've told him in detail about Kalai.
I've paid him too.

1615
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:54,566
Thank you, sir!

1616
01:32:54,605 --> 01:32:57,945
Every word uttered by a judge
is like a holy utterance.

1617
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:01,209
His words will set Kalai free.

1618
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:02,784
Come, I'll introduce you to him.

1619
01:33:02,822 --> 01:33:03,897
Sir...

1620
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:10,310
- Hi, Perumal!
- Hi, sir!

1621
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:12,499
How are you? Anything special today?

1622
01:33:12,537 --> 01:33:15,033
Yes, sir!
This is the boy I told you about.

1623
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:16,377
- Hello, sir!
- What's your name?

1624
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,104
Karna, sir! Please get Kalai out sir.

1625
01:33:19,142 --> 01:33:20,563
Perumal mentioned. I'll take care.

1626
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,022
I think of you as our deity, sir.

1627
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:24,211
- Don't worry! I'll handle it.
- Thanks, sir.

1628
01:33:24,595 --> 01:33:25,824
Enjoy, sir!

1629
01:33:25,862 --> 01:33:28,435
- Are you happy?
- Thanks sir. I'll get going then.

1630
01:33:28,473 --> 01:33:30,240
Hey, where are you going?

1631
01:33:30,278 --> 01:33:31,968
Sir, my Mom's asked me to
come home early.

1632
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:36,461
The judge will be here till 2 AM.

1633
01:33:36,499 --> 01:33:40,301
Stay within his sight till then.
It will help Kalai come out sooner.

1634
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,565
The more he gets drunk,
he becomes a child.

1635
01:33:44,525 --> 01:33:47,635
Talk to him then.
We'll get the work done!

1636
01:33:47,673 --> 01:33:49,325
So? Are you staying or leaving?

1637
01:33:53,203 --> 01:33:54,470
- I'll stay.
- Good!

1638
01:33:55,123 --> 01:33:58,387
Karna, Indian women and
imported alcohol. Mix up.

1639
01:33:58,425 --> 01:34:00,614
- Hello doctor, how are you?
- Hi.

1640
01:34:00,653 --> 01:34:03,494
- Hi, how is your mother?
- Fine, thank you, doctor!

1641
01:34:03,533 --> 01:34:04,533
Great.

1642
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:12,902
Why are these trays still here?

1643
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:14,592
Papamma hasn't come today.

1644
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,142
How can you be so casual?
It's already 7 am.

1645
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:19,353
If people don't get their milk,
they will skin me alive.

1646
01:34:25,344 --> 01:34:26,227
Yes, brother?

1647
01:34:26,265 --> 01:34:30,221
Papamma hasn't showed up this morning,
Can you check on her?

1648
01:34:30,259 --> 01:34:31,757
Okay, brother.
I'll call you back.

1649
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:35,942
Ma'am...

1650
01:34:36,557 --> 01:34:37,557
Ma'am!

1651
01:34:38,323 --> 01:34:39,323
Ma'am...

1652
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,259
- Where is Karna?
- I tried calling him.

1653
01:34:54,297 --> 01:34:56,947
- Do any of you know?
- No idea, uncle.

1654
01:34:56,985 --> 01:34:59,097
He said he'll come back from
ECR and join for dinner.

1655
01:34:59,136 --> 01:35:03,206
Do you know where he went?
Maybe Jill-Jill bar, he goes there often.

1656
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:05,472
- You know where that is?
- Yes I do.

1657
01:35:09,696 --> 01:35:12,000
Where? Which area?

1658
01:35:12,038 --> 01:35:14,496
A little further ahead.

1659
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:36,845
Stop, Karna's bike
is lying on the ground there.

1660
01:35:36,883 --> 01:35:38,649
Stop, stop, stop!

1661
01:35:54,009 --> 01:35:55,507
Brother, wake up.

1662
01:35:56,237 --> 01:35:57,158
Brother?

1663
01:35:57,197 --> 01:36:01,113
- Karna... wake up.
- Brother, get up.

1664
01:36:01,344 --> 01:36:03,763
He's passed out drunk.
Carry him!

1665
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,067
Mani, grab his legs.

1666
01:36:09,062 --> 01:36:10,598
Careful.

1667
01:37:18,489 --> 01:37:20,678
We can't give him an injection
in this state.

1668
01:37:20,717 --> 01:37:22,483
We have to wait till
tomorrow morning.

1669
01:38:25,843 --> 01:38:26,995
Ma?

1670
01:38:47,462 --> 01:38:48,499
Ma...

1671
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:06,624
Sister, have you seen my mother?

1672
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:17,606
Have you seen my mother?

1673
01:39:18,605 --> 01:39:21,408
Not sure what I had.
I took one hit...

1674
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:23,251
I was knocked out.

1675
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:24,849
I have no idea what happened
after that.

1676
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,667
Did my mother get angry and leave?

1677
01:39:28,857 --> 01:39:31,238
Hey, I'm asking you!
Tell me...

1678
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:32,851
Your mother passed away.

1679
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:34,350
You fool!

1680
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:35,654
Don't say shit.

1681
01:39:36,038 --> 01:39:38,688
Why are you beating him up?
You're the one who passed out drunk.

1682
01:39:38,995 --> 01:39:40,032
What are you saying?

1683
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:42,029
Your mom's heart gave away
worrying about you.

1684
01:39:42,067 --> 01:39:43,872
Don't you dare say such things.

1685
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:45,101
Let go of me.

1686
01:39:45,523 --> 01:39:47,366
Uncle, what's she saying?

1687
01:39:48,173 --> 01:39:49,440
It's true.

1688
01:39:49,478 --> 01:39:50,707
Your mother passed away.

1689
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:52,934
I performed her last rites.

1690
01:39:54,624 --> 01:39:55,624
Look there.

1691
01:40:01,267 --> 01:40:02,765
Why is he like this?

1692
01:40:02,803 --> 01:40:05,299
What can we do?
Let it go.

1693
01:40:22,425 --> 01:40:26,765
"You were on a journey in this Earth."

1694
01:40:26,803 --> 01:40:31,910
"When it ends, death is the only way out."

1695
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:36,864
"Time passes, it shifts
But it is not yours."

1696
01:40:37,056 --> 01:40:42,086
"Nobody is here to stay
Nothing is real here."

1697
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:47,424
"Did I ask to be born?"

1698
01:40:47,462 --> 01:40:51,456
"This life was a gift from you, Mother."

1699
01:40:52,493 --> 01:40:57,638
"Did you consider me a burden?"

1700
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:02,784
"Your poor son is all alone now."

1701
01:41:04,089 --> 01:41:08,851
"I lived just for you..."

1702
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:13,536
"But that time has passed now."

1703
01:41:13,574 --> 01:41:18,720
"You were my everything, my son."

1704
01:41:18,758 --> 01:41:23,251
"Just to bring you into this world..."

1705
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:28,089
"I took this life, my son."

1706
01:41:39,571 --> 01:41:42,067
Ma, why did you leave me alone?

1707
01:41:42,297 --> 01:41:45,369
I haven't gone anywhere.
I'm still here with you.

1708
01:41:45,638 --> 01:41:48,173
Don't loiter around at night, okay?

1709
01:41:48,557 --> 01:41:50,285
Be good, okay?

1710
01:41:50,323 --> 01:41:51,590
Take care of your health.

1711
01:41:55,046 --> 01:41:58,925
"The Sun has shattered..."

1712
01:42:02,688 --> 01:42:07,795
"The Sun has shattered
It's the end of my daytime."

1713
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:12,864
"The skies have withered
It's the end of my nighttime."

1714
01:42:12,902 --> 01:42:18,086
"Without you, I have become a lie."

1715
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:23,078
"Without my shadow,
I have become lonely"

1716
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:27,763
"I have lost I have lost."

1717
01:42:28,224 --> 01:42:32,870
"I have lost you."

1718
01:42:32,909 --> 01:42:38,093
"A million deities
may come together."

1719
01:42:38,131 --> 01:42:43,085
"All the love in the world
may be showered on me."

1720
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:47,539
"But there's no one to protect me
the way you did"

1721
01:42:48,077 --> 01:42:49,113
Karna...

1722
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,264
Eat something!

1723
01:42:53,414 --> 01:42:55,795
Malar, how long has it been
since my mother died?

1724
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,365
About a month now.

1725
01:43:05,433 --> 01:43:07,507
What did you have that night?

1726
01:43:07,545 --> 01:43:09,043
You were unconscious for 3 days.

1727
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:12,230
What happened that day?

1728
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:15,187
Perumal asked me to
come to a bungalow in ECR.

1729
01:43:16,147 --> 01:43:18,105
Perumal introduced me to a judge.

1730
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:21,369
He asked me to stay till 2 am.

1731
01:43:22,022 --> 01:43:23,174
He made me drink...

1732
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:25,363
He gave me something else...

1733
01:43:26,822 --> 01:43:28,243
Karna...

1734
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,048
Something else happened too.

1735
01:43:37,305 --> 01:43:38,534
What happened?

1736
01:43:38,573 --> 01:43:40,723
Inspector Perumal just questioned me.

1737
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:43,142
Perumal is lying about something.

1738
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:47,520
It must be something Raaki hid.

1739
01:43:47,558 --> 01:43:49,632
Something Raaki hid?

1740
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,552
Where else did he hide stuff?

1741
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:56,659
Perumal thrashed us, asking if
Raaki gave us any stuff.

1742
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:57,697
Stuff?

1743
01:44:13,171 --> 01:44:14,093
Karna!

1744
01:44:14,131 --> 01:44:16,934
Karna, remember you gave
me 2 lakh rupees...

1745
01:44:16,973 --> 01:44:18,969
how did you get that money?

1746
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:20,966
- Sir...
- Yes?

1747
01:44:21,696 --> 01:44:24,614
- We need to get Kalai out of jail.
- We will...

1748
01:44:25,037 --> 01:44:26,803
Where did you get the money from?

1749
01:44:27,456 --> 01:44:31,910
The owner of the petrol bunk
Kalai worked at...

1750
01:44:32,294 --> 01:44:34,790
I stole it from him.

1751
01:44:36,019 --> 01:44:37,248
Don't lie.

1752
01:44:38,054 --> 01:44:39,859
The stuff that Raaki stole
is with you.

1753
01:44:39,897 --> 01:44:41,165
Where have you stashed it?

1754
01:44:41,203 --> 01:44:42,470
Where is it?

1755
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:44,736
- I've got the stuff...
- Where?

1756
01:44:45,235 --> 01:44:46,925
I've stashed it down there...

1757
01:44:46,963 --> 01:44:49,651
- Where?
- I've kept it...

1758
01:44:49,997 --> 01:44:51,187
Don't piss me off.

1759
01:44:51,571 --> 01:44:53,837
Did Raaki tell you
why I sent him to Pondicherry?

1760
01:44:54,182 --> 01:44:55,449
Pondicherry?

1761
01:44:56,294 --> 01:44:58,253
Why Pondicherry?

1762
01:44:59,213 --> 01:45:01,915
The 5 kilos of heroin that was seized
by the Customs in Pondicherry...

1763
01:45:01,939 --> 01:45:03,475
...my friend had possession of it.

1764
01:45:03,513 --> 01:45:06,048
I sent Raaki to Pondicherry
to get it.

1765
01:45:06,547 --> 01:45:09,734
That scumbag tried to
escape with the stuff.

1766
01:45:09,773 --> 01:45:11,385
I found him after 5 days...

1767
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,424
I chased him.

1768
01:45:24,134 --> 01:45:25,134
Hey, that's Raaki.

1769
01:45:26,822 --> 01:45:28,550
- Dude!
- Raaki!

1770
01:45:28,589 --> 01:45:29,625
Where were you?

1771
01:45:29,664 --> 01:45:34,157
That idiot ran away from me and escaped,
only to die in the hands of Kaliyan!

1772
01:45:34,195 --> 01:45:36,422
I took Raaki's phone from him.

1773
01:45:36,461 --> 01:45:39,763
I checked his call logs.

1774
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,758
He spoke to a local drug dealer
from Parrys.

1775
01:45:42,797 --> 01:45:44,717
I thrashed that guy
and interrogated him.

1776
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,675
But he knew nothing.

1777
01:45:46,713 --> 01:45:48,518
I have no idea where the stuff is.

1778
01:45:49,133 --> 01:45:50,093
Did he give it to you?

1779
01:45:50,131 --> 01:45:51,245
Is it with you?

1780
01:45:51,283 --> 01:45:52,896
Tell me.

1781
01:45:53,894 --> 01:45:54,931
Doctor...

1782
01:45:56,621 --> 01:45:58,195
Karna?

1783
01:45:58,233 --> 01:45:59,693
Karna, get up.
Don't fall asleep.

1784
01:46:00,115 --> 01:46:02,726
It's worth 50 million.
Please make him talk.

1785
01:46:02,765 --> 01:46:04,454
We can't do anything more.

1786
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:06,528
Give him another dose.
Let's see if he wakes up.

1787
01:46:06,566 --> 01:46:09,101
- He may die if we give more.
- Then let him die.

1788
01:46:09,139 --> 01:46:12,326
You could have questioned him
at the police station. Why bring him here?

1789
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:15,552
I am doing something illegal.
How could I question him legally?

1790
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:18,816
Once he finds out it's worth 50 million,
what if he tries to make a run too?

1791
01:46:18,854 --> 01:46:22,003
Don't give me unsolicited advice.
I'm already here on a punishment posting.

1792
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,885
Everyone in the
department is watching me.

1793
01:46:23,923 --> 01:46:25,689
Just do it!

1794
01:46:25,728 --> 01:46:28,454
Karna, did Raaki tell you anything?

1795
01:46:29,606 --> 01:46:31,257
Did he say where he hid it?

1796
01:46:31,872 --> 01:46:33,984
You were with him, when he died.
Tell me!

1797
01:46:34,291 --> 01:46:36,787
- He said...
- Yes, tell me...

1798
01:46:37,171 --> 01:46:38,323
What did he say?

1799
01:46:38,515 --> 01:46:41,280
Marb... marb... marbles.

1800
01:46:41,318 --> 01:46:42,509
Marb?

1801
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:46,003
Marb... marb... marbles.

1802
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,613
Perumal, what is this?

1803
01:46:56,678 --> 01:46:59,942
Marb... marb... marbles.

1804
01:47:02,285 --> 01:47:04,973
When Raaki died...

1805
01:47:05,011 --> 01:47:08,352
he said "marbles".
Now I know why.

1806
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,617
Not just that...

1807
01:47:11,078 --> 01:47:14,496
I also know where he kid the stuff.

1808
01:48:09,139 --> 01:48:10,560
- Go away!
- Sir...

1809
01:48:10,598 --> 01:48:13,785
Poor guy, he didn't even get to see
his mother's body.

1810
01:48:13,824 --> 01:48:15,513
So he's gone crazy.

1811
01:48:15,552 --> 01:48:17,433
Spare the poor guy.

1812
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:44,774
'A FEW EVENTS LATER...'

1813
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,720
Dude!

1814
01:48:56,832 --> 01:48:58,022
Hey, buddy...

1815
01:48:58,483 --> 01:49:01,478
Dude, how are you doing?
Been ages since I saw you.

1816
01:49:01,517 --> 01:49:03,667
- Kalai!
- How are you, Kalai?

1817
01:49:04,243 --> 01:49:07,085
- Shorty, how are you?
- I'm good, brother.

1818
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:09,389
You don't have to worry
about anyone now.

1819
01:49:09,811 --> 01:49:12,115
- Thanks a lot, dude.
- Don't thank me.

1820
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:17,301
Bro, stand up.

1821
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:30,240
I'm so happy now, Malar.

1822
01:49:31,085 --> 01:49:32,352
I got Kalai out somehow.

1823
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,965
- You are a big-shot now.
- Karna...

1824
01:49:34,003 --> 01:49:34,733
Come in!

1825
01:49:34,963 --> 01:49:36,729
- Why me?
- Just come.

1826
01:49:36,768 --> 01:49:37,768
Go.

1827
01:49:37,805 --> 01:49:39,725
- Dude, I don't think...
- Just come!

1828
01:49:40,147 --> 01:49:42,067
- Ma!
- Don't do this!

1829
01:49:42,835 --> 01:49:45,715
Ma, Karna did nothing wrong.

1830
01:49:45,753 --> 01:49:47,865
He's the reason
I got out of jail.

1831
01:49:53,011 --> 01:49:56,083
- I'm sorry.
- Bless you, son.

1832
01:50:00,038 --> 01:50:01,038
What, dad?

1833
01:50:03,648 --> 01:50:05,145
Your son is back now.

1834
01:50:05,529 --> 01:50:06,758
How about a party?

1835
01:50:07,373 --> 01:50:09,024
Shall I get you some liquor?

1836
01:50:10,368 --> 01:50:13,670
- Shorty, get us a quarter.
- Right away, brother.

1837
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:21,696
Karna managed to get you out somehow.
I am so happy.

1838
01:50:22,694 --> 01:50:25,497
I wish Raaki...
- Sister, Kalai got you a gift.

1839
01:50:25,766 --> 01:50:26,611
Want to see?

1840
01:50:26,649 --> 01:50:28,147
- A gift? For me?
- Yes.

1841
01:50:28,185 --> 01:50:29,069
What is it?

1842
01:50:29,107 --> 01:50:32,179
- Come with me.
- What is it? Tell me!

1843
01:50:32,217 --> 01:50:34,752
Come and see it for yourself!
There is your gift.

1844
01:50:35,635 --> 01:50:37,977
We looked everywhere in the city
for Laundry Murugan.

1845
01:50:38,016 --> 01:50:41,318
We finally found him near
Vadapalani Murugan Temple, doing laundry.

1846
01:50:41,817 --> 01:50:44,006
I've forgotten him.
Why did you bring him here?

1847
01:50:44,045 --> 01:50:45,350
He hasn't forgotten you.

1848
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:48,230
He's named his daughter Pushpa.
In your memory.

1849
01:50:48,269 --> 01:50:49,766
His wife is no more.

1850
01:50:49,805 --> 01:50:52,070
He's struggling with
a daughter all alone.

1851
01:50:53,145 --> 01:50:54,413
What are you going to say now?

1852
01:50:54,451 --> 01:50:56,064
That you've forgotten him?

1853
01:50:56,947 --> 01:50:58,291
Then what does this mean?

1854
01:50:59,635 --> 01:51:01,593
She hid your picture
between her sarees!

1855
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:03,245
Here, keep it with you.

1856
01:51:09,811 --> 01:51:10,886
What?

1857
01:51:11,385 --> 01:51:12,576
Let's talk?

1858
01:51:15,072 --> 01:51:17,184
- Let's do it, dude!
- We'll seal the deal.

1859
01:51:25,478 --> 01:51:27,744
Great! You managed to
convince sister to settle down.

1860
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:30,086
It was a piece of cake to me.

1861
01:51:30,432 --> 01:51:31,968
- Great job, dude.
- Of course.

1862
01:51:32,544 --> 01:51:34,310
Look, its your girlfriend!

1863
01:51:36,691 --> 01:51:37,766
Go talk to her.

1864
01:51:38,995 --> 01:51:39,995
Go on.

1865
01:51:49,517 --> 01:51:50,517
I knew...

1866
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:52,934
- I knew you'd be back.
- Don't cry.

1867
01:51:59,117 --> 01:52:00,117
Hi!

1868
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:01,230
Hey!

1869
01:52:01,267 --> 01:52:03,379
Why did you hit me now?

1870
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,989
I was playing with you!

1871
01:52:11,597 --> 01:52:12,902
I'll call the police.

1872
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:13,977
Go ahead.

1873
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,936
Raaki...

1874
01:52:57,293 --> 01:52:58,982
I heard about everything
that happened.

1875
01:52:59,289 --> 01:53:00,480
I was dumbstruck.

1876
01:53:01,171 --> 01:53:02,477
What had really happened?

1877
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:05,088
How did you close the case?
How did you get me released.

1878
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:07,085
It's all mysterious!

1879
01:53:07,123 --> 01:53:10,310
Marb... marb... marbles!

1880
01:53:10,579 --> 01:53:12,768
Stop singing.
Tell me what happened!

1881
01:53:12,806 --> 01:53:15,456
I didn't get you out.

1882
01:53:15,494 --> 01:53:17,145
Raaki did!

1883
01:53:17,683 --> 01:53:19,833
Don't confuse me.
Just tell me.

1884
01:53:25,209 --> 01:53:27,552
Where did Raaki hide his marbles
when we were children?

1885
01:53:28,397 --> 01:53:30,086
Under the Saidapet bridge!

1886
01:53:30,969 --> 01:53:32,621
Why did Raaki go missing for 3 days?

1887
01:53:32,659 --> 01:53:34,387
Why did he say "Marbles" before he died?

1888
01:53:34,425 --> 01:53:37,613
Why did Perumal corner me?
I mulled over all of these questions!

1889
01:53:38,534 --> 01:53:42,182
I figured Perumal assigned Raaki
with some major task before he died.

1890
01:53:42,451 --> 01:53:45,177
So I took a wild guess
and checked below the bridge...

1891
01:53:47,981 --> 01:53:49,363
And I found it.

1892
01:53:50,054 --> 01:53:51,897
- What did you find?
- Heroin!

1893
01:53:51,936 --> 01:53:53,549
Imported powder!

1894
01:53:53,587 --> 01:53:55,315
- Really?
- Expensive stuff!

1895
01:53:55,353 --> 01:53:57,619
I wondered what to do with it...

1896
01:53:58,579 --> 01:54:01,037
I started playing Perumal's game.

1897
01:54:01,574 --> 01:54:03,614
- I'll go to the court and be back, sir.
- Go ahead.

1898
01:54:03,955 --> 01:54:06,566
Sir, you said you had to go
to the commissioner's office by 10?

1899
01:54:07,142 --> 01:54:09,485
- I'll take care. You leave.
- Hello, hello!

1900
01:54:09,523 --> 01:54:11,635
- Hello?
- Hello, sir.

1901
01:54:11,673 --> 01:54:13,286
I have a good news for you!

1902
01:54:13,325 --> 01:54:17,856
If I catch you, I'll break your
head and dump you in an asylum.

1903
01:54:17,894 --> 01:54:20,467
Sir, just hear me out...

1904
01:54:20,505 --> 01:54:23,078
The stuff you were looking for,
Raaki's stuff...

1905
01:54:23,846 --> 01:54:25,305
it's with me now.

1906
01:54:26,573 --> 01:54:28,109
Hold on...

1907
01:54:28,685 --> 01:54:29,990
Hello?

1908
01:54:31,181 --> 01:54:34,253
- Where are you now?
- At the Bus Factory near the airport.

1909
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:36,326
Are you coming here?
Or should I come there?

1910
01:54:36,365 --> 01:54:38,208
I'll come.
Stay there.

1911
01:54:38,592 --> 01:54:40,857
Come over, sir.
I'll wait here.

1912
01:54:44,429 --> 01:54:46,425
Marbles!

1913
01:55:02,669 --> 01:55:03,859
Sir!

1914
01:55:15,993 --> 01:55:18,221
- Where is it?
- I've hidden it in the terrace.

1915
01:55:18,259 --> 01:55:19,027
Why?

1916
01:55:19,065 --> 01:55:20,678
What if someone stole it from me?

1917
01:55:20,909 --> 01:55:22,176
From you?

1918
01:55:22,982 --> 01:55:24,019
Go!

1919
01:55:36,269 --> 01:55:37,344
Where did he go?

1920
01:55:41,529 --> 01:55:42,566
Hey...

1921
01:55:43,987 --> 01:55:45,216
You are late!

1922
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:46,445
Come.

1923
01:55:46,483 --> 01:55:47,673
Where's the stuff?

1924
01:55:47,712 --> 01:55:48,825
It's safe, sir.
Come on.

1925
01:55:49,478 --> 01:55:50,518
- Come, sir.
- Where is it?

1926
01:55:50,899 --> 01:55:51,974
This way...

1927
01:55:58,886 --> 01:56:00,077
Here you go.

1928
01:56:12,057 --> 01:56:13,248
Sir?

1929
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:14,899
Is it heroin?

1930
01:56:17,357 --> 01:56:18,662
Having a good trip?

1931
01:56:18,701 --> 01:56:20,313
How much would this sell for?

1932
01:56:21,158 --> 01:56:22,579
50 million.

1933
01:56:23,923 --> 01:56:27,187
You and Raaki made me run
behind you for this stuff, right?

1934
01:56:27,225 --> 01:56:28,377
You fraudsters!

1935
01:56:28,416 --> 01:56:29,760
You're dead today.

1936
01:56:31,219 --> 01:56:32,793
Sir, I just found it.

1937
01:56:32,832 --> 01:56:35,981
You couldn't sell it, so you are saying
you just found it, huh?

1938
01:56:36,019 --> 01:56:37,670
I've seen many criminals like you.

1939
01:56:37,709 --> 01:56:38,709
You filth!

1940
01:56:38,861 --> 01:56:41,433
You got the stuff now, right?
Get Kalai out!

1941
01:56:41,817 --> 01:56:44,198
- No way in hell!
- Sir, Kalai?

1942
01:56:44,237 --> 01:56:46,579
He's going to rot in jail.

1943
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,232
You mongrel.

1944
01:56:50,073 --> 01:56:53,184
- You betrayed me.
- Stop it, Karna.

1945
01:56:53,683 --> 01:56:56,217
You're the reason I couldn't even
see my mother one last time.

1946
01:56:56,256 --> 01:56:57,331
You piece of filth.

1947
01:56:58,483 --> 01:57:01,363
Karna, don't...
stop it.

1948
01:57:03,206 --> 01:57:04,243
Stop it!

1949
01:57:05,817 --> 01:57:08,198
Who are these guys?
Hit men?

1950
01:57:08,467 --> 01:57:09,811
Narcotics.

1951
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,845
Oh great! One minute...

1952
01:57:13,305 --> 01:57:15,456
Thank goodness you're here
at the right time.

1953
01:57:15,494 --> 01:57:16,838
Heroin worth 50 million.

1954
01:57:16,877 --> 01:57:19,027
I caught him red-handed.
Arrest him!

1955
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:20,411
Wow!

1956
01:57:21,638 --> 01:57:22,713
Perumal sir.

1957
01:57:23,443 --> 01:57:25,209
So Mita Sai Baba!

1958
01:57:25,248 --> 01:57:27,437
Sir, I can't believe he's laughing.
Arrest him.

1959
01:57:27,475 --> 01:57:29,433
Mr. Perumal, stop all this drama!

1960
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,430
He came to us
and told us everything.

1961
01:57:31,469 --> 01:57:33,312
He's lying, sir.
He is the criminal.

1962
01:57:33,926 --> 01:57:35,923
Boys, take off the cameras from here.

1963
01:57:39,149 --> 01:57:40,877
Sir, may we talk alone?

1964
01:57:40,915 --> 01:57:43,411
Perumal, the cameras
are still recording.

1965
01:57:43,449 --> 01:57:46,368
First, get those cameras off.
Cameras aren't new to me.

1966
01:57:46,406 --> 01:57:48,595
1... 2... 3... 10 of you.

1967
01:57:48,633 --> 01:57:51,206
Take 5 million per person.
I don't want a penny.

1968
01:57:51,245 --> 01:57:53,971
Mr. Muruga Perumal, we're a
bunch of clean hands in the department.

1969
01:57:54,009 --> 01:57:55,469
- Yes, boys?
- Yes, sir.

1970
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:57,005
Come on.

1971
01:57:57,734 --> 01:58:00,691
Marb... marb... marbles.

1972
01:58:00,729 --> 01:58:01,459
Throw him in the van.

1973
01:58:01,497 --> 01:58:03,494
Marb... marb... marbles.

1974
01:58:04,224 --> 01:58:07,373
Marb... marb... marbles.

1975
01:58:08,717 --> 01:58:09,717
Vetrivel!

1976
01:58:09,945 --> 01:58:11,597
Mukund, Rajesh.
Get in.

1977
01:58:11,635 --> 01:58:13,248
Start the vehicle.
Where is the driver?

1978
01:58:13,286 --> 01:58:14,721
He's gone to have tea.
He'll be back soon.

1979
01:58:14,745 --> 01:58:15,950
- Ask him to come immediately.
- Okay, sir.

1980
01:58:15,974 --> 01:58:17,395
Vetri, did you check
the recording?

1981
01:58:17,433 --> 01:58:18,509
- Yes, sir.
- Manick?

1982
01:58:19,584 --> 01:58:21,965
Karna got me caught
by Narcotics.

1983
01:58:22,003 --> 01:58:25,421
Chop him into pieces.
I'll pay you as much as you want.

1984
01:58:26,342 --> 01:58:27,379
Finish him.

1985
01:58:56,985 --> 01:58:58,061
Come on!

1986
01:58:59,021 --> 01:59:01,517
Tell me you want revenge for Kaliyan.
I'll give up!

1987
01:59:01,555 --> 01:59:03,053
But if it's for Perumal...

1988
01:59:03,091 --> 01:59:04,358
I'll slit you!

1989
01:59:05,165 --> 01:59:07,968
Perumal is trying to buy you over
with money.

1990
01:59:09,619 --> 01:59:11,232
I don't think that way...

1991
01:59:12,115 --> 01:59:15,417
- You're dead.
- We are people who value people...

1992
01:59:17,299 --> 01:59:18,758
Manick!

1993
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:25,593
Why are we killing each other
for filth like Perumal?

1994
01:59:25,632 --> 01:59:28,973
Who are they to decide
how we should live?

1995
01:59:32,889 --> 01:59:35,731
Manick, if you kill me now,
you'll end up in jail.

1996
01:59:35,769 --> 01:59:40,339
Your wife and children will end up
in the streets.

1997
01:59:40,377 --> 01:59:42,643
If you still want to kill me...
go ahead.

1998
01:59:51,513 --> 01:59:52,973
Manick, kill me.

1999
01:59:53,741 --> 01:59:55,008
Go ahead.

2000
01:59:59,462 --> 02:00:00,845
What happened after that?

2001
02:00:01,728 --> 02:00:03,341
Manick became friends with me!

2002
02:00:03,379 --> 02:00:05,760
Woah!
That's awesome, dude.

2003
02:00:06,259 --> 02:00:08,409
How did you break the case
and get me out?

2004
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:10,944
One pinch of that powder
goes for a lot of money.

2005
02:00:11,366 --> 02:00:14,093
I took a pinch from those 5 kilos.
That's how you got out!

2006
02:00:14,899 --> 02:00:17,779
Give them money,
they'll salute to anybody.

2007
02:00:18,701 --> 02:00:21,581
At least starting now,
we should lead a bright life.

2008
02:00:22,195 --> 02:00:23,501
Let's do it.

2009
02:01:18,221 --> 02:01:19,221
You leave!

2010
02:01:19,449 --> 02:01:21,408
He's the reason for all our problems!

2011
02:01:21,792 --> 02:01:23,992
We put an end to him,
we put an end to all our problems.

2012
02:01:24,787 --> 02:01:26,323
Don't get caught in this mess!

2013
02:01:27,437 --> 02:01:28,704
Listen to me, leave!

2014
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,893
- Karna...
- Kalai, leave.

2015
02:01:50,669 --> 02:01:51,974
Karna...

2016
02:01:55,430 --> 02:01:58,541
You can leave,
I have no issues with you.

2017
02:02:02,534 --> 02:02:03,763
Let him go.

2018
02:02:07,872 --> 02:02:09,062
Kalai...

2019
02:02:10,982 --> 02:02:12,134
Run away.

2020
02:02:13,209 --> 02:02:14,822
How can I?

2021
02:02:21,158 --> 02:02:23,117
Think of your parents
for a minute.

2022
02:02:23,731 --> 02:02:25,651
You don't deserve this.

2023
02:02:26,073 --> 02:02:27,187
Run.

2024
02:02:36,096 --> 02:02:37,478
Run away!

2025
02:02:38,707 --> 02:02:39,707
How can I?

2026
02:02:40,627 --> 02:02:41,627
Go!

2027
02:02:41,894 --> 02:02:42,894
Get going.

2028
02:02:57,523 --> 02:02:58,523
Go!

2029
02:03:45,139 --> 02:03:49,939
Karna, a 24 year old man
from Kaveri Nagar, Thoraipakkam...

2030
02:03:49,977 --> 02:03:54,547
...was shot dead by unknown men.
This has caused panic in the area.

2031
02:03:54,585 --> 02:03:57,350
Initial police investigation
has revealed that...

2032
02:03:57,389 --> 02:04:02,803
he was killed by due to a rivalry
between two gangs peddling weed.

2033
02:04:05,606 --> 02:04:07,027
Want an abortion?

2034
02:04:11,865 --> 02:04:14,323
Did he claim to love you,
knock you up, and run away?

2035
02:04:15,821 --> 02:04:16,857
No, doctor.

2036
02:04:17,472 --> 02:04:18,547
He died.

2037
02:04:32,409 --> 02:04:36,787
