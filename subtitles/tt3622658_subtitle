1
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,880
'DIL RANGEELA'

2
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,280
'Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.'

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,880
Hey!

4
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
Stay away!

5
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,960
Stay away! I won't forgive you!

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,320
No! Please stay away!

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
I came to see you!

8
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,440
Why did you introduce me to her?

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,120
She says her pain reduces
when she sees you!

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,160
Darn it!

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,880
My pain aggravates
when I see you.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,680
The pain exacerbates!

13
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,040
A girl's heart is just like you.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,640
You let anyone
write their names on it.

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Then, you erase it neatly
without anyone's knowledge.

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,360
But

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,040
a guy's heart is like a rock.

18
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,360
If he carves a girl's name
on his heart

19
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,680
even God can't erase it.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
It is like a rock.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,560
I will never forgive you!

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
Never!

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
Why do you need a bucket?
Are you going to take a shower?

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Empty the ocean!
Go on. Do it!

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,960
What? How is it even possible?
Are you crazy?

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,360
A man can confront
any kind of problem.

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,920
But..
- What?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
...it is difficult to live
when you are heartbroken.

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Hey!

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,680
She calls this beach
her closest friend.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,960
I couldn't tell her anything

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,960
but I have to teach
this beach a lesson.

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
I need to.. - Do you want me
to empty the ocean?

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes! Do it!

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
It is impossible to empty a pond

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
and you are talking
about emptying the ocean.

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,440
My story!
- Hey!

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,680
Tell me your story!
- Listen to my story!

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,160
My life used to be very good!

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,720
"If there's spice,
you can eat even tables."

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,960
"If our speech is apt,
we can live right."

42
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,040
"If there's spice,
you can eat even tables."

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,720
"If our speech is apt,
we can live right."

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,080
"I cook varieties of food.
You just have to taste it."

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,920
"That's my only passion."

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,560
"Life's colourful.."

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,880
"Life's like a sweet dish
and nothing more."

48
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,040
"Life's colourful.."

49
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,760
"If the taste's ruined
then no one will eat it."

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
"Life's colourful.."

51
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,680
"Life's like a sweet dish
and nothing more."

52
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,800
"Life's colourful.."

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
"If the taste's ruined
no one will eat it."

54
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,200
"If there's spice,
you can eat even tables."

55
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,360
"If our speech is apt
we can live right."

56
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,480
"Lemon rice, curd rice,
Dosa and Vada."

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,960
"I cook everything.
You must taste and tell me."

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,200
"Pizza, burger, brownie, pasta."

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,720
"I can cook western, eastern
and all other cuisines."

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,320
"Come on, here we go."

61
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,640
"The people we feed
shouldn't know how to cook."

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,280
"It would put me out
of business."

63
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,920
"It's easy to say,
difficult to follow."

64
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,400
"If it's tasty, then
it's not easy to control."

65
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,120
"It's difficult.."

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
"If we don't eat well,
then we would fall sick."

67
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,720
"If there aren't any hotels,
then it's so much trouble."

68
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
"Life's colourful.."

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
"Life's like a sweet dish
and nothing more."

70
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,920
"Life's colourful.."

71
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,000
"If the taste's ruined
no one will eat it."

72
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,280
"If there's spice,
you can eat even tables."

73
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,360
"Swing it on.."

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,640
"Shut the hell up, I say."

75
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,760
"Swing it on.."

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,080
"Come, let's get dressing."

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
"That's what you get people,
fish pepper fry."

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
"If you want sweets,
say 'Rabdi Malai'."

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,120
Pizza, burger and sandwich
is American style."

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
'Bisi Bele bath' is our style."

81
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,880
Cheers!

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,880
After working in so many
countries, you came to our place

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,360
and managed to impress our boss.
Well done.

84
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,080
Elders ask us not to run after
women, land and money

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,800
as they can make
our lives miserable.

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,760
But if we're lucky to get them, we
shouldn't let them go. - Correct.

87
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,880
Buddy, I'm glad you are
getting married, but be careful.

88
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,880
Be more specific
or I will beat you to death.

89
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,080
I will tell you
what he is trying to say.

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,480
The life of a bachelor is more fun
than the life of a married man.

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,360
If you marry her,
you will lose your freedom.

92
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,120
Then, what is the solution now?
- After you get married

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,520
you will have to obey her.

94
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,440
I suggest, you go to some place
and enjoy your bachelor life

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,520
to the fullest.

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,240
Suggest a place.
- Bangkok!

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,040
Idiot! Bangkok is
a honeymoon destination.

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Rajasthan. - Should I go there
and milk camels?

99
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,280
Darn it.

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Tell me a place.
- Buddy.

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,440
Yes.
- Goa!

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Why Goa?
- It is a wonderful place!

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
Like a bull needs more grass

104
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,280
a bachelor needs more drinks.

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,040
You get drinks at a low
cost there. Go, enjoy.

106
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,880
What shall I tell my boss?

107
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,160
Should I teach you how to lie?

108
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,400
I see.

109
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
Okay, sir!

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,960
Carry on..
- Bye, sir!

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,840
Excuse me, sir!

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,200
How was the party last night?
How much did you drink? - Sir, I..

113
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,120
Sir, I don't even eat food
that has excess oil.

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,760
Believe me, I feel dizzy
even if I pass by a bar.

115
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,840
What are you saying?
- I'm a very decent boy.

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,800
My dignity means everything to me.
Sir, believe me.

117
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,680
I haven't even seen
your daughter properly. - Hey!

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,440
Do you think I drink
and make merry with girls?

119
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
You should have fun at this age.

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,160
Only then, you can reminiscence
about it at my age.

121
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,760
Understand? Forget that.

122
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,400
Did you talk to your mother
about the engagement?

123
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Yes, sir.
- What did she say?

124
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,600
Our family has a custom.

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,600
We offer prayers to God
before doing anything auspicious.

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
Moreover, I have great devotion

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,560
for God, and respect
for elders and women.

128
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,960
So, I wish to go on a pilgrimage.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,560
You are so silly.
- Why, sir?

130
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,840
You needn't seek permission
to offer prayers or do charity.

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Is that so?
- Yes.

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,960
Thank you, sir.
- Dad! - Yes!

133
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,280
Come..

134
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,240
Hi, baby!
- Hello. - Priya.

135
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Preetham wishes to go
to the mountains before marriage!

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
Sir! - I mean
he's going on a pilgrimage!

137
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,680
No way! I won't let
him go anywhere alone!

138
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,720
I will go with him!

139
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,280
Take her along.

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
Sir, it is wrong to go
out together before the wedding.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,280
Preetham, times have changed.

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,440
No matter how modern the world is,
I don't go against my ethics.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't go against my customs.

144
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
Fantastic!
- Dad!

145
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,120
Preetham, I won't listen to you.
I'm coming with you. That's it.

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Yes! Correct! Go..
- Sir!

147
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,280
The roads to the temple
are pretty rough.

148
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,920
She will have to walk up the hill.
- I will walk.

149
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,320
You will have to swim
across rivers and lakes.

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,720
I know how to swim.
- Yes, she can.

151
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,320
It is a hot region,
your skin will get tanned

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,360
and you will end up looking ugly.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Dear, please don't go.
- Yes.

154
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Okay, Preetham. I'm not coming
with you. You carry on.

155
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,120
Won't you come?
- No.

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Really?
- Really.

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,960
I thought you would come.

158
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,400
O-Okay, I will take your leave.

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,640
Okay. - Thank you, sir!
- Be careful! Bye, baby!

160
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,680
Bye, boss!
- Happy pilgrimage!

161
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,920
"In the sun.."

162
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,280
"Get the party rolling,
have some fun."

163
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,320
"In the sun.."

164
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
"Let the music throw you up
and party nation.."

165
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,400
"In the sun.."

166
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,880
"Get the party rolling,
have some fun."

167
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
"In the sun.."

168
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,200
"Let the music throw you up
and rock your party nation."

169
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
"Tell me your dreams."

170
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,800
"Can't you see?
And you'll never want to fool me."

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
"Let's get on to the sun, bob!"

172
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,840
"You hear the beat"

173
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,200
"then you're lying on the shore.
Why won't you tell me?"

174
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,680
God, I see
only foreigners here.

175
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,960
I don't see Indians here. Please
send someone to keep me company.

176
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,840
"Are you ready.."

177
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,160
"Slow it down, you can't cheat me."

178
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,480
"Let me tell you how I know
I want it to be."

179
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
"Build it up till you let go."

180
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,920
"Jump up and say
hey, no.."

181
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,480
"Jump it up."

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,440
"Pump it up."

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,400
"Slow it down, you can't cheat me."

184
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
"Let me tell you how I know
I want it to be."

185
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
"Build it up till you let go."

186
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,240
"Jump up and say
hey, no.."

187
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,640
"Jump it up."

188
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,840
"Pump it up."

189
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Hello, ma'am!

190
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
Don't answer the call.
It's a wonderful song.

191
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,640
Hello!
Hello, Sister!

192
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,800
Hello..

193
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,960
I told you not to receive the call
because the network here is bad.

194
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
Which movie is the song from?

195
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
Hey, girl!

196
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Won't you talk to me?

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,240
I asked you because you're from
Karnataka. Which film is it?

198
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,400
'Mungaru Male'.
- What's your name?

199
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Believe it or not

200
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,040
I stood in the queue all day long
and bought tickets.

201
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,040
Someone told me that the hero
and heroine separate in the end.

202
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,080
So, I sold the ticket in black
and went back home.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,880
I don't like films
with a tragic end.

204
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,280
I didn't appear for my exams

205
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,800
as I didn't want to separate
the cap from the pen.

206
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,120
Promise! Believe me.

207
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,160
Say something.

208
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,000
People will think I'm mad
if they see me talking to myself.

209
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,400
Can you please..
- All right, I won't talk.

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,640
If I talk, you might
get impressed with me

211
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,040
and ask me out for coffee.
I will not bother you.

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,600
Excuse me. Who said
I will get impressed by you?

213
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
You will never see me again.

214
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,680
Hello, ma'am! God decides
whether we should meet or not!

215
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,480
Oh, no!

216
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,120
Hello, Sir! - Son-in-law!
How is the trip?

217
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,200
I finished prayers at one temple,
I'm now going towards the other.

218
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
I hear the bells. You must be
engrossed in prayers.

219
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,880
Yes, you are absolutely right!

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Please pray for me too.

221
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,280
I will be happy
only if you are happy.

222
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,080
I will first pray for you, then
your daughter, and then for myself.

223
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,080
You are really bold!

224
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,200
What?
- I mean, gold.

225
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,280
I will call you later.
I can't hear anything!

226
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,240
I will call you
after I have the offerings.

227
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,880
Okay! Enjoy..
- Bye..

228
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Wow!
What is this instrument?

229
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
Bell.
- Bell?

230
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
Yes. - Can you
give me your bell?

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,960
No, I can't give this!
This is my personal bell.

232
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,640
Well, I'll give you dollars!

233
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,640
No.. I can't give it to you!

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,760
Come to Bangalore, you will
find different types of bells.

235
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Big bells?
- You'll find big, small, medium!

236
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,240
You will find bells
of different sizes. - Okay. - Okay.

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,960
She is eyeing my bell.

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,480
Hey! Are you from Mumbai?
- No..

239
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,400
I am from Mysore. I've come
to Goa for the first time.

240
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
Sir, your beer.
- Okay. - Yes.

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,160
The dollar rate has increased,
but their dress size didn't.

242
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,120
Sir, what do you want to eat?

243
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,120
Do you have red millet ball?
You don't, right? - Right.

244
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Bring Chapatti and Dal.
- Okay, sir.

245
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,400
This is for you, sir.

246
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Are you from Karnataka?
- Yes!

247
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm Tony Brinjal from Muddenahalli,
birth place of Vishveshwarya.

248
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,200
Please take a seat!

249
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,440
I am so glad to meet you.

250
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
What do you do?
Are you a waiter?

251
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,640
I am the owner of this hotel.
- Superb!

252
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,080
You didn't forget red millet balls
even after coming to Goa.

253
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,760
A farmer must not forget his farms

254
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,480
and people of Karnataka shouldn't
forget red millet balls. - Correct.

255
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,400
Please have it.

256
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
How is the red millet ball?
- Very tasty.

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,520
Who are you?
Why have you come to Goa?

258
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,040
Sir, my name is Preetham. I've
done a hotel management course.

259
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,760
I joined as a chef in a hotel.

260
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,880
The owner of the hotel was
impressed with me and my cooking

261
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,400
and requested me
to marry his daughter.

262
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,600
Sir, I don't let go
of any opportunity.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
So, I accepted the offer
as soon as he asked me.

264
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,680
I am like you too.

265
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
My story is similar to yours.

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,680
I joined this hotel
as a dishwasher.

267
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,600
I managed to woo the owner's
daughter and married her.

268
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
I converted to Christianity.

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,960
Did the owner's daughter
fall in love with you?

270
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,800
I don't believe you.
- Say what you like.

271
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,240
I may look ugly now.

272
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,240
Earlier, when I used
to run down the shore

273
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,640
wearing shorts, the girls
would go crazy seeing me.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,680
Just try to imagine.

275
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,280
Enough! Come back!
- Okay..

276
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,680
Sir, you are
an experienced man.

277
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
Please teach me
how to act after marriage.

278
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,040
A man has to lie a lot
after marriage.

279
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,240
Sir, it's like you are teaching
a bold actress how to expose.

280
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I am an expert liar.
Tell me something else.

281
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,400
You should wife whatever
she asks for right away.

282
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,360
They are like alarm clocks.
Once they start ringing

283
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,640
you should calm them down.
If not, you can't sleep.

284
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Tell me more.

285
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,640
I will take you to
a party tonight.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,200
What kind of a party is that?

287
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,080
It is a game which fulfils
the desires of needy men.

288
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,080
Disgusting!
- No!

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,520
I am getting married.
I don't need another woman.

290
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,040
Though cricketer Sachin is expert
in batting, he practices daily.

291
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,840
Same with us.
Practice makes a man perfect.

292
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,960
I think you have been
practicing a lot.

293
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,960
I am like a thief

294
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,920
who can open many locks
with just one key.

295
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,360
Isn't there anyone in Goa?

296
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
There is one
below our house.

297
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,200
Won't your wife find out?

298
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,680
The bee gets attracted to flowers
and not to the tree.

299
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,480
That's my inspiration.

300
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,960
That's fantastic, sir..
- Concentrate!

301
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Sir, I will take your leave.
- Wait.

302
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Call me if you need anything
in Goa.

303
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,520
If you need women,
give me a missed call.

304
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
Sir, you are a man of desires.

305
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,640
Be careful.
Goa can be a dangerous place.

306
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
You will regret
if you aren't careful.

307
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,360
Okay, sir! Bye!

308
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
Wonderful!

309
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,560
Oh, God, how did you manage to put
so much salt into the sea?

310
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,280
You are great..
- Hello!

311
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
Excuse me!
- Who is it?

312
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,200
What are you doing here?

313
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,080
You said
you'll never meet me again.

314
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,880
It is He who decides our fate.
Am I right?

315
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,160
I have been trying to start
the scooter. Couldn't you help me?

316
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,560
If I had offered you my help

317
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,120
you would have abused me thinking
I'm following you from yesterday.

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,840
Stop talking. Please help me
start the scooter. - Right away.

319
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,600
I look handsome, don't I?

320
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,800
What is your name?

321
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,800
Khushi.
- Khushi..

322
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,200
Ms. Khushi,
I will tell you something.

323
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Listen to me carefully.

324
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,160
My parents taught me
how to cook.

325
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
They didn't teach me
how to fix a vehicle.

326
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,840
No matter how hard I try,
I won't be able to fix it.

327
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,560
Because I don't know anything
about vehicles.

328
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Why do you boast
about yourself so much?

329
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,920
Here's what you should do.
Just 1.5 kilometres from here..

330
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
Will I find a garage?
- No.

331
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,880
You will find an old man
sitting in a shop and smoking.

332
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,480
Ask him for a garage
and he will guide you.

333
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,600
Don't you feel ashamed
to tell a girl to tow a vehicle?

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,920
Ms. Khushi, if I offer help, you'll
think I'm trying to impress you.

335
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440
I asked you to tow the scooter
and you're insulting me.

336
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,320
Oh, my God! These girls
I tell you!

337
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,960
They are impossible..

338
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,120
All right.
What do we do now?

339
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,960
I can't help you tow the scooter.

340
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,400
Do this.
Get on my vehicle.

341
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,960
I will take you to all the places
you want to visit.

342
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,960
You are very smart.

343
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,120
Men will be men.

344
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,200
I will come,
but on one condition.

345
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,640
I will ride the vehicle
and you sit at the back.

346
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,960
No problem.

347
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,760
It doesn't really matter
who rides the vehicle.

348
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,240
Instead of using face creams
for glowing skin

349
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,960
drink tender coconut water.
Take it.

350
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
Show me your ID card.

351
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,160
They've put up boards
everywhere

352
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
warning us to stay
away from strangers.

353
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
I have come so far with you.

354
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,120
What if you molest me?
My life will be ruined.

355
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,520
I better be careful.
Show me your ID card.

356
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,240
Hello! A conversation
should always be two-sided.

357
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,800
Why are you quiet?
Please say something.

358
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,600
What is it?

359
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,280
I see you more than
I see local buses in Goa.

360
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,680
Are you from Goa?

361
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,840
I'm from Mysore.

362
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Mysore?
- Yes.

363
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,480
Mysore! Same pinch!

364
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm from Mysore too!

365
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Though we hail from the same city,
we were destined to meet in Goa.

366
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,720
What a miracle!

367
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,920
You are interacting with me
as if we are childhood friends.

368
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
Please stay quiet.

369
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,960
If we find someone
from Karnataka in a different state

370
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,280
we are bound to get close
to that person.

371
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Do you feel the same?
Me too.

372
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,720
Drink it. In Goa, you must drink
tender coconut during the day

373
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,240
and liquor during the night.

374
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,080
Why did you come to Goa?

375
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
My sister lives here.

376
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
I come here
whenever I get bored.

377
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,120
Do you come here
when you get bored? - Yes.

378
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,160
You should find a boyfriend,
you can punch him when bored.

379
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't have a boyfriend.

380
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,400
I guessed so! I realised you don't
have a boyfriend when I saw you

381
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,880
stranded on the road
on your bike with a flat tyre.

382
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,240
Hello! Don't try to lure me
because I'm handsome.

383
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm already engaged.
I'm marrying a rich girl.

384
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,080
I will lead a luxurious life
with her money.

385
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,080
Don't you love her?

386
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,080
Ma'am, I am the best lover
in the world.

387
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
The meaning of love is to trust,
have faith

388
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
and to stand by one another
during difficult times.

389
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,320
I have all the good qualities.

390
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,400
Look, what I said is true.
My fiancee is calling.

391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,000
Hi, baby!
Where are you?

392
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,360
I'm sitting
before the idol of a Goddess.

393
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,320
What?
- I have come to a temple.

394
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,120
The veneration is done.
I'm waiting for the oblation.

395
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't eat junk food
and drink only mineral water.

396
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay..
- Are you missing me, baby?

397
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
Obviously.
- Okay, baby.

398
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,320
Hello!
Hello..

399
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
Why are you walking away?

400
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,560
If I stay with you any longer,
I will become a liar too.

401
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,080
One gains confidence by lying.

402
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,760
By the way, what's your problem
if I lie to my fiancee?

403
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,880
You lied to your fiancee when
I'm standing right next to you.

404
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

405
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,080
Why not?

406
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,440
Why shouldn't I lie
if you are with me?

407
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
I will do what I like.

408
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,120
Hello! Khushi, you've come with me,
so I should give you a ride back.

409
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,480
You are left with no option.

410
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,040
Stop here..

411
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,720
Khushi, is this your house?

412
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,040
No, I live close by.
I will take a walk.

413
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,600
That's the problem with girls.

414
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,080
You don't trust the boy
you've been with all day!

415
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,480
But you give your contact number
to mobile recharge centres

416
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
and your house address
to the pizza delivery boys.

417
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Why do you do this?

418
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,040
Hello! They are not
as dangerous as you are.

419
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,080
I will never show you my house.
- Hey..

420
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,120
Khushi, go away..

421
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
I won't come to your house
even if you invite me. I promise!

422
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,120
I have self-respect too.

423
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,520
Ma'am..

424
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,240
Ma'am!

425
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Who is it?
- Greetings!

426
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,200
I'm Preetham,
Khushi's classmate.

427
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,560
I dropped her home last evening.

428
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,600
She is sleeping,
I will wake her up.

429
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,320
No.. Let's not disturb her.

430
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,280
The route was quite confusing.

431
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,480
I asked people in your locality
for your address

432
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,960
and they guided me here.

433
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,360
I got confused as I dropped her
at the end of the street. Sit down.

434
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,040
Please sit, ma'am.
Your walls have nice colours.

435
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,840
Khushi told me you prepare
tasty Masala Vadas.

436
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,760
That would be my husband, not me.

437
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,960
Then it must be Masala Dosa.

438
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,240
No, it's my husband who
prepares even that very well.

439
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
I see. Then, it must
be chicken Masala'.

440
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,520
No, I am a vegetarian.

441
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,400
What tasty dish do you cook then?

442
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,640
My husband cooks,
I only help him.

443
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,600
So, you don't know to cook.

444
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,840
Why did Khushi lie to me?
- I don't know.

445
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Ma'am, I will teach you to cook.
Where is the kitchen? - What?

446
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,560
The kitchen?
- On the left.

447
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,280
Being a woman, you don't
know to cook. I will teach you.

448
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,800
This is 'Bisi Bele Bath'.

449
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,920
If you add onions from
North Karnataka, it'll be tastier.

450
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,880
You hate non-vegetarian food.

451
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,040
If you add fish instead of onion,
it becomes Fish Pulao.

452
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,040
If you add goat meat,
it becomes Mutton Pulao.

453
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
If you add chicken,
it becomes Chicken Pulao.

454
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
Did you understand?
- Yes.

455
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,800
Khushi doesn't understand anything.

456
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,080
She is dumb. She often used to get
beaten up by the teacher at school.

457
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I used to see her
getting beaten up.

458
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,880
Hey, what are you doing here?

459
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,360
She is surprised!

460
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,800
She is surprised!
This is how she is.

461
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,080
At school, when I used
to step out of the toilet

462
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,280
she'd ask me what I was doing
there. What could I say?

463
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,840
Khushi, I made 'Bisi Bele Bath'.
I have taught her too. Have it.

464
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,040
I will meet you at the same place,
okay? Have it for breakfast too.

465
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,560
Khushi, he is a wonderful cook.
- Hey.. - Bye..

466
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,200
Sister, why did you allow him
inside the house?

467
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Obviously, he's your classmate.

468
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,520
What? Is he my classmate?
I met him only yesterday.

469
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,080
But he gave you a ride
back home yesterday, right?

470
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Idiot! If an auto driver drops me,
will you invite him too?

471
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,560
Did he lie to me?
- Yes.

472
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,520
How much is this?
- Rs. 500.

473
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,480
Rs. 500? - Yes.
- Make it Rs. 50.

474
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
No..
- I will buy two.

475
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,920
No, definitely..
- Please.. - Mister!

476
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,280
You barged into my house,
don't you have any common sense?

477
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,640
Common sense?

478
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,720
Did I barge into your bathroom?
I just came to your living room.

479
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,400
You said you will never
come into my house

480
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,920
but you barged into my house
and cooked food too.

481
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
Don't you feel ashamed?

482
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,080
Believe me.
I didn't want to come.

483
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,800
I was drunk last night
and didn't have dinner.

484
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,760
God came in my dreams

485
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,680
and said 'Dear, I'm sad as you
didn't have dinner last night'.

486
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,840
I said, 'I didn't like the food
in Goa'

487
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,320
and He said,
'My dear, don't worry.'

488
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,360
'Go to Khushi's sister's house
and eat Karnataka food.'

489
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,200
I said, 'I can't go
as I have sworn by you.'

490
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,440
So God said, 'I don't care.'

491
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,080
'You have been breaking promises
from childhood, I'm used to it.'

492
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,320
'So, go and have your food'.

493
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,840
Hence, the moral of the story is

494
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,760
why do you mind, when
God Himself doesn't mind?

495
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,600
You are so disgusting.

496
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,280
You met my sister
for the first time and lied to her.

497
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,920
I wonder how much you would've
lied to your fiancee to woo her.

498
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,400
Ms. Khushi, ask me what
my love story is directly.

499
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,360
Why are you beating
around the bush?

500
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I will tell you how we fell in love
with each other.

501
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,800
I decked myself up
and attended an interview.

502
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,720
What are you doing?

503
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,640
Well, I was trying
to see your file.

504
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,720
If you'd asked me,
I would've shown it to you myself.

505
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,400
Here.

506
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,480
Please don't attend the interview.

507
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,280
You will surely get the job.

508
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,840
Please do me a favour.
Go back.

509
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,480
Why should I help you?

510
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,080
I am in deep sorrow
and I need your help.

511
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,160
If that is so, I will take everyone
and go away.

512
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,480
You will be the only candidate
here and you'll get the job.

513
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,680
Tell me about your sorrow.

514
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Thank God!

515
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,200
On the day of 'Ugadi', my parents
and I sat down for lunch.

516
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,640
My mother was feeding my father.

517
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,640
My father fell in love
with my mother and bit her hand.

518
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,720
My mother got angry
and bit my father's hand.

519
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,960
My father got angry
and bit my mother's cheek.

520
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,680
My mother should've applied
ointment and sat quietly

521
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,320
but she didn't do that.

522
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,160
She bit my father's nose.

523
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,400
My father got angry again,
and bit her ear.

524
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,440
They are battling
for their lives now.

525
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,880
Their condition is critical.

526
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,160
I need money to save them.

527
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,880
I need this job for the money.

528
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,480
People usually make merry
during festivals

529
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,200
but your parents
almost killed each other.

530
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,160
Preetham, it's your turn.

531
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay, I will do something.
- Thank you.

532
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,160
Hello, sir!

533
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,680
Welcome..
- Dad!

534
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Sit down.
- Thank you.

535
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,560
Do you dress up like this
to attend an interview?

536
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,720
Ma'am, I believe I am not here
for a fashion show.

537
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Please ask questions
regarding the job.

538
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,560
What is your name?
- Preetham.

539
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,800
Have you brought
your birth chart? - Pardon me.

540
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,720
Dad.
- I mean, bio-data. - Yes, sir.

541
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,240
If you want to ask everything,
what am I here for?

542
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,560
Go ahead.

543
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,880
So, why did you choose
the hotel industry as a career?

544
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,160
Ma'am, the only thing people do
without getting tired is eating.

545
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,000
I felt there's scope in this
profession, so I chose this field.

546
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Wow!

547
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,680
So, who is your favourite chef?
- My mother.

548
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,640
What?
- Yes.

549
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,800
We learn about taste when a mother
feeds us food cooked by her.

550
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,920
That taste is unbeatable.

551
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,520
Wow..

552
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,080
"A mother is everything." - God!
- "She would never change."

553
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,040
"No matter what happens."

554
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,920
Stop it, Dad!
- Superb!

555
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
He talks really well.

556
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,520
Dad, don't be silly.
We can't hire people who talk well.

557
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
I don't just talk.

558
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,520
I also make delicious food which
leaves people speechless. - Oh!

559
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,520
What style of food
is your specialty?

560
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,880
Whatever I do is special.
- Tell me the menu.

561
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,840
'Mangalore Buns.'
'Mysore Pak'.

562
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,440
Appetizers from Gauripalya.
Davanagere's 'Benne Dosa'.

563
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,600
Hubli's 'Jolada Roti',
Belgaum's 'Kunda'.

564
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
Tamil Nadu's 'Pongal'.
Kerala's 'Appam'.

565
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,320
Andhra's Biryani.

566
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,120
And Karnataka special

567
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,240
'Uppsaaru, Soppsaaru, Bassaaru!'

568
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
I also make red millet balls

569
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,320
round like a ball
and soft like cotton.

570
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,520
Ours is
an International Star Hotel.

571
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes..
- It's not some local hotel.

572
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,840
Mexican tacos, Italian pasta,
pizza, Chinese fried rice, noodles

573
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,920
Japanese Sushi and Sashimi

574
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,160
and American Continental Food!
What do you want?

575
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,480
They say, something
is better than nothing.

576
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,840
We must be fortunate to have
such an efficient candidate.

577
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,320
Dad, please don't get
carried away by him.

578
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,200
But he is so talented.
Think about it.

579
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,160
Don't let him go. He will save our
business from getting ruined.

580
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,960
Okay. You will be on training
for three months.

581
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,160
Then, we will make you
a permanent employee.

582
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,840
Yes, three months training.

583
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,080
But I have a condition.
- What is it?

584
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,880
There's a guy named Giri
sitting outside.

585
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,560
I want him as my assistant.

586
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,160
Done. Do you want us
to hire more people?

587
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,640
Dad!
- Please work with us.

588
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,800
Goodbye to Brindavan Group!
- Sir?

589
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,720
I mean, welcome to Brindavan Group!
- Thank you, sir.

590
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,920
Prepare for tomorrow's
conference, okay? - Okay, sir.

591
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,440
Hello, sir.
- Preetham.

592
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,480
Why did you send for me?

593
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,520
Drink? - No, thanks.
I don't drink.

594
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,080
What do you think
about my daughter?

595
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Sir, your daughter..

596
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm grateful to your daughter

597
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,360
for giving me a job.
- Fantastic!

598
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
I will tell you a secret.

599
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,960
Our hotel has started doing well
only after you joined.

600
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,760
I am happy because of you.

601
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,320
My daughter gave you a job,
what can you do for her?

602
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,640
Sir? - I mean,
will you do me a favour?

603
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,920
What do you mean?
- Will you marry her?

604
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,000
Sir, I think you are drunk.

605
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,040
Sir, you are asking me so casually.

606
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,120
No, I'm serious.

607
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,240
My daughter rejected
all the marriage proposals.

608
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,640
I don't know why,
when I talk about you

609
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,280
I see a smile on her face.

610
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,120
Her eyes twinkle.

611
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Will you marry her?

612
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,920
It's not just mine,
it is my daughter's wish too.

613
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
She loves you.

614
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,960
Sir, will you give me a minute?

615
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,920
All right.
- Excuse me.

616
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,600
Mom, you always said

617
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,760
that I am destined
to become a rich man.

618
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,960
Mom, the time has come now..

619
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,720
Preethu, if you accept
the marriage proposal

620
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,720
you will be rich!

621
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,080
Buddy, you are so lucky!

622
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,240
I must say,
you are very fortunate.

623
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,760
Preetham..
- Sir?

624
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,360
You want to accept
the marriage proposal

625
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,520
but you are wondering
how to say it. Am I right?

626
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,360
No, sir. I am confused.
I don't know what to say.

627
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,360
I am.. - You are in the toilet,
so don't worry.

628
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,160
Sir, I want to talk
to my mother about it.

629
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,000
She should agree first..

630
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Even I hid myself in the toilet
when I went to meet the girl.

631
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,160
If a guy hides himself in the
toilet, it means that he agrees.

632
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Sir, that's not.. - I'll share
the good news to my daughter.

633
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,120
Okay?
- Sir..

634
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,800
Hereafter, you are
the broker of this hotel.

635
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,280
Sir? - I mean, you're the owner.
Come on, hug me.

636
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,720
Hug me.. - Sir..
- Hug me..

637
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,160
Okay, bye!
Good luck. - Sir..

638
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,480
This is my decent love story.

639
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,760
Oh, my..

640
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you marrying a girl
for her money?

641
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,480
People have different reasons
to marry.

642
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,360
One evaluates character
and gets married.

643
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Others see beauty.

644
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,960
In the same way,
I am marrying her for money.

645
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,360
If I am wrong,
then, all of them are wrong.

646
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,320
How can you marry someone
you don't love?

647
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,880
I will fall in love with her
after the wedding.

648
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,720
Hello, boss! - How come I hear
bells ringing at this hour?

649
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,960
Boss, I've come to a special place.

650
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
The specialty of this place

651
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,520
is that you can hear the sound
of bells ringing 24 hours.

652
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,960
If not, there'll be a thunderstorm.

653
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,200
Baby, isn't it a strange belief?
- Yes, boss. I felt the same way.

654
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,680
I realised that the bells
are very powerful.

655
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,560
Is it?
- Shall I call you later?

656
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,960
You know what,
after you finish your work..

657
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,560
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay, boss. Bye, good night.

658
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,440
I lied to her.

659
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,400
Poor girl.
Why do you lie to her?

660
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,320
If I meet her,
I'll reveal the truth to her.

661
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,360
You'll never meet her,
so, you can't tell her.

662
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Who taught you to lie?

663
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,440
There was a VJ for a show named
'Comedy Time' on Udaya TV.

664
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,040
I learnt it from him.
- Oh, God.

665
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
I shall leave. Goodbye.

666
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,320
Oh, God.

667
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,280
Khushi,
why are you standing here?

668
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,240
Death is not a solution
to everything.

669
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,160
If God had plans to kill you

670
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,360
He would've made you an animal
and not a beautiful girl. Don't!

671
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Leave my hand!
I'm haven't come here to die.

672
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,800
I come here
whenever I feel low.

673
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,280
I love the beach.
It's my best friend.

674
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Best friend? Is it this place?
Khushi?

675
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,880
It is so cold here.
Why are you standing here?

676
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,120
I don't know why,
but whenever I come here

677
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
I strongly believe
that my parents are watching me.

678
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,680
Your parents?

679
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,240
I don't see anyone here.

680
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,160
They are no more.

681
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,840
I'm sorry.

682
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,440
My parents died in the Tsunami,
two years ago.

683
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,360
My parents always took me
wherever they went

684
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,040
but for the first time,
they left me alone.

685
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,240
They never returned.

686
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,760
I had a friend named Vicky

687
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,640
who took good care of me.

688
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,960
I trusted him blindly.

689
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,480
Later, I learnt that he has cheated
many innocent girls like me.

690
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,080
I come here when I feel low.

691
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,640
Khushi, change your name
to 'Novu', meaning sadness.

692
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,320
It would suit you.

693
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,800
Why are you crying
over a stupid guy?

694
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,280
When you smile

695
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,160
you get a dimple.
Hundreds of boys will fall for it.

696
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,920
Come on, cheer up.

697
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,080
Why are you crying?
Come on, let's go..

698
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,600
"This life"

699
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,680
"is so colourful.."

700
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,840
"Show the happy beat."

701
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,520
"Sit on the beach
right in the morning."

702
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,440
"Hold a bottle of beer
in your hand."

703
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
"Smoke cigarettes,
one after the other."

704
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,160
"Just come over to Goa."

705
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,320
"This life"

706
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:02,240
"is so colourful.."

707
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,240
"Spend money at the casino."

708
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,680
"Don't miss out on the massages."

709
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,720
"But wear your sunglasses
without fail."

710
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,240
"Don't stop flirting
with these beauties."

711
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,800
"Cool and spicy Goa."

712
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
"Everyone go crazy in Goa."

713
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,040
"Boozing up in Goa."

714
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
"Let's meet some chicks in Goa."

715
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,640
"Life's a sport,
play it well."

716
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,880
"Even if you're bored,
don't rest."

717
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,320
"Don't feel bad
or get emotional."

718
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,360
"Be sportive
in happiness and sorrow."

719
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,200
"Be happy,
never be with a sad face."

720
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,520
"Roam on the beaches
without worry."

721
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,960
"If you don't,
then life isn't fun."

722
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
"Don't think too much,
just come to Goa."

723
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,520
"Sit on the beach
right in the morning."

724
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,920
"Hold a bottle of beer
in your hand."

725
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,200
"Smoke cigarettes,
one after the other."

726
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,360
"Just come over to Goa."

727
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,080
"Don't be angry,
say yes to friendship."

728
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,920
"Life's all about
love and friendship."

729
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,040
"Life's like liquor spreading joy"

730
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,800
"all around,
smile, my friend."

731
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,520
"Drink as much as you want to."

732
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,160
"Forget all restrictions!"

733
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,640
"Enjoy with all these beauties."

734
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,880
"But wait for the
right companion."

735
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,440
"Wear your shorts
and come over to Goa."

736
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,600
"Sit on the beach
right in the morning."

737
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,640
"Hold a bottle of beer
in your hand."

738
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,800
"Smoke cigarettes,
one after the other."

739
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,320
"Just come over to Goa."

740
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,960
Preetham, stop..

741
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,960
Stop! - Why, Khushi?
What's the matter?

742
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,160
Is someone following you?

743
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,640
Who is it?
I will kill you!

744
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,280
Hello? What did you just say?

745
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,160
I said, I'm will kill the person
following you in Konkani.

746
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,400
Preetham, don't go overboard.
Will you do as I say?

747
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,160
Do you want me to shift
Goa to Mysore?

748
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
Should I shift the beach
to your house?

749
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,520
That's not required.

750
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,760
Hey!
- Come, sleep here.

751
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,000
Do you want me
to sleep on the road?

752
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,640
People gossip when they see
a couple sitting in the park.

753
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,960
You're calling me to sleep next
to you, on the road, at this hour.

754
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,040
Please come.
- No way..

755
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,640
Hey! Come on!

756
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,320
Mahatma Gandhi had said

757
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,680
that if a girl walks on the street
at midnight in our country

758
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,080
it would mean that
we are independent.

759
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,920
Girls are now sleeping on the road
at midnight.

760
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,400
Are you happy, now?
What next?

761
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,200
Do you know?
Whenever I feel very happy

762
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,320
I like to sleep like this, look
up in the sky and talk to it.

763
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,400
Why did you make me sleep
on the road, with you?

764
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,480
We could have chatted
while standing somewhere.

765
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,920
Preetham!

766
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,920
Tell me.

767
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,240
I'm really very happy
and that's because of you!

768
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,760
I never thought that I could
forget that idiot Vicky.

769
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,480
But from the moment you told me,
I don't know what happened to me.

770
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,800
I don't miss him anymore.

771
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,400
Preetham, once again,
I thank you so much.

772
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,560
It's okay. People who face
problems with a smile

773
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,520
aren't troubled even by God.
That's my policy.

774
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,120
Okay..
It's your turn now.

775
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,560
What do you feel now?

776
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,480
I..
- Yes.

777
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,880
It's so late

778
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,960
the bar will be closed.
Where will I get the booze now?

779
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,280
Oh, God!

780
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,320
You always talk about drinks.

781
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,480
It is like slow poison
and it will kill you.

782
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,400
Hello, I don't wish
to die so soon.

783
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,040
I want to die slowly.

784
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,280
You are laughing.

785
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,560
I've never fell down on the road,
even when I was drunk.

786
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,440
And you made me sleep on the road
without even getting drunk.

787
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,560
Come, let's go.
- Okay.

788
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,120
I don't know if I'll remember
anything about Goa.

789
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,840
But I will never forget the
experience of sleeping on the road

790
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,600
looking up in the sky
and talking to it.

791
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,440
Oh, look there.

792
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,680
Pubs in Goa are open all day
and night like medical stores.

793
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,520
I want to get drunk.
What about you?

794
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,920
No, I don't drink.
- A little..

795
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,600
No. - Okay, I'll drink
your share too. Come.

796
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,080
Thank you.

797
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,520
Hey baby, come back.
- Just a minute.

798
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,840
Go and come back.

799
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,880
Hello.
- Hello.

800
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,560
Drink well.

801
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,640
Looking very nice.
- Vicky? - Thank you.

802
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,760
Vicky? You just said you forgot him
and now you are chanting his name.

803
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,400
The person I told
you I have forgotten

804
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,960
is right here.

805
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,800
Richard. - Thanks.
- You're welcome.

806
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,920
Here.
- Thank you.

807
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,000
That guy? Is he Vicky?
- Yes.

808
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,120
You smell good.

809
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,560
God, what is this?

810
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,200
You don't give us boons

811
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,320
but you manage to shock us
from time to time. Great!

812
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,960
His sight makes me recollect
our old times.

813
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,600
Let's go from here.

814
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,120
How far can you go?
100 kilometres or 200 kilometres?

815
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,640
No matter where you go,
the memories will follow you.

816
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,960
You have to learn to face them.

817
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,960
Thank you.

818
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,600
Why are you drinking water?
Change your drink. - That's okay.

819
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,360
Will you do as I ask?
- What?

820
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,360
Go and slap him on the face.
- What?

821
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,480
Preetham, what are you saying?

822
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,640
Khushi, people who don't fear,
die once

823
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,160
but a coward dies
every moment.

824
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,840
If you want to close the chapter
of Vicky once and for all

825
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,160
go and slap him now.

826
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Vent out your anger.

827
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,000
Khushi,
even I can't bear to see him.

828
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,800
Why are you quiet?

829
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,440
You should slap him so hard

830
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,080
that he will think twice
before deceiving a girl.

831
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,640
You should slap him.
Go, Khushi.

832
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,600
No.
- Come on, Khushi.

833
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,200
You can do it!
Come on, go.

834
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,640
Khushi, he cheated on you,
didn't he? - Yes.

835
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,200
Aren't you angry?
- Yes. - You are angry!

836
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,120
Then, vent out your anger on him.

837
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,720
Go and slap him. Okay?

838
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,360
Come on, go..

839
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,960
You can do it Khushi. Go!

840
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,360
Go.

841
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,800
"Are you ready?"

842
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,240
"Slow it down, you can't cheat me."

843
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,640
"Let me tell you how I know
I want it to be."

844
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,440
"Build it up till you let go."

845
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,080
"Jump up and say
hey, no.."

846
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,400
"Jump it up."

847
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,640
"Pump it up."

848
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,480
"Slow it down, you can't cheat me."

849
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,840
"Let me tell you how I know
I want it to be."

850
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,960
"Build it up till you let go."

851
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,400
"Jump up and say
hey, no.."

852
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,960
You're so cool!

853
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,360
Khushi?

854
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,720
Do you think I am sad

855
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,320
because you ditched me?

856
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,760
What do you think of yourself?
You loafer!

857
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,520
Khushi? - Dirty fellow! You think
I'll be alone if you leave me? Dog!

858
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,680
Khushi, what are you saying?
- Do you think girls are toys?

859
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,960
You swine!
- Khushi!

860
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,160
Scoundrel!
- What are you saying?

861
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,880
Idiot! Rascal!

862
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,960
If I ever see you
with any other girl..

863
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,040
Listen to me.
- You'll have to carry

864
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,600
a birth certificate to prove
that you are a boy.

865
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,760
Khushi, mind your language.
- Do you understand? You..

866
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,360
Idiot.

867
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,600
Preetham!

868
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,440
I did it!
- Very good.

869
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,400
I am so happy today!

870
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Yes, man!

871
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,120
I feel like getting drunk.

872
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,080
Come, let's go.
- Yes.

873
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,680
Come.
- Yes, let's go. - Yes..

874
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,880
Goa is called
a drinkers' paradise.

875
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,720
But I couldn't find any booze.
I saw it in the room next door.

876
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
So, I stole it.

877
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,040
Many guys get drunk
because of a girl.

878
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,600
I am lucky that I am
drinking with a girl.

879
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,040
Have it..

880
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Preetham, I'm drinking for the
first time. Will I be fine?

881
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,920
No problem. Drink.

882
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,160
Booze is like an extended family.

883
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,680
You feel strange when they arrive

884
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,840
but once you gel with them,
you begin to feel good.

885
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,280
Drink it up in one gulp.
That's Shakeela. - What?

886
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,840
I mean, Tequila.

887
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,120
Here, suck on the lemon.
You'll feel good.

888
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,040
Okay? I'll drink it now.

889
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,680
Have one more,
you'll feel much better.

890
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
I hope it won't harm me.

891
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,200
No, drink it. Come on..
It's all good.

892
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,440
Khushi, I thought I was
a fast drinker

893
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,800
but you are faster than me,
even though it's your first time.

894
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,040
Preetham, shall I
tell you the truth?

895
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,440
You shouldn't tell anyone.
- No way.

896
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,480
My friend and I

897
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,560
used to steal her father's
booze and get drunk.

898
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,480
You are opening up slowly.

899
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,680
This means,
you are getting high.

900
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,520
Khushi, I didn't know
you were so bold.

901
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,720
You slapped him real hard.

902
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,400
Listen, my child..

903
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,520
What?

904
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,040
She's drunk.
I have to bear everything now.

905
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,280
Ms. Khushi, tell me.

906
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,280
You are a fool.

907
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,320
Lord Hanuman was powerful.

908
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,560
He didn't carry the mountain
every day to prove it.

909
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,520
No, right?

910
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,680
He carried the mountain
only to save Lakshman.

911
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,080
Everything has a specific time.

912
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,040
A modern girl
is talking about Ramayana.

913
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,960
Tequila, you are great!

914
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,240
Preetham..
- Yes?

915
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,640
I'm feeling very energetic.

916
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,640
Come, let's go thrash Vicky.

917
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,520
Oh, no! Khushi,
he is already in shock

918
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,800
as you slapped him on the face.
We'll go later.

919
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,680
No.. Come, Preetham,
let's go.

920
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,400
I have to slap him. Come!

921
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Oh, no! Please Khushi..
Shall we do this?

922
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,200
Consider me to be Vicky and
do whatever you feel like. Okay?

923
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,760
Oh, God!

924
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,960
Let me hide the bottle.

925
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,960
I'm very happy today.
Thank you so much!

926
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,680
Welcome.. - Preetham,
I feel like giving you a gift.

927
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,440
A gift?
- But what should I gift you..

928
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,720
Ring. This is my favourite ring.

929
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,280
No, thanks.
- Preetham, take this.

930
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,920
Preetham, can I have
one more glass, please?

931
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,840
Khushi, it got over.
The guy took it back.

932
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,840
When?
- When you slapped me.

933
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,920
I want more.

934
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,800
It got over.
Come, I'll drop you home.

935
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,160
No, I'm very happy today.

936
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,760
Let's do something.

937
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,920
Do what?

938
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,040
Dance!
- Dance?

939
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,240
The hotel is closed.
There's no music.

940
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,040
I have my mobile phone with me.

941
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,200
Come, let's dance..

942
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,600
"When you come closer to me,
my heart starts racing."

943
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,360
"Tell me.."

944
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,040
"Please tell me."

945
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,720
"You're now in my dreams
calling out to me.."

946
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,040
"earnestly.."

947
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,320
"Why a heart that does not
sway to your love tunes?"

948
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,840
"Tell me why."

949
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,720
"Tell me.
Please tell me."

950
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,240
Stop the music..

951
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,680
Why? What happened?
- Play another song..

952
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,800
Let's not play this song now.
- Please.. - Play some peppy music.

953
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,080
Pop music? Okay.
- Please..

954
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,720
"Diva.."

955
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,200
"Diva.."

956
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,600
"Don't you know..
I'm very sexy"

957
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,200
"Don't you know..
I'm very sexy"

958
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,440
"Groove with the beat
with your hands and feet."

959
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,440
"Follow the music
and move along with it."

960
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,400
"I'm the queen of the night."

961
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,960
"I am the fantasy
of all your dreams."

962
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,160
"You're the queen of the night."

963
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,440
"Sing a song tonight."

964
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,800
"Don't you know.." Why!
- "Don't you know.."

965
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,040
"Don't you know, I'm very sexy."
- Dance!

966
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,960
"Don't you know..
I'm very sexy" - Hey.. Wait!

967
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,480
Hello?
- Hi, baby. Good morning.

968
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,200
Good morning, boss.
- Didn't you leave?

969
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,440
I'll be there by evening.

970
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,440
Please come soon.
I'm missing you a lot.

971
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,080
Yes, boss.
- Bye. - Bye.

972
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,920
Hello?

973
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,800
Ms. Khushi..

974
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,720
Why is she sleeping here?

975
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,040
Ma'am..

976
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,240
Hello! Hi!
Good morning!

977
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,320
Oh, no!
- No.. - Mother!

978
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,560
No, nothing happened..

979
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,960
Don't worry..

980
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,760
Did I sleep in this room
all night?

981
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,960
You were sleeping beside me.
- No..

982
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,960
No, don't worry..
- Have you lost it?

983
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,920
I was sleeping with you
last night.

984
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,160
And you're telling me not to worry!

985
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,520
All is well..

986
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,280
Khushi, I used to do yoga
in my childhood.

987
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,160
I have great self-control.
Okay?

988
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,360
Nothing happened..
Okay?

989
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,760
I think so..

990
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,400
We met in Goa
and went to places.

991
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,480
Especially, we were drunk
and fell asleep here.

992
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,280
Forget about everything..

993
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,080
Let's go our ways.
Okay?

994
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,840
You shouldn't talk to me
even if you meet me somewhere.

995
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,920
I offered a ride back
to your house last night.

996
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,120
You didn't listen to me.

997
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,920
You said that you want
to dance and enjoy.

998
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,160
You danced to a song

999
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,560
and then slept next to me.
- Hey!

1000
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,680
You slept beside me and
now you are questioning me!

1001
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,520
Anyways, bye.
Goodbye!

1002
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,520
Shit!

1003
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,880
Hi, ma'am.
- Priya?

1004
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,720
Ma'am, how many times
did I tell you?

1005
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,080
Why don't you hire a maid?

1006
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,640
I like taking care of the chores.

1007
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,440
Moreover,
it's difficult to find a maid.

1008
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,720
Okay, where's Preetham?

1009
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,760
He hasn't even eaten anything
after he returned.

1010
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,240
Ma'am, he was your son till now,
but now, he is my baby.

1011
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,200
Go to his room.
- Okay.

1012
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,160
Baby..

1013
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,800
Baby..

1014
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,400
What happened?

1015
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,720
Baby, what happened?
- Boss, is it you?

1016
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,960
God!
- I had a nightmare.

1017
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,840
Don't be silly.

1018
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,680
Anyway, how was your trip?

1019
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,680
It was good.
- Okay.

1020
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,640
You haven't unpacked your luggage.
You don't have common sense.

1021
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,200
Put all this for wash.

1022
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,000
I thought I'll do it later.

1023
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,680
You don't think about cleanliness.

1024
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,840
Baby..

1025
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,960
What is this?
- A top.

1026
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,880
Whose?
- Yours.

1027
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,560
What?
- I bought this for you.

1028
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,080
A gift?

1029
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,160
This is a used top!

1030
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,320
Used?
- Yes!

1031
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,400
No.. Stupid!
The shopkeeper cheated me.

1032
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,600
Shops con us
by selling used clothes.

1033
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,640
Which shop? Where?
- On my way back from the temple

1034
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,400
I thought I should
buy something for you

1035
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,960
and went to the shop where
you regularly buy your clothes.

1036
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,840
He's sold me a used top!
Stupid!

1037
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,760
Bloody fools!
Give me the phone!

1038
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,400
Hello?
- Don't you have common sense?

1039
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,320
Who are you?
- Don't you feel ashamed?

1040
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,760
Why are you shouting at me?

1041
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,760
My boyfriend bought a top from your
shop and you sold him a used one.

1042
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,640
What? A used top from our shop?
- Yes.

1043
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,960
A used top? - One second.
Hello, not yours.

1044
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,520
Here.. Pal.
- Yes?

1045
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,760
I think a guy got caught

1046
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,080
trying to woo two girls by gifting
the same top. What do we do?

1047
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,480
Give her an excuse
and save yourself.

1048
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,640
Baby, I will teach him a lesson.
- Don't spare him.

1049
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,680
Guys must help other guys in
trouble. I'll manage. You can go.

1050
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,520
Ma'am.
- What?

1051
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,240
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

1052
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,120
I enquired from my staff members.

1053
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,960
Even they've received
the same kind of complaints.

1054
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,200
Our staff girls wanted
to entice rich boys

1055
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,760
so they've worn the clothes.

1056
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,040
Why don't you fire them?
Just kick them out!

1057
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,880
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

1058
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,720
I'm really sorry..
- It's okay.

1059
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,800
It's okay..
- The manager told me

1060
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,560
this is a top which was worn
by one of the sales girls.

1061
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,960
'I thought only soldiers help
strangers in distress.'

1062
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,760
'This manager has managed
the situation so well.'

1063
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,800
'I am obliged.
Thanks.'

1064
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,320
Do you know what I thought?

1065
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,480
Baby, I thought you lied to me
that you were going to the temple

1066
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,560
and spent time with a girl.

1067
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,520
Boss, if I was in your place

1068
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,240
I would've thought the same.

1069
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,240
Baby, your phone is ringing.

1070
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,800
Hello?
- Hello, it's me, Tony.

1071
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,320
Putte Gowda.
- Gowda?

1072
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,440
Tell me, Mr. Gowda.
- I'm not Gowda.

1073
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,320
I'm the horse of Goa..
- Mr. Gowda, tell me.

1074
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,160
I've come to Bangalore.

1075
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,800
I have arranged for a big party.
Please come.

1076
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,880
Have you come to Bangalore
to buy eggplants?

1077
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,880
Eggplant?
I'm talking about a party.

1078
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,360
Are you talking about aubergines?

1079
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,720
Aubergines?

1080
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,640
I'm talking about the party.

1081
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,280
Is it tonight?
- Now you are talking.

1082
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,120
Yes, it will be fun!

1083
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,640
Mr. Gowda, I'm with my girlfriend.
I'll call you later.

1084
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,400
Okay.

1085
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,400
Mr. Gowda, I told you about
my boss and his daughter, right?

1086
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,640
She's my fiancee.

1087
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,960
Now I know
why you are blabbering.

1088
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,080
Baby, who is it? - It is my uncle,
Putte Gowda.

1089
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,320
The government is felicitating him
for his eggplant harvest.

1090
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,200
Oh, that's nice.
Let me wish him.

1091
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,080
Hello. I hear you won an award
for the harvest.

1092
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,880
Congratulations!
- Thanks.

1093
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,160
I'll supply eggplants
for your wedding.

1094
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,040
Instead of giving coconuts
as return gifts to the guests

1095
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,240
we will give eggplants
to everyone. Okay?

1096
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,800
Baby, what nonsense is he talking?
Talk to him.

1097
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,160
Yes, Mr. Gowda!
- We'll party tonight.

1098
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,360
Party hard.
- Okay, Mr. Gowda. - Okay. - Bye.

1099
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,000
Baby, father has organised a party
at the farm house.

1100
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,600
He wants to introduce you
to everyone.

1101
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,240
Get ready and come.
- Okay.

1102
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,800
Hi, future Son-in-law!
- Hello, sir. - Welcome!

1103
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,960
Baby, wait for me.
- Sorry..

1104
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,200
Come.. Welcome
to my small farmhouse. - Oh..

1105
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,360
Sir, is this a small farmhouse?

1106
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,480
If you turn this into a stadium,
even Chris Gayle can't hit a six.

1107
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,280
You are always funny.

1108
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,320
This is my Dubai partner,
Rasagulla.

1109
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,120
I mean, Abdulla.
- Oh.. - Hi.

1110
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Nice to meet you.
- Abdulla, please.

1111
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,880
How was your trip?
- Good, sir.

1112
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,960
You've lost weight.

1113
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,760
Did you circumambulate
the temple many times?

1114
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,680
Not only that,
I performed all the prayers

1115
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,440
and did everything.

1116
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,240
One has to do all that.
Even I did everything

1117
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,720
to have a baby girl.

1118
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,320
I mean, I performed
the veneration.

1119
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,160
My close friend has been eagerly
waiting to meet you.

1120
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,200
Why is he so eager?
- Hey!

1121
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,840
This is why I like you.
Come! - Oh, God.

1122
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,360
We came from the village together.

1123
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,200
I settled here and
he settled somewhere else. - I see.

1124
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,040
Where are you, Mante..

1125
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,240
You bloody fool!

1126
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,920
Don't call me Mante.

1127
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,040
Call me Tony D'costa.
Understand?

1128
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,320
Okay.
- Okay.

1129
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,840
He is my future son-in-law.

1130
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,120
He's turned his back.
His back is beautiful.

1131
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,320
Show me your face. Come on.
- Come on.

1132
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,120
Come on.

1133
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,440
Sir, I don't let go
of any opportunity.

1134
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,560
I accepted the offer
as soon as he asked me.

1135
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,800
Hello, sir! - He respects elders
and takes their blessings.

1136
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,120
Come on, get up.
- Yes, he will.. Get up.

1137
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,160
Bloody fool. I thought you were
cheating someone else

1138
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,960
but you are cheating my friend.

1139
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,760
I will cancel your engagement.
I'm Tony D'costa!

1140
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,560
Sir.
- Yes?

1141
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,320
Can I embrace you, Mr. Mante?

1142
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,520
Yes, go ahead. Hug him..
He's very friendly..

1143
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Mr. Mante! Hey, Tony!

1144
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,200
I don't care if you call off
my engagement as I'm still young.

1145
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,520
Tony, think about yourself.
What did you tell me in Goa?

1146
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,400
I am like a thief.

1147
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,400
I open many locks with one key.

1148
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,960
Tipswamy!
- Mante Swamy!

1149
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,800
Siddalinga Swamy!
- Mante Swamy!

1150
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,280
You are so lucky.

1151
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,640
He is precious..

1152
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:26,240
"Come to Mante Swamy.."
- He's my close friend, Mante.

1153
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,040
Baby, come, I'll introduce
you to my grandma.

1154
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,280
Take him..

1155
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,800
My best friend is here.

1156
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,160
Oh, no, ma'am..

1157
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,400
Khushi?

1158
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,080
Grandma, Khushi,
he's my boyfriend.

1159
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,920
Priya, where's he?

1160
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,480
Where did he go?
- What?

1161
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Baby! One second,
I'll get him. - Okay.

1162
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Baby! Where did you go?

1163
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,240
What is she doing here?

1164
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,160
Oh, my God.
Mr. Tony! - Preethu..

1165
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,520
I compromised with you,
then why are you hounding me?

1166
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,760
Tony, I didn't come looking
for you.

1167
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,160
I will end it all. I'll call you
before I sleep next to my wife.

1168
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,480
Please don't reveal the truth
to my wife.

1169
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,320
Tony, that's not the point.
I..

1170
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,720
Goa is a humid city.

1171
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,680
Try to understand.
Should I fall to your feet?

1172
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,120
Tony, listen to me..
That's not the point.

1173
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,960
Please, Preetham.

1174
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,840
Baby!

1175
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,320
What's going on here..

1176
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,480
"This girl is.."
- Stop it!

1177
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,920
What are you doing?
What's going on?

1178
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,320
Sir was teaching me Goan style
dance for the evening party.

1179
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,160
Sir, stop it!
Don't you have any sense?

1180
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,800
I have to introduce him to others.
Please stop it.

1181
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,800
Come. Stop wasting time!

1182
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,320
Goan style! Shame!

1183
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,160
Baby!

1184
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,520
Don't talk to Mr. Tony.
What were you doing?

1185
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,480
It was so disgusting.
Yuck!

1186
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,560
Hi, Priya.
- Hi, Khushi.

1187
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,520
He is my baby, Preetham.

1188
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,280
Priya, what's wrong with you?

1189
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,200
Where is he?

1190
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,000
Well, he was here.
Where did he go?

1191
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,640
Oh God, what's wrong with you?

1192
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,200
Wait, you know what?
I'll just get him back. Okay?

1193
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,240
Okay.
- Baby!

1194
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,560
We were taught in school
to always tell the truth.

1195
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,040
I should've followed that.

1196
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,160
Baby!
- Yes, boss!

1197
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,680
What are you doing
in the bathroom?

1198
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,840
What else would one do
in a bathroom?

1199
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,480
Okay, come out in five minutes.
Everyone is waiting for you.

1200
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,760
Boss, I'm coming..

1201
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,520
God, You are great.
Please save me this one time.

1202
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,280
I will never lie again.

1203
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,880
Sir, call him.
We are getting late.

1204
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,400
Son-in-law!
- Sir?

1205
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,440
My daughter's friends are here
to meet you. Come out.

1206
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,040
Sir, I am naked. Shall I come out?
- You are so naughty!

1207
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,560
Wear your clothes and come out.

1208
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,160
What's the matter? I can hear
strange sounds from inside.

1209
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,480
Sir, my stomach is hurting.

1210
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,400
He's got slow motion.
- What?

1211
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,360
I mean, loose motion.

1212
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,200
Go, have dinner.
- What?

1213
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,200
I mean, go and eat food.
Son-in-law! - Sir? - He's crazy.

1214
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,280
Shall I call the doctor?
- Forget the doctor.

1215
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,120
There's no water here.
Please check.

1216
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,920
Shall I give you liquor?
- Sir, how can I wash up?

1217
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,520
Okay..
I will arrange for it.

1218
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,600
What do I do?

1219
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,880
Hi, guys.
- Hi. - Hi.

1220
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,560
Are you guys comfortable?
- Yes.

1221
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,360
Priya, where's your boyfriend?

1222
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,800
You said that you'll introduce
him to us. Where is he?

1223
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,080
He's got an upset stomach.
He isn't coming out of the toilet.

1224
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,680
I think he drank too much.

1225
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,920
No way. He doesn't drink or smoke,
you know?

1226
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,280
Oh!

1227
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,480
He has just returned
from a pilgrimage.

1228
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,680
Hence, it must be due
to food poisoning.

1229
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,600
Priya..

1230
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,080
It's very surprising that a guy
is so pious in this generations.

1231
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,000
You know what,
you'll be more surprised.

1232
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,440
I'll get him here
and introduce him to you.

1233
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,200
Sure, go. - You guys carry on.
Okay? - Okay.

1234
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,640
Order whatever you want.
- Yes, sure. - Thanks. - We will.

1235
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,800
He has come out!
- You! - Mom!

1236
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,120
Oh, no! Even the children
are scaring me.

1237
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,680
He has built such a big bathroom.
It wouldn't have hurt

1238
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,960
to build a small window.
I could have escaped from here.

1239
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,600
What should I do?

1240
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,960
Baby, that's a bathroom,
not a bedroom.

1241
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,560
You've been sitting inside,
since morning. Come out.

1242
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,320
Everyone left.

1243
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,920
Boss, did everyone leave?

1244
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,320
Yes, everyone left.

1245
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,640
Did everyone leave?

1246
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,960
Yes, everyone left. Come out!

1247
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,320
Yes! Oh!

1248
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,200
Boss, I couldn't meet anyone.
- Yes.

1249
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,200
Boss, my stomach is clear now.

1250
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,320
I'll come out in five minutes.

1251
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,160
Okay, come soon!
- Oh, God!

1252
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,320
God, I know
why You punished me.

1253
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,960
It's because I lied by
mentioning your name.

1254
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,360
Hereafter, I will never lie. Okay?

1255
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,920
At last! Finally!

1256
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,360
The party was ruined
because of you.

1257
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,080
Everyone left.
- Is it?

1258
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,840
Sorry, boss..

1259
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,320
Everything has cleared now,
I feel light like a feather..

1260
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,680
Baby, you just said you're alright.
Where are you going?

1261
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,080
Khushi, this is my boyfriend,
Preetham.

1262
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,880
Oh!

1263
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,120
So, are you Preetham?
- Greetings.

1264
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,040
Priya talks a lot about you.

1265
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,320
She told me that
you don't smoke or drink.

1266
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,720
She said that
you don't even look at girls.

1267
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,280
She said that you don't lie.

1268
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,120
It's not like that.
She just boasted about me.

1269
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,400
She lied to you.

1270
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,720
Come on, it's difficult to get
a guy like this these days.

1271
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,120
I'm so lucky, Khushi.

1272
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,080
Very lucky.
Right, Preetham?

1273
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,720
I think so.

1274
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,960
Okay, baby, you know what?

1275
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,200
We'll go drop Khushi
and I'll drop you after that. Okay?

1276
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,960
Come on, guys. Let's go.
- Drop..

1277
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,080
What should I do now?
I'm trapped. Oh, no..

1278
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,600
Baby!
- Coming.

1279
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,880
Do come here often, Khushi.
- Yes, sure. Why not?

1280
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,360
Mom, sorry, I forgot.
I'll come right away.

1281
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,760
Sorry, Mom.
- What's the matter?

1282
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,360
I had completely
forgotten about it.

1283
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,240
Aunt Rakshita had arranged a
veneration at home. My mom's there.

1284
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,560
I told her I would pick her up.
I forgot about it completely.

1285
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,840
Let's all go and pick her up.
- Oh, no!

1286
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,880
We can't go. Many women
of our colony are with my mother.

1287
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,840
We can't pick them
all up in our car.

1288
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,400
No way!
I can't come along.

1289
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,480
Take the other car
and carry on, okay?

1290
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,240
You won't mind, right?
- Not at all.

1291
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,800
I'll drop her, carry on.
Okay? - Okay.

1292
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,040
Bye.
- Bye. - Come.

1293
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,840
Boss, don't feel offended.
- Don't bother. It's okay.

1294
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,080
'Prince Bar and Restaurant'

1295
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,200
Pal, the bar is closed.

1296
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,240
This isn't fair. You can't close up
so soon. Please open.

1297
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,920
Are you heartbroken?

1298
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,840
Yes, I'm heartbroken.

1299
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,880
Come inside.
- Thank you, boss.

1300
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,360
They are my friends.
Don't worry.

1301
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,240
Here.
- Enough.

1302
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,920
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1303
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,000
You are so well dressed.
Why did you come to a local bar?

1304
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,600
This is where I belong.
I'm only wearing expensive clothes.

1305
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,800
Well said.

1306
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,240
Pal, do you want to hear
about Shah Jahan's sad story?

1307
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,240
Ask him..

1308
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,560
What is it? Tell us.
- Tell us about your sad story.

1309
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,000
I tried to escape from there

1310
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,880
but I got caught in the end.

1311
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,760
I'm very tense.

1312
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,880
I'm worried that she may
reveal the truth to her.

1313
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,200
Why are you crying?

1314
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:48,480
Boss, we love girls so much.

1315
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,240
Sometimes, we even lie to them
to make them happy.

1316
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:57,920
One lie for our happiness leads
to terrible consequences.

1317
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,720
That was a touchy dialogue.
- Boss?

1318
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,920
That was a touchy..

1319
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,680
Play a song.
- "One shouldn't fall in love.."

1320
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,680
Come on, start.

1321
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,920
"You're a passenger
from a strange land." - Wow!

1322
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,200
"You're a passenger
from a strange land."

1323
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,240
Not this.
- Why?

1324
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,520
What? - This is not the song
I want to hear now.

1325
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,440
Which song do you wish to hear?

1326
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,520
"That's right!"

1327
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,440
"Check the beat now."

1328
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,360
"First it's 30
then it's 60"

1329
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:54,080
"later it's 90
and then we roll-over."

1330
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,280
"I am a player,
but my girlfriend's nice."

1331
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,800
"Have a betel leaf
as I'm a cheat."

1332
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:08,240
"We jump over the wall
even if the gate's opened."

1333
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,280
"We ring the doorbell
even if the door's opened."

1334
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,240
"We light the candle
even if there's electricity."

1335
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,960
"We sleep well
even if our girlfriend's angry"

1336
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,920
"because we would
have had a drink."

1337
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:30,320
"First it's 30, then it's 60"

1338
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,920
"later it's 90 and then
we roll-over."

1339
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,800
"You then just roll-over.."

1340
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:04,280
"Who hasn't heard about
your tales of lying?"

1341
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:10,840
"Even enemies are
scared of your lies."

1342
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,680
"The reason for all this
are your lies."

1343
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,120
"We shouldn't become
weak by speaking the truth."

1344
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,600
"We shouldn't get caught
when we lie."

1345
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,240
"How's it possible to
fall in love without lies?"

1346
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,640
"Falsehood is my God!"

1347
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,880
"If you mix two brands
of liquor"

1348
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,960
"you're sure to be
found in a ditch at night."

1349
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:40,280
"If you lie to a woman"

1350
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,880
"you will be tormented."

1351
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,480
"My life's ruined."

1352
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,960
"First it's 30. - 30!
Then it's 60. 60!"

1353
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,240
"Later it's 90 then we roll-over."

1354
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,400
"You then just roll-over.."

1355
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,480
"Give us a pose.
That's right!"

1356
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,920
"That's right"

1357
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,360
"Booze it up."

1358
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,520
"Why should there be
a reason to drink?"

1359
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,680
"If we're happy then drink
a little, if we're sad then a lot."

1360
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,400
"It's fashionable
for women to drink."

1361
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,440
"But if we drink,
then it's called poison."

1362
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,680
"Let me tell you something,
my friend.."

1363
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:54,280
"However drunk you are,
just go home."

1364
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,400
Giri.
- Why are you late?

1365
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,680
How is boss' mood?
- She's furious.

1366
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,480
I'm doomed..

1367
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,960
What?
- I lost my job.

1368
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,480
Oh!
- She'll call off the wedding.

1369
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,520
Oh! - You should work without me.
- Oh, no!

1370
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,640
Be careful.

1371
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,360
Who suggested
that I should go to Goa?

1372
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,920
I was the one who told you.

1373
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,840
You are an idiot.

1374
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,560
Boss!

1375
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,760
Preetham, how dare you?
How could you do this?

1376
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,840
Actually.. - Don't you have
common sense?

1377
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,400
Actually.. - Look! I don't
want an explanation.

1378
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,840
What you did was wrong!

1379
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,160
No, boss, actually..

1380
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,720
Do you even care for me?

1381
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,920
Why, boss?
- Why?

1382
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,960
You had a stomach ache,
so I called you many times

1383
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,800
to ask about your health.
Why did you switch off your phone?

1384
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,120
Boss!

1385
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,240
Are you angry with me
because my phone was switched off?

1386
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,240
Why are you laughing like this?

1387
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,200
Boss, I took some herbal medicine
and went to bed.

1388
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,800
I switched off my phone
so that I'm not disturbed.

1389
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,680
You should've told me.

1390
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,760
Boss, forget about that.

1391
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,680
Last night, did you
drop your friend Khushi

1392
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,360
safely to her house?
- Yes, why?

1393
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,320
Did she say anything about me?

1394
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,320
Do you know what she said?
She said, you are a good guy.

1395
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:47,040
Did she really say that?
Boss, don't lie to me.

1396
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,440
Not only that, she said that
we are made for each other.

1397
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,840
She was all praises for you.

1398
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,120
Is it?
- Yes.

1399
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,240
So nice of her.

1400
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,720
I couldn't talk to her properly.

1401
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,600
I thought she would
be upset with me.

1402
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Excuse me, ma'am.

1403
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,520
Yes? - Some guests are waiting
for you.

1404
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,280
Yes, I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay, ma'am. - Okay, Preetham.

1405
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,360
I'll just get back. Okay?
- Okay, boss..

1406
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,040
Thank God..
I'm saved...

1407
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,960
I have to thank Khushi.
Thank you, Khushi..

1408
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,680
Khushi..

1409
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,440
Ma'am.. - Don't give me these.
You've still kept the old stock.

1410
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,440
Go and get the new stock.
- Hi!

1411
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,680
Go!
- Okay, ma'am.

1412
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,280
I will do it.

1413
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,560
Hi.

1414
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,440
Hi, Khushi.
- Who are you?

1415
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,400
Don't you recognise me?

1416
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,960
People guess that it may rain
just by glancing at the clouds.

1417
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,160
People can guess the time
by looking at the sun.

1418
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,040
But no one can predict
about girls.

1419
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,560
Girls are very unpredictable.

1420
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,720
Well said, sir!

1421
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,200
You said the right thing. From now,
you're my boss. - Leave me.

1422
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,960
Are you heartbroken? Why are you
getting emotional? - Boss?

1423
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,520
Khushi..

1424
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,160
Hello, Khushi!

1425
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,960
You spoke to me so much in Goa,
why aren't you talking to me now?

1426
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,920
Excuse me.
It was you who told me

1427
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,800
not to talk to you
even if we meet again.

1428
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,040
You told me to forget about
everything that happened in Goa.

1429
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,400
I don't remember what I said,
why are you taking it so seriously?

1430
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,920
How did you know I was here?

1431
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,280
A phone number is enough
to learn details about anyone.

1432
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,000
Anyway, if you want to talk
to the world, you can use a mike.

1433
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,480
It is said, if you want to say
something to many at once

1434
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,960
you should tell a girl and then
advise her not to tell anyone.

1435
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,280
Thanks for keeping my secret
and not revealing it to her.

1436
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,400
Thank you very much.

1437
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,320
My truth won't set
the two of you apart

1438
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,120
because you've managed
to come closer to her by lying.

1439
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,240
What's the use of telling her?

1440
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:11,040
If you had told her the truth,
she would've barbecued me.

1441
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,960
Girls believe in stories
more than reality.

1442
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,040
I wouldn't have forgotten
my pain all my life.

1443
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,960
But you helped me forget it
during the time we spent in Goa.

1444
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,560
I'm sure
you will keep her happy.

1445
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,360
That's why,
I didn't tell her the truth.

1446
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,920
You are the only one who
has understood me, after my mother.

1447
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,880
Preetham, I have a request.

1448
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,160
No one can lead a life
by lying.

1449
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,080
Correct. I know.

1450
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,480
But I have a request too.

1451
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,760
What is it?

1452
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,800
In the next birth, you should be
born as a millionaire's daughter.

1453
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,360
I will look for you,
fight for you

1454
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,960
and get you. Promise.

1455
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,800
I won't lie.

1456
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,840
I swear.
I swear by you.

1457
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,080
Why are you swearing by me?
- I give you my word. Okay?

1458
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,280
Anyway, thank you very much..
Once again, thank you very much.

1459
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,080
Are you slicing mutton..
- Hi, baby!

1460
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,800
Hello, boss.
- I have some good news.

1461
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,600
Our engagement date is fixed.

1462
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,280
Boss! Superb!

1463
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,400
I'll kill you. She's talking about
our engagement. - Superb, boss!

1464
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,440
Thank you, boss..

1465
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,480
You should thank the mother
if the child is beautiful.

1466
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,280
You shouldn't thank the midwife.

1467
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,840
Sir, I don't get you.

1468
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,880
I fixed the engagement date
and you are thanking her.

1469
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,920
Sir, I am so happy that I feel
like hugging and kissing you.

1470
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,760
But I am controlling myself
because she is standing here.

1471
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,880
You don't feel shy to romance her
in front of me

1472
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,720
but you are shy
to romance me in front of her.

1473
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,480
Come on, kick me.
- Sir, what do you mean?

1474
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,520
I mean, kiss me. Come on.
- Dad!

1475
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,960
The engagement date is approaching
and we have lots of shopping to do.

1476
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,360
Yes. - Dad, I'm taking him.
Come on, baby. - Okay, enjoy!

1477
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,760
Boss, superb! I'll go with them.
- Stop!

1478
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,440
No, do your work.

1479
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,840
Sir, can I help you?

1480
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,600
I need a coat for my engagement.
Show me the black one.

1481
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,040
Sir, here's the black colour coat.

1482
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,920
Try this. This is a fast moving
item in our showroom. - I see.

1483
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,960
Yes, sir.
It fits you well.

1484
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,600
Sir, you look like a hero
wearing this.

1485
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:39,560
I have to look good
at the engagement.

1486
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,040
Okay, I'll call you back!

1487
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,960
You've got good taste. - Thank you.
- It fits me, right? - Yes, sir.

1488
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,920
Wow! Baby!

1489
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,240
Who selected this coat for you?
- Ma'am, I selected it.

1490
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,960
Idiot, what nonsense!
Are you out of your mind?

1491
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,840
Who appointed you?
Let's go, baby.

1492
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,960
Take it off. I'll select
one for you. - Okay, boss..

1493
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,560
Pal.
- Sir?

1494
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,320
Please don't feel bad.
- Sir, we are used to this.

1495
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,920
My wife scolds me daily.

1496
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,720
You'll experience it once you
get married. It's okay, sir.

1497
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,280
Boss?
- Baby, how's this dress?

1498
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,400
Awesome, right?
- Awesome! Superb!

1499
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,800
I selected this coat for you.

1500
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:23,600
The idiotic salesman was showing
you a black colour coat.

1501
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,800
Black is my favourite colour..
- But this is my favourite colour.

1502
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,360
Go and wear it! Okay?
- Yes.

1503
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,400
I will try this.
- Yes.

1504
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,760
Hereafter,
grey is my favourite colour.

1505
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,320
Baby!
- Yes?

1506
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,280
Today is Khushi's birthday.
I forgot to wish her.

1507
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,480
Try calling her from my phone.
Let's wish her.

1508
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,360
Did you try calling her?
- I'm trying.

1509
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,520
'The number you're calling
is switched off'. - What happened?

1510
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,240
'Please try after sometime.'

1511
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,080
It is switched off.
- Okay.

1512
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,840
She is always like this.
She is very moody.

1513
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,360
Does anyone switch off their phone
on their birthday?

1514
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,880
How do we wish her?

1515
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,600
Baby, how is this dress?

1516
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,040
Superb. - We look good together,
don't we? - Yes.

1517
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,760
This is a little tight for me.
Shall we take a bigger size?

1518
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,120
No, this size looks good.
You should buy this. Okay?

1519
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,480
Okay. - Fine.
Come on, we'll pay.

1520
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,160
Sir, it is not good.

1521
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,680
I know.
- Okay, sir.

1522
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,080
Hi, Khushi.

1523
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,440
Happy birthday.

1524
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,880
I found your address though
you had switched off your mobile.

1525
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:18,040
Who's at home?
Is your sister at home?

1526
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,440
Ma'am..

1527
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,920
Hi.
- Hi.

1528
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,440
How are you?
- I'm good.

1529
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,160
How are you?
- Superb.

1530
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,240
I came to wish her.

1531
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,360
Khushi, is he your friend?

1532
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,400
No! Friends ask for a party
if they come home.

1533
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,440
But if a guy comes looking
and gives the girl a bouquet

1534
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,440
I'm sure he's her boyfriend.

1535
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,160
He's given red roses to her.

1536
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,880
Correct, Grandma.
He's Vicky.

1537
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,520
Grandpa, do you remember Vikram?
He is Vicky.

1538
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,400
Oh, is he Vicky?
- Yes.

1539
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,880
Smart fellow.

1540
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:03,680
When I see them, I remember
the days of our courtship.

1541
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,400
Vicky, come with me.

1542
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,360
You haven't seen
our house, right?

1543
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,680
Are you happy?

1544
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,160
Before our marriage,
whenever you used to look at me

1545
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,680
you used to feel shy like this.
- Stop it.

1546
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,120
Grandpa!
- There are so many children?

1547
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,560
Doesn't anyone follow
family planning in this house?

1548
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,880
They are children
from our neighbourhood.

1549
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,680
Grandpa likes children.

1550
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,200
I thought they were
your grandpa's children. - Oh, no!

1551
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,800
Sorry, Preetham,
I introduced you as Vikram.

1552
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,400
My grandparents don't know
about Khushi's breakup.

1553
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,880
They will feel bad
if they learn about it.

1554
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,160
I will tell them when
the time is right.

1555
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,880
They haven't seen Vicky.

1556
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,240
If you don't mind

1557
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,160
will you please act like Vicky?

1558
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,280
It's okay, ma'am.

1559
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:00,480
Till date, I thought my happiness
means everything.

1560
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,160
Now, I have an opportunity
to make others happy.

1561
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,480
I'll act, don't worry.
- Thank you, Preetham.

1562
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,240
The food is very tasty!

1563
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:15,880
Both the sisters always
fought with each other

1564
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,000
and so they haven't learnt to cook
till date.

1565
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,320
My darling always cooks food.
- Should I serve you?

1566
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,440
No, thanks.
I am full.

1567
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:31,120
You should eat well
at this age.

1568
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,120
I won't listen.
You should eat.

1569
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,920
I'll serve more.
- Enough. I don't want more..

1570
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,200
Grandma, why are you forcing him?

1571
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,560
Oh, you are so concerned
about him.

1572
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,840
Be careful.

1573
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,280
What are you looking at?
Serve me some food.

1574
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,760
You need to watch
your cholesterol level at this age.

1575
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,760
You must take care of your health.
Don't eat too much. Get it?

1576
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,040
Why should I watch my health
at this age?

1577
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,800
Does she expect me to become
the hero of an action film?

1578
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,480
I want to eat in order
to impress you. Please serve me.

1579
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,440
I will serve just a little.

1580
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,360
Excuse me.

1581
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,640
Your grandma is such a good cook.

1582
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,840
Long throw!

1583
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,400
Try taking the ball from him.

1584
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,880
Goal!

1585
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,600
You've chosen a nice guy.

1586
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:48,280
pass it here. - It's not enough
for him to become your husband

1587
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,880
he should become one of us.

1588
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,760
I can see that quality in him.

1589
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:54,920
Sagar!

1590
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,840
Come on! Get up..

1591
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,760
Grandpa, one can fall in love
after marriage.

1592
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,960
But there is no surety that lovers
will end up marrying each other.

1593
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,600
Both of you are very lucky
in that case.

1594
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,920
In our generation,
love happens very fast.

1595
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,200
Love happened very slowly
in your generation, right?

1596
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,320
Did you hear what he said?

1597
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:29,360
Our lips would get sore
twice in a week.

1598
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,200
You'll lose your mind if I tell
you how I proposed to her.

1599
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,080
How did you propose, Grandpa?

1600
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,080
I booked an aircraft

1601
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,360
and took her into the sky.

1602
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:47,200
I proposed to her
amidst the clouds.

1603
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,240
It was so thrilling,
she accepted my proposal.

1604
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,760
Wow! Ma'am, is it true?

1605
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,560
I didn't accept
because it was thrilling.

1606
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,200
I thought he would throw me out,
if I refused.

1607
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,400
I will throw you out now.
- Leave me!

1608
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,600
If we didn't have
to follow the customs

1609
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,600
I would've consummated
our marriage

1610
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,600
amidst the clouds.

1611
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:18,160
But that was not possible.
- Why, sir?

1612
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:22,360
Tell us how you proposed to Khushi.

1613
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,120
I..

1614
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,240
How did you know
that I proposed to her first?

1615
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,480
I'm experienced, dear.

1616
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,160
Girls may be ahead in queue,
but when it comes to proposing

1617
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,800
boys are still ahead.

1618
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,120
Sir, I..

1619
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:47,720
I didn't take her amidst the
clouds. It's a very simple story.

1620
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,280
We met each other. I proposed
while talking and she accepted.

1621
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,960
Very good.

1622
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,760
Come on, show it.
Khushi!

1623
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,240
Just a second..
Stay there..

1624
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,400
Go ahead.
- Sir..

1625
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:07,840
Grandpa, is it necessary?
- Really?

1626
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:12,160
Keep quiet. He teased us
saying our generation was slow.

1627
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,440
You are slower than us.

1628
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,040
I've forgotten how I proposed.

1629
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,240
I haven't forgotten it
though I'm 75 years old.

1630
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,960
You are only 25 years old,
how can you forget?

1631
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,200
Don't act foolish.

1632
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,320
Come on, get up. Go!

1633
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,960
Go on.
- Okay.

1634
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,240
Watch the fun.

1635
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,520
Grandpa, what are you doing?

1636
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,440
Listen..
- Grandpa, keep quiet.

1637
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,400
Go on.

1638
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,720
Before I met you

1639
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,680
my heart was black and white.

1640
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,120
After I met you,
my heart has become colourful.

1641
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,240
Khushi, when I saw you
for the first time

1642
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,040
my heart skipped a beat.

1643
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,800
What?
- Nothing.

1644
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,280
When you turned and looked at me,
it started beating again.

1645
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,880
Khushi, when you look at me

1646
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:30,240
I forget myself.

1647
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,800
I might die
if you smile like that.

1648
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,720
Khushi

1649
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:48,960
more than the pain
that I can't have you

1650
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,040
I'm sad that

1651
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,560
I am unable to forget you.

1652
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,240
Khushi

1653
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,640
many guys would've gone crazy

1654
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,360
seeing the dimple on your cheeks.

1655
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:15,360
But only one guy won

1656
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,680
and that is me.

1657
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,800
Open the door to your heart

1658
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,400
and allow me inside.

1659
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,720
I will keep you happy

1660
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,280
forever, throughout my life.

1661
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,600
I love you, Khushi.

1662
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,040
I really love you.

1663
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:05,280
I love you too, Preetham.

1664
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,920
Very good.

1665
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,640
Well done. Superb!

1666
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,800
Khushi, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

1667
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,040
Fantastic!
- Sir!

1668
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,880
I must say

1669
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,560
you proposed to her
better than I did.

1670
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,160
I just said it.

1671
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,760
Should I propose to her
once again?

1672
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,280
Please go ahead..

1673
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,760
Khushi.

1674
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,360
I'm sorry.

1675
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,680
I'm sorry
I proposed to you before them.

1676
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:03,320
Your grandpa challenged me.

1677
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,960
I proposed to you
to make it look natural.

1678
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,080
I'm sorry.
I hope you didn't get offended.

1679
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,280
Actually, I thought
I would apologise to you.

1680
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,200
I acted like you did.

1681
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,840
Today

1682
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:29,240
I'm feeling very happy to have
spent time with your family.

1683
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,560
Can I tell you something?

1684
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,800
They were happy
because of you.

1685
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,560
Didn't you feel happy?

1686
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,960
Did I say that?
Why do you assume things?

1687
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:49,040
Then, now, or in the future

1688
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,280
I will never misunderstand you.

1689
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,840
You are not what
you project to be.

1690
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,480
Thank God.

1691
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,760
I thought you must have
misunderstood me.

1692
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,120
Thank you very much.

1693
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,800
Khushi, I feel like doing
something.

1694
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,800
What?

1695
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:19,000
I want to look up
in the sky and talk

1696
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,720
just the way you do,
when you're happy.

1697
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
I don't know
what happened today

1698
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:39,480
but I miss my dad very much.

1699
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,240
Fifteen years ago

1700
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,760
my father was a businessman.

1701
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,680
He got along with his friends

1702
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:54,040
and started a business
by taking a loan.

1703
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,240
His friends used to address
my father as 'Brother'

1704
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,200
and my mother
as 'Sister-in-law'.

1705
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,160
One day

1706
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,240
my father died in an accident.

1707
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,480
All those partners
who were close to him

1708
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,240
ran away without repaying the loan.

1709
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,440
My mother repaid the loan
with great difficulty.

1710
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:23,000
Only then I realised

1711
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:27,960
that relationships are meaningless
when compared to money.

1712
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,920
That day, I decided

1713
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:36,400
to earn money.

1714
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,560
I started running after money
and I haven't stopped since.

1715
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:43,160
Khushi, I don't know why

1716
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,040
now I feel like stopping.

1717
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,400
If not

1718
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,800
I feel I will lose something.

1719
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,640
I'm scared.

1720
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,720
Sorry.

1721
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,040
I'm narrating my sad story
on your birthday.

1722
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,240
I'm sorry.

1723
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:41,200
Now I realise that there's
so much pain behind your smile.

1724
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,040
It is raining. Get up!

1725
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,240
Come..
- Preetham!

1726
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,760
What is it?

1727
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,920
Shall we get drenched
in the rain?

1728
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,600
I think you've cast
a magic spell on me.

1729
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,040
I feel like listening
to everything you say.

1730
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:44,960
"Wait.. Please wait
for just a moment."

1731
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,040
"I have lost my heart
to you."

1732
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,640
"No..
I don't have any other task"

1733
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,760
"apart from loving you."

1734
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:05,560
"I want a companion
who is just like you."

1735
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,880
"With the moon as a witness,
I want you in my arms."

1736
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:16,680
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful."

1737
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:22,040
"With the moon as a witness,
I want you in my arms."

1738
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:28,120
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful."

1739
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:43,720
"There's a light that shines
from your heart."

1740
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,840
"My fingers are a prisoner
in your hair."

1741
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:54,240
"Why wait any longer when my heart
beats for you?"

1742
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:59,600
"My heart's overflowing with
love and happiness."

1743
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,720
"You can't go anywhere
out of my sight."

1744
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:09,960
"In the world of my dreams,
you are the queen."

1745
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:15,960
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful."

1746
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:21,000
"In the world of my dreams,
you are the queen."

1747
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:26,360
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful."

1748
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:47,000
"My heart's filled with dreams
of you day and night."

1749
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,960
"You are the reason
my dreams are beautiful."

1750
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,840
"My heart speaks even
before I can speak."

1751
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:03,080
"My fears are now unfounded
with you by my side."

1752
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,200
"All my confusion was there
until I found you."

1753
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:14,040
"I'm done speaking
with my eyes."

1754
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:19,560
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful."

1755
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:24,800
"I'm done speaking
with my eyes."

1756
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:29,720
"If you accept my love,
I will forever be grateful to you."

1757
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:48,040
'The subscriber you are calling
is switched off.'

1758
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,200
Boss, did you call me?
- Where is Preetham?

1759
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:54,640
Boss, how will I know
when you don't know about him?

1760
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,600
Why has he switched off his phone?

1761
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,560
His battery must be dead.

1762
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:59,760
What?
- Yes.

1763
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,920
One has to charge the phone

1764
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,480
and the charger
is in the kitchen.

1765
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,720
Tell him to call me as soon as
he switches on his phone. Okay?

1766
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,080
Okay, boss.

1767
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,720
Get lost!

1768
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,800
Ma'am, I heard
you wanted a pain reliever balm.

1769
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,840
Is it for sir?
- No, it's for me.

1770
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,040
My legs are paining.
Give that to me.

1771
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,160
I will apply it for you.
Where does it pain?

1772
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:26,120
Here.
- I will apply it.

1773
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,760
Ma'am, I've never seen

1774
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,080
a happy family like yours.

1775
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,160
I'm happy to be with you.

1776
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,880
Is it? When Khushi was young

1777
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,360
besides me, no one
could pacify her.

1778
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,720
After her parents' death

1779
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:52,320
she cried inconsolably.
Even I couldn't console her.

1780
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:56,000
You brought a smile
to her face.

1781
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,200
You are really great.

1782
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,640
I don't know
how long we will live

1783
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:06,000
but you should take care of her
after we are gone.

1784
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,640
Will you take care of her?

1785
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:12,960
I will.

1786
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:16,920
Thanks.

1787
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,640
Vicky.
- Yes. - Thanks for coming.

1788
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,240
Only the three
of us would feel bored.

1789
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:29,320
Okay, son. Good luck.
God bless you.

1790
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,920
Bye, Vicky.

1791
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,320
The way you are
bidding farewell to me

1792
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:35,920
it looks like you don't want
me to come here again.

1793
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,120
Vicky, you are a family member now.

1794
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,400
Visit us often.
- I will surely come.

1795
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,640
That's good.
- I will be happy if you do.

1796
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,320
Why are we standing here?

1797
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,440
Maybe they want to talk
to each other. Go ahead.

1798
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,360
Let's go..
- Come on.

1799
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:57,080
Preetham, thank you.

1800
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,360
It's okay.

1801
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,640
I can't tell you
to visit home often

1802
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,800
like grandma and grandpa did.

1803
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,120
You can't come even if I do.

1804
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,680
Anyway

1805
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,960
happy married life, Preetham.

1806
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,960
Thank you.

1807
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,280
Bye, Khushi.

1808
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:27,680
Preethu, how are you?

1809
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,120
Are you all right?

1810
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:32,520
Mom, why do you look worried?
What's the matter?

1811
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,080
Priya shouted at me saying

1812
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:38,720
that you switched off your phone
on your engagement day.

1813
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,280
Just call her first.

1814
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,040
Did Priya shout at you?

1815
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:44,040
Go and get ready.
- Mom..

1816
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,160
Get ready. They must be waiting.
- Did she shout at you?

1817
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,640
Go and get ready.
- Mom!

1818
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,760
Why do you look sullen?

1819
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,360
Nothing, Mom.
I'm all right.

1820
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,320
Mom.

1821
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,320
I think they are rich.
We can loot them.

1822
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:34,800
Are you blind?
- Sorry, sir.

1823
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,920
Sir, I didn't do it intentionally.
I will pay you for it. - What?

1824
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:40,400
Did you do it unintentionally?
- I'm telling you.

1825
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,200
Preethu!
- Mom!

1826
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,240
"When things go wrong,
he'll set it right."

1827
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,320
"He'll take in hand
to show the light."

1828
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,120
"Stop right there
and turn it up!" - Hey!

1829
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:08,400
Come on, give me the money.
Don't act smart with us.

1830
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:14,760
Preethu..
- Mother, are you all right?

1831
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,560
I'm fine, Son.

1832
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:19,680
Preethu, why did you fight
with them?

1833
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:23,600
Mom, I can't bear
to see you in pain.

1834
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,520
Let's go, Mom.

1835
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:28,960
Come.

1836
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:35,640
Boss, what's the matter?
What happened to you?

1837
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,680
Nothing, Giri.
- Boss.

1838
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,280
They're waiting for you.
Please come.

1839
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,760
He will be here, don't worry.
- Preetham and his mother are here.

1840
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:43,920
He is here.

1841
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,040
Come..

1842
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,480
Welcome..

1843
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:56,040
Preetham, what happened?

1844
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,080
Sir..
- Dad! - Wait!

1845
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,440
Preetham, where were you?

1846
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,160
Don't you remember
that it's our engagement today?

1847
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,440
You switched off your phone
even today.

1848
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,040
Is this the way to dress up?

1849
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,240
The waiters look better than you.

1850
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,080
Shame on you, Preetham.
- Dear, cool down..

1851
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,680
Please..
- Dad, stay out of this!

1852
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,880
Preetham, it is pointless
to tell you.

1853
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:24,400
I have to tell your mother!
Bloody middle class mentality.

1854
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,320
Hey!

1855
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,600
Keep quiet.

1856
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,880
If you say anything about
my mother, I won't spare you.

1857
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,680
Actually..
- Sir.

1858
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,800
I don't wish to go ahead
with this engagement.

1859
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,280
Sir, your daughter doesn't want
a guy to marry

1860
01:57:56,520 --> 01:58:01,160
she just wants an employee
who listens to her. - Listen..

1861
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,560
Sir.

1862
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:08,040
I made a mistake lying
to you that I love your daughter.

1863
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,480
If I marry her
without telling you the truth

1864
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:13,760
it would be cheating.

1865
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,680
Sir, I always
looked at life differently.

1866
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,240
I lied to you that I'm going
on a pilgrimage

1867
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,840
and went to Goa instead.

1868
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,560
I met Khushi there.

1869
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,240
Khushi is your daughter's friend.

1870
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,960
I thought money is the only
important thing in life.

1871
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:46,400
She made me realise
that love is superior.

1872
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:51,800
Sir, she could've told the truth
and cancelled the engagement.

1873
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,440
But she didn't do that.

1874
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,320
She wants everyone to be happy.

1875
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:04,400
Sir

1876
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:11,320
I don't know
if she loves me or not

1877
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,080
but

1878
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:18,720
I love Khushi.

1879
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,000
Sir.

1880
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,960
I'm telling you all this now.

1881
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,880
I'm very sorry, sir.

1882
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:35,720
I felt like telling you.

1883
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:42,440
Life is about making others happy.

1884
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,600
Sir, it is not about throwing
your weight around.

1885
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:53,640
Please forgive me, sir.

1886
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,280
What the hell! What are
you talking? - Priya!

1887
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,520
Shut up!

1888
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:09,080
Do whatever makes you happy.

1889
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,280
Dad?
- Thank you, sir.

1890
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,320
Good luck.

1891
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,560
Boss.

1892
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,760
Mom, I..

1893
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:25,160
One needs courage
to tell someone that you like them.

1894
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,720
But according to me

1895
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,600
one needs to be more courageous

1896
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:33,360
to refuse someone.

1897
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,960
Many people have ruined their lives
as they didn't have the courage.

1898
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:44,680
I'm very happy
with your decision.

1899
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:49,960
Do whatever makes you happy.

1900
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:54,680
Mom!

1901
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:02,920
Thank you, Mom..

1902
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:05,800
Boss.

1903
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:43,840
Khushi, we shall leave.
- Okay.

1904
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,040
Okay, I will see you, bye.
- Sure.

1905
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:49,360
Convey my regards
to your sister.

1906
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,880
Sure. Okay.

1907
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:52,440
We shall leave.
- Okay, ma'am.

1908
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,320
God bless you.

1909
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:59,760
Mom, we have to invite many others.
We can't miss anyone.. - Hi.

1910
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,040
Mr. Vicky?

1911
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,120
You were with Khushi
in the pub, right?

1912
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,640
Yes, it was me.

1913
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:09,360
Thanks a lot, boss.

1914
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,800
I realised my mistake
after what happened at the pub.

1915
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,680
I apologised to her
and she forgave me.

1916
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,360
I'm getting married.

1917
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:26,680
Everything is sorted
and I'm getting married.

1918
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:29,440
Khushi has forgiven me
and she is happy.

1919
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:32,280
We will be happy if you come.

1920
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:34,400
Sure.

1921
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:39,720
Will you give this ring
to Khushi?

1922
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,360
Boss,
why are you giving a gift already?

1923
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:45,480
She left it with me in Goa
by mistake.

1924
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,960
You can give it
to her yourself.

1925
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,880
No, it's better
if you give it to her.

1926
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:54,440
Oh! - You are getting married.
I'll call her later.

1927
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,920
Okay.
Boss, before I forget

1928
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,160
I'll take your address from Khushi
and come to invite you.

1929
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,880
Okay. - Thank you.
- Thank you..

1930
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:25,320
Mante!
- Yes?

1931
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,280
Shall I start walk straight ahead?

1932
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:33,920
No, don't take such a decision.

1933
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:37,960
I made some arrangements.
Everything will be all right.

1934
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:44,280
Mante, you talk about partying
even after listening to my story.

1935
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,400
It is foolishness to call
romance weakness.

1936
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:50,840
It's foolish to think

1937
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:54,200
that a romantic guy thinks
only dirty all the time.

1938
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,040
Look there!

1939
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:02,440
Mante, why did you
call her here?

1940
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:07,280
I called her here
because you said you were upset.

1941
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:12,560
Mante, I'm not upset
because of this girl.

1942
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,520
It's because of some other girl.

1943
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:19,240
She took a flight to come here.
Compromise with her.

1944
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:21,720
Mante, I will thrash you!
- Preetham!

1945
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:23,560
She's calling you..

1946
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:30,400
Go..

1947
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:33,560
Mante, things that you do..

1948
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:44,880
Boss, I already apologised to you.

1949
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,840
Why did you come here?

1950
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,240
Preetham, I have a surprise
for you. Look there.

1951
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,320
Khushi.

1952
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:24,600
Khushi, why did you come here?

1953
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,520
I don't understand.

1954
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,080
Preetham, I didn't give this ring
to you to give it to someone else.

1955
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,600
Khushi, I didn't give it
to a stranger.

1956
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,640
I gave to your fiance, Vicky.

1957
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,840
Fiance? It's not my problem
if you assume things.

1958
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,360
Vicky had come to apologise to me
and invite me for his wedding.

1959
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,960
Did Vicky come to apologise to you

1960
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:56,000
and invite you for his wedding?
- Yes.

1961
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,360
I misunderstood..

1962
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,400
Khushi, I was sad, so I got drunk.
I can't understand anything.

1963
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:05,920
Please.. I'm..

1964
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,280
Preetham, will you accept my love

1965
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:15,160
and keep me happy for the
rest of my life.

1966
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:31,000
"You are my happiness."

1967
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,440
"My dreams are happy."

1968
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,320
I love you so much.

1969
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,800
I love you too, Khushi.
