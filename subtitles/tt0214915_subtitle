1
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:34,137
Raghava, today too, you will
leave the work incomplete.

2
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:40,884
ls there a wedding in the house
that you need to be so particular?

3
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:46,648
Just apply four strokes with the
brush on these walls.

4
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,226
And quickly run around and
polish these teak furniture.

5
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,692
That's all l've told you to do.

6
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,795
But you have been in this house
with your broom and brush since...

7
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,437
...the last few days.

8
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,638
lt's not that there are no other
painters in this village.

9
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,278
But the people here believe that
'' Maadampally house'', is haunted

10
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,439
...with witches and dare not to step
in here.

11
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:17,120
You were brave enough to come
so l entrusted you with the job.

12
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:22,192
But if you are bent on cheating
me then there will be trouble.

13
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,626
Sharadamma from Calcutta will
be here any minute now.

14
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,167
Are you planning to stay here
with your broom until then?

15
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:38,935
Let me tell you one thing, do as
much as you can today and stop.

16
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:44,172
After that l don't want you
loitering here for this purpose.

17
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,748
l won't pay you any wages for
that then.

18
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,183
Can't you hear me?...

19
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,696
l wonder where he is...
ls he hiding somewhere and painting...

20
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,058
Raghava...

21
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,933
Raghava...

22
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,368
Rajappa...

23
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,774
My god...

24
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
My umbrella...

25
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,593
Vaidyare...

26
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,602
The letter for you is va..do you
know any song starting with va...

27
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,174
l know a lot of things with va..
l've been calling you for long,

28
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,277
lf you happen to see
Dasappankutty, ask him to come..

29
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,580
...home to take out the bucket
which fell into the well.

30
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,015
Don't forget...

31
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,702
Had been to Maadampally house
that's why l am late.

32
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,634
Your daughter had been here, she
just left from here.

33
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,638
ls that all. Now what's
happening here..

34
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,870
l just asked Warrior to tell me a
song starting with the letter pa..

35
00:06:55,014 --> 00:07:02,011
Then... did he sleep over it...
-Yes. And l gave him Ta.

36
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,052
Then.. here it is...

37
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,585
Without taking the key at dawn
from the...

38
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,094
Wait... say that... without giving the
key...

39
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,668
Yes, of course...
Without taking the key at...

40
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,473
lt's not like that, what's wrong
with you today?

41
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,907
l have not taken it, that's all..

42
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:33,179
l've forgotten to take the key
from Maadampally house.

43
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,919
Dasappa, that girl from the
Thekkedath house has been ...

44
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,024
...looking for you. She said that
a bucket has fallen into the well.

45
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,591
l know of it.
l am going there now.

46
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,327
Who's it?

47
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,469
Oh it's you -Where are you
going?

48
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,938
l was on the way to your place.
Has it been taken out?

49
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,734
No, but how come you know of
it?

50
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,176
Our vaidyar told me. You should
have sent Alli to me earlier.

51
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,042
But l haven't been to the house
as yet.

52
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,283
Then come. We'll go together and
get it out.

53
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,314
Are you not afraid
of going out at night?

54
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,459
Me, of course not. Are you afraid?

55
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,822
Not at all. l thought
of taking it tomorrow...

56
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,191
...but l won't get sleep
until l take it.

57
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,629
lt's the heat. l'll take it out and
give it to you.

58
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,324
Once you pour few mugs of
water over you, you'll feel better

59
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,667
lf only l could get a shovel from
some where..- A shovel, what for?

60
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,173
That's not necessary,
l'll get into the well.

61
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,809
But why do you have to enter a
well to take out the key from ...

62
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,903
...Maadampally house.

63
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,647
lf you take the key,
then what about the bucket?

64
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,717
Bucket    What bucket?
- The bucket that fell into the well.

65
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,084
What's wrong with you, you kept
on saying, you'll take it out.

66
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,623
Are you trying to fool me? You
just come with me now.

67
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,260
Where are we going?

68
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,463
Didn't you understand?
...to Maadampally house.

69
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,791
At this time of night. l thought
we were going to take out...

70
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,696
...the bucket.

71
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,768
You don't have to think a lot
just come with me.

72
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,972
On which day were you born?

73
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,336
A Friday.-Oh  so, afraid.
ls it?

74
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,275
Talk softly..

75
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:15,047
lf you are afraid, just sing a song.
l am going to sing one.

76
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,728
Hey...-What's it?
-Who has opened the door?

77
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,693
Just take the key...

78
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,565
Who is going there, Dasappa?

79
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,291
Yesterday night the person you
saw at Maadampally is trapped...

80
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:34,991
...inside. You wait here. lt's none
else than that Tamilian lady.

81
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,501
The fact that you did not wait
there was because of your luck.

82
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,997
l've made these Talismans after
praying.

83
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,871
l am scared
-There's nothing to fear.

84
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,044
Nothing at all. My talismans are
very effective.

85
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:56,379
Without uttering a word, tie them
to the four corners of the house.

86
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,753
l want to urgently go to the loo.
-Go...

87
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,416
Yesterday night you were so
afraid, it's shameful.

88
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,387
A man has to be in control of
his senses. He must be brave.

89
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,649
Anyway since l was present, let
no one hear of this event.

90
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,529
Are you hungry? What is it?

91
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,540
l want to use the toilet

92
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,257
Sister...

93
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,160
What's it, Dasappa?

94
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,992
l have been calling out to you
for so long.

95
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,963
Did brother tell you anything
today? l mean ''tell'' you?

96
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,076
To me, no...
Why do you ask?

97
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,470
Then brother has had this illness
for some time now.

98
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:33,709
Why, what happened? He went
out in the morning without...

99
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,047
...telling me a thing.

100
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,619
That's exactly how he is even
now, he is not saying a word.

101
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,821
No other illness.

102
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,523
Not speaking. l want to see him
this minute.

103
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,286
Has he been taken to a hospital?

104
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,793
No, he is in the toilet.

105
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,295
ln the toilet    Yes, there's nothing
to fear. Come along.

106
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,665
What senseless things are you
saying?

107
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,396
Yesterday night he got a scare
at Maadampally. l told him not to...

108
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,203
...go alone if he is afraid and
that l'll come along.

109
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,216
Yesterday what happened at that
house, you never said anything.

110
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,750
How are you feeling now?

111
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,815
You can't speak. Oh, God

112
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,559
What's all this you are doing?

113
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,490
Did you see...

114
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:27,965
Oh God, what will l do? Leave
him. l shall go to big brother.

115
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,300
l'll ask him to give you a
talisman. Leave me..

116
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:37,242
No need of any talisman, all he
needs is an electric shock.

117
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,157
He got scared.

118
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,423
Yes, that's what Dasappan said.
He is just not answering me.

119
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,599
lf you could chant something and
give it to me...

120
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,095
He may have entered there at an
unsafe hour saying hymns.

121
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,665
He couldn't sleep without taking
charge of the inheritance of...

122
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,403
...those people from Calcutta.
And now what happened?

123
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,909
He filled Sharadamma's ears
with tales and took the...

124
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,950
...key to that house from me.

125
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,777
Long ago famous Tantrics have
chanted powerful chants and ...

126
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,115
...have exorcised the place and
trapped the haunting spirits ...

127
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,682
...in a room. Your husband
is new to this place.

128
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,727
l told him not to have anything
to do with the house.

129
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,764
He never listened to me.

130
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:33,064
Okay, l'll give you a enchanted
thread. But will he tie it.

131
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,570
Yes...
-Then come.

132
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,298
Give it to me.. l came first.

133
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,764
Without speaking a word go and
tie it.

134
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,438
Hey, you will tear it. ...
l told you

135
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,316
What's happening there?
-Nothing...

136
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,808
Hey, look who's here

137
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,436
Ganga, that's uncle.

138
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,547
l thought only sister Sharada
was coming.

139
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,517
l had no idea you were coming
too.

140
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,253
So, where are the others?

141
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,924
We came alone, there's no one
else. Meet Ganga.

142
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,127
Yesterday we arrived very late
from Trivandrum.

143
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,959
We did not want to disturb you
so we went to Maadampally.

144
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,563
You two stayed there alone
yesterday night.

145
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,669
Well, l saw the key in the door,
so l asked Ganga to wait outside

146
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,368
...while l went in to check if
anyone was home.

147
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,635
No one was there.
-Then what did you do?

148
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,645
l thought it was too late to
wake you all.

149
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,371
So we rented a
room in the town.

150
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:31,322
Well, who is this...
do you know us?

151
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,084
How is that possible. Nakul has
never brought you here after ...

152
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,151
...you were married.

153
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,427
Well, ask him when was the last
time he came here.

154
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:47,970
Ganga, this is my aunt, this is her
daughter Jayshree.

155
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,107
How are you? How you have
grown

156
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,044
She's Alli. My uncle's
daughter.

157
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:05,890
Hey, aunt you  too are here. What
is the occasion? How's uncle?

158
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,654
What?...

159
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,690
Okay, don't say a word. Just go
and tie it on him.

160
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,767
That is a talisman for your
uncle. That's why she is silent.

161
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,822
That is uncle's eldest daughter,
Sreedevi.

162
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,394
Did my aunt not come with you?

163
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,331
She was to, but my sister came
and took her to Bombay.

164
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,095
Anyway nowadays who wants
their ancestral house.

165
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,004
Don't worry, l've planned to stay
here for a few days.

166
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,974
Until the work on the new plant
gets over, we'll stay here.

167
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,508
That's nice. Come dear.

168
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:16,155
l assume you will be here for
3 to 4 months.-Almost.

169
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,729
Then you can stay here with us.

170
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,465
No uncle, we'll stay at
Maadampally.

171
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,332
At Maadampally - Yes, why?

172
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,909
lt's true that Maadampally is your
ancestral home and your mother...

173
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:40,985
...is entitled to a share in it but
that house is not good for staying.

174
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,547
That house is haunted since
some time.

175
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,693
You may have heard of it in your
childhood.

176
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,260
There have been many untimely
deaths there.

177
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,163
Girls from outside families who
stay there after marriage are...

178
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:05,004
...harassed... Ganga is a girl
from another family

179
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,874
These are all very outdated
rumours. Who believes them now?

180
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:14,451
You don't have to worry
because l told you.

181
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,918
lf you have decided to stay
there, go ahead.

182
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,318
You can go round and see
everything.

183
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,592
You will come here.

184
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,920
Now l have a few words to say
to you...

185
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,588
Did you think l've lost my
tongue?

186
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,593
So your illness has disappeared.

187
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:03,029
Yes it has. l shall remove any
other illness l had in the morning

188
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,897
What did you say? l should be
given an electric shock.

189
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,732
Who do you think you are to
give me an electric shock?

190
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,909
Are you a lineman with the
Electricity board? You...

191
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:50,013
Don't come close or play games
with me. l'll stab you.

192
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,076
That is Nakul's wife Ganga.

193
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,915
l will hit you..
Don't follow me.

194
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,849
Oh, you are coming from behind
to scare me?

195
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,554
What is it, Vasudha?

196
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,162
What is it you want? ...
Tell me.

197
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:26,676
What is this you are doing? lf
anybody sees us, it's shameful.

198
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,072
lt's true, we are husband and
wife, if you want l'll come home.

199
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:35,117
l said l'll come home.

200
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,849
Leave me. What has happened to
you to behave like this?

201
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,052
lf anyone sees us then we would
rather die.

202
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,553
Sreedevi...

203
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,972
Stop pulling me.

204
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,345
Where are you taking me?

205
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:33,801
No one told me that
they are coming back but yet...

206
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:46,718
...l keep my door half-open
everyday.

207
00:23:48,226 --> 00:24:00,002
Always, l wish someone dear to
me will come.

208
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,845
lt's so quiet here. Such a nice
atmosphere.

209
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:11,980
Do you like it here, Ganga?

210
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,548
Of course, it's so much better
than what l had expected.

211
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,151
Aren't you coming to sleep?

212
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,886
l'm feeling sleepy.
- You sleep.

213
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,828
Are all these books yours,
sister?- Let these be...

214
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:04,458
...kept here for now. We will
shift them somewhere later.

215
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:13,644
What is it? - Have you
read this?-Yes, Why?

216
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:21,183
The author is my teacher in the
college- ls it P. Mahadevan?

217
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,655
He is...- Then what...

218
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:31,155
You know it. -No..
-Yes, you know.

219
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,064
Mother must have told everything
to you.

220
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,498
What?-Nothing, sister

221
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,764
Alli wait...

222
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,207
What is it? Tell me

223
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,807
My marriage has been fixed.

224
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,577
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Has everything been finalised.

225
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:02,056
Yes, in July. He stays in the
adjacent house.

226
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,194
Where? - See there.

227
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,446
l want a room to arrange all my
books neatly.

228
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,277
l have been looking for one since
yesterday.

229
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,248
There are so many rooms
here. Come, l'll show you.

230
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,052
l don't want just any room. l
want a room with windows...

231
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,755
...looking out to the mango
orchard.-Come, let's see.

232
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,209
No one ever comes here.
-Come, let us see.

233
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,677
Sister, l think that room faces
the East.

234
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,141
See, there is some talisman
tied here.

235
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,372
lt's locked too.

236
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,445
That's alright. we can get the
key from father.

237
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:16,718
Daughter...-l think it is uncle.
-Come, let's go.

238
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,909
Come in dear.

239
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,911
Where have you been?
- Upstairs.

240
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:43,750
This is an old house. There
are certain limitations here.

241
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:49,085
There are rooms on the southern
side, where no one ever goes.

242
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:56,623
Those rooms have been locked
up after certain Tantric rituals.

243
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:03,570
Every year during Durgashtami
festival these rituals are done.

244
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,280
The souls of two youngsters
who had untimely deaths were...

245
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,640
...exorcised and trapped in there.

246
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,417
Today's youth might not
believe it.

247
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:24,427
You don't go there, That's what,
l came to tell you.

248
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,698
Why should we challenge
the dead?

249
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,067
Who were these people who
died?

250
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:43,414
Some 150 years ago there was a
powerful Nobleman.

251
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:48,546
He brought a dancer from
Tanjavur, and she stayed here.

252
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,457
Her name was Nagavalli. She
loved a third person.

253
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,592
He was a dancer called
Ramanathan.

254
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:03,261
Once he came in search of her
and stayed in the adjacent house.

255
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,504
Somehow, the Nobleman got to
Know of this.

256
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,733
That night he killed Nagavalli in
that room upstairs.

257
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,845
lt is said that on the night of
Durgashtami her soul took the...

258
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:25,113
...form of a witch and
entered that room to kill him.

259
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,726
The Nobleman chanted some
powerful chants and was saved.

260
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:36,866
But after that her soul roamed
this place day and night.

261
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:45,467
Then they brought a famous
Tantrik, who performed rituals.

262
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,201
He managed to snare her soul
into that room and secured it ...

263
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,776
...with a powerful talisman.

264
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,776
Eventually the old nobleman too
drank poison and died.

265
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:58,018
His soul too is trapped in the
same room.

266
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,019
These are stories our
grandmothers told us.

267
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,953
Who knows,
what is the truth?

268
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:09,663
Do you know who is staying now
at the house Ramanathan stayed?

269
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,402
lt's Alli's fiancee,
a college lecturer.

270
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,739
Your mother has often told me
that there are many valuable ...

271
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,583
...things in this house.

272
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,752
l've looked everywhere but never
saw a thing.

273
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,649
l think it might have all been
kept in that locked room.

274
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,656
So that no one would enter to
steal those things, all these ...

275
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,897
...ghost stories may have been
made up.

276
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:47,828
l want to open that room.
What do you say?

277
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,540
Open it if you want to.

278
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,528
They just came and
gave the key.

279
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,036
Better open it before anyone
comes here.

280
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,605
Shall l go now? Have to go to
college. l will come later.

281
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:08,840
Come once and see...

282
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:22,625
Won't you seek the gate?
Please come...

283
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:37,331
Let me get a glance of you
today...

284
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,809
Just once...

285
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:52,784
Please fulfill my longing to
see you... Fulfill it.

286
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,252
That room has been barred and
protected for a long time now.

287
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,448
Father too warned you, yet you
got a key made to open it.

288
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,389
l came to stop you, but you
seem to have opened it already.

289
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,588
lt wasn't the right thing to do.
Now l wonder what will happen.

290
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,725
What is there to fear if l have
opened a room in the house in...

291
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,364
...which we are staying is what
l fail to understand.

292
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,304
Do you believe all this?

293
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,165
How can l not believe?

294
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,945
The locksmith who made this key
is bedridden with sores on him.

295
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,979
And that boy, Chandu's friend
who took the key to be made...

296
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,811
...he is down with fever too.

297
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:05,088
l and Chandu will stay here for
a few days just in case...

298
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:13,864
lf at all anything happens we
will all bear it together.

299
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:28,174
Until l get this pooja done for
repentance, and install this holy...

300
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:33,756
...vessel in that room and tie a
holy thread, l will not get peace.

301
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:54,594
Someone is going to come this
way one day. l know that.

302
00:38:55,866 --> 00:39:05,298
A dear one will come this way
is what l always wish for.

303
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,576
Even now it's what l hope
for today.

304
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:17,280
Many a time has the season of
flowers lost it's way...

305
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:22,724
... there are no flowers on
the mango tree branches...

306
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:32,869
For that alone there should be a
season when it blooms.

307
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:06,265
l know there's no one to come
yet l wait at the door...

308
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:17,269
Without knowing for whom it is,
l wait inside the door expectantly

309
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,518
l wait expectantly.

310
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:33,921
A person dear to me will come
is what l wish for always...

311
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:51,848
With promises to meet again,
he left me ...

312
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:56,244
l knew he would not
come...

313
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:06,854
But l stand at the main
door regularly, waiting for him.

314
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:12,832
A person dear to me
will come.

315
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:17,804
At the door like a statue l wait
hoping you will come.

316
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:51,633
Unexpectedly, l felt that l heard
someone's footsteps.

317
00:41:52,643 --> 00:42:02,450
The spring should bring
something and remain forever.

318
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,719
lf it should bring something...

319
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:20,094
At times, l run with hope on to
the path with eager eyes...

320
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:29,312
...someone who lost his way has
come and gone...

321
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:44,458
...comes and goes back...

322
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,973
Will you sing a song in that
Raga?

323
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,878
Who are you?
- Me only, Nagavalli...

324
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,381
My God...
Oh God...

325
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:55,042
Nakuletta,
Ganga...

326
00:45:55,486 --> 00:46:03,018
Wake up, someone is knocking at
the door. l think it is Sreedevi.

327
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:10,959
What happened?

328
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,798
Please come, the maid has seen
something and she's screaming...

329
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,437
...with fear. She is breathless
and has a pain in her chest.

330
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,980
What is it? ...
What happened?

331
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,480
She says she saw something
that scared her.

332
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,645
What happened, Shanta?

333
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,323
l heard the sound of anklets and
woke up.

334
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,393
There she was at the window
with her hair open.

335
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,561
You are just hallucinating. You
think of all sorts of things...

336
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,000
...before sleeping and then get
scared.

337
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,605
You can sleep in the next room
if you are scared here...

338
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,978
What happened?-See, someone
dropped it and it broke.

339
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,288
Don't cause unnecessary
problems.

340
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,728
Who is here to open her hair
and walk, or break things?

341
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:56,367
Don't make up stories and lose
your job.

342
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:04,604
Come...
Sreedevi, you too...

343
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,091
Who has arranged for all
these people?

344
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,687
lt was Uncle.

345
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,829
Then ask Uncle to get rid of
these people.

346
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,226
They are the ones who cause
trouble saying things like...

347
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:27,301
...there are witches and ogres in
Maadampally and ghosts...

348
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,489
What's all this?

349
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,769
Chandu, you go to sleep. we'll look
into all this tomorrow.

350
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,941
Go,... you too Sreedevi.

351
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,054
Come, don't be scared.

352
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:46,841
Let me speak first and you don't
tell me any excuses.

353
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,815
Just listen to what we say
without any arguments.

354
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,680
What is it?

355
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,522
You take Ganga and stay at
some other place now itself.

356
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,452
Why?

357
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,219
This house is a disturbed house.

358
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,519
You don't have to stay to know
the truth.

359
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,187
Let us conduct the necessary
rituals, then you come back.

360
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:06,836
l am the only person to advise
U in the absence of your mother

361
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,040
There was something else that l
wanted to speak to you about..

362
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,334
Don't back-answer.
Just do as we say.

363
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,171
This is not the time to argue.

364
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,905
Uncle, since you have spoken so
much, atleast let me say...

365
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,341
lt's Ganga...

366
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,231
What happened...

367
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,737
Her sari caught fire.

368
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,883
Ganga, what happened?

369
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,416
Lie down.
What happened?

370
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,423
l don't know how it happened...

371
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,263
l came to know only after the
sari had caught fire.

372
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:08,822
Where did it happen?

373
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,933
l never went inside the kitchen, l
was standing in the verandah.

374
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,194
Was there anyone else with you?

375
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,373
There wasn't anyone else, only l
and Sreedevi.

376
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,545
Don't get up now...
-Now l am okay, you can go.

377
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,271
Alli, give me a sari.

378
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,751
Uncle, can you please come
here?

379
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,096
What is it?

380
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,662
Don't mind my asking you,
l have few doubts.

381
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,531
l can't tell it to anyone else
but you.

382
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:52,401
Please be clear about what you
want to say to me.

383
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:59,014
l wanted to ask you if Sreedevi
had any psychological problems.

384
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:08,989
lf you have ever felt anything of
the sort, be free to tell me.

385
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,457
We will show her to
a psychiatrist.

386
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,920
Whatever are you saying?

387
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,989
You and that modern girl did
things here which you should...

388
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,659
...not have done and so all
this happened.

389
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,570
How can you hold Sreedevi
responsible?

390
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,830
Did you know what happened
here last night?

391
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,771
You would not agree to anything.

392
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,436
So l came here yesterday night
to install a holy vessel in that...

393
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,841
...room without telling you.

394
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,945
Do you know what we saw?

395
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,977
Would you believe it if l told you?

396
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,986
We saw that dancer from the
south with our own eyes.

397
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,216
Dasappan and the Tantri are
witnesses.

398
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,354
Oh  So you saw it too. Then
there's no room for doubt.

399
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,430
Everyone here is...

400
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,167
What do l say...

401
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,132
What senseless things, are you
saying?

402
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,362
What is wrong with Sreedevi?

403
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,608
Since l am the head of the
family there are a few things...

404
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,569
...l need to do here. After that
you can come here to stay.

405
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,110
Will you or won't you leave
from here today?

406
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,717
No, l and Ganga won't go away
no matter what anyone says.

407
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,417
You can do as you wish but l
have also decided that ...

408
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,318
...something needs to be done
about Sreedevi.

409
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,374
What happened?.. What's the
problem?...

410
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,573
He is not concerned about
leaving.

411
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,438
He is not at all concerned about
those blood-thirsty souls that...

412
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,877
...have been let loose.

413
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,948
According to him, it is my
daughter, who has a problem.

414
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:47,452
Sreedevi     What could be wrong
with her?

415
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:50,191
That's something you had better
ask him.

416
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,920
There's no reason she should
have a problem.

417
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,933
Now it was only this much, if l
hadn't noticed it could have...

418
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:09,236
...been more serious. Did you
hear me well?

419
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,977
We didn't go near her.
-ls it?

420
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,515
No... Don't cause any more
trouble here now.

421
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,620
Do not use the gas stove, you
start using the kerosene stove.

422
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,461
What is it, uncle?

423
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,228
No, it's nothing.

424
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,503
What is it?

425
00:54:56,993 --> 00:55:03,125
Brother-in-law, listen to me,
there's something wrong with...

426
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:09,535
...Sreedevi. - What?..
-Something is definitely wrong.

427
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,372
Yesterday, that Tamilian lady
who came down from that room..

428
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,408
...won't disappear just like that

429
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:21,014
l have a doubt she has entered
inside Sreedevi.

430
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:27,812
Yes...
Come and see for yourself.

431
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,973
What is it?

432
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,344
What is it?

433
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,805
lt's nothing. Nothing is wrong
with you.

434
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,684
You continue swinging like that
till morning.

435
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,826
What is it, father?

436
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:17,373
Daughter

437
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,134
What is it, mother?..

438
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:26,374
What is it Uncle, Aunt?...
-Nothing.

439
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:27,909
You tell me what it is.

440
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,892
l want Dr. Sunny here.
There is a lot of problem here.

441
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,924
Day by day the patient is going
from bad to worse.

442
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,930
lf he can't help now then, what
use in his being a psychiatrist.

443
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,965
Please inform him now.

444
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,037
Uncle had wanted Sreedevi and
Nakul to get married.

445
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,777
But there was a problem in
Sreedevi's horoscope.

446
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,379
lt was however a good match
with his.

447
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:05,617
Yet Nakul's mother was not
happy and so she refused.

448
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,553
ln revenge, uncle got Sreedevi
married on the day of Nakul's

449
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,592
marriage to you without revealing
the problem in her horoscope.

450
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,494
Finally when the groom came to
know of it, he sent her back.

451
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,866
Since then Sreedevi is here.

452
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,799
Now after you all came, she
was again happy.

453
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,911
But that too had to end like
this. lt is all one's destiny.

454
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,747
lf the Tamil lady from the room
has entered Sreedevi then the ...

455
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:40,716
...nobleman, who came down
with her must be around here.

456
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:59,970
No... Don't come for me l say.
l will prick you.

457
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:04,741
l am only related by marriage to
Basura, to this house.

458
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,448
l am telling you...
don't come near.

459
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:26,160
Don't come near me,
nobleman.

460
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,561
l have already told you not to
play with me.

461
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:35,008
l am just a relative and play
with the many youngsters here

462
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:39,139
What is it...
What is it, Uncle?

463
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,515
Uncle, What uncle,
Which uncle?

464
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:48,219
Who has let her loose?

465
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,788
What happened, uncle?

466
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:54,521
You don't call me uncle.
You Tamilian lady...

467
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:06,365
Uncle...- Don't come near me. l
am bad to the bad.

468
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,237
Don't call me uncle and kill me.
Just go away.

469
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,912
Someone save me.

470
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,116
Come fast, he's killing me..

471
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,100
Who is it?

472
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,302
Oh, so it's you

473
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,962
ls this the mad person,
you spoke of?

474
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,739
He is very violent, he should
have been locked up.

475
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:42,808
Lock me...

476
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,977
Let him go...

477
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,746
Don't do anything to him,
listen to me.

478
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,014
He says he is a senior member
of the family.

479
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:55,887
What member, what senior? He
says he is Basuda's husband.

480
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,219
Who is this Basuda?
-My wife and his aunt.

481
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,124
Let him go, he's my uncle.

482
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,055
Oh, your uncle

483
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,995
Yes, by marriage. - l am sorry.
Don't touch me.

484
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,040
Since you came to hit me with
an umbrella l thought,...

485
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,831
...there was something wrong
with you.

486
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,968
Anyway, l am sorry, uncle.

487
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,812
He is a famous doctor from
America.

488
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,973
He treats Psychic cases.
-Psychiatrist?

489
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,553
Did you tell this madman
there's nothing wrong with me.

490
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,594
l mean the mad-people's
doctor?

491
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:41,459
How did you land here? l called
everywhere to locate you.

492
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:46,764
Not without use; now l am
specialising in Mahendra hypnosis.

493
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:51,379
lt is in great demand in America.
My Lord     ...

494
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,309
Dear Sunny, tell me the truth.
How did you come here?

495
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,508
From the pilgrimage centre of
Sabarimala.

496
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:01,816
You called my house, and they
called Ramachandran.

497
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,526
l got news about your problem
in Madras and flew down here.

498
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,804
Who's that?...
Your patient...

499
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,742
No, a distant relative.

500
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:29,941
Relative... Then via Madras, i
came to Cochin, then to the ...

501
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:37,183
...temple of Sabarimala, then
Kottayam, then back here ...

502
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,952
...by an auto-rickshaw.

503
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,037
ls this the patient?

504
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,001
He is my maternal uncle.

505
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,212
He is the friend l spoke to you
about, he's a psychiatrist.

506
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,150
He has acquired a gold medal
from America.

507
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,060
He is very famous, Dr. Sunny
Joseph.

508
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:17,925
My daughter is not mad. You
don't make her one.

509
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:27,402
Then l came from place to place
in an auto-rickshaw...

510
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:42,855
What? No, nothing, then l came
in this auto to your Maadampally.

511
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:01,603
What happened?-Nothing. She came
and peeped just now..-Who?

512
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,872
The one you told me about,
Rashmi.-Oh  Sreedevi

513
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,044
But it's difficult to treat and
cure her. She is a little older.

514
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,046
You must have seen my aunt.
-Your aunt

515
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:19,126
You have a bath, change your
robes, study the problems here.

516
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,353
Okay, l'll do all that, but there
is enough time for that.

517
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,621
Where is your wife?

518
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,848
Who is it?

519
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,322
Sister Ganga

520
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:32,966
Nakuletta...

521
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,166
l'll come too.

522
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:47,480
Nakuletta...

523
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,966
She's inside here.

524
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,131
She will suffocate in there.

525
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,473
Break it...
1 , 2... 3...

526
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,550
Tell me, Alli,
what happened?

527
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:09,694
When l went upstairs, l felt
someone was following me.

528
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:16,562
l ran, l got into this room but
someone locked it from outside.

529
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,575
Why did you go up?

530
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,869
To look for sister Ganga.

531
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,108
Who told you, l was upstairs?

532
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,083
Sister Sreedevi.

533
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,212
But she had seen me go for a
bath downstairs.

534
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,797
Sunny, come with me.

535
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,371
You saw everything. These are
the problems here.

536
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:56,039
What sort of behavior is this?
What does she mean by this?

537
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,812
You understand the seriousness
of it.

538
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,112
l'll give you the Prasadam, (holy
offerings).

539
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:09,189
Where is my bag? All the
Prasadam was in it.

540
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,359
Oh my God

541
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:36,249
l vow by the name of God,
l'll get the person who did this.

542
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,078
l will get him.

543
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,664
Stop, stop.

544
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,745
Where are you going?

545
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:09,681
l am going to meet a tantric.
after that night's episode...

546
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,715
...there have been bad events
happening in the house.

547
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:16,847
l am going to meet a famous
tantric to ask him a solution.

548
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,083
You too can come.

549
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,495
Well, who's this. ls it
Padmanabhan Sir?

550
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,162
Padmanabhan
-No, not you...

551
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,068
Oh, it's you Unni Sir

552
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:40,175
Who's this? lsn't it Kunjankutty?..

553
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:47,287
Send him out.
-Out...

554
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,791
Go fast..

555
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,856
You go get a talisman, there's
something wrong with you.

556
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:10,969
Who is this? ls it Meenakshi...
Why you are in a scooter?

557
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:15,584
Not a girl, but it is me,
Dasappan, brother.

558
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:21,816
Brother, something wrong in
Maadampally.

559
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:33,300
Our Sreedevi has become mad.
-Well said. See me properly

560
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,143
There is some problem.

561
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,816
Sunny...- Yes- What are
you looking for?

562
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:56,056
Where is the bathroom?
-lt's there.

563
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:00,327
l have no Mundu, (white garment
worn around the waist).

564
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,291
Give me a mundu.

565
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,857
You go ahead,
l'll send you one.

566
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,791
To the left...
-Yes

567
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,770
Where's my Mundu?

568
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:53,074
Who is it there, speak up?

569
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:59,344
Who is there who took my
Mundu?... Who is it?

570
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,213
Who are you, girl?
-lt's not a she, it's a he

571
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:09,021
Who is he?-lt's me.-Who me?
lt's me the doctor Sunny.

572
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,227
Okay. Give me back my
Mundu.

573
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,532
l had come for my bath and
taken it off.

574
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:15,795
l have worn it.

575
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,940
That's not right. What do l
wear now.

576
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,841
l'll give it back to you now.

577
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,373
Did you recognize me?

578
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,679
l wanted to see you.

579
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:35,688
Stop talking to me like that or
else...

580
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:40,054
When l saw you l knew you were
not the right sort of person.

581
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,360
Give me back my clothes.

582
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,433
Wait, wait, no one need
know.

583
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,537
Give me some time either in the
morning or evening.

584
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:51,967
l'll do whatever is possible.

585
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,735
You dog... lf you speak any more
nonsense l'll show you.

586
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,037
lf anyone passes by what would
they say   Give me my Mundu.

587
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:01,876
Here take it back. Don't you allow
a man to wear a mundu also?

588
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,266
l came here in the afternoon.

589
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,962
We met outside the bathroom.

590
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,671
You never asked me my name.

591
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,474
Why didn't you ask me, why l
came here?

592
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:36,682
l know you are the one who has
come from America to treat me.

593
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,718
So, you know everything.

594
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,621
Okay, now the doctor is ready.
But l need a patient too.

595
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:48,590
That's why they have kept me
here. All of you treat me.

596
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,197
So you agree... you are the
patient. That's enough.

597
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,412
Don't you want to sleep?

598
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,813
Come, l'll show
your room.

599
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,892
You don't worry about where or
when l sleep.

600
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,086
Just pretend l am not here.

601
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:30,365
Did you meet Sreedevi?-Yes,
but it is the primary stage.

602
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:36,109
We can cure that. You go sleep.
Today there won't be any trouble.

603
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:40,247
You can call us if you need
anything. - Good night.

604
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,527
Sreedevi...
Sreedevi...

605
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:33,162
Who is it? ...
Who is it?

606
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,234
Who is it?
-lt's Nakulan.

607
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,020
What is it?

608
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:00,693
Nothing... There was some...

609
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:51,277
Won't you come once to my
house to see me?

610
01:15:52,247 --> 01:16:02,145
Won't you show yourself today
and fulfill my longing?

611
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:13,527
l am a lady suffering due
to your separation.

612
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:24,111
l am a lady who has none to
adorn her with flowers.

613
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:34,954
l am like a bird stuck in net
spread by someone and...

614
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:45,323
...l am trying to find my mate.

615
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:55,609
Won't you come atleast once
to my house to see me?

616
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,022
Wait...

617
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,593
Why were you roaming
here? -l had to go to the toilet.

618
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:25,130
Upstairs...
-No.

619
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,398
Then why did you run on seeing
me?

620
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,167
l wanted to go to the loo
urgently.

621
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,033
When, where...

622
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:38,136
To the loo...
-You do it here...Yes, do it

623
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:47,619
l saw...
l saw the vessel.

624
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:50,086
Eeks
-The vessel...

625
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:55,261
lt's not right to roam at
night...Vessel.

626
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:59,256
l am saved.
Vessel...Vessel

627
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:17,147
Did you sleep here yesterday
night?

628
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:23,380
Yes, yesterday night after the
dance performance, it was late..

629
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,855
What dance performance?

630
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,722
Who is learning classical dance
here? - Nobody here.

631
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:34,762
Yesterday night l heard someone
upstairs dancing with anklets on.

632
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,504
With anklets?...-Yes
-Did you really hear it?

633
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,764
l heard it but l did not see the
person.

634
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,538
The room to the far east.

635
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,274
But it is locked.

636
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,612
Why doesn't someone sleep there
at night?

637
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:53,113
But that is not locked any longer
and no one sleeps there.

638
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,355
Maybe, it was my imagination.
Come, let's go and see.

639
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,818
Tea?- l'll have it later.
Give me my glasses.

640
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:10,394
This is not locked.
-Not locked...Yes..

641
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:20,875
So this is the disputed
room mentioned by Nakulan.

642
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,255
lsn't he the cruel nobleman?

643
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,925
He doesn't seem to be a good
person by his looks.

644
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:37,859
Where is the second party to all
this, the dancer?-Come.

645
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:42,628
See, it's her.

646
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:53,239
So, l was wrong, Absolutely wrong. -What?

647
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,541
That old man was a good
person, a nice person.-What?

648
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,555
lf she is the dancer, who was
also Ramanathan's lover,...

649
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:07,055
...then l won't blame the old
nobleman for kidnapping her.

650
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,455
What a structure

651
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:13,325
Don't you want to see the house
where Ramanathan lived?

652
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:18,900
See, there.

653
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,511
So this is where the girl
Nagavalli used to sing...

654
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:35,655
Come and see me once...
Come and meet me once..

655
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,355
Don't you want to see her
ornaments?

656
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,191
See...A gold chain of jasmine-
buds  Mango shaped chain

657
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,423
A gold ring.
A gold coin necklace.

658
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,931
An ornament worn on the head.
Where are the anklets?

659
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,266
lt must be here somewhere. My
tea must be cold...

660
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:52,504
Have to go to the toilet...

661
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:14,788
Stop there.

662
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,333
What is that sound when you
walk?

663
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,270
What is the tinkling sound when
you walk?

664
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:27,571
Anklets..

665
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,207
From where did you get it?
-ln the hall.

666
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:34,212
So that's it  you are the one who
roams around here at night.

667
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:37,178
No... -Then why did you put it in
your pocket.

668
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,980
l wanted to know if it made a
noise, if l put it in my pocket.

669
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:45,418
ls it?
Then, l will keep it.

670
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,794
Do you want it?...
-No.

671
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:55,492
Then go... Vessel...- What ?
- Vessel...

672
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,682
How are you?

673
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:13,816
Why did you call me yesterday
night?

674
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,554
lt must be part of your
treatment.

675
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,823
Whatever you feel,
it is a good sign.

676
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:27,595
Even if you give the right
answer l want to cross-check.

677
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,130
What is it?

678
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:35,432
Even if you give the right
answer l want to cross-check.

679
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,857
Don't touch me,
go.

680
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:05,105
What was he trying to do,
putting his hands inside windows.

681
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:09,139
He's not a good sort. He tried
to flirt with me the day he came

682
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,078
Be careful.

683
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:21,817
Get up...
Let's go to the temple.

684
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,255
We'll go later...

685
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,220
Take Sreedevi too with you.

686
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,294
What?

687
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,294
When you go to the temple, take
Sreedevi with you.

688
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:34,499
What for?

689
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:41,600
Don't ask me why. l can say or
do as l please.

690
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,268
Maybe l can sleep with the girl
who was once to marry you.

691
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:49,643
Shall l?... You must consider it
as part of the treatment.

692
01:24:53,455 --> 01:25:03,524
Go to the temple, be close to
her like you did in your youth.

693
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:07,031
Let me see and learn.

694
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,670
ls it necessary?

695
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,338
Yes, absolutely. lt's necessary

696
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,400
lt is needed, Nakulan.

697
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,257
Poor thing. Did you decide on the
line of treatment?

698
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:38,262
Consider all this as part of
the treatment...-Why?

699
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:40,091
They are friends after all.

700
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:45,068
At this rate, you better think of
getting married again.

701
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:49,265
What are you saying? So that's
what you think of Nakulan.

702
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,044
l was just joking. Leave it.

703
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,840
You are always like this. You
always find fault with everyone.

704
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,883
Yes, that's right. l'm seeing a lot
of wrongs in the southern room...

705
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,746
...of Maadampally. -ln the southern
room?

706
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:02,323
What is it?
-Nothing.

707
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:07,494
l think there's a lot of shady
things going on there.

708
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:13,892
There are many costly things in
there... Did you see this?

709
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:20,465
This is Nagavalli's anklet. Where
did you get it from?

710
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:25,278
You mean the 150 year old
anklet?-Yes.

711
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:28,778
Then you are wrong. This is not
that one.

712
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:34,817
This is not even five years old.
Which means the original's stolen

713
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,650
The anklet of Nagavalli has gone
from the Southern room.

714
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,625
Where will it go?
This is the same one.

715
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:41,557
You may think so, but it is not
the original one.

716
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:44,996
You keep quiet, Sunny. l have
studied about old artifacts.

717
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:45,995
This is the Original one.

718
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,431
You know nothing. This is not
Nagavalli's anklet.

719
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,894
Yes, yes, yes.

720
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:51,036
And if it's not?
-And if it is.

721
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,501
No, l say.
-Yes, it is.

722
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:53,765
Who said so?
-l am saying it.

723
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,009
l have studied a
lot about all this.

724
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,974
Well, So have l.
lt is not Nagavalli's anklet

725
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,010
l say it is Nagavalli's anklet.
Don't argue.-Who's arguing?

726
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,375
ls it me?
-No, it's me.

727
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,574
l'll prove beyond doubt it is not
her anklet.

728
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,113
You don't know a thing.

729
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,650
Me, me, me...

730
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:11,280
There's no use arguing amongst
ourselves. You go.

731
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,056
What is it? What happened?

732
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,459
She is arguing unnecessarily,
as if all others are ldiots.

733
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,600
She maybe your wife, but
l can't accept...

734
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:25,632
Why are you behaving like a
kid? Let it go. -Okay.

735
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:34,573
Why am l here without you?

736
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:44,284
Can a fish live without water.
By continuously looking at...

737
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:50,015
...the path, through which you'll
be coming, my eyes are tired

738
01:28:50,925 --> 01:29:01,096
Can't you hear the noise of the
anklets of a dancer which...

739
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:11,472
...will tell you the story of a
lady who is fading away.

740
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:21,989
Who is it?

741
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,091
Who is it?

742
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,027
Who is it?

743
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,663
l am Sankaran Thambi.

744
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:35,228
You cruel man,
Open the door.

745
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,431
Open the door.
Open it...

746
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,344
Who are you?

747
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:48,914
You rascal, you ask me who l
am. l am Nagavalli.

748
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:50,840
Why have you come?

749
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,249
To kill you and drink your
blood.

750
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:55,411
Open the door.

751
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:59,058
You cannot kill me Nagavalli.

752
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,728
Open the door. l am going to kill
you this Durgashtami day.

753
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,229
Then only my revenge will
be fulfilled.

754
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,693
Then come on Durgashtami.

755
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,799
Now you go, Nagavalli.

756
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:18,839
Now l'll go, but l'll be back. To
kill you and drink your blood.

757
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:09,692
You don't have to worry any
more.

758
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:12,792
My previous life's good deeds
has made...

759
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:16,236
The famous Tantric l spoke to
you about has agreed to ...

760
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:19,098
...take up this case. You need not
worry any more.

761
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:27,314
He said if there's any ritual to
be performed...- Sit...

762
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:32,818
...he will surely come here.

763
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:38,959
The Navaratri festival which was
earlier conducted by our family,...

764
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,991
...has to be conducted this time.

765
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:45,097
You don't object. lt's important
for the family.

766
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:47,924
l have no objections to holding
any festival.

767
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,367
But l don't want you to call
tantric's to treat Sreedevi.

768
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:55,407
What are you saying? You know
nothing.

769
01:31:55,610 --> 01:32:02,379
You have called some guy to
treat Sreedevi. lt's not right.

770
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,380
He will give her an injection to
make her unconscious.

771
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:09,916
And nothing is going to change.
What is it?

772
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,421
Look there, it's him.
-Where?

773
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:14,822
There, there...

774
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:26,636
How can we get rid of this guy?
He says he is a doctor.

775
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:28,138
What doctor?

776
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:36,613
He will make us all mad. l say,
...where are you?..

777
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:56,600
What is it with you? You seem
to be wherever l go.

778
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:00,635
Come on... up here.

779
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:12,381
What?
-What are you studying for?

780
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,556
B.A.- What's your second
language?

781
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:20,022
lndi- Oh, lndi.
No, hindi.

782
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:22,562
Then how come you know Tamil.

783
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:25,491
l... Don't play with me.
l will hypnotize you.

784
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,926
Do you know music?- No

785
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:31,400
Then how come you were singing
in Tamil yesterday night?

786
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:37,868
You look like a pretentious
guy to me.

787
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:41,448
l have seen you in many
suspicious circumstances.

788
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:45,946
l won't spare you. What do you
roam at night for?

789
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:47,120
You want to go to the toilet all
the time.

790
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:50,381
From where do you get all this urine.

791
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:55,192
Tell me the truth, lf l start
hypnotizing you, l can't stop.

792
01:33:56,063 --> 01:34:00,966
l want to help my sister. l know
all of you will make her mad.

793
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,969
l know...

794
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:09,306
No Chandu...
l was just joking.

795
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:14,503
l didn't expect you
to be so innocent.

796
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:18,313
l just can't joke with
anyone here

797
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:27,223
Here take this... Everyone here is
very serious... Come...

798
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:35,597
l am going to tell you
something serious.

799
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,965
You don't roam around here at
night.

800
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,407
There is going to be an accident
at your ancestral home.

801
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:55,215
Do l look like, l am joking?
lt's not a joke. lt can happen.

802
01:34:55,423 --> 01:35:00,486
Anytime today or tomorrow.
Definitely before Durgashtami.

803
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:09,465
Only you know of it now. No one
else should know.

804
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,106
What can be done?

805
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:19,411
Let's see. Do you trust me?

806
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,182
Yes
-Then tell me where Yevur is?

807
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:25,050
Yevur. That's a bit far.

808
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:32,818
Both of us will go there today.
Let's go get Alli's cycle.

809
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:35,120
lt's about 10 to 20 kms. away.
We'll go by bus.

810
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:39,560
lt's only 20 kms. away. We'll go
on cycle. Go get Alli's cycle.Go fast...

811
01:35:56,617 --> 01:36:01,714
Many a time has the season of
flowers lost it's way...

812
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:06,686
...there are no flowers in the
mango tree branches.

813
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:17,259
Someone who loves me will
come... the cuckoo sings...

814
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:22,201
The cuckoo sings and says...

815
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:32,142
Unexpectedly, l felt that l
heard some footsteps

816
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:42,661
The spring should bring
something and remain forever

817
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:47,761
lf it should bring something.

818
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:58,709
ls no one home?

819
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:01,145
Who are you?

820
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,513
We have come with a message
from Brahmananda Namboodiri.

821
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:16,921
This is a list of things to be
kept ready for the rituals.

822
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,395
He'll come here on the morning
of Durgashtami.

823
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:25,702
So, there's a problem?

824
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:30,673
He'll tell you himself. He's asked
you to get everything in the list.

825
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:38,642
He has asked everyone of you
including servants to be careful.

826
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:45,715
lf anyone is ill, take special care
of that person.

827
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:52,296
We will leave now.-Will you
have something to eat?

828
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,232
No...
- Or drink?

829
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,303
The head priest has asked us
not to eat anything from here.

830
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,476
Did you hear that? what are we
supposed to do now?

831
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:13,118
Till the head priest comes, we
have to take care of Sreedevi.

832
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:17,052
To take care of...
-Lock her up.

833
01:38:20,427 --> 01:38:23,021
Why are you insisting on locking
her up?

834
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:24,632
We'll decide what has to be
done.

835
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:26,224
lt's better to lock her up.

836
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:27,834
You are the one who should be
locked up.

837
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:30,766
You have come here, blowing
your own trumpet from America.

838
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:51,558
Knives, penknives and axes. Are
there any more of these here.

839
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,224
Where are you taking them all?

840
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:54,985
We are going to have a
collection.

841
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:57,121
l need it here for cooking

842
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,664
Just do as l say. ls that all?

843
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:03,936
Here is the iron-prick for
papadams.

844
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:06,529
Let it come.

845
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:21,818
Who has put it here?

846
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:29,718
Nakula...

847
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:50,850
Don't drink that.

848
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:15,865
There's poison in it.

849
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:31,580
l told you to lock up Sreedevi.

850
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,122
Lock up Sreedevi...

851
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:36,824
Lock up Sreedevi...

852
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:42,367
No, don't ...Father ...Father...

853
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:47,839
No.. No...

854
01:40:54,615 --> 01:40:56,515
Open the door

855
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:01,849
Open the door
No...

856
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:08,225
Open... open...

857
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,834
l won't allow this.
l won't allow this.

858
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:22,600
Tell that doctor...

859
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:30,840
Tell him to give me that poison
and let me die. l will die.l won't live.

860
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:32,650
Move..
Move...

861
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:42,526
Did l do it? Tell me ...
did l do it?

862
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:46,756
Tell me...
Did l do it?

863
01:42:36,049 --> 01:42:44,047
ln the songs of times gone by,
there was an old man...

864
01:42:45,025 --> 01:42:49,894
...there was a bird dozing
inside a historical room...

865
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:53,692
...filled with lot of
sorrowful memories of love.

866
01:42:54,234 --> 01:43:03,074
Oh beauty  Are you lost
in those memories?

867
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:12,715
A soulful tune is reflected
as a dream in your eyes.

868
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:22,018
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...

869
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:16,640
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...

870
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:30,658
The song of parting is here,,,,
Even the veena is silent...

871
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:40,264
The fallen branch felt the
pain of separation.

872
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:49,212
The eyes and heart felt
the same kind of darkness.

873
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:39,725
The bird entered the trap and
locked itself...

874
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:52,610
The bird entered the trap and
locked itself...

875
01:45:54,081 --> 01:46:02,648
...and has forgotten the lines
in her song.

876
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:11,454
Chose to melt away like frozen dreams...

877
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:29,883
...there was a bird dozing
inside a historical room...

878
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:39,382
...filled with lot of
sorrowful memories of love.

879
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:48,334
Oh beauty  Are you lost
in those memories?

880
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:57,934
A soulful tune is reflected
as a dream in your eyes.

881
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:05,750
ln the songs of times gone by,
there was an old man...

882
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:27,600
Has a snake doctor come
from Africa... No..

883
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:32,672
Shantamma said that a mental
doctor come from America

884
01:47:33,647 --> 01:47:37,310
l want to see him
-l am that fortunate one.

885
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:48,327
Rajappan and Kuttapan are saying
that my behaviour has changed.

886
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:50,462
Please check me, doctor.

887
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:06,506
Your behavior has some
problem-Then start treating me

888
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:08,510
l will do it but after some time.

889
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:14,446
l have locked someone in a room
and started her treatment

890
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:17,316
After that l will attend to your
case.

891
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:24,329
While going, do not touch water
as water is dangerous to you.

892
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:31,395
Water... There is water there
See... water

893
01:48:48,722 --> 01:48:51,486
lt has been a traditional family
festival for years.

894
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:54,489
Once the head priest has said it
must be revived, then it must be.

895
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:55,786
lt's just for three days.

896
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:58,523
We'll all come together and make
it a grand occasion. That's all.

897
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:11,967
Didn't you go to the temple to
see the dance performance?

898
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:14,614
lt is a bore.
l don't want to go.

899
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:19,612
After staying in a village it
wouldn't be good not to see it.

900
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:21,710
Okay, we'll go.

901
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:25,121
And you?
l am ready.- Wait a minute.

902
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:30,828
Everyone has gone taking
Sreedevi with them.

903
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:33,759
Why did they do that?

904
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,331
Uncle insisted that all members
of the family must participate ...

905
01:49:35,502 --> 01:49:41,065
...in all the functions. they are
going to have some rituals too.

906
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:43,209
Anyway, let's see...

907
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,368
Where is Ganga?

908
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:04,009
Sunny, where is Ganga?

909
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:09,681
Where's Ganga, l say?

910
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:10,719
Come, let's look.

911
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:43,618
l didn't do anything...
Listen to me...

912
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:45,589
lt was she...

913
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:48,721
Leave me...
Listen to me...

914
01:52:49,062 --> 01:52:53,123
Listen to me... l didn't do
anything. - Don't talk

915
01:52:55,135 --> 01:52:59,834
Nakulan, leave him... Go
and see Ganga. Go...

916
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,702
l didn't do anything.
She only...

917
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,570
l know, don't worry...
Come...

918
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:38,877
l had thought of telling you
earlier, there are a lot of things.

919
01:53:39,112 --> 01:53:45,073
...you need to know. You have to
be very patient and listen to me.

920
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:55,086
The psychic patient who is trying
to kill Alli, set Ganga's sari ...

921
01:53:55,862 --> 01:54:05,669
...on fire is not Sreedevi... That
patient is your wife Ganga.

922
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:11,172
The day l came here, l knew that
there was nothing wrong with...

923
01:54:11,544 --> 01:54:18,006
...Sreedevi. When her illness
was being projected, the real...

924
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:20,445
...patient was being hidden

925
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:23,952
l could not guess as to who it
was.

926
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:28,886
Under those circumstances, l
visited the Southern room with...

927
01:54:29,262 --> 01:54:37,670
...Ganga. There l received a
psychic vibration from her.

928
01:54:38,004 --> 01:54:42,134
Painfully, l realised that the
patient, l was looking out for...

929
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:47,368
...in Maadampally was Ganga.

930
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:54,676
From where and when did this
illness come to Ganga?

931
01:54:55,121 --> 01:54:59,319
To test if it was as
a result of jealousy...

932
01:54:59,492 --> 01:55:06,660
...l asked you to take Sreedevi to
the temple.

933
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:10,669
But Ganga was not at all
affected by it.

934
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:16,170
Then l tried to instigate her by
telling her Nagavalli's tale.

935
01:55:17,243 --> 01:55:20,269
When l disagreed with her about
Nagavalli's anklets,she retaliated

936
01:55:20,813 --> 01:55:23,907
...strongly. l was unusually
surprised to see the signs of her

937
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:31,682
...illness in her eyes strangely
glowing in her eyes.

938
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:35,825
At that moment. she has changed
like Nagavalli.

939
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:41,192
At sometimes, Ganga was
changing as Nagavalli.

940
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:46,632
We hear in the newspapers that
a eleven year old Muslim girl

941
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,034
..behaves like a twenty-one year
old brahmin woman and recites

942
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:56,273
...slokas. Old timers will say
that a spirit has entered her.

943
01:55:56,549 --> 01:55:59,882
ln psychiatry, split personality,
dual personality are the minor...

944
01:56:00,086 --> 01:56:08,084
...illness which later leads to
this kind of mental illness.

945
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:11,329
lf she is not treated now the
other person in her, Nagavalli...

946
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:17,902
...will surface. ln this state of
illness, she has great strength.

947
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:22,503
The woman Nagavalli, who
wakes up next to you...

948
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:28,714
... at night knows how deep
asleep you are and ...

949
01:56:28,881 --> 01:56:33,875
...when you will wake up. During
the day she is with you and ...

950
01:56:34,187 --> 01:56:37,350
...without your knowledge burns
up things.

951
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,322
At night, she who has...

952
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:42,686
...never learnt to dance sings
Tamil songs and dances.

953
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:49,533
But she is not aware, that she
is doing all this.

954
01:56:50,903 --> 01:56:57,934
To know the depth of her illness
l went to the southern room.

955
01:56:58,444 --> 01:57:00,412
There l spoke to her as her
psychic self.

956
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:05,646
The language was Tamil. There it
started with Neurosis and went..

957
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:15,827
...on to become Psychosis. She
was in a very murderous state.

958
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:21,664
To do something, l had to know
about her childhood.

959
01:57:22,468 --> 01:57:25,801
l & Chandu went to the village
of Yevur where she had spent...

960
01:57:26,005 --> 01:57:33,002
...her childhood. There she had
heard old stories from her...

961
01:57:33,246 --> 01:57:41,585
...grandma, as a little girl. At
the age of three, her parents...

962
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:46,291
...left her with her grandmother
and went to pursue their jobs in

963
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:55,093
...Kolkata. She would sit everyday
on the door-step waiting for...

964
01:57:55,301 --> 01:57:59,067
...her parents. But they never
came.

965
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:04,169
The year she was in Class ten, it
was predicted that she would...

966
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:06,004
...get a merit and top the exams.

967
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:09,943
Then she received a letter from
her parents.

968
01:58:10,116 --> 01:58:14,450
They were going to get her
admitted to a good ...

969
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:18,990
...college in Kolkata. She was
shattered.

970
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:23,221
She stopped studying and would
pace restlessly up and down.

971
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:27,559
The sister recalled how on the
day of her first exam, she tore...

972
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:35,502
...her paper and threw it and ran
like a mad woman.

973
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:41,808
That was the first instance of
psychotic behavior.

974
01:58:43,149 --> 01:58:47,108
She sat with her grandmother
when her parents came to take...

975
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:53,154
...her away. They took her to
Kolkata where she may have...

976
01:58:53,759 --> 01:59:03,725
...been treated by a doctor. She
soon forgot her past and ...

977
01:59:04,403 --> 01:59:12,333
...became a part of Kolkata city.
Yet, there was a possibility of...

978
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:15,978
...another psychic disorder hidden
in her.

979
01:59:17,517 --> 01:59:23,945
Then she got married. From your
mother she heard of this village..

980
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:35,458
...and its tales. When she came
here with you, she heard all the

981
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:42,174
...superstitious stories here. At
first she sympathised and then...

982
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:46,539
...empathised with the character
of Nagavalli.

983
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:53,675
Her personality took the form of
Nagavalli.

984
01:59:54,987 --> 02:00:05,192
She was completely changing into
Nagavalli mentally.

985
02:00:05,464 --> 02:00:07,557
That has to be treated.

986
02:00:08,935 --> 02:00:15,465
For that, she should never know
that she is a patient.

987
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,943
Besides the three of us there is
one other person who knows...

988
02:00:22,248 --> 02:00:23,715
...of all this, which is Sreedevi.

989
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:28,584
Once when Ganga's illness
was threatened to be...

990
02:00:28,788 --> 02:00:33,487
...revealed, l put Sreedevi in the
room and locked it.

991
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:39,662
Then when l requested her, she
agreed to act like a mad woman...

992
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:44,632
...for you and your wife's sake
a thousand times, if needed.

993
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:57,883
Just open this door. Who has
locked it?

994
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:11,162
This is the dress l had taken off
after coming from the temple.

995
02:01:11,597 --> 02:01:15,089
lt's all torn and tattered.

996
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:18,260
lt must have been Sreedevi.

997
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:20,098
Who else but her?

998
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:21,968
How was the dance program
yesterday?

999
02:01:22,174 --> 02:01:24,938
l didn't see all of it. l can't
recollect when l felt sleepy and

1000
02:01:25,244 --> 02:01:29,510
...came back home. Why, it's
Mahadevan  When did you come?

1001
02:01:29,715 --> 02:01:30,807
Some time back.

1002
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:34,077
That's fine. How come you didn't
tell me, Nakulettan?

1003
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:36,651
Wait, l'll get some coffee.

1004
02:01:54,006 --> 02:01:59,308
What's this, what's all this?
What are you doing?

1005
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:01,908
Cool down...

1006
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:10,917
Come here for a minute.

1007
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:19,026
The house you are currently
staying at, was once the ...

1008
02:02:19,365 --> 02:02:22,198
...house in which Ramanathan,
the dancer stayed.

1009
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:27,735
When the dormant character in
Ganga, Nagavalli is awakened,...

1010
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:33,536
...you assume the place of
Ramanathan for her.

1011
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:38,545
Nakulan becomes the cruel
Noble-man.

1012
02:02:41,287 --> 02:02:45,485
The rape-incident which you saw
last night, was the drama

1013
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:52,095
..enacted by the patient in Ganga.
lt was meant to look as if ...

1014
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:57,200
...you were trying to rape Ganga, and
your marriage with Alli would...

1015
02:02:57,403 --> 02:03:02,705
...not be possible. She would then
get you, that is Ramanathan back

1016
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:06,402
This is how all the unnatural
things that have happened...

1017
02:03:06,545 --> 02:03:09,070
...and are still happening have a
reason and meaning.

1018
02:03:10,549 --> 02:03:13,382
All these are the strong codes
which the patient in Ganga...

1019
02:03:13,586 --> 02:03:21,550
...has picked up, but these
codes will never leave Ganga.

1020
02:03:22,094 --> 02:03:23,425
What does it mean?

1021
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:30,333
Tonight Ganga's personality will
change to that of Nagavalli's ...

1022
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:33,732
...forever, that means as a total
mad person.

1023
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:37,171
Ganga will never be able to
come back.

1024
02:03:37,777 --> 02:03:41,304
To come back from that illness
there are just two ways.

1025
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:47,416
Nakulan will be killed any minute,
and Ganga will commit suicide.

1026
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:52,850
l want to save Nakulan atleast.
-And Ganga?

1027
02:03:52,992 --> 02:03:56,553
lf l have to save Ganga, l'll
have to sacrifice Nakulan.

1028
02:03:59,398 --> 02:04:01,628
lf l save Nakulan, Ganga will
commit suicide.

1029
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:05,362
One death cannot be avoided.

1030
02:04:07,706 --> 02:04:12,666
We'll have to erase at least one
of them from our memory.

1031
02:04:14,346 --> 02:04:17,008
Unless some miracle occurs.

1032
02:04:26,559 --> 02:04:28,686
Greetings
-Greetings...

1033
02:04:30,162 --> 02:04:35,464
Come, l wanted to tell you a
very important matter.

1034
02:04:35,768 --> 02:04:38,601
l was feeling very restless, till
l could tell you.

1035
02:04:38,871 --> 02:04:41,339
Let's sit to the northern side.

1036
02:04:58,023 --> 02:05:02,960
Sit.- So how has the festival in
the family temple progressed?

1037
02:05:03,162 --> 02:05:06,063
There have been no interruptions.
Everything has gone on well.

1038
02:05:06,298 --> 02:05:07,196
lt will get over tomorrow.

1039
02:05:07,466 --> 02:05:08,990
How about all the rites l have
asked you to do?

1040
02:05:09,201 --> 02:05:10,600
All those have been done
properly.

1041
02:05:10,769 --> 02:05:14,466
That's very good.l happened to
consider your daughter's ...

1042
02:05:14,673 --> 02:05:17,904
...horoscope in detail. There is a
certain problem there.

1043
02:05:18,477 --> 02:05:20,138
She might have some mental
worries.

1044
02:05:21,046 --> 02:05:29,784
When l saw the position of the
ancestral house l was shocked.

1045
02:05:30,055 --> 02:05:33,718
There is a great possibility of a
untimely death here.

1046
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:37,985
lt's not just that, in fact it has
already occurred.

1047
02:05:39,265 --> 02:05:44,931
You don't panic. By God's grace
lt might pass off peacefully.

1048
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:54,307
l feel, l have seen you
somewhere.

1049
02:05:54,947 --> 02:05:59,543
l can't recollect. Who's this?
- He is...

1050
02:06:00,419 --> 02:06:11,091
l've forgotten where... l can't get
it... Tetroit... or...

1051
02:06:11,497 --> 02:06:16,093
You have forgotten, head priest.
We met in America.

1052
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:30,639
Sunny... why lt's you
You cheated me.

1053
02:06:31,183 --> 02:06:37,588
How can l forget you    l never
imagined, l'd see you here.

1054
02:06:38,357 --> 02:06:41,884
lt's a great surprise, you rascal.
You've put on weight.

1055
02:06:46,332 --> 02:06:48,994
When he was around why did
you come and meet me with ...

1056
02:06:49,368 --> 02:06:54,533
...your daughter's problems. l
think, you don't know him well.

1057
02:06:54,873 --> 02:07:00,470
He is world famous. A wizard.
The famous psychiatry teacher...

1058
02:07:00,646 --> 02:07:04,605
Bradley was his Professor. When
he wanted to declare a paper ...

1059
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:10,147
...on Para-psychology he invited
me to America, at Delhi.

1060
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:16,325
He was Bradley's junior then. Did
you know, two world famous ...

1061
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:20,893
...thesis on modern Psychology
have been written by him.

1062
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:25,637
There's something l want to
speak to you in private.

1063
02:07:25,871 --> 02:07:29,329
Okay, l'll be here today.
We will only talk

1064
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:32,672
Keep two chairs outside.

1065
02:07:57,903 --> 02:08:00,599
l have heard of many states of
Psychosis, but it's the first time

1066
02:08:00,806 --> 02:08:03,036
...l am hearing something this
serious.

1067
02:08:03,842 --> 02:08:08,006
So this girl's husband is still
living with her. - Yes

1068
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:13,807
Since he is your close friend
can't you tell him to stay away.

1069
02:08:14,153 --> 02:08:18,613
l assume that Ganga will be in
her senses for another 20 hours.

1070
02:08:20,426 --> 02:08:22,894
At least let them be together till
then.

1071
02:08:23,128 --> 02:08:27,792
What are you intending? You tell
him everything clearly.

1072
02:08:28,067 --> 02:08:29,295
Let him save himself.

1073
02:08:30,602 --> 02:08:34,436
No, there are still some more
hours.

1074
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:40,942
From my experience and love for
you, let me tell you that it's incurable.

1075
02:08:43,382 --> 02:08:47,079
l consider you as one of my
teachers who have studied the...

1076
02:08:47,286 --> 02:08:55,853
...human mind. But l have to
surpass all that l have learnt.

1077
02:08:56,061 --> 02:09:00,555
l will travel the paths not tried
by any other psychiatrist.

1078
02:09:00,866 --> 02:09:04,427
For the sake of Nakulan and his
wife.

1079
02:09:04,903 --> 02:09:07,804
l am going to break all
conventional concepts of psychiatry

1080
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:19,583
All right. l won't discourage you.
l am fully satisfied. You try.

1081
02:09:19,852 --> 02:09:21,251
What is the way?

1082
02:09:23,889 --> 02:09:25,754
There are many ways to
treating Ganga.

1083
02:09:26,291 --> 02:09:30,694
They will all lead to the regular
outcome. l am not needed for it.

1084
02:09:32,498 --> 02:09:37,492
Ganga has heard stories
of ghosts in her childhood.

1085
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:41,335
There are stains of that which l
have to wipe out.

1086
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:46,943
l need your help for that. Then
the atmosphere that you will...

1087
02:09:47,179 --> 02:09:51,980
...create for me. A world of
rituals.

1088
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:55,478
You be assured. l'll back you.

1089
02:09:56,522 --> 02:10:01,357
l have to start from a very
dangerous time frame.

1090
02:10:02,995 --> 02:10:06,954
Don't oppose me. Before tonight
Ganga will realise, she is sick.

1091
02:10:09,034 --> 02:10:11,264
l am going to let her know it
now.

1092
02:10:15,007 --> 02:10:21,378
You are afraid. l know. After
that she won't live for long.

1093
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:29,182
She might die. But l've decided
that she should know that ...

1094
02:10:29,288 --> 02:10:33,088
...she is a sick person through
her husband.

1095
02:10:34,693 --> 02:10:40,928
lf she survives that moment, l
will have a path to follow.

1096
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:50,039
ln front of me. l can follow that
path. You pray for me. Bless me.

1097
02:10:55,781 --> 02:10:59,512
Ganga is getting ready to buy
ornaments for Alli.

1098
02:11:00,052 --> 02:11:03,886
You have to go and tell her not
to go.

1099
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:07,292
l have never stopped her from
anything till today.

1100
02:11:07,626 --> 02:11:10,652
Then you must, today. Without
any pity, tell her not to go.

1101
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:14,260
Even if she resists you don't
give in.

1102
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,460
lf you notice any unnatural
change in her, don't panic.

1103
02:11:21,406 --> 02:11:30,314
You must use all your love and
call her back. Go, now. Go...

1104
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:46,122
Where are you going?

1105
02:11:47,799 --> 02:11:51,701
Didn't l tell you, we are going to
get ornaments for Alli's marriage

1106
02:11:53,071 --> 02:11:59,408
You don't go now.
-l shouldn't go.- No.

1107
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:03,943
l had told you in the morning.
Then why this sudden change...

1108
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:06,313
...of mind.
-You don't go now, Ganga.

1109
02:12:09,154 --> 02:12:12,123
So, what if l too went to get
ornaments for Alli?

1110
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:14,019
l told you that
you should not go.

1111
02:12:14,493 --> 02:12:17,758
Why should l not go?
-Don't go.

1112
02:12:24,303 --> 02:12:30,139
Won't you allow me  ...
Won't you allow me  ...

1113
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,776
So you won't let me go anywhere
from here.

1114
02:12:40,385 --> 02:12:45,084
You rogue, How dare you come
and stand before me even now?

1115
02:12:48,827 --> 02:12:54,424
Today is Durgashtami. l will kill
you and drink your blood & dance

1116
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,257
Ganga...

1117
02:13:27,032 --> 02:13:32,334
What did l just say? What did i
say? What did l say...

1118
02:13:32,571 --> 02:13:38,168
No, nothing... you said nothing.
-No, l said something

1119
02:13:38,377 --> 02:13:41,039
What's wrong with me? What's
happened to me?

1120
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:43,372
There's nothing wrong with you.

1121
02:13:43,582 --> 02:13:49,214
No, there is. There is something
wrong with me.

1122
02:13:52,157 --> 02:13:55,615
There's nothing wrong with you,
you don't cry.

1123
02:14:01,166 --> 02:14:02,724
Please don't hate me...

1124
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:29,987
You don't hate me...- Never,
ever, my love...

1125
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:41,096
What do you want?

1126
02:14:41,773 --> 02:14:43,604
Can l sleep?

1127
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:57,479
Sunny, what are you planning to
do to my Ganga?

1128
02:14:57,722 --> 02:15:01,385
Are you placing her in the hands
of those Tantrics?

1129
02:15:01,726 --> 02:15:03,819
l won't let you.
l will never allow that.

1130
02:15:03,995 --> 02:15:05,019
You listen to me.

1131
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:11,829
No. You don't speak a word.
l saw her. l will take her.

1132
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:15,133
Somewhere else. l won't give her
in your hands.

1133
02:15:15,874 --> 02:15:17,466
Listen to me.

1134
02:15:17,742 --> 02:15:20,267
You don't say anything. lt's not
possible.

1135
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:21,776
Listen to me.

1136
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:28,579
No, leave me. Leave me, l say.
She doesn't need your treatment.

1137
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:34,823
Go,go wherever you want to. But
before you go, let me tell you.

1138
02:15:34,993 --> 02:15:39,953
No psychiatrist in this world can
give her back to you.

1139
02:15:42,367 --> 02:15:45,268
l can also do what any
psychiatrist can.

1140
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:48,038
l can even give you a new
Ganga.

1141
02:15:48,306 --> 02:15:50,706
But she will be just a stone
image of your Ganga.

1142
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:52,877
ls that enough for you?

1143
02:15:55,313 --> 02:16:02,719
l want to give you back Ganga
as we know her, full of life.

1144
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:06,722
But for that you have to give me
one more night, please.

1145
02:16:06,892 --> 02:16:08,689
Just this one night, please.

1146
02:16:10,462 --> 02:16:16,731
You take as many nights as you
please. l just want her back.

1147
02:16:18,403 --> 02:16:22,567
l am going to do an experiment.
Ganga might trouble you.

1148
02:16:22,974 --> 02:16:29,004
She might attack you, scratch
you, try to kill you.

1149
02:16:29,247 --> 02:16:32,910
She might make permanent
wounds in your heart.

1150
02:16:35,954 --> 02:16:39,583
Let anything happen to me. Let
her do anything to me.

1151
02:16:40,125 --> 02:16:44,789
lf she will kill me, let her. But
you must give her back to me.

1152
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:48,631
Give her back, Sunny
-l'll give you... l'll give you...

1153
02:17:27,539 --> 02:17:31,805
Nagavalli that is Ganga has to be
taken to that ritual site.

1154
02:17:34,346 --> 02:17:36,314
Only Mahadevan can do that.

1155
02:18:53,058 --> 02:18:55,424
Come once and see me...

1156
02:18:57,929 --> 02:19:00,056
Come once and see me...

1157
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:05,101
Did you come once to see me?

1158
02:19:05,503 --> 02:19:10,600
Did you understand my mind and
remove my sorrow?

1159
02:19:10,875 --> 02:19:22,343
Did you embrace me with love,
my beloved...

1160
02:19:22,787 --> 02:19:27,520
l take your name every day.

1161
02:19:27,759 --> 02:19:32,719
Even though l know your heart,
l search for you.

1162
02:19:32,864 --> 02:19:35,958
Did you come and see me once?

1163
02:19:36,468 --> 02:19:40,427
Did you come and see me once?

1164
02:20:33,091 --> 02:20:37,926
The girl in your heart is dancing

1165
02:20:38,096 --> 02:20:43,124
My lotus eyes are dancing
in my youth.

1166
02:20:43,435 --> 02:20:47,337
My curse has grown into
the fiery love.

1167
02:20:47,639 --> 02:20:53,202
Many years of my penance
has grown into fire of anger.

1168
02:20:53,545 --> 02:20:57,504
l got up... to break all
the obstacles in my way.

1169
02:20:58,049 --> 02:21:03,146
When this heart is waiting for
you for ages...

1170
02:21:03,388 --> 02:21:06,414
...Can't you come and see me
once?

1171
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:10,856
Did you come and see me once?

1172
02:21:28,046 --> 02:21:30,640
Did you come and see me once?

1173
02:21:37,021 --> 02:21:39,956
Did you recognize my mind?

1174
02:24:23,287 --> 02:24:25,312
l won't leave you. Let me go.
Leave me.

1175
02:24:30,161 --> 02:24:35,531
l want to kill him. Leave me.
You cruel man

1176
02:24:38,036 --> 02:24:44,669
Leave me...
Let me go, l want to kill him.

1177
02:24:45,043 --> 02:24:46,067
Leave me...

1178
02:24:58,589 --> 02:25:01,023
Who is he?
-l won't say.

1179
02:25:01,893 --> 02:25:04,760
Who are you?
-l won't say.

1180
02:25:06,497 --> 02:25:08,465
Won't you say it?
-l won't say.

1181
02:25:13,705 --> 02:25:14,729
l am Nagavalli.

1182
02:25:15,707 --> 02:25:19,268
Sit there. -No..
-Go sit on the seat.

1183
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:27,208
Sit down there.

1184
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:37,428
Why have you come?

1185
02:25:40,431 --> 02:25:42,365
To kill.
-Whom?

1186
02:25:44,836 --> 02:25:46,497
To kill him.

1187
02:25:50,374 --> 02:25:55,402
Today is Durgashtami. l want to
kill him and drink his blood.

1188
02:25:56,647 --> 02:25:58,774
l'll help you to kill him.

1189
02:26:01,052 --> 02:26:06,149
After you kill him and you are
avenged will you leave this body.

1190
02:26:07,058 --> 02:26:09,959
Yes...
-Promise?

1191
02:26:10,161 --> 02:26:13,096
Promise, promise...

1192
02:26:16,067 --> 02:26:17,227
Bring him here.

1193
02:26:53,137 --> 02:26:53,831
Leave me.

1194
02:27:20,565 --> 02:27:27,698
Leave me, Leave me, l am going
to kill you and drink your blood

1195
02:27:35,713 --> 02:27:40,707
Today is Durgashtami, l am going
to kill you, and drink your blood.

1196
02:27:41,185 --> 02:27:42,880
l am going to fulfill my revenge.

1197
02:27:49,227 --> 02:27:51,957
Leave me.
l have to kill him.

1198
02:27:55,132 --> 02:27:56,963
Here... kill him

1199
02:28:03,741 --> 02:28:04,264
Leave me.

1200
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:10,830
You are hearing my voice in this
subconscious mind.

1201
02:29:11,876 --> 02:29:14,970
The mind you can hear is yours,
Ganga.

1202
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:21,074
You are Ganga.
You are Ganga.

1203
02:29:22,286 --> 02:29:27,087
ln three seconds, you will return
to your conscious mind.

1204
02:29:27,758 --> 02:29:29,282
Relax...

1205
02:29:34,131 --> 02:29:35,723
Tell me, who are you?

1206
02:29:38,235 --> 02:29:39,327
Tell me properly.

1207
02:29:39,904 --> 02:29:44,238
l am Ganga.
-Tell me again.

1208
02:29:45,543 --> 02:29:49,741
You are now very happy.
Very, very happy.

1209
02:29:50,614 --> 02:29:55,813
Yes...-You have to realise that
now you are free of your illness.

1210
02:29:56,620 --> 02:30:02,354
l understand. You are now going
to wake up. Carefully wake up.

1211
02:30:19,343 --> 02:30:20,367
Do you know who we all are?

1212
02:30:20,978 --> 02:30:22,536
Why do you ask me that, Sunny?

1213
02:30:22,713 --> 02:30:25,546
You had an illness, a wonderful
illness.

1214
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:28,118
l have pulled it out from its
roots.

1215
02:30:28,519 --> 02:30:32,785
You will never again have it.
That's my word.

1216
02:30:33,090 --> 02:30:38,619
l know, l trust you.
Thank you, Sunny.

1217
02:30:40,664 --> 02:30:43,064
You might want to know all
that happened.

1218
02:30:43,267 --> 02:30:50,105
ln one of your private moments
when the two of you are alone...

1219
02:30:50,441 --> 02:30:55,538
...Nakulan will tell you
all like a story.

1220
02:30:55,846 --> 02:30:58,246
For a Ganga who likes hearing
stories.

1221
02:30:58,883 --> 02:31:02,148
He need not tell me. l know it
all.

1222
02:31:02,686 --> 02:31:08,022
l have a lot of people to thank
like sister Sreedevi, but...

1223
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:13,995
...most of all my Nakulettan whom
l can never repay even if l take...

1224
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:18,095
...many births for loving
me so much

1225
02:31:19,703 --> 02:31:26,302
Did you hear this Ganga you
loved and who loves you a lot...

1226
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:32,073
...and so full of life. l am giving
her back to you. Take her.

1227
02:31:32,416 --> 02:31:33,883
Catch her...

1228
02:31:36,287 --> 02:31:40,383
You two are fortunate. No other
couple in this world have ...

1229
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:44,550
...understood each other in so
much depth. This is the truth.

1230
02:31:44,728 --> 02:31:46,662
Now you can go to the Southern
room as much as you want...

1231
02:31:46,964 --> 02:31:54,132
...or see anything. l still have
some work left.-What is it?

1232
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:12,946
lt's difficult to stay with a
mad man.

1233
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:16,648
lt's even more difficult to live
with one who treats madness.

1234
02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:21,397
lf you are ready to bear the
trouble, shall l send my mother here.

1235
02:32:27,938 --> 02:32:32,102
We Christians don't have any
problems with horoscopes.

1236
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:38,544
Listen, l'll send mother...

1237
02:32:42,953 --> 02:32:43,920
Where are you all going?

1238
02:32:44,121 --> 02:32:51,027
l want to change as fast as
possible for his sake.

1239
02:32:51,295 --> 02:32:54,128
For that Kolkata is more suitable.
So we are going now.

1240
02:32:54,331 --> 02:32:55,491
Even l want to come.

1241
02:32:55,699 --> 02:32:58,896
You better come fast.

1242
02:33:04,208 --> 02:33:05,402
Chandu, this one too.

1243
02:33:11,048 --> 02:33:11,912
See you, Uncle.

1244
02:33:12,683 --> 02:33:15,516
When will the master return,
l wonder?

1245
02:33:16,053 --> 02:33:18,954
Don't be so restless. The tamil
lady is now gone.

1246
02:33:19,123 --> 02:33:21,284
The old noble-man is still
around. Be careful.

1247
02:33:21,425 --> 02:33:22,949
Now there's nothing to fear.

1248
02:33:23,127 --> 02:33:26,790
Even if the noble-man stays here
permanently we are happy.

1249
02:33:31,302 --> 02:33:32,166
Vessel...

1250
02:33:41,946 --> 02:33:46,212
How are you now. No more
jumping on water? Let me see.

1251
02:33:50,621 --> 02:33:52,054
Put out your tongue.

1252
02:33:53,057 --> 02:33:57,460
Oh  it was this. l'll fix it.
The problem was here.

1253
02:34:00,965 --> 02:34:03,456
l felt as if a bird flew from
here.

1254
02:34:03,667 --> 02:34:06,192
Now you can step on water.

1255
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:08,631
And how about a bath?
-Yes, you can take bath.

1256
02:34:08,839 --> 02:34:11,239
Then there is no problem with
me now.-No.

1257
02:34:11,442 --> 02:34:12,773
That means the illness is now
gone.

1258
02:34:12,876 --> 02:34:14,969
lt wasn't an illness.
Just a state of mind.

1259
02:34:15,145 --> 02:34:18,410
We call it ''lmacus canofia
Tagadi''.

1260
02:34:18,616 --> 02:34:20,777
Oh, so that's what it was. l
knew that.

1261
02:34:20,985 --> 02:34:22,213
Okay, see you then.
-Ok..

1262
02:34:25,522 --> 02:34:27,217
Okay, bye.

1263
02:34:34,965 --> 02:34:43,065
No, don't. l like something. l've
told that to a person l like here.

1264
02:34:43,774 --> 02:34:48,734
When you know of it, you must
agree and bless me... Bye.

1265
02:34:59,623 --> 02:35:07,325
Just stop. Stop ... So did
Sreedevi's madness go away.

1266
02:35:07,631 --> 02:35:11,465
Actually it was not Sreedevi who
was mad.-Then who?

1267
02:35:32,022 --> 02:35:41,192
When hopefully you stand
at the doorstep...

1268
02:35:42,433 --> 02:35:47,735
The branch of the mango tree is
full of blooms...

1269
02:35:47,938 --> 02:35:57,540
My heart's mango tree branch
is blossoming
