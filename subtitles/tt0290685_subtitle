1
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:26,617
Priya...

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,489
Priya...

3
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,435
I have told you many times not
to shout my name like this.

4
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,840
Your name. Your name is
the voice of my soul.

5
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,847
Even if my body dies, my soul
will still be around you.

6
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,322
I have seen many guys like you.

7
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,123
You must have surely seen...

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,523
...but definitely not
someone like me.

9
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,720
And I don't want to see also.
I hate your face.

10
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:12,067
It's possible. You might
hate my face...

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,263
...but definitely not
my love for you.

12
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,076
Priya, just consider me once...

13
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,078
...just tell me once
that you love me...

14
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,808
...and take my life in return.

15
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,414
Oh! So you can even sacrifice
your life for me.

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,556
Challenge me.

17
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,623
OK. Show me your dead body.

18
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:37,092
Sure. But just one thing...

19
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,561
...try to shed atleast
one tear in my memory.

20
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,691
One!! I will shed thousands of
them. But atleast die first.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,840
Sure. I am going. With
a memory in my heart.

22
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,312
With a complaint on my lips.

23
00:01:55,215 --> 00:02:02,383
Bye Bye. Sanjay...

24
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,787
What did you do Sanjay.
I was just kidding.

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,461
I always loved you and
will keep loving you.

26
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:22,539
Now I cannot live without you.
I am also coming to you.

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,745
Sanjay...

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,080
Sanjay.
- Priya.

29
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,093
Sanjay.
- Priya.

30
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,637
What happened? Why are you scared?

31
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,499
Did'nt you see death is going.

32
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,180
Death cannot do us any
harm now, Priya.

33
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,780
We both are in heaven and will
remain like this forever.

34
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,520
Really!
- Yes.

35
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:28,796
"Oh Priya... Oh Priya..."

36
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:58,825
"Oh Priya... Oh Priya..."

37
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:06,759
"Oh Priya... Oh Priya..."

38
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,245
You son of a torturer, what
wrong did I do to you?

39
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,060
Oh man, what a romantic
dream I was seeing...

40
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:43,066
...what a beautiful girl,
what beautiful eyes...

41
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:49,072
...smiling flowers,
divine happiness...

42
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:59,083
...an ocean of souls. Our eyes
were just about to speak...

43
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:04,019
...our bodies were just
about to meet...

44
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:11,562
...and you dear Hanuman
Singh just go to hell!

45
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:18,036
You fool. The great poets have
said for friends like you...

46
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,035
..."If you have friends like these...

47
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,436
...then where is the
need for enemies".

48
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,701
Oh! I see.
- Yes.

49
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,374
So you consider me your enemy.

50
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,707
So then get ready to
welcome your friends.

51
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,118
What do you mean?

52
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,050
I mean, number 1
- Motumal mechanic...

53
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,053
...your jeep's family doctor.

54
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,057
Number 2
- This area's biggest criminal...

55
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,194
...Lala Bajrang Singh.

56
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,056
Oh Hanuman Singh, I am dead.

57
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,390
Huh! Dead!

58
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,466
What happened to the money those
girls were going to give?

59
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,601
They will give today.

60
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,067
But Motumal is not going
to understand that today.

61
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,401
Now you run away dear, your father
in law must be on his way.

62
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:04,008
Dear Hanuman Singh, you
care so much for me.

63
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,150
That is true.

64
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,013
An orphan like me got
a friend like you.

65
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,086
You are everything to me, my friend.

66
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:15,490
My mother, my father, brother,
sister, wife.

67
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,686
Wife!! No! No! No! What do
you mean? Never, Never.

68
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,360
What have you not done
for me till today?

69
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,567
Whatever I asked, you
gave me happily.

70
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,038
And today also I believe that
you will not disappoint me...

71
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,573
...if I ask anything from you.

72
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:34,179
Yeah! I got it. No! No! No!

73
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,042
I am not going to give
you a single penny.

74
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,183
You fool, I am not talking
about money.

75
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,375
Then what are you talking about?

76
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,042
I am talking about
my sleeping suit...

77
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,188
...which I will remove and you
will give it in the laundry.

78
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,447
I will not give it!

79
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,525
You won't!
- No! - You won't! - No!

80
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,058
You won't!
- No! - You won't! - Uncle...

81
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,526
What uncle? Uncle!!!

82
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,724
Run! Run! Run! In the bathroom.

83
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,463
Not you idiot.

84
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,079
Uncle! Uncle!

85
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,214
Hanuman brother, uncle is not here.

86
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,011
I just bought the things required
for prayers for uncle.

87
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,415
You! Don't do uncle... uncle.
You scared me.

88
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,146
You think I am scared of uncle?

89
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,018
Go and clear my bed.

90
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,428
Hey, has uncle gone?

91
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,224
My uncle has not come only.

92
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,367
Now your fat Motumal
is going to come.

93
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,434
Leave immediately or else
you will be beaten up.

94
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,093
I am leaving buddy. Just
help me wear my coat.

95
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,238
So I am your servant!

96
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,373
No, you are my best friend.

97
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,507
Just give my suit
in the laundry, ok.

98
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,700
No, I won't.

99
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,319
Sanjay Tourist Guide!

100
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,184
Where will he go?

101
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,386
We won't leave him without
taking our money.

102
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,588
What does he think about us?

103
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,332
Where are you going?

104
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,474
Oh! Mr. Motumal. Greetings.

105
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,075
Money!!

106
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,210
Money!!

107
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,472
Oh! Mr. Body builder. You
are also here. Greetings.

108
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,615
Money!!

109
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,750
Money!! Money!!

110
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,086
The weather is really good today.

111
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,085
But the day is very bad today.

112
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,622
If I don't get the money today,
then this jeep is gone.

113
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,089
Understand!

114
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,750
The jeep will be gone!
- Yes.

115
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,757
But how will the jeep go.
Its raining money.

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,292
Where?

117
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,767
Water rains outside, money
rains inside. Come.

118
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,430
Let's Go.

119
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,581
This time the season is very good.

120
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,120
The tourists have been
spending very well.

121
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,520
Never before brother. Come sit.

122
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,183
Please sit sir.

123
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,795
Gagan! I'll be right back.

124
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:10,261
Gagan! Give the clothes
in the laundry urgently.

125
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,463
What a body!

126
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,472
Boss, eat these pure sweets.

127
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,076
My friend Hanuman Singh
got engaged...

128
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,509
...I am distributing sweets
amongst my friends.

129
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,615
I don't want any sweets.
Give me my money.

130
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,810
I am giving you money also,
boss. I'll be right back.

131
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,556
Hanuman! Hanuman!
- What happened?

132
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,493
Look, our boss has come.
Just clear his bill.

133
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,632
Full three hundred and fifty rupees.

134
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,167
This donkey has not yet gone.

135
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,632
He is worried about
his sleeping suit.

136
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,574
I told you to go. Go!
Go! Go from here.

137
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,107
I will give it. I will give
it. I will give it.

138
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,108
Just go for the sake of God.

139
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,510
Boss, you heard. He says he will
give it. Give it! Give it!

140
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,649
He will give it.

141
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,119
It seems this season has been
very good for both of you.

142
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,051
Never before brother!

143
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,451
You are earning.
- Yes.

144
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,057
Engagement is also done.

145
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,193
Yes boss.

146
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,452
Bands will also play.

147
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,061
Boss, of course the bands
do play in marriages...

148
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,527
...and not in funerals, right!

149
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,326
So you also get married now.

150
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,468
Boss!
- Yes.

151
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,535
Boss!
- Yes.

152
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,605
You are like god boss.
Give me your blessings.

153
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,072
I'll take your leave now. Your
daughter in law is waiting.

154
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,542
Boss, you collect money from here,
I'll go and earn mine.

155
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,807
Sure. God bless you!

156
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,555
This guy is very good.

157
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,564
Congratulations! Congratulations!

158
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,700
Congratulations?

159
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,101
Congratulations! Congratulations!

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,298
Very nice sweets. Your wife will
also be very sweet like this.

161
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,442
Wife! Whose wife?

162
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,101
You got engaged, right?

163
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,773
Engagement? Mine? With. Whom?

164
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,587
He bluffed you again.

165
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,780
Money?
- Money! Which money?

166
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,455
My money.

167
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,186
Money. Oh yes I'll give it to you.

168
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:22,064
Catch him.

169
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,611
Is this the time to come?
It's 9:30 now. Tell us.

170
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,541
Why are you quiet? Why are
you not answering us?

171
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,739
Oh madam, I will only answer
when there is a question.

172
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,414
Where is my question.
- Question!

173
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,077
You don't understand.
He is asking for Priya.

174
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,282
Very good. Intelligence
should be like this.

175
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,484
Very good and sandals
should be like this.

176
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,254
Not yours, hers.

177
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,419
Do you want to eat sandals?

178
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,623
Will you give me?

179
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,097
Sure. Why not.

180
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,257
Promise?
- Promise.

181
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,494
I told you, you will
get the answer...

182
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,638
...as soon as the question arrives.

183
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,204
What question? What answer?

184
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,431
I mean you are the question
and I am the answer.

185
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,575
What?

186
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,437
No. I am the question and
you are the answer. - What?

187
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,242
Let's run fast, the
enemies are here.

188
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,318
The enemies are here. Let's go fast.

189
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,291
See, he is running. Catch him,
he should not escape.

190
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,455
Oh! He is gone. Come fast. Come sit.

191
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,733
I'll show you now. You dupe.

192
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,587
Drive fast.

193
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,455
Why don't you drive slow?

194
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,066
Drive fast. He should not escape.

195
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,258
Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the
car. - Oh! Where is he gone?

196
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,459
He has escaped again.

197
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,603
Where has he gone Vachan Singh?

198
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,465
Stop! Stop!

199
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,533
Come on girls, let's go.

200
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,269
Listen to me atleast, madam.

201
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,436
Our lives are precious to us.

202
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,411
Madam, my life is also
dependent on you.

203
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,244
Didn't you see how that fat
guy was running behind me?

204
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,444
But why was he behind
you? For what?

205
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,553
Just like that as if he
is my father in law.

206
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,689
What?

207
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,346
You mean your father in law!
- No!

208
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,492
Oh, so you are married?

209
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,217
No. No. Not at all. Not at all.

210
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,259
Then how is he your father in law?

211
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,424
He is not my father in law, madam,
but he wants to be.

212
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,194
He wants to marry his black
fat girl to me forcefully.

213
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,429
Oh! Then you just refuse him.

214
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,698
Refuse! You don't know,
he is a big gangster.

215
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,173
He has taken my approval
by showing me a knife.

216
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,505
If I refuse than the knife will
definitely start working.

217
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,238
This is sheer injustice.

218
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,383
Of course it is. What can
I do? I have no other way.

219
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,246
He should be beaten
with 100 sandals.

220
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,511
You are right. Perfectly right said.

221
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,245
He should be beaten with
sandals. 100 sandals.

222
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,413
But madam I am a poor man.

223
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,058
Now a days the government
has increased...

224
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,454
...the price of sandals. Where
will I get 100 sandals from?

225
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,222
But for how long will
I run like this?

226
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,526
How do I tell you, how poor I am?

227
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,259
Oh! Poor man!

228
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,338
Look. You don't lose hope.
After all we are with you.

229
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,407
You! You are with me?

230
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,510
Oh lord, thank you.

231
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,805
In today's mean world you are
with me! Thank you. Thank You.

232
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
Come.
- Come.

233
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,209
Listen. My reverse gears
are not working.

234
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,375
Will you all just push the jeep?

235
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,384
Ohhhhh...

236
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,522
Please, please.

237
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,487
Ok. Let's go.
- Thank you, thank you.

238
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:17,533
"You are so close to my heart,
I'll consider you mine."

239
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,196
Dear Hanuman Singh, I enjoyed
very much today.

240
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,036
Its seems the heart neither
belongs to me nor to you...

241
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,474
...it's just hers, hers, hers.

242
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,208
You fool. Has a snake bitten
you, look at me at least.

243
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,445
Ok. So boss is angry
about the 10 bucks.

244
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,716
You idiot, has it happened between
us for the first time?

245
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,055
Come on, just forget it and tell
me what did you tell that fatty...

246
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,720
...that he immediately
came behind me?

247
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:52,732
But because of him, my work
is done. Don't ask me.

248
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,466
Sometimes she was in my lap
and sometimes me in hers.

249
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,337
Never before brother!

250
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,375
And never before this brother!

251
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,176
Brother, what is this?
Who did this to you?

252
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,443
That fatty. Fatty.

253
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,486
Don't worry. I will take
revenge for this.

254
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,351
Revenge! Have you bought the money?

255
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,350
No man.

256
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,493
Then.

257
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,354
No.
- Why?

258
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,497
What do I tell you buddy?

259
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,024
Today again love stopped
me from speaking.

260
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,362
Today you have shut your mouth...

261
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,503
...tomorrow our shop will shut...

262
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,195
...when the fatty will
take the jeep away.

263
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,498
He will take the jeep away!!

264
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,366
Hanuman, that will not happen...

265
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,531
...not happen, not happen.

266
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,699
How will it not happen?

267
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,370
I will hide the jeep.

268
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,535
How will you hide the jeep?

269
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,045
Please don't leave me alone here...

270
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,444
...the fatty will hit me,
take me along with you.

271
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,212
I was thinking about you last night.

272
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,379
Really.

273
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,547
Yes.
- Me too.

274
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,487
Did you meet that gangster?

275
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,060
Yes. They were beating
my friend Hanuman...

276
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,390
...before I reached home.

277
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,532
What? - Yes. - Didn't you
tell them anything?

278
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,224
Of course. I ran behind them

279
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,459
Then?

280
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,399
Then what, they were in front
and I was behind them.

281
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,538
Then?

282
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,167
Then I took a reverse. I was in
front and they were behind.

283
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,332
What do you mean?

284
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,500
I mean there were a lot
of gangsters with them.

285
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,667
And you got scared and ran away.

286
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,004
Oh madam, if I wouldn't have
got scared and ran...

287
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,444
...then how would I have
met you all today?

288
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,176
Just let them meet me today,
I will show them.

289
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,412
I hope you meet them.

290
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,449
Wait.

291
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,182
The lord has heard your prayers.

292
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,521
Go. Go. Go.

293
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,190
Vachan Singh you also catch him.

294
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,469
Where are you running?

295
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,237
I will get the cops.

296
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,712
Catch him fast. Now he
wants to call the cops.

297
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,384
Vachan Singh run fast. Catch him.
He should not escape.

298
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,545
Run fast. Run fast. Good.

299
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,214
Now you will understand when
you will be hand cuffed.

300
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,451
Hand cuffs?

301
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,594
Why?

302
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,229
You don't feel ashamed harassing
a innocent man?

303
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,386
Ashamed?

304
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,532
Just go and jump from
this mountains...

305
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,667
...both father and daughter.
- Daughter!

306
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,268
Yes. With whom you want
to forcefully wed Sanjay.

307
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,496
But India is independent now, Ok.

308
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,640
I know that.

309
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,275
But what marriage? Which daughter?

310
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,535
You daughter.

311
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,272
I am 100 percent bachelor. I
am not even married till now.

312
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,475
What?

313
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,744
God promise.

314
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,290
What happened Priya? What
happened? What happened?

315
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,451
I told you all to hire a old guide.

316
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,317
Oh queen, hire a old guide when
you go on a pilgrimage.

317
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,720
How far is Darjeeling from here?

318
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,554
It's the same distance
as your in laws house.

319
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,386
Mine or yours.

320
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,258
I hope it was mine.

321
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,231
Beautiful face is also a problem.

322
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,270
Whoever sees it just cannot
take their eyes off it.

323
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,066
Just leave it. You are
taking it as a joke...

324
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,435
...and I am dying of hunger.

325
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,405
Oh he is here.

326
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,549
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

327
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,477
Let's go.

328
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,745
Come on girls.

329
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,287
"Just eat and drink, celebrate
the music of youth".

330
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,438
I said, you also have
something to eat.

331
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,767
Not at all. Why did you lie to me?

332
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,434
Just for you?

333
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,578
For us?

334
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,306
Not for everybody, just for you.
- For me?

335
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,110
Yes. When I met you I
had a strange feeling...

336
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,312
...then the jeep broke down,
my health started glowing...,

337
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,423
...the fatty worked hard,
I showed some strength...

338
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,059
...the fatty repaired the jeep
and asked for money...

339
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,561
...and I agreed for it,
all just for you.

340
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,699
Everything is just crap.

341
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,527
Just listen to me.

342
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,227
"Where are you going, come here,
don't refuse my heart...

343
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:30,480
I am telling you, if you
could just accept me...

344
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,413
...accept me, accept me"

345
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:41,420
"Where are you going, come here,
don't refuse my heart...

346
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:45,529
I am telling you, if you
could just accept me...

347
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,497
...accept me, accept me"

348
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:10,382
"My life is ending, and
you say it's your style".

349
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:18,553
"My life is ending, and
you say it's your style".

350
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:26,398
"You are a very innocent killer,
you are punishing me".

351
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:34,273
"You are a very innocent killer,
you are punishing me".

352
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:43,079
"Where are you going, come here,
don't refuse my heart...

353
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:48,090
I am telling you, if you
could just accept me...

354
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,491
...accept me, accept me"

355
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:18,247
"Don't break my heart, darling,
considering it a toy".

356
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:25,727
"Don't break my heart, darling,
considering it a toy".

357
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:33,733
"I am the tourist of love,
don't leave me alone now".

358
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:41,739
"I am the tourist of love,
don't leave me alone now".

359
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,075
"Where are you going, come here,
don't refuse my heart...

360
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:53,282
I am telling you, if you
could just accept me...

361
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:58,486
...accept me, accept me"

362
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:20,316
"Come and stay in my heart,
it also belongs to you."

363
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:28,051
"Come and stay in my heart,
it also belongs to you."

364
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:36,065
"Your love is the only
support in my life."

365
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:43,402
"Your love is the only
support in my life."

366
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,072
"Where are you going".

367
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,582
You naughty man.

368
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,482
But uncle.

369
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,422
Shut up! I have heard everything.

370
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,030
You need 300 rupees advance...

371
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,358
...to pay that dupe Sanjay's debts.

372
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,522
I will not give a single penny.

373
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,394
Why do you need the keys? Tell me.

374
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,697
Why don't you tell me
what you want to sell?

375
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,274
I have sold the kids cupboard.

376
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,377
That was last month. Sell
something today. Today.

377
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,241
Something bigger than a cupboard.

378
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,043
If I see you with that
dupe Sanjay again...

379
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,550
...I will break legs of
both of you. Get out!

380
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,452
Break the legs! Huh!

381
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,383
Hey! Brother.

382
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,257
Go away or else I'll
break your legs.

383
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,421
Customer.

384
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,261
Customer! Where is he?

385
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,460
Where is he? Where is he?

386
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,235
Who? Who? Who? Who?

387
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,395
Customer.

388
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,541
You! Just run away from here.

389
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,733
Uncle is very angry today.

390
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,402
If he is in an angry mood,
I am in a romantic mood.

391
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,568
Give me some cash.
- Cash!

392
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,079
Dear, just go and beg
somewhere today...

393
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,580
...or our legs will be
broken. Run, run.

394
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,381
Hey! Customer. Customer. Customer.

395
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,216
Oh customer. My legs are spared now.

396
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,482
So go on your legs now.

397
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,183
Oh! Good morning, uncle,
I mean mother.

398
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,453
What can I do for you?

399
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,689
I want a cupboard. A good one.

400
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,425
Really! Will you buy?

401
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,160
Then what, am I here
to ask you the cost?

402
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,396
Ask a thousand times,
it's your shop.

403
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,040
If you like anything just buy
it and if you don't like...

404
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,371
...thank you very much for coming.

405
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,533
Come here.

406
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,176
This cupboard is made specially
from Kashmiri wood.

407
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,376
Just have a look. But
it won't suit you.

408
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,542
This one.

409
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,052
Pakistani wood, American fittings...

410
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,555
...good from outside,
bad from inside.

411
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,486
And this one.

412
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,426
Oh! Never before madam.

413
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,726
You have a goldsmith's eyes
and the king's taste.

414
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,064
Just have a look closely,
it's a maker's magic...

415
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,432
...the best cupboard.

416
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,073
The king said this is
not a cupboard...

417
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,572
...but a Taj Mahal made out of wood.

418
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,731
Which king?

419
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,402
Oh! That one...

420
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,545
The one from the adjoining village.
- Yes. The adjoining village.

421
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,180
So, is this not for sale?

422
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,282
No. I am very sorry.
- The legs are broken.

423
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,419
But you don't worry, I will
not disappoint you.

424
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,680
This cupboard will go to your
place even if I lose my job.

425
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,485
Oh Thank you. But what
about the price.

426
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,684
The king is ready
to pay 1000 rupees.

427
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,421
Oh! Too much!

428
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,190
But you don't worry, 1000 rupees
is just for the king.

429
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,028
A 20 percent discount for you
and I will also waive my 10...

430
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,466
...percent commission. Just 700
rupees for you. Peanuts.

431
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,196
Ok. I will buy it.

432
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,465
Thank you very much.

433
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,370
Oh! The legs are safe now.

434
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,204
Hey boy. Take madam to our boss.

435
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,370
Excuse me madam. Payment
there, delivery here.

436
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,515
Thank you.

437
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,240
Will you kindly come this way?

438
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,477
Advance. Advance.

439
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,455
Advance!

440
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,611
No Advance. I'll the pay
full amount right away.

441
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,257
Thank you, madam.

442
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,329
Where do you get such
sales men from?

443
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,398
Why? What happened?

444
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,556
Cupboard.

445
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,396
Cupboard!
- It's very beautiful.

446
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,361
Is it sold?

447
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,371
Yes uncle.

448
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,666
Where should I deliver it to?
- Girls Hostel.

449
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,205
Girls Hostel? I have never
seen you before.

450
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,005
I am new here. That's
the reason I am here.

451
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,408
Our good luck.

452
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,477
Take this.

453
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,445
700 rupees?

454
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,613
Can I see which cupboard
you have bought?

455
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,352
It's not your salesman's fault.
I only forced him.

456
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,223
Run. Uncle is coming.

457
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,363
Uncle! Danger is coming!

458
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,555
Hide somewhere.

459
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,563
This cupboard.

460
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,374
Wow! What a choice!

461
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,445
Hey Gopal. Just deliver
this cupboard.

462
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,046
Take mother, this cupboard is yours.

463
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,205
Thank you.

464
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,181
Very good, Hanuman. Come with me.

465
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,051
My son, Hanuman, your face is
so similar to my sister's.

466
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,058
Today, I realized that you
also have the same blood...

467
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,256
...as our family.

468
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,332
Son, don't think that
I am stone hearted.

469
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:11,236
Take this for you and deposit
this cheque in the bank.

470
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,435
Thank you uncle. The legs are safe!

471
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,240
Got them. I got 300 rupees.

472
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:21,749
Sanjay. Sanjay. Sanjay.

473
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,482
Oh no! I am dead.

474
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,285
Get back the cupboard. Get it back!

475
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,555
Priya.

476
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,523
Yes madam.

477
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,359
I got a cupboard for you. Happy?

478
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,764
Oh madam! Thank you so much,
you are very sweet.

479
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,530
Let's go.

480
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,773
Priya, are we planning to
have lunch in the canteen?

481
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,449
Of course. I'll be ready
in ten minutes.

482
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,280
We will be ready in two minutes.

483
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,251
Wow!

484
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,251
You! How come here!

485
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,498
It's all about destiny, madam.
God knows I am innocent.

486
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,296
You are trying to act innocent.
You enjoy bad mouthing me.

487
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,498
No. Believe me. All this
happened very suddenly.

488
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:55,442
Where is that lady? Where?
Where is that old lady?

489
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,310
Where is that dupe lady? Where?

490
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,452
Why are you shouting so much?

491
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,419
Oh, so you are hiding here.
See this. See this. See this.

492
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,557
What?

493
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,713
This fake cheque.

494
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,384
You sins have come to
an end, you old lady.

495
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,194
Wrong! This is a genuine cheque.

496
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,334
Don't make excuses. I just
came from the bank.

497
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,062
Good that the government has
made prisons for women too...

498
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:25,175
...or else you would have
been scoot free today.

499
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,337
Let's go. Let's go.

500
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,405
Wait. Wait. Where are you going?

501
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,569
Get out.

502
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,543
Where is the way out?

503
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,276
This way. Get out.

504
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,478
Listen.
- Stop.

505
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,516
Hurry up. Hurry up.

506
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,288
Oh please you go and hide somewhere.

507
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:52,425
Follow me, fast. Open the door.

508
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,570
Now what?

509
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,298
Open the door. Open the
door. Open the door.

510
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,466
Open the door. Open the
door. Open the door.

511
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,448
Here's the cupboard. Come
on lift it. Hurry up.

512
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,444
What is all this?

513
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,246
You don't get a cupboard
with a fake cheque.

514
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,514
I told you many times, men
are not allowed here.

515
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,386
Dare you! Aren't you ashamed
to touch a man.

516
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,255
I said get out!

517
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,420
But my clothes and jewellery
are in there.

518
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,259
You can claim everything in court.

519
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,457
What?

520
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,433
Come on. Make it fast.

521
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,079
Hello. Your person has created
a chaos in the hostel...

522
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,410
...and he has insulted me by
claiming that the cheque is fake.

523
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,573
And the cupboard.

524
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,276
You just stop him.

525
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,511
And he has taken the cupboard.

526
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,246
It has my clothes and jewellery.

527
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,481
You better stop him or else
I'll call the cops.

528
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,284
Oh! Cops.

529
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,451
Wait. Wait. Stop the car.
Stop the car. Relax. Relax.

530
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,221
Hey what are you doing?
Trying to fall me down?

531
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,456
Okay. Okay.

532
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:58,500
You guys go and have some tea.
And don't come soon.

533
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,561
And get me also a tea.
- Ok. Hanuman brother.

534
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,036
Very good. Go.

535
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,276
Hey! Open the lock.

536
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,468
Get us four teas.

537
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,774
Hey Sanjay, I had to enact
such a huge drama for you.

538
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,475
Come on empty the cupboard.
First open the lock.

539
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,053
You empty the cupboard. Hurry up.

540
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,523
You thief, rascal.

541
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,127
You won't even spare
customer's goods.

542
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,060
Come down. Come on jump down.
- Oh! The legs have broken. Uncle.

543
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,690
Let them break. What uncle uncle,
I will make your pants.

544
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,063
Have you brought the fabric?

545
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,204
Not only the fabric, I have
also bought along your grave.

546
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,466
Always first to ask money and
always last to deliver goods.

547
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,275
Oh! My legs are gone.

548
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,537
Let the legs break. I will
break your bones too.

549
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,148
Good you stopped the cupboard.
Who are you?

550
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,284
Me? I am the owner of the shop.

551
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:53,146
Ohhh! Take this money.
Madam has sent it.

552
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,621
Should I take the cupboard?

553
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,521
Sure. Why not?

554
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,252
Hey Hanuman. Just deliver
this cupboard or else.

555
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,487
I'll break the legs.

556
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,690
No. I will take the cupboard.

557
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,492
It's necessary for me to come
due to some important goods.

558
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,696
And I will also ask forgiveness
from madam. Just a formality.

559
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,470
Relax. Relax.

560
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,279
Listen. Don't you
want to meet madam?

561
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,044
Oh yes. You go and tell
madam that I am here...

562
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,450
...in the mean time I will just
set the cupboard upstairs.

563
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,249
I'll set the cupboard.

564
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,415
You! Who let you in?

565
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:33,257
Old lady. Mother. Just forgive me.

566
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,229
Whatever I am. I am your
devotee. Forgive me.

567
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,731
I beg your pardon.

568
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,733
Oh you poor poor child.
Get up my son.

569
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,534
Thank you, mother.

570
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,077
Listen. You have brought me
here with great efforts...

571
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,478
...now please remove me or
else I be suffocated.

572
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,345
Good. So be it.

573
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,077
I don't care. My dead
photograph will be in...

574
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:00,213
...the newspaper, but you
will be in trouble.

575
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,359
Keys?

576
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,687
I'll be back in a moment.

577
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,458
You naughty. Wait.

578
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:14,265
You have the keys with you.
Give me the keys.

579
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,497
Keys? With me?

580
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,470
You got it?
- No.

581
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,044
Oh. I think I forgot them
at the madam's office.

582
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,475
Will you go and get it?

583
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,240
No, you get it.

584
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,542
No, you get it.

585
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,513
Give me the keys.

586
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,384
You please be outside I
will open the cupboard.

587
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:37,255
What! I stay outside. It is my
cupboard, give me the keys.

588
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,328
Oh lord! Please save him today.

589
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,486
Who?

590
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,327
The one who is inside.

591
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,497
How did you know?

592
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,270
Look you are like my sister,
please let me open it.

593
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,469
Why?

594
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,273
Or the poor soul will die.

595
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,413
Sanjay, Sanjay. Come
out. Sanjay. Hey.

596
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:14,691
God! He is dead. My friend,
my best friend is dead.

597
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,024
Open your eyes, I will give my
life to get your jeep back...

598
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,194
...I will introduce you
to your beloved Priya...

599
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,430
...open your eyes.

600
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,237
You thief. While dying also
you will steal my pocket.

601
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,505
Open the door. Open the door.

602
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:37,313
Open the door. Open the door. Quick.

603
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,388
Why did you close the door?

604
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,546
Madam.

605
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,317
You? Here?

606
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,393
The keys have changed shape.

607
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,551
The cupboard is not opening.

608
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,254
Nonsense!

609
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,456
All the keys are not working.

610
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,329
I will try.
- Don't try. I will cry.

611
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,536
It is Ok.

612
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,277
Thank you.

613
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,475
Now, you get out. Get out. Priya,
get him out of here.

614
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:15,422
Priya! Oh so you are Priya. Then
there is nothing to worry.

615
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,220
The cupboard has reached
the right place.

616
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,295
Come on, get out fast.
You son of a monkey.

617
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:24,230
Monkey! Oh inside. Good luck.
Let's go brother.

618
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,379
Who is it?

619
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,535
It's us.

620
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,475
What happened?

621
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,447
Oh! Madam is not yet ready.

622
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,514
I don't want to come.

623
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:49,285
Ok. You don't want to come?
Girls, one, two, three.

624
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,429
Listen, I haven't even
taken a bath yet.

625
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,257
No problem, you bathe
twice tomorrow.

626
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,423
Ok. Let me atleast
change my clothes.

627
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,589
Ok girls, drop.

628
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,668
Very funny. Thank you very much.

629
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,438
You are welcome.

630
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,239
Look, let me get ready.
You all wait outside.

631
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,009
What is there to feel
shy in front of us...

632
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,447
...you have played in our laps.
Just make it quick.

633
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,181
She would have been ready
by now, had he been here.

634
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,417
Who?

635
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,560
Priya's guide.

636
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,218
Sanjay?

637
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,364
Whatever everybody says,
he was a innocent guy.

638
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,021
Yeah. He will seem innocent
as he did not ask for money...

639
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,690
...and won't even ask in the future.

640
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,530
Good, we have got
rid of that loafer.

641
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,433
Who is it?

642
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,235
Somebody's knocking on the door.

643
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,502
But the door is open.

644
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,236
Then it must be the adjoining
room. Let's go.

645
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,405
Ok. Sorry. Sorry. Let's go.

646
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,249
Oh! I forget my handkerchief.

647
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,391
You all go ahead, I
will be right there.

648
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,582
Oh! Make it fast

649
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,254
Hey, the cupboard and
the door is open.

650
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,558
Now please get out.

651
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,556
They have left the door open again.
They fly in the air.

652
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,284
God knows what has happened
to these girls.

653
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:41,495
"What do I do God, where
have I stuck".

654
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,312
I am really tired. We
are leaving. Bye.

655
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,785
Bye. Good night.

656
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:19,736
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

657
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:26,276
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

658
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:33,321
"The effect was such,
the effect was such"

659
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,485
"The effect was such,
lost my senses".

660
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:45,767
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

661
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:11,224
"Our first meeting bowled me over".

662
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:17,493
"Our first meeting bowled me over".

663
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:23,436
"Didn't even spend a moment together
still fell in love with him".

664
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,269
"Still feel in love with him".

665
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:32,439
"Just knew that, just knew that".

666
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:38,418
"Just knew that, lost my senses".

667
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:44,494
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

668
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,708
"Heart started drifting
towards him".

669
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,214
"Feet took the first
step and stopped".

670
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,254
"Heart started drifting
towards him".

671
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,325
"Feet took the first
step and stopped".

672
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:22,489
"Don't know why I went close,
it started suffocating".

673
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,396
"Don't know why I went close,
it started suffocating".

674
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:31,303
"The way he was all over,
the way he was all over".

675
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:37,414
"The way he was all over,
lost my senses".

676
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:43,315
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

677
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,033
"The guest also entered the house...

678
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,440
...created 100 storms in the heart".

679
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,046
"The guest also entered the house...

680
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,707
...created 100 storms in the heart".

681
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,250
"Looking at his face,
I got baffled".

682
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,414
"I got baffled"

683
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:29,623
"Struggling here and there,
Struggling here and there".

684
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:35,500
"Struggling here and there,
lost my senses".

685
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:41,737
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

686
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:48,314
"The effect was such,
the effect was such"

687
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:54,515
"The effect was such,
lost my senses".

688
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,524
"The way our eyes met,
lost my senses".

689
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,260
You. You came back.

690
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:09,372
God is the witness, I
never went from here.

691
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,507
Never went!

692
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,235
The servant closed the
door. Your servant.

693
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,403
You liar. Come on. Get out. Out.

694
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,478
Just drop me till the door.

695
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,314
Of course. Come.

696
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,484
Now get out.

697
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,430
Priya.

698
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:43,573
Shhh...

699
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,235
Believe me, I lost my senses today.

700
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,508
Really.
- Yes.

701
00:45:54,251 --> 00:46:04,559
Good. Now get out.

702
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,423
Good night.
- Good night.

703
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,402
This is all lies. I have never
done something like that.

704
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,237
Every body knows I cannot do it.

705
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,539
This is all your game. You rascal.

706
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:28,242
You both brothers are a stain
on late lalaji's name.

707
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,046
Mr. Shankar Lal you are elderly,
I respect you...

708
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:35,385
...but these are all your games.

709
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,583
Lie. Absolute lie.

710
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,421
They are making false allegations
and case against me.

711
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,461
The court will pass the judgement,
Mr. Shankar Lal.

712
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,259
Come, Mr. Ganguly.

713
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,491
Let's go.

714
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,564
Yes madam.

715
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,531
Letter for you.

716
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,641
For me!

717
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,213
Madam, I will have to leave
for Calcutta today.

718
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:04,684
Daddy has called me urgently.

719
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,013
I know your father is in trouble...

720
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,217
...but it won't be possible
to reach today.

721
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,453
What if I catch a plane.

722
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,028
The plane will reach in 2 hours...

723
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:18,396
...but the airport is atleast
2.5 hours from here.

724
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,695
Any bus or taxi?

725
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,233
I told you, you have
very little time.

726
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,034
But Priya, there is
very little time...

727
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,575
...I don't understand what to do.

728
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,480
Oh Sanjay please. Do anything.

729
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,239
I will have to reach Calcutta
today itself.

730
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,384
I don't understand what
trouble is daddy in?

731
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,281
I wish I had my jeep today.

732
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:42,255
Hey wait. Idea. We have the jeep.

733
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,394
Which jeep?

734
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,585
My uncle's jeep.

735
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,252
But will your uncle give his jeep?

736
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,331
Of course. Why not?

737
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,431
You go and change your clothes,
I'll get the jeep.

738
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,262
I can do everything for my sister.

739
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,503
Listen. You please drive slowly.

740
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,590
Please slow down.

741
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,030
Your attention please, Ms.
Priya, Mr. Tailor and...

742
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:30,435
...Mr. Gupta.

743
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:34,043
Passengers travelling to Calcutta
via flight 202...

744
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:38,443
...kindly call at the enquiry
counter. Thank you.

745
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,313
Please. Please drive slowly.

746
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,012
Your attention please. This is
the last and final call for...

747
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:25,458
...Ms. Priya, passenger to
Calcutta via flight 202.

748
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,029
All passenger are requested
to proceed towards...

749
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,359
...the aircraft. Thank you.

750
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,255
Ms. Priya, you are late for the
flight. Any baggage with you?

751
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,453
Please welcome to the aircraft.
This way please.

752
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,562
Thank you Sanjay.

753
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,727
I would have never reached
had you not been there.

754
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,735
Now it seems as everything
is incomplete without you.

755
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,310
And without you my
life is incomplete.

756
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,412
Miss, please come.

757
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,547
I wish you could have come
with me to Calcutta.

758
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,239
My soul is going with you.
Only my body is here.

759
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,442
I will write to you soon as I reach.

760
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,586
Come as soon as you
receive my letter.

761
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,721
I will surely come.
- Bye. Bye.

762
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,515
Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

763
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,559
Bye. Bye.

00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,262

in my dreams".

765
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,533

00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:47,496
"Oh Priya! Oh Priya!"

773
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:23,401
"I am singing along in
every turn of my life".

774
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:31,480
"I am singing along in
every turn of my life".

775
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,277
"Don't ask the limit of passion".

776
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,546
"I am reaching towards
my love gradually"

777
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,283
"I am reaching towards
my love gradually"

778
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,759
"Who is the one coming
in my dreams".

779
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,761
"Who is the one residing
in my heart".

780
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,293
"Even the skies have bowed down".

781
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,565
"My love is bearing fruits"

782
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:03,475
"Oh Priya! Oh Priya!"

783
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:11,451

784
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:38,274
"The body dies, but
the soul never dies"

785
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:46,480

794
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:25,218
Oh Priya!"

795
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,701
Thank you kind man with
the black coat.

796
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,042
My bones and flesh would
have been scattered...

797
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,180
...had you not been there.

798
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,747
I have fallen at a very high place.
Which place is this?

799
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,777
This is the sky.

800
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,584
Sky! Oh.

801
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,263
But sir, will I get a cab
to reach Darjeeling?

802
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,059
Leave the worldly pleasures
behind, you human being.

803
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,700
I promise sir.

804
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:43,805
I will leave everything, except
one, my beloved Priya.

805
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,506
Who are you? I mean what
is your good name?

806
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:53,172
I don't have a name.
I have a number. 702.

807
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,447
702! Are you Indian James bond?

808
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,148

810
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,518

812
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,496
Tarachand.

813
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,631
Go this way.

814
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,400
Sir, is this queue for groceries?

815
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:15,732
No. Here you pay for your
good and bad deeds.

816
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,707
The justice is done here.

817
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,776
Oh. So you have bought
me to a court room.

818
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,042
Sir, the truck driver
was at fault...

819
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,237
...and you brought me here.

820
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,779
Did you take bribe from him?

821
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,049
See brother, if you want
to go to a court room...

822
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,246
...come with me to Darjeeling,
I have a good hold there.

823
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,390
The judgement will also
be quick there.

824
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,546
Judgement is sentenced
before death there.

825
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,386
Here, the judgement is
sentenced after death.

826
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,051
Very good. So let's go back.
What we got to do here?

827
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,720
Because you are dead now.

828
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,794
Look you constable, I
don't like such abuse.

829
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,738
Human, you are really dead.

830
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:53,139
May your father die. Why are
you killing me so young?

831
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,333
Where is your senior?

832
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,705
Don't make me angry.

833
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,744
If you say anything further,
I will pull your moustache.

834
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,079
Silence human, Silence.

835
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:05,746
Sir, this human being
is denying his death.

836
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,014
You are dead, human.

837
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,352
Very good sir. You
are also with him.

838
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,494
Don't you trust us?

839
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:12,719
No.

840
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,698
Sage Chandragupt, please
clear his doubts.

841
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,759
He does not accept his death.

842
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,035
Surprise! Nobody from
generations has asked...

843
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,230
...such a question.

844
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,405
Your body is supposed to die
and your soul is alive.

845
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,049
That means my time has come,
I am dead now?

846
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,377
Yes!

847
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,042
O! Lord, I am really dead then.
What will happen to me?

848
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,381
What will happen to Priya?

849
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,125
No. 702!

850
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,057
Indian James bond.

851
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,253
Your name?

852
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,488
Sanjay Kumar refugee.

853
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,392
Sanjay Kumar refugee?

854
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,357
Your fathers name?

855
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,198
Lala Baidnath transport man,
India gate, Lahore.

856
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,600
Baidnath?

857
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,675
Tarun Kumar. Father's name.

858
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,312
Sorry lord. Sorry. Sorry.

859
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,450
Pity lord. Pity lord. Pity.

860
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,529
What is this happening sir?

861
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,267
Ghost. Since when are you
in human department?

862
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,206
This is my first human, sir.

863
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,369
I was in the animal department
previously.

864
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:38,536
I used to get cats and dogs.

865
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:39,682
Shut up!

866
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,545
Ghost, you have bought the soul
of this human by mistake.

867
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,482
His death is not now.

868
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,283
Sir, I am not dead?

869
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,249
No, human being.

870
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:54,055
Wow sir. You are excellent.
Never before brother.

871
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,562
But human, your body is on earth.

872
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,201
We will have to put your
soul in your body again.

873
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,996
So make it fast sir, or else...

874
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,637
...the fat crows of Darjeeling
will eat my body.

875
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,204
Don't you worry, human.

876
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,706
I will myself come
with you and do it.

877
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,177
Sir, he should be punished.

878
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,642
Come, human being.

879
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,429
Sanjay, what did you do?

880
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,435
Dear Hanuman, dear Hanuman,
stop now.

881
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,730
He was a lovely boy.

882
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,638
Uncle, why you need to cry.

883
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,043
The insurance company will
reimburse your damages.

884
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,773
Donkey.

885
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,118
Vachan Singh, we lost 300 rupees.

886
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,051
You fatty, have some shame.

887
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,157
Oh Sanjay!

888
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:02,320
Once you enacted death and
today you are really dead.

889
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,291
My sister Priya has become a widow.

890
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:16,576
"Friend is no more friend,
love is no more love".

891
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:24,476
"Friend, I lost trust in you".

892
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,082
Sir, hanuman, my friend. He
is crying. I'll comfort him.

893
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,591
Hanuman.

894
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,086
"Friend is no more friend,
love is no more love".

895
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,095
"Friend, I lost trust in you".

896
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,097
See uncle, he is crying now.

897
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,101
He never gave me a penny
when I was alive.

898
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,431
Sanjay.

899
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,573
Yeah, tell me.

900
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,231
Why did you die so early?

901
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,706
I never died. Look, I am
standing in front of you.

902
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,105
Come, let me hug you, my friend.

903
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,302
What did you do?

904
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,447
Why don't you listen to me?

905
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,514
Hanuman. Oh Hanuman!

906
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:59,115
"Friend is no more friend,
love is no more love".

907
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,553
Sir, sir, never before brother!

908
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:05,057
They can neither see me nor hear me.

909
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,288
Yes, human. You are just a soul now.

910
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,262
They won't be able
to see or hear you.

911
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,061
Then sir, quickly take
me to my body...

912
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,498
...so I can atleast wipe
my friend's tears.

913
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:20,371
It's a deep problem, human.
They have burnt your body.

914
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,571
Now what sir?

915
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,072
Now only the great powers...

916
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,617
...residing in heaven
can solve this problem.

917
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,084
So make it fast, sir...

918
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,279
...or if their office is closed,
I'll be dead...

919
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:34,480
...and tomorrow is a Sunday.

920
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:35,624
Come.

921
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:36,759
Come.

922
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,132
Sir, you will have to
give us a solution.

923
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:49,101
There is only one solution
and that is put this soul...

924
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,606
...in another body.

925
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,641
True. True.

926
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,476
What? No that will never happen.

927
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,244
Oh great powers, listen
with your ears open.

928
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,786
I don't want anybody else's
body. I want my body.

929
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,723
But human, your body is destroyed.

930
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,225
What can I do? It's your fault.

931
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,193
It's the error of your department.

932
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:18,800
Silence human. Silence.
Just cool down.

933
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,269
Just leave me sir. You
guys are amazing.

934
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,064
If these people put me in
somebody else's body...

935
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,264
...how will my Priya recognise me?

936
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,068
She will definitely recognise you.

937
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,768
The ghost has erred because
of your appearance.

938
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,203
What do you mean?

939
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,075
The human who was supposed to die...

940
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,273
...looked exactly like you.

941
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,317
That's the reason why the
ghost bought you here.

942
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,085
So sir, it means you will
put me in that body.

943
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,417
Yes.

944
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,719
Then how will I remain myself.
I will become like him.

945
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,786
Human, you will be yourself only.

946
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:53,099
The truth is the soul. It is the
feel, the brain, the pride.

947
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,500
The body is just soil.

948
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,105
That is alright. But sir...

949
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,472
...will Priya and Hanuman
recognise me as Sanjay?

950
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,704
Definitely. All people known
to you will recognise you.

951
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:09,250
But you will have to pay for
the deeds of the body.

952
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,047
But sir, I will go in the
body only if I like it.

953
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,486
Definitely.

954
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:16,625
Promise.

955
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,191
Promise.

956
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,885
No daughter, you should not
go there. They are rascals

957
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,560
They cheated a good
woman like grandmother.

958
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,362
T.K. And Prem, both the brothers
are such rascals...

959
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,596
...that I have kept you away
from them since childhood.

960
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,332
And today, will you go and
beg sympathy from them?

961
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,908
I will ask for justice not sympathy.

962
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,974
You came here again. Sir does
not want to meet you.

963
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,242
You cannot go inside.

964
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,386
Today I will not go
without meeting him.

965
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,749
See it won't be good
for you if you force.

966
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:47,947
Shut up!

967
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,648
Talk slowly. This house belongs
to a reputed person.

968
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,397
Hell to his reputation...

969
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,430
...who does not consider
others human.

970
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,500
Selfish! Fraud!

971
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,864
I would have killed him,
had it been in my hands.

972
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:10,244
This girl also wants to kill
T.K., Why not use her?

973
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,747
According to me, your father
is completely innocent.

974
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,544
Really!

975
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,210
Yes. I have checked the
details of the accounts...

976
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,616
...from the office.

977
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,554
And I have also convinced
my brother to meet you.

978
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,252
I'll meet him right away.

979
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,692
Not now.

980
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:29,832
Then when?

981
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,730
In the evening.

982
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:32,868
Ok.

983
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,900
Brother will meet us
at 7:00 P.M. Sharp.

984
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,299
I'll definitely come.

985
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:37,700
Don't forget.
- No.

986
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,637
Ok. I'll take your leave now.

987
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:40,969
Bye. Bye. Thank you.

988
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,810
Wow sir, it feels great flying.

989
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,242
Which city is this?

990
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:46,438
This is Calcutta.

991
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,585
Oh! Calcutta. Isn't this
the Howrah bridge?

992
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,879
Yes. And that is Chaurangi.

993
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,504
Devilal, what is boss doing?

994
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,771
Sir is reading something?

995
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,375
Ok. Just get our things from
the suite of Grant hotel.

996
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,609
Ok.

997
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,633
Long live Earth. Long live Earth.

998
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,842
This is a beautiful house, sir.
Whom does it belong to?

999
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,568
You will get to know.

1000
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,887
Sir, what is that man doing?

1001
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,250
He is getting ready to shoot.

1002
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,755
To whom?

1003
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,690
His brother.

1004
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,387
So sir, let's go and tell the
cops fast. This is a crime.

1005
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:14,230
You forgot again. Nobody can
see and listen to you.

1006
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,530
But sir, we should do something.

1007
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,725
Is Mr. Prem home?

1008
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:39,883
You came again!

1009
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,792
Priya! Sir, Priya.

1010
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:45,729
Priya, you are here! See,
I am also here.

1011
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,392
You know where am I coming from?
Never before brother!

1012
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:51,631
Right from up! Priya. Priya.

1013
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,970
Sir, I am destroyed. She is
not even listening to me.

1014
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,308
She is my Priya.

1015
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:01,745
Silence human.

1016
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,248
Hello Ms. Priya.

1017
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,718
Hello Mr. Prem. Am I late?

1018
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,823
Not at all. You are
perfectly on time.

1019
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,824
Come, brother is waiting for
you in the library. Come.

1020
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,195
This way please. Go ahead.

1021
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:23,236
Hey Priya wait. Sir,
she is going inside.

1022
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,204
As lord wishes!

1023
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:37,646
Mr T.K., T. K sir.

1024
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,230
Leave me. What's happening?

1025
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,766
You have killed my brother.

1026
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,267
No!
- Shut up!

1027
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,405
You rascal!

1028
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,597
See he is blaming Priya.

1029
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,172
You rascal, bastard, let me go.

1030
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,175
I'll leave you. First
let the cops arrive.

1031
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,678
Sir, please save Priya.

1032
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,317
Not me, but you can save Priya.

1033
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:10,652
Me?

1034
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,787
Yes.

1035
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:12,921
How sir?

1036
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,216
By entering that body.

1037
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:19,191
I agree sir, come fast,
help me enter his body.

1038
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,264
I would have never run,
had I shot T.K.

1039
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,527
In fact, I would have considered
it a great deed.

1040
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,796
Hello. Hello. Police. Police.

1041
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:34,341
You heard sir, Priya hates this
man. She will hate me too.

1042
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,106
If you want to save her life, you
will have to enter this body.

1043
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,613
Oh lord! Where have I stuck?

1044
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,347
The bullet is out!

1045
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,294
Go and enter his body.

1046
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,793
As you wish, sir.

1047
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,335
Sir, never before!

1048
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,670
Come inspector.

1049
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,317
Leave me!

1050
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,318
Inspector, she is the one,
who shot Mr. T.K.

1051
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,580
Arrest her.

1052
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:21,745
Where is the body?

1053
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,186
It's there in the library.

1054
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,327
Wait inspector, I am
totally innocent.

1055
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,461
This man is framing
me unnecessarily.

1056
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:27,596
The truth will be out soon.

1057
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,231
But inspector, listen to me.

1058
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,238
Come inspector.

1059
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,812
Good evening Mr. T.K.

1060
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,208
Good evening.

1061
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,374
Your brother Prem called to
say that you were murdered!

1062
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:50,519
Murdered?

1063
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,880
Yes.

1064
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,616
Actually I went to sleep
some time ago.

1065
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,283
It seems Prem has started
day dreaming.

1066
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,428
What?

1067
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,365
You just send him inside.

1068
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:04,499
I'll just call him.

1069
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:05,634
Thank you.

1070
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,494
How silly of him!

1071
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,228
Silly of him. Yeah.

1072
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,675
Mr. Prem, Please come.

1073
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,648
Give him a hug.

1074
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,592
Constable, let her go.

1075
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,892
I am so sorry, Ms. Priya.

1076
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,336
Due to Mr. Prem's foolishness,
you had to suffer.

1077
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,664
Mr. T. K is alive.

1078
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,828
What?

1079
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,406
I am very sorry about it.

1080
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,411
Hell with a person like this...

1081
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,910
...who does not care for
other's reputation.

1082
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,844
It would be better, if he
would have been dead.

1083
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,854
Mr. Prem, come here.

1084
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,786
Forgive me, brother.

1085
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,357
I swear, that girl is very cunning...

1086
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:09,293
...she wanted to kill you
and she told me that.

1087
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,526
What has happened to you, brother?

1088
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,862
I sent his father to
jail on your orders.

1089
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,232
Hence she wanted to kill you.

1090
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:23,367
Go and free Priya's father from
jail and say sorry to him.

1091
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,672
Get out.

1092
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:37,315
Very good, human being. This is
the first sign of a good soul.

1093
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:42,294
But sir, the distance between
me and Priya has increased.

1094
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,295
Now how will this distance decrease.

1095
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:49,267
She does not hate your soul,
she hates this body.

1096
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,440
You will have to pay for
the deeds of this body...

1097
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:58,308
...but you will definitely get
the fruits of your soul.

1098
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,211
I'll take your leave now.
See you later.

1099
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:02,372
Where are you going, sir?

1100
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:11,815
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

1101
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,586
Drink. Sir.

1102
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:14,729
Drink!

1103
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:15,864
Yes sir.

1104
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:22,266
No. No. Take it away.

1105
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,272
Sir, you must be tired, why
don't you rest in your room?

1106
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,538
You go ahead.

1107
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,875
Yes sir. Come.

1108
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,792
Hanuman, leave me man.

1109
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:03,863
Hanuman, leave me man.

1110
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:18,913
Hanuman. Hanuman!

1111
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,255
Good morning, sir.

1112
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:29,225
How have you been, sir?
Did you sleep well?

1113
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:39,362
You must have your medicine sir.

1114
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,742
What is all this?

1115
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:44,879
Champagne sir.

1116
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:46,378
Champagne?
- Champagne.

1117
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,607
Yes sir. No whisky.

1118
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:49,876
I don't want anything.

1119
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,987
Good morning, sir. Today is
Saturday, September 18.

1120
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,390
Ms. Aroona and Rina Ghosh
had called up to say...

1121
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,457
...they are attending the
party in the evening.

1122
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,823
And Mr. John Taylor will meet
you in the office at three.

1123
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:04,227
Sir, will there be any new
guests in today's party?

1124
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,696
Choose your outfit, sir.

1125
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,335
Your bath is ready sir.

1126
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,337
Who am I?

1127
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,471
Sir?

1128
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,639
Who am I?

1129
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,244
Sir, you are our boss, Boss.

1130
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:52,505
Yes sir.

1131
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,446
Am I the boss?

1132
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,756
Yes sir. You give
us our daily bread.

1133
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,295
Boss?

1134
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,776
So, you all will obey my commands.

1135
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:22,911
Yes sir.

1136
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:29,548
Ok. So everybody get out.

1137
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:37,351
Why are you all not going? Get out!

1138
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:38,493
Yes sir.

1139
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:47,630
Hey you! Come here. Come here!

1140
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:56,301
Get me a cup of tea.

1141
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,536
Tea?

1142
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,442
Yes, hot tea.

1143
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:04,348
Yes sir. Yes, tea sir.

1144
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,185
Yes sir!

1145
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,304
Good morning, sir.

1146
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,905
Greetings.

1147
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,611
Come brother, come.

1148
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,750
You walk ahead.

1149
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,753
Good morning, sir.

1150
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:47,952
Good morning.

1151
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,332
Mr. Prem, the solicitors are
waiting for you in the room.

1152
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,524
Ok.

1153
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,477
Yes Mr. Ghosh, please come in,
Mr. T. K has arrived.

1154
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:06,705
Thank you.

1155
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:07,906
You are welcome.

1156
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,243
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1157
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:10,817
Good morning, Mr. T.K.
- Good morning, sir.

1158
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,822
How come you are at
the office today?

1159
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,927
Because Shankarlal's case is closed.

1160
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,829
Brother has set that old man free.

1161
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,233
But those people are not
at all genuine, Mr. T.K.

1162
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,838
The daughter of Shankarlal
is very much against you.

1163
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:33,201
She always keeps on cursing you.

1164
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,206
What have you not done for them?

1165
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,868
You gave them compensation,
you gave them importance.

1166
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:43,716
I suggest it would be better if
you rethink about this case.

1167
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,553
Ok Mr. T. K, we'll take your
leave now. Good day, Sir.

1168
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,716
Good day, sir.

1169
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,328
Bye Rita.

1170
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:55,485
Bye.

1171
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,526
My sick boy.

1172
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,699
Is this a joke?

1173
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,495
You still think it is a joke.

1174
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,209
Are you tired of me?

1175
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:44,345
Who are you?

1176
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,209
Oh! Will I have to remind
you about me?

1177
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:52,546
Go and do your work.

1178
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,218
This is my job from now on.

1179
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,659
I am tired of this environment
in just two days.

1180
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,594
Then let's go out somewhere.

1181
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,800
Where we both become one
last month, Switzerland.

1182
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,770
Nowadays, it's very romantic there.

1183
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,907
Oh Shut up!

1184
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:41,366
Hi sweetie. Why are you crying now?

1185
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:43,765
Did anything happen today?

1186
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,632
The elders have rightly said...

1187
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,402
..."always be away from
the horse's back...

1188
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:50,670
...and the boss's front".

1189
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:51,813
Stop it B. K

1190
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:54,972
Is anybody else in there?

1191
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,276
It is better if you
don't meet him today.

1192
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:57,509
Why?

1193
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,347
His mood is very bad.

1194
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,547
Mood is bad. It won't be
bad after meeting me.

1195
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:07,828
I have bought something
that speaks, money.

1196
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:12,833
"Money, Money, money is everything".

1197
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,235
Rita was right.

1198
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,373
Who are you?

1199
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,872
Relax my dear, relax.

1200
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:25,243
If that girl spoils your
mood, then sack her.

1201
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,473
There is an abundance
of girls nowadays.

1202
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,743
Search for one and you
will get thousands.

1203
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,408
What do you want?

1204
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:35,385
Your intelligence,
which mints money.

1205
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,651
Yesterday's race was excellent.

1206
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:45,756
Everything was on our side. I
have got the cash, sir, cash.

1207
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,493
So are we going to the club?

1208
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,729
We'll make plans for the other race.

1209
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:56,344
There are two wonderful
horses we can bet on.

1210
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,571
We will wash away all the bookies.

1211
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,610
Next time don't come
here with this money.

1212
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:04,752
Boss!

1213
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,887
Get out!

1214
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,226
Hello.

1215
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:16,386
Is Mr. T. K home?

1216
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,531
Yes, he is. What happened?

1217
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,361
I am Dr. Mathur here.
Call him on the line...

1218
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,524
...grandma is very serious.

1219
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:22,670
Yes.

1220
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,737
Sir. Sir, Dr. Mathur is on line.

1221
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,740
Sir, grandma is very serious.

1222
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,372
Grandma?

1223
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,887
Yes sir, she is not
well since many days.

1224
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,886
It seems her condition
is very serious today.

1225
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:47,452
Forget the old enmity sir, today
you will have to come.

1226
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,433
Hello.

1227
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,271
Yeah T.K. Dr. Mathur here.

1228
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,346
Grandma has suffered three
strokes since day before...

1229
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,277
...yesterday. Her condition
is very serious.

1230
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:09,917
Your presence is very important.

1231
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,849
Oh yes. I'll be right there.

1232
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:15,754
The car is ready.

1233
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,949
I'll get your coat, sir.

1234
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,361
Who is this grandma?

1235
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:40,536
Surilal.

1236
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:41,807
Yes sir.

1237
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:44,749
Where has sir gone?

1238
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,979
He is gone to see grandma, sir?
Her health is very serious.

1239
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,754
Grandma?
- Yes.

1240
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,757
He remembered grandma's
health after 10 years.

1241
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,759
Ramdas.

1242
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:55,896
Yes sir.

1243
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:58,456
Why does grandma stay
in a separate house?

1244
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:03,366
What can I hide from your sir. Sir.

1245
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:04,505
Yeah.

1246
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:05,764
Can I tell you something?

1247
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,271
Yeah tell me.

1248
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:11,334
You know that grandma's
is a very hyper person...

1249
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:18,385
...but her heart is full of love,
such people are very rare, sir.

1250
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,515
Just forget everything
that happened, sir.

1251
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,221
Forget it?

1252
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,386
Ramdas, I can forget only
if I remember anything.

1253
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,726
You won't understand.

1254
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,890
Have your medicines, grandma.

1255
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,231
May your medicines destroy in fire.

1256
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,737
They can destroy a perfectly
healthy human being.

1257
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,504
Grandma.

1258
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:51,409
Ramlal, what are you doing
here at midnight?

1259
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,411
I am fine and happening.

1260
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,086
You go home. Your wife and kids
must be waiting for you.

1261
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,425
Grandma, look who's come.

1262
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:07,526
Who is it? Who?

1263
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:12,601
Come here. Come. Come here.

1264
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:25,475
Why have you come here?

1265
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:29,817
You had promised not to see
my face till my death.

1266
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,231
Go away, it's still
time for me to die.

1267
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:38,365
Grandma!

1268
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,500
You shut your mouth.

1269
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,267
Go. Why are you not going?

1270
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,873
Forget whatever happened
in the past, grandma.

1271
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:53,608
Ramdas, he threw me
out of the house.

1272
01:25:55,517 --> 01:26:00,216
He could not get rid of his bad
company, he left his grandma.

1273
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,319
Now, those days have gone,
when I would see him...

1274
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,426
...and immediately give him a hug.

1275
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:11,196
If he is so stubborn,
I am nothing less.

1276
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,357
Enough grandma, have your medicine.

1277
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:14,559
Just take it away from me.

1278
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,260
At least have your
medicine, grandma.

1279
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:17,404
I told you I won't have it.

1280
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,540
No! No! No!

1281
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,251
Grandma, have this medicine
for my sake.

1282
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:50,370
You fool. A mother craves for love
of her child, not medicine.

1283
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:56,533
You are here, I'll be alright
now. Perfectly fine.

1284
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,406
I am perfectly fine now.

1285
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:08,688
He's changed so much. I don't
believe he's my grandson.

1286
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:18,862
It's all because of the lord.
Good. Very good.

1287
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,303
Will you write the letter
yourself, sir?

1288
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:27,702
If you wish I can
call the secretary.

1289
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,673
No need. You go.

1290
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:45,691
My dear friend, hanuman.

1291
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:51,832
I am perfectly fine here.

1292
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,233
But he thinks I am dead.

1293
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:17,318
Mr. Hanuman Singh. We are
very sorry to hear about...

1294
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:26,662
...your friend, Sanjay's death.

1295
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:37,541
As you are the only heir after
his death, he has left...

1296
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:41,307
...ten thousand rupees in your name.

1297
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:45,213
We request you to reach Calcutta
as soon a possible.

1298
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:48,355
The airline ticket has been
sent along with this letter.

1299
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,957
Our person will be there to
receive you at the airport.

1300
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:54,725
Your well wisher, insurance agent.

1301
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,156
Yes Sanjay, what did you
do my dear friend?

1302
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:04,226
You were right, you have
nobody in this world...

1303
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,168
...except me.

1304
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,435
No mother, no father,
no brother or sister.

1305
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,168
A friend should be like this.

1306
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,315
Sanjay, what will I do with
these ten thousand rupees...

1307
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,313
...when you are not there anymore.

1308
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:21,312
Oh Lord, you take this money
and give me my friend back.

1309
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,616
Hanuman brother, be brave.

1310
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,725
You will have to keep this money.

1311
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,240
Ramdas, the flight has arrived.

1312
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,290
Look, there is Hanuman.

1313
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,620
Ramdas, you go and receive him.

1314
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,884
Me?
- Go!

1315
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:10,668
Greetings! Are you Mr. Hanuman.

1316
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:12,533
Yes. Who are you?

1317
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:13,674
I am Ramdas.

1318
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:16,639
Oh! You are the one from
the insurance company.

1319
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:22,381
You father figure, I am
the less privileged...

1320
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,518
...for whom he did all this.

1321
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,252
What are you doing Mr.
Hanuman Singh?

1322
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,287
Forgive me, my nose is
leaking since morning.

1323
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,360
Come, Mr. T. K is waiting for you.

1324
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,420
T. K (Vaccine)? Which T. K?

1325
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:37,894
Of small pox or cholera?

1326
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,764
Your childhood T.K.

1327
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,595
Childhood T. K! I put those
in the childhood.

1328
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,260
You are getting me wrong, the big
boss has come to receive you.

1329
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,532
Oh! Big Boss has also
come. Let's go.

1330
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,334
You please carry my luggage.

1331
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:49,976
You go ahead I am getting it.

1332
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,641
Hanuman.

1333
01:30:53,815 --> 01:30:54,804
Hi!

1334
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,383
Hanuman!

1335
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:04,585
Dear Hanuman.

1336
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,269
Hanumannnn.

1337
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,567
Hanuman, Hanuman. What
happened Hanuman?

1338
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,232
Hanuman, Hanuman.

1339
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,571
Ramdas. Ramdas.

1340
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:30,815
Hanuman, Hanuman. Hanuman.

1341
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:35,287
Hanuman, Hanuman. Open
your eyes, Hanuman.

1342
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:36,423
Sanjay.

1343
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,286
Hanuman, listen to me.

1344
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,552
When I came back, my body was burnt.

1345
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,423
Oh! Sanjay.

1346
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:45,327
Hanuman, first listen to me.

1347
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,393
Hanuman, Hanuman,
and then, and then.

1348
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,801
The sage put my soul in
my look alike's body.

1349
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:55,943
Hanuman, I am the same Sanjay,
your friend Sanjay.

1350
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,305
My soul is the same, only
the body has changed.

1351
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,344
You got it. Got it.

1352
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:04,474
I got it. Got it. But
you are not Sanjay.

1353
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:05,619
You are somebody else.

1354
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:06,753
Who am I?

1355
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:08,582
You are Sanjay's ghost.

1356
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:16,690
Save. Save.

1357
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:17,831
I am Sanjay, your friend Sanjay.

1358
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,364
No you are not. You are not.

1359
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,626
Listen to me at least.

1360
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:29,833
You are ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

1361
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:32,240
Hanuman!

1362
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:33,744
You are Sanjay's ghost.

1363
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:36,383
Hanuman, I am not a ghost.
I am your friend, Sanjay.

1364
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,610
Ghost, please don't eat me.

1365
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,388
I haven't taken a bath since
months, I am stinking...

1366
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,251
...take my smell, take my smell.

1367
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:45,289
You fool I am not a ghost.

1368
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:47,757
You! "Ghost of the kicks,
don't listen to the talks".

1369
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:50,295
Legs are broken. Legs are broken.

1370
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:52,332
Legs are broken?

1371
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,467
Yes.

1372
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,432
Ghost, how do you know all this?

1373
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,663
You fool, at least listen
to what all I know.

1374
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:01,364
Do you remember, I stole
10 bucks from your hat?

1375
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:04,636
Yeah, I remember, give
me back my 10 bucks.

1376
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:05,938
Give back my 10 bucks!

1377
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,940
And you forgot that fatty gave
you a punch on your nose.

1378
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,208
That was because of you.

1379
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:11,544
Because of me?
- Yes.

1380
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:12,947
And you shut me in that cupboard.

1381
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,382
That was because of you.
- Because of me?

1382
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,216
No. That's because of sister Priya.

1383
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,379
Because of Priya!

1384
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:19,423
You are a fool like your uncle.

1385
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,552
You even know my uncle?

1386
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,356
I even know your grandfather.
Now you understood.

1387
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:24,498
Yes. Yes.

1388
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:25,632
Come on shake hands.

1389
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,731
Come on give me a hug.

1390
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:29,870
Sanjay, how do I forget?

1391
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,800
I burnt your body with my own hands.

1392
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,235
You are still a donkey.

1393
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:36,376
Ok. Do one thing. Tell me
the story of your journey...

1394
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:37,909
...to heaven once again. Only once.

1395
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:39,671
Journey to heaven! Once again!

1396
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:46,350
Sanjay, my dear friend.

1397
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,480
Oh! I'll have to burn him again.

1398
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:51,557
I don't even have money
to buy wood to burn him.

1399
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:53,926
Oh! He is really dead.

1400
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,861
What happened?

1401
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:02,764
Oh God. I am dead. I came back
to the same room again.

1402
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:06,236
Is this a house or magic?
All the rooms are the same.

1403
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:11,242
You! Who are you?

1404
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:15,872
Hey. Talk respectfully or else
you will have to lose your job.

1405
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:20,646
Don't you know me? I am Hanuman,
Sanjay's friend.

1406
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,550
Sanjay? Who Sanjay.

1407
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:23,690
The owner of this house.

1408
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:25,223
Is anybody there? Where have
all of them disappeared?

1409
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:26,917
Yes sir.

1410
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:31,957
Listen, give this pigeon to eat
something and throw him out.

1411
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:35,899
Devilal, who is this stud?
What is happening here?

1412
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,630
I am sorry, sir. He
is big boss's friend.

1413
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:39,795
Friend?

1414
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,236
He is just arrived from
Darjeeling yesterday.

1415
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:42,842
And he is big boss's
younger brother.

1416
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:47,279
What did you say? Younger
brother? This idiot.

1417
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,247
He must have adopted him recently.

1418
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:52,386
Anyways, from today you
are also my friend.

1419
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,783
Idiot. Brother has made
this house a zoo.

1420
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,789
Listen, get me a cup of cheap tea.

1421
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,188
Right away, sir.

1422
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,460
Hanuman, what happened?

1423
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:11,332
Nothing man. I was just
narrating your story...

1424
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:14,804
...but your servant is
not ready to believe.

1425
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:17,876
You fool, why are you
publicising the story?

1426
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,478
Come on, let's go to meet Priya.

1427
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:20,671
Meet Priya?
- Yes.

1428
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:23,282
Very good. I will narrate
the story to her.

1429
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,385
She is the only one who
is intelligent like me.

1430
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,852
You fool. You will spoil
the whole drama.

1431
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,585
And what about my sister's future?

1432
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:34,554
So will you not relent?
- No, I won't.

1433
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,253
You won't?
- No, never.

1434
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,729
Then let me call the sage. I will
put your soul in a dog's body.

1435
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,368
Dog! Sanjay, please don't
do anything like this...

1436
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:44,800
...or else the municipality
will take me away.

1437
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:46,234
So tell me, will you say anything?

1438
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,374
No. I won't even breathe.

1439
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,508
Sure?
- Sure.

1440
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:49,643
Then go and jump.

1441
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,404
Sanjay. Sanjay, the water is wet.

1442
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,815
These today's boys are fools.

1443
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:01,318
They get scared of the girl's
father unnecessarily.

1444
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,552
Oh daddy!

1445
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:32,748
What if Priya thinks I am T. K?

1446
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:27,363
"There is no mountain or
ocean between us now".

1447
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:35,404
"Come, see the dreams of my heart".

1448
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:40,350
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1449
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,716
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1450
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,881
"Sweet heart".

1451
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:15,585
"The rains have come,
the spring is here".

1452
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:22,628
"My heart is singing,
my soul is vibrant".

1453
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:34,204
"The rains have come,
the spring is here".

1454
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:41,611
"My heart is singing,
my soul is vibrant".

1455
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:49,688
"There is no mountain or
ocean between us now".

1456
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:57,229
"Come, see the dreams of my heart".

1457
01:38:57,498 --> 01:39:01,696
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1458
01:39:01,869 --> 01:39:04,269
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1459
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:06,235
"Sweet heart".

1460
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:29,186
"Am trying to calm my soul, the
soul is not calming down".

1461
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:36,531
"You come, calm down my soul,
I have tried my best".

1462
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:47,646
"Am trying to calm my soul, the
soul is not calming down".

1463
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:55,244
"You come, calm down my soul,
I have tried my best".

1464
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:03,296
"There is no mountain or
ocean between us now".

1465
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:10,494
"Come, see the dreams of my heart".

1466
01:40:10,871 --> 01:40:14,398
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1467
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:17,703
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1468
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:19,505
"Sweet heart".

1469
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:49,602
"The bride is ready, come
along with the procession".

1470
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:57,274
"Take me where I belong".

1471
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:07,917
"The bride is ready, come
along with the procession".

1472
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:15,392
"Take me where I belong".

1473
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:23,332
"There is no mountain or
ocean between us now".

1474
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:30,507
"Come, see the dreams of my heart".

1475
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:35,621
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1476
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:42,919
"Come, see me, my sweet heart".

1477
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:51,428
You are so far away from
me, and yet so near.

1478
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:54,904
When will you come?

1479
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:03,873
Priya, I am here. Open your eyes.

1480
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:08,546
No, you are Sanjay's shadow.

1481
01:42:09,389 --> 01:42:11,550
You will disappear as
soon as I open my eyes.

1482
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:15,255
It's better if you are captured
in my closed eyes.

1483
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:17,226
At least, see once, Priya.

1484
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:32,378
Sanjay!

1485
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:39,646
When did you come?

1486
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:42,479
Recently.

1487
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:46,392
Are you here since many days?

1488
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,549
Yes.

1489
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:52,456
And you were watching all
the drama from far away?

1490
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,601
Sometimes here, sometimes there.

1491
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:58,864
And now here. Far away from you.

1492
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:03,707
Let's go.

1493
01:43:03,877 --> 01:43:04,866
Where?

1494
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,205
Just come with me.

1495
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,347
But where sweetheart?

1496
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,913
It's such a beautiful day.

1497
01:43:09,082 --> 01:43:11,482
I and daddy were thinking
about you and you are here.

1498
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:12,619
Daddy?

1499
01:43:12,786 --> 01:43:15,482
Yes. He will be very
pleased to see you.

1500
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:17,385
I was going to get
him to Darjeeling...

1501
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:19,788
...if you wouldn't have come here.

1502
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:26,694
Darjeeling! It is left very
far away from me, Priya.

1503
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:28,891
Great.

1504
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:32,838
But life here is not like
it was in Darjeeling.

1505
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:35,531
No problem, it will become like one.

1506
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,343
How?

1507
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:41,937
Daddy will get you a nice
job at Mr. T. K's office.

1508
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:43,881
There?

1509
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,781
So what. You are concerned
about your job.

1510
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:48,945
What have you got to
do with that rascal?

1511
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,857
Rascal?

1512
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,293
Yes. He is a big rascal.

1513
01:43:56,863 --> 01:44:00,594
If you would have seen our
condition a few days back...

1514
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:03,235
...you would have killed him.

1515
01:44:06,373 --> 01:44:08,273
I wish I could kill him.

1516
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:17,207
Leave it. Your hands would
have become dirty.

1517
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:22,548
Come let's go home.

1518
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:26,557
No Priya. Not now.

1519
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:30,227
Let me become something and
then I will meet your dad.

1520
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:31,625
And what till then?

1521
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,662
Till then, we will meet each other.

1522
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:35,802
Where?

1523
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:39,302
Here, everyday, this time
of the day. Will you come?

1524
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:40,440
Yes.

1525
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:08,795
Let's go, driver.

1526
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,670
I am completely drenched. It's
raining heavily outside.

1527
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:21,575
The clouds are also very dense.

1528
01:45:21,748 --> 01:45:24,478
It's seems like the sky
will finally bow down.

1529
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:28,309
Sky bows down only in books
and stories, daughter.

1530
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:29,546
Not in reality.

1531
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,657
Oh daddy. Should I
tell you something?

1532
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:37,727
The guy you call by the name of
fool, has come to Calcutta.

1533
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:42,868
Who was with you in the park?

1534
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,367
He was Sanjay.

1535
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:46,699
Was he Sanjay?

1536
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:51,276
Yes daddy. He did not
come to meet you.

1537
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:54,642
He says he will meet you only
after he becomes something.

1538
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,849
Don't you trust me?

1539
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,886
No. Because he was not Sanjay.

1540
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:03,289
Oh daddy.

1541
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:06,790
I know that the guy with me
in the park was Sanjay.

1542
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:11,595
But dear, your Sanjay is
something else also...

1543
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:14,598
...apart from being Sanjay.

1544
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:17,532
Mr. T.K. Come on down.

1545
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:25,303
Congratulations on your success.

1546
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:30,848
I will be back.

1547
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:08,652
I have never seen such
a party in my life.

1548
01:47:08,822 --> 01:47:11,814
You are the king of Calcutta, Raja.

1549
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,453
All the big people have come.

1550
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:18,257
I might start shivering looking
at your influence.

1551
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,527
Prem.

1552
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,531
Mr. Mulchand had come.

1553
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:27,195
He was talking about
the bill of exchange.

1554
01:47:27,374 --> 01:47:28,773
He was saying only seven
days are left.

1555
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:42,252
Am I right, mummy?

1556
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:45,358
Hey, Sanjay.

1557
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,756
You never offered me a cup
of tea also in Darjeeling.

1558
01:47:48,929 --> 01:47:52,228
And you have invited so many
people for dinner here.

1559
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:54,731
You used to act like your
were very poor. Huh!

1560
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:57,495
Hanuman, neither that was
a lie, and nor is this.

1561
01:47:58,405 --> 01:47:59,531
Yes, my friend.

1562
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,774
The truth is that you are
Hanuman and I am Sanjay.

1563
01:48:04,444 --> 01:48:06,674
We both are bearing the
fruits of our deeds.

1564
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:09,508
Come darling Hanuman, come with me.

1565
01:48:09,683 --> 01:48:12,709
Oh! I think I have done
some great deeds!

1566
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:14,183
Come, sweet heart.

1567
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:28,834
Enjoy everybody! Cheers!

1568
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:49,582
Sanjay. Sanjay.

1569
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:52,247
Oh God. Oh God.

1570
01:48:54,494 --> 01:48:58,828
We know someone who has
some very good stuff.

1571
01:48:58,999 --> 01:49:02,162
But he sells in black at a
premium of fifty percent.

1572
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:04,667
Whether you buy today or tomorrow.

1573
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:08,239
His mood was bad in the morning,
it's better now.

1574
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:13,209
Go. Your life will
be set. Good luck.

1575
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:15,281
Please.

1576
01:49:18,451 --> 01:49:20,919
B. P, please behave yourself.

1577
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:23,754
Why are you crying now?

1578
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:27,889
T. K does not belong to one,
but all the girls, Rita.

1579
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:31,922
All these girls, whom T. K admires.

1580
01:49:32,098 --> 01:49:34,464
From when did you start
knowing his preferences?

1581
01:49:35,468 --> 01:49:38,494
To tell you the truth,
that's my real job.

1582
01:49:43,376 --> 01:49:47,472
I am sure you will not miss
this golden opportunity.

1583
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:49,205
It's a very sweet proposal.

1584
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:50,474
I'll take your leave now.

1585
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,515
T. K darling, where have you been?
I was looking for you.

1586
01:49:52,686 --> 01:49:53,812
Where have you been?

1587
01:49:56,389 --> 01:49:59,222
T. K, don't be rude.

1588
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:34,584
Leave me alone.

1589
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:37,826
Listen to me.

1590
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:41,866
I know what you want
to say, Mr. T.K.

1591
01:50:44,704 --> 01:50:49,937
How do I explain you? I am living
somebody else's life.

1592
01:50:51,544 --> 01:50:54,536
You have told me such false stories
a lot of times before.

1593
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:58,480
Believe me Priya, all those
stories were real.

1594
01:51:05,392 --> 01:51:10,386
But now. Now I don't even have
the control over the truth.

1595
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,931
You have always lied, now
you also suffer from it.

1596
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:20,334
I don't have the time to trust
your stories. Just go away.

1597
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:52,769
Oh! This guy had never done
a good deed in his lifetime.

1598
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,637
I wouldn't have entered his
body, had I known him.

1599
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:04,283
Selfish! Rascal! Idiot.

1600
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:16,260
Why are you cursing yourself?

1601
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:19,523
You? What are you doing here?

1602
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,628
I am waiting for you.

1603
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:30,965
Get out. I say get out.

1604
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:33,709
Just go away from here.

1605
01:52:37,851 --> 01:52:40,786
Why this strange behaviour today?
Are you in a bad mood?

1606
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,412
I will treat your mood.

1607
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:47,253
You always said that I am the
solution for all your problems.

1608
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:10,872
Oh lord.

1609
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:18,211
God bless you, son. God bless you.

1610
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:22,354
How are you?

1611
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:26,292
Forget about me, how are you?

1612
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:28,893
I am good. Perfectly fine.

1613
01:54:44,844 --> 01:54:49,247
What is the problem? Why are
you hiding it from me?

1614
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:51,713
There is something, grandma.

1615
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:55,251
It seems I have no
one in this world.

1616
01:54:55,421 --> 01:54:57,685
Why do you say like this? Am I dead?

1617
01:54:58,424 --> 01:54:59,789
Don't say such things, grandma.

1618
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:06,196
I am regretting entering
this body, this life.

1619
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,631
I am very happy today.

1620
01:55:09,802 --> 01:55:13,704
One girl has evoked so much warmth
and so much love in you.

1621
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:15,807
Tell me who is she?

1622
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:22,539
There is someone, grandma
who hates my body...

1623
01:55:22,715 --> 01:55:24,478
...as well as my shadow.

1624
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:28,610
No son, she would be hating
your reputation...

1625
01:55:28,788 --> 01:55:33,248
...your black money and your past.

1626
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:37,225
So what should I do, grandma?

1627
01:55:38,398 --> 01:55:44,268
I am tired of this life. The past
has left a stain on my head.

1628
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:45,870
Just wash away that stain.

1629
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:50,272
Just distribute all that
money which compelled...

1630
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:52,240
...you to do all those bad deeds.

1631
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:57,247
'Our country will benefit
greatly with this place'.

1632
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:04,587
'I can only say that we
all should be one...

1633
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:07,817
...and god bless us all'.

1634
01:56:17,337 --> 01:56:20,329
Brothers and friends. Whatever
I have given you...

1635
01:56:20,506 --> 01:56:24,533
...does not belong to me,
it belongs to you all.

1636
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:27,441
Your hard earned money is
being returned to you.

1637
01:56:27,613 --> 01:56:30,343
I request you all to keep
up the good work...

1638
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:34,452
...so that our children
can get more benefits.

1639
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:35,587
Greetings.

1640
01:56:35,855 --> 01:56:40,292
Bihar relief fund, Koyna Nagar,
blind institute...

1641
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,950
...orphanage.

1642
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:45,228
Let me at least take one.

1643
01:56:45,398 --> 01:56:48,390
Not even half. All this
money belongs to God.

1644
01:56:48,568 --> 01:56:49,535
God?

1645
01:56:49,702 --> 01:56:50,669
Yes.

1646
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:52,236
I mean, God has so much money!

1647
01:56:52,405 --> 01:56:53,429
What?

1648
01:56:53,606 --> 01:56:55,267
But when will you return
my 10 rupees?

1649
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:57,841
That I'll give you from
my own earnings.

1650
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,410
From your own earnings! Then
I will definitely get it.

1651
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:00,477
Brother.

1652
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:01,613
Here, one more has come.

1653
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:02,748
Come Prem.
- Come.

1654
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:09,216
Excuse me brother. I have to
tell you something urgently.

1655
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:10,356
Yes tell me.

1656
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:11,490
But.

1657
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:14,387
Oh! Don't worry, he
knows everything.

1658
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:20,598
Brother, I need 3 lakh
rupees urgently.

1659
01:57:20,767 --> 01:57:22,667
What? 3 Lakhs!

1660
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,904
I had taken it for my
expenses from Roonie.

1661
01:57:27,073 --> 01:57:28,438
I have to return to
day after tomorrow.

1662
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:32,505
I am sorry, Prem. I won't
be able to give anything.

1663
01:57:32,678 --> 01:57:35,272
Dear, this is God's money.

1664
01:57:35,448 --> 01:57:37,245
When this Hanuman didn't get it...

1665
01:57:37,417 --> 01:57:38,714
...then what will this Ravan get.
- Shut up!

1666
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:44,346
Brother, just think. This money
is the result of your hardwork...

1667
01:57:44,524 --> 01:57:46,355
...and my honesty. You
are distributing it.

1668
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:47,720
I ask why? Why?

1669
01:57:50,363 --> 01:57:51,352
You can leave.

1670
01:57:54,734 --> 01:57:59,603
Prem brother, I am sorry. Can
I suggest you something?

1671
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:02,173
A lot of money is going to be
distributed amongst the poor...

1672
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:03,638
...tomorrow morning.

1673
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:06,301
Why don't you change your
appearance and wait...

1674
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,310
...in the beggar's queue, you
will atleast get something?

1675
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:09,448
Idiot.

1676
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:14,676
Ok Sanjay, I will take
your leave. Bye Bye.

1677
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:16,185
Hanuman.

1678
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:17,322
Yes.

1679
01:58:21,327 --> 01:58:22,351
I will take a minute.

1680
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:26,362
One moment. You may go now.

1681
01:58:26,532 --> 01:58:27,726
Now it won't come.

1682
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,868
Have a glass of chilled
water you will get it.

1683
01:58:33,339 --> 01:58:34,397
Have you read this?

1684
01:58:34,574 --> 01:58:35,768
What?

1685
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:39,241
Brother has gone mad he is
giving away all the wealth.

1686
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:42,574
Wealth is like a soil in the hands.

1687
01:58:42,748 --> 01:58:44,716
It must be for you, not me.
I cannot see my hard...

1688
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:46,875
...earned money being
wasted like this.

1689
01:58:47,386 --> 01:58:49,616
Stop talking nonsense.
What have you earned?

1690
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:53,358
You call dishonesty hard work?
Do you remember...

1691
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:56,359
...your parents had left
you when you were a kid.

1692
01:58:56,529 --> 01:58:59,362
My daughter-in-law and I have
brought you up like Battu.

1693
01:58:59,532 --> 01:59:03,366
And Battu kept his father's word
by accepting you as his own.

1694
01:59:03,536 --> 01:59:06,164
Even I have made my blood and
sweat one for the wealth.

1695
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:10,571
Not one. But you have separated
blood relations.

1696
01:59:10,743 --> 01:59:14,338
With your black deeds you
have separated him from me.

1697
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:16,345
Now when he is on the right track...

1698
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,177
...you are coming in his way, why?

1699
01:59:18,351 --> 01:59:19,375
Grandma!

1700
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,679
Dare you call me grandma,
you rascal. Just go away.

1701
01:59:22,421 --> 01:59:23,888
Good.

1702
01:59:26,692 --> 01:59:28,922
A capitalists turns socialist.

1703
01:59:29,762 --> 01:59:33,254
Priya, I think a stone hearted man...

1704
01:59:33,432 --> 01:59:39,803
...is turning into a kind hearted
one. What do you think?

1705
01:59:41,707 --> 01:59:42,230
Listen, you are giving bonuses
and distributing money...

1706
01:59:45,778 --> 01:59:47,211
...to everybody, what about me?

1707
01:59:48,381 --> 01:59:49,848
What do you want?

1708
01:59:50,383 --> 01:59:52,578
A good daughter
- in- law.

1709
01:59:54,387 --> 01:59:55,911
Where do I get one from?

1710
01:59:56,489 --> 01:59:58,389
Why? Have you forgotten Priya?

1711
01:59:58,558 --> 01:59:59,525
Hanuman!

1712
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:06,722
Hanuman!

1713
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:08,390
Yes.

1714
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:10,229
Who is this Priya?

1715
02:00:10,403 --> 02:00:11,529
What do I know?

1716
02:00:11,704 --> 02:00:12,671
What?

1717
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:14,931
I mean, I don't know her
parents and family.

1718
02:00:15,107 --> 02:00:16,734
But what I know is that she
is Sanjay's sweetheart...

1719
02:00:16,909 --> 02:00:18,934
...she likes him and
everything's alright.

1720
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:20,345
Who is Sanjay?

1721
02:00:20,513 --> 02:00:21,741
Your T. K is my Sanjay.

1722
02:00:22,415 --> 02:00:24,246
Ok. Where does she stay?

1723
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:25,384
In Calcutta.

1724
02:00:25,551 --> 02:00:27,382
Calcutta?
- Yes.

1725
02:00:27,753 --> 02:00:31,450
Mother isn't Priya Shankar
Lal's daughter?

1726
02:00:35,428 --> 02:00:36,395
Is Shankar Lal there?

1727
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:37,529
Yes.

1728
02:00:38,431 --> 02:00:43,664
Oh my God! Mother. Priya, Priya! .

1729
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:53,503
Greetings mother

1730
02:00:54,413 --> 02:00:55,471
Long live.

1731
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:57,275
My good luck that you are here.

1732
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:58,417
Sit down.

1733
02:00:58,584 --> 02:00:59,778
Why did you take the
trouble to come here?

1734
02:00:59,952 --> 02:01:00,850
You should have just
given me a call,

1735
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:02,214
I would have come running.
- Just sit!

1736
02:01:02,388 --> 02:01:03,355
Greetings Shankar Lal sir.

1737
02:01:03,522 --> 02:01:04,614
How are you Ram Lal?
- Yes. I am fine.

1738
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:10,353
Priya! Come here dear.
Take her blessings...

1739
02:01:10,529 --> 02:01:13,293
...she has brought you up!

1740
02:01:16,836 --> 02:01:22,468
Long live! She is the same
as her mother. Isn't she?

1741
02:01:26,812 --> 02:01:32,944
The same features. Do
you also cook like her?

1742
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,917
Or is she among the girls who
get made up all the time?

1743
02:01:36,088 --> 02:01:37,385
She cooks mother. She does.

1744
02:01:37,556 --> 02:01:39,649
Ok then, go and make
a cup of tea for me.

1745
02:01:39,825 --> 02:01:40,792
But you don't have tea mother.

1746
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,984
Can she get something else for you?

1747
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:45,289
Today I am going to have
tea made by Priya. Go.

1748
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:46,726
Go dear.

1749
02:01:49,902 --> 02:01:55,966
Sit. You grown old but
still have no sense.

1750
02:01:57,376 --> 02:01:58,343
Ramlal.

1751
02:01:58,511 --> 02:01:59,478
Yes mother.

1752
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:02,813
Do you know why am I here?

1753
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:07,214
No. I don't. But I
am aware as to why.

1754
02:02:07,386 --> 02:02:08,853
Then why didn't you
come and tell me?

1755
02:02:09,388 --> 02:02:13,916
Mother, how can a lamp
be compared to the sun?

1756
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:17,324
God! During your marriage too
you were saying the same.

1757
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:19,396
If I wouldn't have intervened...

1758
02:02:19,565 --> 02:02:23,729
...then you would have been
a bachelor till now.

1759
02:02:25,404 --> 02:02:26,371
Now go.

1760
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:30,534
Come dear.

1761
02:02:40,486 --> 02:02:42,454
You met Battu
in Darjeeling. Right?

1762
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:43,918
Who battu?

1763
02:02:45,424 --> 02:02:47,392
I have sent your father
in the other room...

1764
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,993
...so that you don't feel shy.

1765
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:54,264
What are you hiding from me?
Tell me. Didn't you meet him?

1766
02:02:54,433 --> 02:02:55,661
But he...

1767
02:02:55,835 --> 02:02:59,669
He is my grandson. I fondly
call him Battu.

1768
02:03:00,373 --> 02:03:02,568
Hanuman has told me everything.

1769
02:03:02,742 --> 02:03:03,709
Hanuman?

1770
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:06,344
Hanuman calls him Sanjay, his
parents called him Pappu...

1771
02:03:06,512 --> 02:03:10,312
...his colleagues call him T.K.
He does not have one name.

1772
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:13,350
Chairman, president and
God knows how many.

1773
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:20,253
But you have led our family's
spoilt man the on the right way.

1774
02:03:21,494 --> 02:03:26,932
You have done something
that I could not.

1775
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:30,926
I did not do anything.

1776
02:03:31,871 --> 02:03:36,274
What is the matter between
you two? Why is he so sad?

1777
02:03:36,442 --> 02:03:42,381
Today he was saying
he is a dead body.

1778
02:03:45,851 --> 02:03:51,881
I am dying to see a daughter-in-law,
and he is dying to see you.

1779
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:58,353
You won't listen to him, but will
you not listen to me also?

1780
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,796
Have tea grandma.

1781
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:55,786
Priya, Priya! What is the matter?

1782
02:04:56,455 --> 02:04:57,888
Who are you?

1783
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:00,218
What?
- Yes.

1784
02:05:00,392 --> 02:05:05,625
What is wrong? I wait endlessly
for you everyday...

1785
02:05:05,798 --> 02:05:08,961
...and go back home disheartened.

1786
02:05:09,401 --> 02:05:11,733
So, what are you going to do today?

1787
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:13,767
You are there today.

1788
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:20,310
Who me? I am here for a stroll.

1789
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:22,606
You seem to be very happy.

1790
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:23,770
Yes. The matter has
brought happiness.

1791
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:26,247
Let me hear it too.

1792
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:32,254
Someone had come home today.

1793
02:05:32,424 --> 02:05:33,391
Who?

1794
02:05:33,993 --> 02:05:38,657
A close relative. Really close.
Had come to talk about...

1795
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:41,459
...my marriage, with daddy.

1796
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:46,461
Oh! So the things are fixed.

1797
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:47,799
Yes, almost.

1798
02:05:50,442 --> 02:05:52,273
When is the wedding?

1799
02:05:52,444 --> 02:06:00,249
Very soon. Will you
come to have sweets?

1800
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:05,881
So you have decided.

1801
02:06:09,828 --> 02:06:14,527
What could I do? I had to,
being an Indian girl.

1802
02:06:22,975 --> 02:06:24,966
Why don't you tell me
who is the lucky guy?

1803
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,779
Why don't you tell me?

1804
02:06:30,516 --> 02:06:32,450
Ask Grandma.

1805
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:38,456
What? Grandma!

1806
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:42,289
Yes. Grandma. Dear Battu.

1807
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:43,758
Battu!

1808
02:07:08,487 --> 02:07:14,790
Sanjay, promise me you will
love me like this forever.

1809
02:07:15,494 --> 02:07:24,402
"If my love is true, then
wherever you go...

1810
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:30,338
...I will be there for you".

1811
02:07:31,877 --> 02:07:38,783
"Where ever I take you,
I will give my life...

1812
02:07:38,951 --> 02:07:48,587
...whenever you call for me".

1813
02:08:21,493 --> 02:08:29,400
"This is a strange secret
and a strange thing".

1814
02:08:29,568 --> 02:08:36,804
"This is a strange secret
and a strange thing".

1815
02:08:36,975 --> 02:08:44,882
"Our love is from the time
this universe is there".

1816
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:47,746
"Priya, Priya".

1817
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:54,425
"This love will not lessen
even after death".

1818
02:08:56,562 --> 02:09:01,192
"Wherever you go, I
will be there too".

1819
02:09:04,369 --> 02:09:10,365
"If my love is true, then
wherever you go...

1820
02:09:10,542 --> 02:09:18,244
...I will be there for you".

1821
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:49,879
Why not this sky accompanies
us in our journey?

1822
02:09:50,048 --> 02:09:57,648
Why not this sky accompanies
us in our journey?

1823
02:09:57,823 --> 02:10:05,491
I am with you like your shadow,
I love you so much.

1824
02:10:08,867 --> 02:10:15,431
Now these steps will not stop.

1825
02:10:16,909 --> 02:10:22,848
"Wherever you go, I
will be there too".

1826
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:30,682
"If my love is true, then
wherever you go...

1827
02:10:32,558 --> 02:10:38,326
...I will be there for you".

1828
02:10:40,566 --> 02:10:43,433
Ms. Kamla Saxena is requesting
you to grace...

1829
02:10:43,602 --> 02:10:46,435
...the marriage ceremony
of her grandson...

1830
02:10:46,605 --> 02:10:53,738
...with Priya, and give
them your blessings.

1831
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:57,004
T. K has called you for his wedding.

1832
02:10:57,482 --> 02:11:00,315
I know what you are trying to say.

1833
02:11:01,386 --> 02:11:04,378
But you will still be the faithful
secretary for the man who...

1834
02:11:04,556 --> 02:11:10,358
...has discarded you like
and old file for Priya.

1835
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:13,498
Ok! Just see what I do.

1836
02:11:26,445 --> 02:11:27,469
Yes Rita.

1837
02:11:27,913 --> 02:11:31,679
I have never taken any undue
advantage from you...

1838
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:34,284
...but now I am compelled to.

1839
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:36,978
Even I am a human like Priya.

1840
02:11:37,556 --> 02:11:40,286
So, are you trying to compare
yourself to Priya?

1841
02:11:40,459 --> 02:11:42,552
No! She is competing with me.

1842
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:43,695
Rita!

1843
02:11:43,862 --> 02:11:45,557
The truth is always bitter.

1844
02:11:45,731 --> 02:11:49,690
Weren't you the one to
say that you will...

1845
02:11:49,868 --> 02:11:52,803
...never play with my emotions.

1846
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:56,566
How do I explain you? It wasn't me.

1847
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:59,302
Oh! Very good.

1848
02:11:59,478 --> 02:12:02,276
So you are even refusing
to recognise yourself.

1849
02:12:02,447 --> 02:12:03,914
How clever?

1850
02:12:04,416 --> 02:12:10,582
Believe me Rita. I am
not T.K. He is dead.

1851
02:12:11,523 --> 02:12:15,721
But my T.K. Is alive. Do not
try to forget those days.

1852
02:12:15,894 --> 02:12:18,385
Do not forget that
we got married in...

1853
02:12:18,563 --> 02:12:20,258
...Switzerland a year back.

1854
02:12:20,432 --> 02:12:21,399
What?

1855
02:12:21,566 --> 02:12:24,763
I have the marriage certificate.
I have been quite till now.

1856
02:12:24,937 --> 02:12:28,668
But now I'll tell the whole
world that you are my...

1857
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:30,933
...husband and I am your wife.

1858
02:12:31,543 --> 02:12:36,344
If you still want me to be quite,
then come home at 8:00 P. M...

1859
02:12:36,515 --> 02:12:41,885
...sharp and decide for yourself.
I will wait for you.

1860
02:12:42,454 --> 02:12:45,685
So long, my dear husband. Bye! Bye!

1861
02:12:56,935 --> 02:13:00,393
I thought being his private
secretary, should let you...

1862
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:05,635
...know some of his private things,
to his bride-to-be.

1863
02:13:08,513 --> 02:13:11,311
There is nothing private between us.

1864
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:13,384
There is.

1865
02:13:13,852 --> 02:13:17,652
One private secretary
who has been with him...

1866
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:20,519
...for years and will be.

1867
02:13:21,426 --> 02:13:26,989
I knew somebody like you would
definitely come. Tell me.

1868
02:13:33,872 --> 02:13:35,737
He has spent many nights with me.

1869
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:37,397
Yes. He must have.

1870
02:13:38,577 --> 02:13:42,775
He will also be with me tonight.
I am telling the truth.

1871
02:13:43,448 --> 02:13:46,679
Can you tell a lie?
I don't think so.

1872
02:13:50,856 --> 02:13:54,792
If you wish to meet, then come
searching at this address.

1873
02:13:56,561 --> 02:13:59,291
Tonight at eight.

1874
02:14:29,861 --> 02:14:36,858
Hello. Is T. K there? He
has gone out. Where?

1875
02:14:38,537 --> 02:14:43,406
Didn't say anything. Ok. Thank you.

1876
02:15:22,414 --> 02:15:23,972
Greetings.

1877
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,509
Greetings. Is Rita madam there?

1878
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:41,389
You are standing like a stranger
in your own house.

1879
02:15:42,567 --> 02:15:46,663
All this is yours, only
I am a stranger, right?

1880
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:56,709
Come, sit. Come. Whisky?

1881
02:15:57,415 --> 02:15:58,382
No!

1882
02:15:58,917 --> 02:16:00,214
Champagne?

1883
02:16:00,385 --> 02:16:01,716
No, thank you.

1884
02:16:03,388 --> 02:16:06,221
What magic has Priya done?

1885
02:16:06,858 --> 02:16:09,656
You seem to have forgotten
both, alcohol and me.

1886
02:16:10,395 --> 02:16:12,829
Really, Rita has given up now.

1887
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,732
It is so sad. But do not
take it as your victory T.K.

1888
02:16:17,903 --> 02:16:20,269
You have sold my love
and brought a doll.

1889
02:16:20,438 --> 02:16:22,372
And now you are selling yourself...

1890
02:16:22,541 --> 02:16:24,338
...so that you can pay her dues.

1891
02:16:31,416 --> 02:16:33,247
Rita! Try to understand me.

1892
02:16:34,419 --> 02:16:36,853
I am being duped in trying
to understand you, T.K.

1893
02:16:37,022 --> 02:16:40,355
You're leaving me after taking
away my beautiful years.

1894
02:16:40,525 --> 02:16:41,549
First you make me your princess...

1895
02:16:41,726 --> 02:16:42,988
...and then you throw me
like a pair of shoes.

1896
02:16:43,395 --> 02:16:45,295
No! No! No! Rita.

1897
02:16:45,463 --> 02:16:46,987
This is not the case.

1898
02:16:47,432 --> 02:16:49,900
You won't understand what
I was and what am I today.

1899
02:16:50,068 --> 02:16:51,899
Nothing is in my hands, Rita.

1900
02:16:52,437 --> 02:16:55,406
I can just say that I am trapped
with a good soul...

1901
02:16:55,574 --> 02:16:58,805
...and a bad body, and I
am fighting with nature.

1902
02:16:59,544 --> 02:17:03,605
Rita, everybody will laugh on
me if I say this to anybody.

1903
02:17:03,949 --> 02:17:08,386
I am a shadow of my past. I
am searching for my being.

1904
02:17:08,553 --> 02:17:11,215
I will be free, if I get it.

1905
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:16,292
Rita, you don't know how many
difficulties I have faced...

1906
02:17:16,461 --> 02:17:18,326
...to get Priya.

1907
02:17:18,496 --> 02:17:21,522
Even the skies have bowed
down in front of my love.

1908
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,391
Then why are you so heartless?

1909
02:17:25,403 --> 02:17:26,768
Please have mercy and let me go.

1910
02:17:26,938 --> 02:17:31,398
Let you go! For what? You
trapped me till now.

1911
02:17:31,576 --> 02:17:34,670
Now you are in my trap. I
was waiting for this day.

1912
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:37,371
What will you achieve
by destroying me?

1913
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:39,483
The amount of my destroyed life.

1914
02:17:39,651 --> 02:17:42,381
You needed my body for pleasure
and I needed your...

1915
02:17:42,554 --> 02:17:45,523
...support. That is why I never
married you but your wealth.

1916
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:48,750
Wealth! Take as much as you want.

1917
02:17:48,927 --> 02:17:50,792
Look at this! Look at this!

1918
02:18:12,484 --> 02:18:16,420
Here is our marriage certificate,
your freedom.

1919
02:18:16,988 --> 02:18:18,421
Thank you very much, Rita.

1920
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:20,924
Don't leave. I will be back.

1921
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:14,203
Rita, can I come in?

1922
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:28,257
I am sorry, Rita. You were right.

1923
02:19:36,434 --> 02:19:43,272
Murder! Murder! Help! Help! Murder!
Murder! Help! Help!

1924
02:19:43,441 --> 02:19:46,740
Catch her. She murdered
my madam. Catch her.

1925
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:48,572
Me! I did not do it.

1926
02:19:49,414 --> 02:19:50,847
Call the police immediately.
- Right away!

1927
02:19:51,015 --> 02:19:52,243
No! No! I have not murdered her.

1928
02:19:52,417 --> 02:19:53,384
We will come to know now.

1929
02:19:53,551 --> 02:19:54,518
I did not do anything.

1930
02:20:04,429 --> 02:20:06,590
Priya! Priya!

1931
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,367
Sanjay!

1932
02:20:09,534 --> 02:20:10,933
Priya, why did you do this?

1933
02:20:11,102 --> 02:20:13,263
Why did you take the
law in your hands?

1934
02:20:13,438 --> 02:20:14,598
Me?

1935
02:20:14,773 --> 02:20:16,604
Why did you kill Rita?

1936
02:20:18,009 --> 02:20:21,911
What are you saying, Sanjay?
I did not kill Rita.

1937
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,742
She was breathing her last,
when I reached up.

1938
02:20:24,916 --> 02:20:30,877
You did not kill Rita? Even I
didn't kill her. Then who did?

1939
02:20:35,393 --> 02:20:36,360
Sanjay!

1940
02:20:43,468 --> 02:20:44,594
Daddy!

1941
02:20:44,769 --> 02:20:45,793
My daughter.

1942
02:20:45,970 --> 02:20:47,369
Daddy!

1943
02:20:47,539 --> 02:20:48,506
Don't cry. Everything
will be alright.

1944
02:20:50,475 --> 02:20:52,375
Sir, I suspect Prem.

1945
02:20:52,544 --> 02:20:53,511
It can be possible.

1946
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:55,468
I will need your help.

1947
02:20:55,647 --> 02:20:57,444
Yes of course. Good night.

1948
02:20:57,615 --> 02:20:58,582
Good night.

1949
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:00,911
Let's go home, driver.

1950
02:21:06,424 --> 02:21:07,789
Why did you go to the jail?

1951
02:21:08,426 --> 02:21:11,589
To see Priya. She has killed Rita.

1952
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:12,787
Priya?

1953
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:14,398
Priya did it?

1954
02:21:14,566 --> 02:21:17,797
It's good, Prem. I am free
now as she was a problem.

1955
02:21:20,438 --> 02:21:21,700
Get me whisky.

1956
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:26,567
But sir, you had stopped drinking.

1957
02:21:27,445 --> 02:21:28,412
Get me the whisky!

1958
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:31,344
Brother, will you drink
in front of Grandma?

1959
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:35,681
I want to drink in front of her,
as it is a very happy day.

1960
02:21:35,854 --> 02:21:36,821
What?

1961
02:21:36,988 --> 02:21:42,585
Yes! Fools, both of them destroyed
themselves for me.

1962
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,557
What can be a better day for me?

1963
02:21:44,729 --> 02:21:46,788
Battu! What are you saying?

1964
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:50,762
Don't shout. If you don't like
all this, then you may go.

1965
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:53,836
You scoundrel, rascal. It would
be better if I was dead.

1966
02:21:54,005 --> 02:21:58,908
You bluff, you call yourself
Sanjay. Shame on you.

1967
02:21:59,077 --> 02:22:00,806
Wait Grandma, I am coming with you.

1968
02:22:03,982 --> 02:22:09,386
Devilal, Devilal,
you all may go too.

1969
02:22:09,554 --> 02:22:10,748
Come.

1970
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:19,895
Get me whisky.

1971
02:22:20,532 --> 02:22:23,262
Right away brother, right away.

1972
02:22:38,449 --> 02:22:39,416
Cheers!

1973
02:22:39,584 --> 02:22:40,551
Cheers!

1974
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:51,421
Prem, my brother, my friend,
had it not been for you...

1975
02:22:51,596 --> 02:22:53,621
...then I don't know where
would I have been.

1976
02:22:53,798 --> 02:22:56,926
Thank you, brother. At least
you called me yours.

1977
02:22:57,468 --> 02:23:01,700
How can I forget you? We
have a blood relation.

1978
02:23:02,407 --> 02:23:07,435
Does blood ever hide. But
I feel sorry for Rita.

1979
02:23:09,614 --> 02:23:12,447
Brother, you must have
gone to her place.

1980
02:23:12,617 --> 02:23:16,576
No! That is why the killer ran away.

1981
02:23:17,422 --> 02:23:20,255
I mean if Priya would have
seen me, then Rita would...

1982
02:23:20,425 --> 02:23:21,551
...have been saved.

1983
02:23:22,427 --> 02:23:26,261
Leave all that. Today is our day.

1984
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:28,262
Let's bring back the old memories.

1985
02:23:28,433 --> 02:23:30,264
Then should we start
the arrangements?

1986
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:34,337
Arrange in a way as if it is
the last day of our lives.

1987
02:23:34,505 --> 02:23:35,972
Never before.

1988
02:23:36,407 --> 02:23:37,374
Cheers!

02:23:37,542 --> 02:23:38,509

Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.

2018
02:27:28,406 --> 02:27:29,600
Will you see off the guests?

2019
02:27:29,974 --> 02:27:31,236
But, son. At least take him inside.

2020
02:27:31,409 --> 02:27:32,774
It's alright. I will
take him myself.

2021
02:27:33,411 --> 02:27:37,609
Goodnight folks, goodnight.
Goodnight. Bye. Bye.

2022
02:27:51,429 --> 02:27:53,590
I won't be duped this time.

2023
02:28:00,705 --> 02:28:04,266
Tomorrow morning the
headlines will read...

2024
02:28:04,442 --> 02:28:07,206
...T. K got burnt and died.

2025
02:28:08,946 --> 02:28:13,315
Dear brother, I know all the
duties of being a brother.

2026
02:28:13,851 --> 02:28:20,222
Performing your last rites is one
of them. I will fulfill that too.

2027
02:28:28,399 --> 02:28:32,358
Mr. Prem, you are under arrest.
Get up! Get up!

2028
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:40,434
Mr. Prem, stop.

2029
02:32:38,449 --> 02:32:41,282
You go this way, you go that
way. Come on, hurry up.

2030
02:33:19,423 --> 02:33:20,390
Brother.

2031
02:33:21,425 --> 02:33:23,586
Tell me, why did you kill Rita?

2032
02:33:23,761 --> 02:33:24,750
Brother, brother.

2033
02:33:24,929 --> 02:33:33,598
Speak, speak fast. Why did
you kill Rita? Say! Say!

2034
02:33:38,442 --> 02:33:39,807
Because of you, brother.

2035
02:33:40,444 --> 02:33:42,935
You distributed all my hard
earned money to the poor.

2036
02:33:43,447 --> 02:33:47,577
You always considered
me a dog, a scoundrel.

2037
02:33:47,751 --> 02:33:50,811
I even tried to kill you,
but you were saved.

2038
02:33:50,988 --> 02:33:53,684
Rita too favoured you. That's
the reason I killed her.

2039
02:33:53,857 --> 02:34:00,729
I killed her! I killed her! I
killed her! I hate you! I hate you!

2040
02:34:00,898 --> 02:34:02,229
Arrest Mr. Prem.

2041
02:34:12,409 --> 02:34:13,501
Thank you.

2042
02:34:15,412 --> 02:34:16,470
Thank you, sir.

2043
02:34:22,953 --> 02:34:24,978
Human, you are very lucky.

2044
02:34:25,422 --> 02:34:29,654
Sir, you? Oh King! I am very
depressed with this life...

2045
02:34:29,827 --> 02:34:31,954
...please free me.

2046
02:34:32,429 --> 02:34:34,260
You have paid the
debt for this body.

2047
02:34:34,431 --> 02:34:35,489
So, now what oh king?

2048
02:34:35,666 --> 02:34:38,692
You spend a peaceful life
with your sweetheart.

2049
02:34:38,869 --> 02:34:40,962
Go, you have our blessings.

2050
02:34:41,138 --> 02:34:43,436
Really! Thank you so much.

2051
02:34:43,607 --> 02:34:46,804
Sanjay, who are you talking to?

2052
02:34:46,977 --> 02:34:48,274
With the sage, he is here.

2053
02:34:48,445 --> 02:34:50,276
Sage. The sage from the world above.

2054
02:34:50,447 --> 02:34:51,471
Yes!
- Ok. Ok.

2055
02:34:51,649 --> 02:34:55,881
Sage, sage, sage, where is he?

2056
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:57,387
He is here.

2057
02:34:57,554 --> 02:34:59,021
Where?

2058
02:35:02,793 --> 02:35:04,761
Ghost! You were again
talking to a ghost.

2059
02:35:04,928 --> 02:35:06,555
No, Hanuman, No.

2060
02:35:06,730 --> 02:35:07,754
Ghost! Ghost.

2061
02:35:21,412 --> 02:35:22,379
Come, Grandma.

2062
02:35:25,082 --> 02:35:26,515
Sanjay, just listen.

2063
02:35:26,684 --> 02:35:27,651
Yes.

2064
02:35:28,886 --> 02:35:31,650
Sanjay, you gave everything
in charity.

2065
02:35:31,822 --> 02:35:33,255
When will you give my 10 rupees?

2066
02:35:33,424 --> 02:35:35,483
I will give it when we go up.

2067
02:35:35,659 --> 02:35:36,626
Up, with the sage?

2068
02:35:36,794 --> 02:35:37,761
Yes.

2069
02:35:37,928 --> 02:35:40,624
No! No! I am alright down
here. I don't need it.

2070
02:35:40,798 --> 02:35:42,265
Where are you going?

2071
02:35:42,433 --> 02:35:45,766
Where there is Ram and Sita,
there will be Hanuman.

2072
02:35:45,936 --> 02:35:47,267
I am your deity, Hanuman.

2073
02:35:47,438 --> 02:35:48,496
Come then.

2074
02:35:48,672 --> 02:35:49,639
Yes! Yes!

2075
02:35:53,444 --> 02:35:54,604
Ok! Brothers!

2076
02:35:55,446 --> 02:35:56,413
I will be coming too.

2077
02:35:59,883 --> 02:36:02,545
"Who is the one coming
in my dreams".

2078
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:05,883
"Who is the one residing
in my heart".

2079
02:36:06,857 --> 02:36:10,384
"Even the skies have bowed down".

2080
02:36:10,561 --> 02:36:13,621
"My love is bearing fruits"

2081
02:36:14,498 --> 02:36:17,467
"Who is the one coming
in my dreams".

2082
02:36:18,635 --> 02:36:20,933
"Who is the one residing
in my heart".

2083
02:36:22,406 --> 02:36:25,603
"Even the skies have bowed down".

2084
02:36:25,776 --> 02:36:28,939
