00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:27,240
Awvvw! Father and son
won't let me sleep, eh?

2
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,552
Good morning, son

3
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:04,644
Good morning

4
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,775
Enough?

5
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,209
Good morning, mom

6
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,210
Good morning, Sid

7
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:42,394
Do you need to raise your leg
this way to drink your coffee?

8
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:45,527
Not just my leg
My bum too!

9
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,305
Hari, what's happening in
the world of programming?

10
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:55,840
Well...google designed the new
Dan language they hope'll become...

11
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,641
...the next vernacular of
web programming like the Java script

12
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:01,182
Also there's a significant
difference between the-

13
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,253
Dad, do you understand
anything about programming?

14
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:06,621
No, I don't

15
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:08,516
Then, why discuss this?

16
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:12,618
Father, every time we talk,
energy is lost from our body

17
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,129
You talk less
You live more

18
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:15,688
Hey! Pinky boo

19
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:18,593
Morning! I'm fine

20
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:21,671
Dad's not really fine, though

21
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,501
Yes, I'll shower

22
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,766
Yeah, I did brush my teeth

23
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,905
Okay
See you

24
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:36,449
Ay! Sexual frustration!!

25
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,545
Will you please
get out from here?

26
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,759
Dad, that wasn't aim ed
at you...but me

27
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,458
Good morning, uncle

28
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,796
Good morning, Hari

29
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,210
Ma, where's my other slipper?

30
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,785
Did you see it?

31
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,450
Those are my sandals

32
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,398
- Hello
- Hey baby!

33
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,733
- How are you?
- I am good

34
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,862
Muah...!

35
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,998
Should I pull this behind?

36
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:58,569
I have cleaned my room

37
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,439
Tell Mini not to go in

38
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,240
Hari, are you coming...no?

39
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:08,383
Aren't you late?

40
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:10,412
Pathetic!

41
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:14,989
There is another strike
happening again on 19th

42
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:17,855
We just had 1 recently
Wonder what this is for!

43
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:22,956
This is to protest the hike
in petrol and diesel prices

45
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,039
Shall I make a note of writ and
petitions scheduled for the 19th?

46
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,709
I'll inform the clerk about
the hearings for that day too

47
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,507
Okay, Sara
Do that

48
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:40,579
I just hope all these strikes
change things for the good, eh?

49
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:44,384
'You're listening

'I knowl am late today, so-'

51
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:52,688
Ma'am, Sid has a great
fan following for his program

52
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:55,496
His nature is
so much like yours

53
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,732
Sara, when I was young
I used to be like him

54
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:01,638
I was so active in my college

55
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:05,076
'I intend talking about
some different people today'

56
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:09,079

to your offices and schools'

Yeah, it's true

71
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,817
Then what happened to Rohit?

72
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,120
No idea

00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,826

Can you move...?
You're blocking my view

80
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,977
Can't you just
call me Guru?

81
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:18,246
Salam, Suni will be
training under you

I hope you know Malayalam

00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,936

introduced to everyone?

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:38,666
Yes

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,300

00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,546
He is grandson to
the Queen of England

94
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,543
Has he taken off today?

95
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,611
No...he has set
a time for himself

96
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,553
10:30 sharp
He'll walk in

97
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:03,327
Sir, come let's go in this lift

Hi, I'm Simi

So? Get uP

00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,734
Simi! That's Hari's seat

107
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,999
That's my seat

108
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:42,042
Do you get it?
Don't ever sit on it

109
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,371
I'm sorry

110
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,742
Will someone from your house
come and take this away?

111
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:18,270
Hari, isn't it bad etiquette to
behave like this with girls?

112
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:21,174
Don't you have
any other work to do?

113
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,117
Don't bother, dear

114
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,017
You can use
my seat anytime

115
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:25,884
I won't worry

116
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,650
It's alright, Simi

117
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,337
I told you
I'll talk to you later!

118
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:16,104
Okay! Fine

119
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,778
Now hang up

120
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,280
Oh, sir is already here!

121
00:16:58,608 --> 00:16:59,848
Singh...?

122
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,988
Everybody was crying

123
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,256
Did Sam cry?

124
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,019
- No
- Lovely

125
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Simi...?

126
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:12,491
Happy scene, isn't it?

127
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:23,043
Hi Sam

128
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,204
How's doing?

00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,615
All set
Prathiba?

130
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:29,146
Everybody having a good time?

131
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:31,582
I know, Hari

132
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:34,624
There is a leaking pipe
in the bathroom

133
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,119
There is only half a bottle
of hand wash

134
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,156
But this is not a meeting
to discuss all that

135
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,063
Sorry...sorry

136
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:49,372
Punctuality will be appreciated

137
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,069
Please turn up on time
for our meetings

138
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,081
I have some good news
for the entire team

139
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,983
The function MRI data processing
software we had developed here...

140
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:06,455
...has been approved by both the US
and the European medical councils

141
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,456
- Wow!
- Wonderful

142
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,860
Peter called me just now

143
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:17,331
He has congratulated
the team members specially

144
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,030
We at Cabot should be
proud of ourselves!

145
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:22,108
Party...!

146
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:24,332
<i>Harm!</i>

147
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,446
Yes...we'll party tonight

148
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:28,447
No problem

149
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:34,247
There is a special mention about
Hari Krishnan who has designed it

150
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:41,427
In fact, Peter has asked Hari
to shift to our office in San Jose

151
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:45,665
Only later he remembered
Hari's fear of flying

152
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,561
Hari is scared to fly!
Hari has aerophobia, right?

153
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:52,640
But Hari, you'll have to attend
a conference in Trivand rum

154
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:53,572
Oh no!

155
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:56,568
Hari, only Trivandrum

156
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,045
It's not as if we are
sending you to USA!

157
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,240
But, sir...!

158
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,045
No 'buts' and please
don't call me 'sir'!

159
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,715
It is an important conference by
the Indian Medical Council

160
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,483
And the main topic of discussion will
be the program you have created!

161
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,120
And who better to explain
the program than the creator?

162
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,926
I'll let you know the dates

163
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,591
And remember this, Hari

164
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,726
Tonight's party
is in your honor

165
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,030
And you had better be there

166
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,639
Can I have 2 peach punch?

167
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:13,727
"You and I enjoy rhythms of this song
This song is just crazy bang on"

168
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:21,331
"For the first time, in your eyes I see
a sparkle bright and starry"

169
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:28,638
"Desires and dreams glow
let's go there and dream it now...!"

170
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:37,549
"Hey there's a fair, just be there,
grab a pair and just don't care to care"

171
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,162
Isn't that Hari
sitting over there?

172
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,698
What?

173
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,233
Isn't that Hari
sitting over there?

174
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,029
- Where...?
- Look behind you

175
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,171
That's my brother!

176
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,467
Yeah man!

177
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,800
Is that Hari's girlfriend?

178
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,340
Girlfriend...for Hari?

179
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:06,247
I will show you something
That girl will cry now

180
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,717
She will really cry

181
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:10,312
You want to bet?

182
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,051
I'll bet for 100 bucks
You will lose the bet

183
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:17,493
Watch out...Hari will leave now

184
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,865
Didn't I tell you?

185
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,635
See for yourself...he's gone

186
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:30,165
He's gone

187
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:31,606
You lost!

188
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,788
He has spoilt it

189
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:48,590
Has she taken a pledge to
cry every morning and night?

190
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:51,188
You are the only one left to cry

191
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:52,832
Scoundrel!

192
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,105
Stop it, he will
make you piss

193
00:21:58,228 --> 00:21:59,673
Move away...!

194
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:02,542
You are the team leader

195
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,636
Can't you do
something about this?

196
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,270
What can I do?

197
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,409
Last appraisal, didn't we all
give negative reports about him?

198
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:11,714
And look what happened!

199
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:16,121
Sam said the company does well
only because of this devil!

200
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,855
I'll give you a solution

201
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:24,297
lf we plan it out well
it will work out beautifully

202
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:25,595
What plan?

203
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:49,286
Son, for a change
Chicken...?

204
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:03,937
I had good fun

205
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:13,512
His dance was good

206
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:14,643
Hi uncle

207
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:16,723
- Join us for dinner
- Hi aunty

208
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:19,454
Hung ry-u!

209
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,799
Aunty, it's cold, is it
yesterday's food?

210
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:29,695
Where were you all?

211
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,466
We went for a party

212
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:33,841
At the club, Tanthri

213
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,476
Nice place

214
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:41,579
He was there
He was at the club too

215
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,276
At the club?!!!

216
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:46,252
Some office...some panymsomething

217
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,516
And he was
making a girl cry

218
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:50,956
God help me! I wonder
where he will end up...

219
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:54,428
...with all these curses
from so many girls

220
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:58,027
- Resignationm?
- Give it to me!

221
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,743
Hari?
Resign?

222
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:22,519
Huh?
Ream'?!

223
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:38,503
Priya, who told you this?

224
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,005
- I saw the letter
-I don't believe this

225
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,803
Will anyone give
a letter these days?

226
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,468
Guru, let him
just do anything

227
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,570
It is alright

228
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:47,045
Did I hear it right?

229
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:47,980
Yes

230
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,745
Don't get me
hyper for nothing

231
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,807
No...no

232
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,412
Then...all those candles I lit
as offerings weren't futile

233
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,148
Satish?
Prasad...?

234
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:56,588
Come here soon

235
00:26:56,647 --> 00:27:00,117
Pay him...all of you
Take this too

236
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,822
- Mine
-1 minute

237
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:02,920
Collect it from everybody

238
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:04,694
- Guru, move
- Did you pay him?

239
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,631
I've given your share also

240
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,102
Hari is resigning from the job

241
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:09,796
on, is n?

242
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,008
1,2,s,4,s

243
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,705
Give me your share
for Hari sir's resignation

244
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,447
Acho!

245
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:41,172
Let him go and
die somewhere

246
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,070
I want Hari's booth

247
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,870
Who wants his booth?

248
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,239
Let him get lost

249
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,571
Such an egoistic person

250
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:50,081
Have you seen his attitude?

251
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:50,912
Fool!

252
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:54,851
He and his stupid pair of glasses
and a bag he carries around...!

253
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,822
Exactly!

254
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:06,960
Are you sure?

255
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:10,195
Hari...are you sure?

256
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:11,970
Yes

257
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:16,099
Prathiba?

258
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,073
Come inside

259
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,904
Yeah, right away

260
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,682
Come in, Prathiba

261
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:32,819
Move...move

262
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,303
What is it?

263
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,607
Can we celebrate?

264
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,548
No...?

265
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,168
Which blessed time
did you conceive him?

266
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:19,605
Ifl remember right, I wasn't
the only person involved in it

267
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,309
Why can't these American
companies work all 7 days?

268
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,584
Hari, aren't you going
to see the doctor?

269
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:33,192
Today is Saturday

270
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:36,619
As if you need to
remind him about that!

271
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,997
Hari?
Who is this?

272
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,296
Prathiba...let me see

273
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,641
Hari, it's for you

274
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:06,994
Hello...?
I'm Hari's mother

275
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,197
Hari is unavailable

276
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:11,391
Prathiba...?

277
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:16,732
Okay, on the 19th

278
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,802
I'll tell him about it

279
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:28,047
Hari, your train ticket for
the 19th is confirmed

280
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,744
Prathibha just called

281
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,757
I think it is for Trivandrum

282
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,888
Trivand rum?
I wonder what for!

283
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,943
Welcome to our Saturdays

284
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,984
Oooo ooh!
Cheeeeeers...!

285
00:30:59,306 --> 00:31:02,310
Why can't you wait for the others
before you start celebrating?

286
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:03,912
Dad will be here soon

287
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,480
We should have
invited Hari as well

288
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:07,784
Oh Yeah! You couldn't
think of anyone else?!

289
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:10,260
Can you even think of
our plight without him?

290
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:10,989
Then what?!

291
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:14,192
His programs are our only
reasons for our survival

292
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:15,461
Salam is right

293
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:20,469
Hey, forget this program of
touring the world and get the food

294
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:22,072
But I find him very cute

295
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,871
What about my-

296
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,910
Go, get that
Must be dad

297
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:30,848
One day he will look at me
and I'll kiss him th-

298
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,818
Prathiba...?

299
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,116
Hi...Hari
Come in

300
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,181
My ticket

301
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,955
You didn't have to
take this trouble

302
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,996
I would've sent it
through Mani

303
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:43,428
It's okay
1 minute

304
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,299
Hari, want to join?

305
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:53,033
You said it may be difficult
This is the progra-

306
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:56,377
What happened?
Didn't get kissed, eh?

307
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:08,992
- Hari?
- Yes, doctor

308
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:11,226
How is everything?

309
00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:12,990
Everything is fine

310
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:15,756
Do you have
anything to tell me?

311
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:21,904
No

312
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:10,220
Are you off
to Trivandrum?

313
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:12,889
What ifl am?

314
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,596
Can you travel alone?

315
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,193
Get out of my bed

316
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:18,555
Get out

317
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:27,299
Can you get me 'poli'?
These sweet pancakes

318
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:29,001
Get me 2 packets

319
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,523
Enough?

320
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:43,183
Enough...enough

321
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:44,928
What time is the train?

322
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:45,586
12:30

323
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:47,186
Why are you leaving so soon?

324
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,526
Should I drop you, Hari?

325
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:50,362
Ma, I'll be late

326
00:33:50,924 --> 00:33:52,597
You want to get dropped?

327
00:33:57,464 --> 00:33:58,374
Bye

328
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,102
Safe journey, son

329
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,998
Where are you going?

330
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:03,700
Did I ask you where
you are going?

331
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:58,431
Sir...?

332
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:05,275
Madam, this is his berth

333
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:07,402
Please move
to your own berth

334
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:09,878
Thank you, sir

335
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:19,287
What is it, Moid heen?

336
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,292
When?

337
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:31,831
What do I do now?

338
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:53,280
Sir...please help me
Lend me a hand

339
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:54,858
Sir, what happened?

340
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,553
Do you want
water to drink?

341
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:57,686
No

342
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,492
Please help him

343
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:02,593
Please turn off the light, will you?!

344
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:09,270
I must go back home
My wife has been taken ill

345
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:10,933
Which is the next station?

346
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:12,511
I'll call the ticket officer

347
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:23,652
Sir, over there

348
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,629
We'll reach Paravoor in 5 minutes
You can get down there

349
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,393
- Okay?
- Thank you, sir

350
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,719
It's alright

351
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:26,652
Careful...watch your step

352
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,066
Let's sit here

353
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:26,010
Move aside, man!

354
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:51,475
Moidheen's call kind of left me
totally weak and shattered

355
00:41:51,738 --> 00:41:56,687
I usually don't leave her alone
like this and travel by myself

356
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:59,515
Nothing to worry

357
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,458
Moidheen always makes
a mountain out of a mole hill

358
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:08,165
- I left my bag in that train
- What?

359
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:09,900
I must reach Trivandrum-

360
00:42:09,956 --> 00:42:11,867
These are small fish
Do you want some?

361
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:14,064
No, my wife doesn't
know to cook this fish

362
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,401
- Sir?
- Yes

363
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:18,102
When is the train
to Kozhikode?

364
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,039
To Kozhikode, huh?

365
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:24,674
There are many trains
But they won't stop here

366
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:26,912
I left my bag in that train

367
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:29,680
Why didn't you
go in that train?

368
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:30,813
L...his-

369
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:32,619
How can you
be so careless?

370
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:33,658
What do I do now?

371
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,456
Why are you asking me?

372
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:39,556
Give a written complaint
to the person seated in there

373
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:43,762
Train number, coach number,
seat number and color of your bag

374
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,135
If you are lucky
you may get it

375
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,679
There is a train from
Kollam to Kozhikode

376
00:42:55,872 --> 00:43:00,582
But, don't you have
to go to Trivand rum?

377
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,556
I will ensure you are
safe before I go

378
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:13,661
Hello...bro?

379
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,109
We need to
go to Kollam

380
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,801
Kollam?

381
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,041
Rs 1000

382
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:26,275
Kollam...not Coimbatore

383
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:29,019
I will give you
maxim um Rs 250

384
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:32,747
You can go to Kollam
or Coimbatore

385
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,053
But you need to
pay for the auto

386
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:38,821
There's a strike now

387
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:40,660
I won't get a passenger
on my way back

388
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,994
Let me sleep in peace

389
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:45,060
It is okay
I'll pay him

390
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,627
Let's get going

391
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,039
Come on, get in

392
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,173
Get in

393
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,290
Sir, get in soon

394
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:24,039
You can get down here

395
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,013
Walk straight ahead and
you'll reach the railway station

396
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:27,980
Get down here?

397
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,778
Did you agree to
drop us midway?

398
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:31,716
We won't get down
Stan the vehicle

399
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:33,777
The road that side is all broken

400
00:44:33,844 --> 00:44:35,653
It is just walkable
distance from here

401
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:37,784
- You can easily walk it up
- How can you say that?

402
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:38,859
It is alright

403
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:40,223
Let us get down here

404
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:43,031
I will pay you only
half the amount

405
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:50,163
I'll pay him

406
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:51,069
No need

407
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:52,802
I've kept it ready

408
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:58,007
Here is the full amount

409
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,217
Madam, shall I take leave?
Good night

410
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:03,753
Get lost!

411
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:19,169
Since it is a strike,
the trains will be delayed

412
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,102
The exact time
can't be specified

413
00:45:25,232 --> 00:45:31,148
Shall we go try at
the KSRTC bus stand?

414
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:44,721
We've been waiting

415
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:45,696
What strike?

416
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:49,327
Govt vehicle is for
common man to travel in

417
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,268
Bro, I'll give you the keys

418
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,967
You can drive it
for the common man

419
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:55,906
It's such a hassle
for so many people

420
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,275
Bro, when is the bus
to Kozhikode?

421
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:03,010
What will we do stranded like this
in the middle of the night?

422
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:04,210
Do something soon

423
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:05,048
Brother...?

424
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:08,055
Bothering us
with the strike

425
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:10,185
Bro...bus to Kozhikode...?

426
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,124
There will be
a bus to Alapuzha

427
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:16,995
Get onto that, you might get a bus
to Kozhikode from there

428
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,125
You have to
give us an answer

429
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:25,169
We've been waiting
here for ages

430
00:46:30,068 --> 00:46:31,069
Let us sit here

431
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:50,360
It will take a while
for the bus to come

432
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:51,959
Sit down

433
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:12,283
In all this confusion
I lost my phone

434
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:14,259
Do you know
your number?

435
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:15,487
Let me call your number

436
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:20,299
94469...

437
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:31,242
...63543

438
00:47:41,477 --> 00:47:44,014
It says 'this number
does not exist'

439
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:46,058
Did I give you a wrong number?

440
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:48,253
Anyway, it is lost!

441
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:51,890
Tell me your
landline number

442
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:56,956
Residence number is

443
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:16,220
No sound at all
I hear only some noises

444
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:19,325
I've forgotten that as well
It is afaulty line

445
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:22,024
I even forgot to
give a complaint

446
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,797
It's okay...anyway
I'm going there, no?

447
00:48:25,992 --> 00:48:27,801
Is there any other number?

448
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,233
Moidheen's number

449
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:32,243
Ever since I started
using this mobile phone...

450
00:48:32,332 --> 00:48:35,211
...l can't memorize
any of the numbers

451
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:44,345
98460332-88

452
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:49,584
Or 88332
Try both

453
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,625
Aww...the battery has run down

454
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:03,905
Hey, can I have the phone?

455
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,843
Which phone?

456
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,578
Your phone

457
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,608
I don't have a phone

458
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:11,116
What?

459
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:13,016
I do not have a phone

460
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,324
What did they tell you
when they called?

461
00:49:23,453 --> 00:49:27,196
They said my wife is having
severe breathing difficulty

462
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:30,538
When I suggest
going to the hospital...

463
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:32,198
...she never listens

464
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,004
She will be fine

465
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:44,575
Yes, nothing would
have happened

466
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,181
What is your name?

467
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:54,522
Hari Krishnan

468
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:02,365
We met at Shoranur

469
00:50:02,462 --> 00:50:03,634
She is Narayani

470
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,308
But she prefers to
be called Nani

471
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:08,710
Where are you from?

472
00:50:09,202 --> 00:50:10,112
Ernakulam

473
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,454
- What is the time?
-4:50

474
00:50:20,547 --> 00:50:21,617
What is the time?

475
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:22,592
4:50

476
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,628
AiVoH

477
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,359
What happened?

478
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,377
What is it?

479
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,742
1, 2 or shower?

480
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,077
Huh...?

481
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,587
Do you want to pee,
crap or take a shower?

482
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,648
Two

483
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,387
Rs 2/-

484
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,466
- Give me coins
- I don't have any

485
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,005
Here's the balance

486
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,065
Yuck!

487
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:31,659
It is all over there

488
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:32,736
What?

489
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:34,237
Crap

490
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:38,336
What crap is he
talking about?

491
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:02,265
Hari...?

492
00:52:02,323 --> 00:52:08,296
In here...get in, careful

493
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:18,583
Stop...stop!

494
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:21,080
I must get in too

495
00:52:31,755 --> 00:52:34,167
Stop staring and climb up

496
00:52:34,257 --> 00:52:36,828
Get in both of you

497
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:46,115
Oh no...break down

498
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:47,739
What's the problem?

499
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,216
Axle of the bus is broken

500
00:52:49,273 --> 00:52:50,251
We can't go now

501
00:52:50,308 --> 00:52:51,343
Will another bus come?

502
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:53,184
Who knows! You can go
if one comes along

503
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:55,657
- How can you say that?
- Let me see

504
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:00,396
What do we do now?

505
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:03,159
How can you leave us
stranded in a place like this?

506
00:53:03,288 --> 00:53:05,097
You have to arrange
another vehicle

507
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,192
We need to reach
Kozhikode immediately

508
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:08,863
May be you can
board a ship

509
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:11,601
Walk straight that way
to reach the backwaters

510
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:14,209
Axle of the bus
is under repair

511
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,280
Can anything be done?

512
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:18,246
Shall we walk that way?

513
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:24,445
Come, let's go

514
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:39,895
It's pitch dark here

515
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:46,575
Oh! You have
a torch with you!

516
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:47,636
Do you use it always?

517
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:50,513
Not always...only when it's dark

518
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,394
How long do we walk...?

519
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:08,367
Where will we reach
if we walk like this?

520
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:09,698
Absolutely...no clue!

521
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,203
Let's see

522
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,220
What happened?

523
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:32,824
- Brother...?
- Yes?

524
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:35,797
If we cross this lake
can we get any vehicle?

525
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:36,729
Today?

526
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:40,599
You may be able to get
into an ambulance

527
00:54:40,893 --> 00:54:43,965
Can you take us across?

528
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:45,501
This is not such a boat

529
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:46,838
I use this for fishing

530
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:48,003
You can't get onto this

531
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:51,272
Brother, please help us
We'll also help you fish

532
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,679
No, that won't work out

533
00:54:52,738 --> 00:54:56,481
I'll pay you something, comrade

534
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:58,513
The old man
has got brains

535
00:54:58,612 --> 00:54:59,852
The 3 of you can get in

536
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:00,584
Come on

537
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:02,388
Vasu, loosen
the mooring rope

538
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:03,359
I'm not coming

539
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:04,020
Okay, don't!

540
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:06,026
Who asked you
to come along?

541
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,263
Brother, how heavy is this boat?

542
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:12,029
What?

543
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:14,261
How heavy is the boat?

544
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:15,704
I have not weighed it yet!

545
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:16,707
What is it?

546
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:18,971
Will it sink ifl also get in?

547
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:21,612
What a pity!

548
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:27,404
"Was the lonely path feeling demure?

Yes

554
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:08,761
My father used this for
fishing and now it's mine

555
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:14,064
Hey! Catch hold of this

556
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:15,498
What is this?

557
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:23,506
Something is pulling it!

558
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,606
Must be a fish

559
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,109

Toddy...!

569
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:45,126
You can get yummy tapioca
and fish curry here

570
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:48,029
You can wait here
We'll both go and get it

571
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,036
I'm coming too
I'm really hungry

572
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:50,866
Huh?

00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,731

Shall we sit here?

578
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,755
Is this a television soap?

579
00:59:16,855 --> 00:59:18,493
Or a family pack?

580
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,778
What do you have?

581
00:59:36,842 --> 00:59:37,650
Toddy

582
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:38,620
I mean, food to eat

583
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,554
Like tapioca and fish
or some such thing

584
00:59:40,646 --> 00:59:42,091
Oh...that kind of food?

585
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:47,996
There is fish egg, fish fry,
small fish, tapioca

586
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:51,934
And then there are
white rice pancakes

587
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:53,994
I'll have a plate of
tapioca with fish gravy

588
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:55,539
Sir, what about you?

589
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,840
Okay, 2 plates of
tapioca with fish gravy

590
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,570
Sir, what would
you like to have?

591
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,010
I don't want anything

592
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:03,906
Why is that so?

593
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:05,676
Don't force him

594
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:08,049
Brother, please serve us fast

595
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:12,881
Rajesh...2 plates of
tapioca with fish gravy

596
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:15,592
Where are you from?

597
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:17,958
Where are you going to?

598
01:00:18,887 --> 01:00:20,560
We are on our way
to Kozhikode

599
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:22,830
Oh! I see

600
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:27,597
To be frank, we ended up here
because of the strike today

601
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:32,642
I was wondering how
you found this rotten shop

602
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:45,258
Sit down

603
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:48,597
My dear boys,
take your seat

604
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:52,628
You just forgot me, isn't it?

605
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,135
You don't come here these days

606
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,297
Or have you all
stopped drinking?

607
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,132
What would you
like to eat?

608
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,201
There is fish egg, fish fry
and head fry

609
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,610
You know what
we like to eat

610
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,780
So, I'll serve you all now

611
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:11,713
I first met my wife-

612
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:12,722
Sorry, what?

613
01:01:13,245 --> 01:01:18,627
I first met my wife
in a toddy shop like this

614
01:01:19,185 --> 01:01:22,098
She was heading
a strike against alcoholism

615
01:01:22,155 --> 01:01:25,102
And I was doing the same
for the laborers here

616
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,935
Our beliefs were
so opposite

617
01:01:29,029 --> 01:01:31,908
Like how they say,
'opposites attract'!

618
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,020
Go...go

619
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:48,685
Okay, I'll go

620
01:02:09,806 --> 01:02:12,446
Those bike-boys have agreed
to drop us till Ernakulam

621
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:13,486
okay

622
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,165
Where are you off to?

623
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,727
It is a short cut

624
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,230
Short cut?

625
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,744
The bike with the girl
is not in sight

626
01:03:08,803 --> 01:03:10,248
They are just
a little ahead of us

627
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:12,375
We will catch up
with them soon

628
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:19,280
I can't see them

629
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:22,419
They are just ahead
Don't stress yourself

630
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:28,867
There he is!

631
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:29,901
Stop the bike

632
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:31,868
Stop...l say!

633
01:03:37,533 --> 01:03:41,140
'12 miles more...'

634
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:52,924
Hello?

635
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:55,255
What is it?

636
01:03:56,454 --> 01:03:59,264
Whaaat?
He hasn't reached?

637
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:02,069
Are you sure?

638
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,433
Maybe he didn't leave at all

639
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:12,513
Let me find out
from Hari's mother

640
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:15,080
okay

641
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,281
Hello?

642
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:25,858
- Aunty
- Hi, Prathiba

643
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:29,833
He left quite early yesterday

644
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:32,462
Please reduce
the volume, Sree

645
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,032
He hasn't reached?

646
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,306
No way he'll go
anywhere else

647
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,004
Are you sure?

648
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:47,076
Can you check again?

649
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:49,416
Okay

650
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,015
What is the matter?

651
01:04:55,249 --> 01:04:58,230
Hari hasn't reached
Trivand rum yet

652
01:04:59,887 --> 01:05:01,195
Nani...?

653
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,302
Nani...?

654
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:13,980
Hari...?!

655
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:22,682
Her bag

656
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,378
What happened?

657
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,915
The strap's broken

658
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,120
What do you
think of yourself?

659
01:06:00,186 --> 01:06:02,723
You don't have to show off this
over confidence all the time

660
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:05,561
Imagine if something
had happened...!

661
01:06:05,658 --> 01:06:09,071
This over smartness
is nothing to be proud of!

662
01:06:13,566 --> 01:06:16,137
I wonder where we are

663
01:06:23,276 --> 01:06:26,257
Thank goodness!
Get down

664
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:28,994
This is awful

665
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,758
I wonder why IT professionals and
cops are not affected by the strike

666
01:06:31,986 --> 01:06:32,987
Hey...!

667
01:06:33,187 --> 01:06:34,530
Just come here with me

668
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,693
What is it?

669
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:38,237
- He hasn't reached
- Who?

670
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:39,471
Hari?

671
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:41,970
Are you sure?

672
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:45,168
Does Sam know about this?

673
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,510
It was your idea
to send him there

674
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:49,276
Go and tell him yourself

675
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:51,245
What do
we do now?

676
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,616
What do you think
we can we do?!

677
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:17,603
- It flows down from there
- So beautiful!

678
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:24,820
Let's jump into it

679
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:26,784
I will jump into it now

680
01:07:30,415 --> 01:07:32,088
It's lovely

681
01:07:56,776 --> 01:08:01,350
Hari, aren't you coming?

682
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:12,330
What pure water!

683
01:08:12,393 --> 01:08:14,464
We can even drink it

684
01:09:22,202 --> 01:09:24,546
What is the distance
we've covered now?

685
01:09:24,604 --> 01:09:26,311
What distance
are you referring to?

686
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,750
Furlong, kilometer or
'Kaadham' (5 miles)

687
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:31,346
Like how people in
the olden days called it?

688
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:35,723
- Doesn't Kaadhu mean 'ears'?
- This is 'kaadham'

689
01:09:35,782 --> 01:09:37,784
Haven't you heard this saying...

690
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:43,301
...'Even if Mecca is 1000 'kaadham' away,
it will still be fresh in the heart?'

691
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:46,770
It is 16 kms as per
today's calculations

692
01:09:46,828 --> 01:09:47,670
Wrong!

693
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:48,605
What?

694
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:52,735
Mecca is just
4600 kms from here

695
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,643
1000 'kaadham'
is 16,000 kms

696
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,240
Shall we go?

697
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:01,844
Yes, but where to?

698
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:04,256
We must go north, isn't it?

699
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,327
How do we know
where north is?

700
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:08,726
Sun is not visible either

701
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,768
Why are you carrying
a screw driver and such stuff?

702
01:10:37,248 --> 01:10:38,818
North is that way

703
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:42,427
What is this?
Man vs wild?

704
01:10:47,293 --> 01:10:48,397
What does that mean?

705
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,739
There is a man called 'Bear Grylls'
who hosts a survival reality show on TV

706
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:55,935
Do you think
this is a game?

707
01:10:56,903 --> 01:11:00,009
Do you think this is a place to
vent out your personal grudges?

708
01:11:00,072 --> 01:11:02,814
If you don't know,
everyone in the U.S values...

709
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:05,549
...Hari's expertise
more than any of you

710
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:07,682
They even value him
more than me!

711
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,886
If anything happens to him
jobs are at stake

712
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:16,694
Did you try
calling his home?

713
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:20,295
They've been informed that Hari
got down at the Paravoor station

714
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:22,500
And his bag has
reached Trivandrum

715
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:24,041
Paravoor is close by, isn't it?

716
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:26,669
This is Paravoor, near Kollam

717
01:11:26,735 --> 01:11:28,476
Do you mean Quilon?

718
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:32,909
I don't care Paravoor or Parabikulam
You better go and find him right now

719
01:11:32,975 --> 01:11:34,454
How will you go now?

720
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:36,350
Appan has his bike, Bullet

721
01:11:36,478 --> 01:11:37,821
I have my 2 wheeler too

722
01:11:37,914 --> 01:11:40,053
So, what are you
waiting for? Go...!

723
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,762
Or you wait!
I'm coming

724
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:51,935
Sir, will you be
able to climb this?

725
01:11:52,696 --> 01:11:56,473
I have climbed so many
hills and mountains

726
01:12:18,156 --> 01:12:20,898
Stop there...l say!

727
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:24,974
Stop running

728
01:12:31,037 --> 01:12:32,641
Don't run

729
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:34,618
Run

730
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:38,716
Stop there

731
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:42,659
It's the cops...!
Run for your life

732
01:12:45,685 --> 01:12:47,494
Sir, what is it?

733
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:52,037
Why did he run?

734
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:57,704
Stop!

735
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,984
I know you must
be wearing one

736
01:13:39,444 --> 01:13:41,185
Are you wearing one?

737
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:44,187
Are you wearing one?

738
01:13:44,248 --> 01:13:45,158
What?

739
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:46,092
Underwear!

740
01:13:46,818 --> 01:13:48,661
lam wearing a boxer

741
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,701
Show him what he is
supposed to do

742
01:13:56,962 --> 01:13:58,100
Anish...!

743
01:13:59,798 --> 01:14:02,176
Get up and
go stand there

744
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:03,110
Remove it

745
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:04,648
I haven't done anything

746
01:14:04,704 --> 01:14:05,944
Why did you run?

747
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:06,847
Anish

748
01:14:07,172 --> 01:14:09,675
I know what to do

749
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:13,751
What is it?

750
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:16,827
You should reply
only to my questions

751
01:14:18,085 --> 01:14:19,723
What is in this bag?

752
01:14:20,253 --> 01:14:21,459
It is-

753
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:22,666
Anish...!

754
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:25,199
Give it to me

755
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,151
Sir, I think he is
a medical representative

756
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,522
ls it so?

757
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:51,123
I'll kick you

758
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,222
Get up! You morons!

759
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:57,669
Remove it...you rep!

760
01:15:10,107 --> 01:15:14,852
Someone told us we can reach
Kottayam if we come this way

761
01:15:14,946 --> 01:15:20,089
Anish...can you
reach Kottayam this way?

762
01:15:20,184 --> 01:15:23,097
<i>You can reach Munnar,
Them, Kambham...</i>

763
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:26,158
...and finally the Bay of Bengal!

764
01:15:26,258 --> 01:15:28,135
You are over doing it

765
01:15:31,163 --> 01:15:32,198
Who is he?

766
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:34,635
His son

767
01:15:37,002 --> 01:15:40,176
Who are you?
His daughter?

768
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:44,346
- I am-
- Yes

769
01:15:47,313 --> 01:15:50,783
How will you reach
Kozhikode today?

770
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:54,696
Just like how we reached
this far from Kollam

771
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:00,904
There is a vehicle going
to Kottayam from here

772
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:04,034
Do you want
to travel in it?

773
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:16,713
Sorry!!

774
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:39,006
Is there any news
about your brother?

775
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:41,944
No, dude

776
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:44,643
What actually happened?

777
01:16:44,775 --> 01:16:47,221
He went on some
official purpose

778
01:16:47,277 --> 01:16:49,723
Some conference
or some such thing

779
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:51,790
But he is missing now

780
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:53,919
What will you do now?

781
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:58,791
My dad has called
for the police and army

782
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,394
Let the police
and cops just wait

783
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,665
Why don't we try to
find him before they do?

784
01:17:06,398 --> 01:17:07,809
How do we do that?

785
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:17,320
- How do we go from here?
- I will be right back

786
01:17:19,378 --> 01:17:22,382
I truly believe in
the Indian govt.

787
01:17:22,448 --> 01:17:25,657
Allegations against me
is a major conspiracy

788
01:17:25,752 --> 01:17:30,701
My party and I believe
I can prove it too

789
01:17:30,757 --> 01:17:34,170
Sir, if the court proves othenuise
will you approach the High court?

790
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:37,333
The court won't
prove otherwise

791
01:17:37,397 --> 01:17:38,876
I'm very sure of that

792
01:17:38,933 --> 01:17:41,413
Did you find it difficult to come here
because of the strike today?

793
01:17:41,468 --> 01:17:43,175
I was at home till yesterday

794
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:47,309
I'm a social worker and
these strikes don't bother me

795
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,912
Where are you going to now?

796
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,318
- Who is this?
- I don't know, sir!

797
01:17:54,816 --> 01:17:56,796
I am on my way
to Ernakulam

798
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:58,957
Bishop from Kalaipurackal
is in the hospital

799
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:00,397
I'll visit him
and get back

800
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:01,400
We are 3 of us

801
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:03,494
Can you take us
along with you?

802
01:18:06,429 --> 01:18:08,067
Thank you, sir

803
01:18:12,135 --> 01:18:17,244
This is the 1st time I am
travelling in a minister's car

804
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:20,016
Where is your place
in Kozhikode?

805
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:21,021
Ram anatukara

806
01:18:21,078 --> 01:18:22,819
Isn't that in
the district of Malapuram?

807
01:18:22,913 --> 01:18:23,516
It is the border

808
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:26,125
We need to reach
Kozhikode immediately

809
01:18:26,183 --> 01:18:27,526
That's why I-

810
01:18:28,819 --> 01:18:30,924
Sir, road is blocked
towards that side

811
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,227
So can't we go there?

812
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,428
No, sir

813
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:37,803
- What is your name?
- Narayani

814
01:18:37,896 --> 01:18:39,842
- What about yours?
- Hari Krishnan

815
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:41,036
What do you do?

816
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:43,010
FPGA Architect

817
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:45,103
Oh, our future!

818
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,274
What about you?

819
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:50,047
I'm a social welfare trainee
with a NGO in Trivand rum

820
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,177
Which NGO?

821
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:53,189
- Aren't you the health minister?
- Yes

822
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:55,122
Have you gone near
the Mullassery canal?

823
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,352
It is so polluted!

824
01:18:56,416 --> 01:19:00,193
It has been cleaned
Don't you read the papers?

825
01:19:02,022 --> 01:19:04,434
Sir, road is again
blocked this way

826
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:09,400
Turn the car back to Pala
We can see the bishop later

827
01:19:09,462 --> 01:19:10,463
The 3 of us...?

828
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:13,072
What do we do about them?

829
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,943
We can drop them
at the next junction

830
01:19:18,072 --> 01:19:19,380
How do we go from there?

831
01:19:19,473 --> 01:19:23,353
Arrange a police jeep
for them to go

832
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:30,823
I wonder how long
we have to walk

833
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:45,536
You asked stupid questions
and spoilt the chance of a lift

834
01:19:45,634 --> 01:19:48,410
Leave it...it's okay

835
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:51,108
Hari is safe

836
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,584
We've reached Ernakulam

837
01:19:52,642 --> 01:19:54,883
Now he can go
home by walk easily

838
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,556
We were told
a vehicle will be here

839
01:19:58,648 --> 01:20:00,252
- What for?
- For us to travel in

840
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:02,820
- For you to travel in?
- Didn't the minister inform you?

841
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:04,264
Minister?

842
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,100
Which minister?

843
01:20:06,156 --> 01:20:07,157
The Health minister

844
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,329
We travelled in
his car till here

845
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:11,067
How are you
related to the minster?

846
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:13,335
He was the minster's mentor

847
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:16,569
There is a vehicle here
but it is under repair

848
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:19,979
If it starts, I can
drop you at the airport

849
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:45,172
He has started it

850
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,079
You are really smart

851
01:20:54,408 --> 01:20:56,217
Shall we take leave?

852
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,261
Aren't you coming along?

853
01:21:13,462 --> 01:21:15,237
Hari, aren't you
going back home?

854
01:21:15,297 --> 01:21:16,970
No, I'll come
along with you

855
01:21:17,032 --> 01:21:18,409
To Kozhikode?

856
01:21:33,984 --> 01:21:35,463
You can get down here

857
01:21:35,519 --> 01:21:38,227
Convey my regards
to the minister

858
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:39,960
We are really grateful

859
01:21:40,056 --> 01:21:41,535
Sure...carry on

860
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,469
Sir, please wait for me

861
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:47,406
I'm coming
along with you

862
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,306
It's gone

863
01:21:49,968 --> 01:21:51,379
That's also gone

864
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:55,981
Where are you all off to?

865
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:56,985
Kozhikode

866
01:21:57,276 --> 01:21:58,983
I am off to Chaavakaatu

867
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:02,257
Day before yesterday,
I've been blessed with a son

868
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:05,089
I just landed from Dubai

869
01:22:05,585 --> 01:22:08,031
There is a car
coming to pick me up

870
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,566
But due to the strike
it is stuck somewhere

871
01:22:10,656 --> 01:22:13,967
I tried the railway station too
There are no trains, either

872
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,438
I wonder when there will be
an end to these strikes

873
01:22:16,496 --> 01:22:17,531
Walk faster

874
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:21,010
Man, didn't I tell you
we need not go today?

875
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:25,477
Every Indian citizen has
the right to pull in a strike

876
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:28,645
So does the Indian constitution,
allow a citizen have the rig ht to...

877
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:31,188
...obstruct 'right of movement'
of a fellow citizen?

878
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:34,192
You are right but nobody
is seeing it as an obstruction

879
01:22:34,248 --> 01:22:35,693
It calls for a holiday and
hence a celebration

880
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,752
ls there any chance
of getting a vehicle?

881
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,594
Strike allover today

882
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,725
I wonder if waiting here
will be of any use

883
01:22:41,822 --> 01:22:43,768
We can only hope

884
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,139
Some car is coming

885
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,370
Stop...stop...!

886
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:54,674
We came here
before you did

887
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,613
What difference
does that make?

888
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:58,811
Get in soon

889
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:02,079
We have to go urgently

890
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:04,283
Everyone has their urgency

- What do you do, Hari?
- I am FPGA architect

909
01:25:46,787 --> 01:25:49,495
ls there any technology
to catch fish easily?

910
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:57,408
Let us rest for a while
and then continue

911
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:03,278
Sit down

912
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:10,223
Fooled you...!

913
01:26:11,681 --> 01:26:13,661
From where did you get it?

914
01:26:14,484 --> 01:26:16,327
Where did you run off to?

915
01:26:16,686 --> 01:26:18,893
How can you leave
the child alone like this?

916
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,629
I was busy with some work
That's why I didn't realize

917
01:26:21,691 --> 01:26:24,729
Go to your mother

918
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:28,969
Looks like you all have
travelled a long away!

919
01:26:29,032 --> 01:26:29,840
We-

920
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,971
Come with me
I live close by

921
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:33,276
Come with me

922
01:26:33,371 --> 01:26:35,442
Come

923
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,927
Take this balloon

924
01:26:54,593 --> 01:26:56,334
Where are you off to?

925
01:26:56,429 --> 01:26:59,467
We need to go
to Calicut immediately

926
01:26:59,565 --> 01:27:02,307
My wife is not
keeping well

927
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:06,340
Fuel is low

928
01:27:06,405 --> 01:27:09,443
Petrol and diesel
is hard to get now

929
01:27:09,576 --> 01:27:14,889
I will drop you till
where this van takes us

930
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:19,597
What is your name?

931
01:27:19,686 --> 01:27:24,726
I am Vyom kesh, my wife Lajju
and my daughter Pyali

932
01:27:27,595 --> 01:27:31,008
Do you know in the novel by
Sharadendhu Bendhodhadhyaya...

933
01:27:31,099 --> 01:27:34,672
...there is a detective
character with your name?

934
01:27:34,736 --> 01:27:35,874
- Is it so?
- Yes

935
01:27:35,938 --> 01:27:38,817
Detective?
With my name?

936
01:27:40,576 --> 01:27:42,021
I swearl didn't know

937
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,317
Daddy, you're great

938
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:47,526
That Vyomkesh may have
been a great hero

939
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:50,928
But this is the 3rd strike
ever since I came here

940
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,998
Only yesterday, we decided
to stay back here

941
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:56,593
Have you been
here for a month?

942
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:59,537
Actually more than a month!

943
01:27:59,762 --> 01:28:02,572
More than 45 days

944
01:28:03,768 --> 01:28:07,113
You seem to
have travelled a lot

945
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:07,974
Yes, we have

946
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:10,813
Are there strikes
in other places too?

947
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:13,350
No

948
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:17,391
What are the places
you've visited?

949
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:23,099
We are visiting
all the temples

950
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:26,362
My wife doesn't know Tamil
She is from Kutch

951
01:28:26,425 --> 01:28:28,098
And I don't know Kutchi

952
01:28:28,961 --> 01:28:33,137
So, what language do you speak?
Gujarathi or Kutchi?

953
01:28:34,133 --> 01:28:35,544
Kutchi

954
01:28:37,704 --> 01:28:40,685
It seems you know
many languages

955
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:52,894
"Whateverl wish to speak, beau
should be spoken by you"

956
01:28:52,986 --> 01:28:57,662
"Day and night
we should interact!'

957
01:29:04,999 --> 01:29:07,206
Come here

958
01:29:12,607 --> 01:29:17,955
Vyomkesh, how old is Pyali?

959
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:22,854
She was born in
Gujarat, 4 years ago

960
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,133
Pyali, come and
play with me

961
01:29:31,194 --> 01:29:34,641
They don't have a common
language to communicate

962
01:29:34,698 --> 01:29:39,807
Can you ask him how he
professed his love to her?

963
01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:45,553
Vyom, Nani wants to
ask you something

964
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:46,212
Go ahead

965
01:29:46,477 --> 01:29:51,620
In what language did you
tell Lajju you love her?

966
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:54,220
Language is
no barrierfor love

967
01:29:54,285 --> 01:29:56,788
Only the experience counts

968
01:29:57,889 --> 01:29:59,994
- Did you understand that?
- No

969
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:07,538
Language is no barrier for love
Only the emotion counts

970
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:13,107
Pyali, come here

971
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:18,721
What are you looking at?

972
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:21,691
Are you wondering why I have
2 watches on my wrist?

973
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:24,557
One has the time
at which I found her

974
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:27,757
Other is the time that
we are living together

975
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:34,972
I've been using sign language
to communicate with her till now

976
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,139
But I want to ask her
something now

977
01:30:37,232 --> 01:30:39,041
Before that, can I
ask you something?

978
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,942
Tell me

979
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:45,952
How did you get a baby if you
had no common language?

980
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:47,953
Why do we need
a language for that?

981
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,545
We've achieved
the impossible

982
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,113
Isn't this do-able?!

983
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:54,991
What do you
want to ask Lajju?

984
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,031
Ask her what
she likes about me

985
01:30:58,087 --> 01:31:00,158
- ls that all?
- Yes, that's all

986
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:04,863
Lajju, what do you
like about him?

987
01:31:05,662 --> 01:31:10,042
I like his moustache

988
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:12,810
So cute

989
01:31:14,237 --> 01:31:18,151
- She likes your moustache
- Oh! Really...?

990
01:31:28,286 --> 01:31:29,697
Look at this

991
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:37,606
Try smelling it

992
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:44,143
Coffee powder

993
01:31:54,047 --> 01:31:57,722
Just imagine Vyom
and Lajju's situation

994
01:31:57,784 --> 01:31:59,923
Without a common
language to communicate

995
01:32:00,019 --> 01:32:02,124
Actually, it is ideal

996
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,859
They'll both have
peace of mind!

997
01:32:08,362 --> 01:32:12,208
Otherwise the wife
should be like Hari

998
01:32:12,266 --> 01:32:14,371
Who doesn't open his mouth!

999
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:20,414
Sir, are you tired?

1000
01:32:20,642 --> 01:32:21,814
Keep walking

1001
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,349
How old are you, sir?

1002
01:32:25,714 --> 01:32:30,060
By next year I'd have
seen 1000 full moons!

1003
01:32:30,653 --> 01:32:33,031
So are you 100?

1004
01:32:33,856 --> 01:32:35,267
No, I am 84

1005
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,935
Maybe my calculation
is wrong again!

1006
01:32:42,799 --> 01:32:45,405
- Sister...?
- I'm coming

1007
01:32:45,468 --> 01:32:47,675
Sister...brother Mustafa is here

1008
01:32:49,906 --> 01:32:52,284
Let me come in first

1009
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:55,413
Little devil, is your
circumcision over?

1010
01:32:56,246 --> 01:32:57,816
Move aside

1011
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:01,260
Master, come in

1012
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,163
Please sit down

1013
01:33:04,222 --> 01:33:06,964
Come in, sister Nani
Please sit down

1014
01:33:07,025 --> 01:33:09,471
Haseena...?

1015
01:33:11,129 --> 01:33:12,301
Sit down

1016
01:33:12,964 --> 01:33:14,443
Mother, is Ambusa'ka here?

1017
01:33:14,499 --> 01:33:16,137
He is on his way

1018
01:33:16,202 --> 01:33:18,182
Please serve them
something to drink

1019
01:33:19,805 --> 01:33:21,341
Dad's little pearl...!

1020
01:33:21,406 --> 01:33:22,714
Come here

1021
01:33:22,775 --> 01:33:24,880
Haseena, he is
fairerthan me!

1022
01:33:25,778 --> 01:33:28,122
Sit here
What is your name?

1023
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:29,921
Jubeena Mohammed

1024
01:33:29,982 --> 01:33:33,225
This is Haseena
and this is my son

1025
01:33:34,087 --> 01:33:36,328
I was praising you!

1026
01:33:36,389 --> 01:33:39,859
Can you see Nani?

1027
01:33:41,862 --> 01:33:45,400
Who is this...?
Did you see your dad?

1028
01:33:45,999 --> 01:33:47,842
So cute

1029
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:51,976
Sir, what is
the need for this?

1030
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,018
This is a ritual

1031
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:54,382
okay

1032
01:33:55,276 --> 01:33:56,346
Take it

1033
01:33:56,878 --> 01:33:58,323
Alright

1034
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:07,427
Hari...Hari
Look at this baby

1035
01:34:17,566 --> 01:34:19,170
Careful...careful

1036
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:40,296
Don't pee on
Uncle Hari's lap

1037
01:34:40,358 --> 01:34:42,531
Come on...dad will carry you

1038
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,256
He will not drink it

1039
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:05,886
Please drink

1040
01:35:08,387 --> 01:35:11,300
Ambusa, where were you?

1041
01:35:11,358 --> 01:35:12,962
They told me
you have arrived

1042
01:35:13,026 --> 01:35:15,233
I had to unload some stuff
and that's why got delayed

1043
01:35:15,329 --> 01:35:18,208
Sir, this is my brother Am busa
and this is my brother-in-law

1044
01:35:18,265 --> 01:35:19,505
I found them
on the way

1045
01:35:19,566 --> 01:35:21,068
How did you
manage to reach here?

1046
01:35:21,135 --> 01:35:22,614
It was tough

1047
01:35:22,837 --> 01:35:24,407
They have to
reach Kozhikode now

1048
01:35:24,472 --> 01:35:25,974
Kozhikode?

1049
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:29,283
Is it okay if you
can reach Beypore?

1050
01:35:29,343 --> 01:35:31,619
Yes, my house is
close to that place

1051
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:39,463
Kunjumon!

1052
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:44,329
That's it

1053
01:35:44,393 --> 01:35:46,464
Give me your bag, master

1054
01:35:52,635 --> 01:35:54,478
Give me a hand

1055
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:57,017
Be careful
while you get in

1056
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,019
Thank you

1057
01:36:01,111 --> 01:36:02,988
Bag... bag! !!

1058
01:36:03,246 --> 01:36:04,486
You and your bloody bag!

1059
01:36:04,548 --> 01:36:06,323
Kunjumon, be careful

1060
01:36:06,483 --> 01:36:09,396
Why are you
treating them like kids?

1061
01:36:09,553 --> 01:36:11,999
Carry on...and do let me
know once you reach safe

1062
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:14,366
Sir, hope you have
my number with you

1063
01:36:14,425 --> 01:36:15,130
Yes, I do

1064
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:16,865
So we'll meet somewhere

1065
01:36:16,928 --> 01:36:18,134
Not just somewhere

1066
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:20,937
We'll come for your son's first
birthday to taste your yummy biriyani!

1067
01:36:21,032 --> 01:36:23,171
Yes, please do
I'll make it with mutton

1068
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:25,180
- Sir, carry on
- Thank you

1069
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:27,683
Kunjumon, be careful

1070
01:36:30,408 --> 01:36:33,150
Abdu, you can start and stop
only when we reach Beypore

1071
01:36:33,245 --> 01:36:35,350
I wonder if some
foreigner will shoot us

1072
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,894
Shoot us?

1073
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:39,691
No foreigner or
Watson will come near us

1074
01:36:41,154 --> 01:36:42,656
Hold on tight and sit

1075
01:36:42,923 --> 01:36:44,129
ls there a bathroom?

1076
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,329
You want to
pee or crap?

1077
01:36:47,193 --> 01:36:48,331
Just pee into the water

1078
01:36:48,394 --> 01:36:50,931
Your urine won't increase
the salt in the water

1079
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:52,908
But if you want to crap...

1080
01:36:52,999 --> 01:36:56,105
...go the other side or
your pants will get wet

1081
01:36:56,236 --> 01:36:57,306
No need

1082
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:04,516
What happened?

1083
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:07,220
Hari, rub her
back for her

1084
01:37:17,526 --> 01:37:18,971
Are you alright?

1085
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:22,530
It is because she isn't used
to travelling on water

1086
01:37:31,174 --> 01:37:32,380
Are you married?

1087
01:37:32,742 --> 01:37:34,119
What?

1088
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:36,281
Nausea?!

1089
01:37:50,795 --> 01:37:52,433
What happened?

1090
01:37:52,497 --> 01:37:54,670
You must be
married, rig ht?

1091
01:37:57,268 --> 01:37:58,679
Is this the first time?

1092
01:37:58,770 --> 01:37:59,771
Yes

1093
01:38:00,038 --> 01:38:02,450
It is because
of the wind

1094
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:34,748
We' re reaching Bey pore

1095
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:49,032
We are about to reach

1096
01:38:49,558 --> 01:38:51,834
Please slow down a bit

1097
01:38:56,298 --> 01:38:59,108
Do you see that
school over there?

1098
01:39:02,137 --> 01:39:08,713
My wife worked there
as a teacher for 35 years

1099
01:39:09,545 --> 01:39:13,186
Her students are
like our own children

1100
01:39:14,751 --> 01:39:19,427
I went to Trivandrum only to get
a certificate attested for a student

1101
01:39:22,259 --> 01:39:23,761
Do you see that building...

1102
01:39:23,861 --> 01:39:27,741
...with the flat tiled roof
and white compound walls?

1103
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:37,811
That was where my wife, Sharad ha,
Ramani, Thomas and I lived in hiding

1104
01:39:38,276 --> 01:39:42,782
When the case was over,
my wife and I decide to live there

1105
01:39:43,515 --> 01:39:49,522
Later on, she insisted on giving it
to our fellow party members

1106
01:39:50,189 --> 01:39:54,137
Now it is our favorite office
for our political party meetings

1107
01:39:57,196 --> 01:40:02,407
She has suffered a lot of
torture from the police

1108
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:06,210
That's why she suffers from
repeated asthma attacks

1109
01:40:11,879 --> 01:40:18,489
She cooks excellent gravy of mackerel
with buttermilk which is very popular

1110
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:24,198
She won't allow any guest
to leave without eating

1111
01:40:24,558 --> 01:40:26,731
That's her nature

1112
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,809
Do you have
a handkerchief?

1113
01:40:58,662 --> 01:41:01,575
Please drive faster

1114
01:41:07,438 --> 01:41:09,349

01:41:19,919 --> 01:41:21,830
Stop here, I say!

1117
01:41:34,034 --> 01:41:38,244
We have to walk a bit
Will it be tough for you?

1118
01:41:40,607 --> 01:41:42,245
Let's get down

1119
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:50,352
- How much?
- Rs 180

1120
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:54,398
Oh, you are all here!
ls it a welcome committee?

1121
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:55,900
Keep the change

1122

1123
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:00,831
Just come with me

1124
01:42:00,895 --> 01:42:07,403
Moidheen...he called me
He is also one of her students

1125
01:42:07,468 --> 01:42:10,847
He is usually with us
in all our activities

1126
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,880
Moidheen...?

1127
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:27,332
We have a bit more to walk
Are you finding it difficult?

1128
01:42:36,801 --> 01:42:38,872
Nanu, come

1129
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:52,926
Moidheen

1130
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,397
Rashmi, I had to
break my journey

1131
01:42:58,457 --> 01:43:01,768
I'll get your certificate next week

1132
01:43:04,597 --> 01:43:05,735
Don't cry

1133
01:43:08,468 --> 01:43:09,708
What is this?

1134
01:43:11,371 --> 01:43:13,112
- Moidheen...?
- Coming, sir

1135
01:47:36,221 --> 01:47:38,292
You knew
all along, right?

1136
01:47:46,932 --> 01:47:47,967
Shall we go?

1137
01:48:21,836 --> 01:48:27,752
Poor soul...!
He's all alone now

1138
01:48:29,244 --> 01:48:31,656
I'll visit him next week

1139
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:34,384
Hari, will you
come with me?

1140
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:44,465
Shall we go and
eat something?

1141
01:48:46,129 --> 01:48:49,338
Come...come

1142
01:49:05,149 --> 01:49:07,390
Where do you
work in Ernakulam?

1143
01:49:11,322 --> 01:49:12,357
Sorry

1144
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:16,870
I keep asking you
unnecessary questions?

1145
01:49:24,035 --> 01:49:25,878
- In the train
- In the train!

1146
01:49:42,822 --> 01:49:44,301
Do you want black coffee?

1147
01:49:44,557 --> 01:49:45,433
Yes

1148
01:49:46,026 --> 01:49:48,199

2 black coffee

Where were you off to?

1151
01:49:54,301 --> 01:49:55,905
Trivand rum

1152
01:49:56,237 --> 01:49:59,218
I usually travel on
this train every Sunday

1153
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:03,116
Where do you live?

1154
01:50:04,979 --> 01:50:09,359

but I'm hardly there

1155

Maya, what is
your problem now?

1173
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:26,165
Is it because Hari no longer
laughs in the morning?

1174
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:29,292
Or is it because you people
can't wake up in the morning?

1175
01:56:29,424 --> 01:56:33,304
Didn't his laughing exercise become
a pan of your daily routine as well?

1176
01:56:33,794 --> 01:56:38,174
He has even started to have
more than 2 steamed rice cakes

1177
01:56:38,233 --> 01:56:40,907
Chicken...! He has
started eating chicken too

1178

a better appetite now

Lost his marbles

He used to walk to and fro
but now he doesn't

1183
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,724
It is after that trip he went on

1184
01:56:54,418 --> 01:56:56,989
Doctor, what do you
think is the reason?

1185
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:58,824
It could be self realization

1186
01:56:59,456 --> 01:57:03,233
Another reason could be
a complex feeling of anxiety

1187
01:57:04,427 --> 01:57:07,533
This behavior will increase
in proportion to anxiety

1188
01:57:07,632 --> 01:57:13,514

You have anything to tell me?

I have lost something

find anything in the 1st place?
