<font color="#ffff80"><b>(This Movie is Encoded By Doctor STAR -=!Dr.STAR!=-)</b></font>

2
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:16,774
We spent our lives playing and roaming
around, like a bunch of kids.

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,441
Suddenly, it feels as
though a decade has passed.

4
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:23,108
I feel like a man.

5
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,316
Come what may...

6
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,702
I feel like I can face it all.

7
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:31,983
We're not cops.

8
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,566
We're not thugs or
gangsters either.

9
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:38,108
We've never encountered
violence in our lives before.

10
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,733
There was just this small fight
when we hit someone for my sister.

11
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:43,899
That's it.

12
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:48,024
And I thought that was it. That I'd
lead a normal life, like everyone else.

13
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,858
But that was then...

14
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,149
Anything can happen in life.

15
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,858
The question is... are
we ready to face it?

16
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,885
He's such a loser.

17
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,772
He's followed her all
the way to college!

18
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:14,218
He is not letting her be.
- What are you waiting for?

19
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,510
Let's go. I know
where to find him.

20
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:19,743
Let's talk it out! You're a dancer,
not a thug. - Get moving, man!

21
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,563
Listen, you must be patient.
First let's lure him out.

22
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:23,985
Brother, come here.

23
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:25,010
Come here!

24
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,301
Come here, brother. Come on...

25
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:32,468
We know what you've been upto.

26
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,301
He's the one.

27
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,923
Your approach is wrong.

28
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:40,032
I didn't come all the way
here to give you pointers.

29
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,014
She said she doesn't like you.

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,166
Stop going to her college,
following her around...

31
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,608
Hey, just hit him!
- Hey, I’m talking to him right?

32
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,258
Those days of stalking are over.

33
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,741
Times have changed now.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,083
...and get a haircut.

35
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,658
You need to cool it.

36
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:05,788
I'll need twenty minutes, dude.

37
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,396
I can tell. Have fun!

38
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,218
Careful!

39
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,426
They must have known that
I'd come to drop Mahesh.

40
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:17,343
I parked my motorcycle
and waited.

41
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:25,926
I saw four silhouettes!

42
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,510
I knew there was
going to be trouble.

43
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,394
Only, not for me. For them.

44
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,556
You're laughing?

45
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:33,676
I don't know... I did feel fear.

46
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,593
There was this knot
in my stomach.

47
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:40,135
But I also felt courage surging through
my body... that I could face it all.

48
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,385
So you didn't cut your hair?

49
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,260
I'm not allowed to hit
on your sister...

50
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,135
But its okay for you
to romance our girls?

51
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,176
Yeah, but not me.

52
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,426
Just him.

53
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,244
I just tagged along.

54
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,426
Drop and pick-up.

55
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,721
He'll be here, wait up.

56
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,910
I'll come to your house tomorrow
and see about your sister then.

57
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Six punches. Six blows.

58
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:23,010
There was power in every punch.

59
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,676
Don't let him get away!

60
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,535
You're getting thrashed!

61
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,593
Don't let him go!

62
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,572
You're still not done?

63
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,762
You hit him when I was talking!
Now they have landed here.

64
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,211
It's turning into a big fight!
Get here soon, man.

65
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,611
They're taking it out on me!
Quick!

66
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,468
What's happening, dude?
- Come on!

67
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,152
Did you get them? How
did they come here?

68
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,482
Hop on, you fool!
- How did they know I'm here?

69
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,708
They're coming, dude! Go, go, go.
- You'll never see your Divya again.

70
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,874
You were getting action and
I had to face action, man!

71
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,426
When I have sons someday, I'll
tell them about these six punches.

72
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:09,718
"Boys... This one time, your daddy beat
up four men and threw six punches!"

73
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,635
If a situation were to
arise, I can handle it.

74
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,510
I'm confident... that I have the
stuff it takes to deal with it.

75
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,968
I think that kind of confidence
is very important in life.

76
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,243
Okay! - Bowl, now.

77
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,288
Specials for the day.

78
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:27,918
Too expensive, right?

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,176
I'm okay with it, dude.

80
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:31,718
May be too much for you.

81
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,593
Whoa! - Dude, I'm sitting here.

82
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,334
I'll tell Divya!

83
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,121
I was scouting for you, man.

84
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,901
Oh yeah?
- It hurts me to see you single.

85
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:46,551
I feel guilty whenever I
spend time with Divya.

86
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,596
'Cause you're all alone and I'm
happy sleeping on her lap.

87
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:53,676
Sure, I believe you.

88
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,103
Love. Girls.

89
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,760
It takes something else
to find that, right?

90
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,551
It needs a different
kind of confidence.

91
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,968
I don’t have it... and I think
its better to not have it.

92
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,968
At least I can be a good boy.

93
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,593
Be a straight-forward
guy, all my life.

94
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,218
Uh-huh. Okay! - Continue, dude.

95
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:14,159
I am close to both my sisters, I
spend a lot of time with them.

96
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,135
And hence I thought I
could figure out girls.

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,035
But no way!

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,218
Not happening.

99
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:21,385
I realised that even girls
can’t figure out themselves.

100
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:23,426
That's correct.
- How do you manage?

101
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:24,635
I... - Stop!

102
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,284
You hardly do any talking.

103
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,619
It's all action, right?

104
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,635
What happened, dude?

105
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,135
Back to Sukanya's topic.

106
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,426
Our friend’s Second Love.

107
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,326
This isn't love. You
haven’t even held my hand.

108
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,999
It’s easier for you to forget me, than
for me to try and love you again.

109
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,801
This is over.
- Sukanya, please...

110
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,110
That was an original dialogue!

111
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,718
And she's only sixteen!

112
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,221
Next, it was Mallika.

113
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:53,176
Our friend’s Third Love.

114
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,882
She was from my college.

115
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,313
She said she liked me.

116
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,298
And I never let go of her hand.

117
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,010
Tried some other stuff too.

118
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:11,181
And she dumped me for just that.

119
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:12,835
How dare you?

120
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,135
I thought you're a decent guy.

121
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:20,103
You're such a disappointment.
Just...

122
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,760
First, not holding hands was the problem.
Then, holding hands was the problem.

123
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,593
Girls always have a problem.

124
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,812
It needs to just happen.

125
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,254
Love.... must hit you like a thunderbolt.
Turn your life topsy-turvy.

126
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,946
That's surely not an original line.
- Will happen, someday.

127
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,651
Meanwhile, I've got
my First Love.

128
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,135
First Love? Who?

129
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,577
She'll be here tomorrow, dude!

130
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,051
Tomorrow? Finally!

131
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,693
Superb, man. Now there’s
just no stopping you.

132
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:46,718
My Royal Enfield.

133
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,551
She be my first love!

134
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:13,022
Showkaali! Come on, come on;
Don't just stand there frozen.

135
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:17,980
Showkaali! Move on, move
on; Girls are everything.

136
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:22,197
Showkaali! Come on, come on;
Don't just stand there frozen.

137
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:27,602
So, buddy! That looks a perfect ten; Put
on a fancy shirt, take chicks for a spin.

138
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:32,085
Showkaali, showkaali, showkaali; Turn
left, turn right, as you please.

139
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:36,491
Showkaali knows how to ace it
all; I'm a showkaali, oh yeah!

140
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:55,176
My bike- it's my wings! It's
the most important thing.

141
00:09:55,808 --> 00:10:05,017
I swerve and bend, won't you let me fly? Let
go of sad stories, won't you let me be?

142
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,494
To embrace and hold on to;
My bike is all I want.

143
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:15,108
To forget myself, go a long
way; Only for a bike I pray.

144
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:19,777
Just that... Oh yeah, just that.

145
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:29,144
What's up dude, check out my ride; With
them girls, you're on the other side.

146
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:38,584
All you see and feel, aren't your own;
In my ride, my dreams are all mine.

147
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:43,442
Up against fate, my bike is my armour;
Don't try to follow me, it spells danger.

148
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:48,374
Showkaali, showkaali, showkaali; Turn
left, turn right, as you please.

149
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,524
Showkaali knows how to ace
it all; That's a showkaali!

150
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:57,725
Showkaali, showkaali, showkaali; Turn
left, turn right, as you please.

151
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,000
Showkaali knows how to ace it
all; I'm a showkaali, oh yeah!

152
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:11,944
This breezer of
mine; Makes me fly.

153
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,721
Showkaalis, we know all the tricks;
Forever, we're in the heart of them chicks.

154
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:21,558
Join showkaalis, with girls we can party,
yo! Don't wanna? Then you'll fly solo.

155
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:24,051
Club like a king, Like
a walk with a queen.

156
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,368
If she's the one you
like; Hold her tight.

157
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,866
Hey sweet girl - whatcha thinkin'?
You're single, and I'm willing.

158
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,878
A showkaali, that's me!

159
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:40,370
There ain't no flat tyres in love;
What about your bike though?

160
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:45,104
My bike may get punctured; But
it'll never be a torture.

161
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:54,004
It rains kisses, in her lap I find solace;
When I switch to top-gear, I see paradise.

162
00:11:54,652 --> 00:12:00,444
A bike can help me score chicks;
Could a girl ever score me bikes?

163
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,445
Yeh yeh yeh, Yepe yeh yipe yeh.

164
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,845
Chicks we don't care;
Bike is the game.

165
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,078
Yeh yeh yeh, Yepe yeh yipe yeh.

166
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,515
Chicks we don't care;
Bike is the game.

167
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,435
Your gait and sway leaves me clueless; Your
mesmerising gaze drives boys sleepless.

168
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,434
When he sees the curves of your hips;
The boy falls head over heels.

169
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,780
We're young, we know every trick; But
we still fall prey to your magic.

170
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,864
I've seen your beauty and grace;
Every single time, I go into a daze.

171
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,348
I got enchanted by your bold glamour; And
oh boy, I fell hook, line and sinker.

172
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:35,012
Showkaali, showkaali, showkaali; Turn
left, turn right, as you please.

173
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,066
Showkaali knows how to ace it
all; I'm a showkaali, oh yeah!

174
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:43,611
Dude, the roaring lion and it's
stride; It's the bike I ride.

175
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,795
Sweet little girl - what are you doing?
Stand aside and watch this thing.

176
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:49,775
Come over to this side once;
With the Ducati, let's bounce.

177
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,483
Showkaali wants to ride again;
Yearning for a second time.

178
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:06,425
Showkaali is trapped by your
moves; He's crazy in love.

179
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:09,523
Showkaali wants to ride again;
Yearning for a second time.

180
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,631
Showkaali is trapped by your
moves; He's crazy in love.

181
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,218
Leela!

182
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:36,801
She happened.

183
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,218
She's Maitreyi's college friend.
- Oh!

184
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,551
Our rules apply!

185
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,343
Our sisters are sisters to all of us.
- Yes!

186
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,343
But our sisters' friends...

187
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,069
They're not our sisters!
- Not at all.

188
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,052
Anyway, rules are meant to be changed.
- I like you, dude.

189
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,218
I just covered up in
the nick of time!

190
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:02,760
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:06,152
I need to use the rest room.
Maitreyi said this was her room.

192
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:07,718
Yeah.

193
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,135
I'm sure you deliberately
left it unlocked!

194
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:15,350
I looked in the mirror for half an hour,
wondering if the stuff she saw was alright.

195
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:18,843
I’m stylish and all.

196
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,746
But I've put on some weight.

197
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,355
I know!

198
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:25,660
This is my friend Leela.

199
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,885
Hi.

200
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:28,518
You've met the others?

201
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:29,376
Hi!

202
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,383
Leela, this is my brother.

203
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:32,741
We just met.

204
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,033
Want some 'bajji'?

205
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,885
Yes. - And milk?

206
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:39,707
Mom!

207
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,616
Milk? - Yes, milk.

208
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,516
Want some 'bajji'? - No!

209
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,426
So you’ve all graduated and
this is your treat? 'Bajjis'?

210
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,051
Dude, you know most of
Maitreyi's friends.

211
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,760
We've seen them around.

212
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,921
But this girl, she’s
something else.

213
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:17,723
The nape of my neck was on fire.

214
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:21,093
With the thought that she
might be looking at me.

215
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:47,495
How do I talk to her
about the girl now...?

216
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,328
So... Nice, no?

217
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,011
What?

218
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,661
Did you get a good look at her?

219
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:53,411
Who?

220
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,036
Cut the act.

221
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,036
Leela.

222
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,581
Isn't she beautiful?
- Can I say something?

223
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,911
Why didn't you bring
her home earlier?

224
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,518
You should have
done that sooner.

225
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,593
She's beautiful.

226
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,473
But you won't get it.

227
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:19,161
I've heard you girls saying
"Leela this", "Leela that".

228
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,176
But you never mentioned
that she looked like this!

229
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,509
You wasted three years
studying Visual

230
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,761
Communication and two years
in Mass Communication!

231
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,745
I didn't want to distract
you from studies.

232
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,220
You have two backlogs as it is.

233
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:35,578
If you'd introduced me to her in my Final Year,
I'd have graduated First Class with no backlogs.

234
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:37,356
I'd have gotten my
degree in June.

235
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:42,328
She's inspiring. She
can't be a disturbance.

236
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,865
She's Leela Joseph.

237
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,691
From Alleppey, Kerala.

238
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,078
Just kidding!

239
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,507
She's Leela Raman from
Kolhapur, Maharashtra.

240
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:55,870
Hindi girl?

241
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,184
Father is a Tamizhian,
mother is a Maharashtrian.

242
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,734
Mom asked me to learn Hindi!

243
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,765
If only I hadn't
fixated on Tamizh...

244
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:07,261
Don't pack your bags
to go after her, now.

245
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,953
She doesn't live there.
She lives here.

246
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,703
We're doing this course
with the director together.

247
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,411
And she'll be living
with us from tomorrow.

248
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,036
Her father is coming here tomorrow
to make sure she'll be okay.

249
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,745
Say that again?

250
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:24,307
Her name is Leela, she is my classmate,
she'll be living with us from tomorrow!

251
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:45,328
Anything can happen in life.

252
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,286
And that includes you
coming into mine...

253
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,241
Son? - Yes...

254
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:17,470
All this time, I said the world is not
beautiful; She was the slap on my face!

255
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:22,620
With the meekness of a short vowel;
And whiff of a long vowel...

256
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:28,582
In my head; A love
song she's played.

257
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:42,245
Today, I looked in the mirror; And
said "Happy birthday, Stranger".

258
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:45,536
All this time...

259
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:54,203
I thought there's no beauty in this world.
How she proved me wrong!

260
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:57,411
All this time...

261
00:19:57,453 --> 00:20:06,495
I thought there's nothing sweet in prose.
How she proved me wrong!

262
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:09,536
All this time...

263
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:18,411
I thought there's no warmth in a melody.
How she proved me wrong!

264
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,353
All this time...

265
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:30,721
I thought there's nothing pure about the
breeze; How she's proved everything wrong!

266
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,093
Sorry.

267
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,113
You have to sleep on the
couch because of me.

268
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,286
Best moments of my life.

269
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:40,606
Day and night...

270
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,464
Everyday!

271
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,328
For 7 - 8 days.

272
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,735
It’s become a routine.

273
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:49,178
The T.V. is on, but
no one's watching.

274
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,453
I'm talking here! Listen.

275
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,786
You have to sleep on the
couch because of me.

276
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:54,841
Not at all!

277
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,328
I've been on the couch
for five years now.

278
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,901
Dad wakes me up in the morning. I sleep
in my parents' room for a few hours.

279
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,799
They're girls. They
need the privacy.

280
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,036
So do I.

281
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,877
No problem. It's not
because of you.

282
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:14,911
It must be nice, with
two sisters at home.

283
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:16,956
It's real torture.

284
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,666
It's nice sometimes.

285
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,043
Like right now.

286
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,226
I'm the only child in my house.

287
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:26,885
Dad, Mom and I.

288
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,867
But that’s so boring. Really!

289
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:33,620
Maitreyi talked about you
a lot during college.

290
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,809
She said good things?

291
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,411
Yeah, yeah. - Oh!

292
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:40,293
She'd say, "My brother is super-cool,
very protective, really chilled out."

293
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,953
I even heard your Sukanya story.

294
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,078
Her famous dialogue?

295
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:49,120
“It’s easier for you to forget me than
for me to try and love you again.”

296
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:50,401
She actually said that?

297
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:51,609
Maitreyi!

298
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:53,507
Everybody knows!

299
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:56,218
The whole of Tamil Nadu
knows my love story!

300
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,953
I did my schooling here,
at Church Park Convent.

301
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,205
My parents decided to move
to Kolhapur after my school.

302
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,125
Four years of engineering!

303
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:10,848
Dad said it's okay, that I needn't
go to work right away. So...

304
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:15,309
I completed this M.B.A. course
here and now I'm chilling at home.

305
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,286
Doing nothing.

306
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:19,707
Basically, jobless.

307
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:22,720
We talk all night.

308
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,705
Most of the time, it's
just the two of us.

309
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,553
Sometimes, Maitreyi joins us.
- Thank God!

310
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:27,911
Such great chemistry!

311
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,411
It's sizzling!

312
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:30,995
But in a good way.

313
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,745
I can feel it...

314
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,411
Not sure if she can though!

315
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:35,745
We acted, too.

316
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:39,078
He asked us to stand
next to the heroine!

317
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,911
Like background artists.

318
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:45,203
Assistant directors don't just work!
They make them stand in the frame, too.

319
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:46,813
Who is the heroine?

320
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,828
We're way better than her!

321
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:52,078
Even YOU are better? - Buzz off!

322
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,245
Heavens!

323
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,370
Do you like it or not?
- I don't.

324
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,851
I only want to write.

325
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,120
I like to write. I want
to be a script writer.

326
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:03,661
We've both decided to become a writer duo!
- Yes.

327
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:07,370
We'll churn up material to make movies.
That's more interesting.

328
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,828
Just 20 more days of internship.

329
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,789
Leela - Maitreyi. The writer duo.
We're getting it registered.

330
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:14,886
We need an office. A nice
place, but not too expensive.

331
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,483
Help us, got any leads?

332
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:19,036
First, write something
interesting.

333
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
We'll look for an office later.

334
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:25,164
Okay, I'm really sleepy.

335
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:27,383
I'm going. You stay
up if you want.

336
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Get going.

337
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,234
Let me know when
you want to sleep.

338
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:37,995
No... It's okay!

339
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,109
I'm fine.

340
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:42,578
Dude!

341
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:45,161
I can’t wait for it to be night.

342
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,286
I understand.

343
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,536
Mornings are too sweaty! - Oh!

344
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:52,453
Just think, surrounded
by boys all day!

345
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:55,553
I'm bored of spending all
my time with you guys.

346
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:58,303
This is too insulting, man. I'm going.
- That's my house!

347
00:24:58,381 --> 00:24:59,589
If you're going, go out!

348
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,772
Another insult!

349
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,988
So cute! - He's just joking...

350
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:05,786
Stop! - What time is it?

351
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:17,559
I fell asleep. - I noticed.

352
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:19,495
You could go in and sleep!

353
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm hungry. - Hungry?

354
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:24,036
Yes, we had dinner at 8!

355
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:26,280
It's midnight now. I'm hungry.

356
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,583
Here you go.

357
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:30,870
Enjoy! - Wow.

358
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:33,863
My favourite!

359
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,036
Thank you so much. - It's okay!

360
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:37,393
Maitreyi told you?

361
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,518
No.

362
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,081
You're not eating? - No.

363
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,659
South India!

364
00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:59,231
I was supposed to
leave last week.

365
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:02,468
My friend Mahesh? He ditched me.

366
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,161
I didn't want to travel alone.

367
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:06,578
It will be nice.

368
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,234
On my bike, that too!

369
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:09,933
It'll be great.

370
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,458
Seriously? On a bike?

371
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:14,502
Yes, it’s just a bike. Not
like it's a ship or something.

372
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,911
Not so loud! No one
at home knows.

373
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,406
They won't let me go on my bike.

374
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:22,564
So, it’ll be from the street
corner and not from home.

375
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,963
First, Chennai to Kanyakumari.

376
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,965
Watch the sun rise there. Will
figure out the rest later.

377
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:28,870
Wow!

378
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,661
I'm leaving next week, for sure.

379
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,386
So, you have a good bike?
To go on a road trip?

380
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,203
Which one?

381
00:26:49,495 --> 00:26:50,828
Isn't she a beauty?

382
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,807
Shall I tell them?
About your road trip?

383
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:10,757
Please don't! I'll
be in trouble.

384
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:13,328
You'll be safe?

385
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,453
Don't speed, ride safe.

386
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,136
You haven't even told them!
Ride slow.

387
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:18,953
Okay?

388
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:23,620
Good night. - Good night.

389
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:35,627
That day, I thought to myself,
if only you could go with me!

390
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,703
She said "Ride
safe", "Ride slow"!

391
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,465
She could just come along.

392
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,874
Finally, it will be Mahesh!

393
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,721
Such a cute girl, man.

394
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,203
Like A.R. Rahman's music.
- Yeah.

395
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,411
She's like that. - Hosanna?

396
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,775
In that movie, the
girl lives upstairs.

397
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,136
But here, she is at home.

398
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,661
He is so lucky!

399
00:27:58,101 --> 00:28:00,768
It’s like his music that grows on you.
- Yeah!

400
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,370
As you talk to her, as you
go on looking at her...

401
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:06,242
clean, pure love grows.

402
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:18,370
Here's a fuzzy, white cloud;
On my mattress it's perched.

403
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:23,870
And when I meets you gaze...
Uh oh!

404
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,828
Wonder what you'll do now?

405
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:34,453
My life is not like before. So what?
I couldn't ask for more.

406
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:39,703
Wonder what you'll do now?

407
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:40,911
All this time...

408
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:51,995
I thought there's no beauty in this world.
How she proved me wrong!

409
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:04,953
I said, there's no beauty!
And she's proved me wrong.

410
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:13,536
I said, melody is not bliss!
And she's proved me wrong.

411
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:19,511
I said, prose is not sweet!
And she's proved me wrong.

412
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:25,453
Oh, she did! She did, she
did, she proved me so wrong!

413
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:31,536
Oh, she did! She did, she
did, she proved me so wrong!

414
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:34,786
Oh, she did! She
proved me so wrong!

415
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,303
Hi! - Hi...

416
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:46,203
Were you busy? I
hardly see you around.

417
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:48,059
I'm not always
jobless, you know.

418
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,645
I had some work in college.

419
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,413
My friends wanted to meet.

420
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,711
I'm leaving tomorrow. I'll
head to the hostel, pack my

421
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:56,595
bags, and day after morning
is my train to Kolhapur.

422
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,740
Maitreyi said she'll
come there in two weeks.

423
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,557
We're planning to
start writing there.

424
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:01,473
Nice!

425
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:03,411
All the best. - Thank you.

426
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,200
If you're leaving,
I'll get going too!

427
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,029
I'm leaving on my trip
day after tomorrow.

428
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:10,095
On my bike.

429
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,049
I keep asking the
guys to come along.

430
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,995
But they're all in
pursuit of their future.

431
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:18,984
Mahesh said he'll go. But I
know he'll ditch last moment.

432
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:20,497
His girlfriend won't let him go!

433
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,786
Whether he is coming or not, I am
heading out. -On your bike for sure?

434
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:27,120
I've seen enough of buses and trains.
Yes, on my bike!

435
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:29,728
With the wind on my face!
On my Royal Enfield.

436
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,624
Don't tell Maitreyi! She'll tell on me.
- Okay.

437
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:35,967
But, how?

438
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:38,242
I'll say Mahesh wanted the bike.

439
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:40,075
He'll take the bike tomorrow.

440
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:42,602
He'll wait at the street
corner day after tomorrow.

441
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:44,411
I've told them I'm going
to Kanyakumari by train.

442
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:45,692
I've got tickets, too.

443
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:48,026
In case they ask. They
won't ask, though.

444
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:51,046
It's an early morning train, so
I'll leave at five in the morning.

445
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,453
I had a great time.

446
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,411
Really.

447
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,120
So much better than
being at home.

448
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,453
You stayed up so many nights
to talk to me. Thank you.

449
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,426
Actually, same here.

450
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,161
All the best. Ride safe.

451
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,678
All the best to the two of you!

452
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:09,265
Write fresh and interesting stuff!
Not something mundane.

453
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,994
Okay, bye!

454
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:22,799
Bye!

455
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,303
I've kept cash in
your bag, be careful.

456
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:25,245
Okay, dad.

457
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,455
Got the train ticket on you?
- Yes, dad.

458
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:28,875
Be careful!

459
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,375
Don't eat junk! Take care.

460
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,127
I don't like this at all.

461
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:35,678
Where is Mahesh?

462
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,411
He said he'd come directly
to the railway station?

463
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:40,504
Exactly.

464
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:44,220
Don't worry, mom. I'll be fine.
I'm only gone for five days.

465
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:45,995
Say you'll be back in five days!

466
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,210
I'll be back! Happy?

467
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,223
Be safe! - Okay, dad.

468
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:51,803
You're a big fat liar!

469
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:54,828
Just hundred feet from the house! He’s
standing there dressed like a thief.

470
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,793
I managed, somehow.

471
00:31:57,178 --> 00:32:00,511
I had to beg for Divya's
permission to go for five days!

472
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:01,879
This better be worth it.

473
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:04,348
This is true friendship.
- Stop! Move.

474
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,245
It's Leela!

475
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,495
Yes.

476
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,351
What's she doing here?

477
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,991
Hi. - Hi!

478
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,440
You didn't go?

479
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,911
Are you going to my house?

480
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,286
Maitreyi didn't say anything.

481
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:28,095
So early in the morning...
Is everything okay?

482
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,870
Yeah.

483
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:30,911
We're going triples, I think.

484
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,620
I thought I could go with you.
On your road trip.

485
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:41,254
Sorry, I thought you said
your friend may not come.

486
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:43,620
But he’s here, right?
No problem.

487
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,870
I'll leave to Kolhapur.
The train is at 8:30.

488
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:49,036
That was the plan anyway. So...

489
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:50,678
It's okay. You carry on.

490
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:51,911
Are you sure? - What?

491
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,434
About coming with me on the road trip?
- Yeah, why not?

492
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,078
It won't be easy.

493
00:32:58,203 --> 00:32:59,828
It’ll be like travelling
with the boys.

494
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:01,328
You'll have to rough it out.

495
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:04,620
My rules. And you don't
know me too well.

496
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:07,036
You're a girl. I'm a boy.

497
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,911
I’m decent. But still....

498
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,995
Looks like its going to be doubles
and just the two of them.

499
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,245
Your friend is here this time.
Go with him.

500
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:22,161
He's a boy. You're a boy.
It'll be nice.

501
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:24,401
But he's not coming!

502
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,495
Dude, are you coming?

503
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,328
I was out of here two days ago.

504
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:34,078
The minute she got here,
I knew I'd get cut off.

505
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,078
No, no! It's okay, I'll just leave.
- I told you!

506
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,786
I'll come next time. I
feel really bad for him.

507
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,245
You're still here, dude?
- Superb, man.

508
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:44,390
Let's go, man. - Your luggage!

509
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,495
It’s all here. Don't worry.

510
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,692
He's leaving. - Oh God!

511
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:53,559
Oh, they're leaving!

512
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,703
Superb! - Sorry.

513
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,370
I feel really bad for him.

514
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,344
I don't even know your name.

515
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:11,094
What? You don't know my name?

516
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:12,511
I swear!

517
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,219
Maitreyi never mentioned your
name when she introduced us.

518
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,969
She always refers to you as 'my
brother' when she talks about you.

519
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:21,215
I don't remember anyone at home
calling you by your name either.

520
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,792
Even when my dad came!

521
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,932
I was hoping to
eventually ask you.

522
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:27,386
But I never asked!

523
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,677
So, what's your name?

524
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:31,927
Oh! That's alright.
Let it be like that.

525
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,750
So, why did you decide to
come with me on this trip?

526
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:47,761
This bike will take off with or without
you, depending on what you say.

527
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,594
I'll tell you. You
start the bike.

528
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,636
I've never been on a bike.

529
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:00,011
Never even sat on one!
This is the first time.

530
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,536
I always wanted to!

531
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:06,177
You said "wind on my face", right?
I want that too.

532
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,511
I guess you are a decent guy.

533
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:12,302
Anyway, Maitreyi is there
if I need to complain.

534
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:15,261
I gave it so much thought... ever
since you mentioned this trip.

535
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,859
I know if I let this chance
go by, I won’t get another.

536
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:21,684
This is why.

537
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,594
You okay? - Yeah!

538
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,552
So, what's the plan?
Where are we going?

539
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,886
Are we riding non-stop or...?

540
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:36,284
What's your name? Tell me!

541
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,315
We are heading to Kanyakumari.
Via Salem- Palakkad- Trivandrum.

542
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:48,825
Since you're with me now, the rest
of the plan might change a bit.

543
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,302
Let me know if I
need to pull over.

544
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,136
Else we'll keep going till
we need to eat or sleep.

545
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:56,302
No stops!

546
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:58,177
No problem. Keep going!

547
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:05,594
Need water?

548
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,011
Mango juice?

549
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,458
No, thanks!

550
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,011
Biscuits?

551
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,590
Noodles! - Oh, no!

552
00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,594
Cake? Chocolate cake?

553
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,969
Looks like you have a
mini food-court in there!

554
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,131
Looks like you can eat non-stop?
- Yeah!

555
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:38,052
Very good.

556
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:11,864
Pretty falcon, soaring across the
sky; Are you faster, or am I?

557
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:24,011
Time plays tricks with my wits;
Now, I can't tell East from West!

558
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:33,886
I've transformed into a bird, today;
My hands and wings are the same!

559
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:44,302
Hey, Falcon! Is
that a challenge?

560
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:46,302
Is that a challenge?

561
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:51,011
Will you win? Or will I win?

562
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,569
Race me, And we shall see;

563
00:37:53,594 --> 00:38:02,094
Who will confess their love first?
Who will fire Cupid's arrow loose?

564
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:08,136
With you and me talking endlessly;
Silence walks away, quietly.

565
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:15,719
Like the Lotus dancing on the pond;
I perceive daydreams so fond!

566
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:20,427
Your warmth on my shoulder;
Is a glowing fire in winter.

567
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,136
Hello, sir. - Hello! Welcome.

568
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:34,779
We're travelling from Chennai to Kanyakumari.
It's become dark. We need a place to stay...

569
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:37,096
Oh, you need to stay?
- We'll leave in the morning.

570
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,719
This is Leela. My
sister's friend.

571
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,707
You are our guests.
We’ll take care of it.

572
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,052
Imagine in the city, you knock on somebody’s
door and ask to spend the night...

573
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:12,677
they would call the cops, right?
- Yeah!

574
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,011
Because the people
here are all heart.

575
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:23,052
All day, the walls come closing in;
At night, the mist is my only friend.

576
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:27,386
And a soft voice sings in
my head; Is this my end?

577
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:32,552
On my face the breeze is upbeat; And
behind me is a green little parakeet!

578
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:36,761
This is a journey of a lifetime!
Oh, let it never end!

579
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:42,152
All day, the walls come closing in;
At night, the mist is my only friend.

580
00:39:42,177 --> 00:39:46,677
And a soft voice sings in
my head; Is this my end?

581
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:51,753
On my face the breeze is upbeat; And
behind me is a green little parakeet!

582
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:56,094
This is a journey of a lifetime!
Oh, let it never end!

583
00:39:56,177 --> 00:40:05,886
Hey, Falcon! Is
that a challenge?

584
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:07,995
Is that a challenge?

585
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:16,770
Who will confess their love first?
Who will fire Cupid's arrow loose?

586
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,859
Drenched in the last drop of rain and shine;
And the stars, perpetually following.

587
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:08,444
How could I ever forget,
each town's unique scent?

588
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:13,302
I don't remember when I last
said- "An adventure so wild!"

589
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:17,548
And it may never happen in the
future; Oh, I'll cherish it forever.

590
00:41:18,136 --> 00:41:23,011
Drenched in the last drop of rain and shine;
And the stars, perpetually following.

591
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:27,719
How could I ever forget,
each town's unique scent?

592
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:32,694
I don't remember when I last
said- "An adventure so wild!"

593
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,886
And it may never happen in the
future; Oh, I'll cherish it forever.

594
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:48,636
Hey, Falcon! Is
that a challenge?

595
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:57,719
Who will confess their love first?
Who will fire Cupid's arrow loose?

596
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:03,469
With you and me talking endlessly;
Silence walks away, quietly.

597
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:10,927
Like the Lotus dancing on the pond;
I perceive daydreams so fond!

598
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:15,469
Your warmth on my shoulder;
Is a glowing fire in winter.

599
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:20,094
Your warmth on my shoulder;
Is a glowing fire in winter.

600
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,386
A glowing fire in winter.

601
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:34,386
Two rooms, right?

602
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,052
No. Just one.

603
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:38,659
If I say yes, are you
going to judge me?

604
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:41,159
If I say one room, will YOU?

605
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,052
No.

606
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,052
Just think I am Mahesh.

607
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,552
That's the experience
I came for.

608
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:48,677
To hang out with the boys,
and to be like the boys.

609
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,427
Is that so? - Yes.

610
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:51,552
Let’s go then, dude.

611
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:56,261
Just kidding. Don't be scared.
- I'm not.

612
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:58,886
Single room. Double occupancy.

613
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,589
Twin beds. - Sure.

614
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,114
Two separate beds.

615
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:03,052
Okay, sir.

616
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:05,761
Your name, sir?

617
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:07,802
Here is my ID.

618
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:10,347
Thank you.

619
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:13,164
What a name, sir! - I know.

620
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,719
Sign here.

621
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:17,302
Here you go. - Thanks.

622
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:23,261
Yeah, he told me...

623
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:47,484
Leela...

624
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:49,761
You go in, be comfortable.
I’ll wait outside.

625
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:06,659
Complete foodie, right?
Eat away!

626
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:21,235
Hello, madam? Leela...

627
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:22,442
Leela?

628
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:25,802
Good morning.

629
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:28,969
It's 4:30 A.M. We have
to go see the sunrise.

630
00:44:45,594 --> 00:44:55,011
She and I, are like Tamizh and potion;
She and I are like waves to the ocean!

631
00:44:55,456 --> 00:45:05,039
She and I, are like devotion and benefaction;
She and I, are like roots and trees.

632
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:09,844
Like the tree and it's shade;
Like motion and action.

633
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:14,927
Like a team and treaty;
That's she and I.

634
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:20,086
Like crowd and courage;
Like toil and triumph.

635
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:24,761
She and I, We're like
grace and glory.

636
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:52,302
You're emotional too, like me?

637
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:55,469
Great!

638
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:05,049
I feel like I've
found a good friend.

639
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:07,143
A friend forever.

640
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:39,152
Like a river to the fish,
And expanse to the skies.

641
00:46:39,177 --> 00:46:41,052
Leela, come here for a moment.

642
00:46:56,985 --> 00:47:01,777
Like the harp and it's strings;
Like a flower and it's fragrance.

643
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:06,986
Me and she, Are like
being and the body;

644
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:11,761
Like the harp and it's strings;
Like a flower and it's fragrance.

645
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:16,594
She and I, are like
honey and sweetness.

646
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:22,136
She and I, are like
laughter and happiness.

647
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:27,152
She and I, are like
cold and night.

648
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:32,136
She and I, are like
sun and light.

649
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:46,886
She and I, are like Tamizh and potion;
She and I are like waves to the ocean!

650
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:56,177
She and I, are like devotion and benefaction;
She and I, are like roots and trees.

651
00:47:56,761 --> 00:48:01,386
Like the tree and it's shade;
Like motion and action.

652
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:06,052
Like a team and treaty;
That's she and I.

653
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:11,569
Like crowd and courage;
Like toil and triumph.

654
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:16,136
She and I, We're like
grace and glory.

655
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:24,511
She and I, are like Tamizh and potion;
She and I, are like Tamizh and potion.

656
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,177
When I spoke to dad
two days ago...

657
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:29,177
I told him I'm still at your place,
and I'll be home in two days.

658
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:32,094
I never told him I'm on
this trip with you. Get it?

659
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:35,692
Drop me somewhere near home.

660
00:48:36,386 --> 00:48:38,761
We are about three hours away.
- Okay.

661
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:42,136
Even when I called home, I never
told them you're with me.

662
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:43,802
Why? - I don't know...

663
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:45,458
I didn't say anything
when we left.

664
00:48:45,886 --> 00:48:47,594
They won't get it
if I tell them now.

665
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,261
It’s not like we are
doing something wrong.

666
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,844
'Something wrong?' - Yeah,
but they won't believe me.

667
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:55,573
They will misunderstand.

668
00:48:56,927 --> 00:49:00,302
We’ve done nothing wrong. They’ll
think we have, that’s so wrong.

669
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,817
Give me your number. Actually, I
wanted to ask for your number.

670
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,677
Yeah.. 9-9-6-9.

671
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:18,761
You won't even say your name... I am
going to save it as “Who is this guy”.

672
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:20,569
What say?

673
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,552
This isn't just friendship...

674
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:27,200
You're more than a good friend.

675
00:50:27,683 --> 00:50:29,933
I am dying to tell
you this is love.

676
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:36,011
I’m yearning to say "Don't go.
Be with me."

677
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:40,731
My mind is unable to function,
I’m at a loss for words.

678
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:21,997
Oh, there's a change in the clime;
Precious as a pearl, this ticking time.

679
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:33,167
My heart is throbbing hard; But my
mind can't find the right word.

680
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:39,844
The only thing in my view;
Is an image of you.

681
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:48,594
I beg my eyes to rest;
But they protest.

682
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:57,828
Time passes in a flash; Slashing
my back like a whiplash.

683
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:00,652
In that misery; I found poetry.

684
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:06,094
These are my written verses;
In unknown jargons.

685
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:17,401
Like a mighty ocean you stand; I only
see the waves, for I'm just a child.

686
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:24,940
Pour me into the sea of flame; It'll
be my waterfall, all the same.

687
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:32,511
It's a still, wordless night; While
the whole town sleeps tight.

688
00:52:32,844 --> 00:52:40,052
O Moon! Like you, I shine;
I sleeplessly pine.

689
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,861
I'm living in a surreal world; With
the colours of a dancing bird.

690
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:58,518
I stretch my arms, reaching out to
you; But then, why did I fail to?

691
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:09,261
For that first kiss, why does it take
forever? It smoulders the flower.

692
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:30,719
Don't you move away; Don't
you ask me to move away.

693
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:37,692
Our lips are but thorns,
Disguised as flowers.

694
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:45,244
Don't you move away; Don't
you ask me to move away.

695
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:52,469
Our lips are but thorns,
Disguised as flowers.

696
00:53:52,511 --> 00:54:07,386
I affirm that our bodies are no barrier;
But you and I both know, that it's a lie.

697
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:10,119
So, come closer now.

698
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:26,783
You show up in my dream; When
I awaken, you hide from me.

699
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,930
In my reverie, everyday; Like
raindrops, you shower away.

700
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:37,358
Love has caused a strange intoxication;
But the sight of you causes hesitation.

701
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:40,469
Tick-tock, tick-tock;
Time slips off.

702
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:44,261
Tick-tock, tick-tock; Ticking
off my years of love.

703
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:52,840
Why does my heart palpitate?
It's the cruel game of fate.

704
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,799
My dear, let's be
together; Forever.

705
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:02,050
My dear, let's be
together; Forever.

706
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:27,200
Tell my parents only if I die...

707
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:34,802
I can't imagine dying without telling
you this. I’ll never forgive myself.

708
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,308
I’d rather die.

709
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:40,969
I love you.

710
00:55:44,058 --> 00:55:47,183
From the moment I first saw you.

711
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:55,261
I was scared I'd die! and
that’s why I said “I love you.”

712
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:24,969
What was even scarier...

713
00:56:25,278 --> 00:56:28,820
was waking up at the hospital and
finding you weren't there next to me.

714
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:34,727
They said you came with me, admitted
me, and registered my name as Mahesh.

715
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,859
But you weren't
with me after that.

716
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:38,469
You weren't there.

717
00:56:38,511 --> 00:56:41,302
I was scared wondering
what happened to you.

718
00:56:57,261 --> 00:56:58,594
Hello. - Hello?

719
00:56:58,636 --> 00:57:01,552
What happened to your phone?
I've been trying to call you.

720
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:02,802
Where are you calling from?

721
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,463
I lost my phone. That's why
I couldn't get in touch.

722
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,238
How are you? - I am all good.

723
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,611
The sunrise was
really good here...

724
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:12,944
I'll be home in a couple of days.
Please handle mom for me.

725
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,594
Hold on, she wants to talk.

726
00:57:14,773 --> 00:57:16,606
I'll call mom after
I fix my phone.

727
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:18,173
Okay, when are you back?

728
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:20,942
I'll be back. In two days.

729
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:23,927
Mom is asking me questions,
and I can't handle her.

730
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:26,677
I'll be back, bye.
- You took your bike, didn’t you?

731
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:27,677
Don't hang up...

732
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:34,471
Brother, is this the
Government Hospital?

733
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:35,747
This is the one. - Thank you.

734
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,593
It took me two hours to locate
your ward in this hospital!

735
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:42,076
My Hindi is that bad.

736
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:43,388
It hurts!

737
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:46,379
If I was on that
bike with you...

738
00:57:46,998 --> 00:57:48,082
I'd be a dead man now.

739
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:49,929
There is a God.

740
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,283
My bike is all gone.

741
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,303
My bike, dude... bloody hell.

742
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:57,596
I took such great care of it!

743
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,395
It hurts me so much when I
realise my bike is gone.

744
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:05,958
The doctor said it was
a hit and run truck.

745
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:07,981
If I get hold of those guys…

746
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:11,108
Now, she's gone too.

747
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:12,975
Have no clue where she is.

748
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:16,138
Nobody knows anything. I don't
know who can help either.

749
00:58:19,221 --> 00:58:20,096
Hello?

750
00:58:20,138 --> 00:58:21,013
Hello...

751
00:58:21,346 --> 00:58:22,388
It's me. Leela.

752
00:58:23,388 --> 00:58:24,221
Hey!

753
00:58:25,138 --> 00:58:26,179
Where are you?

754
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,515
I'll tell you. How
are you feeling now?

755
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:30,971
I'm fine. Doing okay.

756
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,971
I couldn't talk these
past few days.

757
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:36,554
I called up the hospital yesterday
and enquired about you.

758
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:39,888
They told me you're alright.

759
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:40,939
Thank God!

760
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:44,304
I couldn't be there with you.

761
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,013
I am really sorry.

762
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:48,929
There was a situation...
I had to leave.

763
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:51,132
My dad...

764
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:53,763
They hacked him.

765
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:54,763
And mom, too...

766
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,763
What? - Yeah...

767
00:58:58,194 --> 00:58:59,696
He is at the hospital here.

768
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:01,054
I am here with him.

769
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,429
The doctor says he
might not make it.

770
00:59:04,263 --> 00:59:06,013
They also tried to kill mom.

771
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:07,304
But she escaped.

772
00:59:07,554 --> 00:59:09,888
We're practically hiding
at the hospital here.

773
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,679
What? - The truck that hit us...

774
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:13,904
... was also sent to kill me.

775
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,429
That wasn't an accident at all.
- What are you saying?

776
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:20,287
How do you know? I don't get it!
- After I admitted you in the hospital...

777
00:59:21,013 --> 00:59:23,846
...my dad called me up. He
was the one who told me.

778
00:59:24,513 --> 00:59:25,638
He was panicking.

779
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:28,814
That's when he was attacked.
They butchered him!

780
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:29,926
I heard it all.

781
00:59:31,096 --> 00:59:32,929
Everything’s changed
in a second.

782
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,483
You shouldn't be there. Go home.

783
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:36,804
I'll talk to you later.

784
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:40,763
Did she say someone tried
to intentionally kill her?

785
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,630
So, it was a planned attack
to take down your bike.

786
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:46,530
She never told you why?

787
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:48,569
She said she didn't know.

788
00:59:48,594 --> 00:59:49,760
She didn't say anything else.

789
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:52,013
Dude... this sounds scary.

790
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,077
So knowing all this we are
going back for her...

791
00:59:55,102 --> 00:59:56,268
we are going to be with her?

792
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,804
Why? - I made a mistake.

793
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:01,554
What?

794
01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:04,721
When I was hit by the truck,
and lying on the road...

795
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:06,846
I told her, "I love you, Leela".

796
01:00:08,015 --> 01:00:09,515
I know! But I told her.

797
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:12,304
Really? You picked THAT moment?

798
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:15,638
I thought I was a dead man.
It felt right to tell her.

799
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:20,596
You didn't think of calling up your
parents, saying goodbye to them?

800
01:00:20,939 --> 01:00:24,272
Or even talking to me? - Yeah, all
of that ran like flashes in my head.

801
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:27,013
But in the end, it was
only love that lingered.

802
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:28,554
Lingered! Sure it did.

803
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:31,179
We go there, and
be there for her.

804
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:33,471
Love will be on the back-burner.

805
01:00:34,554 --> 01:00:36,429
What's her dad's name? Raman?

806
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:40,304
Raman... - Straight down,
take a right, second floor.

807
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,346
Second floor?

808
01:00:42,363 --> 01:00:43,904
He doesn't talk much.

809
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:44,889
Excuse me.

810
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:47,640
Sir, none of the cameras
here are working.

811
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,263
I don't think he will help us.
- What's he saying about some camera?

812
01:00:55,183 --> 01:00:57,433
Dude, there is no one here.
It is empty.

813
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,346
Leela...

814
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:25,809
Leela, who is it?

815
01:01:26,846 --> 01:01:28,804
They're my friends.
You can leave.

816
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:36,346
Don't cry.

817
01:01:38,054 --> 01:01:39,179
How is your father doing?

818
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,763
They just keep saying
that he wont make it.

819
01:01:41,788 --> 01:01:42,913
He is on life support.

820
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,802
They've stabbed him in
ten different places.

821
01:01:48,255 --> 01:01:49,255
And your mom?

822
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:51,888
She has a head injury.
She fell down.

823
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:54,924
They've attacked her, too.
But she's not too critical.

824
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:56,450
She is inside.

825
01:01:57,007 --> 01:01:59,174
Tell me... What should I do?

826
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:01,687
Who this is, why they did this...
I don't know anything.

827
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,281
Nobody knows anything.

828
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:06,679
Why did you come here?

829
01:02:06,774 --> 01:02:08,315
I asked you to go home, right?

830
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:10,082
You are injured, too!

831
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:12,718
It's okay. I am fine.

832
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:27,971
Never take it for granted that there will be
no violence in an ordinary person's life.

833
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:31,054
Anything can happen.

834
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:34,900
My ordinary life turned into a violent
action story at that hospital.

835
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:38,513
If a situation were to
arise, I can handle it.

836
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,804
I'm confident... that I have the
stuff it takes to deal with it.

837
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:44,304
That kind of confidence is
very important in life.

838
01:02:44,447 --> 01:02:48,244
That day, was an acid
test to that confidence.

839
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:49,054
Leela?

840
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:53,272
It began this exact moment...
when I least expected it.

841
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:11,879
You're Raman's daughter? - Yes.

842
01:03:15,513 --> 01:03:18,179
Is this a hospital or what?
What's with the crowd?

843
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:20,096
Get going.

844
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,096
Leela, get back here.

845
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:05,471
Come here.

846
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,533
Don't let them go, dude.

847
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,846
Stab him, dude!

848
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:13,263
Come on!

849
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:15,388
Don't let them go, dude!

850
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:23,679
Oh my God, what's happening?
Who are these guys?

851
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,592
They got away. They escaped.

852
01:04:25,638 --> 01:04:27,679
They jumped over the wall.
We couldn't get them.

853
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:31,098
Who are these people?
- I don't know!

854
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:33,206
Who would dare to come
in here and do this?

855
01:04:33,231 --> 01:04:35,231
You shouldn't be here.
None of us should be here!

856
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,929
Are you okay?
- This looks so wrong.

857
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:38,049
Yes, let's leave.

858
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:40,823
Guys, are you okay?
- I am fine. Get me that knife.

859
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:41,681
The knife...

860
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:43,872
Here. - You keep this...

861
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,755
If they come back, you use this.

862
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:47,304
Let's go. - Where are we going?

863
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:48,223
We're going down.

864
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:49,248
You be here, please.

865
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:51,638
Excuse me?

866
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,429
What is happening here?

867
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:54,721
You didn't see them?

868
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:56,763
Some guys attacked us. - Sir...

869
01:04:57,075 --> 01:04:58,700
Do you even know...
- Sir, what's wrong?

870
01:04:58,804 --> 01:04:59,929
They had a big knife!

871
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:03,108
What happened?
- Can you please call the cops?

872
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:07,513
Where is the police station here?
- It's forty kilometres away.

873
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:09,330
Is there another entrance
to this hospital?

874
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:11,346
Yes, sir. There's an
entrance at the back.

875
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,263
Dude, it's the cops.

876
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:15,638
I can see that.

877
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:17,221
Come on.

878
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,190
What's the problem?

879
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,303
What is it?

880
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:30,596
Her father, Mr. Raman, admitted upstairs...
was attacked three days ago.

881
01:05:30,888 --> 01:05:32,388
Now two guys tried to kill her.

882
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:35,450
We need some policemen here.
Should we put in a request?

883
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:37,497
English... weak...No understand!
- He tells me NOW!

884
01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:41,272
You must come to the Police
Station, file a written complaint.

885
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,365
That's how you ask for
Police Protection!

886
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,679
Who are you?

887
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:49,473
I am her friend, sir.
I studied with her.

888
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:50,513
Who is she?

889
01:05:51,429 --> 01:05:54,054
She is Leela. Mr.
Raman's daughter.

890
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:56,054
What's your name?
- Chennai, sir.

891
01:05:56,346 --> 01:05:58,054
Your name is Chennai?

892
01:06:00,514 --> 01:06:01,306
Chennai?

893
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:04,179
Sir, my name is not Chennai.
I am from Chennai.

894
01:06:04,346 --> 01:06:05,096
Tamizh...

895
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:06,398
I am a Tamizhian.

896
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:09,346
Who just came now?
What happened?

897
01:06:09,455 --> 01:06:12,705
He hit them so hard... they
got scared and ran away.

898
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:13,856
Hit them?

899
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,679
You shouldn't have hit them.
You should have called us.

900
01:06:16,704 --> 01:06:18,204
I would have come immediately.

901
01:06:18,229 --> 01:06:20,104
Stupid baldie. He was
swinging the knife!

902
01:06:20,129 --> 01:06:23,254
You want me to call you at that time?
And request him to put the knife down?

903
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,671
By the time you come, they would have
killed her and we would all be dead.

904
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:28,096
Got it? They had a knife.

905
01:06:28,429 --> 01:06:30,029
The weapon is still
upstairs, sir.

906
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:31,733
They ran away. We
are all afraid.

907
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:33,358
Can you provide some security?

908
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:34,666
You're there, son.

909
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:37,259
You're there for everything.
To take care...

910
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:41,034
To provide security and protect... to
change nappies... you do everything!

911
01:06:41,296 --> 01:06:43,130
You here... police go!

912
01:06:43,155 --> 01:06:44,964
Run! Run! Run!

913
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,785
Sir, I don't expect a police
officer to talk like this.

914
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:49,929
I don't know why you're
behaving this way.

915
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:53,013
Kamath, come here...
- He is a scoundrel, dude.

916
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:54,388
Tambe, go check.

917
01:06:55,014 --> 01:06:55,806
Okay, sir.

918
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,926
Not you... call Kamath here.

919
01:06:58,272 --> 01:06:59,022
Sir?

920
01:06:59,346 --> 01:07:01,888
Sir, they're calling you.
Kamath!

921
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:03,741
Go, baldie.

922
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,016
He's calling you, sir.

923
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,565
Dude, I don't trust this guy.

924
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,358
You're also being rude.
It's not right.

925
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:14,054
That’s the guy who
attacked us upstairs.

926
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:15,307
I know.

927
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:18,165
He’s in a casual chat with them.
He's a frigging cop!

928
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:22,982
I understand now, sir.

929
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:24,741
What did you understand?

930
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:26,721
Come with me. Come on.

931
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,600
Who is it?

932
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:33,163
Sleep mom, go to sleep.

933
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:34,763
Don't worry, mom.
Everything is fine.

934
01:07:43,596 --> 01:07:46,971
Don't worry. I am here now. I
will take care of everything.

935
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:49,554
I don't want a circus here.

936
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,940
All of you leave now.

937
01:07:50,965 --> 01:07:53,924
Get going.
- Can't you hear? Get going.

938
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:57,298
My mom and dad are admitted here.
I should be with them.

939
01:07:57,596 --> 01:07:58,888
The others can leave.

940
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:01,901
Just the two of us, sir.
We will be here.

941
01:08:02,054 --> 01:08:04,263
Listen, son. You told me...

942
01:08:04,304 --> 01:08:06,846
Two guys came and attacked.
I get everything.

943
01:08:06,871 --> 01:08:09,996
But you shouldn't be here.
You should get going. Go!

944
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:15,554
No, sir.

945
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:17,939
She wants to be here with
her father and mother.

946
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:20,513
We'll just be here somewhere.
We won't disturb you.

947
01:08:21,302 --> 01:08:23,522
The hospital permits
just one attendant.

948
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,607
The girl's mother is
here, that's alright.

949
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,724
She can be her
husband's attendant.

950
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:29,458
Now the girl wants
to be here, too!

951
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:32,788
You want to tag along with her, and you
friend wants to tag along with you!

952
01:08:32,813 --> 01:08:34,355
You're driving me crazy!

953
01:08:34,638 --> 01:08:36,054
This is crazy!

954
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:39,513
This doesn't look like a hospital
that follows such rules.

955
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:43,096
Not the hospital’s rules.
My rules.

956
01:08:43,513 --> 01:08:45,929
No, sir... I am not
going anywhere.

957
01:08:47,974 --> 01:08:49,682
I just have to hit him.

958
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:53,596
I said, leave!

959
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:56,389
Hear what he said? Grab that guy!
- Please, sir.

960
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,416
Rascal!

961
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:00,982
You swore at me in your Chennai language?
Called me a mongrel?

962
01:09:01,114 --> 01:09:04,155
Get out of here. I
came here to help you!

963
01:09:04,304 --> 01:09:05,221
No! Sir!

964
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:10,804
Sir, can you please sit up?

965
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:14,099
There is a fracture in the
cartilage of your nose.

966
01:09:14,173 --> 01:09:15,673
I have fixed it for now.

967
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:18,268
It's going to bleed for a while.
You need to rest...

968
01:09:18,293 --> 01:09:21,543
It's fine. Are you even a doctor?
- I am a doctor, trying to help you.

969
01:09:21,596 --> 01:09:23,513
What kind of a hospital is this?

970
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:25,611
Do you have any idea what happened to us?
- Calm down, sir...

971
01:09:25,636 --> 01:09:27,845
If you keep moving, you
will continue to bleed.

972
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:29,791
I know I am fine.
What is all this?

973
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,373
Nothing to worry about.
There are cops upstairs.

974
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,881
Sir, one minute. Let me fix this...
- Please!

975
01:09:37,054 --> 01:09:37,967
There is no one else?

976
01:09:37,992 --> 01:09:40,617
There is one cop. They've
sent the others away.

977
01:09:41,132 --> 01:09:42,049
The others?

978
01:09:42,074 --> 01:09:44,491
The baldie who hit
you, he is gone.

979
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,548
There is another cop now, nothing to worry.
- What about your friends and relatives?

980
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:48,632
All of them left.

981
01:09:48,846 --> 01:09:49,888
He sent them all away.

982
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:51,221
Oh no! Dude...

983
01:09:51,304 --> 01:09:52,263
Listen to me.

984
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:55,096
For heaven's sake, the two of you
just stay here. Don't come out.

985
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:10,304
Sister, what do you want?

986
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:11,704
Go in!

987
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:13,895
Close the door.

988
01:10:14,179 --> 01:10:16,513
We can't set it up
better than this.

989
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:18,804
The nurse has been sent away,
the cameras are all turned off.

990
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:20,002
You want me to
throw a party now?

991
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:23,110
Don't get too comfortable. Get
the job done in five minutes.

992
01:10:23,221 --> 01:10:24,221
I'm leaving.

993
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:07,763
How did you...?

994
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:16,596
When I shot them...

995
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:20,739
I thought to myself, I had
a lot to tell my kids now.

996
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:25,923
"Dad got hit by a truck, got thrown
on a bus and still survived..."

997
01:11:26,084 --> 01:11:28,334
"hit two people who
came with knives..."

998
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:32,429
"threw a cop down a flight of stairs,
don’t even know what happened to him..."

999
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:37,054
"then grabbed his gun and shot two bad
guys HE should have ideally shot."

1000
01:11:37,154 --> 01:11:40,279
But then I thought, it's not the kind
of bed time story you tell children.

1001
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:44,054
You can’t tell kids that "Daddy’s
hands actually held a gun once"?

1002
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:47,087
Actually, I should say...
"Kids, you shouldn't

1003
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,991
hear any more of this.
So close your eyes now!"

1004
01:12:10,512 --> 01:12:11,887
Just hold on!

1005
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,345
It's okay. Please...

1006
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,362
Should we call someone? We
need to call the nurse!

1007
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,875
The cops on the floor
there, unconscious...!

1008
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:20,928
We'll call...

1009
01:12:20,987 --> 01:12:22,487
Hey, what is this?

1010
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:23,595
Mahesh... - Shit!

1011
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,803
You shot them?
- Calm down, listen to me...

1012
01:12:26,868 --> 01:12:28,368
Tell me. You did it? - YES.

1013
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,803
But, why? - I shot them.

1014
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:33,975
They're bad people. What would
you have me do? - How could you?

1015
01:12:34,012 --> 01:12:35,970
They tried to kill her
mother and father.

1016
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,720
I would have died, too.
You're okay with that?

1017
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:40,720
This is wrong, man.

1018
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:43,720
You shouldn't have come upstairs. Darn!
- What will they do? Where is Leela?

1019
01:12:43,762 --> 01:12:46,220
She's over there...
- She's safe, right?

1020
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:48,845
Sir, please don't do this...
- We MUST get out of here.

1021
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:50,303
Is there an ambulance?

1022
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:56,970
Mom, are you okay?

1023
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,345
He won't last too long.
He looks terrible.

1024
01:13:01,303 --> 01:13:03,720
What's your plan?
- I honestly don't know.

1025
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:07,137
All I know is, we'd have died
if we remained at the hospital.

1026
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,263
There would have
been more of them.

1027
01:13:12,553 --> 01:13:13,845
And there was the cop, too.

1028
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:16,237
Isn't there ONE good person
in the police department?

1029
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:17,262
There must be.

1030
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:21,373
Let's take them home?
- It'll be the same situation there, too.

1031
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,064
We'll take them to
another hospital.

1032
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:25,175
Check the nearest
town on your phone.

1033
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,617
Your phone has internet.
- Wait, man! I'll check.

1034
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,435
I think it's...

1035
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,460
Karwar or Belgaum?

1036
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:34,803
Yes, Bel-something...
- I think it's an hour and a half away.

1037
01:13:35,247 --> 01:13:37,456
Let's go to a police
station there.

1038
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,021
We'll tell them what happened.

1039
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:42,059
They have to help us.

1040
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:45,512
The police will help us take
him to another hospital.

1041
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:47,066
He must hang on till then.

1042
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:50,591
We can go to the police station... But
you've shot two people, killed them.

1043
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:54,053
What would you tell them?
Will they be understanding?

1044
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:56,675
We'll have to make them understand!
- Listen, please...

1045
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:03,297
Sir. You hired the ambulance
to drop you home.

1046
01:14:03,322 --> 01:14:04,614
I shall drop you home.

1047
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:07,133
Karwar is four hours away,
I can't drive you there...

1048
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:10,575
See? We told him we're going to Leela's.
He's causing trouble.

1049
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,274
It's fine if he can't take us. Ask
him to get off, we'll drive...

1050
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:23,196
What's happening?

1051
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,032
Mahesh, tell me
what's happening?

1052
01:14:25,345 --> 01:14:26,262
Dude!

1053
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,394
Mom, it's okay.
Everything's fine!

1054
01:14:30,419 --> 01:14:32,669
Is he dead? Dude, is he dead?

1055
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,470
Are they firing, Mahesh?
- Dude, hold on to him!

1056
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,223
Oh no! He fell, man. He fell!

1057
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:41,512
No!

1058
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,678
Get the wheel, dude!

1059
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,720
They're shooting.

1060
01:14:44,762 --> 01:14:46,053
I got the door!

1061
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:49,790
Who are they, Mahesh?
- Don't know, Leela.

1062
01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:51,565
Don't panic. Hang on!

1063
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:57,471
They're right after us.

1064
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:00,762
It's going to be okay, mom!

1065
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:03,845
Dude, keep driving.
- You don't panic. Come back.

1066
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:06,178
Do you know where we're headed?

1067
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:08,303
I do. You stop shouting now!

1068
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:10,470
Watch out...

1069
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:23,012
Are we okay, Mahesh?
- Their car's toppled!

1070
01:15:23,095 --> 01:15:24,512
Yes, yes! We're okay.

1071
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:26,069
Dude! Keep going. Go, go, go.
Don't stop!

1072
01:15:26,137 --> 01:15:27,803
Why won't you keep quiet?

1073
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:31,553
Dude, take the left turn.
Let's get to the highway.

1074
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,678
When did you learn to drive?

1075
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:37,536
I don't know! I'm
managing somehow.

1076
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,262
Keep going, man!

1077
01:15:41,259 --> 01:15:43,176
Watch out!

1078
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,012
Why have we stopped, Mahesh?

1079
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:49,012
Drag them out of the vehicle.

1080
01:15:49,595 --> 01:15:51,053
Let's run away, dude.

1081
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,461
Who are they, Mahesh?
- Hold on, Leela. It'll be okay.

1082
01:15:53,486 --> 01:15:55,111
Down! I said down!

1083
01:15:55,262 --> 01:15:56,220
Dude. Please...

1084
01:16:00,758 --> 01:16:02,841
Come on... Get down!

1085
01:16:04,004 --> 01:16:05,170
So, it was you?

1086
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,762
Drag them all down. All of them!

1087
01:16:09,957 --> 01:16:11,582
You didn't hear me?

1088
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,738
Dude! It hurts.

1089
01:16:13,763 --> 01:16:16,013
It hurts...
- It's okay. Hang in there.

1090
01:16:16,428 --> 01:16:18,637
1... 2...3...4...

1091
01:16:18,803 --> 01:16:21,637
Is that man lying inside? Kneel.

1092
01:16:22,381 --> 01:16:24,131
I said kneel, witches.

1093
01:16:25,354 --> 01:16:26,660
Please, please...
- I'll come to you later.

1094
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:28,185
You, kneel!

1095
01:16:28,447 --> 01:16:30,572
I'm talking to you!
- Yes, sir...

1096
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:31,970
You're Leela?

1097
01:16:32,137 --> 01:16:34,637
It's you we set out to kill.
He got in the way.

1098
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:36,720
It got a little messy.

1099
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:40,262
"Bang"! I could just shoot you.
- Please, sir...

1100
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,803
Is the old man still alive?

1101
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:44,334
Remove the life support, everything!
- Please!

1102
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:46,845
Don't kill him. Please...
- Don't do it, sir.

1103
01:16:47,246 --> 01:16:48,537
No, sir! Please...

1104
01:16:48,711 --> 01:16:51,009
What's your connection with them?
Why are you getting so excited?

1105
01:16:51,034 --> 01:16:52,909
What is she to you?
Are you doing her?

1106
01:16:53,012 --> 01:16:55,220
Are you a big-shot hero?
- No, sir.

1107
01:16:55,262 --> 01:16:57,512
You killed my men at the hospital?
- No...

1108
01:16:57,576 --> 01:17:00,201
Can I shoot you down? Huh?

1109
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:02,387
"BANG"! Shall I?

1110
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:04,083
You disconnected everything?

1111
01:17:04,108 --> 01:17:06,942
Leave. You have nothing to do with this.
You saw nothing.

1112
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:08,394
Run. - Please, sir...

1113
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:13,303
Why did you kill the nurse?

1114
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,004
Poor thing!
- She's dead, dude...

1115
01:17:16,661 --> 01:17:18,578
Hero, don't you get it?

1116
01:17:18,903 --> 01:17:22,653
If a good cop comes along,
there should be no loose ends.

1117
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:25,217
Hold this tight, leave
your print in this for me.

1118
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:28,347
Just squeeze your finger
here, that's all.

1119
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,443
Now, you'll shoot everybody.
Fine?

1120
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:33,926
Him. Her. Her mother. Her father.
Everybody.

1121
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:35,320
Alright? - Please, sir...

1122
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:37,345
Finally, you'll shoot yourself.

1123
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:38,490
Please... no, sir.

1124
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:40,692
Why? Hold this. - No..

1125
01:17:41,345 --> 01:17:43,512
Listen to me. Hold this...

1126
01:17:44,108 --> 01:17:45,919
You barged into the
scene like a hero!

1127
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:47,778
Now you kill your people.
I'll help you.

1128
01:17:47,803 --> 01:17:50,512
I'll hold your hand throughout.
Think I'll just give you the gun?

1129
01:17:50,553 --> 01:17:51,678
Don't want it, sir...

1130
01:17:51,866 --> 01:17:53,686
What? - No, no, no...

1131
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:54,378
What?

1132
01:17:54,512 --> 01:17:56,055
What? - I don't want that gun.

1133
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,996
HOLD IT! - I DON'T WANT IT.

1134
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,678
I HAVE ANOTHER GUN.

1135
01:17:59,703 --> 01:18:02,162
I told you to stop! Take that now.
Die!

1136
01:18:02,305 --> 01:18:03,555
Take that!

1137
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:04,637
Run!

1138
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,612
Run...

1139
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:08,262
Dude, over there! Shoot them.

1140
01:18:08,287 --> 01:18:09,829
You shoot them, man.

1141
01:18:10,262 --> 01:18:11,262
Come on, now!

1142
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:12,454
Come at me.

1143
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:15,498
I told you not to. Now take this.
Take this.

1144
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:16,845
Superb, man!

1145
01:18:16,887 --> 01:18:18,345
You did great, dude!

1146
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,262
We friggin' did it, dude!

1147
01:18:22,482 --> 01:18:23,649
Don't ever come back!

1148
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:27,084
Get in...

1149
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,839
Get into the ambulance.

1150
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,678
Let's go!

1151
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:40,610
Is she alright?

1152
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:41,678
She's alive.

1153
01:18:42,387 --> 01:18:43,178
Mom, is she okay?

1154
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:45,053
She is alive. Can we
go to a hospital?

1155
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,275
Is he dead?

1156
01:18:46,512 --> 01:18:47,803
You want to go check?

1157
01:18:47,845 --> 01:18:49,262
Mahesh, she's alive.

1158
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,053
What are we going to do?

1159
01:18:52,487 --> 01:18:54,445
How is your father?
- Don't know...

1160
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,053
She didn't disconnect anything.
Everything is intact.

1161
01:19:01,262 --> 01:19:02,637
How many of them were there?

1162
01:19:02,803 --> 01:19:03,762
Five of them.

1163
01:19:03,803 --> 01:19:05,762
They must be around here.
We must get moving.

1164
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,803
That's correct. We need
to go and hide somewhere.

1165
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:09,970
We can go in the ambulance.
Please, let's go.

1166
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,803
I know a place.

1167
01:19:13,303 --> 01:19:15,428
They're our family friends.
He's a doctor, too.

1168
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,345
Let's go to Dr.
Yashwanth's place, mom!

1169
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:18,762
Shall I phone them?

1170
01:19:19,032 --> 01:19:20,970
Call them right away.

1171
01:19:30,736 --> 01:19:32,278
Hi, Leela. Are you okay?

1172
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:34,410
Where is your father?
Did you tell him?

1173
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:36,845
I woke him up. He
will be right here.

1174
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:38,928
Leela, what happened?

1175
01:19:38,928 --> 01:19:40,387
Somebody attacked again?

1176
01:19:40,503 --> 01:19:42,044
Atul! Wheelchair and luggage.

1177
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:43,428
Don't worry!

1178
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:44,762
How could this happen?

1179
01:19:45,115 --> 01:19:45,824
Oh, god!

1180
01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:48,308
Wonder what'll happen here.
Let's help them, dude.

1181
01:19:49,582 --> 01:19:50,498
Atul!

1182
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,053
Mom, don't worry.
He will be fine.

1183
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:08,678
She's badly wounded, Leela.

1184
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,470
Been bare feet, stones...

1185
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,512
It hurts so bad!

1186
01:20:13,803 --> 01:20:15,345
That's all I can do for now.

1187
01:20:15,803 --> 01:20:17,137
I have treated them.

1188
01:20:17,387 --> 01:20:18,928
The nurse is still critical.

1189
01:20:19,845 --> 01:20:22,220
Your father is also very,
very critical, you know!

1190
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:26,178
We just have to shift him
somewhere for better care.

1191
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:29,553
Otherwise, I don't think
he will last much longer.

1192
01:20:30,012 --> 01:20:31,970
It's better we get the police involved.
- No...

1193
01:20:32,012 --> 01:20:33,678
No, doctor. That's
not possible at all.

1194
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,499
You have to call them. - There's
already a police officer involved.

1195
01:20:35,524 --> 01:20:37,024
We must inform the police.

1196
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:39,133
No, doctor... That'll
become a big problem!

1197
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:40,731
I know your concerns.

1198
01:20:40,976 --> 01:20:43,726
But whatever you have done, you
have done in your self-defence.

1199
01:20:43,803 --> 01:20:45,220
They will understand.
Don't worry.

1200
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,845
Come on. There are some
good police officers.

1201
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:50,762
I know some people in the
police department we can trust.

1202
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:52,053
I will talk to them.

1203
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:54,595
Devanshu- Assistant
Superintendent of Police.

1204
01:20:58,512 --> 01:20:59,553
No cops, dude.

1205
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,970
The cops here don't
even seem like cops!

1206
01:21:02,053 --> 01:21:04,053
Once you get locked up,
anything can happen.

1207
01:21:04,137 --> 01:21:05,970
Afterall, we've killed people!

1208
01:21:06,053 --> 01:21:08,053
He was trying to frame you,
back on the road there.

1209
01:21:08,303 --> 01:21:09,720
Shall I just tell my dad?

1210
01:21:09,985 --> 01:21:10,818
You think?

1211
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:14,209
What do I tell him? Over
the phone, that too.

1212
01:21:14,262 --> 01:21:15,720
How to make him understand?

1213
01:21:15,928 --> 01:21:18,678
He doesn't even know I'm with Leela.
I'll have to start from there.

1214
01:21:21,637 --> 01:21:24,470
We spent our lives playing and roaming
around, like a bunch of kids.

1215
01:21:25,595 --> 01:21:28,720
Suddenly, it feels as
though a decade has passed.

1216
01:21:30,271 --> 01:21:31,688
I feel like a man.

1217
01:21:37,637 --> 01:21:38,762
Come what may...

1218
01:21:38,803 --> 01:21:41,387
I feel like I can face it all.

1219
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,248
We're not cops.

1220
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:47,220
We're not thugs or
gangsters either.

1221
01:21:48,262 --> 01:21:50,595
We've never encountered
violence in our lives before.

1222
01:21:50,966 --> 01:21:54,508
There was just this small fight
when you hit someone for Maitreyi.

1223
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:55,486
That's it.

1224
01:21:56,678 --> 01:22:00,137
And I thought that was it. That I'd
lead a normal life, like everyone else.

1225
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:01,845
But that was then...

1226
01:22:03,459 --> 01:22:05,084
Anything can happen in life.

1227
01:22:06,095 --> 01:22:08,053
The question is...
are we ready for it?

1228
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,162
I have a gun in my hand today.

1229
01:22:14,727 --> 01:22:16,185
Two guns, actually.

1230
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,848
I've shot a few people.
I think I killed them.

1231
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:29,302
Only seen this in the
movies till now.

1232
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:32,595
Why do we need guns now?

1233
01:22:32,845 --> 01:22:34,251
We're here now. - Yeah!

1234
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,954
It's over now, right?

1235
01:22:36,137 --> 01:22:37,137
Yeah...

1236
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:39,095
We won't need it anymore.

1237
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,205
When the cops come, we'll
turn it over to them.

1238
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:42,105
Okay, dude.

1239
01:22:45,053 --> 01:22:46,262
I'm really sorry.

1240
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:48,678
All of this... was
because of me.

1241
01:22:49,345 --> 01:22:51,012
You should never have come here.

1242
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:52,678
I don't agree.

1243
01:22:53,012 --> 01:22:54,512
I was able to help you.

1244
01:22:55,774 --> 01:22:58,191
Maybe, that's why we even met.

1245
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,058
You staying in my home...

1246
01:23:00,387 --> 01:23:02,428
Coming on the road trip with me...
All of it!

1247
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,887
There's a reason for everything.
Think about it.

1248
01:23:10,712 --> 01:23:11,762
And then, there is love too.

1249
01:23:16,637 --> 01:23:20,387
After the accident, I was scared that I'd
die. That's why I told you I love you.

1250
01:23:22,251 --> 01:23:23,709
Bad timing, I know...

1251
01:23:24,178 --> 01:23:26,178
But what I said was right.

1252
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,259
At some point during
the road trip...

1253
01:23:31,412 --> 01:23:32,787
We made a connection. Here...

1254
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:36,944
This timing is not
great either, eh?

1255
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,637
But the stuff I'm
saying is correct.

1256
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,641
I love you, dude.

1257
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,012
Love you!

1258
01:23:44,574 --> 01:23:46,115
I love you too bro, go for it.

1259
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,637
Leela! - I...

1260
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,220
What are you doing here?

1261
01:23:49,303 --> 01:23:50,137
Come inside.

1262
01:23:50,428 --> 01:23:51,928
Go easy on yourselves.

1263
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,220
I will tell the police how
he helped the family.

1264
01:23:54,366 --> 01:23:56,200
By the way, you didn't
tell me your name.

1265
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:57,896
Dad, I'll just switch
on the motor pump.

1266
01:23:58,053 --> 01:23:59,678
What happened?
- There's no water on the tank.

1267
01:24:11,357 --> 01:24:12,316
Just relax.

1268
01:24:12,637 --> 01:24:14,470
Don't worry. I will
do the talking.

1269
01:24:27,553 --> 01:24:28,626
I told you so!

1270
01:24:28,678 --> 01:24:29,720
It's the same cop.

1271
01:24:35,678 --> 01:24:36,678
That's it.

1272
01:24:37,512 --> 01:24:38,845
I don't want to hear anything.

1273
01:24:39,214 --> 01:24:40,403
Just get into the jeep.

1274
01:24:40,428 --> 01:24:43,137
You hit a cop and stole his gun!

1275
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,970
Just get into the jeep.

1276
01:24:45,428 --> 01:24:46,178
Give me the gun.

1277
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:47,053
Give it!

1278
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:49,012
Is he the good officer
you were talking about?

1279
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:51,012
No! I don't know this guy.

1280
01:24:51,262 --> 01:24:54,595
I spoke to the control room and
asked for A.S.P. Devanshu!

1281
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:57,012
Devanshu has sent me.

1282
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:58,303
Don't get me worked up.

1283
01:24:58,328 --> 01:25:01,286
Uncle, you're getting
into big trouble.

1284
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:04,428
These people are very dirty fellows.
Bad fellows!

1285
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,345
Get in the vehicle now!

1286
01:25:12,553 --> 01:25:13,845
Now, watch the fun unfold.

1287
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,988
Dude, it's that guy again.

1288
01:25:20,099 --> 01:25:21,141
He's not dead.

1289
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,137
Mahesh, go inside. Take
Leela and go inside.

1290
01:25:30,928 --> 01:25:32,428
How does he have a gun?

1291
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:36,687
You screwed up, now they
are pointing guns at us.

1292
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,928
Get moving! Into the jeep...

1293
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:40,391
Get into the jeep now!

1294
01:25:40,612 --> 01:25:42,445
Oh god! No guns please.

1295
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,879
Officer, they are innocent.
Listen to me.

1296
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:46,575
I'm talking to the officer.
Please put...

1297
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,475
What are you doing?
- Inspector, please...

1298
01:25:48,887 --> 01:25:49,678
Atul!

1299
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:50,803
Atul?

1300
01:25:51,342 --> 01:25:52,301
What's that?

1301
01:25:53,222 --> 01:25:55,597
He almost shot me in the head...

1302
01:25:55,678 --> 01:25:58,262
would have blown my brains
out, barely got away.

1303
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,612
Dad...
- What are you doing, Atul?

1304
01:26:00,637 --> 01:26:02,137
I'll talk to you later.
Don't ask questions.

1305
01:26:02,553 --> 01:26:04,387
Please go inside, dad.

1306
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:05,762
Drop the gun.

1307
01:26:10,428 --> 01:26:11,470
Go inside.

1308
01:26:12,678 --> 01:26:15,720
Dude, get in! Quick...

1309
01:26:17,574 --> 01:26:19,615
He went that way.
Let's go to the back.

1310
01:26:21,704 --> 01:26:24,121
Doctor, what's happening? Are
you with us, or with them?

1311
01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:27,919
Of course I am with you! Didn't I
help you save the nurse's life?

1312
01:26:28,387 --> 01:26:30,595
Is there another entrance to the house?
- I locked the doors.

1313
01:26:30,762 --> 01:26:32,845
But, the balcony... They can
come through the stairs.

1314
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,735
Doctor, he's stopped breathing!
- Check on them, Mahesh.

1315
01:26:35,846 --> 01:26:36,929
Take them inside.

1316
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:39,079
Don't come out.
Doctor, please, go...

1317
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:52,388
Oh, no! - Mom!

1318
01:26:52,637 --> 01:26:53,553
Get back!

1319
01:26:54,194 --> 01:26:55,153
Dad, move aside.

1320
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:57,053
Saw my shot? - What's happening?

1321
01:26:57,887 --> 01:26:59,303
Oh my god!

1322
01:27:00,894 --> 01:27:04,652
Why are you killing innocent people?
Why are you doing this, Atul?

1323
01:27:05,293 --> 01:27:07,043
Where's that mongrel? Take that.

1324
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,060
Father!

1325
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:11,410
Father, move away!

1326
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:12,988
Come out, I'll let you go.

1327
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:23,394
Father, open the back door!

1328
01:27:27,512 --> 01:27:29,428
Who are you, boy? Son of a...!

1329
01:27:33,676 --> 01:27:36,759
Mahesh...
- Leela, wait. Stay there, I'm coming.

1330
01:27:36,887 --> 01:27:38,595
Don't come out.

1331
01:27:38,637 --> 01:27:40,845
They're innocent people!

1332
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:43,803
My hands are itching to shoot.
Better ask your father to move.

1333
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:46,512
Don't touch the phone, father!
- I'm calling the police.

1334
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,428
Don't come out, dad.

1335
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:52,053
Atul, you're making a mistake.

1336
01:27:52,137 --> 01:27:54,178
Why are you doing this?

1337
01:27:55,678 --> 01:27:57,053
They shot my mother.

1338
01:27:58,423 --> 01:27:59,798
You scared little boy. Come out!

1339
01:28:02,303 --> 01:28:03,303
I'm here, Leela.

1340
01:28:04,532 --> 01:28:06,470
They shot them both.

1341
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:10,637
Through the window. Mahesh
and my mother are dead.

1342
01:28:11,012 --> 01:28:12,970
It was that police officer.

1343
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:28,762
Now you're left. I'll
shoot you down, too.

1344
01:28:30,262 --> 01:28:32,262
Come out, you wuss!

1345
01:28:32,309 --> 01:28:36,017
Let's get out of here, please.
Let's just leave.

1346
01:28:38,402 --> 01:28:39,443
Wait!

1347
01:28:44,505 --> 01:28:46,922
You can't hide in the dark.

1348
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,637
Leela, go!

1349
01:28:52,053 --> 01:28:53,512
You can't hide from me.

1350
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:57,630
Come on.

1351
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,092
I don't think he's come out.

1352
01:29:09,137 --> 01:29:10,887
Go that way. I'll
come the other way.

1353
01:29:13,712 --> 01:29:15,378
They're not here. We have to go.

1354
01:29:15,403 --> 01:29:16,528
My mom and dad!

1355
01:29:16,553 --> 01:29:18,845
Don't even know what's happened to dad!
- Leela, we have to go.

1356
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:20,184
I can't die here.

1357
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:22,197
We have to get out of here.
Understand?

1358
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:23,722
How could I leave them behind?

1359
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:25,178
Come on!

1360
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:56,503
You are so dead now.

1361
01:29:56,553 --> 01:29:57,595
Die!

1362
01:29:59,681 --> 01:30:01,639
I got the gun.
Shall I shoot him?

1363
01:30:06,387 --> 01:30:07,470
Shall I shoot him?

1364
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:09,478
It's not working.

1365
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,303
Please...

1366
01:30:31,349 --> 01:30:32,266
Give me the gun.

1367
01:30:50,298 --> 01:30:51,256
Sit.

1368
01:32:01,194 --> 01:32:03,194
Suddenly, something struck me.

1369
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:05,944
We can’t let fear chase us.

1370
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:08,475
We must chase fear away.

1371
01:32:08,652 --> 01:32:10,360
I'm taking a U-turn.

1372
01:32:17,402 --> 01:32:18,319
What's happened?

1373
01:32:26,649 --> 01:32:28,566
I'm so pissed off.

1374
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:32,233
With a police officer in
tow and he hit me too.

1375
01:32:34,807 --> 01:32:36,849
It's the biggest
mistake of his life.

1376
01:32:38,232 --> 01:32:40,190
The police are meant
to protect us.

1377
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:45,569
Mahesh...

1378
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:47,945
I couldn't save him.

1379
01:32:49,419 --> 01:32:50,335
Your mother...

1380
01:32:50,418 --> 01:32:52,502
Don't know what's happened
to your father...

1381
01:32:52,527 --> 01:32:53,427
My bike!

1382
01:32:53,688 --> 01:32:54,730
That nurse...

1383
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,152
You.

1384
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:59,194
They're fearless.

1385
01:33:01,394 --> 01:33:03,269
I'm not afraid either.

1386
01:33:03,985 --> 01:33:05,694
I shouldn't run away.

1387
01:33:08,006 --> 01:33:10,881
They'll lock me up anyway,
I don't give a damn.

1388
01:33:11,131 --> 01:33:12,964
We'll see it through.
No matter what.

1389
01:33:15,066 --> 01:33:18,108
It’s only hard to die when
you've seen too much of life.

1390
01:33:19,597 --> 01:33:22,264
I've seen nothing, I
don't care Leela.

1391
01:33:23,652 --> 01:33:24,860
You get off somewhere.

1392
01:33:25,277 --> 01:33:26,152
You should.

1393
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:30,735
But I'm going after them.

1394
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:33,402
I don't know what I'll do.

1395
01:33:34,069 --> 01:33:35,652
But I'm going back there.

1396
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,652
I need to know why
they did this.

1397
01:33:47,902 --> 01:33:50,819
I'm going to get them all.
They won't know what hit them.

1398
01:33:55,277 --> 01:33:57,694
Tell me where you want to go.
I'll drop you there.

1399
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,902
Nowhere.

1400
01:34:01,194 --> 01:34:02,152
I'm with you.

1401
01:34:02,485 --> 01:34:03,319
Let's go.

1402
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:05,735
I'll go with you. Wherever.

1403
01:34:21,444 --> 01:34:23,485
Look, policeman...
- Calm down, father!

1404
01:34:23,485 --> 01:34:24,819
I'll explain. Calm down!

1405
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,402
I'll explain everything.
You go in.

1406
01:34:27,444 --> 01:34:29,569
Tell him to chill.
- Come with me, dad.

1407
01:34:29,594 --> 01:34:30,386
Open the door!

1408
01:34:30,411 --> 01:34:33,120
Your dad is a mad man.
- Where is the other mad man?

1409
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:58,810
You can't force me.
- Hold still, uncle.

1410
01:34:58,835 --> 01:35:01,210
What's with all the drama, uncle?
- I know the commissioner!

1411
01:35:01,235 --> 01:35:03,527
Sure, go to the commissioner.

1412
01:35:03,569 --> 01:35:06,685
You're talking too much, uncle.
Oh, shut up.

1413
01:35:06,902 --> 01:35:08,527
Atul! Come on...

1414
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:10,527
He's battered my brain!

1415
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:36,027
No, no. I don't believe you.
Not Leela! No way.

1416
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:38,319
Let's go, dad. - I won't come!

1417
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:41,610
Dad, I'll explain everything.
Let's go.

1418
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,860
I'm your father! I'll hit you!

1419
01:35:43,902 --> 01:35:46,110
Come inside, I'll explain everything.
- No, I won't.

1420
01:35:46,152 --> 01:35:49,444
Take me somewhere and kill me, too!
I'll be free!

1421
01:36:01,652 --> 01:36:02,402
Leela...

1422
01:36:02,527 --> 01:36:06,027
I need you with me or I
do this without you.

1423
01:36:06,943 --> 01:36:09,443
This is not the time
to cry or mourn.

1424
01:36:10,427 --> 01:36:11,373
Not now.

1425
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:13,440
I need you, Leela.

1426
01:36:14,485 --> 01:36:15,194
Okay.

1427
01:36:18,347 --> 01:36:19,597
I need you to be safe.

1428
01:36:19,652 --> 01:36:21,819
We'll get a room here,
you stay inside.

1429
01:36:24,464 --> 01:36:26,214
Look... here's the gun.

1430
01:36:26,277 --> 01:36:27,277
Use it.

1431
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,569
Don't be afraid.

1432
01:36:28,735 --> 01:36:30,069
Use it if you need to.

1433
01:36:30,944 --> 01:36:33,527
Careful on your way in.
They shouldn’t see you.

1434
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:35,914
Call me once you're
inside the room.

1435
01:36:36,027 --> 01:36:38,194
Call to Mahesh’s phone.
Tell me the room number.

1436
01:36:38,985 --> 01:36:40,735
I'll come in after five minutes.

1437
01:36:40,902 --> 01:36:44,152
Check in saying single
occupancy, one day. Okay?

1438
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:46,235
You’ll be fine. Okay? Go.

1439
01:36:47,206 --> 01:36:48,039
Don't worry.

1440
01:36:48,357 --> 01:36:50,023
Go! Cover your face and go.

1441
01:36:52,485 --> 01:36:53,569
Cover up properly.

1442
01:36:54,152 --> 01:36:54,860
Go.

1443
01:36:55,175 --> 01:36:57,425
Trust me, I'll handle it.
I’ll come.

1444
01:37:15,735 --> 01:37:17,402
I had a plan in mind.

1445
01:37:17,777 --> 01:37:20,402
If I find the room where the good
doctor and Atul are staying in...

1446
01:37:20,444 --> 01:37:22,277
and beat the hell out of Atul...

1447
01:37:23,027 --> 01:37:25,569
I'll know who is behind this.

1448
01:37:27,194 --> 01:37:29,860
It's a good thing your mother
didn't live to see this.

1449
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:31,794
She couldn't have taken this!

1450
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,291
What's become of you?

1451
01:37:33,316 --> 01:37:34,733
Why did you kill them?

1452
01:37:34,944 --> 01:37:36,485
You killed them in our house!

1453
01:37:36,652 --> 01:37:37,777
In my house!

1454
01:37:37,802 --> 01:37:40,343
I'm a doctor! I save lives.
- Calm down, father.

1455
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:41,652
Calm down.

1456
01:37:54,152 --> 01:37:56,402
You're evil!
- Look at me. Relax!

1457
01:37:56,569 --> 01:37:58,902
Dad, calm down.
- This is because of your party work!

1458
01:37:59,152 --> 01:38:01,152
There's a big problem!

1459
01:38:01,444 --> 01:38:03,527
Kamath will be here. I'm
only asking for ten minutes.

1460
01:38:03,569 --> 01:38:04,902
Just ten minutes!

1461
01:38:05,277 --> 01:38:07,069
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

1462
01:38:17,777 --> 01:38:19,360
No! Kamath sir... Are
you coming here?

1463
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:22,486
My father is furious. He needs
to know what's happening.

1464
01:38:22,612 --> 01:38:24,945
Shall I give him the phone?
You'll talk to him?

1465
01:38:40,539 --> 01:38:41,581
Hey Atul...

1466
01:38:50,084 --> 01:38:51,375
Where is your dad?

1467
01:38:52,402 --> 01:38:53,402
Doctor?

1468
01:39:32,527 --> 01:39:35,069
I've used the gun twice, I'm getting used
to firing the gun. Why did you kill them?

1469
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:37,194
I won’t hesitate to shoot
you and walk away.

1470
01:39:38,277 --> 01:39:39,527
Why did you kill my friend?

1471
01:39:39,793 --> 01:39:40,960
Who the hell are you people?

1472
01:39:40,985 --> 01:39:42,027
You dared to kill my friend!

1473
01:39:42,152 --> 01:39:43,402
You killed my friend!

1474
01:40:51,986 --> 01:40:52,944
Die!

1475
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:09,777
Not everything in life goes
according to our plan.

1476
01:41:10,027 --> 01:41:14,235
Sometimes, extraordinary things happen
that change even the best laid plans.

1477
01:41:18,402 --> 01:41:19,694
Come out of the room. - Okay.

1478
01:41:19,777 --> 01:41:20,902
Get the bag.

1479
01:41:20,944 --> 01:41:23,402
Don't leave anything behind.
Leave the room now.

1480
01:41:23,485 --> 01:41:24,652
Is everything okay?

1481
01:41:24,694 --> 01:41:25,444
No.

1482
01:41:26,444 --> 01:41:27,694
But it's all over.

1483
01:41:28,277 --> 01:41:30,444
Except for the cop...
it's all over.

1484
01:41:31,902 --> 01:41:32,902
Come now.

1485
01:41:32,985 --> 01:41:34,527
I need to find the doctor.

1486
01:41:34,883 --> 01:41:37,008
Did you hear that noise?
- Leela?

1487
01:41:38,694 --> 01:41:40,485
Don't worry. Just come out.

1488
01:41:40,819 --> 01:41:42,944
I heard gunshots from inside.

1489
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:44,652
Open the door.

1490
01:41:45,527 --> 01:41:46,527
Let's look.

1491
01:41:46,552 --> 01:41:47,544
Where are you? - I'm here.

1492
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:49,819
I see you. Keep coming.

1493
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:57,944
Kamath!

1494
01:42:01,842 --> 01:42:03,175
Come on, quick!

1495
01:42:09,777 --> 01:42:10,777
Leela!

1496
01:42:12,441 --> 01:42:15,233
Raman's daughter! Let's go.
- Why should I come with you?

1497
01:42:15,539 --> 01:42:16,539
You killed my mother!

1498
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:18,027
What did you do to my father?

1499
01:42:18,052 --> 01:42:20,135
You murderer!
- Shush! Where are you going?

1500
01:42:20,194 --> 01:42:22,110
No! - Come with me, girl.

1501
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:22,985
Come!

1502
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:00,797
It's nothing. Just
some drunkard!

1503
01:43:00,822 --> 01:43:03,322
Go inside. There's some
issue upstairs, go check.

1504
01:43:03,735 --> 01:43:04,569
Go on!

1505
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:07,777
Hello? Yes, Kamath speaking.

1506
01:43:07,944 --> 01:43:09,277
Note down the vehicle's
plate number.

1507
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:10,777
MH 102545

1508
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,902
A bearded guy...

1509
01:43:12,235 --> 01:43:13,735
He's gone towards Balki Chowk.

1510
01:43:13,902 --> 01:43:15,985
Find him and bring him
straight to the guest house.

1511
01:43:16,235 --> 01:43:17,777
Don't take him to
the police station.

1512
01:43:17,918 --> 01:43:19,402
What's going on here?

1513
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:21,425
Out of the way! Move!

1514
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:23,735
Go out. - Check everything.

1515
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:25,319
Son of a...!

1516
01:43:35,069 --> 01:43:36,152
Mom!

1517
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,034
Mom...

1518
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:56,069
Mom...

1519
01:43:56,977 --> 01:43:58,102
Mom...

1520
01:44:00,258 --> 01:44:02,758
Cry. Cry your heart out.

1521
01:44:03,941 --> 01:44:05,191
We have a lot of time.

1522
01:44:07,782 --> 01:44:09,032
I'm really sorry!

1523
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,813
If I could do this...

1524
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,722
and change everything
in a second, I would!

1525
01:44:17,902 --> 01:44:21,902
Forgive me. I thought we’ll be
killed if we stayed at the hospital

1526
01:44:23,178 --> 01:44:24,594
But they got killed anyway.

1527
01:44:26,805 --> 01:44:28,097
I'm really sorry, Leela.

1528
01:44:28,652 --> 01:44:29,735
It's my fault.

1529
01:44:34,086 --> 01:44:35,169
I'm responsible.

1530
01:44:35,232 --> 01:44:36,732
You're not responsible for this.

1531
01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:39,793
Mahesh is dead, Leela.

1532
01:44:42,284 --> 01:44:43,742
He came here for me.

1533
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:46,444
Everything changed in a second!

1534
01:44:46,654 --> 01:44:47,695
He's dead.

1535
01:44:47,819 --> 01:44:49,152
He's twenty, Leela!

1536
01:44:50,824 --> 01:44:53,169
My friend, Leela...

1537
01:44:53,303 --> 01:44:54,469
he's dead.

1538
01:44:58,175 --> 01:45:00,675
What will I tell his dad?

1539
01:45:01,694 --> 01:45:04,069
How will I even step
into his house?

1540
01:45:39,194 --> 01:45:40,860
Let's just get out of here!

1541
01:45:40,902 --> 01:45:43,777
Please... he's a police officer.
Let's just go!

1542
01:46:03,555 --> 01:46:05,597
There you are!

1543
01:46:08,194 --> 01:46:10,777
I know how to send you off.

1544
01:46:10,883 --> 01:46:12,967
Where's the gun? Huh?
Where, where, where?

1545
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,610
Please, sir.

1546
01:46:14,945 --> 01:46:17,070
I threw them away.
- Do not have it?

1547
01:46:17,482 --> 01:46:19,148
Your guy speaks
too much English.

1548
01:46:19,652 --> 01:46:21,610
Where is it? Where?

1549
01:46:21,878 --> 01:46:24,295
Somewhere on the way.
- Somewhere?

1550
01:46:24,527 --> 01:46:25,444
Rascal!

1551
01:46:25,617 --> 01:46:26,784
Oh well...

1552
01:46:34,027 --> 01:46:35,360
What's this?

1553
01:46:36,594 --> 01:46:38,469
And you said you don't have it?

1554
01:46:42,086 --> 01:46:43,334
Please, sir.

1555
01:46:44,919 --> 01:46:46,044
No, please.

1556
01:46:46,069 --> 01:46:47,444
I'm shooting your girl down!

1557
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:48,319
Please!

1558
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,027
Leela!

1559
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,902
Tambe, get him!

1560
01:47:08,527 --> 01:47:09,735
Thrash the mongrel!

1561
01:47:14,777 --> 01:47:16,694
I'll get you!

1562
01:47:24,829 --> 01:47:26,121
Oh, bugger!

1563
01:47:46,389 --> 01:47:49,931
I will thrash you, you mongrel!

1564
01:47:53,937 --> 01:47:55,229
Leela...

1565
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:56,485
Leela, you're fine.

1566
01:47:56,527 --> 01:47:57,569
Leela... please!

1567
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:58,860
Leela, please...

1568
01:47:58,985 --> 01:48:00,069
Oh no!

1569
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,860
Leela, please don't leave me.

1570
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:07,694
Please, please, please! Leela...

1571
01:48:08,069 --> 01:48:09,694
Don't leave me, Leela.

1572
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:10,944
Please, Leela!

1573
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:13,110
My god! She's gone...

1574
01:48:16,069 --> 01:48:18,569
In the end, he shot Leela too...

1575
01:48:20,069 --> 01:48:21,985
And I still couldn't kill him.

1576
01:48:22,735 --> 01:48:24,485
I couldn't shoot him down.

1577
01:48:25,539 --> 01:48:27,164
He is a police officer.

1578
01:48:27,444 --> 01:48:29,027
And I'm just an ordinary guy.

1579
01:48:29,194 --> 01:48:30,610
How can I kill him?

1580
01:48:30,694 --> 01:48:32,610
But I should...

1581
01:48:39,842 --> 01:48:41,425
Leela, you're fine.

1582
01:49:51,478 --> 01:49:53,562
You're okay, don't worry...

1583
01:49:53,645 --> 01:49:55,312
Just hold on.

1584
01:49:56,562 --> 01:49:57,312
Shit!

1585
01:49:57,353 --> 01:50:00,187
Please... don't do this!

1586
01:50:00,328 --> 01:50:02,703
Don't worry, I'll take you to a hospital.
- No!

1587
01:50:02,876 --> 01:50:05,876
Stop doing things for me.
No more.

1588
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,136
No more. Please.

1589
01:50:08,161 --> 01:50:09,203
Let it go.

1590
01:50:09,386 --> 01:50:11,620
You'll get into more
trouble because of me.

1591
01:50:11,645 --> 01:50:14,270
Go away, now. Leave me.
- No way!

1592
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,532
This is not just for you.

1593
01:50:17,384 --> 01:50:18,426
Not just you!

1594
01:50:43,557 --> 01:50:45,307
Tell me your name.

1595
01:50:45,493 --> 01:50:47,785
Tell me your name, before I die.

1596
01:50:47,995 --> 01:50:49,453
I'm not gonna let you die!

1597
01:50:49,478 --> 01:50:50,728
I'm not gonna let you die...

1598
01:51:02,741 --> 01:51:04,657
I can't imagine dying
without telling you this.

1599
01:51:06,537 --> 01:51:08,287
it would be a terrible mistake.

1600
01:51:10,723 --> 01:51:12,973
I don't know if there's any
point in saying it now.

1601
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:15,325
But I'll say it anyway.

1602
01:51:15,812 --> 01:51:16,853
What is it?

1603
01:51:18,132 --> 01:51:19,298
I love you.

1604
01:51:20,121 --> 01:51:21,121
I love you.

1605
01:51:22,053 --> 01:51:23,136
I love you.

1606
01:51:24,999 --> 01:51:27,040
I love you too, actually.

1607
01:51:31,234 --> 01:51:33,150
Now, you're my hero.

1608
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,882
But that's not why...

1609
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:37,441
Even before all this...

1610
01:51:45,968 --> 01:51:47,259
You know when?

1611
01:51:48,478 --> 01:51:49,562
I know.

1612
01:51:51,632 --> 01:51:52,716
When?

1613
01:51:52,853 --> 01:51:55,187
In Kanyakumari, at the hotel...

1614
01:51:55,403 --> 01:51:57,977
I told you to use the
room and waited outside.

1615
01:51:58,603 --> 01:51:59,645
That's when.

1616
01:51:59,937 --> 01:52:01,645
Oh, god. Yes!

1617
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:03,812
Was it so obvious?

1618
01:52:03,853 --> 01:52:05,395
Yes, I saw it in your eyes.

1619
01:52:06,312 --> 01:52:07,520
I knew for sure.

1620
01:52:07,853 --> 01:52:12,937
That's why I had the courage to tell
you, lying on your lap, on the road...

1621
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:14,437
And I'll say it again now.

1622
01:52:14,532 --> 01:52:15,991
I love you, Leela.

1623
01:52:50,895 --> 01:52:53,812
Two people found murdered
at a hotel at Kolhapur.

1624
01:52:53,837 --> 01:52:56,146
This incident has sent
shockwaves throughout the town.

1625
01:52:56,171 --> 01:53:00,611
Two men found dead... in the
rooms of a private hotel.

1626
01:53:01,103 --> 01:53:03,353
Eye-witnesses
recollect hearing...

1627
01:53:03,395 --> 01:53:04,145
Sir!

1628
01:53:05,853 --> 01:53:07,437
Zoom in!

1629
01:53:07,478 --> 01:53:08,895
Yes, hold it!

1630
01:53:09,437 --> 01:53:11,728
I can't see his face.
This footage is useless.

1631
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,817
Mongrel!

1632
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:16,812
The cameras in the hospital were shut too.
So no footage there, either.

1633
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:19,790
Sir, we're on the hunt.

1634
01:53:20,145 --> 01:53:21,562
What will he do?

1635
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:24,020
Search in every hospital.

1636
01:53:24,412 --> 01:53:26,912
What will he do with that
girl's dead body? Marry it?

1637
01:53:26,954 --> 01:53:30,162
If the chick is alive, where is she?
Which hospital?

1638
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:32,660
Anyone who brings that
man, dead or alive...

1639
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:34,787
gets a prize! A hundred
thousand rupees!

1640
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:36,333
Offer valid today and tomorrow.

1641
01:53:36,358 --> 01:53:38,399
And be happy. No sorrow!

1642
01:53:38,507 --> 01:53:42,257
Mahesh-the boy on the bike...?
His father...

1643
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:45,395
Sir, this is Mahesh's
father speaking...

1644
01:53:45,661 --> 01:53:47,203
Sir, I want my son!

1645
01:53:47,228 --> 01:53:49,228
I want my son...

1646
01:53:49,603 --> 01:53:52,687
I don't speak Hindi! I
want my son, sir...

1647
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:59,912
A few days ago, five people were
found dead by the police...

1648
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:04,603
in an ambulance owned by a private
hospital in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.

1649
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:09,612
A social worker Raman,
his wife Kalpana...

1650
01:54:09,645 --> 01:54:14,145
the ambulance driver, a nurse and
Mahesh - a boy from Chennai...

1651
01:54:14,495 --> 01:54:17,884
were shot dead by unidentified
men, say the police.

1652
01:54:18,228 --> 01:54:21,437
This horrific incident
has shocked the state.

1653
01:54:21,603 --> 01:54:24,728
The motive behind these deaths is still unknown
after the first round of investigation.

1654
01:54:24,812 --> 01:54:32,103
But it's said that Mahesh was killed while
trying to help them move to a safe location.

1655
01:55:29,512 --> 01:55:31,262
Greetings. How are you?

1656
01:55:31,287 --> 01:55:31,995
Yes?

1657
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:33,687
Kamath from Kolhapur division.

1658
01:55:34,103 --> 01:55:35,203
How can I help you?

1659
01:55:35,228 --> 01:55:36,062
Sit.

1660
01:55:36,617 --> 01:55:37,575
Tell me.

1661
01:55:38,312 --> 01:55:40,770
A case has been filed.

1662
01:55:41,203 --> 01:55:43,424
The deceased, Mahesh,
was riding the bike.

1663
01:55:43,478 --> 01:55:46,498
But it's registered under your name.
So we wanted to enquire...

1664
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:48,356
Mahesh was my son's friend.

1665
01:55:49,059 --> 01:55:50,767
He took our bike.

1666
01:55:50,978 --> 01:55:51,978
With the girl.

1667
01:55:52,038 --> 01:55:53,913
They went on the road trip.

1668
01:55:54,187 --> 01:55:56,145
Mahesh called me when the
accident took place.

1669
01:55:56,603 --> 01:55:57,895
I mean, I know this.

1670
01:55:57,978 --> 01:55:59,145
So what's the big deal?

1671
01:56:00,499 --> 01:56:01,540
Big deal?

1672
01:56:01,853 --> 01:56:03,812
Where's your son?
- He's here, at home.

1673
01:56:03,895 --> 01:56:05,103
Your son's name?

1674
01:56:07,187 --> 01:56:07,895
His name?

1675
01:56:07,937 --> 01:56:08,853
Rajinikanth.

1676
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:13,228
Rajinikanth...

1677
01:56:13,645 --> 01:56:14,395
Yes.

1678
01:56:15,934 --> 01:56:17,017
Excellent!

1679
01:56:18,062 --> 01:56:19,312
Rajinikanth, huh?

1680
01:56:20,363 --> 01:56:22,155
Take me for a moron, uncle?

1681
01:56:22,203 --> 01:56:23,728
Don't try to mess with me.

1682
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:26,895
If I start swearing, I won't
spare your mother or sisters.

1683
01:56:26,937 --> 01:56:27,853
Tell him!

1684
01:56:28,062 --> 01:56:29,103
Okay, hold on.

1685
01:56:29,228 --> 01:56:30,270
Son! Rajini...

1686
01:56:31,353 --> 01:56:32,187
Come here.

1687
01:56:34,395 --> 01:56:36,187
My son. Rajinikanth.

1688
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:42,619
You- Rajini?

1689
01:56:42,728 --> 01:56:43,478
Yeah.

1690
01:56:44,812 --> 01:56:47,228
You see, there was
someone with Mahesh.

1691
01:56:47,353 --> 01:56:48,603
They've come looking for him.

1692
01:56:48,645 --> 01:56:50,853
Please do co-operate.
- I'm ready to co-operate.

1693
01:56:51,562 --> 01:56:52,687
Thank you, uncle.

1694
01:56:53,062 --> 01:56:53,978
Thank you.

1695
01:57:01,872 --> 01:57:04,203
You've been trying for so many months!
- We are trying, sir.

1696
01:57:04,228 --> 01:57:07,312
Tell me. Where should I transfer you to?
- Sir, I'm sorry...

1697
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:09,687
Be prepared. You'll get the
transfer order tomorrow.

1698
01:57:09,812 --> 01:57:10,978
Sir, no...

1699
01:57:11,687 --> 01:57:17,478
That mongrel has ruined everything I've
earned in all these years as a policeman!

1700
01:57:17,562 --> 01:57:19,603
I feel like hitting
somebody now.

1701
01:57:21,145 --> 01:57:23,437
Don't hit me, sir!

1702
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,953
It hurts, sir!

1703
01:57:25,978 --> 01:57:26,812
Come here, darling.

1704
01:57:43,228 --> 01:57:43,978
Sir...

1705
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:47,145
Here are the details of the new
officers who will take charge today.

1706
01:57:58,145 --> 01:57:59,145
Sir, it's a little...

1707
01:58:00,165 --> 01:58:02,499
I have urgent work now.
- What's wrong with you?

1708
01:58:03,145 --> 01:58:05,187
Why are you so stressed?
- It's nothing, sir.

1709
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,937
Chill out. - Okay, sir.

1710
01:58:41,145 --> 01:58:43,228
And this is...

1711
01:58:43,978 --> 01:58:46,978
The story of how this Rajinikanth
became a police officer.

1712
01:58:47,907 --> 01:58:49,199
My mom is a huge fan.

1713
01:58:49,712 --> 01:58:51,671
So when I was born, she
didn't think twice.

1714
01:58:51,866 --> 01:58:53,011
I was named after him.

1715
01:58:53,036 --> 01:58:54,078
Rajinikanth.

1716
01:58:56,187 --> 01:59:00,395
Just open the telephone directory,
you'll find, in Tamil Nadu alone...

1717
01:59:00,559 --> 01:59:02,434
Many named Rajinikanth.

1718
01:59:02,687 --> 01:59:07,395
But wherever I go... school,
college or somewhere outside...

1719
01:59:07,562 --> 01:59:11,895
when someone asks for my name
and I say "Rajinikanth"...

1720
01:59:12,062 --> 01:59:14,520
everyone stares an
extra three seconds.

1721
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:17,353
So I don't say it
most of the time.

1722
01:59:17,603 --> 01:59:19,478
Many people don't
even believe me.

1723
01:59:19,645 --> 01:59:23,270
A lot of people react the
same way Kamath did.

1724
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:03,728
And this...

1725
02:00:03,895 --> 02:00:07,520
is the first episode of My
Life As a Police Officer.

1726
02:00:10,499 --> 02:00:11,499
Kamath!

1727
02:00:23,937 --> 02:00:26,187
The last time we met...

1728
02:00:27,532 --> 02:00:28,699
since then...

1729
02:00:30,187 --> 02:00:31,853
I have learnt a
little bit of Hindi.

1730
02:00:32,395 --> 02:00:35,228
Actually, a lot has
happened since we last met.

1731
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:37,187
After you came home...

1732
02:00:37,353 --> 02:00:39,103
I came here twenty days later.

1733
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:40,812
I have come here
many times since.

1734
02:00:40,812 --> 02:00:43,478
I've waited outside the
station to see you.

1735
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,020
To kill you. Nothing else.

1736
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:48,562
I couldn't bear to see you
throw your weight around.

1737
02:00:48,603 --> 02:00:51,812
I couldn't handle it.
I felt envious.

1738
02:00:51,884 --> 02:00:54,384
And then I thought, I
should be in your place.

1739
02:00:54,454 --> 02:00:55,620
But with one difference...

1740
02:00:55,645 --> 02:00:57,728
I wanted to be a good policeman.

1741
02:00:57,870 --> 02:01:00,787
I swear to you, only
when I saw you here...

1742
02:01:00,829 --> 02:01:02,537
I knew I wanted to
put on this uniform.

1743
02:01:02,562 --> 02:01:03,520
And that's why...

1744
02:01:03,665 --> 02:01:05,665
unknown to anyone,
I lived in hiding.

1745
02:01:06,145 --> 02:01:08,812
I wrote the Union Public Service
Commission exams and passed.

1746
02:01:08,853 --> 02:01:13,020
I turned down the Indian Administrative
Services, and chose the Indian Police Service.

1747
02:01:13,085 --> 02:01:15,960
After the official Police
Verification at my residence...

1748
02:01:16,934 --> 02:01:19,184
I spent one and a half years in
police training at Hyderabad.

1749
02:01:19,965 --> 02:01:21,965
Then I got my first
posting at Pune.

1750
02:01:22,145 --> 02:01:23,687
As an undercover cop.

1751
02:01:23,978 --> 02:01:28,603
Then, I insisted on being
posted here and here I am!

1752
02:01:29,714 --> 02:01:32,547
I was aimless in life...

1753
02:01:34,228 --> 02:01:36,770
You're the one who turned
me into a policeman.

1754
02:01:37,687 --> 02:01:39,062
And for that...

1755
02:01:39,812 --> 02:01:40,895
I must thank you.

1756
02:01:45,978 --> 02:01:50,687
Baldie, everytime I saw you, I wondered
why you destroyed that family.

1757
02:01:51,006 --> 02:01:52,714
Dr. Yashwanth helped me a lot.

1758
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:56,687
First I tried to find out how his
son, Atul, was involved in this.

1759
02:01:56,812 --> 02:01:59,312
Atul was dead, but the
doctor had his phone.

1760
02:01:59,687 --> 02:02:02,270
We found many pictures
in the 'Deleted' folder.

1761
02:02:02,562 --> 02:02:06,103
We searched Leela's house. We found
the same pictures in an album.

1762
02:02:06,145 --> 02:02:07,812
I knew there was a connection.

1763
02:02:07,895 --> 02:02:11,437
I found out she is the sister
of Leela's mother Kalpana.

1764
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:13,353
Her name is Anamika.

1765
02:02:13,437 --> 02:02:15,603
It took me a year to find her.

1766
02:02:15,728 --> 02:02:16,562
Just last week...

1767
02:02:16,603 --> 02:02:19,853
You must already know, she
was kept at a mental asylum.

1768
02:02:20,037 --> 02:02:23,620
She was turned into a patient by one Mr.
Nathuram Dubey.

1769
02:02:23,645 --> 02:02:26,187
I got to know all
this from Anamika.

1770
02:02:26,437 --> 02:02:28,954
She told me the story that took
place twenty four years ago.

1771
02:02:29,062 --> 02:02:31,270
A love story that began at the R.L.S.
Party offices...

1772
02:02:31,603 --> 02:02:34,770
Back then, Nathuram Dubey was a gangster.
A party-worker.

1773
02:02:34,812 --> 02:02:37,103
Anamika was a member
of the same party.

1774
02:02:37,187 --> 02:02:39,228
He wooed her with
talk of his ideology.

1775
02:02:39,353 --> 02:02:41,603
They were together
for exactly a year.

1776
02:02:41,645 --> 02:02:44,145
Then Anamika tells him that
she's pregnant with his child.

1777
02:02:44,187 --> 02:02:47,187
You know, like, the famous Hindi dialogue...
"I'm going to be the mother of your baby"

1778
02:02:47,228 --> 02:02:48,978
Nathuram doesn't want
the baby or the mother.

1779
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:52,228
He asks her to get an abortion,
attempts to kill her.

1780
02:02:53,187 --> 02:02:57,270
Unknown to anyone, she gives birth to a child,
and gives the baby up to her sister - Kalpana.

1781
02:02:57,562 --> 02:02:58,895
That child, is Leela.

1782
02:02:59,937 --> 02:03:02,312
Many years later... Nathuram
is a politician now.

1783
02:03:02,562 --> 02:03:03,187
A leader.

1784
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:04,520
A big shot in the party.

1785
02:03:04,728 --> 02:03:07,812
If they win this election, he
may be the next chief minister.

1786
02:03:08,103 --> 02:03:10,687
When she got to know
this, two years ago...

1787
02:03:10,728 --> 02:03:14,353
Anamika turned up out of the
blue at the party office...

1788
02:03:14,437 --> 02:03:16,145
and tells him he has a daughter.

1789
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:19,395
"You betrayed me! You
tried to kill our child."

1790
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,562
"You're a horrible man. You're
unfit to be a Chief Minister."

1791
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:27,853
"She's your child. She's our child.
Admit it to everyone", she begs him.

1792
02:03:27,978 --> 02:03:29,145
Then she threatens him.

1793
02:03:29,812 --> 02:03:32,395
Anamika's only fault,
was threatening him.

1794
02:03:33,062 --> 02:03:36,395
She forgot that Nathuram was
still the same old Nathuram.

1795
02:03:36,978 --> 02:03:38,978
He found out that Leela
is his daughter.

1796
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:43,270
Twenty days later he tries to kill
her in a setup road accident.

1797
02:03:43,478 --> 02:03:45,728
Then, he tries to kill Anamika.

1798
02:03:45,978 --> 02:03:49,145
But fearing the repercussions
of murdering her...

1799
02:03:49,228 --> 02:03:51,395
he admits her in
a mental asylum.

1800
02:03:52,395 --> 02:03:56,312
When Anamika called Raman, he got to
know that Leela's life is in danger.

1801
02:03:56,395 --> 02:03:59,520
But he never knew that his own life
was in danger at that very minute...

1802
02:03:59,603 --> 02:04:03,145
Shaken, he was on the phone with Leela
when she was at the hospital...

1803
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:06,437
The villain's entry.

1804
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:09,953
Not knowing any of this, not
questioning anything...

1805
02:04:09,978 --> 02:04:14,020
under Nathuram's instructions, these
murders were executed by three people.

1806
02:04:14,187 --> 02:04:16,187
Atul - Dr. Yashwanth's son.

1807
02:04:16,341 --> 02:04:17,424
You - Kamath.

1808
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:18,991
And gangster Hiren.

1809
02:04:19,437 --> 02:04:20,395
From there...

1810
02:04:20,437 --> 02:04:22,562
you became the main villain.

1811
02:04:22,978 --> 02:04:24,603
Everyone else-gone.

1812
02:04:24,926 --> 02:04:26,051
Because of me.

1813
02:04:30,494 --> 02:04:32,203
What you did at the hospital...

1814
02:04:32,321 --> 02:04:33,946
and the doctor's house...

1815
02:04:34,103 --> 02:04:35,770
what happened to us next...

1816
02:04:35,812 --> 02:04:37,603
is all written in my statement.

1817
02:04:37,853 --> 02:04:39,895
I deposed to the commissioner.

1818
02:04:40,187 --> 02:04:41,103
Yesterday.

1819
02:04:41,312 --> 02:04:43,228
It took me all this
time to say it.

1820
02:04:43,687 --> 02:04:44,728
Because...

1821
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:47,103
I needed this uniform.

1822
02:04:48,862 --> 02:04:51,353
Do you know why your
phone is ringing?

1823
02:04:52,645 --> 02:04:54,562
Nathuram Dubey has
been arrested.

1824
02:04:54,645 --> 02:04:55,478
Just now.

1825
02:04:55,687 --> 02:04:57,728
We used his leader to get him.

1826
02:04:57,853 --> 02:05:00,895
When we said we're going to get
him, everyone co-operated.

1827
02:05:00,978 --> 02:05:02,437
No one hesitated.

1828
02:05:02,524 --> 02:05:03,983
He's being brought down here.

1829
02:05:04,228 --> 02:05:05,978
And your story ends here.

1830
02:05:07,228 --> 02:05:10,562
Two of your colleagues will be chargesheeted
today for conspiring with you.

1831
02:05:11,228 --> 02:05:13,228
One of their statements
is included in this.

1832
02:05:13,637 --> 02:05:15,637
He turned approver yesterday.

1833
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:19,853
You are not a smart
police officer.

1834
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:22,895
I knew you don't know who I was.

1835
02:05:23,517 --> 02:05:26,642
I took a leap, and
worked towards this.

1836
02:05:26,868 --> 02:05:30,952
I've been waiting to take me revenge
for two and a half years now.

1837
02:05:31,058 --> 02:05:32,641
I played the patience game.

1838
02:05:32,853 --> 02:05:33,895
I waited.

1839
02:05:34,055 --> 02:05:35,055
I risked it.

1840
02:05:35,312 --> 02:05:36,728
I feared nothing.

1841
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:40,062
Today, I am Deputy Commissioner
of Police- Rajinikanth!

1842
02:05:44,476 --> 02:05:47,851
What do you think of yourselves?
Why have you brought me in?

1843
02:05:47,876 --> 02:05:49,376
Who is this Anamika?

1844
02:05:49,603 --> 02:05:52,520
If this could happen to me, think
what could happen to the common man!

1845
02:05:53,353 --> 02:05:54,728
Give me the phone!
Give it to me.

1846
02:05:55,103 --> 02:05:55,978
Sir...

1847
02:05:56,187 --> 02:05:57,437
This is a police station.

1848
02:05:57,728 --> 02:05:59,395
And this is my station.

1849
02:06:00,437 --> 02:06:03,270
Neither is this your hostel.
Nor is it your house.

1850
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:06,056
There was an arrest warrant
served on you this morning.

1851
02:06:06,165 --> 02:06:09,165
There is proof and evidence that you
were involved in these murders.

1852
02:06:09,332 --> 02:06:11,290
You attempted to kill
your own daughter.

1853
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:13,162
You lawyer is on his way.

1854
02:06:13,187 --> 02:06:15,312
Until then, please be
seated in that room.

1855
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:16,726
And THAT'S AN ORDER!

1856
02:06:16,993 --> 02:06:19,327
What statement? What videotape?

1857
02:06:20,546 --> 02:06:21,546
Take him.

1858
02:06:50,204 --> 02:06:52,787
Either I walk, or I die.

1859
02:06:52,812 --> 02:06:54,312
I'm going crazy!

1860
02:06:54,437 --> 02:06:56,687
I will take ten
policemen down with me!

1861
02:06:57,312 --> 02:06:58,687
Come at me, Hero!

1862
02:07:15,261 --> 02:07:20,636
You little punk! Trying
to mess with me?

1863
02:07:20,785 --> 02:07:23,035
I will walk into your house
and take your mother.

1864
02:07:26,395 --> 02:07:28,437
Forgive me, uncle!
Please forgive me.

1865
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:35,853
Think you can become me just
by putting on that uniform?

1866
02:07:40,017 --> 02:07:42,017
I'm not an ordinary man now!

1867
02:07:50,457 --> 02:07:51,832
I'm somebody else.

1868
02:07:52,937 --> 02:07:54,271
I'm a cop.

1869
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,812
A policeman!

1870
02:08:04,439 --> 02:08:07,856
That day, I couldn't kill a
bad man because he was a cop.

1871
02:08:09,062 --> 02:08:11,770
Today, as a cop, I have
killed that bad man.

1872
02:08:17,008 --> 02:08:19,008
So, we've won.

1873
02:08:19,812 --> 02:08:22,520
I've had my revenge.
It's all over.

1874
02:08:23,978 --> 02:08:26,937
You're okay now.
We are okay now.

1875
02:08:28,891 --> 02:08:31,266
You don't have to
be there anymore.

1876
02:08:31,562 --> 02:08:32,645
Go home.

1877
02:08:33,574 --> 02:08:35,491
I'll ask dad to pick you up.

1878
02:08:36,629 --> 02:08:37,796
I love you.

1879
02:09:32,737 --> 02:09:35,279
It's dark. Looks
like it might rain.

1880
02:09:35,307 --> 02:09:37,140
Shall we get done with the
bike ride for the day?

1881
02:09:37,227 --> 02:09:38,602
We’ll stay over
somewhere nearby.

1882
02:09:38,627 --> 02:09:40,544
Hey Mahesh! One room or two?

1883
02:09:42,744 --> 02:09:46,181
Speaking of Mahesh...
I wish he were here.

1884
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:47,177
Yeah.

1885
02:09:48,412 --> 02:09:49,329
Move.

1886
02:09:49,354 --> 02:09:50,771
What are you going to do?

1887
02:09:52,826 --> 02:09:54,243
You're acting weird!

1888
02:09:54,502 --> 02:09:56,461
Didn't I feed you enough?

1889
02:09:56,498 --> 02:09:57,415
Wow!

1890
02:09:58,979 --> 02:09:59,979
Thank you.

1891
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:02,594
For saving my life.

1892
02:10:03,057 --> 02:10:04,391
Risking your own life!

1893
02:10:04,837 --> 02:10:06,462
That too without a
second thought.

1894
02:10:07,289 --> 02:10:09,205
I am not sure if I thanked you.

1895
02:10:10,935 --> 02:10:13,643
You are my everything
You are my hero too.

1896
02:10:14,223 --> 02:10:15,806
Your name is so right.

1897
02:10:16,015 --> 02:10:17,515
The timing is right too.

1898
02:10:17,649 --> 02:10:18,649
Look up!

1899
02:10:22,219 --> 02:10:23,510
Be with me.

1900
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:25,860
Till I die.

1901
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:27,303
Marry me.

1902
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:30,010
Will you?

1903
02:10:33,891 --> 02:10:34,807
Yes.

1904
02:10:34,963 --> 02:10:35,880
Of course.

1905
02:10:36,701 --> 02:10:37,618
In a heartbeat.

1906
02:10:37,643 --> 02:10:38,643
Really?

1907
02:10:38,806 --> 02:10:40,348
Just say when and where.

1908
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:41,492
Marry me.

1909
02:10:41,791 --> 02:10:43,125
So, I’m stuck to you now?

1910
02:10:44,177 --> 02:10:45,469
You put this on.

1911
02:10:51,415 --> 02:10:52,915
I love you.

1912
02:10:58,415 --> 02:12:52,915
