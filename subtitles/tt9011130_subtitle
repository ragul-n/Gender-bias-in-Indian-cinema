1
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,008
Friends,

2
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,352
the next one to address you all

3
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:45,079
is the leader of AICP,
Advocate Lakshmanan.

4
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:47,360
Dear friends,

5
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:51,055
I don't need an introduction
while talking to you.

6
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:54,382
Specially, when I am talking
about our land and humans.

7
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,902
Where I stand is my land!

8
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,500
In no place in the world
are there immigrants.

9
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,712
The border made by
corrupt politicians

10
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,445
to usurp others'
land is immigration.

11
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,601
That boundary is not of the land,

12
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,328
but know that it's in your mind.

13
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,429
Do you remember the Nanjankotta?

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,171
We have studied in books,

15
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:16,710
it's the village that's the border
of Kerala and Tamilnadu.

16
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,757
But people in Nanjankotta
never differentiated the two states.

17
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,609
Even then, the Tamil workers
who toiled hard

18
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,351
day and night and lived
in Nanjankotta,

19
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,827
were stamped as immigrants
by the DYP party.

20
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:33,250
The statue of Perumal whom they
worshipped as God, was destroyed.

21
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:36,216
They were homeless, jobless
and their lives were ruined.

22
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,992
They were thrown into
the scrap on the streets

23
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:43,054
and the dirty gutters to rot.

24
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,148
Watching them leave Nanjankotta was

25
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:50,671
an inhuman and wicked landlord,

26
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:53,914
the steerer of DYP, Amarnath.

27
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:59,296
To seize Indira estate and
Perumal street colony,

28
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,062
this goon forgot about
everything else.

29
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:04,923
Amarnath thus became the biggest
criminal Nanjankotta ever saw.

30
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:09,187
To hide his dirty activities
with power,

31
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,757
he made his uncle Vijayanand,
the MP a pawn. Likewise,

32
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:15,476
he is planning to make
his own brother, Appu,

33
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,718
the venomous goon
the next contestant

34
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,070
of DYP in the next election,
in place of Vijayanand.

35
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,374
DYP continues to commit murders

36
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,937
and also manufactures
and trades in local and imported

37
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,015
brands of revolvers and guns
in Nanjankotta.

38
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,312
It is time to think, people.

39
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:40,906
My Tamil friends in the colony,

40
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:44,624
Advocate Lakshmanan will bring
you back to Nanjankotta.

41
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,296
The restriction imposed by DYP
on them

42
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:50,249
will now be ignored.

43
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,414
Our questions and protests

44
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,921
are being suppressed
by Amar using tyranny and fear.

45
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:59,531
If you have the guts to look
into the eyes of that demon,

46
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:05,460
this is my promise that we will
not allow another life to be taken.

47
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,530
Stop this. Not anymore.
This isn't a warning from Lakshmanan

48
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:13,217
but a warning from
Nanjankotta and AICP.

49
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:17,202
I thank my fellows in Nanjankotta.

50
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:21,452
We will have the lamps lit.
- We will have the lamps lit.

51
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,163
Take this as a challenge.
- Take this as a challenge.

52
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,014
We will have the lamps lit.
- We will have the lamps lit.

53
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:29,851
Take this as a challenge.
- Take this as a challenge.

54
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,843
We will have the lamps lit.
- We will have the lamps lit.

55
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,850
Take this as a challenge.
- Take this as a challenge.

56
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:38,944
Sir...

57
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,530
Sir!

58
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,243
Shall we leave?
- Yes.

59
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,930
Aren't you coming to Priya's house?

60
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,860
No, you carry on.

61
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,165
Let us go.

62
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:47,309
Teacher, may I leave?

63
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:56,267
Dear...

64
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:58,705
Aren't you going?

65
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,221
It's Priya's dad
who died while my

66
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,661
dad is the Sub-Inspector
in charge.

67
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,822
If you couldn't do anything,
I have nothing to tell her.

68
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:33,164
Violence and protest...
- Violence and protest...

69
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:36,281
Is not something we do not know.
- Is not something we do not know.

70
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,893
No matter who stabbed
our leader...

71
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,460
- No matter who
stabbed our leader,

72
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,929
he will be burnt down today!
- He will be burnt down today!

73
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:49,804
He will be burnt today!

74
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,710
The condolence meet
of Advocate Lakshmanan

75
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:04,343
was disturbed by us
and Amar knew that well.

76
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,500
That is why, he will never
expect an attack immediately.

77
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,484
If we don't put
this opportunity to use,

78
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,429
I'm sure we won't get another one.

79
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:20,883
Manali, listen.

80
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:23,648
It's after 11 PM every night

81
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,756
that Amar goes back home
from the party office.

82
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,185
He is usually drunk at that time.

83
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,123
After all, he has
a bar in his office.

84
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:30,970
It's been hardly a week,

85
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,486
that his car banged on to a tree
on his way back home.

86
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,861
His leg broke, but he did
get hurt.

87
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,291
So was his car damaged.

88
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:43,432
It was a narrow escape.

89
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:46,463
I mean, that makes your job easier.

90
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,197
He cannot run.

91
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,979
The boys here
0are not capable enough.

92
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,900
That is why, we have
approached you, Manali.

93
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:56,869
Give it...

94
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:00,736
Here...

95
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,470
Amarnath.

96
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,260
No one needs to show me

97
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,627
my prey.

98
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,330
We were so foolish to have
given Manali Sabu a photo.

99
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:21,033
A lion never sees
the photograph of its prey.

100
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:22,885
Suraj...

101
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,652
When party makes a decision,
don't turn your back towards it.

102
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,150
It will do you no good.

103
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,143
Start the car.

104
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,135
Move aside.

105
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:12,408
What happened?

106
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,307
Who did this?

107
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,649
How could one do business
in the presence of the party?

108
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,572
We were only trying
to earn a living.

109
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,531
They broke our shop open
and took away all the money.

110
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,400
Who?
- What wll you do if you know?

111
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,057
A SI can do nothing at all.

112
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,913
You please leave.

113
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,661
Nanjankotta police station,
crime number 177/2025, IPC...

114
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,482
Mr Ummar...

115
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,701
The first...
- Vyshakha!

116
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,740
Couldn't you find someone else
to play with?

117
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,482
You can live in Nanjankotta
if you co-operate with us.

118
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:14,490
It's election time, else
Mr Amar would've come personally.

119
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,692
These are the posters of DYP that
has to be pasted in Nanjankotta.

120
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,943
Either let them do it
or you and your team do it.

121
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:26,857
You may decide who will do it.

122
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,025
But if these posters
are not up before

123
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,928
the lights turn on
in the evening,

124
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,615
you better find a Government
job for your wife.

125
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:37,865
Ummar...

126
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,857
Ummar, you may take them.

127
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,443
Chandra...

128
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,224
You should be here.

129
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,412
To write down the complain
if anybody comes up with one.

130
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,873
Also remember the ones
who come to file a complain.

131
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:08,459
Not a single one of you should
be seen outside this premises.

132
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,365
Even if we see an auto driver
in uniform, we'll thrash you.

133
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:45,657
Give water to dad.

134
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,047
He sits idle at the police station.

135
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:50,680
So, there's no harm if he goes
to the kitchen to drink water.

136
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,704
'He calls himself a policeman.
Why does he need this uniform?'

137
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:03,865
'Mind your business. - Police!
They are all scared.'

138
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:06,875
'My husband wouldn't have died
if the police was brave enough.'

139
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:10,195
'You just have to sit idle here,
you still get your salary.'

140
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,014
'People who had shame
would have left long back.'

141
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:14,641
'He can do nothing, but he
still calls himself the SI.'

142
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:21,305
'The incident shook the state...'

143
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,961
'The SI of Nanjankotta police
station, SI Vyshakhan'

144
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,875
'has committed suicide inside
the lock-up of his police station.'

145
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:32,992
'His body is now being sent
for postmortem...'

146
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,930
'Nanjankotta is in a state of...'

147
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,766
This is the first time in our state
that a Sub-inspector chose to

148
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,250
kill himself in his
own police station.

149
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:48,852
The incident could have happened
around 8PM is what...

150
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,899
How does DYP react
in these circumstances?

151
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,633
DYP's condolences

152
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,591
on the death of SI Vyshakhan.
In these circumstance,

153
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,208
we'll provide his family
with every immediate help.

154
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:19,256
'Another important news.'

155
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:21,090
'The human rights association
interferes.' - Okay.

156
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,443
'Following SI Vyshakhan's death...'

157
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:26,811
'...an inquiry has been initiated.'

158
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:31,131
'Although it was unofficial,
such a drastic step...'

159
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,053
'...was not expected...'
- Here...

160
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,116
'The government could land
in trouble, says the wellwishers.'

161
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,780
'Going back to
the hospital premises...'

162
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,061
Okay, then. - Ma'am, thank you.
- Thank you.

163
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:45,592
I'll leave too. I'll call
Mr Vijayanand. - Okay, bye.

164
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:48,264
'From Nanjankotta General
hospital, '

165
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:50,264
'we'll soon connect with you.'

166
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:53,100
'At present, Vyshakhan's suicide...'

167
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,202
Where were you all this while?

168
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,848
Couldn't you have informed
if you were going to be so late?

169
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,709
It was so crowded
at the hospital.

170
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,075
That rascal Shashank had to
bring me the wreath as well.

171
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,163
Not my fault.
- Shashank!

172
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,913
Amar, let us go.

173
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:09,803
We've to go there with this.
Only after that can we go home.

174
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,413
Appu...
- Yes?

175
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:20,944
Why did he commit suicide?

176
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,358
Who will inquire all that?
Let him die.

177
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,584
Come, dear.

178
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,217
Come to me.

179
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,975
Don't cry. Come on.

180
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,590
I heard you're nominated
to contest in the election next.

181
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:41,374
Will you be a MP some day?

182
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,030
I have no option.

183
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,725
Go and finish your graduation first.

184
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,733
Okay.
- MP!

185
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:01,522
Amar, is Appu more capable
than me to be the MP?

186
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,413
Don't you have anything to say?

187
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,428
Lord Ganapati, Lord Shiva...

188
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:12,452
And there's one more
who has 3-4 heads...

189
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,436
That's what we lack.

190
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:20,553
You need not get down
with your broken leg. I'll go.

191
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:23,397
Do you want me to
take care of this?

192
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,889
You just drive.

193
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,577
Who are you? I didn't recognize you.

194
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,049
Amarnath!

195
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,123
Mr Appu, may I?
- You may leave.

196
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,624
Where were you? It's been a long
time since you left from there.

197
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,834
Don't ask me about it, sir.

198
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,403
On my way, I offered a ride
to someone at the railway station.

199
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:21,874
That is why, I got late.

200
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,100
You dropped someone!

201
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,246
Yes, so what?

202
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,269
Shashank...

203
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:29,534
You had so much of cash with you
and you allowed a stranger in.

204
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:31,300
How responsible is that!

205
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,168
Appu, don't you know the time
of Sadhan express?

206
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,878
I don't know.
- Neither do I.

207
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,003
But he was standing on the road
since that arrived.

208
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:41,237
He tried to stop every vehicle
that passed, but none stopped.

209
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,410
He was such an innocent man.

210
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:45,996
I happened to stop.

211
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,839
Happened to stop!

212
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,526
The cash is safe, Appu.

213
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,355
I hope so. What then?

214
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,058
When we reached the place,
he invited me in. - Who is he?

215
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,293
He is new to this place.

216
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,153
Since the time he
was a child, he had

217
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,909
only seen poverty
till he turned 12.

218
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,187
And many more experiences.

219
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,007
Well...

220
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:06,250
I am not sure if his eyes
became wet

221
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,437
or I felt so, because mine was wet.

222
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,539
I felt very bad for him.

223
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,312
Amidst these problems,
including him,

224
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,821
the Government took responsibility
of educating four people.

225
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,508
I wanted to tell him I had to leave,

226
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,781
by then he reached Mumbai.

227
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,875
All thanks to the Government,

228
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,836
he learned a few languages.

229
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:27,180
Now, he can speak in Tamil,

230
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:30,327
Telugu, Kannada.

231
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,890
What?
- Yes.

232
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,503
Saying that the Government
was taking him for granted,

233
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,148
he had another peg.

234
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:38,961
He said, he was an animal
from inside

235
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,273
and that he has locked

236
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:44,453
the animal deep down
with a key of law.

237
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,648
He then sat like this for a while.

238
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:48,609
Five minutes passed.

239
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,271
Suddenly, he asked me a question!

240
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,906
'Should I take the key of law'

241
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,655
'and unleash the animal
within me, Shashank?'

242
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:55,719
Stop it now.

243
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58,601
I told him there was no harm in
trying. What else could I have said?

244
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,336
Appu, will you please
give me a drink?

245
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:03,765
Here...

246
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,437
No, leave.

247
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:10,687
Go.

248
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:12,734
Okay, see you tomorrow.

249
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:20,913
Biju police, get me a tea.

250
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,430
Hey...

251
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,172
Do you have fire?

252
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,077
I don't have it.
- What is this?

253
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,672
Walk faster!

254
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:37,023
Where were you?

255
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:38,976
Do you have fire?

256
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:42,594
Why don't you go at least now?

257
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,695
What did you say?

258
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,195
The situation at home is
not so good, sir.

259
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,601
That's a different story.

260
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,359
After Vyshakhan died...

261
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,945
I mean, Mr Vyshakhan died here.

262
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,750
There should be someone
to look after the work here.

263
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,258
Abdul, listen...

264
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:57,898
Give me fire...

265
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,882
Abdul... Hey...

266
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,321
Fire.

267
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:10,541
Walk faster, son.

268
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:17,424
This is nice.

269
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,807
We thought that you finally
gave up on him, Ms Lalitha.

270
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,847
How can I give up?

271
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,308
What will I think when he leaves
home wearing the uniform?

272
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,394
That he'd come straight here.
But what happened?

273
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,300
He was loitering around
with some school boys.

274
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:34,559
He has been cheating me
for so many days.

275
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,324
When he was sure I'd catch him,

276
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:38,645
he took me to Pazhani
saying he had to worship there.

277
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,209
And then to Tirupati.

278
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:44,194
It is only when he was talking to
his friend that I got the news.

279
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:47,729
Had he not resumed duty in two
days, he would've lost his job.

280
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:49,408
That's right.
- What is so right?

281
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,222
Had he not come,
he would have lost his job.

282
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,886
We can't even have
a tea peacefully inside.

283
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,620
Couldn't you inform me
if he did not come for work?

284
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,011
He isn't a child...
- But, no...

285
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:10,714
He'll never reform.

286
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,667
What about the money?

287
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,722
What could I do?
- Pradeep...

288
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,694
Do you have fire?

289
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:49,750
The most peaceful place
here in Nanjankotta

290
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,750
is this police station.

291
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,858
Really?
- We come and go.

292
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,819
That's all.
- How sad!

293
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,030
The word 'friendly'...

294
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,163
We don't need it anymore.

295
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:25,694
I didn't like it.

296
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,459
Police station!

297
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:30,749
That's enough.

298
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,341
I am not here to wipe off
the tears of people in Nanjankotta.

299
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,373
But I will break the head of
those make the people cry.

300
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:24,154
I'll be here for some days.

301
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,404
As long as I am here, this
will function as a police station

302
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:30,755
and all of you will be cops.

303
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,029
Isn't that how it is?

304
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,404
It has to be so.

305
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:41,263
Who is what, here?

306
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,903
I'm Head Constable, Abdulla.

307
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:45,013
Age 45. I have a wife and daughter.

308
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,060
Sir, I'm Kuttan Pillai, ASI.
I'll retire in this year.

309
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,177
Sir, I'm Govindan.

310
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,850
He is my child, a great scientist.

311
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:56,170
By the grace of God, whatever
he discovers explodes.

312
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,795
Sir, I'm the driver, Biju.
Age 35.

313
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:00,559
I stay in the quarters
with my family.

314
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,600
Sir, I'm writer Sundaran,
age 35.

315
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:03,889
Wife and two children.

316
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,834
Biju, how is the speed of our jeep?

317
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,951
I drive very carefully
following the signals, sir.

318
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:11,904
You just have to follow the signals
given by me from now.

319
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,955
Okay, sir.

320
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:38,089
People who believe in democracy,

321
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,292
here's a good news for you.

322
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:44,065
From now, you can sleep
peacefully in your house,

323
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,128
without having to fear anything.

324
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:49,417
Our village has
found its new savior.

325
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:55,776
Biju...

326
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,969
Put the last possible gear.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,649
I got this job through sports quota.

328
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:41,361
I always run at sharp
4:00 AM every day.

329
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:47,494
Listen carefully to
what I announce next.

330
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:50,806
Complain boxes installed
across the village

331
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:52,697
be not used to dispose
chewing gums

332
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,938
and instead be used for valid

333
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:57,025
reasons, is my special request.

334
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:59,213
It's an order!

335
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,778
Another important announcement is...

336
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:03,377
Sundara, that's enough.

337
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,556
Sir, he threw up.

338
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,119
I didn't find the chain.
Should I continue to hit him?

339
00:27:58,494 --> 00:27:59,494
No, Kutta.

340
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,942
Let's roll him!

341
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:28,401
This is Perumal street.

342
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,917
This is where
most of the Tamilians lived.

343
00:28:31,394 --> 00:28:34,980
Now, this is where Appu
practices his shooting skills.

344
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,730
No one will ever come
to Nanjankotta.

345
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:41,206
If this continues,
only goons will live here.

346
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,823
Common people won't stay here.

347
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:59,995
When they're stuffing something,
sitting right under our nose,

348
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,448
our ears still don't hear anything.

349
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:06,206
As they poke into our eyes
and find pleasure in it,

350
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:08,394
our tongues don't revolt.

351
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,503
When they draw pictures
on our soil with our own blood,

352
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,776
we still don't raise our hands.

353
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,880
My dear savior,
who has landed in

354
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,808
Nanjankotta without
informing anyone,

355
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,261
please shower your grace upon us.

356
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:25,159
Are there no men in your village,
Mr Rajappan?

357
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,659
Men, in this village?

358
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,144
Jeez!

359
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,253
Let me go down.

360
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,261
It cannot even be washed away.

361
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:48,722
Hello.

362
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:52,393
Where are you off to?

363
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,151
Hey...

364
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:14,589
Appu...

365
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:17,081
He is our new SI.

366
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,894
I'm really very tired.
Let me lie down for a while.

367
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:50,886
Hey, take him to a hospital.

368
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,878
What are you thinking, sir?

369
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,206
A village where there was
a local gun manufacturing unit.

370
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,597
And then bloodshed
all across the place.

371
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:24,573
This reminded me of my childhood.

372
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,605
I don't like to remember all that.

373
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,980
The ones who remind us
things we don't like to remember,

374
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,550
don't we get furious at them?

375
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:36,206
Of course, we do.

376
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:37,917
That's the reason,

377
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,300
you better stop trading
in guns from Nanjankotta.

378
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,792
Sir, guns are as easily available

379
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,627
in Nanjankotta as chocolates.
That's what people here spread.

380
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:49,687
But I give it to only those
who really need it.

381
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,912
It isn't something we can give
to anyone and everyone.

382
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,252
I think someone has fooled you.

383
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,275
Appu, will you stop it
by yourself or should I...

384
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:10,956
9 mm quality, Italian version.

385
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,019
Light weight, metallic finish.

386
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,495
I don't have to tell you
about its magazine capacity.

387
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:18,299
This is the latest model
available in the market today.

388
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,995
Shoot, sir.

389
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,433
If you like it,
I shall gift it to you.

390
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:25,207
If you make me come here again,

391
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:28,207
I will shoot!

392
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:52,449
Appu, how many of you
were there when he came?

393
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,074
Do you even know anything?

394
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,879
It's not that I cannot go
to the police station

395
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:01,243
and knock him down.

396
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:02,539
But there he is.

397
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:07,165
He has told us to mellow down
as the election is approaching.

398
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,079
So then go and tell him,

399
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,993
not to play with his boys
in my courtyard.

400
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,478
He can do that in some ground
where people relieve themselves.

401
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:23,439
My nephews are really impossible.

402
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,361
Certain things are meant to be
hidden when required.

403
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,064
That's the norm.

404
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,258
Oh!

405
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,447
Norm, is it?

406
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:36,103
DYP did not even have
a flag to hoist in its name.

407
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,005
Hope you haven't forgotten
those days.

408
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,111
Have you?

409
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,993
As you reached from that poor
condition to where you are now,

410
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,814
even your illegitimate relationship

411
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,040
is a part of whatever illegal
activities you have hidden.

412
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:54,782
Doctor, stop checking his BP
and go, check on your...

413
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,806
I haven't answered
your brother back.

414
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,228
But the one sitting here is my dad.

415
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,579
You better explain that to him!

416
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:14,837
Oh, I missed it.

417
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:18,876
Didn't you see the power of
my ice-cream bomb?

418
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,759
So, won't the capacity
of a gas cylinder be much more?

419
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:25,548
Just one cyclinder is enough
to blow up a bungalow.

420
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,923
Sir, don't you have a gas
cylinder in your quarters?

421
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:32,954
Suraj? Okay, I'll inform.

422
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:35,759
There's a penalty,
so keep that aside as fine.

423
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:37,720
Sir, Sundaran just called.

424
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,454
On his way back, he saw DYP
and AICP workers fighting.

425
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:44,001
I expect him to have got
beaten up too.

426
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:46,071
He is asking if you could
go there, sir?

427
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,150
Sir, the one being
beaten up is Suraj.

428
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,469
Some people who were expelled
long back came to meet

429
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,391
him yesterday. That's
why, they're hitting him.

430
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:10,126
Suraj was planning something, sir.

431
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:12,137
They're venting out
their frustration on them.

432
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,915
I tried to separate them.

433
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,150
Dear believers of democracy,

434
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:25,072
when two goons attack
a helpless and unarmed young man,

435
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,938
villagers and other young men
watch as mute spectators, but...

436
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:30,736
A police officer

437
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,204
cannot sit idle and watch
that, dear friends.

438
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:36,657
I request my hooligan friends
to stop hitting.

439
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,103
For your good! - Stop showing
off and leave from here.

440
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,548
You may have come from anywhere.

441
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:45,806
But you will live only
till I finish him off.

442
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,080
Dear villagers,

443
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,158
this is nothing else

444
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:12,744
but for safety purpose and not
give these kids a trauma forever,

445
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,908
a small precaution.

446
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,697
Hooligan friends, your time is up.

447
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:22,119
Now, you may come forward.

448
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:48,562
There's no strength
in this fat body, kid.

449
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,656
When you come to challenge me,

450
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,094
you should be iron-hearted.

451
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:55,859
But unfortunately,
you're born to your father

452
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:57,961
and not mine to have that.

453
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:46,117
Arrest Ummar.

454
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:47,781
Will you arrest Ummar?

455
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,430
Rassak should be hanged.

456
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,945
When will Rassak be hung?

457
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:56,117
Hang Biju.
- Will you hang Kalari Udayan?

458
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:57,422
Hang Ummar.

459
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:59,039
This also says, 'hang Ummar'.

460
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,727
Ummar... Sir, there are so many.

461
00:38:02,102 --> 00:38:04,011
We've seen these
antics, but does the

462
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,898
SI has the guts to
arrest Amarnath?

463
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:10,123
Read the name of the one
who wrote that.

464
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,828
Not a single complainant
has mentioned his name.

465
00:38:15,274 --> 00:38:17,938
I want the complete history
of those who need to be hung.

466
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,781
We don't have it, sir.

467
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,852
Sir, that doctor has been
waiting since a long time.

468
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,829
She needs to go for
her child's vaccination.

469
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,977
Sir, it will be good
if you could meet her.

470
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:36,719
Ohh!

471
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:38,852
Okay.

472
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:42,726
About sir...

473
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,289
I'll inquire...
- Sir!

474
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:51,250
My name is Sangeeta.
Dr Sangeeta.

475
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:52,867
I'm Hyderabad based,

476
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:54,563
and Amar's cousin.

477
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:58,070
Since Amar could not come, he
sent me to give you a message.

478
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,640
Madam, none of us are noticing.
You may tell him whatever you want.

479
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,922
You made a mistake
by coming to Nanjankotta.

480
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:10,766
And your game with the boys

481
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,391
who haven't learnt the game yet,

482
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,594
keep it in some ground where
people go to relieve themselves.

483
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:18,797
And not in Amar's courtyard.

484
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:21,789
So then keep this in mind.

485
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:23,523
I'll see you then.

486
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:33,961
MP Vijayanand's only daughter.

487
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:37,645
I don't know if she studied
or not, but became a doctor.

488
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,992
She was with a man by the name
Bijoy, while in Hyderabad.

489
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,673
I don't know if she got married
or not, but she got a child.

490
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,047
That's when Bijoy
met with an accident.

491
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:58,461
Doctors gave up on him.

492
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,906
But Bijoy did not have to
rot for too many days.

493
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,023
Amarnath who was quite
used to killing people,

494
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,345
went to Hyderabad
and put an end to his life as well.

495
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:19,038
And he brought the pregnant
Sangeeta back home.

496
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:28,231
The financiers who thought
Advocate Lakshmanan

497
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,437
was to contest, are not
answering our calls now.

498
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:33,726
You know what happened
when we tried to show our strength.

499
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,999
That's exactly what
happened to Manali.

500
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:37,366
Give that to me.

501
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:40,976
If we don't find a contestant
whom people would trust,

502
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,374
it's better that AICP
withdraws before the election.

503
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:49,554
Well...

504
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,796
I suggest that no one thinks,

505
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,702
fighting in public
is the right qualification

506
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:57,421
to represent the party.

507
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:05,468
Do couple of people
as your fans and

508
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:06,830
few sticks what
you call a party?

509
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,452
Five years back,

510
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,921
we had the trust of our people
which was also our strength.

511
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,878
Can our party chase away Amarnath
who is here to buy everything?

512
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,194
DYP, that stood nowhere
has made its place.

513
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:20,866
To come forward,

514
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,748
they expelled thousands
of workers and their

515
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:24,319
families who worked
in Indira estate.

516
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:25,858
But...

517
00:41:25,976 --> 00:41:29,046
Not a single leader of AICP
was expelled.

518
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:31,780
Not just that,

519
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:35,163
not even a drop of blood did we
shed for those who had to leave.

520
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:36,908
Had we done that, a
great party would

521
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:38,194
not have been as lonely as you.

522
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:41,147
I won't wait

523
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:42,983
till the elections.

524
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:44,827
I'm leaving.

525
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:01,134
I have a question.

526
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:03,501
At present, is the situation

527
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:06,704
in Nanjankotta favorable or not?

528
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,283
Paper mill, Indira Estate...

529
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,853
Everything is coming.

530
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:12,509
All of them are corporates.

531
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,177
We were told that
after expelling the

532
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:15,736
Tamilians, we'll rule there.
What now?

533
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,786
I'll get back to you.

534
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:21,957
The MP of Nanjankotta,
Mr Vijayanand is on the line.

535
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:24,419
Hello, Mr Vijayanandan.
Can you hear me?

536
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,544
'Okay, I can hear you Venu.
Go ahead.'

537
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,731
The election is round the corner.

538
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:32,403
The candidate nomination
is going on in full form.

539
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:34,747
Even in these conditions,

540
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,083
is DYP continuing
to terrorize people?

541
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:39,700
Some people were expelled
years ago.

542
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:42,302
Some people are still living
in Nanjankotta

543
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:44,934
but in the fear of goons,
having sleepless nights.

544
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,770
'Venu, you need to
change your question.'

545
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:50,888
'There are no goons in DYP,
we only have party workers.'

546
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:53,136
How can their activities
be called as goondaism?

547
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:55,270
Please don't be
mistaken that you can

548
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,184
get away calling
them as workers.

549
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:01,684
I have all the crime records
of Nanjankotta.

550
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,927
If you are interested in knowing

551
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:07,629
who in DYP was involved
in which incident or crime,

552
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,794
I shall hand it
to the concerned people.

553
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:11,106
Then you will know...

554
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,599
Hello...

555
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,169
Hello. Mr Vijayanandan,
are you listening?

556
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:17,622
Hello...

557
00:43:17,864 --> 00:43:19,731
Due to some technical problems...

558
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:21,888
Did I have an option?

559
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,773
Did you think that
the election was

560
00:43:23,813 --> 00:43:25,331
round the corner while
doing all that?

561
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,919
Don't blame me for
someone else's mistake.

562
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:32,927
When these people tried
to flatter you,

563
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,333
you enjoyed it, didn't you?
You should have thought back then.

564
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:38,747
What should I do then?
You tell me.

565
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,458
What if I tell you?

566
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:43,872
I will do that.

567
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:45,473
I definitely will!

568
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:51,051
'DYP's scam behind
the auction of...'

569
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,544
'Is coming to light.'

570
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,408
Ummar, come to the police station
on Monday. SI wants to see you.

571
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,704
Are you the same old Abdulla?

572
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:47,775
Well, your speech and looks
have changed.

573
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,056
Stop joking, Ummar.

574
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:53,103
Come to the station on Monday
morning, for your own good.

575
00:44:54,532 --> 00:44:55,696
I'll be there.

576
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:58,666
It's been some time since I saw
the place where Vyshakhan died.

577
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,071
I'll be there.

578
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:03,267
Is everyone in your family
doing fine?- Biju...

579
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,285
You know something, sir?

580
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:13,231
My wish was to become an Engineer.

581
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,129
But my dad...

582
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,183
He wanted to make me a cop,
like he was.

583
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:22,299
No!

584
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:25,051
What are you up to? We'll burst!
There's a gas cylinder here.

585
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,159
Here.

586
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:32,620
So then I joined for BTech.

587
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:36,691
As soon as dad got to know of
this, he died of a heart attack.

588
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:42,363
And then I was appointed
in police after my dad.

589
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:43,760
That's it.

590
00:45:54,477 --> 00:45:57,187
Is the smell from
the gas cylinder or...

591
00:45:57,461 --> 00:45:58,461
Sir...

592
00:45:58,758 --> 00:45:59,758
Sir...

593
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:02,039
Sir, the regulator is not working.

594
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,342
We'll buy a new one.
- Be seated.

595
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,328
Biju, buy him a new regulator.

596
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:06,602
Okay.

597
00:46:07,118 --> 00:46:10,070
No, sir. We have only ten
seconds to save our lives.

598
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,102
Now, it's only nine. Run!

599
00:46:13,328 --> 00:46:14,828
Biju...
- Govinda!

600
00:46:15,117 --> 00:46:17,672
Run!

601
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,157
A house for rent,
just opposite the girls' hostel.

602
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:51,726
Wow! Sir, the house just opposite
the girls' hostel is for lease.

603
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:58,993
The house opposite the girls'
hostel that was locked since ages...

604
00:47:02,414 --> 00:47:03,852
Ummar is here, sir.

605
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:06,734
Sir...

606
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:12,109
Well, I heard that your quarters
was burnt down.

607
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:21,578
Didn't I ask you to come tomorrow?

608
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:24,696
No, sir. I don't like
to delay anything.

609
00:47:30,032 --> 00:47:31,047
Neither do I.

610
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:40,438
If you co-operate,

611
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,368
you can survive here.

612
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:56,747
No one has ever behaved

613
00:47:57,271 --> 00:47:58,583
like this with me.

614
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:00,380
Ummar, come.

615
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:04,106
I should not see you with
any of the leaders henceforth.

616
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:07,958
Similarly, no leader should see me
to recommend you.

617
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:11,646
If anything out of the two options
happen, you will have to suffer.

618
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:15,457
Ummar...

619
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:18,044
Let me know if there's
a good house for me.

620
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:19,356
Start the car.

621
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:38,618
Are you getting a proper sleep
and liking the food here? - Yes.

622
00:48:40,263 --> 00:48:42,700
Govindan is very lazy to
go to the police station.

623
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:44,341
I asked him one day,

624
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:48,208
'Govinda, why do you go to work
every day without fail, these days?'

625
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:50,669
Do you know what his reply was?

626
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:52,638
All thanks to you, sir.

627
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,404
Now that you are
staying with us here,

628
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:57,989
will he again stop going there?

629
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,380
No...

630
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,880
Stop there. Did you take a bath?

631
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:11,942
Yes, I did, dear aunt.

632
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,528
Sir, things are not
as simple as it seemed.

633
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:17,060
The goons and leaders whom you
had summoned are all there.

634
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:19,560
I sense that they are up to
creating some havoc.

635
00:49:19,911 --> 00:49:22,005
If we get late, things
could get worse. Let us go.

636
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:09,746
Kuttan, get me a tea.

637
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:11,693
Sundaran, get a tea please.

638
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,277
Kuttan, are you not feeling well?

639
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,941
No, sir. I don't want to miss
the scene ahead.

640
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:19,117
There won't be
any fight today, Kutta.

641
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:20,973
Only talks.

642
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:23,035
You may go.
- Okay, sir.

643
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:29,792
One standing behind Appu...

644
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:31,684
That tall fellow,
who is he?

645
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,277
The one with a plaited hair?
- Yes.

646
00:50:34,473 --> 00:50:35,629
He is Rassak.

647
00:50:35,894 --> 00:50:38,402
He hails from Bangalore.
He can do anything for Appu.

648
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,896
How many of you have been
with him for ten years?

649
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:50,287
Five years?

650
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:54,037
One year?

651
00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:56,294
Me...

652
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,588
One who just hid behind,
come out.

653
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,339
Since how many years
have you been with him?

654
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:16,627
Twelve years.

655
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,567
Why didn't you speak up
all this while, then?

656
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:22,151
Sir...

657
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:24,975
Sorry, Kutta.

658
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,651
Appu, didn't you notice him?

659
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:49,822
It's not because Appu
did not notice him.

660
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:53,290
It is not you who made him
stand with your people.

661
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,228
It was Appu who did that.

662
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:02,190
Having a gang of people
is of no use.

663
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,338
You should also have some brains.

664
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,432
Now that you know
you're a dumbwit,

665
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:09,869
don't irritate me any further.

666
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:19,127
Who is the younger brother
of Jaison, one killed at the circle?

667
00:52:20,252 --> 00:52:21,385
That's me, sir.

668
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,844
What about the elder brother of
Rejy, who was killed at the market?

669
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:24,924
That's me...

670
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,815
The list is long.

671
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:30,658
People who killed the ones
in your gang,

672
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:31,862
are standing here.

673
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:34,862
And those who killed your people,

674
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:36,431
are on that side.

675
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,560
All of you will kill each other
and die for no reason.

676
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:43,298
While in their
families, every child

677
00:52:43,338 --> 00:52:44,948
born will grow up
to be ministers.

678
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:48,601
What about your kids?

679
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:55,916
I should not see

680
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,809
any of you outside your house.
Not even

681
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:59,251
to give a polio
dose to your child.

682
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,142
And you...

683
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:13,557
If I see him in Nanjankotta again,

684
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:15,838
your back bone will be broken.

685
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:27,416
Check now.

686
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,471
Look...

687
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:31,127
Is it fine now.

688
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:34,034
In that case, you adjust it.

689
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,463
Don't act smart as always.

690
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:39,151
What? How dare you
say that to me!

691
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,768
When did Ummar ask you
to come here?

692
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:43,037
But you took your own sweet
time and came in this late.

693
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:45,877
People like me have so many
errands to run before I come.

694
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:47,674
Do you have a problem?

695
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,622
You shouldn't have come for work
in that case.

696
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:52,189
You...

697
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:53,976
I started this work
even before you did.

698
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,385
If you say a word more,
I will turn you deaf.

699
00:53:57,236 --> 00:54:00,190
You... - Don't abuse me!
There are women in this house.

700
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,135
What will you do if I abuse you?

701
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,854
What?
- What will you do?

702
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:05,267
You...
- Stop it!

703
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,721
Sir, is that you?

704
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:25,854
Sir is here.

705
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:28,557
Ummar.

706
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,642
I won't have to beg for
other officers' mercy.

707
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:33,393
Here.

708
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:36,354
Study well, dear. Okay?

709
00:54:37,862 --> 00:54:39,424
Dad...

710
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:42,713
Mr Abdulla...

711
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:46,877
Come, sir. Have a seat.

712
00:54:48,909 --> 00:54:51,573
I was teaching some tricks
to your daughter.

713
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:53,573
She is very smart.

714
00:54:56,689 --> 00:54:57,783
You please sit, sir.

715
00:54:58,346 --> 00:54:59,838
Come...

716
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,955
Mr Abdulla, this is how
an ideal SI should be.

717
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:09,573
He really scared me.
I am worried only about you.

718
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:11,135
He'll leave in some days.

719
00:55:11,557 --> 00:55:14,627
We belong to the same village
and will keep needing each other.

720
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:18,815
Anyway...

721
00:55:19,244 --> 00:55:21,682
Abdulla, you must speak to
your SI on my behalf.

722
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:24,526
You know me quite well.

723
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,573
We live in the same village

724
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:31,268
and so, we must help each
other and co-operate, right?

725
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:33,151
Hey, there she is.

726
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,069
Why did you take the trouble?

727
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:44,713
The tea is tasty.

728
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:52,190
Like I came here, I shall also
visit Biju, Pillai,

729
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:55,526
and Govindan's houses too.

730
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:59,307
After all, I can share my
woes only with you people.

731
00:56:09,674 --> 00:56:10,744
Shall I leave then?

732
00:56:15,963 --> 00:56:17,174
Come, let's go.

733
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:41,354
Govinda...

734
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:43,518
Govinda!

735
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:47,018
Ring the door bell, sir.

736
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:02,518
Get off that step!

737
00:57:04,315 --> 00:57:07,393
Don't look over there
Govindan's trick is on the steps.

738
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:10,737
Okay, go and tell him
that Ummar is here.

739
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:13,186
I see, so you're Ummar?
- Yes.

740
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:15,046
You're here at mid-night.

741
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,578
Do you even care that your
family is alone at home?

742
00:57:17,773 --> 00:57:19,632
Poor boy Govindan
and his senior.

743
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:21,992
They must be giving your
wife company.

744
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,171
Go home as soon as possible.

745
00:57:24,703 --> 00:57:25,874
Please go.

746
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:27,179
Hey...

747
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:29,327
Start the car.

748
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,663
Abdulla, stop.

749
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:45,577
Chanceless! It's yummy.

750
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:59,569
Where's my egg bulls eye?
- Kuttan ate it.

751
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:01,850
I asked for it.
- Give me the TV remote.

752
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:03,623
Give it here.
- I want to watch the match.

753
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,866
Give it here.

754
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:06,460
Don't...

755
00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:11,124
So, you never cry?
- No.

756
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:13,326
Not in any situation?
- No.

757
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,225
He still educated you?
- He also gave me a job.

758
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:18,733
Ummar...
- Hey.

759
00:58:21,718 --> 00:58:22,952
Come, sit.
- You're back.

760
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,632
Rasiya, get some juice
or tea for Ummar.

761
00:58:25,725 --> 00:58:28,075
Allah! I got so engrossed
in your story, I completely forgot.

762
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:29,163
I'll get it right away.

763
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:31,022
Ummar, come, be seated.

764
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:32,749
Sit, Ummar.

765
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:40,889
Rasiya was asking me
about Nanjankotta.

766
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:43,754
How does any place matter to me?

767
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:47,725
Every place is the same for people
who have no family.

768
00:58:54,054 --> 00:58:55,694
But Ummar and Rasiya,
you must be careful.

769
00:58:55,905 --> 00:58:58,811
What if your own goons go out
and talk about this?

770
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,818
So...

771
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:09,843
If you have anything
to ask me or tell me,

772
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:11,749
do it straight.

773
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:18,079
You rather not enter the houses
where women are alone

774
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,850
and kill time. Isn't that bad?

775
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,521
Yes, it is.

776
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,435
It's too sweet.
- Is it?

777
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:35,199
But that's okay.

778
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:44,481
Abdulla...

779
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,162
But this will spread like wild fire.

780
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:52,998
"Like a new rain, it will..."

781
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,966
"Like honey, I shall..."

782
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:45,417
Sir...

783
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:49,652
Hey,

784
01:00:50,098 --> 01:00:51,637
did you quit
the field of hooliganism?

785
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:54,692
That wasn't a field, sir.

786
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,160
That gave me a great feel.

787
01:01:03,215 --> 01:01:05,754
BSJD, DYP collaboration
will soon be a reality

788
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:08,348
and that's clear immediately
after their first meeting.

789
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:11,851
By joining hands with
BSJD that's already

790
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,320
strong in Karnataka
and Telangana.

791
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,621
DYP has just grown enoromously.

792
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:20,231
Swami, DYP's political advisor
who won this support in auction,

793
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:23,160
MP Vijayanandan, Amarnath,
Dr Sangeeta,

794
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:25,465
Erkali leader Ranganatha Gowda,

795
01:01:25,653 --> 01:01:29,043
all of these met in Telangana,
BSJD office.

796
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:06,766
There's nothing to understand.

797
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,281
Red carpet was spread by
Rajya Sabha.

798
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:11,133
Green carpet by Lok Sabha.

799
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:13,320
What about the ministry?

800
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:16,297
It's a fanatical defibrillation.

801
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,244
A different game altogether,
there in Delhi.

802
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:24,293
He is so knowledgeable.

803
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:33,996
Swami...

804
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:35,730
I know you are busy.

805
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,940
But I...

806
01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:56,269
Who are the cops?

807
01:02:56,933 --> 01:03:00,464
Even before they saw the police
station first, you ruled the place.

808
01:03:01,097 --> 01:03:04,542
Should I teach you how to
control the police men?

809
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:06,347
No, sir.

810
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,652
They are not the same old cops.

811
01:03:11,863 --> 01:03:12,894
Ummar...

812
01:03:13,363 --> 01:03:16,527
I don't have time to listen to
your petty complains.

813
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,879
Do as you like.

814
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:22,324
But till the election is over,
hide in some dirty place.

815
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,488
Right now, eat something
and just leave.

816
01:04:00,468 --> 01:04:02,554
Sir, we'll see the doctor
and be back.

817
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:54,552
Sir, they're taking Abdulla
for a surgery.

818
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:58,028
His right leg
will have to be amputated.

819
01:05:03,724 --> 01:05:05,810
What about Sundaran?
- He is in the ward.

820
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:38,779
It was Ummar, sir.

821
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:41,248
On our way back home.

822
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,631
His clear target was Abdulla.

823
01:05:44,396 --> 01:05:46,068
I couldn't do much.

824
01:06:16,256 --> 01:06:19,115
Sir, Govindan has gone to
buy the stuff.

825
01:06:19,857 --> 01:06:22,162
I don't care who went,
I want it on time.

826
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:43,067
I see less number of people.

827
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,131
What brings you here?

828
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:48,692
My back was itching.

829
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,506
Doctor said that I just
need to ---- someone.

830
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,381
No one has ever become
great after coming to Nanjankotta.

831
01:06:57,505 --> 01:06:58,849
If anyone does,

832
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,177
he will not be able to
leave Nanjankotta.

833
01:07:02,928 --> 01:07:05,287
If you really think
that I have become great,

834
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,990
that means, this is no more
the old Nanjankotta.

835
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:08,037
Ummar!

836
01:08:10,584 --> 01:08:11,630
Ummar!

837
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:02,855
The cops here were like dogs that
did not bark even inside a cage.

838
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,198
You came to my house
with them.

839
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,042
You don't know,
dogs are restricted in our area.

840
01:09:13,722 --> 01:09:15,066
Vela,

841
01:09:15,503 --> 01:09:16,745
finish him off.

842
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:27,280
Kill that rascal and bury him!

843
01:13:07,764 --> 01:13:09,054
Sir...

844
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:26,928
Biju...

845
01:13:30,304 --> 01:13:32,733
Sir, I've brought the stuff.

846
01:13:33,554 --> 01:13:34,757
What next?

847
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:42,350
Ummar's right leg!

848
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:46,007
I want him to be in front,
when Abdulla opens his eyes.

849
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:47,490
Sir.

850
01:14:35,632 --> 01:14:38,428
Sir, we will have to pay
rent for this anyway.

851
01:14:39,132 --> 01:14:40,773
Or if we want to wipe
off the evidence, it

852
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,572
will have to be thrown
in some pond or lake.

853
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,326
So then why not...

854
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:47,326
Take the other leg as well?

855
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,226
Nanjankotta won't be
the same old place

856
01:15:02,266 --> 01:15:03,550
unless the ones expelled return.

857
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:06,054
Nanjankotta will look like
the slum where they dwell now.

858
01:15:06,538 --> 01:15:09,155
Amarnath and DYP won't need
too long to achieve that.

859
01:15:09,616 --> 01:15:12,320
People in the oppositions
do hold a grudge against each other.

860
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:15,504
But if you come to me
in the name of the

861
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,171
slum dwellers, to
seek your revenge,

862
01:15:18,366 --> 01:15:19,624
I won't budge.

863
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,827
When these people were expelled,

864
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:25,968
Nanjankotta people watched
everything as a mute spectator.

865
01:15:27,585 --> 01:15:29,976
I will be beating them up first.

866
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:31,825
Sir, this has got nothing
to do with the party.

867
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,476
I have quit the party.

868
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:35,876
People in Nanjankotta
understand what's good and bad.

869
01:15:36,014 --> 01:15:37,921
People who are with
me are common people

870
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:39,576
and not from any
political party.

871
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:42,530
Everyone wishes to see them back.

872
01:15:43,022 --> 01:15:44,960
I will be here to
raise a voice for them.

873
01:15:45,163 --> 01:15:46,983
But we need you to raise a hand.

874
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:48,577
Your time won't be wasted, sir.

875
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:50,819
They're living at a very
close distance from us.

876
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,499
Sir, please come to the slum
and see them.

877
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,467
Didn't I give you an ear?

878
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:27,678
Now, you listen carefully
to what I have to say.

879
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,067
Many people in Nanjankotta
have surrendered once again.

880
01:16:30,147 --> 01:16:32,905
The grants and rights

881
01:16:33,014 --> 01:16:35,163
that you think you have lost,
is all still back there.

882
01:16:35,374 --> 01:16:37,334
You aren't orphans
without a native place or home.

883
01:16:37,585 --> 01:16:39,751
Your colony and Indira
Estate, everything

884
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:41,420
is still there in Nanjankotta.

885
01:16:42,335 --> 01:16:44,717
Required funds to start
a new life

886
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:46,960
won't be an obstacle for you.

887
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:50,038
Like Shashankan, we have many
more Nanjankotta folks with you.

888
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:52,921
We aren't holding your hand to
only take you back there.

889
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:55,372
But also so that you are never
separated from us again.

890
01:16:55,452 --> 01:16:56,941
These are people
from Nanjankotta who

891
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:58,389
have quit the party
and joined me.

892
01:16:58,772 --> 01:17:02,108
Ajayan, Bahulayan, Prasannan,
Deepu, Wahida teacher, Reenu madam.

893
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:05,257
No press or media has ever
come here to see us till today.

894
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:06,952
For they fear Amarnath!

895
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:10,194
Sir, do you think Amarnath
will sit idle when we come back?

896
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,467
It's also our wish to come
back to Nanjankotta.

897
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,217
But that's easy said than done.

898
01:17:15,818 --> 01:17:17,201
All of us here,

899
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:20,811
are scared of Amarnath.
That cannot be changed.

900
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:34,858
If there's a creature in your
house that scares you,

901
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:36,694
you should throw that out.

902
01:17:38,139 --> 01:17:41,030
But to do that, you need to
enter your house.

903
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:03,569
Appu, please don't kick me.

904
01:18:08,835 --> 01:18:10,866
Those cops chased me.

905
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:13,366
They surrounded me.

906
01:18:13,686 --> 01:18:17,342
When they were kicking and thrashing
me, the SI took away the cash.

907
01:18:17,585 --> 01:18:19,749
I know nothing else, Appu.

908
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:21,499
That man, Suraj...

909
01:18:21,733 --> 01:18:24,874
I suspected something fishy, when
he said he'd meet those Tamilians.

910
01:18:25,257 --> 01:18:28,132
There's no doubt about
where the cash is.

911
01:18:28,296 --> 01:18:29,896
I would've dealt with him,
back that day.

912
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:31,921
But you stopped me.

913
01:18:32,288 --> 01:18:35,217
Don't we have people to
cut off their limbs?

914
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,678
He will now come here
with those slum dwellers.

915
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:39,967
And will also ruin the election.

916
01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:42,741
So, let us not spend
any cash on promotion.

917
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,147
At least we can save on it.
And I must say, the SI

918
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:47,772
is a true man of guts.

919
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:50,467
Else, he would not have
summoned me...

920
01:18:53,882 --> 01:18:55,022
You!
- You...

921
01:18:56,007 --> 01:18:57,632
Place your head

922
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:00,507
in front of the SI to behead
and bark there!

923
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:05,132
DYP has dogs that also bite
and not just bark.

924
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:10,327
Do you know how much
cash we had?

925
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:15,147
That cannot be given away
to any -----.

926
01:19:16,686 --> 01:19:21,318
If our party is capable of deciding
how many votes do we need to win,

927
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,069
that's not

928
01:19:23,428 --> 01:19:26,913
because people of Nanjankotta
loves our party DYP.

929
01:19:28,339 --> 01:19:29,761
It's only because of one name.

930
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:32,033
Amarnath!

931
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,233
Lord Ganesha...

932
01:22:39,936 --> 01:22:42,217
I lost the chance of
being the MP.

933
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:46,936
At least show me some money,
on selling this Nanjankotta.

934
01:22:47,818 --> 01:22:50,537
I'll go away to Hyderabad
and live my life.

935
01:22:51,272 --> 01:22:53,498
I have certain other things
to do as well.

936
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,858
What is that?

937
01:22:56,225 --> 01:22:57,967
Isn't one baby enough?

938
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:04,967
'A woman's fury
is a curse for life.'

939
01:23:05,482 --> 01:23:06,802
Have you heard of it?

940
01:23:07,873 --> 01:23:08,873
No.

941
01:23:10,022 --> 01:23:11,248
You would not have.

942
01:23:11,623 --> 01:23:13,287
That's something
one must experience.

943
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:16,873
You please open the door,
let me go and check.

944
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,514
This is a challenge
before we wage a war.

945
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:28,194
You cannot rule us anymore.
- You cannot rule us anymore.

946
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:31,811
Take this as a warning.
- Take this as a warning.

947
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:35,038
You cannot suppress us anymore.
- You cannot suppress us anymore.

948
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:38,116
Take this as a warning.
- Take this as a warning.

949
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:41,350
Amarnath, let us warn you...
- Amarnath, let us warn you...

950
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:44,428
To hell with your ban!
- To hell with your ban!

951
01:23:44,506 --> 01:23:47,490
This is a challenge
before we wage a war.

952
01:23:47,678 --> 01:23:50,896
You cannot suppress us anymore.
- You cannot suppress us anymore.

953
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,709
Amarnath, let us warn you.
- Amarnath, let us warn you.

954
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,952
To hell with your ban!

955
01:24:02,576 --> 01:24:05,256
I don't think even I could have
described myself

956
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:07,998
so well.

957
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:12,287
But I am very sure about who
is behind you all.

958
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:16,327
He will soon know me

959
01:24:17,413 --> 01:24:18,850
and this village.

960
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:23,146
Carry on with your past time.

961
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:48,506
Are you coming here?

962
01:24:48,748 --> 01:24:50,186
Go ahead.

963
01:24:50,303 --> 01:24:51,801
If Mr Appu agrees to give
us the money we ask for,

964
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:53,209
we can do as he says.

965
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:56,014
He'll give us the money we ask,
for sure.

966
01:24:56,202 --> 01:24:58,397
He'll give us money
and we shall rock.

967
01:25:12,842 --> 01:25:15,991
I know how much money is required
for a college day function.

968
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:19,545
I will give them only half
the amount they've asked for.

969
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,405
Where's Rassak right now?

970
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:24,889
In Bangalore. Why did you ask?

971
01:25:25,365 --> 01:25:26,553
Nothing.

972
01:25:28,116 --> 01:25:30,092
Yes, mom. That is what I said.

973
01:25:30,178 --> 01:25:32,076
Don't get worked up
thinking about my result.

974
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:33,928
No, mom. Okay.

975
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,178
Is everything ready?
- Yes.

976
01:25:36,952 --> 01:25:39,389
Come on, get in fast.
- You come too.

977
01:25:45,858 --> 01:25:46,858
Sir...

978
01:25:47,733 --> 01:25:48,764
Kutta...

979
01:25:49,116 --> 01:25:51,991
You are so disobedient,
these days.

980
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,576
Am I?

981
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:56,467
If somebody comes to
our police station right now,

982
01:25:56,905 --> 01:25:58,233
who is there to help?

983
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:04,076
Whom did I tell about
this plan first?

984
01:26:04,608 --> 01:26:05,795
Wasn't that you?

985
01:26:06,747 --> 01:26:09,600
What did you tell me then?
That I won't understand

986
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:11,874
the pleasure of sitting alone
at the police station.

987
01:26:12,475 --> 01:26:13,772
So then why did you come now?

988
01:26:14,053 --> 01:26:15,756
That's right, but...

989
01:26:16,569 --> 01:26:18,381
I can sense some danger.

990
01:26:18,819 --> 01:26:20,014
Danger?

991
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:21,459
Correct.

992
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:23,733
Sir, I haven't come for money.
It's something else.

993
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:25,553
Amar has decided to get back
at us, right?

994
01:26:25,795 --> 01:26:27,795
Yes, how did you know that?
- Your face says so.

995
01:26:27,936 --> 01:26:30,194
But it's Appu and not Mr Amar.

996
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:35,380
I'm so helpless to be with DYP, sir.

997
01:26:38,553 --> 01:26:40,991
Well, do you really know
their plan?

998
01:26:41,202 --> 01:26:42,559
That is why, we planned
this celebration.

999
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:43,928
Okay, then let me celebrate too.

1000
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:48,607
You're good.

1001
01:26:49,014 --> 01:26:51,686
You scooted on knowing
what was happening.

1002
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:54,670
No matter what,
everyone has the fear for his life.

1003
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,506
Who is afraid?
- Don't make up now, sir.

1004
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,740
If you are not afraid of those
coming to burn you,

1005
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:01,021
are you here to fool them?

1006
01:27:01,169 --> 01:27:02,240
What?
- What did you say?

1007
01:27:04,295 --> 01:27:06,084
The boys...

1008
01:27:06,506 --> 01:27:08,459
Bomb! Petrol...

1009
01:27:09,108 --> 01:27:10,334
Don't you know?

1010
01:27:10,537 --> 01:27:12,779
Do you at least know,
you are in Nanjankotta right now?

1011
01:27:13,321 --> 01:27:15,602
If you don't want to be whacked,
tell me the entire truth.

1012
01:27:15,853 --> 01:27:18,264
College boys are on
their way with petrol

1013
01:27:18,304 --> 01:27:20,696
bomb to burn you and
the police station.

1014
01:27:22,391 --> 01:27:23,391
Sir...

1015
01:27:23,797 --> 01:27:26,008
Let's go to the police
station, sir.

1016
01:27:26,485 --> 01:27:27,485
No.

1017
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:31,595
I did not come here risking
my life to tell you a joke.

1018
01:27:31,837 --> 01:27:34,063
It's of no use telling me
once everything is burnt down.

1019
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:39,172
Kutta...

1020
01:27:39,423 --> 01:27:40,532
Sir, don't stop me.

1021
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:42,212
I will have to disobey you.

1022
01:27:42,415 --> 01:27:45,311
What you're doing now is
a hasty step, sir. Control.

1023
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:48,506
Go and sleep on your grandma's
lap. I have better things to do.

1024
01:27:49,108 --> 01:27:50,163
Get aside.

1025
01:27:53,413 --> 01:27:54,663
Sir, what's your plan?

1026
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:01,990
Biju...

1027
01:28:04,577 --> 01:28:05,749
Fifth gear.

1028
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:16,849
You crazy fellow...

1029
01:28:17,116 --> 01:28:19,716
We're going to set the police
station fire, will you burn our car?

1030
01:28:26,516 --> 01:28:27,594
Yes, mom.

1031
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,258
It's group study, mom.

1032
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:33,507
Group study... Hello...

1033
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:46,023
What are you...
- It's already on fire. Hang up.

1034
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,727
Does your dog bite?

1035
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:49,891
No, come inside.

1036
01:28:56,938 --> 01:28:58,258
Sir, is this cylinder full?

1037
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,528
How much does the orange cost?

1038
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:09,047
Aren't you Anup's dad?

1039
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:10,680
Light this.

1040
01:29:11,078 --> 01:29:13,554
Sir, no...
- Call your son.

1041
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,195
Why is mom calling me repeatedly?

1042
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,391
Be quiet.

1043
01:29:16,805 --> 01:29:17,805
Hello...

1044
01:29:19,007 --> 01:29:20,062
What's your name?

1045
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:22,250
Rosy...
- Hello...

1046
01:29:23,204 --> 01:29:24,211
Quiet.

1047
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:28,204
I don't want to hold Rosy's hair
or make her cry and let you hear it.

1048
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:30,883
But if I show how friendly I am,

1049
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:33,274
it is not only you who will suffer.

1050
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:36,235
Hey, our plan is foiled.
Come on, drive faster.

1051
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,860
Drive fast. Look over there.
Our plan is foiled.

1052
01:29:38,977 --> 01:29:39,977
What happened?

1053
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:41,610
Drive faster.

1054
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:45,547
Drive fast!

1055
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:49,944
I am getting a call
from my house as well.

1056
01:29:50,024 --> 01:29:52,391
Block them.
- Anup, where are you?

1057
01:29:52,727 --> 01:29:55,570
What did you do?

1058
01:30:02,946 --> 01:30:04,914
Hello...
- What's the problem?

1059
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:09,477
What?

1060
01:30:09,688 --> 01:30:11,392
Hey...

1061
01:30:38,985 --> 01:30:40,946
Didn't I tell you to
keep the flex boards

1062
01:30:40,986 --> 01:30:42,797
ready for places
where people gather?

1063
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:45,157
At the starch corner
and court corner,

1064
01:30:45,197 --> 01:30:46,821
our sign and flex was a must.

1065
01:30:47,258 --> 01:30:48,757
Shashank, what about
the flex at the

1066
01:30:48,797 --> 01:30:50,336
place where final
rites are offered?

1067
01:30:50,657 --> 01:30:52,680
I'll do that.
- When? After you die?

1068
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:55,860
I came after confirming
what I heard was true.

1069
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,148
Now, the Tamilians from different
places have come together.

1070
01:30:59,602 --> 01:31:01,266
What are you all doing here?

1071
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,157
Nothing has been decided
about selling Indira Estate.

1072
01:31:04,422 --> 01:31:06,844
I wonder when
the engineer will come.

1073
01:31:07,148 --> 01:31:08,242
But one thing is for sure.

1074
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:10,375
The Tamilians are coming here
after two weeks,

1075
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:13,219
only foreseeing the election.
I am sure about it.

1076
01:31:14,055 --> 01:31:17,414
These Tamilians
are very loyal to me.

1077
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,899
They're grateful to me and will do
anything that I ask them to.

1078
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,938
But that's not the point.
Amidst them, if there happens to be

1079
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:26,695
a Telugu or Kannada person?
Don't worry, anyway.

1080
01:31:27,594 --> 01:31:30,907
Shashank knows how to
deal with uninvited people.

1081
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:33,874
You will have to
interfere only if a

1082
01:31:33,914 --> 01:31:36,391
few of them have
barged in at Vyti.

1083
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,227
Only to buy their votes...

1084
01:31:57,579 --> 01:32:00,125
When the souls that come for
the final rites tomorrow return,

1085
01:32:01,219 --> 01:32:02,975
let him give them company.

1086
01:32:19,219 --> 01:32:20,250
Sir, shall we go?

1087
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:21,915
Sir, that's Mr Vyshakhan's
wife and daughter.

1088
01:33:37,344 --> 01:33:38,823
You go and start the jeep.
We'll leave

1089
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,344
as soon as this is over.
- Okay, sir.

1090
01:35:00,686 --> 01:35:01,686
Sir!

1091
01:36:45,656 --> 01:36:47,016
Kill him!

1092
01:41:52,905 --> 01:41:54,648
If DYP comes in rule,

1093
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,406
Amar will take charge.

1094
01:41:57,476 --> 01:41:59,116
Many new goons like Ummar
will come again.

1095
01:42:00,234 --> 01:42:01,758
Everything will be the same again.

1096
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,750
Abdulla...

1097
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,687
There was a village
that was untouched

1098
01:42:16,727 --> 01:42:18,226
by law, a few decades back.

1099
01:42:19,054 --> 01:42:20,226
Nandu Palayam.

1100
01:42:20,453 --> 01:42:23,312
Humans who killed
and played with others' lives

1101
01:42:23,781 --> 01:42:25,414
wreaked havoc.

1102
01:42:26,023 --> 01:42:27,203
Once...

1103
01:42:27,617 --> 01:42:30,586
When those beasts were killed
by the cops,

1104
01:42:30,914 --> 01:42:34,039
a twelve year old child
turned against the law.

1105
01:43:07,128 --> 01:43:09,104
But the law
instead of punishing him,

1106
01:43:09,471 --> 01:43:11,057
protected him.

1107
01:43:11,299 --> 01:43:12,899
No matter how many years
may have passed,

1108
01:43:13,096 --> 01:43:15,667
but the child was after all
the blood of one such beast too.

1109
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:18,448
How can I let Amar rule here?

1110
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:36,752
Sir...

1111
01:44:24,423 --> 01:44:25,843
The poor people whom
you had expelled

1112
01:44:25,923 --> 01:44:27,727
are getting ready to
come back next week.

1113
01:44:28,102 --> 01:44:29,942
Our village folks will be
here to welcome them.

1114
01:44:30,142 --> 01:44:32,149
Their condition is really bad
in that slum.

1115
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:35,118
You have already achieved
what you had to, in Nanjankotta.

1116
01:44:35,509 --> 01:44:37,013
If you leave something
little, they'll

1117
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:38,360
come here and earn their living.

1118
01:44:38,711 --> 01:44:39,992
So when they come back,

1119
01:44:40,321 --> 01:44:41,923
DYP shouldn't be opposing them.

1120
01:44:42,227 --> 01:44:44,204
Please consider this
as a request or a permission.

1121
01:44:44,438 --> 01:44:46,079
That's because,
the politics behind this

1122
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:49,595
is that few people will get
a friendly surrounding to survive.

1123
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:51,970
Before doing anything,

1124
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:54,587
if an enemy comes and ask
for permission,

1125
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:56,517
it gives a pleasure indeed.

1126
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:00,376
But I don't find that
pleasure now.

1127
01:45:01,267 --> 01:45:03,446
You need not give any hopes

1128
01:45:03,549 --> 01:45:06,009
to the beggar children
living in the slum

1129
01:45:06,571 --> 01:45:08,415
that they can come and play
in Nanjankotta.

1130
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:10,555
If you do so,

1131
01:45:11,657 --> 01:45:15,212
I know quite well who I need
to behead to stop them from coming.

1132
01:45:16,516 --> 01:45:18,016
So you better go

1133
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,321
and tell your dear SI

1134
01:45:21,134 --> 01:45:23,227
to come and fall at my feet.

1135
01:45:57,994 --> 01:45:59,001
Appu...

1136
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:01,064
What's your opinion about Appu?

1137
01:46:02,595 --> 01:46:05,173
Speaking ill of someone
who is about to die

1138
01:46:05,986 --> 01:46:07,666
is as good as killing him.

1139
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:12,665
Finish him!

1140
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:55,581
'The history of
revolution has always

1141
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:57,533
been pulling out
unnecessary flags.'

1142
01:46:58,041 --> 01:47:00,321
'But you have gathered here,
from different places'

1143
01:47:00,441 --> 01:47:03,041
'and may be less in numbers when
compared to a festival gathering'

1144
01:47:03,494 --> 01:47:05,900
'but when you reach Nanjankotta, '

1145
01:47:06,032 --> 01:47:09,430
'that will create history
that will be remembered for ages.'

1146
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:14,492
Every step you march forward will
be as powerful as thousand waves.

1147
01:47:15,047 --> 01:47:19,180
The next generation should be
as powerful as that,

1148
01:47:19,813 --> 01:47:22,156
so that they can fight back

1149
01:47:22,258 --> 01:47:24,578
any odd situation claiming
that you aren't isolated.

1150
01:47:24,742 --> 01:47:26,735
Such should be the journey
that you start now.

1151
01:47:37,638 --> 01:47:39,802
Is there any improvement
in Appu's health?

1152
01:48:04,724 --> 01:48:06,114
He is still alive.

1153
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:08,286
That's all.

1154
01:48:09,528 --> 01:48:11,317
There is no hope.

1155
01:48:59,113 --> 01:49:00,673
Tomorrow is the day
we were waiting for.

1156
01:49:01,348 --> 01:49:03,871
When those who were shattered
and lost become an obstacle,

1157
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:08,254
they should change the law
with blood and not with tears.

1158
01:49:08,668 --> 01:49:11,902
Every word you say should
echo there, in Nanjankotta.

1159
01:49:12,387 --> 01:49:13,856
Tomorrow when the dawn breaks,

1160
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:17,863
every man who was suppressed
will repeat your words after you.

1161
01:49:18,012 --> 01:49:21,144
To hell with your ban!
- To hell with your ban!

1162
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:24,464
This is a war cry before a war!
- This is a war cry before a war!

1163
01:49:24,715 --> 01:49:27,770
Don't try to suppress us anymore.
- Don't try to suppress us anymore.

1164
01:49:27,856 --> 01:49:30,988
Amarnath, this is a warning for you.
- Amarnath, we warn you.

1165
01:49:31,285 --> 01:49:34,339
To hell with your ban!
- To hell with your ban!

1166
01:49:34,504 --> 01:49:37,870
This is a war cry before a war!
- This is a war cry before a war!

1167
01:49:38,012 --> 01:49:41,160
Don't try to suppress us anymore.
- Don't try to suppress us anymore.

1168
01:49:41,293 --> 01:49:44,754
Amarnath, we warn you.
- Amarnath, we warn you.

1169
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:50,449
Sir...

1170
01:49:51,957 --> 01:49:54,395
Get aside. Move back.
- Back!

1171
01:49:54,582 --> 01:49:57,777
Sir, will Dr Sangeeta be the new
contestant in place of Appu?

1172
01:49:57,981 --> 01:50:00,582
Sir...
- Don't crowd here.

1173
01:50:00,707 --> 01:50:02,783
There will be a press meet soon.
We'll explain everything.

1174
01:50:02,863 --> 01:50:04,190
Yes, we'll see.

1175
01:50:04,621 --> 01:50:07,277
Sir, will you please tell us
the status of DYP with BSJD?

1176
01:50:07,746 --> 01:50:10,199
I don't know. We don't know
if we're going to have an alliance

1177
01:50:10,317 --> 01:50:12,207
with BJSD and DYP.

1178
01:50:12,504 --> 01:50:15,621
Maybe, in future... We don't know
what is going to happen. Okay?

1179
01:50:16,965 --> 01:50:21,020
There won't be an alliance with
DYP announced BJSD officially.

1180
01:50:21,402 --> 01:50:25,145
'Incidents that followed...'

1181
01:50:25,441 --> 01:50:27,386
Well, we have a press meet
to attend.

1182
01:50:27,597 --> 01:50:28,722
Get ready.

1183
01:50:34,626 --> 01:50:37,516
Only saying that the Tamilians
won't come back, will not work.

1184
01:50:38,649 --> 01:50:40,548
We need to convince BJSD that.

1185
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:42,000
Do you get it?

1186
01:50:42,571 --> 01:50:44,134
When you look from a
distance, they're

1187
01:50:44,174 --> 01:50:45,571
the ones who ran
for their lives.

1188
01:50:46,774 --> 01:50:48,403
But if you look at
them closely, they're

1189
01:50:48,443 --> 01:50:50,071
the ones who lied at
your feet in fear.

1190
01:50:50,961 --> 01:50:53,726
That is how they will always be,
in front of me.

1191
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,351
Hail DYP!

1192
01:51:28,476 --> 01:51:31,437
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1193
01:51:38,671 --> 01:51:40,593
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1194
01:51:43,265 --> 01:51:46,187
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1195
01:51:46,351 --> 01:51:48,351
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1196
01:51:51,968 --> 01:51:54,882
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1197
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:57,944
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1198
01:51:58,108 --> 01:52:01,170
Hail DYP!
- Hail DYP!

1199
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:28,171
Sir, we've got the remainsy
of the body. They're bringing it.

1200
01:53:27,203 --> 01:53:28,203
I'm Biju.

1201
01:53:28,749 --> 01:53:30,515
SI has sent me to
give you a message.

1202
01:53:31,499 --> 01:53:33,252
Doctor, you need not
stay back in Nanjankotta

1203
01:53:33,292 --> 01:53:34,579
in the greed of becoming the MP.

1204
01:53:34,968 --> 01:53:37,414
If you do so, your experience
will really be terrible.

1205
01:53:38,475 --> 01:53:41,319
You saw what happened to Appu.
Young blood, after all.

1206
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:44,124
But what happened?
You better leave too, doctor.

1207
01:53:44,414 --> 01:53:45,748
Or if you are
planning to sell off

1208
01:53:45,788 --> 01:53:47,554
Nanjankotta and leave
for Telangana forever,

1209
01:53:47,859 --> 01:53:48,906
we'll let you know.

1210
01:53:49,234 --> 01:53:51,354
But not in any ground
where people relieve themselves.

1211
01:53:51,585 --> 01:53:52,835
Keep this in mind.

1212
01:53:53,085 --> 01:53:54,085
I'll leave now.

1213
01:53:57,127 --> 01:54:00,877
Appu was nominated as the contestant
only because Amar insisted.

1214
01:54:01,299 --> 01:54:03,159
And not because I wanted to.

1215
01:54:04,362 --> 01:54:06,862
While talking about Appu

1216
01:54:07,151 --> 01:54:10,471
in the press meet, it will be
nice if our eyes are wet.

1217
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:15,864
How do you look at
the responsibility

1218
01:54:15,904 --> 01:54:17,565
of being the new
contestant of DYP?

1219
01:54:18,666 --> 01:54:19,706
Answer them, dear.

1220
01:54:22,596 --> 01:54:25,725
I am not the new contestant of DYP.

1221
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,029
I'm going back to my own
professional life.

1222
01:54:30,241 --> 01:54:31,579
Thank you.

1223
01:54:44,459 --> 01:54:46,991
Didn't you recognize me?
I'm Ramalingam's son.

1224
01:54:47,358 --> 01:54:49,067
I'm contending for the next
council election.

1225
01:54:49,147 --> 01:54:51,428
Senthil, tell the party.

1226
01:54:51,936 --> 01:54:53,069
Ask them to laugh.

1227
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:55,358
Did the cops trouble you?

1228
01:54:56,147 --> 01:54:58,295
Tell me, I will set them straight.

1229
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,717
Madam, you need not be afraid.

1230
01:55:04,432 --> 01:55:06,292
No matter who amongst us fall,

1231
01:55:07,065 --> 01:55:08,745
we must be more responsible

1232
01:55:09,064 --> 01:55:11,664
and complete the task we have
started. That's what Suraj had said.

1233
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:14,362
We shouldn't waste anymore time.

1234
01:55:17,111 --> 01:55:18,986
Avani, shall we leave?

1235
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:21,776
Everyone present here,

1236
01:55:21,979 --> 01:55:23,752
walked out of that village

1237
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:26,010
knowing that we'll be injured.

1238
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:29,643
But as we started trying
to go back there,

1239
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:31,517
many things happened.

1240
01:55:31,893 --> 01:55:34,698
They are doing all this
only to shatter you.

1241
01:55:35,276 --> 01:55:36,392
That shouldn't happen.

1242
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:39,284
You must overcome this situation.

1243
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:43,377
You must return to Nanjankotta
just as Suraj had wished.

1244
01:55:43,541 --> 01:55:44,385
That will not happen.

1245
01:55:44,502 --> 01:55:45,409
Grandpa...

1246
01:55:45,534 --> 01:55:47,096
Hold on, I'll talk to them.

1247
01:55:47,307 --> 01:55:50,244
Sir, our party is having a meeting.

1248
01:55:50,901 --> 01:55:53,198
You don't worry about this.

1249
01:55:53,541 --> 01:55:55,783
You just mind your own duty.

1250
01:56:02,949 --> 01:56:05,129
You came here from Nanjankotta,
fearing Amar.

1251
01:56:06,059 --> 01:56:07,066
From here?

1252
01:56:07,426 --> 01:56:08,706
You will go to some other place.

1253
01:56:09,848 --> 01:56:11,356
You will keep running away

1254
01:56:11,598 --> 01:56:14,254
but still politicians like them
will stab you some day.

1255
01:56:15,168 --> 01:56:17,824
What will you do then?
Will you go under the earth?

1256
01:56:32,953 --> 01:56:33,953
Avani...

1257
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:37,179
The pain and agony of
being lonely and isolated...

1258
01:56:37,445 --> 01:56:39,492
There are people in Nanjankotta

1259
01:56:39,828 --> 01:56:41,257
who experience that more than you.

1260
01:56:42,796 --> 01:56:45,316
They will be waiting in Nanjankotta
tomorrow to hold your hands.

1261
01:56:46,437 --> 01:56:47,632
Don't let that go in vain.

1262
01:56:49,664 --> 01:56:51,687
The one who led us is gone, sir.

1263
01:56:52,421 --> 01:56:55,773
Can we rest saying that he did
that to take us back to Nanjankotta?

1264
01:56:57,015 --> 01:56:58,796
We will not have a good life,
over here.

1265
01:56:59,726 --> 01:57:01,351
But in all these years,

1266
01:57:01,664 --> 01:57:05,039
we never had to fear Amar,
even for a single day.

1267
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,961
Nanjankotta still belongs to Amar.

1268
01:57:09,781 --> 01:57:12,875
It is only because we dreamed
of going back that Suraj got killed.

1269
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,875
Whatever you had to lose,
is gone!

1270
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:18,382
But that's not the case with us.

1271
01:57:35,195 --> 01:57:37,320
Doesn't he want me
to go and request him?

1272
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,179
So I will go.

1273
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:03,078
Nanjankotta and I share
the same attribute.

1274
02:00:03,609 --> 02:00:06,468
What fell here will work as
a fertiliser to whatever grows here.

1275
02:00:06,804 --> 02:00:09,632
You fell while I was born here.

1276
02:00:11,054 --> 02:00:13,601
So, how can you say that
Nanjankotta has changed?

1277
02:02:29,838 --> 02:02:32,135
Nanjankotta is always mine.

1278
02:02:44,778 --> 02:02:46,786
This is the problem
with you outsiders.

1279
02:02:49,302 --> 02:02:50,911
You fall very easily.

1280
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:29,729
When you judged the outsiders,
you were mistaken, Amar.

1281
02:05:22,989 --> 02:05:24,958
Till someone comes from the slum,

1282
02:05:25,896 --> 02:05:27,716
he must lie here
in the same position.

1283
02:05:38,536 --> 02:05:40,755
Abdulla, like Ummar,

1284
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:43,036
people who made him grow
are now history too.

1285
02:08:02,058 --> 02:08:03,401
'The border wall collapsed.'

1286
02:08:03,855 --> 02:08:05,894
'They stamped it
and crushed it into the soil.'

1287
02:08:06,308 --> 02:08:09,558
'The remains of what created
history in Nanjankotta'

1288
02:08:10,026 --> 02:08:11,620
'will remain to be stories alone.'

1289
02:08:13,698 --> 02:08:16,284
'As he came to put an end
to the tyrannies in Nanjankotta, '

1290
02:08:16,698 --> 02:08:18,894
'he knew he would be
worshipped as a hero.'

1291
02:08:19,144 --> 02:08:20,664
'Maybe that is why,
he never returned.'

1292
02:08:21,066 --> 02:08:23,941
'Probably, the wounds of
the twelve year old'

1293
02:08:24,448 --> 02:08:27,691
'were so deep that never healed.'

1294
02:08:28,558 --> 02:08:31,558
'That is why, a good bye
had no significance.'

1295
02:08:32,806 --> 02:08:36,221
'New slogans and war cries
would be waiting for him.'

1296
02:09:21,042 --> 02:09:22,244
Hey!

1297
02:09:22,901 --> 02:09:25,807
Did you all seek my permission
before you organised this?

1298
02:09:27,339 --> 02:09:29,894
Or do you pay me extortion
money every month?

1299
02:09:31,252 --> 02:09:33,291
Ravanapuri is my palace.

1300
02:09:33,941 --> 02:09:35,964
None of you can escape from here.

1301
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,901
Not even the God who created me
can escape.

1302
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:42,870
I shall decide how you will
live and what you will do.

1303
02:09:43,659 --> 02:09:45,612
None of you are capable
enough to fight me.

1304
02:09:46,222 --> 02:09:48,409
If any of you come to me
asking for forgiveness,

1305
02:09:48,698 --> 02:09:51,105
remember that I forgive
by killing the one.

1306
02:09:58,909 --> 02:09:59,941
What is it?

1307
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:01,362
Is there a problem?
