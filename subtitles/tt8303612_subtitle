1
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,960
'The meaning of this verse'

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
'Sages, seers, angels'

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
'Birds'

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,240
'Living things under the sea'

5
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,080
'All of them will change
according to passage of time'

6
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
'But...'

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
'No one can change
the sky, right?'

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,120
'That being the case'

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,760
'Why are we as human beings
so stubborn in our opinions?'

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,760
'If what we wish doesn't happen'

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
'If whatever happens isn't
what you had in mind'

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
'Why do you worry?'

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,280
'I keep repeating
this to Adithya'

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
'He's like that from childhood'

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,240
He used to wear an
ordinary toy watch

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
By the time I could make him
switch over to a brand like Titan

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
I really lost my patience

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,680
If he gets a new watch

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,680
...he won't part with the old watch
to anyone nor will he trash it

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,560
Even now he has all his old watches
nailed on his wall on display in his room

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,920
Including that toy watch!

22
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,000
If he likes something
that's it, 1-track mind!

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Very surprising

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,280
To have that kind of
quality at so young an age

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Of course

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
Listen to this

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
He wanted a vehicle
to commute to college

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,240
I told him to take one of the
cars parked in our garage

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,200
He insisted on a bike

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,680
His father referred Sharma who
works in a Harley-Davidson

31
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
Or our friend Rashid
working in a BMW showroom

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,080
Asked him to book the
latest motor bike

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Adithya was very particular
he wanted only a Bullet

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,720
That too, he wanted only
his grandpa's Bullet

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,200
He was more stubborn than a mule
and he got his way, imagine!

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
'So sweet!'

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,800
'80 days since he left home, pa'

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
We are living happily without
giving him a second thought

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Even if it is 800
days I don't care

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Is his love story so immortal?

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
What has happened now?

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Ma...?

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Not 80 days, da

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,720
82 days since I asked him
to get out of the house

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Bear this in mind

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,840
If you delve too deeply
in any subject in life

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
...you'll be left
with only a zero

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Your brother is now
very close to that zero

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
Murthy, start the bike

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,960
Hey idiot! That's my nighty

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
Disgusting!

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,680
"Baby, I'm preying
on you tonight"

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,080
"Hunt you down eat you alive"

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,400
"Maybe you think
that you can hide"

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,760
"I can smell your
scent for miles"

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

58
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
"Baby I'm-"

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,080
"So what you trying to do to me"

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,480
"It's like we can't
stop, we're enemies"

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
"But we get along when
I'm inside you, eh"

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,720
"You're like a drug
that's killing me"

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,160
"I cut you out entirely"

64
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,600
"But I get so high
when I'm inside you"

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,720
"Yeah, you can start
over you can run free"

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
"You can find other
fish in the sea"

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
- 1 sec - Hey! Not on top

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
Just strip from waist down

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
1 sec...1 sec

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,720
I'll help you

71
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
Hey wait I'll take it off

72
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
- I'll undo it - What's
your tearing hurry?

73
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
Darn this knot!

74
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,080
Don't snip it off...hey don't!

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
'Sathya?'

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,960
'Darling!'

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
'Are you there?'

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
- 'Open the door' - Oh gawd!

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,680
My fiancÃ©! I think
he's at the door

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,960
Why is he singing
some random song?

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,480
Aiyo! Is that important?

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
- Please go - 'Darling!'

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,520
2 minutes We'll be done

84
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,600
- 'Darling, open the door'
- Listen

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
I don't want to spoil this mood

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,000
But for the 1st time he and
I will be meeting alone

87
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Please go now

88
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,520
It's okay, baby 1st
time for us too

89
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,440
He will wait You don't worry

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
Please leave!

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,560
I said 'leave me'

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
- Leave me, huh?
- GO

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Do it!

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,160
What me...me? Take it off

95
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,000
Did I offer myself?
You called me

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,280
You give me a hard on and
then ditch, what the hell!

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Will you strip or-

98
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,440
"Baby, I'm preying
on you tonight"

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,800
"Hunt you down eat you alive"

100
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
"Just like animals, animals
like animals-mals"

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
Darling?

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,800
- Hi Lekha - 'Hello, sir'

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,440
Didn't you say you
missed my seminar?

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
Want to come? I'll
give the address?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
'Shall I come to the
seminar hall, sir?'

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Hey! No...no...no Come
to my flat, okay?

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,200
'Idiot!'

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
- Hi da - 'Hey Parthi'

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,280
- Open your mouth - 'When
I came to your clinic'

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Remember a girl was raving about
my looks and wondering who I was

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
Deepthi our family
friend Why do you ask?

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,200
If I call her will
she come to my flat?

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Flat...I swear!

114
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Hey machan, bad
idea Listen to me

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Please don't invite trouble

116
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Nothing to worry

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
Will she come or not?

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,040
She already has a boyfriend They
are getting married next year

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Please understand

120
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Oh! Next year?

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,520
'Then will she come now?'

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
- Hey - Hey!

123
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,360
Yes or no?

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Dai! Medical psycho!

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Why are you so cheap,
getting bad to worse?

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,680
'She won't come, da'

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,880
'1st wind up all this and
try to forget Meer-'

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,240
'What do you want?'

129
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,320
Auto!

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Hey, what is this?

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,760
- Did you pee on my seat?
- Diaper overflowed

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
What...diaper?

133
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,440
Disgusting! Don't you know
when you get the urge to pee?

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Messed up fellow!

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
'Hey, look at his pant'

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,120
- Yuck!
- Peed in his pants

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,800
Meera

138
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
Meera

139
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey Meera, what are you eating?

140
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Idiot, open your mouth

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,760
What are you eating?

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Is it chicken? Spit it out...out

143
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Who gave you chicken?

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
Sir, dogs eat chicken you know

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Maheshwari, haven't I told
you not to call her a 'dog'

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,800
- Sorry, sir - Has Meera
given you any work?

147
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm the one who cleans her poop

148
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
- 'Yes' - Then why do
you find it a hassle?

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
When did you start eating meat?

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
Aren't you vegetarian?

151
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Did it tell you, sir?

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
I mean did she tell you?

153
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,920
Yes, she did

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Attend to your work

155
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
What, sweety pie?

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
Hey...!

157
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,560
If you giggle again
you've had it from me

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Look, Meera, how she's
laughing at us!

159
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,520
'Deepa, you have a
surgery in 4 hours'

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
- 'Be alert' - Okay

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
Don't get a shelling

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
Good morning, sir

163
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Shave-

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
- Good morning, doctor - Morning

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Come here Come...come

166
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
This is a classic case of
angular mal union of the femur

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
This is also for
you Pay attention

168
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,920
Like our skin heals when cut
same goes for bones too

169
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Last time when your hand got fractured you
went to a local doctor who bandaged it

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay, what happened actually is

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,840
It has healed but
at an angle, okay?

172
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
So mobility has been affected

173
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
That's why you felt
excruciating pain

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
What we intend doing now

175
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Break this and remove
all the excess

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Fix it with a plate and screw

177
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,360
'Doctor, my leg needs surgery'

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,840
But they've shaved me all over

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
'Knife didn't harm any
vital organs, no?'

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,920
During your rounds won't you
explain to the patient?

181
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
We did, sir

182
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,440
Uncle, this is-

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
Our procedure

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
Don't get tense

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,480
When a cricket match is played
not only is the pitch cleaned

186
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
Entire ground is cleaned, right?

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
This is a similar case, okay?

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Don't get stressed, okay?

189
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
You'll be alright

190
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,200
You said you fought with your
sister Did you patch it up?

191
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
We are okay now, sir

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,960
Just get bed #18 ready

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,080
That patient's astrologer said
tomorrow is a better day it seems

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,240
Hey! I can't come tomorrow I
need to take Meera to the park

195
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
Then how, sir?

196
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,160
How means how?

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Tell him sepsis has already
set in his leg, it's septic

198
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
If we don't operate today I'll
cut his tool along with his leg

199
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Okay

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,400
- Deepa, check the Operation Theater
- Okay, sister

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Sir, medical officer has asked me
not to enter it in the log book

202
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,520
Your patient count will be
very high in the last 2 months

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,680
If there's any
problem because of-

204
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Log book issue is your problem

205
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,160
Don't bring this shit to me, Tulsi
You go handle it yourself, man

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay, sir

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,640
"Yeah, keep it hot Keep it
flowing like a rock star"

208
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,440
"Fake your bitches Keep
it growing like a monsta"

209
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,440
"If hurdles try to obstruct you If the
world wants to break you into two"

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,000
"Son of a gun, break that forever
Close the chapter altogether"

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
"This is your life, I swear"

212
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,200
"So eff the world
eff the people"

213
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,280
"Eff the pain, gotta censor this
shit Cos I'm gonna make it rain"

214
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,560
"It's Adi-V"

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
"Yeah, remember the
name It's Adi-V"

216
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
"Adi-V"

217
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,920
Boys

218
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
- Sorry, huh?
- 'No problem, bro'

219
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
'We enjoyed the show, Adi'

220
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,560
Tarun

221
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,440
- Show - Here

222
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Where else?

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,800
Hey! Careful, man

224
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,160
Cover with your hand If it
spills inside, you're done for

225
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Wearing your briefs will
be Mission Impossible

226
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,520
- They'll make you sit out
- Shut up!

227
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,880
What kind of medicos are you?

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Don't you keep a First
Aid kit in your bag?

229
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Einstein, did we dream, in this match
sir will give us a feast to remember?

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,800
'Right now, St Patrick's
is leading the match'

231
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,880
'And we have Ajay all
set with the equalizer'

232
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,560
- Hey Ajay - 'Come on, Adi'

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,240
Break his face, huh?

234
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,240
'Very important match and
very important shot'

235
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
Is that your plan, da?

236
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Score your goal, da

237
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,240
Score a goal and I'll run around
Balmatta circle in my birthday suit!

238
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,560
Come on Score a goal

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,360
Come on

240
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,640
Oh yes! Come on, Adi

241
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
'Adi ready, counter counter'

242
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
'Adi, pass the ball here'

243
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Go, mark him

244
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,440
Hey! Adi

245
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,720
You-

246
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,520
Come on

247
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,040
Wait, da

248
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,280
Madcap! Why are
you grabbing him?

249
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
- I dare you -
He's provoking you

250
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Adi, listen to me Wait
for just 3 minutes

251
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,200
'Referee is their
guy Listen to me'

252
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
Calm down, Adi
Please let's go back

253
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
- Come on, guys, ready - Come on

254
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,040
'Ajay, what are you looking at?'

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,920
'Bro, go...go...go'

256
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
Come on, boys

257
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
'Well done...well
done What a shot!'

258
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
'Fantastic!'

259
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
'Hey! What is it now?'

260
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey Samar

261
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,120
Only 3 minutes left

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
St Patrick's will get
the cup this year too

263
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,200
Come on, boys, come on

264
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Parthi, look over there

265
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
- Adi, look behind you - Adiii!

266
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Coach!

267
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,600
Hey Tarun

268
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,920
Close that gate just
once For my sake, please

269
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,680
Adi, don't

270
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,640
'Kick him, Adi Come on!'

271
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
'Don't leave him'

272
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
'Boys, please stop him'

273
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,800
'Machan, don't let him go'

274
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,560
'Stamp him on his mouth'

275
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,880
Hit him, machan
Beat him to a pulp

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,200
Don't spare him

277
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,960
Smash him up, dude

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,360
Split his lips

279
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,320
Don't spare him, dude

280
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
'Super, da'

281
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,560
Hey!

282
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,920
Keep it there

283
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,280
- You know Tarun sports a 6 pack
- Chee! Shut up

284
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,400
Adi, you yelled at 1 chap
Do you know who he is?

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,000
Convenor of Karnataka
State Football

286
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,520
The way you slapped him with 'respect'
he had goose bumps all over his face!

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Don't know where he went after
placing the cup over there

288
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,360
He knows the cup is ours

289
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,840
That's why he left

290
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,000
Give me some water

291
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,800
- Here - Adi

292
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
Dean is calling you

293
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
'Good morning'

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,560
And very warm welcome
to all you new students

295
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,840
So how does it feel being part of a
college with a 100 year tradition?

296
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
May I come in, sir?

297
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,880
A college with-

298
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Come in

299
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,920
This is Dr Adithya Varma

300
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,400
One of our house surgeons

301
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,320
You must meet a person
like him for sure

302
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,480
He is a topper of the college

303
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
Topper of the university

304
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,800
And topper of the board

305
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,000
I can say, he is one of the few students
to have passed out of St Patrick's college

306
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,880
...with an impeccable
track record

307
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,120
But in anger management

308
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Zero

309
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,680
He is a classic example

310
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
For all of you

311
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,600
In the medical profession

312
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
'If a doctor who
cannot control anger'

313
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,520
...handles a surgical blade
it is equal to murder!

314
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
To hate

315
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,080
Get angry

316
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Rush of blood

317
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Adrenalin

318
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,640
Everyone experiences all these

319
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,240
But only when all these
can be controlled

320
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Plus ignore these
you can be yourself

321
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
When you treat a patient

322
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,240
...if you lack compassion
what is the use of a degree?

323
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,160
'Even a poor show in
academics I can tolerate'

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,040
But I just can't tolerate it
if anger can't be controlled

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,400
I have all the videos
of that match, sir

326
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,800
I can play it for you

327
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Actually he isn't
to be blamed, sir

328
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm going to be brutally
honest over here

329
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,920
I don't need your post analysis

330
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,920
Get out

331
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Wait, da

332
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Go ahead, sir

333
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
Adithya

334
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,120
I am very disappointed
with you, Adithya

335
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,160
Did you ever think of the
reputation of our college?

336
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Okay, you write an apology letter
to the Sports board immediately

337
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Write another letter
to the college also

338
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
Addressing it to me

339
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,200
And I want to see a
photocopy of that letter

340
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,400
With your signature
on the notice board

341
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,160
Along with 1 month's suspension

342
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Otherwise you can
leave the college

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Football is a violent sport, sir

344
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
To strike a goal in the opponent's area
where their goal keeper is guarding it

345
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
And to stop them from
coming into our area

346
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,680
This is the football I know

347
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you teaching me the rules?

348
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
No, sir

349
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm stating my reservation

350
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
That's all

351
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Sir, that game exudes
a self-respect

352
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,120
In that fight

353
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,040
...in all that cheer and
revelry a war like feel

354
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,720
College is the reason
for those feelings

355
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
I thought about the college, sir

356
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
A lot

357
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,080
That's why I controlled my
anger for such a long time

358
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,240
If something appears wrong to me

359
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,640
I can't be a silent spectator!

360
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,520
In case that becomes
a habit, sir?

361
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Not only on the
ground In my life too

362
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,880
So it has become a habit?

363
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
To bash up people?

364
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,080
You cannot manhandle anyone

365
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,640
I felt satisfaction
in that fight, sir

366
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,680
Before that, you

367
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
The bias of losing
this championship

368
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Nothing

369
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,760
If I had spent 3 more
minutes on the ground

370
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,240
...a felicitation function would
have been held right here

371
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,080
But that's not me

372
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
I don't need it

373
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,200
Even our college doesn't need it

374
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,640
And frankly, sir

375
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,080
I don't care

376
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,760
Listen to what happened

377
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,080
I don't need to ask you to watch
the video nor are you compelled to

378
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,040
And I am not a rebel
without a cause, sir

379
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,000
Or a murderer with a hand blade

380
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,320
I'll leave college
same time tomorrow

381
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,040
'Are you leaving
college for good?'

382
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,720
What will you achieve in life
with this kind of seething anger?

383
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
You won't understand, sir

384
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,320
You are the dean of this college

385
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600
An employee doing his duty

386
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,240
But I'm a student
in this college

387
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,760
This is my college

388
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,760
Show some respect
to the champion

389
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,040
Hello ma'am

390
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,400

392
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,440
Is it really necessary?

393
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,040
'Can't you write an apology?'

394
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,560
Okay, the NOC papers are ready

395
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,760
- Get it signed by the dean
- Okay

396
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,000
'The Dean is in a parent's meeting
You may have to wait for 2 hours'

397
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
Alright

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,480
I swear it was Salma

399
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Okay

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,800

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
"Saluted by sages is she"

414
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:26,320

Praised by the Vedas is she"

416
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,760
"Saluted by sages is she Grants

417
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,160
"Who speaks words sweet as honey

Good morning, sir

422
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,800
Bro, do you see that
girl in a pink outfit?

423
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
That's her

424
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,040
She's a stunner

425
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,800
She's embarrassed I think

426
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,560
You're the one embarrassing
her So you just leave

427
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Get lost!

428
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Bunking class?

429
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
Shut up and get lost

430
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,840
Who?

431
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
Girl in that pink 'churidhar'

432
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Cute, isn't she?

433
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,960
Hey girlie!

434
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Stand up

435
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,120
- What's your name?
- Meera

436
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,840
Full name

437
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
Meera Shetty

438
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
Shetty, huh? Mangalore?

439
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,280
Settled in Chennai but
she's from Puttur

440
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,160
Just 30 km from here

441
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,080
What's her name it seems?

442
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Hey! Baby

443
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,400
Heard sir asking for your name?

444
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,360
- Tell him - Meera

445
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
Very pretty, right?

446
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,120
- Look at our Romeo
- So cute she is

447
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
- Yes, pa?
- 'Adithya'

448
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,960
'You know our manager Sundaram?'

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
'His cousin's daughter
has joined your college'

450
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,320
- 'Here, dad?'
- Yes

451
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,920
- Your college is famous for
ragging - 'Our college, huh?'

452
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,160
He's so petrified she'll be ragged He
asked me to tell you to keep an eye

453
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
I'll take care

454
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
Pa, ask him about
the football match

455
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey! Your anna wants to know
about the football match

456
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
Turned into a problem

457
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,560
- I bashed up a player -
'Why lose your cool?'

458
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,280
- 'What did the dean say?'
- Suspended me for a month

459
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
You'll get a formal letter
Please ignore it, okay?

460
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Alright

461
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
'Adi...?'

462
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,800
The entire class is
creating a big ruckus

463
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,880
Looks like that girl has
complained to her dad

464
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,280
And that chap is shouting out your
name like he's in an auction!

465
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,160
So?

466
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
You're already under suspension

467
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,080
Do you need all this?

468
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,560
To pass this course
is a pain by itself

469
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
Hey! Check if that's him

470
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,840
Adi, he hasn't seen you as yet

471
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Quietly escape

472
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,080
That girl's bringing her dad along on cue
like how a WhatsApp location is shared!

473
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,200
I am Adithya Varma

474
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
Though you're a doctor
are you smoking?

475
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,920
690 carcinogenic agents

476
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
4 cancer factors

477
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,800
48 COP diseases I
know and I smoke

478
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,120
Become a habit

479
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,240
- Is your father aware of this?
- No

480
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,360
But I won't lie if he asks me

481
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay

482
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm Manohar Shetty

483
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
Your father's
manager, Sundaram...

484
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm his first cousin

485
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,600
Oh! Uncle I'm so sorry

486
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,920
My dad asked me to
keep an eye on her

487
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,360
My daughter, Meera Shetty

488
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,360
Hi Meera

489
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Keep a look out for
her as a brother

490
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,440
No...no...no I can't
be her brother

491
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,320
I don't have a sister I'm
oblivious to such emotions

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,080
I might even take the
liberty of hitting her

493
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
If she scores poorly

494
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,880
She'll be junior I'll
be senior, okay?

495
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,920
Which quota?

496
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Rank holder

497
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,920
What about you?
Management quota?

498
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,040

EAMCET-26th rank

500
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,960
I like Mangalore

501
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,720
That's why I selected
this college

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
Okay, uncle I'll make a move

503
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
You take care It was
good meeting you

504
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
I'll see you

505
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,800
Bye, Meera

506
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,840
Let's go

507
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
Uncle

508
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't worry I'll take care

509
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,040
- Hey! Look over there
- Oh my gawd!

510
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
What's he doing here?

511
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,120
"Every moment life is changing"

512
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,280
"Shade sometimes juxtaposing
with sunshine dancing"

513
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,600
"Live every moment
to the fullest"

514
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Hey! Where is she off to?

515
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,840
Hey! What ya?

516
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
Adithya sir

517
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,760
- What?
- Oh! Yes

518
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,800
How is the campus?

519
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
Good

520
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
Canteen food?

521
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
It's good

522
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Good good

523
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,880
Is the hostel comfortable?

524
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,840
Playing 'Antakshari' song game?

525
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Has your dad left?

526
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,240
Oh! My God

527
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
No one saw me kiss you

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,080
What does he mean by that?!

529
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,160
We didn't see either, da

530
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Go and play Antakshari

531
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
He's having a ball

532
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,680
Met her in the morning
Imprinted her in the evening

533
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,720
"Is this some kind of magic in a way?
What has happened to me today?"

534
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,760
"Is there a scar in my heart now?
Has love bloomed somehow?"

535
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,920
"Has some magic spell poleaxed me?
Why is my life different suddenly?"

536
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,960
"A sweeping sense of comfort in my soul?
My mind oscillates out of control?"

537
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,920
Good morning, sir

538
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,720
Meera

539
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,760
Go back

540
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,440
Meera, this isn't
a normal degree

541
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,320
MBBS

542
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,360
When you join this college it
should get fixed over here

543
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,800
That we are doctors

544
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,840
What are you doing
sitting over there?

545
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
Focus on the board

546
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Back

547
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,200
You

548
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,520
You see these fat chicks

549
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,080
They are like teddy bears

550
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
They will always be warm

551
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
And loyal

552
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,000
Usually girls aren't
friendly with each other

553
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,720
But a beautiful girl
and a fatso will bond

554
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,800
A good looking chick
and a fat chick

555
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
Deadly combination

556
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Trust me, this
friendship will work

557
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
- What's your name?
- Ragini

558
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
Ragini, Meera

559
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,440
Meera, Ragini

560
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,120
Be friends, okay?

561
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll inform the hostel as well

562
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,960
You'll be room-mates, okay?

563
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,480
Whose class is it today?

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
Prabhakar sir

565
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Anatomy

566
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
- Topic?
- Hand

567
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
Okay, come with me

568
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm preparing for my masters

569
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
If I teach you for
me too it will be-

570
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,920
Revision...come

571
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
What?

572
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,120
"Is this true, my
one and only love?"

573
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,280
"As a boon from above Iâll
make you mine right now"

574
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,280
"Even though every night
I dream about you"

575
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,000
"Come, I need you by my
side in reality too"

576
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,040
"For the first time in my life I find
a change has taken over my mind"

577
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,120
"My face will see you crystal
clear smile from ear to ear"

578
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,400
"Both my eyes will ask sincere
who is this so dear?"

579
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,120
"My beloved so beautiful
Light of my life bountiful"

580
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,920
What's the topic?

581
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,520
- Fore arms - Let's go

582
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,680
"Don't feel this way
about anyone else"

583
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,800
"Can't take anyone into confidence For
this 1st time feeling of wellness"

584
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,880
"When she plays football
with her glances"

585
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,800
"Beautiful eyes of the lassie lances
Persisting playfully mischievous"

586
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,520
Meera, what's today's topic?

587
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
What happened, Meera?

588
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
Upper thorax

589
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
Alright

590
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,720
"Not knowing if itâs
night or noon, dear"

591
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,800
"Shall I come as
your shadow here?"

592
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,920
"Without the static
seconds being aware"

593
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,600
"Shall I receive your
tender loving care?"

594
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,640
"Were you born on this
earth for only me?"

595
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,760
"Are you the fire flaring
within me daily?"

596
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,400
"Come and subdue the
demon, my love-ly"

597
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,000
"My sole sweetheart My
soul mate counterpart"

598
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
'I just want to
tell you...nothing'

599
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,000
You are killing me, da

600
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,240
Parthi, call again

601
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,120
Is patience an alien
virtue for you?

602
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
Were you delivered as a normal baby
or did you jump out of the womb?

603
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Try once more She
may pick up, no?

604
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,200
Try calling Neha at least

605
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,520
She didn't answer either
Check my phone if you want

606
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
Why didn't she answer?

607
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,680
Ask her yourself if
she picks your call

608
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,120
I'm just saying, if they have left
won't they be here in 5 - 10 minutes?

609
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,400
Hey! I've referred your name and
warned the entire 1st year batch

610
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,560
Not a single chap will go
near her So stop bugging me

611
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,840
Only you'll smear colored
powder all over her, happy?

612
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,800
I came to surprise you

613
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
- You're driving me to commit suicide
- Dai!

614
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Motor-mouth? Blabbered, huh?

615
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,680
He's torturing me with
his non-stop questions

616
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,520
I can even feel an
ant-bite after 7 beers!

617
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
Damn question bank!

618
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,520
- What's that on your cheek?
- Slight...injury

619
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,640
Want a beer?

620
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,280
He must have done
some hanky-panky!

621
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
I banged against a door

622
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,640
Will that 'door'
be 5'2" tall, huh?

623
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,400
Short hair, chick who changes 7
'kurtis' for the same jeans, right?

624
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Adi, I went to the girls' hostel

625
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,880
I saw Meera sitting
there in a white dress

626
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
No problem at all System
is fully under our control

627
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,080
I'll go up to her hostel

628
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
Please do, thank you!

629
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,240
Raghav sir

630
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
- Hey Adi - What's up, sir?

631
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,160
Good to see you

632
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,600
- Raghav sir - Village bumpkin!

633
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,200
You've changed a
lot How are you?

634
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,440
- I'm good, sir - Hi
Tarun, how are you?

635
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,960
Happy Holi, sir

636
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,720
- What's news?
- Sir, smoke?

637
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,560
- Long time no see - Thank you

638
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,720
- How's life treating you?
- I'm okay, sir

639
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,360
This dean is wantonly
screwing up my case, man

640
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
- Why, sir?
- I have no idea

641
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,160
And God knows why Spurthi
is stuck to Bangalore

642
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,920
Not in touch at all

643
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,840
I don't know what's
happening, man

644
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,360
- How many months as House Surgeon left?
- 1 second, sir

645
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Hello

646
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
What did you say, you -

647
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,640
Who the hell is he?

648
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
- WHO IS HE?
- Hey Adi

649
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,040
Stay right there I'm coming

650
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,080
'Here...here, okay?'

651
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
'It's alright'

652
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,120
Idiots...!

653
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,560
Don't cry

654
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,880
Adi sir

655
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,640
Will anyone cry for
something like this?

656
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,120
Wash your face and come

657
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,200
Sir!

658
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,320
Were you fooling around when students
from another college got in?

659
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,440
Not what you think, sir

660
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,160
They were 6 of them

661
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,280
6 of them...?

662
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
TELL ME!

663
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,280
'Sir, they fought with you in
the football match that day'

664
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,280
'They were students
from that college'

665
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,520
'They asked for Adithya
Varma's girlfriend'

666
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,320
'In front of everyone, they smeared
those dyes on her and left, sir'

667
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,960
Tell me exactly where
they smeared color

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Sir...here

669
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,720
Even on her hips, sir

670
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
SAMAR!

671
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
SAMAR, COME OUT, YOU-

672
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,480
SAMAR!

673
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,240
'Look who's here'

674
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,920
Football champion with
a baseball bat, huh?

675
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,480
Bringing a stick along, eh?

676
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,800
Adi, don't Let him go

677
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,360
WILL YOU TOUCH HER?

678
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
- Try and touch her!
- Sit

679
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Try to lay your hands on her

680
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,040
Damn...! I'll kill you

681
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't...keep quiet!

682
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Hey! Parthi

683
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,400
- Sit - You didn't see
where he touched Meera

684
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,000
It's okay, Adi

685
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Will you manhandle your womenfolk
like this in your house, tell me?

686
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,440
Are you okay with it?

687
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,720
If you hit him once
more he may even die!

688
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
Relax, Adi

689
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Adi, leave it

690
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,840
If this can happen
when we are still here

691
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,280
After 6 months when we leave

692
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,640
Who will look after her, huh?

693
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Who can guarantee nothing
drastic will happen?

694
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,520
- He's responsible
- Hey! Calm down

695
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,200
Give me the guarantee
she will be safe

696
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
- Assure me nothing will happen to Meera
- Give me a cigarette

697
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,680
Calm down, Adi

698
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Relax

699
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,640
- Don't, Adi - Let go

700
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,880
Move aside

701
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,480
Let go

702
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,520
- What's he doing?
- Lighter

703
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
Samar

704
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,360
I love that girl

705
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,640
We live in a physical
growing world

706
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,240
When I was growing
up I understood this

707
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,400
If something happens to us

708
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,240
If we die

709
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,600
There will be someone
who is 'most affected'

710
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,600
She's that person in my life

711
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,680
If anything happens to her I will be
the most affected, do you understand?

712
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,240
Samar

713
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,800
What you did is unpardonable

714
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,360
Promise me, I have no
patience right now

715
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,720
Promise me right now

716
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,920
Promise me

717
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,480
- It's okay - Don't cry

718
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,320
Promise me

719
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,440
I promise

720
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,400
It won't happen hereafter

721
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,240
You...you

722
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,520
'You keep saying 'London groom'
this will be the result'

723
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800
'Overdose of loose talk, ma'

724
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,600
'If you had heard him speak you
would've slapped him yourself'

725
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,120
'What?'

726
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,320
'No, ma, I'm in the clinic now
I'll talk to you later, bye'

727
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,320
Comparing efficacy of
metal implant with-

728
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,240
Bro, are you writing a
thesis in this mood?

729
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
What are you made of, Iron man?

730
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,200
Brain will be sharpest
only in this mood

731
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,800
Hey! Why have you put these
fishes in separate bottles?

732
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,440
Our neighbor Peter gave them to
me when he left for his hometown

733
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,880
But these fishes were getting randy
at night and disturbing my sleep

734
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,080
They were making a racket dashing
against the glass surface

735
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,720
That's why I've separated
them in individual bottles

736
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,200
What will they do now?

737
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,240
In a world where we are unhappy,
no one else should be happy

738
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,800
Do you understand?

739
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
What happened?

740
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,960
Doomsday for me!

741
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,120
Sir!!

742
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,640
I'll make mincemeat-

743
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
God help me

744
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,800
Adi, don't hurt her

745
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,840
You are dead meat today

746
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,760
It's just a glass Forgive her

747
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,240
Adi, don't lose your temper

748
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,720
Save me!

749
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,880
Don't disgrace yourself

750
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Adi...!

751
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Hey!

752
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,000
Are you mad or what?

753
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
Running behind her?

754
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,520
Does she have any sense?

755
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,280
She has broken 10 glasses so far

756
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,680
My golden drop glass

757
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,680
So will you chase
her to hit her?

758
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,720
She's part of a big
gang in the city

759
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,680
If they seek revenge
we'll be the sorry lot

760
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,120
- Why unnecessarily- - How
many times to tell you?

761
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,760
Butter fingers all the tim-

762
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,200
Move aside

763
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,680
What happened?

764
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,200
Fixing it with a suture?

765
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,880
- Yes - How old is she?

766
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
19?

767
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,080
Will anyone suture her?

768
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,520
Won't it self-heal at this age?

769
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Instead of gawking
couldn't you tell her?

770
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,560
Hey! We just got here

771
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,800
Idiots!

772
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,320
Your hands itching to operate
because you're studying medicine?

773
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,960
Is she the guinea pig?

774
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,760
Did she pass her MBBS or-

775
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Move, di

776
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,440
Cotton

777
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,320
Bro, it's a deep cut

778
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,640
She needs sutures

779
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,480
Think beyond book knowledge

780
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,120
Basic First Aid will do
May be a bit painful

781
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,560
Just bear with me, okay?

782
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,240
Where were you
wandering barefoot?

783
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,160
Try and talk to-

784
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,160
Get a wheelchair

785
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,800
Will you tell me if I ask why?

786
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,680
I'll take Meera to
the beach house

787
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
It is a deep cut actually

788
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,240
She'll find it difficult to
commute from hostel to canteen

789
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,920
- Poor thing, she's young
- Very young, is she?

790
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,800
Hey! He's planning something big

791
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,480
- Look at his serious expression -
Internal tests are round the corner

792
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
- How will she study?
- Smooth operator, man!

793
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,120
I'm anyway suspended and jobless

794
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,920
I'm her local guardian, right?

795
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
Her dad has asked me to
take care of her, no?

796
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,960
Don't drip with
responsibility, Mr Adi!

797
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,120
Her dad asked you to take
care of Meera as a sister!

798
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Not draw on her hand
and explain Anatomy!

799
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,160
Get the wheelchair, da

800
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,600
Where are you off to?

801
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,920
To the girls' hostel

802
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,640
If I ask you why
will you reply, da?

803
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,000
Why do I see beer bottles
in junior hostel?

804
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
- Sir!
- Are you drinking beer here?

805
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
No, sir

806
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,560
How did a shard of glass
pierce Meera's foot?

807
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,880
Pack her stuff in a bag, go

808
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Okay, sir

809
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,880
Isn't the warden here?

810
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
No, sir

811
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
If she comes, tell her Meera has
gone to her local guardian's house

812
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,200
Packed her nightdress?

813
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,880
It's outside

814
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,240
- Those?
- Those 2 are hers

815
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,040
So in this place is Apple bones

816
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,640
"With waves of nectar
I felt overfilled"

817
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:37,240
"From my man nectar spilled
And I felt ever so fulfilled"

818
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,480
"I blossomed daily with delight"

819
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,960
"Like the water lily
blooming at night"

820
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,880
"New eyes looked at me anew"

821
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,760
"Eye lids stroked me
into a love so true"

822
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,120
"Dreams are waves of
pleasure quickening"

823
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,080
"Dormant desires of
ambrosia awakening"

824
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,640
"Passion sings a melody
Eyes light up in rhapsody"

825
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,520
"How can we forget the
impact on our body?"

826
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,240
Stay right there

827
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,800
Meera is inside

828
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,280
Thanks

829
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,400
- We'll sit this sid-
- Not there either

830
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,880
I've dried Meera's clothes there

831
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,640
My clothes are also drying there

832
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
Oh! I bundled all of it into-

833
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,160
- Where did I- - You
bundled my clothes?!

834
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,440
Are you going out?

835
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,880
No

836
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,520
Oh! Going to the theater?

837
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,880
Don't shove us like this

838
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,440
- Want money?
- It's okay

839
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,160
If need be we can beg!

840
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,280
Okay, da

841
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,760
Did you say something?

842
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,080
I said 'shut the
door real tight!'

843
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,520
"I found the scent of chrysanthemum
breeze through my home sweet home"

844

to lend constancy to our feelings"

845
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,440
"Time, days, dates are driven
by the hands of our clock 24x7"

846
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,040
"Kisses you etch on my lips I need
Iâll never kiss goodbye to this greed"

847
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:10,280
"It may seem like pain at first
Nevertheless a sweet surplus"

848
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,560
"Pleasure extreme
beyond any dream"

849
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,560
Adi, what do you like about me?

850
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,840
Your breathing style

851
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,680
I like the way you breathe

852
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,160
"I felt satiated supreme"

853
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,400
Meera

854
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,160
Isn't this brush yours?

855
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
Yeah

856
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,360
What, I say?

857
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Nothing, it's evident that
girl will be staying here

858
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,000
Don't keep shooing me off
to the beach and park!

859
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,080
Do you get it or are you
pretending you don't?

860
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,080
You and Tarun shift
to the campus

861
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,520
Control freak!

862
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,920
We are also coughing
up rent for this place

863
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,640
Okay, go

864
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,920
Meera

865
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
What?

866
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,720
Today is my birthday

867
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:45,240
"As far as my eyes can view who
else will I want but you?"

868
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,600
Hey! Happy birthday

869
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,680
"This girl's body and soul too
will unite with you, my beau"

870
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:59,240
"Wonât the rain flirt with pleasure
because the sky is looking at her?"

871
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,680
"Wonât the cool wind blow and caress
to refresh her sweat-drenched dress?"

872
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,920
"With me as one shore
and you as another"

873
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,560
"We swirled together
to merge as a river"

874
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,920
"With waves of nectar
I felt overfilled"

875
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,760
"From my man nectar spilled
And I felt ever so fulfilled"

876
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,520
"I blossomed daily with delight"

877
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,720
"Like the water lily
blooming at night"

878
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,200
"New eyes looked at me anew"

879
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,000
"Eye lids stroked me
into a love so true"

880
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,120
"Dreams are waves of
pleasure quickening"

881
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,880

ambrosia awakening"

00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,480
"How can we forget the
impact on our body?"

884
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,160
- Will you pack 2 more books?
- This box is done

885
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,520
Kuchi, listen properly
This contains your books

886
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,360
That has your clothes
and that's your gadgets

887
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,560
'Now what?'

888
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,160
Meera, your exams are over, eh?

889
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,200
Aren't you leaving?

890
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,920
We have to leave day after
Aren't you packing?

891
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,480
I'll pack my stuff tomorrow

892
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,560
Adi

893
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,320
Shall I stay behind 2 more days?

894
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,800
All this 'goodbye' is
not my cup of tea, baby

895
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,720
If you're in Mangalore how
can I leave this place?

896
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,920
Go tomorrow, baby

897
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Okay?

898
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,240
You go to Missouri
I'll go to Chennai

899
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,560
But same day, please, baby

900
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,840
You don't get it

901
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,520
Didn't we already discuss this, baby?
Why change our plans now?

902
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,480
Even your tickets
have been booked

903
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,320
Have you packed your stuff?

904
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,680
"I was 5 and he was 6"

905
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,800
"We rode on horses
made of sticks"

906
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,120
This beach house

907
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,360
The times we spent together

908
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,560
'Final year housy'

909
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,200
'Mangalore St Patrick's life'

910
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,600
Mangalorean chicken
curry Fun...jolly times

911
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,760
All this is gone
Done & dusted, da

912
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,680
What is 'done and dusted', huh?

913
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,280
As if someone is dead and gone

914
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,520
What is over, da?

915
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,000
He is flying to UK I'm
going to Missouri

916
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,200
You'll open a clinic
in Pudhupettai

917
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,520
Who knows where all of us
will be 3 years from now?

918
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,360
Gushing on 'nostalgia'
and mushiness

919
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,640
Your life is crystal clear

920
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,000
Hey guys, guess what?

921
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,680
Our Raghav sir Spurthi video
has gone viral in our college

922
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,520
- Did you watch?
- What video?

923
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,440
They went for a long
ride in his bike

924
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,240
They have been kissing each
other during the ride nonstop

925
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,320
But didn't lose focus
on the road one bit

926
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,360
Their concentration must have been on
their bike, not the kisses they shared

927
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,560
Baby, don't get mad at me

928
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,640
Let me stay back
for 2 more days?

929
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,000
Baby, please

930
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,040
Tarun

931
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,880
Let's kiss tonight

932
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
What?

933
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,080
- Kiss?
- I'm serious

934
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,600
'Tarun, don't get caught Pay
heed to my words of wisdom!'

935
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,600
Have I ever called you 'Tarun'?

936
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,280
- No - 'That's real great form!'

937
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,720
Hey! What's up with you?

938
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,880
"Hoist your flag of victory"

939
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,600
'Why are you green
with jealousy?'

940
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,360
Adi?

941
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,640
Adi, will you listen to me?

942
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,800
Baby

943
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,200
Baby, listen

944
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,520
Baby

945
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,080
Hear me out

946
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,320
Just 2 days please

947
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
Why do you simply
target my weak spot?

948
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,880
Irritating me past 2 days
with this same '2 days'

949
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,280
Have I died or what?

950
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Baby

951
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,560
Baby, will someone cry for this?

952
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,680
Bab-

953
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,520
Baby, are you crying?

954
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,360
Look here Don't cry, baby

955
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,440
I'm sorry

956
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm sorry

957
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,040
Babe

958
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,880
Oh god!

959
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,800
"Distance emphasizes now
true depth of our love"

960
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,480
"Tears glisten in
my eyeâs alcove"

961
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:40,960
"In the same world as you"

962
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,880
"As long as I exist,
will do, love"

963
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:53,360
"My mind struggles relentlessly
to look for you restlessly"

964
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:59,520
"Will I see you or not, I worry
this girlâs heart is in a quandary"

965
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,160
"Come, the light of
my life I nourish"

966
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,320
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

967
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,360
"Come, my world totally"

968
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,880
Hey!

969
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,160
Are you mad, Meera?

970
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,800
How did you come so far?

971
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,720
- I took a bus - Bus!

972
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,120
Stupid girl

973
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,600
Baby, it isn't even 15
days since we went home

974
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,800
- I want- - It's
like 15 years to me!

975
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,960
But I missed you

976
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,520
"Embrace me, my universe"

977
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,760
"I belong to you for
better or worse"

978
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,200
"I feel the scent of you in the
breeze that blows through"

979
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,920
"I see your footprints unravel
in every path I travel"

980
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,800
"Every second I breathe everyday
this distance seems so faraway"

981
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,960
"My burden like a boulder
becomes heavier on my shoulder"

982
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,440
"If you are not here
neither am I, my dear"

983
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,640
"Absence of the sky in her life
this moon is waning in strife"

984
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:30,720
"Come, the light of
my life I nourish"

985
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:36,840
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

986
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,920
"Come, my world totally"

987
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,120
"All slices of 'me'
belong to you solely"

988
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:54,920
"Come, the love of
my life I nourish"

989
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:01,000
"Hug me, the bond
I deeply cherish"

990
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,880
"Come, my world totally"

991
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,360
"All slices of 'me'
belong to you solely"

992
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,560
Hey!

993
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,400
Congratulations, Dr Meera

994
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,800
- Thanks - Is this your house?

995
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,600
- Impressive - Come inside

996
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,080
Adi, this is my brother Mithun

997
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,840
- Mithun Shetty - Adithya

998
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
- Adithya what?
- Mithun! Behave

999
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,840
Yeah...yeah

1000
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,360
- Amma, this is Adi
- Hello, aunty

1001
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,480
- My sister - Hello

1002
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,520
Aunty, I would like to
talk to you and uncle

1003
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,520
Is uncle here?

1004
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,680
He has gone out
Anytime he'll be back

1005
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,160
Okay

1006
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,080
In the meanwhile can I
take Meera to my place?

1007
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,360
Tomorrow is my brother's wedding

1008
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,960
At the moment, actually
there's a function at home

1009
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,680
We'll be back in an hour

1010
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,600
Congratulations! But at our house all
the decisions will be taken jointly

1011
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,760
You'll have to wait for him

1012
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,120
- Would you like to take any coffee or tea?
- No, I'm alright aunty, thank you

1013
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,120
'Missing me?'

1014
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,960
I'm missing you so much

1015
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,360
MEERA!

1016
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,640
Meera, don't worry
I'll talk to him

1017
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,920
I got this

1018
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,640
Uncle, this is what I
wanted to talk to you-

1019
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,880
Appa!

1020
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,080
Rascal!

1021
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,920
I knew you would barge
in here when I saw you

1022
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,320
Let's discuss this
Please don't get mad

1023
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,880
Shut up!

1024
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,720
Uncle, listen to me just once

1025
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,840
If you step in here again
you'll be minus your legs

1026
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,160
- Uncle, please - Don't, pa

1027
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,240
Appa

1028
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,960
Useless fellow!

1029
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,960
Would you do this if I
was your son-in-law?

1030
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,480
I will never choose a groom
like you for my daughter

1031
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,600
You want to talk to me
or you want me to leave?

1032
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,320
Meera, go inside

1033
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,000
Meera, your dad is looking with
a totally wrong perspective

1034
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,680
Sit him down and explain to him

1035
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,240
We are not teenagers

1036
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,680
Talk to him like a woman

1037
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,600
'Meera, go inside'

1038
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,680
GO!

1039
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,040
Stop!

1040
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,480
What work do you have
on Meera's terrace?

1041
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,320
Why are you looking back?
Look at me, da

1042
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,440
Hey!

1043
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,880
My bro-in-law!

1044
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,680
I love your sister
to kingdom come

1045
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,280
Understand?

1046
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,600
We are like family now, bro

1047
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,840
Go put some sense into
your father's head, man

1048
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,120
You look so much like
your sister, da!

1049
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,840
Yuck!

1050
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,920
- Which grade are you in?
- 12th

1051
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,200
Wrap up all these foolish antics

1052
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,240
Focus on your studies

1053
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,600
Okay?

1054
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,360
Understood?

1055
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,680
What did you promise
this set up?

1056
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,840
I'll throw a party

1057
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
- Party, huh?
- 'He screwed up'

1058
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,320
Party

1059
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Here

1060
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,160
Hey!

1061
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,240
Tell your father
I kissed you too

1062
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,240
What happened, Aditya?

1063
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,040
Appa, I haven't told you as
yet But there's this girl-

1064
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,680
- I haven't- - No, just
tell me what happened

1065
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,840
That's what I'm trying to tell
you I know a girl called Meera

1066
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,080
I really love her

1067
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,600
I hadn't met her for 6 months
So I had gone to her house

1068
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,080
On her terrace-

1069
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,480
We were in our private space

1070
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,800
Suddenly her dad came from this side
and he got it all wrong in his mind

1071
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,920
What are you talking about?
I just can't understand

1072
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,480
Tell me what happened, da

1073
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,720
That's what, appa, we are
meeting after SIX months!

1074
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,120
Meeting for what?

1075
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,120
I'm telling you, pa we
were in our private space

1076
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,560
We were in a corner on her terrace and
suddenly her dad came from the other side

1077
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,360
He misunderstood it
and it just took-

1078
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,600
I can't understand

1079
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,880
What is private space?

1080
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,960
- You explain to him -
What is all this, Adi?

1081
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,240
Tell me, da

1082
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,840
- How old were you when you got married?
- My age?!

1083
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,800
What was your age?

1084
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,320
How does that matter now?

1085
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,280
Hey Sid Keep quiet

1086
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,160
How old were you when
you got married, dad?

1087
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,240
23

1088
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,840
Okay, now what's my age?

1089
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,720
How are the two connected?

1090
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,720
Dad, what's my age?

1091
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,640
What is he trying to say?

1092
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,760
Sid, ask him to reply
How old am I, dad?

1093
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,360
What's my age, dad?

1094
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,000
25...you're 25 now

1095
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,400
- That's it!
- That's what?

1096
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,480
Now I think you understand
what private space means?

1097
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,800
- Sorry, I don't understand
- Hey! Adithya

1098
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,760
Ask him to explain He's
talking in riddles

1099
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,400
- What's he talking about?
- Dad

1100
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,440
I'll talk to him, you go

1101
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,200
You go inside I'll talk to him

1102
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,920
Please go in, pa

1103
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,800
Adithya, get up and sit, dear

1104
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,320
It's all fine, if you are in
a hurry to get married...

1105
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,440
...you should ask
'Appa, get me married'

1106
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,800
Instead, if you ask him 'How old
were you when you got married?'

1107
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,400
Isn't it wrong, da?

1108
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,880
If I say 'Meera and I were
in our private space'

1109
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,520
'You have done something
wrong' he blames me'

1110
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,720
Badgers me to tell
him what I have done

1111
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,280
What do I say, grandma?

1112
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,320
He just doesn't understand

1113
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,600
What do you expect
him to understand?

1114
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,400
Love is the space both of you
share exclusively in college

1115
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,880
Marriage is a different
space altogether

1116
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,360
There will be minimum 10 people on
the side of the bride and groom

1117
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,800
There will be many nosey
parkers in between

1118
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,960
They will be judgmental

1119
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They will debate all the do's and
don'ts to see you are happy together

1120
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,920
Don't get flustered by
the number of advisers

1121
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,680
Both of you should
be steady as a rock!

1122
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,000
Not move an inch

1123
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,120
That's a great relationship

1124
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,160
It worked out easy for you and grandpa
because of the same caste factor

1125
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,920
That's what you think!

1126
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,240
Did it happen that easily?

1127
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,200
My mother and her sister spoke their
mind I must say rather insensitively

1128
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,200
'It was wrong to have sent her
to Delhi to study' they said'

1129
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,520
'She has torn our
dignity to shreds'

1130
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,520
They were both rude and crude

1131
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,120
All this is common

1132
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,800
Happens everywhere all the time

1133
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,200
When a woman falls in love

1134
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,000
...her priorities are different

1135
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,800
Okay, what if they had said they
will never accept whatever you do?

1136
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,160
I would have convinced them

1137
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,960
If they said, 'we just won't accept
There's no room for that topic'

1138
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,880
I would have still
convinced them

1139
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,640
Meera's dad has a foul temper

1140
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,200
You look at him as a
short tempered man

1141
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,400
To Meera he is her father

1142
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
1st you reduce your anger

1143
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,880
Grandma, Meera

1144
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,920
Come in, dear

1145
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,240
No formalities Sit down

1146
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,040
You look made for each other

1147
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,440
You will both be fine

1148
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,240
Don't worry

1149
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,520
You'll lead a happy and
long life together

1150
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,840
Do you believe me?

1151
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,560
Thief! Cat got your tongue?

1152
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,680
See you

1153
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,400
Adi, is this your house?

1154
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,640
Did you talk to your dad?

1155
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,240
- Not yet - Very good

1156
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,800
- Don't talk - Why?

1157
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,160
No, it's okay, don't

1158
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,400
Don't tell him

1159
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,040
Did you kiss my brother?

1160
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,920
Yes, I did

1161
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,920
I'll kiss your parents too

1162
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,560
I don't know why
you are so amused?

1163
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,240
Baby

1164
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,480
Our wedding night
will be on this bed?

1165
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
1st night?

1166
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,240
549th night!

1167
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,200
You keep count?

1168
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,800
No

1169
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,520
Just like that

1170
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,680
TLC!

1171
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,080
Then how were you bang on?

1172
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,840
549 times

1173
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,080
How do you know 549 is correct?

1174
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,480
You keep count?

1175
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Baby

1176
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,920
Let's make it 550

1177
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,880
Now?

1178
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,520
- Right here?
- Yeah

1179
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,360
What's wrong?

1180
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,120
Appa

1181
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,160
He is really in
love with that girl

1182
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,880
Let's go and talk to her parents
before things get too complicated

1183
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,880
What do you want me to do?

1184
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,760
In another 2 days
you're getting married

1185
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,400
You want me to meet them now?

1186
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,600
Whatever he rushes
into foolishly

1187
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,160
...he's stubborn enough not
to take us into confidence

1188
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,800
That girl shares his clarity too

1189
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,920
No need, let them
come and talk to us

1190
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,000
- Your dad at home?
- Stay right there

1191
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,360
Don't come in

1192
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,120
I apologize for what
happened yesterday

1193
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,520
But based on that please
don't judge us both

1194
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,200
I love Meera very much

1195
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,080
I'll take care of her very well

1196
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,560
I've completed my
Masters in medicine

1197
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,280
Wherever I practice I'll get
a minimum of 200000, uncle

1198
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,800
I'll take care of
her better than you

1199
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,520
I think once our
families meet up

1200
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,640
...you'll get some
confidence in the matter

1201
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,480
I know you come from a
very respectable family

1202
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,560
No, uncle

1203
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,880
That's not what I
was trying to say

1204
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,720
You're misunderstanding
this, uncle

1205
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,840
I know very well

1206
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,120
You'll show off your
affluent temerity

1207
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,440
Uncle, I know you think
all this is juvenile

1208
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,440
But please think of this just
once...with an open mind

1209
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,760
If you do that you'll
understand the depth we share

1210
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,760
Depth?!

1211
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,560
I am impressed by your
usage of such 'deep' words

1212
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,400
Please let him finish, appa

1213
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,200
Shut up, you shameless girl

1214
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,920
Before inviting him over

1215
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,920
'...did you think
of our feelings?'

1216
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,320
Listen to me clearly

1217
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,000
The caste and family background
I choose my son-in-law from

1218
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,960
...is a matter of prestige to me

1219
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,360
But to think I'll get my daughter married
to you is simply out of the question

1220
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,000
- Get lost, man - Please
don't interfere, Kishan

1221
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,520
Have you lost your mind?

1222
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,320
I love Meera

1223
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,440
Meera loves me

1224
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,040
And this is how you treat me?

1225
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,400
I am a surgeon!

1226
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,960
I'm an educated professional Not
some riff-raff from the street

1227
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,240
And who the hell is
this guy, Meera?

1228
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,400
If this is how it is

1229
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,840
If this is how it will be

1230
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,120
I expected it, I'm leaving

1231
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,440
- Adi, please listen - Meera!

1232
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,720
- 'Adi...!'
- MEERA

1233
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,640
Baby, listen to me

1234
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,200
You should have told your dad
what's going on between us

1235
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,720
What's got into you? Why
are you raising your hand?

1236
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,080
I can't recite magical
poetry like you do, Meera

1237
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,640
And even if I do, it's waste Your
parents have no idea of love

1238
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,720
If they did, they won't
oppose our relation-

1239
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,800
Meera, this is too
much Just come inside

1240
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,560
He's getting our
parents involved

1241
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,840
Adi...please!

1242
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,720
- Baby please - 'Meera'

1243
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,480
What happened?

1244
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,720
Hey! Who the hell are you?

1245
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,600
Call the police Dial 100, da

1246
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,520
Hang up Let's go

1247
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,040
Do I deserve this?

1248
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,080
Adi

1249
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,600
Love deserves respect
Why all this, baby?

1250
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,720
You quote cinematic dialogs
I'll smash your face

1251
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,520
What's up with him?
Can't he understand?

1252
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,640
Won't he open his mind?

1253
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,560
Adi, that's my father!

1254
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,520
How's that? Say it once more

1255
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,240
I'll use my choicest cuss
words at them, Meera

1256
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,000
Meera, imagine this is NOT 2019

1257
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,600
Imagine the time kings ruled us

1258
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,640
I've waged a war against your
dad for coming in between us

1259
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,040
I would've chained him and
locked him in a metal cage

1260
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,000
And I would have married
you in front of him, Meera

1261
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,680
In traditional Tulu style

1262
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,920
Have you gone mad?

1263
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,200
Have you completely lost it?

1264
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,560
Yes, I've completely lost it

1265
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,640
Look at me

1266
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,680
Baby, please

1267
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,680
Don't people in love say this?

1268
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,000
I was born for you

1269
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,320
You were born for me

1270
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,040
Do you know what I thought?

1271
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,120
Not only you, Meera

1272
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,520
Your father and mother
Their respective parents

1273
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,120
Their grandfathers and
forefathers were all born for me

1274
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,880
To make love To make babies

1275
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,320
So they can make babies So
they can make you for me

1276
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,960
To make us meet

1277
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,800
And what happened here, huh?

1278
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,760
Listen to me

1279
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,840
I'll give you 6 hours time

1280
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,920
Decide what you intend doing
in those 6 hours and call me

1281
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,200
I'm ready to do anything
to live with you, Meera

1282
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,120
If you feel the
same way, call me

1283
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,840
If you don't call you know me

1284
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,240
Please, Adi Don't complicat-

What got complicated, tell me?

1288
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,280
Maximum what can they do? They
will get you married to some chap

1289
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,120
Go...go...go, I curse that you
get married to a Tulu guy

1290
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,440
Adi...Adi, please

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,080
Meera, let me go free

1292

- My bones will get dislocated, Meera
- Don't do this, Adi

1294
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,200
Your dad is looking
disapprovingly at us, Meera

1295
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,360
I don't care

1296
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,080
- Your dad is looking - Baby

1297

- Oh my God!
- Why are you doing this, baby?

1298
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,240
What about your family pride?

01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,880
What about your Shetty pride?

1300
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,640

Baby

1303
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,880
I won't leave you
and go anywhere

1304
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,360
Do you even think I can
survive without you?

1305
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,680
6 hours, Meera

1306
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,080
Adithya, what happened to you?

1307
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,480
Why shouldn't I drink in
your bachelors' party?

1308
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,120
- Please do - Then why
ask what happened to me?

1309
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,400
Enjoy yourself

1310
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,680
Have fun, okay?

1311
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,080
What the hell is this, Meera?

1312
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,800
Amma, there are 100s

01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,560
'Shameless girl Shut up!'

1316
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,800
What rubbish is this, Meera?

1317
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,880
Yeah, we were beneath the sheets

1318
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,480
Clothes off

01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,200
Naked

01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,880
Shut up! How dare you talk so
dirty in front of your parents!

1323
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,160
Meena, take her mobile away

1324
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,240
Groom is ready, right?

1325
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,040
Murthy

1326
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,080
Get this...medicine for me

1327
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,560
Adithya

1328
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,920
Adithya

1329
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,720
Adithya, open the
door Meera has come

1330
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,200
Adithya!

1331
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,680
'Adithya, what are you doing?'

1332
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,080
'Open the door'

1333
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,800

01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,080
'Open the door'

1335
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,400
'Meera is here to see you, da'

1336
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,440
Lucky, da

1337
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,080
What is this combination
of alcohol and morphine?

1338
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,480
What is his problem?

1339
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,840
What do I say, sir?

1340
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,520
If it rises 1 more point, you know
he'll slip into coma for sure?

1341
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,920
Will he be able to wake
up before noon, sir?

1342
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,120
Don't you know, Parthi?

1343
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,440
For his brother's wedding?

1344
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,480
No, sir, today is his
girlfriend's wedding

1345

The girl I saw during
the 'holi' fight?

1347
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,400
Does he know this?

1348
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,120
This is such a
jinxed college, da

1349
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,760
Not a single person who was in
a relationship is happy today

1350
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,720
Tough, Parthi

1351
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,600
Sir won't be up for
another 36 hours

1352
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,800
Call me when he
regains consciousness

1353
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,080
If I hang around here
any longer, I'll go mad

1354
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,440

1359
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,040

illumine our heart and mind"

1360
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,200

'Bless you with wealth, healthy life,
grains, cattle, children and no strife'

1366
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,920
Fine doctors you make

1367
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,920
1st throw that
wretched thing away

1368
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,080
He has his hand on his chest

1369
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,880
I'm still alive, right?

1370
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,280
Hey Parthi, call Meera

1371
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,800
I would like to talk to her

1372
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,360
Grandma, her wedding

She's getting married?

1374
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,680
Does he know that?

1375
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,880
No, grandma, will he be
lying like this if he knew?

1376
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,800
I blessed them only yesterday

1377
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,440
'You'll lead a happy and
long life together'

1378
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,200
She's getting married so soon?

1379
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,920
Sister, what's wrong with him?

1380
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,200
You get out!

1381
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,200

01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,600

meditate on you, nullify all troubles'

1389
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,400
Hey, give me a cigarette

1390
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,520
- Remove this - It won't
come off so easily

1391
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,640
You must soak it in
water for a few minutes

1392
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,840
Dai...dai! This impulsive
nature of yours-

1393
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,760
If you had been patient
for 5 minutes on that day

1394
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,840
...at least there would have
been some communication

1395
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,240
Why, is she worried now
there's no communication?

1396
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,280
No, she said she's
getting married

1397
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,240
Soooper, da Let her get married

1398
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,600
And die!

1399
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,320
Will my feelings change
if she gets married?

1400
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,280
No 'if', da The deed is done!

1401
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,840
'I am serious'

1402
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,720
'She got married
yesterday afternoon'

1403
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,720
You can't change
anything It is all over

1404
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,400
Where are you going?

1405
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,080
You prophesied like God?

1406
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,440
Everything will be fine

1407
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,320

What is this?

1411
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,880

1415
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,440
"O beloved! You tore
my soul forlorn"

1416
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,280
Adi, please

1417
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,600
Listen to me, da

1418
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,720
Shut up!

1419
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,960
We will only buy trouble
if we go there now

1420
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,880
"You trampled my love
with utter scorn"

1421
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,840
Hey, Adi...!

1422
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,440
MEERA!

1423
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
MEERA

1424
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,800
Meera, get up, I don't accept this
damn marriage, get up right now

1425
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,560
- Meera, how can you sit there?
- Listen to me

1426
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm yelling my throat hoarse
and you're sitting calm-

1427
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,920
How dare he barge in here!

1428
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,040
Throw him out Bash him up!

1429
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,320
- Meera, what are you doing?
- 'Hit him, throw him out!'

1430
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,760
'GET UP, MEERA!'

1431
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:04,360
"O love of my life You ripped
my soul to restless strife"

1432
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,360
Beat him up Kill him!

1433
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,080
He shouldn't come
here ever again

1434
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,600
- LET ME GO - Beat
him to a pulp!

1435
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,040
Please don't hit him, bro

1436
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,240
- Poor chap, please don't
- Get lost!

1437
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,840
Tell them not to beat him up Poor fellow!
He'll die, sir

1438
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,720
Sir, please ask them to stop

1439
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,760
Meera

1440
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,680
Hey!

1441
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,200
You rascals

1442
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,280
If you don't stop, I'll throw this pot
on this old man's head and kill him

1443
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,640
Stop it

1444
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,880
Come inside

1445
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,640
Come...everyone

1446
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,240
Go

1447
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,680
Adi

1448
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,280
Get up, da Let us go away

1449
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,320
Stand up

1450
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,000
Let us go away

1451
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,400
MEERA!

1452
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,800
Let's go right now

1453
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,600
- Please, da - Just listen to me

1454
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,120
Let's go please Listen to me

1455
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,880
- Please, dude - MEERAAAA!

1456
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,160
Meera, come out, please

1457
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:08,840
"O' sole soul mate in my life Why
did you leave me in strife?"

1458
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,400
"You froze in my
teardrops, my dream-wife"

1459
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,600
Parthi

1460
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,960
Is marriage

1461
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,280
...that powerful, da?

1462
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,360
Does it mean

1463
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,840
...nothing can be done?
We can't do anything?

1464
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,320
Do I have to accept she's gone?

1465
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,720
If I'm unconscious for 2 days
can she be someone else's wife?

1466
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,360
Without her consent, how do
they force her to get married?

1467
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,680
I don't understand this

1468
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,760
Tell me what I should do

1469
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,000
You created such a ruckus but
she didn't turn back even once

1470
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,360
No, da, I won't blam-

1471
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,720
Girls easily give up

1472
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,560
I am sure she wouldn't have heard
anything in all that noise

1473
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,120
Okay, da, what's your plan now?

1474
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,680
She is my Meera, da

1475
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,320
Okay come, take me to her house

1476
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,360
- Hey Adi, don't da
- Start the bike

1477
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,120
"My night and day blossom duly
with the dawn of your eyes daily"

1478
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,360
MEERA!

1479
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,480
"My stifled breath
wanders listlessly"

1480
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,960
MEERA, PLEASE JUST GET
OUT OF THAT HOUSE

1481
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,880
"What has happened
to my love sincere?"

1482
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,480
Don't spare him this time

1483
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,080
Take him to a police station or
admit him in a mental hospital

1484
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,920
"I am like the parched land here
waiting for the rains, my dear"

1485
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,280
Got a cigarette on you?

1486
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,320
- Beedi, bro?
- 'What about that tea, da?'

1487
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,600
'Coming, sir'

1488
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,160
'I told you to meet the dean
of the hospital, did you?'

1489
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,720
'Sir, we intended to-'

1490
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,400
'Get lost, lazy idiots!'

1491
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,000
Hey bro, no smoking
in the station

1492
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,640
'Yov, go and meet the
dean in the hospital'

1493
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,120
Won't you advise him?

1494
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,240
Parthi, bring him inside
through the rear entrance

1495
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,760
Come

1496
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,320
How many times will you
go there and disgrace us?

1497
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,480
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Ma, why discuss that now?

1498
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,480
You keep quiet

1499
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,640
All the wedding guests were
asking your father about you

1500
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,880
At least we could have
taken a group photo

1501
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,200
Don't be silly, ma

1502
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,200
Group photo is the
last thing in my mind

1503
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,040
Photoshop a group photo
if that's priority

1504
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,480
Siddharth, what happened because
I didn't attend your wedding?

1505
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,200
- No issues - I want
you to leave the house

1506
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,600
- I'll go after this evening get-together
- Leave now

1507
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,560
- Please, pa - Get out

1508
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,120
Get out!

1509
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,640
Listen, dea-

1510
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,480
- Pa - Hey, Sidhu

1511
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,800
- Son, ask him to come in - Pa, I
told you he isn't feeling well

1512
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,000
- Let him rest - Got
'loosies' again, huh?

1513
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,320
You are not helping one bit Is
diarrhoea the only word you know?

1514
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,840
I took some booze from
your shelf, okay?

1515
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,960
Okay, son

1516
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,280
He won't eat now
Take all this back

1517
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,960
Hello

1518
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,360
Why didn't you come?

1519
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,640
Chennai-

1520
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,520
When you come to
Chennai, come home

1521
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,400
- Yes, da - 'I got a job, da'

1522
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,320
Congrats, da

1523
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,680
Start a new life from today

1524
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,080
Did you see Meera anywhere?

1525
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,200
How will she show herself to me?

1526
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,200
I meant-

1527
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,760
You went to pick your bike

1528
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,440
No, I sent my father
to bring my bike back

1529
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,360
Okay, ask your father, if
he saw Meera by any chance?

1530
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,720
I'm in the clinic I'll
call you later, bye

1531
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:09,120
"Why did you give me
this pain, my dear?"

1532
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,280
"Strife in my life severe"

1533
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:20,320
"In this wide universe
can't find anything worse"

1534
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,960
Have you noticed this, Parthi?

1535
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,760
Meera never made eye contact with
even a single chap in college

1536
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,320
She is a beautiful girl, da

1537
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,200
But she looked at me

1538
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,320
And it started from then

1539
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:37,720
Just some

1540
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:39,880
...magic, man

1541
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,720
What did he say the other day?

1542
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,720
Our caste and our clan?

1543
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,040
Who taught all this?

1544
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,200
Where did it come from?

1545
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,320
It's cruel, man

1546
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,640
It's unfair, that's what it is!

1547
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,080
If Meera and I were together

1548
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,480
...we would have brought a
by product into this world

1549
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,920
A beautiful baby

1550
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,560
And now because of
some external factor

1551
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,840
...we both got divided and that baby
will never see the face of this earth

1552
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,000
How can there be love in
an arranged alliance?

1553
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,680
I don't buy that one bit

1554
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,640
Maybe they become hysterical after
their wedding night together

1555
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,720
Brainless idiots!

1556
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,840
Hey, it depends upon
the individual, da

1557
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,240
"Fulcrum of my life;
silver lining"

1558
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,960
"Food for the water
in my eyes brimming"

1559
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,680
"You kill me with your
love overwhelming"

1560
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,800
"Come and peep in
for awhile, dear"

1561
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,800
"I need you beside me here"

1562
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,400
"My life's breath is you"

1563
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,120
"Meaning of my life anew"

1564
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,960
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1565
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,960
"Fiery thoughts in
my mind's domain"

1566
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,600
MEERA!

1567
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:40,000
"You closed my eyes
for a second only"

1568
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,840
"I walk assuming
you're teasing me"

1569
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,040
"When I open my eyes the next second I'm
left all alone in solitude abandoned"

1570
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:58,680
"I don't want anyone
but you, dearie"

1571
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,400
"Left behind pangs of misery"

1572
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:09,360
"Strangling my breath encircled in
love's scorching flames tentacled"

1573
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,720
"I searched for
your eyes; in vain"

1574
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,080
"I wish to see you once again"

1575
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,040
"My life's breath is you"

1576
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,760
"Meaning of my world anew"

1577
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,560
"You're my memorable pain"

1578
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,280
"Fiery thoughts as fountain"

1579
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,120
'4 months have sped past
Meera has moved on'

1580
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,240
Look at you! Stuck like a
rock stagnating in your life

1581
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,840
You've told me 500 times
'Meera is married'

1582
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,840
I'll repeat it 5000
times So what now?

1583
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,760
- Parthi, come here - 'No,
I won't, you'll hit me'

1584
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,040
I won't hit you, promise

1585
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,240
Come

1586
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,000
Imagine your
girlfriend is PMSing

1587
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,520
I don't even have a girlfriend

1588
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,160
That's why I said 'imagine'!

1589
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,400
During that time

1590
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,560
'Baby, I know you'll hurt
with this pain every month'

1591
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,560
'Bear it for 4 days, it will vanish'
Will you console her like this?

1592
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,000
Or call her close to you

1593
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,480
Make her lie on your thighs

1594
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,920
Not what you think,
country bumpkin!

1595
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,120
'Thighs' is lap

1596
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,680
Your lap

1597
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,240
Rest her head on your lap
Understand what she's going through

1598
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,800
Be attentive and supportive

1599
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,720
Aren't we medical students?

1600
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,040
Will you ask her to flex her
hips and lie on one side?

1601
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:37,320
Or will you say it is your fate as a
woman and you have to go through it?

1602
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,160
Now

1603
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,640
All that is okay

1604
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,560
Why bring up my village?

1605
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,880
Junk of a jerk!

1606
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,760
- You got only that?
- Hey, I understand

1607
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,240
I get it totally

1608
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,480
When women have PMS
during their periods

1609
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,600
...you need to be treated the same
way they should be pampered, right?

1610
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,920
They have painful cramps for 4 days
You are a pain for 31 days, correct?

1611
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,880
My dear man, I can't handle your
mood swings for heaven's sake!

1612
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,240
I have work in the clinic, bye

1613
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,360
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1614
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,920
"Fiery thoughts as
my friendship vein"

1615
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,880
"My life's breath is you"

1616
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:16,760
"Meaning of my world anew"

1617
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,400
"You're my pleasurable pain"

1618
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,200
"Fiery thoughts in
my mind's domain"

1619
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:28,760
"Did distance make us distant
'cos existence got me thinking"

1620
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,960
"Now for instance,
if I insisted"

1621
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,160
"An answer for these questions"

1622
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,920
"What were you on a leash? Which
made me a stray from the street?"

1623
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,360
"Is this what they call defeat cos, baby
then this time I'll bring a...fleet!"

1624
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,120
"Why did you give me
this pain, my dear?"

1625
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,960
"Strife in my life severe"

1626
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:55,080
"In this wide universe
can't find anything worse"

1627
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,320
- Hurry up - Can't
you see I'm coming?

1628
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,760
'Sir...?'

1629
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,600
Come in, dove who spreads peace!

1630
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,000
She'll work properly
from now on, sir

1631
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,000
- Take her back, sir -
Did you see his feet?

1632
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,240
So far this aunty has
broken 10 glasses

1633
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,240
I'll pay for all
the glasses, sir

1634
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,520
Who wants your cash?

1635
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,560
What did sir say? Call
Meera by her name?

1636
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,800
But this aunty refers to her
in 3rd person just to bug him

1637
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,800
If he loses his cool, either she should
apologize or go about her work quietly

1638
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,520
Instead she keeps laughing
to annoy him further

1639
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,760
You dumbo woman!

1640
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,440
How can you call sir's wife in
3rd person disrespectfully?

1641
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,120
This, huh?

1642
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:53,200
Yov! Who will pay Rs 2000 for
the shabby work this lady does?

1643
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,200
No one, sir

1644
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,200
'And she's the leader of a gang'

1645
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,760
Whether her work is done or not

1646
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,880
...she'll call for a meeting and
tear everyone's lives threadbare

1647
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,960
Gossip with a capital G
about all the residents

1648
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,440
Pass unwanted comments about who
is coming and going in every house

1649
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,440
That management chap pours
vitriol into my ears!

1650
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,440
Protesting about sir
bringing in someone at night

1651
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,680
Why do you poke your nose
in sir's affairs, di?

1652
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,840
Even that's okay

1653
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,560
How do you look at a girl and
decide...what did you say-

1654
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,520
And call her a 'TwayOn'?

1655
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,840
You're a woman too
Don't you know?

1656
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,520
Is that how you speak or is
this what you call decorum?

1657
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,280
I'm really clueless
Kindly explain!

1658
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,600
Sir is a doctor, you moron!

1659
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,560
Will they stoop to such levels?

1660
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,280
- Moron- - If anything
happens tomorrow

1661
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,160
Who is responsible?
Who is in charge?

1662
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,640
Here afterwards

1663
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,480
I won't deride sir at all

1664
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,360
Not a word about
Meera 'madam' too

1665
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,240
I won't gossip or add eyes and
ears to a single soul downstairs

1666
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,240
I'll come work, finish
and go home diligently

1667
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,080
Come tomorrow

1668
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,320
'Thanks, sir'

1669
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,960
Hey

1670
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,200
Stinking of whiskey
Pop a mouth-freshener

1671
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,520
Why? As if I'll kiss some girl?

1672
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,840
King of comebacks!

1673
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,120
Adi, if I hadn't knocked on the door
with my 'darling, open the door' dialog

1674
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,280
...you think you would
have got your job done?

1675
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,200
- Yes - No chance, casanova

1676
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,240
I know you since you
were a toddler!

1677
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,640
Don't think you can fool-

1678
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,080
How do you know that 'darling,
open the door' story?

1679
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,040
Did I blabber when tanked?

1680
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,480
Even if you blabbered it
will only be about 'Meera'

1681
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:21,680
I was the one who referred that patient
to you, that baldie photographer

1682
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,240
Okay, tell me this

1683
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,080
How did it begin?

1684
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,440
That chap had a fracture
in his radius, right?

1685
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,720
That girl would call
the hospital daily

1686
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,960
And ask 'Can I give my fiancÃ©
chicken or veggie diet only?'

1687
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,480
24x7 nuisance

1688
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,000
Is it jaundice or what
to specify a bland diet?

1689
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,480
I gave her my phone #

1690
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,960
- Straight?
- Direct connection

1691
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,360
Who are you, man?

1692
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,920
How did you learn all this?

1693
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,720
You went to check that girl
and got your job done!

1694
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,400
Ice into your pants?

1695
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,720
Sir...shave

1696
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,960
Why is she bugging me daily saying
'shave' when she passes by?

1697
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,800
Don't take all that seriously

1698
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,400
1st come out of the mind-set you can
forget Meera with all these flings

1699
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,720
Understood?

1700
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,440
Choose a good girl
as your girlfriend

1701
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,360
Adi, are you crying?

1702
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,080
Adi...hey chee! Don't be silly

1703
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,240
Are you mad or what?
Crying like a baby?

1704
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,760
Hey, this is why you shouldn't
try what you are not good at

1705
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,120
Who are you? What charisma! Girls
will bend backwards for you

1706
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,960
If you don't believe me, strip and
stand in front of Stella Maris

1707
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,760
Girls will form queues
ABC falling all over you

1708
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,680
Shedding tears for
Meera like an idiot!

1709
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,320
1 minute, madam

1710
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,960
Don't overdo it, Lakshman

1711
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,200
Sorry, madam

1712
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,360
Is this a reputable hospital?

1713
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,480
- Looks empty?
- Not like that, madam

1714
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,680
Good hospital

1715
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,280
Sir, Priya madam has come

1716
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,400
'Heroine, sir'

1717
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,000
- MD has referred only you, sir
- Send her in

1718
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,080
Dr Adithya?

1719
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,240
VIP patient

1720
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,680
Patient

1721
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,680
I'm your fan

1722
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,480
I never miss your movies

1723
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,840
- You act so well - Thank you

1724
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,080
If you want to shoot
in our hospital

1725
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,520
'Call me anytime I'll
grant permission'

1726
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,800
'No problem'

1727
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,320
She's there

1728
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,160
To provide whatever
help you need

1729
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,640
Take good care of madam Make
sure she has no hassles

1730
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,120
- 'Yes, sir' - VIP patient

1731
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,120
Hey!!

1732
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,160
Has the water level
decreased in your brain?

1733
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,200
Don't you know the difference
between black and white?

1734
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,120
Are your sense
organs working or-?

1735
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,840
Star gazing you
forgot the procedure

1736
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,200
What is the first thing you
must do when a patient arrives?

1737
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,760
Sorry about that

1738
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,200
Tell me, what happened?

1739
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,200
She slipped while dancing
and her knee got-

1740
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,400
Knee got twisted

1741
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,480
It hurts to walk

1742
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,520
Just relax

1743
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,040
- Here?

1744
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,360

- Get a ROM knee brace

This has to be worn on bare skin
only Not on your leggings, okay?

1748
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,720
Remove it before going
to bed, alright?

1749
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,040
Okay, doctor

1750
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,920

1754
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,040

9500019010, madam

1758
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,160
Over smartness is
not good for health

1759
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,240
Watch your step!

1760
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,520
Sid?

1761
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,520
- What are you doing here?
- Show me your hand

1762
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,720
Hey! What?

1763
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,200
- Open your mouth - Let go of me

1764
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,200
Look at your teeth

1765
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,800
- How much will you drink?
- Disturbing me

1766
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:26,120
What is all this doing here?

1767
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,440
All this isn't my stuff

1768
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,040
Er...Peter's

1769
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,480
His dad paid him
a surprise visit

1770
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,360
How can you be like this? I
shouldn't have left you alon-

1771
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,880
I'm not coming

1772
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,560
- Why not?
- I'm not coming, that's it

1773
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,320
How long will you be
on this ego trip?

1774
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,680
You call this an ego trip?

1775
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,880
Adithya, listen

1776
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,600
I'll talk to dad for you

1777
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,080
I'll sort out everything

1778
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,160
Hmmm...okay?

1779
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,400
This isn't about dad

1780
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,640
I just need some space

1781
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,560
What's this obsession
with space?

1782
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,040
4 months since you left home

1783
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,400
Why bring up that topic now?

1784
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,760
Okay

1785
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,880
The bike you love Royal Enfield

1786
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,000
Interceptor will be
delivered within this week

1787
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,120
- Come home - Bribe, huh?

1788
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,760
- I'm asking you to come back home, right?
- No chance, bro

1789
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,080
I'm not going anywhere

1790
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,840
Why are you being so stubborn?

1791
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,200
Know how tough it was
to find this place?

1792
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,600
Did I ask you to go
to all this trouble?

1793
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,880
I'm fine, right?

1794
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,760
I'm not leaving without you, da

1795
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,520
Instead of talking to you-

1796
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,320
Yes, I emptied all those bottles
I smoke up and I snort drugs

1797
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,520
So what?

1798
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,440
My wish, I'll do what
I want, get lost!

1799
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,560
I'm older than you-

1800
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,320
Meeting you more than
half way and you're-

1801
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,560
Hey Sid, let me g-

1802
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:41,680
Listen to-

1803
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:45,080
- Adi, why are you doing this? Come
- I'm not coming home

1804
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,880
Hey! Adi

1805
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:51,280
How dare you hit me, huh!

1806
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,520
Then...what's news?

1807
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,000
Where was your honeymoon?

1808
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,680
Didn't go anywhere

1809
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,120
Why?

1810
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,400
You went

1811
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,600
Into exile

1812
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,280
How can I go then?

1813
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,840
Between you both, any tif-

1814
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,200
Nothing of that sort

1815
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,400
Then when will our house
hear a baby wailing?

1816
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,720
Nothing for 2 years

1817
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,000
- 'Plan after that'
- You're planning?

1818
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,040
Can all this be planned?

1819
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:22,720
It has to happen in a flow

1820
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,720
Naturally

1821
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,280
Out of...out of love you know

1822
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,040
- Good morning,
sir - 'Cut...cut'

1823
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,080
Tea or coffee?

1824
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,640
- Do you have juice?
- Yes, sir

1825
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,520
Sir, madam is busy in the shot
She'll be here in 5 minutes

1826
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,600
'Tilt up that 2K light'

1827
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,920
Sir, juice

1828
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,760
- 'Ready?
- Ready, sir'

1829
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,360
- 'Roll camera - Rolling, sir'

1830
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,400
'Action!'

1831
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,920
'Background move'

1832
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,880
Hi Adi

1833
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,760
I didn't expect you here

1834
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,120
- How is your knee?
- Much better

1835
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,120
I wear the braces
only when it pains

1836
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,200
Did you come just
to ask me this?

1837
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,320
- I came to tell you a story
- Story? Tell me

1838
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,120
When I was in college
I had a girlfriend

1839
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,040
Her name is Meera

1840
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,160
Almost a living in relationship

1841
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,440
That girl got married

1842
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,400
I tried all kinds of
stuff to forget her

1843
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,560
But...didn't work out

1844
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,120
I'm so sorry

1845
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,360
Don't want pity

1846
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,640
That's what messed me
up in the first place

1847
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,720
- Just a simple request - What?

1848
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,960
Will you help me physically?

1849
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,840
If you want I can show you
my medical certificate

1850
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,480
- What?
- Yeah!

1851
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,480
We'll keep our
relationship raw and open

1852
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,160
Friends with benefits

1853
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,440
No strings attached

1854
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,120
No questions asked

1855
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,640
Should be fantastic
What do you say?

1856
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,880
Do you want time to think?

1857
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,000
Adi...hi!

1858
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,800
Priya, my friend

1859
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,760
Lakshman

1860
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,200
Hey Adi

1861
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,480
- Parthi, sit down - You
have a surprise, da

1862
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,040
Hey! Tarun What's up, bro?

1863
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Good to see you

1864
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,320
- How are you?
- I'm good, dude

1865
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,320
- When did you come?
- This morning

1866
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,360
- What happened to your licence?
- Got cleared

1867
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,160
Congrats, bro

1868
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,240
Nice...nice Then what's up?

1869
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,040
Nothing much, Kavya's father has
started looking for a groom

1870
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:11,160
She got so tense, asked me to fly
back to India, I obeyed implicitly

1871
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,080
Is your relationship so serious?

1872
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,200
Then what?

1873
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,640
What I'm trying to say

1874
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,080
Everybody is
obsessed with caste!

1875
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,680
Take life in easy strides

1876
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,160
If it clicks, okay

1877
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,760
If not, double okay

1878
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,080
Otherwise you'll become like me

1879
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,360
You're painting yourself
to be pathetic!

1880
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:35,880
Happily hooking a
heroine here, huh?

1881
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,600
You were having a serious
chat when we interrupted you

1882
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:40,040
Shot discussion, huh?

1883
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,200
Did it get set or
work in progress?

1884
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,480
1-track mind indecent fellow

1885
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,760
I came just to chat with her

1886
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:48,960
Tarun, it seems we can see the
sun even at night from tomorrow

1887
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,720
It was announced on TV!

1888
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,720
I was talking to her about Meera

1889
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,000
I asked if she could
help me physically

1890
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,680
Physical help, huh?
What was madam's reply?

1891
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,280
Madam-

1892
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,840
I think will slowly surrender!

1893
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,560
"O' dream, in my sleep loyally
why did you haunt me royally?"

1894
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:44,840
"Till the moon sleeps in the sky's altar
why did you shower me with nectar?"

1895
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,400
"Why this flustered feeling?
My breath goes a-reeling?"

1896
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:56,400
"Why does my heart beat helplessly
when you move away from me?"

1897
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:02,200
"O' dream, in my sleep duly
why did you haunt me daily?"

1898
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:08,200
"Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours
why did you shower me with honey, I ask?"

1899
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:49,960
"You...like rain above"

1900
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,680
"Me...as land below"

1901
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:01,800
"As a garland of dewdrops fall
this flower blooms overall"

1902
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:07,440
"Like the waxing moon aglow with
bliss in the days that follow"

1903
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:13,080
"O' dream, in my sleep loyally
why did you haunt me totally?"

1904
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:18,360
"Till the moon sleeps in the sky's altar
why did you shower me with nectar?"

1905
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:23,920
"Why this flustered feeling?
My breath goes a-reeling?"

1906
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:30,120
"Why does my heart beat helplessly
when you move away from me?"

1907
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:35,800
"O' dream, in my sleep duly
why did you haunt me daily?"

1908
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,880
"Till the moon goes to bed at wee hours
why did you shower me with honey, I ask?"

1909
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,880
Hey, Parthi

1910
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,480
- Why is this girl ironing my shirt, da?
- 'Which girl?'

1911
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,080
- Priya, da - Hey!
Where are you now?

1912
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,200
My flat of course

1913
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,720
'She just woke me
up with coffee'

1914
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,680
Oh! You drank, huh?

1915
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,080
Job over?

1916
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,160
Don't think too much
Your brain may pop out

1917
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,800
'It will happen now, right?
Happy journey!'

1918
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:12,280
Hey! Listen to me seriously

1919
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,160
I read her Wikipedia page

1920
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,600
She passed out of IIT, Ahmedabad

1921
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,320
Her father is retired chief justice
of Delhi High Court it seems

1922
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,960
Got what I said?

1923
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,440
Buddy

1924
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,880
You can't get a better chance
than this Settle down with her

1925
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,000
'Dai! Shouldn't you know when
that girl irons your shirt?'

1926
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,400
I don't like someone
doing all this for me

1927
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:34,800
I should feel like doing
this of my own accord

1928
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,600
I felt that way only with Meera

1929
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,200
Hey! Back to square 1, huh?

1930
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,520
Meera is married to someone
else 'That chapter is over, da'

1931
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,680
'Why are you still reading that same
book called 'Meera'? I don't get it'

1932
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,680
'If you drink 24x7, you'll die-'

1933
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,320
What, heroine?

1934
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,120
You've lured an innocent
chap into your web, huh?

1935
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,680
If someone sees us
what will they think?

1936
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,680
Lakshman will deal with it

1937
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,680
- Ooops!
- Oh yeah!

1938
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,000
Adi

1939
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:18,240
Adi, I love you

1940
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,600
Adi...Adi

1941
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,080
- Adi, what happened?
- Madam

1942
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,600
- Adi, wait - Sit inside, madam

1943
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,240
Lakshman, get out of the way

1944
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,920
- Madam - Adi, wait

1945
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,480
- What happened?
- What 'what happened?'

1946
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:31,960
I've told you twice already

1947
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,120
Then what do you mean
by 'love' or dove?

1948
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,160
Adi, let us discuss this
inside the car please

1949
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,760
Hey! All this won't work
out for you, understand?

1950
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,720
Why do you drag love into this?

1951
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,640
Aren't you intelligent?

1952
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,760
Why you being so emotional?

1953
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,360
- Adi - Look here

1954
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,600
I won't come and meet you You
don't come looking for me

1955
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,680
I'm done with your-

1956
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,240
Really? Get this, Adithya

1957
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,440
Your life with Meera
ended right then

1958
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,200
Why can't you accept that?

1959
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,400
Lakshman, get lost!

1960
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,280
'Get this, Adithya'

1961
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,480
'Your life with Meera
ended right then'

1962
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,760
'Why can't you accept that?'

1963
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,240
'Hello, sir, I'm Tulsi
calling from the hospital'

1964
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:31,520
Tell me, Tulsi

1965
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,520
Prabhu sir case is
an emergency, sir

1966
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:36,280
Tulsi, it's my day off

1967
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,640
'I know, sir Sir...hello?'

1968
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,240
'Sir, no one else
is on call here'

1969
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,440
Tulsi!

1970
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,080
'Sir, emergency case'

1971
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,600
TULSI!

1972
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,840
I'm not in a condition to
operate on any patient, Tulsi

1973
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,360
We'll do it tomorrow

1974
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,240
Sir, please, if you want
I can give you Alpax

1975
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,400
'Really critical, sir He
has lost a lot of blood'

1976
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,880
'We will lose the patient'

1977
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,760
Follow the basics, hook the patient
on the ventilator, I'll be there now

1978
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,840
'Okay, sir'

1979
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,560
Sir, all preparations done

1980
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,800
- Deepa - Yes, sister

1981
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,040
Sir, are you okay?

1982
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,440
Tulsi, what happened here?

1983
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,120
What happened?

1984
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:50,320
This is regarding the
reputation of Orbit Hospital

1985
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:53,440
Whatever happens, I'll make sure
that man's licence is cancelled

1986
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,160
I'll go to any lengths necessary

1987
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,400
Tell your favorite doctor

1988
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,640
I'll see him in court

1989
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,440
Ma'am, if you go
straight Room # 1729

1990
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:02,960
- First room - Okay, thanks

1991
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,720
- I'll get some food, eat something
- Got a cigarette?

1992
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,120
Adithya

1993
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,520
Hello, aunty

1994
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,960
How are you, dear?

1995
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,600
Hey Parthi

1996
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,520
The body rings an alarm
bell once in our life

1997
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,440
To announce the end
of its capacity

1998
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,080
We should pay heed and
stop everything then

1999
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:22,680
Right away Period, full stop

2000
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,080
He doesn't listen to anyone, sir

2001
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,480
He has to listen, da

2002
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,040
Or he'll see Heaven!

2003
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,360
Are you still drinking?

2004
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,640
- Why?
- Yes, ma

2005
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,440
I drink daily

2006
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,720
How does that matter to you?

2007
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,960
I feel like living this way

2008
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:42,200
Just let me be

2009
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,720
Bugging me with questions
and torturing me

2010
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,200
'What kind of a
question is this?'

2011
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,400
'Is this how you handle
a sensitive issue?'

2012
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,360
'Let's face facts'

2013
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,600
'Dr Adithya Varma is
our college topper'

2014
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:56,080
'He's one of the best doctors
St Patrick's has produced'

2015
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,840
'He had some anger issues'

2016
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,160
'I accept that'

2017
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,840
'But alcoholism, drug addiction?
Who said so?'

2018
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,440
'Is it easy to become a
good qualified surgeon?'

2019
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:07,640
'What 'Indian medical Council?'

2020
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,160
'Indian medical council is
to do with doctors like us'

2021
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,160
'Why should media and
politics poke their-'

2022
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,400
Grandma, you used to keep
asking about his whereabouts

2023
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,680
Now even after you know you
don't want to visit him

2024
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,360
I don't understand why

2025
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:26,040
I can't see him in his
present condition

2026
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,040
You don't have to see him At least
you can talk over the phone?

2027
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,400
If you call him, he will
definitely come home, grandma

2028
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,920
Siddharth, if the person we love dies
that's a different feeling altogether

2029
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,720
It is different leaving us
and drifting away from us

2030
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,520
In the 1st case scenario

2031
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:45,880
Our heart and mind will get adjusted
to the fact he won't come back to life

2032
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:46,920
Like me

2033
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,920
In the 2nd case it won't
fade out that easily

2034
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,840
It's very painful

2035
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,080
Like Adithya

2036
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,160
I can extend any
help he wants but-

2037
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:00,680
Can I share his
suffering with him?

2038
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,600
So are you saying we
just abandon him?

2039
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,920
Suffering is verrry
personal, Siddharth

2040
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,920
Let him suffer

2041
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,760
Adi, Mr Anantanarayanan

2042
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:17,880
Very successful lawyer

2043
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,360
He will be handling your case

2044
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:23,120
1st of all don't keep saying 'case'
as if I committed some crime

2045
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,480
As far as I'm concerned
this isn't even my case

2046
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,360
I was called because there wasn't
any doctor on emergency call

2047
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,120
Isn't the patient alive?

2048
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,360
In cases like this patient being
dead or alive is secondary

2049
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:37,640
Primary case is a surgeon

2050
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:39,400
That is you

2051
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,160
If he has consumed alcohol
during surgery time

2052
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,920
Depending on whether it is
within permissible limit or not

2053
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,280
This can change into criminal
and medical negligence

2054
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,680
So, Adithya, tell me

2055
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,960
- What was your alcohol intake that day?
- Criminal negligence?

2056
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,840
Do you know under what circumstances
I went to the hospital on that day?

2057
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:59,480
Without motor control

2058
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,640
I could barely talk, that's all

2059
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:04,760
I sat in the chair, guided the head
nurse and performed the surgery

2060
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,480
If I hadn't done that the patient
would have died you know

2061
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,360
Medical negligence!

2062
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,440
We also heard about this

2063
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,600
We understand too

2064
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,040
Are you a surgeon?

2065
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,120
Sid, is this man on our side?

2066
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,840
- Of course - Then why
is he talking like this?

2067
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:27,240
I don't like this
interrogation tone

2068
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,680
Adithya, the case has
gone out of our hands

2069
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,840
Indian medical council
is also involved

2070
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,400
Sid, I need a better lawyer

2071
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:38,720
Hospital management is trying
to prove you're guilty

2072
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,960
As a womanizer, as
a drug addict, as-

2073
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,160
As an alcoholic womanizer
for God's sake

2074
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,680
Already this news has been splashed
in all newspapers and all TV channels

2075
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:49,160
I want your complete support
to get you out of this

2076
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,440
Adithya, can you hear me?

2077
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,480
Please, da

2078
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,320
I'll go to any extent
to help you out

2079
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,480
Please, da

2080
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,360
Show some presence of mind

2081
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,520
This is eye witness material

2082
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:10,280
All your patients have endorsed

2083
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,440
Saying that you're a
wonderful surgeon

2084
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:15,040
There are totally
484 radiographs

2085
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,600
Your total number of
working days is 214

2086
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,000
Your total count
of surgery is 486

2087
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,240
2 are unavailable

2088
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,360
Out of station

2089
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,480
But in your hospital log book

2090
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,840
...number of surgeries entered
is only 300 on the whole

2091
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:36,080
Even if log books can be
manipulated radiographs won't lie

2092
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,400
Because in every
single radiograph

2093
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,160
'Referred by Dr Adithya Varma'

2094
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,640
Your name has been embossed

2095
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,200
I can give the back-up also

2096
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,960
Plus in your favor is

2097
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,560
...the patient is still alive

2098
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,160
If we grease some palms we can
manage to cover up, it's easy

2099
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,760
Want to know the minus?

2100
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:59,400
Hospital management has
collected your blood sample

2101
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,160
Alcohol level shows
140+ in that test

2102
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,120
And you are high on cocaine

2103
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,600
- What shall we do now?
- Good question

2104
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,440
A preservative is added
in that blood test

2105
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:20,400
Only due to variation in
the fermentation level

2106
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:23,640
...we can make the blood test invalid
claiming the results were wrong

2107
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:28,760
But most importantly, 184 surgeries
haven't been entered in the log book

2108
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,880
if I mention this in
court that's enough

2109
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,520
Hospital management
will plead guilty

2110
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,960
Adithya, very simple

2111
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:37,960
Go in for a neat shave

2112
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,240
Wear crisply ironed
pant and shirt

2113
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,520
Come with a calm demeanor

2114
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,160
Whatever you say that day
repeat that verbatim

2115
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:46,560
Constantly

2116
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:47,720
That's all

2117
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,760
Okay, Siddharth I'll leave

2118
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,000
Okay? Bye

2119
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,320
I'm coming, sir

2120
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,240
This case is as good as won

2121
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,920
But my only worry

2122
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,680
Your brother's
unconventional mind-set

2123
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:13,440
Siddarth, this kind of free spiritedness
won't work in our democracy

2124
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,920
You have to deal with it

2125
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:18,840
Irrespective of how much
you pay to manage this

2126
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,800
...don't let it
show on your face

2127
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,120
- Okay? Right - Thank you

2128
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:50,160
No time, da

2129
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,200
Adi

2130
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:58,280
Adi...?

2131
02:06:58,680 --> 02:06:59,640
Adi?

2132
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,440
Where is he?

2133
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,240
- Hey Parthi - Hey!

2134
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:06,840
- Hey Adi - Lift him up

2135
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:10,240
Be careful, da

2136
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,200
Go this side

2137
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,240
Watch your step Careful!

2138
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,160
Make him sit in the chair

2139
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,640
Gently Look here

2140
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,880
- Adi - Wait

2141
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:21,040
How could he?

2142
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,440
Dai! Adi

2143
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,840
Hey...hey Adi!

2144
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:26,880
Why, da?

2145
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,080
I'll be back

2146
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:29,160
Wait

2147
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,920
'Parthi!'

2148
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,680
Everything is over, Tarun

2149
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,800
What are you doing, da?

2150
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:42,520
- Wait, da?
- Why do you need this now?

2151
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,920
Shut up, da

2152
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:47,840
I don't know how

2153
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,640
Hey! Adi...Adi

2154
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:52,760
Get up

2155
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,480
Adi...dai! Look at me

2156
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,800
Come, sit up

2157
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,040
Go on...do it

2158
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,760
Snort, da

2159
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,040
Careful

2160
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,960
Hey...hold him

2161
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:01,000
'How is he now?'

2162
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,240
Crystal clear!

2163
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:06,120
Your brother has arranged an in-house
court hearing with great difficulty

2164
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:08,680
Please try to be normal

2165
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:13,040
Are you teaching me how to be
normal after intake of alcohol, da?

2166
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,280
Hey...dai!

2167
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:16,920
1st wear your pants, da

2168
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,520
Madam, he has a drinking problem

2169
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,200
The nurses in the hospital have
served him liquor out of sheer fear

2170
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:31,160
In fact we found drugs in
the surgeons' dressing room

2171
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,760
He behaves rudely with everyone

2172
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,040
I got to know all
this rather late

2173
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:39,840
But the toxicology report
gives him a clean chit

2174
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,400
Present your proof

2175
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:44,280
Court won't accept this
kind of emotional statement

2176
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,120
We have got 300 recorded videos
as testimonials from patients

2177
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:51,520
And a written document from the dean of
St Patrick's Medical College, Mangalore

2178
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,960
'Explaining his sincerity
and efficiency'

2179
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,200
Parthi

2180
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,400
Convocation was held, right?

2181
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,640
Do you remember the oath?

2182
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:04,480
Hey! Case is going in your favor

2183
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:05,720
Don't mess it up

2184
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:07,520
Wrong, da

2185
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,480
Give me the proof and
statement of the accused

2186
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,800
Ma'am

2187
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,120
Hey Sid...Siddharth

2188
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:16,480
What is happening?

2189
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,480
How much did you pay?

2190
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,640
Dai...dai...dai!

2191
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,920
Look at appa

2192
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,080
Dad doesn't like all this

2193
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,520
What are you doing now?

2194
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,400
Will you shut up now?

2195
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,120
My profession is the only
thing I like about myself, da

2196
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,520
Please, da Listen to me

2197
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,680
How can I function as a doctor if
we win a case by greasing palms?

2198
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:42,960
Shut up, da

2199
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,480
I can't...I can't

2200
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:46,240
I can't do that

2201
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,760
I'll be living a lie

2202
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,000
Don't mess it up
Please listen to me

2203
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:52,040
Pleeeease!

2204
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,600
If I go to jail now

2205
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,080
Will your dignity
lessen somehow?

2206
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,440
- Tell me - Just keep quiet

2207
02:10:58,480 --> 02:10:59,560
Isn't that how you feel?

2208
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:01,280
Please stay quiet

2209
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,360
Siddharth, please please

2210
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:03,600
- Try to underst- - Silence!

2211
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:06,880
Dr Adithya Varma

2212
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:10,840
If you say anything now, it will be
admissible for criminal proceedings

2213
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,320
'Do you understand that?'

2214
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,120
Nodding isn't good enough

2215
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,120
- You have to say it
- Yes, I understand

2216
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,160
Tell me the time you
attended surgery

2217
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:21,960
I don't remember

2218
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,760
What is the case you
were treating that day?

2219
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,120
Can you explain in detail?

2220
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,400
Road traffic accident case

2221
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:29,680
Multiple fractures

2222
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,840
Patient was diabetic

2223
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,680
Long history of asthma

2224
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:40,560
Patient's name Shankar

2225
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,680
Age 58

2226
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:45,720
Good

2227
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:49,600
The opposition claims you
weren't even conscious

2228
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,320
And in a state of half consciousness
you instructed the head nurse

2229
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:55,720
Stabilized the patient and
conducted the surgery

2230
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,720
Is that correct?

2231
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:00,480
Yes

2232
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,960
Now tell me, Dr Adithya

2233
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,960
Were you intoxicated on that
day before the surgery?

2234
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,560
Had you consumed alcohol?

2235
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:10,800
Or any other form
of substance abuse?

2236
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:17,400
Just say no

2237
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:18,840
I'll repeat the question

2238
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,240
'Were you in any way
intoxicated...'

2239
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:22,440
'...or on drugs'

2240
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,640
'1 day before the surgery?'

2241
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:28,680
Deny it, Adi

2242
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,520
Please, da

2243
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,200
YES!

2244
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,040
Were you drunk on the
day of the surgery?

2245
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,480
Yes, I was drunk

2246
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,240
And the day before too

2247
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,840
I have always been drunk for all
the operations I've performed

2248
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:56,600
Even now

2249
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:00,920
I've come here drunk

2250
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:04,760
Yes, I'm an alcoholic

2251
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,720
I have a drinking problem

2252
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,040
Adi

2253
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:12,560
But no patient of mine has been harmed
before this because of my inebriated state

2254
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:15,640
And I am proud to say it

2255
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,520
And I am good at what
I do Goddamn it!

2256
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:26,840
I have ruined the trust
patients place on doctors

2257
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,240
I...I do not deserve
to be a doctor

2258
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:37,440
It is in no way connected
with my hospital

2259
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:39,400
Please make that clear

2260
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,280
I think there is
nothing more to say

2261
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,720
Your license will be
seized for minimum 5 years

2262
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,200
If you try to practice
during this time frame

2263
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,920
'You will be put behind bars'

2264
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,120
'For 3 years'

2265
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,360
Appa, I'm sorry

2266
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:08,720
Sid, I'm sorry, da

2267
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:12,440
Section 269 of the
Indian Penal Code

2268
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,640
Causing hurt by act

2269
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,120
'Endangering lives'

2270
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:17,200
'Or personal safety of others'

2271
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:20,840
'Whoever causes hurt to any person by
doing act so rashly or negligently'

2272
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,120
After all this, you didn't
want to listen to us?

2273
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:27,000
'Has to endanger human life for
the personal safety of others'

2274
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:30,240
'Shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description'

2275
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,920
'...for a term which
may extend to 3 years'

2276
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,800
'Or with fine which may extend
to 500 rupees or with both'

2277
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:03,960
Come, Meera

2278
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,360
Why have you started
smoking 'beedi' now?

2279
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,600
It gives me a kick

2280
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:46,720
What happened to all
the stuff at home?

2281
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:48,320
You sold them and drank
with that money?

2282
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:51,120
I sold all that so you can have money
for your grandpa's funeral rites

2283
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,040
Hey! It hurts

2284
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,040
Why don't you ask me
if you need money?

2285
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:58,720
Parthi, put that cash back

2286
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:00,720
How often I've
borrowed from you?

2287
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:02,920
Adjust this for the lunch
I ate at your place

2288
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,560
Chee! Don't act too
smart Here, take it

2289
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,640
What the eff...get out!

2290
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:39,160
'Hello? Mister! He
seems to be missing?'

2291
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:43,000
Where's my air conditioner?

2292
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,280
'Fridge is missing
The furniture here-'

2293
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:48,720
Where is all my stuff?

2294
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,440
Hello! What is happening here?

2295
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,640
1st vacate this place
I'll call the police

2296
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:54,720
Get out!

2297
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:59,280
I'll show you a place, bro
Stay here just for the night

2298
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:00,680
Okay?

2299
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:04,160
Bro, lie down here
This is my place

2300
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,360
No one will dare breathe a word

2301
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:08,600
'I'll get you the perfect
house in the morning'

2302
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:10,040
'Okay?'

2303
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,960
- What, bro?
- Your friend isn't here

2304
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,600
- He has vacated
- Where did he go?

2305
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:26,800
I don't know, sir

2306
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:29,280
'Free public Toilet'

2307
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,040
Bro, walking off without paying?

2308
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:35,600
Oldie! Whom are you asking for money?
Write it down in my account

2309
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:37,280
Bad enough you are
a freebie yourself

2310
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,280
'2 cups tea'

2311
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,680
2 more days, bro

2312
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:53,320
You'll get a house

2313
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:57,040
Why do you worry, bro?
I'm there for you

2314
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,680
We are a team, bro

2315
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,960
"I can see in my mind with delight
a future so rosy and bright"

2316
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,680
'Will we get our tea today?'

2317
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,480
Dai! What are you doing here?

2318
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,600
I've been roaming the roads
like a dog looking for you

2319
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:12,320
- Hi bro - Hey! Move

2320
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:14,080
- Move out - Okay, bro

2321
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:18,560
Dude, your grandma passed away

2322
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:40,320
Totally unexpected

2323
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,280
Adithya

2324
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,960
- Sit down - No, it's okay

2325
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,120
Where is appa, ma?

2326
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,520
He's over there

2327
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,640
Appa

2328
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,080
Why are you sitting
here all by yourself?

2329
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:31,960
Appa

2330
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:37,160
Appa, I can understand
how you must be feeling

2331
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:42,000
I know you will be the most
affected by grandma's demise

2332
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:54,400
We led our lives without even
thinking such a day will dawn, right?

2333
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:58,320
Life is so funny, pa

2334
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,880
Appa

2335
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:04,960
In our life

2336
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:06,920
To be born

2337
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:10,200
To shower unconditional love

2338
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,680
To be born again and die

2339
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:14,360
All this is just 10%, pa

2340
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,720
Important moments

2341
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,960
Balance 90%

2342
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:21,680
Mere reactions to this

2343
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,920
Appa, in your life this
is an important moment

2344
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,240
Please get up, pa

2345
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,480
So many people are waiting
to meet you, come, pa

2346
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:36,000
Let us go in, pa

2347
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,520
Get up, pa Please
don't be like this

2348
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,720
Come, let us go inside

2349
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:43,680
Come with me

2350
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:46,280
It's okay, pa

2351
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,600
Come

2352
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:17,000
"Take me in your arms, dear"

2353
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,840
Pattima's favorite song

2354
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:22,680
Move aside

2355
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,480
Move aside Careful of the body

2356
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,760
Who called her a 'body', huh?

2357
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:31,280
Adi, don't get hyper

2358
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,480
"Take me in your
arms, love of mine"

2359
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:48,160
"Who knows if this night sublime if we
will ever share again this lifetime"

2360
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:56,680
"In this life again we may
or may not meet someday"

2361
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,160
Give it to me

2362
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,440
Ages since I took a puff Last
was when I was in college

2363
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:11,560
Here you go

2364
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:12,600
No need, pa

2365
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:16,960
Adithya

2366
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,000
This is a famous English proverb

2367
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:20,880
It's not the goodbyes that hurt

2368
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,560
But the flashbacks that follow

2369
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:25,360
It may seem very simple to you

2370
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,800
But there's a world of
truth embedded in it

2371
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,960
I think the time has come
for you to understand it

2372
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:35,920
Appa, I'm-

2373
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,240
Sorry

2374
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,760
From today I'll give
up all my bad habits

2375
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,720
It's okay, Adithya I understand

2376
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,040
Why don't you take a break?

2377
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,640
I think you deserve it

2378
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:52,360
Come back

2379
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,560
We can start afresh

2380
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,320
What are you thinking?

2381
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:00,280
There's plenty more
to see in life

2382
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:02,520
Don't waste time
stagnating like this

2383
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:13,480
Bro, make an U turn

2384
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:01,200
"In a life without anyone"

2385
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:07,040
"I yearned for you alone"

2386
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:12,400
"In the shower of love
till end of time"

2387
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:18,040
"I slept in the warmth
of your lap divine"

2388
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:25,800
"You are drifting away from me my
soul shatters to shards totally"

2389
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:33,320
"I try to string myself again
with the remaining dust in vain"

2390
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:37,800
"Not carrying her glances in
my mindâs eye as nuances"

2391
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:42,280
"Dawn of such a day
is not too far away"

2392
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:46,760
"It seems ultimate
in a few seconds"

2393
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:52,280
"Death as a boon that beckons"

2394
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:57,240
"In the depths you
disappeared into"

2395
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:01,720
"I try to hide to find you"

2396
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:10,360
"I melt in the
orphaned wind anew"

2397
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:19,680
"I save my tears
for you exclusive"

2398
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,560
"My miracle pool elusive"

2399
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:08,680
"I understand now the anomaly of a
fish not thirsty living in the sea"

2400
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:13,200
"To a no man's island
I'm travelling"

2401
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:17,600
"As an insignificant
dot Iâm shrivelling"

2402
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:26,680
"How will I bear the burden burning of
fireâs footprint on a beetleâs wing?"

2403
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:35,880
"Where can I buy an unscarred heart
without you in my life, sweetheart?"

2404
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:45,040
"I save my tears
for you special"

2405
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:48,640
"My magic pool essential"

2406
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,800
You're here in Europe Didn't
think of even calling me?

2407
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:09,760
I stay just 2 hours from here

2408
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:13,840
You don't pick my calls either

2409
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,840
Fine, forget that

2410
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,920
What are you doing here?

2411
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:21,920
Hey Tarun

2412
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:28,280
When I was coming
here I saw Meera, da

2413
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:32,160
8 months pregnant

2414
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,400
So...?

2415
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,400
She isn't happy

2416
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:39,760
I can see that clearly

2417
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:43,320
Fine, she was forced
into a marriage

2418
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:44,400
Okay

2419
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:45,960
This pregnancy?

2420
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:48,640
- So what?
- Whaaat?

2421
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,280
Hey!

2422
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,000
She's my girl, man

2423
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:54,600
Same girl

2424
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,680
Same Meera

2425
02:28:58,120 --> 02:29:01,400
She's married and pregnant
As if anything will change?

2426
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:04,080
Adi, are you aware of
what you're saying?

2427
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:06,680
I'm going back to
Chennai tonight

2428
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,560
I wasn't in my senses that day

2429
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:11,000
I screwed it up

2430
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:14,000
Now with all my senses intact

2431
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:16,600
Let me tell you now

2432
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:18,440
She is my baby

2433
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,160
She should be only with me

2434
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,520
No one can prevent that

2435
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:03,320
9 months since Meera got married

2436
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:04,960
She is someone else's wife

2437
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,320
Watch your tongue Speak decently

2438
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:08,360
Don't go back to your
old style, okay?

2439
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,160
If you mess it up

2440
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:14,880
...those people exercising will bend your
body into multiple folds, understand?

2441
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:18,360
Meera, da

2442
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,480
Meera

2443
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:26,040
I want to talk to you

2444
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:29,040
Meera

2445
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:31,240
Please just a minute, Meera

2446
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,520
Baby, I know you're angry with-

2447
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,000
Baby, please

2448
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,720
Baby, look at me at least once

2449
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:01,760
Give me some water

2450
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,080
Here

2451
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,880
Meera

2452
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,240
Meera, please

2453
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:18,400
Baby, why you're ignoring me?

2454
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:21,080
Okay, you don't talk At least
listen to what I have to say

2455
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:22,520
Why should I?

2456
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,320
I spoke so much that day
Did you listen to me?

2457
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:28,520
Why should I listen now?
Go...just go

2458
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,320
I didn't come to walk away

2459
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,800
I'm here to take you back, come

2460
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:34,200
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

2461
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,320
- Baby, please -
Please just stay away

2462
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:43,000
Baby, what is all this?

2463
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,640
Both of us are not happy

2464
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:48,000
Come with me please

2465
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:50,600
Who are you to
decide I'm unhappy?

2466
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:54,160
Baby, if both of us are far away
we won't be happy, I know that

2467
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,800
I am fine, nothing wrong

2468
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:58,960
'I curse you to get married
to a Tulu guy now'

2469
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,360
Didn't you curse me?

2470
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:01,840
Thanks a ton

2471
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:04,440
Your words came true

2472
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:06,040
You must be happy now?

2473
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,240
Leave now

2474
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:08,520
Go

2475
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:12,120
Baby, don't keep shooing me
away Come, let us go home

2476
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:15,400
On that fateful day
the time you gave me

2477
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:17,200
Was just 6 hours, right?

2478
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:19,880
You abandoned me
and left, right?

2479
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,000
In that 6 hours my
whole life collapsed

2480
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:28,000
There are restrictions for
a girl in her house, Adi

2481
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,000
You don't have sisters, right?

2482
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:31,760
How will you understand?

2483
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:36,600
Crossing many hurdles

2484
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,520
I came home to you that night

2485
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:41,680
I couldn't meet you

2486
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,400
I bore all that

2487
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,600
Because I knew you would come

2488
02:32:45,640 --> 02:32:47,000
But when did you come?

2489
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,840
After the ceremony

2490
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,040
2 days later

2491
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,680
What were you doing till then?

2492
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,880
Just

2493
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:56,440
You forgot?

2494
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:59,440
I swear he didn't know
you came over that night

2495
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:02,600
When you didn't call, like a psycho he
started injecting morphine to himself

2496
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,480
Became an overdose

2497
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,360
It was a hopeless
situation for him

2498
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:09,680
'Just missed, otherwise he
would have gone once for all'

2499
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:11,760
'He regained consciousness
after 48 hours'

2500
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:14,400
'By then your wedding and his
brother's wedding...over'

2501
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:18,480
'When he got up, moment he knew you were
getting married, he was at your doorstep'

2502
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:20,520
'His father threw him
out of the house'

2503
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:22,600
He attended hospital daily
staying all by himself

2504
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:25,800
His grandma died some time back

2505
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:27,680
'You wouldn't have
known all this'

2506
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:31,520
I came all that way, Meera

2507
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,080
But you didn't even look at me

2508
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,320
How far?

2509
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,520
Was that the Himalayas?

2510
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,400
Boat club to Adyar, that's all?

2511
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:45,200
Why should I see you?

2512
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,880
Why did you come now?
To get bashed up again?

2513
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,760
Please don't remind
me of all that

2514
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:50,920
Baby, please

2515
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:52,800
Calm down

2516
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,040
Okay, I won't come
again to meet you

2517
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:01,800
But just answer this
1 question of mine

2518
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:03,440
Go ahead

2519
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:06,240
What is stopping you from
coming away with me?

2520
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,520
This, right?

2521
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:10,680
This?

2522
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,160
- Meera, this is just flesh and blood to me
- Oh! Really?

2523
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,560
Meera, trust me

2524
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,120
I'll handle this I'll take care

2525
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,080
This society, our
families, our friends

2526
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:24,160
Eff all of them

2527
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:28,280
Meera, don't think too
much Come with me

2528
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:29,720
Okay

2529
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,960
I'll come with you

2530
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:33,800
When the baby is born?

2531
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:36,040
Whom do I show as the dad?

2532
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:37,320
Point at me

2533
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,280
Sounds good to hear

2534
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:41,960
But I don't intend
falling for it

2535
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:44,360
You have your heroine

2536
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,920
You have booze to forget
the people who love you

2537
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:51,320
Plus totally into drugs, right?

2538
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,600
- You can go - 'No, Meera,
he has given up all that'

2539
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:55,640
Parthi

2540
02:34:58,520 --> 02:35:00,640
No one is more important
to me than you, Meera

2541
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:03,960
I'll talk to your
husband if you want

2542
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,640
I can go right now
and talk to him

2543
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,520
Just say 'yes', please

2544
02:35:07,560 --> 02:35:08,600
Come here

2545
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:12,520
Sit down

2546
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,680
Come closer

2547
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:30,360
Baby, how did you survive
without me all these days?

2548
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,320
Tell me

2549
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,440
I came away the 3rd day
after I was married

2550
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,920
But to think I should
go back to you

2551
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:43,880
It didn't occur to me at all

2552
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,320
I was so angry with you

2553
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:50,400
I didn't go back to
my parents either

2554
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,520
I stayed in a hostel nearby

2555
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:55,960
I'm working in a clinic

2556
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:58,240
My anger dissipated
after a while

2557
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:01,120
I thought I'll get back to you

2558
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:04,440
But only then my
periods got delayed

2559
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:09,440
I found out I was pregnant

2560
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:14,880
After that I didn't want
to reconcile with you

2561
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:18,320
After some time I thought
I'll come back to you

2562
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:21,640
But at that time I saw
your name in the paper

2563
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:24,080
...linked with that heroine

2564
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,440
I read that news

2565
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,440
I was so terribly upset

2566
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:30,160
Some day

2567
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:33,600
Some day or the other
you'll come in search of me

2568
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:36,640
This firm belief was implanted
in a corner of my mind

2569
02:36:36,680 --> 02:36:39,400
So I was waiting

2570
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:41,720
Adithya

2571
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:45,120
I didn't let my husband touch
even my little finger!

2572
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,520
Not even my used clothes

2573
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:51,200
Adi, this is not
just flesh and blood

2574
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:54,640
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to tell you

2575
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,480
This is your baby

2576
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:01,840
Yes, Adi

2577
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:03,960
"O beloved!"

2578
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:07,480
Do you know how many
times I thought?

2579
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:09,640
I should tell you this

2580
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:15,200
Till now I never felt like
confiding in anyone about this

2581
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,640
I wanted to tell you first, Adi

2582
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,760
Tell me

2583
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:21,320
I'm pregnant

2584
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:23,400
You'll be a father soon

2585
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:24,880
We are pregnant

2586
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,280
We'll be parents soon

2587
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:29,040
Adi

2588
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:39,000
Do you know how furious
I was with you?

2589
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:42,960
But my anger that
brewed for 9 months

2590
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,640
Vanished into thin air
in just 9 minutes!

2591
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:48,960
That's okay

2592
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,840
It's okay

2593
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:58,240
Marry me

2594
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,720
Today Right now

2595
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:03,640
At this very moment

2596
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:13,680
"You cascaded one
day into my heart"

2597
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:14,840
Come

2598
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:19,480
"I knitted you in my
atrium never to part"

2599
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,200
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by seth and krish

2600
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:27,080
"You melted in my
eyes ever so rapid"

2601
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:33,160
"I enclosed you, I did
with love, with my eyelid"

2602
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:36,520
"Blessed by the arrow of Cupid"

2603
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:39,680
"Tell me now your
reason, my love"

2604
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:45,880
"Why did you abandon me thus
letting miles come between us?"

2605
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,040
"Wait, my dear fellow"

2606
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:54,080
"Let me bask in the
warmth of your love"

2607
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:59,080
"You danced one day
into my heart"

2608
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,360
"I knitted you in my
atrium never to part"

2609
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:07,720
"A part of me, my sweetheart"

2610
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:15,240
"I searched for the life I lost; agitated
Even when you were there; I vegetated"

2611
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:19,400
Mistake is all mine

2612
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,960
Only now I understood the love
you both share is so pure

2613
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,560
"Let your nights and my dream
unite in our life's love-stream"

2614
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,960
"Let the bliss of
living with you"

2615
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,120
Forgive me, dear

2616
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:34,240
"Till the end of time continue"

2617
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:38,600
"Darkness has dissolved out of sight
A new light has blossomed bright"

2618
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,840
"I find more meaning now for
my heart to race faster, love"

2619
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:47,040
"Did I liquefy in your love's melody?
Or breaking in our mutual rhapsody?"

2620
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:51,160
"Do I melt and dissolve in
the embrace of your love?"

2621
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:55,160
"If I will merge
into you once again"

2622
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:59,280
"I don't mind separation
and the pain"

2623
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:03,520
"My only beloved
always to be loved"

2624
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,080
"If I had to leave
you once again"

2625
02:40:08,120 --> 02:40:12,640
"I'll die this very
second, I'm certain"

2626
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:15,400
"In front of you, my beau"

2627
02:40:17,480 --> 02:40:25,160
"Enough, love so true
This bond will do"

2628
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:31,200
"My soul will live for
100 births I'm sure"

2629
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:33,920
"Live life as a
joyful adventure"

2630
02:40:33,960 --> 02:40:35,760
"My sole soul mate forever"
