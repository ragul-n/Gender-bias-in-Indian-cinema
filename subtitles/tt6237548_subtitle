1
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:10,566
JK

2
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,875
If I commit a crime, there is no evidence

3
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:17,219
The commission is loose
I've been giving my witness to the commissioner

4
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:18,568
It was a mistake

5
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,095
Ugly mistake

6
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:33,294
I do not like his personality

7
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:42,341
how's that?

8
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:43,997
Great, right?

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,980


10
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:51,936
Tell

11
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:53,308
how's that?

12
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:58,886
Was it upset?

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,743
That's the evidence

14
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:05,397
call Antony
tell him to come to guest house

15
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:17,376
Antony,welcome

16
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,091
Drink coffee

17
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:28,418
What's next? What's JK?

18
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,584
What do you do with the pictures on paper?

19
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,537
This is what is reserved
1000

20
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:39,893
And what is the reservation?
1000

21
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:42,223
Thousands are thrown to 1000
It's worth JK

22
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,104
absolutely right

23
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,325
God is in the picture
Even in the Devalaya, God is God

24
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:50,515
It's just the same thing

25
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,792
Even if it's soft. Tælunat

26
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,698
Money is money
The value does not change

27
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:59,207
Great, JK, this is it
I do not know what the government is saying

28
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,720
Do not get it, JK
Have you seen the news of November 8 in the night?

29
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,416
Talk about money

30
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,059
What's JK's story?
Old money

31
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:12,531
I took old money from every bank
New money

32
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:18,081
For the new money of the banks
People are turning around the banks

33
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:22,490
RBA sends out new money and sends it to the banks

34
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:30,023
According to our information
At that time, you will be bringing 25 crores down the road

35
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:34,980


36
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,046

00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:48,914


120
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:50,873
What happened?
see

121
00:03:52,303 --> 00:04:04,303
Induction of the Zoom header section

122
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,266
JK Anthony talks

123
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:26,132
There are about 25 billion in your plan
Then you come to our right and come to our guest house

124
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:31,076
Go to the left, go to the right,
Next I'm not a driver

125
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:33,157
Æntōnī

126
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:36,664
You're the planner
That's what I did

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,799
This time instead of a part
He loved everything

128
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:45,903
Anthony does a wrong

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,745
Our trade is JK

130
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,548
Goodbye forever

131
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:57,527
This is JK's pride
Grieved

132
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:28,648
Everybody a Happy Year

133
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,561
But I do not have a year

134
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,014
Still not understood?

135
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,465
Come on
I'll tell my story

136
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,247
Oh, Lucky

137
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:49,891
The pizza here on the ground
Your bed with your burger is over

138
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,218
And what about the sleeping pills?

139
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,923
Without expensive cyanide

140
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,384
And Billetts's
I got as much brain

141
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:00,437
What will you die?

142
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:05,835
I do not care for anyone else
At least not even my father counts

143
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,397
Last slide

144
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:14,985
Excuse me, Mom

145
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:30,454
Who are you?

146
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,061
If a thief comes in, a thief can tell

147
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:36,330
If you get involved in a police operation, you will be charged with a criminal

148
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,757
The prisoner says that if he sucks at the court

149
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:40,978
Just a thief

150
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,617
I came to steal your room

151
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,429
Steal this into Lucky's room
It's come to me

152
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,259
What's your name? Pulhihar sir (Indian food name)
Pulihōrda?

153
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:54,492
What name is that?

154
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:59,449
For the first time, Pulihor in the temple was steal
From then on, everyone is called Pulchhor

155
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:01,880
But why come here to steal

156
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,559
Look there

157
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,398
Hooded
There's nothing to open here

158
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,851
Do not you believe?
Come on, show the refrigerator

159
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:11,618
Come on
 - see

160
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,540
see

161
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,270
You see?

162
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:15,443
Apple does not even pile

163
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:19,515
The apple was lost in the refrigerator
You have an Apple phone in your pocket

164
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,611
Did you think that?
You're smart.

165
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,422
It's definitely a smartphone
Use

166
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,220
see
Nokia

167
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:29,966
1100

168
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,895
You were born when you were born

169
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,934
Used in the gums too
Do you know how much money this is?

170
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,179
-12 million

171
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:40,657
When will I buy the money?
Airtel's waiting

172
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,612
-12?
Why did you feel sad?

173
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:46,569
A thief is listening to someone
No, no, sir. Sir

174
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,069
But to steal you did not get anything
It feels sad

175
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:54,363
By the time I decide to die
You interrupted me

176
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,532
A suicide?

177
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,644
Yes
 - Brother .....

178
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,027
I like spirits very well

179
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,406
If you do not say why you die

180
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:06,050
You will be a cause for my death
Tell the brother. Brother .....

181
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,735
You have a lot of urgency than the media

182
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,198
Whoever does not die
Final will is done

183
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,365
All right, before I die
I will fulfill the will

184
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,935
Let's go
 - I'll tell you why

185
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:19,382
No one in this world
I have a hope

186
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,699
What is that hope?
I have a hope

187
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:22,628
Tell your brother?

188
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,744
Someday, my dad is my name
I'm eager to talk

189
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,334
From my birthday, my dad
I did not call it the name. Why?

190
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,965
Father is his son's name
Do not talk?

191
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:33,936
The conceal is good

192
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,553
That day was the birthday of Luke

193
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,752
The golden son

194
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,464
Brother ....
195
<br> 00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,737
Get out of here

195
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,830
Marriage, we've been hearing a case for years

196
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:00,107
You win the carnival

197
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:04,491
is it?
The owner of the paddy mill

198
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,823
Good thing?
You're lucky, mommy

199
00:10:05,993 --> 00:10:09,023
Lucky not your brother-in-law
My son. Yeah yeah

Our rice mill was insured with hundreds of thousands
Passing. is it?

207

Do you still believe now?
My son is lucky. Yeah yeah

The money your son gave
Put a fixed deposit with your own name

00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,911
It's my dad

The bank is a permanent deposit to Lucky
Brought bankrupt

216
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:55,469
Did you hear that?
 - you

217
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,764
What is your son's name?

218
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:01,266
What is your son's name?
My dad went out

219
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,378
After all, it's because of everything else

220
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,478
Call me my name
Stopped

221
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,084
Do you really do
Anlakīda?

222
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,150
It's not even good on Google
Questions, man?

223
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,626
My mother was fortunate

224
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,569
My dad is worried
Check it out

225
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:24,305
If you change your name
That's what I did

226
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,438
Go find the guy you got there
What happened?

227
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,577
Their house was raided by the police

228
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,781
What about these little things?

229
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:32,780
Will the root die for the Epizode?

230
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,506
Another story is my horos ...

231
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,626
Actually, my life was
Do you know

232
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,846
Great car

233
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,677
Good tea?
Tea, do not give up your set

234
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:53,828
Why?

235
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,917
The day you gave to Amherst
Look at your house

236
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,105
Our truthful men
What do you know?

237
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,631
Catchers are more dangerous than tea
So nowadays tea stops

238
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:08,994
Stop coming in too

239
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,172
Why are you coming to say so clearly?

240
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:17,040
This is him. Ahery father
I look like an idiot

241
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:22,033
E-paper. Hello, I'm taking the paper

242
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,759
Give me a sweet tea. Right
Not here

243
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,917
The corner is better. No, it's ok
No, no

244
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:33,160
There is a watchman

245
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:45,150
Cricket even though it was cricket
It's not good to be right before the front

246
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:47,401
It's not my situation

247
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,898
What else are you doing?
There's another .....

248
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:58,888
Keep your costs
251
<br> 00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:08,092
Let others serve us for wheelchairs
We do not do anybody's salute

249
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:10,410
All we need is the Indian flag

250
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,984
I will not do this job
Do not you?

251
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,029
Do not you do a job?

252
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:15,928
you

253
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,391
You do not have the brain?

254
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,900
Telling a responsible person
These are the men who do not have a job ...

255
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,455
Girls who do not care
This society does not accept

256
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:53,417
So, think positively,
Be positive

257
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:54,257
Got it?

258
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:56,883
There's a tire in the tires
You should have a fire

259
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,930
Do not wait for the sauce
Meet like a gentleman

260
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,684
Do not see her at the bar
See it

261
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,202
Know one of the last
T. It's addictive

262
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,158
Those who are familiar with cigarettes

263
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,393
I did not have a past

264
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,922
So be positive

265
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,843
Not for me either
I have to work for this positive person

266
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,526
Let's see a job

267
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,826
Cooney Solution
Requires a support manager

268
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:38,947
This is suspicious danus

269
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,942
Am I really alive when I was born?
Doctor doubts that he is not

270
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,660
He's not a doctor
He's a contractor

271
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,567
Where did you work before?
ICICI

272
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,188
Why is that why?

273
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,935
You're robbing money
Was it removed? or

274
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,436
With nothing with Boss. Sir
Such a suspicion

275
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,759
Everything is suspicious

276
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,143
Go and write something in the board

277
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,862
The job is not right, sir?

278
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:15,696
That means mum

279
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,691
Office works efficiently
You can stay in the girls

280
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,749
The girls who are irredeeming are not good

281
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,370
My old friends said,

282
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,026
It's doubtless he said that

283
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,586
Why should I have such doubts?
287
<br> 00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:35,607
May I come?

284
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:37,344
You're already here

285
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,696
You see, boxer, kumuku
It will be work

286
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,467
I doubt that this job is right

287
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:52,920
What did she say?

288
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:55,707
Go and write something on the board

289
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:56,968
Go
294
<br> 00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,103
Tell me something to write
It was called the conduit on the board

290
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:10,549
How to behave
I doubt it

291
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:15,038
In your troubles
You have answers, sir

292
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:18,844
Am I right, sir?

293
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,349
It's just like this, okay
Written in the board

294
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:27,275
Girl? Yes
 - Written - exactly

295
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,359
This job is very important to me, sir

296
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,546
I'm like a single army
We'll work, sir

297
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,931
Wonderful Counseling

298
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:36,269
That girl also said this

299
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:39,789
So, now, sir ...?

300
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:41,016
Do one thing

301
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,893
Tomorrow morning exactly 10.00
Who's coming?

302
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:45,146
He'll get the job done

303
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,724
I run the first

304
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,318
The first in college

305
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:50,148
Tomorrow is the 1st on the 1st

306
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,618
I'm coming to the corner

307
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:52,761
I suspect you are not coming

308
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:55,418
I'm suspicious

309
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,979
Okay, Alam. Alam
Tent 10

310
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,444
10.00 It's suspicious

311
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,531
That's why it's wracked all night

312
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,044
Wait
318
<br> 00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:09,908
The shower is right
I have to go

313
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:12,105
There you are
Stay with them

314
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:12,977
Go
 - Go

315
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,805
It's 10.00
There's another time

316
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:06,970
Scratch a bit

317
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,526
It's 10:00 as soon as the job is done

318
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:17,835
It's gone

319
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,010
You do not come at 10:00
I doubt it
326
<br> 00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:41,106
When the Madapugur bus is coming
From the morning wait for the Attappur bus

320
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,702
what is the time?
9.30 am

321
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,765
The job's over

322
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:55,198

330
<br> 00:21:57,906 --> 00:21:58,931
Need a lift?
331
<br> 00:21:59,098 --> 00:21:59,746
Come on

323
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,021
A red saree returned
Lucky you lucky

324
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,751

 - Take a little off and stop

325
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:15,767
There?

00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,989
10 minutes another
There are 10. This job is mine

327
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:33,138
The elevator is there
Let's go

328
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,802
What time did it come in?

329
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:42,308
The size of the elevator

330
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,428
Stay

331
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,526
What can I do to go upstairs?
There

332
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:49,994
There are women there

333
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,189
The lift is full
There is no room

334
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,955
Give me a lift
Is it fair to give space in the lift?

335
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,368
Come on
345
<br> 00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,195
Give me a lift
Is it fair to give space in the lift?

336
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,167
Gangrene

337
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,803
Igilian Lucky

338
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:38,043
Get to the 7th floor
Suddenly came to the 8th floor

339
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:39,767
Running Lucky
 - Run

340
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,610
My suspicion is right

341
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,568
Have you seen time?

342
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:48,082
In no country in the country, you did not arrive at 10.00

343
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:50,677
The honest people do not come down on time

344
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:01,731
The sun, one
Time is coming

345
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:06,550
The sun does not even bargain
Common man. Let me pardon boss

346
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:08,840
But why is Mohan Babu in charm?

347
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:14,104
What about him?
His path was different. It's mine too

348
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:16,455
That's your job
That girl was given

349
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,624
This came to Lucky's place
Who are those gentlemen?

350
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:26,163
That pretty girl
With smile

351
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,783
Allow some
Two minutes

352
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,680
You gave the job to my wife

353
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,024
Manacled?

354
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:49,732
Manacled?
Doubt

355
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,515
You give me the job is one
Even one of my wives was given

356
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:54,852
Doubt
 - Suspicions

357
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,506
Are you two wife and wife?

You
What's up like wifi?

359
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,506
Our office does not have wifi

360
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:15,140
I do not want to do any work
If I'm in my lesson

361
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,009
I am your greatest asset
Positively responded

362
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,632
My mind changed
I applied for work

363
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,245
You applied for that job too

364
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:25,311
Test Suite I came
You got a job

365
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
In the morning, I gave him an elevator

366
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,069
I put you in the office elevator

367
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,065
Not even
No desk

368
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,465
This positivity you can not possibly be

369
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:43,646
Everything if you think a little positively
Fine

370
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,970
Is this a SOFTWARE POINTING CONSULTING?
Or a Murray Bureau?

371
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:48,844
I suspect

372
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:52,511
We're both living companions
I'll look at the marriage

373
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:54,183
You're getting ready for the wedding

374
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:57,758
Dad ..........

375
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,801
Slapping the cheek

376
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:04,926
Cheeky Guy is bad

377
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,601
It's positive that thinking is not cut

378
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:09,332
Be positive

379
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:11,032
is it?

380
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:15,573
Uncle
You gave her to the dowry

381
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:16,867
Cut off the road to break

382
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:18,900
My house was lost
It's bad thinking

383
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:22,651
Even without a house, he did not live
Thinking about it is positive

384
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:24,799
It's Dad

385
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,584
What the hell's wrong?

386
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,105
Someone marries me
Torture

387
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:41,709
They were getting married
I did not say that I had the mushroom

388
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,133
Be positive

389
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:46,241
Shameless positive family

390
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:48,615
No, Dad
 - I want to kill him

391
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:53,161
Padma. Stay in the seat for 10 minutes
Calm down

392
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:56,978
If society is positively not there is any necessity

393
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,088
No such noises

394
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,097
He does not even know if you really want to marry you
405
<br> 00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,646
Think a little positively

395
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:12,110
Everyday, this is in the bar
It's doubtful why it does not work out

396
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,216
Why do you have such doubts?
I doubt it, sir

397
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:24,178
Justin Rivy is right
It's like collecting money

398
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:27,255
Even if I did not have a job, I doubt she had come to work

399
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,787
You can ask
 - Listen

400
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,920
good morning
 - What are you doing here?

401
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:36,202
To help my wife

402
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:40,029
What's your wife?
 - Nonsense

403
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:42,025
Okay
You call me my husband

404
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,611
It's suspicious that Alam will be at 6.00 am

405
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:51,052
Do you have tooth brushes?
It's doubtful whether Fair & Lovely is

406
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:55,979
Is wearing pants now?
 Or it's doubtful whether this is the way it is right now
418
<br> 00:27:56,028 --> 00:28:00,790
Now she caught an ebb and ran away
Is she dead? It's doubtful there is one

407
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:06,225
Do not make a new one when there are so many doubts
Ask one thing

408
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:10,747
Are you two jobs?
Or is it the only job? Shared

409
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:12,892
Is not it?

410
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:15,384
Shoot
This is not a car

411
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,749
beat it

412
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,173
You have a place in my heart too

413
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:20,148
Your heart also has a place

414
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,728
In my relationship
The place to dwell is permanent

415
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,931
Anyway, it's mine
You have space

416
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:29,966
Try Twins?

417
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,283
Is this a Soft Weare Solution?
Is it a Susan's Park?

418
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,216
Whoever's in love
It's coming back

419
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:39,810
What about your husband?
Are you coming after?

420
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,223
What did I say? Not love
Single party marriage

421
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:49,309
My wife is angry

422
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,429
Your doubts ...

423
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:04,365
Know

424
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,501
Tomorrow, you drink green tea
If it's leaking green ...

425
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,570
You gave the sign the sign for our marriage

426
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,406
I doubt she's going
I doubt that

427
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:43,222
What?

428
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:45,511
If you love it, green
He said, "Come on, boys."

429
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,227
You see?
- Scarves

430
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:51,907
Not even love
Nothing. Do not come back

431
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:58,471
That means a positive post
To think badly

432
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:02,538
You do not like the things of the bad people like you
Thinking is the only positive thing

433
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,882
Is Society Positive?
Negative too much

434
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:13,813
Positive thinking made the plane
I found the parachute in a bad way

435
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,994
How important is positive?
Loneliness is so important

436
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:18,811
I do not love you

437
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:20,462
We do not have any rice between us

438
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:39,017
The leaves are fine
Hello, positive

439
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,976
God was positive

440
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:45,229
Thursday also has good news

441
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,585
To wear a wedding necklace?

442
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:37,666
What happened in a positive dress?
455
<br> 00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,764
Positive Padma
You did not file a police complaint

443
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,310
Leave him alone
You can get married

444
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:50,137
Please, this is a positive fall
Do not stingy

445
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:50,692
Right

446
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:51,520
Let's be separated

447
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,122
But before that
Tell me one story - All right
461
<br> 00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:54,938
Tell

448
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,503
In a well-established state

449
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:58,190
There was one king

450
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:00,749
He had 9 children

451
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:02,789
How is that?

452
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:06,880
The king is too strong. The Queen is giving more support
Yes. OK, okay

453
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:09,037
You tell me
 - Those are the nine

454
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,350
He went hunting twice

455
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,174
One did not bring
Why not? Why not?

456
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:19,457
8 tractors, 6 buses,
There are 7 cycles

457
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,951
8 Scooters, 9 Cars

458
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,441
Got to come.
That's why I did not bring it
473
<br> 00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,479
We're going to Amir Pet.
Art to Amaravathi

459
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:31,051
Is this a story?

460
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:36,409
There is a phone number for this talk

461
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,506
Whether you want to visit Diqad, you go home
477
<br> 00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:40,441
I will not

462
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,659
In a well-established state

463
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,686
In a well-established state

464
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,270
There was one king

465
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:55,850
It is necessary to come to sleep while sleeping
Why is she coming?

466
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:01,270
There is a phone number for this talk

467
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,324
Whether you want to visit Diqad, you go home
484
<br> 00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,536
I will not

468
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:08,773
You?
 I will definitely know
486
<br> 00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:12,121
Is not this a positive monetary policy?

469
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:13,965
Let me show you

470
00:36:14,471 --> 00:36:17,045
To the king for children 9

471
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:20,802
He went hunting twice

472
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,720
To ....

473
00:36:40,124 --> 00:36:41,683
Does this really mean her?

474
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:44,445
Let's check once

475
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:55,352
Since when?
494
<br> 00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:56,431
Padma

476
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,755
Positive Padma

477
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,316
It's impossible to get a Diocletian

478
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,127
Picked up your phone number

479
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:03,430
What did you do?

480
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:06,308
What do you mean?
I have a brain

481
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,035
Right?
 - I'm thinking
501
<br> 00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:10,011
That's where I am
 - not

482
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,415
You did not say words

483
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:18,074
All times that I propose
Your eyesight positively responds

484
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:21,577
Looks better than yo

485
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,491
Think once more positively

486
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,774
Meet the pizza house tomorrow

487
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,342
200 to not 100,000

488
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:41,994
You need to bank it

489
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:45,309
What's that for?
 - If this is a pretty girl on the road

490
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:46,776
Boys' hearts
Do not you stop?

491
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,301
If girls praised, they would get caught

492
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,123
That's right
Our own matters were told to our home

493
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,297
That earthquakes come and go

494
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,597
We are a family that believes positively

495
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,445
Know our love relationship
516
<br> 00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:05,058
Our family has responded positively

496
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:06,781
Thank God

497
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,832
But it's ... our servant himself

498
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:13,242
Spectacular?

499
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:15,389
Not accepted
521
<br> 00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,304
Yes

500
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:20,708
I have a job
He asked if he had any work

501
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:23,838
Even our employer's words
Our dad has a positive opinion

502
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:28,767
Cut him off

503
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:30,109
Not to remove him

504
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:32,597
You must work

505
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:35,563
Lucky

506
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,910
Fan Fan is also very tired
It's raining

507
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,494
You do not have to work?

508
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,052
PM should not be

509
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,294
At least it's not even Pizza Boy ...

510
00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:49,621
Our worker will like

511
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:51,643
Lucky

512
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:53,240
Order is madam
535
<br> 00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,489
Instead of giving the video
Order madam
536
<br> 00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:06,224
Get your love, I'm not Pizza
If necessary, there will be a victim
537
<br> 00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,031
No, no

513
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:16,579
Pizza in Boise
- All right. Well

514
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:19,659
I've got 25 billion

515
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:22,055
It's not easy to get away from JK

516
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:23,594
One of the dead

517
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:25,880
My passport is JK

518
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,766
I applied for a new passport
544
<br> 00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:31,740
You also go to the village and get your Passport
Bring it together

519
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:37,593
JK checked us
We'll check Dubai
546
<br> 00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:45,243
Keep the tips

520
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:47,121
My boss gives me a salary, sir

521
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:48,308
I do not want a tip
549
<br> 00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,370
You do not have a habit to practice

522
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,118
I do not have a habit to get rid of

523
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,499
Let's do something, sir

524
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:07,140
If you give money, you do not need to pack up

525
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:09,999
Calling to the aid box
To our positive family

526
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,564
A positive son-in-law

527
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,110
To our positive daughter
A positive husband

528
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:16,302
I will be positive for your marriage

529
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,841
Really
Put it off now? Positive

530
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:34,532
When your love for the last worker was what you wanted
Are you trying to commit suicide? It's wrong, Horror

531
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:36,194
Is it wrong?
Two tea

532
00:40:37,428 --> 00:40:39,189
Where's the water?
There, sir

533
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:43,093
Wait a lot longer
562
<br> 00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:48,981
Get 90 rupees (arrack) less than 9 rupees
Give me a hand?

534
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:51,105
To brandy to the stomach?
To whiskey?

535
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,603
Instead of asking,
We had to commit theft

536
00:40:57,308 --> 00:41:00,933
If you pay Rs. 9, .....
You do not understand

537
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:02,755
Kill you ...

538
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,141
Who's that pular
My friend

539
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,578
This is for knife
Kærakillaknē

540
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,405
Why did you kill the drummer?
Kill

541
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:20,910
What is she trying to kill?

542
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:22,831
It's a big story

543
00:41:23,172 --> 00:41:24,841
I can not bear my father's worries

544
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:26,633
To immigrate to Hydra

545
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:29,769
Already settling in hybrids
The guy came to Rajesh

546
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:37,389
I am fine
How are you

547
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:52,755
When you touch your hand
Get promoted

548
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:57,631
Wasana told him to
Unfortunate is his compulsion

549
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:00,353
I'll go to the village

550
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:04,104
When you hand up, it's called promotion
If you stay in my room ...

551
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,586
My room mates
My car. Coming

552
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,025
No, do not worry

Come on

554
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:16,303
Not my brain.
Listen to me. Nonsense

555
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,159
What kind of world are you?

556
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,730
Heitc. Heights
What are you doing on the planet?

557
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,399
I am Burma Nation
Do not worry

558
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,082
This is a YouTube executable
Swap me

559
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:29,464
Which came to work
There's no work

560
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:33,439
do not be afraid. I am HR

561
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:41,320
This is my best friend, sir

562
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:50,114
I got my first copy of this
He only narrowly survived

563
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:53,051
He's my Benche's friend
Today, we walk on the Benz

564
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:55,789
Sir, give him a job
Anybody take our company together

565
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,364

566
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:59,034
Stealing, sir

One of the mail

571
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:13,653
Did I make a promotion again?

572
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:17,958
Our company CEO is Converso
Get arrested

573
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:19,918
Are you arrested?

574
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:23,118
I'm getting rid of you

575
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:27,389
Got it?
Our company is closed

576
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:35,524
Is the company locked? This is his job. Freak
You do not have a job as well

577
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,791
What's your job?

578
00:43:38,163 --> 00:43:43,354
Actually our company
Where did you get it?

579
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,529
Remember the badge ...
At least a laptop ...

580
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:50,861
I said something would happen if I had

581
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:51,960
I'm going to Vijayawada

582
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:55,787
I'm not following after
This is a YouTube executable

583
00:43:55,976 --> 00:44:00,034
And while making progress
These things are normal. do not be afraid

584
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:01,901

My uncle

587
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,895
When you're picking up
You're messing with me. Uncle, tell me

588
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,019
Watch the news?

589
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:17,607
Worthy news

590
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:19,894
Why should I earn a living when I'm here?

591
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:23,466
The marriage is invalid
Cancel?

592
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:29,210
I thought you were uncleared by your uncle.
But it's fine. Your daughter loves me. do not be afraid

593
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:34,141
No one has a look

594
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,970
No one can get married without getting a job
You have a phone

595
00:44:38,555 --> 00:44:39,447
Listen to me

Give Flart the key

603
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,615
Why use the Flashlight key?
Then you're in the pavilion

604
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:10,335
Get the watchman with you

605
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,212
Take your hand
 - Get your hands off

606
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:18,951
At the morning bus stand

607
00:45:19,513 --> 00:45:21,459
It's mine before evening
Life's a busy banquet

You're giving up like this ...
That means ....?

612
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:37,884
Will this situation stop me?
Will you destroy me?

613
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:41,534
You do not?
Why are you I will go

614
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:43,085

615
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:51,238
What's this guy?

616
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:53,579
He is in Pulihar for Pulihar

617
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,823
What the fuck are you with?

618
00:45:56,029 --> 00:45:57,504
The trouble people know about you

619
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:00,159
In one way, life was shaken

620
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,598
You're gearing up and start your story again

621
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,963
And why are you dying for your brother?

622
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:17,022
My life was gone

623
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,010
One day my dad called me

624
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:29,648
How long has it been?

625
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,483
Wait a minute
I'm getting a call

626
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,624
You do not call your father's name

627
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:39,756
Call me then.
Mother's name is mentioned on this father's name

628
00:46:40,827 --> 00:46:42,147
How are you doing, Halo?

629
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:45,283
Sang's engagement.
Okay. Got it

630
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:46,991
Do not come anywhere

631
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:50,908
What's this? Father
Tell me to come

632
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:53,782
The real brother
You definitely should come

633
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,407
I do not believe
He does not say

634
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,664
Nirmala I'm here
But if it's okay, then my sister's appointment will stop

635
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,966
Why did you come?
That's not it

636
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:04,502
You definitely should come
Show

637
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,142
I'll come with my aunt

638
00:47:11,968 --> 00:47:12,468
Let's go

639
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:16,778
I'm going to the aunt's house
I'll get to your dad

640
00:47:17,571 --> 00:47:19,465
Come on. This is my home
Positive

641
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,805
Better?
You're great

642
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,310
My father

643
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,452
My mother

644
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,896
Because Lucky came through?

645
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:34,911
Did your dad come?

646
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:37,411
Oh
Rævæṭṭuvānē

647
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:38,555
What to do now?

648
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,681
Why are you there?
Come on in

649
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,217
Oppression is caused due to anger

650
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:52,913
If laugh, there will be happiness

651
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:55,023
Positive

652
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,377
Tell in

653
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:00,612
Come on, daughter

654
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,051
For these things, to your son
Tell me to be right

655
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,063
Right

656
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,731
Transfer to disk

657
00:48:58,011 --> 00:49:00,596
You're handing over your dear daughter

658
00:49:03,464 --> 00:49:04,621
You have to look carefully

659
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:06,955
What is that?
My baby

660
00:49:07,308 --> 00:49:08,647
What is your daughter?

661
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,095
Are we with a daughter?
Son? Son

662
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,296
Son?

663
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,097
Son - son

664
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:21,021
Very funny
What's funny now?

665
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:27,859
Manmadi is a bit confused
Aunt scatters

666
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:31,789
Brother

667
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:35,269
It's difficult to get a son
A doctor did

668
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:38,243
You need to open the hospital
Definitely to come

669
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:40,646
What?
Ask about dowry

670
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:46,112
We said it was Rs. 25 ....
My brother-in-law went there. Will

671
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,928
My uncle is coming

672
00:49:54,745 --> 00:50:02,041
We're sorry, Abi ..... We've got money for two days
Then I'll give it to my account

673
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:05,799
Blessed
- Definitely gonna kill me

674
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,864
Are you alright?
 - Good

675
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,824
I'll get it myself in just 2 days

676
00:50:13,397 --> 00:50:14,187
Such a wound

677
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:16,595
Go
- Good

678
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:23,777
The pocket money is Rs.2500 million?

679
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:25,967
Thank you, Nirmala.
Not Pocket, but Lucky

680
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,754
Dowry money
Daddy was going to take it

681
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:31,843
Brother. Not my father
You have to go

682
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:35,948
what? Your dad
Come close This is the best idea

683
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,432
Who said that so good idea?

684
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:43,119
This is what my positive lady said
Good

685
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:45,714
For childhood things
I do not speak for years

686
00:50:46,386 --> 00:50:49,068
Again, my lucky number is 25
No, it's not necessary

687
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:53,887
Positive ... Ambo
Know your positive things. Take it

688
00:50:55,173 --> 00:50:57,732
Law .....

689
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:01,613
We brought it to her
25 lakhs to Lucky

690
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:05,119
We'll go to Hyderabad.
I know. Shut your mouth

691
00:51:08,228 --> 00:51:08,728
Got it

692
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,758
Bus shifted
Your life has become devastating

693
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:14,768
Right

694
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:17,790
Not right
I do not have a choice

695
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:23,019
If your sister's marriage is not interrupted. That future uncle
They have to tell lies that they have used money

696
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:25,127
False

697
00:51:27,872 --> 00:51:30,382
I have no habit of doing wrong
But there is no mistake

698
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:33,013
Actively tell your dad the right one

699
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:34,115
Understand

700
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,548
Suicides

701
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:37,651
Listen to me

702
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:39,889
Think positively ....

703
00:51:40,316 --> 00:51:42,841
I'll do something.
Leave. I'll see you later

704
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,101
Lucky

705
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,562
What's the change of bag?
What's so insane?

706
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:58,495
It also has my nkklass
Even more important is your passport

707
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:02,542
First to escape from JK
We need our bag

708
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:04,535
What's the name of the Travels you've come in?

709
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:09,128
Sir, our bag has been changed
Take a look?
739
<br> 00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,311
My bag has been changed in the morning bus
What's the matter?

710
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:18,574
My bag's shifted
Both bags are the same

711
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:20,539
Change
This is my bag

712
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:27,447
My father's tired

713
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:29,643
My tiredness

714
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,927
Passport
Thank you, boss

715
00:52:37,966 --> 00:52:39,903
Tricked into the box

716
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,682
Now I got the bag
I returned it

717
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:43,609
Do you know this was a diamond necklace?

718
00:52:43,977 --> 00:52:45,386
I did not look because my brother did not

719
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:48,919
Sir, am I going to go?
with pleasure.

720
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,621
Because you gave me so much money
Dowry money

721
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:58,809
Does it have time?
See once
752
<br> 00:52:59,457 --> 00:53:02,100
It's been sent by your father

722
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:06,058
A lucky man
You are like that

723
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:10,663
Are you married? not
Or not? Will you get my brother's daughter?

724
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:12,319
I have a girlfriend

725
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,013
Do I have to?

726
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,734
Homemade time
Eat burgers eat

727
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:18,748
Who's at home?

728
00:53:19,185 --> 00:53:19,985
No, boy

729
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:21,826
Where did you go?

730
00:53:23,026 --> 00:53:24,232
I'll be back
Fine, son

731
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:27,520
What's this?

732
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,644
Padu's phone is not working from the evening

733
00:53:29,948 --> 00:53:31,684
This is the happiest day of Lucky

734
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,836
Soon, we are happy
The phone is not working when thanking the rainbow

735
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,919
Okay, talk to me tomorrow

736
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:57,575
Missed 25?

737
00:53:59,017 --> 00:54:00,594
Ammo is my lucky number

738
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:12,587
Why, dad?

739
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:13,925
Coming right there

740
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:14,637
Let's go

741
00:54:20,396 --> 00:54:21,460
where is...?

742
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:26,127
Where are we going to Dad ...?

743
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,747
Have you given money?

744
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:44,389
Give it, Dad

745
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,972
When did you come?
When and when?

746
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,847
That's because I have Rs. 25 million
You are given

747
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,064
I forget myself

748
00:54:57,121 --> 00:55:00,443
But forget about 25 lakhs
There is no such thing as forgetfulness

749
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:03,980
The rupee has been added to the rupee
This is such a house

750
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,668
That's not it. Look at this
Not money. Do not say

751
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:10,862
Otherwise, father and son
Do not act

752
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:14,830
Talk to me

753
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:17,492
Did the bus on the bus lose out?

754
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:20,662
Father ...
Padma called and spoke to me

755
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:24,286
Or not, Dad
After that. Do not say one word

756
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,802
Because of you, I'm in front of them for you
Listening to stories

757
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:33,296
Father, son and actors

758
00:55:33,507 --> 00:55:34,548
Did not find it

759
00:55:35,977 --> 00:55:42,189
My daughter's coming. believe me
I'll give you your money

760
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,230
Please do not stop the marriage

761
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,098
Dad, trust me
I gave it to Dad

762
00:55:49,894 --> 00:55:51,547
Dad, Dad

763
00:55:52,296 --> 00:55:54,624
Dad, just listen to me
Trust me, Dad

764
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:00,078
Believe

765
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,719
Because I was in some sort of spirit

766
00:56:03,362 --> 00:56:04,720
You were born

767
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,843
After that, it's yours
Even if we had fallen

768
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:10,998
My daughter's stay is staying

769
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,835
This heart stops
I believe

770
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,791
A son was born more than a native

771
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:20,194
In the day she was born, she would have died

772
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,260
One day is half

773
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:28,540
My life's been for years
Crawl over

774
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:31,487
There is another soul

775
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:33,636
You are not my son

776
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:36,100
Do not be born on a son or daughter

777
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:44,468
Look, Padma
Daddy does not accept

778
00:56:45,189 --> 00:56:47,839
I understood
You're a negative character

779
00:56:49,229 --> 00:56:51,976
The lost bag is yours
Tell your dad

780
00:56:52,224 --> 00:56:52,851
Pent

781
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:55,722
You did not say
Lied that money was given

782
00:56:58,163 --> 00:57:02,873
Can you see this? Home gold jewelry
My dad gave me the bow

783
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:05,783
I gave you so much value for your love

784
00:57:05,963 --> 00:57:08,379
You're just saying this to my word
Not worth the money

785
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:12,951
Even though there are people like you, it's one
Not one of them

786
00:57:32,192 --> 00:57:34,458
Talk no word at all
Daddy who does not

787
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,760
In one word
You're Marion

788
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,250
I've always been positive
My Padma ...

789
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,250
I was stamped out that I was irrelevant

790
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,809
100 times a day Call Center
My mom talking like that

791
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:47,615
I did not even call once

792
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:50,120
Now say hijos ...

793
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:52,654
You're a buddy

794
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:57,893
You're fucking dying

795
00:57:58,484 --> 00:58:00,359
You do not live well, brother
Drink Away

796
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,342
What's that? To stop
You give it yourself

797
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,337
Stop the brother

798
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:06,690
Who are you trying to stop him?

799
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:08,025
Drink this

800
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:10,533
Drink

801
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:14,303
There is someone who is going to open the door
Aishwarya will not open even today

802
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,774
You drink
 - You drink, sir

803
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:18,303
That may have been positive
That's all you drink

804
00:58:18,387 --> 00:58:19,727
You're way off
Freak

805
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:27,723
Who are you in my room?
Hello, or this room is mine

806
00:58:28,044 --> 00:58:30,150
Kechillet's kite
Is not it yours?

807
00:58:30,234 --> 00:58:32,897
You're a thief

808
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:33,765
This room is mine

809
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:36,308
Clinical Plans are mine

810
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:38,293
It's in the building that was in it

811
00:58:38,572 --> 00:58:40,642
This is a ready flow

812
00:58:41,214 --> 00:58:43,368
Sorry, sorry
Go

813
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:50,549
There's a diamond necklace
know?

814
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,145
I did not look because I did not

815
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,664
Lucky
 - Yes

816
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,499
You need to help me

817
00:58:58,036 --> 00:58:58,941
Sorry, brother

818
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:00,433
I'm not in a state of support

819
00:59:00,722 --> 00:59:02,012
Will change in your life

820
00:59:02,779 --> 00:59:03,920
This bag is for you to have a day

821
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:05,451
I'll give you a bargain

822
00:59:09,391 --> 00:59:10,255
Come on, brother

823
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:13,653
One million a day

824
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,725
Let's face it tomorrow

825
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:19,367
That means you get the most worth playing?

826
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:21,697
A million is ours

827
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:23,620
Is that so?
Yes

828
00:59:26,216 --> 00:59:26,922
Deals ...... O ....

829
00:59:32,796 --> 00:59:35,024
What are you looking at?
It was drunk

830
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,788
Come from day one
One and a half dollars

831
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,807
Bag's safe
Bye

832
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:55,498
What are you looking at?
It was drunk

833
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:58,201
Come from day one
One and a half dollars

834
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:00,374
Bag's safe
Bye

835
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:03,636
Who was your brother?
Unfortunately, the door is there

836
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,256
Is our score end?

837
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,918
It is my luck
It went like this

838
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:09,925
Who the fuck are you unlucky?

839
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,957
For the first time, I tried to die
I saved

840
01:00:11,977 --> 01:00:14,402
The second time I tried to die
That Pulihar was saved

841
01:00:14,855 --> 01:00:16,509
You'll definitely be lucky

842
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:21,577
It's my selfish suicide
I want to. How much money do you have?

843
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:25,987
The man who went to give a bargain is dead
If I give 1000, I'll be done

844
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:28,224
Take this bag
Keep

845
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:12,939
Where's the money?

846
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:16,691
I did not think I'd ever get caught, right?

847
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,447
You did not think you were tantalizing me

848
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:23,831
I thought JK

849
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:26,687
I want to say

850
01:01:27,175 --> 01:01:29,947
Hey, I've been saddened by my arrogance

851
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:36,774
I'll kill you when you die

852
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:39,319
Take them out

853
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:10,728
Leave a dispute
Elle?

854
01:02:20,513 --> 01:02:23,733
Early in the morning
Who knows this?

855
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:27,068
Who? At night we gave the bag

856
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,630
Killed in a car accident

857
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,342
Then my crock
What's another quota?

858
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:36,818
What are you unlucky?

859
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:39,074
The murder case you're about to get

860
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:41,866
The car gets hit by Drivier

861
01:02:42,163 --> 01:02:44,198
What a look you are in a fortune

862
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:46,524
Look at the angle
It's true

863
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:51,176
Thieves come empty-handed
It is not good to go empty

864
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:54,185
There was a switch.
I'm saying good news

865
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,925
Give me a nice gift, brother

866
01:02:56,056 --> 01:02:59,749
Just stay here

867
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:04,720
This bag?
This is a fake brother

868
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:06,499
If he takes his bag

869
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:08,514
Like my body is going upside down

870
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:12,640
I'm not taking this bag
Are you sure? Sure. I do not

871
01:03:25,696 --> 01:03:26,436
What's wrong?

872
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:30,043
I said the bag.
Ofer time is over

873
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,655
You can think a little

874
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:34,119
Weird. You did not hear me before

875
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:36,378
I'm so puhihar
It's already understood

876
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:38,708
You get it
Hey ..........

877
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:42,076
You do not give up without killing yourself

878
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:50,677
Good friends day

879
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:53,109
Do not be so happy

880
01:03:53,573 --> 01:03:56,475
You are a thief

1052
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,887
The first mistake you did
Talking to JK

1053
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:05,764
Tell

1054
01:20:05,872 --> 01:20:08,925
You're good money
Rapture came to my house

1055
01:20:09,073 --> 01:20:11,267
It's rotating and looking forward to you

1056
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:16,683
Returns the Ruby to Lucky
I'll finish the case

1057
01:20:18,407 --> 01:20:20,918
Why did you come back?

1058
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:24,130
why? My phone has been forgotten
Take the fuck

1059
01:20:24,261 --> 01:20:25,644
where is? see

1060
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:29,669
Where? There it is
And I'm sorry, Raja

1061
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:34,234
Say sorry
Now you have to give the money

1062
01:20:36,259 --> 01:20:38,557
Now, there are no good people in society

1063
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:41,307
JK steal Rs. 25 million out of that

1064
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:44,321
You do not get 25 percent

1065
01:20:44,526 --> 01:20:48,609
I suspect a good guy like me
No positive effects are positive

1066
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:52,093
I'm not good at anyone
Why is it better?

1067
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:54,738
That's why I came to one decision

1068
01:20:54,941 --> 01:20:58,123
What's Lucky?
I have fun with all the money

1069
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:01,820
Not 25 lakhs to enjoy
25 crores

1070
01:21:02,028 --> 01:21:02,733
The first game

1071
01:21:03,118 --> 01:21:04,000
Race track

1072
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:07,627
My lucky number is 01

1073
01:21:08,185 --> 01:21:10,805
01 If you win one, I will give him Rs

1074
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,743
I'll check my fortune

1075
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,487
Here you are, Raja.
Hey, you do not know about JK

1076
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,581
Then, like a transformer, neck
Dengue (troubles)

1077
01:21:26,826 --> 01:21:28,154
Leave the phone ...

1078
01:21:31,267 --> 01:21:34,303
Raja put him on the phone
Not to break

1079
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,084
This was my wife
Gifts were given to the day

1080
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:40,695
Excuse me, Raja

1081
01:21:40,746 --> 01:21:42,948
Take the Race Course and catch it

1082
01:22:03,859 --> 01:22:05,328
Win on this race
11:19
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,429
25 to 50

1083
01:22:10,512 --> 01:22:11,342
That's the winner

1084
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:26,577
Tell these donkeys
Your number 01 was won

1085
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:27,305
Winner

1086
01:22:28,808 --> 01:22:31,675
No. 1 is not in the image
No. 10

1087
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:36,431
It's lost as a result
Our money lost

1088
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:40,718
Come see his face
It's faster than the media

1089
01:22:41,026 --> 01:22:42,305
He will run away
see

1090
01:22:49,107 --> 01:22:51,778
I went away
Give the rest

1091
01:22:52,036 --> 01:22:53,485
Or 24 hours

1092
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:55,091
Your reaction is Raja Raja

1093
01:23:00,498 --> 01:23:01,990
I was in touch with my feelings

1094
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,183
Let's do a little game by saying lori

1095
01:23:04,806 --> 01:23:08,650
I say the phrase 4 times
He said he would give the money

1096
01:23:08,892 --> 01:23:13,334
4 I'll tell you by a quarter of a time
It's so easy to make money

1097
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:15,377
Tell me what?
It's very easy

1098
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:17,665
4 lorries water
4 lorries

1099
01:23:20,107 --> 01:23:21,542
Tell me again
Not easy

1100
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,258
It's very easy

1101
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:29,141
Wait a minute

1102
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,380
Road ...

1103
01:23:33,286 --> 01:23:33,786
Lorry

1104
01:23:34,287 --> 01:23:34,989
Lolly

1105
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:37,782
Can not you tell me the lori?

1106
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:40,246
I have experience
Get out of here
1144
<br> 01:23:47,019 --> 01:23:48,618
Do not matter, do the second one

1107
01:23:48,892 --> 01:23:50,134
Says
Do not worry

1108
01:23:55,881 --> 01:23:57,580
Do not mind, third way
1147
<br> 01:24:01,914 --> 01:24:04,173
I'll give it to myself

1109
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:13,082
Are you ok?

1110
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:45,200
Today's over

1111
01:26:04,389 --> 01:26:07,238
So much for so many
You could not do anything. JK

1112
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:10,224
What else can I do?

1113
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,855
So, let's kidnap the villain

1114
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:15,666
Do not fool yourself

1115
01:26:16,174 --> 01:26:21,903
All of Auro's ideas
I want it

1116
01:26:22,187 --> 01:26:23,237
Sale
Get the phone

1117
01:26:33,961 --> 01:26:36,155
what is doing?
I'm lucky

1118
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:37,326
Cricket came to Betine

1119
01:26:38,722 --> 01:26:42,927
Hybrid and carcasses
The bet is worth 4 million. 4 billion?

1120
01:26:45,004 --> 01:26:47,789
Raja's work
Touch the rings on the ring

1121
01:26:47,944 --> 01:26:49,479
Bambiber Form is waiting

1122
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:52,385
I am a Hybrid
He touches Hyderabath too

1123
01:26:54,137 --> 01:26:58,933
Call our betting fields
I need to know where he is

1124
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:15,812
Like you said, you won Hybrid
It's fucking awesome

1125
01:27:16,225 --> 01:27:19,877
You think you're a big bet
Touch your scribbles

1126
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:20,641
4 ..........

1127
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,457
4 + 1 = 5 went all the way

1128
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:29,923
Do not give up on listening to me sir

1129
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,831
That's Lucky's next job
Know what

1130
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:45,150
How much more, a million others, Raja

1131
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:47,285
What else are you?
1,171
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,917
All the money has been transferred to dollars
It's sent from vehicles

1132
01:27:51,668 --> 01:27:53,499
Now you're Deepal

1133
01:27:55,212 --> 01:27:56,821
Little, big change

1134
01:27:57,174 --> 01:27:59,334
Everyone in our bus stops

1135
01:28:11,969 --> 01:28:13,516
Good movie

1136
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:14,993
What is this injustice?

1137
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:19,030
This is a name for this
Good movie?

1138
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,083
How's it going?

1139
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:26,026
That's with Sunnyvale. So lovely
What is the state of air with your money?

1140
01:28:26,066 --> 01:28:28,102
You need to name your name

1141
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:31,978
A million in races
Four hundred million worth of bonds were lost

1142
01:28:32,228 --> 01:28:34,431
His final show
One should see it

1143
01:28:49,132 --> 01:28:50,011
Lucky

1144
01:28:58,063 --> 01:28:59,784
Running well, Raja

1145
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:15,710
JK stands for two letters

1146
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:18,105
Chavo (death) two letters
1187
<br> 01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:20,704
Your Padma also has two letters

1147
01:29:23,437 --> 01:29:26,426
You're killing your deadline in 2 minutes

1148
01:29:26,712 --> 01:29:27,385
Hey JK

1149
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:34,592
Do not do anything to Padma

1150
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:43,856
If something happens to Padma ...

1151
01:29:44,029 --> 01:29:48,709
Is that what you're expecting now?
It was supposed to be true

1152
01:29:48,891 --> 01:29:51,001
Please call later

1153
01:29:51,629 --> 01:29:53,227
Whatsapp is open

1154
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:02,873
Was the screen in place?
Did the brain get stuck?

1155
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,406
You have only one chance

1156
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:10,156
The money you have with me

1157
01:30:10,616 --> 01:30:13,232
Your girlfriend is your CI
It will come to you

1158
01:30:14,298 --> 01:30:16,173
Will you send the shadow to death?

1159
01:30:17,516 --> 01:30:19,573
Or do I come with money?

1160
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:20,956
Choose yourself

1161
01:30:53,663 --> 01:30:54,532
Slowly, Dude

1162
01:30:54,986 --> 01:30:56,744
Brother
Come with me

1163
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:01,003
Brother

1164
01:31:01,186 --> 01:31:03,494
Come with me
You love me, right?

1165
01:31:04,895 --> 01:31:06,821
Do not go
 - Go

1166
01:31:19,956 --> 01:31:22,504
What's wrong?
We sent him briefs

1167
01:31:22,615 --> 01:31:24,135
He also sent me whatsup

1168
01:31:24,343 --> 01:31:26,989
My squad is up
Should you drop the woman's fear?

1169
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:29,223
Do not give up that girl

1170
01:31:29,462 --> 01:31:31,871
It's my fault

1171
01:31:35,118 --> 01:31:36,918
What else are you doing?
Break the phone

1172
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,037
Who's that long hair splitter?

1173
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,668
What was it to me, huh?

1174
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:43,652
What money are you with?
1,216
01:31:44,204 --> 01:31:45,331
What really is going on?

1175
01:31:45,722 --> 01:31:47,147
All right, let's hear it
1218
<br> 01:31:55,936 --> 01:31:58,583
Sorry, candy
I do not accept forgiveness

1176
01:31:59,933 --> 01:32:02,107
Please, please
That's it

1177
01:35:37,052 --> 01:35:38,974
Our, ours
What happened?

1178
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,649
Nothing
It's all fine. You're......

1179
01:35:41,681 --> 01:35:42,633
Ammo hit ...
 - Going

1180
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,460
Whatever you say

1181
01:35:47,696 --> 01:35:49,955
How good is the hall?
That's not it

1182
01:35:50,392 --> 01:35:51,465
Where did we get married?

1183
01:35:52,448 --> 01:35:53,888
Whom to ask
Our daughter .....

1184
01:35:55,092 --> 01:35:58,329
Our son's marriage.
I forget about your forgetfulness

1185
01:35:58,454 --> 01:36:00,460
Son of a bitch
Let's go. Let's go.

1186
01:36:02,346 --> 01:36:03,921
Come this way

1187
01:36:07,691 --> 01:36:09,231
Your brother is good

1188
01:36:09,732 --> 01:36:11,995
Stay positive
Think about it

1189
01:36:12,182 --> 01:36:12,839
There

1190
01:36:18,075 --> 01:36:21,418
Mother spoke. Sister crying
That's why I'm here

1191
01:36:24,678 --> 01:36:26,768
My dad
Go

1192
01:36:31,633 --> 01:36:34,779
Do not think
The brother-in-law has prepared our marriage

1193
01:36:35,676 --> 01:36:38,060
Not our marriage
Our son's marriage ... son

1194
01:36:39,339 --> 01:36:42,603
Who's the burqa?
Come with the bridegroom

1195
01:36:42,686 --> 01:36:43,368
Come on ...
 - Oh ....

1196
01:36:43,523 --> 01:36:46,242
Not for you
Your son. is it?

1197
01:36:46,275 --> 01:36:46,849
I'll come with you

1198
01:36:49,395 --> 01:36:49,895
Yes
1,242
01:36:52,204 --> 01:36:55,609
What do you want?
Who's the Ark? There are chops

1199
01:36:56,332 --> 01:36:57,923
wait a little....

1200
01:36:57,962 --> 01:36:59,016
What is this creep with me?

1201
01:36:59,274 --> 01:37:02,042
I'm going to the cousin here
Let me tell you the turkey

1202
01:37:02,193 --> 01:37:03,497
Stay with Mom

1203
01:37:03,648 --> 01:37:05,350
Go. Right
best wishes. Be positive

1204
01:37:12,963 --> 01:37:13,589
Bǣnō

1205
01:37:23,124 --> 01:37:24,663
I did not expect you to come, do you?

1206
01:37:26,464 --> 01:37:27,645
JK:That's right

1207
01:37:32,183 --> 01:37:33,967
There are bubbles in the lower gift boxes

1208
01:37:37,022 --> 01:37:38,185
Remot is in one JK

1209
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:41,802
Press it
In your hand

1210
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:46,213
Put the rhyme down here?
Your grandfather went to the house

1211
01:37:46,388 --> 01:37:48,615
Let's set the TV set and press the rhyme?

1212
01:37:48,935 --> 01:37:50,800
Why those
Give the money

1213
01:37:51,309 --> 01:37:54,459
If he gives money, I'll be so proud

1214
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,102
If the marriage stops right there

1215
01:37:58,478 --> 01:37:59,340
Listen to me, JK

1216
01:38:04,386 --> 01:38:06,400
Do not do anything for my stepmother
My sister's getting married

1217
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:08,102
I'll give you the money at the time of marriage

1218
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:09,208
The day is right

1219
01:38:11,269 --> 01:38:13,888
Get out of here, JK
Daddy's here

1220
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:17,637
What are you doing here?

1221
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:19,273
Brother

1222
01:38:19,427 --> 01:38:20,749
Brother
 - What is this?

1223
01:38:21,578 --> 01:38:22,439
Who are these

1224
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:25,700
Nothing at all is Basthiousam

1225
01:38:25,934 --> 01:38:28,270
Your kid took over your $ 25 billion

1226
01:38:28,952 --> 01:38:30,049
25 billion?

1227
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,180
We play 20-20 with us

1228
01:38:32,381 --> 01:38:33,715
Tell you, sir

1229
01:38:36,656 --> 01:38:38,169
It's not that, Dad
Listen to me

1230
01:38:43,772 --> 01:38:44,739
He's not my son

1231
01:38:47,864 --> 01:38:51,070
Long ago my son was dead
She does not understand

1232
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:54,517
This is where my daughter is getting married

1233
01:38:55,205 --> 01:38:56,566
Please do not interrupt

1234
01:38:58,627 --> 01:38:59,809
I do not know who this is

1235
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:03,345
Go outside

1236
01:39:13,944 --> 01:39:15,926
You have only one chance

1237
01:39:16,585 --> 01:39:18,451
You want to save your family's wings

1238
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,846
Tell me where the money is

1239
01:39:21,716 --> 01:39:22,947
Where were you, Raja?

1240
01:39:23,962 --> 01:39:24,693
Tell

1241
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:26,142
The tomb of Punjab

1242
01:39:46,356 --> 01:39:47,745
The bag is visible Raja

1243
01:39:49,031 --> 01:39:51,774
The bag is visible Raja
We have luck, Raja

1244
01:39:58,021 --> 01:40:00,787
The money in the bag
Why Rock

1245
01:40:03,314 --> 01:40:04,818
He's coming with you
Fucking brother

1246
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:11,389
Where's the money?

1247
01:40:12,831 --> 01:40:13,831
Where is my money?

1248
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,094
Where did they go?

1249
01:40:16,659 --> 01:40:18,989
Listen to me
 - Where's my money?

1250
01:40:19,912 --> 01:40:20,537
Tell

1251
01:40:20,952 --> 01:40:22,099
And where's my money?

1252
01:40:22,657 --> 01:40:23,604
What money do you have?

1253
01:40:24,256 --> 01:40:25,280
What is your money, Raja?

1254
01:40:25,438 --> 01:40:26,923
Ragapānavada?
 - What's your money?

1255
01:40:33,428 --> 01:40:36,894
Years ago, Charminar
Bank is robbed

1256
01:40:38,015 --> 01:40:40,978
Where's the money that my father had given to my name?

1257
01:40:41,017 --> 01:40:45,994
What's the robbery?
The banks manages the Emergency Cardmer

1258
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:50,095
Testing for CBI
He killed the officer

1259
01:40:51,147 --> 01:40:54,958
The news journalist was killed

1260
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,549
You're going that list

1261
01:41:00,785 --> 01:41:04,074
This was a fun option
A Vindictive Squad?

1262
01:41:06,298 --> 01:41:07,272
Cut that out

1263
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:44,486
It's been years
My dad has not called my name

1264
01:41:49,704 --> 01:41:51,733
Now, I'm getting one too good

1265
01:42:30,013 --> 01:42:31,686
Bank goes bankrupt?

1266
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:32,926
You?

1267
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:38,127
Because you are criminals like you
Do you know how many families fall on the streets?

1268
01:42:38,515 --> 01:42:39,015
know?

1269
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:43,515
Vēdanāvayida?

1270
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,542
I'm in pain here

1271
01:42:50,934 --> 01:42:52,371
Do not lose our JK

1272
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:54,624
Big and big countries connect

1273
01:42:54,767 --> 01:42:56,152
If necessary, it stopped violence

1274
01:42:56,215 --> 01:42:57,577
Let's leave the rest

1275
01:42:58,992 --> 01:43:01,292
What are you doing?
 - What are you doing?
1320
<br> 01:43:01,491 --> 01:43:03,374
Stay
 - It's our brother

1276
01:43:03,562 --> 01:43:04,684
What money is it?
1,322
01:43:05,104 --> 01:43:07,714
Do not spend anything at all
All the ACPs are given

1277
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,718
Did not you even spend a rupee?

1278
01:43:11,164 --> 01:43:13,883
Calling races
Told

1279
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:14,864
But I did not play

1280
01:43:15,306 --> 01:43:17,332
So IPL bet?

1281
01:43:17,428 --> 01:43:19,245
Said it
But did not

1282
01:43:19,377 --> 01:43:22,609
You said a movie

1283
01:43:23,174 --> 01:43:24,223
Only the posters.

1284
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:27,960
JK, your headline is over

1285
01:43:30,549 --> 01:43:31,779
There is no evidence
There is no trace

1286
01:43:32,042 --> 01:43:32,923
How can I get arrested?

1287
01:43:34,925 --> 01:43:38,924
Telling him to put these cricketers in betting
Have you talked to all the bucks?

1288
01:43:39,533 --> 01:43:42,758
And then ACP sir all the tapes
Not only that

1289
01:43:43,036 --> 01:43:46,584
You talk to me too
That's also the tapes

1290
01:43:47,037 --> 01:43:48,413
Not just one

1291
01:43:48,635 --> 01:43:51,152
You've done all the crimes you've been up to now

1292
01:43:51,287 --> 01:43:53,088
It's called emotions

1293
01:44:02,092 --> 01:44:03,137
Our Lucky .....
1340
<br> 01:44:03,665 --> 01:44:05,098
beat it
 - That's not the wreath ....
1341
<br> 01:44:05,207 --> 01:44:06,643
TV 9 is in the marmot

1294
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,568
TV?
 - Hey

1295
01:44:08,738 --> 01:44:09,670
Put on TV 9

1296
01:44:10,957 --> 01:44:12,523
There you go
See, waw

1297
01:44:12,863 --> 01:44:14,887
1000, even for 2,000

1298
01:44:14,974 --> 01:44:17,502
These are the crimes that have been committed so far

1299
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:20,814
Not even spending Rs. 25 crores

1300
01:44:20,885 --> 01:44:22,197
ACP gave in

1301
01:44:23,084 --> 01:44:24,707
This is your inspiration

1302
01:44:25,888 --> 01:44:26,638
My father

1303
01:44:27,822 --> 01:44:29,657
He's been learning from him to live

1304
01:44:33,783 --> 01:44:35,852
Your dad's name
Baktavatsalam

1305
01:44:42,992 --> 01:44:44,144
There's a real son

1306
01:44:44,471 --> 01:44:47,013
You're so fortunate to have a son like this

1307
01:44:47,272 --> 01:44:48,982
He handed over Rs. 25 million

1308
01:44:49,206 --> 01:44:52,383
How much billions
Not enough for your son

1309
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:03,560
Not that ....

1310
01:45:04,247 --> 01:45:05,999
Have seen this kid

1311
01:45:08,587 --> 01:45:09,460
Reminded

1312
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:12,081
One day I came to our house
So much money

1313
01:45:13,618 --> 01:45:14,560
Your son?

1314
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:16,669
Where were the money?

1315
01:45:17,058 --> 01:45:18,725
Your son is

1316
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:21,011
Ladies and sisters are so fortunate

1317
01:45:21,443 --> 01:45:25,259
Yes, he's been a kid
Alicia says

1318
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:26,670
But now it says

1319
01:45:27,162 --> 01:45:28,104
He's unlucky

1320
01:45:29,972 --> 01:45:33,378
What are the lakhs?
I heard stories in 25

1321
01:45:33,507 --> 01:45:34,520
He's unlucky

1322
01:45:36,228 --> 01:45:38,022
It's been 25 years

1323
01:45:38,205 --> 01:45:40,196
You're unhappy with that

1324
01:45:40,591 --> 01:45:43,134
Talked
He's unlucky

1325
01:45:44,024 --> 01:45:47,136
He's the only unfortunate person born in this house

1326
01:45:53,005 --> 01:45:54,307
Talk to my son

1327
01:45:58,494 --> 01:46:00,935
Wait a minute
My mother

1328
01:46:02,997 --> 01:46:03,768
It's Nirma

1329
01:46:04,053 --> 01:46:04,973
Looking at TV?

1330
01:46:05,072 --> 01:46:06,957
Are you talking good?

1331
01:46:08,322 --> 01:46:08,822
Lucky

1332
01:46:12,257 --> 01:46:12,826
Lucky

1333
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:16,539
Lucky

1334
01:46:18,151 --> 01:46:18,704
Dad

01:46:20,668 --> 01:46:21,320
Yes, my boy

1336
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:23,914
It's dad

1337
01:46:26,098 --> 01:46:28,613
You did not understand right now, son

1338
01:46:33,007 --> 01:46:34,633
You do not have the right to speak with you

1339
01:46:37,266 --> 01:46:38,370
Talk to me

1340
01:46:39,673 --> 01:46:41,075
You can not talk, Dad

1341
01:46:43,042 --> 01:46:46,346
You call me my name
From childhood

1342
01:46:48,818 --> 01:46:52,654
Whenever you call me whenever you name
You had to say something

1343
01:46:53,249 --> 01:46:54,064
What is that?

1344
01:46:54,815 --> 01:46:55,760
I love you, Dad
