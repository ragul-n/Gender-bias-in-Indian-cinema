1
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,363
St. Stephen's College
of Arts and Science...

2
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,931
...welcomes Mr. Vikas Jadhav,
our honourable education minister...

3
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,376
...and his wife,
on this auspicious occasion...

4
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,413
...of our college function.

5
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:04,214
So, we present first...
Omkar Sharma, AKA Omi.

6
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,019
I love you all.

7
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:12,356
I love you all. What the...

8
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:13,656
Sorry.

9
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,801
Look. Movie auditions, in our college.

10
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:21,772
If I get this role, life will set.

11
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:26,277
If they see me, they'll be set.

12
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,441
Somebody stop me.

13
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,386
Sir. Very good actor.

14
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,919
Jai.

15
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,023
Not the one from Sholay.

16
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,725
But, the same name and personality.

17
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,556
Look, Jai.

18
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:46,889
Jai. - Sir.

19
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,491
Latch that door.

20
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,994
Hold her hand and say this dialogue.

21
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,701
She'll scream 'No'!

22
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,399
The scene ends there.

23
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,738
But, I want that anger in your eyes.

24
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,708
Actor, sir. Actor.

25
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:00,973
Sir, dialogues. Madam, ready?

26
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,236
Ready, sir.

27
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:02,815
Ready? - Yes, sir.

28
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:03,473
Ready.

29
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,385
So, Miles away when
the father's awake.

30
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:14,216
Miles away when the father's awake.

31
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,762
The son says,
father go back to sleep...

32
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,821
...or you'll have another one like me.

33
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,862
Mr. Principal,
what rubbish is he saying?

34
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,528
Thank you.

35
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:28,941
I love you all.

36
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:29,873
Action!

37
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:31,837
Henna.

38
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:35,974
Henna. Henna.
- You can't do this to me, Vasu.

39
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,607
Please.

40
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,249
Let me go.

41
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,316
Let you go. You!

42
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:46,619
You. When you never took pity on me.

43
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:48,819
Not bad. The boy's got potential.

44
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:53,059
Who says, you only fall in love once.

45
00:05:55,935 --> 00:06:00,429
So, No one can take Kashmir.

46
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,307
Wow! Wow! Wow!

47
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,740
Sir.

48
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,540
No one can take Kashmir.

49
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,275
No one can give Kashmir. - Wow!

50
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,378
You can only have
a two day three night...

51
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,975
honeymoon package in Kashmir.

52
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:13,708
Right.

53
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,846
Mr. Principal. What rubbish
he's talking. - I'm sorry.

54
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,980
Thank you.

55
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:24,388
Director!

56
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,591
Sir! Save me!

57
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,758
Hindi Film!

58
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,961
'I love you.'

59
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,027
'I love you limitlessly.'

60
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,570
'I'm your hero.'

61
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,038
Cut. What's he doing?

62
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:39,875
And now,
the next one's for the missus.

63
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,712
Don't. Stop it.

64
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,784
Wife asked his husband.

65
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,045
Wife asked his husband.

66
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,520
Honestly,
how many have you slept with?

67
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,021
What nonsense. Principal, stop him.

68
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,320
Wife asked his husband.

69
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,523
Honestly,
how many have you slept with?

70
00:06:58,598 --> 00:06:59,963
The husband replied...

71
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:02,496
I slept only with you.

72
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,629
And stayed awake with the rest.
- What is this

73
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,832
Mr. Principal,
did you call us here to humiliate us!

74
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,374
Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:09,965
Cut.

76
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,268
You call that good actor.

77
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:13,607
What are you doing?

78
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,008
Actually, sir...

79
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:16,540
No, no, no, no.

80
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,277
I'm a method actor.

81
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:19,576
One more chance.

82
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,380
Baby!

83
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,346
I see.

84
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:24,947
So, you're a method actor. - Yes.

85
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,254
So, the next scene's your death scene.

86
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,351
Yes sir. - Ready?

87
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,419
Wait.

88
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,794
I've got one more. That was also nice.

89
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:47,676
Hey, Jai!

90
00:07:55,622 --> 00:08:02,653
'The moon hid behind the clouds.'

91
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,488
'With coy...

92
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,427
Thappa!

93
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,728
What are you doing here?
- Keeping an eye.

94
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,635
Sir has put me on guard here.

95
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:15,807
I was just... going for a walk.

96
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:16,937
Through the window.

97
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,808
Seema. Seema. - Oh no.

98
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,973
Colonel, once my daughter Seema...

99
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:27,243
...and your son Major
Pratap's date goes well...

100
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,947
...then, we'll fix their
marriage date as well.

101
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,455
Over and out.

102
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,252
Dear. Offer him tea.

103
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:34,624
Thank you.

104
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:39,391
Seema. We'll soon be good friends.

105
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,465
And hopefully,
we'll soon have our own family.

106
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,403
Listen, Pattu...

107
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,266
Seema. No Pattu.

108
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,498
It's Pratap.

109
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,699
Major Pratap. - Major.

110
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,637
How's the coming 26th of
July for the marriage? - Good.

111
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,815
26th July's an
inauspicious date. - Why?

112
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,778
Mumbai Floods, 26th July.

113
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,417
Tsunami, 26th July.

114
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:00,415
Blasts, 26th July.

115
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:06,914
On 26th July, 1999 the Indian
army recaptured Tiger Hill, Kargil.

116
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,558
Colonel. You can attack
with your wedding battalion...

117
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,790
...on the 26th July.

118
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,628
But... - Over and out.

119
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,256
Dad...

120
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,991
can we? - Of course, son.

121
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,965
No. - Come on, Brigadier.

122
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:20,932
Let them go. They need some space.

123
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,767
Dad, please. - Okay.

124
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,845
Step no.1. Step on the bike.

125
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,906
That's a four.

126
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,313
That's a six...

127
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,680
Oh no. There comes bad luck Thappa.

128
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,318
You know what, Pattu.

129
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:35,979
Every time he opens his mouth...

130
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,451
...something surely goes wrong.
- I see.

131
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,582
Sir, sir, sir...

132
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,217
Is that so? - Madam's...

133
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,459
Step no.2. Hit the engine.

134
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,933
Step no.3.

135
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:52,600
Zoom!

136
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,842
Awesome exit!

137
00:09:58,278 --> 00:09:59,939
Once again she ran away.

138
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:01,640
You're over and you're out! - Sir.

139
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,907
She's run away for the fifth time!
- Fifth time?

140
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:06,611
Yes. Out of space.

141
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,410
She ran away on a rocket.

142
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,019
Uncle. Don't worry.

143
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,985
No matter where she
hides in Sawantwadi.

144
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,723
I will find her.

145
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,987
She isn't in Sawantwadi.

146
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,562
Like always, there's just
one place she runs away to.

147
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:20,690
Goa!

148
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,432
I will have to do something.

149
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:27,837
Otherwise,
I'll be over and out by some civilian.

150
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,543
This is all your fault. - But.

151
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,507
Don't follow me.

152
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,613
Don't.

153
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,316
No.

154
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,942
'Welcome to the love lane.'

155
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,647
'Everything's goes here.'

156
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,828
'Welcome to the love lane.'

157
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,666
'Everything's goes here.'

158
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,041
'Love, flirting and teasing.'

159
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:43,476
'Piercing eyes,
and bowled over hearts.'

160
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:46,444
'The heart's a smart alec.'

161
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,749
'Different for each one.'

162
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:53,087
'Whether it's an Indian beauty,
or a foreign girl.'

163
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,656
'Beware. Get ready.'

164
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,322
'Here comes the prey.'

165
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:30,055
'We can stop heartbeats.'

166
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:34,828
'And also make your heart beat.'

167
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:39,568
'We can pierce your heart.'

168
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,606
'And also pray for well-being.'

169
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,339
'We're in love with every beauty.'

170
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:53,044
'But we're a bit helpless
before our heart.'

171
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,614
'Beware. Get ready.'

172
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:58,316
'Here comes the prey.'

173
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:27,950
'The heart's very stubborn.'

174
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:32,621
'The world's bowed before it.'

175
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:37,319
'Just tell me who you
want to give your heart to.'

176
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,466
'I've everyone's bio-data.'

177
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:45,868
'Think about our holy union.'

178
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:50,704
'Or I can focus on someone else.'

179
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,342
'Beware. Get ready.'

180
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,778
'Here comes the prey.'

181
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,629
Mr. Joseph Furtado.

182
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,804
Yeah, Joseph Furtado.

183
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,797
These days you've
been cutting and ruining.

184
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:25,467
Mr. Furtado,
the saying is 'Cutting and running'.

185
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,012
I know. I know.

186
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,515
But you three have ruined me.

187
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,479
It's been 12 months.

188
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,676
And, you haven't paid my cafe's bills.

189
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,045
I don't know why I ever
allowed you in my cafe.

190
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,649
Must be a bad time. - Shut up.

191
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,727
I will strip you first and beat you.

192
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,317
Mr. Joseph, you can hit him...

193
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:44,294
...but, no need to get romantic.

194
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,661
Why do you want to strip him? - You...

195
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,529
Mr. Furtado. Let it be.

196
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,761
See, your money isn't going anywhere...

197
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,404
Listen, brother,
first you should have some money

198
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:54,871
Only then can it go somewhere.

199
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,965
Look, Sid. Let me tell you.

200
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,044
Why do you keep such friends?

201
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,936
I was a sailor.

202
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,705
I've seen life.

203
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,545
Let me tell you.

204
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,812
Two rotten fishes spoil the pond.

205
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,618
Mr. Furtado,
the proverb's on just one fish.

206
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,987
But, there's two here. - Yes.

207
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:15,226
Pinto. What a unique combo.

208
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,020
One's the brand
ambassador of honestly.

209
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,562
And the other two, are born cheats.

210
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,923
Cheers.

211
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,992
Go ahead, laugh it away.
Shameless people.

212
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,396
You'll get only a week's credit more.
Then, police calling.

213
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,370
After that,
all six fingers will be in butter.

214
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,674
Sir, the proverbs for
just five fingers. - I know.

215
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,440
Extra finger where?

216
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,776
Where? - There.

217
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,646
Yes. - Good!

218
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,952
Shameless boys.

219
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,549
You two can just fool around.

220
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:45,946
What the...

221
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,424
Ms. Josephine. - Hello.

222
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:53,760
Ms. Josephine, the luggage?
- Are you leaving?

223
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,936
This is your luggage,
not mine. - Ours?

224
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,569
Yes. Now, leave my house.

225
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:01,697
Why? - Why?

226
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:02,570
Why?

227
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,768
Because your pocket's are empty.

228
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,845
It's been more than a year...

229
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,312
...you haven't paid
a penny of the rent...

230
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:10,344
Now, come on.

231
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,611
Take your things and out.

232
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:15,645
Ms. Josephine.

233
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,747
Just a few pennies
have made you greedy.

234
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:22,586
So brazen and uptight.

235
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,519
Why, Omi? - Right.

236
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,633
And, you're throwing our luggage out...

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,233
...when we're so attached.

238
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,466
Come on, Jo.

239
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,663
Jo? - Yeah.

240
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:35,536
Jo. Josephine. Jo.

241
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,334
You know, Jai.

242
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:41,038
She's still waiting
for that special someone.

243
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:46,641
And if we leave... No.

244
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:52,387
So, miss. If this is your day,
then it's a big mistake.

245
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:53,890
And anyway, Ms. Josphine.

246
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,257
We'll soon satisfy your desires?

247
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:57,788
Right? - Yeah.

248
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,326
Ms. Josephine,
he means fulfil your demands.

249
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:03,932
Look, Ms. Josephine.

250
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:08,299
Like always, you're always right,
and we're totally wrong.

251
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,933
We're just saying,
give us a little time.

252
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:14,946
But the time...

253
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:18,878
Sid, for a change use your mouth.

254
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,318
You always speak from the heart.

255
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:23,821
Silly boy.

256
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,855
Ms. Josephine, our luggage...
- Your clothes are so dirty.

257
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:31,353
I'll get it washed,
ironed and send it back.

258
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,858
Oh... thank you.

259
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,699
See. - But rent,
next week without fail.

260
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:37,701
Yes.

261
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,634
Absolutely. - Right.

262
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:40,668
Jo.

263
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,767
'Welcome to the love lane.'

264
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,906
'Everything goes here.'

265
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,791
Bank balance's zero,
but we earned a million today. - How?

266
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,450
We're safe.

267
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:04,722
And a life saved, is a million earned.

268
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,197
And Jai, Sid, Omi come back.

269
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,259
Don't follow me.

270
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,600
Mom, is Seema at that bookworm's home?

271
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,467
You two are impossible.

272
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,731
One's a teacher, other's a dictator.

273
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,436
And we three wife,
daughter and mother...

274
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,544
...get stuck in your fights.

275
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,637
Mom. I'll talk to that
Alkaline Acid. - Wait.

276
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,444
Mom, give me the phone. - Wait.

277
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:27,350
Mom, give me the phone... - Mom!

278
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:29,683
Watch.

279
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,382
Now Chandrakant and Suryakant...

280
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,925
...will fight the third world war.

281
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,753
Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,954
So, you were slapped. - Yes, I was.

283
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:43,392
Tell me, Santru. - I don't say,
only give orders, Chiku.

284
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:46,833
Then go order some
snacks in a restaurant.

285
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,604
Chiku. You've no
etiquettes or manners.

286
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,937
I've mom.

287
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,375
Mom. Mom. - Let go.

288
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:53,935
Mom...

289
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:55,338
Mom!

290
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:56,678
Where did she come from?

291
00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:00,708
The same place you did. - Yes, I did.

292
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,412
Don't forget, I'm elder to you.

293
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,184
Only by a minute.

294
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,351
The value of a minute,
ask a Olympic runner.

295
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:12,361
The value of a minute,
ask the slice of bread in a toaster.

296
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,996
Ask the pizza boy,
that delivers after 29 minutes.

297
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,566
Give the phone to my
daughter Seema in a minute.

298
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,536
Go give orders on the border.

299
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,369
Not to my niece Seema. - Shut up.

300
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,240
Seema's my daughter,
and she'll marry a army officer.

301
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,405
Over and out.

302
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:33,282
Seema's my niece,
and she'll marry a civilian.

303
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:34,613
Without any doubt.

304
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,914
Army. - Civilian.

305
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,387
Army. - Civilian.

306
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,980
Army. - Army.

307
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,352
Civilian... I mean...

308
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,223
He's over and out.

309
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,590
Red litmus turning into blue litmus.

310
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,598
Awesome. - Wow.

311
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:49,799
Me too. - Mom.

312
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:04,881
It goes like this.

313
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,418
The moon's so cruel with us.

314
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,575
As children we see uncle...

315
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,714
...and later, we see our beloved in it.

316
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,893
Jai! Come soon.

317
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,451
There's a prey.

318
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,327
Coming! Coming! Coming!

319
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,492
Prey? Where?

320
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,760
My friend, it goes like this.

321
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:26,794
Who says heaven's up above, look down.

322
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:30,900
Photo.

323
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,872
Did the battery have to die now?

324
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,548
Let's go 9 to 11. - That's 9 to 12.

325
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,510
These days Hindi films
only run for two hours.

326
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:42,678
Fine, you can sit here
and watch the film, I'm going.

327
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,331
Here I come, baby.

328
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,369
Sid. For God sake, take a look.

329
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,835
But first,
let's see where Jai is. - What?

330
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:03,269
Look. - Traitor.

331
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,411
I hope you meet with an accident.

332
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:11,274
I curse you. - Bye.

333
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,581
Jai, you dog.

334
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,704
Salute me, I say.

335
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,476
Oh no, he's too cute.

336
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:48,479
The good news is,
I know where that girl lives.

337
00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:51,621
There's a granny-granny, doggy-doggy...

338
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,682
...and a old-old man between us.

339
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:57,027
Jai! Jai! Jai! - Yeah.

340
00:21:57,296 --> 00:22:00,060
I saw her first. I'm her hero.

341
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,700
First, rise to the
level of ajunior artist.

342
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:07,396
I make the website
and you want the hits!

343
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:08,336
Idiot fellow.

344
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:09,499
You'll regret it, Jai.

345
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,564
Get lost.

346
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:11,803
Hey!

347
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:14,938
Don't fight.

348
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,344
You both give it a try.

349
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:24,885
But the question still remains,
who will try first.

350
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:27,848
Obviously, me.

351
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,026
Who will try first?

352
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:33,456
I will give you a solution for that.

353
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,589
Coin? - Toss.

354
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,030
Just a minute.

355
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,599
So, Jai. Heads.

356
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:38,794
And Omi? - Tails.

357
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,496
Right.

358
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:43,836
Yes.

359
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,509
So, Jai. - Yes.

360
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,812
You will sit at home,
and Omi will go first. - No.

361
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,006
No - Because here are heads.

362
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,510
That's cheating. - Be fair.

363
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:52,641
He saw the girl first.

364
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:53,843
Come on. Don't be a sissy.

365
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,978
Omi, you rascal...

366
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,588
I hope no one saw that. No.

367
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:19,570
Yes.

368
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:24,509
'You could've at least
let me ask the question.'

369
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:25,877
'Why say yes first.'

370
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,652
Hello. Who are you?

371
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:33,018
All credit goes to the Almighty,
that made this dude.

372
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,817
Sometimes I look at you,
and sometimes...

373
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,892
...I hear your dog bark.

374
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,855
Actually, I am...
- Thank God you're here.

375
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,059
Come in.

376
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:45,329
Hello. - Hurry up.

377
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,864
So... - Nice.

378
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,442
So... shall we begin?

379
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:56,608
Like, now?
- Yes, now's the right time.

380
00:23:56,682 --> 00:24:00,675
Relax on the bed,
I'll be back from the bathroom.

381
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,948
Just a minute. - Okay. I'll wait.

382
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:06,989
What the...

383
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,383
Come here.

384
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,327
The dog trainer's finally
here. Learn to behave. Come.

385
00:24:11,797 --> 00:24:13,822
Okay. Let me see.

386
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,904
Abra-cada-bra.

387
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:30,006
From Thailand to Brazil,
everything's here.

388
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,882
There's no wedding or night.

389
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:37,888
But, the feelings still right...

390
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,487
Believe it or not,
every dog has his day.

391
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:46,924
Don't be scared.

392
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:50,662
He bites only sometimes? - Sometimes?

393
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,666
He's your student, Aryabhatt.

394
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,468
And Aryabhatt,
this is your new dog trainer.

395
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,769
Say hello.

396
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,803
Dog trainer. No...

397
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,204
I'm giving you Aryabhatt's
favourite toy...

398
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:05,306
...and you can control
him with it. Okay.

399
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:06,973
All the best.

400
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,484
Okay.

401
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,022
Keep away! Keep away!

402
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,800
No, no!

403
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,859
No!

404
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,728
Who are you?

405
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:29,364
Aunty, save me!

406
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:41,349
'Aaryabhatt leave my butt.'

407
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:47,823
By the way, Omi's the
one who must be hanging, right.

408
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:50,887
You dog...

409
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:53,655
No, no dog.

410
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,493
Mister.

411
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,759
Welcome.

412
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:03,740
So, she met me like 'Heer'(lover).

413
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:07,204
And she tasted like 'Kheer'(sweet).

414
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:10,707
And pierced my heart
like a 'teer'(Arrow).

415
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:11,840
Be honest now.

416
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:15,978
Did she drive you away
like a 'fakir'(begger)?

417
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:18,612
That's fine.

418
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,022
Logically, you two should be jealous.

419
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:24,457
But, biologically I am on cloud no.9.

420
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:28,526
Because physical seduction
is equal to good health.

421
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,662
What happened? Tell us.

422
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,727
Everything that you can imagine.

423
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,400
Let me take you back in flashback.

424
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:37,966
Up there, there.

425
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:54,849
Yes.

426
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,352
You Could've at least
let me ask the question.

427
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,286
Why say yes first.

428
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:02,330
I don't get it.

429
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,565
You?

430
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,936
I'm your distant neighbour.

431
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:11,541
Actually, I came here for some sugar.

432
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,505
For free.

433
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:18,248
I've heard that
sugar-free is in demand.

434
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,781
You're too funny.

435
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,511
You've a way with words.

436
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,856
It goes like this.

437
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:29,488
If you wear a red
bindi on a white sari.

438
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,024
You'll definitely
look like an ambulance.

439
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,692
You're very innovative, I must say.

440
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,000
Then how about an innovative
friendship, says my crazy heart.

441
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:42,972
Because, as we know.

442
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,741
The best item in the
friendship is to be... one.

443
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,844
Oh my.

444
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:53,441
No. It's Omi. - Omi.

445
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,626
Aryabhatt. Shut up.

446
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:04,517
It's okay.

447
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,554
Stay.

448
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,358
Sit.

449
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:12,898
Fetch.

450
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:26,540
I've seen love in my beloved's eyes.

451
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:36,359
Now my restless heart's
finally at peace.

452
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:48,338
Sweetheart,
I was so eager to see you.

453
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:55,977
Now my restless heart's
finally at peace.

454
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,921
She was a bomb, and she blew me away.

455
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,957
She was a bomb, and she blew me away.

456
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:17,464
Without halting at any station,
this slow train flew away.

457
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:18,999
Hey.

458
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:20,238
What's this on your neck?

459
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,330
Seems like something bit you.

460
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,208
Love-bite.

461
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,943
She was a dog.

462
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,280
Anyway, you will
know once you grow-up.

463
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,216
Don't stop me, I'm going.

464
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,447
What about you, Jai?

465
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:41,353
He broke all records on first day,
first show.

466
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,385
If she can be bowled over by Omi.

467
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,859
She'll go bow-wow when she sees me.

468
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,964
Don't say 'bow-wow'. - Why?

469
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:54,437
No. Nothing. - Nothing.

470
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,465
Yours was just the teaser, Omi.

471
00:29:56,808 --> 00:30:01,302
Just watch what happens...

472
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:04,279
...when I will tease her.

473
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,753
Baby's bike.

474
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,450
Baby's doggy.

475
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,256
Baby's bungalow.

476
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,528
Baby's background.

477
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,802
Baby's tattoo.

478
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,544
Her size zero puts all other to shame.

479
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:39,549
What a beauty.

480
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,685
Who are you calling a beauty? - Wow!

481
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,077
You.

482
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:46,886
You're past the age of dying...

483
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:50,052
...but, still look like
the Kingfisher model.

484
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:51,527
Like they say.

485
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,461
Treasures are found in the ruins.

486
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,759
Who are you? - Jai.

487
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:56,856
Not the one from Sholay.

488
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:59,597
But, the same name and personality.

489
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,329
Hello, hello.

490
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:02,998
I'm a producer-director.

491
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:05,373
I was visiting a friend,
when he said...

492
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:07,434
...a innocent girl's moved
into our neighbourhood. - Oh.

493
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,979
Sweet, cute, charming.

494
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,778
Just like the one I am
looking for my blockbuster film.

495
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,875
I think my friend was right, because...

496
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:17,649
...I can surely make
baby with you. - What?

497
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,552
I mean, I can surely
produce baby with you.

498
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,649
The title of my film's 'Baby'.

499
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,557
He's just a Baby.

500
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,391
Who's the baby, Seema?

501
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:28,899
Uncle. He's a film director-producer.

502
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:30,832
He's here to see me.

503
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,460
Welcome. Welcome.

504
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,066
Welcome wasn't my film, sir.

505
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,535
I only make heroine oriented films.

506
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,839
I can see what you're making.

507
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,576
But, have you ever made action films.

508
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:44,709
With my mom in the lead role.

509
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,948
Mom. Salutations. Action.

510
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,678
Mother!

511
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:52,948
Son. Take my screen-test too.

512
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:54,013
Come on.

513
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,428
Whether Karan-Arjun returns or not.

514
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,430
Doesn't matter, get it.

515
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:02,830
Because I can handle you alone.

516
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:06,267
Make a film, will you?
Cast my grand-daughter as the heroine.

517
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,839
Old hag. - You call me a old hag.

518
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,805
Beat him. - You call me a old hag.

519
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,740
Old hag is your mother!

520
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:14,505
Old hag is your mother!

521
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,547
Let go.

522
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:20,448
Old hag is your mother!

523
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:23,510
Old hag is your mother!

524
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:25,351
Leave me.

525
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,913
Leave. - Leave Old hag.

526
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:31,486
Leave and Let go.

527
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:33,558
Uncle.

528
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,635
Mom, he called you old,
why did that upset you? - Shut up!

529
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:39,965
Mom.

530
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,406
Help me, guys.

531
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,071
Jai! Jai! Jai! - Omi.

532
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,747
I can see darkness before my eyes.

533
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,450
Jai! Jai! Jai! What happened, Jai?

534
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,782
He went to fix his chemistry,
but ruined his geography.

535
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,089
Sid! Sid!

536
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,896
Don't judge a film by its poster.

537
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,698
What?

538
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:12,562
I mean, hear my flashback.

539
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,863
I mean, see it.

540
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,353
You? - Jai.

541
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,455
Not the one from Sholay.

542
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,490
But, the same name and personality.

543
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:40,756
Exactly.

544
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,457
I am so sorry to barge
in on you like this.

545
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:45,365
I'm a producer, director.

546
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,563
I was visiting a friend,
when he said...

547
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:49,296
...a innocent girl's moved
into our neighbourhood. - Oh.

548
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,504
Sweet, cute, charming.

549
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:55,406
Just like the one I am
looking for my blockbuster film.

550
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,878
Film! Fine.

551
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:57,777
Uncle!

552
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:00,043
Sir, do you really think my mom...

553
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,913
My niece can be a heroine?

554
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:09,449
When she's got the eyes of Sonakshi,
grace of Kareena...

555
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,495
...and the style of Deepika.

556
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,690
She's got to be the
heroine of my film.

557
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:17,028
By the way, you will have
to wear a swimming suit in my film.

558
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:20,834
Why? - Because I don't
want my film to sink.

559
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,307
Just once...

560
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:26,540
Once I capture you
in my room... - Room?

561
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:29,545
In my camera.
Capture you in my camera.

562
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,245
Because, baby.

563
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,418
I will take a screen-test.

564
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:36,310
Lights.

565
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:37,745
Camera.

566
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:38,846
Action.

567
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:40,691
Hello.

568
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:41,817
Hello.

569
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,359
Yeah!

570
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,895
What is mobile number?

571
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,661
What is style number?

572
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,699
I want to talk privately.

573
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,795
What is your private number.

574
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:58,034
Where do you go,
darling, where do you come from?

575
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:02,235
Why do you always torment my heart?

576
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,875
What is your style number?

577
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,746
What number should I dial?

578
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,718
We can meet easily then.

579
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:10,880
Give me some easy number,

580
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:14,950
Where do you go,
darling, where do you come from?

581
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,923
Why do you always torment my heart?

582
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:32,571
After that, ooh! Aah! Ouch!

583
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,342
Why say it?

584
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:35,470
Show us.

585
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,341
There's something called as censor.

586
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,050
What next?

587
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,913
Next? - Meaning.

588
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:43,845
Meaning.

589
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:46,549
I mean, the girl's given
a green signal to you both.

590
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:49,491
How are you going to decide now?

591
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:55,562
"My pant's torn!

592
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,398
Don't hit me.

593
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,437
No! - What no?

594
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,273
I mean... I don't want that girl.

595
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,639
Jai, my friend.

596
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:09,839
The path's clear for you.

597
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:11,682
No, my friend.

598
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,780
You can have that girl.

599
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,883
The girl's all yours.

600
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,784
My friend. I've many more.

601
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:18,913
You can have her.

602
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:21,389
Jai, you take the girl.
- Omi, listen to me.

603
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,017
Jai, you... - Omi...

604
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:24,489
Jai...

605
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,863
This hatred between us for a girl.

606
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,857
It's not worth it. - No.

607
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:31,902
And anyway, we can never handle...

608
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:34,632
...such an uptight girl. - No.

609
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:36,733
So...

610
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:40,538
When you can't change the girl,
change the girl.

611
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:44,503
From today, we'll never
talk about that girl... again!

612
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:49,713
Sid. We two have retired.

613
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:52,348
Maybe you can take a wild-card entry.

614
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,550
A girl like her, never.

615
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:02,960
Grandma.

616
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:08,464
Welcome.

617
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,704
You're Pattu, right.
- No, grandma. Pratap.

618
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:14,539
Right. Go, go. Bless you.

619
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:16,608
But, how do you know me?

620
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,511
Very easy. Seema told me. - I see.

621
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,347
If the face's not like curdled milk...

622
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:25,479
...and, the gait's not like a lizard.

623
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,420
THen, that is Pattu.

624
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:27,423
Look. - Yes.

625
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,823
Your son's asked
me to bring Seema back.

626
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:32,692
Where's she? - She ran away.

627
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,254
Come I'll show you - She ran away.

628
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:35,796
Look.

629
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:41,971
You know, grandma.

630
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,873
She looks really cute
when she's running away.

631
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,740
Were you a dog in your earlier birth?

632
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:48,710
Why? - No.

633
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,611
She fooled you so easily.

634
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,283
Seema.

635
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:58,946
Yes, mom.
I'm driving right now, can't talk.

636
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,354
The police will catch me.

637
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,683
Yes, I'm on my way to meet her.

638
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:03,886
Bye.

639
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:16,440
Hey, Michael Shoemaker.

640
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:20,738
Hey. Mind your language.

641
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:21,946
And, what's Shoemaker?

642
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,844
I don't make shoes.
- So, what do you make?

643
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:24,904
Socks?

644
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,780
Look, you're talking
to a army officer.

645
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,820
And you are talking to a common man.

646
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:32,983
See how we common people live here.

647
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,224
What do you people think?

648
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:39,421
You can just run over us.
- He's got guts.

649
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:41,330
He's a dude.

650
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:45,767
And Pattu. You'll always be a coward.

651
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,601
Get lost. - Get going.

652
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,503
Where do they come from?

653
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,810
Listen. Where you a drum
in your last life? - Why?

654
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:54,538
Because, I just played you.

655
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:59,474
Stop. Stop.

656
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,685
Stop if you got the guts.

657
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:13,996
Yes, mom. I just reached.

658
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:17,760
Yes, Seema Agarwal. Yes, you told me.

659
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:23,967
Hi.

660
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,571
Siddharth. - Oh, hi.

661
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,343
Seema.

662
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,706
Don't stand there.
Just block it and sit. - Block what?

663
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:33,717
Block the seat. - I see.

664
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:38,815
Your order sir.

665
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,324
One veg-grilled sandwich and coffee...

666
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:42,559
Okay.

667
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,527
Actually,
two veg-grilled sandwich and coffee...

668
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:46,722
Okay. - This is very funny.

669
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:48,763
Get it. - Okay, sir.

670
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,492
Okay.

671
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,767
Nice bike.

672
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,871
Actually, that's one
thing that cheaper than car...

673
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,704
...but, maintains style statement.

674
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,971
More than that,
it always comes in handy.

675
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,513
It helped me run away
from home five times.

676
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,878
Helped you run away?

677
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,278
Yes. - You ran away from home.

678
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,547
Why? - My dad was forcing
me in arranged marriage.

679
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:11,254
And I hate arranged marriages.

680
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,916
You hate arranged marriages,
so what are you doing here?

681
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:15,725
Like I said,
I hate arranged marriages.

682
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:16,760
So, I ran away.

683
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,023
You ran away,
you hate arranged marriages.

684
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:21,424
You ran away again.
I don't understand.

685
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,995
Seeing your carefree attitude...

686
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:29,069
...I feel, your star-sign's Leo.
- Bang on.

687
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,566
Awesome, boss.

688
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,039
Now let me guess.

689
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,572
Capricorn?

690
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:36,405
Actually, people don't
believe me when I say this.

691
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:38,881
You might be shocked to hear this.

692
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,645
But... Cancer.

693
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,544
Oh. - Very sorry to hear that, sir.

694
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,417
But... no one could avert death.

695
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:55,297
He actually thought that I...
had cancer.

696
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,367
I know. Funny man.

697
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:58,862
Anyway.

698
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:00,935
By the way...

699
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:02,700
...what's your problem
with arranged marriages?

700
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:06,938
How can someone choose a life-partner
over a coffee and sandwich.

701
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:11,943
People say, all you need
is a look to fall in love.

702
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:12,944
Look.

703
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,644
Those people are dumb.

704
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,615
Actually, if they say
something out of the world...

705
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:18,882
...in the first meeting, then maybe...

706
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,355
Out of the world.

707
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,415
Out of the world... Okay.

708
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:24,017
Let me try.
Let's rewind.

709
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:25,456
Just give me some time.

710
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:38,500
Hi.

711
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:40,975
Siddharth Kashyap.

712
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,713
May I? - Yes.

713
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:48,842
So, would you like
to hang-out with me...

714
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:50,513
...for the rest of your life.

715
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:52,319
Baby.

716
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,020
Awesome, boss.

717
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,451
Let me try too.

718
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:57,357
I see.

719
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,861
Wait, let me take position.

720
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:06,267
Hi, I am Seema Ranjan.

721
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:09,368
Hi, Seema... Ranjan?

722
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,267
Seema Ranjan?

723
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,679
You aren't Seema Agarwal? - No.

724
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:18,382
Doesn't make a difference.

725
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:19,438
I don't like both the names.

726
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:20,506
Excuse me.

727
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:22,744
Siddharth.

728
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,616
Seema. Agarwal.

729
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,250
That means,
I was mistaking Seema 1 for Seema 2.

730
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:31,693
Oh... who did you think I was? - Sid.

731
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:34,731
I am Sid.
- So, that's who I thought you are.

732
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,858
Siddharth,
I am the Seema you're looking for...

733
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:38,765
...but, I can't be your Seema.

734
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:42,361
Actually... - Actually,
you must love someone else, right.

735
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,006
Fine. You can go love or do anything.

736
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,641
Just a second.

737
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,538
Mom.

738
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,840
Yes, mom.

739
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:55,077
Your Seema's... not that special, mom.

740
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,758
Fine. - Thank you so much.

741
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:04,021
Go get married.
- Thank you so much, Siddharth.

742
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:05,753
Pattu.

743
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:11,763
Bye. - Don't forget to invite me.
I'll sing a song for you.

744
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:14,832
Destiny.

745
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,635
You...

746
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:20,341
Seema.

747
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:23,777
Everything's haywire.

748
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:32,848
Who says you can't fall in
love over a sandwich and coffee?

749
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:35,023
It's possible.

750
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:41,994
Early morning.

751
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:47,632
Early morning.

752
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:50,572
When she smiled at the window.

753
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:55,911
And showed her charming face.

754
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,280
It slipped.

755
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,817
My heart slipped from my hand.

756
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,819
She's so wonderful.

757
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,855
My mind's filled with her image.

758
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:07,652
It's my first romance.

759
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:09,589
I've a slight chance.

760
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,421
My heart's staggering.

761
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:17,801
Her eyes are so intoxicating.

762
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:21,630
She's makes my heart beat.

763
00:44:21,906 --> 00:44:25,433
Take some tips from the experts.

764
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:29,612
If you fail you'll be...

765
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:49,262
Early morning.

766
00:45:09,754 --> 00:45:16,318
Every time I call her darling,
she feels coy.

767
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:23,593
Each time I say kiss me,
she shows attitude.

768
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:31,499
She says welcome and takes me home.

769
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,303
She's a bit arrogant.

770
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:36,512
But, she's still mine.

771
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,376
It's my first romance.

772
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,006
I've a slight chance.

773
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:44,318
My heart's staggering.

774
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:50,249
Her eyes are so intoxicating.

775
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:53,927
She's makes my heart beat.

776
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:57,789
Take some tips from the experts.

777
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:01,961
If you fail you'll be...

778
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:26,823
Yahoo messenger was no help.

779
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:35,237
No message on the BBM either.

780
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:41,845
I searched her on Facebook,
but no use.

781
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:45,041
She's got a little attitude.

782
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:47,341
But she's still cute.

783
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:48,975
It's my first romance.

784
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:50,948
I've a slight chance.

785
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:55,651
My heart's staggering.

786
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:00,862
Her eyes are so intoxicating.

787
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:04,628
She's makes my heart beat.

788
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:08,501
Take some tips from the experts.

789
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:12,608
If you fail you'll be...

790
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:31,854
Early morning.

791
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:42,529
I'll see you. - See you.

792
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,540
Bye. - Madam, please spare something.

793
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,365
I haven't eaten
anything for four days.

794
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:47,535
Here.

795
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:49,470
God bless you.

796
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,876
God, I wish I had the same will-power.

797
00:47:53,484 --> 00:47:55,452
I really need to go on a diet.

798
00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:57,280
Tighten the blade's screw.

799
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:59,652
It's the biggest bad luck in the cafe.

800
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:01,482
Doesn't work 30 days a week.

801
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,719
Rubbish. - Only seven
days in a week, Joseph.

802
00:48:03,794 --> 00:48:04,761
I know.

803
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:07,422
But, a week in the
summer is equal to a month.

804
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,224
Fine, I'll do it right now.

805
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:11,865
See, it's done.

806
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,243
Stop. - Yes.

807
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,750
Look, it's raining.

808
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,850
It's raining.
It's raining. It's raining.

809
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,955
Look. Mr. Joseph and Ms. Josephine.

810
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,262
They're exchanging
romantic looks at this age.

811
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:25,200
Jai, if we bring them together...

812
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,210
Then, we'll food,
shelter and clothing.

813
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,569
What?

814
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,582
I mean, we get free food at the cafe.

815
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,750
And the landlady will give us shelter.

816
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:38,847
And, we're already wearing clothes.

817
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,016
You two... are bad.

818
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,592
The heart's in love.

819
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,255
Omi!

820
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:26,564
Joseph sir.

821
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,735
Put this out to dry.

822
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:30,939
And start this up.

823
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,837
Sir. Today's Sunday.

824
00:50:35,012 --> 00:50:38,004
How can I forget what day is today?

825
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:40,006
Shall we call the police?

826
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:43,875
No, police. Call the priest.

827
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:47,016
Sir. Sid, Omi,
Jai were supposed to pay up today.

828
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:49,983
Thank God you reminded me.

829
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:54,290
But, they must be hiding
in a burrow to escape me.

830
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,896
I'll have to look all over Goa.

831
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:58,966
Sir, but how.

832
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:03,403
Pinto. I'll check every place twice.

833
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,031
Sir, no need. - Why?

834
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:07,910
Look who is coming?

835
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:11,343
Jai. - Not the one from Sholay.

836
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,508
But, the same name and personality.

837
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:17,885
Jai. Get ready to go to jail.

838
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:21,618
Years passby, but its
difficult to pass every moment.

839
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:23,053
Forget about going to jail.

840
00:51:23,427 --> 00:51:26,988
Sid and Omi's sent me here
to talk about money. - Really?

841
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:28,725
Oh, that reminds me.

842
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:30,526
I'm so dumb...

843
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:33,632
Someone's sent a message for you.

844
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:34,830
Message? Who?

845
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:39,975
The one... you gave shelter to.

846
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,806
Outside the church.

847
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:43,278
My fair lady.

848
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,672
She's our... landlady. - What?

849
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,978
Yes.

850
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:50,510
What do I say, Mr. Furt.

851
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:52,783
Smiles like Madhuri.

852
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:54,754
Juhi's magic.

853
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:57,583
Sridevi's mischief.

854
00:51:57,728 --> 00:52:00,595
And, covered Mallika Sherawat.

855
00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:01,824
Yes.

856
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,435
And her name's Josephine.

857
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:10,339
But, your name's just like hers.

858
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:12,032
What?

859
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:17,307
Joseph. - Ine.

860
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:20,542
What? His name's Joseph? - Yes.

861
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:22,945
Not just Joseph. There's Furtado too.

862
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:24,411
Joseph Furtado.

863
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:26,251
And, he's also said...

864
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:29,724
...he apologises for
any mistake he's made.

865
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:34,657
Clear your mind of any misconception.

866
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,528
Writer-poet type.

867
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:41,366
He's sent a gift for you. - Gift?

868
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:42,735
Gift? - Gift?

869
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:43,830
Yes. - Pinto.

870
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:44,771
Yes.

871
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,969
Get pizza, sandwiches,
diet coke, pastries, get everything.

872
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,571
Old hag is your mother!

873
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:52,840
What's this?

874
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:54,780
That was hard... - What?

875
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:56,951
Ms. Josephine. Was after me.

876
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,021
So, that I give this to you.

877
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:00,317
Black belt.

878
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,259
Sweet, Josephine.

879
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,219
Her nickname's Jo.

880
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:07,953
Jo.

881
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,862
Jo. - Jo.

882
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:13,595
When it's destiny.

883
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,798
It cannot be averted.

884
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:21,308
Good. Very good.

885
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:26,506
I'll never forget his kind gesture.

886
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,853
It's not worth forgetting.

887
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:35,814
Ms. Josephine, the rent money...
- Let it be.

888
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:37,393
Money's not important.

889
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:38,961
Today, tomorrow,
you can give it any time.

890
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:39,996
Ms. Josephine.

891
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:42,424
Same to same.

892
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:45,630
You and Mr. Joseph think so similarly.

893
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:48,563
He said the same thing. - What?

894
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:50,367
Money's not important.

895
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:55,440
Today, tomorrow,
you can give it any time.

896
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:56,945
Thank you, Mr. Joseph. - It's okay.

897
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:59,778
We've to still pay Ms.
Josephine's one year rent.

898
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:00,975
And to adjust that...

899
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:02,412
Pay Jo rent.

900
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:04,579
Hold it. Hold it.

901
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:10,255
You give this to Jo on your behalf.

902
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:13,257
But, how can I take this money,
Mr. Joseph.

903
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:16,662
You're good for nothing.
You can't pay her.

904
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,027
But the proverb's wrong, sir.

905
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:22,761
I know. But, his condition's worse.
- Correct.

906
00:54:22,906 --> 00:54:24,669
Keep this. - Thanks, Jo.

907
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:26,640
Ms. Josephine.

908
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,673
Take this.
We can't take money from you.

909
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:31,006
You please keep this.
We'll manage. - Okay.

910
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:35,415
Just don't tell anyone about this.

911
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,419
This gift, at this age.

912
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:41,253
Jo. - Ms.
Josephine, I don't know what this is.

913
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:45,424
But, if this is love...
then love sees no age.

914
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:48,393
Only courage, and bondage... - Bondage.

915
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:51,925
And cleavage. And marriage.

916
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:08,340
The heart's fallen in love.

917
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,018
The heart's fallen in love. - Yes.

918
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:18,950
Sir.

919
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,394
Sir, sorry. - Don't scare me.

920
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,694
What's wrong with your car?
- Can I help?

921
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,393
I've been maintaining it for 20 years.

922
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,025
But, it lets me down every day.

923
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,600
Each day I request
it to take me home...

924
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,300
...but, it takes me
to the garage instead.

925
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:33,601
Forget it, sir. I'll drop you.

926
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:34,473
Really? - Yes.

927
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:35,977
That's very kind of you.

928
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,246
7th Youth Colony.

929
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:42,250
7th Youth Colony? - Yes.

930
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,946
That means,
we aren't just teacher-student...

931
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,886
...but, also neighbours
for the past two years.

932
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:47,423
Love thy neighbour.

933
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,753
Let's go.

934
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,627
What are you doing?
- Sir, sit comfortably.

935
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:53,026
You're taking quite sharp turns.

936
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:54,625
Any turning points in your life?

937
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:56,632
Come on. I'm not your
professor outside college.

938
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,962
Come on, tell me.

939
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:00,662
Sir, I did meet one,
but we didn't meet again.

940
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:03,262
If she's in your destiny,
she'll be in your life.

941
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:05,634
You think so, sir. - Of course.

942
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,343
It's a nice ride.

943
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:09,442
Careful. Careful.

944
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,447
Steps ahead. Careful. Stop, stop.

945
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:14,346
Sir, I told you to hold on tight.
The ground's a bit tricky.

946
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:16,010
Life is tricky, my friend.

947
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:19,485
How about a cup of coffee? - Now?

948
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:22,984
Coffee and slaps
are my mom's speciality.

949
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:24,557
I see. - So, let's ride.

950
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:26,755
So, will I get slapped...
- You have coffee...

951
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:27,728
...l'll take the slaps.

952
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,633
Mom, hide me in your veil. - Harder.

953
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:35,600
Take me in your arms. - Fine.

954
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,339
Sir, you... in a army uniform.

955
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:46,245
I must say, you're quite photogenic.

956
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:48,841
You're looking much
more handsome in this photo.

957
00:56:49,386 --> 00:56:51,251
No. That's not him.

958
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:53,589
That's my other son. Twin.

959
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:57,023
Twins. - Yes,
but there's nothing special about him.

960
00:56:57,427 --> 00:57:01,227
He looks like H2o,
and his mind's like H2So4.

961
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:03,322
Sulphuric acid? - Sulphuric acid.

962
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:05,663
They've the same blood group.
- O positive, mom.

963
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,000
Quiet. Not because they're twins.

964
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:11,600
It's because they're always
sucking on each other's blood.

965
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:13,641
Look, grandma,
let me tell you one thing...

966
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,234
Grandma...

967
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:24,583
You here? - You here?

968
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:26,653
You two know each other.

969
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:29,692
Sir, she's the one I met,
and couldn't meet again.

970
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:33,991
She's the one you met,
and couldn't meet again.

971
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,888
And, we meet again.

972
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:48,743
You... - I... I was just...

973
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:51,946
Eat it.

974
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:54,741
Mom.

975
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:09,722
Chiku, shut up. - Mom, you be quiet.

976
00:58:09,933 --> 00:58:11,195
We've found a civilian.

977
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,533
Santru. Now I'll teach you a lesson.

978
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:16,231
Chiku.

979
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:17,534
Uncle. - Chiku.

980
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:20,767
Find out, what he earns?
What post he's at?

981
00:58:20,844 --> 00:58:22,937
Mom, the important
thing is he's a civilian.

982
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,247
He's a genius in studies.

983
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,576
He'll surely get ajob.

984
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:28,578
Seema. Don't just stand there.

985
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:30,916
Flirt with him.

986
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:34,252
You're done for, Santru.

987
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:36,325
Shall we? - Let's go.

988
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:48,701
Fantastic food here.

989
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:50,433
Let me introduce you to Mr. Furtado.

990
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,972
Hey, Mr. Furtado. How are you?

991
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:56,342
Siddharth, how are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

992
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:58,472
Mr. Furtado, I want you to meet Seema.

993
00:58:58,615 --> 00:59:00,674
Hello, young lady. - Hi.

994
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,816
You know my dear, I would like to say.

995
00:59:08,525 --> 00:59:11,619
You two look coochie-coochie
and cute-cute.

996
00:59:11,895 --> 00:59:13,624
By the way, can I say something?

997
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:14,925
You and Ms. Josephine...

998
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,523
...will also look really coochie-coochie
and cute-cute together.

999
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:20,529
So, you told her? - What could I do?

1000
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:22,968
You weren't telling Ms.
Josephine. - What?

1001
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:27,403
You're the one,
my heart's stuck on. - What?

1002
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:28,769
Yes, Ms. Josephine.

1003
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:30,938
When will you tell Mr.
Joseph about your feelings?

1004
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:33,282
When Karan Johar stop
inviting people for coffee?

1005
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:35,576
When Ram Gopal Verma
directs a romantic film?

1006
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:37,877
When Mallika Sherawat
starts wearing full clothes?

1007
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:39,979
These days you're
pulling my leg a lot.

1008
00:59:40,223 --> 00:59:42,316
Fine, but why are you pulling my ears?

1009
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:45,418
Because, I... I didn't even
have a proper meeting with him.

1010
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:47,921
Then go ahead.

1011
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:49,656
Come on.

1012
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:50,961
Pinto. Get it.

1013
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:53,566
I'll solve your problem.

1014
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:55,796
Thank you.

1015
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:59,570
Once she accepts my gift...

1016
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:02,271
...then, I'm ready to
say those four magical words.

1017
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:05,004
There are three magic words, right?

1018
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:06,237
Yes, Mr. Furtado.

1019
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:08,876
I Love You. - Correct. Correct.

1020
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,886
But, I won't say it first.

1021
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:16,453
When she says I love you,
I will say I Love You Too.

1022
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:17,754
Four words, Mr. Furtado.

1023
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:19,624
Awesome. Like that.

1024
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,364
So, what are you thinking, Ms.
Josephine.

1025
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:25,466
Just go with him and
have some dinner and wine.

1026
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:27,799
Go, Simran. Live your life.

1027
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:29,863
Be his valentine. - No.

1028
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,464
How can I just straightaway?

1029
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:33,472
I just started to know him.

1030
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:37,747
And those who are in
love celebrate valentine.

1031
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:39,473
Like Sid.

1032
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:41,283
Haven't you noticed him these days?

1033
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:43,011
He says 'bye' instead of 'hi'.

1034
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,720
Eats his breakfast without any break.

1035
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:49,087
And, always wears a
glossy smile on his face.

1036
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,348
Like he's...

1037
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:52,392
He's found a new love.

1038
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,488
Sid?

1039
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:56,593
He didn't tell us anything.

1040
01:00:56,666 --> 01:01:00,796
Who's the girl for whom he's
broken the bonds of friendship?

1041
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:01,928
She's who?

1042
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:04,273
Who? - Who?

1043
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:11,877
What? - Exactly our question.

1044
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:12,744
What?

1045
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:15,842
So, what's all this?
There's a girl in your life?

1046
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,545
I was about to tell you.
- Yeah, right.

1047
01:01:19,622 --> 01:01:21,556
But, you thought of telling
us 10-15 years later.

1048
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:23,717
No, no. Come, sit.
I'll tell you. Come.

1049
01:01:24,661 --> 01:01:26,458
Are you taking us in flashback? - Yes.

1050
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:27,924
Show me. - Watch.

1051
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:29,890
A bit higher.

1052
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:38,506
I told you to hold on tighter,
the ground's a bit tricky.

1053
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,504
Seema.

1054
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:44,371
Bye.

1055
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:45,974
Bye.

1056
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:47,948
Seema.

1057
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:50,509
Nothing, I just want to say bye.

1058
01:01:52,055 --> 01:01:53,716
Sid.

1059
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:55,851
Kiss...

1060
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:02,992
I mean... why are you
saying bye so many times?

1061
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,528
Why?

1062
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:09,729
No, I just meant it's nice to say bye.

1063
01:02:09,806 --> 01:02:14,334
If you go sleep, than I... - Oh. Okay.

1064
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:18,413
Seema.

1065
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:19,539
Sorry, sorry.

1066
01:02:25,789 --> 01:02:27,051
Bye.

1067
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:31,321
That's a flashback. - Yeah.

1068
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:33,294
No, that's a setback.

1069
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:35,923
One only flies kites in the air,
not kisses.

1070
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,494
You're a physics scholar,
no physical moves.

1071
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:41,397
I mean, not a single kiss.

1072
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:46,538
But... I mean,
I don't know how to kiss.

1073
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:47,733
I've never done it before.

1074
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:50,371
There are no kissing classes.

1075
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,705
It's just a hit with the masses.

1076
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:55,717
Young man, it's a magnetic residue...

1077
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:59,084
...that stops blabbering
and starts heartbeats.

1078
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:02,723
He's right. - Right, but opportunity.
I should get the opportunity.

1079
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,920
Situation. A timing for everything...

1080
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:07,855
Sid.

1081
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:11,598
Forget the puppy love. Kiss her.

1082
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:14,498
I'll be back.

1083
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:16,700
He needs to be explained everything.

1084
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:19,033
Matches? - Don't have it.

1085
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,741
I can't find a
matchstick in this house.

1086
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:34,947
Ms. Josephine? - Yes.

1087
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,951
Hi. I...

1088
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,055
Let me guess.

1089
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,055
You're Sid's friend, right.

1090
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:44,764
Special friend.

1091
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:46,959
So, I was right.

1092
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:50,398
You know, Seema.
The best thing about Sid...

1093
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:52,541
...is that he talks from the heart.

1094
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:56,710
And you're so mean.
You stole that heart.

1095
01:03:56,846 --> 01:03:58,313
Sorry to be personal...

1096
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:01,248
...Mr. Joseph is a very nice gentleman.

1097
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:02,916
He's sent a gift for you.

1098
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,418
Valentine's day gift.

1099
01:04:06,022 --> 01:04:07,649
Thank him.

1100
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,320
Sid.

1101
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,591
Sid. Seema's waiting.

1102
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:15,896
Seema?

1103
01:04:15,965 --> 01:04:18,763
Oh no! Oh no!
Oh no! What's she doing here?

1104
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:20,969
I'll take a look. - Okay.

1105
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,929
Where did she come from?

1106
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:35,911
She's here.

1107
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,789
Omi, open the door.

1108
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:46,692
Omi! Omi!

1109
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:49,489
Must be the milkman.

1110
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:51,533
Coming.

1111
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:54,998
Sid. - Milkmaid.

1112
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,066
What's she doing here?

1113
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:03,207
You're Sid's friend, right? - Yes.

1114
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:06,311
The helmet? - What did you expect?

1115
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:10,545
By the way...

1116
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,271
Your girl. - My girl?

1117
01:05:34,544 --> 01:05:36,239
Sid's girl.

1118
01:05:43,253 --> 01:05:44,914
'Forget the puppy love.'

1119
01:05:44,988 --> 01:05:46,455
'Kiss her.'

1120
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,324
What are you looking at?
- Your lipstick.

1121
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:53,723
Why? - Because,
I want to stick to your lips, baby.

1122
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:57,290
Awesome, boss.

1123
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:04,406
Enough of this goody-two shoes.

1124
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:07,743
Now I'll show,
when I'm good, I'm good.

1125
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:13,244
When I'm bad... I'm even better.

1126
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:28,657
Not bad.

1127
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,291
5 out of 10.

1128
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:33,700
5. - He's made it to 5.

1129
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:36,397
Five?

1130
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:54,515
6 out of 10.

1131
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,751
Six?

1132
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:58,384
This isn't possible, Jai.
This isn't possible.

1133
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:00,319
Hand me the phone. Hand me the phone.

1134
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:01,886
I don't keep my phone in my shorts.

1135
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:03,295
You...

1136
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,863
There it is. Hold me. Hold me.

1137
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:08,768
Hold me. Hold me.

1138
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:16,808
Call him...

1139
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,722
Hello. - Hello, Sid.

1140
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:28,586
No, it's Jai.

1141
01:07:28,658 --> 01:07:30,421
Jai, who? - Hero.

1142
01:07:30,727 --> 01:07:31,955
Hey, Bhojpuri.

1143
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:34,460
Disconnect it.

1144
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,327
Outgoing is chargeable.
- How did you get the phone?

1145
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:04,692
10 out of 10!

1146
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:13,929
Oh, God!

1147
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:17,271
It's over. Take off the helmet.

1148
01:08:21,611 --> 01:08:25,342
Never underestimate three
things in life. - What?

1149
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:29,315
Love, sex and betrayal. - Oh.

1150
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:32,483
Just like she brought
a twist in our life...

1151
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:36,385
We create bring a twister
in her life. - Yes.

1152
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:40,920
Every friend's a rascal.

1153
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:45,297
Every friend's a rascal.

1154
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:48,962
Every friend's a rascal.

1155
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:52,696
Every friend's a rascal.

1156
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:57,007
Every friend's a rascal.

1157
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,374
...is a rascal!

1158
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:14,686
So, early to bed and early to rise.

1159
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,358
Makes your girlfriend
go with other guys.

1160
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:20,402
Stop it. I meant the perfume.

1161
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,769
It's mine, Sid.
Stop it. - No, Omi. 10.

1162
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:27,403
10 out of 10.

1163
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:29,802
Jai, you were right.

1164
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,277
Forget the puppy love.

1165
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:32,871
Kiss her.

1166
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:36,177
Look, Sid. This 10 out of 10...

1167
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,252
...will fetch you 10
out of 100 in your exams.

1168
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,481
Concentrate on your studies. - Yes.

1169
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:41,648
You're saying this. - Yes.

1170
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:42,951
You're saying this, Jai.

1171
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,691
Osama doesn't look nice preaching.

1172
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,531
You're using my perfume so many times.

1173
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,562
And, new clothes, new shoes.

1174
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:54,329
I'm going on a date.
Try to understand.

1175
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:55,563
Date. Fool.

1176
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:58,832
You borrowed 500 rupees
from me last month.

1177
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:00,239
Pay up now.

1178
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:03,737
Pay up. Now? - Yes.

1179
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:04,870
Are you the only
one who goes on dates?

1180
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,346
Try to understand the situation.

1181
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,541
How much?

1182
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:09,616
500? - Yes.

1183
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:10,674
Sure? - Yes.

1184
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,787
Give it.

1185
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:13,678
Hold on.

1186
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,583
Where is my 500 rupees?
- What 500 rupees?

1187
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:19,326
Remember, the poems you recited...

1188
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:20,953
...on Peter's Colony Family Day.
- I remember.

1189
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:22,596
And you were badly beaten up. - Yes.

1190
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:24,859
And, I paid to stitch you up.
- You did...

1191
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:26,196
Thank you very much.

1192
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:30,329
I remembered,
you borrowed 500 from me as well.

1193
01:10:30,473 --> 01:10:33,874
Bhojpuri film audition. Remember?

1194
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,545
'Gharwali Tohar...
- Aur Maliswali Hamar.'

1195
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,341
Remember. And, now this is mine.

1196
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:42,246
So, she must be waiting for me.

1197
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:43,409
I'm all ready.

1198
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:45,746
And, this... final touches.

1199
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:48,551
I'll introduce you to her.

1200
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,326
I'll introduce you to her.

1201
01:10:51,394 --> 01:10:54,363
Early morning.

1202
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:56,661
Stop it.

1203
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,359
It's your perfume.

1204
01:11:02,304 --> 01:11:03,794
Sid. Sid.

1205
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,568
I've prepared your favourite sandwich.

1206
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:08,867
Oh, thank you so much, Ms. Josephine.

1207
01:11:08,944 --> 01:11:11,469
But, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I've to go meet someone.

1208
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,844
Someone or Seema!

1209
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,184
My, my, you're blushing, Sid.

1210
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:21,846
I've taken an important decision,
regarding...

1211
01:11:21,957 --> 01:11:25,757
Let me guess, regarding Mr. Joseph.

1212
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,954
Now you're blushing.

1213
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:31,329
Ms. Josephine, I would've listened,
but I'm in a hurry.

1214
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,425
Seema's waiting for me.
- Alright then, run along.

1215
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:35,504
Mustn't keep a girl waiting. - Yeah.

1216
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:36,571
And you know what.

1217
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:39,631
How can I ever miss out
on your sandwich? - Thank you.

1218
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:41,365
Alright, all the best.

1219
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:42,502
Thank you, you're the best.

1220
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:43,977
Oh, God!

1221
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:45,976
He's en-route to get a degree in love.

1222
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:48,408
And, I haven't even started.

1223
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:50,175
Help me, God.

1224
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:19,474
Since I saw you, I was happy.

1225
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:23,346
My mom's finally
found a daughter-in-law.

1226
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:34,522
Since I saw you, I was happy.

1227
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:38,294
My mom's finally
found a daughter-in-law.

1228
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:41,868
This is what I like about you.

1229
01:12:42,204 --> 01:12:45,196
Do you have a brother?

1230
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:48,937
Yes, you can take my heart.

1231
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:52,806
First, prove that you're worth it.

1232
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:59,479
Every time you get angry,
it's like bullets piercing my heart.

1233
01:13:07,463 --> 01:13:11,229
Me and you!

1234
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:36,891
I'm a bit naive.

1235
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,990
And, a little naughty.

1236
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:48,227
Why do you talk so much?

1237
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:52,730
It's hard to digest.

1238
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:56,642
What to do, I like you.

1239
01:13:56,745 --> 01:14:00,340
Why does that sound so false?

1240
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:07,254
Every time you get angry,
it's like bullets piercing my heart.

1241
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:19,698
Me and you!

1242
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:48,026
If you... give me your heart.

1243
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:53,326
I know someone who will.

1244
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:59,408
Who is she, how does she look?

1245
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,876
Tell me honestly.

1246
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:07,710
I'll be right back,
after meeting her.

1247
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:11,480
I'll beat you black and blue.

1248
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:18,251
Every time you get angry,
it's like bullets piercing my heart.

1249
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:29,932
Me and you!

1250
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:34,570
Since I saw you, I was happy.

1251
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:38,272
My mom's finally
found a daughter-in-law.

1252
01:15:38,414 --> 01:15:41,906
This is what I like about you.

1253
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:45,277
Do you have a brother?

1254
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:49,222
Yes, you can take my heart.

1255
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:52,783
First, prove that you're worth it.

1256
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:59,458
Every time you get angry,
it's like bullets piercing my heart.

1257
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:10,879
Me and you!

1258
01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:27,919
Look.

1259
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:30,289
These lovers I tell you.

1260
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:32,698
Crazy about each other
just like Saif and Kareena.

1261
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:35,600
Sid.

1262
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:38,471
Oh, God!

1263
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,440
That's Sid and Seema. - Yes.

1264
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:42,808
Sid. - Yes, what?

1265
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:45,479
Those two rascals. - What?

1266
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:48,414
Stay there! - She's coming here.

1267
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,242
They're disgusting people.

1268
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,648
Remember, I told you.

1269
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:55,349
One, barged in my bedroom
posing as a dog trainer.

1270
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:58,755
And, the other wanted to capture me...
in his room, not camera.

1271
01:16:58,827 --> 01:16:59,919
What?

1272
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:01,924
You rascals...

1273
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:04,723
Jai. - Cheers.

1274
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,395
Omi. - Sid.

1275
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:07,765
You know them?

1276
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:09,804
They're my friends.

1277
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,703
You've such cheap friends.

1278
01:17:11,774 --> 01:17:13,298
What are you saying? - Who's the girl?

1279
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,433
Don't listen to her, Sid.

1280
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:16,443
She wants to breakup our friendship.

1281
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,810
Wait, I'll break your bones first.

1282
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,649
You cannot break their bones.
- Exactly.

1283
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,853
Because, I will break their bones.

1284
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,723
No! No!

1285
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:31,925
No! No!

1286
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:33,550
What 'No'?

1287
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:35,995
Omi, rest are just dreams.

1288
01:17:36,799 --> 01:17:38,426
But kin are kin. - Yes

1289
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,892
And Sid's a kin. - Yeah.

1290
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:42,793
And, he's found a great girl.

1291
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:43,802
Friend.

1292
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:47,774
We're idiots, but she's danger alarm.

1293
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:50,607
Just like Chinese goods,
without warranty or guarantee.

1294
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:53,782
Yes, she'll breakup our
friendship with Sid. - What?

1295
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:57,648
She'll break Sid's heart. - Yes.

1296
01:17:57,953 --> 01:17:58,920
You see, Jai.

1297
01:17:59,154 --> 01:18:00,849
We'll have to do something...

1298
01:18:00,923 --> 01:18:03,824
...so that, this serpent's
desires are never fulfilled.

1299
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:08,661
So, Seema, you're in for trouble.

1300
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:09,754
Take care.

1301
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,190
Kailash Kher. Anupam Kher.

1302
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:13,833
I don't care.

1303
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:17,727
Come on.

1304
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:23,309
Sid, is she your 10 on 10.
- Yes, that's her.

1305
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:28,909
My friend, there's no such companion,
or lover. - Yes.

1306
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:30,809
Her?

1307
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,349
What can I say?

1308
01:18:33,722 --> 01:18:37,590
How do I say it? - You know her?

1309
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,889
Friend, she's the same
girl I showed you flashback of.

1310
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:44,392
What are you saying?
- Not just screen-test...

1311
01:18:44,466 --> 01:18:46,331
...she gave me a skin-test
without hesitating.

1312
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,801
What are you saying?
- How can you forget?

1313
01:18:48,904 --> 01:18:50,633
What is mobile number?

1314
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:52,003
What is smile number?

1315
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:53,208
What are you saying?

1316
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:54,503
She's not that kind of a girl,
I know her.

1317
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:55,941
Correct, correct.
- Mind your language.

1318
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:57,945
Right, she's not that kind of a girl.
I know what kind she is.

1319
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,375
She's like the film
that gets a good opening.

1320
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:01,882
Gets a good collection on weekend.

1321
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,578
But, after Monday she
drops her life-partner.

1322
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:06,280
Mind it. - Listen to me, Sid.

1323
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:07,413
Listen to me. - What are you saying?

1324
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:08,717
Don't hit me.

1325
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,452
She's a cheap girl.
She'll ruin your life.

1326
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:12,459
Shut up. Shut up. - I mean it.

1327
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:13,620
She will ruin your life.

1328
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:16,425
Don't test... Don't test my patience.

1329
01:19:16,498 --> 01:19:18,489
Your life will be ruined...
- Don't hit me.

1330
01:19:18,567 --> 01:19:19,261
Why hit me?

1331
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:20,801
You don't believe me?
Look in my phone.

1332
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:22,159
Look in my phone.
- What's in your phone?

1333
01:19:22,237 --> 01:19:23,295
Give me my phone. - Show me.

1334
01:19:23,372 --> 01:19:23,929
Just second.

1335
01:19:24,173 --> 01:19:25,470
Nonsense.

1336
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,972
Show me.

1337
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:30,310
A photo of her private tattoo.

1338
01:19:30,445 --> 01:19:32,811
How's it on my phone?
- How do you have this?

1339
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:34,182
How do you have this?

1340
01:19:34,249 --> 01:19:35,876
Don't beat me.

1341
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,647
How do you have a photo of her tattoo?

1342
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,414
Tell me.

1343
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:41,786
Look at this photo, Sid.
She's a witch.

1344
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,551
She will ruin your life, I mean it.

1345
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:46,651
Look, Sid.
Listen to me. She will ruin you, Sid.

1346
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:48,923
Rascal. - Don't beat me.

1347
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:53,225
What happened?

1348
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:54,394
Stupid people.

1349
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,335
Strange people.

1350
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:57,702
Taking advantage of our friendship.

1351
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,606
I know her.

1352
01:20:00,742 --> 01:20:02,607
Go on, fulfil the
duty of your friendship.

1353
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:04,271
He's understood half of it.

1354
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,571
You explain him the rest. Go on.

1355
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:08,578
Thanks.

1356
01:20:09,284 --> 01:20:11,548
Is everything okay? - Yes, go on.

1357
01:20:22,564 --> 01:20:24,725
Sid, I need your laptop for sending...

1358
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:27,331
Female? Sid?

1359
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:31,372
Sid. - What?

1360
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,169
Friend, am I dreaming?

1361
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,338
This is Seema.

1362
01:20:40,782 --> 01:20:43,649
That's your Seema? - Yes.

1363
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,720
That's my Seema. What is your problem?

1364
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,246
Friend.

1365
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:50,416
This Seema has no boundaries.

1366
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:52,551
And this Seema's got no character.

1367
01:20:52,628 --> 01:20:54,755
And you're a big rascal. - Sid.

1368
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,457
What are you doing?

1369
01:20:56,531 --> 01:20:59,500
What are you two up to?

1370
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,331
What are you two up to?
- Sid. I've been to her bedroom.

1371
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:04,429
On the left are her tees, and on
right are abracadabra in her drawer.

1372
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:05,733
I mean - Liar

1373
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:07,775
She's a play woman.

1374
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:10,437
Swear on it. Swear on it. - I swear.

1375
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:13,208
It's true, Sid.
That girl's not your type.

1376
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:16,774
Listen to me, Sid.
She will ruin your life.

1377
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:18,812
Don't do it.

1378
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:21,185
Don't do this with me, jealous boys!

1379
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:28,387
No.

1380
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:31,366
Seema can't be that type.

1381
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:34,497
She can't be.
I've a connection with her.

1382
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:36,366
I get good vibes about her. No.

1383
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:41,408
Om! Om! Om! Om!

1384
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,356
Joseph sir. - Yes, Pinto.

1385
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:58,290
This suit really suites you. - Yes.

1386
01:21:58,393 --> 01:22:00,452
Doesn't it look three good?
- That's too good.

1387
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:02,759
No, no, it's three piece,
so three good.

1388
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:04,729
Sir, are you attending some wedding.

1389
01:22:04,933 --> 01:22:06,423
God bless you my son.

1390
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:07,761
Marriage is certainly on the cards...

1391
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:09,166
...but for now,
I'm just going to meet her.

1392
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:13,264
So, a friend beat another
friend black and blue.

1393
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:16,304
Strength for the
body and mind senorita.

1394
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:17,503
Hello. - Hello.

1395
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:19,206
Pinto. Get me a Bournvita.

1396
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:21,573
I've something to say as well.

1397
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:22,548
Go ahead.

1398
01:22:22,617 --> 01:22:27,213
When two hearts are in love,
then why... are people jealous?

1399
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:29,323
In simple words it's called...

1400
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:31,949
It's called Love-sick.
Love-sick. Love-sick.

1401
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:33,888
Very nice, very nice. - Thank you.

1402
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:37,625
I'll pass on your poetry to Ms.
Josephine.

1403
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,229
Why will you?

1404
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:42,560
I'm going to see her right now.

1405
01:22:43,238 --> 01:22:45,604
You're going? - Yes, of course.

1406
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,301
'Sid really made a mess.'

1407
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:49,739
'But, if he meets Ms.
Josephine it will cause real trouble.'

1408
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,608
Hey, what happened?

1409
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:55,340
Mr. Furtado,
how did you suddenly decide...

1410
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:56,611
...on meeting her today?

1411
01:22:57,219 --> 01:22:58,481
Ms. Josephine. - Yes.

1412
01:22:58,587 --> 01:23:01,215
If you meet Mr.
Joseph, there will be trouble.

1413
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,790
You're right, there will be trouble

1414
01:23:04,326 --> 01:23:05,588
Wait. - Yes.

1415
01:23:06,228 --> 01:23:08,890
Actually, Mr.
Joseph only looks good in trailers.

1416
01:23:09,331 --> 01:23:12,391
If you watch the entire film,
you'll run away before interval.

1417
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:16,302
If I watch the entire film,
how can I run away before interval?

1418
01:23:16,471 --> 01:23:17,904
What are you saying, Jai?

1419
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:22,204
Ms. Josephine is a shopaholic.
- Shopaholic.

1420
01:23:22,677 --> 01:23:25,578
She spends more time
in shopping malls.

1421
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:28,511
You'll have to keep your
wallet loaded, Mr. Furtado.

1422
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:32,278
And, she can turn Big
Bazaar into small Bazaar.

1423
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:33,710
Think.

1424
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:35,416
Good heavens my boy.

1425
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:38,248
Every woman in the world
has the same weak point.

1426
01:23:38,326 --> 01:23:38,883
Shopping.

1427
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,791
No problem. That's not a problem.

1428
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,897
But, just tell me.

1429
01:23:42,964 --> 01:23:45,899
It's not right to borrow
100,000-200,000 from the market.

1430
01:23:45,967 --> 01:23:46,797
100,000-200,000?

1431
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:49,598
That's what Mr.
Joseph spends on drinks in a month.

1432
01:23:49,838 --> 01:23:52,363
I mean alcohol.

1433
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,240
Mr. Joseph drinks?

1434
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:55,469
He doesn't always drink.

1435
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,408
Like, he doesn't
drink when he's asleep.

1436
01:23:57,646 --> 01:24:02,208
But, once he's awake
he drinks till he goes to bed.

1437
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:08,478
He'll deport the bottle from
his life once he gets my support.

1438
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:13,259
Mr. Furtado, Ms.
Josephine gambles as well.

1439
01:24:13,728 --> 01:24:14,854
So sad.

1440
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:18,460
What else can a lonely lady do?

1441
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:20,562
Ms. Josephine.

1442
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:21,829
Yes.

1443
01:24:22,237 --> 01:24:24,637
Mr. Joseph abuses as well.

1444
01:24:24,706 --> 01:24:28,369
Poor thing.
Loneliness makes a man irritated.

1445
01:24:29,377 --> 01:24:30,901
Who says he's alone?

1446
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:34,239
What? - How do I say it?

1447
01:24:34,683 --> 01:24:38,949
He's having an affair. Don't you know?

1448
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:40,949
But, how's that possible?

1449
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:43,219
Who is he? - There's someone.

1450
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:46,422
And, he's become her life.

1451
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:50,829
No. Dear mother of God.

1452
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:52,866
It's okay, Ms. Josephine.

1453
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:54,865
That's how men are.

1454
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,234
Don't worry.

1455
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:06,347
A moment of happiness.

1456
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:12,948
The heart pined and cried out.

1457
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:15,588
You punished me for my love.

1458
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:19,786
What was my crime,
that I was ruined?

1459
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:21,886
I was ruined.

1460
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:26,564
I was ruined in your love.

1461
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:36,903
Sid. Uncle and grandma aren't home.

1462
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,443
I'm all alone at home.

1463
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:46,443
Come to the bedroom,
I want to show you something.

1464
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:51,416
Why bedroom?
- Come to the bedroom I said.

1465
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:56,763
I ordered it over the internet,
especially for you.

1466
01:25:58,967 --> 01:25:59,934
What are you staring at?

1467
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:01,795
Can't you help? - Yes.

1468
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:12,636
Yeah, Sid.
A little higher. Just there.

1469
01:26:13,415 --> 01:26:15,349
'A photo of her private tattoo. '

1470
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:16,884
'How's it on my phone? '

1471
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:20,210
'She's a witch.
She will ruin your life.'

1472
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:22,923
Sid...

1473
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:30,963
Seema, I'm a little...

1474
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:34,600
Can I get some water? - Okay.

1475
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:38,203
Thanks.

1476
01:26:39,474 --> 01:26:41,738
'I've been to her bedroom.'

1477
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:45,576
'On the left are her tees, and on
right are abracadabra in her drawer.'

1478
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,692
Water.

1479
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,869
You're really fast, Seema.

1480
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:11,795
You brought water so quickly.

1481
01:27:16,244 --> 01:27:17,438
Actually, you drink it.

1482
01:27:17,512 --> 01:27:19,377
I just remembered something,
I've to go.

1483
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:22,709
Sid.

1484
01:27:23,184 --> 01:27:24,378
Sid, what happened?

1485
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:26,352
Are you okay?

1486
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:29,586
Did I say something wrong?

1487
01:27:31,559 --> 01:27:34,858
Seema. I am very simple.

1488
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,460
I need time-out,
even for small things.

1489
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:38,521
You...

1490
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:42,862
I can't match-up to your speed, Seema.

1491
01:27:43,438 --> 01:27:44,905
What do you mean by speed? Sid, wait.

1492
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:48,500
Look, Seema.
This relation means a lot to me.

1493
01:27:48,843 --> 01:27:50,470
It's not a game for me.

1494
01:27:50,879 --> 01:27:53,677
I beat up my friends for you.

1495
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,643
For me? - They were right about you.

1496
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:59,152
So, you're judging me on their words.

1497
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:01,349
If that's the case, Sid.

1498
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:03,391
Then you've a problem, not me.

1499
01:28:03,858 --> 01:28:06,918
Sid. What's the point
of a relationship...

1500
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:10,620
...where you trust others more than me?

1501
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:14,164
No, I've already trusted them, Seema.

1502
01:28:14,636 --> 01:28:16,536
My friends were right.

1503
01:28:17,338 --> 01:28:20,398
You Seema, have no boundaries.

1504
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,842
And my dad was absolutely right.

1505
01:28:28,249 --> 01:28:30,843
All civilians aren't just cowards,
but paranoid too.

1506
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:33,345
And that's exactly why
you left your great father...

1507
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:34,945
...and came here?

1508
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:37,314
Nonsense.

1509
01:28:39,828 --> 01:28:41,420
Coward.

1510
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,223
Thank you, thank you. - One more.

1511
01:28:45,366 --> 01:28:46,355
One more?

1512
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:49,463
As I shot the lion in the court.

1513
01:28:49,971 --> 01:28:52,599
As I shot the lion in the court.

1514
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:54,835
The lioness became a widow.

1515
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:56,342
Great! Great!

1516
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:57,835
Great! Great!

1517
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:01,939
Why are you hearing my poetry tonight?

1518
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:03,917
I can't sleep you dog.

1519
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:07,611
Why? - It's 1:30.
Sid hasn't returned yet.

1520
01:29:09,257 --> 01:29:11,589
Omi. Are Sid and Seema...

1521
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:14,492
...doing the scene from
the A certified dirty film?

1522
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:15,821
Look.

1523
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:18,663
Don't say that.

1524
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:23,296
Stop.

1525
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:25,601
Where are you going leaving me?

1526
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:27,368
Stay with me...

1527
01:29:27,442 --> 01:29:28,670
Just a minute.

1528
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:34,278
She's fast, and so are you?

1529
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:37,811
Everyone's fast,
I'm the only one that's slow.

1530
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:39,448
Jai. - Sid.

1531
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,488
Omi. - What happened?

1532
01:29:41,823 --> 01:29:43,654
Every friend is important. '

1533
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,521
Sid. What's wrong with you?

1534
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:48,494
I'm so sorry I hit you guys.

1535
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:50,689
Hit me. Hit me. - What are you doing?

1536
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:52,562
You two were right.

1537
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:56,735
If love's pants,
friendship is underwear.

1538
01:29:57,272 --> 01:30:00,400
If the pant tears...

1539
01:30:02,343 --> 01:30:04,140
...the underwear saves you.

1540
01:30:05,713 --> 01:30:08,944
Buddies... you're my shorts.

1541
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:12,443
From today, no Seema.

1542
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:15,352
Only Jai and Oma. - Omi.

1543
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:18,690
What? - Nothing.

1544
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:22,694
We're happy that you've
seen the light, Sid.

1545
01:30:22,764 --> 01:30:25,790
Now, we'll open the bottle as well.

1546
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:50,454
My passive-aggressive friend,
fell in love.

1547
01:30:53,595 --> 01:30:59,932
Like a old-torn rag lover,
fell head over heels for her.

1548
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:09,899
My passive-aggressive friend,
fell in love.

1549
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:16,606
Like a old-torn rag lover,
fell head over heels for her.

1550
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:19,812
As the world saw this, they said.

1551
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:22,947
As the world saw this, they said.

1552
01:31:23,224 --> 01:31:26,591
As the world saw this, they said.

1553
01:31:29,931 --> 01:31:36,803
Blind horse... running the race.

1554
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:45,269
Blind horse... running the race.

1555
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:02,886
Gait like a hero.

1556
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:04,621
Red like a buffoon.

1557
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:06,326
Not beat or sync.

1558
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,800
He's running.

1559
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:09,563
Like gold covered metal.

1560
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:11,264
You can't woo that girl.

1561
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:12,806
It's a rubbish love story.

1562
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,603
He's running.

1563
01:32:14,676 --> 01:32:20,876
From far it looked
someone's beating the drum.

1564
01:32:21,282 --> 01:32:27,585
When I took a closer look,
my ears started blowing.

1565
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:30,791
As the world saw this, they said.

1566
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:34,259
As the world saw this, they said.

1567
01:32:34,362 --> 01:32:37,456
As the world saw this, they said.

1568
01:32:47,742 --> 01:32:54,204
Blind horse... running the race.

1569
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:57,646
Blind horse... running the race.

1570
01:32:57,752 --> 01:33:01,279
Blind horse... running the race.

1571
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:05,723
Blind horse... running the race.

1572
01:33:10,965 --> 01:33:15,595
'God. I can't believe that Mr.
Joseph seeing someone... '

1573
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:19,829
'Once I meet him
and clear everything.'

1574
01:33:20,575 --> 01:33:21,940
Mr. Joseph.

1575
01:33:22,643 --> 01:33:25,635
Ms. Josephine. - You? Here?

1576
01:33:25,847 --> 01:33:27,815
Actually, I... I...

1577
01:33:27,882 --> 01:33:30,908
Came here to sell something.

1578
01:33:31,252 --> 01:33:32,549
Part time job.

1579
01:33:33,421 --> 01:33:33,887
Part time...

1580
01:33:33,955 --> 01:33:36,253
Brings whiteness in
this colour-changing world.

1581
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:41,853
Fragrant, lathery Chamko.

1582
01:33:42,263 --> 01:33:43,389
How poetic.

1583
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:44,556
What poetry.

1584
01:33:44,632 --> 01:33:45,599
How wonderful.

1585
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:46,564
Do you want to buy it?

1586
01:33:47,468 --> 01:33:49,800
Of course.
But, I don't know how to use it.

1587
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:53,534
Lf... if you can give me
a demonstration, I... - Why not.

1588
01:33:53,608 --> 01:33:55,337
Can I get half a bucket of water?
- Of course.

1589
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:57,411
For drinking? - No. For this.

1590
01:33:57,512 --> 01:33:59,173
How stupid of me.

1591
01:33:59,247 --> 01:33:59,941
Pinto.

1592
01:34:00,181 --> 01:34:02,342
Pinto. Get a bucket of water.

1593
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:03,610
Silly of me.

1594
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:06,612
Nervous. Sorry.

1595
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:09,218
Pinto, thank you. You can go.

1596
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:12,282
What? - Go on...
Go collect Tommy's debt.

1597
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:16,729
Yes, that rascal...
- No abusing. No abusing.

1598
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:18,364
Sorry.

1599
01:34:19,267 --> 01:34:22,828
'Mr. Joseph's definitely not abusive.'

1600
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:29,466
The price is very reasonable as well.

1601
01:34:29,544 --> 01:34:32,445
During these times of inflation,
this is the best option.

1602
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:33,571
Yes.

1603
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:37,441
'Ms. Josephine doesn't look
like someone who splurges money.'

1604
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:39,509
Do you have any dirty laundry at home?

1605
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,451
Girl! - Laundry?

1606
01:34:41,589 --> 01:34:42,851
Laundry.

1607
01:34:42,957 --> 01:34:44,891
Yes. Whatever.

1608
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,557
Dirty laundry.

1609
01:34:48,463 --> 01:34:50,522
Where do I get that from?

1610
01:34:54,469 --> 01:34:56,027
They're all clean...

1611
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,909
Very, very dirty.

1612
01:35:03,978 --> 01:35:05,570
This is so dirty. Stinking.

1613
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,840
Thank you.

1614
01:35:07,181 --> 01:35:11,447
This is going to take about
five minutes. - Yes. No problem.

1615
01:35:11,886 --> 01:35:13,478
By the way, it's evening...

1616
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:14,987
...would you like something to drink?

1617
01:35:15,223 --> 01:35:17,453
Do you drink every day? - Daily.

1618
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:18,954
Daily? - Daily.

1619
01:35:19,227 --> 01:35:21,855
I'll get one for you as well.

1620
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:24,823
Bloody drunkard!

1621
01:35:27,435 --> 01:35:29,335
Here you are, Tulsi tea.

1622
01:35:29,403 --> 01:35:30,461
Herbal tea.

1623
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:32,398
Towel for you. - Thanks.

1624
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:33,439
This is very good.

1625
01:35:33,508 --> 01:35:34,600
Not harmful at all.

1626
01:35:34,675 --> 01:35:36,404
This is the only thing I drink.

1627
01:35:36,544 --> 01:35:39,342
'That means Mr.
Joseph definitely doesn't drink.

1628
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:40,505
Please, take a seat.

1629
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:43,243
It will be taken five minute.

1630
01:35:43,584 --> 01:35:47,543
By the way, I'm sure you like films.

1631
01:35:47,889 --> 01:35:51,347
And your favourite film
must be 'The Great Gambler'.

1632
01:35:51,893 --> 01:35:53,690
'The Great Gambler'?
- Yes. About gambling.

1633
01:35:53,761 --> 01:35:56,025
No, it can only be
a gambler's favourite.

1634
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:58,227
Not my cup of tea.

1635
01:35:58,566 --> 01:36:00,796
'That means she doesn't gamble.'

1636
01:36:00,868 --> 01:36:02,301
Are you sure?

1637
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:07,301
Quite surprising, Mr. Joseph.

1638
01:36:07,608 --> 01:36:09,599
You don't know how to wash clothes.

1639
01:36:10,211 --> 01:36:13,374
Or, is there someone who washes them?

1640
01:36:13,481 --> 01:36:16,211
There is someone. - What?

1641
01:36:16,284 --> 01:36:20,243
Pinto. He washes my clothes. - I see.

1642
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:24,291
You are still not in my life...

1643
01:36:24,358 --> 01:36:26,553
I'm sorry.

1644
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:28,388
That's exactly what I want to know.

1645
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:33,966
If not me, then who else
is in your life? - No one.

1646
01:36:37,438 --> 01:36:41,306
So, you're actually
single like me. - Yes.

1647
01:36:41,576 --> 01:36:42,873
Since a long time.

1648
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:48,642
And, is there anyone in your life...
- Only Joseph.

1649
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:17,334
Brings whiteness in
this colour-changing world.

1650
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:23,472
Fragrant, lathery Chamko.

1651
01:37:26,854 --> 01:37:30,722
Hand me a cigarette.
- I don't have one. Check his drawer.

1652
01:37:38,733 --> 01:37:39,757
Poison?

1653
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:45,703
But we'll have to take off
the sheet to identify the body.

1654
01:37:46,374 --> 01:37:48,365
Rascal. - Really.

1655
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:51,636
Sid.

1656
01:37:52,313 --> 01:37:54,838
Oh my, God. Sid. Sid.

1657
01:37:56,484 --> 01:37:57,610
What?

1658
01:37:57,852 --> 01:38:00,616
Why didn't you go to college?
- I don't want to go anywhere.

1659
01:38:01,522 --> 01:38:04,548
But why? - Jai, please leave me alone.

1660
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:05,421
I don't want to go anywhere.

1661
01:38:05,493 --> 01:38:07,859
So, will you keep lying here all day?

1662
01:38:08,529 --> 01:38:10,656
No, for a change I'll die.

1663
01:38:11,632 --> 01:38:13,862
Always bothering me.
You two are too much.

1664
01:38:19,974 --> 01:38:22,408
He's really madly in love with Seema.

1665
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,907
Jai, Sid never lies.

1666
01:38:25,513 --> 01:38:26,878
He'll die.

1667
01:38:27,848 --> 01:38:29,372
But, what now?

1668
01:38:29,784 --> 01:38:31,752
You said Seema's a cheap girl.

1669
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:34,413
And you said she's too fast.

1670
01:38:35,589 --> 01:38:36,851
Omi.

1671
01:38:37,858 --> 01:38:40,292
The flashback that I showed everyone...

1672
01:38:41,295 --> 01:38:43,388
Was a lie. - What?

1673
01:38:44,432 --> 01:38:46,332
Nothing happened with Seema.

1674
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:50,999
Her grandma flogged me with that belt.

1675
01:38:51,806 --> 01:38:54,297
That reminds me, Jai.

1676
01:38:54,408 --> 01:38:56,603
Nothing happened between
me and Seema either.

1677
01:38:56,844 --> 01:38:59,540
Her dog bit me in the back.

1678
01:39:01,415 --> 01:39:05,511
You liar.
Aren't you ashamed? - And you?

1679
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:09,589
I'm saying it for me too. - Sorry.

1680
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:15,558
But, that means... Seema's a nice girl.

1681
01:39:16,964 --> 01:39:19,432
No, friend. Call her sister-in-law.

1682
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:24,961
From today, Seema's our friend,
our brother's bride.

1683
01:39:26,307 --> 01:39:27,467
Go, Omi. - Yes.

1684
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:29,475
And tell Sid the truth. - Yes.

1685
01:39:29,543 --> 01:39:31,568
Listen. - Tell him the truth!

1686
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:33,814
He beat me when I lied to him.

1687
01:39:33,881 --> 01:39:36,475
If we tell him the truth,
he'll definitely kill us.

1688
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:40,718
Jai. What now?

1689
01:39:41,856 --> 01:39:47,692
Friend, if Don 2,
Dhoom 2 and Krish 2 is possible.

1690
01:39:48,429 --> 01:39:52,661
Then we can certainly make
part 2 of our friend's love-story.

1691
01:39:56,237 --> 01:39:58,228
Part 2!

1692
01:40:08,182 --> 01:40:12,585
Type sorry for Seema.
And also an awesome romantic poem.

1693
01:40:15,756 --> 01:40:16,848
Hurry up.

1694
01:40:17,391 --> 01:40:18,551
Done.

1695
01:40:18,626 --> 01:40:20,651
No more cheating. No more cheating.

1696
01:40:20,728 --> 01:40:21,786
Where's the phone?

1697
01:40:21,962 --> 01:40:22,951
Where's the phone?

1698
01:40:23,197 --> 01:40:24,494
You're sitting on it.

1699
01:40:25,232 --> 01:40:26,790
I was wondering what's vibrating.

1700
01:40:26,867 --> 01:40:28,926
Message from Sid.

1701
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:31,363
I don't want to read it.

1702
01:40:31,572 --> 01:40:32,869
He's said sorry.

1703
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,407
And, he's also sent a poem.

1704
01:40:34,475 --> 01:40:37,205
Woman are strange beings.

1705
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:39,445
If you say something,
they puff their mouth.

1706
01:40:39,513 --> 01:40:42,277
And, if you do something
their stomach's puff up.

1707
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:45,443
Bloody cheap.

1708
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:48,449
What does 'stomach puff up' mean?

1709
01:40:50,357 --> 01:40:53,383
Rascal, who sends such poems.

1710
01:40:53,461 --> 01:40:55,486
Are you made.

1711
01:41:00,534 --> 01:41:02,126
Seema.

1712
01:41:05,306 --> 01:41:06,500
What's written?

1713
01:41:07,174 --> 01:41:10,268
Every boy's like a soft drink bottle.

1714
01:41:10,678 --> 01:41:12,942
They've nothing up
there except for a lid.

1715
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,943
This is so...

1716
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:29,855
We'll have to think of
a new way to patch them up.

1717
01:41:31,232 --> 01:41:32,290
Hold on.

1718
01:41:32,366 --> 01:41:34,834
Tomorrow's 'Woman's Day' right? - Yes.

1719
01:41:35,202 --> 01:41:40,435
So, what if Sid sends
Seema a romantic gift?

1720
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:43,969
Why will he? - Dude, we'll send her.

1721
01:41:44,211 --> 01:41:46,543
And say, Sid's sent it.

1722
01:41:46,614 --> 01:41:48,741
We'll give her the gift and say...

1723
01:41:52,686 --> 01:41:54,347
What an idea?

1724
01:41:54,421 --> 01:41:58,790
And gift should make
Seema melt like ice.

1725
01:41:58,859 --> 01:41:59,848
I see.

1726
01:41:59,927 --> 01:42:01,622
Let's look. Come on.

1727
01:42:02,263 --> 01:42:04,561
Gift for sister-in-law...

1728
01:42:05,132 --> 01:42:06,394
Omi...

1729
01:42:10,638 --> 01:42:11,866
I found the present. - Where?

1730
01:42:12,206 --> 01:42:13,264
There.

1731
01:42:17,177 --> 01:42:20,146
Seema won't melt with this,
she'll become stiffer.

1732
01:42:20,347 --> 01:42:21,314
Are you crazy?

1733
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:22,371
You're the crazy.

1734
01:42:22,483 --> 01:42:26,476
Once Seema sees this gift,
she will call Sid.

1735
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:28,188
Wrong, Sid.

1736
01:42:28,255 --> 01:42:32,248
Once she gets this present,
Sid will have no future.

1737
01:42:34,328 --> 01:42:36,421
You're so rustic, Omi.

1738
01:42:37,197 --> 01:42:39,290
Sid's mom, Seema's uncle.

1739
01:42:39,466 --> 01:42:43,334
All the elders want
to see Seema in this avatar.

1740
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:45,568
Are you crazy?

1741
01:42:45,706 --> 01:42:48,266
Once Seema accepts this gift...

1742
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,339
...then, just visualize this, Omi.

1743
01:42:50,644 --> 01:42:52,942
Sister-in-law Seema. Wearing this.

1744
01:42:55,983 --> 01:42:58,383
Along with Sid, she's bending down...
- Bending down...

1745
01:42:58,452 --> 01:42:59,476
Bending down... - Enough.

1746
01:42:59,553 --> 01:43:01,544
And taking everyone's blessings.
- Think.

1747
01:43:04,458 --> 01:43:05,550
Jai.

1748
01:43:05,626 --> 01:43:07,560
Why are you turning
Yashraj's Chandni...

1749
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:09,562
...to Madhur Bhandarkar's Chandni Bar.

1750
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:12,463
Omi. Answer this.

1751
01:43:12,633 --> 01:43:16,330
Every lover...
wants to see his love, in this avatar.

1752
01:43:16,403 --> 01:43:16,835
Right?

1753
01:43:16,904 --> 01:43:19,202
Say yes or no. - Yes.

1754
01:43:19,273 --> 01:43:20,365
So, that's it.

1755
01:43:20,441 --> 01:43:21,806
Buy it and parcel it.

1756
01:43:21,875 --> 01:43:22,967
I'll get the credit card.

1757
01:43:23,243 --> 01:43:25,302
We've found the gift.

1758
01:43:28,215 --> 01:43:29,273
Excuse me. - Yes.

1759
01:43:30,517 --> 01:43:34,578
Just... parcel this
colourful one for me.

1760
01:43:34,788 --> 01:43:35,447
Okay.

1761
01:43:35,522 --> 01:43:37,012
It's for my sister-in-law. - Come.

1762
01:43:37,257 --> 01:43:38,588
Gift wrap.

1763
01:43:40,327 --> 01:43:41,453
'Dear, Seema.'

1764
01:43:41,528 --> 01:43:43,018
'Since the time I saw you... '

1765
01:43:43,364 --> 01:43:45,559
'... l've always wanted
to see you in this.'

1766
01:43:45,766 --> 01:43:48,234
'I love you with all my heart. Sid.'

1767
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:06,819
Sid!

1768
01:44:12,593 --> 01:44:13,753
This...

1769
01:44:13,994 --> 01:44:16,189
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

1770
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,921
What have you done? What is this?

1771
01:44:21,869 --> 01:44:23,928
Looks nice.

1772
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,347
Who the hell you think you are?

1773
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:39,613
Come out if you've the guts.

1774
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,711
Come out and show your face.

1775
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:42,778
Girl?

1776
01:44:42,856 --> 01:44:45,916
She's screaming for me.
- Let's take a look.

1777
01:44:45,993 --> 01:44:47,824
Let's see...

1778
01:44:48,462 --> 01:44:49,656
Don't look.

1779
01:44:50,831 --> 01:44:52,924
Seema, why are you screaming?

1780
01:44:53,033 --> 01:44:53,761
What are you doing?

1781
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:55,426
You stop screaming.

1782
01:44:55,602 --> 01:44:57,797
Cheesy, cheapo, bloody bore, fool.

1783
01:44:57,871 --> 01:44:59,532
Dad was right.

1784
01:44:59,807 --> 01:45:02,332
All civilians are a bunch of cowards.

1785
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:04,207
If it was some army officer...

1786
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:06,542
...he would've had the
guts to say sorry on my face.

1787
01:45:06,814 --> 01:45:08,281
Bloody...

1788
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:11,578
Sending me down-market messages.

1789
01:45:11,752 --> 01:45:14,949
Since the day you saw me,
you want to see me in a bikini.

1790
01:45:15,222 --> 01:45:17,281
What nonsense, liar.

1791
01:45:17,357 --> 01:45:18,221
Bloody pervert.

1792
01:45:18,292 --> 01:45:19,816
Sid! Sid! Sid!

1793
01:45:19,893 --> 01:45:21,360
Listen.

1794
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:22,656
She isn't the liar.

1795
01:45:23,897 --> 01:45:25,421
We are. - Yes, Sid.

1796
01:45:25,733 --> 01:45:27,758
She's as honest as you are.

1797
01:45:27,935 --> 01:45:28,924
What...

1798
01:45:29,002 --> 01:45:30,435
Where are you hiding?

1799
01:45:30,504 --> 01:45:34,770
The flashback we showed you,
was a lie.

1800
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:36,936
It's all a lie.

1801
01:45:37,244 --> 01:45:39,542
What are you two saying?

1802
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,379
Look up. - Look.

1803
01:45:41,448 --> 01:45:43,211
Old hag. - Old hag is your mother!

1804
01:45:43,283 --> 01:45:47,549
'Aaryabhatt leave my butt.'

1805
01:45:48,322 --> 01:45:48,845
Listen.

1806
01:45:48,922 --> 01:45:51,891
We sent the bikini, card, messages...

1807
01:45:51,959 --> 01:45:53,551
...to correct our mistakes.

1808
01:45:53,627 --> 01:45:54,355
Shut up.

1809
01:45:54,428 --> 01:45:55,861
What kind of friends are you?

1810
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:57,226
Seema.

1811
01:45:57,264 --> 01:45:59,892
This is my last warning.

1812
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,666
If you bother me again,
you'll regret it.

1813
01:46:02,736 --> 01:46:03,725
Seema, wait. I'm coming.

1814
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:05,601
I need to talk to you. Don't go.

1815
01:46:05,806 --> 01:46:07,205
Just a minute.

1816
01:46:07,341 --> 01:46:08,365
Bye.

1817
01:46:08,976 --> 01:46:10,910
I'm coming, wait.

1818
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:16,207
Sid, stop.

1819
01:46:16,383 --> 01:46:18,715
Sid, listen. - Sid.

1820
01:46:18,852 --> 01:46:21,286
Sid. Sid.

1821
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:24,482
Sid.

1822
01:46:27,461 --> 01:46:29,759
Seema. - Safe.

1823
01:46:30,364 --> 01:46:34,300
Seema, please. I'll just come.

1824
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:36,594
Seema. Seema. Seema.

1825
01:46:36,937 --> 01:46:39,963
Seema, stop. Please.

1826
01:46:40,707 --> 01:46:44,336
This is love, no need to cry.

1827
01:46:44,678 --> 01:46:47,340
We've toilet paper, wipe it dry.

1828
01:46:49,283 --> 01:46:51,911
That was a nice one, come on.

1829
01:46:56,256 --> 01:46:57,848
You talk to Seema.

1830
01:46:57,925 --> 01:47:00,359
What's the difference
between you and me today.

1831
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:08,635
Son, come in. Not welcome.

1832
01:47:08,702 --> 01:47:10,260
Go, please. - Look.

1833
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:12,395
Please, I said get out.

1834
01:47:12,506 --> 01:47:13,530
Go out.

1835
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,629
It was a misunderstanding.

1836
01:47:14,741 --> 01:47:17,335
I didn't send the bikini...
- I am not interested.

1837
01:47:17,511 --> 01:47:19,342
Listen... - Die.

1838
01:47:19,413 --> 01:47:20,437
What are you doing, Seema.

1839
01:47:20,514 --> 01:47:21,742
You invite just anyone in.

1840
01:47:21,815 --> 01:47:23,373
I don't want to meet him.

1841
01:47:27,754 --> 01:47:29,915
Civilian. Romeo.

1842
01:47:30,591 --> 01:47:32,889
My Majnu. My Amol Palekar. Come on.

1843
01:47:33,227 --> 01:47:34,660
Come on.

1844
01:47:34,862 --> 01:47:36,420
Come, come.

1845
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:39,264
Yes, sir. Give me your hand.

1846
01:47:39,499 --> 01:47:41,831
Don't pull me down,
you come up. - Yes.

1847
01:47:41,902 --> 01:47:42,926
Help yourself.

1848
01:47:44,571 --> 01:47:46,596
Careful...

1849
01:47:47,241 --> 01:47:48,003
Sir.

1850
01:47:48,242 --> 01:47:51,473
These day,
you've to be like Salman Khan...

1851
01:47:51,545 --> 01:47:54,309
...not Amol Palekar when wooing a girl.

1852
01:47:54,414 --> 01:47:55,472
Enough.

1853
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:56,712
What's happening, uncle.

1854
01:47:56,783 --> 01:48:00,583
I'm trying to explain him...
- Don't interfere between us, please.

1855
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:02,848
Seema... - Salman Khan.

1856
01:48:03,724 --> 01:48:06,818
Look, Seema.
Actually, once I make a commitment...

1857
01:48:06,894 --> 01:48:08,623
...I never listen to anyone.

1858
01:48:08,795 --> 01:48:11,195
I... - Get out of here, please.

1859
01:48:11,398 --> 01:48:13,263
Even I can't do anything now.

1860
01:48:16,803 --> 01:48:18,828
He's not a bad boy... - Please.

1861
01:48:18,906 --> 01:48:19,600
He's very bad.

1862
01:48:19,673 --> 01:48:21,971
You feel pity for him.
- He's very bad. Forgive him.

1863
01:48:22,809 --> 01:48:25,539
Once I make a commitment
I never listen to anyone...

1864
01:48:25,612 --> 01:48:26,601
Amol Palekar.

1865
01:48:30,684 --> 01:48:32,379
Siddharth.

1866
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,182
What the...

1867
01:48:34,621 --> 01:48:36,486
You? - Yes, me.

1868
01:48:37,925 --> 01:48:39,893
You? - Yes, me.

1869
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,484
Now I get it.

1870
01:48:41,695 --> 01:48:44,391
You two are responsible...

1871
01:48:44,464 --> 01:48:46,193
...for the tiff between
Siddharth and Seema.

1872
01:48:46,366 --> 01:48:48,960
That's not true, grandma.
- Yes, that's not true at all.

1873
01:48:49,503 --> 01:48:51,869
Son, will you please
pass me that broom.

1874
01:48:51,972 --> 01:48:53,269
Yes, grandma.

1875
01:48:53,774 --> 01:48:54,934
Here you go, grandma.

1876
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:59,610
You dare make them argue.

1877
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:07,780
Grandma, water.

1878
01:49:08,956 --> 01:49:10,218
Drink it.

1879
01:49:12,592 --> 01:49:16,392
What's this photo
doing amongst these ones?

1880
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:20,732
Grandma,
it increases the value of others.

1881
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:24,737
Siddharth's such a innocent, so sober.

1882
01:49:24,805 --> 01:49:27,535
And you two, are worthless.

1883
01:49:28,742 --> 01:49:31,734
Grandma.
We admit it's our mistake, but...

1884
01:49:31,812 --> 01:49:33,336
Please help us, grandma.

1885
01:49:33,413 --> 01:49:34,471
Please help us, grandma.

1886
01:49:34,548 --> 01:49:36,743
We can do anything to patch them up.

1887
01:49:36,917 --> 01:49:38,214
Sing DDLJ's tune.

1888
01:49:38,352 --> 01:49:39,785
Lay leaves on the ground
like 'Mohabbatein'.

1889
01:49:39,853 --> 01:49:41,844
Even use the hammer like Ghajini.

1890
01:49:41,989 --> 01:49:43,456
Just a minute.

1891
01:49:44,358 --> 01:49:47,725
The films... gives me an idea. - What?

1892
01:49:47,928 --> 01:49:50,795
To bring Siddharth
and Seema together...

1893
01:49:51,832 --> 01:49:55,768
...let's make a filmy plan. - Filmy?

1894
01:49:55,836 --> 01:49:57,463
Yes.

1895
01:50:02,943 --> 01:50:06,174
This isn't filmy, but a flop plan.

1896
01:50:06,713 --> 01:50:11,309
Sid. This plan will
surely pass. - Pass.

1897
01:50:11,385 --> 01:50:14,548
Pass doesn't sound so
right from your failures.

1898
01:50:14,621 --> 01:50:17,419
Fine. This plan will
definitely not fail.

1899
01:50:17,557 --> 01:50:18,649
Okay.

1900
01:50:19,459 --> 01:50:22,758
Siddharth, you're a friend.
- Don't call me your friend.

1901
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:24,629
Friends.

1902
01:50:24,698 --> 01:50:25,756
Enough.

1903
01:50:25,832 --> 01:50:29,461
You know, the word friend
sounds so bad when you say it.

1904
01:50:29,936 --> 01:50:31,335
What do you two want?

1905
01:50:31,538 --> 01:50:33,165
First, you separate Seema and me...

1906
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,434
...then you plan to
get us back together.

1907
01:50:34,508 --> 01:50:35,634
What the hell.

1908
01:50:36,877 --> 01:50:39,402
Your fun and frolic
has ruined my life.

1909
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:40,741
Don't you two care?

1910
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:43,347
Friends.

1911
01:50:43,417 --> 01:50:44,679
Don't call me a friend.

1912
01:50:44,851 --> 01:50:45,909
Don't insult me.

1913
01:50:52,426 --> 01:50:57,625
Sid. I admit, we did wrong to you.

1914
01:50:59,566 --> 01:51:02,126
But, we want to correct that mistake.

1915
01:51:04,604 --> 01:51:06,629
We never achieved
any degree in life, Sid.

1916
01:51:08,275 --> 01:51:09,936
But, whether we do or not...

1917
01:51:10,877 --> 01:51:15,712
...but, we want to be the
best in the subject of friendship.

1918
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:18,217
The best.

1919
01:51:19,453 --> 01:51:21,648
Yes, Sid. It was mistake.

1920
01:51:22,189 --> 01:51:23,383
But, that's all.

1921
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:25,187
So,

1922
01:51:25,425 --> 01:51:27,916
Even if we die,
we'll soothe this pain.

1923
01:51:28,762 --> 01:51:32,289
We'll leave only memories
in our friend's heart.

1924
01:51:32,499 --> 01:51:36,435
Such a beautiful poem,
at this emotional point.

1925
01:51:37,671 --> 01:51:40,265
Do you mean it? - Totally.

1926
01:51:41,775 --> 01:51:44,608
Did you mean what you said? Sure?

1927
01:51:46,313 --> 01:51:49,180
You two stop crying.

1928
01:51:49,249 --> 01:51:50,614
What's this?

1929
01:51:51,318 --> 01:51:52,842
Seeing us cry is making
you emotional, Sid?

1930
01:51:52,919 --> 01:51:55,513
No, you look really ugly crying.

1931
01:51:56,256 --> 01:51:58,121
What? - You've a
problem with that too.

1932
01:51:58,191 --> 01:51:59,215
I was just joking.

1933
01:51:59,693 --> 01:52:01,786
So, tell me. What was your plan?

1934
01:52:01,862 --> 01:52:03,659
Your flop plan. Let's make it a hit.

1935
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,163
Really? - Will you do it?

1936
01:52:05,232 --> 01:52:06,460
Yes, we will.

1937
01:52:07,701 --> 01:52:10,295
Isn't that a little too much? - Do it.

1938
01:52:11,638 --> 01:52:14,163
Take off the glasses.

1939
01:52:15,942 --> 01:52:17,705
Grandma, we aren't we
hiring a rickshaw or a taxi.

1940
01:52:17,777 --> 01:52:18,869
We've been walking for so long.

1941
01:52:18,945 --> 01:52:20,503
Yes. No!

1942
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,514
The doctor's asked me to walk.

1943
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:25,318
Let's go there.

1944
01:52:29,356 --> 01:52:31,187
Jagawar. - Baktawar.

1945
01:52:31,258 --> 01:52:33,818
Elders say,
you should repent for your sins.

1946
01:52:34,394 --> 01:52:36,726
But, let's commit a sin first.

1947
01:52:38,665 --> 01:52:40,428
What a gait. - What a beauty.

1948
01:52:40,534 --> 01:52:42,468
What a tresses. - What white tresses.

1949
01:52:42,536 --> 01:52:43,594
Hey, fancy dress.

1950
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:45,763
Who do you think you are? - Ravan.

1951
01:52:45,839 --> 01:52:47,704
Wanna be my Chammak Challo.

1952
01:52:47,774 --> 01:52:49,799
You haven't seen the other side of me,
I'm telling you.

1953
01:52:49,876 --> 01:52:52,276
Fine, turn around and we'll
see the other side as well.

1954
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:53,946
What nonsense.

1955
01:52:54,814 --> 01:52:57,681
Let go. Let go.

1956
01:52:57,751 --> 01:52:59,548
Age no bar.

1957
01:53:00,487 --> 01:53:01,613
What are you doing? Let go.

1958
01:53:01,688 --> 01:53:02,848
Come on.

1959
01:53:03,857 --> 01:53:06,985
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1960
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:09,995
What happened, old woman? - Old.

1961
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:11,763
Who are you calling old?

1962
01:53:12,232 --> 01:53:12,926
Where are you going?

1963
01:53:12,999 --> 01:53:14,466
Lahore via Kuwait.

1964
01:53:14,534 --> 01:53:15,296
Where's that?

1965
01:53:15,368 --> 01:53:17,563
Lahore via Kuwait. - I see.

1966
01:53:17,637 --> 01:53:18,797
But, why are you two in a haste?

1967
01:53:18,872 --> 01:53:20,271
Goons are after us.

1968
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:21,568
Give us a lift.

1969
01:53:21,641 --> 01:53:23,233
Quickly.

1970
01:53:23,476 --> 01:53:25,876
I've said many girls in my life.

1971
01:53:25,946 --> 01:53:28,710
Chlorine, lodine, Afreen, Nazneen.

1972
01:53:28,782 --> 01:53:29,612
Hop in.

1973
01:53:29,683 --> 01:53:31,378
Yes, get in.

1974
01:53:31,451 --> 01:53:33,715
Get in. - Or those goons will come.

1975
01:53:33,787 --> 01:53:35,379
Grandma!

1976
01:53:35,455 --> 01:53:36,888
Let's go. - Grandma!

1977
01:53:37,557 --> 01:53:40,355
Grandma! - Sit down baby!

1978
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:43,820
Seema's been kidnapped.

1979
01:53:46,566 --> 01:53:47,498
Stop.

1980
01:53:47,567 --> 01:53:49,660
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1981
01:53:49,736 --> 01:53:50,794
My granddaughter's been kidnapped.

1982
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:51,928
My granddaughter's been kidnapped.

1983
01:53:52,038 --> 01:53:55,269
Grandma, you're overacting.

1984
01:53:56,276 --> 01:53:56,799
Let's go.

1985
01:53:56,876 --> 01:53:58,741
Grandma, think about your age.

1986
01:54:05,185 --> 01:54:06,675
Let me go.

1987
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,450
Let me go. Help. Help.

1988
01:54:09,522 --> 01:54:10,580
Rascal. Let me go.

1989
01:54:10,657 --> 01:54:14,616
Now, there's not even
a dog around this place.

1990
01:54:14,728 --> 01:54:16,889
Why? There's you three.

1991
01:54:17,364 --> 01:54:19,958
Just let me go,
and I'll rearrange your faces.

1992
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,792
We've already changed that.

1993
01:54:21,868 --> 01:54:23,961
What nonsense... - What nonsense.

1994
01:54:24,204 --> 01:54:25,831
Shut up, sister-in-law. - Shut up.

1995
01:54:25,905 --> 01:54:27,770
Bobby... Babby...

1996
01:54:32,212 --> 01:54:34,612
You must be thinking...

1997
01:54:34,681 --> 01:54:38,481
...some hero will come
save you in this graveyard.

1998
01:54:38,752 --> 01:54:39,776
He'll come on a scooter.

1999
01:54:39,853 --> 01:54:43,254
And he'll shout 'Stop'!

2000
01:54:43,323 --> 01:54:45,382
Stop!

2001
01:54:46,326 --> 01:54:48,658
The saviour's here. Slayer of Sinners.

2002
01:54:48,828 --> 01:54:53,322
Destroyer of evil.

2003
01:54:55,001 --> 01:54:59,904
Like Rajnikant...
I can... - That's better.

2004
01:55:00,206 --> 01:55:03,664
Let the girl go, or else...
When I'm good, I'm good.

2005
01:55:03,743 --> 01:55:06,735
When I'm good, I'm good.
When I'm bad, I'm even better.

2006
01:55:08,982 --> 01:55:12,179
Sorry.

2007
01:55:18,625 --> 01:55:19,751
Sid!

2008
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:27,563
Like I said,
don't lock horns with Thakur.

2009
01:55:28,268 --> 01:55:29,200
What are you doing?

2010
01:55:29,269 --> 01:55:30,395
Just a minute.

2011
01:55:31,204 --> 01:55:32,933
That's all? - That's all for today.

2012
01:55:33,006 --> 01:55:34,803
I'll beat them black and blue.
- No, no. Let them go.

2013
01:55:34,874 --> 01:55:36,933
I won't spare them. - Siddharth.

2014
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:39,001
I'll teach them a lesson.

2015
01:55:39,346 --> 01:55:41,405
Why you...

2016
01:55:53,493 --> 01:55:55,586
It's my butt baby.

2017
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:58,493
Seema. What are you doing?

2018
01:55:58,565 --> 01:55:59,725
Leave me.

2019
01:55:59,933 --> 01:56:02,367
He's an old man.
- Who are you calling old?

2020
01:56:02,569 --> 01:56:05,800
Listen. Control yourself.
- Leave me. They were kidnapping me.

2021
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,240
Police? - Police. We did nothing.

2022
01:56:09,309 --> 01:56:10,708
We're just playing.

2023
01:56:16,416 --> 01:56:18,350
Look at their faces.

2024
01:56:18,518 --> 01:56:19,678
Look.

2025
01:56:19,753 --> 01:56:22,221
They look like rapists.

2026
01:56:24,424 --> 01:56:26,722
And, him. Bomb specialist.

2027
01:56:26,793 --> 01:56:28,317
And me? Me?

2028
01:56:28,762 --> 01:56:31,196
And he... - What happened, sir?

2029
01:56:31,431 --> 01:56:32,728
He looks like a terrorist.

2030
01:56:32,799 --> 01:56:35,734
Inspector.
Not every bearded man's Osama.

2031
01:56:35,802 --> 01:56:37,565
He can be Kabuliwala as well.

2032
01:56:37,637 --> 01:56:38,831
See. See. See.

2033
01:56:38,905 --> 01:56:39,997
Uncle!

2034
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:41,666
Uncle, you?

2035
01:56:41,741 --> 01:56:44,574
Your grandma forced me... to do this.

2036
01:56:44,811 --> 01:56:48,440
No, dear.
These two forced me to do this.

2037
01:56:48,848 --> 01:56:50,839
Jagawar. - Bakhtawar.

2038
01:56:52,619 --> 01:56:53,984
You two...

2039
01:56:54,487 --> 01:56:55,545
They're my friends.

2040
01:56:55,755 --> 01:56:57,689
Jai. - Omi.

2041
01:56:57,957 --> 01:57:02,519
Seema, they tried
to separate us, but...

2042
01:57:02,695 --> 01:57:04,162
Then they realised their mistake.

2043
01:57:04,364 --> 01:57:05,524
Yes, sister-in-law Seema.

2044
01:57:05,598 --> 01:57:07,498
Seeing Sid's true love for you...

2045
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:09,865
...we thought we should
correct our mistake.

2046
01:57:09,936 --> 01:57:13,770
Those card, bikini,
messages, those flop lines were ours.

2047
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,502
Sid didn't... - Sid's really nice,
sister-in-law Seema.

2048
01:57:16,576 --> 01:57:17,668
He's very nice.

2049
01:57:17,877 --> 01:57:19,674
We're nice too. - We're nice.

2050
01:57:19,746 --> 01:57:21,577
But we're really sorry. - Sorry.

2051
01:57:21,648 --> 01:57:24,674
Seema, forgive them.
Their intentions were good.

2052
01:57:24,851 --> 01:57:26,341
Forgive me too.

2053
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:28,580
I am sorry, Seema.

2054
01:57:28,788 --> 01:57:30,255
Very sorry.

2055
01:57:32,959 --> 01:57:34,449
Seema.

2056
01:57:35,662 --> 01:57:38,563
Would you like to hang out
with me for the rest of your life?

2057
01:57:39,766 --> 01:57:41,358
Please.

2058
01:57:44,871 --> 01:57:46,236
Awesome, boss.

2059
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,733
Over and out.

2060
01:57:50,477 --> 01:57:52,001
It's done. It's done.

2061
01:57:52,245 --> 01:57:54,577
But who will get us out of here?
- Who will.

2062
01:57:54,647 --> 01:57:55,978
I will.

2063
01:57:56,783 --> 01:57:58,751
I? Who's that?

2064
01:58:07,694 --> 01:58:08,752
Surprised?

2065
01:58:09,195 --> 01:58:11,891
Mr. Joseph, Ms. Josephine.

2066
01:58:12,198 --> 01:58:14,496
You two are in love.

2067
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:21,868
Over and out.

2068
01:58:22,408 --> 01:58:23,636
Mother!

2069
01:58:23,776 --> 01:58:25,243
Go Major. Go for him.

2070
01:58:35,255 --> 01:58:36,688
Where are you going?

2071
01:58:36,823 --> 01:58:39,485
Let go. I said leave me. - Bring her...

2072
01:58:39,559 --> 01:58:42,551
So, You're Seema's real He-man.

2073
01:58:42,695 --> 01:58:44,663
Even if you're not wearing
your underwear outside.

2074
01:58:44,731 --> 01:58:45,755
You're her true Superman.

2075
01:58:45,832 --> 01:58:47,231
Wow.

2076
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:47,994
Beat him.

2077
01:58:48,234 --> 01:58:49,758
What would I do without you two?

2078
01:58:49,969 --> 01:58:51,231
Beat him.

2079
01:59:06,352 --> 01:59:07,751
Come on.

2080
01:59:09,188 --> 01:59:10,587
Sid, come on.

2081
01:59:12,325 --> 01:59:14,293
Sid's winning.

2082
01:59:22,335 --> 01:59:25,498
See Omi, he really beat him up.
- Daddy, please.

2083
01:59:25,572 --> 01:59:26,630
Please, daddy.

2084
01:59:26,706 --> 01:59:30,608
Sir. Army-civilian, what's all this...

2085
01:59:31,377 --> 01:59:32,935
Why don't you understand...

2086
01:59:33,179 --> 01:59:35,409
...that a common man joins the army.

2087
01:59:37,483 --> 01:59:43,353
Sir... as a father,
you've the first right over Seema.

2088
01:59:46,693 --> 01:59:47,990
She's your daughter.

2089
01:59:48,661 --> 01:59:49,787
Just a minute.

2090
01:59:52,498 --> 01:59:54,466
Awesome, friend.

2091
01:59:55,335 --> 01:59:59,499
Chiku. We always fought over a minute.

2092
01:59:59,839 --> 02:00:01,204
I was right.

2093
02:00:01,407 --> 02:00:03,238
One minute is very valuable.

2094
02:00:03,543 --> 02:00:06,478
This boy's explained me the
value of one minute in a minute.

2095
02:00:06,546 --> 02:00:09,242
In one minute. - Brother.

2096
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:13,342
Chiku. - Go on.

2097
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,285
Santru.

2098
02:00:16,155 --> 02:00:19,249
From today I'm your blanket,
you're my quilt.

2099
02:00:19,592 --> 02:00:22,288
I am your Honda, you are my Hundai.

2100
02:00:22,695 --> 02:00:25,562
I am underwear, and you're my necktie.

2101
02:00:25,865 --> 02:00:27,833
I salute you, brother.

2102
02:00:30,703 --> 02:00:31,863
Mom. I did it.

2103
02:00:31,938 --> 02:00:33,735
So...

2104
02:00:36,309 --> 02:00:38,903
So friends...

2105
02:00:39,579 --> 02:00:41,877
In this temple of education...

2106
02:00:41,948 --> 02:00:44,974
...there's a statue of education here,
and speeches there.

2107
02:00:47,487 --> 02:00:50,718
...there's a statue of education here,
and speeches there.

2108
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:52,519
But unfortunately...

2109
02:00:52,859 --> 02:00:57,353
Unfortunately, we don't
have Dirty Picture's Vidya Balan.

2110
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:01,831
Thank you.

2111
02:01:02,201 --> 02:01:03,725
Great, great.

2112
02:01:03,903 --> 02:01:06,929
Who are you?
Who appoints people to beat up others?

2113
02:01:07,306 --> 02:01:09,137
Every poet has feelings.

2114
02:01:09,509 --> 02:01:11,739
Now run after me if you want to.

2115
02:01:24,524 --> 02:01:25,923
Handsome and healthy.

2116
02:01:26,359 --> 02:01:27,792
But stupid idiots.

2117
02:01:28,294 --> 02:01:31,821
But one and the same.

2118
02:01:42,975 --> 02:01:44,772
Handsome and healthy.
But stupid idiots.

2119
02:01:44,844 --> 02:01:46,539
But one and the same.

2120
02:01:46,612 --> 02:01:48,512
Useless, good for nothing.
Ward off the evil-eye.

2121
02:01:48,581 --> 02:01:50,378
Friends on the face.

2122
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:52,281
Enemies behind the back.

2123
02:01:52,351 --> 02:01:53,978
If you're in a problem,
just cut out.

2124
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,847
If it's free, use all you want.

2125
02:01:55,922 --> 02:01:57,651
Save yourself and run.

2126
02:01:57,724 --> 02:02:01,160
They always chat on whatsapp.

2127
02:02:01,427 --> 02:02:04,521
But, they pull the
rug from below your feet.

2128
02:02:04,597 --> 02:02:08,624
Always ready to slander you.

2129
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,737
Every friend is a rascal.

2130
02:02:11,804 --> 02:02:15,900
Every friend is a rascal.

2131
02:02:16,242 --> 02:02:19,234
Every friend is a rascal.

2132
02:02:19,312 --> 02:02:23,612
Every friend is a rascal.

2133
02:02:37,864 --> 02:02:45,168
They say friends should be trusted,
with eyes closed.

2134
02:02:45,371 --> 02:02:49,364
Listen to me, don't do that.

2135
02:02:49,509 --> 02:02:52,706
Always stay careful of your friends.

2136
02:02:53,246 --> 02:02:54,804
Whether you're happy...

2137
02:02:54,881 --> 02:02:56,781
Or you're sad...

2138
02:02:56,849 --> 02:03:00,410
They'll cut out
and get you in trouble.

2139
02:03:00,586 --> 02:03:03,953
They always chat on whatsapp.

2140
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:07,384
But, they pull the
rug from below your feet.

2141
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:11,519
Always ready to slander you.

2142
02:03:11,597 --> 02:03:14,862
Every friend is a rascal.

2143
02:03:16,869 --> 02:03:18,700
Every friend is a rascal.

2144
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,665
Every friend is a rascal.

2145
02:03:24,477 --> 02:03:26,604
Every friend is a rascal.

2146
02:03:28,014 --> 02:03:30,676
Every friend is a rascal.

2147
02:03:31,484 --> 02:03:35,682
Is a rascal.
