1
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,169
Lunch time

2
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,343
Overseer, the workmen are going to lunch

3
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:13,669
Come over here. Come here

4
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:25,504
Sit down

5
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,045
The ruins of the mansion...

6
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,309
I am demolishing it today

7
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:58,739
How splendid it once was

8
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:05,011
Years ago, I came to Calcutta from my village...

9
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:07,846
...and saw this mansion

10
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,018
How magnificent it was

11
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,759
Brother
- Brother-in-law!

12
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,965
Just arrived?

13
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:54,259
Your last letter didn't say you were coming

14
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:59,195
If only you had let me know...

15
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,271
If you'd sent me a postcard,
I'd have met you at the station

16
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,101
No purdah?

17
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:33,581
I live upstairs. Come along

18
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:48,253
Why stare at them?
Never do that!

19
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:55,110
That was Majhaley Babu.
He's head of the mansion now

20
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,948
Where are they going?
- What is it to you?

21
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:03,756
Don't pry. In this mansion
you'll hear and see nothing

22
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:07,321
They are important people

23
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:13,360
Since I am diligent, they are kind to me

24
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,259
At the beginning, I came here 
to teach the children

25
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:23,554
Their studies ended long ago...

26
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:28,393
... but I am still paid and lodged here

27
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,599
I always will be

28
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,896
Stay with me and see Calcutta

29
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:40,629
I've seen it, brother-in-law.
So many big buildings

30
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,764
So tall, that my neck...

31
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,829
Everything is big here

32
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:52,132
Buildings, people, names.
Prices are big, too

33
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:57,532
At home, milk costs 1.20 for
20 liters and here you get...

34
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:00,874
... 1 1 liters
- Only?

35
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,068
Here everything is big,
and all the weight is borne...

36
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,036
... by us small people

37
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:12,734
We are obliged to submit

38
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,641
I have found a job for you

39
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,144
At a bridal-mark...

40
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:26,247
Mohini Sindoor?
What shall I do in a women's concern?

41
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:30,378
It's not women's work, though

42
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,385
It's good pay, seven rupees a month

43
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:35,374
Plus lunch

44
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:41,280
Lunch, too?
Can I eat as much as I like?

45
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:45,285
Certainly!
But come and sit here

46
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,747
This bed is meant for you

47
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:55,819
Mr. Suvinay, the proprietor, is a
Brahmo Samaji, a noble man.

48
00:10:56,893 --> 00:11:01,156
But Brahmo Samajis are not of our caste

49
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,462
How can I eat at his place?

50
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:08,395
Don't worry, he has employed a Maharaj to cook

51
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:18,662
Nibaran, it's you?

52
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,025
Is all well?

53
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,232
Hurry! The British have been shooting
in the Bazaar again

54
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:32,633
Rest a while. I'll be back soon

55
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,441
Hurry!
Chotte Babu is coming out

56
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,817
I know

57
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,619
I know who you are

58
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,923
You're Teacher's brother-in-law, aren't you?

59
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,919
You're a wonder
- A wonder?

60
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:03,957
Why sit in the dark?
Can't you light that English lamp?

61
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,526
No, you definitely can't

62
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,731
I was afraid I'd break the glass

63
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:15,028
True. When I first...

64
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,836
...came here, l, too, was afraid of that

65
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:24,304
But that wicked girl Chinta has
broken thousands of lamp-glasses

66
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,331
Why are you standing? Sit

67
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:39,242
It's a curious mansion. No one
asks about the cost of breakage

68
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,043
Curious?

69
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,641
Did you see the young master?

70
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:49,478
No? He left in the carriage

71
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,338
Do you know where he has gone?

72
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:02,343
She's the cause of all evils.
I'll tell you about it later

73
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:07,115
I'm run off my feet here.
I never have time to talk

74
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,397
"My eyes..."

75
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:51,495
"are weary and tired"

76
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:07,569
"O beloved, where are you?"

77
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:16,695
"Come home, so gently, so softly"

78
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,444
"A voice calls from afar"

79
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:32,775
"Come home, my beloved"

80
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:41,975
"Come home, my beloved"

81
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:46,949
"A voice calls from afar"

82
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,839
"Come home, my beloved"

83
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:10,222
"The long night is filled with waiting"

84
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:15,023
"My restless heart aches"

85
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,592
"The long night is filled with waiting"

86
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:26,917
"My restless heart aches"

87
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:33,198
" Beloved, do not taunt me so"

88
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:47,831
"Come home, so gently, so softly"

89
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:52,492
"A voice calls from afar"

90
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:55,132
"Come home, my beloved"

91
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:28,679
Teacher, for the nation's uplift
and freedom, the principles...

92
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,279
...of Brahmo Samaj are good

93
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,480
Only those principles can shed
a new light on the nation

94
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:37,881
Throwing bombs will not suffice

95
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,681
Yesterday's bomb incident
proves the foolishness of that

96
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,755
Yes... but didn't you want
a new clerk for your concern?

97
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:54,313
I've the right boy for the job.
- What kind of boy?

98
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,918
He's a villager, but he's educated

99
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:02,926
Hard-working and honest.
He is standing outside

100
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:07,792
Why did you not tell me at once?
Call him upstairs

101
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:18,720
Brother-in-law, come upstairs

102
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,302
Now what was I saying?

103
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:43,000
So people threw bombs.
First remove the faults in society

104
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:48,167
Remove false values, old
customs in the name of religion...

105
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,667
You were saying something about old customs

106
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,140
Society's customs. This...

107
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,244
My late wife regarded him as her brother

108
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,175
He's just arrived

109
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:40,413
Will you drink tea?
- I drink milk, but not now

110
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,521
Where is he from?

111
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,954
Village Fatehpur. Post Gajna.
District Nadia

112
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,825
Fatehpur...

113
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,089
... in Nadia district

114
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,860
Do you knowthat village?

115
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,887
What is his name?
- Bhoothnath

116
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:18,960
The fact is, I was born on Shivratri...

117
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,997
...so my aunt named me Bhoothnath

118
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:38,903
Jabba, such laughter is not suitable...

119
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:40,208
...for girls of our society

120
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,665
Let her laugh. I'm not offended

121
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:50,908
All laugh at my name: it can mean Ghost Man

122
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:56,676
Teacher,
your brother-in-law seems to be a simple man

123
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,935
Bhoothnath,
if you wish you may begin work today

124
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,606
I'll explain the job

125
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,251
They're new

126
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,865
Your meal is ready

127
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,370
So little rice?
- You will not get more

128
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:52,016
The young mistress herself issues the rice

129
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:56,677
I've cooked all there was,
so how can I give you more?

130
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:16,516
This is a crime! Return my land!
My children are starving!

131
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,222
I will stir till you return my land

132
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,192
Another word and your tongue
will be pulled out

133
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:29,490
No! You people have taken
the land of my forefathers

134
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,387
Tell your master...

135
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:33,955
...that if the curse of this poor man...

136
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:48,375
A splendid son-in-law!
There's none like him in all Calcutta

137
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:53,020
Are you drunk?
There's none like him in all lndia!

138
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,345
See how his eyes gleam

139
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:02,714
You have outdone that Cheni
Dutt who tries to compete with us

140
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,821
Cheni Dutt married his cat to an lndian cat

141
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:15,759
When I told him our son-in-law came from Persia...

142
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:17,889
... he was dumbstruck

143
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:21,859
What nonsense you always talk

144
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:32,498
When I told Cheni Dutt you spent
1 0,000 on your cat's marriage...

145
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,462
... he was so surprised, his eyes went like this

146
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:46,700
Fan properly. See the drop of
perspiration on master's neck?

147
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:54,735
Not a moment to spare.
I'm run off my feet here

148
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,735
I have to do everything.
That Chinta does nothing

149
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:06,300
My sister.
Do you know whose maidservant she is?

150
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:13,441
Chotti Bahu's servant. But I am
Chotte Babu's special servant

151
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:19,042
The man I saw you carry
into the mansion the other night?

152
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:23,177
The other night?
I have to bring him home every night

153
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:29,645
What can I say?
My Chotte Babu drinks

154
00:26:30,151 --> 00:26:33,446
He returns at five in the morning...

155
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:38,342
...and falls asleep downstairs

156
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,786
He never gets upstairs

157
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:45,513
Where is he all night?
- What do you think?

158
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,449
With the courtesan

159
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:50,052
He's lost in her spell

160
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:05,422
If only I could...

161
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,490
... I'd cut her hair off

162
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:13,320
That Chunni has bewitched my
master. His wife Chotti Bahu...

163
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,128
... never sees his face

164
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:21,926
The Chotti Bahu who sings
such sad songs at night?

165
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,529
Should she sing songs of joy?

166
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:30,869
If a husband turns from a wife,
what can she do but lament?

167
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:37,066
Chotti Bahu is very unhappy

168
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,467
You haven't seen her

169
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,671
She is fairer than the moon

170
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:55,736
"This much harassment is not good"

171
00:27:56,211 --> 00:28:02,042
"This much harassment is not good"

172
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:05,843
"My love, sweet love, do not torment me so"

173
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,513
"My love, do not torment me"

174
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:15,174
"I'd give my life and soul for you"

175
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:25,943
"This much torment is not good"

176
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:44,586
"These eyes are to intoxicate you"

177
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:52,088
"ln their depths lie tales of love and passion"

178
00:28:54,596 --> 00:29:00,462
"These eyes are to intoxicate you"

179
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:06,424
"ln their depths lie tales of love and passion"

180
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,791
"Let us lose ourselves in this sweet stupor"

181
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:18,999
"Let us lose ourselves in this sweet stupor"

182
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:25,497
"Drink not from the glass.
Come, drink from my eyes"

183
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:31,633
"Let us fill our hearts with this magic passion"

184
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:41,666
"Too much torment is not good, my love"

185
00:29:54,448 --> 00:30:00,144
"You are lost in carefree intoxication"

186
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:08,949
"l am lost in a fever of love"

187
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,746
"You are lost in carefree intoxication"

188
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:20,819
"l am lost in a fever of love"

189
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:27,486
"You lie senseless
while I quiver with love for you"

190
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:33,559
"You lie senseless
while I quiver with love for you"

191
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:40,122
"l know not where I am,
you know not what you are"

192
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:46,397
"This consuming passion will not be denied"

193
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:56,959
"This much harassment is not good"

194
00:30:57,201 --> 00:31:01,192
"My love, sweet love, do not torment me so"

195
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,068
"My love, do not torment me"

196
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:09,793
"I'd give my life and soul for you"

197
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:17,163
"This much torment is not good"

198
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:45,576
Is your father at home?

199
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:50,316
No, he has gone to a meeting

200
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:55,878
This is terrible

201
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:04,786
The proof of the advertisement
must be corrected at once

202
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,053
I'll do it

203
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:22,084
I remember the text.
Read it aloud

204
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:31,328
"The wonderful miracles of Mohini Sindoor"

205
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:33,293
"The lover...

206
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,697
"... and the loved one... "

207
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,861
"...troubled by separation... "

208
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,230
Why stop? Go on

209
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:52,893
"... or whose union is hindered..."

210
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,599
Go on

211
00:32:56,404 --> 00:33:01,839
"...or the beloved who is near... "

212
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:03,503
"... but does not air... "

213
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:05,239
What?

214
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:15,806
"... or the beloved
who is near but does not air... "

215
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,267
Make this correction

216
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:24,908
"...who is near but does not care... "

217
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:36,572
What vegetable should I buy?

218
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:38,808
I'll tell you shortly

219
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,151
Go on

220
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,650
May I ask you something?

221
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:48,315
What?

222
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,345
Who gives rice to the cook?

223
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:55,515
Why?
- Nothing. I just asked

224
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:56,787
But why?

225
00:33:57,423 --> 00:34:02,050
"...or lovers who have quarreled...

226
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:05,621
"All may use Mohini Sindoor"

227
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,560
"Money back if not satisfied"

228
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,049
I'm off

229
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:34,466
Why did you speak against me
to Miss Jabba? It means trouble

230
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:36,995
But l...

231
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,137
Cross my path
and you'll soon lose your job

232
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:48,004
Lots of boys like you
have come and gone here

233
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,709
Bhoothnath, come here

234
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:35,119
Stand here before me

235
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,450
What has this Maharaj told you?

236
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,181
Nothing
- You're lying

237
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:53,785
Then have I lied to father?

238
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:58,560
I heard everything.
Tell father plainly what he said

239
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:05,052
Just that if I crossed his path
I would lost my job

240
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,526
You accepted it in silence?

241
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:13,629
Get out of this house!

242
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:20,492
You're a coward.
Why didn't you complain?

243
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:24,697
I didn't want to bring it up...

244
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:29,893
Excuses! You asked me
who gives rice to the cook

245
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,704
You thought I was giving you less food?

246
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,137
Why should I do that?
What could I have against you?

247
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,536
We've no ties.
All I have to do is see you're fed

248
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,042
Haven't you gone home?

249
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,980
I wanted to talk to your father

250
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:08,942
He is upstairs

251
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:16,981
I wanted to talk to you, too

252
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,279
Well?

253
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:26,478
Well, I've thought it over

254
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,520
So you think!
And what have you thought?

255
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:37,316
I am entirely at fault. I should
have complained about the cook

256
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,055
Forgive me

257
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,788
Why stare?

258
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:59,359
Because of me, the man was sacked

259
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:03,928
Now look at the trouble you've been put to

260
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:08,033
Don't worry, I know how to cook...

261
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:11,258
...although it must frighten you

262
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:14,967
Why should I be frightened?

263
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,695
From tomorrow you must eat
food cooked by me

264
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,798
Will you eat food
prepared by a low-caste?

265
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:29,605
Why are you always taunting
when you talk to me?

266
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,908
How else should I talk?

267
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:43,144
Don't hesitate. Go on, tell me

268
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:47,813
I'm going

269
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:49,977
Going?

270
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:55,741
Weren't you intending to apologize
to my father, too?

271
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:00,017
I'll do that tomorrow morning

272
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:04,041
You could apologize to me
tomorrow morning, also

273
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,615
Was it necessary now?

274
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:25,316
Listen

275
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,223
What is it?

276
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:44,826
The night is so dark and still

277
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,332
Shall the watchman see you home?

278
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:56,233
A man isn't afraid of the dark

279
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:16,603
What are you carrying like that?

280
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:21,141
Destiny. Chotte Babu did not return home

281
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:22,967
Come with me and you will understand

282
00:40:25,144 --> 00:40:29,737
Do people of the mansion deign to come here?

283
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:32,941
To reap barley for a cure...

284
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,046
...one must tread in mud

285
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:38,115
Where is your mistress?

286
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:44,414
Your master's alone.
My mistress is making herself up

287
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,552
Wait here for me

288
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,988
Why are you here, you fool?

289
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:27,197
Yesterday Bahurani observed the
feast of Astami, but you were out

290
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:28,323
Go away

291
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:30,530
Please let the water touch your toe

292
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,228
Unless Bahurani drinks this water...

293
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,590
...she cannot eat

294
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,300
She hasn't eaten at all

295
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:44,327
So? If she wants to prove she's
a devoted wife, why bother me?

296
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:49,395
No bother, sir. Just let your toe touch the water

297
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:50,829
Now get out of here!

298
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:01,196
The glass, sir

299
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:16,673
Let's slip away

300
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:44,517
A miracle

301
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,686
What's that?
- That?

302
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:53,616
She is Bari Bahu, mother of Chottan Babu

303
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,288
She is going to the Ganges

304
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,756
To bathe? In that mosquito net?

305
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,286
Not only will she bathe,
she'll bathe the mosquito net, too

306
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,492
Such purdah?

307
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:10,191
She also has untouchability sickness.
She is a widow

308
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:31,727
It's a very delicate matter

309
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:36,570
Don't tell anyone

310
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:41,533
Chotti Bahu summons you to her room

311
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:44,732
She summons me?

312
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:46,868
Yes. Tonight

313
00:43:47,408 --> 00:43:51,774
Tonight? But I am a man

314
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:59,309
Only men of the family may go
to the women's quarters

315
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,636
True, but don't worry

316
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:07,580
Tonight I shall take you there secretly.
Understand?

317
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,674
Now I must go. I'm run off my feet here

318
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:25,847
"The bee is so naive"

319
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,552
"How he flits about the garden"

320
00:44:52,162 --> 00:45:00,995
"Yet why do the flowers smile for him?"

321
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:05,792
"The bee is so naive"

322
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:10,528
"How he flits about the garden"

323
00:45:11,034 --> 00:45:20,027
"Yet why do the flowers smile for him?"

324
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:24,730
"The bee is so naive"

325
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:48,612
"He flits from flower to flower..."

326
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:53,438
"never betraying his heart's desire"

327
00:45:58,082 --> 00:46:02,417
"He flits from flower to flower... "

328
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:06,941
"never betraying his heart's desire"

329
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:11,876
"He hovers before me, exchanging glances"

330
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:16,051
"He gazes at me, yet remains silent"

331
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:20,581
"He gazes at me, yet remains silent"

332
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:25,622
"The bee is so naive"

333
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:48,496
"Secretly, he drinks nectar from the flowers"

334
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,956
"lntoxicated, he sways as he walks"

335
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:02,031
"Secretly, he drinks nectar from the flowers"

336
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:06,203
"lntoxicated, he sways as he walks"

337
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:10,537
"He is near the heart, yet always far away"

338
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:19,907
"Far away, like one unknown"

339
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:24,933
"The bee is so naive"

340
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:47,748
"lf you surprise him at play..."

341
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:52,312
"... he is quick to fly away"

342
00:47:57,086 --> 00:48:01,314
"lf you surprise him at play... "

343
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:05,485
"... he is quick to fly away"

344
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:10,224
"He never wants to learn"

345
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:18,956
"What an innocent creature he is"

346
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:23,690
"The bee is so naive"

347
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,058
"How he flits about the garden"

348
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:37,098
"Yet why do the flowers smile for him?"

349
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:39,826
"The bee is so naive"

350
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,992
Can't you cough?

351
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,996
How dare you sneak up and hear my poetry!

352
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:02,069
Why stare me? Go to work

353
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:31,175
Come along

354
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:36,273
What if anything goes wrong?

355
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:38,640
Don't go back on your word

356
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:17,624
Who goes there?
- It's Bansi

357
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:21,792
Wait. Bari Bahu is washing her hands

358
00:50:24,132 --> 00:50:29,929
It's the mosquito net lady.
She'll wash her hands all night

359
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:30,961
Bari Bahu

360
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:40,328
Are you counting how many times I've washed?

361
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:44,260
Sixty-two times.
Wash once more

362
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:47,336
Now it's 63

363
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:53,163
Bansi, you can come now

364
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:07,909
Bahurani, here is Teacher's brother-in-law

365
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,510
Bansi, leave now

366
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,314
Come over here, come on

367
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,543
Sit down

368
00:51:38,155 --> 00:51:39,519
You seem to be very shy

369
00:51:47,624 --> 00:51:51,853
They call you Teacher's brother-in-law.
What do I say?

370
00:51:53,927 --> 00:52:01,727
My father named me
Atulya Chakravarty

371
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:07,692
But since he died all call me
by the name my aunt gave me

372
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:12,957
Why not?
Bhoothnath is a lovely name

373
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:27,027
What is wrong?

374
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:36,900
I shall call you Bhoothnath. It is
one of the many names of God

375
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:43,900
Won't you call me Chotti Bahu?

376
00:52:49,077 --> 00:52:51,737
Chinta, serve the offering

377
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:56,976
It is blessed by Shrijadi

378
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:07,274
Do not be shy to eat.
Otherwise, I shall feel bad

379
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:27,188
Bansi tells me you work
at the Mohini Sindoor factory

380
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:29,480
Do you?

381
00:53:30,224 --> 00:53:32,156
Yes, but...

382
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:33,915
There...

383
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,318
I don't get on with Jabba

384
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:47,156
Jabba? Who is she?

385
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:50,129
A girl

386
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:58,156
I mean, the owner of the company...

387
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:05,532
She is his daughter

388
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:16,227
She is very nice,
but she speaks so harshly

389
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:18,428
What has she said?

390
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:25,597
We have to ties - all she has
to do is to see I'm properly fed

391
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:30,968
That's very harsh

392
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:32,674
She also said...

393
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:41,440
I'm talking to you as if
we've known each other a long time

394
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,745
I'm sorry. It's very late

395
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,279
Haven't you learnt
the customs of this house yet?

396
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:00,150
Days are for sleeping and nights
for waking and waking others

397
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:08,312
I have summoned you to relieve the torment

398
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:11,410
Torment?

399
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:18,280
You can't understand,
but you can help me to remove it

400
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:23,720
Why give me money?

401
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:29,849
It's for the bridal mark of
Mohini Sindoor. Bring me a box

402
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,524
For you?
- Yes, for me

403
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:37,261
Tell me, is it effective or not?

404
00:55:39,897 --> 00:55:41,057
I don't know

405
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:43,821
Ask them

406
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:49,929
Discreetly. Do not tell anyone about me

407
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:57,292
If you forbid me, I shall not tell anyone

408
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:02,928
Would you have done,
if I had not forbidden you?

409
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:12,637
Why so perplexed? Don't you know
such things are not talked of?

410
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:19,068
Do not even tell Jabba. She is
unmarried, she won't understand

411
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,276
What won't she understand?

412
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:28,973
It cannot be explained to a man,
or to some women, either

413
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:36,045
It can only be understood
by unfortunate women

414
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:43,083
It is a great disgrace
and a great shame for a woman

415
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,010
I'll await you tomorrow

416
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:14,751
He's Chottan Babu, Bari Bahu's
son. He's very fond of women

417
00:57:15,493 --> 00:57:19,449
Be careful.
Here's the timekeeper

418
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,861
He winds the mansion clocks

419
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:27,825
Who are you?
Where do you live?

420
00:57:28,497 --> 00:57:34,126
Speak up! Are you mute?
What's your name?

421
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,902
Father's name?
Village? District?

422
00:57:43,902 --> 00:57:47,495
How many houses?
How many mansions?

423
00:57:47,737 --> 00:57:50,499
Any mansions?

424
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:56,233
Run back there

425
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:03,535
Stay away from mansions.
I, the timekeeper, tell you this

426
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:08,538
Have you seen a clock? Time?

427
00:58:09,044 --> 00:58:17,604
It overcomes all illusions.
It cures all misconceptions

428
00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:22,778
It has reduced Time into pieces
of hours, minutes, seconds

429
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:28,208
Listen to the sound of time and
recognize the misconceptions

430
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:35,647
Kingdoms do not last.
Palaces do not endure

431
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:38,215
Mansions will not endure

432
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:43,985
I speak the truth, young man.
Time does likewise

433
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:42,535
"l shall not feel sleep heavy upon my eyes"

434
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:48,940
"l shall not feel sleep heavy upon my eyes"

435
00:59:49,308 --> 00:59:53,674
"The glittering night is vibrant"

436
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:59,939
"Throughout the long night
we shall unblinking gaze"

437
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:04,507
"The glittering night is vibrant"

438
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:10,480
"l shall not feel sleep heavy upon my eyes"

439
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:15,609
"The glittering night is vibrant"

440
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:21,611
"Throughout the long night
we shall unblinking gaze"

441
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:26,382
"The glittering night is vibrant"

442
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:22,003
"Wine, the night..."

443
01:01:22,003 --> 01:01:25,061
"and the spell of love"

444
01:01:27,172 --> 01:01:34,039
"How fortunate is he who profits
from this magic"

445
01:01:35,808 --> 01:01:39,798
"The enchantment will endure
the whole night long"

446
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:43,406
"The enchantment will endure
the whole night long"

447
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:46,711
"Why should we worry
about the coming dawn?"

448
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:51,105
"Why should we worry
about the coming dawn?"

449
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:54,645
"The enchantment will endure
the whole night long"

450
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:57,343
"Why should we worry
about the coming dawn?"

451
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:02,106
"lf I can behold your gentle face..."

452
01:02:02,383 --> 01:02:05,782
"what more could I desire?"

453
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:09,719
"what more could I desire?"

454
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:15,642
"Your soul and spirit will be revealed to me"

455
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:20,778
"The glittering night is vibrant"

456
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:26,291
"l shall not feel sleep heavy upon my eyes"

457
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:31,589
"The glittering night is vibrant"

458
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,683
"The glittering night is vibrant"

459
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:26,436
"Those consumed by the fire of love..."

460
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:30,441
"have lost control of their destiny"

461
01:03:32,178 --> 01:03:35,805
"This is the passion..."

462
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:40,644
"which enters all hearts"

463
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:45,803
"Who is not lost in love?"

464
01:03:46,115 --> 01:03:50,015
"Who is not lost in love?"

465
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:53,680
"Who does not sigh with longing?"

466
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:57,382
"Who does not sigh with longing?"

467
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:01,375
"Who is not lost in love?"

468
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:05,075
"Who does not sigh with longing?"

469
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:09,046
" Beauty will enthrall you"

470
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:12,953
"There can be no escape"

471
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:17,052
"There can be no escape"

472
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:23,424
"Your life will be lost in your unblinking gaze"

473
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:27,991
"The glittering night is vibrant"

474
01:04:29,195 --> 01:04:33,925
"l shall not feel sleep heavy upon my eyes"

475
01:04:34,464 --> 01:04:38,989
"The glittering night is vibrant"

476
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:45,125
"Throughout the long night
we shall unblinking gaze"

477
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:55,925
"The glittering night is vibrant"

478
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:35,076
Don't worry, you won't lose
your high caste

479
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:41,152
Now you can eat without fear

480
01:05:41,453 --> 01:05:42,781
I have employed a new cook

481
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,846
That wasn't what was worrying me

482
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:55,044
I know we villagers eat a lot of rice,
but still...

483
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:57,249
You must eat it

484
01:05:58,357 --> 01:06:03,758
If you're even a bit hungry,
you'll be cross with me again

485
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:10,355
Tell me...

486
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:15,787
If used properly, is Mohini
Sindoor really effective?

487
01:06:16,463 --> 01:06:20,021
I'm sorry, but I have had no call to use it yet

488
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:24,555
Do you want to use it?

489
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,493
Who will you try it on?

490
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:33,129
It's not for me, is it?

491
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:36,958
If so, you'll be the loser

492
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:41,366
Please don't joke about it

493
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:44,929
I must buy it for someone else

494
01:06:46,805 --> 01:06:52,502
She is a very unhappy, very tormented

495
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:55,007
Who is she?

496
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:59,198
My Chotti Bahu
- "Yours"?

497
01:07:00,876 --> 01:07:01,807
What torment?

498
01:07:03,678 --> 01:07:08,770
It is a great disgrace
and a great shame for a woman

499
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:11,609
What sort of torment?

500
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:20,304
It is very great trouble.
But you will not understand

501
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:22,774
Explain it

502
01:07:24,683 --> 01:07:27,276
How? You are still unmarried

503
01:07:29,185 --> 01:07:31,482
Who is she, "your" Chotti Bahu?

504
01:07:32,653 --> 01:07:36,050
I will not tell you, she has forbidden it

505
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,713
She seems to have command over you

506
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:45,416
I promised not to tell anyone,
not even Jabba

507
01:07:45,857 --> 01:07:48,483
Me? Does she know me?

508
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:53,353
I told her everything
- What did you tell her?

509
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:56,591
Did you complain?

510
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:02,994
Not even your enemies
would complain against you

511
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:07,462
I said...

512
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:12,031
You said? Go on, say it.
Why do you stop?

513
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:14,521
You won't like it

514
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:17,493
Even so, I won't reduce your rations

515
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,358
I knowthat

516
01:08:21,668 --> 01:08:27,226
We have no ties - all you have to do
is see I'm properly fed

517
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,730
Did you tell Chotti Bahu all that?

518
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:34,965
I told her everything

519
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:39,869
You don't tell me what she says,
but you tell her what I say

520
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,400
Go on. Tell me what you told her

521
01:08:44,675 --> 01:08:47,664
It's very hot; it's a chili

522
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:53,601
I used to think you're naive.
Now I know you're wicked, too

523
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,972
Elder sister!

524
01:09:06,115 --> 01:09:08,742
It's time to eat.
What are you doing?

525
01:09:09,317 --> 01:09:11,749
Her hands are unclean

526
01:09:12,117 --> 01:09:15,982
A crow perched on her clothes
so her hands are unclean

527
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:21,742
Majli Bahu, do not laugh

528
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:29,319
One day you may be afflicted
with this sickness

529
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:32,046
Do not laugh

530
01:09:32,491 --> 01:09:37,719
Should I seal my lips?
Your antics make people laugh

531
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:42,754
Chotti Bahu, come and see

532
01:09:47,328 --> 01:09:53,125
Why tease her?
The poor widow does no one any harm

533
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:54,794
Why tease her?

534
01:09:55,365 --> 01:10:00,389
Don't stand up for her. Do I say
anything when you lie in your...

535
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:02,629
... husband's arms?

536
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,034
When am I ever near your brother-in-law?

537
01:10:09,502 --> 01:10:14,868
When do I have the opportunity
When does he ever stay at home?

538
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:16,897
Stop lamenting shamelessly

539
01:10:17,805 --> 01:10:21,397
My brother-in-law is a man of a rich family

540
01:10:21,705 --> 01:10:24,604
He enjoys song and dance all night

541
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:28,538
I come from a poor family

542
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:33,976
All know is that a woman
lives for her husband

543
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,035
If the husband stays away...

544
01:10:37,445 --> 01:10:39,433
What are these ornaments for?

545
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:41,241
What is this life for?

546
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,445
Have some shame. You ruin the
prestige of the Chaudhary family

547
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:57,677
I've never seen a woman
who pines for her husband

548
01:11:02,752 --> 01:11:05,218
I want to ask you something

549
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:06,945
What is that?

550
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:14,518
Do your advertisements
for Mohini Sindoor speak true?

551
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:19,754
My father started the business

552
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:24,355
He was an orthodox Hindu
not a Brahmo Samaji like me

553
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,255
I became Brahmo Samaji after my marriage

554
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,125
I asked about Mohini Sindoor
- I'm coming to it

555
01:11:32,694 --> 01:11:36,526
Goddess Bhawani revealed Mohini
Sindoor to my father in a dream

556
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:40,858
He believed in this boon

557
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,455
He began the business which I continue

558
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:46,389
But do you believe in it?

559
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:49,655
Here's Dharamdasji, head of the Samaj

560
01:11:56,368 --> 01:11:58,527
My nephew, Supavitar

561
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,494
He has passed his M. A.

562
01:12:03,772 --> 01:12:04,829
Come in

563
01:12:16,776 --> 01:12:22,471
I was waiting for you.
The offering is on the table

564
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,139
Have you brought it?

565
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,068
Yes, Chotti Bahu

566
01:12:33,446 --> 01:12:35,436
Show me the Sindoor

567
01:12:50,185 --> 01:12:53,846
Is Chotte Babu in?
- No, he has gone out

568
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,646
Tell the kitchen I shall not eat today

569
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:03,886
Do not bring me food.
Go and fetch Bansi

570
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:07,254
Why won't you eat today?

571
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:15,418
There is no other way to fulfill my desire

572
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:26,462
I was very young when I was
married. My mother said to me:

573
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:30,998
"Daughter, serve your husband..."

574
01:13:32,332 --> 01:13:34,561
"The husband is a god"

575
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:43,429
When I come here I found that
my husband was never at home

576
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:47,427
Tell me, whom shall I serve?

577
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,702
This is a curious house

578
01:13:55,572 --> 01:13:57,801
I married into a grand house

579
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:03,697
Plenty of wealth, servants, ornaments

580
01:14:04,075 --> 01:14:06,474
I have every comfort

581
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:10,138
But all these comforts are meaningless

582
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:14,135
The greatest comfort a woman can have...

583
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,145
You sent for me?

584
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:29,276
By some means,
bring Chotte Babu to my room tomorrow

585
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:33,740
How? Chotte Babu sleeps all afternoon

586
01:14:34,384 --> 01:14:36,078
As soon as he gets up

587
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:41,681
Tell him I am very ill
and I have eaten nothing

588
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:44,853
Ask him to see me once.
Understand?

589
01:14:45,588 --> 01:14:47,247
Yes, Bahurani

590
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,318
You were surprised

591
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:59,116
You think your Chotti Bahu is a liar

592
01:14:59,526 --> 01:15:04,517
But, believe me, my Lord knows
I have never told a lie

593
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:11,291
But today I lie for my husband's benefit,
isn't that so?

594
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:14,491
Your husband's benefit?

595
01:15:15,764 --> 01:15:22,427
Yes, Bhoothnath.
His daily outings, his drinking

596
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:25,264
How long will his health last?

597
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:29,760
May it be effective

598
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:33,763
Don't worry, the Sindoor
will definitely be effective

599
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:38,302
It will, won't it?
My heart say's so

600
01:15:40,772 --> 01:15:44,967
Until the day I die, I shall not forget
your kindness

601
01:15:56,977 --> 01:16:01,273
If you ever have any troubles,
inform me through Bansi

602
01:16:02,379 --> 01:16:04,402
Do not forget Chotti Bahu

603
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,269
I won't forget

604
01:16:27,653 --> 01:16:29,711
The British are coming!

605
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,832
Run!

606
01:18:21,088 --> 01:18:26,523
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

607
01:18:26,857 --> 01:18:31,257
"l have lost my tranquility, my very self"

608
01:18:31,693 --> 01:18:36,060
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

609
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:41,824
"l have lost my tranquility, my very self"

610
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:47,162
"Every step I hear, I think it is you"

611
01:18:47,763 --> 01:18:52,424
"Every step I hear, I think it is you"

612
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:57,565
"l hide my face beneath the finest veil"

613
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:04,927
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

614
01:19:26,177 --> 01:19:31,010
"When you enter the courtyard of my world..."

615
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:36,673
"all doors open to you"

616
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:46,608
"When you enter the courtyard of my world... "

617
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:51,509
"all doors open to you"

618
01:19:52,184 --> 01:19:56,845
"all doors open to you"

619
01:19:57,553 --> 01:20:02,384
"l sense that my beloved is near"

620
01:20:02,821 --> 01:20:07,413
"l sense that my beloved is near"

621
01:20:07,788 --> 01:20:12,745
"Showers of petals fill the air"

622
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:17,691
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

623
01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:23,251
"l have lost my tranquility, my very self"

624
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:30,688
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

625
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:57,369
"l anoint my brow with bridal vermilion,
with Sindoor"

626
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:02,265
"l make myself beautiful for my beloved"

627
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:12,599
"l anoint my brow with bridal vermilion,
with Sindoor"

628
01:21:13,075 --> 01:21:17,873
"l make myself beautiful for my beloved"

629
01:21:18,077 --> 01:21:22,977
"l make myself beautiful for my beloved"

630
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:29,137
"Fearing my beloved may cast an evil eye..."

631
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:33,847
"Fearing my beloved may cast an evil eye..."

632
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:38,980
"l darken my eyes with kohl"

633
01:21:39,651 --> 01:21:44,142
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

634
01:21:44,452 --> 01:21:49,351
"l have lost my tranquility, my very self"

635
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,955
"Every step I hear, I think it is you"

636
01:21:54,955 --> 01:21:59,889
"l hide my face beneath the finest veil"

637
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:07,885
" Beloved, you have cast such a spell on me"

638
01:22:22,498 --> 01:22:26,988
Why have you called me here?
Why so silent?

639
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,363
Look at me, just this once

640
01:22:44,171 --> 01:22:45,637
You see nothing?

641
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:49,802
What nonsense, I have no time
to stare at your face

642
01:22:51,806 --> 01:22:56,002
Please, even if you don't like to look at me...

643
01:22:56,342 --> 01:23:00,365
... please don't go there today, I beg you

644
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:05,633
Do you think
all the males in this house are impotent?

645
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:11,836
Living close to a wife
does not make a husband impotent

646
01:23:12,579 --> 01:23:15,512
We wed according to the rites of Hinduism

647
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:22,683
Have you no duty towards me?

648
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,409
He who learns from a wife...

649
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:26,681
... has no shame

650
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:40,845
How are you?

651
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:50,413
At least it's as well the bullet
struck you in the leg

652
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:57,957
What if it were?
Who is there to weep over me?

653
01:23:59,328 --> 01:24:03,760
No one?
- I don't see anyone

654
01:24:04,796 --> 01:24:08,763
I've heard of someone.

655
01:24:08,763 --> 01:24:10,094
Who?

656
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:13,323
You murmured her name in delirium

657
01:24:15,565 --> 01:24:16,998
I murmured?

658
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:21,962
All the time. Tell me...

659
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:24,096
What are you to her?

660
01:24:29,937 --> 01:24:32,563
You hear the name and you are lost

661
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:37,329
Is she very beautiful?

662
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,102
You would understand if you were to see her

663
01:24:43,741 --> 01:24:47,505
That's enough. I can imagine how she looks

664
01:24:50,311 --> 01:24:53,277
One can imagine beauties...

665
01:24:55,945 --> 01:25:01,073
... but my Chotti Bahu is beyond imagination

666
01:25:01,981 --> 01:25:05,777
Don't you think of anything but her?

667
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:11,882
You're angry. Very well,
I will never mention her again

668
01:25:14,051 --> 01:25:18,006
What if you do?
Who am I to stop you?

669
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:20,284
You are quite right

670
01:25:21,253 --> 01:25:26,312
We have no ties - all you have to do
is see I'm properly fed

671
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,419
Will you never forget?

672
01:25:45,427 --> 01:25:47,690
I've looked everywhere for you

673
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:54,830
How are you? Does it hurt?

674
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,798
Chotti Bahu?

675
01:25:59,899 --> 01:26:02,161
Why did she run away?

676
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,266
Chotti Bahu?

677
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:12,067
She had ordered me to find you;
the palanquin is outside

678
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:16,697
Does Chotte Babu stay at home now?

679
01:26:17,904 --> 01:26:19,427
Don't talk of such things

680
01:26:19,839 --> 01:26:25,205
A leopard cannot change his
spots. He slips away every day

681
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:29,506
Didn't the Mohini Sindoor work?

682
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:33,205
Does Chotti Bahu use it?

683
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:36,410
Yes. On her forehead and in her hair parting

684
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:41,276
A mark as large as a rupee coin

685
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:44,440
But it's no use

686
01:26:44,846 --> 01:26:47,439
It's all my fault, Bansi

687
01:26:48,347 --> 01:26:52,576
If I hadn't given the Sindoor to Chotti Bahu...

688
01:26:54,483 --> 01:27:00,144
Are you worse? We have been
so worried about you

689
01:27:00,584 --> 01:27:03,915
Suvinay Babu, I must go.
I cannot stay any longer

690
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,578
Why? Do you lack anything?

691
01:27:08,019 --> 01:27:14,420
No, you have cared for me well
- Then why leave?

692
01:27:14,956 --> 01:27:22,289
I cannot stay. In giving
Sindoor to someone, I have...

693
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:23,749
...done her injustice

694
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:28,281
Why didn't you tell me?

695
01:27:41,593 --> 01:27:44,329
Bansi, how is Bhoothnath?

696
01:27:44,332 --> 01:27:48,026
The doctor says he'll be
skipping about in a few days

697
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:58,663
See that he lacks nothing.
I shall pay for every medicine

698
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:05,097
Was that Chotti Bahu?

699
01:28:05,472 --> 01:28:12,507
Yes, that door leads
to the room of Chotti Bahu

700
01:28:12,507 --> 01:28:16,339
Then this room must be
in the women's quarters

701
01:28:16,776 --> 01:28:18,571
It is and it isn't

702
01:28:19,543 --> 01:28:21,532
It is a secret room

703
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:31,275
But the mansion has many
rooms; why put me in this one?

704
01:28:31,813 --> 01:28:38,515
Perhaps Chotti Bahu ordered
it, to keep you under her care

705
01:28:38,515 --> 01:28:42,244
I'm run off my feet here

706
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,479
Bansi

707
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:00,479
I'm fortunate you're here

708
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:02,388
Where is that fool?

709
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:08,455
Sit here for a while, I'll call Bansi

710
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:11,483
I'll find him
- Listen to me

711
01:29:12,224 --> 01:29:13,088
Something to say?

712
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:20,919
Only that I haven't seen you for many days

713
01:29:21,262 --> 01:29:25,218
Well, take a good look now.
Satisfied?

714
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:33,464
A look. To see you all my life
would not be enough for me

715
01:29:33,566 --> 01:29:36,532
What nonsense you talk. I'll be late

716
01:29:41,301 --> 01:29:45,997
You go there every day.
Stay with me just once

717
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:50,736
I am a man,
not a bunch of keys tied to your sari

718
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:56,867
Just for today.
Give me a chance to serve you

719
01:30:06,242 --> 01:30:07,265
Why do you laugh?

720
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:10,899
Do you know how to serve?

721
01:30:12,678 --> 01:30:16,133
Give me a chance, then you will know

722
01:30:16,746 --> 01:30:20,907
I am a Chaudhary. I have hot blood in my veins

723
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:25,006
The women of this mansion cannot serve us

724
01:30:27,749 --> 01:30:32,774
I'm not like the other wives;
I come from a poor family

725
01:30:35,585 --> 01:30:40,484
I can do everything to please my husband

726
01:30:44,054 --> 01:30:45,748
Can you sing to please me?

727
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:51,255
Will you like my songs?

728
01:30:51,622 --> 01:30:56,614
Not devotional songs - romantic
songs, such as Cunni Dasi sings

729
01:30:57,125 --> 01:31:01,355
Will you sing, dance and drink wine?

730
01:31:02,492 --> 01:31:03,322
Wine?

731
01:31:04,027 --> 01:31:08,154
Will you drink wine all night with me?

732
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:13,585
You wanted to serve me

733
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,497
How can you serve me?

734
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:40,931
Bhoothnath, come here

735
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:16,876
Come over here

736
01:32:20,817 --> 01:32:22,408
I am here

737
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:25,910
It's so dark

738
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,448
It is better not to see my face today

739
01:32:31,887 --> 01:32:36,151
Today I have summoned you to do something...

740
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:40,921
...that should make a woman die of shame

741
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,416
Die of shame?

742
01:32:45,725 --> 01:32:46,817
Yes, Bhoothnath

743
01:32:49,293 --> 01:32:52,749
Who else but you could I tell?

744
01:32:53,994 --> 01:32:58,928
There is no one but you
to understand my torment

745
01:32:59,629 --> 01:33:01,563
Why summon me?

746
01:33:03,698 --> 01:33:05,756
No one should know

747
01:33:08,665 --> 01:33:10,098
Bring me wine

748
01:33:14,168 --> 01:33:15,327
You will drink?

749
01:33:16,302 --> 01:33:18,165
I shall have to drink

750
01:33:19,602 --> 01:33:25,004
I shall do whatever he wishes

751
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:31,734
He wants me to drink wine

752
01:33:34,273 --> 01:33:35,740
So I shall drink

753
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:41,966
If you become addicted, you will be ruined

754
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:46,000
What if I am ruined?

755
01:33:47,311 --> 01:33:53,542
If a man does not love his wife,
she has no place in this world

756
01:33:54,547 --> 01:33:57,308
I shall not bring wine for you

757
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,375
You must. This is my last hope.
- I will not

758
01:34:01,716 --> 01:34:04,377
You must, or I shall never win my husband

759
01:34:04,584 --> 01:34:09,414
No, I cannot bear to see you destroyed

760
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:12,080
You are fond of me, aren't you?

761
01:34:13,819 --> 01:34:19,618
If you really want me to be happy,
do this for me

762
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:21,816
Bring wine for me

763
01:34:23,389 --> 01:34:24,753
For my sake

764
01:35:10,194 --> 01:35:11,632
My dear Lord

765
01:35:27,676 --> 01:35:31,666
Where were you?
- Fetching dried fruit for you

766
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:38,645
The dried fruit is here.
Now more excuses

767
01:35:39,612 --> 01:35:40,636
Drink

768
01:35:43,014 --> 01:35:47,243
Go on. I shall drink later

769
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:51,509
I have drunk alone too long.
Now you take some

770
01:35:51,983 --> 01:35:53,677
Go on. Drink

771
01:36:10,023 --> 01:36:11,512
No courage?

772
01:36:12,657 --> 01:36:15,089
No, it's not that

773
01:36:17,925 --> 01:36:19,983
Will I get very drunk?

774
01:36:21,893 --> 01:36:26,417
No matter how drunk,
you will look just as beautiful

775
01:36:37,897 --> 01:36:39,454
Look away

776
01:36:40,933 --> 01:36:43,559
Are you shy of me?

777
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,394
Start

778
01:36:55,337 --> 01:36:56,428
It's bitter

779
01:36:57,904 --> 01:37:01,234
I'll show you

780
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:39,040
Kingdoms do not last.
Palaces do not endure

781
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:42,543
These mansions will not endure

782
01:38:04,124 --> 01:38:04,919
May I come in?

783
01:38:05,558 --> 01:38:11,789
We were just thinking of you

784
01:38:12,728 --> 01:38:14,251
Did you get my message?

785
01:38:18,263 --> 01:38:19,990
You're ill?

786
01:38:20,396 --> 01:38:25,353
I have been unwell since the day you left

787
01:38:27,066 --> 01:38:30,397
I have given up the Sindoor business

788
01:38:31,499 --> 01:38:34,228
Given it up? Why?

789
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:37,802
You ask why?

790
01:38:39,235 --> 01:38:43,760
Bhoothnath, I have much to say to you

791
01:38:45,404 --> 01:38:48,394
Jabba, go and bring that letter

792
01:38:57,642 --> 01:39:00,768
For many days I have felt a certain apprehension

793
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:03,674
Apprehension?

794
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:08,334
You were born in Fatehpur,
Nadia district?

795
01:39:08,845 --> 01:39:11,107
Yes. Why?

796
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:17,073
Your parents died when you were a child?

797
01:39:17,847 --> 01:39:21,406
When I was four

798
01:39:23,016 --> 01:39:27,541
In his old age, father lived in Fatehpur

799
01:39:28,585 --> 01:39:29,709
Was your father's name...

800
01:39:40,489 --> 01:39:43,353
Five hundred rupees for you
- For me?

801
01:39:44,955 --> 01:39:46,786
Keep them

802
01:39:49,591 --> 01:39:56,423
I promised Master to care for you;
now I cannot give work

803
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:01,255
Do not refuse the money,
or I shall have no peace

804
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,686
Why distress father, when he is so unwell?

805
01:40:07,463 --> 01:40:11,192
Take this letter of introduction to Mr. Rupchand

806
01:40:11,598 --> 01:40:16,088
He is a big contractor;
he will give you a good job

807
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:20,098
Thank you

808
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:22,661
There is something else

809
01:40:23,502 --> 01:40:29,334
Jabba is my only daughter.
Now she is of age to marry

810
01:40:29,604 --> 01:40:33,093
Father, the doctor told you not to talk much

811
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:38,165
Should I stand on ceremony with him?

812
01:40:39,606 --> 01:40:42,301
You can see how my health is

813
01:40:42,842 --> 01:40:46,832
That's why I want Jabba
to marry next month

814
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:55,604
I cannot do that
without your help, Bhoothnath

815
01:40:56,311 --> 01:40:59,745
I am unworthy

816
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:03,609
I have utmost faith in you. I am an ill man

817
01:41:03,981 --> 01:41:05,777
Tend to the marriage formalities

818
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:14,378
I have found a good husband for her

819
01:41:14,584 --> 01:41:15,676
He is Supavitar

820
01:41:22,686 --> 01:41:23,846
Come in, Mr. Dharamdas

821
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:27,254
I'll come again

822
01:42:35,009 --> 01:42:47,708
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

823
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:58,139
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

824
01:42:59,384 --> 01:43:04,646
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

825
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:10,052
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

826
01:43:10,921 --> 01:43:15,876
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

827
01:43:16,221 --> 01:43:21,020
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

828
01:43:21,557 --> 01:43:27,582
"My dreams remain unfulfilled..."

829
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:32,120
"as the fire spreads in my life"

830
01:43:32,861 --> 01:43:38,022
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

831
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:43,193
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

832
01:43:55,101 --> 01:44:00,126
"O beloved, my sweet love"

833
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:05,631
"You have entered my very soul"

834
01:44:05,971 --> 01:44:11,064
"My eyes plead with you..."

835
01:44:11,473 --> 01:44:17,465
"but you do not hear my cry of pain"

836
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:22,570
"Although the rain fell,
my heart remained parched"

837
01:44:22,676 --> 01:44:28,008
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

838
01:44:28,411 --> 01:44:33,243
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

839
01:44:44,683 --> 01:44:49,913
"We could have talked,
we could have listened"

840
01:44:50,318 --> 01:44:55,378
"Why did you leave me with a broken heart?"

841
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,855
"My life is plunged into darkness"

842
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:06,915
"The light of hope is extinguished"

843
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:12,189
"My life is cloaked in darkness"

844
01:45:12,858 --> 01:45:17,588
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

845
01:45:17,993 --> 01:45:22,586
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

846
01:45:34,132 --> 01:45:39,499
"Wherever you are, my love..."

847
01:45:39,835 --> 01:45:44,858
"you will always be near me"

848
01:45:45,302 --> 01:45:50,100
"How can I live without you?"

849
01:45:50,504 --> 01:45:56,335
"How can I love again?"

850
01:45:56,738 --> 01:46:01,173
"There has never been another for me"

851
01:46:01,507 --> 01:46:06,737
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

852
01:46:07,142 --> 01:46:11,769
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

853
01:46:12,444 --> 01:46:18,174
"My dreams remain unfulfilled..."

854
01:46:18,545 --> 01:46:22,741
"as the fire spreads in my life"

855
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:28,444
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

856
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:33,839
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

857
01:46:34,451 --> 01:46:39,316
"My unspoken words lie sealed in my heart"

858
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:44,652
"l was so confused, I could not utter a word"

859
01:46:54,024 --> 01:47:07,416
Bhoothnath? Come over here

860
01:47:08,228 --> 01:47:12,492
Chotti Bahu, are you unwell?

861
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:18,696
Why should I be?

862
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:25,526
These days, it's like spring again

863
01:47:31,369 --> 01:47:38,236
I have some money. May I leave
it with you? I have no strong-box

864
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:44,902
No? We'll give you a thousand

865
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:46,264
Fetch Bansi

866
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,698
No, you keep it.
How can I keep it safe?

867
01:47:51,108 --> 01:47:56,168
Silly fellow, your Chotti Bahu isn't dead

868
01:47:56,775 --> 01:48:03,268
Come nearer to me. Come closer

869
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:09,410
Are you afraid of me?

870
01:48:13,948 --> 01:48:17,677
I cannot do it.
Take this key...

871
01:48:19,084 --> 01:48:24,278
...and put your rupees in the safe

872
01:48:50,593 --> 01:48:53,424
Give me that glass

873
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:58,060
I ache all over

874
01:48:59,062 --> 01:49:01,688
Your troubles are caused by the wine

875
01:49:03,897 --> 01:49:06,024
You don't know

876
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:14,860
As soon as I drink, I feel alive again

877
01:49:18,636 --> 01:49:20,432
Give it to me

878
01:49:23,003 --> 01:49:25,095
You're addicted

879
01:49:27,204 --> 01:49:34,299
I'm not addicted, but...

880
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,670
But what?

881
01:49:39,041 --> 01:49:46,136
I am lost in intoxication with my husband

882
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:53,268
He wants me to drink, so I drink

883
01:49:58,648 --> 01:50:03,309
Do you know,
he stays at home every night now

884
01:50:05,716 --> 01:50:08,843
I am very happy

885
01:50:10,018 --> 01:50:14,145
Don't you see that I am putting on weight?

886
01:50:18,287 --> 01:50:21,152
Give me the glass

887
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:26,312
No, you can hardly move.
Don't drink any more

888
01:50:28,257 --> 01:50:34,590
Should I obey you,
rather than my husband?

889
01:50:35,693 --> 01:50:40,286
Give me the glass, I shall drink

890
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:47,127
Empty the glass then,
give peace to your soul

891
01:50:47,463 --> 01:50:51,760
Yes, who are you to interfere?

892
01:50:57,567 --> 01:50:58,999
Shame on you

893
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:00,589
Shame?

894
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:06,025
What's that to do with it?

895
01:51:08,937 --> 01:51:14,667
No other member of the
Chaudhary family has done...

896
01:51:15,572 --> 01:51:19,062
...what Chotte Babu has done for me

897
01:51:19,707 --> 01:51:21,764
Now he is mine alone

898
01:51:24,775 --> 01:51:28,333
I am not ashamed. I am proud

899
01:51:30,944 --> 01:51:33,410
Will you drink more?
- What if I do?

900
01:51:33,844 --> 01:51:36,003
No, you shall not

901
01:51:36,478 --> 01:51:39,104
Have you any command over me?

902
01:51:39,412 --> 01:51:44,005
Yes, you may drink before
Chotte Babu, but not before me

903
01:51:51,349 --> 01:51:56,306
You dare to touch me?
The wife of another?

904
01:51:56,885 --> 01:51:59,545
Go away!

905
01:52:33,096 --> 01:52:37,394
You're learning the overseer's work quickly

906
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:39,964
Do you study at home?

907
01:52:40,633 --> 01:52:45,895
I've been learning from
M r. Banerji at night

908
01:52:46,766 --> 01:52:48,063
Every night?

909
01:52:49,734 --> 01:52:54,566
So you've been too busy to call
at Mr. Suvinay's house?

910
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:58,563
Go there today; he is seriously ill

911
01:53:11,809 --> 01:53:13,172
How is your father?

912
01:53:14,276 --> 01:53:18,333
Is Supavitar asleep? Wake him

913
01:53:18,843 --> 01:53:19,935
He must be exhausted

914
01:53:21,277 --> 01:53:24,074
Tell him to go home

915
01:53:24,745 --> 01:53:29,304
How can he go?
Your father is seriously ill

916
01:53:30,247 --> 01:53:34,011
Supavitar has responsibilities as
his future son-in-law

917
01:53:34,382 --> 01:53:37,679
No, he has no responsibilities towards me

918
01:53:41,317 --> 01:53:44,647
Even if he doesn't want to go, he has to

919
01:53:51,421 --> 01:53:52,408
How is father?

920
01:53:53,822 --> 01:53:55,617
Why didn't you wake me?

921
01:53:57,623 --> 01:53:58,953
Go home, Supavitar

922
01:54:02,224 --> 01:54:04,747
Go home? Why?

923
01:54:05,692 --> 01:54:09,886
Never return. Try to forget me, if you can

924
01:54:10,226 --> 01:54:11,454
What are you saying?

925
01:54:12,326 --> 01:54:14,953
Do as I say. Go

926
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,266
Bhoothnath, come into the other room

927
01:54:39,535 --> 01:54:40,899
Father has died

928
01:55:03,076 --> 01:55:04,042
There's talk...

929
01:55:04,377 --> 01:55:12,210
...that they're going to buy a motor-car

930
01:55:12,579 --> 01:55:13,807
We will lose our jobs

931
01:55:14,146 --> 01:55:17,205
When was my job ever safe?

932
01:55:17,548 --> 01:55:20,673
They'll give up smoking hookahs...

933
01:55:21,016 --> 01:55:24,779
...and smoke foreign cigarettes instead

934
01:55:27,117 --> 01:55:29,448
They plan to sell the land and buy coal mines

935
01:55:29,784 --> 01:55:33,116
How stupid! Who incited them?

936
01:55:39,321 --> 01:55:45,052
Sethji, I have persuaded my masters
to buy your mines

937
01:55:46,124 --> 01:55:49,146
And you give me only 50,000 rupees

938
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:52,988
Very well, take 1 0,000 more

939
01:55:54,559 --> 01:55:57,287
Mr. Robertson, a cheque for 20,000

940
01:56:07,063 --> 01:56:08,655
Have you made the necessary enquiries?

941
01:56:10,898 --> 01:56:15,957
M r. Robertson, mining expert,
says the mines are excellent

942
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:20,295
The mine is very good

943
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:22,862
Chotte Babu, read this agreement

944
01:56:26,036 --> 01:56:27,434
Where do I sign?

945
01:56:33,338 --> 01:56:36,793
Where is the elder brother?
His signature...

946
01:56:37,172 --> 01:56:38,365
It will be done

947
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:51,605
Cheni Dutt's pigeons have flown

948
01:57:10,817 --> 01:57:12,407
Cheni Dutt has lost

949
01:57:14,351 --> 01:57:20,013
The Chaudhary's do not dare
to challenge me

950
01:57:21,053 --> 01:57:22,247
Release my pigeons

951
01:57:29,855 --> 01:57:34,222
Sir, these are his pigeons

952
01:57:49,861 --> 01:57:52,487
Let's showthese Chaudharys

953
01:58:23,972 --> 01:58:26,530
We've beaten them, Master

954
01:58:27,606 --> 01:58:31,563
Master, the coal mines
agreement for signature

955
01:59:12,987 --> 01:59:16,352
Our valiant pigeons have brought
four rival pigeons home

956
01:59:20,489 --> 01:59:26,118
Take a 1,000 to the Chaudharys.
Ask them to return my pigeons

957
01:59:31,792 --> 01:59:32,952
Did you call me?

958
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:41,425
I need a reliable man
to supervise my work in Munghair

959
01:59:42,097 --> 01:59:45,962
If you go there I'll have no worries

960
01:59:46,932 --> 01:59:47,863
When do I leave?

961
01:59:48,132 --> 01:59:51,361
Tonight. You'll have to stay many months

962
01:59:51,966 --> 01:59:55,127
Go and collect money for your expenses

963
02:00:15,173 --> 02:00:20,698
Eat something. How much
longer will you torment yourself?

964
02:00:21,476 --> 02:00:25,274
Not only yourself, but Supavitar, too

965
02:00:28,045 --> 02:00:30,375
Supavitar?
- Yes

966
02:00:31,045 --> 02:00:35,411
He met me outside. Why did you
stop him coming here?

967
02:00:36,748 --> 02:00:39,112
How can I let him?

968
02:00:41,249 --> 02:00:45,205
Why not? Your father
arranged your marriage

969
02:00:46,015 --> 02:00:50,382
What is the hindrance?
You are both Brahmo Samaji

970
02:00:51,152 --> 02:00:56,211
Yes, but how can I break other ties?

971
02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:01,781
Ties that go back generations.
How can l?

972
02:01:03,155 --> 02:01:07,089
Jabba, please speak plainly

973
02:01:08,723 --> 02:01:13,487
You remember the day when father died

974
02:01:13,792 --> 02:01:15,884
You two were in the other room

975
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:23,756
Something happened on that day.
It seems like a dream

976
02:01:24,662 --> 02:01:26,525
It changed me completely

977
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:28,753
What do you mean?

978
02:01:29,697 --> 02:01:34,892
Father told me that day

979
02:01:35,932 --> 02:01:40,457
When I was one year old
my grandfather took me away...

980
02:01:41,067 --> 02:01:44,501
...and in accordance with
Sanata family rites...

981
02:01:46,368 --> 02:01:48,063
... he had me married

982
02:01:49,035 --> 02:01:50,161
Married!

983
02:01:54,571 --> 02:01:58,732
Yes, when I was 1 year old

984
02:02:08,510 --> 02:02:11,204
What is happening now, Yasin?

985
02:02:11,610 --> 02:02:16,601
Chotte Babu's going out again
- Yes!

986
02:02:17,678 --> 02:02:23,737
Long live Chotte Babu.
May the round of pleasure go on!

987
02:02:34,483 --> 02:02:35,540
The carriage is ready

988
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,176
Will you go out again?

989
02:02:45,155 --> 02:02:49,417
I've been at home so long that I'm stifling

990
02:02:50,756 --> 02:02:53,552
Let me have a change of air

991
02:02:54,756 --> 02:03:01,419
You've stayed so many days.
Did you get comfort from me?

992
02:03:04,093 --> 02:03:07,754
A wife can give comfort,
but it's not the same thing

993
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:39,799
"lf you will not stay, what will become of me?"

994
02:03:42,805 --> 02:03:49,606
"Beloved, do not leave
the gentle embrace of my arms"

995
02:03:49,606 --> 02:03:54,939
"My eyes will fill with tears"

996
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:21,716
"This cascade of hair,
these kohl-darkened eyes..."

997
02:04:22,018 --> 02:04:26,007
"this glittering veil, the desire in my heart"

998
02:04:29,553 --> 02:04:33,453
"This cascade of hair,
these kohl-darkened eyes..."

999
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:38,451
"this glittering veil, the desire in my heart"

1000
02:04:39,757 --> 02:04:44,891
"All this is for you alone"

1001
02:04:44,891 --> 02:04:52,827
"Today I shall not let you go"

1002
02:04:52,827 --> 02:04:58,196
" Beloved, do not leave
the gentle embrace of my arms"

1003
02:04:58,196 --> 02:05:06,029
"My eyes will fill with tears"

1004
02:05:17,534 --> 02:05:23,696
"l am devoted to you, I thirst for you"

1005
02:05:23,903 --> 02:05:28,859
"You are my love, the light of my life"

1006
02:05:33,574 --> 02:05:38,736
"l am devoted to you, I thirst for you"

1007
02:05:39,342 --> 02:05:43,934
"You are my love, the light of my life"

1008
02:05:44,243 --> 02:05:49,701
"l shall take the dust
from beneath your feet..."

1009
02:05:50,012 --> 02:05:56,537
"and powder my brow with it,
now and for ever"

1010
02:05:57,447 --> 02:06:01,575
"Beloved, do not leave
the gentle embrace of my arms"

1011
02:06:02,316 --> 02:06:10,445
"My eyes will fill with tears"

1012
02:06:30,424 --> 02:06:34,983
"You who elude me..."

1013
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:40,259
"l implore you to heed me"

1014
02:06:42,725 --> 02:06:46,902
"You who elude me..."

1015
02:06:47,612 --> 02:06:52,667
"I implore you to heed me"

1016
02:06:58,011 --> 02:07:02,546
"I am all yours,
I am at your feet"

1017
02:07:03,142 --> 02:07:07,748
"Here shall I live,
here shall I die"

1018
02:07:14,378 --> 02:07:17,128
What surprising about that?

1019
02:07:17,868 --> 02:07:24,212
It is every wife's duty to live
and die in her husband's house

1020
02:07:25,127 --> 02:07:27,209
Then do something

1021
02:07:28,968 --> 02:07:31,403
Just forget I am your wife

1022
02:07:33,572 --> 02:07:34,930
What?

1023
02:07:37,374 --> 02:07:44,173
Keep me like those women
in Badan Bari

1024
02:07:46,067 --> 02:07:48,504
I shall live there happily

1025
02:07:51,232 --> 02:07:53,739
At least I'll be able to see you

1026
02:07:55,768 --> 02:07:58,552
They change their names,
don't they?

1027
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,244
If you like, give me a new name,
any name you like

1028
02:08:04,843 --> 02:08:06,924
Are you in your right mind?

1029
02:08:07,425 --> 02:08:10,770
If you did that, our family
would be dishonoured

1030
02:08:13,356 --> 02:08:16,488
Then what should I do?

1031
02:08:17,057 --> 02:08:20,088
Do what the elder
sister-in-law does

1032
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:25,491
Refurbish old ornaments,
play kauris, sleep with ease

1033
02:08:35,934 --> 02:08:37,470
You laugh?

1034
02:08:42,185 --> 02:08:45,669
You are comparing me
with them?

1035
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:48,812
Refurbish old ornaments?

1036
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,972
Play kauris?

1037
02:08:59,285 --> 02:09:01,723
Where are you going?
Answer me

1038
02:09:03,055 --> 02:09:07,096
Do you think I'm like
the other daughters-in-law?

1039
02:09:07,691 --> 02:09:10,729
Aren't you? Have you descended
from heaven?

1040
02:09:11,288 --> 02:09:18,047
If I am not different, why am I
fated to this torment?

1041
02:09:20,154 --> 02:09:26,424
Has any other wife made
such a great sacrifice?

1042
02:09:27,725 --> 02:09:31,666
Being good Hindu women,
have they drunk wine?

1043
02:09:38,368 --> 02:09:41,499
Why so silent? Speak

1044
02:09:43,186 --> 02:09:45,272
Answer me

1045
02:09:48,106 --> 02:09:51,560
How could you compare me
to the others?

1046
02:09:52,295 --> 02:09:55,676
Do I have what they have?

1047
02:09:56,726 --> 02:09:59,164
What have you given me?

1048
02:10:01,963 --> 02:10:05,376
I have no one to call me mother

1049
02:10:07,721 --> 02:10:10,752
What do you want to say?

1050
02:10:12,431 --> 02:10:16,604
I drink, but I don't
become mad, like you

1051
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:26,036
You say I'm mad?
Is that what you say?

1052
02:12:50,261 --> 02:12:54,436
Get the carriage.
Chotti Bahu is going out

1053
02:12:55,952 --> 02:13:00,418
She's going out? Really?

1054
02:13:25,554 --> 02:13:28,104
It's a disaster, Master

1055
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:31,240
Cheni Dutt and
Chotte Babu fought

1056
02:13:32,197 --> 02:13:35,023
Dare he do such a thing?

1057
02:13:50,893 --> 02:13:52,876
What's going on, Chotte Babu?

1058
02:13:53,435 --> 02:13:56,695
He's unconscious,
drenched in blood

1059
02:15:32,743 --> 02:15:34,815
You're back!

1060
02:15:35,836 --> 02:15:37,747
What has happened?

1061
02:15:38,307 --> 02:15:41,425
You haven't seen the worst.
Look there

1062
02:15:42,796 --> 02:15:45,294
Everything has been sold off

1063
02:15:47,387 --> 02:15:49,745
How is Chotti Bahu?

1064
02:15:50,583 --> 02:15:57,752
The day that Chotte Babu
come home wounded, she fell ill

1065
02:15:58,449 --> 02:16:01,919
They say that Chotte Babu
is paralysed

1066
02:16:02,617 --> 02:16:05,739
Now he has stopped drinking

1067
02:16:06,167 --> 02:16:11,587
But what about Chotti Bahu?
- Better not ask

1068
02:16:13,055 --> 02:16:16,565
Look at the mansion

1069
02:16:17,159 --> 02:16:20,278
I haven't been paid
for seven months

1070
02:16:20,917 --> 02:16:22,990
How did it all happen?

1071
02:16:23,453 --> 02:16:27,095
The coal mines
ruined everything

1072
02:16:27,664 --> 02:16:30,263
My masters
did not check properly

1073
02:16:30,831 --> 02:16:35,313
They were cheated.
There's no coal, only rock

1074
02:16:36,222 --> 02:16:39,065
Just look at what is happening

1075
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:43,587
I want my money. 1500 rupees

1076
02:16:43,943 --> 02:16:46,719
My five thousand
- My three thousand

1077
02:16:49,194 --> 02:16:55,100
Just wait a few more days;
the money is on the way

1078
02:17:30,692 --> 02:17:33,328
When did you return?
- Today

1079
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:39,242
Good. Do something for me.
Bring some wine

1080
02:17:39,946 --> 02:17:42,303
Haven't you given it up?

1081
02:17:42,795 --> 02:17:46,129
I shall, from tomorrow

1082
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:51,836
Take this

1083
02:17:57,751 --> 02:18:00,815
I have nothing else left

1084
02:18:01,788 --> 02:18:05,680
And you want me to sell it
to buy such stuff?

1085
02:18:07,214 --> 02:18:11,936
You think you will give it up
tomorrow, but you never will

1086
02:18:15,842 --> 02:18:17,858
Look at the mansion

1087
02:18:18,309 --> 02:18:23,979
Chotte Babu is ill and you
won't come to your senses

1088
02:18:26,138 --> 02:18:29,090
You speak to me in this way?

1089
02:18:29,718 --> 02:18:35,448
Drinking has robbed you
of house, family and husband

1090
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:40,048
Who are you to lecture me?

1091
02:18:40,815 --> 02:18:45,261
If I don't serve my husband,
then who does?

1092
02:18:45,788 --> 02:18:50,475
For his sake,
I've sacrificed everything

1093
02:18:51,042 --> 02:18:55,691
I have even sacrificed my God

1094
02:18:56,748 --> 02:19:00,908
You say it is my fault?

1095
02:19:01,614 --> 02:19:06,136
How can you say such a thing?

1096
02:19:08,992 --> 02:19:11,763
Who is there?

1097
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:20,953
Who was he?
- Teacher's brother-in-law

1098
02:19:29,305 --> 02:19:31,521
Do you want to speak?

1099
02:19:36,330 --> 02:19:39,451
Do you want to see me happy?

1100
02:19:40,679 --> 02:19:42,753
Yes, completely

1101
02:19:45,724 --> 02:19:49,887
Then stop drinking wine,
Chotti Bahu

1102
02:19:53,025 --> 02:19:55,104
Leave it

1103
02:19:58,312 --> 02:20:02,063
Drinking has
a devastating effect

1104
02:20:07,637 --> 02:20:11,978
What can I do? I can't stop

1105
02:20:16,053 --> 02:20:24,260
A man can stop drinking,
but a woman...

1106
02:20:26,353 --> 02:20:33,337
I am not like other women,
I'm not

1107
02:20:34,106 --> 02:20:36,779
I can do everything for you

1108
02:20:38,004 --> 02:20:43,697
I began drinking for you,
I can stop drinking for you

1109
02:20:52,435 --> 02:20:57,063
You'll see. From tomorrow
I'll not touch another drop

1110
02:20:57,654 --> 02:21:01,129
You won't drink?
- Not at all

1111
02:21:06,003 --> 02:21:10,167
I won't drink even a little drop

1112
02:21:25,483 --> 02:21:31,318
I returned a while ago; I came
to see you as soon as I could

1113
02:21:32,229 --> 02:21:35,491
I've thought of you very much

1114
02:21:37,412 --> 02:21:38,442
Really?

1115
02:21:38,734 --> 02:21:42,448
You're from Nadia District?
I was married there

1116
02:21:42,873 --> 02:21:48,021
If the family wanted to accept
you, why have they kept silent?

1117
02:21:49,065 --> 02:21:51,082
Who can tell why?

1118
02:21:51,570 --> 02:21:55,492
My father
took the secret with him

1119
02:21:56,129 --> 02:21:59,565
Your husband
may have remarried

1120
02:22:00,649 --> 02:22:02,524
I'm still his wife

1121
02:22:02,701 --> 02:22:05,545
Maybe he is bad
and won't make you happy

1122
02:22:06,873 --> 02:22:11,035
That is my misfortune.
- He may think you are bad

1123
02:22:11,955 --> 02:22:14,384
Will he accept you?

1124
02:22:15,502 --> 02:22:17,934
That's what I want to know

1125
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:21,574
Why do you stop me
from finding out?

1126
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:34,552
Jabba, I want to help you.
I'll do whatever you want

1127
02:22:36,647 --> 02:22:39,153
Get me his address

1128
02:22:41,518 --> 02:22:44,995
I found a letter
in father's papers

1129
02:22:46,041 --> 02:22:50,489
Grandmother wrote secretly
without telling my grandfather

1130
02:22:51,258 --> 02:22:53,691
She named my husband

1131
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:08,464
Atulya Chakravarty?

1132
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:17,512
Why look at me like that?
Do you know him?

1133
02:23:20,896 --> 02:23:21,926
Perhaps

1134
02:23:23,364 --> 02:23:27,078
I'll make enquiries
about the marriage

1135
02:23:46,249 --> 02:23:50,321
Master, there has been
no work for us lately

1136
02:23:50,842 --> 02:23:54,840
Master, our weapons are rusting

1137
02:24:26,217 --> 02:24:29,622
Hurry, you must go
to the city with Chotti Bahu

1138
02:24:31,366 --> 02:24:32,953
The city? At this hour?

1139
02:24:33,381 --> 02:24:38,589
To see a great saint.
I have hired a carriage

1140
02:24:39,022 --> 02:24:45,211
We've waited for you
since this morning

1141
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:58,000
Don't worry. I won't be long

1142
02:24:59,469 --> 02:25:04,026
I've heard that the saint
of Barey Nagar is a true saint

1143
02:25:05,138 --> 02:25:08,202
He will certainly cure you

1144
02:25:19,714 --> 02:25:24,861
I'll be back soon

1145
02:25:37,251 --> 02:25:39,322
Did you call me?

1146
02:25:45,490 --> 02:25:48,444
I'll be back very soon

1147
02:26:00,275 --> 02:26:02,773
Let's hurry, Bhoothnath

1148
02:26:08,485 --> 02:26:11,815
Tell the driver to drive fast

1149
02:26:33,734 --> 02:26:37,210
Who went there?
- Teacher's brother-in-law

1150
02:27:04,553 --> 02:27:06,630
How is Chhote Babu?

1151
02:27:08,937 --> 02:27:13,314
I worry about him ceaselessly

1152
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:19,158
His condition is worsening

1153
02:27:23,755 --> 02:27:28,902
May God give him my life

1154
02:27:30,954 --> 02:27:32,726
My life...

1155
02:27:36,622 --> 02:27:42,455
When I die, make sure
that I am adorned in splendour

1156
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:46,667
Did you hear?
Adorned in splendour

1157
02:27:49,427 --> 02:27:55,889
Adorn my brow with Sindoor
the bridal vermilion...

1158
02:27:58,223 --> 02:28:00,895
so everyone will know...

1159
02:28:02,642 --> 02:28:05,241
...I was a devoted wife

1160
02:28:06,852 --> 02:28:08,925
Don't talk like this

1161
02:28:13,598 --> 02:28:19,091
In this
lies the peace of my soul

1162
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:25,944
May God bless him
with my lifespan

1163
02:28:42,331 --> 02:28:45,032
No one else understood me...

1164
02:28:46,507 --> 02:28:48,830
besides you

1165
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:58,574
Tell me... why don't you marry?

1166
02:29:00,383 --> 02:29:01,769
Marry?

1167
02:29:06,297 --> 02:29:12,095
How I longed
for a happy family life

1168
02:29:14,576 --> 02:29:21,181
How happy I would be
to welcome a daughter-in-law

1169
02:29:23,344 --> 02:29:27,857
Bring a wife to me;
I shall adorn her

1170
02:29:29,810 --> 02:29:32,205
I am married

1171
02:29:33,704 --> 02:29:35,439
When?

1172
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:21,630
What has happened?

1173
02:30:22,684 --> 02:30:24,756
What about Chhoti Bahu?

1174
02:30:25,812 --> 02:30:31,016
There is no trace of her. The
day you left in the carriage...

1175
02:30:32,074 --> 02:30:35,192
I was turned out
of the mansion

1176
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:38,501
Now I am working as a coolie

1177
02:30:38,961 --> 02:30:44,595
Don't the servants know
where Chhoti Bahu is?

1178
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:47,231
I asked everyone

1179
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:51,816
There is no trace
of Chotti Bahu

1180
02:30:53,989 --> 02:30:57,046
The mansion is now a ruin

1181
02:30:59,137 --> 02:31:02,395
The master is living
with his in-laws

1182
02:31:04,005 --> 02:31:08,519
And is Chotte Babu
still in the mansion?

1183
02:31:12,074 --> 02:31:16,178
Chotte Babu has passed away

1184
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:46,366
Overseer, we have found a grave

1185
02:31:49,362 --> 02:31:51,580
A grave, in this mansion?

1186
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:27,331
Chotti Bahu

1187
02:32:37,953 --> 02:32:41,323
Make sure that I am adorned
in splendour

1188
02:32:52,285 --> 02:32:55,170
Adorn my brow with Sindoor,
the bridal vermilion

1189
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:03,656
So everyone will know
I was a devoted wife

1190
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,072
A devoted wife
