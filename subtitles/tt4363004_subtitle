00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,933
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,400
{\an8}1225 - KAYI TRIBE

3
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,600
-Great God!
-Only one God!

4
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,100
-Great God!
-Only one God!

5
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,066
-Great God!
-Only one God!

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,366
-Great God!
-Only one God!

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,466
Even the iron could not stand
reciting of God and gave in.

8
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:33,933
Wait a bit!

9
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,400
Take a look at this one.

10
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:59,500
This is magnificent. I pity the enemy whom
this will be the Azrael of.

11
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,566
In the hands of a valiant like you...

12
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,566
...let it be the sound of the oppressed,
wrath to the tyrants, if God permits.

13
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,400
There’s no sword other than Zulfiqar and
no valiant other than His Holiness Ali.

14
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,800
I’m ready to sacrifice myself for God,
who gave you to us.

15
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,333
For the love of God, in the name of my
forefather Oguz, I’ll gird it with honor.

16
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,900
Bring your hands.

17
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,566
What is the matter?
Your tumblers are restless again.

18
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,066
We are going hunting.

19
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,000
They are getting ready.

20
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,900
Are there any animals left to hunt
in this famine?

21
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,433
You are right but...

22
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,533
...hunting keeps the Alps fit.

23
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,366
It is better if we find a way to keep
the tribe alive as well.

24
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,033
That can only be decided
on the headquarters tomorrow.

25
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:24,033
If we don’t migrate from this highland
before winter, we would be doomed.

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But if you say that you know a solution,
tell us as well.

27
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,566
My brother Gundogdu knows
these matters better than me.

28
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,200
If you wish, talk to him.

29
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,533
With Gundogdu?

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,933
No, he never breaths a single word about.

31
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,100
Is this what you bought for 40 coins?

32
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,300
This is called a map.

33
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,033
What is it used for?

34
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,133
Look, we are here.

35
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,600
Right at where these mountains are.

36
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,366
This is Aleppo. This is Baghdad.

37
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,066
And this is Damascus.

38
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,900
And this is Konya,
where the Sultan’s palace is.

39
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,933
Let go of the palaces
of the sultans and khans and...

40
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,933
...tell us where the tribe should
migrate to, Gundogdu.

41
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,033
The elders are having a dumb moment.
Your father is quiet.

42
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,566
He just sits in his tent like
a worrier not a warrior.

43
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,366
Where is this place?

44
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,133
Everyone will learn tomorrow
at headquarters.

45
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,300
You found a place, right?

46
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,400
Please tell me, where is it?

47
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,033
Ertugrul!

48
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,133
Ertugrul!

49
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,166
Where are you going?

50
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,133
I am going hunting, brother.

51
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,166
This is not the time to go hunting.
We have headquarters tomorrow.

52
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,833
The headquarter is yours
and hunt is mine, brother.

53
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:20,966
Alright. But don’t go too far.
Go quickly, come back quickly.

54
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you doing with that meat?
We are going hunting, did you forget?

55
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,000
We won’t let you starve during a hunt,
don’t you worry.

56
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,600
How can you call a valiant as valiant if
he starves while he is hunting, Turgut?

57
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:53,366
-This is just for the road.
-It is impossible to relieve your hunger.

58
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,866
Come on, Alps.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,933
Your man is going.

60
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:40,166
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

61
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,833
Guard duty is your pride!

62
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,033
Guard duty is your honor!

63
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,400
If you betray your pride and honor...

64
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
...your death will not come
from the enemy, but from me!

65
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,033
You have honored us, Ustad-i Azam.

66
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,066
That honor belongs to us.

67
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,166
-Elanora.
-Commander Titus.

68
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,433
I hope your journey was fine.

69
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,333
Is everything alright, Titus?

70
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,866
We are safer than ever, sir.

71
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,566
Your chambers are ready, sir.
Would you like to rest before lunch?

72
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,033
Elanora may rest. We have work to do.

73
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,566
-As you wish.
-With your permission.

74
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,366
What is the latest development
about the prisoners?

75
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,900
I gave that duty to my brother Bisol.

76
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,533
They will submit Numan and his family
to Karatoygar.

77
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,933
For the others, I waited for you.

78
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,400
Good.

79
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Where are they taking us, father?

80
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,233
To our palace, son.

81
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,300
We will be free there, right?

82
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,600
Until eternity, son.

83
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,466
Until eternity.

84
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,300
So out fate was to return to Konya
like this.

85
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:05,033
To the palace we were born in and
grew up, to be killed by our uncle.

86
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,833
I will not let anything to happen
to you or your brother, my daughter.

87
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,966
This way Karatoygar will be
dependent on us more than ever.

88
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,800
It is very important for him to win
the favor of Sultan Aladdin.

89
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,500
Karatoygar becoming a high officer
in the Seljuk court will relieve us.

90
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,233
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN

91
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,433
{\an8}-We did everything as you ordered, sir.
-Okay!

92
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,200
Head of guard!

93
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,800
Are the Turkmen tribes paying
their taxes?

94
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,166
We can’t control them, sir.
They are always on the move.

95
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,166
-Which one is the biggest tribe?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

96
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,566
They ran away from the Mongol invasion.

97
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,933
-Who is their leader?
-Suleyman Shah.

98
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,566
-How many tents?
-2000 tents. But they are well respected.

99
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,166
-Do they pay their taxes?
-They do, sir.

100
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,433
Good.

101
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:21,366
Then, they shall pay their taxes
earlier this year.

102
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,233
-But, sir...
-You heard what I said.

103
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,866
How will this state remain standing?

104
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Inform all the tribes
in the region immediately.

105
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,900
Yes, sir.

106
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,266
Where are those templars?

107
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,833
Halt!

108
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,033
Let us rest a bit here.

109
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,966
Check the surroundings.

110
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:07,300
We need to weaken the Seljuks
before the crusade.

111
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:12,133
You should put more men
in the Seljuk court, Titus.

112
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,233
Please be rest assured that
we will possess the whole court.

113
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:24,400
There is a group in the Papacy,
who are reluctant about the crusade.

114
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,966
I am not surprised.

115
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,166
We need to make a plan that will mobilize
the whole Europe.

116
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,000
We need to do this.

117
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,400
The Christian world should unite
and act for Jerusalem.

118
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:43,133
For this, we need to provoke
the Muslims and make them attack us.

119
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,466
I have some very valuable prisoners.

120
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,200
We can start with them.

121
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,000
Calm down, son.

122
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,266
Yigit.

123
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,000
Commoner...

124
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,966
...you can go to hell.

125
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,800
-Take us to our destination quickly.
-So you are very keen to die.

126
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,533
I pity for your beautiful daughter
and your small Shahzade.

127
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,366
Don’t shed a tear for us.

128
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,800
If you had accepted to be allies with us,
you were to become the Seljuk sultan...

129
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,533
...and everything was going to be fine.
-You offered slavery for the Pope.

130
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,933
We offered you peace...

131
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,366
...and a new world order.

132
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,000
We wanted to live side by side.

133
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,333
But...

134
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,133
...the Muslim blood will always be shed.

135
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,433
There is no escape from this.

136
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:45,966
And we will shed your blood with
the Muslim allies we have.

137
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,100
You will not succeed.

138
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,166
We will see.

139
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,233
In the mean time...

140
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,600
...to all your men I had sent to hell...

141
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,166
...give them my regards.

142
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,433
-The area is safe, sir.
-Good.

143
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,333
Water the horses.

144
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:04,900
These too.

145
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
-Come on!
-Yeah!

146
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:17,933
Come on!

147
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,233
You two, go and sit somewhere else.

148
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,500
I brought you water. Take it.

149
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:55,866
Take it.

150
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,600
Come on.

151
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,966
They are not aware.

152
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,566
Key! Take the key.

153
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,566
Come on, my girl.

154
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,000
We are in luck.

155
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,800
The prisoners are running away!

156
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,966
-Quick, run!
-Get them!

157
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,066
-Father!
-Father!

158
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,533
-Are you alright?
-Father!

159
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,133
Quick, take your brother
and get out of here.

160
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,433
No!

161
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,000
-Father!
-Father!

162
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:21,366
-Quick! Run away!
-No, we cannot leave you in this state.

163
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,100
Take your brother and
get the hell out of here!

164
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,200
Come on, father! Get up! Come on!

165
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,400
So you tried to run away!
You will pay for this.

166
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,166
Father!

167
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,900
Father!

168
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:14,333
Have some decency! Dear God!
Have some decency!

169
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,000
Great God!

170
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,566
-Father!
-Father!

171
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:58,233
Father, stay with us, please!

172
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,266
Your first victim was a crusader.

173
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,600
-Stay with us.
-Be strong, father.

174
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,966
-Quick, bring some oak leaves.
-Okay.

175
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:19,100
If we are successful, all the borders
in the region will change.

176
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:25,533
We should not refrain from using
our order’s wealth to save Jerusalem.

177
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,166
We are ready to spend the whole treasury.

178
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:35,966
For young men, a new Jerusalem campaign
would be the shortest road to riches.

179
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,933
They will be enlisting by the thousands
to be a member of the crusade army.

180
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:47,900
The Catalans, the Venetians,
the Marseilleans...

181
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:51,966
...they will be pining for this carnival.

182
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,900
Well...

183
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,066
...what about the spoilt princes of
Europe, how will we trust them?

184
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,866
When the Muslims start to fight
with each other...

185
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:08,433
...our job will not be difficult, Titus.

186
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,400
What about the Seljuks, sir?

187
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,400
Anatolia.

188
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,500
They are on the peak of their power
with Sultan Aladdin.

189
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:24,000
When we make the Turks and the grandsons
of Saladin Ayyubi fall out on...

190
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:27,200
...each other we will reach our goal.

191
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:35,266
Jerusalem will be ours.

192
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,500
Father, please be strong.

193
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,800
We have to go immediately.

194
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,066
You can go.

195
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,566
We can look after ourselves.

196
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
It will get dark soon.

197
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,033
The jackals would have
already smelled the blood.

198
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:37,600
-We should go.
-Dogan, bring the horses.

199
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,966
It is easy to fend off a crusader brigade.
What about this?

200
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,400
Ertugrul is lost now.

201
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:53,366
-God always helps those who get lost.
-He is lost real bad now.

202
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,866
Come on.

203
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,600
-What can you do alone as a woman?
-I said we won’t go.

204
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:07,566
We owe you a life.
We will pay our debt one day.

205
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,833
Tell us your name.

206
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,800
Ertugrul from Kayi tribe.

207
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:14,966
As you wish.

208
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,100
May God be with you. I wish you good luck.

209
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,066
We should go with them.

210
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,333
Is your tribe far?

211
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:09,366
Even our money for bad days is finished,
Brother Afsin.

212
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:13,933
We can set shop here. If we see that
they are not interested, we can go on.

213
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,500
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. Welcome.

214
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,500
Welcome, Gazanfar Aga.

215
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,866
You bring joy to Kayi tribe.

216
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:48,100
Kurdoglu, my brother. You always
look very healthy, thanks to God.

217
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,033
Would these moorlands keep a man healthy,
for us to be healthy, Gazanfer?

218
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,533
No, don’t say that. You look very well.

219
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,133
Where is your caravan?

220
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,466
The caravan is near the black rock.

221
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,933
I came to get permission from Suleyman
Shah to set up a stall in the market.

222
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,533
How is business?

223
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,433
We thank God on what he gives.

224
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,333
I wanted to come to Kayi to supply
whatever they need before the journey.

225
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:14,900
Thank you, Gazanfer. I hope you meet
your expectations, if God permits.

226
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,100
Thank you.

227
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:19,366
If Suleyman Shah is available,
I would like to meet him.

228
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,100
Tell our Bey that Gazanfer Aga is here.

229
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:46,566
-How much is this?
-He is a mute, sir. Let me help you.

230
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,400
80 coins.

231
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:54,266
You look familiar to me.

232
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,900
This is my first time in your tribe, sir.

233
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,200
You probably took me for someone else.

234
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Peace be upon you, Suleyman Shah.

235
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,433
And peace be upon you, trader. Welcome.

236
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:26,333
You bring joy to us. Come and sit.

237
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:35,833
Suleyman Bey, my eyes are so happy that
they had the chance to see you again.

238
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,933
Please accept my presents. I brought them
from Constantinople for you.

239
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,933
You did not have to bother.

240
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:51,366
-Kurdoglu, give these to those in need.
-As you wish, Bey.

241
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,366
Well?

242
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,533
Tell us now. What did those eyes see in
other parts of the world?

243
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I wish I was deaf and not hear it.

244
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,500
I wish I was blind and not see it, Bey.

245
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,133
What happened?

246
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,233
Sultan Aladdin controlled Konya but...

247
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:12,500
...he worries that the fugitive Shahzades
may give him trouble.

248
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,933
The Latins ransacked Constantinople.

249
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,966
All Orthodox people left the city.

250
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,866
There is no order, no peace...

251
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,966
...and with the famine now,
everyone is desperate.

252
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,933
We heard that the leftovers from
the crusaders were getting restless.

253
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,266
It is obvious that they are up to
something once again.

254
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:30,800
Well...

255
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,966
...how are the common people?

256
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:36,400
They will be on the road again
to find something to eat.

257
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:41,000
The rumor is that the Pope is calling for
a new crusade to the European princes.

258
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:45,600
And we Muslims fight against each other.

259
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:50,000
Sowing discord between us,
fueling the disorder as much as possible.

260
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:54,266
From Anatolia to Basra,
everywhere is on fire.

261
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,366
This fire will hit us as well, Bey.

262
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,833
Please don’t say fire, it upsets me, Bey.

263
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:02,400
I came to seek for permission to sell
my goods in your tribe.

264
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:05,499
-You have our permission.
-Thank you.

265
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,800
Karatoygar has come to the region
to control the Turkmen tribes.

266
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,300
So difficult times await us.

267
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:32,966
And this girl is from Venetia.
Rosalina, she has noble blood.

268
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:36,833
A white skin, green eyes.
A rare find, commander.

269
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,366
And she is very cheap as well.
I am in urgent need of money.

270
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:43,366
This is a very good opportunity
for you and me.

271
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:49,966
What do you say to this, commander?

272
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,233
They kidnapped her from
the Greek Islands.

273
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:54,133
She screams beauty and freshness.

274
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,800
She is a wild one.

275
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:59,800
I personally trained her.
For a master with good taste.

276
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,833
What about that blond one?

277
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,100
I must say that you have good taste.

278
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:10,133
I bought her from the crusader discards.
They brought her in with a ship.

279
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,800
She is Serbian,
she knows how to treat a man.

280
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:13,966
Enough.

281
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,900
Come here.

282
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,400
You don’t need to be afraid of me.

283
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,000
I am your master now.

284
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:46,466
You chose the most expensive one,
commander. But she is worth it.

285
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,066
-Sir?
-What happened?

286
00:35:57,566 --> 00:36:00,500
The crusaders. They were ambushed.

287
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:04,833
Didn’t you save them?

288
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,366
We were too late.

289
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,400
So you were late.

290
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,866
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

291
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,933
-Come on, help them.
-Help them.

292
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:10,966
Akcakoca, we have a wounded man.

293
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,900
-Come on.
-Bamsi, take him in.

294
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,100
-What happened?
-Nothing to worry about.

295
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,366
-You are alright, yes?
-We all are, thank God.

296
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,600
Ertugrul...

297
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,600
...what happened, my brother?

298
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:54,200
They were attacked, brother.
I will tell you later.

299
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:09,266
-Look after them, Ramazan.
-As you wish, Bey.

300
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:16,166
Who are they, Gundogdu?

301
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:20,066
I don’t know. He will tell us later.
We will find out soon.

302
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:31,300
Sister, what is happening? Who are they?

303
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,900
We will find out soon. We will see.

304
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:43,366
The sword hit him right below the rib.
Fortunately the oak leaves stopped...

305
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,433
...the bleeding,
otherwise we would have lost him.

306
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:50,900
-Midwife, bring hot water.
-At once, Akcakoca.

307
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:58,133
The leg is bad as well.
But we should fix this wound first.

308
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:02,466
Akcakoca can take it from here.
Let us wait at the side.

309
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:06,333
-We cannot leave our father alone, sister.
-Don’t worry.

310
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,400
Your father is in good hands.

311
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,266
Thank you very much. You are God sent.

312
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,866
-We brought trouble to you.
-Don’t say that.

313
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:39,066
You had more breaths to take,
more bites to eat.

314
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,166
Where were the crusaders taking you?

315
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,566
I don’t know. They didn’t say.

316
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,933
I guess they were going to sell us in
the slave market. My father is a trader.

317
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,166
We were captured in the Mediterranean.

318
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:14,500
Your father must be a good trader.
Having so many crusaders taking you.

319
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,566
Yes.

320
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,300
We were rich.

321
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,866
But we don’t have anything left now.

322
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,133
Well...

323
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,133
...which tribe is this?

324
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,300
You are in Kayi tribe.

325
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:34,166
I am the son of
the tribe Bey, Suleyman Shah.

326
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,166
We owe you three lives.

327
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:48,000
-Do you want to be freed from slavery?
-Yes.

328
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:52,133
-Then, kill this man.
-No!

329
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,900
I will buy and then free you.

330
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:57,233
Commander, you are furious.
First calm down...

331
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:58,500
Shut your mouth.

332
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:00,800
Don’t let me kill you as well.

333
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:03,800
Sir, please spare me for my children.

334
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,500
You are good for nothing.

335
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,866
Do it!

336
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
-I can’t.
-I said do it!

337
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,166
I’m freeing you!

338
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:17,933
A slave that can kill someone
to be free...

339
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,400
...can kill her master one day as well.

340
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,966
Get ready, we are going!

341
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:27,391


342
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,266
Bey, dinner is ready. Come to the table.

343
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:08,770
Dundar, come on, come to the table, son.

344
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:11,370
I will come as soon as
I finish this, mother.

345
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:16,836
Always be like that, my boy.
Finish the job at hand first.

346
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,803
-Selcan?
-Yes, mother?

347
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,970
-Bring the molasses, my girl.
-Yes, mother.

348
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:22,303
Where is Gundogdu?

349
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:25,570
He went to check the shepherds,
he will come in a few minutes.

350
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:34,936
Put another plate on the table.
For Sungurtekin.

351
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:40,370
If he comes back one day, he should know
that his place is ready at the table.

352
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:45,370
Come on then. Why is Gundogdu late?

353
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:47,403
He will come, mother.

354
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:04,570
In the name of God.

355
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:20,470
Well, son? You returned with a big hunt.

356
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:23,070
Something like that, Bey.

357
00:44:23,236 --> 00:44:27,370
What kind of luck is this, brother?
You are like a lightning pulling tree.

358
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,303
You attract all kinds of trouble
to yourself.

359
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,770
The innocents were under attack.
We did what we could do.

360
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:43,370
Who are they? Where do they come from?

361
00:44:44,003 --> 00:44:47,370
They were captured by the crusaders.
The man is a trader.

362
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:50,470
The crusaders must be from
Antioch Countship.

363
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:55,103
Knights don’t freely transport captives
in the Seljuk territory.

364
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,770
Well?

365
00:44:56,936 --> 00:45:00,970
What I mean is, the Seljuks must
know about these prisoners.

366
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:03,570
There were no Seljuk soldiers with them.

367
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:07,770
Sooner or later, the kind of trouble
you called will be revealed, Ertugrul.

368
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,870
What should have I done, brother?
Turn my back and leave?

369
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,036
Both of you stop talking.
Host them in a way worthy of our tribe.

370
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:20,003
We will see what the future holds.

371
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:44,270
It is over, father. You are saved.
You will be healed.

372
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:51,770
-Do we have permission?
-Come in, Bey.

373
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,036
How is he?

374
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,803
It is up to God from now on.

375
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,470
With your permission.

376
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,970
Come in, Aykiz.

377
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:32,136
Aykiz.

378
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,436
Turgut’s sweetheart.

379
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,203
I wanted to ask whether
you need anything or not.

380
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,303
Thank you.

381
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:48,103
-We have been a big burden on you.
-Don’t say that.

382
00:46:49,103 --> 00:46:53,570
Bamsi Beyrek and Dogan are preparing their
tent for you, you can stay there tonight.

383
00:46:58,036 --> 00:46:59,303
I...

384
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:01,470
...should stay with my father.

385
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,370
Rest a bit tonight. You look very tired.

386
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,936
Your father will need you more
when he wakes up tomorrow.

387
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,236
Don’t worry, I will stay with your father.

388
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:38,170
Bey, how did you let the boil get so big?

389
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:43,170
We carry so many problems
on our backs, Hayme.

390
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,103
Will we be afraid of one this small?

391
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:51,270
If you had crushed its head when it was
small, it would have been long gone.

392
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,870
The jackals used to live in the mountains,
now they are inside our tribe.

393
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:59,003
They wait for my slightest
mistake to attack.

394
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,136
I hide it so that they don’t know
about my weakness.

395
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,136
It is better to bite your lip
and sit with pain...

396
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,036
...rather than giving them
something to talk about.

397
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:10,870
At least, you should have told Akcakoca.

398
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:15,070
I did, woman, I did.
He is preparing an ointment to cure me.

399
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,170
We will put in on at night,
if God permits.

400
00:48:23,836 --> 00:48:26,536
What happened?
Are you thinking about our guests?

401
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:31,203
I don’t know what kind of
a smoky candle this wick has lit.

402
00:51:30,536 --> 00:51:32,170
-Did you wear it?
-Yes.

403
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,903
-How is it?
-It is beautiful, Aykiz.

404
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:39,136
Let me see.

405
00:51:40,903 --> 00:51:44,903
Dear God. You look like a queen
from a palace, Halime.

406
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,336
You look so beautiful.

407
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:53,336
What happened? Did I say something wrong?

408
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,536
No. I just found it strange
for you to say that.

409
00:51:59,903 --> 00:52:02,070
Wait, let us put the head piece as well.

410
00:52:09,936 --> 00:52:11,570
Turgut Alp got this for me.

411
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:14,936
Dear God! Why did you give it to me then?

412
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,070
Because I knew that it would suit you.
Let me see?

413
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,303
I was right.

414
00:52:22,403 --> 00:52:23,970
When is your wedding?

415
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:28,003
After we migrate from this moorland,
if God permits.

416
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:33,270
Isn’t it very hard to be
the wife of an Alp?

417
00:52:34,236 --> 00:52:38,003
If his heart is beating for me,
who cares how hard it is?

418
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:41,336
The only thing I want is for him
to be back safe and sound.

419
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:43,570
As long as there is no death.

420
00:52:45,903 --> 00:52:48,903
-Shall we braid your hair, if you want?
-Alright.

421
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,770
Do you have a man in your life?

422
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,936
After my mother died, the only thing
that was in my life was being a mother...

423
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,070
...to my brother Yigit and
be a companion to my father.

424
00:53:07,136 --> 00:53:11,170
-Anyway, which man would want...
-Are you out of your mind?

425
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,936
Men would fight, they would turn
the world upside down for you.

426
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,070
When was the last time
you looked at yourself in a mirror?

427
00:53:21,503 --> 00:53:22,503
Wait.

428
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,403
Isn't he the brother of
the infidel called Titus?

429
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:59,303
Yes, sir. Bisol.

430
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,036
Send these bodies to the Templars.

431
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:04,903
We will be dealing with Titus as well now.

432
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:08,036
You! You! Come here!

433
00:54:10,036 --> 00:54:11,503
Load this one on a horse.

434
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,936
-Which tribe does this seal belong to?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

435
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:16,770
So they are Kayis.

436
00:54:20,203 --> 00:54:23,036
If they are with Suleyman Shah,
our job is very difficult.

437
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,803
Could that shepherd head
resist the Seljuk?

438
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,103
-May you have a good morning, Ertugrul.
-You too.

439
00:54:41,136 --> 00:54:42,570
I brought you some food.

440
00:54:44,936 --> 00:54:47,070
You did not need to bother, Gokce Baci.

441
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:53,003
-How is our wounded guest?
-Fine. He should be up in a few days.

442
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:57,970
If God permits. May God give him health
and hope he does not bring any trouble.

443
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,336
I will be back in a while and
we can go to the weaving area.

444
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,470
Alright, Aykiz.

445
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:14,136
Is my father better, Ertugrul Bey?

446
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,103
Yes, much better.

447
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:18,070
You will see when you go in.

448
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:21,903
His fever has gone down. We can take him
to your tent tonight, if God permits.

449
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,003
Did you see the girl?

450
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,403
She already has Ertugrul
eating from her hands.

451
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,036
You can only see him
in your dreams from now on.

452
00:55:52,503 --> 00:55:53,870
Did you sleep well?

453
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:58,036
It has been years since
I slept so peacefully.

454
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,436
In the forest you said Templars.

455
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:12,970
Yes.

456
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,503
Who are they?

457
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:25,170
An order that fights for Jerusalem.

458
00:56:26,403 --> 00:56:28,470
They are very strong and ruthless.

459
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,870
Their only aim is to take revenge
on Jerusalem.

460
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,936
If they are so strong,
what did they want from you?

461
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:43,170
-Is this the Seljuk territory?
-Yes.

462
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,170
Do you have an issue
with the Seljuks, Halime?

463
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:56,203
Not at all. What issue can
the great Seljuks have with us?

464
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:18,336
Towel.

465
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,036
-What is wrong with you, my girl?
-Nothing, father. I didn’t see it.

466
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:33,970
But you can still say
what you want to say, right?

467
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:39,236
A thing cannot become reality just because
you want it very much. I learned this.

468
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:40,903
From whom?

469
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:48,470
We were going to get married with Turgut
after the migration, we yearned for it.

470
00:57:49,836 --> 00:57:54,170
The winter is knocking at our door and
we still don’t know where we will go to.

471
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:58,503
I understand.
You are as impatient as your late mother.

472
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:03,570
Take a look around you. Can we survive
the winter on a mountain this high?

473
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:09,103
Why do you think we have headquarters?
Why do all the neighboring Beys come to...

474
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,303
...our Suleyman Shah’s marquee?

475
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:16,236
We will sit, we will talk and
we will solve this matter, if God permits.

476
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:19,370
Don’t you worry about it.
We should not be late.

477
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,303
My dear sweet girl, Aykiz.

478
00:58:28,436 --> 00:58:32,336
They will be gathering for headquarters,
Kurdoglu. Nobody knows what to do.

479
00:58:32,536 --> 00:58:34,503
We will get over this, with God’s help.

480
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,970
Kurdoglu, the mountain is silent,
the rivers don’t babble anymore...

481
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:40,770
...we have no rain.
We are stranded in this moorland.

482
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:44,270
If we don’t move quickly our herds
will perish, our babies will die.

483
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,870
Well? What is on your minds?

484
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:52,136
A horse neighs according to its owner,
Kurdoglu. Our warning is to you.

485
00:58:52,436 --> 00:58:54,303
Weigh in on the decisions.

486
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:59,303
Suleyman Shah is weak.
He can’t even ride a horse now.

487
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,770
In other words, Kurdoglu...

488
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,470
...horse belongs to who rides it,
sword belongs to who gird it.

489
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:19,170
Mother?

490
00:59:25,236 --> 00:59:28,036
I came to Akcakoca to get
some healing herbs.

491
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:33,103
He is out. Tell me what you want,
I will bring them to you, mother.

492
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,436
No, I will come and pick them up later.

493
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,070
Our guest.

494
00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:44,103
Numan Bey’s daughter. Halime.

495
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:52,136
Welcome to our tribe, my girl.
How is your father, did he recover?

496
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:55,936
-Yes.
-I am glad. May God heal him.

497
00:59:56,503 --> 01:00:00,503
Our tents are always open for you.
If you have a problem, do not hesitate...

498
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:04,870
...come and tell me immediately, alright?
-May God bless you, Hayme Hanim.

499
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:18,836
Not on the ground, not in the air...

500
01:00:19,903 --> 01:00:22,436
...only in the hearts of
devoted believers...

501
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:26,536
...the One that creates,
makes all creation one...

502
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,770
...in the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.

503
01:00:30,136 --> 01:00:36,970
Between the blue skies and dark ground,
let our blood, our clan, our tribe...

504
01:00:37,803 --> 01:00:42,270
...our homes, our sons, our daughters...

505
01:00:42,803 --> 01:00:46,336
...be united, be free, be keen.

506
01:00:47,403 --> 01:00:51,770
In the presence of our most just Bey,
may we bless our headquarters.

507
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:53,570
-Amen.
-Amen.

508
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:03,270
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

509
01:01:03,803 --> 01:01:08,370
...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.

510
01:01:16,236 --> 01:01:17,303
Thank you.

511
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,470
My beys, my warriors,
the leaders of my clans.

512
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:39,936
Welcome and be blessed.

513
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,170
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:46,770
Thank God that before we set on the road
to sell our goods, a trader has come.

515
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,203
I say that we sell our goods
to this trader at prime value...

516
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,803
...and save from the travel expenses.

517
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,470
That would be fine
if our only problem was the goods.

518
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:58,503
We don’t have any pastures left
to graze our stock.

519
01:01:58,836 --> 01:02:02,770
They cannot drink water, cannot give milk.
They are all starving to death.

520
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:05,303
We need to find a solution immediately.

521
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:09,370
I also see the despair. We sent messengers
to all beys in the region.

522
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:13,403
We asked for a territory
but famine is everywhere.

523
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:18,270
Moreover, Turkmen tribes running away
from the Mongol invasion are everywhere.

524
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:22,170
What shall we do, shall we draw our swords
against our brothers for a pasture?

525
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:26,370
Is God’s merciful treasure is closed, Bey?
We have been camping here for months.

526
01:02:26,503 --> 01:02:30,336
We cannot find a solution.
When did Kayis became so desperate?

527
01:02:30,903 --> 01:02:34,070
-Isn’t there anywhere for us to go?
-If we cannot find a solution...

528
01:02:34,203 --> 01:02:36,036
...how can we sustain our tribe?

529
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:40,203
Since when have we forgotten God,
the Bringer of Prosperity.

530
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:43,970
Our souls are kneaded with patience.

531
01:02:45,536 --> 01:02:49,036
Whatever he blesses us with,
we should be happy.

532
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:54,836
We learned what patience is by traveling
without a home, Wild Demir.

533
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:59,236
Our wish is that our descendants don’t
wonder about without a home as well...

534
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,070
...don’t tell us what patience is.

535
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:05,836
When did I ever leave you without clothes
or food, for you to worry so much?

536
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,503
Never, Bey. I did not mean like that.

537
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:13,903
Bey, you never let us go bare or hungry.
At the same time we never let you be...

538
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:16,803
...without soldiers or weapons.

539
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:22,070
Bey, we say that we should find
a new home and migrate from here.

540
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,436
-To where?
-Anywhere where our sheep can live.

541
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:30,336
Let us go back to our forefathers’ lands.
They say the Mongols are getting weaker.

542
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:34,870
Whoever says this is a liar! The Mongol
bandits are like hungry wolf packs.

543
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,103
Didn’t anyone think of a solution, Bey?

544
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:39,570
Aleppo.

545
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:57,370
I heard that  Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz is
gathering an army against the crusaders.

546
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,370
What do you have in mind, my nephew?

547
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:05,203
I say that, we should send
an envoy to Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz.

548
01:04:08,436 --> 01:04:14,003
He should say, “you give us a home,
we shall give you soldiers with weapons.”

549
01:04:15,003 --> 01:04:21,503
This way we can fight with the crusaders
to become veterans and at the same time...

550
01:04:21,936 --> 01:04:24,303
...we could have a place we can call home.

551
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,536
Aleppo.

552
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,270
We should act at once, Bey.

553
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,336
Since when do we give a decision
before I say the last word?

554
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,470
I am sorry, Bey.

555
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:50,970
Do you accept Gundogdu’s suggestion, Agas?

556
01:04:51,436 --> 01:04:53,036
-We accept.
-Yes.

557
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:57,936
I find it suitable as well.
May it be prosperous, if God permits.

558
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,536
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

559
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,503
Who will go as the envoy, Bey?

560
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:00,003
Ertugrul!

561
01:06:07,803 --> 01:06:12,336
Suleyman Shah, some tactless people in
your tribe has put a smear in our honor.

562
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:17,070
The honor of the Sultan who gave a home
to my tribe is my honor, Karatoygar.

563
01:06:17,236 --> 01:06:21,303
What did we do to dishonor
Sultan Aladdin and his commander?

564
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:29,036
This axe came out of the man you killed.

565
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:35,236
-Did you forget the axe there?
-I did.

566
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:40,170
You ambushed an ambassador regiment
and slaughtered their knights.

567
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:44,436
As if that was not enough,
you kidnapped the three prisoners...

568
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:48,470
...the regiment was taking to the Sultan.
Give back those prisoners.

569
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:54,036
You talk like you don’t know
our customs, Karatoygar!

570
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,903
We do not hand over guests
who have come to our tribe.

571
01:06:58,036 --> 01:06:59,870
Especially if they are wounded.

572
01:07:00,036 --> 01:07:03,170
I came here as the representative
of the Seljuk Sultan.

573
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,870
You have to obey my orders as if they are
coming out of the Sultan’s mouth.

574
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,336
Or else, you know what would happen,
Suleyman Shah.

575
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:14,236
We live and die with our customs,
Karatoygar!

576
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:18,003
We know that the Sultan is ruling
the state but he would...

577
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:21,936
...put his forefather Oguz’s
customs first, then sit on his throne.

578
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:25,570
You cannot have a sultan from a man
who doesn’t know customs and tradition.

579
01:07:25,903 --> 01:07:27,936
You cannot be a Bey or a man!

580
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:31,336
And we would not have anything to do
with someone who is not a man!

581
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:35,003
You should know this as
a commander of the Great Seljuk.

582
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,003
This was my last word.

583
01:07:38,803 --> 01:07:40,103
You can go now.

584
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:45,036
We asked you nicely, Suleyman Shah.
You have two days.

585
01:07:46,336 --> 01:07:50,070
If you don’t give them,
we know how to come and get them.

586
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,936
Don’t oppose the Seljuk.

587
01:07:56,103 --> 01:07:58,870
You know what would happen otherwise.

588
01:08:10,036 --> 01:08:14,036
-What is my father trying to do?
-He is too old to know what he is doing.

589
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,903
I told you that it would all be revealed
soon. This is only the beginning.

590
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:29,803
Stay here.

591
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:55,470
Seljuk Sultan Aladdin Kayqubad’s
first assistant.

592
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,770
Commander of Haremzshahs.

593
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:21,003
Right hand man of the Khalifa, Omar.

594
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:27,803
Now all the Muslim world shall
cry out revenge.

595
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:30,836
Then it will be the turn of the Papacy.

596
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,003
Bisol!

597
01:10:12,503 --> 01:10:13,870
Who did this?

598
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:17,303
They ambushed the regiment
who was taking the prisoners.

599
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:19,436
I said who?

600
01:10:20,103 --> 01:10:21,370
Kayis.

601
01:10:22,003 --> 01:10:23,870
But we don’t know who.

602
01:10:28,203 --> 01:10:29,303
Ertugrul!

603
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,103
You caused all this!

604
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:35,136
Don’t shout at me, brother.

605
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,003
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

606
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,003
Not your father, nor your tribe!

607
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,903
What would have you done?

608
01:10:43,236 --> 01:10:46,270
What would have you done?
Would you turn away and go?

609
01:10:47,036 --> 01:10:49,403
The Gundogdu I know is not
that kind of a man.

610
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,136
The Gundogdu I know would not
step on justice or fairness.

611
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:58,236
Justice. Fairness.
What justice? What fairness?

612
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:01,770
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

613
01:11:02,336 --> 01:11:06,003
Hunger is all around us! Winter is coming
and we don’t even know where to go!

614
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,103
The animals are starving to death.

615
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:13,370
Justice. Fairness. Open your eyes!

616
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,870
Open your eyes! Look around you!

617
01:11:18,836 --> 01:11:20,970
Right in the middle of the headquarters!

618
01:11:21,803 --> 01:11:25,436
Look at what you did when matters of
life or death were discussed.

619
01:11:29,136 --> 01:11:33,036
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

620
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:53,803
Forgive me, father.
I could not protect him.

621
01:11:57,336 --> 01:11:58,503
I could not.

622
01:12:01,536 --> 01:12:02,970
I could not.

623
01:12:17,436 --> 01:12:20,403
The world is not left to anyone,
let alone us, Aktolgali.

624
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:24,503
What should a man live for,
in this world of lies?

625
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:30,336
What should he ride to?
What should he gird his sword for?

626
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,103
Why should he have a home?

627
01:12:35,903 --> 01:12:39,103
Why do we have states, customs or homes?

628
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:48,470
The tyrant is going to make the sky fall
on us if we don’t give him the guests.

629
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,203
Wouldn’t the sky fall on us if we do?

630
01:12:57,136 --> 01:13:00,103
If we don’t give them,
my father will be in trouble.

631
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,170
What should I do, Aktolgali?

632
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:11,536
For a world where we cannot
even command one breath...

633
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:17,070
...are we going to give up?
Are we going to submit to the tyrant?

634
01:13:18,236 --> 01:13:20,536
Won’t our customs fall silent then?

635
01:13:20,936 --> 01:13:23,170
Won’t our fire burn out then?

636
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,370
Right, Aktolgali?

637
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:42,770
Karatoygar is a big tyrant.
He would do everything in his power.

638
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:48,236
Aleppo was a good thought, Gundogdu.
You showed everyone your intelligence...

639
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:51,203
...as well as the next Bey
when the time comes.

640
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:58,870
We need to get rid of this Karatoygar
from our backs.

641
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,870
When my father says “customs”
he never backs down.

642
01:14:03,336 --> 01:14:07,003
Ertugrul, look at the problems
you created for us.

643
01:14:08,436 --> 01:14:13,103
We need to convince my father. If we
convince him, Ertugrul would back down.

644
01:14:13,336 --> 01:14:15,803
You talk like you don’t know your father.

645
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:18,803
He would not give them even
if the sky fell down.

646
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:21,470
What will we do then?

647
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:27,070
Your father told me that he will
send me to Karatoygar as an envoy.

648
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:30,303
I will do anything that is required.

649
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,070
Ertugrul Bey.

650
01:14:49,503 --> 01:14:50,936
Do you have time?

651
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,570
What happened? Is there a problem?

652
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,836
No. This is something else.

653
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:02,270
I am listening.

654
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:05,903
I heard that Karatoygar came.
He wanted us.

655
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,370
-Yes, he did.
-Don’t put your tribe in danger for us.

656
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:13,469
We can take care of ourselves.

657
01:15:14,003 --> 01:15:17,203
My father is getting better.
We can leave within two days.

658
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:24,469
Even if all the world were against us,
we would not deliver you to those tyrants.

659
01:15:30,103 --> 01:15:33,470
If you get in a fight with Karatoygar,
there would be consequences.

660
01:15:33,803 --> 01:15:38,203
Don’t worry.
We Kayis know how to handle all hardships.

661
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:02,003
What’s up?

662
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:08,036
I cannot sleep, mother.

663
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:10,870
Sit down.

664
01:16:19,203 --> 01:16:21,170
What do you dwell on now?

665
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:25,803
I fell into a fire, mother.
I fell right in the middle of it.

666
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:30,303
I would not mind if I got burnt alone,
but I threw the whole tribe into fire.

667
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,770
When you were at the point of falling,
did you know that it would come to this?

668
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:43,970
Whether you would be facing
those infidel bandits...

669
01:16:44,236 --> 01:16:47,770
...or that said commander being allies
with the crusaders?

670
01:16:49,303 --> 01:16:54,003
Could you have closed your eyes and
turned your back to the...

671
01:16:54,303 --> 01:16:58,770
-...cries of that gazelle eyed beauty?
-How could I, mother?

672
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:09,536
You could not. You would not, my son.
You could not.

673
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:16,403
You couldn’t have known that it would
come to this when you went hunting...

674
01:17:17,136 --> 01:17:21,070
...that you would be throwing
the whole tribe into fire with yourself.

675
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:24,403
You threw us in.

676
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:29,203
Yes, you did.

677
01:17:34,103 --> 01:17:38,036
The fire can burn a dough
and turn it into ash...

678
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:42,870
...or it may cook the dough into bread.

679
01:17:43,803 --> 01:17:46,403
It was He who took you to
that place you fell.

680
01:17:46,803 --> 01:17:50,803
You don’t have the right to protest
His decision, nor does the tribe.

681
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:57,270
This is a test from the Great God.
In this test we can either turn to ash...

682
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:02,003
...or transform into bread. So don’t
listen to those whispers inside you...

683
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:05,770
...or to the presumptuous people
inside the tribe.

684
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:14,003
Become a soldier of our customs and stand
strong behind your father’s decisions.

685
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:20,370
May God never take you or
my father away from leading us.

686
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,136
May God protect you, my son.

687
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,303
Come on, take this water and
put it to your father’s side.

688
01:19:58,203 --> 01:19:59,936
I brought you water, father.

689
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:05,503
Give me some.

690
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,136
I should have been there instead of you.

691
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:55,236
I will fight until the blood of
the ones who did this to you is dried up.

692
01:20:55,403 --> 01:20:58,103
I will fight until the last one of
them is in a grave.

693
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:01,903
You will be revenged, my brother.
I promise you.

694
01:21:03,136 --> 01:21:08,003
If God won’t be by my side on this path,
I will turn to devils.

695
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:12,103
I will bring hell upon the Turkmens.

696
01:21:12,503 --> 01:21:15,803
I will be their wrath until the day I die.

697
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,970
I promise you.

698
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:28,136
Forgive me, father.

699
01:21:37,203 --> 01:21:41,770
That was it, Ilyas Fakih.
I didn’t know how to interpret this dream.

700
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:46,970
But a lump of fire has been burning
inside me since last night.

701
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:05,303
There are two options, Bey.

702
01:22:06,336 --> 01:22:08,470
First one is, hard times await us.

703
01:22:09,303 --> 01:22:10,770
The second is...

704
01:22:11,503 --> 01:22:14,836
...this may be a spiritual order on
who will be your successor.

705
01:22:14,837 --> 01:22:14,952


706
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:25,943
Father?

707
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:37,376
-Are you fine? Do you have any pain?
-Do not worry.

708
01:22:37,676 --> 01:22:40,610
I am awake now. I will be up in no time.

709
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:42,243
Thank God.

710
01:22:43,843 --> 01:22:45,043
Get well soon.

711
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:48,076
If you need anything Yigit can inform us.

712
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:52,943
Ertugrul. Yigit told me everything.

713
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,076
You and the people who raised
you are valiant people.

714
01:22:58,043 --> 01:23:00,276
You saved and protected us.

715
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:04,243
We did what our customs order us to do.
There is no debt for that.

716
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:08,710
The people in these lands have long
forgotten their customs.

717
01:23:09,043 --> 01:23:13,843
We must be God’s loved subjects for
someone like you to be there for us.

718
01:23:13,976 --> 01:23:15,410
Please don’t say that.

719
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:18,143
I should go. And you should rest.

720
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:29,010
Listen to me, Halime.
Find us some horses immediately.

721
01:23:30,143 --> 01:23:34,043
Get prepared with your brother.
Don’t let anyone get suspicious.

722
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,910
What is happening, father?
What will we do?

723
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,076
We are going.

724
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,810
Halime, there is no other way.

725
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:49,910
If we stay for one more day,
we would endanger their lives as well.

726
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,810
I am going to the stable.

727
01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:00,110
Right before the headquarters,
where is this coming from, Gundogdu?

728
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,743
I am going to look at
the new horse they brought.

729
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:05,276
And you can start preparing
for the Aleppo journey.

730
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,676
I can make everything ready but...

731
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:13,643
...is it confirmed that
you will be going to Aleppo?

732
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:15,076
Don’t say that.

733
01:24:18,676 --> 01:24:21,043
I was the one who put forth
the idea at the headquarters.

734
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:23,110
It is my right to be the envoy.

735
01:24:24,243 --> 01:24:26,343
-Of course but...
-Of course but what?

736
01:24:26,676 --> 01:24:29,176
Why are you worked up
so early in the morning, Selcan?

737
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:33,110
I don’t know whether I should worry about
the fact that you will be going or...

738
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,643
...the disappointment you will feel
if your father does not choose you.

739
01:24:36,776 --> 01:24:39,210
Of course he will send me.
Who else can he send?

740
01:24:45,343 --> 01:24:50,610
Hatun, look, if you are feeling sad
that I will be going...

741
01:24:51,276 --> 01:24:55,276
...during the time I go and come back,
you can greet me with two lives.

742
01:25:01,076 --> 01:25:05,610
When you are dealing with the horses in
the stable and me preparing you...

743
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:09,710
...provisions for the journey, you'd be
waiting for a very long time, Gundogdu.

744
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:14,210
I can check the horses after
the headquarters then.

745
01:25:17,143 --> 01:25:18,776
Bey, do we have permission?

746
01:25:24,243 --> 01:25:25,843
Come in, Hamza, come in.

747
01:25:27,843 --> 01:25:31,243
-What happened?
-Bey, Suleyman Shah wants to see you.

748
01:25:33,843 --> 01:25:36,076
In the name of God. In the name of God.

749
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,676
In the name of God.

750
01:25:44,243 --> 01:25:45,410
In the name of God.

751
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,843
I have decided that...

752
01:26:08,643 --> 01:26:10,643
...Ertugrul will go to Aleppo.

753
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:22,676
Gundogdu.

754
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,076
I have some things to discuss with you.

755
01:26:26,943 --> 01:26:28,110
Stay here.

756
01:26:32,176 --> 01:26:34,843
Ertugrul, you go and prepare yourself.

757
01:26:35,243 --> 01:26:38,210
Tell Ilyas Fakih that
he will be coming with you.

758
01:27:02,376 --> 01:27:03,710
Come on!

759
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,810
Come on! Quick!

760
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:08,676
Faster, Turgut, faster! Come on!

761
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,676
Come on!

762
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,810
-I won!
-I won!

763
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:18,876
Don’t be ridiculous, I won!
I passed the line first!

764
01:27:19,076 --> 01:27:21,843
-What are you saying?
-I was the first to pass the line!

765
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:23,276
Ask Aykiz!

766
01:27:23,776 --> 01:27:26,143
Aykiz cannot be the referee.
She is your sweetheart.

767
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:30,343
How can you say this, Bamsi Beyrek?
When did I ever lie?

768
01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:35,943
-I told you not to do that!
-What would you do if I do?

769
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:40,243
-Your brain is as big as a walnut.
-But I am a hard nut to crack!

770
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:43,076
Don’t be afraid! Come on then! Come on!

771
01:27:43,276 --> 01:27:45,076
Stop right there! Stop!

772
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,243
What is wrong with Ertugrul?

773
01:27:54,076 --> 01:27:56,243
Suleyman Shah called him to his tent.

774
01:27:56,676 --> 01:28:00,143
-I wonder what the problem is.
-He is probably going gazelle hunting.

775
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,810
That gazelle deserved to be hunted.

776
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:13,943
Get ready. We are going to Aleppo.

777
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:18,210
Bamsi! We are going to Aleppo, Bamsi!

778
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:23,810
I was getting fat sitting all day!

779
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:27,776
Tell Ilyas Fakih as well,
he is coming with us.

780
01:28:41,343 --> 01:28:47,376
I brought up the Aleppo idea.
I told you that El Aziz needed soldiers.

781
01:28:50,776 --> 01:28:52,643
Why him and not me, father?

782
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:03,343
Because of this, son.

783
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:07,710
“I know. I can do. I said.”

784
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:11,143
When did arrogance grew inside you?

785
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:16,043
Am I the arrogant one?
The whole tribe is starving.

786
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:19,943
Famine is everywhere.
We could not even go on a foray.

787
01:29:20,176 --> 01:29:21,410
Why?

788
01:29:21,976 --> 01:29:24,910
-Because our Bey has a boil problem.
-Know your place!

789
01:29:25,043 --> 01:29:29,110
Let it go, father. The whole tribe
complains about your old age.

790
01:30:02,676 --> 01:30:04,610
-Brother?
-Get your hands off me!

791
01:30:35,643 --> 01:30:38,743
Do you think it is your brother’s right
to be the ambassador?

792
01:30:40,343 --> 01:30:41,343
Yes.

793
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:44,310
Why me and not my brother?

794
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:48,210
Because he started to worship
the flame of power. His soul is captured.

795
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:55,143
So I put out the flame.

796
01:31:02,176 --> 01:31:04,676
Now, let us talk about
the flame within you.

797
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,843
Our guests will stay
with the tribe until you come back.

798
01:31:08,643 --> 01:31:12,210
I am telling you this so that
you can focus on your mission.

799
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:16,110
Do not come back empty handed from Aleppo.

800
01:31:17,243 --> 01:31:19,676
The future of Kayi is on your shoulders.

801
01:31:20,043 --> 01:31:22,910
Your failure will mean
the calamity of all of us.

802
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:27,810
For the land El Aziz is going to give us,
we shall accept any price.

803
01:31:29,343 --> 01:31:32,110
But not a single Oguz
is a sacrificial lamb.

804
01:31:32,876 --> 01:31:36,410
Don’t you ever forget.
As much as you need a home near Aleppo...

805
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:39,410
...Ameer  of Aleppo needs Kayi’s Alps.

806
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:44,076
Do not ever bow your head down.
Show them that you are a real Oguz...

807
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:47,143
...who knows what he wants and
is ready to make a just deal.

808
01:31:50,876 --> 01:31:52,076
May God help you.

809
01:31:53,243 --> 01:31:56,010
I shall succeed in my duty
even if the cost is my life, father.

810
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:58,643
I shall be back to make you proud.

811
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:04,143
What happened?

812
01:32:04,976 --> 01:32:06,176
Gundogdu!

813
01:32:06,776 --> 01:32:09,276
-Gundogdu, stop! Stop!
-Leave me alone!

814
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:12,376
Friends, Alps!

815
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:15,843
Stop! Please!

816
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:23,043
Out! Get out!

817
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,676
Aren’t you going to talk?

818
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:51,076
Ambassador.
Ertugrul became the ambassador.

819
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,876
-I told you!
-Enough!

820
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,343
Take it! Drink.

821
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:06,810
Drink this.

822
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,810
This must be Mother Hayme’s doing.

823
01:33:16,043 --> 01:33:20,110
I don’t care less. It does not matter.
I know what I am going to do.

824
01:33:20,343 --> 01:33:22,976
No! Please do not act in fury.

825
01:33:23,343 --> 01:33:25,310
Those who act with fury always lose.

826
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,943
Enough, woman!
For the love of God, enough!

827
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:31,910
Finish your business.
Be ready with your Alps.

828
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:35,376
When that tactless brother of yours
messes everything up...

829
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:39,276
...you will get what you deserve.
And do not forget.

830
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:43,243
Angels of death wait for
the big day in the Bey’s marquee.

831
01:33:49,043 --> 01:33:52,910
The news got stuck in my throat, Turgut.
I cannot swallow it...

832
01:33:53,876 --> 01:33:55,410
...nor can I spit it out.

833
01:33:57,043 --> 01:33:59,976
You talk like this is the first time
we will be apart, Aykiz.

834
01:34:00,143 --> 01:34:02,276
When did we ever be together, Turgut?

835
01:34:02,676 --> 01:34:06,243
Is waiting for the road at your father’s
tent and waiting for your man...

836
01:34:06,376 --> 01:34:08,310
...in your husband’s tent be the same?

837
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:12,776
It is not the sorrow of separation
that is stuck in my throat...

838
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:16,143
...it is not being able to come together.

839
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:21,243
Anytime we talk about getting married,
it gets delayed for some reason.

840
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:27,776
I promise.
There will be no delay this time.

841
01:34:29,176 --> 01:34:32,110
I don’t know whether
Aleppo will be a success or not but...

842
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:36,143
...the first wedding in our new land
will be ours. I promise you.

843
01:34:36,643 --> 01:34:41,910
The drummers will cry out “Aykiz and
Turgut are finally getting married.”

844
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:47,376
All the girls in the weaving area
will say, “the most beautiful girl...

845
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:51,243
...of the tribe is getting married,
from now on it be our turn.”

846
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:55,310
When you leave Wild  Demir’s tent,
even the Sultan’s daughters will...

847
01:34:55,643 --> 01:34:57,610
...get jealous of your beauty.

848
01:35:08,943 --> 01:35:11,843
I wanted to say how sorry I am.
I do not know the words...

849
01:35:11,976 --> 01:35:15,310
...that can describe this pain.
-Only you can understand me, Elanora.

850
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,043
Your father’s killers were
Muslims as well.

851
01:35:19,876 --> 01:35:22,276
May you have a good journey, Titus.
Be careful.

852
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:24,810
I will be back, Elanora. See you soon.

853
01:35:38,343 --> 01:35:43,743
You have witnessed a good commander
transform into a real Templar knight.

854
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:48,110
Revenge.
That was the only thing lacking in Titus.

855
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:52,876
If there is no revenge, a hay soldier
and a knight are no different.

856
01:35:54,076 --> 01:35:57,210
Bisol’s death became Titus’ miracle.

857
01:35:58,276 --> 01:36:01,210
May God forgive Bisol’s sins.

858
01:36:26,843 --> 01:36:31,410
Looking at the presents, I can say that
Suleyman Shah realized the mistake he did.

859
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:35,976
Our Bey likes the Seljuk,
he respects them.

860
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:40,243
But only I can solve this issue,
Karatoygar.

861
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:45,910
The time limit I have put down
expires in the morning, Kurdoglu.

862
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:52,843
Or else the Seljuk’s wrath will burn
the whole Kayi tribe.

863
01:36:53,376 --> 01:36:57,910
-You would burn with us, Karatoygar.
-How dare you?

864
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:01,376
Don’t tell me that
the Sultan knows about this.

865
01:37:02,043 --> 01:37:05,910
Your manpower is not enough
to take them from Kayi by force.

866
01:37:06,943 --> 01:37:09,010
You need to raise a whole army.

867
01:37:11,376 --> 01:37:15,710
I am aware that you have armies
that are strong enough to crush Kayi.

868
01:37:15,943 --> 01:37:21,143
You can do that. But first,
the Sultan would have to be informed.

869
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:26,143
And this would not suit you.
It would not suit us either.

870
01:37:26,976 --> 01:37:32,876
I shall come to the point. For you and
the tribe to win at the same time...

871
01:37:33,943 --> 01:37:36,143
...you need to hear what I have to say.

872
01:37:37,943 --> 01:37:41,243
If you aim to cooperate...

873
01:37:43,176 --> 01:37:46,410
...tell me. Who did this?

874
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:51,110
Was it Suleyman Shah?

875
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,410
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul.

876
01:38:12,776 --> 01:38:14,110
Bamsi, Dogan.

877
01:38:32,376 --> 01:38:34,176
The word is out about a journey.

878
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:37,243
When?

879
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:40,943
We shall set on the road to Aleppo
at the morning prayer.

880
01:38:43,743 --> 01:38:45,043
Are you prepared?

881
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,943
The Alps are always ready for anything.

882
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:53,243
True. Everything seems easy
when you get used to it.

883
01:38:54,976 --> 01:38:57,643
Sometimes it gets harder
when you get used to it.

884
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:21,343
May you have a good journey.

885
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:24,976
May the sun not burn you.

886
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,643
May you don’t get cold.

887
01:39:31,143 --> 01:39:34,043
May your feet don’t touch a stone.
May you go like water...

888
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:36,810
...return to your tribe like water.

889
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:47,310
My horse shall fly me to
my destination and back to my tribe.

890
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:52,976
Your father and mother would be happy.

891
01:39:54,376 --> 01:39:55,710
What about you?

892
01:39:56,776 --> 01:39:57,910
Me?

893
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:01,410
I would be long gone.

894
01:40:01,943 --> 01:40:03,210
You cannot go...

895
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,043
...before I come back.

896
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:10,076
Your father would not recover fully.

897
01:40:16,876 --> 01:40:19,076
May you have a good journey, Ertugrul Bey.

898
01:40:20,243 --> 01:40:21,710
All of us.

899
01:40:32,243 --> 01:40:36,210
There is something I wonder.
Our involuntary guests...

900
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:39,210
...are they relatives of
Sultan Aladdin or something?

901
01:40:39,376 --> 01:40:44,210
-That does not concern you!
-True. It does not concern me.

902
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:47,243
Come to the point. What is on your mind?

903
01:40:48,076 --> 01:40:52,143
If you want to take what you want,
I shall have one small condition.

904
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:31,876
Ertugrul...

905
01:41:34,643 --> 01:41:37,676
...whatever my late wife and Aykiz are...

906
01:41:38,043 --> 01:41:42,743
...Halime and her family are the same
for me. Don’t you worry about them.

907
01:41:46,243 --> 01:41:48,343
May God bless you, Wild  Demir.

908
01:41:50,343 --> 01:41:55,410
May God bless you instead.
Trust makes a man grow.

909
01:41:56,143 --> 01:42:02,743
You trusted me in this tribe,
you came to my door, you confided in me...

910
01:42:03,276 --> 01:42:09,843
...that is why, may God bless you. Halime
and her family are my responsibility.

911
01:42:10,243 --> 01:42:13,976
You can be rest assured.
Come on, may God be with you.

912
01:42:34,076 --> 01:42:37,010
My son. My life.

913
01:42:38,643 --> 01:42:40,243
My dear son...

914
01:42:41,876 --> 01:42:44,343
...may your road
and fortune be always open.

915
01:42:44,676 --> 01:42:47,043
The weight of Kayi is on your shoulders...

916
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:51,110
...never bow your head
nor give a promise you cannot keep.

917
01:43:05,043 --> 01:43:06,910
May God give you a clear road.

918
01:44:16,143 --> 01:44:18,376
<i>You may be going and not coming back.</i>

919
01:44:19,143 --> 01:44:21,310
<i>You may come back but not see me.</i>

920
01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:24,910
<i>I will ride tirelessly to see you again.</i>

921
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:28,010
<i>May you have a clear road, Ertugrul.</i>

922
01:45:39,343 --> 01:45:42,810
While you were being punished for
rebelling against your father...

923
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:45,976
...the little Bey became the ambassador.

924
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,010
I knew you would come.

925
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:46,176
Welcome.

926
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:57,776
I don’t care about the prisoners,
Karatoygar.

927
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:00,343
They ran away in your territory.

928
01:47:00,776 --> 01:47:02,276
We did our part.

929
01:47:02,976 --> 01:47:06,243
Give me the name of the person
who killed my brother.

930
01:47:09,976 --> 01:47:13,176
You are impatient to become a hangman.

931
01:47:14,643 --> 01:47:18,376
Be careful, don’t let the noose of
the hangman get around you neck.

932
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:23,410
Don’t try to delegate
your own inaptitude to me.

933
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:28,943
The knights you brag about could not
deal with a few trifling Alps.

934
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:33,176
What do you want from me to give his name?

935
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:37,610
I will give you more than you want.

936
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,676
I will deliver him directly to you.

937
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:43,910
This is not an issue of business.

938
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:50,843
Do you understand me?
It is an assistance to a friend in pain.

939
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:55,143
We never let ourselves stay indebted
on any help we receive.

940
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,143
Alright.

941
01:47:57,976 --> 01:47:59,110
Who?

942
01:48:01,676 --> 01:48:04,110
Suleyman Shah’ son...

943
01:48:05,176 --> 01:48:06,976
...Ertugrul.

944
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:13,376
Aykiz...

945
01:49:14,243 --> 01:49:16,743
...can you look at these patterns as well?

946
01:49:17,776 --> 01:49:19,043
I won’t be long.

947
01:49:35,243 --> 01:49:36,943
When are you leaving?

948
01:49:41,276 --> 01:49:42,976
When my father says so.

949
01:49:43,276 --> 01:49:45,376
Do not try to stand strong.

950
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:49,743
People do not stay in a place
where they are not wanted.

951
01:49:49,943 --> 01:49:52,943
If you have some sense of shame,
go at once.

952
01:49:53,376 --> 01:49:56,176
It is customary.
You cannot say go to a guest.

953
01:49:56,343 --> 01:49:58,410
That is why everyone keeps quiet.

954
01:50:01,243 --> 01:50:02,776
And...

955
01:50:03,810 --> 01:50:06,843
...will you paying your debt
to these people like this?

956
01:50:07,076 --> 01:50:11,276
Is this what you deem proper for people
who gave you bread, their own tent...

957
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:13,610
...and dressed your wounds?

958
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:16,943
-I...
-You...

959
01:50:17,676 --> 01:50:21,176
While you try to flirt around,
blood will be spilt in the tribe.

960
01:50:21,343 --> 01:50:23,276
Blood. Go your own way.

961
01:50:31,243 --> 01:50:33,610
Halime. Halime!

962
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:34,976
Selcan!

963
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,676
What did you tell the girl?

964
01:50:46,943 --> 01:50:48,610
What she needed to hear.

965
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:53,343
Is it your duty to tell her
what she needs to hear?

966
01:50:55,276 --> 01:50:57,643
I am thinking about
the future of the tribe.

967
01:50:57,776 --> 01:51:00,010
That girl should have heard this long ago.

968
01:51:01,343 --> 01:51:04,776
Such a shame.
Daugther of a Bey forgets our customs.

969
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:09,010
She talks on top of the words
of her forefathers.

970
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:13,810
Come to your senses, Selcan.

971
01:51:14,743 --> 01:51:18,410
Otherwise, you might find yourself
under the stones you thought you crushed.

972
01:51:31,243 --> 01:51:33,343
-What happened?
-Mind your own business!

973
01:52:38,943 --> 01:52:42,210
Ertugrul has gone on a journey
with four Alps.

974
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:47,176
Eye for an eye. Devine justice.

975
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:49,976
-Where is he going?
-To Aleppo.

976
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,310
I shall take revenge with my own hands.

977
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:56,143
I can never let you do that, Titus.

978
01:52:58,976 --> 01:53:00,210
Why?

979
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:03,243
These lands are my jurisdiction.

980
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:07,776
In my borders, only I can use force.

981
01:53:09,176 --> 01:53:13,143
If it is heard that I made an alliance
with the crusaders to spill blood...

982
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:15,176
...our plan would fail.

983
01:53:15,676 --> 01:53:18,276
This man killed my brother, Karatoygar.

984
01:53:18,876 --> 01:53:21,043
I want you to bring him to me alive.

985
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:23,610
I shall take his life with my own hands.

986
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:29,943
Don’t you worry. I will present him to you
like a sacrificial ram.

987
01:53:33,676 --> 01:53:35,410
Karatoygar is convinced, Bey.

988
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:39,210
He wanted us to look after them
until they get better.

989
01:53:39,943 --> 01:53:42,010
Did you manage to learn who they are?

990
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:45,376
The pig’s son did not even utter
a single word about it.

991
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:49,410
If they made the great Seljuks stand up,
the issue must be serious.

992
01:53:49,976 --> 01:53:52,410
Our part should be to benefit from this.

993
01:53:55,343 --> 01:53:56,943
You asked for me, Bey.

994
01:53:59,176 --> 01:54:03,343
If you don’t have anything else to say,
you must be very tired, go and rest.

995
01:54:33,243 --> 01:54:35,943
Save me from this pest of a boil,
Akcakoca.

996
01:54:36,343 --> 01:54:37,809
If God permits, Bey.

997
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,776
My death will be from this.

998
01:54:51,376 --> 01:54:54,143
-Inform me of all developments.
-As you wish, Bey.

999
01:55:31,243 --> 01:55:32,943
Everything is ready, father.

1000
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:39,376
I have all the provisions ready,
we will be going tonight.

1001
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:45,076
Don’t worry about your wound, I watched
Akcakoca very closely to see what he does.

1002
01:55:45,743 --> 01:55:47,843
Halime, calm down, my girl.

1003
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:52,676
We will be running away from a place
we took refuge, as usual. That is all.

1004
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:56,143
Is that all, father?

1005
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,243
Is it only that for you?

1006
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:16,043
I don’t know what goes through
your mind but...

1007
01:56:17,876 --> 01:56:20,643
...what makes this place
different for you?

1008
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:24,343
Is there anything you are not telling me?

1009
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:27,110
I am very tired, father.

1010
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:31,110
I am tired of running away.

1011
01:56:34,843 --> 01:56:39,276
Let us start a new life.
Go some place where no one will find us.

1012
01:56:39,843 --> 01:56:43,876
Let us go beyond deserts and seas
but go from here, that is all I want.

1013
01:56:46,176 --> 01:56:47,743
Father?

1014
01:56:48,276 --> 01:56:50,876
What happened, son? What happened, Yigit?

1015
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,410
We have a guest. He wants to come in.

1016
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:57,076
Let him in.

1017
01:57:00,076 --> 01:57:02,910
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

1018
01:57:03,743 --> 01:57:04,810
Please.

1019
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:09,043
Father, look. Wild  Demir made
a sword for you and my sister.

1020
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:13,643
He is the best ironsmith in the region.
He makes the best swords.

1021
01:57:13,876 --> 01:57:18,010
Please don’t exaggerate, son.
Ours is only a pastime.

1022
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:21,676
-These are yours.
-Thank you.

1023
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:24,010
Don't mention it, my girl.

1024
01:57:24,243 --> 01:57:28,243
As Ertugrul Bey is not here,
I did not want you to be without weapons.

1025
01:57:28,776 --> 01:57:32,010
He would feel more comfortable.
I would do too.

1026
01:57:33,143 --> 01:57:36,276
Anyway, I am at my workshop
but my eye is on your tent.

1027
01:57:36,676 --> 01:57:39,243
If you need anything,
please do not hesitate.

1028
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:42,076
What could happen in a big tribe?

1029
01:57:47,043 --> 01:57:50,843
Look, my girl.
Ertugrul Bey is like a son to me.

1030
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:55,710
So I would never turn back his request.

1031
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:08,110
This was not called for.

1032
01:58:31,276 --> 01:58:32,843
We will go this way.

1033
01:58:33,343 --> 01:58:36,676
Tell Ertugrul that horses should
rest a bit. They are exhausted.

1034
01:58:37,176 --> 01:58:40,643
His mind is with Halime.
He wants to return before they go.

1035
01:58:40,843 --> 01:58:43,110
If you have the courage, you tell him.

1036
01:58:48,376 --> 01:58:49,710
Bey.

1037
01:58:52,243 --> 01:58:55,876
Us being exhausted is not an issue
but the horses are very tired.

1038
01:58:56,310 --> 01:58:59,210
Bey, shall we rest a bit
beside the stream?

1039
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:05,876
We can set camp down there.
We will set off before sunrise.

1040
01:59:06,376 --> 01:59:09,343
-Dogan, light a fire.
-As you wish, Bey.

1041
01:59:19,243 --> 01:59:20,843
Follow me quietly.

1042
02:01:22,743 --> 02:01:24,110
Peace be upon you.

1043
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,710
And peace be upon you.

1044
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:29,076
What happened to the gazelle?

1045
02:01:30,776 --> 02:01:36,043
We found it like this. It was probably
wounded while running away from a hunter.

1046
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:44,676
I think that hunter was me.

1047
02:01:47,876 --> 02:01:51,676
If you let this game get away,
you must be a bad hunter.

1048
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:55,076
I guess so.

1049
02:01:56,310 --> 02:02:01,010
Look at that beautiful face. So you
managed to escape from this big valiant.

1050
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:07,910
Well done to you.
In the name of God, may you recover soon.

1051
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:28,810
Come on now. Go. Go on.

1052
02:02:31,276 --> 02:02:33,643
Where do you come from and
where do you go?

1053
02:02:33,843 --> 02:02:36,076
We come from nowhere, to go anywhere.

1054
02:02:42,176 --> 02:02:43,643
What about you?

1055
02:02:44,610 --> 02:02:46,176
We are going to Aleppo.

1056
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:49,976
Then you should always be alert.

1057
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:52,643
Don’t become a hunt for
wolves and vultures.

1058
02:02:52,776 --> 02:02:55,910
The air here is very hazy.
Don’t be lost in the haze.

1059
02:03:02,676 --> 02:03:04,343
Will you grant me your name?

1060
02:03:06,643 --> 02:03:09,276
Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

1061
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,200
The time has come.

1062
02:03:31,166 --> 02:03:33,133
-Horses?
-Horses are ready.

1063
02:03:37,866 --> 02:03:41,766
I hid the saddles under the hay.
We will saddle up and go immediately.

1064
02:03:43,266 --> 02:03:45,166
There is no guard at the stable.

1065
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:54,933
-Will you be able to endure it, father?
-We have to do this.

1066
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,066
<i>May you have a good journey.</i>

1067
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,866
<i>May the sun not burn you.</i>

1068
02:04:09,033 --> 02:04:10,600
<i>May you don’t get cold.</i>

1069
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,866
<i>May your feet don’t touch a stone.</i>
<i>May you go like water...</i>

1070
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,033
<i>...return to your tribe like water.</i>

1071
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,933
Bamsi, is he asleep?

1072
02:04:29,133 --> 02:04:31,400
No, he is thinking of Halime Baci.

1073
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:36,300
-Keep your voice down!
-Don’t talk to me like that.

1074
02:04:36,766 --> 02:04:38,300
Enough! Be quiet!

1075
02:04:40,366 --> 02:04:42,300
Go to sleep. Be quiet.

1076
02:05:13,033 --> 02:05:14,800
You should relax, Titus.

1077
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:19,366
Before the sunrise,
we shall both get what we want.

1078
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:24,000
To look down on the enemy
is for the stupid, Karatoygar.

1079
02:05:24,266 --> 02:05:29,333
No one can escape from
a well planned ambush, Titus.

1080
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:32,333
No one.

1081
02:05:33,033 --> 02:05:37,133
I will deal with Wild Demir.
You finish the job quietly.

1082
02:05:39,133 --> 02:05:40,200
Come on.
