00:01:56,614 --> 00:02:03,835
"My fair body is getting
burnt in water."

2
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:11,207
"My fair body is getting
burnt in water."

3
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:18,715
"With the fire in my body,
waves are getting burnt."

4
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,543
"Water is getting burnt."

5
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:37,101
"My fair body is getting
burnt in water."

6
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:52,586
"Look, the cold fire is
tormenting me."

7
00:02:52,871 --> 00:03:00,092
"I wish.. somebody comes
and douses this fire."

8
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:05,197
"O beloved."

9
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:20,076
"My fair body is getting
burnt in water."

10
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,209
Grandpa!

11
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,543

00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,201
Call any doctor.
- Okay, okay cool.

32
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:02,811
Hello.

33
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,349

00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,113

37
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,318
Yes I'm going by the same road.

38
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,299
Okay that means you are somewhere
nearby, thank you so much.

39
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,959
What happen?

40
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,002
Coincidently he was in our area.

41
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,198
Don't worry, everything will be okay.

42
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,346
Don't worry.
I'll change and come.

43
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,740
Okay, come fast.

44
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,881
Grandpa..

45
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:55,805
Thank you doctor, come fast.

46
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,107
Come" this way.

47
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,811
Is it attack?
- I'm not sure.

48
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,175
But I have given him pills.

49
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,978
Did you give the injection?
- No.

50
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,717
Doctor, is it a heart attack?

51
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,391
No, just a muscular pain.

52
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,993
Sometime physical stress
can also lead to a heart attack.

53
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,661
So should I take him to hospital.

54
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,340
No, not at all. He is fine.

55
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,405
He needs to be monitored everyday.

56
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,843
I'll come tomorrow
and for next one month.

57
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,772
May be you won't like it.

58
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,586
Doctor, we need you doctor please.

59
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,186
Do you have a heart problem?

60
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:51,254
After looking at grandpa's condition in
tension she also got an asthama attack.

61
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,989
They both extremely love each other.

62
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,395
If one person is hurt
then other feels the pain.

63
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,599
Anny, tomorrow evening you
have to come to my dispensary.

64
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,605
Yes, okay.
- I'll give you some medicines.

65
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,968
Okay doctor.

66
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,205
Take care of grandpa
as well as yourself okay.

67
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,677
Sure.
- Bye.

68
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,043
Bye.

69
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:46,576
Enough.. enough.
- Why are you acting like kids?

70
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,135
No, I'm not feeling like
eating anything. - Grandpa..

71
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,107
Enough.

72
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,979
Okay fine, eat this apple at least.
- No not at all.

73
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,642
Apple will make your
health absolutely fine.

74
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:57,244
You know that phrase right.

75
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,855
An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.

76
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:08,793
Good grandpa today you
are really looking very fresh.

77
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,892
Thanks to you doctor.
- My pleasure.

78
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,700
Till when I have to eat
this patient's type food.

79
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,739
I'm tired of this disease.

80
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,469
Who said that you are ill?

81
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,573
You are absolutely all right.
You can eat everything.

82
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,210
What are you saying?

83
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,650
It's not me,
grandpa's report is telling this.

84
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:31,479
With these medicines he
needs morning and evening walk.

85
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,855
Yes, everyday morning and evening I
take him for a walk in this compound.

86
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:40,833
Come out of this compound
area and take grandpa also out.

87
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:44,668
Morning hill side, evening lake side.

88
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:47,838
Fresh air, new face.

89
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,372
I like it. Really, I like it.

90
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,437
I'm tired of seeing the same nurse.

91
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,312
Grandpa.
- Joking. I'm just joking.

92
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,821
Doctor, I keep telling
him that don't wear the uniform.

93
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:08,328
Or else I feel that I'm
not at home but in the hospital.

94
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,022
I think more than a nurse
she's your family member.

95
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,494
Isn't it Nikita?
- Yes.

96
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,964
Anny, is with me from past three years.

97
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,501
What happen to you?

98
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,038
I think some insect bit me.

99
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,672
These insects are damn lucky.

100
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,111
Grandpa!

101
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,381
Grandpa your sense
of humor is amazing.

102
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:41,057
Nikita do you play chess?

103
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,354
Grandpa plays alone.

104
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:50,229
I don't play, play my game
and wait for the other player.

105
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:53,026
DO you play?

106
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:54,834
Little bit.

107
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:56,301
So let's have a game.

108
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,868
Not today, may be some other time.
I'll leave.

109
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,207
Okay doctor,
come I'll drop you till the car.

110
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,874
You please sit, the nurse is here.

111
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,452
Please come.

112
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:21,292
Hey!
- Leave.

113
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,898
Say something.
- What?

114
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:25,999
Who bit you?

115
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,099
Insect.

116
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,801
Insect want to bite
you somewhere else also.

117
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,898
You be careful from the insect.

118
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,494
What?

119
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,167
These insects are very vicious.

120
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:13,421
Wow, it's a very good location.

121
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,145
Thanks to doctor.
- Greetings.

122
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:17,690
What are you doing
here so early morning.

123
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:23,526
We should always start our day with
a temple, my father says, use to say.

124
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,429
What do you mean by use to say?

125
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:30,301
My mom-dad left me alone
in the childhood and went to god.

126
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,136
But I have their blessing always.

127
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:34,935
You know.

128
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,932
Have a good life.
- I'll leave?

129
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,547
From when did you
start going to temple?

130
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,895
You won't understand.
This is my new plan.

131
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:57,995
I understand all your plans.

132
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,532
Really?

133
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,294
No.
- Yes.

134
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:04,668
No.
- Yes.

135
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,000
I said no.

136
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,563
When a girl says no that means yes.

137
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,302
And if she says yes?

138
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,504
Yes always means yes.

139
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,554
Grandpa,
this is my move and you are gone.

140
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,956
Yes. Yes.

141
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:29,597
Grandpa, I think today you are gone.

142
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,939
Yes you move is good my dear.
But I'm not among losers.

143
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:40,466
Let's see.
- What's that, near your ears?

144
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:42,570
What?

145
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,736
May be a piece.
- I can't see anything.

146
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,109
Wait..

147
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:53,148
Grandpa, you spoilt the entire game.

148
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,710
Grandpa, this is cheating.

149
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,221
You'll never improve.

150
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,284
This is when you say got a support.

151
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,023
Is it?
- What do we say in English?

152
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:05,767
Your favorite dialogue grandpa.
- Yes, what?

153
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,999
Everything is...
- Fair...

154
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,194
In...
- Love and...

155
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:10,602
War.
- Yes.

156
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:19,241
Now make drink tea.
- Okay, sugar?

157
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,940
Without sugar.
- Without sugar?

158
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:24,307
Yes and let's play a game.

159
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,156
You came.

160
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,391
You and here?

161
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,863
I come here everyday.

162
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,935
You didn't came from two days.

163
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,002
Were you missing me?

164
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:51,744
No, grandpa was missing you.

165
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,015
If you don't mind
should I say something?

166
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:57,979
Yes say.

167
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,090
You please don't wear
this color dress and come here.

168
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,655
Why?

169
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:07,964
This color excites me
a lot and I feel scared that"

170
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,592
...I should not loose control.

171
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:15,137
You look hot.

172
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,915
Doctor Vaidh, where from India?

173
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:33,282
North"
- Where in north?

174
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:37,686
From Rohtak twenty kilometers
far a village Ramgad.

175
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:43,427
Ramgad? I went there in 1940.

176
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:47,738
At that time there use to be ghosts.
Are they still there?

177
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:52,303
Grandpa, I'm a doctor and
I don't believe in ghost talks.

178
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:55,471
It's not that but self experience.

179
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:04,485
Please grandpa, don't talk
about all these things I feel scared.

180
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,289
There's nothing to get scared,
come on grandpa tell me

181
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,654
No grandpa, not today.

182
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:12,217
Be a brave girl.

183
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,964
Outside the village, next
to the lake there was a graveyard.

184
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,529
They say that one cyclonic night"

185
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,208
...there was a newly married girl..

186
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:30,340
...was crossing the lake
with the entire family.

187
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,613
Suddenly the boat turned"

188
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:37,212
...and everybody as well
as the married girl was drowned.

189
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,824
After that incident
on every black out night"

190
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:49,529
...the bride's spirit cries
for her unfulfilled wishes..

191
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:53,434
...and pounces on anybody
passing from there.

192
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,972
I don't believe it.
- I also never believed it.

193
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,969
But one night we friends
has a challenge..

194
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:06,087
...and I with my friend Shiva
went to see that witch near the lake.

195
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:13,656
It was rainy season,
the wind was blowing..

196
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:23,233
"Lights were thundering
and complete black out.

197
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:28,635
Both of us in that darkness
for the directions.

198
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:36,886
...were helping ourselves
with a small fire light.

199
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,145
Where to go and how to
go was there in our minds..

200
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,754
...and then we heard
a sound of an anklet.

201
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:54,823
Darkness everywhere.

202
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,894
Suddenly a dog started barking..

203
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,174
...and a lady was crying.

204
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:11,106
Then we stepped back..

205
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,077
...and somebody held
my neck from behind.

206
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:19,351
Grandpa..
- Stop this nonsense.

207
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:22,857
Grandpa, you know that
Nikita's heart is very weak..

208
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,725
...then why you have to do all this?

209
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,993
Forget it Nikita.
- Grandpa..

210
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,294
Do ghost catch people?

211
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,902
No, they just scare us from far..

212
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:38,001
...If they catch us
they'll die immediately.

213
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:41,640
I'll leave, as it is
I have to pass by a lake side.

214
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,642
Son, tomorrow will you come in
the afternoon wanted to speak to you.

215
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,148
Okay, I will come.
- Okay take care of yourself.

216
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,690
Do you know why that oldie
has called me in the afternoon?

217
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,584
I don't know.

218
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,090
May be asking for
a discount on the bill.

219
00:18:57,282 --> 00:19:00,323
Discount"
maybe he'll eat the entire bill.

220
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:03,696
No, he's not going to eat the bill.

221
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,569
Why?

222
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,265
In his house he's having
a thing like you to eat.

223
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,742
...then why will he eat the bill.
- You idiot.

224
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:15,970
Good morning grandpa.

225
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:17,871
Good morning, come.

226
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:22,010
I'm fine. I will always
be fine if you both are not around.

227
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:25,316
Get Dr. Vaidh some lassi.
- Okay grandpa.

228
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,985
How are you?
- Fine sit down.

229
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:36,862
Dr. Vaidh,
should I call you doctor or Vaidh?

230
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,896
You just call me Aryan.

231
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:45,706
Aryan good, so I have thought
a lot and decided that"

232
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,466
"Nikita should get married to you.

233
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,907
Me?

234
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,468
Do you have a problem?

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,537
Don't you like Nikita?

236
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,443
But have you asked her about this?

237
00:20:57,504 --> 00:21:00,580
She knows that my
selection cannot be wrong.

238
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,028
If you say yes then the rest of
the days of my life will go happily.

239
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:16,707
But remember one thing
don't ever hurt my Nikita.

240
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,641
Or else I'll die the same moment.

241
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:25,344
It's nothing like that grandpa, I'm
very lucky, that you think I'm capable.

242
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:30,250
But I want to get settled,
I haven't bought a house yet.

243
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,455
For this point I have proposed you.

244
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,413
I'm selfish.

245
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,055
If you had your own house, I
would have never given Nikita to you.

246
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:44,093
Suppose, if after marriage
she goes with you..

247
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,432
...then what will happen to this oldie.

248
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:53,706
And after marriage everything
is yours, isn't it?

249
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:03,919
So next week your marriage
is fixed with Nikita.

250
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,118
No.

251
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,783
Thank you, grandpa.
- Be happy son.

252
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:13,318
I love you and only you.

253
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,764
Then why didn't you
reject his proposal?

254
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,739
If I have got a chance
for our better future..

255
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:25,234
...why should loose that chance.

256
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,334
Why don't you understand?

257
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:39,788
I don't even have that much
money to buy a house for ourselves.

258
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,623
That's why you are leaving me?

259
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,495
This marriage will not long last.

260
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:51,001
...she is a heart patient
and can't fulfill my sexual needs.

261
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:58,041
On this point I will take a divorce and
I will get a good pan of the property.

262
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,299
It's just the matter of a year or two.

263
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:05,212
You are talking about a year or two,"

264
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:09,513
...you know that I can't leave
without you for a single moment.

265
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:15,483
My every moment, every breathe,
every night is just for you.

266
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,399
I love you, Aryan.
I love you.

267
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:33,378
One girl is already married,
now is your turn.

268
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:36,441
What are you thinking?

269
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,545
<i>'Zryan.
' Wan?</i>

270
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,378
Grandpa isn't it cold today?
- Why?

271
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:45,251
So where Nikita and Aryan
are there must be so cold.

272
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:50,959
Couples who go for honeymoon,
they never feel cold.

273
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:57,165
They crazy and they freak with
their hearts for ways and directions.

274
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:36,111
"With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination."

275
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:54,761
"With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination."

276
00:24:54,845 --> 00:25:03,365
"O dear, meet me somewhere
in any nook and corner."

277
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:13,341
"With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination."

278
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:59,723
"We both stay in the same lane,
but we are helpless."

279
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:09,008
"You are here, I am here,
but still there are distances here."

280
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:17,905
"Strange world.
The granduer of the world are unique."

281
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:23,001
"With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination."

282
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:12,098
"Wherever you are, I feel,
you are close to my heart here."

283
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:21,549
"I wish for your well-being.
Without you, I feel sad, here."

284
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:30,284
"Come, come.
Come and embrace me."

285
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:40,492
"With our crazy heart,
we wander every destination."

286
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,931
I'm sorry.

287
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,600
Sorry.

288
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,110
It's okay.

289
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:51,490
Marriage is not just a start of a sexual
relationship but also our soul mate.

290
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:57,763
It's not necessary to
fulfill the sexual needs.

291
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,207
If you get an attack because of this"

292
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:09,887
...so I'll do your treatment
first and then love.

293
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:16,285
I don't want to loose you Nikita,
I love you.

294
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:23,628
It's good that this date is finalized,
that's why your presence was important.

295
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,360
Now everything will be fine.

296
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,795
Hello grandpa.
- Be happy son.

297
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,765

Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

299
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,537
He is my son-in-law more than a son.

300
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:39,539
Should I make a move,
it's my pleasure.

301
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,412
Thank you Mr. Gilchrist.
- Thank you.

302
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,913
Sit son.

Hello.

- Today I'll wait.

307
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:59,123
Okay, as you wish.

308
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:01,335
Hi grandpa.

309
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:03,064
Hello grandpa.
- Hi.

310
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,934
What was the need to prepare a will?

311
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:10,482
Baby now you are married and
I want everything legally to be yours.

312
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,049
Keep this will in the locker.
- Okay.

313
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:17,018
Shall we have a game?
- Today I'm in a hurry.

314
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,679
Aryan please play, it's just one game.

315
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:22,089
Come on let's play.
- I'm mentally tired.

316
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:25,284
So physical fight.
- Come on.

317
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:30,526
Anyways after my death except
this bungalow everything is yours.

318
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,466
But if you win today's game
I'll give you the bungalow as well.

319
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,975
So what say?
- Come on Aryan one game.

320
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,408

Grandpa... Grandpa come on.

What happen, grandpa?
- What happen?

324
00:31:04,587 --> 00:31:07,036
Grandpa is cheating.
- Very bad.

325
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,997
Everything is fair in love and war.

326
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,138
Son this is not cheating,
it's teaching.

327
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,940
I'm trying to teach you
only then you'll be happy.

328
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,876
This is the only way to win.

329
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,715
Anyhow try and win the game.

330
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:24,745
I don't want.
- Please take it.

331
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:26,915
No, I don't want it.
- Have the tea.

332
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,986
Oh god I'm sorry.

333
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,619
Now this stain will not go.
- You come up the stain will go.

334
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,595
You come up the stain will go.

335
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,392
If you want you can
wash it in my quarter.

336
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,126
That's a good idea.

337
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,526
Let's go.

338
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:46,007
Okay dear now sit down.

339
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:55,342
Leave me, somebody will see.

340
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:58,823
Nobody will see.. I need you.

341
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,984
Why you never got a chance
during your honeymoon?

342
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,590
The entire night I suffer.

343
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:09,899
And I have lost my consciousness.

344
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,264
Not right now,
we'll meet during the night time.

345
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,010
Leave you, I need you come on.

346
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:24,144
I had fun by fooling that doctor.

347
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:05,914
"I don't know darling..."

348
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:19,808
"I don't know what
sorrow is, darling."

349
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:29,311
"Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy."

350
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:38,127
"I don't know what
sorrow is, darling."

351
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:47,470
"Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy."

352
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:52,334
"I don't know darling..."

353
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:20,191
"Since the time our eyes have met.."

354
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:29,210
"..I've adorned myself
with your glance."

355
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:32,335
"See, my darling."

356
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:38,285
"Since the time our eyes have met.."

357
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:47,460
"..I've adorned myself
with your glance."

358
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,656
"See, my darling."

359
00:34:52,618 --> 00:35:01,172
"When you held my wrists with love.."

360
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:10,348
"..your fingers became my bangles."

361
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:18,523
"I don't what sorrow is, darling."

362
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:28,200
"Whenever I take your name,
I'm surrounded with joy."

363
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,436
Grandpa, you'll never improve.

364
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,342
Its Aryan's phone.

365
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:45,109
- Go and give it to Aryan.
- I'll go right away.

366
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,732
Nikita.
- Your phone was ringing.

367
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,399
Thank you.

368
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,298
Let's go.
- Lets go.

369
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,749
What's the matter?

370
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:22,088
Bloody oldie cheater.

371
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,449
What happen Aryan?

372
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:31,568
He has given everylhing to
Nikita and after she dies to me.

373
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,796
Are you thinking of killing Nikita?

374
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,796
Do I want to go Jail?

375
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:44,515
If Nikita suicides or is murdered,
everybody will a finger on me.

376
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:50,951
Anyhow she should die,
but the death should be natural.

377
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:55,987
You only said that Nikita's
heart is weak right.

378
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:57,621
Yes.

379
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:07,806
That means any pain
or fear will stop her heart.

380
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,398
So?

381
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,598
So my work will be done.

382
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:17,010
You said that grandpa and
Nikita extremely love each other.

383
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:18,204
Yes.

384
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:22,150
If one person is hurt
then other feels the pain.

385
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:27,123
Yes, but I never understood anything.

386
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,983
But I have understood everything.

387
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:36,528
If the grand-daughter is hurt she
will never tell this to her grandpa.

388
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:42,200
Or else grandpa goes up.

389
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,234
Everylhing will belong to me.

390
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,677
Anyways this oldie
has done one thing good.

391
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,175
The bungalows guesthouse
gave it to you.

392
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:54,674
Oh really.

393
00:37:56,972 --> 00:38:00,184
If you want we can make
our own world of love..

394
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,653
...let it be by anybody else's death.

395
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,370
Leave me.

396
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:26,507
What?

397
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:34,154
What If I get the attack again then.

398
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:36,685
Sit down.

399
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,193
Aryan.

400
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:49,399
Nothing will happen,
maybe this is just your fear.

401
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,036
<i>Okay'</i>

402
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,496
Aryan no.

403
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:21,739
It's okay come on you feel so nice.

404
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,906
Yeah, okay.

405
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,374
No.

406
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,763
Shit.. don't touch me.

407
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:11,115
Aryan.. Aryan.. Aryan..

408
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:16,262
Aryan, listen to me.
At least have breakfast.

409
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,643
Now how are you? Your medicines.

410
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,006
Give.

411
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,551
Daughter. ls my selection wrong?

412
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,182
No.

413
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,920
See fights happen between couples.

414
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,792
If one is upset the other
can convince the other.

415
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:06,843
I think he has come,
handle him with love go ahead.

416
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,312
<i>Okay'</i>

417
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:34,904
Aryan.

418
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,235
Aryan.

419
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:06,695
What are you both doing?

420
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,671
What is this happening?
- Can't you see?

421
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,172
Are you kid?

422
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,382
Should I explain?

423
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:26,826
The thing which you could not do after
marriage, I'm doing that with her.

424
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:31,723
Marriage is finding a soul mate.

425
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,233
It's all bullshit.

426
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:42,507
Marriage is a legal certificate
to fulfill sexual needs.

427
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:50,113
But a man who has a wife like
you he has to find somebody outside.

428
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,980
I'll surely throw
you out of this house.

429
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,579
Get out.
- Move.

430
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:58,625
How many people are
you going to throw out?

431
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:04,995
You can't fulfill my needs
so should I go to prostitute?

432
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:08,861
Instead let this
stay inside the house.

433
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,234
In the society grandpa's
name will get spoilt.

434
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Come we'll go to grandpa
and talk about our divorce.

435
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,469
You want divorce, not I.

436
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,746
Should I tell him that grandpa..

437
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:27,882
...your grand-daughter
can't support me on the bed.

438
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,983
Tell Anny that she'll stay here.
Right here.

439
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:34,860
No.

440
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:40,906
Now you get lost and let
me finish what I started with, okay.

441
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,469
'Daughter, is my selection wrong?'

442
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,422
Is this the way you work.

443
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:14,025
You spoiled my important documents.

444
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,166
After half an hour I need to give
a presentation how will I do that?

445
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:21,941
Aryan I...

446
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:24,103
What I'll do?
- Aryan I...

447
00:44:24,266 --> 00:44:26,110
What are you saying?

448
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,681
I'm sorry.

449
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,342
In this meeting I was suppose
to get three crore rupees.

450
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,017
Now who will give me
the money your father"

451
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:40,257
...or your grandpa that oldie,
what money he'll give.

452
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:44,461
He wants that my entire
life I should be your servant.

453
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:47,730
Aryan, I'll prepare
coffee for you right now.

454
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:51,533
Leave it, I say. Leave it.

455
00:44:54,196 --> 00:44:56,372
Go and make your grandpa
listen to your story crying.

456
00:44:58,133 --> 00:44:59,238
What happen?

457
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:03,345
Grandpa you came,
now tell your problem to him.

458
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:06,012
Why don't you take care of yourself?

459
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:12,091
You know that if you
are hurt I also feel so hurt.

460
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:15,327
...and you just burnt your hands.

461
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:17,225
What, burnt her hand?

462
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:20,098
See grandpa.
- Oh God, show me.

463
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,168
Is there any need of ironing?

464
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:26,132
Please don't do that again.

465
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:31,477
Aryan don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

466
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:37,053
Today I have realized that
you love my daughter Nikita so much.

467
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:43,327
See Nikita didn't I tell you
that my selection cannot go wrong.

468
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,989
But I doubt you for one thing.

469
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:50,794
Doubt?

470
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:53,694
Are you still young?

471
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:55,503
Why g rand pa?

472
00:45:55,858 --> 00:46:00,005
Actually I have never seen
you going to a disco or a pub..

473
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:01,267
"That's why was asking.

474
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,708
Grandpa.

475
00:46:03,432 --> 00:46:07,009
My teenage has been in
the disco or a pub every night.

476
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:11,013
Tonight you have to take
my Nikita to a nice disco.

477
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:13,852
And that should be
happening and rocking.

478
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,618
Wow, what an idea.

479
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,687
I'll come early today in the evening,
you be ready.

480
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,696
Aryan should I wear
my pink colored top"

481
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:28,001
...because I know whenever
I wear that top you get excited.

482
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,536
I like it. I like it.

483
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:39,616
When you are in a pink
colored dress I get excited, Anny.

484
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:48,056
You be ready at night.
We'll have fun.. dancing.

485
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:51,221
So you be ready and nicely take bath.

486
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:56,460
Because I don't eat fruits without
washing them, after all I'm a doctor.

487
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:04,235
Grandpa should I take
Anny also along with us.

488
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:06,105
She'll also enjoy in the disco.

489
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,442
Why do these girls take
so much time to get ready?

490
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:20,283
Aryan pay attention over here,
or else you'll loose your queen.

491
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:23,151
If queen dead then the game is over.

492
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:26,494
And my horse is going to
end up your game in two moves.

493
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:30,662
Grandpa it's the modern
technology with space jets

494
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:36,204
Horse moves will not help you,
take this and handle your game now.

495
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:37,764
Oh, when did this happen?

496
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:40,300
Hats off to you Aryan.

497
00:47:40,397 --> 00:47:44,179
You make your moves very slowly..

498
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:48,015
...and the opposite person doesn't
even come to you that he is trapped.

499
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:51,983
Nikita.

500
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:54,317
Nikita.

501
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,561
What happen?

502
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:00,663
What happen?

503
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,270
Aryan see she burnt my dress.

504
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:14,142
So I cannot stop you people, but
at least I can reduce your excitement.

505
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:28,156
You..

506
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:29,792
What happen?

507
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:32,630
Nothing grandpa.

508
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:43,033
Aryan what should I wear now,
see she burnt your favorite dress.

509
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:52,077
Wear anything,
I like you without dress.

510
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,580
You look stunning.

511
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:26,480
What happen?

512
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:30,353
What happen?

513
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:33,417
Do you love me?

514
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,492
Of course I love you.

515
00:49:36,649 --> 00:49:38,027
Prove it.

516
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,836
I want to see a different
kind of love making.

517
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,503
What?

518
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:53,173
Have you gone mad.

519
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:55,772
At least don't make fun of my love?

520
00:49:58,404 --> 00:49:59,907
Go.

521
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,683
I can't.
- Bloody hell.

522
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:05,215
You can't.

523
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,160
No.

524
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:18,299
No.

525
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:23,306
Don't hit her, please.

526
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:26,344
<i>Okay'</i>

527
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,748
No.

528
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:50,630
You came my daughter.

529
00:50:53,526 --> 00:50:56,009
Yes grandpa.. I have come.

530
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:57,805
Did you enjoy?

531
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:07,547
Yes, I enjoyed.

532
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,315
<i>Okay'</i>

533
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:36,513
It's very late I think you should go.

534
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,333
Now go.

535
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:10,609
Today I want to make some
different type of love making.

536
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:12,510
No, please.

537
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:15,981
You are telling me no.

538
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:19,824
No, Aryan please.

539
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:22,892
No.

540
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:25,830
No.

541
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:34,303
Is it paining? I am sorry.

542
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:37,869
It pained me also?

543
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:44,315
My seniors demanded the same thing.

544
00:52:48,978 --> 00:52:51,085
Demanded the same thing.

545
00:52:54,316 --> 00:53:01,765
And I also demanded the
same thing from my juniors.

546
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:05,998
It was painful for them as well.

547
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:12,415
Later they were habituated.

548
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:19,217
Even you'll get habituated.

549
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,957
I'll do the dressing.

550
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,899
I love you.

551
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,965
I love you.

552
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:52,245
Aryan, where are you going?

553
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:57,991
I'm going out for three days, when
I'm back I need three crore rupees.

554
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:02,489
3 crore rupees?
- I said the same.

555
00:54:02,752 --> 00:54:04,825
I don't have that much money.

556
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,430
From where should I get the money?

557
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:12,509
Get it from anywhere, I need it.

558
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,608
I'm asking for three crore rupees.

559
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:21,843
Aryan, I don't have that much cash.

560
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:25,949
So sell of the farm house of grandpa.

561
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:29,923
If not that then change the will.

562
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:33,956
Transfer some pan
of the will in my name.

563
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:42,535
But Aryan, that's impossible.

564
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,283
You think you are very smart.

565
00:54:56,673 --> 00:55:00,716
Why you didn't think this
while spoiling my loan papers.

566
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:34,658
What are you thinking?

567
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,156
There is nothing to think about.

568
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:43,262
The demand that man has made
it is impossible to fulfill Nikita

569
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:47,338
Yes, he is cruel.

570
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:52,871
And if you don't fulfill
his demand he'll kill you.

571
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:58,309
And if you die, grandpa will also die.

572
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:03,119
This entire property
will belong to him.

573
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:08,387
If you talk to grandpa to fulfill your
demands, grandpa will die of shock.

574
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:13,496
If grandpa dies,
you'll die of shock.

575
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:17,095
In both the ways,
property will belong to him.

576
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:21,366
I am not concern about property,
I am concern about grandpa.

577
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:25,870
If you want I can
help you out of this.

578
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:28,804
Help?

579
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:32,307
Anny what happen to you?

580
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:34,943
Thanks to your husband.

581
00:56:35,507 --> 00:56:37,489
Yesterday night you spoilt his mood..

582
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,989
...and to improve his mood,
he spoilt my condition.

583
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:45,859
He's an animal!

584
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:51,739
He hits before making love
and even after making love.

585
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,563
What?
- Yes.

586
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,200
You have not yet reached
the stage of love..

587
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:01,307
...you won't believe
I myself want to leave him.

588
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:02,369
So why don't you go.

589
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:05,543
He'll come anywhere to find me out.

590
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:09,347
There's only one
way to get rid of him.

591
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:10,581
What?

592
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:12,653
If you are ready to help me out.

593
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:14,482
What?

594
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,591
That bastard must be calling, he'll
say that he is coming one day before.

595
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,692
Hello.
- Hello.

596
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,466
I'm coming one day before.

597
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,660
You are coming one day before.

598
00:57:57,757 --> 00:57:58,862
Yes.

599
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:00,372
One minute just hold on.

600
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:09,673
Hello.
- What about my money?

601
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:12,341
Is it done?
- No.

602
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:15,856
Aryan listen to me very carefully.

603
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,697
So this is the case okay.

604
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,300
Take this bottle and mix it.

605
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:37,901
I can't do it.

606
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,218
Oh god come on you have to,
I'm with you.

607
00:58:47,808 --> 00:58:49,517
Please I'm really scared.

608
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:51,790
There's nothing to get scared about"

609
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:56,062
...you just need to give
him a good reason and trap him..

610
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,966
...and then later
try and make him drink.

611
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:04,641
After that whatever
is to be done it's by me.

612
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:07,705
Grandpa..
- He has come.

613
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:10,243
Grandpa.

614
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,544
Grandpa, how are you? I missed you.

615
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,912
He has come liar.

616
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,718

"We could be happy tonight."

"You've made my life so beautiful."

626
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:05,959
"I can never ever let you go."

627
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,732
"Just hold. Just hold me tight."

628
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,362
"Hold me tight."

"O Charming one!"

639

"You have broken the rope of love.."

640
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:42,730
"..with which my eyes
had tied the dreams."

641
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:56,573
"You have broken the rope of love.."

01:01:56,766 --> 01:02:01,220
"..with which my eyes

"What son of game is this,

"The lamp is dancing.
While the flame is crying."

645
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:14,697
"Wherever it goes, cries or sings."

01:05:56,342 --> 01:05:58,415
What have you done?

671
01:06:02,749 --> 01:06:06,256
Silence, go!

672
01:06:09,556 --> 01:06:13,667
Go, you go and get a rope.

673
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:29,051
What happen Nikita?

674
01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:32,959
Nothing grandpa,
there's a horror film on the TV.

675
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,091
Put some other channel.

676
01:06:36,115 --> 01:06:37,654
Okay grandpa.

677
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:53,581
What have you done, you killed her?

678
01:06:53,635 --> 01:07:00,719
I did not kill her, I can't kill her.

679
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:07,625
She attacked me.

680
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:15,504
And for self defence, I killed her.

681
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:21,243
But I never killed her alone..

682
01:07:21,963 --> 01:07:26,178
...this scarf is your right.

683
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:29,244
So?

684
01:07:29,404 --> 01:07:34,484
You must be having
your finger prints on it.

685
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:40,586
I killed her?

686
01:07:40,748 --> 01:07:44,791
Yes, we both together killed her.

687
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:46,734
No..

688
01:07:47,055 --> 01:07:51,975
But anyways you are very innocent.

689
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:54,869
This was just an incident.

690
01:07:56,331 --> 01:08:00,842
You are innocent
and I'm also innocent.

691
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,378
No.
- I'm also innocent.

692
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:05,483
No.

693
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:11,790
You don't know Nikita
that I love you so much.

694
01:08:12,348 --> 01:08:14,626
I love you.

695
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:23,108
And this bitch she
fooled me against you.

696
01:08:24,693 --> 01:08:32,985
I have always loved you.

697
01:08:36,538 --> 01:08:40,115
She fooled me against you.

698
01:08:40,476 --> 01:08:45,659
She black mailed me
for the previous things.

699
01:08:46,014 --> 01:08:48,122
She black mailed me.

700
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:53,322
I didn't want to.. but still
I had to have sex with her.

701
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:11,122
Nikita" God may delay,
but will never disappoint you.

702
01:09:12,175 --> 01:09:19,532
I don't want anything,
my problem is solved.

703
01:09:19,582 --> 01:09:24,195
I don't need money.
I don't need your money.

704
01:09:25,822 --> 01:09:33,578
Come, we both will dig
her body somewhere. Yes.

705
01:09:33,763 --> 01:09:36,303
Come.

706
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,807
No. No.

707
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:41,751
No, I won't do this.

708
01:09:42,104 --> 01:09:44,451
You have to support me..

709
01:09:44,507 --> 01:09:48,688
...or else everybody will come
to know that we both killed her.

710
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:52,489
And then police will
come they will arrest us.

711
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:57,468
Grandpa will get an attack,
he will die.

712
01:09:57,721 --> 01:10:01,731
No, this cannot happen, not grandpa.

713
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:05,970
No, Aryan.
- I also don't want this.

714
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:09,541

Every drop of my blood

You don't believe

Then see.

721
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:40,074

01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:23,951
Aryan.. this"

731
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:29,629
Nothing will happen Nikita,
you don't worry at all.

732
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:33,359
And don't let this know to anybody.
Keep this in your mind.

733
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:36,664
Now go and get the car.

734
01:11:37,055 --> 01:11:38,969
Go fast I'll manage
everything go fast.

735
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:48,544

736
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,719
You wait here for a minute
I'll get my cell phone.

737
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:59,258
Here. No. You wait here,
I'll get the cell phone.

738
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:00,518
It's okay.

739
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:16,770
Stop.

740
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:23,180
Police.

741
01:12:24,337 --> 01:12:25,817
Do you have a jack with you?

742
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:28,209
No we don't have it.
- We have it.

743
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:41,496
This bag is very heavy,
what's there in it?

744
01:12:42,888 --> 01:12:44,130
Books.

745
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:48,471
Thank you,
I'll give the jack to you later.

746
01:12:48,695 --> 01:12:51,268
Yes, give to us later okay.

747
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,049
It's okay.

748
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:43,158
What happen?

749
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,629
What happen?

750
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,696
I saw a nightmare.

751
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:59,538
Anny is with a scarf coming behind me.

752
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:03,312
She wanted to kill me Aryan.

753
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:08,413
Nikita control yourself.

754
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:13,855
Forget her. She is dead.

755
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:18,063
We both have killed her together,
she is past tense.

756
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:28,174
Aryan, whatever we did was wrong.

757
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:31,642
With wrong people if we do
wrong things there harm in that.

758
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:35,141
And whatever I did
was to save my house.

759
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:37,016
But..

760
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:45,326
I said forget this incident,
now go to sleep.

761
01:14:50,284 --> 01:14:52,095
Come on.

762
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:00,899
Anny has not come yet.

763
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:03,574
Now she'll never come.
- What?

764
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,114
Nikita means that she
went home yesterday night.

765
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:11,813
Why did she go, without meeting me?

766
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:14,355
One phone call had come..

767
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,482
...It seems that there is
somebody serious at her place.

768
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,790
Who is serious?

769
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,061
Her father is serious.

770
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,526
Her father passed
away three years back.

771
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,557
So may be her mom..

772
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:31,808
...actually in a hurry she
forgot to tell us, isn't it Nikita?

773
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,542
Yes, she was in a hurry.
- Is she going to come back?

774
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:40,143
People who go, they never come back.
- What?

775
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,842
She has taken an advance..

776
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:46,751
...and people who work and take
the advance they never come back.

777
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,158
Excuse me grandpa.

778
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,935
What was the need of telling
that she will not come back?

779
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:05,671
Aryan, I'm sorry.
I cannot lie any more.

780
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:10,578
I can't support you for this.

781
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,510
We'll go and tell the
police that whatever happen..

782
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,615
...was just for our self defence.

783
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,054
And the police will agree to you.

784
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,789
And if they ask where
is the dead body then?

785
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,916
So we'll say that...

786
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:29,197
We both have thrown the body in water,
so that police should not come to know.

787
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,736
Nikki you have done two crimes..

788
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:37,341
...one is a murder and the second is
hide the proof by deforcing the body.

789
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:39,342
So what should I do, tell me.

790
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:48,149
I'm there, don't worry.

791
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:02,093
Hi Aryan.
- Hi sweetheart, what are you doing?

792
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:04,156

Okay tell me why did you call?

795
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:10,138

796
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,570
You just left right from here.

797
01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:15,443
But who will explain this heart.

798
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,303

799
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,282
Come on give me a kiss fast.

800
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,621

I'm calling you from
spot nursing beauro.

810
01:18:01,512 --> 01:18:05,293
Anny is not receiving
the phone please call her.

811
01:18:06,717 --> 01:18:13,506
She is not here,
maybe she gone to her family.

812
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:16,441
But there is nobody in her family.

813
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:19,670
So she must have gone
to a different place.

814
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,977
Yesterday itself she took a job
transfer by giving and application.

815
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,707

with your assignment.

816

819
01:18:39,984 --> 01:18:43,994
Hello, this is so good my love,
it seems that I'm getting lucky.

820
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:47,901
Aryan, there was a call
from nurse association"

821
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:50,338
...and they were asking for Anny.

822
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:52,399
Did you do any mistake while talking?

823
01:18:52,496 --> 01:18:55,070
No, but they said they
will phone up again..

824
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,773
...and maybe they

825
01:18:56,836 --> 01:19:01,220
If they call again say wrong number
and disconnect the line, understood.

826
01:19:01,306 --> 01:19:03,481
Yes.

827
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:10,961
Why are you learning kick boxing?

828
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:14,527
May be it will help
me sometime in my life.

829
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:20,839
Should I ask you one thing,
why do you girls attract men..

830
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:26,945
...more by their beauty
and not by their brains?

831
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:33,416
Because we know that
boys are foolish not blind.

832
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:36,582
You naughty girl.

833
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:15,362
"The story of the heart
is of two words."

834
01:20:15,682 --> 01:20:21,330
"Either it is love or youth."

835
01:20:21,787 --> 01:20:27,334
"The story of the heart
is of two words."

836
01:20:27,593 --> 01:20:33,277
"Either it is love or youth."

837
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:45,394
"The story of the heart
is of two words."

838
01:20:45,444 --> 01:20:51,367
"Either it is love or youth."

839
01:21:16,977 --> 01:21:23,058
"Don't ask me the meaning
of the heart's feelings."

840
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:28,800
"Don't ask me anything now."

841
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:34,944
"Don't ask me the meaning
of the heart's feelings."

842
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:40,712
"Don't ask me anything now."

843
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:54,327
"The one who the world is crazy for."

844
01:21:54,682 --> 01:22:00,297
"Either it is love or youth."

845
01:22:14,802 --> 01:22:17,718
Wasn't it fun?
- Life of two moments.

846
01:22:17,805 --> 01:22:19,411
Is it?

847
01:22:23,178 --> 01:22:25,752
It was cool very cool.

848
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:28,755
Hi grandpa.
- Hi.

849
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:30,558
Nikki somebody has
left a parcel for you.

850
01:22:30,618 --> 01:22:32,531
For me.
- Yes.

851
01:22:34,622 --> 01:22:36,661
It's a VCD.
- Which film is it?

852
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:39,971
I think it must be
somebody's demo VCD.

853
01:22:40,328 --> 01:22:42,276
Will you drop me till my room?

854
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:44,710

01:22:52,273 --> 01:22:55,052
Come grandpa lets go.

857
01:23:05,086 --> 01:23:06,567
Fast.

858
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:08,661
Close this.

859
01:23:10,692 --> 01:23:14,166
Nikita"
- Yes, take this.

860
01:23:15,964 --> 01:23:20,075
Carefully. Hurry up.

861
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:22,617
Yes, I'm doing it.
- Nikita.

862
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,251
Pull it.
- Aryan.

863
01:23:33,382 --> 01:23:35,625
Push it harder.

864
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:43,566
Aryan.
- Nikita, what happen?

865
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:45,766
Nikita, what happen?

866
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:50,105
Aryan, see that.

867
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,918
- Cool, cool.
- No, it is not cool.

868
01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:01,547
Come on.

869
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:05,324
Till when are we
going to hide the truth.

870
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:09,933
Except we two there is a
third person who knows the truth.

871
01:24:11,253 --> 01:24:13,531
But instead of sending
this VCD to police..

872
01:24:13,622 --> 01:24:15,764
...why did that person has
sent this to us, what does that mean?

873
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:20,410
May be blackmailing.

874
01:24:21,363 --> 01:24:23,710
So that person by itself will come.

875
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,113
Till that time we will be quite.

876
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,890
Nikita, you should tomorrow
itself get a checkup done..

877
01:24:34,077 --> 01:24:35,923
...and I want you complete check up.

878
01:24:36,013 --> 01:24:38,894
I want to cure your disease.

879
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:47,467
When is test report coming?

880
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,396
Today evening it is going to come.

881
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,906
What is the need of a report.

882
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:53,705
...I'm telling you that
you are absolutely all right.

883
01:24:53,764 --> 01:24:57,806
Ya.. really, then we have a reason,
we should celebrate.

884
01:24:58,068 --> 01:25:00,813
So we'll go to the disco today.
- Yes.

885
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:05,579
Should I wear the pink dress?
Your favorite.

886
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:11,857
Thank you, you have given
a new life to my Nikita.

887
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:18,463
Or else who would marry
such a girl without any sex life.

888
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:22,001
There is not just
one meaning of marriage.

889
01:25:22,692 --> 01:25:25,505
When did you come to
know about Nikita's disease?

890
01:25:26,331 --> 01:25:29,474
During her childhood she use
to stay in India with her parents.

891
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,580
...and she use to get
attacks at that time as well.

892
01:25:33,638 --> 01:25:35,916
Happiness, sadness or angry.

893
01:25:37,242 --> 01:25:40,384
She used to get attack if she
used to get excited about anything.

894
01:25:41,546 --> 01:25:44,189
Her parents died in an accident.

895
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:47,496
Then she came here.

896
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:51,435
That time all of a sudden we came to
know that there is a hole in her heart.

897
01:25:52,557 --> 01:25:54,469
So when did you start her treatment?

898
01:25:54,793 --> 01:25:59,007
We did her treatment many times
but every time it was unsuccessful.

899
01:25:59,665 --> 01:26:02,774
Two months back we got
a surgery done in America.

900
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:04,914
It was successful.

901
01:26:05,404 --> 01:26:09,686
Doctor said that she needs to be kept
under observation for three month.

902
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,317
Then what happen?

903
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:15,361
Then what, you came into our life's..

904
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:17,693
...and I didn't want to loose you.

905
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:22,965
And that why going against
the doctor I married her to you.

906
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:24,564
Thanks.

907
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:26,967
Just take care of her for few days.

908
01:26:27,726 --> 01:26:30,106
Make sure she does not
gets excite for anything.

909
01:26:30,195 --> 01:26:33,442
Aryan.. Aryan..
- I'll go and check.

910
01:26:37,201 --> 01:26:39,684
Nikita" Nikita"

911
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:44,883
Nikita why did you burn this?

912
01:26:46,145 --> 01:26:49,356
I did not burn this,
Aryan I was inside.

913
01:26:49,415 --> 01:26:53,629
I did not burn this, this must be...

914
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:55,827
So who did this?

915
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,598
She only must have done it.

916
01:26:58,691 --> 01:27:00,103
Who?

917
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:02,807
Anny, did this.

918
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:04,101
She is already dead.

919
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:08,445
But Aryan her spirit must be here,
because she was murdered.

920
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,641
But what's her connection
with your dress?

921
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:17,489
Because I also had burnt her dress,
so she did it today...

922
01:27:18,444 --> 01:27:21,223
My love this is just a coincidence.

923
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:26,623
Forget everything and wear any dress.

924
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,935
What should I wear now? Your
favorite color dress is burnt now.

925
01:27:31,257 --> 01:27:37,112
You look great in blue, better in red,
and best in bed.

926
01:28:03,723 --> 01:28:05,727
What happen darling
why did you stop the car?

927
01:28:06,025 --> 01:28:08,406
I think the tyre is punctured,
let me check.

928
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:09,566
<i>Okay'</i>

929
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:24,688
What happen?

930
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:27,223
What happen?

931
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:30,153
That...

932
01:28:30,618 --> 01:28:32,622
Now don't tell this
again that you saw Anny.

933
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:36,064
Aryan, I am telling you...

934
01:28:38,424 --> 01:28:42,707
She was Anny.
- Where?

935
01:28:42,763 --> 01:28:47,717
Aryan she was on the back seat.
- Dear.

936
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:51,275
Baby, there's nobody there.
What nonsense, it's okay..

937
01:28:51,504 --> 01:28:56,618
...It's okay, I'm telling you,
cool down, nobody there.

938
01:28:57,945 --> 01:28:59,483
I'll come right now.

939
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:28,313
Should I ask one thing?

940
01:29:29,777 --> 01:29:30,917
Okay ask.

941
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:32,657
You won't get angry.

942
01:29:34,948 --> 01:29:36,224
No.

943
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:41,398
We can see the spirits
only during the night time?

944
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:44,972
This spirit talks are all bullshit.

945
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:48,604
But Anny is always seen in the night.

946
01:29:48,663 --> 01:29:49,835
She is dead.

947
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:55,242
Sorry.

948
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:59,719
Look you are an educated girl.

949
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,182
You should understand one thing"

950
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:05,156
"that there is no spiritual
power and its all imagination.

951
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:08,196
But Aryan I saw Anny from my own eyes.

952
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:12,258
So when I came where did she go?

953
01:30:12,554 --> 01:30:15,469
She vanished, she is a spirit
she can go anywhere she wants.

954
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,237
It's not their house..

955
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:21,275
...whenever they want
they come and go, idiot.

956
01:30:21,829 --> 01:30:25,336
If she is seen again then?

957
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:27,981
Catch her.

958
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:34,119
But to catch her I have to touch
her and If I touch her I'll be dead.

959
01:30:34,176 --> 01:30:35,281
Shut up!

960
01:30:36,846 --> 01:30:41,526
Grandpa said this.

961
01:30:42,084 --> 01:30:49,738
From today onwards put one thing
in your mind, heart that is Aryan.

962
01:30:50,493 --> 01:30:55,572
After that you'll
see only me everywhere.

963
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:58,845
<i>Okay-
_ Okay</i>

964
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:01,982
My baby.

965
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:09,791
Grandpa, are spirits very powerful?
- Yes.

966
01:31:13,282 --> 01:31:16,458
So they stay at one place
or they can go anywhere?

967
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,501
Who can stop them?

968
01:31:20,623 --> 01:31:23,630
Then tell me one thing
that they attack people..

969
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:27,233
...with whom they want
to take revenge or anybody.

970
01:31:27,497 --> 01:31:29,409
With whom they want to take revenge..

971
01:31:29,498 --> 01:31:31,104
...but dear why are you
asking all these things?

972
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:34,176
Just like that.

973
01:31:36,072 --> 01:31:39,784
Why is there so much qaos,
dear see what's happening?

974
01:31:40,543 --> 01:31:42,046
I'll see and come.
- Okay.

975
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:27,032
Excuse me.

976
01:32:28,658 --> 01:32:29,831
You.

977
01:32:30,226 --> 01:32:33,233
Her dead body is not here.
- Who's?

978
01:32:33,464 --> 01:32:34,808
The person you are trying to find out.

979
01:32:35,398 --> 01:32:37,608
Who told you that
I'm searching somebody?

980
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:41,850
In so much crowd nobody else,
but only you have seen that dead body.

981
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:45,451
Actually I..
- Is anybody is missing?

982
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:47,285
Yes.
- Who is that?

983
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,021
My nurse.
- From how many days?

984
01:32:50,847 --> 01:32:54,424
Only from last 15 days.
- Did you file a missing report?

985
01:32:55,252 --> 01:32:56,995
Not right now because...
- Why not?

986
01:32:57,054 --> 01:33:00,129
I thought she'll come
back early that why...

987
01:33:00,224 --> 01:33:02,137
Where she has gone
did you find out there?

988
01:33:02,192 --> 01:33:04,196
No, I don't have the number.

989
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:08,038
But who are you to
ask me all these questions?

990
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:09,977
Inspector Khan, Kadar Khan.

991
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,820
Because this case is under me,
where do you stay?

992
01:33:16,073 --> 01:33:18,055
Long street, bungalow no. 5.

993
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:19,681
I'll call you when required.

994
01:33:20,277 --> 01:33:21,382
<i>Okay'</i>

995
01:33:37,428 --> 01:33:38,464
Aryan..

996
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:27,353
You.

997
01:34:29,181 --> 01:34:31,060
So late in the night
what are you doing here.

998
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:33,862
And now don't tell
me that you saw Anny.

999
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,002
But what are you doing
so late night here?

1000
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:43,305
Was not getting sleep
so to smoke I came downstairs.

1001
01:34:44,196 --> 01:34:49,241
If I would smoke there it
would be a problem for you, let's go.

1002
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:59,657
Sorry I came without calling you up.

1003
01:35:00,146 --> 01:35:02,720
As I did not have your number.

1004
01:35:04,516 --> 01:35:07,125
Anyways is this your card,
it yours right.

1005
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,062
So.

1006
01:35:09,155 --> 01:35:12,105
Your name and address
is written on this.

1007
01:35:12,992 --> 01:35:15,975
That's why the stuff
in the bag has to be yours.

1008
01:35:16,362 --> 01:35:17,638
Which stuff?

1009
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,942
Come with me I'll show you.

1010
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:32,855
Things inside this
bag have to be yours.

1011
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:35,960
Check and see.

1012
01:35:36,582 --> 01:35:37,995
Go check.

1013
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:45,535
Open it.

1014
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:08,494
Inspector what kind of joke is this?
- I finding for clues.

1015
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:11,461
And from your house nurse is missing.

1016
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,764
And there was a suitcase near
the lake with a dead body of a lady.

1017
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:21,872
So?
- That's it I'm leaving.

1018
01:36:23,864 --> 01:36:26,643
Thanks. I took your
jack five-six days before.

1019
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,446
Anyways your nurse is also
missing from past five-six days.

1020
01:36:36,076 --> 01:36:37,318
Okay bye.

1021
01:36:44,619 --> 01:36:47,967
Grandpa, the season
has changed all of a sudden.

1022
01:36:48,222 --> 01:36:50,602
Yes, the seasons as
well as people change.

1023
01:36:51,191 --> 01:36:53,002
Where is Nikita?
- She is inside.

1024
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:54,664
Inside, okay I'll come.

1025
01:36:59,032 --> 01:37:00,035
Nikita.

1026
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:05,648
Grandpa,
the atmosphere is so good today.

1027
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,120
If you get wet in
the rain you'll fall ill.

1028
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:10,054
Still you are acting like a kid.

1029
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,889
You are here and Aryan
went to search you inside.

1030
01:37:12,948 --> 01:37:14,519
<i>Okay'</i>

1031
01:37:15,016 --> 01:37:18,363
Aryan..
- This kids are too much.

1032
01:37:20,688 --> 01:37:23,934
Nikita.
- I'm here. What happen?

1033
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:26,072
So the lady inside
the room who is she?

1034
01:37:27,996 --> 01:37:34,248
See Aryan didn't I tell you
that one day you'll also see Anny.

1035
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:40,922
No Aryan lets go from here,
we'll leave this house.

1036
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:43,289
Please, we'll leave this house.

1037
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:44,722
Please Aryan.

1038
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,730
What will we say
to people and grandpa?

1039
01:37:47,816 --> 01:37:52,496
Tell anything to grandpa.
What should I tell you Aryan?

1040
01:37:52,587 --> 01:37:55,696
She will kill me,
she is not going to leave me..

1041
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:58,831
...and I'm really scared please.
I'm really scared.

1042
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,976
Nikita.
- I'm really scared please.

1043
01:38:02,697 --> 01:38:06,478
Aryan please,
I want to live and don't want to die.

1044
01:38:06,567 --> 01:38:09,073
Aryan, I want to live.

1045
01:38:10,138 --> 01:38:12,279
Aryan, I want to live.
- No, don't worry Nikita.

1046
01:38:13,209 --> 01:38:17,662
Hello. What are you talking about,
who are you?

1047
01:38:22,917 --> 01:38:25,730
Hold this. Everything will be fine

1048
01:38:28,723 --> 01:38:32,264
Now go off to sleep,
I have given grandpa the tablet.

1049
01:38:32,594 --> 01:38:38,073
Oh god, I already gave him the
sleeping tablet and you gave it again.

1050
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,814
Don't worry, no problem.
Grandpa will sleep for one more hour.

1051
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:48,488
One minute.

1052
01:38:50,379 --> 01:38:56,063
Hello, yes this is doctor Aryan.

1053
01:38:59,356 --> 01:39:00,995
I can't come this time.

1054
01:39:02,758 --> 01:39:04,968
I told you, I can't come this time.

1055
01:39:08,831 --> 01:39:10,607
What should I do if
there is an emergency?

1056
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,308
Hold on.

1057
01:39:12,668 --> 01:39:17,052
Nikita there is an emergency
case I'll be back soon.

1058
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:18,744

1059
01:39:18,841 --> 01:39:21,518
...I won't let you go it's too
late now and please don't go Aryan.

1060
01:39:21,578 --> 01:39:24,995
It's just a matter of one hour.

1061
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:26,423
Again the same thing.

1062
01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:30,633
Look Aryan you also saw her right,

1063
01:39:31,521 --> 01:39:33,433
I'm telling you nothing will happen..

1064
01:39:34,224 --> 01:39:36,570
...It's the matter of somebodies life.

1065
01:39:36,759 --> 01:39:38,741
She will kill me.

1066
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:44,247
Okay do one thing,

1067
01:39:44,301 --> 01:39:46,840
...and when I'm back
you can open the door.

1068
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,241

1069
01:39:49,772 --> 01:39:55,228
Hello, yes I'm about to reach.
Nikita let me go.

1070
01:40:01,451 --> 01:40:05,495
Okay then you leave, but please

1071
01:40:06,322 --> 01:40:08,601
Please keep calling

1072
01:40:58,877 --> 01:41:02,828
Hello.

1076
01:41:13,424 --> 01:41:14,666
Bye.

1077
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,879
Hello.

1078
01:41:24,936 --> 01:41:27,111

01:41:27,772 --> 01:41:29,617
We have got some
important information"

1080
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:31,120
...and it is important
for us to come there right now.

1081
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,657
Sir you cannot come

1082
01:41:33,711 --> 01:41:35,124
...because my husband is not at home.
- It's an emergency.

1083
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:37,526
Anything can happen I need to talk

01:41:40,252 --> 01:41:44,534
Please wait for me, nothing doing.
Don't move.

1086
01:41:44,957 --> 01:41:47,269
Hello.. hello.

1087
01:41:50,663 --> 01:41:53,372
The phone got disconnected.
Now what?

1088
01:41:57,937 --> 01:42:00,385
Glass. Where is the glass?

1089
01:42:04,075 --> 01:42:05,557
Where is the glass?

1090
01:42:08,813 --> 01:42:12,162
Aryan?
- Who Aryan, it's me.

1091
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,797
Who is speaking?
- Anny.

1092
01:42:15,253 --> 01:42:18,294
Anny.
- Keep the door open I'm coming.

1093
01:42:21,626 --> 01:42:23,336
Have I gone mad.

1094
01:42:26,199 --> 01:42:28,647
No. No.

1095
01:42:32,204 --> 01:42:33,947
I'll switch off the phone.

1096
01:42:37,009 --> 01:42:39,355
Aryan.

1097
01:42:41,214 --> 01:42:43,092
Aryan.
- Who Aryan?

1098
01:42:43,182 --> 01:42:46,793
Keep the door open I'm coming.

1099
01:43:07,272 --> 01:43:09,016
Why is she not answering the phone?

1100
01:43:14,715 --> 01:43:16,320
Oh my god what happen?

1101
01:43:38,604 --> 01:43:39,914
Light.

1102
01:43:41,608 --> 01:43:43,179
Oh god!

1103
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:46,553
There is no electricity.

1104
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:24,734
No, I'll die Anny, please
leave me and don't come near me.

1105
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:26,895
Please Anny I'll die.

1106
01:49:28,927 --> 01:49:32,571
No, please leave me.

1107
01:49:35,266 --> 01:49:38,740
No, I'll die.

1108
01:49:39,804 --> 01:49:42,845
No, I'll die.

1109
01:49:43,775 --> 01:49:45,654
No. No.

1110
01:50:21,013 --> 01:50:22,722
Is she dead?
- Yes.

1111
01:50:25,084 --> 01:50:26,223
First check.

1112
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:38,972
Yes she is gone up, dead bitch.

1113
01:50:44,737 --> 01:50:46,685
Thing happened as I planned.

1114
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:51,752
You did an excellent job my spirit.

1115
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:54,225
You did an excellent job.

1116
01:50:54,313 --> 01:50:57,925
That means you never did
any mistake by leaving me alive.

1117
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:05,340
Trying double cross me.

1118
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:07,865
Don't kill me.

1119
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:09,932
Why shouldn't I kill you?

1120
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,874
May be I can be of your some help.

1121
01:51:12,299 --> 01:51:14,007
Of what work you'll be for me?

1122
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:17,582
See Aryan,
you'll not get anything by killing..

1123
01:51:17,805 --> 01:51:19,479
...but Nikita's death
will surely help you.

1124
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:25,057
Okay so you'll do
whatever I'll tell you.

1125
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:26,956
Yes.

1126
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:29,987
From today onwards
I'll play a new game.

1127
01:51:30,317 --> 01:51:33,825
If you show any smartness
then you had it, understood.

1128
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,097
No.

1129
01:51:37,623 --> 01:51:39,867
And you also did the
same thing what I said.

1130
01:51:40,594 --> 01:51:44,273
After all the heart patient is
dead because of you a natural death.

1131
01:51:47,067 --> 01:51:53,423
Now everything is mine.

1132
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:55,750
But what will happen to grandpa?

1133
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,394
He will die with this news.

1134
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:07,327
If he does not die I'll kill him
by my master plan how Nikita died..

1135
01:52:07,688 --> 01:52:09,169
...I will kill him.

1136
01:52:10,323 --> 01:52:11,668
Good.

1137
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,731
What next?

1138
01:52:15,796 --> 01:52:20,443
Wrong question,
not what next, who next?

1139
01:52:20,701 --> 01:52:21,841
What do you mean?

1140
01:52:22,036 --> 01:52:26,182
It means she is dead
and behind her who will go.

1141
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:31,850
You'll go, dear.

1142
01:52:35,516 --> 01:52:39,765
When you are alive you helped
me a lot, now die and show me.

1143
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:42,301
But why?

1144
01:52:44,959 --> 01:52:53,318
Because I'm a doctor and I
do operations, I don't leave any clue.

1145
01:52:53,367 --> 01:53:01,818
I knew it selfish men
like you will never change.

1146
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:07,018
That's why I got the police with me.

1147
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:08,584
You did a very good thing.

1148
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:15,630
Now they'll their selves see what have
you done for taking your revenge..

1149
01:53:16,724 --> 01:53:18,933
...first you had spread
a rumour that you are missing..

1150
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:26,681
...and now you came
here and killed Nikita.

1151
01:53:28,638 --> 01:53:33,057
You killed Nikita,
right then, I came here.

1152
01:53:34,843 --> 01:53:37,417
I tried to stop you..

1153
01:53:41,384 --> 01:53:46,929
You counter attacked me and
got killed doing self-defense.

1154
01:54:00,169 --> 01:54:01,514
You did not die?

1155
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:06,547
No, what you thought
that I'm a heart patient..

1156
01:54:06,643 --> 01:54:09,559
...and you'll torture me,
scare me and I'll die.

1157
01:54:10,178 --> 01:54:12,161
So you are not a heart patient?

1158
01:54:12,447 --> 01:54:15,864
Yes I'm, but when a
doctor becomes a villain..

1159
01:54:16,084 --> 01:54:18,066
...then the nurse has to do her work.

1160
01:54:23,258 --> 01:54:29,307
After knowing your dirty
nature she being you wife..

1161
01:54:29,365 --> 01:54:32,406
...was helping you and
hiding your mistakes.

1162
01:54:32,868 --> 01:54:37,619
...and leaving me alive
you did a very big mistake.

1163
01:54:39,475 --> 01:54:44,988
Anny spoilt your game right, after
her death she met me on the third day.

1164
01:54:48,584 --> 01:54:50,862
'My cell phone.
- I'll get you phone.'

1165
01:54:54,057 --> 01:54:56,130
Come out Anny.

1166
01:54:58,328 --> 01:55:00,139
And she told me truth.

1167
01:55:00,397 --> 01:55:02,845
If Anny wouldn't have
told me the truth..

1168
01:55:02,899 --> 01:55:06,372
...then you would have
succeeded in your plan.

1169
01:55:08,737 --> 01:55:12,849
You thought that you
are playing with both of us.

1170
01:55:16,746 --> 01:55:19,923
But the fact is that
we both are playing with you.

1171
01:55:21,718 --> 01:55:24,702
But you have a misunderstanding.

1172
01:55:25,156 --> 01:55:30,133
Misunderstanding,
yes come on tell me Aryan now..

1173
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:37,983
...which drop of your blood
says that I love you Nikita"

1174
01:55:38,235 --> 01:55:41,583
"get up and say.

1175
01:55:41,638 --> 01:55:45,180
Think if grandpa comes
to know about this.

1176
01:55:45,276 --> 01:55:47,349
Grandpa will not come
to know about anything".

1177
01:55:47,411 --> 01:55:50,122
...he will not get any shock.

1178
01:55:50,180 --> 01:55:53,426
And the drama which you
are doing its been getting"

1179
01:55:53,483 --> 01:55:56,400
"shot by five cameras
do you understand?

1180
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:01,665
Grandpa will be very
happy by seeing this scene.

1181
01:56:01,858 --> 01:56:04,432
Come on now start getting
ready for going to the jail.

1182
01:56:08,398 --> 01:56:10,573
If you are saved then...

1183
01:56:11,502 --> 01:56:13,005
No.

1184
01:56:13,805 --> 01:56:16,914
Come kill me.

1185
01:56:32,224 --> 01:56:35,469
Backstabbed me? Not fair.

1186
01:56:42,767 --> 01:56:49,157
Everything is fair in love and war.

1187
01:56:49,207 --> 01:56:50,744
Know about this war.

1188
01:57:04,589 --> 01:57:05,933
Come.

1189
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,066
Grandpa.

1190
01:57:10,162 --> 01:57:12,475
No dear silence.

1191
01:57:20,205 --> 01:57:23,348
Grandpa.
- Come dear.

1192
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:26,983
Don't worry now nothing will happen.

1193
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:59,414
See that.

1194
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:10,531
Grandpa.

1195
01:58:13,593 --> 01:58:16,235
Now what again got an attack?

1196
01:58:16,295 --> 01:58:19,472
After playing such a hot
song if two girls take bath"

1197
01:58:19,531 --> 01:58:21,274
...then anybody will get an attack.

1198
01:58:21,367 --> 01:58:23,508
So should play any old song.

1199
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:25,073
Yes.

1200
01:58:25,271 --> 01:58:29,052
Grandpa's favorite..
or else play that.

1201
01:58:29,108 --> 01:58:30,087
That one.

1202
01:58:30,176 --> 01:58:31,247
Yeah.

1203
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:39,704
"I'm writing a story
of my restless heart."

1204
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:44,763
"With the colors of
your wait in my eyes."

1205
01:58:45,024 --> 01:58:50,001
Wow what an amazing song she has sung,
and she looked fabulous.

1206
01:58:50,096 --> 01:58:52,875
Yes grandpa, she had become so fat.

1207
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:57,113
So what still she was good that time.

1208
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:03,288
"I'm writing a story."

1209
01:59:13,386 --> 01:59:21,677
"When you are not around,
there's no fun in Spring season."

1210
01:59:27,501 --> 01:59:35,758
"When you are not around,
there's no fun in Spring season."

1211
01:59:36,008 --> 01:59:44,733
"I wish not to see the Spring season."

1212
01:59:44,819 --> 01:59:49,967
"With the colors of
your wait in my eyes."

1213
01:59:50,223 --> 01:59:53,673
"I'm writing a story."

1214
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:23,976
"I have the luxuries of the world."

1215
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:38,122
"I have the luxuries of the world."

1216
02:00:38,206 --> 02:00:44,686
"But the destiny has.."
