1
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,875
[...O, jasmine scented breeze, come...]

2
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:06,333
[...tell me the tale of the
almighty one's gift...]

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,875
[...Moons ago, Sulekha Beevi turned pink...]

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,541
[...as she blushed with a coy smile...]

5
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,041
Mulla!

6
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,708
Come, let's go!

7
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:36,958
It's tied securely, right?

8
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,166
Yeah.

9
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,291
Let's go.

10
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,041
Yeah, hop on.

11
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,416
Come on, push!

12
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,458
What now?

13
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,208
I've told you not to come asking for
the kids, right?

14
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,166
Look at you, tattered clothes
and what not?

15
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,333
I better not see you around here
again.

16
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,708
You're nothing but a bad influence
on them.

17
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,291
How dare you walk off
when I'm talking?

18
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,833
- Been trying to act smart, huh, whimp?
- Get off me!

19
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,208
Here's how you ought to dress up.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,041
Run, run!

21
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,041
Stop dreaming and help me.

22
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,541
Take that and catch some fish.

23
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,208
You won't have to do this much longer.

24
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,833
Your aunt will come and take you with her.

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,166
I've become a burden for you, haven't I?

26
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,166
Nice try.

27
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,791
You pull this trick every time she comes.

28
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,041
Only a woman can take care
of you at this age.

29
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,791
I want to get out of here.

30
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,541
I want to find my big brother.

31
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:38,666
You can't be like him just by
wearing his clothes.

32
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,583
Did he ever bother to check on you?

33
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,708
What does he think?

34
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,916
That I'll take care of you forever?

35
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,833
He didn't even come when your mother died.
- That's because no one informed him.

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,458
He won't be found because
he doesn't want to be.

37
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958
Everyone changes on reaching the mainland.

38
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,083
Everyone.

39
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,416
Is he in Bombay?

40
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,708
I don't know, nor do I care.

41
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,083
Are all the stories about him true?

42
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,166
Everyone loves a good fairytale, don't they?

43
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,166
He was a smart man, like your father.

44
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,333
Everyone used to love watching him
perform 'kuthu ratheeb.'

45
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,291
Then, why did he leave?

46
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,916
Was it Aamina's curse?

47
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,541
I don't know any Aamina.

48
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:52,166
The only Aamina I know is the
3 foot long, succulent fish.

49
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,041
Almost impossible to find.

50
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,958
Akbar once caught it...

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,416
...but he let it go.

52
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,250
Hit him!

53
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,208
Hit him!

54
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,666
Look at this boy's face.

55
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,416
I've had it.

56
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,041
Always up to no good.

57
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,166
I don't think Moosa can take care
of me anymore.

58
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,583
I really feel my brother's absence now.

59
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,458
Moosa gets irritated whenever
I mention him.

60
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,083
I will definitely find my brother.

61
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,083
Where will you search though?

62
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,291
He went missing in the sea, right?
How are you sure he's even alive?

63
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,833
I heard he left this island heartbroken.

64
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,916
He's not the kind of guy who would
leave this island because of a failed relationship.

65
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:16,708
Exactly!

66
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,708
There was no one like him in the 'madrassa.'

67
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,458
He cured my grandmother's illness
by performing 'kuthu ratheeb.'

68
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,958
She passed away as soon
as he left.

69
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,791
Do you remember his face?

70
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,291
No.

71
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,166
There are a few photos of him,
but none of those are clear.

72
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,916
Only Aamina's face is recognizable.

73
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,791
Is that why you've been asking around
for her number?

74
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,708
Isn't she in Bombay? It's a huge city.

75
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,541
How will you get there? They don't sell
tickets to kids.

76
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,083
Swimming there is an option.

77
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,416
I can take our boat. The tide
will take me there.

78
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,916
What if it takes you to China?
I heard they eat kids there.

79
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,208
Where is he?

80
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,458
He must be stuck somewhere.
He said he got Aamina's number.

81
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,958
What will you ask Aamina?

82
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,916
Will you get straight to the point?

83
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,916
I'll tell her I'm coming to Bombay.

84
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,541
You need money to survive there till
you meet her.

85
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,166
We can catch some fish and sell it.

86
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,708
One good catch will fetch us good money.

87
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,208
There he is!

88
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,166
How much do we owe him?

89
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,333
We'll sort that later.
Let's get the number first.

90
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,125
Here's the number.

91
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,375
Where's my money?

92
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,333
Umm... Give us a few days.

93
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,791
We'll pay you first.

94
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,041
Don't try to fool me, okay?

95
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,375
You lot will come to me
asking for help again.

96
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,833
I'll set you straight then.

97
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:41,125
Add some more masala.
- And end up crying like last time?

98
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,500
Flip it.

99
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,750
Isn't it time to go home?

100
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,000
Go home!

101
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,000
I said, go home!

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,250
Why are you shouting?

103
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,958
You guys are bad influences! Go now!

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,750
Let's go.
-He's getting riled up for no reason.

105
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,708
What did you say?
- Nothing!

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,875
Go!

107
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,375
Why'd you ask Bakker for Aamina's number?

108
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,625
How many times have I told you not to
go searching for your brother's stories?

109
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,000
It's all my fault.

110
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,625
I should have been more strict with you.

111
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,625
Don't you dare pull such stunts again.

112
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,125
This is your last warning.

113
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,125
Incorrigible kids, Moosa. What can we do?

114
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,458
Our hands are tied.

115
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,958
We've reached
the Mumbai dock.

116
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
We'll be out in a half hour.
So, get ready.

117
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,083
Who the hell peed in the pan?

118
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,458
- Will your mom clean this up?
- Hey, shut up!

119
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
Throw this guy out!

120
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,291
Bloody addict.

121
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,916
Give me a cigarette!

122
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,458
Give me a bloody cigarette!

123
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,333
Is anyone listening?

124
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,916
Shall I throw you in there as well?

125
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,250
Are you guys dead?

126
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,625
Step back, kid.

127
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
He's intoxicated. He'll tear you apart.

128
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
I want to go home.

129
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,125
I want to go home.

130
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,708
What?

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,125
- I want to go home!
- I want to go home!

132
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,083
Sit down.

133
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:32,916
Greetings.

134
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,416
My name is Prasanth.

135
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,791
This is our orphanage's warden.

136
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,541
You told me about a child over the phone.

137
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,541
Oh, yes. It's that one sitting there.

138
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,791
Oi, you!

139
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,291
Decided to bathe after all, huh?

140
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,041
Are you going to bathe with
your clothes on?

141
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,541
You see that drawing?

142
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,416
It's my work of art.

143
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,083
Are you not understanding what
I'm saying?

144
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,791
Here, you want a soap bar?

145
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,708
Towel?

146
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,375
A hot kiss?

147
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,208
Did someone mess with you?

148
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,416
I didn't do anything.

149
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,958
That kid tried to kiss me!

150
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,375
Didn't like the people here?

151
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,625
Didn't like me?

152
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,750
Come on.

153
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,000
Take it off.

154
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,833
Take it off.

155
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,750
I said, take it off.

156
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,875
Run, run!

157
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,625
Hey, stop right there!

158
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
You lot, get back here right now!

159
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,375
Did he touch you?

160
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Tell me.

161
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,125
Do you want to escape from this place?

162
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,500
My mother...

163
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,000
She's the heroine of Kamathipura.

164
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,125
She loves me a lot.

165
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,833
The cops forcefully
brought me here.

166
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,875
They said she's not capable
of taking care of me.

167
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,250
But, she's badass.

168
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,791
Mother?

169
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,541
Rosy.

170
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,500
Kamathipura is close by.

171
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,875
Kamathipura...

172
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,416
Hey!

173
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,041
Close the gate!

174
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,666
Security!

175
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,166
Close the gate!

176
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,791
Stop him!

177
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey, catch the ball!

178
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,166
Catch the ball, man!

179
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,666
He can't even catch a ball!

180
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,416
Hey, nuthead!

181
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,666
Never played cricket before?

182
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,125
At least pass the ball!

183
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,125
Got money on you?

184
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,541
Rosy?

185
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,666
Rosy...

186
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,625
Oi, Rosy!

187
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,958
Rosy!

188
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,125
Who is so excited
about me?

189
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,625
What?

190
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,750
Raju...

191
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,625
Come upstairs.

192
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,375
Raju sent you here?

193
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,083
What's your name?

194
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,000
Are you dumb or do you not
understand my language?

195
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,875
Raju.

196
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,875
Come.

197
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,708
You sneaked out of the children's home,
didn't you?

198
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,708
Look at your clothes.

199
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,625
It's all torn.

200
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:40,958
Sit!

201
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,958
You know the rules, Rosy.

202
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,750
Bhai decides what goes on
in Kamathipura.

203
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,125
Leave that to me.

204
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,625
Let him work here.

205
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,500
I know how to handle Bhai.

206
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I'll fine you 5 rupees for
every broken glass.

207
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,583
- Take your hands off.
-What?

208
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,958
- What's your name, punk?
- Take your hands off.

209
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,041
What's your name?

210
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,708
This is our area, got it?

211
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,375
Our area.

212
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,958
Check his pockets,
he might have money!

213
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,583
I'll kill you if you
take my money!

214
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:47,958
Altaf!

215
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,208
Hey, Altaf!

216
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,333
- Yeah, mom.
- Let go of him.

217
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,583
Mom, he's trying to act smart
in our area.

218
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,708
Scram!

219
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,208
We're not done with you.

220
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,083
You'll bump into us soon, alone.

221
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,583
You're dead meat.

222
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,083
Get the hell out of here!

223
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,458
I don't want kids
from pigs like you.

224
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,500
What now?

225
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,541
Those guys stole all of my money.

226
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,083
I don't understand your gibberish.
I work here.

227
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,958
- I was saving it to make a call!
- Closed door means open for business.

228
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,166
And open for business means

229
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,125
- I don't want to see your face around here.
- I don't even have enough money to eat.

230
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,125
Yeah, me too.

231
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,500
Greetings, Bhai.

232
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,208
You sure no one's searching for him?

233
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,833
He's from the island.

234
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,208
Island?

235
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,333
You're from the island, little one?

236
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,833
So, you're Bhai's breed, huh?

237
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:52,958
Isn't that right, kid?

238
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,583
Aw, you're whining?

239
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,458
Hey, doggy.

240
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,458
He'll fetch us an easy 50,000
in the market.

241
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,375
He's a wild one though, huh?

242
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,625
Tell me, shall I
strike the deal?

243
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,583
First, we have to tame him.

244
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:20,000
Tell Babu Chapri that
we will deliver him soon.

245
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,333
What about the advance amount?

246
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,958
Not yet. Relax.

247
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:29,875
Relax.

248
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,583
Peace be upon you, brother!

249
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:35,958
Yes...

250
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,083
What do you want?

251
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,500
Where's the money?

252
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,375
What money?

253
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,375
- Drop the act.
- I haven't received any call about money.

254
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,541
Make the call, then.

255
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,666
What's up, birdie?

256
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,750
Bhai has sent Salim.

257
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:52,583
He's asking for the cash.

258
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,708
What should I do?

259
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:54,958
Alright.

260
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm giving you the cash only because
the boss told me to.

261
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,083
When will the boy be delivered?

262
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,708
He's a wild one.
He needs to be tamed.

263
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,250
Leave.

264
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:32,958
What are you doing here?

265
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,083
You thought you could get away
from me, punk?

266
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,875
Good that you've tied him up, Bhai.
He deserves it.

267
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey.

268
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let go of him.

269
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,208
You're lucky Bhai told me
to let go of you.

270
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,250
Meet me alone, I'll shove a bat
up your ass!

271
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,875
And turn you into a popsicle!

272
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,250
Oi, out, out.

273
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,500
I won't spare you, punk.

274
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,500
It's only Bhai's word that saved you.

275
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,333
Hey, Rosy!

276
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,750
Rosy!

277
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,666
Your boy is in our hands now!

278
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,458
Piss off!

279
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,000
Idiot.

280
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,625
Sultan.

281
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,583
Here, take this.

282
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,166
Did those jokers pay up?

283
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,791
Count it.

284
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,583
I need more stuff.

285
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,250
How much do you smoke a day?

286
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,833
Have you seen your eyes?

287
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,125
Red.

288
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,916
I'm busy, come back later.

289
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,041
I won't repeat myself, you halfwit!
Try the next door.

290
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,500
Let go.

291
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,375
Where's the kid, woman?

292
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,875
Tell me or I'll wring your neck.

293
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,875
You heartless halfwit.

294
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,000
You left that kid starving.

295
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,500
You're one to talk,
woman!

296
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,750
Your own son is in
that gutter now.

297
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,625
Your kid's rotting on government funds!

298
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,000
Get the hell out, you fool!

299
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,625
Leave or I'll cut you up!

300
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,375
I don't have money right now.
Can I pay you later?

301
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,375
What are you saying?

302
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:54,916
Phone?

303
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,625
No.

304
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,541
Go, go. No money, no phone call.

305
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,250
Can I...

306
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,875
I don't know. Now, go.

307
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,875
I warned you not to mess with
Bhai and his boys.

308
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,125
They're looking for you.

309
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,250
Stay away from here for a while.

310
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,250
Where the hell were you?

311
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,250
Tell me.

312
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,166
Say something!

313
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,916
He's been acting smart.

314
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Tell Bhai we found him. Run.

315
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,250
Tell me, punk.

316
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,250
Hey, doggy.

317
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,875
Say something, doggy.

318
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,750
If you're Mr. India,
I'm Baazigar, boy.

319
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,875
Come, let's party.

320
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,041
What did you think?

321
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,750
That we wouldn't be able
to find you?

322
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,583
There's a lot of money
riding on you, kid.

323
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,875
Hey, Pikku!

324
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,416
Back off!

325
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,500
Not bad, kid.

326
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,625
Let's see what more you got.

327
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,375
Salim,

328
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,125
Yeah, Bhai?

329
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,250
Get the lamb.

330
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,875
He won't do it.

331
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,500
Hold the knife!

332
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,125
Yeah, like this.

333
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,541
Hold the knife...

334
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,250
and kill it swift; halal.

335
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,250
Any other way; haraam.

336
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,000
Man up and chop!

337
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,875
Hold the knife properly!

338
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,833
Let's see what you're made of.

339
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,625
Chop!

340
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,458
Slash its neck!

341
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:07,666
Quick!

342
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,250
Do it!

343
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,250
Don't test me!

344
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:16,375
Hey! Now, you're one of us.

345
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Catch.

346
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,875
If you can't keep your hat on,

347
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,000
don't bother putting it on.

348
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,666
Leave it to the ones who can keep it on.

349
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,750
Who are you searching for?

350
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:15,125
My big brother.

351
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,041
He lives here?

352
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,000
I think so.

353
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,041
He came here years back.

354
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,916
That's why I'm here.

355
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,750
Long back...

356
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,625
Years ago...

357
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,750
A swine came here
from the island.

358
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:05,625
I saw him struggling here
doing odd jobs.

359
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,041
His body was full of scars.

360
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,375
When nothing was
working for him,

361
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,375
He started doing all kinds of things
to survive.

362
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,875
The cops nab him
from time to time.

363
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,375
When finally, he...

364
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,916
...he came to me a defeated man...

365
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,166
...I finished him off myself.

366
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,000
A nobody.

367
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,375
If you want to survive
these streets...

368
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,250
...you're going to need to
learn some tricks.

369
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:20,250
I'm going to teach you everything, kid.

370
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,458
Come here.

371
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,458
Come here, you!

372
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,000
Aamina?

373
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,750
Aam... Aamina?

374
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,791
Hello?

375
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,500
Trying to call your girlfriend?

376
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
Don't call girls, do something productive.

377
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,291
Here you go.

378
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,625
Let's go.

379
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,875
Oi, let's go.

380
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,125
Let's go!

381
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,125
Balli!

382
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,500
Balli!

383
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,125
Greetings, Bhai.

384
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:18,291
We need more stuff.

385
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,208
Did you talk to Karim Bhai?

386
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,375
What talk? Just give me the stuff.

387
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:27,375
This kid here, he's going to
handle it this time.

388
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,500
What if he gets caught by the cops?

389
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,750
He doesn't understand Hindi.

390
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,750
Go, get the stuff.

391
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,416
Hey!

392
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,250
I didn't take it seriously when
Salim warned me about you.

393
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,583
That's why I let you be.

394
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,291
Give me the money.

395
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,375
Who are you calling
with my phone?

396
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,250
Give me the phone.

397
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,041
Let go of me!

398
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:10,625
Let go!

399
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,250
I came here looking for my brother!

400
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,916
You and your fake stories!

401
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:24,333
I'm not lying! I came here
looking for my brother!

402
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,250
I came looking for Akbar!

403
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,125
What did you say?

404
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:38,791
I... I came looking for Akbar.

405
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,875
Let go!

406
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,083
You?

407
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:06,375
I... I'm Akbar's sister.

408
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:30,791
Your name?

409
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,000
Mulla.

410
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,791
Apply it on your face.

411
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,666
For your information, this is
not a fairness cream.

412
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:31,666
Get lost.

413
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,875
Aamina, do you remember
his first performance?

414
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:39,000
Of course! He fainted
seeing his own blood.

415
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,250
I see your brother has
come down.

416
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,750
Is he getting married?

417
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,291
Yeah, if he agrees this time, that is.

418
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,000
- Go home, it's late.
- Okay.

419
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,500
Let it dry on the wound.

420
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,625
Don’t jump into the sea
right away.

421
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,500
Even that deaf and mute
idiot is getting a bride.

422
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,750
He’s not deaf. He’s a mute.

423
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,875
Would I also have to go to Bombay
to get a bride now?

424
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:08,500
Did you see him?

425
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,083
He was there at the performance.

426
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,208
I didn't notice him.

427
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,000
He looks completely
different now.

428
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Don’t you remember him?

429
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,250
That timid guy.

430
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,125
We used to bully him.

431
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,875
Not we, just you.

432
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,625
True, I bullied him a lot.

433
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Once, I kept him in a corner
till he peed his pants.

434
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,250
I hope he doesn’t
remember any of that.

435
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,625
He's all muscular now.

436
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,375
You coming for a swim?

437
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,791
No, you carry on.

438
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:57,291
As-salaamu alaykum.

439
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,750
Wa alaykumu s-salaam.

440
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,625
- You arrived today?
- Yes.

441
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,250
I saw you performing.
It was beautiful.

442
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,625
Do it again. I didn’t get it.

443
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,000
Your performance…

444
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:27,750
I saw it. It was amazing!

445
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
You liked my performance.
Isn’t it?

446
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,625
Exactly.

447
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,000
How do I say "thank you"
in sign language?

448
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,041
Thank -- you.

449
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,958
Thank you.

450
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,375
There we go.

451
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:50,416
Aren’t you going back?

452
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,875
Yes, soon.

453
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,000
Did you learn this
sign language in Bombay?

454
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,250
Yes.

455
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,875
No one here understands
anything I say.

456
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:10,750
No one understands what you're saying?
Is that what you meant?

457
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,875
Yes.

458
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,375
I'm understanding it all.

459
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,125
Yes, you are.

460
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,375
Let the kids talk.

461
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,541
The rest of you can come with me.

462
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,000
I've been learning Hindi.

463
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,500
Does everyone in Bombay
understand your sign language?

464
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,666
No, you have to go to a
special school for that.

465
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:00,500
You'll teach me?
Isn't that what you said?

466
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:07,791
What's wrong?

467
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Mother!

468
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,375
Aamir!

469
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,458
Aamir!

470
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,875
This is not the first time
he’s fallen down like this.

471
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,750
I have a feeling someone has
voodooed him.

472
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:30,291
Feeling better now?

473
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,500
He’s saying his throat is dry.

474
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,250
I understood.

475
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,791
You can’t drink water tonight.

476
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:53,791
Give him this drink.

477
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,750
There's something
troubling him.

478
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,416
Can you come tomorrow
and help him out, Akbar?

479
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,625
Can I come along with you guys?

480
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,125
- You want to come with us?
- Yes.

481
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,541
We won’t be back by nightfall.

482
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:19,875
Plus, it'll be a mess if
you get seasick and puke.

483
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,625
Can you swim well?

484
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,000
Of course. As swift as a fish.

485
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,708
I don’t smoke.

486
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,958
Try it.

487
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Are you guys not coming?

488
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:17,833
We'll come in a while!

489
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:24,083
You go. I’m good here.

490
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
- You’re not coming?
- Not anytime soon.

491
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:27,750
Why not?

492
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,458
I’m happy here.

493
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,750
Is there such beauty in Bombay?

494
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,916
Of course! It's magnificent.

495
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:37,875
Really?

496
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:41,541
Like, the sunset is just as beautiful.

497
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,375
I've heard there are a lot
of pigeons there.

498
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,375
Countless numbers.

499
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,125
From my window, I can
see them all flying around.

500
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:55,583
Is it?

501
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,250
I see them the moment
I wake up every morning.

502
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,750
I wish to see Bombay
at least once.

503
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,500
I’ll take you there.
I’ll show you Bombay.

504
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,250
- You'll take me there?
- Yes, I will.

505
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,000
What is it?

506
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,250
I don’t want to get married.

507
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,750
Hmm.

508
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:33,875
No one understands.

509
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,125
What does that mean?

510
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:40,250
No one listens to me when I say
I don’t want to get married.

511
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,125
I've been trying to
tell them repeatedly.

512
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,250
They don’t understand you, huh?

513
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,750
It's bloody frustrating!

514
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,333
- Can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

515
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,875
That night, when I saw you
performing…

516
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,500
didn’t you notice me?

517
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:11,833
That night, at your performance,
our eyes met.

518
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,583
Or, was it just me?

519
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:36,541
Are you just going to
sunbathe all day?

520
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,291
You haven’t caught
a single fish.

521
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,541
Give me some more time.

522
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,333
The season has just begun.

523
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,916
You expect the fish to just
jump onto the boat for you?

524
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,250
Get yourself a nice tan.
I’m off.

525
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,000
Hmm.

526
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,416
Give her a break, Akbar.

527
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,458
She'll run out of breath.

528
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:06,083
Stop it, Akbar.

529
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,041
You're spoiling this child.

530
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,833
Giving her the
strangest of names!

531
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,625
Have you ever heard of a girl
being named 'Mulla' on this island?

532
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,333
What’s wrong with her name?

533
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:18,250
It's the name of the
most beautiful fragrance!

534
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,458
Where's Aamina?

535
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:23,375
Haven’t seen her around today.

536
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,458
The entire family has gone to
Kochi for wedding shopping.

537
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:26,583
They'll be back tomorrow.

538
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:40,083
[...When a coin fell into
knee deep water...]

539
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,166
[...girl, you bent down and
picked it up...]

540
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,166
[...without getting your clothes wet...]

541
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,166
[...Cumin, turmeric, coriander...]

542
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,208
[...and all the other spices...]

543
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,208
[...were mixed very well by you...]

544
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,291
[...and powdered on a stone, girl....]

545
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,708
[...When a coin fell into
knee deep water...]

546
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,458
[...girl, you bent down and
picked it up...]

547
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,041
[...without getting your clothes wet...]

548
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,708
[...Cumin, turmeric, coriander...]

549
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,333
[...and all the other spices...]

550
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,041
[...were mixed very well by you...]

551
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,708
[...and powdered on a stone, girl...]

552
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,208
I thought you went to
Kochi as well.

553
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,750
I didn’t want to go.

554
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,958
You're shivering.

555
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,750
Are you feeling cold?

556
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:18,875
Does it hurt?

557
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,125
Not anymore.

558
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:32,750
There is no one home.

559
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,208
I'm not able to
get a hold of myself.

560
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,500
The pain...

561
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,375
...of the knife piercing my gut...

562
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,583
...I felt it for the first time.

563
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:11,250
Whatever's distracting you is
not for your good, Akbar.

564
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:35,000
Aamir, stop messing around.
I have lots to do.

565
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:42,208
Stop! Moosa!

566
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,416
Moosa, leave him!

567
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,125
Moosa!

568
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,333
Why are you hitting him?

569
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,416
Please stop this!

570
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,416
Let go of him, Moosa!

571
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,375
Moosa, tell me what's wrong!

572
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,375
If I ever see you
with Akbar again...

573
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:06,041
...I’ll slaughter you.

574
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:13,291
Get lost!

575
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:14,416
Aamir…

576
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,708
Get lost, you fool!

577
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,458
Rot in hell!

578
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,333
Aamir...

579
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,208
Why are you so quiet?

580
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:42,666
No reason.

581
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,791
Aamina and her mother
are extremely upset...

582
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,041
...about what happened today.

583
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,333
What happened?

584
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,166
Like you don't know.

585
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,333
I said, what happened?

586
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:03,416
Moosa thrashed him.

587
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,250
Where is he?

588
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,000
Akbar, leave.

589
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,333
I said, leave.

590
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,375
Aamir!

591
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,083
Akbar...

592
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:49,833
Aam...

593
01:11:04,416 --> 01:11:05,375
Come with me.

594
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,458
Aamir!

595
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:24,500
Akbar!

596
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:07,500
Kondotty festival is around the corner.

597
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:09,541
We need to start preparing
for our performance.

598
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,041
I’m not performing this year.

599
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:16,541
You don't get to decide that!

600
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,208
You can't always have your way.

601
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,666
Did you care to think about me?

602
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,541
It takes years to
build a reputation...

603
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:28,208
...and only a second
to lose it.

604
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,583
What's your point?

605
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,291
You're already dead set on
destroying everything.

606
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,916
Why did the rest of us
have to work so hard?

607
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,125
How are you capable of
being so selfish?

608
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:47,958
That too, for what?

609
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,583
I don’t know.

610
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,625
I don’t know anything anymore.

611
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:01,333
Is that all you have to say?

612
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,625
Is this all for that fellow?

613
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,500
People are saying all kinds
of things.

614
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,833
I don't give a damn.

615
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,166
As long as my friend
is not a part of it.

616
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,958
I thought at least
you'd understand.

617
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:29,291
Akbar.

618
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:31,416
Akbar.

619
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:33,708
He’s getting married in two days.

620
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,083
Please let him go.

621
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,208
At least for the sake of
your little sister.

622
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:50,500
I give my daughter
Fathima’s hand to you...

623
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:58,041
...as your wife with this 1001 rupees.

624
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,041
I accept.

625
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,541
I accept.

626
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,000
I accept.

627
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:12,250
Come with me to Bombay.

628
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:18,375
We talked about my house, remember?

629
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,625
You wanted to see Bombay.

630
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:26,166
You told me, remember?

631
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:28,166
I promised to take you there, remember?

632
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:32,541
Let’s go. Say something!
Why are you not saying anything?

633
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:37,916
We can see the pigeons
together from my window.

634
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,333
Hundreds of them!

635
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:45,791
The beach is also just as beautiful.

636
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:48,291
Remember? We talked about it!

637
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:57,416
The sunrise and sunset...

638
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,666
...we can see it, together.

639
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:02,708
Please! Please come.

640
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:07,916
Say something! Let’s go!

641
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,750
I have a request.

642
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:41,291
I want to say your name...

643
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:43,000
...at least once.

644
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,375
Just once.

645
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,166
A... a... a...

646
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:23,166
K... k...

647
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,083
Ba... r...

648
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,458
You called for me?

649
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,541
How did you get here?

650
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:08,333
In a ship.

651
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,375
A ship?

652
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:12,958
Did you come alone?

653
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,500
Do you always dress like a boy?

654
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,125
Won't your family be
looking for you?

655
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,500
I have no one.

656
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:26,958
Where's your mother?

657
01:21:26,958 --> 01:21:28,250
She's no more.

658
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:40,166
Stay here till I'm back.

659
01:21:40,416 --> 01:21:42,500
Can you help me find my brother?

660
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,541
I have a number.

661
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,333
Aamina's number.

662
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:53,750
I'm sure she knows where he is.

663
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,083
So, you won't help me?

664
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:54,083
I can't let her stay with me.

665
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,333
I live a very different life now.

666
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:00,208
This dance bar is run
by my husband.

667
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:03,250
We have a daughter as well.

668
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,791
Figure something else out.

669
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,000
Please don't come asking
for help again.

670
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:17,458
Hey! Get down here,
we've got work to do!

671
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,541
That halfwit must be asleep.

672
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,166
I'll go upstairs and check.

673
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:28,083
What's the hurry, playboy?

674
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,291
Get lost!

675
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,791
How dare you peep?

676
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:50,416
I ought to...

677
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,166
Get lost!

678
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,708
I said, get lost!

679
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:58,458
Why are you so concerned
about that kid?

680
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:01,666
And, what do you think?

681
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,416
That, if I shut shop,

682
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:06,791
people will wait around for me?

683
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,375
I'm not that special.

684
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:30,041
You're more special than
you think, Rosy.

685
01:24:58,458 --> 01:24:59,500
Fine, send him over.

686
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:02,500
It'll cost you though.

687
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,625
[...On the pages of my eyes...]

688
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,791
[...I had written it a thousand times...]

689
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:13,166
[...The love that was evident on paper...]

690
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:17,916
[...could not be brought out in words...]

691
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:21,125
[...That I'm your hero...]
- Pikku?

692
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:25,583
The others are all frauds.

693
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,458
[...Stop right there...]

694
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,750
[...Stop right there, you...]

695
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,000
[...Oh, my sexy...]

696
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,208
[...give me a look...]

697
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:55,583
- [...My heart beats for you...]
- Let go!

698
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,000
What's happened to you?

699
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,541
You're in love, aren't you?

700
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:01,416
Huh? It's love, isn't it?

701
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:04,375
Come on, tell me. I'm your buddy.
Your bro.

702
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:05,833
You're no one's friend, you moron.

703
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:06,625
Oi!

704
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,291
Shut up and tell me.

705
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:09,291
What's your problem, man?

706
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:12,500
What problem? Tell me
the lucky girl's name.

707
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,541
Say it.

708
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,333
You're all dressed up.
Something's brewing.

709
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:16,666
Huh?

710
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:17,958
Swear on Rosy.

711
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,583
Get lost!

712
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:22,833
Open the door, Salim!

713
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,291
She's just a kid,
show some mercy!

714
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,208
Just a kid, man.

715
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,875
Zip it and get lost!

716
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,750
Bhai won't spare you!

717
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:29,541
Yeah, right.

718
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,958
Bhai can't do anything to me!

719
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:33,750
Salim, listen for once.

720
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:35,375
Bhai will kill you, I swear!

721
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,708
Shut up. Don't mess around.

722
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:40,500
Don't mess around, I'm warning you.

723
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
What are you looking at?
Is she your kid?

724
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:42,875
Yeah, she is.

725
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:46,666
- Oh, really? She's your child?
- Yeah, she is. Now, let her go.

726
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:47,625
- Hey!
- Back off!

727
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,750
- Leave the kid alone, please.
- Who is she to you?

728
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:51,500
- Salim, let go of her.
- Don't make a scene.

729
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:53,083
- Salim!
- Get away from here!

730
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,625
You bloody pimp!

731
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:57,041
Everyone's watching, stop!

732
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,333
Listen to me!

733
01:26:58,375 --> 01:26:59,125
Listen!

734
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:00,416
- What are you doing, Salim?
- Get lost.

735
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:01,791
Lock the door.

736
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:02,916
- Lock the door.
- What do you mean?

737
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:05,625
Lock the door, lock the door,
LOCK THE DOOR!

738
01:27:05,666 --> 01:27:07,000
You'll never learn.

739
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:27,166
Bhai!

740
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,083
Salim...

741
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:33,625
Salim has set out to sell Mulla.

742
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:48,291
Salim!

743
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,958
You double-crosser!
What have you done?

744
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,625
Bhai, it's only chloroform!

745
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:57,875
What have you done?

746
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,750
Mulla! Wake up!

747
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:01,708
It's only chloroform!

748
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,208
Bhai, I didn't do anyth...

749
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:13,750
Stand back, I have a knife on me!

750
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,083
I'll shove that knife up your butt,
you fool!

751
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:16,708
Come in.

752
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:46,875
Sit down.

753
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,083
I need your help.

754
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:08,458
My younger sister found
her way here.

755
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:13,791
She came in search of me.

756
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,250
Could you...

757
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,833
Could you take care of her
for two days?

758
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,750
You came here for her?

759
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:38,750
Don't pull me into this mess
again.

760
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,625
My business has taken a hit
looking after this kid.

761
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:44,166
Do you know how much money
I could have made by now?

762
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:46,875
Come.

763
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,500
You're going to sell her off anyway.

764
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,916
Don't give her hope.

765
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:03,000
Who is this?

766
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,333
He was my first friend in Bombay.

767
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,625
I don't want to stay here.

768
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,250
I'll come get you soon.

769
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,833
You never listen.

770
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:19,166
That's your problem.

771
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:20,291
Listen to me
for once.

772
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,250
You've always said,
"Salim..."

773
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,708
"Keep it simple. Keep the plan simple."

774
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:26,541
You're simply getting all riled up
over this kid!

775
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:28,416
I don't get it, I...

776
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:31,166
What do I say? I just
really want to...

777
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:35,541
Get out of the car.

778
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,125
Bhai, has this kid cast
a spell on you?

779
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,750
How much does he owes us?

780
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:54,875
Ten thousand bucks, boss.

781
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,750
It was that kid's fault, boss.

782
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:58,750
I swear, ask Balli.

783
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,500
Bhai, I told you not to
trust that kid.

784
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,625
Boss...

785
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,416
Give me a big one.

786
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:12,875
These small-time jobs are
no fun anymore.

787
01:34:14,541 --> 01:34:16,166
I'll repay everything in one shot.

788
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,375
You bloody addict.

789
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:21,625
You're out of your senses
half the time.

790
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:23,750
Why give me a bigger headache?

791
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:26,375
I'm too busy to clean up
after you.

792
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:29,000
Can we... get a minute, boss?

793
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,541
If I mess up again...

794
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,458
My throat...

795
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,583
Your knife.

796
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,916
You need to deliver a consignment.

797
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:02,375
I'll do the arrangements
for the job myself.

798
01:35:03,791 --> 01:35:07,375
All you've got to do is pick up
a middleman who will then direct you.

799
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,291
You'll need around
15-20 people.

800
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,041
It's a game of millions.

801
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,833
Balli will give you a gun
for your safety.

802
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,750
Return it once the job
is done.

803
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:23,750
Can... Can we get two guns?
For everyone's safety?

804
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,375
There's no need for guns.

805
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,291
Who should I deliver
the money to?

806
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,041
You know the kind of people
who live here?

807
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:03,041
The ones who act in films.

808
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,166
The famous people who act
in films?

809
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,416
Like Amitabh Bachchan.

810
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,500
It was a simple set of words.

811
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,541
All you had to say was...

812
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,125
..."Boss, give me a gun.

813
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:13,916
"Boss, give me a gun..."

814
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:15,625
If you didn't want it, I would have
held onto it.

815
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,666
I would have happily
held onto it.

816
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:18,458
Why'd you have to act all heroic?

817
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:19,958
Why didn't any of you
say a word back then?

818
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,125
Shaking your heads now
won't help.

819
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,750
- Bloody bobbleheads!
- Oi, stop barking!

820
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,625
I wish I could, Bhai.

821
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:25,916
Salim's right, Bhai.

822
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:27,875
I will gouge your eyes out! Shut up!

823
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,375
Oi, he's talking to you, idiot.

824
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:31,583
My God...

825
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,375
Shit, Bhai!

826
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:52,791
COME AT ME, YOU IDIOTS!

827
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,375
What the hell is happening, Bhai?

828
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,916
Why are you trying to
get us killed?

829
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,000
I'll kill you! I swear I will!

830
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:08,250
You're finished! I swear, you're finished!

831
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,250
You nitwit!

832
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,375
Bhai, careful!

833
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,500
What did I tell you? Huh?
What did I tell you?

834
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,500
It's all gone!

835
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,875
The money, the stash, everything!

836
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:42,291
I warned you!

837
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,625
It's all these idiots' fault!

838
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:46,125
It was a bad move, Bhai!

839
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,291
We're finished!

840
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:49,333
Do you remember what you
told me long back?

841
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:51,625
You told me you're my
big brother.

842
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:54,250
They thrashed me like a dog.

843
01:39:57,458 --> 01:39:59,125
Like a dog.

844
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:00,791
I can't even take a dump anymore.

845
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:11,208
Get up.

846
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:12,791
I said, get up.

847
01:40:19,833 --> 01:40:22,458
While you've been stuffing your nose
with this stuff,

848
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:24,375
I've been getting beaten up.

849
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:26,500
Those savages.

850
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:30,791
... And you did nothing about it.

851
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:41,416
What do I do about you?

852
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:43,541
Tell me, what?

853
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:46,000
Come on, tell me.

854
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:50,166
Half of me wants to leave you
bleeding to death here!

855
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,916
I got thrashed and
you got stoned!

856
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:08,041
The boss will kill me!

857
01:41:10,958 --> 01:41:12,291
I don't want to die.

858
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:14,291
I don't want to die!

859
01:41:15,541 --> 01:41:17,166
I don't want to die, you swine!

860
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,750
I don't want to die, you hear me?

861
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:22,500
There's no use in saying
my name!

862
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:26,583
You got me into this mess!

863
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:28,375
You used to say I'm your brother!

864
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,791
Brother my foot!

865
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:33,541
I know your kid's a girl,
not a boy!

866
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:34,958
You've lost your mind, Bhai!

867
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,583
It's a bloody girl!

868
01:42:12,541 --> 01:42:13,958
Can I give you some advice?

869
01:42:35,583 --> 01:42:37,708
You've got to stop
dressing up like boys.

870
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,333
It's a trap.

871
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:46,250
Isn't it better to live according
to what others think?

872
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,000
How about some make-up?

873
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,708
Let's start with some lipstick.

874
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:12,333
Fine, at least a bangle then.

875
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,333
Yeah, that'll look pretty.

876
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:19,333
Let go!

877
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:24,083
Let go!

878
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,083
There we go, it fits.

879
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:31,958
Let go of me!

880
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,166
Hear me out, boss.

881
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:19,458
We said we'll definitely
return the money, right?

882
01:44:20,916 --> 01:44:22,166
What's my fault in this?

883
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:25,000
I'm telling you, the delivery
will be made, boss.

884
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,833
You just handle Chapri.

885
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:06,791
Cut it out!

886
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:08,041
Let go of me!

887
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,500
Let go!

888
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:11,916
Calm down, man!

889
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,166
It's good there.

890
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,416
We'll get all of that there.

891
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:30,375
Take this.

892
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:32,541
Nothing to worry about.

893
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:33,333
Fill it up slowly.

894
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:34,333
Hey, brat!

895
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,625
Hey, it's Salim.

896
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:36,916
Chapri has asked for you.

897
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:42,250
Come with me or
I'll whack you deaf.

898
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:43,916
Salim, back off. What do
you want?

899
01:45:43,916 --> 01:45:44,166
Piss off.

900
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:46,541
- Salim, stop it.
- What's wrong with you, man?

901
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:47,375
Let go of me!

902
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,500
I feed all you swines!

903
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:49,875
- So, back off!
- Let go of her!

904
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:11,541
Get up, Mulla.

905
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:13,916
You hit me?

906
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:19,375
We're screwed.

907
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,041
You dared hit me?

908
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:23,166
You thankless maggots!

909
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:24,833
After everything I did for you!

910
01:46:25,916 --> 01:46:27,000
Fools!

911
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:44,875
Salim!

912
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:50,458
- Where's the kid?
- Bhai, too late!

913
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,583
She's been sold off!

914
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,833
Stop, you...

915
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:17,083
Hey, Salim!

916
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,666
You can't run from me!

917
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:48,875
Salim!

918
01:49:35,833 --> 01:49:36,833
Salim!

919
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,375
Salim...

920
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:54,541
She's my own blood.

921
01:49:59,875 --> 01:50:01,125
My sister.

922
01:50:14,416 --> 01:50:15,500
Speak!

923
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,208
Speak...

924
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:44,208
Allah...

925
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:47,958
Oi, did you not get it the first time?

926
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:49,875
I said, come later!

927
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:57,958
Hey, who's at the door?

928
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:01,916
I'm paying extra for you, babe.

929
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:02,916
Come back in.

930
01:54:05,458 --> 01:54:07,083
Have you gone deaf?
