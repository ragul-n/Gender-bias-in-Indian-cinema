1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are people who live here...

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and yet...

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
life here has come to standstill

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
"This land was like
the heavens..."

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
"it has now turned
into a hell"

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Destruction everywhere...
wails of mourning"

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
"Freedom is itself in captivity,
every deed is an atrocity"

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
"Every heart burns
in the simmering deserts"

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
"Faith has been betrayed...
but there is yet hope sometimes"

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
"A dawn of joy shall some day
overcome the darkness of sorrow"

11
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
"Today"s December 2, 1994"

12
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is the day when l had married
Jaanbaz and left my hometown Kolkata...

13
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
"five years ago, and dreamt
of starting a new life here"

14
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"Here, in this farflung town
of Afghanistan"

15
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Our village is an 1B-hour journey
away from Kabul

16
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When l came here in 19BB
for the first time...

17
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the whole country was in the grip
of a ravaging civil war

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
"The then President Dr Hajibullah,
with the help of the Russians..."

19
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
was fighting lslamic militants

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The Afghanis are an extremely
freedom-loving people

21
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They will even lay down their lives
to safeguard their freedom

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But they have trampled under their
feet the issue of women"s freedom

23
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ln the name of customs
and in the name of religion

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The worst example of this
suppression is the Taliban

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
"And today l, Sushmita,
am a mere prisoner..."

26
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
"a prisoner of fanatics,
the Taliban"

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Stop! Look over there

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
lt"s the fasting month of Ramzan and
smoke is coming out of that house

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Should we go check it?
- Let"s go

30
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Glory be to Allah"s greatness

31
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh my God!

32
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Damnation!

33
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What happened?

34
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
"Don"t you know, it"s
the month of Ramzan?"

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
"During Ramzan, you"ve got to observe
the roza (fast) Do you know?"

36
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are not supposed to cook.
You"ve got to pray every day

37
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Chant the name of Allah!

38
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
l"m not a Muslim

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But you must still
chant the name of Allah

40
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You must observe the fast
and do just as we say

41
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Never
- Shameless!

42
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Chant the name of Allah! Go on

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Never

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Chant the name... Go on!
- No

45
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mummy!

46
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Chant the name of Allah

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Abu! Uncle Dranai!
Save me from them!

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Stop it

49
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
"lf you dare speak against lslam,
we will hang you till you die!"

50
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
"lf such a thing happens again,
we will hang all of you to death"

51
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jaanbaz is to blame for all this

52
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Taliban can walk into the house
anytime and kill anyone they want

53
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Jaanbaz has brought this infidel here
and created this problem for us

54
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She should convert to lslam

55
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The Taliban are right.
She should be fasting

56
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She is a Hindu from lndia.
She is not like us

57
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mummy...

58
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
"Try to understand, father.
- No, never"

59
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sumi...

60
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now listen to me

61
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The Hindus and Muslims
belong to two different religions

62
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Our traditions and cultures
are very different

63
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You are not going to find happiness
married to a Muslim

64
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Which means what you taught me
was wrong!

65
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
"The values we have imbibed are
no good, they mean nothing?"

66
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Have you any idea what our
position in our own community...

67
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
will be if we accept him?
We"ll have to hide our faces

68
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So that"s your problem.
You"ll have to hide your faces

69
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Which means your position means
more to you than your daughter?

70
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
"We"re worried about you, Sumi.
Which is why we"re reasoning with you"

71
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
"What do you know about him,
about his family?"

72
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That a moneylender will become my
son-in-law... l can never accept

73
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So don"t accept it. Tell the
world that l"ve died

74
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
All right. We have no other way

75
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
l"ve told you what l"ve decided.
l don"t want anymore arguments

76
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
"No, father. You can"t decide it.
lt"s my life and l"ve made my decision"

77
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But Mita...

78
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That you"re a Muslim and l"m a Hindu
makes no difference to me

79
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But how can we deny the truth?

80
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Our marriage will spell
doom for my family

81
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So the promises you made to me
mean nothing?

82
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
"Our love is finished?
- l don"t know, Jaanbaz"

83
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
l"m terribly confused.
What can l do?

84
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
"Mita, let"s run away
- Where to?"

85
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
To my country. Afghanistan

86
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
"A land of tall mountains,
clear blue skies..."

87
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
snowclad plains...

88
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don"t think

89
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Look...

90
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What a beautiful sight

91
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What"s that?

92
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What"s happening here...?
What?

93
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Looks like a Russian air-attack.
Don"t worry

94
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Drive fast!

95
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
When will we reach home?

96
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don"t worry. We"re almost there

97
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Drive fast

98
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hurry up

99
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Glory be to Allah"s greatness

100
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Welcome! Welcome!

101
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
"How are you, Kala?
- Welcome home"

102
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
"Oh, stop it"

103
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Welcome home

104
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
"Greetings, Uncle Asam.
- Allah bless you"

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
"Greetings, Aunt Abu.
- Allah bless you"

106
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
"Look, Sultan.
That is Jaanbaz"s bride"

107
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She"s beautiful

108
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Welcome! Welcome

109
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let it be

110
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Come...come

111
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
l"m Gul Sarina. Jaanbaz"s aunt

112
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
"You can call me Abu,
like everyone else does"

113
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
"Hello, l"m Jalil.
Jaanbaz"s best friend"

114
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Want me to sing
an lndian song for you?

115
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Forget it. Go and
fetch her luggage first

116
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
l"ll sing for you later

117
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
"You can meet the others later.
You must be tired, come and rest"

118
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What happened?
- Don"t touch me!

119
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What happened?
- Don"t touch me

120
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You"re a liar! Did you show me
this picture of Afghanistan?

121
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
"Why did you lie to me? Why?
- l didn"t want to lose you, Mita"

122
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Mita... believe me

123
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
"You love me too, don"t you?"

124
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Don"t you love me?

125
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don"t ever lie to me
- l won"t

126
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Promise me.
- l promise

127
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Have some more. Where"d you find
such food in Calcutta?

128
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
"Enough, Kala. Enough"

129
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you feeling very cold?

130
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
"Come, come"

131
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
"Sushmita, remember Uncle?
You"ve met him"

132
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Salam Aliekom

133
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
"That"s his wife, Sarina"

134
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
His daughter.
- Zarina

135
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
His daughter-in-law.
- Babban

136
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
"That"s his son, Roshandar.
- Salam Aliekom"

137
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Uncle Aslam

138
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
His wife. Tell her your name.
- Bablu

139
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Who"s that?

140
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Gulgutti

141
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
"You"ve met my brothers Kala,
Musa, Sawali..."

142
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
"and that"s Abu"s son, Adraman.
- Hello"

143
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
l"m Gulabi

144
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
l"m Gulbibi

145
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
"This is Afghani bread.
Have some, taste it"

146
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
"Have some more, Jaanbaz.
- Enough, Kala."

147
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
"Uncle Dranai, Sushmita and l
got married in a hurry"

148
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We thought we"d celebrate here
if it"s okay with you

149
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There"s no need

150
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You"ve married an infidel

151
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You think you"ve done something great?
...She"s an infidel!

152
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did you sleep well?

153
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
"lf there"s anything you need,
you can tell me"

154
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don"t feel shy

155
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Careful

156
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What happened?

157
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Jaanbaz! Come quickly!

158
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
(Exorcism spells in Arabic)

159
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
(The verses are recited to exorcise
possession by evil spirits)

160
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
"Mita, are you all right?"

161
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What"s happening here?

162
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
"You aren"t well, Sushmita.
So we"ve called the priest"

163
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He"s an exorcist

164
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You folks still believe
in that drivel?

165
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He"ll set you right...
- He can"t do anything

166
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
"l need a doctor, not a priest
Stop it"

167
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
"Jaanbaz, l"m ill.
l need a doctor"

168
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
"l don"t need a Mullah.
l can"t tell them, but you..."

169
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why have you called me here?

170
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
First you call me here and
then insult me!

171
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
"Forgive me, Mullah Sahib"

172
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
l"m going. Think carefully
before you call me next time

173
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh my God!

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Such airs this lndian woman has!
- Shut up!

175
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We"ve grown up with never
a doctor coming to us

176
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Stop it. That"s enough

177
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Take her to a doctor

178
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
"Aunty, you know the only doctor is in
Mushkel and the way there is dangerous"

179
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
How am l supposed to take her
when she"s unwell?

180
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Abu and l will come with you

181
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
"Yes, they"ll go with you.
You"ll be all right"

182
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
"lf we are stopped on the way,
don"t utter a word"

183
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
l told you it wasn"t safe for you all
to come. But you didn"t listen

184
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We"d all be more tense had we
stayed home

185
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
"Oh, that"s true...
May Allah help us"

186
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Russians

187
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Bring her along.
- Very well

188
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Careful

189
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What did she have to eat?

190
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
She"s an lndian. She can"t
digest the food we eat

191
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
She ate very little

192
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Give her this medicine every day.
She"ll be all right

193
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
"May l take a look, doctor?
- Of course, it"s a medicine"

194
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
"l know, but l wish to see
what it is"

195
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Are they vitamin capsules?

196
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
"Yes, you"ll find them helpful.
You"ll be all right"

197
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But they"re way beyond
their expiry date!

198
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don"t you ever feel ashamed
at what you"re doing?

199
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You are cheating these naive folks.
This is so dangerous!

200
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
"Jaanbaz, please take me away.
l don"t want these medicines"

201
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
"Please take me away, Abu.
- One moment"

202
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You"ve said so much. How long have
you been here in Afghanistan?

203
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
"You"ve come from lndia, isn"t it?"

204
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
There isn"t a single doctor
here in Afghanistan

205
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But l do what l can

206
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
"We neither have the medicines,
nor drug making factories..."

207
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but l still try to infuse
as much confidence as l can

208
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So they will recover

209
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
"Don"t use that as an excuse to
give the wrong drugs, doctor"

210
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That"s not right

211
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
l know you are facing
a lot of hardships

212
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But you"d rather send patients away
than give them wrong medicines

213
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
"Abu, let"s go"

214
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Careful

215
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Now tell me what"s the good news?

216
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
"You really want to know?
- Yes, hurry up and tell me"

217
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
"Well, l"m pregnant"

218
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
"What? ls that the truth?
- Yes, the absolute truth"

219
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Feels nice to hear that?
- Nice...?

220
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You can"t imagine
how happy l am

221
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
"lf it"s a boy, we"ll call him Salim.
- No, we"re having a daughter..."

222
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
"we"ll name her Shahnaz.
Lovingly, we"ll call her Tinni"

223
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
"Okay, we"ll have twins"

224
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
O my heart"s beloved!

225
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
"When you are the gift l have been
given, what else is there to ask?"

226
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
What more can l ask of God?

227
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
"l have found heaven and earth
in your arms"

228
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
O my heart"s beloved!

229
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
"When you are the gift l have been
given, what else is there to ask?"

230
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What more can l ask of God?

231
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
"l have found heaven and earth
in your arms"

232
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
"l believe in you more than l
believe myself, O my true love!"

233
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
"Your faith, never shall l break.
This is a promise l make"

234
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
"l believe in you more than l
believe myself, O my true love!"

235
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
"l shall hide you in my eyes
so the world can"t see you"

236
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
O my heart"s beloved!

237
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
"When you are the gift l have been
given, what else is there to ask?"

238
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What more can l ask of God?

239
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
"l have found heaven and earth
in your arms"

240
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
"Such bliss
have l found"

241
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
"Now that you are mine
love itself is more lovely"

242
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
"My body and soul are drenched
in the colour of your love"

243
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
"Such bliss
have l found"

244
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
"Now that you are mine
love itself is more lovely"

245
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
"Love"s hues may be many.
But never may we ever be parted"

246
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
O my heart"s beloved!

247
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
"When you are the gift l have been
given, what else is there to ask?"

248
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What more can l ask of God?

249
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
"l have found heaven and earth
in your arms"

250
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
O my heart"s beloved!

251
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
"When you are the gift l have been
given, what else is there to ask?"

252
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What more can l ask of God?

253
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
"l have found heaven and earth
in your arms"

254
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
O my heart"s beloved

255
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
O my heart"s beloved

256
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
"Mother, l have good news for you"

257
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
l"m pregnant

258
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
"l"m very happy, Mother.
So is Jaanbaz"

259
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
His folks are wonderful

260
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They"re very simple

261
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
"l know, you and father must"ve been
hurt very much when l left abruptly"

262
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
"But my love for Jaanbaz has proved
to be greater than all these things"

263
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
"l"ll come to Kolkata very soon.
With Jaanbaz"

264
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
"Please forgive me, if you can.
Yours, Sumi"

265
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What happened?
Are you all right?

266
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
"l"m okay, Abu. l"ve got to mail
this letter. Where"s the post-office?"

267
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Why"re they laughing?

268
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
She wants pigeons perhaps
to post this letter!

269
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What joke is that?
- Your letter can"t be mailed

270
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
"Why? ls that the law?
- No law, but..."

271
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Where is Dranai?

272
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Where is he...?
- l saw him outside

273
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He has gone out.
- l"ll ask him

274
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
"Wait, you"re not going there.
No, you can"t"

275
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
"Why not, Abu? lt"s all right.
- Wait, women can"t go out"

276
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
"Stop there! Stop, l say!
- For Allah"s sake, don"t go!"

277
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Uncle Dranai...
- What is it?

278
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
l want to mail this letter to lndia.
To Kolkata

279
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
"Come with me, Sushmita"

280
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
See those ruins?

281
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
lt used to be our post-office

282
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Our streets were lit up
by lamp-posts

283
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Electric poles. We had electricity
in the whole village

284
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But how did this happen?

285
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The Russians bombed this place.
5 years ago

286
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
"Ever since, there has been no
post-office in our nation"

287
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No post-offices at all.
We can"t mail letters to anyone

288
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Letters can either be
mailed in Pakistan...

289
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
"or if there is someone coming from
lndia, he can carry a letter for you"

290
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
"ln any case, the folks here can
neither read nor write very well"

291
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There are hardly any letters
coming and leaving this country

292
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But how did all this happen?

293
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
lt happened because of the war

294
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
"The war has claimed
this nation, my child"

295
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
lt has taken a toll
of everything

296
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
"Schools, electricity, hospitals
post-offices... everything"

297
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
lt has ruined the future
of our children

298
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Everything is finished

299
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How long did the war last?

300
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Very long. Very very long

301
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
l"ve been watching it
from the last ten years

302
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
"ln 1979, when the Russians
arrived here..."

303
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the war was mainly between the
Russians and the lslamic militants

304
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But those who died were
the poor and the innocent

305
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
"The Russians went away,
but nothing was left here anymore"

306
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Everything lies in ruins

307
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Everything is finished

308
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Jaanbaz promised to get more money.
But he hasn"t

309
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What happened?

310
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Kala"s wedding is coming up.
- l know

311
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
According to our customs...

312
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
the groom"s folks must give
the bride"s parents some money

313
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But you needn"t worry. Go and rest.
lt"ll be arranged

314
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
How much do you need?
- Why are you telling her all this?

315
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
"How much do you need, Abu?
- 50,000 Afghanis"

316
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Maybe l can help

317
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
"Where will you find so much money?
- l don"t have any money, but..."

318
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
l have some gold ornaments.
l"m sure you will manage with it

319
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
l"ll give it to Jaanbaz who can
then raise the money

320
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
"You don"t mind, do you?"

321
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Allah be praised!
You"ve saved the family honour

322
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Come and sit down

323
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Thank you

324
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
"From today, we"ll call you
Sahib Kamal, Lady of Miracles!"

325
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
"Let"s sing in joy.
Let"s dance with joy"

326
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
"The bride"s face
is lovely as a flower"

327
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
"The nuptial wreath crowns
the groom"s head"

328
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
"Through the trailing wreath
the groom eyes the bride"

329
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
"Through the trailing wreath
the groom eyes the bride"

330
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
"The bride blushes
under the veil"

331
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
"Let"s sing in joy.
Let"s dance with joy"

332
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
"Hearts are alight
on this festive night"

333
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
"Those destined to be joined
meet tonight"

334
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
"Hearts are alight
on this festive night"

335
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
"Those destined to be joined
meet tonight"

336
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
"Have you ever seen
the sun and moon joined?"

337
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
"Have you ever seen
the sun and moon joined?"

338
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
"Oh, the joy of it!
This union is that rare joining"

339
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
"Let"s sing in joy.
Let"s dance with joy"

340
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
"The bride"s face
is lovely as a flower"

341
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
"The nuptial wreath crowns
the groom"s head"

342
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
"Hoping for happiness
we await the coming morrow"

343
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
"May your every night be moonlit,
your every day be festive"

344
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
"Love will now perfume
your body and soul"

345
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
"Then this world will be
verily a heaven"

346
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
"The bride"s face
is lovely as a flower"

347
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
"The nuptial wreath crowns
the groom"s head"

348
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
"Through the trailing wreath
the groom eyes the bride"

349
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
"Through the trailing wreath
the groom eyes the bride"

350
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
"The bride blushes
under the veil"

351
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Life was somehow going ahead

352
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
"There were problems,
but not unsurmountable ones"

353
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
"But the moment the Taliban arrived, it
seemed the world itself had changed"

354
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
"lnitially, those who joined the
Taliban were devout young Muslims"

355
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Those who had got their
education in the religious schools

356
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
"To begin with, they were seen only on
the borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan"

357
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
"But gradually, they started
fanning out in the villages"

358
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The Taliban made tall claims...

359
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that they would restore peace
and calm in the country

360
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
"But they gave nothing except violence,
atrocities and oppression"

361
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They have adopted a fanatical
stand on lslam...

362
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
"it"s a madness of sorts,
an obsession"

363
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They kill those who
are not Muslims...

364
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but they don"t either spare those
who refuse to obey their command

365
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Dissent... they just can"t tolerate

366
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Praise be to Allah the Merciful

367
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
lt"s mentioned in The Holy Koran that
Unbelievers in Allah may be killed...

368
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
...as well as those who do not pray
nor obey the laws of Shariat

369
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You are students

370
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
lt is incumbent upon you to spread
the message of lslam through the world

371
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Kill those who oppose you
in the way of Allah

372
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
"God willing, we shall succeed"

373
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Glory be to Allah"s greatness!

374
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
"Jalil, stop!"

375
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Save me!

376
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Where"ll he go from here!

377
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Save me!

378
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Why"re you killing him?

379
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
No one can come between us!

380
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Save me!

381
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Where are you taking him?
Let him go!

382
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We don"t talk to women.
- You can"t take him away!

383
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
YOU are going to stop ME!

384
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Forgive him. He is a good man

385
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
No! He is not a good man.
He does not pray

386
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Who are you to tell me what to do
and not do?

387
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
l will show you!

388
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
"Stop it, please...
let him go!"

389
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
He does not follow lslam

390
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
He must die!

391
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
l know why they
want to kill me!

392
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
They sell drugs
to buy arms!

393
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They"re hiding arms and explosives
in the mosques!

394
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Move it

395
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Remember my words

396
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
lf the Taliban are
not stopped...

397
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
they"re going to kill us!

398
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
All of us!

399
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
"Mother, where is Sahib Kamal?"

400
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
She"s in the kitchen

401
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
A lady wants to see you.
She"s at the hospital

402
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
She says it"s very important

403
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Greetings

404
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So you are Saira?
- Yes

405
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
"Where are you from?
- Kolkata, lndia"

406
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So we"re from the same country!
- Yes

407
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We share the same fate

408
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You may go now. Come tomorrow

409
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Where do you live
in Afghanistan?

410
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Mohammad Khail. lt"s ten miles away

411
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
l"ve heard a lot about you.
To meet an lndian doctor...

412
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
l"ve travelled a long
distance to you

413
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What is the matter?

414
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
l"m told you want to
return to lndia?

415
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
"Return, l surely will"

416
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
l hope you will succeed.
l need a help from you

417
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
My parents live in Kolkata

418
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
My husband"s brother lbrahim
also lives there

419
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
lf they could have him
caught him Kolkata...

420
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
my in-laws might possibly
send me back

421
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You don"t live here
of your own volition?

422
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
"Neither do l have the money,
nor any support"

423
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
"How will l return,
even if my husband leaves me?"

424
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
l can"t take the physical and
torture they are meting out to me

425
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Doesn"t your husband live with you?

426
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
l fell in love with Nawab.
l went against my family...

427
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and ran away with him
to come here

428
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
He brought me here to this hell

429
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
"For a while, l thought
everything would be all right"

430
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But l...

431
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
couldn"t give Nawab a child.
He got married again

432
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
"l had to give up my own customs,
my way of living..."

433
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to compete with this other woman

434
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What happened after that?

435
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
She bore him a child and Nawab
moved with all of them to Pakistan

436
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
What l didn"t know was that
l too was with baby...

437
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and he"s the father.
- Did you deliver the baby?

438
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
"Yes, l bore the baby. But Nawab says
he has nothing to do with the child"

439
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
"Because of this, you...?"

440
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
"l live here, with my in-laws.
Entirely at their mercy"

441
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
"When they feel like it,
l eat, or go hungry"

442
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
They beat me up.
Somehow or the other...

443
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
if you could reach my
message to my father...

444
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
l could be free again.
My child too

445
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
There are thousands of girls here in
Afghanistan who are cursing their fate

446
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
l must leave now. lt"s very late

447
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Please inform my parents

448
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You know nothing about me Saira.
Nothing

449
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
"What are you doing...?
- Mita, go back to your room"

450
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So you can have
a nice time with her?

451
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
"Go back to your room, Mita"

452
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
How dare you sleep
with my husband...?

453
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
l"m not letting you get
away with your womanising!

454
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
"l say, go away!"

455
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
"Jaanbaz, how can you
sleep with that woman?"

456
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You"re a liar!
You have betrayed me!

457
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Leave me alone! l don"t
want to listen to anything!

458
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
"Quiet, Mita... Quiet!"

459
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
l told you!
Go to your room

460
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Go

461
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You cheat!

462
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Don"t you touch me! Don"t!
- Listen to me...

463
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
l"ve seen it all! My husband was
sleeping with another woman!

464
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
"No! She"s not another woman,
she"s my wife!"

465
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
"Mita, Gulgutti is my wife"

466
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So who am l?

467
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You are the one l love.
- Liar! Shut up!

468
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Hear me out! You know
how much l love you!

469
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
"Love...?
l left my family, my home..."

470
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
"my country... only for
the sake of your love, Jaanbaz"

471
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And what have you done?
You"ve made a mistress out of me!

472
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
A mistress!
- No...

473
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
"you are my wife,
just as she"s my wife!"

474
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
"You are my wife, Mita. My wife.
- No, Jaanbaz"

475
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
l won"t be able
to tolerate all this

476
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
"Mita, have l done anything wrong?
Have l not looked after your comforts?"

477
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Are you a good husband? You"ve been
lying to me all the while. Liar!

478
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Listen to me!
l"m not a liar

479
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And you will now live
like the other women!

480
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You will live in the same room
and sleep on the same bed!

481
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
"No, never!"

482
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
l"ve said what l had to

483
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
lf you don"t obey me...

484
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
"Where are you going, Sahib Kamal?"

485
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
"Jaanbaz, Sahil Kamal
is leaving home"

486
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Where are you going?
- Don"t touch me!

487
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can"t go away like this.
- l"m leaving!

488
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You can"t go away like this!
Have you gone mad?

489
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
"She has gone mad, Abu. Make her
understand she"s leaving her home"

490
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
"No, Sahib Kamal.
You can"t go away"

491
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
No... stop!

492
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
"Uncle Dranai, tell her she"ll spoil
our family name if she leaves home"

493
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
"You go, Jaanbaz"

494
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
l"m not living here anymore! Never!
- Sahib Kamal

495
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Try to understand.
You can"t leave like this

496
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Come with me...

497
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
try to understand
the situation

498
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What are you doing? Are you mad?
- Let me die!

499
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
l can"t live the way
you want me to!

500
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Come with me

501
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You"re doing all this because
Gulgutti is my wife...

502
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
"because we live in the same room.
- No, it"s because l"m your wife..."

503
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and l"m pregnant with your child.
Let me go!

504
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
"Wait, Mita"

505
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Now listen

506
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
l promise not to have anything
to do with Gulgutti anymore

507
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Does that make you happy?
- You"re a cheap and selfish man!

508
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Why must l punish her?
lt"s your fault...

509
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and l"m leaving because of you.
So let me go!

510
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You cheat!

511
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
l had married Jaanbaz. l had
left my house in the hope...

512
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
that l"d have a happy life.
But he betrayed me

513
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
"And l lost my baby too.
My own baby, Mother"

514
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
l don"t know who"s
responsible for this

515
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh my! How lovely you look!

516
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Come

517
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Come... come in

518
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That fertility rites for Gulgutti made
me realise my shortcoming

519
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
l find myself incomplete
and helpless

520
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
"For some strange reason, l have neither
anger nor resentment for Gulgutti"

521
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
That"s perhaps because she"s
carrying the baby of a man...

522
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
l loved dearly

523
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
lt"s perhaps because of this that
l feel a sense of bonding with her

524
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
lt"s also perhaps because she silently
watches all that happens around her...

525
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
she has nothing to
defend herself with

526
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Maybe that is why
l can never hate her

527
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You see how the Taliban
kill anyone without any reason

528
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
lt"s a dangerous situation.
Anything could happen

529
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Where are all the women of the house?

530
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
l don"t accept water
from an infidel!

531
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You infidel!  Kafir!"

532
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
One...two...three

533
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
These grapes are very nice.
- Yes

534
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Eat as much as you can.
- l will

535
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
l think this is the last basket

536
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Four...five...six.
- These are all yours

537
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
What"s all this?
- Grapes

538
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
"l know, but what"s going on?
- Sharing the grapes"

539
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
"2 baskets for my family,
2 for uncle Dranai..."

540
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
"6 baskets uncle Asam"s,
and two for yours"

541
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
"Sure, but why a huge share
for uncle Asam?"

542
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
"Because ours is a large family.
- Bigger the family, bigger the share?"

543
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
"l"m a kafir (lnfidel), and you folks
are pious, aren"t you?"

544
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
"Uncle Asam, uncle Dranai,
my father-in-law..."

545
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and Abu"s husband are brothers

546
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
"So from now on, even the grapes
will be shared equally"

547
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
This is how we share.
- You must change this practice

548
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
lt"d be wise not to change our
family practices. Let them be

549
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
No. The grapes will be
shared equally. l"ll do it
