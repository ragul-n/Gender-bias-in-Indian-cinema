1
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,744
Baloo, what is the news
in your paper today?

2
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,980
A politician disowned his quote.

3
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,015
Says he was asleep when
he said it in Parliament.

4
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,082
How can he deliver
a speech in sleep?

5
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,019
Why not? People watch
films in their sleep!

6
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,023
- Please send me some tea.
- ln a minute.

7
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,058
Here is your favorite..

8
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:42,678
Before you get too busy with
the paper may l remind you..

9
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,289
... that you've called for a
special Board of Directors meeting.

10
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,290
l'd forgotten. l haven't checked
the details ofthe last meeting.

11
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,294
Have you seen my black file?

12
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,310
Not there. lt is here. You kept it
on the other table last night.

13
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,778
Do l live next door
that you must thank me?

14
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,119
Get dressed. Breakfast is ready.

15
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,785
Where's the file ofthe applicants
for the interview you're taking today?

16
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,985
- ln the office.
- What's it doing here?

17
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,991
Last night you wanted my signature.
- You saved me from a lot oftrouble.

18
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,966
Do l live next door
that you thank me?

19
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:44,338
Do you remember the evening's program?
- Yes, shopping at 4.30.

20
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,356
l eat apples not drink them.

21
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,635
Look at this pair!

22
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,499
- Remember the evening program?
- Yes. Bye.

23
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:24,247
Lord! Why did you throw
this beauty in Avinash's lap?

24
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,824
Actually she fell in my lap
but my mind was shut out.

25
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,928
My mind never works at the right time!

26
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,065
Something happens to me
each time l set eyes on her.

27
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:40,069
l get goose pimples!
My heart is set on fire!

28
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,571
- And my ears flare up.
- Same feelings as me.

29
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:46,905
But l can't express them
because ofmy get-up.

30
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:54,150
l'm very confused. On one hand
l feel like embracing this lady..

31
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,881
On the other, l want
to push my wife away!

32
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:02,551
Same as me. God made my
wife on government license.

33
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,959
No, your wife looks
beautiful at times.

34
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,159
- To whom?
- You!

35
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,172
When l got married,
l loved my wife so much..

36
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,241
l'd want to eat her up!

37
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,570
Now l think it would have been
better ifl'd eaten her up!

38
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,437
What did you say?

39
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,446
l said, my wife cooks so well
that l want to eat up her fingers!

40
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:32,522
- And what did you say?
- That l love my darling a lot!

41
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:37,253
Liar! Just as something happens
to your heart on seeing Priti...

42
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:41,126
My heart too beats crazily
when l set eyes on Avinash.

43
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,860
Heart problem? Come to the doctor!

44
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:48,097
Forget the doctor and
hear me carefully...

45
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,404
We'll do just what you do!
We will think exactly like you!

46
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,105
Hear that? Sister, let's go.
This is enough for toady.

47
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,273
Come in, l'll make an ass ofyou!

48
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:02,476
See your piddly moustache!
Avinash has such a good one!

49
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,904
Send in the men for the interview
in the order ofthe applications.

50
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,911
Whatever papers that have to
be signed, do it by 3.30.

51
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,515
The Board of Directors mean
when everyone is raising prices..

52
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,452
Why are we talking ofreducing?

53
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:41,521
We sell milk not face powder.

54
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,131
We earn on every product. Does it
matter ifwe don't make a profit once?

55
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,323
- But..
- No buts..

56
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,532
We are reducing the
price ofmilk products.

57
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,533
The poor kids will bless us.

58
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,534
Ask Mr. Goyal to call for a
board meeting after 3 days.

59
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,543
Call from Madam.

60
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,717
l'm just getting out.
Yes, we'll go in my car.

61
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:13,021
We've got fresh stock
for children's wear.

62
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,926
- How's this for Rohan?
- He likes bright colors.

63
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,927
- How's your child?
- Like my father.

64
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,090
- Like his grandpa.
- This will be nice for Pinki.

65
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,895
- Shall l take it?
- l like what you like.

66
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,368
Pack this.

67
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,569
Father...

68
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,147
- Sister! How are you?
- Very well.

69
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,919
- How is mother?
- Fine.

70
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,392
Don't take it to heart.

71
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:01,401
Come on.

72
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,477
Mother! We saw Priti in the market!

73
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:15,245
- How is she?
- She looked so pretty!

74
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,946
She was in a sparkling
brand new car, Handa!

75
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,419
Honda not Handa.

76
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,960
One who has sold her honor
can travel in a plane too!

77
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,626
Does one talk like this
about his daughter?

78
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,563
What's the fault ofthe poor thing?
- Shut up!

79
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,430
She brought us dishonor!
And you ask what her fault is!

80
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,839
She is dead for us!
And we're dead for her!

81
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:42,308
Henceforth if anyone mentions
her name in this house..

82
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,642
My name will have the word
'late' written before it!

83
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,155
Why haven't mummy and daddy
come as yet?

84
00:09:56,261 --> 00:10:00,459
Maybe it's not yet 5.30.
- Then how did Kunal's mummy come?

85
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,896
Their watch must be running fast.

86
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,104
There come Mummy and Daddy!

87
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,911
Careful, don't get your
hand caught in the door.

88
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,271
- Where did you get so late?
- Working in the office.

89
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,281
- We went to buy you clothes.
- Are we going on a picnic?

90
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,777
- Why?
- You had promised.

91
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,444
When did l make that promise?

92
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,684
Yes l did promise.

93
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,982
Laughing and playing, full oflife..

94
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:58,282
The world oflove,
this world of dreams.

95
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,728
Brought up with love,
a bundle of sugar candy.

96
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:20,468
Chatter filled with love
and sweet melodies of songs.

97
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,806
Papa is a pal and
Mummy is a good friend.

98
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,619
They are the best
parents in the world.

99
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,073
The gardener is happy that
the flowers have blossomed.

100
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,477
My garden is fragrant
with their love.

101
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,099
Why must l ask the world for joys
when my home is filled with it?

102
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,613
l want ice cream, in a big cup!

103
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,621
No, you have a sore throat.
No ice cream for you.

104
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:03,299
- How are you?
- Thank God you remember my name!

105
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:07,336
What does that mean? My
classmate, batch mate, roommate!

106
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,771
That is why you don't inform
me ofyour marriage or kids.

107
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,243
My friend, Babli.

108
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:21,979
l'm no ordinary friend. She'd
spend 25 ofthe 24 hours with me!

109
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,754
Thank goodness l'm no boy or she'd
be spending her life with me not you!

110
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:31,328
- Tell us about yourself.
- l'm still single.

111
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:34,192
Do you have a younger brother?

112
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,327
- When will you come home?
- l'll land up anytime.

113
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:41,131
Here's my card. We'll wait
for you to land up.

114
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:56,083
You teach me the worship very well.

115
00:15:57,055 --> 00:16:01,287
You learn it very well.

116
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,027
Who burst the bomb?

117
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,528
Crackers!

118
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,769
Happy Diwali, friends.

119
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,535
What do you say, friends?
Let's celebrate Happy Diwali.

120
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,841
- What month is this?
- lsn't it February in our calendar?

121
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,850
- Yes.
- Confirmed.

122
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,216
Why is he celebrating Diwali?

123
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,916
l have got a mad husband!

124
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,796
Burst crackers.
lt's Happy Diwali.

125
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,728
Chatterji, today is not Diwali.

126
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:49,203
- Who says so?
- lt's Diwali when you burst crackers.

127
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,202
Am l burning a pyre?

128
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:55,207
Diwali comes in November.

129
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,745
Brother, tell me why does
Diwali come in November?

130
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,512
Weak general knowledge, you see.

131
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:08,156
l'll explain. Rama killed Ravana
and returned to Ayodhya in November.

132
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:13,086
Did Laxman call and tell you
that brother is on his way back?

133
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,864
Not phone, it's printed
in the calendar!

134
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:21,098
What calendar? Was your brother
printing calendars those days?

135
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:26,676
The entire country celebrates
Diwali only in November.

136
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,679
Dilip Kumar, shut up! Wears one
suit and talks nineteen to the dozen!

137
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,714
Does any book say l have to
celebrate with the rest oflndia?

138
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,521
Will the whole country
sleep when l go to sleep?

139
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,718
Will it cry with me?

140
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,022
Will lndia love my wife
because l love her?

141
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,897
Then why should l celebrate
Diwali with the country?

142
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,902
l'll celebrate it when
l have money in my pocket.

143
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,477
What happened?

144
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:30,038
- So...Are you Priti Vyas?
- Yes?

145
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,904
l'll tell you. First come
to the police station.

146
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,578
- Why? - You'll come with me
only when l answer your question.

147
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,449
- Talk to me with respect.
- Shut up, you streetwalker!

148
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,587
Respect! l'll give you
in the police station!

149
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,314
Come on!
- What are you doing?

150
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,852
Quietly sit in the jeep!
Open the door.

151
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,525
- Sit down.
- Why?

152
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,791
l arrest you for soliciting
business without a license.

153
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,298
Sit down. Shut the door.

154
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,440
- The police caught her..
- l knew the girl was wrong.

155
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,280
- You've come at the right time.
- Why?

156
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,357
- The police caught Priti.
- For what?

157
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,016
Prostitution.

158
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,898
- Who arrested you?
- l did.

159
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,234
- l did. So?
- For what crime?

160
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,395
What did you say?

161
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,002
You're attacking an officer on duty!

162
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,006
Stop it! Hitting me
for no reason at all!

163
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:42,975
Beat the man who wrote the report!

164
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,139
- Who filed the complaint?
- Your father!

165
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,588
What insolence!

166
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,861
That's what l'm here for! To ask
you why you vilely accused her!

167
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,072
Look into my eyes and speak
ifyou have the courage!

168
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,607
Then why does she live with you?
Can you explain that to me?

169
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,872
l could but you won't understand.

170
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,942
Because all your life you've
spread muck in the name ofrelations!

171
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,045
Do you know whom you're addressing?

172
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:25,848
A lowly characterless debauch who
regards every woman as loose character

173
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,856
You probably forget
that l'm your father.

174
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,792
l wish l could forget
that you are my father.

175
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:43,439
Don't assume l'll return home
ifyou take Priti away from me.

176
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,301
lfyou ever try such
cheap stunts again..

177
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,448
l won't even come to
light your funeral pyre!

178
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,063
- How are you, my son?
- Fine. - Come in.

179
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,798
Not now. l'm in a rush.

180
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,474
- Angry with your mother?
- No, l can't be mad at you.

181
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,870
l'll come later. See you.

182
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,088
Lord, send my child
back home and soon.

183
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,896
Please control yourself.

184
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,099
lfl say l understand your
sorrow, it would be wrong.

185
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,701
Because the person who undergoes
it only can understand it.

186
00:21:56,414 --> 00:22:00,282
lfl ask you not to cry, you'll
cry even more. So l won't say it.

187
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:06,014
But l will say this, those
who don't fear themselves..

188
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,522
society fears only them.

189
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,256
They try to frighten them
and are cruel to them.

190
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,631
One can understand Sita's tears
when Rama accused her.

191
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,567
But Sita crying when Ravana
accuses her is totally wrong!

192
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:27,210
lfthere's any hope for this
society crushed under hoods..

193
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,743
lt's a few people like yourself.

194
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:34,308
lfyou lose courage, the truth
will lose and falsehood will win!

195
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,033
What's going on? l asked
your neighbors your address...

196
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,669
And they looked at me
as ifl was an untouchable!

197
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:57,933
Did your father-in-law accuse you
ofprostitution and have you arrested?

198
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:04,881
The family where nobody drank water
till they completed the prayers..

199
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,574
The daughter ofthat house
is accused ofthis blasphemy!

200
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,913
What is the truth? Tell me!

201
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,025
Help me!

202
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,544
Why doesn't anyone help him?

203
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,818
Master Parmanand, you filed
a complaint against me?

204
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:54,094
l just took over your plot.
l didn't demolish a temple or mosque.

205
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,624
But the plot was for
a children's school.

206
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:01,294
Why should they study?
What have you achieved?

207
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,598
You're just a schoolmaster!

208
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,298
l'll go to the highest level!

209
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:10,380
You will go up. Up there!

210
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,846
Just as you hit the kids with a cane..

211
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,852
l use knives on people.

212
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,612
What's going on?

213
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,085
What are you standing by for?
Quickly help me.

214
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,354
Help me take him to the car.
Have courage...

215
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,369
- What's up? Who is this man?
- Somebody stabbed him.

216
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:11,966
Gently. Carefully..

217
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,805
Did anybody see him being stabbed?

218
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,250
Where are you going?

219
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:24,753
Such a grave incident occurred.
And nobody is willing to testify!

220
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,985
Doesn't anyone have the guts?
Did nobody see him being stabbed?

221
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,388
l saw it, sir.

222
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,832
- Lock the rascal up!
- Sir! Are you wonky?

223
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,467
Without any evidence or witness,
you're locking up Bhavani Choudhry?

224
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,606
Shut up! There's the eyewitness!

225
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,277
You had the whole city terrorized?

226
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,779
Now thanks to this girl,
you'll rot in prison!

227
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,624
Thank you, sir.
Now may l leave?

228
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:03,625
You've done a wonderful job!

229
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:14,365
l ask, who are you?
Rani Laxmibai ofJhansi?

230
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,030
Why did you complain against a
lethal hood in the police station?

231
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,309
Hundreds were standing there. When
nobody went, why did you act brave?

232
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:24,572
We're doomed if
everyone thinks like this.

233
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,774
l'll break your head
ifyou talk nonsense!

234
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,252
Those who kill a man openly,
can't they get into your house..

235
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,118
...and kill you, me,
your mother and sisters?

236
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,659
Then your idealism won't save us.

237
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:40,659
Go right back to the police
station and take back the complaint.

238
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,730
l can't do this.

239
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,729
What are you doing? Will you
thrash your adult daughter?

240
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:53,275
Knock some sense into her head
or her idealism will ruin us!

241
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:03,682
Since we got married,
you're only doing night duty!

242
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:09,555
How do l explain to you? A night
watchman does duty only at night.

243
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:13,060
lfl don't do my duty, somebody's
house could be broken into.

244
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,823
Somebody could lose their honor.

245
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,899
ls that so? Then hurry!

246
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:23,703
Go on! Come back
early in the morning.

247
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:30,714
Yes, l will. l'll sleep all day
and follow it with night duty.

248
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,596
l'm coming!

249
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,296
l'm coming...

250
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,399
l like you when you do this.

251
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:04,505
That is why l've given you
my heart, soul and wealth!

252
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,140
No, l don't want all three.

253
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,817
Keep your heart, give
your soul to your husband.

254
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,923
And give me the wealth.

255
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,490
What are you doing?

256
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:28,503
Every artist does a prayer before
starting a program. l'm doing that.

257
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:44,786
- Great music!
- No! That's my husband's bike!

258
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,202
Where do l hide? Ah! The window.

259
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,143
lron grills!

260
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:21,157
l took the stick but
forgot the pistol.

261
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:25,027
What are you doing here?

262
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:45,011
Strange! Why is he
walking round my wife's bed?

263
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,843
Wake up.

264
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,856
What's he doing here?

265
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,524
That's my line. You answer it.

266
00:29:55,693 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes! The neighbors
told me he sleep walks.

267
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,965
Once he walked right
up to the railway station.

268
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,660
And landed up at Poona!

269
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:11,672
Thank God he didn't go to the
railway track or he'd be up!

270
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,035
- ln his sleep!
- Yes.

271
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,739
But tell me, why are you
sleeping with the door open?

272
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:24,881
l thought you might return early
so l kept the door open.

273
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,954
l'll escort him home before
he falls asleep right here.

274
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,527
Thank goodness l came
home for the pistol.

275
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,894
Or l'd never have found
out about Muthu's illness.

276
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:38,635
Cap..

277
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,530
You walk quite slowly in your sleep.

278
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:46,774
What's wrong with him?
Let's go find out.

279
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:54,446
- What's wrong with Pillai?
- He sleep walks.

280
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,715
He was walking around my wife's bed.

281
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:02,414
l'm going to drop him home.
Pillai..come this way.

282
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,456
This man scrambled my brains.

283
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,726
How did Pillai get this illness?

284
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,063
What's wrong with Muthu?

285
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:19,407
How funny! Don't you know
what's wrong with him?

286
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,943
Like a good wife,
you should take care ofhim.

287
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,946
Such husbands are difficult to find.

288
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,614
Laughing in his sleep.

289
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,454
Since when have you
contracted this illness?

290
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,131
- lt was nice meeting you.
- l'll see you later.

291
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,168
- You..?
- Came to meet a friend.

292
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,176
- And you?
- l live here.

293
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:00,784
Careful...

294
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:05,153
What happened to the man
you took to the hospital?

295
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,586
He was saved because he
reached hospital in good time.

296
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,723
How mercilessly the hoods beat him up!

297
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,660
l would have broken the
limbs ofthe hood!

298
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,197
The police must be doing that.

299
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,161
- Who told the police about them?
- l did.

300
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,037
You testified against him?

301
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,473
You're very brave!

302
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:31,413
You need courage to lie
not speak the truth.

303
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,245
Very well said.
And it is right.

304
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:41,481
Silly, we're talking for so long
yet don't know each other's names.

305
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,153
l'm Priti.
l work in a private firm.

306
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:46,492
l sell milk.

307
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,333
At this let me serve you some tea.

308
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:57,373
- You will make it?
- There's nobody else at home.

309
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,705
There are servants. lfyou
prefer they can make it.

310
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:02,705
- Some other time.
- Because l live alone?

311
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,707
No...it's quite late.

312
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,683
- lt's going to rain so...
- l'll drop you.

313
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,118
No, l'll take a rickshaw.

314
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,063
What are you doing?

315
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,809
- Let go ofmy child!
- Dagdu, take a look..

316
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,737
What skinny soft legs this baby has...

317
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,241
And the fingers..
like fresh ladyfingers.

318
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,679
- Shall l crack them?
- No!

319
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,985
l beg you! Please don't harm my son!

320
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,217
l'll testify as you wish!

321
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,528
No, Choudhry didn't wound me.

322
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,968
Are you saying this
under some pressure?

323
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,773
When l heard you've arrested an
innocent man, l came here to save him.

324
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,915
l'd like to know how
you got these wounds.

325
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,611
A truck hit me from behind.
lt had protruding iron rods.

326
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,313
The truck rammed you from behind
yet you have wounds on the chest.

327
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,856
Sir, please ask him later
about how and where...

328
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,789
First get my brother out.

329
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,264
Bless me, brother.

330
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:39,806
Sir, after violence and bloodshed...

331
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,741
..to tackle the cops
in a legal manner...

332
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,279
My younger brother is learning law.

333
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,284
Wish him.

334
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,515
- Don't you want to go home?
- l'll take time. You go ahead.

335
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,816
Move out fast. lt will rain hard.

336
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,839
Priti has come back!

337
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:48,329
What happened, my child?

338
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,266
What went wrong?

339
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,288
Good God!

340
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,899
Pour as much water as you want!

341
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:23,303
The muck will be washed away
not the stigma!

342
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:28,311
Why are you hurting her more?

343
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,914
Can you only see her hurt?
Can't you see my destruction?

344
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:43,057
l'm an ordinary man who lives by
offering prayers in this temple.

345
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:49,393
Now we have no face to
show even our relatives!

346
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:55,327
l didn't have impossible
dreams or aspirations.

347
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,068
l, the father ofthree
daughters only desired...

348
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,645
Somehow l wanted to accumulate
money and marry them off.

349
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,144
That was my aim in life!

350
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,148
But now that's impossible!

351
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:15,086
When the world finds out
that she has shamed herself..

352
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,625
To whom will l tie her off?.

353
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:23,031
Father, why are you scolding
sister? What's her fault?

354
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:28,027
The fault is not yours either
but you too will be punished.

355
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,965
No proposals will come
for you because ofher.

356
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:36,375
All your life both ofyou
will sit here, unmarried!

357
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:43,618
And society will kill us alive!

358
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:50,184
Everyone will raise a finger...
there goes Tulsi Ram Dayal.

359
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:56,696
He used to narrate the Lord's story
Today he can't narrate his own!

360
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,607
Where are you going?

361
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:54,120
Father's talks made me feel there's
no place for me in this house.

362
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:58,250
My leaving will set things right.

363
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,259
There won't be any obstacle
for Rupa and Geeta's wedding.

364
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,496
Let her go! l'm glad
you said it yourself.

365
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,195
Or l would have to ask
you to leave my house.

366
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,035
What are you saying?

367
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,472
l'm saying what is right.

368
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:18,478
lfher leaving helps others
settle down, it is proper.

369
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,242
But where will the poor thing go?

370
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,510
East, West, North, South.
All the directions lie before her.

371
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,383
She may go where she pleases.
We want no relation with her!

372
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,793
Oblige us by never
stepping in this house!

373
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,218
- Why the bags?
- l need your help.

374
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:00,914
- Yes?
- Can l stay with you for some days?

375
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,524
Why not? You can stay for
some months. Come on in.

376
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,254
- Consider it your own house.
- She will do that.

377
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,194
But do you have any idea what
people will consider our home?

378
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,359
You said she could stay here but
has she said why she's come here?

379
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:18,265
Your friend has sealed her lips
but papers will print news.

380
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,104
She is being praised.
She has been raped!

381
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:31,910
Her family threw her out
and got rid ofthe nuisance.

382
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,954
You may turn your
house into an orphanage.

383
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,854
But hoods and thugs
will come here at night!

384
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,895
There are special places for women
like you. Why don't you go there?

385
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:49,698
lsn't she the same girl
who was raped last night?

386
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:56,745
Come and see the girl
who was raped last night.

387
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,916
How dare she come to the colony
where respected people like us live?

388
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,182
- Yes?
- l'll tell you!

389
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:13,762
No man dare touch a woman
without her permission!

390
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,400
By touching a woman not belonging
to him, a man can be burnt to death!

391
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:21,997
Let a man touch a woman and
he'll burn like a cinder!

392
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,411
What are you doing?

393
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,417
l was checking whether
l'd burn to cinder or not.

394
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,016
Turn to ashes..
But nothing happened.

395
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:45,628
That means none ofyou women
is true to her husband, correct?

396
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,129
You're being insolent!

397
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,966
No, l'm showing you the truth!

398
00:42:55,672 --> 00:43:00,632
l well know which woman knocks at
which door once her husband is away!

399
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:07,245
lfl open up and divulge how many
married, single girls flirt with me..

400
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:09,442
8 out of10 homes here will break up!

401
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:12,045
You won't tell them anything
but will abuse this girl who..

402
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,746
Who is already distressed!

403
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,056
But she too must have
tried to flirt with him.

404
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,124
That's how she lost her honor!

405
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:24,389
Who said that? Who..?

406
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,503
Who spoke about honor?

407
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,801
- Come up front and speak!
- lt was me.

408
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,841
You spoke ofhonor?

409
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,411
You left your husband
only because he is bald?

410
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,913
And now you look for
part time friends in clubs?

411
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,419
Don't make a mockery
ofthe word, honor!

412
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,159
lt's not a necklace given to the
wife or certificate from college!

413
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:54,694
lt's no jewelry that you hide
in the locker and can lose!

414
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,296
Honor is only related to the heart.

415
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:01,426
Nobody loses honor
when they are raped.

416
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:03,899
Nor is it saved by
wrapping a nine-yard sari!

417
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,374
For honor, you need shame.
Of self-esteem, purity ofthe heart.

418
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,818
We consider Draupadi a sati
though she had 5 husbands!

419
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,885
And you..! You refuse to give
refuge to this guileless girl!

420
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,322
Only so that your colony
doesn't get a bad name!

421
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,725
We are family men. We have
to live in this society.

422
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:32,162
lfyou don't care about society,
take her to your own house!

423
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,064
Yes! That's just what l'll do!

424
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,235
She will stay in my house!
For as long as she desires!

425
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,339
Everyone hear this loud and clear!

426
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:46,347
Henceforth if anyone
talks nonsense to her ...

427
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:49,747
l won't dishonor you
but l will kill you!

428
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:54,547
Come with me.

429
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:31,919
Look, now please don't cry.

430
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,798
Why are you crying?
Society is always unjust.

431
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,467
Somebody commits the crime
and somebody else gets punished.

432
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,398
Take yourself... you are crying
at somebody else's mistake.

433
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,799
This too is injustice, isn't it?

434
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:53,805
No. no. Please. All right, cry.
Do what you think is right.

435
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,623
- ls the food ready?
- Yes sir.

436
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,559
Put my briefcase in the car.

437
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,857
There's some good hot food.
Eat something.

438
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,865
l'm getting late.
l must make a move.

439
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:12,893
- Remember what you have
to tell Aunt? - Yes, Dad.

440
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,911
The bowl is empty.

441
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,385
- So is the plate.
- Aunt hasn't eaten anything.

442
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,523
Maybe she's not feeling well.

443
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,125
Aunt, please eat something.

444
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,527
Daddy said he'd reward us with
2 chocolates ifwe make you eat.

445
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:57,400
So please eat something.

446
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:29,164
Tell me why are you sad?
Why is every joy less?

447
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:38,972
Tell me why your eyes
are moist all the time?

448
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:50,320
For what crime have
you been punished?

449
00:48:55,665 --> 00:49:04,733
Tell me what is the relation
ofpain and the heart.

450
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:15,647
For what crime have
you been punished?

451
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:51,046
The atrocity you underwent..

452
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:55,723
....was the sin of another.

453
00:49:56,226 --> 00:50:03,064
What is your fault in this?

454
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:14,476
The one who was ill treated
is being punished..

455
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:21,746
...in which book is this right?

456
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,484
Why do you cover your
head with accusations?

457
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:32,019
Whereas here you are
the one blameless.

458
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:38,453
The woman who bears everything..

459
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:43,158
..who bows her head
and keeps quiet...

460
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:50,429
This is the custom ofthe world.

461
00:51:53,009 --> 00:52:01,644
You break this custom and tradition.

462
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:08,987
That is the way to cure the world.

463
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,695
Why do you weep?

464
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,860
Why do you live in sorrow?

465
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:20,926
Why are your eyes filled
with the smoke of sadness?

466
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:12,616
- Are you Priti Vyas,
of Meena Katra? - Yes.

467
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:15,187
Alas! Your life too
is ruined, sister!

468
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,186
The moment we found
that you'd been raped...

469
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,819
We were filled with as much
sorrow as ifwe had been raped.

470
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,463
Who are you?

471
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:27,192
We have come from the
Rights ofWomen Association.

472
00:53:29,138 --> 00:53:32,005
Sister, you must come
with us right now.

473
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,665
- Where?
- To Parliament House.

474
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,335
- Why?
- On a hunger strike.

475
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:41,142
We'll take out a procession from
Connaught Place to Tughlaq Road.

476
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,286
Then we'll sit right in front of
Parliament and go on hunger strike.

477
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,780
That's where we've called the press.

478
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,889
You don't have to worry.
We're with you.

479
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,120
We'll fight for you and
get you 100% justice!

480
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,161
How will you get her justice?

481
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,530
- Who are you?
- Yes?

482
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:03,530
l'm the one in whose house
you are presently standing.

483
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,865
So tell me, how will
you get her justice?

484
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,840
The government will have
to apologize to her.

485
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,537
And give her justice.

486
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,216
That's fine but how will that happen?

487
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:22,124
Some compensation? Or will you
find her a home or a sewing machine?

488
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,722
So she can earn herself a living.

489
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,896
Or get her some cash?
A lakh? 5 lakhs? How much?

490
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:30,258
You are being very insolent!

491
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,431
You are being insolent to yourself.

492
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,797
Quiet, you English woman!

493
00:54:37,306 --> 00:54:39,900
Today she needs people
who will give her courage.

494
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:44,771
She will somehow live her life.
lfyou let her live. But no...

495
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:48,074
You want to take out processions,
stop traffic. That's what you'll do!

496
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:53,011
You want her wounds to resurface.
You will take pictures with her!

497
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:57,252
Publish them in the press so that
you become famous and she, infamous!

498
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:01,187
Today only one area knows this
incident. Tomorrow it'll be the city!

499
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:05,225
After seeing her picture, every
man will point fingers at her.

500
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:08,097
Every thug will consider
her public property!

501
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,105
Everyone will make fun ofher!
ls this your justice?

502
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,038
Mr. ifyou want to be sarcastic..
why did you let this be printed?

503
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,375
- You should have barred it!
- Let's go, sisters.

504
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,916
Not the time to do any good!

505
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,391
Girl from Meena Katra raped.

506
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,067
What..? Why are you beating me?

507
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,000
What is this you've written?

508
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:45,163
What's wrong in that? A rape
took place and l've printed it.

509
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:48,138
So that the girl is maligned some
more, has to bear more humiliation?

510
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,279
Can you tell me the
benefit ofthis news?

511
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,404
Who are you to ask me this?

512
00:55:57,386 --> 00:56:01,152
A common man who reads your paper!
You have a responsibility towards me.

513
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,717
Publish news that
will help the readers.

514
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,828
Write about the thieving leaders
so that the voters become aware.

515
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:11,030
Write about the asses in the fodder
scam so the public doesn't get conned!

516
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:16,198
But ifyou don't want to be true
to your duty and only sell news..

517
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:20,933
Then write which heroine uses
what brand of soap and bra!

518
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:28,442
Ripping bruises of a traumatized
girl is sadism not journalism!

519
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,944
You're not selling a spicy dish!

520
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:49,068
- We're going.
- Where to?

521
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:53,074
Our break is over. We're going
back to the boarding school.

522
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:57,144
- But you don't be sad.
- Yes, don't be sad.

523
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,577
We'll be back next Saturday.

524
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,087
You'll get bored all alone at home.
Why don't you go back to work?

525
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:18,096
l did call up but my
infamy had reached them.

526
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,630
They've fired me.

527
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,802
But you don't worry.
Soon l'll go away.

528
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,503
Meet Jojo at this address.
He'll look after you.

529
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,126
Welcome, madam.

530
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:52,200
Come and sit down.
Not there. That's your place.

531
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:56,967
From today you are the
General Manager ofthis company.

532
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:02,740
Why? Didn't Avinash tell you?
This company and this office is his.

533
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:08,248
He or l sit in this
chair that lies vacant.

534
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,682
But from today you will sit here.

535
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:18,823
No, don't worry about me. l'll go
back to standing behind Avinash.

536
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,129
But now you don't stand.
Go and sit down right away.

537
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,584
Please press this suit
with care and cautiousness.

538
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,583
l know that you
have only one suit.

539
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:49,519
You press men are very
quick with retorts.

540
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:54,129
Prince Salim, can l borrow your suit
for 2 hours, for my nephew wedding.

541
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,198
What a lousy man!
Don't you have a suit?

542
00:58:57,366 --> 00:59:00,096
l have it but my nephew
who's getting married doesn't.

543
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:04,467
This suit ofmine is not meant
for lousy ceremonies like marriages.

544
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,272
- ls it for mourning?
- This is no petty suit.

545
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:15,610
Dilip Kumar wore a similar suit in the
film, Andaz, when he is jilted in love.

546
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:19,551
Dharmendra took offhis shirt thrice
for Meena Kumari in Phool Aur Pathar.

547
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,952
Can't you give me one suit?

548
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,353
Forget it. We don't
need the suit now.

549
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:28,327
Why? Will he climb atop
the horse in his vest?

550
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:31,557
We just received a call the girl
he was to marry has eloped!

551
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,635
What an unlucky suit. l asked for
it and the marriage broke off!

552
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,637
Then why do you ask for it?

553
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,716
Your car is as pretty as you.

554
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:57,049
Didn't l tell you madam's
face is that of a beauty queen?

555
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:00,387
- When did you tell me?
- l did tell somebody.

556
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:04,757
l was wrong when l
spoke abut you that day.

557
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,027
Actually l slipped on a
banana peel in my childhood.

558
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,073
Since then my tongue gives me the slip

559
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:15,641
Don't drag it. Get
your apology over with.

560
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:19,508
- Please forgive me.
- lt's all right.

561
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,673
That's done. Now get
the application out.

562
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:25,620
My wife's brother is very lazy.

563
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,621
Even ifhe's running a race
alone, he'll be second.

564
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:33,694
lfyou give him a job in
your company, l'll thank you.

565
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:38,557
- l'll talk to Mr. Avinash.
- Job's done. He can't refuse her.

566
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:42,363
That's right. You are
GM in Avinash' company.

567
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,870
l felt that you've become
the PM ofthe nation!

568
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,439
You must be tired after this
buttering up. Let her rest now.

569
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,712
- You, your car, everything
is pretty.. - Come on, enough..

570
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:01,245
Did you see? The moment
you became General Manager..

571
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,824
..these people started
noticing and respecting you.

572
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:09,526
These days people only
see how successful you are.

573
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:14,528
And now how you achieved success.
They only salute the rising sun.

574
01:01:14,703 --> 01:01:16,534
This is life.

575
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:25,412
Just as their honor is hollow and
false, so was their abuse that day.

576
01:01:26,882 --> 01:01:31,876
That is why l want you to forget
your old life. Live with new vigor.

577
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:48,502
Always keep smiling like these flowers

578
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,980
- You..?
- No, it's Sachin Tendulkar.

579
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,821
l thought it must be the kids.

580
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,583
- l think you've grown attached
to the kids. - They are precocious.

581
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:15,856
- But you didn't tell me anything.
- About what?

582
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:20,900
lfyou're not married, who are
these kids who call you Daddy?

583
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:25,673
- Do you have to know?
- Yes.

584
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:29,403
They are actually the result
ofmy respected fathers' lust.

585
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,941
Then l was living with
my parents in their house.

586
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:39,452
One day a lady Uma Atre cabled me.

587
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,623
...to meet her in
Sadar Hospital immediately.

588
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,028
- ls Uma Atre in this ward?
- Yes, right there.

589
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:56,633
l don't think you know me..

590
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,504
You used to be my
Daddy's personal secretary.

591
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,409
l also used to be his
illegitimate wife!

592
01:03:05,814 --> 01:03:11,446
He gave me these two kids as a bonus.

593
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:23,126
l won't lie on my deathbed!
At that moment, l was furious.

594
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:27,098
l wanted the kids to get their rights.

595
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:36,003
But today l don't want my kids
to beg on the roads for food!

596
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,208
No, don't talk like this..

597
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,388
Water?

598
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:10,906
Can l help you?

599
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:17,908
- Where would these kids be?
- lt's the kids under the tree.

600
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,099
From where did you pick up
these kids? Who are they?

601
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:14,639
Do you have so many kids in the
city that you can't recognize them?

602
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:16,811
Talk to me with respect!
l am your father!

603
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:20,413
l know but l don't know of a
better way to talk with a Dad...

604
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:22,516
...who can't recognize his children!

605
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,652
What nonsense!
Are you out ofyou mind?

606
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:26,650
Yes l am out ofmy mind!

607
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:31,019
l found what you're doing at an age
when you should play with grand kids.

608
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,922
l am out ofmy mind since then!

609
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,994
The mother ofthese kids
breathed her last in my arms

610
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,657
...after naming you. Since
then l am losing my mind!

611
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,666
These kids are
yours and Uma Atre's.

612
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,908
l don't know any Uma Atre.

613
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:51,877
You know her very well!
You employed her as a secretary.

614
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,810
But used her for something else.

615
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,975
This is a bunch oflies!
What evidence do you have?

616
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:59,052
l have no evidence that l'm your
son except that mother says it?

617
01:05:59,254 --> 01:06:03,213
Shut up you impudent oaf!
Throw these kids out!

618
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,855
They will stay with you in your house!

619
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:08,791
My house in not an orphanage!

620
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,956
Nobody can stay there without my
permission, not even you! Get that?

621
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,026
All right. l too am leaving.

622
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,868
Avinash, stop!

623
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:24,603
Call me only when you are
willing to accept these kids.

624
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,055
Does your mother know all this?

625
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:40,992
This country has many Sitas
who consider their husbands Rama.

626
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:47,865
l don't want to disillusion
mother and give her sorrow.

627
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,861
Hence l am quiet.

628
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,202
And the kids...

629
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,072
They do not know the difference
between a brother and a father.

630
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,207
Since they are conscious,
they consider me Daddy.

631
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,378
The poor unfortunate kids...

632
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,882
They were neither destined a
mother's love nor a fathers'.

633
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:25,568
Statue will be over only when you
call me mummy instead of aunty.

634
01:07:28,877 --> 01:07:31,846
lfyou can do the duty of
a father without being one..

635
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,949
Then why can't l give them the love
of a mother without being a mother?

636
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:02,300
So neither is Avinash your husband
your Pinki and Rohan your kids?

637
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:07,810
Yet you all live together
so happily in one house?

638
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:12,381
What a fantastic relation!
A unique bond.

639
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:17,149
When did you come?

640
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:25,030
To date l had only heard of
men who treat women like a shoe.

641
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,398
l have heard and seen men
who bash even burn women.

642
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:35,066
For the first time l see a man
who understands and respects women.

643
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:41,576
That day when l asked you
if Avinash had a brother...

644
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,913
Why didn't you tell me
he himselfis a bachelor?

645
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:52,182
Because now it's too late.
l'm getting married!

646
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:55,387
Here's my invitation card!
You must come.

647
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:01,862
- l'm here!
- The card isn't coming and he's come!

648
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,335
He's upset my mind.
Let's get rid ofhim.

649
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:11,005
- You play cards in the day?
- Yes. We don't walk in our sleep.

650
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:13,674
- What do you mean?
- lt's clear.

651
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:19,014
We play cards in the day. Don't
you play sleep walking at night?

652
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,449
You are right. l'm
very ill these days.

653
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:28,961
l can't go for morning walks.
No evening walks.

654
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:33,033
So l walk in the nights!

655
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,237
- Cough away from me!
- Even my wife said the same.

656
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:40,568
Even the guard's wife says the same.

657
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:46,043
- What does she say?
- That you walk round her bed.

658
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:50,511
Why are you worried
about whatever l do?

659
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,382
l'm going away and
l'll never return!

660
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:57,023
He considers himselfvery smart.

661
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,118
What a lousy man he is!

662
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:04,061
The guard's house is not a
park where he goes for walks!

663
01:10:04,566 --> 01:10:07,262
He makes it out there
and our sleep is ruined!

664
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,633
We have to cook up a
scheme and expose him!

665
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:55,145
A 500 rupee note...by itself..

666
01:10:55,348 --> 01:10:58,681
He'll pick up the note
at 1 second after 12.

667
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:02,755
And he will be exposed
at 2 seconds after 12.

668
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:08,016
A cute gift for Pyari.

669
01:11:17,737 --> 01:11:20,672
- What's he doing?
- Rolling it up.

670
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:28,106
He's happily scratching his ears.

671
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:35,586
He's scratching his teeth.

672
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:43,462
No...no...

673
01:11:45,498 --> 01:11:47,762
Forged note printed in Pakistan.

674
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:53,899
- l told you he's too smart!
- He tore my 500-rupee note!

675
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:58,032
- l had to pay the kids' fees.
- But you have no kids.

676
01:11:58,211 --> 01:12:00,805
l will have them someday.
l have to start planning.

677
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:05,477
Have Avinash sir and Priti
madam really come so close?

678
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:09,686
Close? Closer than Close Up.
Everyone needs it.

679
01:12:11,624 --> 01:12:15,958
Priti works for his company here
and gives him company at home.

680
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:31,503
Send Jojo in.

681
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:37,382
- Did you send for me?
- l called for you.

682
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:40,576
- What's the whispering in the office?
- That's bound to happen.

683
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:43,984
Everyone can clearly see that
you're very liberal with Priti.

684
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:50,319
So they feel you are Priti
have a romantic liaison.

685
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:55,935
Who says so? Tell me his name!

686
01:12:56,035 --> 01:12:59,004
- What will you do?
- Kill them! l'll kill them!

687
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:02,335
Fine, they work for you but that's
what the city is buzzing with.

688
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:10,845
lfl marry her..?

689
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,552
Then everyone's mouth will be shut!

690
01:13:15,755 --> 01:13:19,555
Don't delay a good deed.
Do it right away!

691
01:13:55,194 --> 01:14:02,396
Do you realize..?

692
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:10,602
This is something special.

693
01:14:11,811 --> 01:14:19,411
Your heart lies with me.

694
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:27,619
My heart is with you.

695
01:15:31,591 --> 01:15:39,362
Why does the light feel silken?

696
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:47,834
The moon flits like a song
through the breeze.

697
01:15:48,141 --> 01:15:55,513
The light touched you
and turned silken.

698
01:15:56,482 --> 01:16:04,514
My heart beats with the breeze.

699
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:13,224
There are many enticing
emotions in the heart.

700
01:16:13,933 --> 01:16:21,738
There is an unspoken
thirst awakening within.

701
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:28,806
The clouds have
come down to the river.

702
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:37,341
Birds start chirping in the trees.

703
01:17:37,884 --> 01:17:45,620
lfyou are my companion,
then oh partner ofmy life..

704
01:17:46,325 --> 01:17:53,629
l find every place
a scenic beauty.

705
01:17:55,635 --> 01:18:03,303
The destinations have
merged with the paths.

706
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:11,648
All the dreams have come true
each hope is fulfilled.

707
01:19:24,724 --> 01:19:27,921
l've been waiting for long.
The car came yet you're standing out..

708
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:33,830
- Actually. l want to talk to you.
- Yes..?

709
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:37,197
Nothing important but the
staffin the office is talking...

710
01:19:37,703 --> 01:19:42,731
Stupid talk about you and me..
We must shut them up.

711
01:19:42,975 --> 01:19:47,742
And this could be one way...
We could get married.

712
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:06,561
Please don't degrade me so much.

713
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:09,201
l've taken too much
advantage ofyour goodness.

714
01:20:10,202 --> 01:20:11,965
What haven't you done for me?

715
01:20:12,872 --> 01:20:16,774
Saved me from the humiliation
ofthe world, gave me refuge...

716
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:20,775
A job, the self esteem
and position l had lost..

717
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,141
You gave me back everything.

718
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:29,278
l can see even ifthe world can't,
how you keep obliging me.

719
01:20:31,924 --> 01:20:36,793
But l can't bear the thought
that you marry me out ofmercy!

720
01:20:37,763 --> 01:20:41,665
- No, l really love you..
- No!

721
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:48,168
l respect you a lot.
l worship you as l would a God.

722
01:20:50,242 --> 01:20:52,676
lt's acceptable to
worship God in a temple.

723
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:56,509
But wanting a place
beside Him is not.

724
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,483
l'm not worthy ofyou.

725
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,012
Please don't say such
a thing to me again.

726
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:07,153
l beg ofyou!

727
01:21:16,235 --> 01:21:19,466
l proposed to you without
knowing your feelings.

728
01:21:20,139 --> 01:21:21,299
Forgive me.

729
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:26,602
l respect you even more
after hearing this.

730
01:21:29,081 --> 01:21:32,710
lfyou had accepted,
l might have thought..

731
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:35,581
Maybe you agreed because
you feel burdened by my help.

732
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:41,248
Forget and forgive. Okay?

733
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:48,732
We were friends. We are friends
and we'll remain friends.

734
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:04,541
You are both still at home? Are
you coming or do l stop the wedding?

735
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,014
We're just leaving.

736
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:11,651
Begin.
