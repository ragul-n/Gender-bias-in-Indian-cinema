1
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,000
"Misdeeds I have done, I do and will do.
Wicked, I am. Sin, is in my nature."

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,120
"Whatever misdeeds I may do,
to accept me, is in God's nature."

3
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,660
"Anytime I see a wilted crop,
I wither, too.", says Vallalar.

4
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,040
Even a small being like a fly or an ant
has a meaningful life!

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,500
It has a father, mother,
spouse and children, too!

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,660
God will not tolerate
the unnecessary killing of these beings!

7
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,200
Let there be the light of life!

8
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,950
If we live by the ways of Saint Vallalar,
we will have eternal life!

9
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,790
'Let there be the light of life!'

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,580
It has a father, mother,
spouse and children, too!

11
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,370
'Without a hint of intolerance...'

12
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,200
'Considering all life
precious as one's own life...'

13
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:51,950
'Delighting in bestowing equally
one's goodwill on all...'

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,370
In such a person's heart,
the epitome of wisdom, Lord Shiva...

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
...dwells to perform his cosmic dance,
I realize.

16
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,870
Your respect for such small life forms,
will earn you all riches in life!

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,790
What is your name, my boy?

18
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,910
Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai!

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,080
You were right, Anjanam!

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,370
A transformer near the Amman temple
broke down!

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Very well.
Please fix it.

22
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,830
Marry a man in the electricity board
and you'll never have a power cut!

23
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,040
Get his phone number!

24
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,330
He works in Chennai, right?

25
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,580
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,830
Great that you have links
in our EB office, too!

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm from Thanjavur, too!
Worked here for three years!

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,290
Is that so?

29
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong?
-The call isn't going through!

30
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,370
She said she'd return at three
when she left home.

31
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,370
How long have you been in Chennai?

32
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,290
Just two or three years!

33
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,410
Isn't that right?

34
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,250
No... it's been eight years!

35
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,080
I've given my Facebook profile.
Check it out!

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,290
You can learn everything about me!

37
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,410
That's not it!
Got your own house, right?

38
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,450
No...
-No? It is better if you buy one!

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,950
We'll discuss this with our daughter
and let you know.

40
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,870
What is this, son?
We haven't even seen the girl!

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,410
Let's just leave, mom.

42
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,330
I'll take your leave.
Thank you very much.

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,790
Hello, boss.
The bill, voucher and collection.

44
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,200
See you tomorrow.
-Alright. Get going.

45
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,700
The cops are coming!
Don't get caught!

46
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,450
Hey!
You waste quite a lot of water!

47
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,080
"Lot of water"?
Like we even get any!

48
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,910
Indeed! How much do I struggle
for water?

49
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,660
I have it dug up to 1,000 feet!

50
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,080
What's the big idea
wasting so much water?

51
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,160
I ask you a question
and you're just leaving!

52
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,580
I'm talking to you
and you're taking off!

53
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,330
You're going to pull fuses, right?
Go right ahead!

54
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,580
You're here, Anjanam?
Water pouring in your house, huh?

55
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,160
She's telling me not to waste a lot of it!

56
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,160
It flows as thin as piss!

57
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,660
Find another house!

58
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,040
The bride's family
always asks if I own a house.

59
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,450
Hey, I just remembered!
What happened this time?

60
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,290
Why even ask?

61
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,410
Before, the girls would look at me
and reject.

62
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,910
Now, they run away
without even seeing me!

63
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,080
She got away, huh?
Seems pretty smart!

64
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,330
Damn, he heard that!

65
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,910
I blurted out the truth!

66
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,370
So buy a house!

67
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,410
They may reject us for our faces,
but they won't, if we own a house!

68
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,370
Own house, right?
-No...

69
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You waste a lot of water!

70
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,700
I ask you a question
and you're leaving!

71
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,830
I own this house!

72
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Really think so?

73
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,250
The house must be beautiful!

74
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,080
The street must be wide!

75
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,700
It must be really breezy!

76
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,790
There must be a tree
and a cuckoo atop it!

77
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,160
Most importantly,
it mustn't be very expensive!

78
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,200
Then you can only buy a house
in Thanjavur!

79
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,830
Yes, mom?

80
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,500
We went to see a girl, right?
-See?

81
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,660
Well, we went to meet one, right?

82
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,250
Yes.
-They rejected us!

83
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,790
Just figured it out, huh?

84
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,410
They didn't even show the girl!

85
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,450
Who do they take us for?

86
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,000
That didn't work!

87
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,620
Why needlessly talk about them?

88
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Hang up!

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,450
"I must let go of lustful desires
for women!"

90
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,660
"You must always live in my thoughts,
O God!"

91
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,330
I'm calling from 'Sulekha.com'.

92
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,250
Want to see a flat in Pallikaranai?

93
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,580
"Give me knowledge. Shower me with mercy!
Give me a life free of ailments!"

94
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,080
There's a flat like you wanted
on the eighth floor.

95
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,870
It'll be ready in a month!

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,830
Tambaram is just 50 kilometres from here!

97
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,580
You wanted trees and cuckoos, yes?

98
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,870
Rainwater won't stagnate here!

99
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,500
"Serene faced God, who shuns killing!
O mighty Shanmugha!"

100
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,200
"Let there be the light of life!
Absolute benevolence to all!"

101
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,540
Let someone show me
a good house, at least today!

102
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,040
Come, sir!
I'll show you!

103
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,870
The 'sir' is here!

104
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,750
Get going, 'sir'!

105
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,790
Get going!
Think he's all that!

106
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,000
How do you live with her?
-I just rent her place!

107
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,700
One sightsees a town
or sees a house.

108
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,250
I've never seen one
who sightsees houses all over town!

109
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,660
How many more?
-Going to live in it forever, yes?

110
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,830
Got to be sure, right?
-Sorry, I'm late!

111
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,950
Let's go!

112
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,160
What is it, sir?
Enter with the right foot forward!

113
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,620
"Let there be the light of life!
Absolute benevolence to all!"

114
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,540
An excellent house
built just for you, sir!

115
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,660
I've brokered deals for many clients,
but I've never found them such a house!

116
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,330
A guy lived here, once.

117
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,200
He's really gone places!

118
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,160
Look at the North entrance!
How beautiful is this kitchen!

119
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,870
Plenty of positive energy here
for kids to study!

120
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,790
If they do so,
they'll find a job abroad!

121
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,290
How many kids do you have?

122
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not even married yet!
-Not married?

123
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,200
Aren't you an engineer?

124
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,540
Nowadays, no one's willing
to wed an engineer!

125
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,290
The thing is, you earn a lot!

126
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,540
You'll definitely find
a beautiful wife!

127
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,370
With the blessings of Goddess Mahamayi,
a fine girl will come light up your life!

128
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,370
Phone's ringing. Answer it.
-That's your phone, sir.

129
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,330
Hello?
Who is it?

130
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,290
This is Mekala speaking.

131
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,580
You came to my house
for a bridal alliance, yes?

132
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
So many alliances!
Which one is this?

133
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,830
From Thanjavur...

134
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,120
Oh, Mekala!
It's you? Tell me!

135
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm sorry. I wasn't home
when you came by for the alliance.

136
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,950
I had an unavoidable task.
That's why, I...

137
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,200
It's alright.
What would've happened?

138
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,950
I would have heard
this apology in person. That's all!

139
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,370
I'm really sorry!

140
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,580
You don't need to feel so bad!

141
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,580
I've had plenty such experience!

142
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,450
As you're being so frank,
I'll tell you the truth.

143
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,790
They showed me your picture.

144
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,580
It wasn't any unavoidable work!

145
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,870
I just left.

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,580
After your visit,
I thought about it.

147
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,830
I felt really guilty!

148
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,580
You travelled very far to meet us!

149
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,040
I should've at least showed up, right?

150
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
I was wrestling over whether or not
to call you.

151
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,080
I thought I should talk to you today!

152
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,620
That's why I called!

153
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,410
I feel much better now!

154
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,200
Delighted!
-Why?

155
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,660
Because I made you feel better, right?

156
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,200
Did you get to see my picture?

157
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,790
No one showed me your picture.

158
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,660
What if you see my picture
and not like what you find?

159
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,450
I wasn't raised to have
likes and dislikes.

160
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,830
Whatever I get,
I will like.

161
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,950
How about that?

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's spinning crazy!

163
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
So that's how you take a good look
around a house?

164
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,200
A fine girl will come light up your life!

165
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,750
The house will bring you luck!

166
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,580
'I feel unabounded love!'

167
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,040
'My quest ends here!'

168
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,370
'Time changes for good!'

169
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,450
So you're in B-2?
I'm in A-2.

170
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,750
'I see a bright future!'
-Mustn't hear a peep from you, okay?

171
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,580
'A dream became a reality!'

172
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,950
'The heart soared as if on wings!'

173
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,410
"Anytime I see a wilted crop,
I wither, too". You taught me so!

174
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,410
'I shall welcome sprightly squirrels
into my house!'

175
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,250
'I shall cook small dishes of food,
with love!'

176
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,620
'I shall gift this new light,
swirling in the kitchen!'

177
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,000
'I shall enjoy solitude
in the divine light of of life!'

178
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,790
'The sky from yesterday
runs and hides like a cat!'

179
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,370
'Time rests on an easy chair
and smiles away.'

180
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,660
'Gained a life
and a home!'

181
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,250
'My longing began to materialize
in the form of bricks!'

182
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,410
'I will demand the dawn to be born,
to relish it!'

183
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,120
'I will be engrossed in the music
of chirping crickets!'

184
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,790
'I will lie atop the light on the floor
as a petite shadow!'

185
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,160
'I will enjoy these rooms,
even in my greying years!'

186
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,950
'Even when the drizzle ceases,
the moisture in the air stays behind.'

187
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,450
'Even as time goes on,
it becomes etched in my vision.'

188
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,790
'My soul is in waiting!'

189
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:40,080
'My soul came by
and stood on my doorstep!'

190
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,950
The rusk vanished the other day too, right?

191
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,330
There were two of them.
I ate one.

192
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,370
I'm the only one here, right?

193
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,950
The rusks often tend to go missing!

194
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,950
"Let there be the light of life!
Absolute benevolence to all!"

195
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,410
There's a problem at JCS Jewelry.

196
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,700
Please check it out.
-Alright, sir.

197
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,370
Can you come along?

198
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,580
What?
Why'd you come like this?

199
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,700
I've come properly, haven't I?
-Good grief!

200
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,450
How did you know?

201
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,870
She told me!
-"She"?

202
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,290
How do you know her?
-Through the phone!

203
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
No matter who calls,
you'd flirt it out, eh?

204
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,910
I am Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai!

205
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,330
You had complained about power problems.
Tell me!

206
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,200
Mylapore Electricity Board?
-Yes!

207
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Is that where you work?
-It's not that bad a job!

208
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,620
I had filed the complaint!

209
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm sorry.
Thought this was about something else!

210
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,660
How many sorrys?

211
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,290
Even if you had wantedly spoken to us so,
that's no issue.

212
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes.
No charges or damages!

213
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,160
Had you wanted us to buy jewelry,
that'd have been hard.

214
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,450
Yes, mom?

215
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,290
That girl works in Madras, too!

216
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,950
Which girl?
Can't you be more specific?

217
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,580
The girl from our town.
The one that never showed up!

218
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh... her!

219
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,040
So what if she works here?

220
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,450
No, son.
She says she wants to meet you!

221
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,750
Shall I decline?
-Hold it, mom!

222
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,450
You mustn't say such things!

223
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,450
She requests to meet me.
Must I not oblige...

224
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,450
What is that?

225
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
It wasn't me!

226
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,750
Hey, you! Don't bite me!
I am not even married, yet!

227
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,790
A rat!

228
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,250
I was scared of this?

229
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,500
Maddening noises
in the newly bought house!

230
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,080
Imagine what it'd be like!

231
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,040
It turned out to be a rat!

232
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,580
Only now, I feel at peace.

233
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,330
At peace for what you saw,
or because she saw you?

234
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,250
Hey! Shut up!

235
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,330
Rusks often go missing in the house!

236
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,040
The rat's behind that, too!

237
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,500
What?
A rat?

238
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,700
You say it like it's no big deal!

239
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,040
Be careful, sir!

240
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,410
Why hype up such a small rat?

241
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,660
"A small rat"?
Don't speak like that!

242
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,580
In our old house,
there was a rat!

243
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
It was really brilliant!

244
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,950
It would wait until nightfall.

245
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
No one knows when and how
it would show up.

246
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,290
We'd find out in the morning
that it had chewed up the rice sacks!

247
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,750
So we put the rice in containers
on top shelves.

248
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,040
Don't know if the lack of rice
angered it...

249
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,950
...for it made a big mess
of the kitchen!

250
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,910
We locked all the doors
and windows.

251
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,660
Then we figured where it came from.

252
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,290
Where did it come from?

253
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,830
It came from the toilet, sir!

254
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,540
And then what else?

255
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,450
We tried baiting it with biscuits
and poisoned dry fish.

256
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,910
It didn't fall for any of it!

257
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,580
We had to vacate the house!

258
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,870
Oh, stop it!
You're just spinning tales!

259
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,620
There was a huge problem
at a Japanese nuclear plant, yes?

260
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,250
What caused it?
Rats!

261
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,790
Tiny rats!

262
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Is that her?

263
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Yikes!

264
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,830
Can't tell which one is her!

265
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,790
I'm Mekala...

266
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,660
...'s friend, Vanathi.

267
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,000
She is Mekala.

268
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,790
You'd shake anybody's hand, eh?

269
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,120
I'm sorry!

270
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,500
I thought she was you...
I'm sorry!

271
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,870
You talk one way on the phone
and another in person!

272
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,410
I'm not that kind of person!

273
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,790
As we walked in,
who did you think was Mekala?

274
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,290
Be honest.

275
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
I thought it was you.

276
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,370
Which one of us is beautiful?

277
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,700
Why question me as if I'm a little boy?

278
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,200
We came to meet,
not to fight, right?

279
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,660
We're meeting and talking!
Not singing a duet, yes?

280
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,580
Don't I need to know the kind of person
you are? Tell the truth!

281
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,250
I don't know truth or lies.

282
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,000
Whatever we feel within,
is the truth.

283
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,000
I feel that you're beautiful.

284
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,540
Then isn't that the truth?

285
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,950
I don't know
what 'beautiful' means to you.

286
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,870
But you're Mekala.
That'll suffice.

287
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,580
So, you're the most beautiful thing
in the world to me.

288
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,750
Why are you telling me that?
Tell Mekala.

289
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,370
Aren't you Mekala?

290
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I am Mekala.

291
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,580
Rosie!
-Who is Rosie?

292
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,750
Come here or I'll whack you!
-Why does this lady always call for her?

293
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,950
You're disobeying me a lot as of late!

294
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,700
What work do you have
at the neighbor's house? Come here!

295
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,120
You say it like it's no big deal!

296
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,290
Be careful, sir!

297
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,830
Quite a deadly rat!

298
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,000
'Leap and run up, down and all across,
pounce to strike, we will!'

299
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,540
'Sniff out a fragrant home
and rob it blind, we will!'

300
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,870
'We cannot bear hunger!
We cannot cook, either!'

301
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,250
'Cold leftover rice will suffice!
We won't rest until we get a taste!'

302
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,580
'Brats!
Incredible brats!'

303
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,370
'Listen to the tales of our mischief!'

304
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,330
'Yarns!
Newly spurn yarns!'

305
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,410
'These will run for days!'

306
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,250
'Climb up on pipes
and scratch paper plates, we will!'

307
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,790
'We belong to the dynasty of Spider-Man!'

308
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,950
'Assemble late at night
and dance jigs, we will!'

309
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,790
'We're as rad as Michael Jackson!'

310
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,750
'Sneak into the spice rack
to seek out the spices, we will!'

311
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,450
'As we make off with the loot,
the cooker whistle shrills!'

312
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,370
'As the wheels spin
amidst freight trucks, we feel no fear!'

313
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,580
'Our only fear is one that purrs all day!'

314
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,410
'Got evil plans to steal, we do!
No Goods and Services Tax for that!

315
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,620
'What can your law do to us?'

316
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,040
'We've never feared anything
nor have we begged anyone!'

317
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
'Your system kills us!'

318
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,120
'We won't annoy you
by announcing our arrival!'

319
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,290
'We won't flap our gums
and brag about our exploits!'

320
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,790
'Brats!
Incredible brats!'

321
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,700
'Listen to the tales of our mischief!'

322
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,450
'Yarns!
Newly spurn yarns!'

323
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,540
'These will run for days!'

324
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:00,750
'Leap and run up, down and all across,
pounce to strike, we will!'

325
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,410
'Sniff out a fragrant home
and rob it blind, we will!'

326
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,330
'We cannot bear hunger!
We cannot cook, either!'

327
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,540
'Cold leftover rice will suffice!
We won't rest until we get a taste!'

328
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,040
'Brats!
Incredible brats!'

329
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,160
'Listen to the tales of our mischief!'

330
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,750
'Yarns!
Newly spurn yarns!'

331
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,620
'These will run for days!'

332
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,330
Hey, Rosie!
Won't catch rats, huh?

333
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,410
Only imported food!

334
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,660
And they call you a cat?

335
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,790
Lovely!

336
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,790
"Are you still up"?

337
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,040
"I'd really like to see you."

338
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,870
You're incredibly beautiful.

339
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,290
I can't say the same!

340
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,410
Why crush me to bits?

341
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,950
If you speak from the dark terrace,
how can I see you?

342
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,660
That's true!

343
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,040
Why are you lying there?

344
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
That's a sad story!

345
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,660
Way too much trouble with a rat at home!

346
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Trouble with a rat?

347
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes!

348
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,290
So you're sleeping on the terrace.

349
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,950
Did the rat ever go to sleep on the terrace
because of you?

350
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,540
No...
-Then what?

351
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,160
No one is a trouble to anyone else.

352
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,790
This world is for all life forms.

353
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,790
If one adjusts a little,
everyone can be happy!

354
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,120
I do adjust!

355
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,410
Can't bear the torture
of the crunching it does all night!

356
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,200
It's like I bought a 50 lakh house
just for a rat!

357
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,750
That's not right, either!

358
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,750
If a thief comes into your house,
would you just give up and leave?

359
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,370
How will the problem get solved?

360
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,330
That's true!
-Tried a rat trap?

361
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,950
Like that'll work!

362
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,700
I can't even find out from where
it comes and goes!

363
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,000
You don't know from where
it comes and goes...

364
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,200
Alright. Try this!

365
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,040
Is he an EB employee or a lunatic?

366
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,790
Buy five rat traps!

367
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,580
Place a nicely roasted piece of coconut
in each trap!

368
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,410
Keep each trap in separate rooms!

369
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,290
Lock all the rooms!

370
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,040
Whichever room the rat is in,
it'll come, eat and get trapped!

371
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,660
Mekala was right!

372
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,160
So this is where you are!

373
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,870
Doesn't matter if I go hungry!
You stay in here!

374
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,620
Mommy's calling you, right?

375
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,750
Come here, you idiot!

376
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
Oh, she meant you!

377
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,870
Haven't eaten yet?
-Not hungry.

378
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,830
When you should be playing with your kids,
your love life is beginning!

379
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,370
You won't feel hunger!

380
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,870
My body aches, man!

381
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,250
Shall we go to the hospital?

382
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,250
There's still time for that!

383
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,160
Wow! Rusks!
Give me a couple!

384
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,750
It's a rat!

385
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,870
How is that possible?

386
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,160
I locked it up in the room!

387
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,040
What? You locked up the rat in a room?
-Yes!

388
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,750
Which room?
-The kitchen!

389
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,540
Who gave you that brilliant idea?

390
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,950
The lady at the jewelry store?

391
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Yes.
-I figured!

392
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,330
Such a bright idea!

393
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
What's wrong?

394
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,910
It's nothing.

395
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,580
Met the Secretary yesterday.
He said the Assembly is convening.

396
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,080
He asked for status reports
on newly installed LED lights...

397
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,830
...transformers and pillars
from our division.

398
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,450
What?

399
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,120
He's building a dam in his mouth!

400
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,330
What is this, man?

401
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,910
Rat fever!

402
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,160
Haven't heard of it, huh?

403
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,700
Lot of trouble with rats, eh?

404
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,540
Must be careful!
Very unhygienic!

405
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,870
Rat urine could've spread from anywhere!
Water, food, you name it!

406
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,700
You admitted him at the right time!

407
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:41,200
If it wasn't diagnosed,
it could've been fatal!

408
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,790
He'll be fine in a few days.

409
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,160
Be careful with the rats!

410
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,620
So much power
within such a tiny rat?

411
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,250
"Tiny", eh?

412
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,200
It can give birth in four weeks!

413
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,330
Did you know that?

414
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,700
The rat's a mighty mickey, huh?

415
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,450
You get going.
I'll take care of him.

416
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,200
It's alright.
I'll take care of him.

417
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,750
How can you stay here...

418
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,080
Take care of him.

419
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,950
What's it to me?
Take care of yourself.

420
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,120
It's a private room.

421
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,660
Small bed, too. You'd end up ranting
about certain 'accidents'.

422
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Yes, mom?

423
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,660
Doing well?
-Yes!

424
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,450
Saw the girl?

425
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm seeing her right now.

426
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
What?

427
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,120
I saw her!
-What's she like?

428
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
She's nice.

429
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,950
What does that mean?

430
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,250
Such an empty statement!

431
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,080
By that,
I mean she's very nice!

432
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,040
Wholesome. Beautiful.

433
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,700
Will that do? What else do you want?

434
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,620
Oh my!
Nothing else, son.

435
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,910
Her father's asking if we can have
the engagement next week!

436
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,750
What's wrong?
Haven't said a word!

437
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,750
Just the thought of something good
ever happening to me...

438
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,950
...leaves me speechless.

439
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Alright then. Smile!

440
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,290
'In the fading light of the evening,
on the bank of the river...'

441
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,750
'...surfaced a moon!'

442
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,370
'My moon surfaced!'

443
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:06,080
'I wish to speak to her
for days on end!'

444
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,790
'But the words seem to get snared
on my tongue!'

445
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:19,790
'Like the beam of light upon a river...'

446
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,580
'...you fell into my life!'

447
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,250
'I raced and rolled over!'

448
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,620
'In the fading light of the evening,
on the bank of the river...'

449
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,910
'...surfaced a moon!'

450
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,620
'My moon surfaced!'

451
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,870
'Atop the terrace,
I fell as a drop of rain!'

452
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,580
'On dusty cobwebs,
I see butterflies flutter!'

453
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,450
'A feeling I have never known
lulls me to sleep!'

454
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:47,950
'All day, every day,
my heart wishes only for that!'

455
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:54,080
'On mere ashes, the footprints of a flower
paint patterns of beauty!'

456
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:02,080
'In the fading light of the evening,
on the bank of the river...'

457
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,250
'...surfaced a moon!'

458
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,950
'My moon surfaced!'

459
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:29,500
'Who knows who joins hands with whom
under this raining sky?'

460
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:36,370
'Who knows whose umbrella shades
whose soaring heart?'

461
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,660
'Days went by,
shut like a closed door!'

462
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:49,700
'Like space devoid of a door,
comes by, a new day!'

463
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:55,830
'I lived as a kite.
Upon my threshold, comes along love!'

464
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,950
'In the fading light of the evening...'

465
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,580
You've come this far.

466
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,790
Care for some tea?

467
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,790
Come in!

468
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,290
A rat did this?

469
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,000
No one believes me when I tell them.

470
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Here you go!

471
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,540
There's no tea powder, either.

472
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,700
I keep running to the store
like an errand boy!

473
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,500
I should've protested
when offered tea at home!

474
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,200
Like they're sweeping
at the railway platform!

475
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,250
A little...
-What?

476
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,410
There's no sugar, huh?

477
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,250
I figured!

478
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,450
Just making tea, right?

479
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,120
You're making it strong!

480
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,120
Carry on!

481
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,290
Keeping it shut like this
is what causes trouble!

482
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:30,950
Leave it open.

483
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,830
The house is fine.

484
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,700
Why haven't you bought any furniture?

485
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,500
Where would you seat visitors?

486
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,160
Tell me what to buy
and we'll do it.

487
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,910
Over here!

488
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,450
A small dining table.

489
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:03,830
And here...
-Yes?

490
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,370
A plastic armchair!
-Right!

491
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,750
Over there...

492
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,500
Wind chimes!

493
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,660
Ah...
-Made of bamboo!

494
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,580
And here...

495
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,750
A lovely sofa.

496
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,750
What kind of sofa?

497
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,250
I really like Stanley sofas!

498
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,040
What does that mean?

499
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,500
A premium sofa!

500
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,830
Incredibly soft. Very comfortable.
Oh so heavenly!

501
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,120
It's awesome!

502
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:40,660
I had always wanted to buy these things
for my future home.

503
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,790
Is that what you want?

504
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:45,410
To each their own.

505
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,080
But we tend to spend most of our day
on the sofa, right?

506
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,080
That sofa must be special, right?

507
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,750
Sugar.

508
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,620
Yuck!

509
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,370
A rat can do much damage?

510
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,700
Could've had tea at the shop!

511
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,580
For this,
I bought tea and sugar, huh?

512
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,910
Let's find out who's the winner, today:
You or me!

513
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,450
I have a surprise!
-What is it?

514
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,120
What are you going to do?

515
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,540
So many bad things happened
because of you.

516
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,870
A lot of good things, too.

517
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,700
If not for you, would Mekala have spent
a whole day with me?

518
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,290
Here you go.
This is an important report.

519
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,160
For the Assembly session.

520
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,540
I'll be on leave from Monday.
Give this to the Secretary.

521
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,080
And give this one on Friday.

522
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,410
What is he looking at?

523
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,700
Hey!
-Sir?

524
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,120
The sofa is very nice, sir.

525
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,120
A treat for just catching a rat?

526
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
A sofa store?

527
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,330
What are we doing here?

528
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,330
I like Mekala.

529
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,120
Mekala likes sofas very much!

530
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,660
Both of you are freaking crazy!

531
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,950
Know how much sofas cost here?
-I don't care how much!

532
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,580
Cool with it being 50 thousand!

533
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,870
It costs five lakhs, sir!

534
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:41,700
Just five lakhs?

535
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,250
Plus Goods and Services Tax!

536
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,950
Ten lakhs, sir!

537
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Twelve lakhs, sir!

538
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,000
At a little lower price...

539
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,370
How much?

540
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,830
50...
Even 55 thousand is fine!

541
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,410
Our starting price sofa!

542
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,040
How much?
-50 thousand!

543
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,450
One lakh, fifty thousand.

544
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,040
We've come to the wrong place.
Let's go! Come on!

545
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:45,000
I really like the color red!

546
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,410
How much is that red sofa?
-Five and a half lakhs, sir.

547
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,330
I'll take it.

548
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,000
Can I pay in instalments?
-Yes.

549
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,830
Cross Chengalpet,
you can get a house for eight lakhs!

550
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,370
This is too much!
-It's okay.

551
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,870
Some buy a phone worth 50 thousand
for a girlfriend.

552
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,700
It falls and breaks the next instant!

553
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,410
Mekala and I will sit on this
for the rest of our lives!

554
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,500
It isn't wrong to spend for that.

555
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,620
Let's go.

556
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,750
Why do this?
-To let Mekala know!

557
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,450
Don't tell her like this!

558
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,870
Say you've bought a gift
and invite her to see it.

559
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,250
Really?

560
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:57,330
This is when you must leap forward
in a relationship!

561
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,500
Like this?

562
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,620
And you got a girl!

563
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,950
Awesome, isn't it?

564
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:16,660
Shall we sit and see?

565
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,580
Sit down, buddy!

566
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,620
Sit down!

567
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,580
We're with sofa maintenance.

568
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,750
If your sofa gets dirty,
how would you clean it?

569
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,540
What are you doing, sir?

570
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,160
Got a vacuum?
-I have a broom!

571
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:46,950
Hold on, sir.
Open it.

572
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,620
Like to buy it?
-How much?

573
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,790
Cleaner, remover and towel
altogether cost twenty five thousand.

574
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,660
Offer price? Only nineteen thousand.

575
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,950
Let's see how it gets dusty!

576
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,410
Hello, sir!

577
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,410
They sold the house you stayed in.

578
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,790
A man from the electricity board
lives there now.

579
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:30,910
How have you been?

580
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,990
One diamond is missing!

581
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,200
Maybe someone took it?

582
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,360
If they did,
they would've taken them all!

583
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,860
Why would they take just one?

584
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:22,780
Looks like something bit away at this.

585
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,320
The rat?

586
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,110
Yes, mom?
-How are you?

587
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,400
I'm fine!
-The wedding's fast approaching!

588
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:40,150
When are you coming?
-The invitations must be sent out.

589
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,320
I'll leave soon.

590
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,780
You and Mekala buy the wedding clothes
on your way.

591
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Alright, mom.

592
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:59,400
I'll be on leave from Monday.
Give this to the Secretary.

593
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:00,950
And give this one on Friday.

594
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,150
Sir called you.
-Which Sir?

595
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,740
The Deputy Chief!
-He said he wasn't coming today...

596
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,950
Has he come?
-Yes, sir.

597
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,860
Said you wouldn't be in today!

598
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,990
That's a sad story!

599
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:18,110
While the CM was speaking,
there was a power cut at the auditorium.

600
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,490
Quite the uproar!

601
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,530
So I cancelled everything
and came back!

602
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,150
Give me the reports, anyway.

603
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,070
I'll give it to the Secretary myself.

604
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,200
Here you go, sir.

605
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:41,950
What is this?
-What, sir?

606
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,530
A rat has bitten this!

607
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,070
A rat?
No way!

608
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,490
What do you call this?

609
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,030
That was before...

610
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:57,820
I got rid of the rat.
Got the document on Friday.

611
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,820
And kept it.

612
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,200
Got rid of it. Got it.
Kept it.

613
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,070
Got rid of it. Got it.
Kept it.

614
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,200
Hey...

615
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,610
I gave you another package!
Is that at least safe?

616
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,570
It contains a cheque worth 25 lakhs!

617
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,240
Don't fail me now!
Start up! Start up!

618
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:02,950
Why you little...

619
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,360
Like a good human being,
I let you go, alive.

620
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,610
Showed me your tricks, didn't you?

621
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,990
You ruined the sofa that I lovingly bought
for Mekala, didn't you?

622
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,320
Why I ought to...

623
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,700
You sounded very upset.

624
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,700
It just made small holes, right?

625
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,110
Can't you sit on this?

626
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,530
Are you fine with a rat coming in
through a hole and biting your nuts?

627
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,650
Come!

628
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:05,610
Mekala likes the sofa.
So does the rat!

629
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:09,450
Mekala likes you.
So does the rat, too!

630
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:12,150
She has bad taste.
So does the rat!

631
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,360
What is this...

632
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,780
You didn't buy an independent house!
This is a flat!

633
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,570
Others live here, too!

634
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,490
If you keep dropping stuff loudly...

635
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:28,030
Sorry...
-What the hell, man?

636
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,240
Come lift it!
-Called the service, right?

637
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,200
So? Are you saying we can break it?

638
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,610
It cost five lakh rupees!

639
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,530
Move aside!
It looks ugly out front.

640
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,240
"Looks ugly"?

641
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,280
My five lakh sofa looks ugly?

642
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,820
It's awesome only when I hear you say
it's five lakhs!

643
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,740
Sorry.
Blurting out the truth a lot today!

644
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,820
Don't touch it!
Move away!

645
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,030
Quite the headache!

646
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,530
Shall I make some tea?

647
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,070
I can do it better than Mekala!

648
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,450
You're going to have bad tea all your life!

649
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,700
What do I care?
-The lighter doesn't work!

650
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,070
Use the matchstick!

651
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,990
It's not lighting up!

652
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:21,030
You can't even light up a stove!
And you want to make tea?

653
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:24,570
Common sense!

654
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Give me that!

655
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:28,570
Some man, you are!

656
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,990
Damn it!
The cylinder!

657
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:39,150
Go get a wet blanket!
Hurry!

658
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,030
Damn it!

659
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,950
Oh no!

660
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,530
Oh crap!
My sofa!

661
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,530
Hey, Ravi!

662
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:03,650
Oh my!

663
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,150
Hey!
Hey, Ravi!

664
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,950
My God!
The sofa!

665
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,610
Out of the way!
-Bring it over!

666
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,820
You jackass!

667
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:14,070
Seal off the cylinder!

668
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,400
What are you staring at?

669
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,400
You said I couldn't make tea
but you burned down the sofa!

670
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,530
The fire is out!
We put the fire out!

671
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,860
Damn it!
We put it out!

672
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,030
The fire is out, man!

673
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:53,280
The evidence is important!
Hold still!

674
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:57,240
Out of the way!

675
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,070
There's water on the floor!
Careful!

676
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,530
What happened?
-A rat bit the cylinder tube.

677
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,200
We put it out!
-The sofa was destroyed!

678
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,400
You're safe, right?

679
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:08,070
Is there a Mr. Anjanam here?
-That would be me.

680
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,610
Sofa service.

681
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,200
A rat did bite it, sir!

682
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,650
How can you tell?
-Through the rat's urine!

683
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,450
It reeks of ammonia!

684
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,400
Rat urine!
-So what?

685
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:33,820
How does that mean it bit it?

686
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:38,400
When a rat feels uneasy about something
it eats, it pees right away!

687
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,530
So, the other rats would not eat it.

688
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,740
It's a form of communication
among them!

689
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,740
Would it eat diamonds?

690
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,150
It can eat anything besides iron!

691
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,990
What happens if it eats diamonds?
-It'll come out in its poop.

692
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:52,860
Or it'll stay in the stomach
for ten to fifteen days.

693
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:54,650
Is that right?

694
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,450
A very expensive sofa, mom!

695
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:54,990
He went above and beyond to buy it
as the girl liked it.

696
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:56,110
It's a pity!

697
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,900
I'll sleep here and come in the morning.

698
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:01,320
What's the point of staring at it?
Come and sleep!

699
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,820
Come along!

700
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,350
You're coming to my house?
-You told me to come on Saturday!

701
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,900
Have you left already?

702
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,020
We must get ready!

703
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,050
Mekala's coming!
We leave in five minutes!

704
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,580
Can you wait for ten minutes?

705
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:42,290
Almost done, here!
Please!

706
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,410
Hurry up!

707
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,200
He talks as if I'm at the dining table!

708
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,410
I lovingly bought this for her!

709
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,290
Don't tell her anything if she asks!

710
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:53,830
Fine!
-She'll take it hard!

711
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,540
We'll leave before she gets here!

712
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,540
If so,
how'll she ask when she comes?

713
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,450
Don't answer the calling bell!

714
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:06,000
What if I open the door
as she presses the bell?

715
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,120
Cover it properly!

716
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,080
Mekala!
I forgot to tell you!

717
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,790
An urgent task came up...

718
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,000
The door wasn't locked, huh?

719
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,870
What is it?
-What?

720
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,540
You were saying something...

721
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,410
What was I saying?
-About an urgent task...

722
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:41,870
That there are no urgent tasks today
and it'll be nice if you came by!

723
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,870
You're here and I'm so happy!
Right?

724
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,160
Oh, totally!
Last night was so much fun!

725
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,870
What else is special?

726
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
What is this?

727
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,200
The house is so dirty!

728
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,870
What do we have here?

729
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Don't open it!

730
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,910
That's his dirty laundry!

731
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,080
Smells horrible in there!

732
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,540
His underwear is in there!

733
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,200
What else?

734
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,200
What else?
-Asked me to come on Saturday, right?

735
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:06,370
The view from here on a Saturday
is awesome! Want to see?

736
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,660
Take a look!

737
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,250
How beautiful it is!

738
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:21,870
Just that...

739
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:25,370
You said you bought something for me...

740
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,700
Oh, that?

741
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:29,080
I was just thinking about giving it to you!

742
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,620
And you just asked for it!

743
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,450
Close your eyes!
He'll give it to you!

744
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,200
Damn it!

745
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,080
Why is it taking so long?

746
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:18,870
There's no other go!

747
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,370
It's lovely!

748
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,000
Between his gifting
and her accepting...

749
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,250
...Kohli and Anushka
must take notes!

750
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:05,370
Awesome, isn't it?

751
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,370
Small and cute.

752
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,870
It was pretty big!

753
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:13,040
As it was packed tightly,
it shrunk.

754
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,370
Good grief!

755
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,410
Careful...

756
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,830
This sofa is very expensive!

757
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,450
He bought it for you.

758
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,790
It caught fire yesterday.

759
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,040
I've never wished for anything for myself.

760
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,700
Because it never comes true.

761
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:07,950
I desired something for you.

762
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,200
So I bought this.

763
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,080
I asked you to come here
so I could surprise you.

764
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,750
That was ruined, too.

765
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,830
Didn't you buy it for me?

766
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,250
So what if it burned up?

767
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,000
Would it not be a gift to me anymore?

768
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:55,370
Must I go buy milk again?

769
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,120
"High rise apartment on fire!"

770
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,500
"Fatality caused by a rat!"

771
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,330
"Firefighters to the rescue!"

772
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:09,660
The house had caught fire.
The fire department put it out.

773
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,330
But you told us nothing!

774
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:14,000
What if the cylinder had exploded
and killed ten families?

775
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:16,830
I asked you a question!

776
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,660
Answer me!

777
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:21,200
How much do I pay you?

778
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,000
A pest control team
came by Zackaria Colony.

779
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,830
Only then, did the problem get solved.

780
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,370
Why don't you try it?

781
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,250
Their number...

782
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,910
I'm an artiste, sir!

783
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,700
He said he was making a film.
I act very well!

784
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,250
He snitched me out!
-What?

785
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,410
Alright, we'll see.

786
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,660
We are from PA Pest Control Systems!

787
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:18,660
I never thought you'd come so quickly!

788
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:19,830
The cop told us!

789
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,750
He told you, too?

790
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,870
We made him tell us!

791
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,620
We told him to refer to us
anyone who needs pest control!

792
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,040
Come in!

793
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,910
Why do you look through the books?

794
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,200
Rat hair might be anywhere!

795
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,450
It'll help us find out how many rats
are here!

796
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Just one rat, sir!

797
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:40,040
Come on out!

798
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:08,790
Even if smoke doesn't draw it out,
the rat knows we are here!

799
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,120
As long as we are here,
it won't show up!

800
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:15,950
What do we do?
-Let's try sulfate!

801
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,580
Thallium sulfate!

802
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,540
It's very poisonous!
They have banned it!

803
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:25,910
If a rat eats it,
it'll die in thirty seconds!

804
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:46,080
What does the rat usually eat
in this house?

805
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:04,950
A rat?

806
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,750
The rat will surely die this time!

807
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:23,040
Call us once it does.
We'll handle it.

808
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,790
The rat ate the dried fish!

809
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,370
And the rat?
-It's missing!

810
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,160
A rat that ate the poison
would have died right there!

811
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:26,250
Look around!
It would not have gone far!

812
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:28,330
I'm going out on an urgent task.
-Don't worry!

813
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,950
My boys will handle it!
Alright?

814
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,870
I'll leave the key with the watchman!
-Okay. I'll take care.

815
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:43,500
Search for the rat!
It is here and so is the diamond!

816
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,660
'Like the sarus bird that mates for life,
and never parts away...'

817
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:04,540
'...we'll live without any dearth of love!'

818
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:11,580
'Eyes locked onto eyes,
our hearts merged as one!'

819
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,830
'We shall revel
in life's joys and sorrows!'

820
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:23,250
'The fragrance of an exotic flower
fills the air as she walks along!'

821
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:26,790
'It will speak in jubilation!'

822
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:34,580
'Is she a golden yellow moon?
Is she is a sweet-tongued flute?'

823
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:38,620
'Her beautiful self came before me!'

824
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:55,750
Did you find the rat?
-No, boss!

825
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:00,870
Morons! You'll search for a damn rat
for two days?

826
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,950
Where is he?
-He's eating!

827
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,410
"Eating"?

828
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:26,040
'A lovely house...
A nest of two parrots...'

829
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:37,370
Couldn't you find the rat?
-We searched all over!

830
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,160
We don't know where it died!

831
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:42,000
I smell something horrible!
-The whole house stinks!

832
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:45,120
That's why we couldn't find the rat.
We'll get rid of it tomorrow!

833
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,290
Excuse me!
-Sir?

834
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:36,910
Do you smell something bad?

835
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,000
We just cleaned the place today
with Dettol!

836
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,540
No, this is different...

837
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:49,950
Where is it coming from...

838
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:15,580
What is he sniffing at?

839
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:35,620
Why haven't you left yet?
Given out all the invitations, right?

840
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:38,580
I'm too afraid to go home!

841
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,910
What are you saying?
-That rat is lying dead in there!

842
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,410
I can't get inside the place!

843
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:46,160
I thought it was just a puny rat!

844
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:51,750
That rat was killing me when it was alive
and does so even after it's dead!

845
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,250
You're always going on and on
about the rat!

846
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:55,790
Laughing, are you?

847
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:59,790
I bought a house but can't live in peace
there for a single day!

848
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,540
Who ever understands my pain?

849
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:06,660
It ate rusks.
It ate tubes.

850
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,500
It ate the sofa.

851
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:12,500
As it eats through the whole house,
I feel it's slowly eating into me, too!

852
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,790
My whole mind has gone bonkers!

853
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:20,870
When I tell my problem to others,
they laugh at me!

854
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,160
And hell, look at what even you say!

855
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,910
Listen.
The rat died, didn't it?

856
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,870
The odor will be around for ten days,
yes?

857
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,120
Until that odor goes away,
stay at my house!

858
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:35,200
Come along!
Some even live in graveyards!

859
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:36,950
Quit brooding!
Come!

860
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:44,750
It's Mekala.

861
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,790
Why didn't you answer my call?

862
01:47:51,790 --> 01:47:55,330
I'm at Ravi's house. My phone
ran out of charge and turned off.

863
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:59,290
Alright. Tried the outfit?
Do you like it?

864
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:00,410
What outfit?

865
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,700
I tried it on.
It was very nice!

866
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,250
Are you even interested in this wedding?

867
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:10,450
If I wasn't,
would I've gotten engaged?

868
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,870
Know how much I struggled
to find a bride?

869
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,410
How can you ask this?
-Fine.

870
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,160
What color is the suit?

871
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,370
Is this how you ask me?
-Why? Should I not ask you?

872
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,580
Started with it?
Already?

873
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,410
What 'started with it'?

874
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,580
You call it 'fighting'
because I asked if the suit fits you?

875
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:29,700
Would I ever say
that the suit isn't good?

876
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:33,910
Why repeatedly ask me so?
What will you do if I tell the truth?

877
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,410
You needn't wear the suit
to the reception!

878
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:47,620
Will the reception not happen
if I don't wear that suit?

879
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:53,120
I'm already peeved about not going home
and she's nagging me about the suit!

880
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:55,200
You're about to tell me
that we're going home.

881
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,620
Come on.
Let's go home!

882
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:16,660
Open it!

883
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:33,000
Way too much hype!

884
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,200
Welcome!
Some even live in graveyards, right?

885
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,620
There you go!

886
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:58,370
Come!

887
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It's awesome!

888
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:53,790
A hole!
-Where?

889
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:55,910
New fashion?
I can see the underwear!

890
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,290
I can see the underwear!

891
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:00,910
Whose?
-Your grandfather's!

892
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,790
Your underwear, man!
There's a hole in the pants!

893
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,540
How did this happen?

894
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,870
Aren't you dead, yet?

895
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,250
Over there!
-Look properly and strike!

896
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:25,580
Over here! Over here!
It's coming closer!

897
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,370
Hit carefully!
Whack it!

898
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,330
Where's the rat?

899
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,040
What are you staring at?
Idiot!

900
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,750
Get over here, Ravi!

901
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:06,120
Look! It's going near the TV set!

902
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:18,790
Whack it!

903
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,160
Come here!

904
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,160
Have you no sense?

905
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:38,290
Tell that old man to come back later!

906
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:39,950
The rat is getting away!

907
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,700
The rat is missing!

908
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:58,200
I hear a sound!

909
01:52:58,330 --> 01:52:59,660
It's in the kitchen!

910
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:01,620
Tell the old man to leave
and come here!

911
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,080
Whack it!

912
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:38,660
If the rat didn't die,
what did?

913
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,750
It's time! Come!

914
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:49,580
Hold on! I'll fix this and come!

915
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,120
We'll come back and fix it!

916
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:07,290
I'll get it!

917
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:10,370
What is it, old man?

918
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,500
Rosie is missing!

919
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,620
It's been three days!

920
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:24,870
Will you let me know
if you see her around?

921
01:55:33,870 --> 01:55:36,120
I told you to kill that rat
when we caught it!

922
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:38,830
You didn't want to kill it,
but now you've killed a cat!

923
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:40,910
At least that's all it was.

924
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,950
What if a child had eaten that rusk?

925
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,660
No one can live in this world
without killing any life!

926
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,200
It's an era where those who don't kill cows
kill humans!

927
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,910
Think you're all that...

928
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,660
It's a forest trap, sir!

929
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:03,450
Before you go to bed, turn off the lights
and switch this on.

930
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:07,250
Scary, isn't it?
-Incredibly strong setup, sir!

931
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,040
Even if a snake's fangs touch it,
instant death!

932
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,450
You always seem to be in deep thought!
Why?

933
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:19,790
Last time too,
we thought the rat would be killed.

934
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:21,330
But a cat died.

935
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:26,080
We're setting up an electric shock.
I'm afraid there might be another accident!

936
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:30,200
I have only one question.
Must the rat die or not?

937
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:58,000
Have you left?
-Ravi and I are coming in a car.

938
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:00,200
We'll reach in the evening.
-Dad wants to know!

939
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:01,580
Tell him I'll be there!

940
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:36,330
I didn't want to kill
even the tiniest life form.

941
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:38,620
You turned me into a killer!

942
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:58,550
It is fated
that you will die at my hands!

943
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,170
It doesn't have to die.

944
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,550
It just must not come back.

945
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:05,380
If it is killed,
it won't come back!

946
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:07,500
Shall I kill it?

947
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:28,170
'Without a hint of intolerance...'

948
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:36,840
'Considering all life
precious as one's own life...'

949
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:48,210
'Delighting in bestowing equally
one's goodwill on all...'

950
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:00,880
Even a small being like a fly or an ant
has a meaningful life!

951
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,460
What happened, sir?

952
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:29,840
Give that to me.

953
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:32,170
I'll take care of it.

954
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:33,300
No need, sir.

955
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:35,460
I won't be at peace.

956
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:38,960
God has given it life.

957
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,590
Never mind.
I'll set it free somewhere.

958
02:01:45,130 --> 02:01:46,380
Will you give it to me or not?

959
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:47,590
Why do you threaten me?

960
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:53,630
No, dear fellow.
It swallowed my thirty lakh diamond!

961
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,710
I must kill it
and get the diamond out!

962
02:01:57,960 --> 02:01:59,170
Give it to me!

963
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,710
The rat ate a diamond?

964
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:04,050
So you're not with the pest control?

965
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:06,710
Why tell such funny tales?

966
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:12,000
The rat chewing up your sofa isn't funny,
but it swallowing my diamond is?

967
02:02:12,130 --> 02:02:13,880
Had it eaten,
would it not have pooped?

968
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,840
If it had,
wouldn't the diamond be in it?

969
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,590
We searched the whole flat!
We couldn't find it!

970
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,460
You better give me that rat!

971
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,380
'I am going to run!'

972
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,250
'I am going to hide!'

973
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:58,630
'You can't catch me now!'

974
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:01,380
'I am going to run!'

975
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,300
'I am going to hide!'

976
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:06,880
'You cannot catch me now!'

977
02:03:58,710 --> 02:03:59,710
Let go of me!

978
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:22,090
Why is he here?

979
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:23,670
Always a ruckus in here!

980
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,590
I'll call the cops!
So much noise!

981
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,250
What noise?

982
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,210
Like you don't make any noise!

983
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:33,800
I'll definitely call the cops!

984
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,920
What are you gaping at?

985
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,920
Call!
Call the cops!

986
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:44,460
Stop staring!

987
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,500
Call the cops!

988
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:49,300
I'll smack your head!

989
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:54,800
Hello? Velachery police station?
A man has hit me, sir!

990
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:57,000
He always makes trouble, sir!

991
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:58,670
My door number is A2!
He's at B2!

992
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:01,170
Always a ruckus in there!

993
02:05:02,050 --> 02:05:06,050
Real useless fellows, sir!
Constantly a nuisance!

994
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:07,590
Come quickly, sir!

995
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:10,130
Let's go, boss!

996
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:12,460
Let's leave!

997
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:15,590
He won't let me do a ritual in peace!
-Come, boss!

998
02:05:15,710 --> 02:05:17,130
Arrest him on nuisance charges!

999
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,050
He must not be spared!
-Come, boss!

1000
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:21,130
Hurry!
-Come along, boss!

1001
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:24,920
Aren't you that smuggler?

1002
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,710
You're all a bunch of frauds, huh?

1003
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,000
No need for cops!
I hit you to escape from them!

1004
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:42,340
Let the cops come!

1005
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:43,710
See what I do to you all!

1006
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,590
Damn! Your hair is messed up!
Please don't mistake me!

1007
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:50,750
Who is Anjanam Azhagiya Pillai?

1008
02:05:52,550 --> 02:05:53,920
Won't answer your phone, huh?

1009
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:58,340
The inspector from the Mandaveli precinct
wants to see you! Go!

1010
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:01,090
Mandaveli?
-Is that it, sir?

1011
02:06:01,210 --> 02:06:02,630
He hit me, sir!

1012
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,250
He's leaving, boss!

1013
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:12,380
Start the car!

1014
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,500
Mandaveli precinct?
-Won't come even after being told?

1015
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,630
I'm on my way!

1016
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:08,300
What happened?

1017
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:14,920
I left work
after giving out wedding invitations.

1018
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:17,340
As they do every day,
they checked my bag.

1019
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:21,630
All of a sudden, they pulled out a diamond
from my bag!

1020
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:27,210
They asked me how it got there!
I told them that I did not know!

1021
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,710
They kept asking me
how it got there!

1022
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:31,670
What else could I tell them?

1023
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,590
I swore to them that I didn't know.

1024
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:35,340
No one believed me.

1025
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:38,840
So I tried to call you,
but you didn't pick up, either!

1026
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,500
It just got really crazy!

1027
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,250
They're going over the CCTV footage!

1028
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,750
Tell me, sir.
Oh, really?

1029
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,050
You've checked all the footage?

1030
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:55,630
Oh, so it's not yours!
-Yes, tell her what I told you!

1031
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:57,880
Alright, I'll take care!
-Hello!

1032
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,130
I'll let her know!

1033
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:04,210
Is this about that diamond?
-Yes. I just told him about it.

1034
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:06,500
Come here!

1035
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:11,380
Mekala didn't take the diamond.

1036
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:13,550
It doesn't belong to the store, either.

1037
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,000
They verified it with the CCTV footage.

1038
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:21,590
You can show the bill
and take back the diamond.

1039
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:24,050
Even if the bill is missing,
we can get a copy.

1040
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:27,380
They say the diamond
is worth thirty lakhs!

1041
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:33,840
Must the rat die?

1042
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:37,000
It swallowed my thirty lakh diamond!

1043
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:38,920
I must kill it
and get the diamond out!

1044
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:44,170
The diamond was in our house
but it isn't ours.

1045
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,090
Then whose is it?

1046
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,210
A rat, sir...

1047
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:57,250
If we leave quickly,
we'll reach by evening.

1048
02:09:58,250 --> 02:10:00,210
I need a small carry bag.

1049
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:05,380
How would I know?

1050
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,590
What for?

1051
02:10:07,710 --> 02:10:10,250
I just need one!
Don't ask me why!

1052
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,590
So that's why you kept coming back
to this house!

1053
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:21,920
Not knowing this,
I took the rat out of here.

1054
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:24,920
It's time!
Let's get going!

1055
02:11:25,050 --> 02:11:26,420
We'll toss them out on the way!

1056
02:11:41,170 --> 02:11:42,920
We leave now,
we'll reach by evening!

1057
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:44,710
Hurry!
They keep calling from home!

1058
02:11:58,090 --> 02:12:00,420
Why are you turning?
Thanjavur is straight ahead!

1059
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:46,460
Come on!

1060
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:49,340
If I question him,
he'll whine about not getting any empathy!

1061
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,710
What is it now?

1062
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:48,210
Subtitled at Subemy.
