1
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:31,347
This is a city, one among many
sprawling the expanse of the earth

2
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,055
The hunterwants to kill while
the hunted refuses to comply...

3
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,563
...is an every-day agitation here

4
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,999
Eyes closed, ears plugged,
lips sealed, hands crossed

5
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,969
We aren't slave puppets of yore
doomed to obey order

6
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,008
Heads held high with gumption
duels in an arena of affection

7
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,035
Friends, come...follow
We are here to change the law

8
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,232
Red, blood flowing...fiery red
A hot blooded gang spirited

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,444
lf your evil acts you flaunt
for sure, jail will be your haunt

10
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,915
ln a warfare renowned country
as war lords we march with gallantry

11
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,850
From streaks of lightning
we are the sparks emanating

12
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:21,823
Love us, we'll share our hearts fully
Join us, we'll welcome you, heartily

13
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,502
Head to toe and wrapped all around
Hand and foot we'll leave you bound

14
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,542
Like giant waves sweeping in rapidity
To stop and do away with atrocity

15
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,511
Murderers most cruel, beware
To wring out your bones we dare

16
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,947
Cold blooded mountain bandits
With our arms we suppress

17
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:18,218
Hear! How clever
and cunning we are!

18
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:26,993
lf you defy us, needles we will be
for we are thorns of the coral tree!

19
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,143
Eyes closed, ears plugged,
lips sealed, hands crossed

20
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:43,113
We aren't slave puppets of yore
doomed to obey order

21
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,118
Heads held high with gumption
duels in an arena of affection

22
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,281
Friends, come...follow
We are here to change the law

23
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,292
Hello Baby'cha, it's me
When does your bar open?

24
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,060
Can't you wait till
morning, my dear sir?

25
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,004
Hello?

26
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,971
Who is that dying of thirst?

27
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,706
Pah! Can't you switch it off
at least at midnight? Nuisance!

28
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,711
We got disconnected
Where are you calling from?

29
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,720
- From Dwarakapuri
- What are you saying, sir?

30
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,123
Not from the Lord's abode
From your Dwarakapuri

31
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,987
l dozed off against
the wall of the rest room

32
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,788
by which time your boys
locked up the place

33
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,127
When will you open?

34
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,730
- Now what shall we do?
- Nothing

35
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,296
l'll send one of my boys

36
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,900
Not necessary, don't trouble them
Just tell me where the switches are

37
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,307
Ah! lt's here, got it

38
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,280
What's this?
Lightning and thunder

39
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,089
Sir, butall alone in the baryou?

40
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:40,029
So what? lt's not the devil's den
lt's only a bar, an innocent bar

41
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,035
1st time l'm sitting all alone
in such a big bar and drinking

42
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,164
lf you also want to feel this pleasure,
sit here all alone and drink

43
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,970
After all, you are the owner, isn't it?

44
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:58,946
Baby'chaya, l am going to break
the neck of a Black Dog at your cost

45
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,212
You can go back to sleep

46
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,847
Good night
Sweet dreams

47
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,852
Hello?

48
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,951
Ah marvellous!

49
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,991
There's nobody in our force
who can shoot as sharp as you do

50
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,491
l appreciate that

51
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,753
Do you want to try your hand
in the Grand American Trap?

52
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,162
l'm unable to free my hand
from the traps l'm already in!

53
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,893
You are not at all ambitious

54
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,764
Yes, my ambitions are few

55
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,963
When l do my job diligently
the department rolls its eyes

56
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,041
Next they send stoppers notice
and suspension orders

57
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,133
So what have you collected more?
Salary or suspension?

58
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,838
Suspension is the award Govt
gives to people with guts

59
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,244
Only favoured people get it

60
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,044
You are on the verge of
being favoured again, right?

61
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,111
So careless! A man's greatness is
how he shoulders his responsibilities

62
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,784
You are king of a single-room palace
That too, a rented room!

63
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,488
Brother, if you're here to counsel me
l'll go to someone who's better at it

64
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,566
Okay, l'm not saying anything more
l've been blabbering for years in vain!

65
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,267
Shall we go to the party hosted by
the SP (Superintendent of Police)?

66
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,997
The SP inviting me today
will suspend me tomorrow

67
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,265
lt won't look good, Bala

68
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,000
No, l have some other work

69
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,803
So just drop in today,
have 2 pegs and leave

70
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,207
Once l start drinking,
l can't stop at 2 pegs

71
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,938
l'm very weak in that aspect

72
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,078
Come!

73
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,881
Sir, did you meet Bala?

74
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,455
- How many did you down so far, Bala?
- Haven't counted

75
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,152
My dear sir, once Balan starts drinking
he'll stop only after drying up a whole range

76
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:53,289
Never ask a women's age, a man's salary
and the number of pegs Bala drinks

77
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,964
So Bala is neither
a man nor a woman?

78
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,434
Don't poke fun at me

79
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,972
l'll show you if l'm a man
or woman, want to see?

80
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,439
- Bala!
- Okay, l'm sorry

81
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,840
Come

82
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,612
Brother, want to play a game?

83
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,848
Not now, let me talk
to Deputy SP Rawther

84
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,215
Deal a hand for me too, guys

85
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,519
How far has your case
investigation reached, Bala?

86
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,132
As usual, just as it reached
a stage for an arrest

87
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,566
they transferred me
claiming inefficient investigation

88
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,265
A small slip-up on my part
has become a major issue now

89
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,941
lf l catch those criminals,
all l can do now is

90
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,038
kiss them and say
dear son, go home!

91
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,514
No complaints!
All will be happy

92
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,847
Sure! Asking the criminals
to go home is easy

93
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,478
But make sure
you also reach home on time

94
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,582
Of course, l'll go home on time
l don't have a joker in the pocket like you

95
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,662
- Bala, watch your words
- That's exactly what l did!

96
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,452
What will you do?

97
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,430
You've been itching forthis, haven't you!
l'll cure this itchforyou!

98
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,091
Bala, what is this?
Come away

99
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,436
Move aside
Useless!

100
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,666
You think l am useless as you are
unworthy of the position you hold

101
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,068
Don't act too smart, okay?

102
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,469
- Didn't l warn you not to come here?
- l said, come away

103
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:25,386
Aah! Ma!

104
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,119
Bala'etta!

105
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,460
Aaahh

106
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,627
Bala'etta

107
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,931
What is it?!

108
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,034
The boss called us this morning

109
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,739
Sorry sir, l don't know
how this happened

110
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,444
l too have no clue

111
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,256
l'll be back tonight also
To escape other hassles

112
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,656
This guy can go and sleep
l will be there as a guard, right?

113
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,736
Hello, Anwar
l'm at home only

114
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,272
When?
Oh!

115
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,566
Aterrible and cruel murder
has happened here

116
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:31,371
The son of prominent businessman and
politician, Kunian Varghese Punjakad

117
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,709
Thomas Punjakadan, is the victim
who has been so brutally murdered

118
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,577
Chief lnspector in charge
Abdul Latheef is here

119
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,345
What are your initial deductions?

120
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,149
lt is truly unfortunate
We can't say anything more now

121
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,089
Personally, do you think
this was a politically related murder?

122
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,855
The media can come to your own
conclusions, but we as police can't

123
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,096
l'm sorry

124
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,297
l hope, more details will show up
This is Anwar, with cameraman Shaji

125
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,096
Network Channel

126
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,830
Shaji, just hold this please
l'll just go relieve myself

127
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,872
Okay da, come soon

128
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,342
Bala'etta, now we don't
even have time to pee

129
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,673
Get relieved fully!

130
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,908
This is really a terrible scene

131
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,774
When he was alive
it was worse

132
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,249
- You go pee, man!
- l'll be right back

133
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,660
Kerala is literally stunned by the news
of the murder of Thomas Punjakadan

134
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,824
This incident is creating
major ripples in Kerala politics

135
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,528
Political leaders of
various parties are reacting

136
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,470
MLA, CPJohnny is on the line
with us...over to his reaction

137
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:40,409
CPJohnny, how does your party
view this murder your young leader?

138
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,777
We are all shocked,
as if struck by lightning

139
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,442
The loss to the party
and people is colossal

140
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,318
That such an event has happened in
our enlightened Kerala is shameful

141
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,516
How cruel to kill someone
and nail him on to a cross!

142
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,854
lt looks like killing him
was not the contention

143
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,393
Tying him to the cross was!

144
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,932
True! They say an event like this has never
happened anywhere before in the world

145
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,226
Unbearable sight
Right, Balachandran sir?

146
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,668
lt's true and l feel very sad

147
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,296
Why feel sad, Bala?

148
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,838
Because the crucified person
is not the Messiah of Lord

149
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,571
He did cross swords with you
and got you into deep trouble too

150
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,909
But is it worth nursing such enmity
to someone who is now dead?

151
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,449
Punjakadans are suspects
in the Venjyara murder case

152
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,484
This could possibly be
a retaliation from them

153
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,678
Chances are low

154
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,778
This doesn't seem like
a typical political murder

155
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,791
True, if it was,
they'd have just killed him

156
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,554
They won't botherto
nail him on a cross like this

157
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,992
Who caresthe deed is done?!

158
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,698
Just see if the murderer now
attends the funeral feast

159
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,597
Or consult astrologers
Atukal or Unni Pannikar

160
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,930
They'll prophesy
using their cowrie-shells

161
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,631
- Why does that make you angry?
- l am just stating facts, not angry

162
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,400
Stop making
an issue out of this

163
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,942
Bala, come here
Come here

164
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,681
They were already
discussing this before you came

165
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,545
Knowing your anger,
they had cooled down

166
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,346
But hearing them talk,
it's obvious they suspect you

167
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,784
Oh is it like that?
That's not bad

168
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,344
Bala, any slip-up by mistake?

169
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,617
l don't commit slip-ups

170
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,558
lf l feel he deserved it
l'll ensure he's finished

171
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,461
No

172
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,960
lt's still going on, not over yet

173
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,004
Thank you very much, Uma

174
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,679
ls my presence
still required here, sir?

175
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,645
- No, its fine, you can leave
- Thank you

176
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,854
-Ah! Latheef
- What do you think, sir?

177
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,249
No doubt it's a brutal murder
All his internal organs are bruised

178
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,261
Severe torture
has also taken place

179
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,591
A detailed report?

180
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,790
Within 2 days
l'll call you, Latheef

181
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,389
- Thank you, sir
- Okay

182
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,633
Thomas Punjakadan's body, after postmortem
has been handed over to his family

183
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,508
The funeral is at 11:00 AM tomorrow

184
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,911
The public can pay their last respects
at the town hall by 8:00 AM

185
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:02,454
Can you and l be
on the same level equally?

186
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,282
Oh Lord!

187
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,290
What, life of my life?
Are you very tired?

188
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,020
Yeah! Tired of running around!

189
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,957
Rundoesn't the common man
need to have his daily fill of hot news?

190
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,590
How long are you planning
to rejoice Punjakadan murder?

191
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,000
Stop flirting and get me
something to eat, l'm starving

192
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,971
Eat? But l haven't been
to the kitchen at all today

193
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,440
Must l cook and
fill your stomach also?

194
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,306
Go quickly and make
a few chapattis, my girl!

195
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,606
l'm tired
You go make them, da!

196
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,113
Yeah! And you'll also eat!

197
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,822
- Good evening, Bala'etta
- Good evening

198
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,828
How was the 1st day of
the Punjakadan murder case?

199
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,864
Did you find out
which Bheeman killed him?

200
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,332
Do the police
have any clue?

201
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,802
Not a chance!
They've just begun nosing around

202
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,432
What about you,
Dr Mrs Uma Antharjanam?

203
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,808
A word from me, this guy makes it news
and for authenticity he quotes me also

204
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,041
Not even the slightest
Consideration l'm his wife

205
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,586
Yeah right, anyone would think
l'm a reporter thanks to her

206
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,713
Bala'etta, l'll just come
Let me change out of these clothes

207
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,925
l was there for the autopsy

208
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,122
They have evidently
beaten him into pulp

209
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,558
Any other crucial info?

210
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,794
The murder was very well planned
lt shows an expert's hand

211
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,429
They have stuffed him up fully
with glucose so that he won't die fast

212
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,035
ln the shortest time, he has experienced
extreme pain before he died

213
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,137
lt's the Lord's quotation (to kill )
When the police find out, we'll know

214
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,509
Hey! So what is your plan?
l'm hungry enough to eat an elephant

215
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,813
l have a solution

216
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,411
Go south for Changanassery
Chandrashekaran (elephant)

217
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,151
Or if you want Guruvayur Keshavan
go straight north, to Taj (hotel)

218
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,591
- Both are elephants
- Done

219
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,663
- Sponsored by Balachandran, okay?
- You seem extremely happy today

220
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,164
l'm happy, but only rarely, right?!

221
00:18:55,534 --> 00:19:00,164
For a supper in the eternal memory
of the great Thomas Kurein Poonjakadan

222
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,906
- Come, let's leave
- Let's go

223
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,081
- Georgel'll leave
- Okay

224
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,615
l'll call you

225
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,685
Cremation is over

226
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,924
l don't think grandfather will talk now

227
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,524
What is it, Ali'kka?

228
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,995
Johnny says the Home minister
is on his way here

229
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,191
Who will go there now
and inform him?

230
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:33,504
l can't bearto face him
Let the minister come

231
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,112
Varkey sir?

232
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,552
He is in the prayer room
He is not willing to meet anyone

233
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,817
Maybe if you go there yourself?

234
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,716
l'll be back soon

235
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,673
Varkey sir?

236
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:15,074
What crime did he commit
to be tortured on a cross?

237
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,209
l don't know
what to say, Varkey sir

238
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:27,649
l'll make sure whoever did this
will be brought to justice

239
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,995
Not into the hands of law
l want him in front of me

240
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,222
SP Ramdas is taking charge today

241
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,694
A special investigation
team will be formed

242
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,198
Who could have done this?

243
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,972
l am in a conference
l'll call you back, when it's over

244
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,916
l'm Superintendent of Police TRamdas
Good to see you

245
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:01,058
l called you here to discuss details
of the Punjakadan murder case

246
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,055
l have seen the case diary

247
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,958
Postmortem report says

248
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:09,090
Thomas Poonjakadan was
tortured before being killed

249
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,795
This has to be investigated
thoroughly once more

250
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,736
Latheef, you were the preliminary
investigator weren't you?

251
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,105
Yes sir, we've been ordered to submit
our investigation reports tomorrow

252
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,142
What are your conclusions?

253
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,977
Thomas had plenty of enemies politically
lt might be a quotation by one of them

254
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,880
He was also involved in
many businesses deals in lndia

255
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,114
as well as abroad, quotation
may have come through that source too

256
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:37,128
Anyway this is a very sensitive case
There is a huge outcry among the public

257
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:42,363
Extremely influential people are waiting
eagerly for the report of this investigation

258
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,727
The guy who died was powerful
So pressure is also high

259
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,332
So we need to get results and
finish the investigation fast

260
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,837
That's all
Good night

261
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,878
Latheef?

262
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,177
Where is our Chief lnspector
Balachandran these days?

263
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,745
You mean, hot-headed Balan?
He is undergoing suspension orders

264
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,289
l know that
Where is he?

265
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,053
He hangs around here,
in a big setup

266
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,755
Real estate, share market
and other such activities

267
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,023
l see

268
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,761
Who the dickens is it at this hour?

269
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,781
Hello?
Who is it?

270
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,643
lt's me

271
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,945
- Me?
- Yeah

272
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,951
Don't you have a name?

273
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,351
The name is, hot-headed Balan

274
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,253
Hot-headed Balan is your-
Tell me your name, son

275
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,019
Don't abuse on an empty stomach

276
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,220
lf you have the guts,
come to the kitchen

277
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,227
- To the kitchen?
- Yeah

278
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,971
Brother!
Ramdas bro?!

279
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,208
Look at those sparse down-feathers
Brother, you look like a turkey now

280
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,148
Don't remind me about it

281
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,379
So many days since you called
Don't you need me anymore?

282
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,853
Drink this for now

283
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,315
You are diabetic, right?

284
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,758
220 fasting
How did you know?

285
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,261
There is no sugar in this

286
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,863
l did that deliberately
Don't use too much sugar

287
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,800
A morning jog is good instead of
sleeping like this, come let's talk

288
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,135
l was really stunned when l saw all this
Really a good setup, brother

289
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,265
l have lots of other properties like this

290
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,273
- Really?
- Yeah

291
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,707
So what do you do?

292
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,401
Everything that can be done
deluding others

293
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:12,313
Share market, Real estate and
l haven't left my old hobby eithercards

294
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,111
Have they transferred you here?

295
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,346
Yesterday, a memo
from the home department

296
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,185
saying this cross has
to be borne by me now

297
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,226
Such fellows won't leave you in peace
even after being nailed on a cross

298
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,419
How are the kids?

299
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,020
They are not
your playmates anymore

300
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,760
One daughter is a doctor
The other is finishing her engineering

301
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,195
How time flies!

302
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,067
l must get them married

303
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,903
l will come then, not only to
invite their favorite Bala uncle

304
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,409
But to ask a loan from
the real estate broker

305
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,207
Or l'll have to steal

306
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,249
For that you need brains
lt's not like a policeman's job

307
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,410
l agree l'm a simple
Kerala policeman

308
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,184
The smarter ones are real estate
brokers and Harshad Mehtas!

309
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,327
Forget all that
How's Savithri amma?

310
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,461
She enquires about you often
When she gets fresh water fish

311
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,058
she asks, will Balan
come with 1/2 bottle rum?

312
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,262
She has been waiting
so long to see you

313
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,565
Why don't you visit us
one of these days?

314
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,274
l will comel must

315
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,943
How can l forget
those waiting for me?

316
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,477
Did you see
Jayashree after that?

317
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,984
Of course! When l went
to sign the divorce petition

318
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,989
The reason l've come, as l told you
is the impending Punjakadan case

319
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,484
l need you working with me
l'll get your suspension withdrawn

320
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,024
No, l have wound up all that!
Enough is enough

321
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,894
ls this, some reality
show you just wind up

322
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,467
saying l'm signing
off now from this program?

323
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,899
Just do as l tell you

324
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,335
No
A big 'No'

325
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,408
- Sure?
- Sure!

326
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,809
Punjakadan was
a rival of yours, right?

327
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,408
My rival is only God and l do agree
my last suspension was his handiwork

328
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,383
Any idea of retribution
forthe suspension?

329
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,317
l did have some ideas

330
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,855
But he got dismissed
before thatfate!

331
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,083
Fate

332
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,840
- Who are you?
- Ali Koya

333
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:16,873
l meant, in what capacity?

334
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:22,175
l myself don't know if l'm the driver,
housekeeper or member of the family

335
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,314
- ls Varkey sir here?
- He is inside

336
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,214
- Tell him we are here
- l'll go and tell him

337
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,284
This guy is famous, he's the route
to get into Punjakadan's house

338
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,661
Sir, my condolences!
l'm SP Ramdas

339
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,463
Thank you, sir

340
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,636
lf its fine, l'd like to
ask you a few questions

341
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,172
What was the real reason
behind Thomas's Kuwait trip?

342
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,681
A business trip

343
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,513
Other than politics what
other business did he manage?

344
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,956
For us Punjakadans
politics is not a business

345
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,920
Sir, l meant-

346
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:15,022
Hotels, distillery, export, farming
and he dabbled a little in real estate

347
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,966
And all this was managed by Thomas?

348
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,440
Apart from Gulf countries, didn't he
go on trips to Lanka, Bangkok?

349
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:28,306
Yes, he was crazy about travelling

350
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,048
Was George Joseph
his business partner?

351
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,141
Not only partner, his cousin
My brother's only son

352
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,582
Do you know if Thomas had any
enemies in business or politics?

353
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,956
lt's only now, we understand
the kind of enemies he had made

354
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:48,432
l believe the aim of killing Thomas
was also to shatter you mentally?

355
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,160
Do you know of anyone in the opposition
or your own party who might do-

356
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,103
Hey SP! What are you insinuating?

357
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,106
Sir, as a policeman
we must think of all angle-

358
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,008
l've also occupied a police
official's chairfor 5-6 years

359
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,538
l know very well

360
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,640
You don't have to explain
how they function

361
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,480
Sir, since you were
in the force for 5 years

362
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,047
can l assume you'll have
no objections co-operating with us?

363
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,526
We may have to come again

364
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,001
Suspicion that Punjakadan's murder
had the hand of high officials

365
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,230
This could be a move
by rival party members...

366
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:32,265
...to instigate a by-election immediately,
believes PC Johnny MLA

367
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,210
lt is believed that the perpetrators
could have fled the country

368
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,747
lnterpol help may be sought
by the investigation team

369
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,615
All these channels behave like
Agatha Christie's grandchildren!

370
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,245
Did you notice?
All the traits of a crime thriller

371
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,353
Don't scorn

372
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,255
History has proof that investigative
journalism has often helped police

373
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,193
l'm not scorning, l'm unable to get
a landing on the whole thing

374
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,060
Sometimes when murder
is pre-planned

375
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,532
criminals resort to gimmicks
just to confuse the police

376
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,103
Couldn't this cross
be one of those?

377
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,696
Correct, but he was
not killed on the cross

378
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,297
He was killed and then
nailed to the cross later

379
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,242
We see a master assassin's tactics

380
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,213
This is not simply your guess
There is something in it

381
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,442
No, he deserves it

382
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,644
He was someone
who had to die this way

383
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:21,419
To find the criminal
is the police's job, right?

384
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,327
Brother, you'll be given
a run for your money!

385
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,192
Let's wait and see

386
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,299
Please come in
l'm Ramdas

387
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,809
l've heard about you,
from the DGP

388
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,210
Take a seat

389
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,506
George sir is a little peeved
since you asked him to come here

390
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,209
He is a busy man, you see

391
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,254
l wanted to come and meet you
but l got a little busy too

392
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,189
l understand all that
lt's not an issue at all

393
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,759
This guy is not in service anymore
Don't you know him, Ramdas?

394
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,494
He tried to get
Thomas into trouble

395
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,832
Sir knows all that,
my dear George

396
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,800
Where is Thomas?
Don't seem to see him around?!

397
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,571
Oh, this sir is so weird!
Doesn't watch TV nor read the papers

398
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,201
lsn't it the paper
l'm reading right now?

399
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,804
- Latheef?
- Sir!

400
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,677
So the keys to all of Thomas's secrets
are in your hand, right George?

401
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:27,281
What secrets? What keys?
His life was an open book

402
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,587
Maybe it was too open and so
it just fell apart at the seams

403
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,390
His detractors said
many things like this

404
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,123
Tried to nab him also,
in a false case

405
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,362
-And see what happened?
- When you say detractors?

406
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,734
Enemies! He was into politics after all
Some policemen also tried their luck

407
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,673
A lot of them are not
in the service anymore

408
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,709
Lucky they are still alive!

409
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,245
l'll tell you something, sir

410
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,338
Don't play games in front of
useless fellows like this chap

411
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,314
Pah! Son of -

412
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,714
Hey! Bala!

413
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,818
Didn't you learn a lesson
with your police games earlier?

414
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:03,383
l stopped all those games
Now l play new ones, want to learn?

415
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,123
Bala, you go
l want to talk to George alone

416
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,927
He's like the treasury
of Lord Padmanabhan

417
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,794
Never know
what you can dig out

418
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,927
- Go
- l'll see you around, George

419
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,505
- You already know Balan, right George?
- Of course! He is an ass

420
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,645
Leave it, George

421
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:29,379
Any idea where Thomas went
after saying he was off to Kuwait??

422
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,818
Lord! What are you talking about?

423
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,518
He was in Kuwait
and called me too, twice

424
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:40,428
- How can we confirm he was there?
- See, l have the number in my phone

425
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,567
He called from this number

426
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:50,171
0096565108023 This is indeed
a Kuwait number, isn't it Latheef?

427
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,675
Yeah, it is 'white'
so Ku-white (Kuwait) indeed!

428
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,169
Sorry to have disturbed you

429
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,477
You are welcome to
disturb many more times

430
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,483
This is all for our Thomas, after all

431
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,782
All you have to do is
get us the criminals

432
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,322
We, Poonjakadans will handle the rest

433
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,184
- So, shall l leave?
- Okay

434
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,730
He is highly poisonous, sir
Afine broker, a power-broker

435
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:20,259
Between George and
our Balan, as well as Thomas

436
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,637
there were some past issues
l smell something rotten

437
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,945
My God!
Has he come finally?

438
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,779
Where were you so long?
We were all eating fire here

439
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,220
Why? Didn't you get
rice and curry to eat today?

440
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,416
We don't want to
hear your witty jokes

441
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:45,428
The police left late in the night
Searched this colony high and low

442
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,329
Go, get me some water

443
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:55,868
- What happened, Ali'kka?
- lnterrogated me left and right

444
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,670
ln 35 years l've seen a lot of
policemen in Punjakadan house

445
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,609
But, these people were terrible

446
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,944
- Here, dad
-And then?

447
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:13,653
They squeezed everything out of me
except the milk my mother nursed me

448
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,421
My God!
Did they hurt you?

449
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,690
Thankfully they didn't manhandle me
ln case they had done that then!

450
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,628
They are searching
the whole place thoroughly

451
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,530
We will all have
to run away somewhere

452
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,432
And some poor innocent
will then be caught

453
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,528
lt's all a big game, a game
manipulated from up above

454
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,539
Best to go hide
some place across the sea

455
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:34,008
You can't withstand
police questioning tactics

456
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:39,414
They ask such terrible questions
That new SP is a cunning rogue!

457
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,481
Chief lnspector in service shouldn't
salute one who is under suspension

458
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,388
Force of habit, sir!

459
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,450
Policemen have to
get rid of many old habits

460
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,721
ls the boss in there?

461
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,695
He wanted to see me
urgently, an orderwhy?

462
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,858
l neither asked him
nor did he tell me

463
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:57,696
All the more better!

464
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,860
Are you full time
with Ramdas now?

465
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,632
Sir, you should also
be with us in the team

466
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,331
Well, it's too late now

467
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,770
Come

468
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,309
l see a shooting setup, brother

469
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,709
lf you had told me earlier
l'd have put on some makeup

470
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,541
What do you need makeup for?
You look handsome as you are

471
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,482
l maintain it with great difficulty
You also can try it

472
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,984
Okay, sure

473
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:23,619
Sometimes evidences and clues
fall right into our hands unexpectedly

474
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,629
One such evidence l got
in the Punjakadan case

475
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,792
which unfortunately
is against you, Bala

476
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,473
So this meeting is strictly official

477
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,809
l understand

478
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,544
Ask me
l'll reply

479
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,742
Bala, when did you last
meet Thomas Punjakadan?

480
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,784
S Balachandran
is my official name

481
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,047
And regarding the answer
l don't remember

482
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,818
- l will remind you
- Please

483
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,089
On May 6th
at hotel Blue Moon

484
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:52,980
ln the same hotel on the same day, room 3002
was occupied by Thomas Punjakadan & friends

485
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,884
And you in room 2003, a mirror image
of the same number, correct?

486
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,113
Yes, correct

487
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,787
What was your intention?

488
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,222
My usual activity
to play cards

489
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,153
- Don't you know this?
- No, l don't

490
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,953
Then l am telling you now
l go to that hotel only to play cards

491
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,659
A five star hotel to play cards?
l find it hard to believe that

492
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,431
That's a problem with police in uniform
They don't believe anyone

493
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,506
lf you can't believe it
then don't

494
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,042
That's the kind of life style,
Balendran sir leads now-a-days

495
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:26,746
From May 6th to 9th, the time Thomas
went missing, you were not in town

496
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,043
- Where were you?
- Masanagudi

497
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,546
Masanagudi!
Where were you staying?

498
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,951
Me and some friends, in the forest

499
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,888
Forest?
What for?

500
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,856
l had a meeting with a lion

501
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,021
-Answer my question
- Okay

502
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,826
- What was your purpose?
- Drinking and playing cards

503
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:46,594
Thomas Poonjakadan was responsible
for your suspension order, wasn't he?

504
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,003
That was top secret, you actually
found that out finally, excellent!

505
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,167
Bala l told you!
Don't fool around

506
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,702
l'm not playing, sir

507
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,905
l don't usually reveal that he was
responsible for my suspension

508
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:03,214
The disgrace was not for me alone but also
forthe entire police department in public

509
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,486
When l was the Cl at Town station
l got a phone call one day

510
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:12,826
A decent and honest constable, Velayudan
tried to commit suicide and was in the lCU

511
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:20,835
What happened?

512
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,905
My daughter went to school
and didn't return home

513
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,239
She usually comes back
after tuition by 6:00 PM

514
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:31,008
lt became 7 and 8:00 PM
but still she didn't come

515
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,638
Didn't you call
anyone to find out?

516
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,682
We did

517
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,678
When we called herteacher, she said
she hadn't come to school that day

518
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,955
We wanted to find
phone numbers of herfriends

519
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,994
And so looked through
her things in her room

520
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,972
- Velayudha'etta our daughter?
- Stop worrying

521
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,576
- Radhika!
- What?

522
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,679
Velayuda'etta!

523
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,890
Oh God! My daughter!

524
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,607
What have you done?
Oh God!

525
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,051
Sir, my daughter?

526
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,682
Don't cry
Let me investigate

527
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,929
You'll be stunned when l tell you
l saw it with my own eyes

528
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,264
Velayudhan's daughter,
10th grade student

529
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,362
was a drug peddler and
eats icecream in 5 star hotels

530
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,240
And she was not alone
Her friend was there too, Merlyn

531
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,783
Sir, have you heard of paedophiles?

532
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,876
lt means 'sexual preference
to very young girls' in Malayalam

533
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,387
They are people who are sexually
attracted to girls below 12 years of age

534
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,957
Supplying such girls was
Thomas Punjakadan's job

535
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:27,724
And Nirmala Thangachi
Femina Beauty Spot owner

536
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:34,003
Nirmala's lover, a software engineer
Prateesh Nambiyar, was 10 years herjunior

537
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,970
He was Thangachi's soft drink

538
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,074
Nirmal Prasad, an expert in smuggling
cocaine and brown sugar and other drugs

539
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:48,209
who recruited such young girls,
was also the owner of Pagoda Resorts

540
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,913
Pagoda resort

541
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,223
A pagoda of flesh-traders!

542
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,341
Lovely

543
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,677
Beautiful!

544
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,443
George, why is this girl
so unresponsive?

545
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,917
lsn't it in your hands
to make her responsive, Thomas

546
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,285
She is a new item

547
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,886
Nirmala knows my style

548
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,123
At first it's like stroking a flower

549
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,236
When l finish,
she'll be like a thrashing tuna

550
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,001
Who asked you to
let these people in?

551
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,169
When it's time we come in
without permission, Punjakada

552
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,113
To walk in without permission
is this a policeman's in-law's home?

553
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,082
Your!

554
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:36,388
l know that this pagoda of yours
is not a meditation centre

555
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:40,155
This butcher-shop where you trade
flesh of young girls

556
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,394
l'm going to
burn it down, Punjakadan

557
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,798
You and your comrades
can quit savouring this flavour

558
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,431
Punjakadan will continue savouring it
You won't be able to change my recipe

559
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,068
Oh! When you say dialogs that deserve
a beating, how can l resist not hitting you?

560
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,222
One of the girls was constable
Velayudan's daughter

561
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,454
This was a group with
its roots all over Kerala

562
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,361
They use the girls
as 1st bootleggers

563
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,902
Later, using threats and blackmail
they send these girls to vvlP rooms

564
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,030
Once their body and minds are
destroyed these girls are found

565
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,076
lying on a railway track
or in some mental asylum

566
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:31,308
With the arrest of Punjakad l was sure
l could make a big move against them

567
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,110
But nothing happened

568
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,177
Before l even reached the station
we got the order to release him

569
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,417
And a departmental inquiry
against me on multiple charges

570
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:46,553
Even constable Velayudan who barely
escaped death was reluctant to file a case

571
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,258
Fear for his life and
fear of dishonour

572
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,524
But, why should l be afraid of anyone?

573
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,400
For every woman who flinches
at her husband's name!

574
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,100
For girls who are afraid to
even sit on their fathers' laps!

575
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,168
l was determined
l had some plans

576
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,314
l went to discuss it with Anwar

577
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,946
- Bala'ttan
- Oh! God

578
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,029
Bala'etta!

579
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,223
1 1l2months l was in
the medical college hospital

580
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,561
My condition was bad, it was doubtful
if l'd escape with minor damages

581
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:06,199
The department didn't even try
to solve the false cases against me

582
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,210
There is 1 remaining, even today

583
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,575
Balachandra, knowing the truth

584
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,345
why didn't you file a case
against them for attempted murder?

585
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,045
Where?
ln which court?

586
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,213
l had already decided on
my plans to deal with him

587
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,655
l want to know
if you executed it?

588
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,226
- l didn't get a chance
- Are you sure?

589
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:29,532
Yes

590
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:42,169
That's all
l'm sorry

591
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,612
lt's of no use, brother

592
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,057
Poor Ramdas's suspicions
are still not cleared

593
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,129
Only you can help, Latheef

594
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,188
Me?
What can l do, sir?

595
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,425
l'll tell you, but before that
you must do me a favor

596
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,473
You must get me all the details of the case
Especially Punjakadan's business deals

597
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,735
And also George Joseph's full history

598
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,508
The interviews videos, everything
We must open a new case file

599
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,143
This is a job that might get you fired
from your post, are you scared?

600
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:28,487
Let them! We have our real estate
Both of us can rock with that

601
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,413
- What do you think, Latheef?
- Frankly l have no idea, sir

602
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,712
Joseph Punjakkad who left
by flight never reached Kuwait

603
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,656
But George Joseph swears
he got a call from him in Kuwait

604
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,621
Ali'kka says he dropped him
at the airport, we know that also

605
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:12,166
So someone has picked him up
before he boarded the flight

606
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:16,434
tortured him for a few days,
killed him and brought him to the beach

607
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,686
- So is George Joseph lying?
- Not necessarily

608
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,129
Aiyo!! Oh God!
Report to cabin immediately

609
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:49,137
SP sir's message, something's wrong
l think he found out that l copied the files

610
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,234
Don't worry, l sent that
text message from this system

611
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,410
But this is Ramdas sir's number

612
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,207
Nowadays it's very easy to fake it
by mobile number spoofing

613
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,750
Anyone can send messages or
call from anyone else's number

614
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:04,343
So George Joseph's phone call
could also have been the same way

615
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:09,289
Oh God! l nearly fainted
So can we not trace the origin?

616
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,792
lt's quite difficult

617
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:14,456
Have you heard of lP address
lnternet Protocol address?

618
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,759
That also can be masked

619
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,733
How do you know all this, sir?

620
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,771
l don't have any police work to do
and need to occupy myself

621
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,339
The computer is a good friend

622
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,740
lf you are in a hurry, carry on

623
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,839
- Give this to me
- Thank you, sir

624
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,306
There is an interesting turn of events

625
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,851
When l was going through recent
transactions of George Joseph

626
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,385
l came across a strange entry

627
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,455
He has sold
a bungalow in Mercara

628
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,753
to the forensic surgeon
Dr Chandrababu

629
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,587
Bought from some Veer Mahashetty

630
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,528
lt wouldn't be George
lt is only a fake identity

631
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,625
Agreed, but how did
Dr Chandrababu buy it?

632
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,704
He doesn't have that kind
of wealth, l checked all that

633
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:07,367
So Punjakadans
must have gifted it to him

634
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,309
- Why, sir?
- Why do you think?

635
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,346
lt was a payment
in return for a favor

636
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,283
There was a secret between
George and the doctor

637
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,550
Or between the dead
Thomas and doctor

638
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:20,520
Okay, leave all that

639
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,717
There is another
more important matter

640
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,453
- You know doctor Uma, right?
- Yes, sir

641
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:30,522
l discussed with her and found there
was a gross mistake in the autopsy report

642
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,532
What is it?

643
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:38,239
ln Punjakadan's chest or thorax there is
a wound, as if caused by a gunshot

644
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,276
But they have not found the bullet

645
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:47,010
lf he was killed by a bullet
it would be a pivotal evidence

646
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,352
What if Chandrababu hid this fact?

647
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:55,349
You must communicate
this to Ramdasconvince him

648
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,325
Discuss with the doctor
the possibility of exhuming the body

649
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:04,695
But remember, l'm not
involved in this, nor is Dr Uma

650
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,531
lsn't it better
if you tell him directly?

651
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,470
No! Ramdas is distancing
himself from me

652
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,667
lf he feels l was trying to mislead him
our efforts will be wasted

653
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,073
Noyou tell it

654
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,744
lf it succeeds you will get
all the credit

655
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,378
Let's hope forthe best

656
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,275
l was the one
who appeared in that murder case

657
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,649
The file is with me

658
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,646
Dr Uma? A chick who hasn't
hatched out of the egg

659
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,453
What will she know?
Okay! Okay!

660
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,810
Da, Shyam!

661
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,046
Get up!

662
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,685
What are your intentions?
lt is 11 :00 AM

663
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:06,126
Don't you have school today?
Didn't you hear me?

664
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,829
- What happened?
- Come, come

665
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,729
Your school principal called
He is short of attendance

666
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,359
He is lagging in 3 papers

667
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,699
His report card has
a red mark in every column

668
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,070
Where the hell are you going to
on the pretext of going to school?

669
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,066
His attention is not in studies

670
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:23,374
What is happening to you?
How will you write these exams?

671
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,811
l'll write them somehow

672
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,449
- Move
- Maaa!

673
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,745
ls the board of examinations
holding exams at your convenience?

674
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,084
All the teachers say
he is a bright student

675
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,593
lf you take his side, l will kill you
You are the one ruining him

676
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,026
His brightness is shown elsewhere

677
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,656
What is all this?
What is this?

678
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,730
This is an experiment l'm doing

679
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:52,939
Cardioverter defibrillator
A device to prevent cardiac arrest

680
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:58,976
A chip to prevent cardiac arrest
in patients with arrhythmia

681
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,606
Damn chip and your experiment!

682
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,413
Papa!
Papano!

683
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,884
Experiments and
computer genius, my foot!

684
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,753
Bury it all today

685
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,920
He built that up
working without sleep

686
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,031
You don't understand
his talent and aptitude

687
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,394
Shut your bloody mouth!

688
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,695
lf l see anymore such madness sitting

689
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,703
in front of the computer
and surfing late night

690
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,466
l won't spare both of you

691
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,633
He is mad! Take him to
a psychiatrist and treat him

692
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,405
Otherwise l will do
something really cruel

693
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,445
Maaa!

694
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,715
Come in
Please sit down

695
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,795
Doctor, Thomas Punjakadan's autopsy report

696
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:58,564
We found some omissions
and contradictions

697
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,142
Please clearthem

698
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:11,653
lmpossible! Because of the importance
of the case l was very careful in autopsy

699
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:15,748
There's no way this bullet could be missed
lt's not a mustard or cumin seed, right?

700
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,487
Some doubts need not
be wrong, isn't it, doctor?

701
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,893
Doctor, you suspected it was
cardiac arrest that killed him

702
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,555
Not suspicion
l'm sure

703
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:30,129
Okay, doctor you've recorded that
his chest wound looked like he was shot

704
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,040
lf there was an entry wound
there must be an exit wound

705
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,543
Or a bullet inside the body

706
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,603
We neither have an exit wound
nor have we found a bullet

707
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,614
l can't produce
what was not there, right?

708
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,777
No you can't, but if there was
a bullet, it would be very important

709
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,912
Why can't we think of
a re-postmortem?

710
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:49,651
This is sheer foolishness
based on a wild suspicion

711
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,751
you cannot dig up a buried body

712
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,090
And even if you do, you will not
get any information out of it

713
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:57,598
lf we don't get a result after
exhumation, who'll give explanations?

714
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,998
lf you are always that perfect

715
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:02,936
we wouldn't need re-postmortems
and exhumations, right doctor?

716
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,673
Anyway we can't
ignore this possibility

717
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,710
Regardless of your
co operation, we will do it

718
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,557
- Shaji, don't turn it off, okay?
- Nono, l wont

719
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,961
What is the meaning of this, Father?

720
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,828
How can you remove
an interred body

721
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,333
and give it to these guys
to do as they please?

722
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,628
The church can't interfere
in police work

723
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:39,004
Oh my poor cousin Thomas's soul!
They can resort to anything

724
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,873
We gave it to them once to tear
and now what has happened?

725
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,309
Thomas is not in that body

726
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,144
lt is just his discarded clothes

727
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,149
Just a body
For the investigation-

728
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:52,347
lnvestigation! Nonsense
This is all a game

729
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:56,753
l know who is behind this
l won't spare anyone of you

730
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,995
Latheefgo

731
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,564
George, come here

732
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,659
Why are you more bothered than
Thomas's father and mother?

733
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,966
l'm bothered and l have no belief
in this investigation and nonsense

734
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,699
- Move aside
- l won't!

735
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh my dear Thomas!

736
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,634
Stop acting and move aside

737
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:16,937
And if l don't?

738
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:23,646
You don't know me! When that coffin
is back, l'll kick and bury you along in it

739
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,727
Yes, we got it
1 bullet

740
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,094
Normally, this doesn't happen

741
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,605
The bullet was pierced
in a particular point in the lungs

742
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:52,214
What you got was a real bullet, doctor?
Sure it's not a mustard or cumin seed?

743
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:57,276
We must send it to the lab immediately
This is not a conventional bullet

744
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,754
lt's possible to have been fired
from a country-made gun

745
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,925
- Move aside
- No need

746
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,127
Excuse me, what did
the exhumation reveal?

747
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,162
We got a very important clue
We found a bullet from the body

748
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,037
Which area of
the investigation will that help?

749
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,044
We can't reveal to media
all the areas of our investigations

750
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,773
We have to trace the gun
from which the bullet was fired

751
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,405
And that will be a big clue

752
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,974
lsn't it a big drawback that
the 1st examination did not reveal it?

753
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,352
The police shall ask questions,
not the media, now move them aside

754
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,219
Sir, sir!

755
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:39,762
The evidence found is truly decisive
says S P Ramdas in charge

756
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:43,026
The operation was 100% successful

757
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:48,033
l was watching, Ramdas
He looked a lot more confident

758
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:52,765
And a tap-dance
by George Joseph

759
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,104
What a performance!

760
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,702
Ah, he is the next crown heir
to the Punjakad kingdom, isn't he?

761
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:00,282
- Let himand Latheef?
- Sir

762
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,875
Since we found the bullet
we can confirm our suspicions

763
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,681
Chandrababu
Dr Chandrababu

764
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,739
- Where is Raghuprasad?
- Sir is inside

765
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,811
Ah! Look who has come
Come sit

766
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:31,881
This is a nice setup

767
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,381
You have not visited
since renovations were completed

768
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,781
Full busy now?

769
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,820
You've become
a complete businessman, eh?

770
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:41,821
Dr Chandrababu has
a house in Mercara, right?

771
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,826
Yes, a very old one
He has put it up for sale

772
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:49,388
l know, someone who's interested
l mean a group in the tourism line

773
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,866
- Oh! Who is the party?
- l'll let you know in due time

774
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,129
ls there any way
l can see that house properly?

775
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:58,799
l have the key and to tell you the truth,
the doctor never goes there

776
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:02,776
l went once ortwice with
our lpe team and had a blast

777
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,840
- Fantastic ambience
- Can l see it now?

778
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:12,047
Anytime you want and if its next week
l'll also come with you, too busy this week

779
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:12,985
That will be too late

780
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,114
Just tell me exact location
l'll go myself

781
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,524
Okay, if it works out
what about the commission?

782
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,353
All that will be as usual
No change, don't worry

783
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,172
What do you want, sir?
What help, sir?

784
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,366
- You are a Malayalee, right?
- Yes, how did you know?

785
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,909
l understood as soon
as you spoke English

786
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,137
What a shame! Chey!

787
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,509
ls this bill from your shop?

788
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:53,613
Yes

789
01:00:54,283 --> 01:01:00,085
Last month on the 7th did someone
unfamiliar or stranger come here?

790
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,317
How to remember, sir?
So many people come and go

791
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:04,717
Okay

792
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,658
- lsn't that a close circuit security TV?
- Yes

793
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,097
Do you have backups?

794
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,691
Yes, of course
Up to 45 days of backup

795
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,497
l want a copy
of the full recording of May 7th

796
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,403
Okay, l'll be right back

797
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:30,009
Sir, once in a blue moon
we enjoy a strike, unlike Kerala

798
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,747
lt was a protest day
We opened only in the evening

799
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,479
Not much business

800
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,453
Thank you, l'll come again
if l wanted anything else

801
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,324
Okay, l help you

802
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,227
- That's a bit too much of English
- Okay!

803
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,297
Bala, greetings

804
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:48,997
Some greetings l've sent by air also
You can catch them at your will!

805
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,472
l found the place

806
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,474
lt's much more fantastic than
what l had pictured in my mind

807
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,203
Yes, it can go
immediately to a buyer

808
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:58,736
Price it profitably, okay?
lf it works out, the deal is 50-50

809
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,313
Of course
No doubt

810
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,118
Doctor earns a lot, eh?

811
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,053
Plenty and only
one heir to his riches

812
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,680
His son, Shyam
Quite the loony

813
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:11,316
As chartered accountant
you must be sponging on him

814
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,362
l need my bread
and butter too, Balachandra

815
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,227
Notjust bread, booze too, eh?
Okay, see you

816
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,095
-Aren't you joining me?
- No, l have things to do at home

817
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,067
-Are you going?
- No, just coming!!

818
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,769
Varkey sir, l was
about to call you

819
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:02,334
Pah! l've made 16 calls
Finally that secretary picked the call

820
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,538
only to tell me you were
in your afternoon siesta

821
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,308
That

822
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,383
ls your entire dept also sleeping?

823
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,816
Where is the guy
who crucified my son?

824
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:15,217
2 weeks was the time
the home minister promised

825
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,522
ln case you learn the pain of losing
a son, only when you lose him to death

826
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,119
remember you also have one
Shall l get him beaten to death?

827
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:24,189
Am l not reporting the progress
of the investigation regularly?

828
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,496
Progress?
You mean that bullet?

829
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:34,133
lf you think you can stretch
your drama till the by-election

830
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,179
remember, my 4 sons who
are the pillars of our ministry?

831
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,406
l will just withdraw them

832
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:44,248
Please don't say that
My entire force is behind this case

833
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,847
You and your blessed force
l'll demand CBl investigation

834
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:51,355
Sir, don't hurry me
l will meet the DGP

835
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,485
l will give you 2 weeks time

836
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,463
lf the culprit is not in front of me

837
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,763
my dear Marar,
l'll make you beat drums!

838
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,838
AFTER 2 WEEKS

839
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:12,374
What a shame!
An entire force put to shame

840
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:16,612
Was it the lPS training
or golf game you trained in?

841
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:21,355
No wonder whenever there's a crime
people want to call the CBl

842
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:25,393
They don't believe in
senseless officers like you

843
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,453
Even your silence is suspicious

844
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,126
l strongly believe you have
some vested interest in this case

845
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,796
Has the time come for you
to relinquish your cap, Ramdas?

846
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:42,434
Sir, we've been trained to
investigate a case with honesty

847
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,446
l am doing the same
with this case also

848
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,276
Some facts have been
deliberately hidden

849
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,817
And wrong information
has been spread

850
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:53,878
Fearing media, the politicians and people
we are often forced to act helpless

851
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,389
What is the result?

852
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,325
- All the answers are in this file, sir
- What is in it?

853
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:03,262
Punjakadan murder special
investigation officer SP TRamdas

854
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,459
is submitting
this report to the DGP

855
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:10,437
This will tell you who the murderer is
With all evidences in detail

856
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,316
Whaaat?!

857
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:40,892
Move aside
Ask everyone to move

858
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,268
- What is the motive for this murder?
- lt cannot be said accurately

859
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,500
- Please don't hinder us
- Move, l say!

860
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,734
Move

861
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,443
Get them out of the way

862
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:50,842
Move, l say

863
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:56,943
Move
Move, l say

864
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,617
Don't allow anyone in
Move, l say!

865
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,918
His granny's blessed camera!

866
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,460
Shall we leave?

867
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,900
To arrest a defendant in
a murder that shook the state

868
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,999
the least one can
expect is this celebration

869
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,345
lt's very colourful now
Media should make it a hit

870
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,309
You were like a brother
to me, notjust a friend

871
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:30,750
l've always held you
as a role model

872
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:35,017
You made a fool of me
You betrayed me, sir

873
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:40,421
ln a necessity, we always cheat
the ones who love us the most

874
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:45,557
Who will handcuff me?
Latheef or you, bro?

875
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,629
We are sure you won't escape
Why then the handcuffs?

876
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:59,440
Sir, is itjust personal vendetta?
Or is there any other political reason?

877
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,864
l am Thomas's Punjakadan's father

878
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:25,304
Don't think you can
get away with a life sentence

879
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,466
How could you!

880
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,601
- Sir please!
- Leave me

881
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:32,546
When you raise your kids
it should be done with care

882
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,513
Otherwise there will
be serious repercussions

883
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,347
lt is a father's biggest sin

884
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:40,487
You took away
a part of my life

885
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:43,717
Your sentence will be given
by Punjakadan's court

886
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,658
That court has neithertime nor place
The punishment has been decided

887
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,323
Beat him to death

888
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,737
Bala!

889
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,381
That was a kick aimed at
your 4 evil notorious sons

890
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,977
You won't be able to sustain
another kick from me, George

891
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:16,022
Balachandran's words and kicks
are always a bit too powerful to take!

892
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,455
Let's go

893
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:11,970
2 WEEKS EARLlER

894
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,603
Kiss the branches
stretching to the skies?

895
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,079
Shall we swim to rejoice
in the lake of joys?

896
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:55,981
May the distance to dreams lessen
Tomorrow we will rise to the occasion

897
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:04,059
As countdown begins 3-2-1 backwards
Surge forward and reach upwards

898
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,829
Around the little finger,
isn't the world spinning...?

899
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:11,270
As even events flash by, singing?

900
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,667
As love messages like lightning
jot on this earth brightening

901
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:20,545
With a song let's depart
that awakens the heart

902
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:05,191
On time's face in this new earth
Let's run ahead to win in this birth

903
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:12,599
Let's shoot arrows from our eyes always
On the shore like the sun's hot rays

904
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:19,836
When hopes scattered on shores to fall
let us come together once and for all

905
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:29,850
Let our ways, oblivious to sorrows
be pure, as whispering notes arose

906
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:38,726
lsn't this world beautiful?
We are united here, blissful

907
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,682
Kiss the branches
stretching to the skies?

908
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:13,089
Shall we swim to rejoice
in the lake of joys?

909
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:20,291
May the distance to dreams lessen
Tomorrow we will rise to the occasion

910
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:27,669
As countdown begins 3-2-1 backwards
Surge forward and reach upwards

911
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:31,973
Around the little finger,
isn't the world spinning...?

912
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,777
As even events flash by, singing?

913
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:40,982
As love messages like lightning
jot on this earth brightening

914
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:44,957
With a song let's depart
that awakens the heart

915
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:28,369
Life is life, fun is fun
Don't make life fun orfunny

916
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:31,099
l'm sharing my own
experience of life, okay?

917
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,079
Sir!

918
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,715
l'm Rahul
Shyam

919
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,989
We came to meet our savior

920
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:57,462
lf you hadn't intervened,
we'd have been beaten to pulp, thanks

921
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,261
Who are those fellows?

922
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,200
No idea, we are seeing them
for the 1st time in this pub

923
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,737
Go home without
wasting any more time

924
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,864
- Sir, your name?
- Balachandran

925
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,065
What do you do, sir?

926
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,274
l've signed an agreement to do
any work when l landed on this earth

927
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:13,074
Now, l divide that earth into bits
and sell thema real estate broker

928
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,080
- lsn't that a good job?
- Of course

929
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,381
So if you have anyone who wants
to give or take, do let me know

930
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,216
Give or take land
not blows!

931
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:23,024
Sir, can we have your number?

932
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:27,492
Sure, 959499966
Leave me a message

933
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,764
You must spend a day with us

934
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,765
A treat from our side
Please don't say 'no'

935
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,264
Let's see
Anyways, keep in touch

936
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,496
- Thank you, sir
- Bye

937
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,839
He's a real hero

938
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,936
- Hello
- l am Rahul

939
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,145
- What?
- Rahul

940
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,443
Ah yes, tell me

941
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,414
-Are you free today?
- Totally free

942
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:53,454
We are planning to have a blast today
A get-together of friends, will you join us?

943
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,251
- Where is it?
- At home

944
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:55,914
Home?

945
01:14:56,024 --> 01:15:00,427
Yes!... daddy mummy, not at home
and none to play around with...

946
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:01,427
We can meet here

947
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,191
- Time?
-Anytime

948
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,442
Hello?

949
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,878
Sis, can you hear me?

950
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,881
One minute
Hold on, 1 minute

951
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,483
Rahul?

952
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:01,011
Dadada?

953
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,451
- What?
- Your mummy

954
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,219
Don't spoil my mood, go away
Mummy!

955
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,089
Your mom wants
to tell you something

956
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,287
Just say something
and avoid her

957
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,228
Children must be like this!

958
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:19,107
Rahul is at home studying

959
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:26,837
l am out at the electricity office
lt's the last day to pay the amount due

960
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,479
Oh that! There is a function
going on nearby

961
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,553
lt's a recorded music

962
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:35,384
l swear!
l swear, over my dead father!

963
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,594
Of course not
He's always studying

964
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,194
He's so good at it!

965
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,096
He is not particular

966
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:52,196
He just wants something
to drink every now and then

967
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,306
Not looking after him?
Who me?

968
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:03,950
What other work do l have here?
l feel really envious looking at him

969
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:13,083
Please send some more Euro
Rahul loves them very much

970
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:17,964
Are you aware petrol costs
Rs 20 more this month?!

971
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,364
Okay

972
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:23,469
As long as Rahu (snake's head) exists
this Ketu (snake's tail) is ecstatic

973
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,232
Rahul?

974
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,144
- What is it, uncle?!
- Your mummy called and asked-

975
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,940
Don't get drunk today
and mess things up, okay?

976
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,538
We have a guest today
A royal guest

977
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:38,712
Okay, so who's saying no to that
Anyway this is a guest house

978
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:41,422
- But better stop all this by today
- lf l don't?

979
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,081
- lf you don't
- You can do it tomorrow

980
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,658
- What?
- Okaydon't stop

981
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,126
Rahul, your uncle is getting sloshed

982
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:50,198
- Now a punch is enough!
- Stop it, you crackpot!

983
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,342
Hi Bala'etta!
Welcome home

984
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,380
- Have everyone come?
- Yes, we started a while back

985
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,541
- Started even before l could come, eh?
- Just a little bit

986
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:09,412
Hello?

987
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,045
He is my uncle, a couple of drinks
and he forgets his own name!

988
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,213
What does uncle do for a living?

989
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:17,553
My job is being his uncle
What betterjob can l get?

990
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,490
- l have a doubt
- What?

991
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:23,223
Are you wearing your pant
above or below your butt?

992
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,424
Above my butt, of course

993
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,627
With hair spiked up like a porcupine
with a beard so sparseam l correct?

994
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,668
Nonono

995
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,761
l was wrong, mistaken identity!

996
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,202
You do look as if
you belong to aristocracy

997
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,139
ls that a disadvantage?

998
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:40,579
Never! lt's the 1st time l'm seeing
a normal human being here as his friend

999
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:44,482
Shall l go for a re-fill?
Take him in, my dear boy

1000
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,995
Our friends, Jalsa, Shreya

1001
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,323
Shall we start?
To start with?

1002
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:02,028
- Your choice
- No, your choice, Bala'etta

1003
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,607
What is this?
A bar, eh?

1004
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,041
His dad's collection

1005
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:13,239
But he prefers thisgrass,
to liquid intoxicants

1006
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:16,215
- l like wild trips
- Me too

1007
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,212
Let's choose this one
Dad brought it from Paris

1008
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:25,315
Absintee
Wrong, Absinthe!

1009
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,585
Bala'etta, sit down

1010
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:32,497
French, alcohol from wormwood
So many myths around this alcohol

1011
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:36,031
Van Gogh cut his ear
after he drank this

1012
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:39,402
Titanic sank after
its captain too had drunk this

1013
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:43,534
ln some places
it's called the 'green fairy'

1014
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:45,642
Very well informed, aren't you?!

1015
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,044
How old are you?

1016
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,811
Not old enough
to own a license

1017
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:54,652
He is an 'all in all' encyclopedia
There's nothing he doesn't know

1018
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:55,587
ls it?

1019
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,217
And in case there's anything
he does not know, l teach him

1020
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,520
Haven't you filled this yet?

1021
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:05,863
l went, but lost my way
lnstead, l remembered my name

1022
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,123
What is your name?

1023
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,169
Radhakrishnan
Don't you know?

1024
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,136
- No
- That's my name!

1025
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,400
Shall l now go fill this up?
Da, take care of him

1026
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:16,272
He's our guest
So take good care

1027
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,408
Absinthe!

1028
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,316
He is Peter, our friend

1029
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:23,509
A gardener by profession

1030
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,746
But he knows everything
other than gardening!

1031
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:27,783
He's a great cook

1032
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,620
He looks familiar

1033
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,885
- Where do you live?
- Bangladesh colony

1034
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,788
The food looks awesome
Can l borrow him for a few days?

1035
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,558
Nonono
Peter, bring rest of the food

1036
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,726
These are some photos
of my performances

1037
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:48,300
- Who's the 4th one?
- He's Chandu! Aterrific guy

1038
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:49,568
And where is he now?
Will he come?

1039
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,407
No, he's settled in Bangalore

1040
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,743
Except for Peter
All others are FB friends

1041
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,112
Oh, that's good

1042
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,380
Are you on FB, Bala'etta?

1043
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,823
That's for kids
Where do l have time for all that?!

1044
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,327
You are absolutely wrong!

1045
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,823
lt's another world
A world with no limitations

1046
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,160
What happened, Bala'etta?

1047
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:20,365
- ls it Absinthe making trouble?
- Probably because l had it dry

1048
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:25,839
- Let's listen to some music
- Sure, oh sure!

1049
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,321
Press and media are screaming
like mad about the incompetence

1050
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,457
in the investigation
of the Punjakadan case

1051
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,592
lndifferencebesides
pressure from the government

1052
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,831
The DG's language has
begun to turn unpleasant

1053
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,805
Anyway, we will soon
answer everyone

1054
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:33,340
Tomorrow will be the 1st arrest
in connection with this case

1055
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:37,383
Operation must be a secret
The media must never get a clue

1056
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,683
Everybody be ready at
7:30 AM sharp, tomorrow

1057
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:58,930
Where is Ali Koya?

1058
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,339
Father is inside
What is it?

1059
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,939
- Call him out, please?
- He's sick with fever

1060
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,310
We'll give him medicine
Call him

1061
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,975
- Grandpa?
- Dad?

1062
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,718
Grand pa, the police are here

1063
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,809
Oh Lord!

1064
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:18,483
Stop worrying, they'll keep
coming until they solve the case

1065
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,790
And we must go
whenever they call

1066
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:23,330
Even if we are lying dead

1067
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:26,832
Hey, what's taking you so long?
Come out l say, come here!

1068
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:33,364
- Don't take him away, sir
- l'm very ill, high fever, sir

1069
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:37,036
Me too, for many days a high fever
But for now, get into the jeep

1070
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:40,577
He's too sick
He'll come after he recovers

1071
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,913
Shut up, you start fussing,
l'll grind you to a pulp

1072
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,383
Get in!

1073
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:46,682
What is the matter sir,?

1074
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:50,588
Get lost, you son of a gun!
Mattermy foot!

1075
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,860
- Grand pa
- Don't take him away

1076
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:56,361
Grandpa will come back
Get in, dude!

1077
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,522
Grandpa

1078
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:58,855
Let's go!

1079
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,527
Who's there for us now?

1080
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,446
Bring him out

1081
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,686
Get out
l said, get out

1082
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,053
Sir!

1083
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,969
Scientific investigation,
aren't you aware?

1084
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,843
Age old methods and
twirling moustaches are over

1085
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:52,782
That too an old man
who is past 60, how sad!

1086
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:56,482
Believe us, Bala, it was
really a cardiac arrest

1087
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,855
May be he's not faced
a situation like this before

1088
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,590
Our own police force, right?!
Don't l know how they'd behave?

1089
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:03,686
Such smart guys!

1090
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:07,633
They'll easily turn suicide into
murder or a murder into suicide

1091
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:09,834
lt is the truth

1092
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,134
The post-mortem report
says so very clearly

1093
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:13,999
- lsn't it Dr Chandrababu's report?
- Yes

1094
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:16,942
- Sure, l believe you!
- You have to

1095
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,410
Just a week back
l've questioned him

1096
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,711
l think he is genuine
He has a clean history

1097
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,446
He has no part
in these Punjakadan games

1098
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,987
Then why did you
rush into this arrest?

1099
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,615
Mistake!
Total mistake!

1100
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:33,488
On May 6th, though Punjakadan went
to the airport, he didn't board any flight

1101
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,587
Neither has he travelled back
in any vehicle

1102
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,859
Then where did he disappear?
Disappeared like smoke, is it?

1103
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,959
To find out more, who else
than Ali koya can l touch?

1104
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,937
Sure, it's turned out to be
the touch of 'God of Death'

1105
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,941
A life lost forever, isn't it?
Whomsoever it was

1106
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:55,077
l have just 2 weeks more
to place the file on the DGP's desk!

1107
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:58,584
- lt's an order
- You'll solve it

1108
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,048
Just go on with your old prowess
and tighten your investigations

1109
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,590
l am also with you

1110
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:20,430
Hello sir, it's me, Rahul
l've been trying to call 2-3 times

1111
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:23,671
Was a bit busy
But why at this hour, Rahul?

1112
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:29,445
Nothing, was wide awake
Thought l'd call you, did l disturb you?

1113
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:30,916
Of course not! Never

1114
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,849
Actually l was about to call you

1115
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:36,147
Shall we go on a short trip,
have a blast and come back?

1116
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:40,853
l am all for it, ready! Shyam
may hesitate, but l'll convince him

1117
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,157
Let's call Chandu also,
what do you say?

1118
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:44,663
Sure! Our Peter must
also come, the cook

1119
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,666
- Done!
- Goodnight

1120
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:10,787
An army of friends are we
as we sing our song of war happily

1121
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:15,123
Ocean of injustice, turbulent
Wind runs with the waves, blatant

1122
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,667
Song flowed in rhythm
As a tune knitted to hum

1123
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:24,065
Together and boisterously
Speeding enroute joyously

1124
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:28,666
Will you join us to gaze
the eastern sky's rays?

1125
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:33,577
To compose a nonstop symphony
Will you sing melodies with us in harmony?

1126
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:38,215
An army of friends are we
as we sing our song of war happily

1127
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:42,653
Ocean of injustice, turbulent
Wind runs with the waves, blatant

1128
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:47,057
Song flowed in rhythm
As a tune knitted to hum

1129
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:51,562
Together and boisterously
Speeding enroute joyously

1130
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:56,035
Will you join us to gaze
the eastern sky's rays?

1131
01:27:56,170 --> 01:28:01,540
To compose a nonstop symphony
Will you sing melodies with us in harmony?

1132
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:14,678
Like a path, dead end or different
Face to face, diverging or distant

1133
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:19,225
With a false smile and a mask to hold
got ready for the play to unfold

1134
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:27,132
Star clusters and clouds hastened
for untold stories to be listened

1135
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:33,233
A lone wave along the sea
Caressed the shore tenderly

1136
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:39,605
Will you join us to gaze
the eastern sky's rays?

1137
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:45,016
To compose a nonstop symphony
Will you sing melodies with us in harmony?

1138
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:11,641
Flare up and spread the glow
to shine and sparkle like a halo

1139
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:16,410
Festivities forever, lamps lit always
Now, to swell and rise like surge of waves

1140
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:24,614
Like a laid out trap of intrigue
thoughts fulfilled in a clear league

1141
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,890
Flowers in the valley as sentry
a secret for your ears only

1142
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:34,400
Will you join us to gaze
the eastern sky's rays?

1143
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:39,401
To compose a nonstop symphony
Will you sing melodies with us in harmony?

1144
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:44,041
An army of friends are we
as we sing our song of war happily

1145
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:48,442
Ocean of injustice, turbulent
Wind runs with the waves, blatant

1146
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:52,982
Song flowed in rhythm
As a tune knitted to hum

1147
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:57,214
Together and boisterously
Speeding enroute joyously

1148
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:01,920
Will you join us to gaze
the eastern sky's rays?

1149
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:07,262
To compose a nonstop symphony
Will you sing melodies with us in harmony?

1150
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,012
Peter, wake up everyone

1151
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:24,182
Rahul, Shyam, get up

1152
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,984
- Where are we?
- Why are we here?

1153
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,030
This was not part
of our plan, right?

1154
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,464
Forget the plan
Tell me, how is this place?

1155
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:41,224
200 year old
British bungalow

1156
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,837
Belonged to the Brits
whom we drove out

1157
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,869
You kept this a secret surprise
With all the songs and dance, eh?

1158
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,771
Thank you,
for this surprise, Bala'etta

1159
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,935
There is a surprise
in every suspense

1160
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:53,445
That's the thrill,
which will become a thriller

1161
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:55,879
Come on
Get the luggage

1162
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:58,281
This will be our haven
forthe next 2 days

1163
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:06,724
- Tell us about this place?
- lt is all ours, da

1164
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:10,195
- Does it mean yours, Bala'etta?
- You can take it, if you want

1165
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,229
Really, Bala'etta,
it is beautiful place

1166
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,960
l first saw it
when l came with a friend

1167
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:17,900
Have you heard
of love at first sight?

1168
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,336
l fell in love with the house

1169
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:22,274
lt carried a fancy price
l didn't hesitate, just bought it

1170
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:26,045
Your aesthetic sense is awesome
We concede unanimously

1171
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,774
All rooms are bath attached

1172
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:30,009
Now go and
freshen up, gogo!

1173
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,209
Come, let's go

1174
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,352
Peter, don't you
pray before eating?

1175
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,057
No sir, nothing like that

1176
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,793
Peter doesn't go to
the Church even for Christmas

1177
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,431
Foreigners dine like it is a ritual
Haven't you seen it in movies?

1178
01:31:51,973 --> 01:31:54,134
The dining table will be
a feast for the eyes

1179
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:56,973
Shyam, don't you
know this place?

1180
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:58,807
l think you should

1181
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,949
Encyclopedia is equal
to your brains, right?

1182
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:03,444
No, l don't

1183
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:06,816
These are places that interest
real estate dealers like you, Bala'etta

1184
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:10,516
- But still, try to remember
- l really don't

1185
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,421
Then, leave it

1186
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:17,159
My worry is, in case it is haunted
you shouldn't have bought it

1187
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:21,563
l know there will be 1 ghost for sure
That's why l bought it

1188
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:23,030
Which ghost is that?

1189
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:26,566
You know him

1190
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,206
Thomas Punjakadan

1191
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:37,311
How will that ghost be here?
lt will be only on the beach

1192
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,252
Ghosts reside in the place
where its life was taken out

1193
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,118
Won't the murderers know that?

1194
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:48,621
Your blessed drama ends now

1195
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:57,862
What did you think we were?
Babies nursing on breast milk?

1196
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:01,938
We planned and committed an act
like real boys and executed it perfectly

1197
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:06,036
lt did not take us long to know
a cunning policeman like you

1198
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,911
Within seconds
we decoded your intentions

1199
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:12,441
We also wanted everything
to end with this trip, like you did

1200
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,647
You were right
lt's absolutely safe here

1201
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,652
You and Punjakadan
as spirits can play chess here

1202
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:18,984
Your intelligence will improve

1203
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,254
We have heard enmity
doesn't exist between ghosts

1204
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,398
We have no other option
You are too dangerous

1205
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:41,173
Rahul, Shyam, Peter and Chandu

1206
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:45,510
You kidnapped and brought
Thomas Punjakadan, the don here

1207
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:50,248
You tortured him inch by inch
You killed and crucified him

1208
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:54,021
- Born criminals
- No! Not criminals

1209
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:57,963
Only compassionate human beings
Don't call us criminals

1210
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:02,001
Shut up! You son of a gun!
Not criminals?!

1211
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:04,970
Must l call you angels
who've come in peace?

1212
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:09,270
A well planned act that would put
professional killers to shameso brutal!

1213
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:12,273
A bunch of kids of the devil
not hesitating to kill or die

1214
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,143
But actually my target was not you

1215
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,716
lt was Punjakadan's
right hand, George Joseph

1216
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,508
When l went in search of Punjakadan

1217
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:23,181
this bungalow gifted to your dad
by him, came into my purview

1218
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:27,551
l suspected there'd be a story
behind this and went looking for it

1219
01:34:55,556 --> 01:35:00,016
And just 1 heir to his riches
His only son Shyam, quite a loony

1220
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:39,266
The issue at hotel Broadway,
was a planned incident

1221
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:54,545
You are absolutely wrong

1222
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:57,378
You don't know anything
You won't understand either

1223
01:35:57,451 --> 01:35:59,476
Thomas Punjakadan
was not killed by us

1224
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,485
But by millions

1225
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,419
Open Face book
Then you'll know

1226
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:05,321
And given a chance, we'll kill
many more such anti socials

1227
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:09,658
None of you know Thomas
or his dad as well as l do

1228
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:12,664
The roots of evil have neither
begun nor ended with them

1229
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,031
When this Punjakadan dies
it will be another Punjakadan

1230
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:16,501
or a Punnakadansome Kadan

1231
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,662
The public and the law
must nail and shatter them

1232
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:22,336
lndividual revenge is
not a solution for anything

1233
01:36:22,643 --> 01:36:25,111
When youngsters like you
take up weapons

1234
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:28,113
do you know
who is most affected?

1235
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:30,080
lt is not the system
or the society but

1236
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:34,253
your parents who nurtured you
with big dreams and expectations

1237
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:38,382
Stop it! Which lucky guys
are you talking about?

1238
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,823
A draft and a prompt phone call
from Germany every month

1239
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:48,660
are my parents along with a dog
for company in a big house

1240
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:54,105
My mom loves her pet
Doberman more than me

1241
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,836
My doctor dad is a bigger
policeman than you

1242
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:58,872
A cruel investigator

1243
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,581
A person who sees only faults
and knows only to punish

1244
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:04,150
a dirty devil!

1245
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:10,521
Hey! Hey! l don't want any questions
l need answers from you

1246
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:12,488
Nonono

1247
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,717
l asked a simple question

1248
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:19,163
And l need a simple darned
answer from you, okay?

1249
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,497
Yeah! That's right

1250
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:25,832
Stop it, l say!

1251
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:48,752
Maaa!

1252
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,795
What the hell
do you think you are doing?

1253
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,932
ls that cleanliness?
You call that hygiene?

1254
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:05,244
Huh?
You

1255
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:07,744
- Mom!
- l care 2 hoots for you both

1256
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:25,259
l hate him!
l HATE HlM

1257
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:31,165
He has only 1 mission in life
To earn millions, he'll sell his soul

1258
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,903
l have only hatred towards him
and to everything else in life

1259
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:39,446
Does thatjustify killing and
crucifying a person to avenge yourself?

1260
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:42,541
They didn't kill Punjakadan

1261
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,841
- l did
- Why?

1262
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,546
WHY?!

1263
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,823
Brother!

1264
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:55,494
My little sister lsa

1265
01:38:55,663 --> 01:39:02,000
l lived for her, l was her mother,
father, brother and sister, everything!

1266
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:15,374
lt was my fault
Mine alone

1267
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:19,742
l gave in to her wish
and allowed her to go alone

1268
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,867
What is it?
What is it, Ali'kka?

1269
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:51,707
- lsa has not returned from school
- My lsawhere is she?

1270
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:56,512
- Don't worry
- My Godmy lsa!

1271
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:19,930
Peter!

1272
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:26,913
She's gone, my son
She's left us

1273
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:33,849
Leave me

1274
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:39,119
Peter!
Listen to us

1275
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,427
lsa!!

1276
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,941
Peter!

1277
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,521
Brother!?

1278
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:01,572
- Brother?
- Come near me

1279
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,908
- Brother
- What is it, my dear?

1280
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,140
lsa did not die in an accident
She was killed

1281
01:43:15,956 --> 01:43:19,619
l heard grandpa tell my mom

1282
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:26,725
He also said that if we tell anyone,
they'd kill all of us

1283
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:41,547
Why are you standing in the rain?
Come under my umbrella

1284
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:43,943
Ali'kka, who was it?

1285
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:52,525
- You come here, first
- No, just tell me who did it?

1286
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,787
Thomas Punjakadan

1287
01:43:56,897 --> 01:44:02,301
To wrap the case and manipulate
the report, the police doctor Chandrababu

1288
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:06,937
was given an estate and bungalow
in Mercara and cash to all others

1289
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,634
lt was George Joseph
who gave all this

1290
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:13,609
That particular day, l was
the one who drove their vehicle

1291
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:17,116
ln spite of knowing this
you never?

1292
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:23,622
What can we do to them?
l know them since 35 years

1293
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,956
l was burning with guilt
unable to tell you this, Peter

1294
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:33,231
Every time l saw yourface,
my insides twisted in pain

1295
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:35,858
Forgive me, my son!

1296
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:42,307
Peter!

1297
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:49,777
We noted Punjakadan's every move

1298
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:53,910
We had discussed
how he would die, months back

1299
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:56,546
Everyone voted for
his death to be on the cross

1300
01:44:56,690 --> 01:45:01,650
From the day Ali'kka told Peter about
his Kuwait trip, we waited patiently

1301
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:05,998
We decided, this bungalow
which Punjakadan had given

1302
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:10,059
in return for lsa's life will bear
witness to his last struggle to live

1303
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:12,796
Okay, go
Everything as planned

1304
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:18,908
Ali'kka, we are late
Please go as fast as you can

1305
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:23,005
l'll reach you well on time, my boy
l guarantee it

1306
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,225
Ali'kka

1307
01:45:57,384 --> 01:45:58,749
Oh Lord!

1308
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:01,853
Quick! Ali'kka

1309
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:09,319
Chey! Not reachable!

1310
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:26,939
- Take him out, da
- Quickly

1311
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,674
The bag
Quick!

1312
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,378
Ali'kka, go to the airport,
collect the entry pass

1313
01:46:33,487 --> 01:46:34,419
and then only return

1314
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:36,883
Keep your phone switched off and
switch it on only after you're back home

1315
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:40,426
- Don't call us
- Get in

1316
01:46:42,362 --> 01:46:43,795
Oh Lord!

1317
01:47:50,897 --> 01:47:53,923
Who are you?
Why did you bring me here?

1318
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:04,437
You!
You don't know who l am

1319
01:48:04,544 --> 01:48:08,002
The guy who has made violence
sex and drugs, his way of life!

1320
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,207
Thomas Punjakadan

1321
01:48:11,518 --> 01:48:15,284
- What do you want?
- You can't give it back

1322
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:17,514
Nono

1323
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:28,991
l don't know anything

1324
01:48:29,102 --> 01:48:32,333
Only you know
Tell us, you mongrel!

1325
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,506
Go ahead, shout for help
Shout, you son of a!

1326
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:43,481
You dog! Do you remember
a kid who cried for help like this

1327
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:45,518
You dare shed tears!!

1328
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,537
Hey! lt's ringing

1329
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:15,547
Actually an NRl line
Just a second

1330
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:21,250
- Hey George! Thomas here
- Have you reached already?

1331
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:22,982
Sure l did
On time

1332
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:26,581
- Was yourjourney comfortable?
- Of course! Very comfortable!

1333
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:29,088
Are you staying at Sheraton?

1334
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:32,097
Return only after
finishing your work, okay?

1335
01:49:32,165 --> 01:49:35,623
- Of course, okay
- Okay

1336
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:27,051
Kill me
Please

1337
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:30,122
You don't deserve
such sympathy, Punjakkadan

1338
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:32,181
We won't kill you, da!

1339
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:36,691
l want to know what
you did to my little one, you!

1340
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:40,631
Don't hit me

1341
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:53,903
l'll tell you,
l'll tell everything

1342
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:22,197
Brother?

1343
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:27,276
Brother

1344
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:06,777
l was mad

1345
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:12,450
After l was done
l realized she was dead

1346
01:52:17,797 --> 01:52:18,695
Stop!

1347
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:21,130
Now it's my turn

1348
01:52:45,058 --> 01:52:47,390
Now tell us
Are we criminals?

1349
01:52:49,863 --> 01:52:53,196
The law does not see
if the victim was good or bad

1350
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:57,168
lt is a crime to kill
anyone for any reason

1351
01:52:57,237 --> 01:52:59,102
Forthat you are
liable for punishment

1352
01:52:59,172 --> 01:53:01,470
He raped and killed
a young girl

1353
01:53:01,574 --> 01:53:04,475
Aren't you ashamed
to talk on his behalf?

1354
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:08,745
Let him take any side
How does it matterto us?

1355
01:53:08,815 --> 01:53:11,340
Everything must end here

1356
01:53:18,491 --> 01:53:21,619
- Finish him off
- We don't want to kill a person like you

1357
01:53:21,694 --> 01:53:22,592
Very sorry

1358
01:53:22,662 --> 01:53:27,190
You are the only one
who reached out to us

1359
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:35,306
You don't have to
trouble yourself anymore

1360
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,443
Here l am
at your gun point

1361
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:40,209
When a son shoots
with a toy gun

1362
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:43,407
haven't you seen his dad
play-acting and falling with a smile?

1363
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:46,384
That's the state of my mind now
Come, shoot me

1364
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:49,284
l have seen this scene
many times and liked it also

1365
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:51,357
But no more scope
for this play here

1366
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:58,226
Play!? l will never wait for death
at any one's gun point except yours

1367
01:53:58,298 --> 01:53:59,822
What nonsense
you are talking?

1368
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:01,867
He's trying some game

1369
01:54:02,535 --> 01:54:05,368
Yes
A final game

1370
01:54:05,772 --> 01:54:08,866
A game a father
plays to end his guilt

1371
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:12,139
because he couldn't
do his duty to his son

1372
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:17,280
Chandu alias Naveen Balachandran

1373
01:54:17,884 --> 01:54:24,915
Your surname Balachandran
is none other than mine, your dad

1374
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:29,320
My mom has told me
about that despicable man

1375
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:31,556
To me, he is a faceless person

1376
01:54:31,631 --> 01:54:37,160
You are right, son
l will never claim it

1377
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:39,337
l don't have the right

1378
01:54:42,742 --> 01:54:45,677
One night, long ago
l got my suspension order

1379
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:50,739
l came home stone drunk,
you were still a baby

1380
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:17,877
Hey, where were you?

1381
01:55:32,692 --> 01:55:35,456
With whom did you
go spend the night?

1382
01:55:35,528 --> 01:55:39,259
Chi! That's what
l should have actually done

1383
01:55:39,365 --> 01:55:42,493
With a sick child,
l have knocked many doors

1384
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:45,332
in this colony forjust Rs 100

1385
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:51,933
Why didn't you tell me?

1386
01:55:52,045 --> 01:55:54,309
At this time of the night
carrying our son

1387
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,439
which liquor shop
should l have come to?

1388
01:55:56,549 --> 01:55:58,744
lnstead of asking
what my problem was

1389
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:01,718
you ask me with whom
l have spent the night?!

1390
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,415
Hereafter l will do
what you always claim

1391
01:56:03,523 --> 01:56:05,514
You are forcing me to do it

1392
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:07,525
l will invite and bring
other men into this house

1393
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:09,458
while claiming
to be your wife!

1394
01:56:09,562 --> 01:56:11,655
You!
Will you?!

1395
01:56:16,269 --> 01:56:19,830
Open the door
Open it!

1396
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:32,415
You don't know who
you are playing with!

1397
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:11,814
This is not the life l dreamed

1398
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:17,691
Cooking and sleeping with you is
what you thought was a wife's duty

1399
01:57:17,897 --> 01:57:19,831
You did not see my heart

1400
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:25,469
Alcohol, friends...you wanted
only your own pleasures in life

1401
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:30,339
l can't live with you any more
l am ending it here, right now

1402
01:57:30,943 --> 01:57:36,472
Don't try to come into my life again
nor meet me ever

1403
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:41,580
l will continue to live for my son
- Jayashree

1404
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:51,686
Years later, there was a moment
when l discovered you were my son

1405
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,059
Who is this 4th boy?

1406
01:57:54,367 --> 01:57:56,528
He is Chandu
a terrific guy

1407
01:57:56,602 --> 01:57:57,899
Where is he?
Will he come?

1408
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:00,097
No, settled in Bangalore

1409
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:19,653
You and Jayashree!

1410
01:58:19,959 --> 01:58:22,052
l should've been overjoyed

1411
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:25,426
But my head swam
and l became blind

1412
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:28,657
You had always slipped
further and further away

1413
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:32,500
But when l saw you with this group,
it was most unexpected

1414
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:37,606
l have waited so long
to meet my dad

1415
01:58:37,977 --> 01:58:40,138
You never came to see me

1416
01:58:43,483 --> 01:58:48,887
l did, when l finally became sane
enough to understandl did come

1417
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:51,921
But l was never
able to find you

1418
01:58:52,024 --> 01:58:54,959
in those places l was told
you and Jayashree were

1419
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:57,791
Last resort, l visited
your school one day

1420
01:58:57,997 --> 01:59:01,455
But l was told that without
permission from guardian

1421
01:59:01,567 --> 01:59:04,035
a father can't meet his son

1422
01:59:07,807 --> 01:59:09,570
lt's alright
Forget it

1423
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:14,474
A man who couldn't differentiate life
from a game of cards deserves this

1424
01:59:15,515 --> 01:59:17,949
Parents must not ask a share
of their child's growing years

1425
01:59:18,084 --> 01:59:20,644
when they haven't been a part of it

1426
01:59:20,953 --> 01:59:27,791
l have no sorrow now,
l have got you back

1427
01:59:28,528 --> 01:59:30,928
At least l am
a bit fortunate

1428
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:40,097
The world deserves people like you

1429
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:43,037
Talented and with
will power, et al

1430
01:59:44,477 --> 01:59:46,172
Thomas Punjakadan
was killed by someone

1431
01:59:46,245 --> 01:59:50,443
Revenge, hatred or politics
What is it to us?

1432
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:53,775
No one will know anything

1433
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,750
We just return
like we had gone for a tour

1434
01:59:59,825 --> 02:00:01,554
Rejuvenated and happy
That's all

1435
02:00:01,627 --> 02:00:03,561
That's allit will ever be

1436
02:00:12,772 --> 02:00:13,739
What is it?

1437
02:00:14,307 --> 02:00:17,708
- l want to talk to you
- Nowat midnight?

1438
02:00:18,244 --> 02:00:20,178
l know it is midnight

1439
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:26,852
And that it's very late
but l am serious

1440
02:00:26,953 --> 02:00:29,217
What is it, Bala?
Come to the point

1441
02:00:31,123 --> 02:00:34,923
Even if it is late, it's something
you should know, bro

1442
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:40,055
l have found out
who killed Thomas Punjakadan

1443
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,128
You know him very well

1444
02:00:48,007 --> 02:00:52,910
Balachandran, Cl of police
who is now under suspension

1445
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:54,876
Bala!

1446
02:00:55,114 --> 02:00:58,914
A policeman like a criminal
designed that murder perfectly

1447
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:02,578
At first l thought let itjust
die out without clear evidence

1448
02:01:02,722 --> 02:01:06,556
- That's why l tried to mislead you
- Then why confess now?

1449
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:10,558
l am not stricken with regret,
he deserves that end

1450
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:14,691
l don't want to
hide it any longer

1451
02:01:14,834 --> 02:01:18,702
because time will
one day nail me guilty

1452
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:22,904
My life, right at the interval
has reached its climax

1453
02:01:23,075 --> 02:01:25,873
l have decided
not to prolong it

1454
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:33,574
l will give you all the evidence
of Thomas Punjakadan's deeds

1455
02:01:33,753 --> 02:01:37,689
Since it is midnight
let me wish you a half good night

1456
02:01:57,677 --> 02:01:59,235
There's a visitor for you

1457
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:15,384
lt's been 14 years
since we last met, isn't it?

1458
02:02:18,397 --> 02:02:23,300
l underwent a lot of struggles
to bring up our son

1459
02:02:24,437 --> 02:02:25,768
l know very well

1460
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:30,002
Even without my protection
he grew up into a smart boy

1461
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:36,170
When l saw him, only then
l realized what a strong woman you are

1462
02:02:36,449 --> 02:02:41,318
Did l go wrong somewhere
in bringing him up, Bala'etta?

1463
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:44,814
No, it was l
who was wrong

1464
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:49,625
l failed to realize 2 lives
were dependent on me

1465
02:02:50,096 --> 02:02:56,228
My life was slipping away and
my arrogance failed to see it

1466
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:07,269
Bala'etta, what a peculiar way
for our son to reunite with his dad

1467
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,814
Time is over

1468
02:03:12,485 --> 02:03:14,043
Shall l go, Bala'etta?

1469
02:03:22,194 --> 02:03:27,325
Jayashree, when everything is over
and if l ever have a life remaining

1470
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:31,326
l want to spend it
only with you and our son!

1471
02:03:43,983 --> 02:03:46,178
Subtitled by latha and rekhs
