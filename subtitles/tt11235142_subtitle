1
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,750
God.. I'm unable to 
live with this sadness.

2
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,700
There's nothing left for 
me to stay alive for!

3
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,200
Life is full of 
problems and pain.

4
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,160
I want peace.

5
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,500
Everlasting peace.

6
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,160
I think I can attain it..

7
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,330
...only if I stop living.

8
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,540
All my life you've 
worked against me.

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,580
For once, pick my side.

10
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,080
Without letting me feel the fear 
of death, take my life at once.

11
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,410
While I was studying, 
for no reason at all,..

12
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,870
...I felt like looking up.

13
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,750
And it felt like someone came 
and whispered asking me to look up!

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,500
I kept wondering why I felt 
that way and decided to look up

15
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,200
He looked like the most 
beautiful thing in the universe!

16
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,250
My heart began to 
pound like a drum!

17
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,660
I casually dived into the 
pool of love, it was only later..

18
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,290
...I realised that I can't swim!

19
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,200
By the time I could let go of my 
shyness and push myself to..

20
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,040
...ask someone about him, 
a lot of days had passed.

21
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,000
What I finally found out was..

22
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,200
His name was Rohit.

23
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,870
A first year student of M.Tech.

24
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,450
So, he's two years senior to me.

25
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,120
His parents are no more. His sister 
and brother-in-law live in Singapore.

26
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,500
He's a class topper.

27
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,200
Everyone had the same 
thing to say about him.

28
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,370
That he is a good 
guy and is innocent.

29
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,290
And he was good at Dot Drawing.

30
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,200
It is a technique of drawing using 
only dots and no lines.

31
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,250
Despite his hesitance, his 
friends would force him and..

32
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,290
...put his drawings up 
on the notice board.

33
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,750
Wow! That's a good looking 
piece of art, right?

34
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,830
And the artist is no less good looking! 
- I have no idea about that.

35
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,540
Haven't you seen him? 
- I can't wait to see him now!

36
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,330
Do that. 
- Is he that good looking?

37
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,660
He's pretty handsome. He already 
has a big female fan following.

38
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,330
And now with this drawing, more 
girls are sure to join the club.

39
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,330
If that's the case, then 
I'm the new one on the list.

40
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,410
Heard you put Aishwarya Rai on the 
notice board without telling me?

41
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,370
I refused to do so, but 
Praveen was adamant.

42
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,910
The drawing's pretty average. 
See for yourself.

43
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,790
Where did Aishwarya Rai go?

44
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,580
She was right here! 
- Then where did she go?

45
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,120
Rohit, I'm sorry!

46
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,750
I think along with love, 
jealousy comes for free.

47
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,120
Enough of staring and stealing, 
go talk to him tomorrow!

48
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,080
Is that necessary?

49
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,870
Come on! Practice how 
you're going to talk to him!

50
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,040
Excuse me? Umm..

51
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,830
You're Rohit, right? 
First year, M.Tech?

52
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,000
Hi.

53
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,580
My name's Dia..

54
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,370
Dia Swaroop.

55
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,540
The name's Bond.. 
James Bond!

56
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,290
Just tell him that 
it's Dia Swaroop!

57
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,580
Excuse me?

58
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,910
You're Rohit, right? 
First year, M.Tech?

59
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,950
Hi! My name is Dia Swaroop. 
Third year, Bio-tech student.

60
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,950
You draw really well!

61
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,120
*MUFFLED REHEARSAL* 
Conductor: Tickets? Anyone?

62
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,950
Ticket?

63
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,700
Hi! You're Rohit, right? 
First year, M.Tech?

64
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,120
You draw really well! 
- Heh?!

65
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,330
*CONTINUES REHEARSING*

66
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,790
He's all alone. 
This is it.

67
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,580
Go! Talk to him!

68
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,750
Be confident!

69
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,200
Make sure your legs don’t tremble. 
Wipe the sweat off your face.

70
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,410
Go! Come one! 
Greet him!

71
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,410
It's okay! There's still a lot of 
time left before he finishes college!

72
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,080
Better luck next time.

73
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,750
Oh God!

74
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Hey Rohit!

75
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,540
I wonder if I'm making 
a mistake by approaching..

76
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,580
...him without any 
topic to talk about.

77
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,330
Yep! That’s true.

78
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,790
If I come up with a strong reason, I can 
easily approach and talk to him.

79
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,080
But what could it be?

80
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,790
If only I could ask him to 
clarify some academic doubts.

81
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,830
But we aren't even 
in the same course!

82
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,750
What excuse do I have?

83
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,580
Excuse?!

84
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,000
Umm.. Excuse me?

85
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,040
You're Rohit, right? 
First year, M.Tech?

86
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,830
Yes! I am.

87
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,330
I think this..

88
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,830
...belongs to you.

89
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,040
This is mine! 
Where did you find it?

90
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,200
Erm.. I found it near 
the basketball court.

91
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,330
I was putting it up for everyone to 
see, and someone was taking it away!

92
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,870
Thank you!

93
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,500
By the way, what's your name?

94
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,330
What happened?

95
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,620
It's nothing! 
My name is..

96
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,580
Excuse me?

97
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes?

98
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,160
You're a first year 
M.Tech student, right?

99
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,660
Yes. 
- My name's Dia Swaroop..

100
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,410
I'm a third year 
Bio-Tech student.

101
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I think this belongs 
to your classmate.

102
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,370
Yeah. This is Rohit's.

103
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,500
I found it by the basketball court.

104
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,830
I wanted to find him but 
he's nowhere in college.

105
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,540
Well, he quit college and left!

106
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,410
Did he quit college?

107
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,290
He got a job in Korea since he 
had finished his engineering course.

108
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,750
So he discontinued the 
course and quit college.

109
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,330
If you want to give it personally, 
you'll have to go to Korea.

110
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,660
Thank you. 
- It's okay!

111
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,450
Did he not look like Rohit?

112
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,370
Was it really him or 
am I imagining this?

113
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,370
Oh God!

114
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,250
It really is him!

115
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,540
Thanks! 
- It's okay.

116
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,950
What is he doing 
here in Mumbai?!

117
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,160
That too in my apartment?!

118
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,830
But, why are you hiding now? 
He has no clue about you.

119
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,330
Act normal!

120
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,620
What do I do now?

121
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,330
Go talk to him.

122
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,790
Practice your lines 
before you do!

123
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,620
*MUFFLED REHEARSAL*

124
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,950
Oh! This guy will get 
down in the next floor.

125
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,500
And then, it's just 
us in the lift!

126
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,700
Just the thought of it is giving 
me the jeebs in my tummy!

127
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,910
There he goes!

128
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,370
I'm suffocating!

129
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Looks like I'm never talking 
to him in this lifetime!

130
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,370
You are.. Dia.. 
Dia Swaroop, right?

131
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,500
Hi! My name's Rohit.

132
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,910
I was also a student if 
CMRIT in Bengaluru. M.Tech.

133
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,040
But due to some reasons, 
I couldn't complete the course.

134
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,830
I've seen you before.

135
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,370
Where was that?

136
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,500
If you can recall, you'd 
once burst the test tube in..

137
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,370
...the Chemistry lab sending a 
few classmates into shock.

138
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,250
'You were the reason 
behind the explosion'

139
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,950
I was talking to your professor 
and he had told me your name.

140
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,450
Oh! Is it?

141
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,750
And how come you're here? 
- I'm here on work.

142
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,580
I moved in this afternoon. 
I'm staying in 701.

143
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,120
What? 701?!

144
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,370
Yes! Why do you ask?

145
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,290
I stay right opposite to you. 
In 702!

146
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,910
Is it? What a coincidence!

147
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,370
I'll leave now. Let's meet again.

148
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,790
Bye! 
- Bye.

149
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,370
Dia? 
- Huh?

150
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,620
I studied in that 
college for eight months.

151
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,040
In those eight months, did 
you even know who I was?

152
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,500
Or did you ever see me in college?

153
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,160
Uncle, he's Rohit. 
He studied in my college in Bengaluru.

154
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,330
Oh. Is it?

155
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,290
Hi Rohit! 
- Hi Sir!

156
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm Madhav Rao. 
I'm their family friend.

157
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,790
I live in Flat no.203. If you 
need anything, feel free to ask.

158
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,870
Sure, sir.

159
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,370
He's my father.

160
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Hello, Sir. 
- Hello.

161
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,410
Okay Dia. We're heading 
out for some work.

162
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,250
You asked if I'd seen 
you in college, right?

163
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,000
If only I'd stared into my 
books as much as I stared..

164
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,040
...at you, I would've 
topped the class.

165
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,700
If we'd stayed any longer, we could 
have finished our morning jog.

166
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,750
Do you always jog?

167
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,330
Yeah! I made it a habit 
when I was in Korea.

168
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,580
And you?

169
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,830
Me? And jogging?

170
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,160
I generally wake up only by 9 A.M. 
- Why so late?

171
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,370
Oh! Do you sleep late?

172
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,160
No. I do sleep pretty early.

173
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,620
I think I have an issue.

174
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,620
I can't sleep continuously 
at one stretch.

175
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,660
Even minute sounds tend to disturb me. 
I have a disturbed sleep pattern.

176
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,200
There's a belief in Korea.

177
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,040
If you're not able to sleep, it's because 
you're awake in someone else's dreams.

178
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,120
'If that's the case, you would've 
never slept through your M.Tech days.'

179
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,910
Here's what you can 
do if you can't sleep.

180
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,000
Before you sleep, close your eyes 
for a minute and imagine..

181
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,620
...who you would want to 
spend your entire life with.

182
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,500
Tell them a message 
and try sleeping.

183
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,120
You'll get a good night's sleep.

184
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,660
And where does this 
belief come from?

185
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,750
From the belief that 
we're secure in life.

186
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,040
I wish to spend all 
my life with you.

187
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,160
I love you.

188
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,120
Jogging!

189
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,040
Dear Dia..

190
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,450
19th March 2016.

191
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,080
On that day, a precious 
moment took place in my life.

192
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,450
My heart found its other half.

193
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,950
Except you, everyone else 
became strangers to me.

194
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,330
An invisible wall got 
created between me and them.

195
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,200
You might just be another 
person to the world

196
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,790
But to me you became my world.

197
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,410
ROHIT: Hi. My name's Rohit. 
I did my M.Tech in CMRIT, Bengaluru.

198
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Please forgive me.

199
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,540
Because I've no words to 
express how much I love you.

200
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,660
But one thing's for sure.

201
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,450
Every time I take a 
breath, I think of you!

202
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,160
Love you, Rohit.

203
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,160
Who was she?

204
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,250
My office colleague.

205
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,500
She proposed me.

206
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,120
And what did you tell her?

207
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,370
I told her, "That there's 
a girl who has made me..

208
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,620
...forget all the others 
girls in the world."

209
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,910
That I came to 
Mumbai only for her.

210
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,250
I was the one who was stealing 
your drawings in college.

211
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,330
And I was putting them 
up only to impress you.

212
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,750
Do you know now? Whose 
dream you were always up in?

213
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,910
We wasted three years, right?

214
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,290
But there are thirty more to go.

215
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,910
Okay! I'll see you tomorrow. 
Bye.

216
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,950
Sorry. It was a call from office.

217
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,790
I got out faking a head ache, 
but they're giving me one for real.

218
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,120
I love you!

219
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,080
It's 6 P.M. already and the film's 
yet to start. Is there some issue?

220
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,120
I love you!

221
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,660
Did you say something? 
- Didn't you hear me?

222
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,870
Nope. 
- What's wrong with you today?

223
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,080
On any other day, you would have 
told it a hundred odd times by now.

224
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,540
Chuck saying it once, 
you're pretending to not..

225
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,750
...have heard me when 
I'm saying it out loud.

226
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,790
What's wrong?

227
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,540
Are you angry with me?

228
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,370
I've no reasons to 
be angry with you.

229
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,870
The thing is.. Today I read 
in the newspaper that..

230
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,200
...'One touch is 
equal to thousand words'.

231
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,700
One touch is equal to thousand words!

232
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,080
What are you saying?

233
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,160
Let me explain..

234
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,290
We'll spend the rest of our 
lives with each other, right?

235
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,700
Yeah.

236
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,750
So, if any one of us wishes to 
say 'I love you' to each other..

237
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
We need to hold each 
other's hand and..

238
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,540
I.. Love.. You..!

239
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,410
Press each other's hand thrice.

240
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,910
Doing this once is the same as 
saying it out loud a thousand times.

241
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,450
One touch is equal 
to thousand words.

242
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,330
I can sense the difference.

243
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,700
But this seems incomplete, right?

244
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,040
How does one reply to this?

245
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,040
Very smart.

246
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,290
It's very simple.

247
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,370
Me.. Too..

248
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,540
Press it twice and you're done.

249
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,830
Seems childish, 
but it's effective.

250
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,000
I.. Love.. You..!

251
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,660
Me.. Too!

252
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,660
Next month, I've asked my sister and 
brother-in-law to come to Mumbai.

253
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,120
To Mumbai? For what?

254
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,330
To discuss about our 
marriage with your father..

255
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,750
Oh.. For that..

256
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,290
What happened?

257
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,660
What happened?!

258
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,580
I doubt if my father will 
agree to our marriage.

259
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,120
Oh! You think so?

260
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,750
Erm.. What do we do now?

261
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,540
Okay. We can do this..

262
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,540
Dude, let's go!

263
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,700
Stop you idiot!

264
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,620
He got away!

265
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,040
Dear Lord!

266
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,540
Call the ambulance! Hurry up!

267
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,580
Dia? How are you dear?

268
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,660
Rohit? - Umm..

269
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,790
Rohit's doing fine.

270
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,200
Nothing to worry. He's fine.

271
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,620
I want to see him.

272
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,450
That's not possible now.

273
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,200
He's in the ICU.

274
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,580
No one's being allowed inside.

275
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,830
I shall take you there later.

276
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,080
I want to see him now.

277
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,910
Okay. Lie down.

278
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,700
The thing is..

279
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,750
Dia..

280
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,410
Rohit had passed away before we 
could get him to the hospital.

281
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,870
He's dead.

282
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,790
I'm sorry.

283
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,540
Calm down dear. Please!

284
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,950
I.. Love.. You.

285
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,410
Dia is extremely upset.

286
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,080
UNCLE: Let's send her over to 
your sister's house in Bengaluru.

287
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,120
A change of place could help.

288
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,200
Since Smitha's also there, 
she'll be more comfortable.

289
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,000
Hello? - Hello Dia.

290
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,700
What are you up to?

291
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,450
I'm sitting in the park.

292
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,330
Oh. Is it? Also.. Dia..?

293
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,450
There is a doctor's appointment 
this evening, right?

294
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,040
Can you go by yourself 
to the hospital?

295
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,370
I'm out with my friends.

296
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,410
I might get a little late.

297
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,370
I'm sorry. Please don't mind?

298
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,870
Hello? - Hello!

299
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,870
Is this Dia Soup 
on the other side?

300
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,910
It isn't Soup.. It's Swaroop.

301
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,700
I know. I was just kidding.

302
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,580
I was hoping to make you 
laugh, since you're upset.

303
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,290
Are you wondering, 
how I got to know?

304
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,790
Don't worry.

305
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,200
I do have some good 
news to make you happy.

306
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,700
Want me to tell you?

307
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:40,370
This noon, when you were 
walking alone in the park road.

308
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,450
Hello? I couldn't hear you. 
Repeat what you just said.

309
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,290
Hello?

310
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,790
The bike needs to be 
given for service, is it?

311
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,330
Fine. 
How about you come to my room?

312
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,620
From my room, 
let's go to the service station.

313
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Hand over the bike and 
then head to the stadium.

314
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,830
Is that fine?

315
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,250
You! Stop!

316
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,330
Stop right there.

317
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,120
I got the bag and 
looked for you..

318
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,410
But you were nowhere to be seen.

319
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,500
Looks like you had already 
left to the police station.

320
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,290
So, now.. 
Your vanity bag is with me.

321
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,290
Now tell me. 
When and where will you meet me?

322
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,410
Tell me where, and I'll come 
and handover the bag in person.

323
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,870
Where do we meet? 
Would a Coffee Day do?

324
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,910
I don't need the bag. 
Keep it with yourself.

325
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,700
Please don't call me again.

326
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,580
Huh? 
You don't want the bag is it?

327
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,040
It has your debit and credit 
cards, with some cash..

328
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,000
Hello?

329
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,540
To hell with this woman!

330
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,200
If she didn't want the bag, 
I could've given it to the thief himself.

331
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,120
Poor guy could have 
used some money.

332
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,910
Leave that. 
How did you find her phone number?

333
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,120
The bag had a CICI 
bank debit card.

334
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,700
Our Raju works in their 
customer care, right?

335
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,040
Raju who? You mean Buttermilk Raju? 
- Yep! Him!

336
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,910
I gave him the card number. 
He gave me the phone number.

337
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,450
She scolded me and 
disconnected the call.

338
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,040
Have you ever heard 
of this before?

339
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,620
A girl refusing to 
take her vanity bag?

340
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,700
I've never come 
across this before.

341
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,580
This is why they say, 
"Life is full of surprises and miracles"

342
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,580
Do estimate the costs 
and let me know.

343
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,370
I forgot to tell you this. 
- What?

344
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,870
Tonight, Mother India will 
be coming down from Karwar.

345
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,620
Oh, is it? 
- Yes. She's taking the night bus.

346
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,000
She's coming down for a medical conference. 
That’s in two weeks..

347
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,540
Sir.. 
It will cost you Rs.4,500/-

348
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,290
Rs 4,500?! - Yes, sir.

349
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,870
The chain sprocket needs 
to be completely replaced.

350
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,500
Oil needs to be replaced.

351
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,330
This alone will cost you Rs.2,000/- 
- Dude, I'll be back.

352
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,790
Chandru?

353
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,500
Please attend Consultation No.1.

354
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,250
Sudha? You're next.

355
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,910
Lakshmi: If only Karwar 
had a hospital like this..

356
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,580
Hello Ma'am. 
- Can I meet Dr.Vidya?

357
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,620
Dr.Lakshmi? Welcome ma'am.

358
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,200
Ma'am has strictly instructed 
me to bring you to her.

359
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,910
What's with that reaction?

360
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,790
Lakki! I'm proud to call you as my mother. 
Very proud!

361
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,080
And why's that?

362
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,750
Because people in your profession 
have a high opinion of you!

363
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,120
Adi, I'll need an hour 
to get done with work.

364
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,330
It's an important case.

365
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,660
Take your time, Lakki. 
I'll be at a library close by.

366
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,790
Finish your work and call 
me, I'll come right away.

367
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,870
Dia Swaroop?

368
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,450
Dia Swaroop..?

369
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,830
You're here to meet the 
Orthopaedic, right?

370
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,250
She's checking other patients. 
Please wait for five minutes.

371
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,000
Can I get a picture 
of your feet?

372
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,500
So that I can set it 
as my mobile wallpaper?

373
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,250
Dia Soup?

374
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,370
When I'd called you, 
were you out on some important work?

375
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,120
You switched off your 
phone after telling me..

376
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,370
...to keep the bag and 
that you don't want it.

377
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,910
Or did you think that I 
was with the thief and..

378
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,950
...that I called you over 
to rob everything off you?

379
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,290
I'm sorry.

380
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,700
I was kidding again, 
since you were upset.

381
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,580
Okay.

382
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,040
You finish your 
consultation and wait here.

383
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,250
I'll get your bag 
as soon as possible.

384
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,250
Lakki, I didn't know that one had to 
struggle so much to do a good deed!

385
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,620
You can only take the 
horse to the water.

386
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,120
But you can't make it drink, right? 
Let it go.

387
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,410
And where are we going now?

388
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,290
I told you that bike is 
out on service, right?

389
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,000
That should be done by now.

390
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,750
Let's collect the bike and head to a 
mall to enjoy the air conditioning.

391
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,910
Okay.

392
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,950
And then..

393
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,120
Lakki, there's a 
surprise waiting for you.

394
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,620
A surprise? What is it?

395
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,290
The surprise is that..

396
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,790
I'd told you about a new bike I 
saw at the service store, right?

397
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
The one you showed 
me on the internet?

398
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,080
Yep. The same bike.

399
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,450
I've decided to buy that bike.

400
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,290
The same bike? - Yep.

401
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,750
Weren't you telling 
me that it was heavy?

402
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,040
It's not like I’ll be carrying the 
bike around, I'll be riding it.

403
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,700
But then.. weren't you telling 
me that it was quite expensive?

404
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,450
It does cost Rs.2.25 lakhs..

405
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,830
But you don't worry. 
My PF money from the last company..

406
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,450
...is available. 
I'm also thinking of taking a loan.

407
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,500
I don't think you should do it.

408
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,660
It isn't worth to invest 
so much on a bike.

409
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,620
Instead buy a less 
expensive one?

410
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,580
Umm.. I can.

411
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,870
But I felt like buying a new 
one only after seeing that.

412
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,830
I don't know.

413
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,790
I'm not really okay 
with you buying it.

414
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,330
I'll leave it to you.

415
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,910
Yes.. You can begin with 
the antibiotic course.

416
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,950
With the.. Cephalexin.

417
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:49,040
Also, how many were there 
for the Polio drive?

418
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,370
Adi?

419
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,000
Did you feel bad?

420
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,000
Can't lie that I didn't.

421
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,160
I did feel bad.. A little.

422
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,370
But I'll ask you again..

423
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,660
Do you really not want 
me to buy that bike?

424
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,000
Don't buy it. 
It doesn't feel right.

425
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,660
You go on with your calls, 
I'll go get the serviced bike.

426
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,620
Please wait for five minutes. 
The bill needs to be generated.

427
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,540
Your bike will be brought outside. 
Thank you.

428
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,620
Ambika! 
Please take this invoice.

429
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,370
Excuse me, sir?

430
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,910
Congratulations, sir. 
From this moment, this bike is yours.

431
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,790
Right after the day 
you saw the bike,..

432
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,330
...your mother came down 
and booked it for you.

433
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,700
Hello?

434
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,750
I don't like it 
when you buy things.

435
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,830
But I love buying 
things for you.

436
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,540
You ape!

437
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,040
Do you know how innocent you 
look when you're sleeping?

438
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,450
Everybody looks innocent 
when they're sleeping.

439
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,540
Only when one’s awake will 
you see a man's true colour.

440
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,330
Fine. I've written a letter for you. 
Can I read it out for you?

441
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,500
A letter? 
- Yeah.

442
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,250
Read it out.

443
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,080
Don't laugh, okay?

444
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,410
To, Dear Mom..

445
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,700
Sometimes I wonder if my body..

446
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,950
What happened?

447
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,910
You just called me mom..

448
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,620
Tell me why I call you Lakki..?

449
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,000
Because my name's Lakshmi!

450
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,370
In short, you call me Lakki.

451
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,580
Nope.

452
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,910
Isn't that the reason?

453
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,290
Till date, I thought that is 
why you were calling me Lakki.

454
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,080
Then why?

455
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,540
The answer to that is in 
the end of the letter.

456
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,790
So be patient.

457
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,790
To, Dear Mom..

458
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:44,370
Sometimes I wonder if 
my body has two hearts.

459
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,580
Would it be possible to love 
you so much with just one heart?

460
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,620
I love the fact that I love you!

461
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,080
You've simplified 
my life so much..

462
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,450
That none of the problems 
seem problematic at all.

463
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,290
They all seem trivial.. - Adi?

464
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,660
Why's the house owner here?

465
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,620
Good Morning Adi! 
- Morning, Uncle.

466
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,750
Looks like you've bought a new bike. 
Congratulations!

467
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,660
Could you park your bike outside? 
I need to take my car out.

468
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,290
Oh! Sorry uncle.

469
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,330
Give me a minute. 
Let me get the keys.

470
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,000
Looks like the movie's underway.. 
- What are the seat numbers?

471
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,200
Row number I-10 and 11

472
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,790
If I don't watch a movie from the 
beginning, it doesn't feel right at all.

473
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,950
Sir? 
- Huh?

474
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,290
How long since the movie started? 
- It should end anytime now.

475
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,160
Dude! I'll get something to eat.

476
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,790
Are you feeling better now?

477
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,700
You were at the hospital, right?

478
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,700
So now tell me.

479
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,250
What injustice have I done to you? 
Huh?

480
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,330
I ran back to the hospital 
thinking I'll earn ten..

481
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,910
...kilograms of good deeds 
by returning your bag.

482
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,620
You were nowhere to be seen.

483
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,250
Do you know how bad I felt?

484
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,040
I'm sorry.

485
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,080
Fine. What's done 
is done already.

486
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,120
Here's what you're going to do. 
My room's at a walkable distance from here.

487
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,120
Once the movie ends, you'll come along 
with me and collect your bag. Okay?

488
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,950
Have you come alone?

489
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,910
I've come with my cousin, 
she's gone to the washroom.

490
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,330
Will you have something 
to eat or drink?

491
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,950
I don't want anything.

492
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,410
Come on! You'll have to take 
something for having met again..

493
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,950
No need.

494
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,790
If I leave you alone for a while, 
you'll disappear again

495
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,120
No need to eat anything.

496
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,700
Not bad. Your cousin 
Smitha is pretty friendly.

497
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,040
See how weird life is..

498
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,080
I had no plans of 
coming for this movie.

499
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,120
At the end moment, my friend 
forced me to come along.

500
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,910
And I find you next to me.

501
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,950
This is why it's said that life's 
full of surprises and miracles..

502
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,500
What do you say?

503
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,750
Life isn't what you just said..

504
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,910
This is life!

505
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,500
Full of problems and pain.

506
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,580
Here.

507
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,250
So, according to you, everyone in this 
world has one or the other pain or problem.

508
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,830
Looks like you don't 
know Bengaluru well.

509
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,580
Which is why you're saying this.

510
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,790
Right here there's an area. 
People who live there..

511
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:59,580
Till date haven't faced any problems and 
are living happily. Do you believe me?

512
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,040
That's impossible!

513
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,250
There's no one without problems. 
- Then come with me..

514
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,410
I'll take you to that area right away.

515
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,580
See for yourself, how happily 
people are living there.

516
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,580
Let's go.

517
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,080
What are you thinking? 
Aren't you curious?

518
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,410
If you don't come along, 
I won't return your bag.

519
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,410
Feel free to complain 
with the cops!

520
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,250
Please come!

521
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,790
I ran like a mad dog behind 
the thief just for your bag!

522
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,290
Did you know that I 
have cuts on my legs?

523
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,790
Please come along.

524
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,290
Come on. 
That area's really nice.

525
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,660
You'll enjoy a lot!

526
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,580
Ms. Dia..

527
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,660
As far as I know. The 
only ones who're living..

528
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,500
...without any problems 
or pain in his world..

529
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,910
Are those who reside here.

530
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:07,040
So.. Take a good look at them!

531
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,290
See, how peacefully 
everyone's sleeping.

532
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,000
Actually you're right..

533
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,040
People on this earth have 
one or the other problem.

534
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,000
It is just like... Like 
a moustache and beard..

535
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:36,450
No matter how hard you try, 
it'll keep growing.

536
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,750
But when it does arrive, 
how we react to it..

537
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,200
Is what will decide if 
we're happy or sad.

538
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,910
It's all about our attitude 
towards the problem.

539
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,870
What's ironic is that..

540
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,660
It is our problems that make 
our lives more interesting.

541
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,120
Without which there 
wouldn't be any difference..

542
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,910
...between those who are 
sleeping here and us.

543
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,120
But how long can one keep 
eating only Mysuru Pak?

544
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,370
To say it in simple words..

545
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,290
Life isn't about living 
without problems.

546
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,580
It's about how we solve 
our problems and live on.

547
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,950
But Dia..

548
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,330
You went ahead to end your life 
because you lost your loved one, right?

549
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,950
You had the courage 
to kill yourself.

550
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,040
Couldn't you show the 
same courage to live?

551
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,700
Thank God that 
nothing went wrong..

552
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,870
At a time like this, 
I have one thing to say..

553
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,450
We'll attain peace for real, 
only when we accept our reality.

554
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,620
Accept the reality.

555
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,120
Let him go.

556
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,660
I know it's easier 
said than done..

557
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,620
But you have to.

558
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,910
You have two options now.

559
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:27,790
One. Is to keep thinking of 
Rohit and live in sorrow.

560
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,370
Two. To forget him 
and start a new life.

561
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,200
Choose the one that 
seems right to you.

562
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,080
Adi?

563
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
Hello?

564
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,330
I'm outside your house. 
Come out.

565
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:19,040
Hello Adi? 
- We're going out. Come on!

566
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:43,370
Adi, please tell me 
where you're taking me.

567
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,580
Phew!

568
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:48,330
How long will you ask the same 
question like a broken record?

569
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,750
Told you right? That 
we're heading somewhere!

570
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,950
But where are we going? 
- To some place.

571
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,580
You trust me right?

572
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,040
A bit too much.

573
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,250
Then stop asking me 
questions and come quietly.

574
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,410
Adi, please don't take me to the 
graveyard at this hour.

575
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,080
I'll get very scared!

576
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,950
You never know!

577
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,200
'BEST WISHES FROM!'

578
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:13,870
Everyone get ready! 
1.. 2.. 3.. Start!

579
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:51,200
All Hail Bombay Queen, Dia Swaroop! 
- Hurray!

580
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,040
All Hail Birthday Queen, Dia Swaroop! 
- Hurray!

581
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,910
All Hail Beauty Queen, Dia Swaroop!

582
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,080
Beauty Queen doesn't suit her, right? 
*IN UNISON* - Yeah!

583
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:09,200
All Hail the Normal Queen, Dia Swaroop! 
- Hurray!

584
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,120
I wish we had three birthdays in 
a year, we could have enjoyed..

585
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,910
You look like you've come 
straight out of the graveyeard.

586
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,040
Even you look the same.

587
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,080
Really?

588
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,700
I've turned into a male ghost.

589
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,000
They stuffed the cake 
right into my nose and ears!

590
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,290
Thank you Adi!

591
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,330
Thank you so much.

592
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:57,500
Thanks to you, I feel 
good about myself.

593
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,660
I feel like I am a 
special person too.

594
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:05,790
I love myself! 
- Woah! Woman..

595
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,870
Now you're on the right track.

596
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,450
And... Don't show 
yourself to anyone else.

597
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,870
One look at that 
pretty face of yours..

598
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,160
And they'll go mad thinking they 
saw a ghost inside the house!

599
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,370
That won't happen. 
There's no one at home.

600
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,250
Everyone's gone to Tumakuru.

601
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,250
What? No one's home is it?

602
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,200
No one except me.

603
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,500
Do you have any 
common sense at all?

604
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,540
My face is stinking of eggs!

605
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,370
You're the birthday girl!

606
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,620
Instead of calling me inside 
and making me a cup of coffee!

607
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,500
You're making me stand out 
here and are thanking me..

608
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,290
Drat! I'm sorry Adi.

609
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:53,160
It didn't occur to me at all. 
Please come inside.

610
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,620
Fine! I'll come in.

611
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:00,290
It's all my fate.

612
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:04,160
You were right Adi. 
I dont' have any common sense.

613
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,870
I'm sorry.

614
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,000
It's okay. Common sense 
is not so common.

615
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,250
Here you go. Drink and 
let me know how it is.

616
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,700
That I will! For sure.

617
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,500
If it's not good, I'll 
pour it over your head!

618
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,580
How is it?

619
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,700
Where has this talent 
of yours been hiding?

620
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,830
This is too good.

621
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,620
When did you master this craft?

622
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,330
Your husband is going 
to be very lucky to..

623
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,080
...drink and eat all 
these delicious food.

624
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,000
I've decided not to marry.

625
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,120
Where will the point 
of a husband come from?

626
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,080
You're insulting me.

627
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,080
Insult? How? 
- What else..?

628
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,870
When a guy like me is 
right in front of you?

629
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,700
How did you decide 
that you won't marry?

630
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:57,790
Adi, please!

631
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Don't joke about this.

632
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,750
You might have a lot 
of friends like me.

633
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,540
But you're my only best friend.

634
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:11,040
Let's not bring love in 
between our friendship.

635
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,700
I've suffered enough because of love.

636
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,370
If you bring it up again.. 
- I'm sorry.

637
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,700
It was at the tip of my tongue 
and I said it out loud. Don't worry.

638
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,790
When the last birthday of your life is due. 
Your 99th birthday..

639
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,120
Let's celebrate that birthday 
together in a big way.

640
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,830
As best friends.

641
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,580
Happy now?

642
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,620
These conditions 
apply to you too.

643
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,580
You should not bring 
up these topics either.

644
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,160
No. I won't.

645
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,160
It's good that the 
bike ran out of fuel.

646
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:07,790
With every push of this bike, 
my pants are getting ripped off!

647
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,290
And this seems like 
fun to you, huh?

648
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,040
You're a sadist.

649
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,040
Nah. Not for that.

650
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,000
Our departing moment got delayed 
by fifteen minutes, right?

651
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,500
That's why.

652
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:28,120
You're talking as if we'll never 
meet again in our lifetime..

653
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,540
We may meet again someday..

654
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,450
And we will meet for sure.

655
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,410
But we won't be able 
to meet from tomorrow.

656
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,410
I'm going back to 
Mumbai for good, Adi.

657
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,290
You’re going back? 
- Yeah.

658
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,500
My aunt's mother is unwell.

659
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,660
She's going to her native 
to take care of her.

660
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:57,120
How can I stay at her 
house without her around?

661
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,620
Is that why Smitha called 
you in the evening?

662
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:03,450
Then why didn't you 
tell me back then?

663
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,200
If I had told you, we would've 
spoken only about me leaving.

664
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:11,660
You should have told me. 
And now it seems so sudden..

665
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:16,160
When are you leaving?

666
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,160
I'm taking the 7.30 A.M. bus.

667
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,830
Okay.

668
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,080
Give me a second.

669
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,750
Shall we begin the 
farewell program?

670
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,870
Go back and start a new life.

671
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,950
Remember this. 
Life goes by in seconds.

672
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,250
Make sure you do only 
those things that you like.

673
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:29,330
That doesn't mean you start smoking 
because you like cigarettes.

674
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,500
Only the good things.

675
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,080
And if you encounter 
any problems, doubts or..

676
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,410
...confusions, you already have 
the customer care number.

677
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:46,080
Customer care number? 
- My mobile number.

678
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,500
Of course. Who else will I call?

679
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,500
Just a second.

680
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:58,000
Here. A small gift from me.

681
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,080
A Gift? 
Okay.

682
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,040
Wait.. We saw this at the mall..

683
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,950
Bought this for you when 
you went to get your bike.

684
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,660
Oh! I'm sorry.

685
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,540
I have nothing to give you.

686
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,290
Will you take this 
bike with you?

687
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,290
That's fine.

688
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,910
I already have a gift from you.

689
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,790
You already have a gift from me?

690
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,750
What is it? 
- It's you.

691
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:49,450
You're my biggest gift.

692
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,330
Would've been nice if you 
stayed back for another day.

693
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,200
You're saying the exact 
thing that's on my mind.

694
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,290
But I have to go.

695
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,330
Adi?

696
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:22,200
Why are you calling at this hour Adi? 
- Lakki! Don't panic! Calm down.

697
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:27,200
I'm doing good, and I’m awesome.

698
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:31,200
I felt like talking to you. 
So only I called.

699
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,750
For a moment I got so worried.

700
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:38,120
So? Were you asleep?

701
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,450
Nah! I was playing 
cricket with Nanjamma!

702
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,620
Quit wasting time and 
tell me why you're upset.

703
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,160
Oh! Looks like you got 
a whiff of my mood.

704
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,080
Yep. The stink reached me. 
Tell me.

705
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,330
It's nothing.

706
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,500
Dia's going back to Mumbai. 
So..

707
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,410
Why do I smell something more? 
- Nothing of that sorts Lakki.

708
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,330
Over time, we've gotten 
closer to each other.

709
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,660
And now, out of the blue she 
told me that she's leaving.

710
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,700
So...

711
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,290
Well.. She had to 
go someday, right?

712
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,620
She had to..

713
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,040
I feel it would've been nice if 
she'd stayed back for another day.

714
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,080
What does Dia have 
to say about it?

715
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,580
Let's say that she 
felt the same too.

716
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,250
Fine. Here's what you can do.

717
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:31,620
Let Dia not go to Mumbai directly. 
You both head to Mangaluru.

718
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,120
Konkan Express goes to Mumbai 
from Mangaluru at 11.45 P.M.

719
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,620
You both can board it.

720
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:42,120
You get down at Karwar. 
She can continue to Mumbai.

721
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,580
You both can spend a day together.

722
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:49,500
What an idea Lakki!

723
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,830
You should've become a criminal 
lawyer instead of a doctor.

724
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,290
I've to tell Dia 
about this right away.

725
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:58,000
I'll see you in Karwar. Bye.

726
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,910
Hello Adi? 
- What is it?

727
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,000
How will you be coming to 
Mangaluru from Bengaluru?

728
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,200
How else? We'll take the bus.

729
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,410
You doofus!

730
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:09,450
You think I bought you that bike 
worth Rs 2 lakhs so that you..

731
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:12,660
...can use it like a public bus 
between your room and tuition?

732
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,790
The weather's good. 
The scenery on the way is beautiful.

733
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,950
Instead of enjoying 
the nature and riding..

734
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:21,500
...down on a bike, you 
speak of taking the bus.

735
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,410
What are you doing here?

736
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,250
I'd gone to take a leak.

737
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,200
It was suffocating inside.

738
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,870
So I'm out here 
breathing some fresh air.

739
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,120
We spent a day like 
it was a minute.

740
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:13,200
Ours must have been the shortest 
bike trip in the pages of history.

741
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,200
When you’re happy, 
that is how it is.

742
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,370
Time goes by very quickly.

743
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,080
I forgot to tell you this.

744
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:23,790
The train reaches the Karwar 
station at 7:30 in the morning.

745
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:29,330
The moment we arrive, I'll leave without 
even taking a look at your face.

746
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,830
You also do the same. Don't get 
down from your seat. Stay put!

747
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:39,410
But why? 
- Because this whole process of..

748
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:43,450
..our loved ones departing while we 
stand by the door or window..

749
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,080
...with a long face., looking 
at the train while it disappears..

750
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,410
...tends to bring a bit of pain.

751
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:53,500
We're anyways moving away. 
Why make it worse?

752
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,660
Let's just bid 
goodbye and leave.

753
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,160
Come. Let's go.

754
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,830
Let's do it your way.

755
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:03,830
You get off the train on your 
own and I'll stay in my seat.

756
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,830
So? How long do you 
plan to stay in Karwar?

757
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:12,040
My slipper slipped away!

758
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:25,910
Let them find the pair together. 
What good will one slipper do?

759
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,200
The girl in the upper 
berth's pretty, right?

760
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,080
Love in a train coach, huh? 
- Nah! Nothing of those sorts.

761
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:45,160
Just appreciating 
the finer things in life.

762
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:50,540
Say you fall in love with someone 
in the future. What will you do?

763
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,370
I'll go ahead and propose her.

764
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,500
Don't rush!

765
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,330
Introduce her to me.

766
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:03,250
Within fifteen minutes, I'll find 
out if she loves you or not.

767
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,870
Check out Ms. Bond!

768
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,120
Madam claims to find out if 
someone's in love in fifteen minutes.

769
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:15,120
Well you know that 
I've a doctorate in Love.

770
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,200
Oh ya. You're right.

771
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:21,500
As you say madam. If ever I 
fall in love with someone..

772
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,000
Aye! Go to bed.

773
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,790
You both have been snuffling 
like bandicoots since then!

774
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,160
Go to bed!

775
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:32,330
Drat! As if my wife annoying 
me at home wasn't enough.

776
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,830
Excuse me? 
Wake up!

777
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,160
Has the station arrived?

778
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,160
The station won't arrive anywhere, 
we've arrived at the station!

779
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,200
The train reached five minutes ago. 
Get going.

780
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,250
Thank your Boss! 
Dia?

781
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:31,160
"You get off the train on your 
own and I'll stay in my seat."

782
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,580
Hello? 
- Hello Madam!

783
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,370
I think you got off 
at the wrong station.

784
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:22,540
Your station is pretty far away. 
- What do I do, sir?

785
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,040
I wish to spend as much 
time as I possibly can..

786
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,950
...with my best friend 
before my station arrives.

787
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:34,910
But he clearly has no common sense to 
invite his friend who's come to his town.

788
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,870
Slap me once!

789
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
Huh? 
- Slap me once.

790
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:57,370
I've made a mistake. I should have 
invited you home, but I didn't..

791
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,200
...and just like you told, I have 
no common sense. Slap me!

792
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,120
That's okay.

793
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:05,870
A guy once told me that 'Common 
sense is not so common'.

794
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,290
The same idiot is now telling 
you that, 'Guilty must be..

795
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:11,200
...punished'. That the wrong ones 
have to be punished. Slap me now!

796
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:13,700
It's okay. Leave it now. 
- It's okay. Slap me.

797
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,910
You have the right to slap. 
I deserve to be slapped.

798
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,410
I won't feel bad about it. 
Be bold and..

799
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,000
I'm.. Sorry!

800
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,040
Now the debts have been cleared!

801
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,580
Please come home? Please?!

802
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,250
On you next visit, 
don't bring the child.

803
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,370
Take this.

804
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:03,830
Who's next?

805
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:06,370
Hello Doctor! I've AIDS!

806
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,120
How come you're alone? 
Where's Dia?

807
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:16,830
She seemed a bit tired. I asked 
her to rest and came by myself.

808
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:19,450
It must be the stress 
from the travel.

809
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:22,410
Wait! There are no other 
patients outside, right?

810
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:24,830
My mother has taught 
me basic etiquette.

811
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,080
What are you doing?

812
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,250
I'm checking for 
sounds in my tummy.

813
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:42,660
Is that so? I was wondering if you were 
checking for those two hearts in your body.

814
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,950
What are you saying Lakki? 
Who will have two hearts in their body?

815
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,910
There are two kidneys. 
And the heart, just..

816
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,830
The Letter!

817
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,330
How come I who wrote 
it has forgotten, but..

818
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:01,410
...you remember it just 
by listening to it?

819
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:04,580
How could I forget it? 
You've written such an adorable letter.

820
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,330
You've praised me to the skies.

821
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:11,200
What's this Lakki? You're smitten 
just by listening to one third of it?

822
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,870
If you read it all, that is it.. 
Come lie down!

823
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:19,120
Tell me the truth. Do you 
mean it from your heart?

824
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,160
Or is it all for the sake of...?

825
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,500
Lakki, you're hurting me.

826
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,910
I've written from my heart. 
Now take those words back!

827
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:30,160
I'm sorry! I take my words back!

828
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,660
Now sleep!

829
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,830
Where did I stop?

830
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:41,830
If I've helped someone today, their 
gratitude shouldn't be towards me..

831
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,790
But towards you.

832
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:48,450
Because, whatever I am today, 
you are the reason for it.

833
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:54,330
I always knew that 
you were my mother.

834
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,540
But when did you 
become my best friend?

835
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:03,290
Whatever it is that I 
want to hear from you..

836
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:06,040
How do you say 
those exact words?

837
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,910
Hello? 
- Hello? Brother Adi?

838
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:14,080
Her body temperature 
is flaming hot!

839
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:16,080
Bring mom and come home soon!

840
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,450
Dia's supposedly unwell.

841
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,700
How long until 
aunty returns home?

842
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,080
I don't know.

843
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,290
She called me to tell that 
there's an emergency case.

844
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,950
She spends more time in 
the hospital than at home.

845
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,580
Drink some more. 
- I'm done.

846
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,330
Okay.

847
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,370
I'll keep it here. Have 
it when you feel like it.

848
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,870
I'm troubling all of 
you for no reason.

849
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,580
Will you have some more water?

850
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,830
I just drank some. 
- How about dinner?

851
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,160
Dinner? 
- Do you need a sleeping tablet?

852
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,250
Sleeping tablet?!

853
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,160
Then what will you take 
to shut up and sleep?

854
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,040
So much for troubles!

855
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,540
I hate all these formalities. 
I won't talk to you.

856
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:00,750
I'm done with you!

857
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:03,910
Sorry.

858
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,450
If you speak of 
troubling me again..

859
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,870
I’ll break your teeth!

860
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:18,950
Okay. Get some peaceful sleep.

861
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:20,660
I'll be right outside 
in the living room.

862
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,160
If you need anything..

863
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:26,870
Whistle out and I'll 
come running to you.

864
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,040
I just checked if 
you could hear me.

865
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,450
I pretty much can.

866
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:53,120
Apparently my horoscope and theVaastu of this house doesn't match.

867
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,080
If one eye's sleeping, the 
other eye's up all night.

868
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,910
My sleep pattern's 
a bit disrupted.

869
01:29:58,910 --> 01:29:59,950
Oh is it?

870
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:02,040
Here's what you can do.

871
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,950
I wish to spend all 
my life with you.

872
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,660
I love you!

873
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,540
How do I tell her Lakki?

874
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,330
Having casually told each other 
that we won't talk about love,..

875
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,830
How can I tell her that 
I really love her now?

876
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,410
She seems to be at 
peace with her past.

877
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:09,040
She even believes that 
I'm the reason for it.

878
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,330
Would it be right if I spoil it all?

879
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:14,000
Since when did you 
start being so negative?

880
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,120
Why do you assume that 
she won't accept you?

881
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,040
Try talking to her once. 
Let's see what happens.

882
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,080
It's not as easy as 
you're thinking it to be.

883
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,790
If she accepts, then it's fine.

884
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,250
If she rejects..

885
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,080
It'll turn ugly.

886
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,000
I won't be able to face her.

887
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:34,700
Adi?

888
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,410
Lakki, Dia's here. 
I'll call you later.

889
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,200
Adi?

890
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,450
How are you now? 
- You mean the fever?

891
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:54,910
The fever subsided 
last night itself.

892
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,290
Also Adi.. Dad had called.

893
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:02,370
He said he's buying a property.

894
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,910
Apparently he wants my 
signature for a document..

895
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:07,290
...and asked me to leave 
for Mumbai right away.

896
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,660
Do you really have to go? 
- Yeah.

897
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,580
It's 6:45 now.

898
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:27,790
There's a train to Mumbai 
at 8:30. You can take that.

899
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:30,750
Okay. I'll get ready then.

900
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,540
I wish to spend all 
my life with you.

901
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,750
I love you.

902
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,290
Bro?

903
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:00,580
Hey Adi! 
When did you come?

904
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,040
It's been twenty eight years.

905
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,120
Are you doing well? 
- I'm good.

906
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,620
This is Dia. My friend.

907
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:12,040
Had to go the railway station. 
- Sure. Get in.

908
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,330
Keep this safely with you.

909
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,290
Take your tablet after 
lunch without fail.

910
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,370
I told you that my fever subsided, right? 
- Take it anyways.

911
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,250
Since you're traveling, 
the fever might relapse.

912
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,450
If I put you through 
any trouble, I'm sorry.

913
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,500
Do you wish to go to 
Mumbai with broken teeth?

914
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:17,700
It’s time to finally bid 
goodbye once and for all.

915
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,290
All good things 
must come to an end.

916
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,500
Why are you thanking me? 
It's free!

917
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,750
The next time we meet, 
I think it'll be in Mumbai.

918
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,250
Or we can meet in Bengaluru too.

919
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,790
Or somewhere in between? 
In this very town?

920
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:33,790
During your marriage? 
- I've decided that I'll never marry.

921
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:35,160
You're insulting me now.

922
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,120
You clearly have no doctorate in love! 
Leave!

923
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:51,750
You're insulting me now. 
- You're insulting me now!

924
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,040
You clearly have no doctorate in love! 
- I've a doctorate in Love.

925
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,370
Insult? How? 
- What else?

926
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:02,950
When a guy like me is 
right in front of you?

927
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,790
How did you decide 
that you won't marry?

928
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,040
Adi, please!

929
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,910
Don't joke about this

930
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,500
You're insulting me now!

931
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:13,200
Madam claims to find out if 
someone's in love in fifteen minutes.

932
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:18,000
I can! Well, you know that 
I've a doctorate in Love.

933
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,790
You clearly have no 
doctorate in love!

934
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:27,290
*MUFFLED FLASHES FROM THE PAST*

935
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:31,080
Finally! I feel so elated..

936
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:37,160
As elated as a man with diarrhoea would 
feel when he finds a bathroom in time.

937
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:45,160
I'm not able to breathe!

938
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:56,540
Phew! This was not my fault. 
I didn't propose to you.

939
01:37:56,870 --> 01:38:00,120
Neither is it my fault. 
Nor did I propose to you.

940
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,200
It's not the fault of either of us. 
All the blame is on love.

941
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,040
Can we hug for a little longer?

942
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:12,160
There's a lot of time 
before you get down.

943
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,750
It's free!

944
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,910
LAKKI!

945
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:42,330
MY DEAR LAKKI!

946
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:57,700
Hi Dia!

947
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:26,200
In Dia's case, there's 
nothing to worry.

948
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:30,120
There might be some minor 
injuries and fractures.

949
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:33,910
She might gain consciousness in 
two hours and then she'll be fine.

950
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,500
But in Rohit's case..

951
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:39,120
Doctor, what's wrong with Rohit?

952
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:43,120
When the accident occurred..

953
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,790
This portion of the brain 
was severely injured leading..

954
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:50,120
...to internal bleeding which in 
turn has resulted in a blood clot.

955
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:54,080
Right now! He's in a vegetative state.

956
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:59,040
It can also be considered 
that he is brain dead!

957
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,910
In this state, the patient 
has no consciousness.

958
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:07,160
Oxygen and energy will 
have to be provided..

959
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,160
...externally to 
keep his life going.

960
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:14,040
Doctor? He'll get cured and 
return to normalcy, right?

961
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,330
Let me be frank with you.

962
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:25,160
In cases like his we can never 
assure when he'll return to normalcy.

963
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:30,660
It might take three 
months or six months..

964
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:35,120
Or he might spend the rest 
of his life on the bed.

965
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,000
I'm sorry about that.

966
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,250
They're taking Rohit to 
Singapore for better treatment.

967
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,080
Damn it!

968
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,450
What are you thinking?

969
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:59,410
What will you tell Dia once she 
regains her senses and asks for Rohit?

970
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:00,580
What else?

971
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:03,700
We'll tell her that Rohit was taken 
to Singapore for better treatment.

972
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:05,450
Let's not do that.

973
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,580
Dia should never learn about this.

974
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,290
What are you saying?

975
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:15,160
Let's tell her that Rohit 
died in the accident.

976
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,200
Yes.

977
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:21,370
I've given it a lot of thought.

978
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:26,040
We both know how 
madly Dia loves Rohit.

979
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,040
If she learns the truth..

980
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:33,790
She'll spend all her life waiting 
and hoping for Rohit to return.

981
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:39,660
And there's no guarantee to know 
whether Rohit will recover for sure.

982
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,700
What if he never recovers?

983
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:49,080
Lying to her might hurt 
her for a few days..

984
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,080
As time goes by, 
she'll forget Rohit.

985
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:58,540
Let us convince her later and 
get her married to a good guy.

986
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:04,040
By the grace of God, if Rohit recovers, 
let's get him married to Dia.

987
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:09,040
Seems like you're very lucky.

988
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,700
So only God has blessed 
you with what you wanted.

989
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,700
And now..

990
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,790
Look how Rohit has come back 
with a new lease of life.

991
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:26,040
Dia, to make sure that your 
future was safe and good.

992
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,700
Your dad took that call.

993
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,290
If at all you think he's wrong..

994
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:34,160
Forgive him.

995
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,250
Go take a short walk.

996
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:42,000
By the time you return, 
we'll decide on the wedding.

997
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,080
Go on.

998
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,410
How are you Dia?

999
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,330
How did you manage 
thinking I was dead?

1000
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:15,750
Did you try to forget me?

1001
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:18,160
Or have you already 
forgotten me?

1002
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:22,830
If your answer is yes..

1003
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,040
Everything you thought all 
these days will come true.

1004
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:38,120
But I know that you 
would never forgot me.

1005
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,450
Hello Drama Queen!

1006
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,700
Your phone was switched 
off all this while!

1007
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:11,950
Do you know how many 
times I tried calling you?

1008
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:14,910
Try switching off your phone again.

1009
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:19,120
I'll come down to Mumbai, murder 
you and get jailed for it.

1010
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:23,830
Go ahead and do it. 
I'll be thankful to you!

1011
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:27,700
Are you crying?

1012
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,500
What happened?

1013
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:39,500
Did your father scold you?

1014
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,450
He didn't.

1015
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,080
Then what happened?

1016
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:50,500
Tell me what happened. 
I'm can't take the silence.

1017
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:53,330
Adi.

1018
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,200
The thing is..

1019
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,540
Rohit..

1020
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,950
Life is indeed full of 
surprises and miracles.

1021
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:23,200
So what have you decided to do?

1022
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,580
I'm sorry!

1023
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:29,080
It was I who told you to call the customer 
care in case of any inconvenience, right?

1024
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,290
Give me five minutes. 
I will call you back.

1025
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,080
Hello? 
- No Dia!

1026
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:07,870
I can't even imagine 
a life without you.

1027
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,040
I lost my mind just because 
your phone was switched off.

1028
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:15,450
And to let you go forever..? No.

1029
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,830
Here's what I'll do. I'll pack my 
stuff and head to Mumbai right now.

1030
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:24,620
I'll come over and tell Rohit about us..

1031
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,950
And bring you back with me.

1032
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:30,830
Let's go to Karwar and get married. 
Okay?

1033
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,040
Be ready for everything.

1034
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:43,370
I really wish I could tell you 
all of this and do as I said.

1035
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:46,620
But if I do this very thing..

1036
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:52,540
'My son turned so selfish. 
I didn't bring him up well.'

1037
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:55,830
These will be the words of my mother, 
who will regret it all her life.

1038
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:00,330
That will hurt me more than 
the pain of losing you.

1039
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:02,700
I don't want that.

1040
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,080
Now listen to me carefully.

1041
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,040
Don't worry about me at all.

1042
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:13,620
Don't even think of feeling 
guilty that you cheated Adi.

1043
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:16,870
You get married 
to Rohit happily!

1044
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:20,330
Just thinking of him 
makes me feel for him.

1045
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,450
I shouldn't do injustice to him.

1046
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:30,620
So.. I hope you get married to 
Rohit and lead a happy life.

1047
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:35,330
Also, I need a help from you.

1048
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:40,000
Will you please remove this 
SIM card from your mobile?

1049
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:42,120
Don't ever use it again!

1050
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,660
Does this mean that this is 
the last time we're talking?

1051
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:48,200
It's not as if our conversation 
will bring world peace.

1052
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:50,370
Please remove the SIM.

1053
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,200
I wish you all the best.

1054
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,660
Have a great life.

1055
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:15,870
I can still hear you breathe.

1056
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:17,830
Ms. Dia Soup.

1057
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:51,830
Adi?

1058
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:54,370
Adi!

1059
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:06,700
How are you Lakki?

1060
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:17,830
It's been so long since 
all of this happened,..

1061
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:20,000
...yet you never thought 
of telling me, right?

1062
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,410
Lakki, isn't it better to let dust 
get only one eye instead of two?

1063
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:31,500
Why should you also suffer over here, 
while I struggle back home?

1064
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:35,040
Why suffer together as 
if it's a clearance sale?

1065
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,950
I thought I could forget her easily.

1066
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:40,750
But.. 
- But you're not able to.

1067
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:48,500
Let it go. Now that you're here. 
Things will get better.

1068
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,830
I'm very proud to 
call you as my son.

1069
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,330
Proud!

1070
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,120
Why though?

1071
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,500
Because you told Dia to 
forget you and marry Rohit.

1072
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,200
That's why.

1073
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:10,080
I blurted it out to 
her at that moment.

1074
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,160
Do you know how I 
felt after saying it?

1075
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:20,370
It felt as if thousand men 
stabbed me all over.

1076
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,540
Seems love is the root cause 
of both excessive happiness..

1077
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:29,870
...and extreme pain for a human.

1078
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:37,500
What can I say? You 
know everything.

1079
01:52:37,830 --> 01:52:41,330
Come home when you feel like it.

1080
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,750
I'll be waiting.

1081
01:52:58,870 --> 01:53:02,040
Hello brother? This 
is Smitha here.

1082
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:04,370
Dia's cousin. Remember?

1083
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:05,750
I do.

1084
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,660
Yeah. So? 
Hope you're doing well.

1085
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,620
How well do you think a 
Piles patient can be doing?

1086
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:18,870
Dia was right. You are funny.

1087
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:23,160
The reason I called you now is..

1088
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:25,830
...to ask you to join us. 
We're heading to Mumbai today..

1089
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:27,910
...evening. The bus 
is also pretty empty.

1090
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:29,910
Let's have a nice 
chat on our way.

1091
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:32,910
To Mumbai? For what?

1092
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:34,330
What sort of question is that?

1093
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:36,290
The day after's Dia's wedding. 
Remember?

1094
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:39,870
Dia's getting married?

1095
01:53:39,870 --> 01:53:44,120
Yeah. Actually the wedding's day after. 
Tomorrow night is the reception ceremony.

1096
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:47,620
But Dia told me that she's 
already told you about it.

1097
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,370
Looks like you forgot.

1098
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:52,500
No. I was just kidding.

1099
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,660
I'm in Karwar right now.

1100
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,910
Can you text me the venue 
details of the wedding?

1101
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:01,950
Sure. I will. 
Be there at any cost.

1102
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,830
Because they both are 
returning to Singapore..

1103
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:05,910
...right on the day 
after their wedding.

1104
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,250
You better not miss it.

1105
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:21,620
Adi. I have a plan. Let's go 
out on a short trip tomorrow.

1106
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:24,540
Guess where we're going? 
To Dandeli!

1107
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,040
What say?

1108
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:29,370
Tomorrow I'm going to Mumbai.

1109
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:32,790
Mumbai? But why?

1110
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,950
Tomorrow night's 
Dia's reception.

1111
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:36,910
The wedding's day after.

1112
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:38,450
I thought of going and..

1113
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,580
Don't forget to join the 
luncheon with their family.

1114
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:42,700
Anyways you love 
meat in your food.

1115
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:45,330
Lakki, she's leaving to 
Singapore after her marriage.

1116
01:54:45,370 --> 01:54:46,410
So?

1117
01:54:46,450 --> 01:54:49,660
So.. I thought of seeing 
her for one last time.

1118
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,450
Adi, this is an excuse.

1119
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:53,950
You're not accepting 
the reality.

1120
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:57,330
You're still hoping that 
Dia will become yours.

1121
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:59,870
Put that out of your 
mind right away!

1122
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,870
It's all over!

1123
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,790
Fine. If at all Dia sees 
you at the reception..

1124
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:15,000
Have you thought how 
awakward she would feel?

1125
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:18,290
I told you that I'll 
only see her and return.

1126
01:55:18,410 --> 01:55:20,000
Not that I will meet her.

1127
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,290
But still, don't go.

1128
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,660
You'll be hurt if you go 
there and see all of that.

1129
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:25,950
Don't!

1130
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,790
If it's meant to, 
let that happen too.

1131
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,450
I'll become a stronger 
person, mentally.

1132
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:30,580
Enough of you being strong.

1133
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:34,290
If you're out there 
witnessing that, it'll feel..

1134
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:36,910
...as if thousand persons 
are stabbing me with knives.

1135
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:42,040
Be it joy or grief, it's not just you 
who experiences it. You know that, right?

1136
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:44,580
You're not going. 
That is it.

1137
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:45,830
Get some sleep.

1138
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:50,830
From now on, Dia's topic should 
never ever come up between us.

1139
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:53,000
Good night.

1140
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:28,700
I'm sorry dear.

1141
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:33,000
For the first time ever, I'm asking 
you not to do something you wanted to.

1142
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,450
This is for our good.

1143
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,450
Adi wake up! It's time.

1144
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,370
Adi?

1145
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:10,540
Hello Adi, where are you? 
- I'm sorry Lakki.

1146
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:14,500
For the first time ever I'm 
going against your words.

1147
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:17,830
I'm going to Mumbai. Bye.

1148
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:19,580
Adi!

1149
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,580
Hello? Adi?

1150
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:05,160
Idiot. I'm in Mumbai. 
I told you, right?

1151
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,830
Oh! Brother. When 
did you come down?

1152
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,620
And what are you wearing?

1153
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,660
I never thought that 
I would meet you.

1154
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,120
Nothing. 
- Okay.

1155
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:20,620
Did you meet Dia?

1156
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:25,080
Not yet. I'll meet her later. 
It's a bit crowded now.

1157
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:28,160
So what? We've 
come from far away.

1158
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:31,370
They should give importance to us 
over others. Let's go talk to her.

1159
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:33,950
Let's do it later! 
- It's okay, brother.

1160
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:35,700
Smitha! Let's not do this!

1161
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:23,000
You both look good together. 
You both are made for each other.

1162
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:26,540
Thank you.

1163
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:28,620
Sir! How about a picture?

1164
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,200
Once again wish 
you all the best.

1165
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,700
Thank you! Please 
have your dinner.

1166
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,830
Definitely.

1167
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,290
It's been days since 
I had a proper meal.

1168
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:23,250
Do you know him?

1169
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:42,290
We're done right? How much 
longer do we have to be here?

1170
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:44,000
We'll be done in 
another fifteen minutes.

1171
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,620
Harish uncle and 
family are on the way.

1172
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:47,450
There's a traffic jam apparently.

1173
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:48,870
Until then you may..

1174
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:52,080
Look how dull she looks. 
Cheer her up!

1175
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:53,830
Geetha? 
- I'm coming.

1176
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:55,830
Keep her engaged. 
I'll be back.

1177
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,830
If any one of us wish to 
say 'I love you' to each other..

1178
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:15,120
I.. Love.. You..!

1179
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:17,080
We need to press each 
other's hand thrice.

1180
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:35,290
I.. Love.. You..!

1181
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:49,750
You know how to reply, right

1182
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:22,580
I never should've recovered.

1183
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:25,950
All three of us would 
have lived peacefully.

1184
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,330
You went to end your life 
because I was no more.

1185
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,330
But he's given you 
a new lease of life.

1186
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:42,910
He's even taught you 
to live without me.

1187
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:49,080
If you unite with me, you'll 
only continue to live your life.

1188
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:53,950
But with him, you'll 
enjoy your life.

1189
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:57,040
So..

1190
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,000
This is for your own good.

1191
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,120
It's hurting just to say it.

1192
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:09,500
Go!

1193
02:04:16,330 --> 02:04:19,450
Instead of the both of 
you suffering because of me..

1194
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:23,540
It's better that I suffer 
for the both of you, right?

1195
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:27,830
Please go!

1196
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:32,870
I shall return to 
Singapore by myself again.

1197
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:32,950
How are you?

1198
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,330
Is Adi inside?

1199
02:05:36,910 --> 02:05:38,370
Don't you know what happened?

1200
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:40,370
What is it?

1201
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:44,200
She suffered a massive 
cardiac arrest.

1202
02:06:44,450 --> 02:06:47,750
If only someone was home, there 
were chances of her surviving.

1203
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:50,910
Unfortunately, 
no one was around.

1204
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:53,870
Nanjamma too was out of the town.

1205
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:56,620
We constantly tried reaching you.

1206
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,870
But your phone was switched off.

1207
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:04,330
Can you tell everyone to 
go out for five minutes?

1208
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:50,700
Do you know why I always 
call you as Lakki?

1209
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:58,410
Every time I call you as 
Lakki,..

1210
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:05,750
I constantly remind myself how lucky 
I am to have been born as your son.

1211
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:11,080
Thank you Lakki!

1212
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:15,080
Thank you for being my mother!

1213
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:34,120
I shouldn't have.. 
left you!

1214
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:37,200
You told me not to..

1215
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,790
I don't like it when you buy things.

1216
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:52,950
But I love buying things for you.

1217
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:00,080
If you're out there 
witnessing that, it'll feel..

1218
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:02,540
...as if thousand persons are 
stabbing me with knives.

1219
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:11,410
If only someone was home, there 
were chances of her surviving.

1220
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,290
Adi? Where is he?

1221
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:37,370
Mother?

1222
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,870
Oh! Shankara?

1223
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:41,910
Are you done with Lakshmi madam's 
organ donation formalities?

1224
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:44,540
Yes. It's all done.

1225
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:47,040
And Adi? Is he still here?

1226
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,330
No. He left after finishing 
all the procedures.

1227
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:52,410
He left?

1228
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,330
Do you know where he went? 
- No idea. He didn't tell me anything.

1229
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:29,910
ADI!

1230
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,750
Did you come across 
my friend, Adi?

1231
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:01,750
Adi who?

1232
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:03,700
Our Doctor madam's son?

1233
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,450
The one I introduced 
you to, at the hospital.

1234
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:09,450
Oh him! I'd forgotten his name.

1235
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,450
Yeah! I did see him.

1236
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:13,750
You did?

1237
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,660
Where was it?

1238
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:33,250
God!

1239
02:11:33,790 --> 02:11:36,200
I became responsible 
for my mother's death.

1240
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:39,120
She taught me everything.

1241
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:42,660
But not how to live without her.

1242
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:49,500
I want peace!

1243
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:51,450
Everlasting peace!

1244
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,580
I think I'll get it only if..

1245
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:18,200
In the end, I pray 
for only one thing.

1246
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:23,040
Make sure that Dia's 
always happy and peaceful.

1247
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:42,120
Adi!

1248
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,200
Dia?
