3
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,949
What if this stone had hit me?

4
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:51,789
How would it have hit you?
I am not an amateur.

5
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,216
I am a proper hunter.

6
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,229
I've just come back after aiming
correctly at four sparrows.

7
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:03,029
- If I had known this earlier, I would never have met you.
- Why?

8
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:07,389
These innocent birds
haven't hurt anybody.

9
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:09,298
If you have such a
penchant for hunting..

10
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,568
Then hunt a man-eating lion.

11
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:15,789
- Shed the blood of a cheetah.
- Is it so?

12
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:19,029
Then I will kill a lion and
bring it to you, tomorrow itself.

13
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,149
That will be seen later.
Come here, first.

14
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,569
Take a vow of Lord Hanuman..

15
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,789
That you won't lift your gun
on innocent birds ever again.

16
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:32,869
This is good. You give orders
as if you are a school master.

17
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:36,549
- Will you not take the vow?
- I'll. I'll.

18
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,312
Hail Bajrangbali.
I wonder what magic has been..

19
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:42,704
Done by this girl that..

20
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:44,549
I can't disagree
to whatever she says.

21
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:49,488
In front of you, I take a vow,
that today onwards my gun..

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,353
Will not be aimed at any bird.

23
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,057
What's this? You
have forgotten the vow..

24
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,497
As soon as you took up the vow?

25
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,782
Oh. It was a very fresh promise.
Therefore I forgot it.

26
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:08,862
"If you come, then this
heart will find some peace."

27
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:23,655
"If there is a breeze in the garden,
spring will come."

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,862
Did you listen to this song?

29
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,982
Do you think that I am deaf?

30
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,702
- I hear this song everyday.
- Even I hear this song everyday.

31
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,462
But which man sings this song?

32
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:41,622
It's not a he, but a she.
Come, come here.

33
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,302
Do you see that bungalow
on that mountain in front?

34
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,142
The song is heard from there.

35
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:54,289
It's a very beautiful house.

36
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:57,142
Bhola, when you grow up
you build such a house too.

37
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,142
A better house than
this can be built.

38
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,542
But will you stay in that?

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,982
Is that a question to be asked?
If I don't stay..

40
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,982
Then who will make food for you?

41
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,142
Who will look after you?

42
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,062
Hey, will you do all this for me?

43
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,982
Not only this, even if
I am banished with you..

44
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,782
I shall go, just like Sita.

45
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:20,862
No. What if a Ravan is
met during the banishment?

46
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:24,302
My house is the best
for me. Come with me.

47
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,542
- Where?
- There, to hear the song.

48
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:29,302
I've heard the song so many
times that I have it memorised.

49
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:31,862
- Is it so? Please sing it.
- No, I won't.

50
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:33,142
You won't sing it?

51
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,222
- If you catch me, then I will sing it.
- Okay.

52
00:03:55,748 --> 00:04:01,542
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

53
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:07,982
"That everyone is
close to their beloved."

54
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:14,057
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

55
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,906
"The shores stay away from them."

56
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:40,770
"No boatman helps
them cross the river."

57
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:47,090
"The shores stay away from them."

58
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:52,942
"No boatman helps
them cross the river."

59
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,410
"If the boatman is along,
then the shore is close too.'

60
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:05,490
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

61
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:12,010
"That everyone is
close to their beloved."

62
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,912
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

63
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:36,774
"Even if some puts
off all the lights.."

64
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,697
"love goes on putting
stars in the journey.'

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,838
"Even if some puts
off all the lights.."

66
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:54,858
"love goes on putting
stars in the journey."

67
00:05:55,368 --> 00:06:01,010
"The story of this
crazy love is strange too."

68
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:07,090
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

69
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:13,314
"That everyone is
close to their beloved."

70
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:19,250
"Everyone isn't lucky
in this world."

71
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:27,963
Take this, sir.
I made an exact Om on your hand..

72
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:31,390
As it is on his hand.
Be confident now.

73
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,604
Your friendship will
is very strong now.

74
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,570
Oh, thank you, thank you.

75
00:06:36,173 --> 00:06:40,126
Bhavariya, come. Let us get
our names written as a token.

76
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:41,506
Do you think that
your name is so great..

77
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,595
That I should get it written?

78
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,850
Bhola, people will
think that it is some bear.

79
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,010
Do you think that your
name is great, Bhavariya?

80
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,650
People will that it is a monkey.

81
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,170
I am to be named yet.

82
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:56,770
I'm called Bhavariya
with love by my mother.

83
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,250
Forget all these names,
children. Look here.

84
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,850
There are so many
things to be written.

85
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,570
Elephants, horses,
a lion or a cheetah.

86
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,010
Should I draw a custard apple,
or a papaya?

87
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:10,490
Make a Taj Mahal or
Goddess Kali of Kolkata.

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,850
Every picture is worth
two pennies, children..

89
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,770
Then draw this betel leaf.

90
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:20,650
This isn't a betel leaf.
This is a heart.

91
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,930
Heart? What is a heart?

92
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,850
What can I tell you what a heart is?

93
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:32,650
Ask some Romeo or some
Juliet or some lover.

94
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:37,650
And when you will grow up,
you will know it yourself.

95
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:52,770
Bhavariya!

96
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:56,570
- Daddy!
- Daddy! I've been searching for you since two hours.

97
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,850
And what is all this?

98
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:04,410
- Bhola!
- Bhola? Who are you?

99
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,850
Me? I'm a boy.

100
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:08,170
Even I can see that.
But whose kid are you?

101
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:11,250
- I am the son of my parents.
- You please keep quiet.

102
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,090
Had you come for this from house?

103
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,330
Please rub this off, Uncle.

104
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,770
Dear, forget me, even
God can't rub this off now.

105
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,170
Forget them, they were kids.

106
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,090
But you should have thought
about it. You are intelligent.

107
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,137
I am intelligent. But along
with that, I am a shopkeeper too.

108
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,570
You write something too.

109
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,640
Come. Come here.

110
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,588
Dear Bhola. We had to
leave all of a sudden.

111
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,495
Don't worry. I will meet
you again in the coming..

112
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:51,188
Summer vacations.
Yours Bhavariya.

113
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:19,948
- Bhola! Bhola! Bhola!
- Bhavariya! - Bhola!

114
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,588
Bhavariya.

115
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:24,788
- Bhola!
- Bhavariya.

116
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:22,087
Suresh! Brother Suresh!

117
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:26,087
Brother Suresh! Suresh!

118
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:42,875
Who is it?

119
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,407
Who is it?

120
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,647
Why are you knocking on the
door so early in the morning?

121
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,487
Who is it?

122
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,087
Who is it?

123
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,062
Wow, you brave man.
I face real lions..

124
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:17,214
And you shrieked
due to a dead lion?

125
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,814
What do you mean by a shriek?
I don't know why you did that.

126
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:21,694
Someone can even die
due to such jokes.

127
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,974
May our enemies die!
Now, it is time to hope..

128
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,750
But what kind of trouble did you
bring so early in the morning?

129
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,150
Don't say that
I brought some problem.

130
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:34,294
Say that I put an end
to an everyday hassle.

131
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:35,922
This is the same lion that had..

132
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,414
Created trouble
in the whole area.

133
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,894
You have started to
play with danger nowadays.

134
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,894
What if the lion had attacked you?

135
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:43,950
What's a better death, than dying..

136
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,774
While trying to
save someone's life?

137
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,974
What is this? You are
showing the sun a light.

138
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:53,694
And is this the way to keep books?

139
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:56,894
It seems that you study less
and make a show of it more.

140
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,555
Hey, why are you looking at this?

141
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,150
A person who hasn't even
seen the door of a college..

142
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,230
What is you relation with books?

143
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,286
So what if I am not
related to books?

144
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,510
I am related to you, isn't it?

145
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,270
Whether I have read or you
have read, it is one and the same.

146
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,310
- There is a difference.
- There is a difference of age.

147
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,710
Do you know? I am six months elder.

148
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,990
Why only in age?
You are greater than me..

149
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,510
In knowledge and
intelligence too.

150
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,310
But I think that your
greatness is my greatness.

151
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:33,990
People praise you, and I feel proud.

152
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,710
You pass, and I distribute sweets.

153
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,470
- Isn't it correct?
- Correct.

154
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,070
Tell me, sir,
where do you wish to go?

155
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,710
- Railway Tea Stall.
- Why?

156
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,630
In celebration of your great deed..

157
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,870
- I will buy you breakfast today.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,630
You study every hour. Leave
studying sometimes at least.

159
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,141
When someone starts chasing him..

160
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:10,870
Then he will give up studies, sir.

161
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,550
Wow. Wow. You have hit
the nail on the head.

162
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,611
Someone has rightly said..

163
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,990
That the life of a
man without a wife..

164
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,870
Is just like a night without
light and a curry without salt.

165
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,790
Just like sweetmeat without
sugar and Heer without Ranjha.

166
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,518
Just like sugarcane
without any juice, just..

167
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,790
Enough! Enough!

168
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:31,990
Your introduction?

169
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,990
Ask the introduction of
Raja Ram Mohan from those..

170
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,150
People in whose
balconies owls used to speak.

171
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,870
Today, the cuckoos are singing.

172
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:42,230
People who had their hair cut
with the razor of misfortune..

173
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,710
I tied the traditional head
dress of marriage on their heads.

174
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:48,990
Scissors. Razor? Are you a..

175
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,070
I once was.

176
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,990
Since the time you
people started using safety..

177
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,231
Since then, for our safety..

178
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:02,550
We people started
this business. Look.

179
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,890
Calculate to the point.
Till today, I'm responsible..

180
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,875
For the marriage
of 1178 couples..

181
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:12,990
And I have turned their
sighs into sighs of relief.

182
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,990
So, whose sigh have you come..

183
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,870
To change into a
sigh of relief here?

184
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,310
Whomsoever I meet in my journey.

185
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,790
Your name is Shankar and
your name is Suresh, isn't it?

186
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,990
- Yes, but..
- Aren't you the only..

187
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,179
Son of Diwan Jaswant Singh..

188
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,470
- And aren't you his only nephew?
- Yes, but..

189
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,990
You like to study and teach,
and you don't like shooting..

190
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,630
And singing, isn't it?

191
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,070
That's all right, but how
did you come to know that?

192
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,990
How does a CID come to know?

193
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,870
Just like that
even I came to know.

194
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,990
It is said, that before
God gives birth to a woman..

195
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,710
He gives birth to her groom.

196
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,723
But to unite the
woman and her groom..

197
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,310
God has given birth to me.

198
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,990
I have two exquisite rings for you..

199
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,870
Two rubies,
right now in my palms.

200
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,990
Please keep your palm closed.

201
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,550
- We don't want to wear any rings.
- Yes.

202
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,990
But you won't get this golden
chance again.

203
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,063
Nowadays the matters of marriage and
familial life are very risky.

204
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,710
Because while one is married,
he can't remarry.

205
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:09,070
That means, there is
only arrow in the bow.

206
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,630
If the aim is wrong,
then one goes on vacation.

207
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,310
It seems that you
already are on a vacation.

208
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:15,816
If it had been in this time..

209
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,286
Then maybe it
would have been possible.

210
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,150
But what can be said
about our times..

211
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,630
If one didn't get all the
advantages from one wife..

212
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,282
Then please search
for them in another.

213
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,582
That is, if one
doesn't get a whole rupee..

214
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:27,462
Then he could make
do with two fifty paisa.

215
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,710
- So, do you have a full rupee or..
- Two fifty paisa.

216
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,990
But you'll get a whole rupee.

217
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,070
Made of pure silver,
of Princesses time.

218
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,390
Please tinkle it and
then decide, deal?

219
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,870
Whether it is a deal or not
can be decided only by Diwan.

220
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,870
Please don't worry about it.

221
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,990
If Diwan would
have been unmarried..

222
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,790
Then I would have
readied even him for marriage.

223
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,300
Exactly, to the point.

224
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,870
Uncle has been thinking
about our marriage since long.

225
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,990
Therefore, I think that
this Mr. To-the-point..

226
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,869
Will certainly fix something up.

227
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,990
Therefore, it is better to
start thinking from now.

228
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,030
That if it is a girl,
how should she be.

229
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,790
What is the use of thinking,
Brother?

230
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:17,990
You took a cold sigh as..

231
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,309
If you have already
been fixed up somewhere.

232
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,630
Let me hear too,
what kind of thing is she?

233
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,456
Should I tell you?

234
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:28,630
Yes, tell me. When, where,
how and why did you meet her?

235
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,737
'Meeting me with kohl-lined eyes.."

236
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:49,390
"Some girl has made me restless."

237
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,180
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

238
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,348
"Meeting me with kohl-lined eyes.."

239
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:01,070
"Some girl has made me restless."

240
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,870
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

241
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:23,990
"The hair were kissing the lips.."

242
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:30,150
"It was a dark cloud,
it was dancing.'

243
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,258
"She was coming from the
river bank dancing like this.."

244
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:39,870
"Wavering, and torturing me."

245
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,870
"My heart sighed when she
looked at me with shy eyes."

246
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:51,550
"She won over my heart."

247
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,858
"Meeting me with kohl-lined eyes
some girl has made me restless."

248
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:03,310
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

249
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:22,990
"She is as fair as the moon,
she is so beautiful.."

250
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,956
"She made life and death
difficult for me.."

251
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:36,139
"In one glance my condition was such
that I became crazy, mad, and a moth.'

252
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,710
"I lost my senses,
I was made crazy.."

253
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,710
"By the chalice
of intoxication.'

254
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,070
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

255
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:56,230
"Meeting me with kohl-lined eyes
some girl has made me restless."

256
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,070
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

257
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,474
"Yesterday, in my dreams,
she had come."

258
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:25,697
"We both were alone there."

259
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:33,777
"Under her veil she was hiding,
shied, scared and smiling.'

260
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,411
"The whole night passed,
she did not understand.."

261
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:42,191
"The maters of my heart."

262
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,941
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

263
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:53,610
"Meeting me with kohl-lined eyes
some girl has made me restless."

264
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:58,897
"The anklet-wearing
one has looted me."

265
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
She was very simple!

266
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,656
That's great. I thought
that you always kept mum.

267
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,600
But you are a great singer.
Tell me, when did this all happen?

268
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:22,800
- 15 years go.
- 15 years ago?

269
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,040
She must have become old by now.

270
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,440
She's not old. She's young now.

271
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:33,360
- So, was she a kid then?
- I was a kid too, isn't it?

272
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,010
Was? You are still a kid.

273
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,200
That's all right.
But we want a good girl.

274
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,280
There isn't any dearth of girls,
Mother.

275
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,978
If the family is
one in thousands..

276
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:46,714
Then the girl is one in millions,
why millions..

277
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,800
She is one in a billion.

278
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,649
Features, intelligence,
education and talent..

279
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,600
She is good in
all of these things!

280
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,040
- That means, exactly to the point.
- Come, son, come.

281
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,561
We had thought that
you had already gone.

282
00:21:58,641 --> 00:22:00,680
How could I go
without the marriage token?

283
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:04,800
- Token, right now?
- Yes, and marriage in the next month.

284
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,200
It's not a matter to laugh at, Sir.

285
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,800
You get many people to meet fates..

286
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,800
But one is lucky to get
one who joins relations.

287
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,637
For this, one needs the secret
of intelligence and experience.

288
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:20,010
In my eyes, the retired
magistrate Thakur Mahendra..

289
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:23,707
Singh's daughter for Suresh..

290
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:29,767
And for Shankar
Gopinath lawyer's sister Madhumati..

291
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,887
These proposals are the
product of my experience.

292
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,418
Shanta is interested in
studies like Suresh, and..

293
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,905
Madhumati is simple
and sober like Shankar.

294
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,705
Now, please give me
the promise of marriage.

295
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:45,365
Please have some patience,
Mr. Ram Bharose.

296
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,600
Marriage is not a child's play.

297
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,256
Well, it is not the
play of old people too.

298
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
Even they are getting older.

299
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,440
Even then, let the boys and
girls see each other once.

300
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,960
What are you talking about?

301
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,440
Such a thing has never
taken place in our family.

302
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,880
You tell me, had I
seen you before marriage?

303
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,960
That was another era.

304
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,800
But if you don't want to
break this tradition..

305
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,307
Then let Sundar meet
Shankar's proposal..

306
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,040
And let Shankar
meet Sundar's proposal.

307
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,680
After all, both of them
know each other's likes.

308
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,800
You've said such a good thing..

309
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,360
When do we get them to meet?

310
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:22,200
- On Janmashtami (festival) day.
- What an auspicious day!

311
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,639
Please grant me leave, now.

312
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,800
Eat something before you leave.

313
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,280
If I sit to have something,
then I'll miss my train.

314
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:30,504
It's really a strange thing!

315
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:31,800
Despite my repeated refusals..

316
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,578
Thakur had forced me to accept..

317
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,800
Some money, saying, "Here, take.."

318
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,656
"This money, eat some
food while travelling."

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,680
- Here, take this from me, too.
- I didn't mean this.

320
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:45,200
But I can't insult you
by refusing your offer.

321
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,120
You have said it to the point.

322
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:55,680
- Well done, Sister. Good shot. Good shot.
- I'll beat you up.

323
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,360
- Very good. Very good.
- Hi, Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy!

324
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,040
The three brothers and
sisters are lost in games.

325
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
You should have called
your mother here too.

326
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,966
Mom won't come if we call her.
You call her please!

327
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Sir, do you wish to fail?
Get up and start studying.

328
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,301
And listen, till the examinations,
I should..

329
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,734
Always see a book in
your hands, otherwise..

330
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:23,680
Otherwise, you will see
a cane in daddy's hands.

331
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Daddy, did you get the set
of Charles Dicken's novels?

332
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,280
- That is out of stock. But Shanta..
- Yes.

333
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Don't you tire of
reading these novels..

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,600
And detective stories
the whole day?

335
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,485
Daddy. By reading novels,
one's tiredness is washed away..

336
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,200
And time passes nicely too.

337
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,680
Okay, so now for time pass,
you read these books.

338
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,680
Thank you, Daddy.

339
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:54,600
Hey, what is this? 'The Indian Woman.
Culinary Skills.'

340
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
'The Science of Homemaking.'

341
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,600
Daddy, what senseless
books have you just picked up?

342
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,520
Who told you to bring these books?

343
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,600
- I had told to bring these books here.
- But why?

344
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,256
Because, nowadays, talks about..

345
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
Your marriage proposal
are going on.

346
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
The boy will come to see
you in a couple of days.

347
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,120
What if he asks you some
question about homemaking?

348
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,680
Will he be taking my examination?
I don't like it.

349
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,200
I will never answer
such foolish queries.

350
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,800
- Then what kind of questions will you answer, Sister?
- Shut up.

351
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,960
What happened? What storm
has this Tommy invoked outside?

352
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,040
Tommy, Tommy!

353
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,040
- Tommy! - Very good Tommy, very good.
- Be quiet, Munni! Tommy, come here!

354
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,040
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

355
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,800
Shanta, take him away from here.

356
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,360
- He has become a rogue.
- That's not the matter, Daddy.

357
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,680
Actually, Tommy hates
this illiterate man.

358
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Okay. I think that
there is a BA degree..

359
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,200
Hanging from Tommy's collar.

360
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
He is a undergraduate, isn't he?

361
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:04,440
Go, Munni, you go too. Sir
Ram Bharose, please sit.

362
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,600
I was waiting for you. Tell me,
what news have you brought?

363
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,856
What can I tell you sir?
Do you know..

364
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
What I saw there
when I reached there?

365
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,280
That they had already talked
about the boy with another party.

366
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,520
- Then?
- Then? But your family and Raja Ram Bharose's words, that's it.

367
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,118
I have made them
send the first party..

368
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:23,262
And have stopped the boy.

369
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,680
So, when is the boy coming here?

370
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,200
The boy isn't coming.

371
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,600
But his brother Shankar
is coming to see Shanta.

372
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,800
But I had told that
if they had seen each other..

373
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,200
Then it would
have been all right.

374
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,680
- That's where I could meet the point to the point.
- Why?

375
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,360
Actually, the thing is that
the Diwan is a very orthodox man.

376
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,936
And then, there is no difference..

377
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,096
Between Shankar and Suraj.

378
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,440
Both understand each other's
likes and dislikes quite well.

379
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,800
And now, the point of
Shanta meeting Suraj..

380
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,440
Please leave that to me.

381
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,695
I'll call Suresh here
on any pretext..

382
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,800
And I'll connect that
point to the point too.

383
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,360
- Okay, I will go now.
- Please have something and go.

384
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,800
If I sit to eat, then I won't be
able to board the train.

385
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,960
That's strange, this
had happened there too.

386
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,943
Even though I said no many times..

387
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:09,120
The Diwan put the
money for meals in my pocket.

388
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,429
He said, have your
meals in the train itself.

389
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,000
Okay then, here is money
from our side for the meals.

390
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,680
No, I didn't mean that,
but how can I insult sir.

391
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:27,263
Brother, I've never
heard nor seen such a thing.

392
00:27:27,343 --> 00:27:29,111
That you go to select a girl for me..

393
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,671
And I go to select a girl for you.

394
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:34,128
Is it necessary, that you
will like the girl that I like too?

395
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:35,328
Why not?

396
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:38,748
In fact, if you ask me,
I have more faith in your selection.

397
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,933
- How is that?
- Because I would see only the girl's face..

398
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,798
You would consider
her intelligence too.

399
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:46,822
You are unfortunate.
For an MA like you..

400
00:27:46,902 --> 00:27:48,822
A failed one goes
to select the girl.

401
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,542
Suresh, which test will
I put her on?

402
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,982
- I have brought the test in my pocket.
- In your pocket.

403
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:58,885
You'll take the
decision of the face as it is.

404
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,983
This will decide
about intelligence.

405
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:03,623
Ask her answers to
these questions. Here.

406
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,623
Should I read it? Don't worry.
It has been written in Hindi.

407
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:13,703
- What are your thoughts about Taini Saan?
- Taini Saan?

408
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:18,703
It's not Taini Saan, it's Tennyson.
He is an English poet.

409
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:23,479
He's a poet? Why don't
you ask a Indian girl..

410
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,463
About our Bheem and Tansen?

411
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:29,463
Listen, crack jokes afterwards,
first remember these questions.

412
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:32,258
I will remember them. But tell me..

413
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,177
If she asks me some
question how will I answer?

414
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,427
- This is a point..
- ..to the point.

415
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:43,698
Look, I will teach you a
single answer to hundred questions.

416
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:45,674
How will a single answer
a hundred questions suffice?

417
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:47,258
What else can she ask you?

418
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:49,314
She'll ask you which
writers do you like the most.

419
00:28:49,338 --> 00:28:51,338
Hilton, Milton, Kalidas or Surdas.

420
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:54,281
She will ask you which
rhythm do you like..

421
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,104
Which philosopher do you like..

422
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:57,624
And which philosophy do you like?

423
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,698
There is just one answer
to all of these questions.

424
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:00,584
Just one answer?

425
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:04,994
Yes. You tell her, "There are
many flowers in the garden.."

426
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:08,778
"Every flower has it's own
colour and it's own aroma."

427
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:12,838
There are many flowers in the
garden, every flower has it's..

428
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,498
Own colour and it's own aroma.

429
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,947
Excellent, Suresh.
If you'd given me..

430
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:21,418
This cure before,
then I would have passed BA.

431
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,098
Don't waste your time,
do some rehearsal.

432
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:24,858
Think that I am the girl,
now ask me..

433
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:26,258
One of these questions.

434
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:27,458
Wait, I'll ask.

435
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:39,418
So, you must have read Munshi
Premchand's works, isn't it?

436
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,418
What do you think about him?

437
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,698
Munshi, Munshi Premchand..

438
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:48,578
Actually, I've read a couple of
his stories in English.

439
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:51,254
He writes nicely.
He is a good writer.

440
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:53,038
You are right.

441
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,970
Do you have any interest
in politics?

442
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:00,735
Politax? Is this some new
tax levied by the Government?

443
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:03,741
- I don't have any interest in Politics.
- No.

444
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:09,476
From Mopasa's famous stories,
do you like 'Necklace?'

445
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:11,556
Or 'Forbidden Fruit?'

446
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:16,172
Yes, which fruit do you like?
I like bananas very much.

447
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:19,316
Ram Bharose, keep your
mouth shut for some time.

448
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:24,556
There is something special
in every of Mopasa's novel.

449
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,556
But I think that
'Necklace' is his masterpiece.

450
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,491
Excellent. I think so to.

451
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:35,236
Okay, which of Shakespeare's
drama do you like the most?

452
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:38,556
I like 'As you like it' very much.

453
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:42,756
I like comedy
stories than serious ones.

454
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,676
Which drama do you like?

455
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,076
I..

456
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,316
Why did you smile?

457
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,996
I mean, the thing is like that.

458
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:58,396
I mean, there are many
kinds of flowers in the garden.

459
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,676
Every flower has its own
aroma and its own colour.

460
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,076
Very good, Diwan. You've
given a to-the-point answer.

461
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,396
It is a very good sherbet.

462
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:18,856
Where do you bring this from?

463
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,896
Madhu has prepared
it with her own hands.

464
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,616
Not only sherbet, Madhu
makes everything to the point.

465
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:26,816
Now, in some time,
food will arrive for us.

466
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,296
You will forget this sherbet too.

467
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,256
And then, which talent
does Madhumati not have?

468
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,550
If you ask me, then Madhumati
is Parvati incarnate for our Shankar.

469
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,203
- What do you say, sir, aren't I right?
- What can I say in this?

470
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,592
I will call her.

471
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,428
Bhavariya, hey Bhavariya!

472
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:49,273
Why are you calling her Bhavariya..

473
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:51,022
What will that boy
think if he hears it?

474
00:31:51,046 --> 00:31:53,273
She is not a kid any longer.
Call her Madhu now.

475
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,353
Mother, she is still a child for us.

476
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:57,353
Come fast, they are waiting.

477
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:58,753
Come on, dear.

478
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:03,833
Social workers don't take
birth every other day. Mr. Suresh.

479
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,273
Therefore, I think..

480
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:09,073
That how much ever the public takes
advantage of me is less.

481
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:10,553
Undoubtedly.

482
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:16,913
Yes. So, please introduce me
to all your unmarried friends.

483
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:19,513
I will make their
lives blessed to the point.

484
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:38,741
Dear, please show your face.

485
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,061
She is very shy.

486
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,821
Even this is a talent.

487
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:47,261
At least greet him, dear.

488
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:51,261
Greetings.

489
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:57,061
Beauty and only beauty.

490
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:03,061
Spring and only spring!

491
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,181
What can be said!

492
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:11,581
Mr. Suresh, where are you?
Please say something.

493
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,461
What's your name?

494
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:17,860
Wow! Did you think that
Madhumati was my name?

495
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:25,181
I think that you must surely have
read the 'Ramayana (holy epic)?'

496
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,741
Yes.

497
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:34,951
Who do you like the most
in Ramayana?

498
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:40,501
Rama.

499
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:44,926
Rama? But Rama had
banished Sita even after..

500
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,421
Putting her
through the test of fire.

501
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:50,181
You like Rama even then?

502
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:57,428
Everybody accepts that Rama
loved Sita more than his own life.

503
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,574
Now, you decide, how much sorrow..

504
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,661
He must have felt
while banishing her.

505
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:11,373
Even then, he kept his
duty above his emotions.

506
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:18,061
Now, you tell me, is there
anyone greater than Rama?

507
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:19,892
Of course, Hanuman.

508
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,741
Yes. He was great in his own way.

509
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,180
In the manner that
you've praised Rama..

510
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,420
That can't be complimented.

511
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:35,181
Even then, I like Sita.

512
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,340
Madhu is just like Sita, too.

513
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,953
The only difference is that
one will not have to break..

514
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,581
Any bow to achieve her.

515
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:54,237
The only difference is that
one will not have to break..

516
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,181
Any bow to achieve her.

517
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,421
The bow will have to
broken to achieve Sita.

518
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,661
I will break the bow.

519
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,181
I will break it at any cost!

520
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:16,901
With the strength of my pen.
Just two letters.

521
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:22,929
One against Shankar,
and one against me.

522
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:32,669
Mr. Gopinath, Greetings.

523
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,508
I've heard that..

524
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,914
You are thinking about
marrying your sister..

525
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:46,184
Diwan Jaswant Rai's son Shankar..

526
00:35:48,442 --> 00:35:51,218
But according to me..

527
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:54,217
This is just like putting
a pearl necklace on a monkey's neck.

528
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,136
I know Shankar very well.

529
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:02,215
He is a drunkard,
gambler and very bad.

530
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:07,664
Whatever vices a rich man's son
can have, are present in him.

531
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,005
I have done my duty.
It is your decision now.

532
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,237
Yours truthfully,
your indebted person.

533
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,861
Mr. Mahendra Singh, greetings.

534
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,981
Suresh! You have won the battle.
This is called fate.

535
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,193
You must surely have donated
pearls in your previous birth..

536
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:44,301
That you are getting such a
jewel of a girl in this birth.

537
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:47,142
It's as if, that an angel has
come down from Indra's lair.

538
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:49,461
When she speaks, flowers
utter out of her mouth.

539
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:53,263
I swear, she answered
your questions so nicely..

540
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,701
I was speechless.

541
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,061
And while she was talking,
she asked me a question too.

542
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,541
I started sweating.

543
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:05,728
The result is that, your
to be wife is to the point.

544
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,541
What's this? I had thought that
you would be bouncing with joy!

545
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,301
But you are so glum!

546
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,141
The matter is such.

547
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:24,621
Actually, I've not
brought any good news for you.

548
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:29,781
The girl is not
worthy of you in any way.

549
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,861
But I've heard that
she is very beautiful.

550
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,301
Like that, even a mud
statue is beautiful.

551
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,822
But there should be
some other talent too.

552
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:41,381
Well, even I'm a common man.
What special talents do I have?

553
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:44,781
You are the person who has talents.
She's all right for me.

554
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:45,981
Is she bad in any way?

555
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,461
But she isn't good in any way too.

556
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,981
It is very good that she
doesn't have any bad habits.

557
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,861
After all, it is the
parent's wish too.

558
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,221
How can I make you understand?

559
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,987
I can understand it very well.

560
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:59,056
You are testing her on your test and
she hasn't passed it.

561
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:00,764
But I have no problem.

562
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,640
Now, lift this pen and
write the name of the invitees.

563
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:04,981
What's the hurry?

564
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,301
Let the date of
marriage be fixed first.

565
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,861
I'll get that done too.

566
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:14,221
I swear, I'm happier about
your marriage than mine.

567
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:16,624
I will go right now, and
fix the date of the marriage.

568
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,141
Greetings Mr. Thakur Mahendra Singh.

569
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,981
You must not be
remembering but your justice had..

570
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,981
Cleared me of some false charges..

571
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:43,621
And saved me from loss of respect.

572
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,981
Today, I've got a chance
repay this good deed of yours.

573
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,020
I have come to know that you
are thinking of marrying..

574
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:55,061
Your daughter to the
nephew of Diwan Jaswant Rai.

575
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:59,981
Suresh is a vagrant,
drunkard and bad young man..

576
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:03,068
Who has ruined the life of
many innocent girls till today.

577
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:06,381
Please read further.

578
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,837
But due to the terror
of Diwan Jaswant Rai..

579
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,981
None have the
courage to stand against him.

580
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:16,981
The Diwan wishes to marry
his nephew off just for the sake.

581
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:19,621
He wishes that he should wash
his hands off this bad nephew.

582
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:22,061
He has no other
interest in this marriage.

583
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,345
Otherwise just think..

584
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:27,275
If he would hold some
respect for you family..

585
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:30,981
Would he have presented his nephew's
marriage proposal or his son's?

586
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:34,141
I thought that this was
my duty and warned you.

587
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:38,141
It is your decision
after this. Your friend.

588
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,621
Friend? He is your enemy.
Yes, your enemy.

589
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:43,221
Sir. All is false. It is rubbish.

590
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,981
Ram Bharose is right.
This is nothing new.

591
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:48,776
In the matters of marriage..

592
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:51,381
Enemies do write
such kinds of letters.

593
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:54,141
Yes. You have talked
exactly to the point.

594
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,981
- This letter must surely be written by some rogue.
- Silent!

595
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:59,861
This letter is surely
written by an honest person.

596
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:01,981
He thought that our
justice was a boon for him..

597
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,861
Therefore he warned us.

598
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:07,861
Even this is to the point.
But how can I accept this, sir?

599
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,381
Till today, I haven't heard
a single word against Suraj.

600
00:40:10,572 --> 00:40:12,981
Fool. It is written
clearly in this letter..

601
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,781
That because of the
terror of the Diwan..

602
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,781
Nobody has the
guts to stand up to him

603
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,861
Yes, even this is to the point.

604
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,981
But why don't you send
this letter to the Diwan..

605
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:24,781
And find out what the matter is.

606
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:26,981
Have you gone crazy?

607
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:29,902
If we send this letter to him it
will be case of a poor man..

608
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:31,302
Falling in trouble needlessly.

609
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:33,981
Why do we need to fall
in a suspected matter?

610
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,141
You're dead, Ram!

611
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:38,541
- Jagdish!
- Yes. I'm coming.

612
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,061
Okay.

613
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,981
Jagdish, what do you
think about the boy..

614
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:48,075
Who came to for
our Shanta's proposal.

615
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:50,781
- Who? Shankar?
- Yes.

616
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,781
He is very good. He
is handsome and young.

617
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:55,021
He has a sense of humour too.

618
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:56,461
Sister was praising him too.

619
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,621
Very good. It means she likes him.

620
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,621
You are trapped, Ram!

621
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,061
She said that he has a
lot of general knowledge.

622
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:07,701
- Ram Bharose.
- Yes?

623
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:10,981
You had said that
Shankar isn't much educated?

624
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,981
Sir, I'd said that Shankar
didn't have a college education.

625
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,669
But a person can get knowledge..

626
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,189
Even without going to
the college.

627
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,138
He is the son of
a big house isn't it?

628
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,741
He acquired his education at home.

629
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:25,981
I've seen so many books
at their place, so many.

630
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,717
Tommy.

631
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,528
I've decided, Shakuntala..

632
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,981
How will the couple of
Shankar and Shanta be?

633
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,381
Excellent, excellent.

634
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:45,541
The fish of a big pond
will go to a big pond.

635
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,037
And then, there is a
lot of difference..

636
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:48,461
Between a son and a nephew.

637
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:53,061
In front of Shankar, Suresh is
like a pond in front of an ocean.

638
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:57,861
Don't worry. I will fix
this point to the point too.

639
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:05,102
I can't understand. What
is this matter all about?

640
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,981
Ram Bharose had richly
praised the Diwan's son.

641
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:11,773
I myself am shocked. But
you don't worry mother.

642
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:14,301
We will take any step after
thinking about it carefully.

643
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:17,589
Please say something.

644
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:20,461
Both of you have heard
Thakur Mahendra Singh's message.

645
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:22,461
What is your decision now?

646
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:23,981
I can't understand anything.

647
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:26,381
Why did they change their
thoughts all of a sudden?

648
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,037
It doesn't take too
much time for a man..

649
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:29,621
To change his
thoughts and decisions.

650
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,301
Shankar had gone to select
the girl for someone else.

651
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:35,621
But the girl's side selected him.
There is no other reason.

652
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:37,621
And about Suresh's marriage.

653
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:39,701
I will fix up his
marriage somewhere else.

654
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,461
I don't have any worries
about Suresh.

655
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,461
There are many proposals for him.

656
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,437
If God wishes then both the
brothers will be married..

657
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:46,861
On the same day.

658
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:50,638
This is to the point too.
If you don't have any problems..

659
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:53,061
Then should I give
this token to Mr. Shankar?

660
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:55,981
When they themselves
have selected Shankar..

661
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,461
What problems can we have?

662
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:58,981
But I have a problem.

663
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:02,141
What answer will be go to
Gopinath on the other side?

664
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:06,745
I don't think it right to talk
about marriage in a honest house..

665
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,781
And break talks unreasonably.

666
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:11,781
Please don't worry about that.

667
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:14,141
I will search
another boy for that girl.

668
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:17,221
Ram Bharose, this is
the matter of a girl.

669
00:43:18,106 --> 00:43:20,095
If the marriage talks start once..

670
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,809
And then if
they are broken then society..

671
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:24,701
Starts wagging their tongues.

672
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:28,221
And then one doesn't get a boy
from a good house that easily.

673
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,301
Even this is to the point.

674
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:33,061
I can't understand what to do.

675
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:37,981
If I return the token
then the Thakur feels bad.

676
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,861
And if I accept the token,
that I think about that poor girl.

677
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:45,061
Well this is clear.

678
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,981
Till the time Gopinath's
sister's marriage is not fixed..

679
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:53,145
Somewhere else, it
will be shameful for me..

680
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:55,301
To accept this proposal.

681
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:02,981
Please accept this proposal.
I'm ready to marry this girl.

682
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,177
Suresh!

683
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:05,457
What are you talking about?

684
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:09,381
You had said that..
Think about it once again.

685
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:11,021
This is the question
of your whole life.

686
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:12,981
That may be the case.

687
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:17,301
For me, my life is not
as important as my uncle.

688
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:20,603
He has brought me up, with
more love than his own son.

689
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:23,981
Very good. You have
completed the duty of being a son.

690
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,141
Bless you son!

691
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,861
This whole matter is
to the point, Diwan.

692
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:30,461
Please hold this token, and make
preparations for the marriage.

693
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:54,557
'Why did I turn and look around,
I was so innocent..'

694
00:45:56,455 --> 00:46:04,455
'That rogue was watching me
from the opposite terrace I was dead!'

695
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:14,701
'My life was at stake. The
arrow of the eyes had worked.'

696
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:23,516
'My life was in a problem.'

697
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:47,296
'He started to come on the terrace.'

698
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:48,981
Started to come on the terrace.'

699
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:54,306
'I started to lose my heart.'
- 'Started to lose my heart.'

700
00:46:54,386 --> 00:47:02,386
'He became a whiff of the wind
and started moving my hair.'

701
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:06,261
'I tried to stop him, I
tried to stop myself..'

702
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:09,305
'..but my heart didn't listen!'

703
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:15,867
'My heart faced a dilemma.'

704
00:47:16,174 --> 00:47:19,381
'He shot an arrow from his eyes.'

705
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,844
'My heart faced a dilemma.'

706
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,861
- "He tried a lot but.."
- "He tried a lot but.."

707
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:49,981
- "I didn't let our eyes meet."
- "I didn't let our eyes meet."

708
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:57,104
'But that day, oh, my God!
I was sitting unaware!'

709
00:47:57,184 --> 00:47:58,701
"I was sitting unaware."

710
00:47:58,861 --> 00:48:04,932
'By then he came and
sat into my eyes.'

711
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:11,381
My heart faced a problem.

712
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:18,701
'He shot an arrow from his eyes.
My heart faced a problem.'

713
00:48:38,074 --> 00:48:43,221
- "I have fallen in love.."
- "I have fallen in love.."

714
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:48,221
- "I am faultless in this."
- "I am faultless in this."

715
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,861
"He came very closer to me."

716
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:56,781
- "I couldn't stay away from him."
- "I couldn't stay away from him."

717
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:59,981
"Who could stop the clouds.."

718
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:03,861
"Who could stop the
storm in the river.."

719
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:09,621
"My heart faced a problem."

720
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:13,861
"He shot an arrow from his eyes."

721
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:17,221
"My heart faced a problem."

722
00:49:17,301 --> 00:49:20,701
"My heart faced a problem."

723
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:27,461
You won this challenge.

724
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,332
Now, tell me,
in the previous birth..

725
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:31,412
Was it me who gave alms
of pearls or was it you?

726
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:35,541
You. I had told all this
before I had seen sister-in-law.

727
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:39,098
But today, I would say that
you had offered diamonds..

728
00:49:39,178 --> 00:49:40,701
In your previous birth.

729
00:49:41,301 --> 00:49:43,301
The sister-in-law seems
like a Goddess Incarnate!

730
00:49:44,412 --> 00:49:46,981
Why are you talking about Gods
and Goddesses on this night?

731
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:48,541
Talk something interesting!

732
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:51,187
As soon as it is morning,
you will have to tell..

733
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:52,861
The story of the night.

734
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:54,541
The story of the night.

735
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:01,035
Oh! So, both of
you have hidden here?

736
00:50:01,461 --> 00:50:04,781
The both of you should have
been married to each other.

737
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:09,141
Here, take care of your wives.

738
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:14,141
This is yours, isn't it?
And this is yours.

739
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:16,381
See, recognise yourselves nicely.

740
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:18,621
See that there is no exchange then.

741
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:22,621
Arjun, take care of your Subhadra.

742
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:27,134
Not only have you married,
it is a proper conquer of Subhadra.

743
00:50:27,781 --> 00:50:32,781
Come, dear, come in your room.

744
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:40,981
Who was that old woman?

745
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:47,461
I didn't like what she said,
conquer of Subhadra!

746
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:52,581
Aunt is orthodox. Why should
we feel bad about her words?

747
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:57,061
And then, in one way she
has said the right thing.

748
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,061
What do you mean?

749
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:05,160
Who knew that the girl
whom I had gone to select..

750
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,781
For someone else would
become my life partner one day?

751
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:18,701
So was this a raid? Have you
robbed someone and brought me here?

752
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:22,981
It is a woman who robs every time.

753
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:28,621
- Has someone robbed your heart too?
- Yes.

754
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:31,078
Who?

755
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,881
The dacoit is in front of me.

756
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:40,872
Hey, are you scared of him?
I had hunted him.

757
00:51:41,756 --> 00:51:45,144
Aren't you afraid of
such dangerous animals?

758
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:47,916
Why should I be afraid of them?

759
00:51:47,996 --> 00:51:51,202
I was afraid only of
books and the teacher.

760
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:55,091
Therefore I used to bunk
school and go hunting.

761
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:57,931
Then, how did you
learn to read and write?

762
00:51:58,091 --> 00:51:59,411
Who has learnt to read and write?

763
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:07,091
Please don't joke and please
tell me, where is your library?

764
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:08,673
Library?

765
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:13,277
Oh, yes, library.
Come, I will show it you.

766
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:55,331
This is my library.

767
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:58,011
But there isn't a single book here.

768
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:02,091
Book. These are my books.

769
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:07,171
And all this, all this,
all this are my degrees.

770
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:10,055
I don't have that much of a
penchant for paper degrees.

771
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:14,035
So then, all that. all that.
That Shakespeare..

772
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:16,931
I didn't understand anything.

773
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:21,011
All that was taught to
me by my brother Suresh.

774
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:30,411
That means, that I was kept
in the dark knowingly?

775
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:33,931
In darkness? What does that mean?

776
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:39,091
Ram Bharose had told me that
you had a passion for studies.

777
00:53:39,731 --> 00:53:41,571
That your house is full of books?

778
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:47,171
Ram Bharose? Why did he
say all this, I don't know.

779
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:55,011
So, whatever he said was wrong.

780
00:53:56,811 --> 00:53:59,011
- He betrayed us.
- Shanta!

781
00:54:00,123 --> 00:54:02,931
In the greed of some money, that..

782
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:05,651
Wretch has made enmity with us!

783
00:54:26,665 --> 00:54:29,055
Okay, so I am your God?

784
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:35,732
Why not?
Every woman's husband is her God.

785
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:41,103
But do you know what
the worth of your God is?

786
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:44,056
This fame, this money,
this bungalow..

787
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:45,979
All belongs to my uncle.

788
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:50,045
Otherwise, all I own to
shelter myself is a small shack.

789
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,424
For me, that itself is a bungalow.

790
00:54:56,488 --> 00:54:59,689
Even God Shankar
stayed in the cemetery..

791
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:03,424
But for Goddess Parvati,
that itself was a palace.

792
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:08,984
Your mind is as
beautiful as your face.

793
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:17,817
Being with you, I think..

794
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:20,977
How unfulfilled my
life would be with out you.

795
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:24,817
I feel that..

796
00:55:45,977 --> 00:55:47,897
What happened? Who shot the bullet?

797
00:55:48,537 --> 00:55:53,217
Nothing, Mother. The voice of
some wild beast had frightened me.

798
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:54,977
And I shot a bullet.

799
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:56,593
It's nothing son, it's nothing.

800
00:55:56,617 --> 00:55:59,537
It was only that much?
I almost died out of fear.

801
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,201
You crazy person,
come go in your room.

802
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:02,801
No, Mother,
I am feeling rather unwell.

803
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,989
Go in your room quickly..

804
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,816
Or else
sister-in-law will become unwell.

805
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,457
Come, crazy person.

806
00:56:15,817 --> 00:56:19,217
Ram Bharose out, R. Bharosay in.

807
00:56:21,614 --> 00:56:23,817
Who is it? Is it the egg seller?

808
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:25,977
It is not the egg seller,
but the one with the baton.

809
00:56:30,897 --> 00:56:34,977
Oh, you? You remembered
your house after so many days?

810
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:39,377
When do I forget you
that I will remember you?

811
00:56:39,457 --> 00:56:41,977
I always have you close to my heart.

812
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:45,537
If you don't believe it, then see,
see this is your photo.

813
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,882
Should I look at the photo
or should I stare at my fate?

814
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:50,457
I will not stay here for
even a minute. Here is your key.

815
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:54,377
I've come to know all your secrets.

816
00:56:55,057 --> 00:56:59,537
Oh, God! Has she come to know
about the other fifty paisa?

817
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:02,977
Secret? What secret, Lilly?

818
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,897
In Ranigarh.
Everyone makes fun of Lilly.

819
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,063
They say, her husband
doesn't stay away from home..

820
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:10,377
For fifteen days just like that.

821
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:12,166
Surely, there is some problem.

822
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:14,297
There isn't any
thing wrong between us..

823
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:15,937
But it the people
who have a problem.

824
00:57:16,217 --> 00:57:17,977
They see our love and
are therefore jealous.

825
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:20,817
If some wretch comes and
tells you tomorrow that..

826
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:24,057
Your husband has two wives,
then will you believe him?

827
00:57:24,137 --> 00:57:26,880
It is the principle of the
world to alight a fire..

828
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,080
In other people's houses.

829
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:30,217
That is all right, but tell me..

830
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:32,617
Why do you stay out of
the house for so many days?

831
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:35,897
You ask me that again,
How many times should I tell you?

832
00:57:35,977 --> 00:57:37,817
If there is the head
office in Ranipur..

833
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:39,857
Then there is a branch
office in Lakhanpur too!

834
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:42,537
A person has to look
after two offices.

835
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:44,817
If there's any
problem in the adjustment..

836
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:47,347
The firm will fail,
and the proprietor will be in jail.

837
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:52,937
- Don't tell me a tale!
- Lily. Lily!

838
00:57:53,198 --> 00:57:59,057
Darling, are you angry? Just
see once. Please see once.

839
00:57:59,297 --> 00:58:00,377
See this.

840
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:05,217
Oh, so, you fixed up the
marriage of the Thakurs?

841
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:06,977
Exactly to the point.

842
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:10,495
Now, please think, if
I give you attendance..

843
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:11,817
In every twenty four hours..

844
00:58:11,897 --> 00:58:13,953
Then how will you have the
attendance of this God of cash?

845
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:18,171
But have you ever thought about
it darling, that when you are..

846
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:20,671
Busy in the branch
office till fifteen days..

847
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:23,977
What am I supposed to do here?

848
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:26,297
Suppose that I have
arranged for that too.

849
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,292
What do you mean?

850
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,817
I mean, that at the
next fill moon day..

851
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:32,897
We will go and take a
dip in Jattar Baba's pond.

852
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:35,817
He listens to everyone's request..

853
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:37,897
He will bless you
with a child too.

854
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:41,137
Then you will be busy
with the child.

855
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:47,977
How nice. How wonderful, you
are such a good man.

856
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,817
Now, won't you give me 'Kheeme Ke
Samosas (minced potato patties)'?

857
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:55,617
The ancestors have said,
serve and eat sweets!

858
00:58:58,352 --> 00:58:59,726
Thank God!

859
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:05,482
Basanti, let it be now.
I am feeling sleepy.

860
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:07,421
I didn't get sleep the whole night..

861
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:09,377
In the excitement
that you've come.

862
00:59:09,457 --> 00:59:10,977
And now, you are feeling sleepy.

863
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,897
Now, how can I make you understand?
I'm very tired.

864
00:59:14,057 --> 00:59:16,137
Don't do this service today.

865
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:17,377
Why shouldn't I serve you?

866
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:21,977
Don't you say, that
serve and eat sweets.

867
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:24,617
But today, I'm not in a position
to give you sweets today.

868
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:26,977
- Why?
- My wallet is empty today.

869
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:30,817
When is your wallet full?

870
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:33,217
I don't know where you empty
your wallet as you come.

871
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:37,297
You crazy woman, who else can
touch my wallet, expect you?

872
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:42,377
In the house, you are with me,
while outside, she is with me.

873
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:43,537
Who is this?

874
00:59:45,217 --> 00:59:48,057
But what can I do? There is a
single wallet and two offices.

875
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,817
If Lakhanpur is the head office..

876
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:51,897
Then Rampur has
the branch office.

877
00:59:51,977 --> 00:59:54,217
Since the time, you have
opened the Lakhanpur office..

878
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:56,537
Your wallet has
always been empty.

879
00:59:56,617 --> 00:59:58,057
Why don't you just close it off?

880
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:01,817
Listen to this. People wish that
their business should progress..

881
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:04,508
And more and more
offices should be opened.

882
01:00:04,588 --> 01:00:07,617
And she wishes that I should've
the office that I've opened.

883
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:11,953
Mother, don't worry.
When I grow up..

884
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,234
Then I will look
after your branch office.

885
01:00:14,314 --> 01:00:16,513
Shut up. One doesn't speak
in the matters of the elders.

886
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,377
Why not? This is my talented son!

887
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:26,131
Daddy! Daddy!

888
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:28,897
What is all this? You
jump and speak to me?

889
01:00:29,537 --> 01:00:33,137
What is this injustice? Oh, God,
what is this darkness?

890
01:00:33,824 --> 01:00:35,377
Some people wish for just one..

891
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,113
While somewhere you
have assembled piles!

892
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,217
Go, go, have some rest.

893
01:00:39,297 --> 01:00:41,057
Pappu, you rest too!

894
01:00:41,377 --> 01:00:42,457
Go, sleep.

895
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,137
Not one or two, but six!

896
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:49,897
Don't put an evil eye on the kids!

897
01:00:50,308 --> 01:00:54,237
Now even the seventh one is coming.

898
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:58,457
Hey, I am the one who should
be fainting in these days.

899
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:00,269
Why are you fainting off?

900
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:04,747
And yes, during this
time's Full moon day.

901
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,667
You will have to take me to Ranipur.

902
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:07,492
Ranipur?

903
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:11,107
Yes. I will take a dip
in Jakkhad Baba's pond..

904
01:01:11,187 --> 01:01:15,667
And pray that I get a girl.

905
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,960
After all, Lakshmi is needed
in the house too, isn't it?

906
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:19,635
If you want a Lakshmi at home..

907
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:21,740
Then you go a few days later
or before the Full Moon day.

908
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:23,364
My program is
already fixed for that day.

909
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:27,187
But the real importance of
that dip is on that day only.

910
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:30,267
If you are not there,
then we'll go to your branch office.

911
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:34,566
Under this pretext,
I will see your branch office too.

912
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:37,347
The office is a place
to work, not to rest.

913
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:40,107
And if I'm not there then
who will open the office?

914
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:43,267
Dare you step out of the
house at this full moon day!

915
01:01:43,507 --> 01:01:47,267
You are tired and so
you are speaking so much.

916
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:48,579
And God knows what you would..

917
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:50,187
Have done if you were all right.

918
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:51,347
Sleep now!

919
01:01:57,636 --> 01:01:59,956
Come son, Bless you, and sit down.

920
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,036
Be happy, daughter-in-law.

921
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:04,675
Please sit, son.

922
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,716
We were just speaking about you.

923
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:10,556
Congratulations on your new house.

924
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:11,956
Why should we be congratulated?

925
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:13,556
Even that house is your blessing.

926
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:15,396
Dare you ever speak
like this again!

927
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,396
Do you think that
you are different from us?

928
01:02:19,225 --> 01:02:22,476
If Shankar is one of our eyes,
then you are the other.

929
01:02:22,893 --> 01:02:25,316
Daughter-in-law, do you
have any problems there?

930
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:27,913
What problems can we have there,
when you are there?

931
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:30,316
Today, we've to tell
you that we will be..

932
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:32,476
Having the house warming
party day after tomorrow.

933
01:02:32,687 --> 01:02:33,956
You are cordially invited.

934
01:02:34,476 --> 01:02:36,316
Yes, Daughter-in-law,
we shall surely come.

935
01:02:36,956 --> 01:02:39,020
And brother-in-law, don't forget..

936
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,603
- To bring Shanta along with you.
- Shanta!

937
01:02:41,974 --> 01:02:46,796
Madhu, actually,
Shanta has fallen ill.

938
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:48,948
Therefore she has gone
back to her in-law's house.

939
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:51,961
But she must be here.

940
01:02:52,396 --> 01:02:55,476
Brother-in-law, you will have
to go right now to bring her.

941
01:02:55,636 --> 01:02:56,177
Right now?

942
01:02:56,257 --> 01:02:58,582
Yes. If you don't bring her, then..

943
01:02:58,856 --> 01:03:00,354
I will be very angry with her.

944
01:03:00,434 --> 01:03:02,354
Then, you surely will
have to bring her with you.

945
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:15,316
I think this is the
good luck of my sister..

946
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:17,956
Who got a good husband
as well as a good house.

947
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:20,396
Say just the house, Jagdish.

948
01:03:20,642 --> 01:03:22,442
Why, why shouldn't
I say so about the husband?

949
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,396
What is so special about me?

950
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:27,266
That's good.
You have found a good way..

951
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,786
Of listening to your own praises.

952
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:30,879
I feel that, reading
the writers, you..

953
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:32,279
Yourself have become a writer.

954
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:36,476
Brother-in-law, I can't
understand this story.

955
01:03:36,796 --> 01:03:38,396
Please make me understand it.

956
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,482
Short Stories of Mopasa?

957
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,396
You must have
by hearted all of his stories.

958
01:03:44,998 --> 01:03:46,452
He is your favourite author,
isn't it?

959
01:03:46,476 --> 01:03:49,316
It's nothing like that.
But I have read..

960
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:52,036
Some of Mopasa's
stories in Hindi.

961
01:03:52,568 --> 01:03:54,036
I don't know English.

962
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:56,774
That's right. If the brother-in-law
doesn't joke..

963
01:03:56,854 --> 01:03:57,876
Then who else will?

964
01:03:57,956 --> 01:04:00,920
This isn't a joke, Jagdish.
I really don't know English.

965
01:04:01,956 --> 01:04:03,036
Really?

966
01:04:03,365 --> 01:04:05,036
And I am not ashamed about this too.

967
01:04:05,396 --> 01:04:09,946
That is all right. But this is
a shameful thing for Shanta.

968
01:04:10,026 --> 01:04:11,072
Yes?

969
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:15,116
I mean. Shanta and her brothers
and sisters, all are educated.

970
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:18,316
But if you this problem
can be solved even now.

971
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:22,171
Problem? You mean to say
that the person who doesn't..

972
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:25,396
Speak English is an illiterate
and an uneducated person?

973
01:04:25,476 --> 01:04:27,636
- I didn't mean..
- What is this you are talking about?

974
01:04:28,194 --> 01:04:30,316
Come, son, let's have
break fast now.

975
01:04:30,396 --> 01:04:32,556
Please don't speak in Hindi,
Mother.

976
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:34,956
Otherwise, you will be
termed illiterate too.

977
01:04:35,263 --> 01:04:36,796
Okay. Okay. Come with me.

978
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,565
Please sit son.
Start, I will bring tea for you.

979
01:04:54,581 --> 01:04:57,116
And yes, please don't feel
about her father's words.

980
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:59,036
He loves you immensely.

981
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:19,316
Shanta, Shanta, take
this tea for Shankar.

982
01:05:20,085 --> 01:05:23,944
Take the tea?
Am I bearer or a servant?

983
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:27,502
Are you crazy?
What will he think if he hears it?

984
01:05:27,783 --> 01:05:30,343
Let him think whatever
he wants to. I don't care.

985
01:05:30,423 --> 01:05:32,183
Don't you feel
ashamed speaking like this?

986
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:34,783
Even an outsider is
looked after well.

987
01:05:35,676 --> 01:05:38,623
Take this. Prepare tea for him.

988
01:05:39,183 --> 01:05:40,623
And speak sweetly with him.

989
01:05:41,363 --> 01:05:43,623
After all, you have to
spend your whole life with him.

990
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:46,731
I don't have to
spend my life with him.

991
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:48,329
I have to ruin my life with him.

992
01:06:08,314 --> 01:06:12,543
- What happened? Where is Shankar?
- What do I know?

993
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,543
What I feared has happened.

994
01:06:16,217 --> 01:06:17,863
He has surely heard what you said.

995
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:21,263
This is very bad,
Shanta, It is very bad.

996
01:06:21,882 --> 01:06:23,623
What had happened well earlier?

997
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,623
Hello Suresh. The new
house has become auspicious.

998
01:06:30,703 --> 01:06:32,543
Eating, drinking, and
all prayers are done.

999
01:06:33,543 --> 01:06:36,543
- Where is Shankar?
- When will the singing arena be settled?

1000
01:06:37,148 --> 01:06:38,343
Maybe his train is late.

1001
01:06:38,824 --> 01:06:41,263
He should have come by now.
But where is he?

1002
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:42,500
To his In law's place.

1003
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,773
Hey, why didn't you
tell it to us before?

1004
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:47,451
He won't come now and nor
will he sing, come friends come.

1005
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:48,478
But why?

1006
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:50,781
A person can return from hell but..

1007
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,526
He can't return
from his in laws place.

1008
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:55,183
See, he has come back.

1009
01:06:56,103 --> 01:06:57,818
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1010
01:06:58,067 --> 01:07:00,155
We were speaking about you
just now, you will live long.

1011
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:01,528
You have an age of thousand years.

1012
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:04,943
We were waiting for you.
But Shanta?

1013
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:09,263
She was unwell. I didn't feel
it right to force her to come.

1014
01:07:09,537 --> 01:07:11,863
- Is it anything serious?
- No, it's nothing like that.

1015
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:15,040
Then please sit here
and let us hear..

1016
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:16,919
Something that
makes our heart aflutter.

1017
01:07:16,943 --> 01:07:20,153
Please excuse me,
I don't feel like singing at all.

1018
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:21,602
That is good, brother Shankar.

1019
01:07:21,682 --> 01:07:24,889
You seem less of a hunter
and more of a lover.

1020
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:27,382
Just because sister-in-law caught..

1021
01:07:27,462 --> 01:07:28,623
A cold you lost your mood.

1022
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,623
Come on! Come on!

1023
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:34,623
It is better if you excuse me.

1024
01:07:34,703 --> 01:07:36,543
Don't disappoint them...

1025
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:38,663
they have been waiting for
you since a long time.

1026
01:07:38,703 --> 01:07:40,703
- Sister-in-law, I swear..
- For my sake.

1027
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,623
Hey, what are you doing?
Go and play outside.

1028
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:52,103
Let them play, these are
the golden days of playing.

1029
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:54,623
When they grow up, they
will fight just like us.

1030
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:27,542
"The days of my childhood.."

1031
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:34,183
"Have again, been
brought to my remembrance."

1032
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:40,342
"Those angry separations.."

1033
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:45,342
"And patching up of childhood."

1034
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:51,623
"Have again, been
brought to my remembrance.."

1035
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:13,247
"Those game of love, those swings.."

1036
01:09:13,327 --> 01:09:19,543
"That running, and then
asking others to catch us."

1037
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:25,106
"Those game of love, those swings.."

1038
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:29,594
"That running, and then
asking others to catch us."

1039
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:35,263
"I haven't forgotten till now.."

1040
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:41,543
"I haven't forgotten till date.."

1041
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:46,545
"Sweet memories of my childhood."

1042
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:52,863
"They have again been
brought to my remembrance.."

1043
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:09,343
"No one knows about it.."

1044
01:10:09,423 --> 01:10:17,423
"No one knows about it, this
isn't a guest for two days."

1045
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:25,343
"This isn't a guest for 2 days."

1046
01:10:25,423 --> 01:10:30,836
"It's difficult, not easy."

1047
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:36,782
"It's difficult, not easy."

1048
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:42,103
"To forget this love of
my childhood."

1049
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:48,343
"Have again, been
brought to my remembrance.."

1050
01:11:04,058 --> 01:11:09,623
"Meet them, plead to them."

1051
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:14,863
"Request to get back
those lost days."

1052
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:20,372
"Cry together, request them."

1053
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:25,928
"Recall those days past."

1054
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:31,543
"Only if I could meet someone.."

1055
01:11:31,623 --> 01:11:36,867
"Only if I could meet someone.."

1056
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,623
"Who was a
companion in my childhood."

1057
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:48,554
"I have again been
brought to my remembrance."

1058
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:53,623
"The childhood of my past."

1059
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:59,895
"Those angry separations.."

1060
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:04,749
"And patching up of childhood."

1061
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,700
Madhu?

1062
01:12:18,608 --> 01:12:23,863
Brother-in-law, sing a nice song.
I remembered my childhood too.

1063
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:29,759
Please forgive me. When I saw
brother-in-law being tense..

1064
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,919
- I sent Ram Bharose there without telling you.
- Then?

1065
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,919
They didn't give any nice answer.

1066
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:38,759
What did they say?

1067
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:42,839
They aren't happy
with this relation.

1068
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:45,174
But why?

1069
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:49,559
They say that
they have been tricked..

1070
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:51,535
Therefore they are not ready to..

1071
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,039
Send their daughter in this house.

1072
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:56,919
Okay, so let them keep
their daughter in their house.

1073
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:58,399
I don't care about her.

1074
01:12:58,759 --> 01:12:59,763
What are you saying?

1075
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:01,759
I'm right. There is
no dearth of girls..

1076
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:03,839
For our son's marriage,
understood.

1077
01:13:06,141 --> 01:13:08,159
Dear, this isn't good.

1078
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,479
I don't know
what he will do in a fit of rage.

1079
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:17,079
I think that the pride of
wealth has made this Diwan crazy.

1080
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,759
Instead of being ashamed of trying..

1081
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:22,486
To tie up his
uneducated son with our daughter..

1082
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:25,351
He writes that if we don't
sent our daughter back there..

1083
01:13:25,557 --> 01:13:27,319
Then he will remarry his son.

1084
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:30,999
- Second marriage!
- If he was to do it tomorrow..

1085
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,839
It's better that he does it today.

1086
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:34,441
Even if I was to
send Shanta back there..

1087
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:35,559
I won't send her now.

1088
01:13:35,919 --> 01:13:37,559
What does he think about us?

1089
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:42,479
No. Please don't take any
rash steps in a fit of anger.

1090
01:13:42,559 --> 01:13:43,828
After all, we are
from the girl's side.

1091
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,842
That doesn't mean that we
will tolerate our insult.

1092
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,275
- But I say!
- I will not listen to anything..

1093
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:51,815
I will write such a
answer to his letter..

1094
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,415
That both the father as well
as the son come to their senses.

1095
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:56,759
After reading such a letter..

1096
01:13:57,155 --> 01:13:59,159
Which self respecting
person will keep quiet?

1097
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:01,588
Just imagine,
if the matter goes out of hand..

1098
01:14:01,668 --> 01:14:03,047
There will be such indignity!

1099
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:04,759
Is something yet left to do?

1100
01:14:05,436 --> 01:14:06,863
That crazy Thakur..

1101
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,303
Writes that our son is illiterate,
useless and educated..

1102
01:14:09,589 --> 01:14:10,789
And I will just keep quiet?

1103
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:13,783
Not only that, he says
that I am a trickster.

1104
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:15,815
Trickster?
What are you talking about?

1105
01:14:15,895 --> 01:14:18,398
I am saying what he has written.
He says that..

1106
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:21,759
Fix the marriage
between Shankar and Shanta..

1107
01:14:21,839 --> 01:14:24,430
I had sent an anonymous
letter to them against Suresh.

1108
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:26,239
Oh, my God!

1109
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,873
How can that manner less
person say such a thing to us?

1110
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:30,289
I said, please listen to me.

1111
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:32,769
I will listen to you only
after I answer this rubbish of his.

1112
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:39,839
I have full faith that the
letter was written on your command.

1113
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,919
For your discretion, I am sending
the letter with this letter.

1114
01:14:44,634 --> 01:14:45,919
Thakur Mahendra Singh.

1115
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:54,839
What is this Shankar?

1116
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:56,936
It is the same anonymous letter.

1117
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:02,342
Suresh is a drunkard,
gambler and a bad man.

1118
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:10,030
He doesn't have any interest
in this marriage relation.

1119
01:15:10,483 --> 01:15:14,948
Otherwise, please think.
Wouldn't he have put forward..

1120
01:15:15,392 --> 01:15:19,531
The relation of his son,
instead of his nephew?

1121
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:24,922
Who must have written this letter?

1122
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:27,722
The writer hasn't
written his name at all.

1123
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:32,482
Even I know that. It can be
found out even without that.

1124
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,608
I mean, who is your enemy..

1125
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,070
Who has committed such a
wretched thing against you.

1126
01:15:40,397 --> 01:15:42,894
What do I know? Bury this thing.

1127
01:15:42,974 --> 01:15:44,242
Give it to me.

1128
01:15:44,743 --> 01:15:47,242
What will you do of this?
This is against me.

1129
01:15:47,322 --> 01:15:50,322
No, Suresh. This letter is
neither against me nor you.

1130
01:15:50,722 --> 01:15:52,242
This letter is against humanity.

1131
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,802
I will go to the crux of
this matter.

1132
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:58,722
And believe me,
I won't spare this person.

1133
01:15:59,482 --> 01:16:00,642
What are you saying, Shankar?

1134
01:16:00,704 --> 01:16:03,305
Yes. This is the person who has..

1135
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:06,322
Tried to play with the
respect of our family.

1136
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:10,797
It was thanks to you,
that you sacrificed..

1137
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,322
Yourself and saved the respect.

1138
01:16:14,732 --> 01:16:17,242
You are a very emotional person.
Give it to me here.

1139
01:16:17,435 --> 01:16:18,435
What did you do?

1140
01:16:18,905 --> 01:16:21,065
If someone does badly to you,
then don't listen to him.

1141
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:23,242
If someone errs,
then please forgive him.

1142
01:16:24,116 --> 01:16:28,482
You aren't human, you are a God!
My friend, you are God.

1143
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:08,562
If I am not there, then
who will make food for you?

1144
01:17:08,774 --> 01:17:12,242
If you are sad, then who
will make you happy again?

1145
01:17:32,978 --> 01:17:39,042
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1146
01:17:39,303 --> 01:17:45,242
"Where is everyone
near his beloved."

1147
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:51,561
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1148
01:18:06,006 --> 01:18:12,190
"The broken bank remains afar."

1149
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:17,866
"The boatman doesn't
help anyone cross."

1150
01:18:17,946 --> 01:18:24,322
"The broken bank remains afar."

1151
01:18:24,402 --> 01:18:30,245
"The boatman doesn't
help anyone cross."

1152
01:18:30,894 --> 01:18:36,462
'If the boat is with one,
then the bank is close too.'

1153
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:42,882
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1154
01:18:43,197 --> 01:18:49,242
"Where everyone
near his beloved."

1155
01:18:49,322 --> 01:18:55,348
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1156
01:19:08,224 --> 01:19:14,042
'Even if someone puts
off all the lights.."

1157
01:19:14,122 --> 01:19:19,812
"love always enlightens
the whole path with stars."

1158
01:19:20,245 --> 01:19:26,278
"Even if someone puts
off all the lights.."

1159
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:31,962
"love always enlightens
the whole path with stars."

1160
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:38,322
'Even this crazy love
has a strange story.'

1161
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:44,322
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1162
01:19:44,807 --> 01:19:50,872
"Where everyone near his beloved."

1163
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:56,802
"Every one doesn't
have this fate in life.."

1164
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:03,196
Sister-in-law?

1165
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,482
When did you arrive here?

1166
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:09,322
- This song.. this song..
- Did you like it?

1167
01:20:10,732 --> 01:20:12,242
I liked it very much.

1168
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,042
I had heard this song
in my childhood.

1169
01:20:16,322 --> 01:20:21,882
- Those days were so good. I felt that..
- What happened?

1170
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:25,726
Nothing, There is just
a little blood.

1171
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,482
Give it to me. I will apply it.

1172
01:20:42,482 --> 01:20:44,322
I think that lightning
has struck somewhere.

1173
01:20:56,743 --> 01:20:57,962
Sister-in-law?

1174
01:20:58,332 --> 01:21:00,802
No. Just lie comfortably.

1175
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:08,642
Comfort? One gets comfort in
this world with luck, sister-in-law.

1176
01:21:12,605 --> 01:21:13,802
Son, please drink this milk.

1177
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:18,322
No, Mother, I don't want anything.

1178
01:21:18,402 --> 01:21:21,902
You don't want anything,
but we need you.

1179
01:21:22,722 --> 01:21:26,882
I will see how you
don't drink it. Drink it!

1180
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:27,562
One gets such Goddess with luck.

1181
01:22:28,522 --> 01:22:30,242
May God keep you happy!

1182
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:33,122
My happiness is in the
happiness of this house, aunt.

1183
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:36,002
Brother-in-law's health
is almost all right now.

1184
01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:37,442
If you permit me..

1185
01:22:37,602 --> 01:22:39,962
Then I will go to Lakhanpur,
to bring back Shanta.

1186
01:22:42,918 --> 01:22:45,398
I don't know how much of your
gratefulness can be repaid by me.

1187
01:22:58,074 --> 01:23:01,482
God, what joke have
you played with me?

1188
01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:03,618
Under what conditions have the..

1189
01:23:03,642 --> 01:23:05,722
Separated travellers met
in this journey of life?

1190
01:23:06,562 --> 01:23:09,242
God, please give me strength..

1191
01:23:09,322 --> 01:23:13,042
That the storm of my emotions
stays buried in my heart.

1192
01:23:13,762 --> 01:23:16,242
And even by mistake
I don't do anything..

1193
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:19,242
Which will sadden Suresh
and by which friendship..

1194
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,402
Will have to
suffer a blot of infamy.

1195
01:23:22,107 --> 01:23:26,682
God, please give me strength!
Please give me strength!

1196
01:23:32,161 --> 01:23:35,482
Lily, this is enough. Jakkhad
Baba's blessings are enough.

1197
01:23:35,879 --> 01:23:39,722
No, darling. Now you should dip
in this holy water.

1198
01:23:39,945 --> 01:23:41,522
Darling, leave the
dip and all that.

1199
01:23:41,682 --> 01:23:44,282
If I slip, then I don't
even know how to swim.

1200
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:47,242
The water is deep,
while getting a child..

1201
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,962
Please don't make me a widower.

1202
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:57,802
Did you see, kids? This
is Jakkhad Baba' pond.

1203
01:23:57,962 --> 01:24:00,042
Oh, my God! Basanti!

1204
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:03,882
Darling! Help me! Darling, help me!

1205
01:24:03,962 --> 01:24:06,842
Someone save me!
My husband is drowning!

1206
01:24:07,802 --> 01:24:10,098
Ma'am, please don't worry, your
husband will come out just now.

1207
01:24:10,122 --> 01:24:12,362
How will he come back?
Please hurry up..

1208
01:24:12,442 --> 01:24:14,708
He doesn't know to swim!

1209
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:17,242
Is it so? Come fast!

1210
01:24:20,242 --> 01:24:24,242
What is happening there?
You wait here..

1211
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:26,962
I will come, just hold this.

1212
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:32,442
What happened? Hey, why are
you crying? What happened?

1213
01:24:32,522 --> 01:24:34,018
Her husband fell down in
the Jakkhad Baba's pond.

1214
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:37,804
- He's drowning?
- Yes. He was standing here to nicely!

1215
01:24:38,128 --> 01:24:40,722
Why did I come in this water?

1216
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,402
Jakkhad Baba will surely
give me back my husband.

1217
01:24:44,482 --> 01:24:46,722
Have patience,
everything will be all right.

1218
01:24:46,802 --> 01:24:49,762
What will be all right?
I had just one husband!

1219
01:24:49,842 --> 01:24:50,922
Have you gone crazy?

1220
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,522
Do other.. people have two husbands?
Please keep quiet.

1221
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:56,882
Why do cry? Please keep quiet.

1222
01:24:56,962 --> 01:24:59,242
We didn't get anything else.
We just got these clothes.

1223
01:24:59,322 --> 01:25:00,149
Are these his clothes?

1224
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:05,123
Oh, God! What did you do?

1225
01:25:05,436 --> 01:25:07,722
Let me die too! What are you doing?

1226
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:11,882
Let me go! I can't live without him.

1227
01:25:12,042 --> 01:25:14,762
- Let me die.
- Have you gone crazy?

1228
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:17,242
It's a sin to commit suicide.
Come with me.

1229
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:18,538
These people are
still searching for him.

1230
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:22,042
Come, come with me, be careful.

1231
01:25:25,242 --> 01:25:26,322
Oh, my God!

1232
01:25:34,602 --> 01:25:39,282
Darling, why didn't
you take me with you too?

1233
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:46,802
How will I stay alive without you?
Tell me darling, tell me!

1234
01:25:56,122 --> 01:26:00,711
You! Ghost! Ghost!

1235
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:08,791
Lily, I'm not a Ghost.
I am your husband, R.B Rosay.

1236
01:26:10,302 --> 01:26:17,113
Darling, are you Rosay,
you are alive? Am I dreaming?

1237
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:20,722
Darling, you are not
seeing a dream, but a drama.

1238
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:22,322
- Drama?
- Yes.

1239
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:25,122
- I was trapped in a whirlpool.
- Whirlpool?

1240
01:26:25,242 --> 01:26:27,242
Then how did you survive?

1241
01:26:27,322 --> 01:26:29,242
Has anyone who has been trapped..

1242
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:32,242
In a whirlpool ever survived?
I had died!

1243
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:33,675
You had died?

1244
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:36,242
Yes. But angels came
to reach me till here.

1245
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:37,938
Please come, angels,
have some tea and go.

1246
01:26:37,962 --> 01:26:39,882
Oh, they have gone.

1247
01:26:40,242 --> 01:26:42,962
They have gone? Now worries. Come.

1248
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:47,242
I will introduce you to
an earthly angel. Come on.

1249
01:26:47,322 --> 01:26:50,882
- An earth's angel?
- Come on, darling!

1250
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:00,122
Who is this woman?

1251
01:27:00,442 --> 01:27:02,242
This is that same angelic woman..

1252
01:27:02,322 --> 01:27:04,983
Who stopped me from
committing suicide..

1253
01:27:05,063 --> 01:27:06,423
After you drowned in the water.

1254
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:08,242
Then she is a Goddess.

1255
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:10,042
Yes. And do you know..

1256
01:27:10,122 --> 01:27:14,242
She cried as if you
were her husband, too.

1257
01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:16,498
Is it so? Then I should
thank her for this.

1258
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:19,362
No, let her rest now.

1259
01:27:19,522 --> 01:27:22,777
She had to.. go through a
lot of trouble because of us.

1260
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,842
Thank her tomorrow morning.
Let her sleep now.

1261
01:27:25,285 --> 01:27:29,482
Darling, it is too late in
the night. I'm sleepy too.

1262
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:32,002
I'm so happy to see you.

1263
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:39,042
You don't let me peacefully.

1264
01:27:39,122 --> 01:27:41,482
You are making noise as if
it is your father's house.

1265
01:27:41,722 --> 01:27:44,682
It's not the house of a
stranger too. Let the kids play.

1266
01:27:44,762 --> 01:27:45,842
Kids, play.

1267
01:27:45,922 --> 01:27:48,042
My children are very mischievous.

1268
01:27:48,122 --> 01:27:50,242
I like mischievous kids.

1269
01:27:50,322 --> 01:27:53,522
May God give you children too!

1270
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:57,322
Daddy, Daddy! Mother
look at daddy's photo!

1271
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,842
Hey, he has become a gentleman here.

1272
01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:06,242
- Where did you get this picture?
- He is my husband, R. B. Rosay.

1273
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:08,482
No, his name is..

1274
01:28:09,143 --> 01:28:12,122
Hey, what are you staring at?
Tell her your father's name.

1275
01:28:12,242 --> 01:28:13,242
Ram Bharose.

1276
01:28:13,467 --> 01:28:16,602
How can this be? You are tricked?

1277
01:28:16,762 --> 01:28:18,042
How can a mother of six children..

1278
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:20,362
Be tricked about her husband?

1279
01:28:20,522 --> 01:28:22,242
He is really my husband.

1280
01:28:22,322 --> 01:28:24,042
Daddy! Daddy!

1281
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:27,242
- Daddy, where is daddy?
- You are my daddy!

1282
01:28:27,322 --> 01:28:30,442
What do you talk? We are
yearning for one kids here..

1283
01:28:30,522 --> 01:28:33,242
And where has this army of
six children come here from?

1284
01:28:33,435 --> 01:28:36,042
Lily, Lily darling, who is this?

1285
01:28:36,122 --> 01:28:40,362
Okay, so you have forgotten me?
Don't you feel ashamed?

1286
01:28:40,522 --> 01:28:43,402
Once you wore this hat have you
forgotten your wife and children?

1287
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:47,042
Why are you silent? Why don't
you tell us! What is all this?

1288
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:49,042
I don't know! I don't know!

1289
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:52,882
Just look into my
eyes and speak to me.

1290
01:28:53,242 --> 01:28:54,981
How can I speak looking
into another..

1291
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:56,802
Woman's eyes,
in front of my wife?

1292
01:28:56,962 --> 01:29:01,642
Was this why you stayed away from
the house for two months?

1293
01:29:01,882 --> 01:29:04,602
- Me? Away for two months?
- Yes, you.

1294
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:11,458
Instead of being ashamed, you
are laughing at your antics?

1295
01:29:11,482 --> 01:29:12,802
Don't you feel ashamed?

1296
01:29:13,002 --> 01:29:16,092
I feel like laughing,
as well as like crying.

1297
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:18,042
It is not your fault.

1298
01:29:19,108 --> 01:29:25,042
- Are you the wife of Ram Bharose?
- Yes, and that's you.

1299
01:29:25,122 --> 01:29:28,642
No. I am his twin brother
R. B. Rosay.

1300
01:29:29,242 --> 01:29:30,156
Twin brother?

1301
01:29:30,236 --> 01:29:33,882
Exactly. People easily
get fooled on seeing us.

1302
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:37,322
But he never told me
that he has a twin brother.

1303
01:29:37,402 --> 01:29:40,042
Even I never told Lily
that I have a twin brother.

1304
01:29:40,122 --> 01:29:42,962
Lily? I had fought
with him in childhood!

1305
01:29:43,722 --> 01:29:45,242
But today seeing you again..

1306
01:29:45,322 --> 01:29:48,879
My blood has been aroused again!
Where is my brother?

1307
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:52,642
Darling - Lily! Please
embrace your sister-in-law.

1308
01:29:52,802 --> 01:29:59,642
- Sister-in-law? - Yes!
- Sister-in-law! - My sister, Lily!

1309
01:30:02,024 --> 01:30:03,528
Hey, sister Madhu.

1310
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,320
You didn't inform me
nor did you send any telegram.

1311
01:30:07,344 --> 01:30:08,824
How did you come here
all of a sudden?

1312
01:30:08,984 --> 01:30:11,064
Even you had left your in
laws place all of a sudden.

1313
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:13,264
What was your problem with me?

1314
01:30:13,485 --> 01:30:14,965
Why didn't you meet me
before leaving?

1315
01:30:17,064 --> 01:30:18,584
The matter was some thing serious.

1316
01:30:25,616 --> 01:30:27,264
I know everything.

1317
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:32,344
Don't feel bad Shanta,
but you took steps in haste.

1318
01:30:34,824 --> 01:30:38,024
You should at least have
spoken to me before leaving.

1319
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:42,264
Actually, I was
worried a lot, therefore..

1320
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:44,504
Anyway, forget whatever
has happened.

1321
01:30:45,853 --> 01:30:47,984
Make preparations to
come with me now.

1322
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:52,424
No. This isn't possible.

1323
01:30:53,464 --> 01:30:57,304
I can't live.. with that
illiterate person even for a day.

1324
01:30:57,549 --> 01:30:59,567
- Shanta!
- Don't you feel ashamed..

1325
01:30:59,647 --> 01:31:01,240
Speaking like this
about your husband?

1326
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:02,480
What you said is totally wrong.

1327
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:03,824
Definitely it is wrong.

1328
01:31:04,504 --> 01:31:06,617
You cannot.. judge the
literacy of a person just because..

1329
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:08,504
He has read a few
books more or less.

1330
01:31:09,384 --> 01:31:10,653
Don't you find intelligent people..

1331
01:31:10,677 --> 01:31:12,320
Among the illiterate and
fools among the literate?

1332
01:31:12,344 --> 01:31:15,584
Why not? An educated
fool's standing here, isn't it?

1333
01:31:15,664 --> 01:31:19,024
- Mother?
- Then what? What has education taught you?

1334
01:31:19,264 --> 01:31:20,904
Pride and obstinacy,
that's all, isn't it?

1335
01:31:22,064 --> 01:31:25,264
Do not speak thus mother.
Who doesn't commit mistakes?

1336
01:31:26,478 --> 01:31:27,614
What mistake?

1337
01:31:27,797 --> 01:31:32,264
How can I spend my life with a
person who doesn't like me?

1338
01:31:33,365 --> 01:31:36,264
You tell, what would you have
done if you were in my place?

1339
01:31:37,904 --> 01:31:39,772
Only God knows what would be done..

1340
01:31:39,852 --> 01:31:41,612
If the roles of
people were to be reversed

1341
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,264
I only know that..

1342
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,264
You haven't given each other the
opportunity to get acquainted.

1343
01:31:49,264 --> 01:31:51,372
If you stay together for a
few days then all these..

1344
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:53,264
Misunderstandings
will automatically clear.

1345
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,851
Life is not that long,
sister Madhu that it should..

1346
01:31:57,931 --> 01:31:59,424
Be wasted in useless experiences.

1347
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,624
Do you know what will
be the result of this?

1348
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:03,064
I've thought of it.

1349
01:32:09,354 --> 01:32:11,384
- Divorce.
- What did you say?

1350
01:32:12,175 --> 01:32:14,424
- Never speak such words ever again.
- Keep quiet.

1351
01:32:14,672 --> 01:32:16,744
I have been quiet long.
I cannot any more.

1352
01:32:17,144 --> 01:32:19,104
I have some rights
in this house, too.

1353
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:21,320
In front of my eyes,
this house is going up in blazes..

1354
01:32:21,344 --> 01:32:22,360
And you tell me to be quiet?

1355
01:32:22,384 --> 01:32:24,264
I am also trying to
douse this very fire.

1356
01:32:24,963 --> 01:32:27,900
Do you want our
daughter to always be..

1357
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:29,140
Attached to that imbecile?

1358
01:32:29,264 --> 01:32:30,511
God knows what ire you father and..

1359
01:32:30,535 --> 01:32:32,104
Daughter have against
that poor man!

1360
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,644
You can only see faults in him.
Why do you forget..

1361
01:32:36,034 --> 01:32:37,750
That it was you
yourself who had chosen Shankar?

1362
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:39,624
You had put the proposal,
not they.

1363
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:45,144
So what? To err is human. Now, I shall
get my daughter married elsewhere.

1364
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:47,014
And if there is a problem again..

1365
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:48,694
You shall get her
married a third time

1366
01:32:48,726 --> 01:32:51,264
And then a fourth, a fifth..

1367
01:32:51,344 --> 01:32:53,220
What betterment will you do
for your daughter eventually?

1368
01:32:53,244 --> 01:32:56,264
Stop your nonsense!
You have lost your senses.

1369
01:32:57,353 --> 01:33:01,264
Please be patient.
Anger makes things worse.

1370
01:33:01,764 --> 01:33:03,753
Mother wishes to say..

1371
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:06,264
That our country is the land
of Sita and Savitri.

1372
01:33:06,878 --> 01:33:09,674
What to speak of
life Even after death..

1373
01:33:09,754 --> 01:33:11,514
The woman remains
faithful to her husband.

1374
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,400
But the world has changed
drastically, daughter Madhu..

1375
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:18,264
But the foundations of human
relations can never change.

1376
01:33:18,964 --> 01:33:22,264
Father, you are grossly
misjudging my brother-in-law.

1377
01:33:23,343 --> 01:33:25,143
After all, who has got
all the good qualities?

1378
01:33:25,905 --> 01:33:29,264
The household is made
stronger with love and strength.

1379
01:33:30,067 --> 01:33:32,624
Did you listen to that?
This is the only way out for you.

1380
01:33:33,234 --> 01:33:35,264
To save your and
your family's respect.

1381
01:33:39,904 --> 01:33:42,044
If by strangling the
throat of my happiness..

1382
01:33:42,124 --> 01:33:45,264
The respect of this
family can be saved..

1383
01:33:45,774 --> 01:33:46,864
Then so be it.

1384
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:06,517
Bless you, daughter-in-law.

1385
01:34:07,155 --> 01:34:10,477
Daughter-in-law, it is
good that you have come.

1386
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:13,557
I am forever grateful
to you, daughter-in-law.

1387
01:34:13,637 --> 01:34:15,082
But where is my brother-in-law?

1388
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,517
He must be here somewhere.

1389
01:34:16,837 --> 01:34:18,877
But a brother-in-law can't
get such a sister-in-law.

1390
01:34:19,316 --> 01:34:21,677
And where will a sister-in-law
get such a brother-in-law?

1391
01:34:22,137 --> 01:34:24,137
Yes, when brother-in-law comes..

1392
01:34:24,321 --> 01:34:27,317
- Then please remind him of the prayers at our place.
- Okay.

1393
01:34:27,677 --> 01:34:29,819
- Can I leave now?
- I won't allow you to go..

1394
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:31,213
Without sweetening your mouth.

1395
01:34:31,237 --> 01:34:33,837
Today is a very auspicious day
for me, come daughter-in-law.

1396
01:34:51,157 --> 01:34:56,797
- Bless you Goodness!
- No, don't give me this blessing.

1397
01:34:57,597 --> 01:34:58,807
Bless me..

1398
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:01,910
That when I go from this world..

1399
01:35:02,537 --> 01:35:03,702
I should be wearing
the bangles in my hand..

1400
01:35:03,726 --> 01:35:05,723
And there should be the
marriage vermillion on my forehead.

1401
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:11,202
No. This will mean that you
should reach heaven quickly.

1402
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:12,562
God forbid.

1403
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:14,962
I will give myself a blessing.

1404
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,562
That God should make me
an uncle of a moon like boy fast.

1405
01:35:18,828 --> 01:35:20,722
His face may resemble
his father's..

1406
01:35:20,802 --> 01:35:22,814
But his intelligence
should resemble his mother's

1407
01:35:22,838 --> 01:35:25,271
The reason being, that he
shouldn't be a atheist..

1408
01:35:25,351 --> 01:35:27,591
Like his father but a
believer in God like his mother.

1409
01:35:28,017 --> 01:35:29,842
Now Goddess,
please give me my alms.

1410
01:35:30,282 --> 01:35:31,618
I've sent you your
alms at your house..

1411
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,562
- Even before the prayers.
- What?

1412
01:35:34,763 --> 01:35:37,562
I have brought back
Shanta to your house.

1413
01:35:38,178 --> 01:35:39,178
Sister-in-law!

1414
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:40,883
And now, behave well
with each other.

1415
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:42,562
Don't embarrass me anywhere.

1416
01:36:01,919 --> 01:36:03,995
Shanta, you have come back.

1417
01:36:05,779 --> 01:36:09,044
I haven't come;
I have been brought, forcibly.

1418
01:36:09,855 --> 01:36:10,855
Forcibly.

1419
01:36:11,647 --> 01:36:12,887
There is nothing like that.

1420
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:17,367
What else? I hadn't requested
that I should be taken from there.

1421
01:36:18,367 --> 01:36:20,433
I ask you, what was the need of..

1422
01:36:20,513 --> 01:36:22,767
Threatening my parents
about a second marriage?

1423
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:25,367
You should have married
and just sent us a message.

1424
01:36:25,487 --> 01:36:26,727
Why do you say like this?

1425
01:36:27,807 --> 01:36:30,367
Whatever happened on both
sides on both the sides..

1426
01:36:30,546 --> 01:36:32,247
Please forget and forgive it.

1427
01:36:32,367 --> 01:36:34,556
See, even I have
forgotten everything.

1428
01:36:36,642 --> 01:36:41,687
You can forget it, but I cannot
forget this incident of my life.

1429
01:36:42,247 --> 01:36:43,367
Forget all that.

1430
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:48,577
Believe me, I will try to give
you every happiness of life.

1431
01:36:49,647 --> 01:36:51,767
My happiness had
been put afire the day..

1432
01:36:52,367 --> 01:36:54,687
When this
inauspicious proposal was fixed.

1433
01:36:58,247 --> 01:37:02,167
Why are you like this,
Shanta? Madhu isn't like this.

1434
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:04,367
They are so happy.

1435
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:08,167
Suresh is a poor man,
even then they have such a..

1436
01:37:08,247 --> 01:37:09,527
Poor, poor, poor.

1437
01:37:09,951 --> 01:37:13,967
He is poor, you are rich.
You have money, you have land.

1438
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:16,087
That's all that you
have learnt, isn't it?

1439
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:18,727
What is your competition
with Suresh?

1440
01:37:20,007 --> 01:37:22,210
He is a diamond and
you are a stone.

1441
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:25,367
Shanta! What are you saying?

1442
01:37:25,647 --> 01:37:29,940
I am right. To bring
infamy to that poor man..

1443
01:37:30,362 --> 01:37:32,647
You wrote that
letter and ruined my life!

1444
01:37:32,727 --> 01:37:34,647
This is false! This is false!

1445
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:38,502
Don't touch me. You are my
husband in the world's eyes..

1446
01:37:39,215 --> 01:37:41,367
- But not in mine.
- Shanta!

1447
01:37:42,367 --> 01:37:44,007
You are not only an illiterate..

1448
01:37:44,367 --> 01:37:46,367
But you are a
trickster and a wretch!

1449
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:14,767
'We went ahead in such a way..'

1450
01:38:15,367 --> 01:38:17,447
'..that they were
angered unreasonably.'

1451
01:38:18,514 --> 01:38:24,087
'I drank feeling pity on the
restlessness of this heart.'

1452
01:38:24,935 --> 01:38:29,367
'This world wasn't
accepting me since long.'

1453
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,447
'Today, I..'

1454
01:38:32,447 --> 01:38:35,447
'Today, I didn't accept this
world and therefore I drank.'

1455
01:38:39,567 --> 01:38:42,114
Younger sir, younger sir!

1456
01:38:42,287 --> 01:38:43,847
I committed a mistake,
please excuse me.

1457
01:38:47,207 --> 01:38:49,423
Younger sir, younger sir!

1458
01:39:34,367 --> 01:39:37,367
Say it again, what had you said?

1459
01:39:39,367 --> 01:39:43,087
- Why are you silent! Tell me!
- You drink too!

1460
01:39:43,509 --> 01:39:46,687
What about alcohol, today
I will drink poison too!

1461
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:49,727
Tell me, what did you wish to say?

1462
01:39:50,644 --> 01:39:52,367
Have you come to threaten me?

1463
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:55,127
I won't say it just once,
I will say it a thousand times!

1464
01:39:55,737 --> 01:39:58,927
You are an illiterate!
Trickster! Wretch!

1465
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:07,727
Shankar! Have you gone crazy!

1466
01:40:07,927 --> 01:40:09,007
What is happening?

1467
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:11,607
- Daddy, let me go!
- Dare you touch her!

1468
01:40:11,687 --> 01:40:12,823
Dare raise your hand against her.

1469
01:40:12,847 --> 01:40:14,367
What's going on?
What's wrong? Shankar.

1470
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:18,247
Let this wretch go.
It will be better if he dies.

1471
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:21,247
Daughter-in-law,
what is happening?

1472
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:23,247
What's done is done.

1473
01:40:23,509 --> 01:40:25,727
I can't live here
for even a minute more!

1474
01:40:26,167 --> 01:40:28,367
I have no relation with this house!

1475
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,567
What are you looking at?
Why don't you stop her?

1476
01:40:31,647 --> 01:40:35,087
Looking at the actions of my son,
I have no face to stop her.

1477
01:40:41,519 --> 01:40:42,519
Shanta?

1478
01:40:44,179 --> 01:40:45,941
What is the matter?
Where are you going?

1479
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:47,847
Had you brought me here for this?

1480
01:40:49,822 --> 01:40:52,007
- What is the matter?
- Driver, come on.

1481
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:58,687
What are you staring at?
Please stop the daughter in law!

1482
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:00,108
No.

1483
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,527
This unfortunate one should go.

1484
01:41:03,216 --> 01:41:04,616
After all, what has happened,
Uncle?

1485
01:41:04,827 --> 01:41:06,146
What can I tell you?

1486
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:08,507
This good for nothing son
has not let us able face anyone!

1487
01:41:08,946 --> 01:41:10,367
But what happened, uncle?

1488
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:13,043
I am ashamed even to say that that..

1489
01:41:13,843 --> 01:41:16,647
Wretch whipped the daughter in law
under intoxication.

1490
01:41:22,426 --> 01:41:26,577
What did you say? Brother-in-law
is at a courtesan's hall?

1491
01:41:27,571 --> 01:41:28,447
No.

1492
01:41:28,527 --> 01:41:31,247
The Tonga driver has
Swore and told me, Mistress.

1493
01:41:32,177 --> 01:41:33,567
Have you told anyone at home?

1494
01:41:33,917 --> 01:41:36,927
No. I came here as soon as
I heard this impossible thing.

1495
01:41:37,312 --> 01:41:39,032
So, that I could tell
Mr. Suresh about this.

1496
01:41:39,128 --> 01:41:41,247
But he is not at home.

1497
01:41:44,382 --> 01:41:45,382
Okay.

1498
01:41:51,852 --> 01:41:52,852
Come.

1499
01:41:54,004 --> 01:41:56,084
Madam! You and at such a place?

1500
01:41:56,604 --> 01:41:58,684
I am telling you so, come.

1501
01:42:19,302 --> 01:42:27,107
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1502
01:42:27,187 --> 01:42:31,924
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1503
01:42:32,004 --> 01:42:36,604
'Nor am I disloyal,
nor am I a liar.'

1504
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:41,647
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1505
01:42:55,604 --> 01:42:59,964
'I didn't get any sleep
or any rest..'

1506
01:43:00,244 --> 01:43:04,684
'I prayed for the whole night.'

1507
01:43:04,956 --> 01:43:09,604
'I didn't get any sleep
or any rest..'

1508
01:43:09,764 --> 01:43:14,444
'I prayed for the whole night.'

1509
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:22,956
'Please, may someone steal
his sleep too like this!'

1510
01:43:23,244 --> 01:43:27,964
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1511
01:43:28,044 --> 01:43:33,084
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1512
01:43:51,604 --> 01:43:56,244
'How will he not be restless,
this crazy heart?

1513
01:43:56,417 --> 01:44:00,924
'..The whole world says the truth.'

1514
01:44:01,164 --> 01:44:05,604
'How will he not be restless,
this crazy heart?

1515
01:44:05,924 --> 01:44:10,708
'..The whole world says the truth.'

1516
01:44:10,924 --> 01:44:18,924
'The love doesn't fade, even
if the one leaves the life.'

1517
01:44:19,324 --> 01:44:24,044
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1518
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:29,004
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1519
01:44:43,004 --> 01:44:47,604
'I tried to convince
him with every charm..'

1520
01:44:47,844 --> 01:44:52,324
'..but my charms
were nothing for him.'

1521
01:44:52,525 --> 01:44:57,164
'I tried to convince
him with every charm..'

1522
01:44:57,368 --> 01:45:01,764
'..but my charms
were nothing for him.'

1523
01:45:02,406 --> 01:45:10,406
'He did not agree, even if any
one's heart would be broken.'

1524
01:45:10,684 --> 01:45:15,404
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1525
01:45:15,484 --> 01:45:20,164
'Nor am I disloyal,
nor am I a liar.'

1526
01:45:20,244 --> 01:45:24,844
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1527
01:45:24,924 --> 01:45:32,164
'Oh, angry beloved, our beloved,
why are you angry?'

1528
01:45:45,404 --> 01:45:46,484
You?

1529
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,204
Sister-in-law? You?

1530
01:45:57,124 --> 01:45:59,004
Get up. Come home.

1531
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:03,484
Home?

1532
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:06,324
Yes. Diwan, please go
away from here.

1533
01:46:08,324 --> 01:46:11,239
I didn't know that because of you..

1534
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:14,604
This statue of purity
would have to come here.

1535
01:46:15,324 --> 01:46:17,001
Otherwise, even if you would have..

1536
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:19,434
Brought the wealth of
the whole world here..

1537
01:46:19,514 --> 01:46:21,604
These doors would
never have opened for you.

1538
01:46:22,604 --> 01:46:26,484
Please go. Looking at
her here, I am ashamed!

1539
01:46:46,169 --> 01:46:49,124
Enough. This is what was left now.

1540
01:46:50,484 --> 01:46:55,604
I couldn't even dream that the
person whom I revered as God..

1541
01:46:55,684 --> 01:46:57,004
He can fall till this stage.

1542
01:46:59,924 --> 01:47:03,604
Under intoxication, you
haven't whipped Shanta, but me.

1543
01:47:04,724 --> 01:47:06,804
I was the one who had
convinced and brought her back.

1544
01:47:07,324 --> 01:47:08,924
I was the one who
committed this mistake.

1545
01:47:10,491 --> 01:47:14,604
It was childishness on my side
that I kept some hope from you.

1546
01:47:15,378 --> 01:47:16,898
I thought that I had
some right on you.

1547
01:47:17,964 --> 01:47:21,844
After all, what
relation do I have with you?

1548
01:47:22,297 --> 01:47:23,937
Please don't say like this,
Sister-in-law.

1549
01:47:23,994 --> 01:47:25,754
For God's sake, please
don't speak like this.

1550
01:47:27,021 --> 01:47:30,604
You are the only one whom I call
my own in this whole world.

1551
01:47:31,984 --> 01:47:37,244
It seems that you don't know
what sorrow you have given me.

1552
01:47:38,684 --> 01:47:41,924
Sister-in-law, please forgive me.

1553
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:46,964
Don't ask forgiveness
from me, but Shanta.

1554
01:47:48,324 --> 01:47:49,484
From Shanta?

1555
01:47:49,684 --> 01:47:50,764
Yes.

1556
01:47:53,604 --> 01:47:56,604
If you have any place
in your heart for me..

1557
01:47:56,935 --> 01:47:58,695
Then go to your
in-law's place right now..

1558
01:47:58,935 --> 01:48:01,702
And ask for their
forgiveness and bring her back.

1559
01:48:01,782 --> 01:48:03,873
- But sister-in-law..
- Have you ever thought about this?

1560
01:48:03,897 --> 01:48:06,044
In a couple of days, it is
our marriage anniversary.

1561
01:48:06,884 --> 01:48:08,827
If on such an occasion,
Shanta is not with you..

1562
01:48:09,324 --> 01:48:11,008
Then what rumours will
be spread by the people?

1563
01:48:11,032 --> 01:48:15,324
And yes, let them say anything,
you will have to tolerate it.

1564
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:18,484
For my sake,
you will not answer them.

1565
01:48:26,903 --> 01:48:28,092
Please wait.

1566
01:48:30,135 --> 01:48:32,772
- Oh, Lily!
- Sister!

1567
01:48:33,151 --> 01:48:34,449
- How are you?
- I am fine.

1568
01:48:34,529 --> 01:48:36,572
You have come alone?
Where is brother-in-law?

1569
01:48:36,852 --> 01:48:40,292
How could I not come? I've been
yearning to meet my brother.

1570
01:48:40,372 --> 01:48:42,483
- Where is my brother?
- He must be coming through some train.

1571
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:43,732
You please have some lunch.

1572
01:48:43,812 --> 01:48:45,772
No sister-in-law,
I will have lunch with him then.

1573
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:47,908
Till that time, you sisters
please speak to each other.

1574
01:48:47,932 --> 01:48:49,572
I will pick him from the station.

1575
01:48:49,652 --> 01:48:51,334
See, there is so
much love between them!

1576
01:48:51,414 --> 01:48:52,450
There has to be love between them.

1577
01:48:52,474 --> 01:48:55,248
One can get another wife,
but can one get another brother?

1578
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:57,812
You have spoken exactly
to the point.

1579
01:48:58,157 --> 01:49:02,732
What's this? Even his brother
says to the pant at every word.

1580
01:49:04,253 --> 01:49:06,292
Even daddy had these words.

1581
01:49:07,508 --> 01:49:09,292
You saw your brother-in-law.

1582
01:49:09,497 --> 01:49:11,652
Some times he becomes a
bit bitter with words.

1583
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:13,572
But he is very clear of heart.

1584
01:49:13,652 --> 01:49:16,393
This is the same state of
your brother-in-law too!

1585
01:49:16,566 --> 01:49:19,292
Why shouldn't it be? After all,
their blood is one.

1586
01:49:20,372 --> 01:49:24,332
Their blood is same!
His blood had turned into water.

1587
01:49:24,572 --> 01:49:29,692
When.. I had refused, yet for a
woman he had rejected his brother!

1588
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:30,892
Munna's father!

1589
01:49:30,972 --> 01:49:32,854
Munna's father is not a kid that..

1590
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,732
He'll fall in the
trap of R.B. Rosay.

1591
01:49:35,259 --> 01:49:37,432
I told him in front
of the whole market..

1592
01:49:37,605 --> 01:49:39,292
Dare you enter my house!'

1593
01:49:39,452 --> 01:49:41,292
You insult your guest in such a way!

1594
01:49:41,703 --> 01:49:43,012
Guest? Who's the guest!

1595
01:49:43,281 --> 01:49:44,372
What else?

1596
01:49:50,924 --> 01:49:52,292
Who is this madam?

1597
01:49:52,514 --> 01:49:55,572
She is your brother's wife,
with whom you had fought!

1598
01:49:57,732 --> 01:50:00,932
Brother-in-law, please
forget what has occurred.

1599
01:50:01,681 --> 01:50:03,572
You brothers were
separated due to me..

1600
01:50:04,405 --> 01:50:06,292
Now it will be me
who will reunite you two.

1601
01:50:06,654 --> 01:50:09,205
Sister-in-law, I think
that you don't know..

1602
01:50:09,285 --> 01:50:12,052
Even God can't
reunite us two brothers.

1603
01:50:12,452 --> 01:50:16,271
This is not good.
They have come from so far..

1604
01:50:16,351 --> 01:50:19,702
Just to convince you, and you
are bent on fighting with them?

1605
01:50:20,232 --> 01:50:21,972
After all, what crime
did he commit?

1606
01:50:22,286 --> 01:50:24,292
He didn't commit
any sin by marrying me.

1607
01:50:24,804 --> 01:50:27,091
I swear, if you both compromise..

1608
01:50:27,171 --> 01:50:28,772
Then I will hunger strike and die.

1609
01:50:28,972 --> 01:50:30,999
Oh! Hunger strike!

1610
01:50:31,788 --> 01:50:34,052
Sister-in-law, this is
the question of my life.

1611
01:50:34,132 --> 01:50:35,812
Please give me some time to think.

1612
01:50:35,892 --> 01:50:39,732
You will get time.
Convince your brother and bring him!

1613
01:50:39,812 --> 01:50:41,572
How can I bring him?
In a fit of rage..

1614
01:50:41,652 --> 01:50:43,061
He went back to
Ranigarh immediately.

1615
01:50:43,085 --> 01:50:45,972
Ranigarh? He left me
all alone and went!

1616
01:50:47,372 --> 01:50:50,212
Please don't cry. I will
go to the station and see.

1617
01:50:50,572 --> 01:50:52,572
Maybe the train is a bit late.
I will bring him.

1618
01:50:52,933 --> 01:50:53,933
Please go!

1619
01:50:55,052 --> 01:50:59,572
See, sister? Didn't I tell you
that your brother-in-law..

1620
01:50:59,652 --> 01:51:02,572
Is very good at heart.
The time was just an excuse.

1621
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,138
- This purse?
- Wallet!

1622
01:51:07,372 --> 01:51:08,708
This purse Belongs to
Munna's father.

1623
01:51:08,732 --> 01:51:11,052
No, no. This purse
Belongs to Rosay's father.

1624
01:51:11,323 --> 01:51:13,852
What are you talking about,
will I not recognize his wallet too?

1625
01:51:14,155 --> 01:51:16,932
Sister, if you don't believe it,
then open it and see.

1626
01:51:17,132 --> 01:51:21,572
It will have my photo in it.
He keeps it close to his heart.

1627
01:51:21,809 --> 01:51:23,892
And if it has your photo then?

1628
01:51:24,112 --> 01:51:25,292
Then the wallet is yours.

1629
01:51:31,474 --> 01:51:33,517
See, didn't I tell you?
It has my photo.

1630
01:51:33,597 --> 01:51:35,931
See, it has my photo.

1631
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:37,938
See!

1632
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:42,890
What is this?

1633
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:45,171
There are two photos in a wallet.

1634
01:51:46,771 --> 01:51:48,738
- I had suspected this.
- What?

1635
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:53,105
Your Ram Bharose and my R.B. Rosey,
both are the same.

1636
01:51:53,931 --> 01:51:57,376
What will happen to my
six kids? What will I do?

1637
01:51:57,456 --> 01:52:02,976
There is no need to cry! Such a
cheat should be taught a lesson!

1638
01:52:03,056 --> 01:52:04,291
But how?

1639
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:11,291
Where are you running away? Don't
run away from me! Take us along.

1640
01:52:11,371 --> 01:52:13,203
She'll be the death of me,

1641
01:52:13,283 --> 01:52:14,531
Don't you feel ashamed?

1642
01:52:14,611 --> 01:52:19,291
Wretch. I'll teach you a lesson.

1643
01:52:19,371 --> 01:52:22,411
She's the sister-in-law!
Shameless. I won't spare you.

1644
01:52:22,835 --> 01:52:25,371
Please forgive me.

1645
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:28,338
Sister-in-law, please forgive me!

1646
01:52:37,697 --> 01:52:40,377
Younger Diwan! Greetings.
Please come.

1647
01:52:41,961 --> 01:52:45,537
Please come, have a seat.
I will inform upstairs.

1648
01:53:31,473 --> 01:53:33,853
I know that you are
very angry with me.

1649
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:42,213
Sir, I am embarrassed of
my actions. Forgive me.

1650
01:53:43,173 --> 01:53:47,653
Stupid rogue! Shameless!
How dare you come here!

1651
01:53:48,414 --> 01:53:50,305
Say whatever you wish.

1652
01:53:51,246 --> 01:53:54,366
For God's sake, forgive me once.

1653
01:53:55,926 --> 01:54:00,086
I am ready to ask
forgiveness from Shanta too!

1654
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:01,846
Dare you take the name of
my daughter!

1655
01:54:02,813 --> 01:54:04,954
Weren't you ashamed of
whipping my daughter..

1656
01:54:05,034 --> 01:54:06,766
Under the influence of alcohol?

1657
01:54:08,294 --> 01:54:11,796
Answer your actions! You wretch!

1658
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:13,526
Let go.

1659
01:54:14,769 --> 01:54:20,606
They may say anything! For my sake,
you won't say anything!

1660
01:54:24,283 --> 01:54:28,766
Trickster! Drunkard! Beast!

1661
01:54:29,366 --> 01:54:37,366
This is your punishment!

1662
01:54:37,846 --> 01:54:41,086
Get lost from here.
Or else I will pieces of you!

1663
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:47,549
Listen.

1664
01:54:51,852 --> 01:54:54,528
If you have any shame left in you..

1665
01:54:54,608 --> 01:54:57,862
Then with the shame
gun that you hunt animals..

1666
01:54:58,284 --> 01:55:02,846
Shoot yourself with that gun,
because you are a beast..

1667
01:55:03,322 --> 01:55:04,922
Under the guise of a human being.

1668
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:21,003
Get out!

1669
01:55:22,846 --> 01:55:23,846
Get out!

1670
01:55:40,846 --> 01:55:43,772
Daughter in law, may
your good thoughts..

1671
01:55:43,852 --> 01:55:45,132
For this house be successful.

1672
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,246
Otherwise, the matter has worsened.

1673
01:55:48,846 --> 01:55:53,166
Please don't worry. Shankar will
come with his wife by evening.

1674
01:55:53,495 --> 01:55:55,015
May your mouth have
sweets in you, son.

1675
01:55:56,187 --> 01:55:58,366
By your arrival,
I have got some courage.

1676
01:55:59,366 --> 01:56:00,726
Your mother has come too,
isn't it?

1677
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:03,606
- Yes.
- It is the first Anniversary of their.. marriage.

1678
01:56:03,959 --> 01:56:04,959
How could she resist?

1679
01:56:05,006 --> 01:56:07,006
I ask you, with which
face had you gone there?

1680
01:56:07,483 --> 01:56:11,006
Which honest man will send his
daughter with such a wretch?

1681
01:56:12,143 --> 01:56:15,366
With your actions,
you haven't ruined yourself..

1682
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:17,606
But you have
drowned us with you too.

1683
01:56:18,166 --> 01:56:20,552
You have turned the family's
dignity into ashes forever.

1684
01:56:21,086 --> 01:56:24,671
I am shocked. How did
you have the courage..

1685
01:56:24,995 --> 01:56:27,435
To walk into this house even
after doing such an evil task.

1686
01:56:27,966 --> 01:56:30,486
Why didn't a devil such as
you die as soon as he was born?

1687
01:56:30,801 --> 01:56:31,846
What are you saying?

1688
01:56:32,055 --> 01:56:36,366
I am right. Before this, has
anyone drunk in our family?

1689
01:56:37,086 --> 01:56:38,606
Has any one gone to
a courtesan's hall?

1690
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:40,646
Has anyone raised
his hand on a woman?

1691
01:56:41,246 --> 01:56:42,526
Has any one tricked his brother?

1692
01:56:43,494 --> 01:56:44,526
Tricked?

1693
01:56:45,007 --> 01:56:47,166
Yes, child.
How can I tell you this?

1694
01:56:47,818 --> 01:56:50,366
That the girl that he had gone
to see for his brother Suresh..

1695
01:56:50,618 --> 01:56:52,086
He changed his
intentions for her.

1696
01:56:52,766 --> 01:56:53,699
Daddy!

1697
01:56:53,779 --> 01:56:57,526
To achieve that girl, he wrote
a fake letter against Suresh.

1698
01:56:58,166 --> 01:57:01,806
I swear upon God,
That letter wasn't..

1699
01:57:01,886 --> 01:57:03,086
Wasn't written by you.

1700
01:57:03,166 --> 01:57:04,646
That's what you want to say,
isn't it?

1701
01:57:05,223 --> 01:57:07,446
So, has Suresh written this
letter against him himself?

1702
01:57:08,866 --> 01:57:12,566
If you have any self respect
left then go away from here.

1703
01:57:13,699 --> 01:57:16,566
And drown yourself somewhere.
I hate your face!

1704
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:20,446
Shankar, my son!

1705
01:57:20,651 --> 01:57:22,606
That is not your son.
He is your son.

1706
01:57:23,765 --> 01:57:25,646
He has won our heart
with his honesty.

1707
01:57:27,787 --> 01:57:29,366
But how can you say this?

1708
01:57:29,668 --> 01:57:33,566
Do you forget, I am a hand writing
expert as well as lawyer?

1709
01:57:34,366 --> 01:57:36,110
As soon as I compared this letter..

1710
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:37,926
With the other letters written..

1711
01:57:38,006 --> 01:57:39,422
By Suresh, I immediately
understood that he..

1712
01:57:39,446 --> 01:57:40,582
Had written this
anonymous letter.

1713
01:57:40,606 --> 01:57:42,726
But why will Suresh
need to do this?

1714
01:57:43,246 --> 01:57:46,366
You are very simple mother.
It is a clear cut case.

1715
01:57:46,846 --> 01:57:49,126
Suresh had come to
see Madhu for Shankar.

1716
01:57:49,206 --> 01:57:51,246
- Yes.
- But he liked Madhu.

1717
01:57:51,711 --> 01:57:55,366
Therefore to stop our
proposal he wrote this letter to us.

1718
01:57:55,966 --> 01:57:58,781
Just like that, to stop
his proposal with Shanta..

1719
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:00,526
He wrote a similar
letter to them.

1720
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:06,111
And I was silent till today,
because Madhu was happy..

1721
01:58:06,191 --> 01:58:09,366
In her house, why should
I put you in unnecessary worry?

1722
01:58:10,478 --> 01:58:13,138
But today, seeing the Injustice
that was being done on Shankar..

1723
01:58:13,321 --> 01:58:15,441
And Suresh's silence on
this issue I felt very bad.

1724
01:58:16,035 --> 01:58:17,446
He should
have accepted his mistake.

1725
01:58:17,526 --> 01:58:19,366
You are crazy, Gopi.

1726
01:58:19,446 --> 01:58:21,383
When a wall of enmity has been
erected between the two families..

1727
01:58:21,407 --> 01:58:22,929
Do you think that it
will be demolished..

1728
01:58:22,953 --> 01:58:24,673
By Suresh's
confession about his mistake?

1729
01:58:25,366 --> 01:58:27,886
Will they be able to forget
Shankar's action of beating Shanta..

1730
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:29,222
And that too under intoxication?

1731
01:58:29,246 --> 01:58:30,486
And will they send Shanta back?

1732
01:58:32,305 --> 01:58:34,726
It is better to
forget what has happened.

1733
01:58:35,166 --> 01:58:37,406
Otherwise, the matter that
has worsened won't be mended..

1734
01:58:37,446 --> 01:58:39,366
And even what is going
right will be worsened.

1735
01:58:39,726 --> 01:58:41,366
Shankar himself has
worsened the matter.

1736
01:58:42,126 --> 01:58:43,486
What can we do in this?

1737
01:58:45,366 --> 01:58:47,418
I don't know why.

1738
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:50,246
My mind still doesn't believe that
brother-in-law is guilty.

1739
01:58:50,542 --> 01:58:52,006
What is difficult to believe in it?

1740
01:58:52,673 --> 01:58:54,926
Your brother-in-law is a man,
he is not an angel.

1741
01:58:55,808 --> 01:58:58,566
He had gone to see a girl
for me. He liked the girl.

1742
01:58:59,224 --> 01:59:01,384
Helpless under the force of love,
he wrote this letter.

1743
01:59:01,819 --> 01:59:04,806
At the most, this can be
called a small mistake of youth.

1744
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:06,819
What do you say, Gopi?

1745
01:59:08,781 --> 01:59:11,949
Yes. Whether the
mistake is big or small..

1746
01:59:12,425 --> 01:59:14,086
That can be found
out by it's result.

1747
01:59:14,846 --> 01:59:19,366
Sometimes, even a small spark
turns the whole house into ash.

1748
01:59:19,895 --> 01:59:23,246
Sir, The Diwan wishes
to meet you right now.

1749
01:59:24,006 --> 01:59:28,319
Right now? I will be back.
Please come.

1750
01:59:30,557 --> 01:59:33,887
Please come, Gopinath.
Sit.

1751
01:59:35,973 --> 01:59:37,498
I'm sorry that I gave you the trouble.

1752
01:59:37,735 --> 01:59:39,800
What is the trouble? Please order me.

1753
01:59:40,092 --> 01:59:45,065
Actually the thing is that
I wish to write a will through you.

1754
01:59:46,589 --> 01:59:49,693
The objective of giving you
the trouble is just this..

1755
01:59:51,282 --> 01:59:53,613
That the matter of the
house shouldn't go outside.

1756
01:59:53,887 --> 01:59:54,933
Be rest assured.

1757
01:59:56,741 --> 02:00:00,693
Disowning my son Shankar..

1758
02:00:00,773 --> 02:00:05,693
I want to name my whole
property to my nephew Suresh.

1759
02:00:07,238 --> 02:00:08,238
What?

1760
02:00:08,838 --> 02:00:10,968
I knew that you would be shocked.

1761
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:14,180
But what I can tell you?

1762
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:17,300
If one doesn't have a child,
he has one sorrow.

1763
02:00:18,113 --> 02:00:20,233
If the child dies after being,
he has hundred sorrows.

1764
02:00:21,302 --> 02:00:25,180
If the child is a good for nothing
there is no end to sorrows.

1765
02:00:26,101 --> 02:00:29,900
Mr. Gopinath, what sorrow this
good for nothing not given me?

1766
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:32,489
Just for his lust..

1767
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:36,340
He wrote a false letter against his
brother and.. killed his faith.

1768
02:00:36,856 --> 02:00:40,980
Through is actions, he
made me look like a wretch!

1769
02:00:41,483 --> 02:00:43,620
He turned the respect
of this house into dust!

1770
02:00:44,856 --> 02:00:50,737
Tell me, what intimacy
can I have for such a son?

1771
02:00:52,218 --> 02:00:56,180
But sometimes,
it happens that what..

1772
02:00:56,629 --> 02:01:00,585
We see is not fact,
and what is a fact, we don't see.

1773
02:01:00,665 --> 02:01:02,900
I'm telling what
has happened to me.

1774
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:05,700
If this is not the truth,
then tell me what the truth is.

1775
02:01:07,526 --> 02:01:08,820
What can I tell you?

1776
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:11,820
The matter is such
that I can't say anything.

1777
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:17,180
I've taken this decision
after thinking for a long time.

1778
02:01:17,797 --> 02:01:19,624
You please start making the will..

1779
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:23,180
I will have peace after my death.

1780
02:01:23,592 --> 02:01:27,900
That I gave the property of
my ancestors in safe hands.

1781
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:30,540
As you wish.

1782
02:01:32,899 --> 02:01:34,260
What are you saying?

1783
02:01:34,921 --> 02:01:37,569
So, was all this
just my misconception?

1784
02:01:37,818 --> 02:01:41,472
Yes, Shanta, I couldn't hold
this secret any longer..

1785
02:01:42,056 --> 02:01:44,180
Seeing both of your
lives getting ruined.

1786
02:01:45,007 --> 02:01:47,900
Otherwise, I would never
have told you anything.

1787
02:01:48,629 --> 02:01:51,820
Promise me, that you won't tell
anything about this to anyone.

1788
02:01:52,099 --> 02:01:57,180
Otherwise, settling your house
I may ruin my sister's house.

1789
02:01:57,461 --> 02:01:59,940
No. Please don't say like this.

1790
02:02:02,013 --> 02:02:05,180
Oh, God! What can I do?

1791
02:02:06,909 --> 02:02:09,180
How can I face him?

1792
02:02:09,742 --> 02:02:12,180
Forget and forgive what
occurred and think further.

1793
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:13,796
And as soon as you get
permission from the doctor..

1794
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:15,060
Please go and meet him.

1795
02:02:16,358 --> 02:02:21,700
Due to this misconception,
I befell so many problems on him.

1796
02:02:22,585 --> 02:02:25,180
I don't know what state he must be in.

1797
02:02:25,795 --> 02:02:28,260
His state has forced me
to come here.

1798
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:32,980
Seeing him, I feel that he isn't
alive but is a walking corpse.

1799
02:02:37,104 --> 02:02:39,180
If you have any self respect,
then..

1800
02:02:39,752 --> 02:02:42,867
With the gun that
you hunt animals..

1801
02:02:43,385 --> 02:02:45,780
Shoot yourself
with that same gun.

1802
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:49,580
Because, you are a beast in
the guise of a human being.

1803
02:02:49,861 --> 02:02:53,180
You are a beast in the
guise of a human being

1804
02:02:53,732 --> 02:02:57,060
You are a beast in the
guise of a human being

1805
02:02:57,959 --> 02:03:01,180
You are a beast in the
guise of a human being

1806
02:03:18,478 --> 02:03:21,829
If you have any self respect, then..

1807
02:03:22,002 --> 02:03:24,770
Kill yourself, drown yourself!

1808
02:03:24,850 --> 02:03:27,740
Kill yourself, drown yourself!

1809
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:34,315
Kill yourself, drown yourself!

1810
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:43,180
Wait, Shankar, the world
may think anything about you.

1811
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:46,420
But would you want to
fall in the eyes of Madhu?

1812
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:49,180
Can you tolerate,
after your death..

1813
02:03:49,504 --> 02:03:51,180
She will tremble
thinking of you?

1814
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:55,300
Under the pretext of this
anniversary, I could meet you.

1815
02:03:55,677 --> 02:03:58,220
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you too.

1816
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:00,340
All this is due to your generosity.

1817
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:02,940
- Please take this.
- No, we will leave now.

1818
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:05,580
- At least have this sweet.
- What is this?

1819
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:07,340
Please sit for some time.

1820
02:04:08,066 --> 02:04:11,740
Son, it doesn't look right
for us to sit amongst children.

1821
02:04:12,045 --> 02:04:15,380
You sit and have fun, we
came to give our blessings.

1822
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:19,900
May God protect you both, and
you see this occasion again.

1823
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:31,180
- Greetings, Diwan.
- Greetings.

1824
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:36,940
Younger Diwan?

1825
02:04:38,045 --> 02:04:39,260
Where is sister-in-law?

1826
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,260
She is in the party.
Should I call her?

1827
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:45,340
No, let it be. I will wait for her.

1828
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:53,260
Please shut this down.

1829
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:04,420
- Ramu. - Yes.
- Where is Mr. Suresh? Is he in the party?

1830
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:06,260
No. He was here, just a moment ago.

1831
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:26,180
Suresh, the
anonymous letter that you..

1832
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,456
Had written against Shankar..

1833
02:05:28,536 --> 02:05:30,820
I am returning
it to you as a present.

1834
02:05:32,705 --> 02:05:34,820
Because today is the
anniversary of your marriage.

1835
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:40,781
But I'm sorry that the
letter that you wrote..

1836
02:05:41,548 --> 02:05:45,484
Against yourself, I can't
present it because you tore it.

1837
02:05:47,106 --> 02:05:49,074
Can you prove it wrong that you..

1838
02:05:49,154 --> 02:05:51,700
Played this drama to marry Madhu?

1839
02:05:52,856 --> 02:05:55,862
But Suresh,
the spark that you released..

1840
02:05:56,046 --> 02:05:59,148
Has become a fire today
and is going to burn one's house!

1841
02:06:00,727 --> 02:06:03,830
The Diwan has decided
to disown the..

1842
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:08,824
Innocent Shankar and
to make you his heir.

1843
02:06:10,219 --> 02:06:13,715
I had to prepare the will
according to his orders.

1844
02:06:14,425 --> 02:06:19,155
But my conscience doesn't
allow me to give him this will.

1845
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:25,847
Here is the will, in which an
innocent person is being killed.

1846
02:06:26,647 --> 02:06:30,207
And here is the letter, which
is shrieking out your crime.

1847
02:06:31,767 --> 02:06:33,487
I leave this decision on you.

1848
02:06:34,207 --> 02:06:38,687
You may take either
this letter or this will.

1849
02:06:40,207 --> 02:06:44,527
But remember, these are not two
pieces of paper in front of you.

1850
02:06:45,207 --> 02:06:47,087
They are the two paths of life.

1851
02:06:47,847 --> 02:06:50,007
On one side, there is
the palace of money..

1852
02:06:50,695 --> 02:06:53,207
Whose base is built on
the dead body of friendship..

1853
02:06:53,409 --> 02:06:55,889
Whereas on the other hand
there is repentance of your sins..

1854
02:06:55,927 --> 02:06:59,701
And such a repentance which
shall be praised by mankind.

1855
02:07:20,447 --> 02:07:22,327
I know him very well.

1856
02:07:22,944 --> 02:07:25,727
He is a drunkard and a
gambler of the first order.

1857
02:07:26,207 --> 02:07:28,327
Whatever bad habits can be
found in a rich man's son..

1858
02:07:28,673 --> 02:07:30,087
Can be found in Shankar.

1859
02:07:33,581 --> 02:07:36,927
That girl is not worth you
under any circumstances.

1860
02:07:37,106 --> 02:07:39,367
Think once more, this is
the question of your life.

1861
02:07:40,647 --> 02:07:41,727
It may be.

1862
02:07:43,246 --> 02:07:46,007
My life is not more
important ten uncle's dignity.

1863
02:07:47,257 --> 02:07:48,967
He has reared me like his son.

1864
02:07:49,279 --> 02:07:50,287
What did you do?

1865
02:07:50,728 --> 02:07:52,488
Don't listen if
someone says something wrong.

1866
02:07:53,207 --> 02:07:55,207
Forget and forgive if
someone does any thing wrong.

1867
02:08:00,207 --> 02:08:04,513
Friends, in front of you,
the most interesting item..

1868
02:08:04,686 --> 02:08:07,527
Of today's program shall
be presented to you now.

1869
02:08:08,087 --> 02:08:10,247
And that item is a song.

1870
02:08:11,007 --> 02:08:13,647
And the name of the
person who'll sing.. wait.

1871
02:08:14,015 --> 02:08:15,727
The name shall be
told by this spot light.

1872
02:08:16,491 --> 02:08:17,491
What do you mean?

1873
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:20,727
I mean, that all the
lights shall be put off..

1874
02:08:21,007 --> 02:08:23,207
And this spot light
shall be moved around.

1875
02:08:23,647 --> 02:08:25,207
On whomsoever this light shall fall..

1876
02:08:25,287 --> 02:08:27,327
He or she will have to sing.

1877
02:08:27,647 --> 02:08:29,327
If he doesn't he to sing then?

1878
02:08:29,776 --> 02:08:31,087
Then he can cry and show.

1879
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,567
The meaning is to entertain.

1880
02:08:34,879 --> 02:08:37,788
Yes, put off the
lights and move the light.

1881
02:08:46,287 --> 02:08:47,885
You. No, no.

1882
02:08:48,058 --> 02:08:49,727
- He's absolutely..
- Hurrah.

1883
02:08:54,687 --> 02:08:56,087
Come on, my friend.

1884
02:08:57,259 --> 02:08:58,847
Welcome.

1885
02:09:02,607 --> 02:09:03,994
Welcome.

1886
02:09:19,986 --> 02:09:27,986
'Why did the spring loot my
garden and blame the breeze?'

1887
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:40,330
'Someone did enmity with me..'

1888
02:09:40,687 --> 02:09:46,986
'..why he gives the
name of friendship?'

1889
02:09:47,497 --> 02:09:54,106
"Spring by looting my garden."

1890
02:10:08,308 --> 02:10:15,226
'I didn't understand, my friend..'

1891
02:10:15,411 --> 02:10:21,986
'..why did I get this punishment?'

1892
02:10:22,308 --> 02:10:28,706
'Why did I get this punishment?'

1893
02:10:29,011 --> 02:10:35,986
"My friend snatched
my smile from my lips..'

1894
02:10:36,066 --> 02:10:42,226
'..and gave it as a
drink to someone else?"

1895
02:10:42,891 --> 02:10:49,866
"Spring by looting my garden."

1896
02:11:03,386 --> 02:11:10,465
'I didn't know that in love..'

1897
02:11:10,545 --> 02:11:16,986
'Nature plundered
my garden of joy.'

1898
02:11:17,066 --> 02:11:23,306
'Nature plundered
my garden of joy.'

1899
02:11:23,866 --> 02:11:30,266
'I committed a mistake,
my messenger.'

1900
02:11:30,571 --> 02:11:36,986
'Why did I send
a message through you'

1901
02:11:37,372 --> 02:11:44,118
"Spring by looting my garden."

1902
02:11:57,729 --> 02:12:05,098
'Oh, God! I have heard many..'

1903
02:12:05,178 --> 02:12:11,186
'..stories of your justice but..'

1904
02:12:11,361 --> 02:12:17,782
'..stories of your justice but..'

1905
02:12:18,053 --> 02:12:26,053
'Why did you reward the
guilty in lieu of the innocent?'

1906
02:12:31,502 --> 02:12:39,502
'Why did the spring loot my
garden and blame the breeze?'

1907
02:12:45,017 --> 02:12:51,590
'Someone did enmity with me..'

1908
02:12:51,670 --> 02:12:58,401
'..why he gives the
name of friendship?'

1909
02:12:58,906 --> 02:13:05,187
Once more.

1910
02:13:05,565 --> 02:13:12,495
Once more.

1911
02:13:14,495 --> 02:13:17,375
- Why did you just come like that?
- Just like that.

1912
02:13:18,581 --> 02:13:20,781
I think that you couldn't
tolerate the pain in the song.

1913
02:13:23,815 --> 02:13:26,135
You have a very emotional heart.

1914
02:13:26,322 --> 02:13:30,615
Therefore, to save the respect
of our house, you married Madhu.

1915
02:13:30,775 --> 02:13:32,535
Against your wishes.

1916
02:13:35,987 --> 02:13:37,598
I know Shankar very well.

1917
02:13:38,074 --> 02:13:41,015
He is a drunkard, gambler and
an evil man of the first order.

1918
02:13:41,815 --> 02:13:45,735
He has all the vices that are
possible in the son of a rich man.

1919
02:13:46,269 --> 02:13:47,815
I have completed my duty.

1920
02:13:49,255 --> 02:13:52,375
Wow! You have completed
your duty very nicely.

1921
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:53,295
Shankar brother!

1922
02:13:53,375 --> 02:13:57,175
Silent! Don't disregard
the pure name of a brother.

1923
02:13:57,615 --> 02:13:58,935
Why are you trembling now?

1924
02:13:59,375 --> 02:14:02,275
Why didn't these hands
tremble when you were writing..

1925
02:14:02,355 --> 02:14:04,551
These letters and rubbing
what was written in my fate when..

1926
02:14:04,575 --> 02:14:07,735
You were killing my belief,
and strangling my friendship!

1927
02:14:08,582 --> 02:14:13,495
Suresh, I'm not sad that
you snatched my happiness.

1928
02:14:13,775 --> 02:14:17,815
I am not sad that
I was falsely accused.

1929
02:14:18,269 --> 02:14:20,255
And I fell in the
eyes of my own people.

1930
02:14:20,815 --> 02:14:24,375
I am just sad that the
person who changed..

1931
02:14:24,455 --> 02:14:28,095
My life from heaven to
hell is none else but my friend!

1932
02:14:29,059 --> 02:14:30,495
My closet friend!

1933
02:14:30,855 --> 02:14:33,168
Please forgive me Shankar,
please forgive me!

1934
02:14:34,255 --> 02:14:37,175
A man's murderer can be forgiven..

1935
02:14:37,482 --> 02:14:40,735
But humanity's murderer
cannot be forgiven.

1936
02:14:42,415 --> 02:14:45,255
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

1937
02:14:45,975 --> 02:14:50,415
For a fallen man like you, death
isn't a punishment, its freedom.

1938
02:14:51,255 --> 02:14:54,375
I wish that, the fire of
hell in which I have been..

1939
02:14:54,455 --> 02:14:58,095
Burning till day, even you
should feel it's flames a bit.

1940
02:14:58,375 --> 02:15:02,150
Come with me, and
confess the your misdeeds..

1941
02:15:02,529 --> 02:15:06,095
So that you have the blot
on your head which is on mine.

1942
02:15:06,655 --> 02:15:09,135
- What are you staring at, come with me!
- Suresh!

1943
02:15:09,966 --> 02:15:11,431
Suresh is not such a
fool that he will..

1944
02:15:11,455 --> 02:15:13,615
Keep of his
destruction in his enemies hands.

1945
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:15,495
Give me that letter!

1946
02:15:15,782 --> 02:15:18,095
Otherwise, I will shoot you!

1947
02:15:19,026 --> 02:15:22,775
Thank you. I am very happy
meeting the real Suresh.

1948
02:15:23,696 --> 02:15:26,136
I don't know which stranger
I regarded as my friend till date.

1949
02:15:26,255 --> 02:15:27,375
Don't talk rubbish.

1950
02:15:30,442 --> 02:15:31,615
Keep it there.

1951
02:16:06,455 --> 02:16:07,535
No!

1952
02:16:37,316 --> 02:16:38,454
No!

1953
02:16:50,934 --> 02:16:56,014
No! No!

1954
02:16:58,375 --> 02:17:02,375
Give me this blessing,
that when I go from this world..

1955
02:17:03,165 --> 02:17:04,431
Then I should go with
henna on my forehead..

1956
02:17:04,455 --> 02:17:06,015
And bangles in my hand.

1957
02:17:27,074 --> 02:17:28,895
No, no!

1958
02:18:37,624 --> 02:18:39,495
Hey, I think that he has gone mad!

1959
02:18:47,494 --> 02:18:50,997
God! Your magic!
Only you can see it!

1960
02:18:51,076 --> 02:18:53,534
Mr. Superintendent,
what do you think?

1961
02:18:54,055 --> 02:18:55,735
Till what time will be cured?

1962
02:18:56,014 --> 02:18:57,320
It is difficult to say anything.

1963
02:18:57,516 --> 02:19:01,255
If possible he will be cured within
two months or it may take a year.

1964
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:28,575
God has heard my prayers.

1965
02:19:29,181 --> 02:19:32,015
Your murderer is released from the
mental asylum today.

1966
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:35,694
I will avenge your
murder from him now.

1967
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:40,815
Till the time I don't see my
husband's murderer hanged..

1968
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:44,335
My soul will never find any rest.

1969
02:19:44,455 --> 02:19:47,215
Madhu, what state have
you made of yourself?

1970
02:19:47,455 --> 02:19:48,631
You don't have the sense
of eating and drinking..

1971
02:19:48,655 --> 02:19:50,238
Nor do you have
any comfortable sleep.

1972
02:19:50,262 --> 02:19:53,815
If this continues,
I fear that you will go crazy.

1973
02:19:54,673 --> 02:19:57,900
Mother, if that
murderer wouldn't be caught..

1974
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:59,295
Then I would have gone crazy.

1975
02:20:00,856 --> 02:20:02,815
But now I am waiting
for that moment..

1976
02:20:04,068 --> 02:20:06,295
When the noose
will be around his neck.

1977
02:20:06,415 --> 02:20:09,105
Has your heart found
peace after putting..

1978
02:20:09,635 --> 02:20:11,075
An innocent man in a prison cell?

1979
02:20:12,024 --> 02:20:13,975
Has the blot from your
forehead been washed?

1980
02:20:15,441 --> 02:20:17,935
Isn't your family
honour restored now?

1981
02:20:19,041 --> 02:20:21,869
Thakur, hasn't the
name of your family..

1982
02:20:21,949 --> 02:20:24,655
Become glowing by saving
your daughter from a illiterate?

1983
02:20:26,155 --> 02:20:29,295
Why are you silent? Why
don't you say something?

1984
02:20:30,555 --> 02:20:33,455
You people accused him
to your heart's content.

1985
02:20:34,057 --> 02:20:38,215
You people are
responsible for his destruction.

1986
02:20:39,775 --> 02:20:43,095
Your injustice has forced him
into the jaws of death.

1987
02:20:43,255 --> 02:20:45,015
Have some courage,
Sister, have some courage.

1988
02:20:46,165 --> 02:20:47,615
How can I have?

1989
02:20:48,035 --> 02:20:51,695
Tell them to give me
back the apple of my eye.

1990
02:20:52,057 --> 02:20:53,097
Please have some patience.

1991
02:20:53,735 --> 02:20:55,775
At this time, we should
explain everything to Madhu.

1992
02:20:56,242 --> 02:20:59,095
If she agrees then
Shankar can survive.

1993
02:21:00,717 --> 02:21:02,055
Please take me to her.

1994
02:21:02,836 --> 02:21:06,642
I am sure that she
will never loot my love.

1995
02:21:07,129 --> 02:21:09,615
She will never hurt me.

1996
02:21:10,415 --> 02:21:14,978
For God's sake, take me to her.

1997
02:21:20,004 --> 02:21:23,334
Shankar's parents
have come to meet Madhu.

1998
02:21:23,918 --> 02:21:27,958
I don't want to meet anybody.
I don't want to meet anybody.

1999
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:29,878
Tell them to go away!

2000
02:21:30,285 --> 02:21:35,718
Please don't worry.
Nobody will trouble you.

2001
02:21:37,518 --> 02:21:41,878
You know what she is going
through since a year now.

2002
02:21:43,398 --> 02:21:44,838
What state she is in.

2003
02:21:45,712 --> 02:21:50,878
Nor oil in the hair, not any comb,
nor any sense of food.

2004
02:21:51,691 --> 02:21:53,108
Does she have any less
sorrows since the beginning..

2005
02:21:53,132 --> 02:21:54,373
That they have come to
trouble her again.

2006
02:21:54,397 --> 02:21:55,485
Why didn't you tell them?

2007
02:21:55,565 --> 02:21:59,158
I told them everything. But who can
convince a mother's love.

2008
02:21:59,550 --> 02:22:03,158
Now, even they know, Shankar
hadn't written those letters.

2009
02:22:03,598 --> 02:22:05,388
Even Madhu knows that Shankar..

2010
02:22:05,468 --> 02:22:07,868
Hadn't written those letters,
but Suresh had written them.

2011
02:22:08,113 --> 02:22:10,217
But what is the
answer to Madhu's words..

2012
02:22:10,297 --> 02:22:13,518
That Shankar has killed
her husband in front of her.

2013
02:22:31,854 --> 02:22:37,118
I know, Mr. Gopinath, what
is going on in her heart.

2014
02:22:38,318 --> 02:22:42,434
I just wanted to say,
that Suresh and Shankar..

2015
02:22:42,514 --> 02:22:44,158
The two bright stars of
this family.

2016
02:22:45,346 --> 02:22:47,678
One was extinguished
by nature's storm.

2017
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:50,398
And the other one is blinking too.

2018
02:22:51,314 --> 02:22:53,518
If Madhu doesn't change
her decision..

2019
02:22:54,212 --> 02:22:56,516
Then there is no doubt that
this light will extinguish too.

2020
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:58,536
Please don't say like this!
For Gods sake!

2021
02:22:58,616 --> 02:23:03,598
I am full sympathies
with you. But what can I do?

2022
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:06,238
The one who was Goddess
Durga till yesterday..

2023
02:23:07,318 --> 02:23:08,798
Has become the Goddess Kali today.

2024
02:23:08,958 --> 02:23:10,518
Do anything that you can,
Mr. Gopinath..

2025
02:23:11,109 --> 02:23:12,910
Otherwise, the name of this family..

2026
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:14,598
Will drown into darkness for ever.

2027
02:23:15,509 --> 02:23:18,598
There will be no
family name, no family!

2028
02:23:18,795 --> 02:23:22,638
No. This can't happen.
I won't let this happen.

2029
02:23:23,477 --> 02:23:24,918
I will go to Madhu.

2030
02:23:25,369 --> 02:23:28,398
I will request her,
I will fall at her feet.

2031
02:23:28,828 --> 02:23:31,598
I will beg her for my child's life.

2032
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:36,238
I have faith that she
won't disappoint me.

2033
02:23:36,881 --> 02:23:40,232
She will never disappoint me!
Madhu!

2034
02:23:41,951 --> 02:23:45,638
Madhu, Open the door, Madhu!

2035
02:23:46,783 --> 02:23:48,463
Open the door, Madhu!

2036
02:23:49,463 --> 02:23:52,703
Madhu, you have always wished
for the good of this house.

2037
02:23:53,629 --> 02:23:55,434
Please don't be
so hard hearted today.

2038
02:23:55,758 --> 02:23:58,018
Please have some mercy on my love.

2039
02:23:59,423 --> 02:24:06,785
Save the dignity of this family
from drowning. Open the door!

2040
02:24:12,752 --> 02:24:13,974
Shanta!

2041
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:22,320
You?

2042
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:25,040
I should have been here.

2043
02:24:26,309 --> 02:24:28,440
I am the root of this destruction.

2044
02:24:29,207 --> 02:24:34,028
Instead of worshipping a God,
I have insulted him.

2045
02:24:35,142 --> 02:24:39,800
God, please give me a
chance to repent for this sin.

2046
02:24:41,001 --> 02:24:43,320
That day will never
come again, Shanta.

2047
02:24:43,931 --> 02:24:46,000
No. Please don't say like this.

2048
02:24:47,391 --> 02:24:50,880
I will go in the court
and say that I am guilty.

2049
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:52,680
I was the one
who should be punished.

2050
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:59,280
It is nobody's fault.
It is the fault of my deeds.

2051
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:02,018
Who else can be
as unfortunate as me..

2052
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:06,160
Who couldn't do anything for
himself as well as for others.

2053
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:10,440
The sister-in-law who
did so many things for me..

2054
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,560
I washed away her vermillion!

2055
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:17,720
I should die.
Shanta, I should die.

2056
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,000
Please don't say like this.

2057
02:25:19,402 --> 02:25:21,906
Yes, at least by my death,
sister-in-law..

2058
02:25:21,986 --> 02:25:24,200
Will get revenge for
her husband's death.

2059
02:25:24,883 --> 02:25:26,800
Her soul will get
some peace at least.

2060
02:25:33,305 --> 02:25:34,560
Please don't cry, Shanta.

2061
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,965
Tears can't wash away what
is written in the fate..

2062
02:25:39,045 --> 02:25:41,560
It can't be washed away.

2063
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:46,560
This person is a common
criminal in the eyes of law.

2064
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:49,440
The maximum punishment
he can get is death.

2065
02:25:49,999 --> 02:25:51,680
But in the eyes of
society and humanity..

2066
02:25:52,194 --> 02:25:55,560
The punishment of death is
nothing for such a criminal.

2067
02:25:56,173 --> 02:25:58,680
Your honour, and members
of the honourable jury..

2068
02:25:58,919 --> 02:26:01,680
This man isn't just the
murderer of a innocent man..

2069
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:03,720
But he is a murderer
of a good friend too!

2070
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:05,591
He is the murderer of a
brother who was God incarnate!

2071
02:26:05,615 --> 02:26:07,332
And he is the murderer of
the husband of such a Goddess..

2072
02:26:07,356 --> 02:26:09,560
How is no one else,
but his sister-in-law.

2073
02:26:10,130 --> 02:26:13,135
Such a sister-in-law
who always tried hard..

2074
02:26:13,308 --> 02:26:16,984
For his happiness, but
this ingrate brother-in-law..

2075
02:26:17,871 --> 02:26:19,920
In what way did he
repay her good deeds?

2076
02:26:20,325 --> 02:26:22,560
He killed her husband
in front of her eyes.

2077
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:25,800
- He made her a widow.
- Shoot him on the road!

2078
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:32,022
- Order, order!
- Your Honour. This is true, that the eye witness..

2079
02:26:32,368 --> 02:26:34,888
Of Suresh's terrible murder is
only his wife and nobody else.

2080
02:26:34,962 --> 02:26:36,680
But according to the police report..

2081
02:26:36,973 --> 02:26:39,154
Finding the accused
person's gun at the crime scene..

2082
02:26:39,178 --> 02:26:42,552
And getting the accused
person's finger prints on the gun..

2083
02:26:42,898 --> 02:26:45,560
And after the murder,
the accused sudden disappearance.

2084
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:49,760
All these incidents show
that the accused is guilty.

2085
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:51,680
And, other than
these legal aspects..

2086
02:26:52,098 --> 02:26:53,736
The personal character of
the accused shrieks out that..

2087
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:55,760
The accused is guilty
of the murder.

2088
02:26:56,360 --> 02:27:01,080
Suresh was an educated
and intelligent man.

2089
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:05,800
Whereas Shankar was a first
rate illiterate and hot headed.

2090
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:10,086
His work was kill
beasts day in and day out..

2091
02:27:10,303 --> 02:27:12,200
And quench the
thirst of his bestiality.

2092
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:15,805
And as it increased, his
bestiality increased so much..

2093
02:27:16,086 --> 02:27:18,760
That he thought that
men were beasts too!

2094
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:20,876
Under the influence of alcohol..

2095
02:27:21,092 --> 02:27:25,280
He had rained lashes on his
innocent and servile wife.

2096
02:27:26,529 --> 02:27:30,487
Your honour. What can be
more proof of the accused fall..

2097
02:27:30,703 --> 02:27:33,589
That his own
father had disowned him and..

2098
02:27:33,669 --> 02:27:37,120
Named his nephew
as his legal heir?

2099
02:27:37,903 --> 02:27:40,680
This beast couldn't tolerate
Suresh's successful life..

2100
02:27:40,865 --> 02:27:43,800
In front of his
unsuccessful and useless life.

2101
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:46,390
And one day, burning in
the fire of ambition..

2102
02:27:46,470 --> 02:27:49,440
He made his brother
the aim of his bullet.

2103
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:52,872
And he spilt ink on
the pure relation..

2104
02:27:52,952 --> 02:27:55,560
Of sister-in-law, brother-in-law,
and friendship for ever.

2105
02:27:55,883 --> 02:27:58,305
Your Honour,
and members of the Jury..

2106
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:00,680
Now, for the complete
satisfaction of the court..

2107
02:28:00,932 --> 02:28:02,867
I will present the
widow of late Mr. Suresh..

2108
02:28:03,116 --> 02:28:06,895
Who has seen her husband
being shot with her own eyes..

2109
02:28:06,975 --> 02:28:10,986
And who has seen her
husband dying a terrible death.

2110
02:28:14,035 --> 02:28:16,635
The court is adjourned for today.

2111
02:28:25,126 --> 02:28:28,515
Me. I wish to meet Madhu.

2112
02:28:28,747 --> 02:28:31,155
Do you people wish to
make my daughter go crazy?

2113
02:28:31,595 --> 02:28:34,185
Didn't I tell you once that
she doesn't want to meet anyone?

2114
02:28:34,265 --> 02:28:35,515
She won't meet anyone!

2115
02:28:35,731 --> 02:28:37,955
Then why do you come again
and again and trouble us?

2116
02:28:38,035 --> 02:28:39,235
Mother.

2117
02:28:42,035 --> 02:28:43,155
Let her come.

2118
02:28:53,795 --> 02:28:58,035
Madhu. Please have
mercy on me for God's sake.

2119
02:28:59,449 --> 02:29:05,915
I have come to beg
for my husband's life.

2120
02:29:08,155 --> 02:29:09,235
Husband!

2121
02:29:15,235 --> 02:29:16,915
You want your husband?

2122
02:29:20,649 --> 02:29:21,649
You can get it.

2123
02:29:23,276 --> 02:29:25,235
Give me my husband back.

2124
02:29:28,835 --> 02:29:32,195
I know what is going
on in your heart now.

2125
02:29:34,155 --> 02:29:37,039
In such a situation,
it is natural for a person..

2126
02:29:38,109 --> 02:29:39,749
To have vengeful
feelings in her heart.

2127
02:29:41,515 --> 02:29:46,155
But Sister,
if you can forgive, then..

2128
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:51,795
I will worship you for
my whole life as a Goddess.

2129
02:29:54,155 --> 02:29:55,883
Giving me the greed of
a Goddess's stature..

2130
02:29:55,963 --> 02:29:57,675
You want to make
me fall from my duty.

2131
02:29:58,715 --> 02:30:02,595
No. I don't want to
become such a Goddess.

2132
02:30:04,412 --> 02:30:07,275
I am human. I am a woman.

2133
02:30:08,358 --> 02:30:11,675
Who can't ally with sin by
forgiving her husband's murderer..

2134
02:30:12,065 --> 02:30:13,235
Madhu!

2135
02:30:13,435 --> 02:30:15,116
My husband's restless soul
is waiting for it's revenge..

2136
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:16,675
From that day itself.

2137
02:30:17,275 --> 02:30:20,422
Till the time I don't see
a noose around his neck..

2138
02:30:21,309 --> 02:30:23,460
His soul won't have any peace.

2139
02:30:24,595 --> 02:30:28,595
Go. Put vermillion on
your forehead till two days.

2140
02:30:30,035 --> 02:30:32,155
And when that wretch is hanged..

2141
02:30:32,531 --> 02:30:35,275
If you can't rub off this
vermillion, then please come to me.

2142
02:30:35,955 --> 02:30:37,795
I will rub it off
with my own hands.

2143
02:31:02,906 --> 02:31:06,444
In the name of God, vow that
whatever you'll say will be true.

2144
02:31:07,706 --> 02:31:09,626
Whatever I will say,
will be the truth.

2145
02:31:16,586 --> 02:31:20,106
- Is your name Madhumati?
- Yes.

2146
02:31:20,506 --> 02:31:22,266
What was your
relation with Mr. Suresh?

2147
02:31:22,908 --> 02:31:25,746
- Husband?
- Yes.

2148
02:31:26,506 --> 02:31:30,706
- Is this true that your husband was murdered?
- Yes.

2149
02:31:31,211 --> 02:31:33,586
Was he murdered
in front of your eyes?

2150
02:31:36,586 --> 02:31:37,666
Yes.

2151
02:31:39,306 --> 02:31:41,386
Do you know who killed him?

2152
02:31:44,433 --> 02:31:45,433
Yes.

2153
02:31:46,506 --> 02:31:50,454
The one who had killed,
can you see him and recognize him?

2154
02:31:57,092 --> 02:32:00,226
- Surely.
- Okay.

2155
02:32:05,674 --> 02:32:11,146
Lift your face. More..

2156
02:32:13,706 --> 02:32:16,266
Look carefully at
the person in the cell.

2157
02:32:26,604 --> 02:32:29,266
Isn't he the man who
had killed your husband?

2158
02:32:42,431 --> 02:32:46,798
I will revere you as a
Goddess throughout my life.

2159
02:32:46,878 --> 02:32:48,626
Do anything that you can,
Mr. Gopinath..

2160
02:32:49,106 --> 02:32:52,386
Otherwise this family's name will
be drowned in darkness forever.

2161
02:32:52,506 --> 02:32:55,946
Madhu! Open the door, Madhu!

2162
02:32:56,386 --> 02:32:59,746
Why are you silent?
Please say something.

2163
02:33:00,146 --> 02:33:01,825
Whether the mistake
is small or big..

2164
02:33:02,376 --> 02:33:03,946
Can be found out by it's result.

2165
02:33:04,226 --> 02:33:08,226
And to achieve that girl,
he wrote a letter against Suresh.

2166
02:33:08,668 --> 02:33:13,946
- I vow to God. I didn't write that letter!
- Answer.

2167
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:19,706
Madhu. I am guilty.
I am guilty. I am guilty.

2168
02:33:20,138 --> 02:33:23,922
Don't forget that the small spark
that turned into a huge fire..

2169
02:33:24,095 --> 02:33:27,026
And ruined so many
lives was my doing.

2170
02:33:27,146 --> 02:33:30,866
If this isn't extinguished today,
then it will never be!

2171
02:33:31,067 --> 02:33:33,066
My soul will always be tortured.

2172
02:33:33,186 --> 02:33:35,626
Do you want that my soul
should never find peace?

2173
02:33:35,942 --> 02:33:41,066
Do you want that my soul
should wander through births?

2174
02:33:41,186 --> 02:33:42,365
No!

2175
02:33:42,581 --> 02:33:44,946
No.

2176
02:33:45,066 --> 02:33:47,866
Please come to your senses.
Try to recognise him.

2177
02:33:47,986 --> 02:33:50,306
Situation has changed this man.

2178
02:33:50,386 --> 02:33:52,738
Isn't he the same
Shankar who killed..

2179
02:33:52,818 --> 02:33:54,282
Your husband in front
of your eyes?

2180
02:33:54,306 --> 02:33:56,386
- No!
- What are you saying?

2181
02:33:56,506 --> 02:33:58,626
See carefully! He is that Shankar.

2182
02:33:58,746 --> 02:34:01,266
- Is he not that person? What are you saying?
- No!

2183
02:34:01,346 --> 02:34:03,146
- Please see again!
- No! No! No!

2184
02:34:08,884 --> 02:34:10,306
Just imagine.

2185
02:34:18,198 --> 02:34:20,198
The court accepts
the jury's decision..

2186
02:34:20,755 --> 02:34:23,278
That the accused in not
guilty in the eyes of the law.

2187
02:34:23,478 --> 02:34:27,838
Therefore the court orders the
accused Shankar to be released.

2188
02:34:28,798 --> 02:34:31,318
The emotion of
revenge had made me crazy.

2189
02:34:33,445 --> 02:34:36,438
But today, all of a sudden,
I heard my soul's voice.

2190
02:34:37,435 --> 02:34:40,638
The sin that you'd committed
by ruining Shankar's life..

2191
02:34:42,518 --> 02:34:47,318
I returned him his life
and repented for that sin.

2192
02:34:49,424 --> 02:34:51,678
So that your soul rests in peace.

2193
02:34:54,797 --> 02:34:56,678
Please bless me now.

2194
02:34:59,798 --> 02:35:05,438
That I live the rest
of life at the Ganges.

2195
02:35:11,518 --> 02:35:14,998
Daughter-in-law, why are
you leaving all of us?

2196
02:35:17,238 --> 02:35:19,798
Not only did you return
her husband to Shanta..

2197
02:35:20,518 --> 02:35:22,438
You returned the
guardian of this family too.

2198
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:24,958
You returned parents
their support.

2199
02:35:25,718 --> 02:35:27,678
Please do one more good
deed for me.

2200
02:35:28,438 --> 02:35:29,838
Please change your decision.

2201
02:35:31,501 --> 02:35:36,198
God wished only this much
alliance with this house.

2202
02:35:38,438 --> 02:35:42,798
Please don't cry. Life is a
play of birth and rebirth.

2203
02:35:44,198 --> 02:35:48,838
If God wishes, I shall serve
you in the next life again.

2204
02:35:50,138 --> 02:35:54,838
Madhu. By giving me my
husband back to me..

2205
02:35:55,438 --> 02:35:57,198
You can't go like this.

2206
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:00,078
If you have to go to a pilgrimage..

2207
02:36:00,958 --> 02:36:02,638
Then please take me with you too.

2208
02:36:03,025 --> 02:36:06,318
No, Shanta, one doesn't
speak like this.

2209
02:36:07,238 --> 02:36:10,318
Your pilgrimage is
in front of you.

2210
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,358
Come.

2211
02:36:39,278 --> 02:36:45,398
'Even if someone rubs off
all the lights of a journey..'

2212
02:36:45,478 --> 02:36:50,958
'..love goes on spreading stars.'

2213
02:36:51,238 --> 02:36:57,358
'Even if someone rubs off
all the lights of a journey..'

2214
02:36:57,596 --> 02:37:03,775
'..love goes on spreading stars.'

2215
02:37:03,855 --> 02:37:09,477
'The story of this
crazy love is strange.'

2216
02:37:09,726 --> 02:37:15,542
'Where is everyone so lucky that..'

2217
02:37:15,942 --> 02:37:21,998
'..every one is
with their beloveds.'

2218
02:37:22,172 --> 02:37:26,593
'Where is everyone so lucky that..'
