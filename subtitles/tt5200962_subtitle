2
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,625
Broad day light

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,375
At 11 in the morning

4
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:44,292
The people busy on the roads and
these calm ones at the park...

5
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,625
...have a lot of difference.

6
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,125
Everyone in this park has a story

7
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,125
Just like mine

8
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,833
I am Yazhini.

9
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,958
A brat from a good family.

10
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,417
Around 5 months ago...

11
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,250
I eloped from my house
in an unprecedented way.

12
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,333
Dad. Please forgive me.

13
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,500
I know that mom will not forgive.

14
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,208
I am officially eloping from home.

15
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,167
I am not eloping with anyone.

16
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,917
Yazhini, Where is Vilasini?

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,208
She is at Padmini's house.

18
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,875
Wonder, why she keeps
roaming around!

19
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,167
I am not eloping with anyone. I
am leaving to chennai for work.

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,125
I've tried hard. But you threaten
me with some silly sentiments.

21
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,542
What is Vivekananda's philosophy?

22
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,792
He has asked everyone
to go for a job.

23
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,875
I am joining for work on friday.

24
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,667
After 4 to 5 months, once you calm
down, I'll come back with my earnings.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,792
Until then, this is
Yazhini, signing off!

26
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,250
- Hello
- Hello

27
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,375
I am Bhaktirajan, Station
Master of Villupuram.

28
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,833
Tell me sir, how are you?

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,667
- I need an urgent favour.
- Tell me sir.

30
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,417
A passenger needs to be
de-trained from Rockfort.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,292
It's a night train.

32
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,667
They must not create a scene.

33
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,958
That is my daughter.

34
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,208
There won't be an trouble.

35
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,417
Even if she is stubborn, explain things
calmly and get her out of the train.

36
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:11,958
Is it an AC coach?

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,083
Yes. The coach is B2

38
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,667
Seat number 33.

39
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,792
Her name is B.Yazhini.

40
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:21,208
She will understand if
we talk to her calmly.

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,000
- Ok sir.
- Thanks.

42
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,917
Dad, wait. I'll join you too.

43
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,792
Any unprecedented act
will bring in troubles.

44
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
Moreover, my dad was
a station master.

45
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,542
I should've taken the bus!
My bad!

46
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,625
What is your problem?

47
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,208
Why shouldn't I
leave to Chennai?

48
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,708
A government posting at Villupuram

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,500
Getting married to a
family in Villupuram

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,958
Growing old at Villupuram.
All these will not work out.

51
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,417
Who asked you to grow
old at Villupuram?

52
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,167
After you get married, its then
up to you and your husband.

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,125
I have the offer letter with me.

54
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,708
I have to join tomorrow.

55
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,375
You don't seem to understand.

56
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,750
I eloped because of you.

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,333
Is this the way you talk?

58
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,917
Whatever it is, eloping
from home is a mistake.

59
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,250
If you don't like,
quarrel with me.

60
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,708
Only when you are stubborn on what you
want, will we know the importance of that.

61
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,333
Why do you elope?

62
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:27,708
Oh Dad!

63
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,292
How many times do I ask?

64
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,625
We are scared to
send you alone.

65
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,583
There are so many girls
studying and going for work.

66
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,750
What will I do if
you say like this?

67
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,375
I am not such a bold father.

68
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,333
It is just three hours.

69
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,000
I can be back anytime you call.

70
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,875
Even you can come there anytime.

71
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
Don't get scared unnecessarily.

72
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:00,667
Fine.

73
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,875
You take care.

74
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:09,125
I'll book a ticket in the
Tiruchendur Express.

75
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,167
Are you serious?

76
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:13,625
Yes.

77
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,042
Yes. Take care.

78
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,167
Dear

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,958
Keep this money.

80
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,833
Don't develop the habit
of overspending.

81
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,292
- Be careful when you spend.
- Ok dad.

82
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,958
I have a biscuit pack and water.
Keep it.

83
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,500
Love shall pass too

84
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,750
I am the queen!

85
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,625
I am the queen!

86
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,958
The bird is free to fly.

87
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,625
The sky welcomed with a smile.

88
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,958
The heart opened up

89
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,042
And filled the world.

90
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,333
The bird is free to fly.

91
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,458
The sky welcomed with a smile.

92
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,958
The heart opened up

93
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,875
And filled the world.

94
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,167
Chasing my dreams

95
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,917
Chasing my dreams

96
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,500
I found my true self

97
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,208
I became the fire fly

98
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:58,667
A brook brimming with stars.

99
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,750
The sky transformed to a bouquet

100
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:12,583
Freeing myself from
an unknown shackle.

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,917
The bird is free to fly.

102
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,417
The sky welcomed with a smile.

103
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,625
The heart opened up

104
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,625
And filled the world.

105
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,292
If all these good things
disappear in an instant

106
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,042
I don't know what to call it.

107
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,625
Varun, what happened?

108
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,042
Didn't you hear the news? The
company has been shut down.

109
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,417
Everything is over.

110
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,458
Is 5000 such a huge amount?

111
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,583
How many are sharing the room?

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,167
Only I will be staying.

113
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,333
- Only you?
- Yes.

114
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,458
We don't rent out
to single women.

115
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,625
- Sir please!
- There will be unwanted issues.

116
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,708
There are many hostels available for women.
Why don't you try them?

117
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,500
I am allergic to hostels.

118
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,875
This is what happens
when life tests you.

119
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,583
For now, I am looking out for
a place to stay for Rs.4000.

120
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,583
Hunting for a house is more
interesting than hunting for a job!

121
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,000
I had a boyfriend too.

122
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,375
There is no point in
talking about it.

123
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,083
- Tell me brother.
- Have you found a house?

124
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,250
Not yet. Do you know any?

125
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank God! I know the
house owner very well.

126
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:04,917
I've informed him.

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,708
You have to just move
in with your things.

128
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,833
You will definitely
like this house.

129
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,167
- Thank you very much.
- Please come.

130
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,667
Hey lady!

131
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,542
Are you the new tenant upstairs?

132
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:58,875
Hope you know that you must not
disturb us with your dance and music.

133
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,292
Okay.

134
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,125
Hello

135
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,083
Hello

136
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,375
Greetings.

137
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,208
What are you doing?

138
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,583
What do you mean?

139
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,917
Why do you read others papers?

140
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:25,958
Didn't you realise
that it is wrong?

141
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,375
It was lying on the road.
Now what?

142
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:33,750
Are you looking for a job?

143
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,417
So what?

144
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,583
Oh my!

145
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,333
Why don't you get
someone to help?

146
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,542
I had some people to help.

147
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,542
But when they knew it was first
floor, they asked for extra pay.

148
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,333
So I sent them away.

149
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,500
I knew this!

150
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,292
All of them are frauds.

151
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,458
They do everything except work.

152
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,292
How can a woman get all
these stuff upstairs?

153
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:58,917
Inhumane!

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,417
True. No one even empathizes!

155
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,083
How much did they ask for?

156
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,792
A 100 bucks extra!

157
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,958
- Just 100 bucks, isn't it?
- Yes

158
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,083
Clear it yourself.
You deserve it.

159
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,292
Waster!

160
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,292
I've had enough before
sending him out.

161
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,042
Greetings.

162
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,083
A lot happens in politics.

163
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,458
- Would you like to have some tea?
- No thanks. We had.

164
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:38,375
Greetings.

165
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,167
- Hi
- Get me some tea.

166
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Did you have something?

167
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,208
He had too.

168
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,208
- What's the issue?
- No idea.

169
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,833
Kathir. Come here.

170
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,917
They are the neighbours of Rathnam.

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
A small issue. Please
resolve it peacefully.

172
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,917
Where is Sampath?

173
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,750
Sampath is busy
with another work.

174
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,875
Not only Sampath, he
is also my brother.

175
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,417
- Greetings
- His name is Kathir.

176
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,125
Please resolve the
issue peacefully.

177
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,458
- I'll be back.
- Ok

178
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,292
Good behaviour.

179
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,417
Instead of taking his seat, you
took another place. I meant that.

180
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,417
The problem is...

181
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:36,250
There are rumors about
this gentleman and my wife.

182
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,417
It is very embarrassing.

183
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:43,875
People give us strange looks.

184
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
It's troubling me and
this gentleman.

185
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,542
I forgot. Let me introduce
this gentleman.

186
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,167
He is a distant relative of Rathnam.

187
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,500
We are discussing about your issue.
I'll call later.

188
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,042
This gentleman...

189
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,333
... is from a decent family.

190
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,583
Educated and responsible.

191
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,083
No one in the society
bothers about these.

192
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,833
They just insult me very badly

193
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,208
So...

194
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:17,375
There is this beautiful lady who
resolves these things in a TV channel...

195
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,500
I've decided to take
this issue up with her.

196
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,958
It seems they have much
worse issues to attend to.

197
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,667
They have put us on hold stating
that our case is not strong enough.

198
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:31,833
It will be very helpful, if you can ask
your leader to get a slot confirmed for us.

199
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,792
Tea has turned cold.

200
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:40,833
Brother!

201
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,667
Sir, give me a week's time. I will
try to do something about it.

202
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,208
Is it not possible to do
something by Wednesday?

203
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,250
There is a temple function
in my native next week.

204
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
All our family members are
going in this gentleman's car.

205
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,250
What do you eat?

206
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,917
Generally, what
food do you have?

207
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,333
Only organic food.

208
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:05,250
Natural food.

209
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,958
I am proud to have met you.

210
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:08,833
See you.

211
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,083
Please take down his
contact number.

212
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,292
Why does he not
give me an answer?

213
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:18,542
Hello

214
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,375
Dude, this leader
is irritating me.

215
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,958
He puts me in charge
of petty things.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,542
Address your concerns to him.

217
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:26,958
Discuss with me about
your issues with me.

218
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,792
Dude, this is a little too much.

219
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,167
All petty things...

220
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:33,667
- It's ready.
- I'll call you later, got some work

221
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,833
Looks like this will not work out. We
will have to deal it in a different way.

222
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,458
Where do you guys come from?

223
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,833
All dressed up in white
with a pot belly.

224
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,083
We need to build
statues for you.

225
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,958
I am not talented enough
to settle issues.

226
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,583
Please do what I requested.

227
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,292
- Bar license?
- What else do I ask for?

228
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,458
All that can be done
only during tenders.

229
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,583
Be patient. You've
just come out.

230
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,917
It's been 4 months.

231
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,375
I've been idle ever since
I came out of prison.

232
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,000
I have to think twice before I spend.
Please help.

233
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,917
Why don't you go
for collections?

234
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,625
- Brother!
- What?

235
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,083
There's a problem at the bar.

236
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,667
Which bar?

237
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:24,833
At the Silk bar.

238
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,542
So what?

239
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,833
The owner asked me to fetch you.

240
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,667
Greetings. Haven't you
brought your men?

241
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,708
Am I not enough?

242
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:07,042
They are a group of 4-5. They
give postures of Jackie Chan!

243
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,333
- Where are they?
- There they are.

244
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,917
That table. They are the ones.

245
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,875
Neither the booze is good,
nor the side dishes.

246
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,917
Where does your manager
run when we ask all this?

247
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,708
Please address these issues to our manager.

248
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,375
Please take you
hand off my shirt.

249
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,417
- Call your manager right now.
- Sir, please spare me.

250
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,542
Who is that making noise there?

251
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,583
Do you guys want to reach home
safely or with bruises on your body?

252
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,583
You provide useless liquor and
shouldn't we question it?

253
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,083
Useless liquor!

254
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,292
You guys are fit
only to drink urine!

255
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:44,208
And you guys talk
about booze is it!

256
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:48,083
- Who is that joker?
- Which joker?

257
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,792
Look at your mouth!

258
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,000
Come here.

259
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,458
Good good.

260
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,542
I am talking to you and....

261
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,833
How many were there?

262
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,125
And you get hit like this!

263
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,083
You will be the talk of the town.

264
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,125
Who are they?

265
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,708
Let me get hold of
them, I'll skin them!

266
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,083
They seem to be trained.

267
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,917
So I was a little helpless.

268
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,417
As though you would've
thrashed them all!

269
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
Look at your face!

270
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
You always watch the wild life channel.
What's that?

271
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,458
- Discovery Channel
- Yes. Discovery.

272
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,042
If you keep watching the mating
videos of lion and bear...

273
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,667
How will you face such problems?

274
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,875
What's there to laugh at?

275
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,000
Is it funny, you swines!

276
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,333
The whole bar is a disaster.

277
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,833
If people get to know about the duplicate
liquor, who will come to the bar?

278
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,458
You guys can't differentiate between
serious things and the jovial ones.

279
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,458
Useless fellows.

280
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,792
Where will they head to? They
will have to come to our bar!

281
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,083
We'll take care of them!

282
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,625
- No...
- What did you say?

283
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,708
I was just....

284
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,250
Don't we know that?

285
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,375
Don't you know what to speak?

286
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,042
You seem to be new around here.

287
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,625
He has joined today. New guy.

288
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,542
Come here.

289
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,333
- What's your name?
- Murali

290
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,667
You look familiar.

291
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,167
Sorry, I don't think.

292
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,667
May be I wouldn't have met you.

293
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,125
Why do you apologise for that?

294
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,625
- Are you being fake?
- No!

295
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,042
Dude! Enough! Leave him.

296
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,042
Welcome sister.

297
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,208
Please sit down.

298
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,917
Hey! Do you always eat here?

299
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:10,000
Sit down.

300
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,500
Come on! Sit down.

301
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,167
Is she known to you?

302
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,250
She is my neighbour.

303
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,167
Just a moment.

304
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:22,792
Brother.

305
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,458
Brother, two idlis and a poori.

306
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,750
Brother, two idlis and a poori.

307
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,375
- Brother, two idlis and...
- Wont you all shut up and eat?

308
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,542
Pestering!

309
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,458
How can we eat if
shut our mouths?

310
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:47,542
Who was that?

311
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:52,792
I'll rip open your mouth!

312
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:53,833
Understood?

313
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,625
Brother, two idlis and a poori.

314
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,208
Heard that its hard to
get a job in the IT.

315
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,500
Some recession or something

316
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:11,542
Is it?

317
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,125
No. We'll get a job if we try.

318
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,792
The unemployed are
calm in our country.

319
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,667
But abroad, they create a
ruckus asking for employment.

320
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,625
Chew and eat slowly.

321
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,250
Its not your mistake
that you are unemployed.

322
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,292
Its the country's mistake.

323
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:28,792
Don't bother much about it.
Eat now.

324
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,750
Add Rs.50 to the account of
the guy in the second street.

325
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,625
You bill has been paid.

326
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,375
Who paid?

327
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,750
Kathir brother paid it already.

328
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:39,833
Why?

329
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,958
- Sambar
- Just a moment.

330
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:54,833
Give me Rs.35.

331
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:56,250
Why?

332
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,958
Two idlis and a poori, isn't it?

333
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,708
I paid for it as they
didn't have change.

334
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,167
See you.

335
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:11,958
Sir.

336
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,083
What do you do?

337
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:21,833
I am a bouncer.

338
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,458
What do you want?

339
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,375
That is.. the rogues...

340
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,208
There is a lot of eve teasing...

341
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,500
Do you have any safety stuffs?

342
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,875
Dear, can you take
that pepper spray?

343
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,125
How do we use it?

344
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,708
Just a moment.

345
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,500
How dare you check out
on girls when am here.

346
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,208
Have you ever seen your
face in the mirror?

347
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:10,625
Enough?

348
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:16,625
Brother.

349
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,250
Kathiravan, has been talking
about bar for long.

350
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,000
Have you thought about it?

351
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,583
Do you have any plans?

352
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,625
He will not suit
for that business.

353
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:28,917
He is not patient enough.

354
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,542
He is short tempered. If we
get him a bar license...

355
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,958
Both our names will be ruined.

356
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,875
It's not because of that. He has
served 5 years in the prison for me.

357
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,250
We must not forget that.

358
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,333
Have you all grown
up to advice me?

359
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:42,917
Giving me a speech?

360
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:43,792
Sit down now.

361
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:49,500
Listen Sampath. We can
do anything for him.

362
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,333
We can have him with us forever.

363
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,917
We will get him married
and do whatever he wants.

364
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,375
Business is not his forte.

365
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,125
He is not matured enough.

366
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,542
What?

367
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,167
Ok. You manage him if he
asks anything about this.

368
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:09,417
Yeah, tell me.

369
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:10,625
Hey dude.

370
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,667
I've spoken to him.
Everything will be alright.

371
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,667
Tell me. I am on my way there.
I'll take care.

372
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,792
Tell me. Which area
are you guys from?

373
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,583
Take your hands off. Don't
lay your hands on us.

374
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,833
Please spare us.

375
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,000
You have been caught red handed.

376
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,000
I've been asking you and
you guys don't reply.

377
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,208
Which area are you guys from?

378
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,833
Tell me which area are you from.

379
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,333
- Tell me.
- Sir, what's the problem?

380
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,417
They have stolen
things worth Rs.500.

381
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
They were caught red handed.

382
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,750
I don't know how much they
have stolen till now.

383
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,958
This is the first time.
Don't talk too much.

384
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,417
Shut up.

385
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Sir, spare them.

386
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,125
You guys are from our area know?

387
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,167
I am the son of Gopal,
residing at Corporation road.

388
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,292
Why did you guys... Fine, wait outside.
Please spare them.

389
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,917
Who are you? This is
none of your business.

390
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,667
If I call the cops...

391
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Will you take your hands off or
do you want me to take it off?

392
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:04,625
Take your hands off. I stand
responsible for them.

393
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:05,917
Take your hands sir.

394
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,708
- Go and wait outside.
- Ok brother.

395
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:12,208
Who are you? Why do you
create unnecessary problems?

396
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,667
Sir. They are kids.

397
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,542
If you send them to the police station
often, they will turn out to be criminals.

398
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,000
Do you understand, friend?

399
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,542
We can threaten them or
inform their parents.

400
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,125
If these boys were well off, won't
you spare them after threatening?

401
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,167
Why will I be bothered if they are
well off or not? If they steal...

402
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,000
Chuck it friend. They are
school going kids. Let them be!

403
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:31,958
I'll inform their parents.

404
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,042
Thanks. See you.

405
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,375
Make sure that those
kids don't turn up here.

406
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:48,042
Why?

407
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:50,833
Tell them not to steal.

408
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,333
Don't tell them not to turn up.

409
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,458
You put up a shop at our place

410
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,625
...and will you ask
us not to come?

411
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,208
I'll torch the place!

412
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,042
Do you have soda?

413
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,750
Do you have half
a liter of Soda?

414
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,333
It's inside.

415
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,000
Ok. Please move. I'll get it.

416
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,667
Have you joined for work here?

417
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,583
I thought you were
looking for an IT job.

418
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,625
Is this that work?

419
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,583
No. It's just part time.

420
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,208
Do want a polythene bag?

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Two rupees extra.

422
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,375
What?

423
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,375
Are you kidding me?

424
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Pay Rs.40. That's enough.

425
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,083
Take.

426
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:56,417
Ok.

427
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,458
- Why do you spoil our area's repute?
- Sorry!

428
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,833
That was embarrassing.

429
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,708
I'll bring my friends and
show him what I can.

430
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
We'll do it tomorrow itself.

431
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,667
What am I talking...

432
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,625
And you...

433
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,167
Why do you want to get into fist
fights when you have to study?

434
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:14,958
Please spare me.

435
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
- I won't hit you.
- Please spare me.

436
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:17,708
- I will not hit you.
- Please.

437
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:13,542
Isn't that my umbrella?

438
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:14,833
So?

439
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,833
Don't you have any sense? I
have an interview today.

440
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,292
Should I go like this?

441
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,625
- Give it.
- Go tomorrow. So what?

442
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,917
I'll be drenched. Drop me
at my place and then go.

443
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,375
Listen. Me and my food
will be drenched.

444
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,583
Please. Please.

445
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
Hey girl next door!

446
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,500
How was the interview?

447
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:46,458
Ruined!

448
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:47,625
Are you happy?

449
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,208
Why? What did I do?

450
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,125
Who will offer a job if we go
drenched for the interview?

451
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:55,833
Am I going to the grocery
store for a job?

452
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:56,958
This is IT.

453
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,000
Do you know how important
the first impression is?

454
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:12,792
What did you say your name is?

455
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:14,500
Murali

456
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,875
Then, Murali...

457
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:18,833
You look very decent.

458
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:20,458
What are you doing here?

459
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,083
I failed in my 12th grade.

460
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,292
My family is in a bad state.

461
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,125
I was whiling away
my time for a year.

462
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,625
It was Sekhar brother
who got me this job.

463
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:33,292
You talk as though
you've got a bank job!

464
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,208
Is this even a job?

465
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,708
Hi.Venkatesh.

466
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:53,333
Please come.

467
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,542
Come here, I say.

468
00:32:58,917 --> 00:32:59,333
Then...

469
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:01,208
How are you?

470
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:02,958
Are you fine?

471
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,292
Fine.

472
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,083
When you borrow money,
you are very humble.

473
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,917
Why do you blackmail with suicides
when we ask you to repay?

474
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,667
Should we get the money from
the grave after you are gone?

475
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,125
Will you slit yourself
or do you need my help?

476
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:23,917
Sir

477
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:24,750
Sir

478
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:28,917
Who is you 'SIR'?

479
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,208
Kathir, Would you like
to have some soup?

480
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,083
How long have you known me?

481
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,458
Even a stone would've
transformed in 15 years time.

482
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,375
You remain the same
where ever you are.

483
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,792
You are a living example
of a useless moron.

484
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:09,958
What brings you this way?

485
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,208
Venkatesh, why do you
involve sir for such...

486
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,167
How long since you
have been free?

487
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:23,750
5 months.

488
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,125
Are you fed up of being free?

489
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,250
Are you?

490
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,375
No sir!

491
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,792
Your leader does business everywhere.

492
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,625
What do you think others will do?

493
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,500
Some people would've created
a ruckus at the bar.

494
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,458
About the quality of liquor.

495
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:43,458
Keep your leader informed.

496
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,333
If he doesn't fall in my line, there
will be such troubles in all bars.

497
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,875
Fine?

498
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,500
Henceforth you must come to
this hotel only to eat.

499
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,167
Not free food, of course!

500
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,250
Get lost now.

501
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:03,667
Super!

502
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,167
Super dude!

503
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,125
So, that Kumar is not an SI?

504
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,292
He is not even a cop!

505
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,583
You ask if he is an SI.

506
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,958
It's been 6 months since
he was dismissed.

507
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,708
I feel furious of
having been hit by him!

508
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:18,958
Keep applying.

509
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:22,917
Please do something.

510
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:26,667
Brother.

511
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,542
Inform our guys to do something.

512
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,125
Let him be admitted in a
hospital for a month.

513
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,875
Hey Kathir.

514
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,125
He is very powerful.

515
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,500
Vadapalani, Choolai...

516
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,583
The bribes that reach these
stations reach him directly.

517
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,125
He is friendly with
all the officials.

518
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:47,958
So, nothing can be done, isn't it?

519
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,333
Not possible.

520
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,375
Did you see this?

521
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,250
After he was dismissed, we
stopped giving him bribes.

522
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,917
He has been targeting us ever since.

523
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Let's be patient.

524
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:03,917
Don't hurry.

525
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,833
Where is he going?

526
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,458
Dude!

527
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,833
Hey switch it off man!

528
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:30,958
Hey switch it off.

529
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:32,667
Hey girl next door. Your name...

530
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,750
Stop the alarm.

531
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:35,792
You sleepy faced!

532
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:39,833
Who are you?

533
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:40,833
A broker.

534
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,625
I came to show her the house.

535
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,250
Are you a house broker?

536
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:46,458
Is that girl vacating the house?

537
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:49,625
- Yes. Some rogue stays next door it seems...
- A rogue?

538
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,583
You will not face that problem.
I'll vacate him too.

539
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:53,917
You take a look at the house first.

540
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,375
Move aside.

541
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,500
Ask her to switch off the alarm.

542
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,542
You please take a look at the house.

543
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,583
She said she is going out
and she is lying here.

544
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I asked you to switch off the alarm
and you people scream on top of it!

545
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:26,667
What happened to her?

546
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
She took pills.

547
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,708
Oh my! Pills?

548
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,125
What are you looking at?

549
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,250
- Lift her up.
- Give her some water.

550
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,083
Sir

551
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:37,792
Sir

552
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,250
Sir

553
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,125
Just a moment sir.

554
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,833
Take this. She had these pills.

555
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,042
Keep it here.

556
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,042
- Take my vehicle.
- I don't know to drive.

557
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,167
Is he the rogue?

558
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,125
Did you like the house?

559
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,250
No.

560
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,750
Then, he is the rogue.

561
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:08,833
Don't drop her!

562
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,375
Somebody please come.

563
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,583
Son! Son!

564
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,083
- Shall I?
- Move aside.

565
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,708
She should be living
like a queen.

566
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,250
I think so!

567
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Come here, somebody!

568
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,375
This looks like a
haunted palace.

569
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,375
Somebody, please come.

570
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:37,833
Get the stretcher.

571
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,375
Idiot.

572
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,500
Will anyone commit suicide
for not getting a job?

573
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:45,708
Don't shout.

574
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,667
It's my agony!

575
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,208
This is what the girl had.

576
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,333
What's this?

577
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,667
How do I know? Am I a doctor?

578
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,083
It's just a
supplementary tablet.

579
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:56,875
What's that?

580
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Nutrition tablets.

581
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,083
Will she be alright?

582
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,667
She will be fine.
You wait outside.

583
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,917
Sir.

584
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,500
The bill is ready.

585
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:08,667
You have to pay Rs.1200.

586
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,042
The girl will pay for it.

587
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,958
- Please take it.
- Give it to her.

588
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,083
The girl will pay for it.
Give it to her.

589
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:19,583
What's the problem?

590
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:21,667
Her body was weak.

591
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,042
Having nutrition tablets
make the body weak?

592
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,583
Nutrition tablets alone doesn't help.
One needs to eat food.

593
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,375
What is your problem?

594
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:37,917
Hello

595
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:39,292
Insomnia

596
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:41,417
What does that mean?

597
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:43,292
I can't sleep.

598
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,042
When?

599
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,250
Always.

600
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,583
Take good food.

601
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,083
What are you doing here?

602
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,458
My fate!

603
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:03,917
Who brought you here?

604
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:05,167
Brought me?

605
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,042
When I visited you room...

606
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,875
...you were about to die
and I brought you here.

607
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,083
Or else, you would've been dead.

608
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,208
What are you saying?

609
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,875
I would've got up in some time!

610
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,542
An unwanted expense
of 1200 rupees!

611
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,167
Why did you come to my room?

612
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,208
The lady who came along with
the broker was screaming.

613
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,375
Did you inform the broker that
there is a rogue next door?

614
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:33,667
Who is that rogue?

615
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:34,917
Do you at least remember that?

616
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:37,833
I am feeling giddy!

617
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,875
Stop your stupid acting.
Get up now!

618
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,125
Why do you shout at a patient?

619
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,250
Show some concern.

620
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,542
It's your fate Kathiravan!

621
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,583
Think of your parents'
dreams about you.

622
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,708
Why are you suffering here?

623
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,250
I don't have anyone.

624
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,917
I don't even know
how my mom looks.

625
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,083
What is your problem?

626
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,667
I have an ambition.

627
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,625
I am ready for a few
sacrifices to achieve that.

628
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,417
Do you know what
sacrifice means?

629
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,792
When your neighbour is unconscious, rushing
her to the hospital is called a sacrifice.

630
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:27,167
Turning a blind eye towards
that is not sacrifice.

631
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,458
Got it?

632
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,500
Why did you do that?

633
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:33,583
Simply!

634
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:34,542
Just for fun!

635
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,375
What is your so called ambition?

636
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
You will not understand that.

637
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,375
Ambitions should be like that.
No one should understand.

638
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,917
Don't you have any
ambitions in life?

639
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:57,958
I do have.

640
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,375
The last three generations
of my family...

641
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,292
...have been employed by someone.

642
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:05,792
I want to go a step ahead...

643
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:07,708
...and have decided to
become an owner.

644
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:10,417
What owner?

645
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:13,708
Bar owner.

646
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
You do one thing...

647
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,833
As soon as you get up,
on an empty stomach...

648
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,958
rinse it thoroughly...

649
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,333
pop it in like a tablet and drink water.

650
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,750
You will be healthy.

651
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Before you sleep...

652
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:36,917
- Gooseberry, Chebulic Myrobalan, Belleric Myrobalan, dried ginger in equal portions...
- Sir

653
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:38,667
Doubt is it?

654
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Are you really a rogue?

655
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:41,875
Why?

656
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:45,000
Your face is bruised always.

657
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,875
Or were you just kidding?

658
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,458
Does a rogue always hit others?

659
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:54,542
Sometimes a rogue needs
to get hit as well.

660
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:55,750
Got it?

661
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,167
Do you get hit more often?

662
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,375
I should have left you
to die in your room.

663
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,708
How can I come in this rain?

664
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,958
This rain isn't that heavy.

665
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,750
I am very hungry.

666
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,125
Can't you parcel 6 idlis?

667
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,208
Idli will be drenched.

668
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:20,917
Idli will be drenched?

669
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,042
Aren't you bringing it in a polythene bag?

670
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I'll get drenched.

671
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:26,792
So?

672
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,542
You stay there. I'll come.

673
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:40,375
I don't deserve the idlis today!

674
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,083
Sir.

675
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,708
Do you have an umbrella?

676
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,792
Umbrella?

677
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,042
Are you mocking at me?

678
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,750
You had one, isn't it?

679
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,500
I left it during the
last interview.

680
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:55,750
Stupid.

681
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:57,917
That's why you
didn't get the job.

682
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:04,958
- Give me Rs.200 if you have.
- Why?

683
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:06,667
I'll get an umbrella.

684
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,333
Give the money.

685
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:09,750
Really?

686
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,292
You are doubting, isn't it?

687
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,208
That I will swindle your money.

688
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,500
Get the one that costs less.

689
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,750
Please make it fast.

690
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:44,875
It cost an extra Rs.100.

691
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,667
Ok Ok.

692
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,708
Ungrateful world!

693
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:56,667
Sir!

694
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:58,917
Thank you very much.

695
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,083
Do well at the interview.

696
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:03,333
Thank you.

697
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:09,875
Welcome.

698
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:11,417
Take your seat.

699
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:12,917
- Sit down.
- Thank you sir.

700
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,208
What's you college name? Sri...

701
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,083
Sri Akhilandavaa
Saraswati College.

702
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:23,000
- There is a college in every nook and corner.
- Every marriage hall has been converted into a college!

703
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Let us know about yourself.

704
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,458
My name is Yazhini.

705
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,333
I did my B.Tech IT from Sri
Akhilaandava Saraswati College.

706
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,792
What is the meaning of your name?

707
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,000
Yazh is an ancient musical instrument.

708
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:38,958
Is your family into music?

709
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:40,667
No sir.

710
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,292
We can use her for our
company cultural.

711
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:46,292
Can you sing?

712
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,083
There are lot of cultural
events in our company.

713
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,042
Singing would be an
added advantage.

714
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,250
Go ahead.

715
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:04,875
Stay a while more, my love!

716
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,167
- Is it the poster?
- Yes.

717
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:11,875
Hey Kathir.

718
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,083
Stick these posters.

719
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:15,708
Poster?

720
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,625
Why?

721
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,125
What are you saying?

722
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,208
Its our Durai's shop.

723
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:23,083
I've promised to put up posters
all over our area. Please do it.

724
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:24,125
So?

725
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,750
Should I go and stick these?

726
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,708
Are you showing your attitude?

727
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,000
No one will respect
me after this.

728
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,750
People will not
respect if you work?

729
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,667
Let me see who doesn't respect.

730
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,292
I'll go and stick them.

731
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,708
- Leave it. I don't want anyone.
- Leave it.

732
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:39,958
- Leave it.
- Just a moment.

733
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,708
Just leave it. You've become old.

734
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,208
You don't seem to understand.

735
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:45,542
You've grown old.

736
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,833
I know. Mind your business.

737
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:53,208
- I am yet to talk, my love!
- Stop

738
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:54,708
Get up.

739
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,458
- Get up please.
- Sir.

740
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,958
Why such a slow song?

741
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,750
Give us a peppy number.

742
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:07,958
With some dance
movements please.

743
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:09,542
Come on. We need energy.

744
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:11,583
We need performers in the team.
That's why.

745
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:13,958
Go on.

746
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:20,292
I've googled the whole world

747
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:24,542
Am yet to find any insane guy like him.

748
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:31,542
Good singing.

749
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:33,917
Please sit down.

750
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,333
You sing very well.

751
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,958
You could've trained yourself
from a professional.

752
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,708
There are many reality shows
coming up these days.

753
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,333
They introduce new
singers as well.

754
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,250
Why didn't you choose
such a career?

755
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,417
I want to try net...

756
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
...networking.

757
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,042
That's ok. I understand.

758
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:52,542
We don't have any vacancy for
that position now. Very sorry!

759
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:55,208
But do take my advice seriously.
All the best.

760
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,542
Hope it was a good time pass.

761
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,125
- That was a good time pass.
- You wanted to leave early as well.

762
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:33,833
Hold this.

763
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,375
What are you doing here?

764
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,458
How much will they pay
to stick these posters?

765
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,083
Why?

766
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:43,958
Are you fed up of
hunting for a job?

767
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,583
Why do you shift careers?

768
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,583
I just asked to know.

769
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,083
How much will they pay?

770
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:51,167
I am not doing it for money.

771
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:53,458
Its for the relationship.

772
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,208
You should find a job
for your qualification.

773
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:56,917
This will not suit
as a part time.

774
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:57,708
Understood?

775
00:49:59,375 --> 00:49:59,708
Take it.

776
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:01,208
Sir.

777
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,625
Can we go and have
something to eat?

778
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:07,625
I am hungry.

779
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,250
Who's there?

780
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,417
I feel you are short tempered.

781
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:18,833
That's why you are
not finding a job.

782
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:20,875
Can I suggest you something?

783
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:21,875
You will get a job.

784
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,000
Am sure you will get a job.
Shall I?

785
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:25,750
Sit down.

786
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:29,708
Should fall at their feet.

787
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,750
Fall flat on their feet.

788
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:35,792
There are many who get saved by
apologizing to the one who comes to kill.

789
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,083
If one can get back their
lives, is job a big deal?

790
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:41,667
I can't reach for their feet.

791
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,667
The table will be long and
they will be seated quite far.

792
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:44,833
What answer is this?

793
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:46,208
Fall under the table.

794
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:47,917
Is this an answer?

795
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:49,417
I can only advice you.

796
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,875
Can I go and fall at
their feet for you?

797
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Who's there?

798
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:54,417
The stove is just getting hot.

799
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Shall I cook?

800
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:00,500
I am a good cook.

801
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:01,833
You?

802
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,583
Life is dry as a desert

803
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,375
There is no sign of prosperity

804
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,292
There is no loss

805
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,417
This is an endless circle.

806
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,417
Look around you

807
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,750
Where are your parents?

808
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,167
Look around you

809
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,500
Where are your relatives?

810
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,083
Look around you

811
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,333
Where are your parents?

812
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,750
Look around you

813
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:51,167
Where are your relatives?

814
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:55,917
The beauty is in the
eyes of the beholder.

815
00:51:56,125 --> 00:52:00,833
The world will drench
in abundant love.

816
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,042
Did you really cook that?

817
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Yes. Why?

818
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:36,958
It was amazing.

819
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:38,833
- Where did you learn?
- At the prison.

820
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:44,500
Turn away the
loneliness from life.

821
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:49,167
Let's celebrate the
small things in life.

822
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:54,083
Sleep half way through a dream

823
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:59,042
Live the rest of the dream.

824
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,958
Look around you

825
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:13,292
Where are your parents?

826
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,583
Look around you

827
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,875
Where are your relatives?

828
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:19,583
Fall at their feet.

829
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,667
Fall flat at their feet.

830
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:27,625
Hello

831
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:29,833
I am Yazhini.

832
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,292
A friend of mine
referred me to the HR.

833
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,917
I'll just send my resume...

834
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,542
So if I...

835
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:41,917
As the sun goes down the horizon

836
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:47,083
Our shadow starts to disappear.

837
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,875
Days and lanes are
the same, always

838
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:56,125
They are the same, everyday!

839
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,375
Look around you

840
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:01,333
Where are your parents?

841
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:03,875
Look around you

842
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:06,167
Where are your relatives?

843
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,750
Look around you

844
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,042
Where are your parents?

845
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,417
Look around you

846
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,000
Where are your relatives?

847
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:20,458
Whatever we do, we should be
the cynosure of all eyes.

848
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,958
We should plan all our activities
meticulously, even if it is insane.

849
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,625
No one should understand
or know our activities.

850
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:29,458
Hello.

851
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,625
I am calling from BBC.

852
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:32,833
About women empowerment.

853
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:34,750
It's regarding an interview.

854
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,042
Can you connect me to the HR?

855
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:39,875
Hello

856
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,167
My name is Yazhini.

857
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:44,333
I am calling regarding a job.

858
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:48,083
Learn how to make calls first.

859
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,125
Aren't you educated?

860
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,750
Learn some manners first.

861
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,833
Hang up!

862
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,500
Did you lie?

863
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:01,375
Yes sir.

864
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:02,792
I am not from BBC.

865
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,250
I am an ordinary girl
looking out for a job.

866
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,292
Forgive me.

867
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:08,958
Why are you telling me all this?

868
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:12,458
I am in a very pathetic state.

869
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,458
I scored very well in my 12th grade.

870
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,625
My parents wanted me to be with them and...

871
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,708
..they enrolled me in a
college of less repute.

872
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,625
- What can I do for that?
- I have a good percentage

873
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,083
They don't call for interviews
from such colleges.

874
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:28,500
Why is that no one understands that even such
colleges sometimes churn out good students.

875
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,917
Hello. Am I speaking to Yazhini?

876
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:58,708
Yes.

877
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,125
I am calling from EMIRA.

878
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:01,292
Tell me sir.

879
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,833
You called me yesterday
regarding a job, isn't it?

880
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:04,750
Yes sir.

881
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,208
He told me how you approached.

882
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,208
BBC?

883
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,083
Sorry sir. I was
really desperate.

884
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,458
No No. It's an
alternative thinking.

885
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,208
I am really impressed.

886
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:25,042
Thank you sir.

887
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:27,500
We generally don't
recruit freshers.

888
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,375
I have spoken about
creating an opening.

889
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,417
The pay scale will be
less in the beginning.

890
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,417
The job guarantee is high.

891
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:40,333
We don't recruit or
send out unnecessarily.

892
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:43,542
This is my visiting card.

893
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,208
Thank you sir.

894
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:53,542
Excuse me.

895
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:55,958
It's terrible.

896
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:58,333
Who made this?

897
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,667
Let's go to some other place.

898
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:04,500
Ok sir.

899
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:22,792
What is your problem?

900
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:26,875
Why are you calling
me to a room?

901
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,167
You know to make calls saying
that you are from BBC.

902
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,250
Should I explain these to you?

903
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,458
Will I get a job if
I come to the room?

904
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:39,208
Only I can get you this job.

905
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,667
I don't want that job.

906
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,292
Why are you being so stupid?

907
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,375
Do you know how many are
ready for this job?

908
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:51,833
Others may have their own reasons.

909
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:53,333
I don't want this job.

910
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:56,875
Leave me.

911
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:58,083
Leave me.

912
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:28,458
Hey what happened?

913
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,667
Didn't get the job?

914
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,833
I'll get the job only
if I sleep with him.

915
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:49,583
What did you do?

916
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:50,875
Why are you late?

917
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,625
What did you think?

918
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
What did you think of me?

919
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:01,750
How do I look?

920
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,000
How do I look?

921
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,750
I shouldn't have told you!

922
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:40,458
Hello

923
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:42,417
Hi

924
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,208
Mr. Subramaniam?

925
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:46,708
- Yes.
- You?

926
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,917
I want a parcel of your teeth
from your stinky mouth.

927
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:18,167
Please leave.

928
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,875
Don't decide anything based
on this girl's statement.

929
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,708
You better leave.

930
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:32,458
How dare you enter his office and
thrash him. Don't you have any sense?

931
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:37,292
You look to be educated.

932
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:40,417
You should have brought your
problem to the police station

933
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:43,125
And not to such rogues.

934
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,667
Write down your address,
phone number and leave.

935
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,667
You too.

936
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:07,708
You seem to be experienced.

937
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,625
When I was in college

938
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,083
We tried once in the hostel

939
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:16,917
That's all.

940
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,458
With girls?

941
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:21,833
Yes.

942
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,208
When boys drink in every movie,

943
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,833
What do you think we'll do?

944
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:31,542
Wonderful!

945
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,250
The problem with our country is...

946
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:39,958
Population.

947
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:41,542
Population.

948
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:42,917
Population.

949
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,625
Another 20 engineering colleges have
been granted permission to operate.

950
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:48,958
Don't they have any sense?

951
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,167
We are already running
from pillar to post.

952
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:53,875
Are you an engineer?

953
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:56,917
Who is not an engineer
in Tamil Nadu?

954
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,625
Everybody is an engineer.

955
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,125
Did I ask you to thrash him up?

956
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:13,875
Did I?

957
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,792
If you do it once more,
I'll thump your face!

958
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:19,875
Understood?

959
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,750
You are good.

960
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:30,583
That cannot make you
thrash a person like this.

961
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,667
You should take the route of
Non-Violence as preached by Gandhi.

962
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,542
Do you understand?

963
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,667
Not only you...

964
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,375
Be it any girl...

965
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I would've done the same.

966
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:46,292
Do you understand?

967
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,000
You blurt out dialogs
of a tamil hero.

968
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,125
I had a boyfriend.

969
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,458
He wouldn't have done
all this for me.

970
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:10,458
Did he ditch you?

971
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,042
My company was shut down

972
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,375
He had the experience

973
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,667
So he immediately got another job.

974
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,125
What's wrong in that?

975
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:27,167
He is not with me
during my low points!

976
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,042
He took care of himself.

977
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:38,708
When I was in my tenth grade...

978
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:40,708
There was a girl named Vimala...

979
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,500
Then...

980
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:47,708
Then what?

981
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,042
She was there.

982
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:50,625
I was there too. That's all.

983
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,333
Such a stupid story.

984
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,250
I was not fit for anything more!

985
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:57,917
What to do!

986
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,000
Don't worry.

987
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,292
You are good.

988
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,625
You will definitely
get a good girl.

989
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,292
Are you sure?

990
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,042
I am just roaming around.

991
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:39,792
Hey girl!

992
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:41,958
What's there?

993
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:43,875
What do you see there?

994
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:48,292
Hello! Hey!

995
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:52,167
Why do you sob now?

996
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:57,833
Can my situation get
worse than this?

997
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:00,042
Why? What happened?

998
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,250
Drinking is a shame.

999
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:07,167
That too with a rogue like you!

1000
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:11,042
There is no shame worse than
drinking in your house!

1001
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:12,417
You just said that I am good.

1002
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:15,958
You are good.

1003
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,375
Did I come to Chennai for this?

1004
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,292
- Fine.
- Is it for this?

1005
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,292
Calm down. Don't cry.

1006
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,250
Forget it. Calm down.

1007
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:27,958
Wipe your tears.

1008
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:30,750
Don't cry.

1009
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,125
Fine.

1010
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,208
Sorry.

1011
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,292
Are you alright?

1012
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:51,375
Come here.

1013
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:55,958
Come closer.

1014
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:18,042
Hey girl!

1015
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,583
Don't sleep with having
food after the drink.

1016
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:23,542
Hello

1017
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,875
Eat something.

1018
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,542
First shave your beard off.

1019
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,250
Dear Aquarians...

1020
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,500
...born between January 20 and February 8

1021
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,958
This new year will be the
deciding year of your life.

1022
01:08:56,417 --> 01:09:01,042
There will be celebratory events in your
family. Possibility of having kids is high.

1023
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:07,083
Due to the 7th position of Jupiter, your respect
and stature in the society will improve.

1024
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,583
To start new businesses, your
overseas experience will support.

1025
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:17,208
There might be some testing times
due to the position of Saturn.

1026
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,542
But will eventually dwindle away.

1027
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:24,208
Prosperity is on the
rise in your family.

1028
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,500
The plans of women
will be approved

1029
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:28,958
and intelligent ideas will be welcomed.

1030
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:34,667
They will unite with their life
partner and be happy for life.

1031
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:39,750
Farmers will have a prosperous year ahead.

1032
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:44,208
Seeking advice regarding career
will clear all doubts.

1033
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,750
The year will be extremely
fruitful for artists.

1034
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:16,208
Come along! Let's dance
with the deer and peacocks!

1035
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:22,083
Door and hangings dangle in the breeze.
You made them all dance.

1036
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,208
My house dances along with me.

1037
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,750
My life has been a barren land

1038
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,583
You are the brook of my life.

1039
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,333
Tidel park has turned
out to be Titanic.

1040
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:54,708
Come along! Let's dance
with the deer and peacocks!

1041
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:26,542
A sound and healthy mind
Is riding on a confused tide.

1042
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:37,375
You've rolled down
like a sick bird.

1043
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:48,667
You are scared like having
watched a horror movie.

1044
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:01,417
She gave me a high!
So high to overcome!

1045
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:05,958
She crunched my heart overnight

1046
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:12,542
I have a peppy song to dance!

1047
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:38,208
She was chirpy
Now, very droopy

1048
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:48,792
She is a dot held captive by
A rangoli that captivates the heart.

1049
01:12:53,500 --> 01:13:00,542
You the free flowing cloth
That entangles with the thorn

1050
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:13,500
Touch me, pinch me
Stop to enjoy the dance.

1051
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:16,250
She lied on my shoulder
That made me lift boulders!

1052
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,167
She made my nights sleepless.

1053
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,625
Hey girl next door!

1054
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:39,042
Girl next door!

1055
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:43,208
Look what I've got for you.

1056
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:45,125
It's an amazing drink.

1057
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:47,375
It will give you a new high.

1058
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,750
Are you having a hangover?

1059
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:52,583
Two drinks will make you fine.

1060
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:58,167
Fine!

1061
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:26,458
Hey girl!

1062
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,958
What was the noise last night?

1063
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:28,750
Nothing!

1064
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:32,833
Hey girl next door.

1065
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,292
Why do you turn a deaf
ear to my shouting?

1066
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,375
That night...

1067
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:52,542
It will not happen any more.

1068
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:57,458
Hey girl!

1069
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,000
I didn't think anything wrong.

1070
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:04,375
- What I thought was, there was...
- You are mistaken.

1071
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Do you know eskimos?

1072
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:10,917
Eskimo is a clan.

1073
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,333
They live in places
frozen with cold.

1074
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:14,917
When they fell very cold,

1075
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,042
They hug their pet dog and sleep.

1076
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:21,500
What happened that day
is similar to that.

1077
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,625
Nothing else.

1078
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:24,292
Please forget it.

1079
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:26,958
Dog?

1080
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:29,000
Me?

1081
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:37,125
Hey girl who slept with a dog!

1082
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:39,875
This girl slept with a dog.

1083
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,375
Whom do you call a dog?

1084
01:15:44,292 --> 01:15:45,750
Hey girl who slept with a dog!
Stop there!

1085
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,792
Kathir. Are you fine?

1086
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:02,750
Seems like you got
some snack here.

1087
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,333
I am a dog.

1088
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,750
But a ferocious one!

1089
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:10,083
That's why your
boss is feeding me.

1090
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,333
But you are a servant.

1091
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,625
Didn't you get it?

1092
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:15,792
An office boy!

1093
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,125
Mind your business and
don't get thumped.

1094
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,333
Sir!

1095
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:23,083
You'll be fine only when you
are locked up and thrashed.

1096
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:29,875
Don't pester.

1097
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,708
You cannot survive standing against him.

1098
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:34,125
Do you understand?

1099
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:38,042
The Inspector and SI never
gets the bribe directly.

1100
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:39,750
The one who just left, Kumar...

1101
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:41,167
'Moda' Kumar

1102
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,042
He is the kingpin.

1103
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:43,958
Do you understand?

1104
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:44,667
So?

1105
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:47,042
Make an effort to understand.

1106
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:48,875
At least act!

1107
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,375
Remember, you got
thumped by his men?

1108
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:57,000
Brother.

1109
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:59,917
I'll tell you a proverb.
It might sound old.

1110
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:03,417
I'll come back and tell you.

1111
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:04,875
- Let's go.
- Where?

1112
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:06,792
A small work. I'll
be right back.

1113
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,375
- Hello. What?
- I want to join classes.

1114
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,375
Classes?

1115
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,375
The master is not here.

1116
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:24,208
He'll be here tomorrow.

1117
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:25,667
You come back tomorrow.

1118
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,042
- You could've stocked them
- Sure.

1119
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:35,667
Brother.

1120
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:36,625
They are there.

1121
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,000
- Are all the four there?
- Yes. All four are there.

1122
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:40,875
Are they fresh or tired?

1123
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:42,375
They are fresh.

1124
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:45,500
Come.

1125
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,458
Let them get tired. We'll wait.

1126
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,167
Would you like to
have some peanuts?

1127
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,458
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1128
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,750
They are trained fighters.

1129
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:10,542
Thrash this bottle on them first.

1130
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,583
Just blindly wave around.
Some one will be caught.

1131
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:17,833
Brother.

1132
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,292
Boss has informed not to
fight with the cop's men.

1133
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,250
'Moda' Kumar is no more a cop.

1134
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:24,708
Let alone these guys!

1135
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,125
- Come.
- Ok.

1136
01:18:31,375 --> 01:18:33,167
We should be the first to hit.
Remember that.

1137
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,167
Don't be scared.

1138
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,125
You are fine, isn't it?

1139
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:32,917
Yazhini Rajan, right?

1140
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:34,125
Yes.

1141
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,333
Congrats, you have
cleared the first round.

1142
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:38,750
Coming thursday will be
the final interview.

1143
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:40,708
All the best.

1144
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:41,958
Ok. Thank you.

1145
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:46,792
What's this?

1146
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,292
Black forest.

1147
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,417
What does that mean?

1148
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:50,708
That's the cake's name.

1149
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:51,667
Black Forest.

1150
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:53,708
I don't eat all this.

1151
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:54,875
Tell me what the matter is.

1152
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,292
I've cleared the first round.

1153
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:57,833
Round?

1154
01:20:58,542 --> 01:20:59,542
Interview.

1155
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,208
Oh, Interview.

1156
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:02,750
When do you have to join?

1157
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,292
There is one more
round to clear.

1158
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,417
First round was online.
It was through internet.

1159
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,583
Second round is in person. This thursday.

1160
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:10,667
So your job is not
confirmed yet?

1161
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:12,917
It's like I've almost got it.

1162
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,583
First round is the toughest.

1163
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,625
In the second round they don't
bother about the college.

1164
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:18,833
If I answer their questions,
I'll be selected.

1165
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,375
How much will be the salary?

1166
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,542
At least, Rs.35000.

1167
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:24,750
35000?

1168
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,208
What are you saying?

1169
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,042
35000 is a normal figure.

1170
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:34,375
So, you will move
out of this place?

1171
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,042
You will shift to a
bigger house, isn't it?

1172
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:37,875
Yes.

1173
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:42,500
So you will print cards
with your name on it?

1174
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,750
Visiting cards?

1175
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:45,167
I'll get lots of them!

1176
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:47,833
I also have a wish

1177
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:51,042
I too should hand over visiting cards
that reads 'Kathiravan - Bar Owner'

1178
01:21:59,208 --> 01:21:59,542
Hello

1179
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:01,208
Where are you?

1180
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,333
I am out with friends.

1181
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:04,625
Didn't you go for work today?

1182
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,750
No. I am on leave today.

1183
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:08,958
Why do you lie?

1184
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
No. I am telling the truth.

1185
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,625
Give it to me. I'll talk.

1186
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,583
It's been three months since
your company has been shut down.

1187
01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:15,750
What are you doing?

1188
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:16,917
Tell me.

1189
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,292
I have been asking your friends about
what you were doing for three months.

1190
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:23,042
They just told me that none
of them are in Chennai.

1191
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,333
Your mom is worried about you.

1192
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:26,625
Tell me where are you?

1193
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,667
Take the night train

1194
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,542
Dad, I need to tell
you something.

1195
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:30,583
Despite her warnings, I
sent you to Chennai.

1196
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,083
Why do you do this?

1197
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:33,542
Her BP has shot up.

1198
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:37,333
- Listen to me.
- We don't want to listen to you anymore. Do what we tell you.

1199
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:00,208
What happened?

1200
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:02,875
I need to tell you
something important.

1201
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:03,750
What?

1202
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:07,167
To make my unemployment
a smaller issue...

1203
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:10,292
I needed a bigger issue and hence
I've told a lie to my parents.

1204
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:12,375
Fine.

1205
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,250
That I am in love.

1206
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,125
That he is a manager in a big IT company.

1207
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:22,125
That he has arranged
an interview for me.

1208
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:23,542
But dad...

1209
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,875
Wanted me come back to
native along with him.

1210
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,667
Who is that?

1211
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:31,292
You are that manager.

1212
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,042
Sir. Please.

1213
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,667
Sir. I trusted you...

1214
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,083
Do I look like a fool?

1215
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,458
I have the muscle power here.

1216
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:43,042
What if your father
and his men kill me?

1217
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:44,042
What do we do?

1218
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,375
- My dad is soft spoken like the dads in TV Soaps
- Get lost!

1219
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,417
Don't you have any sympathy?

1220
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:55,542
No. What?

1221
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:03,458
I'll thrash you.

1222
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:10,667
Sir please.

1223
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:11,833
Not possible. Get away!

1224
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:13,792
Won't you do at least this
for the girl next door?

1225
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,500
Why should I do it for
the girl next door?

1226
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,167
Get out!

1227
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,708
Who else is there for
me in this town?

1228
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,500
Tell me.

1229
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:23,875
You tell me.

1230
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,375
Who else is there for me here?

1231
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:27,417
You are my only friend.

1232
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:31,125
Am not a friend.

1233
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:32,583
Am the Eskimo dog.

1234
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,333
Remember that?

1235
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:22,292
When are we leaving?

1236
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,750
Isn't this a little too much?

1237
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,333
Your face is very odd.

1238
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:41,458
These are to make it look good.

1239
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:45,292
Next is your beard.

1240
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:54,000
Fine. Recite it once again.

1241
01:25:55,792 --> 01:25:56,583
Again?

1242
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:57,917
Please recite it.

1243
01:25:58,292 --> 01:25:59,375
You might forget.

1244
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:00,667

01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:01,667

1246
01:26:02,292 --> 01:26:03,000

He is a PT master in

1269
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,708
If you ask any more, I might fumble.
Let's stop it.

1270
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:59,792
More than all this
what's more important?

1271
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,500
I should talk less.

1272
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,917
Not less. You should
not talk at all!

1273
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,458
Please be silent as
much as you can.

1274
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:06,708
Fine

1275
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:10,167
When they give you something to eat,
show off by saying you don't want them.

1276
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:15,417
Looking at all these details,

1277
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,750
It seems as though
you've already tried it.

1278
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:22,875
Are you putting me in the place
of the guy who ditched you?

1279
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,375
What?

1280
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:27,083
You blabbered all this
when you were drunk.

1281
01:27:58,917 --> 01:27:59,917
Please have them.

1282
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:05,375
No thanks. I do not eat them.

1283
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,333
What else would you like to have?

1284
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:09,917
Organic.

1285
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,125
Natural foods?

1286
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,542
Like, kodo millet, little
millet, red millet, barnyard millet?

1287
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,333
Just a moment. Vilasini...

1288
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,875
Get me the red millet ball.

1289
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:24,708
The yellow one or the brown one?

1290
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:28,167
Bring both of them.

1291
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:33,667
Please have.

1292
01:28:47,667 --> 01:28:48,667
What did you say is your native?

1293
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:50,958
Pudukottai dad.

1294
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,875
I studied at Pudukottai school.

1295
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:04,208
I completed my college
from St.Joseph's.

1296
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,375
Which course?

1297
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:07,208
MCA dad.

1298
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,750
I didn't ask you.

1299
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,375
I've completed my MCA.

1300
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:19,417
Mom is Velsamy, teacher at a college.

1301
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:20,542
Dad is a housewife.

1302
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:21,583
Bother is a PT...

1303
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,667
PT manager... I am a computer...

1304
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:27,542
Computer...

1305
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,167
Networking master sir.

1306
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:33,542
Another important thing.

1307
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,500
I don't talk much. I would
like to stop with this.

1308
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,583
- You.
- Dad..

1309
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,417
You don't look nervous.

1310
01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:51,917
But you are nervous.

1311
01:29:53,083 --> 01:29:54,083
Shy .

1312
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,167
Be comfortable.

1313
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
You don't have to
be this nervous.

1314
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:04,833
I don't know what Yazhini
has told about us.

1315
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,792
We will not eat you alive!

1316
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:10,250
Be natural.

1317
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,667
It's me here.

1318
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,333
Your date of birth?

1319
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,708
16.01.1981

1320
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,208
16.01.1981

1321
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,500
Your birth time?

1322
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:33,500
7.30

1323
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:35,333
Morning or evening?

1324
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,083
Morning 7.30.

1325
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:39,542
Morning 7.30.

1326
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,833
Please keep it ready. I'll get it later.

1327
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:46,792
It's nice.

1328
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:52,208
Ask them to vacate.

1329
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,417
Call the bar manager.

1330
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:56,167
- We are from the Excise department.
- Tell me.

1331
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:57,833
We are canceling your bar license.

1332
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,625
What are you saying?

1333
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:01,167
There are lot of complaints.

1334
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,542
Please wait. Let
me call the owner.

1335
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:05,125
Talk to anyone. I give
ten minutes time.

1336
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,167
Clear all the customers
and close the bar.

1337
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:10,083
Oh lord!

1338
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:11,542
Son!

1339
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:14,708
Do you have faith in spirituality?

1340
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,167
Yes dad. He has great
interests in spirituality.

1341
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,583
- Is it?
- Yes sir.

1342
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,250
They talk about big
bang theory only now.

1343
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:25,125
Around many thousand years ago...

1344
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,250
We have already said this.

1345
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:28,917
Do you know the meaning of Om?

1346
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:29,792
No sir.

1347
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,542
From a small atom...

1348
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:33,500
When the universe exploded...

1349
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,000
It sounded...

1350
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:40,333
- OM!
- I'll just go to the nearby temple and be right back.

1351
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:48,292
That is how OM came
into existence.

1352
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,250
Why did I start saying this?

1353
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:23,833
Its for some good thing.

1354
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:25,750
There is nothing in our hands.

1355
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:27,583
Everything is pre defined.

1356
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,458
One in a million have a
horoscope like this.

1357
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:32,750
When are you both
getting married?

1358
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:34,917
Marriage?

1359
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,875
Haven't you both thought
of marriage yet?

1360
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,667
Not that...

1361
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,917
We both need to be
prepared for it.

1362
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,292
What is there to get
prepared for it?

1363
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:43,333
That... the girl... Yazhini...

1364
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,458
- Yazhini needs to get a job.
- What does Yazhini know?

1365
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:49,333
Let's decide on an auspicious day
this year and finish the marriage.

1366
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:54,083
Before that we all will meet you
parents and discuss on the marriage

1367
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,417
- How are you?
- Fine fine.

1368
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:59,375
This is Yazhini's friend.

1369
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:01,167
He is a committee
member in the temple.

1370
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:02,792
It's been long since we met.

1371
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:04,333
Hope all the temple
works are fine.

1372
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,792
Shall I go fetch Yazhini?

1373
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
What are you doing here?

1374
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:39,167
There is a dish named
Drunken Prawn.

1375
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:41,458
A bowl..

1376
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,375
Is filled with wine

1377
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:46,708
A prawn is then dropped alive into it.

1378
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:50,375
The prawn drinks the wine
thinking it as water.

1379
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,250
When the prawn is high

1380
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:58,208
It is taken and fried in oil.
Do you know how it tastes?

1381
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:00,875
Think of where we are.
Don't talk such stuff.

1382
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:04,208
Think of the plight
of the prawn.

1383
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,625
That was how your dad fried
me with his lecture..

1384
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:11,000
And you are whiling away
your time here like a queen.

1385
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,625
Don't talk like this and
make me change my decision.

1386
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,125
What is your so called decision?

1387
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:30,792
How much is it?

1388
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,083
It looks expensive.

1389
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:32,792
Yes.

1390
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,583
I bought it for someone else.

1391
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I was unable to give it to him.

1392
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,500
It doesn't matter for
whom you bought.

1393
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:39,917
I am happy if it is free!

1394
01:34:42,917 --> 01:34:43,917
What are you doing here?

1395
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:45,917
Your dad is searching for you.

1396
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:47,208
Come. Let's go.

1397
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:53,292
Can we tell them that
we are getting married?

1398
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:55,917
What did you say?

1399
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:57,292
You heard it.

1400
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:06,667
Please spare me from this game.

1401
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:08,125
I am choking for
just a single day!

1402
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:11,125
Can you please look
for someone else?

1403
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:13,458
Am I being serious?

1404
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,292
It's just a fake.

1405
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,333
It's just for my dad.

1406
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:20,000
Am I nuts to marry you?

1407
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:22,917
I've been watching you.

1408
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:24,958
You are calm to everyone else.

1409
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:27,500
But you frown at me always.

1410
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:28,958
Why?

1411
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:30,708
Cos I am not scared of you!

1412
01:35:32,542 --> 01:35:33,542
So you won't be scared?

1413
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:34,542
Why should I?

1414
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:37,125
I am going to thump your face.

1415
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:40,208
Will thump you for sure.

1416
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:47,458
Thanks.

1417
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:57,708
Yazhini.

1418
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,667
- Hope you know.
- Greetings.

1419
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,125
He is our temple's
committee member.

1420
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:02,417
This is my daughter.

1421
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:07,083
If everything goes well, she
will mostly settle in Chennai.

1422
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:12,042
Tell me dude.

1423
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:13,958
Didn't I warn you many times?

1424
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:15,000
What dude?

1425
01:36:16,542 --> 01:36:18,542
You thrashed the
Karate kids, isn't it?

1426
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:20,292
They have sealed our bar.

1427
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:22,917
They are trying to seal our
Purasawalkam bar as well.

1428
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:31,458
You told me not to
hit 'Moda' Kumar.

1429
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:32,917
When did I tell you that?

1430
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:34,333
I'll come back and discuss.

1431
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,458
Where are you? Come
back here immediately.

1432
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,125
I can't come.

1433
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:42,250
I've spent a lakh
for your mistake.

1434
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:44,167
Will you come now or not?

1435
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:50,042
Chuck it.

1436
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:52,958
You should have thumped his face.
Why did you stop me?

1437
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,833
He is our friend. You
don't know all that.

1438
01:36:59,042 --> 01:37:00,542
They would've thought that
we are not macho enough.

1439
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:01,792
We should face them.

1440
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,583
I am fed up of such issues.

1441
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:04,750
That's true.

1442
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:06,667
We'll use someone
else to finish it.

1443
01:37:07,042 --> 01:37:08,042
People are jobless here.

1444
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:17,083
Do I look like a moron?

1445
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:26,458
I am talking to you.

1446
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,583
Buy a new one.

1447
01:37:30,167 --> 01:37:31,792
Do I look like a beggar?

1448
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:53,042
She says that he is a rogue.

1449
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:54,542
What kind of a kid do we have!

1450
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:55,875
You had warned me.

1451
01:38:56,542 --> 01:38:57,792
Not to pamper. I never heeded.

1452
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:01,292
I'll beg and get her a job here.

1453
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:03,125
Ask her to change her ways.

1454
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:05,250
The younger one may follow her example.

1455
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,042
We'll find a groom and get
her married off by this year.

1456
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:15,208
What's this Kathiravan!

1457
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:18,167
What do I do with you?

1458
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:21,667
What brother?

1459
01:39:23,542 --> 01:39:26,000
You promised that I would be great
when I come back from prison.

1460
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:27,958
Now you ask this?

1461
01:39:28,917 --> 01:39:31,250
Are we nuts here?

1462
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:37,958
What are you saying?

1463
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,083
I didn't mean that.

1464
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:42,958
Kathiravan...

1465
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:44,625
Its a huge loss.

1466
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,500
As the hierarchy goes
up, we'll be done for!

1467
01:39:48,542 --> 01:39:49,042
Do you understand?

1468
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:50,625
Go and meet 'Moda' Kumar.

1469
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:55,125
Don't ask me to meet him.

1470
01:39:55,958 --> 01:39:56,667
I have to give his share.

1471
01:39:57,125 --> 01:40:00,750
We can open the bar only if you fall
at his feet and give his share.

1472
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:04,333
Fall at his feet?

1473
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:06,958
Why should I?

1474
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:13,083
We have no choice.

1475
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,667
Only you can undo the
mistake you committed.

1476
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:18,208
You aspire to be a bar owner.

1477
01:40:18,583 --> 01:40:19,583
Compromise a little.

1478
01:40:20,417 --> 01:40:21,417
Solve the issue.

1479
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:51,625
The rent is only 8000.

1480
01:40:51,917 --> 01:40:54,250
We can still negotiate.

1481
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:55,292
Ok.

1482
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:57,500
Greeting sir.

1483
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:00,667
The girl's parents have
asked to vacate the house.

1484
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:01,958
Do you know what the issue is?

1485
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:06,667
Load that first.

1486
01:41:36,292 --> 01:41:37,292
What day is today?

1487
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,125
Father's day.

1488
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:42,000
Not that. What day
of the week is it?

1489
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,250
Thursday.

1490
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:01,917
Hello

1491
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:03,333
Do you need so long
to pick the call?

1492
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:04,292
Where are you?

1493
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,250
- Home.
- What are you doing there when your interview is here.

1494
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,333
What bothers you?

1495
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:10,667
Buffalo

1496
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,375
I've been considerate and
you ask me such things!

1497
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:14,625
Is that why you picked up a quarrel
with someone and left me here?

1498
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:15,750
That is me.

1499
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:18,125
No good attire can
change the character.

1500
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:19,458
You and your father...

1501
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:20,875
Forget it. It's not about me.

1502
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,750
What are you going to do?
Are you coming or not?

1503
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:25,458
I can't do anything anymore.

1504
01:42:26,083 --> 01:42:27,083
What time is your interview?

1505
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:30,542
I asked, what time
is the interview?

1506
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:31,667
It's at 12.

1507
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:33,375
You start right now.

1508
01:42:34,542 --> 01:42:36,500
It'll be 2 o'clock by the time I reach.
It's a waste.

1509
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,375
- Dad is..
- Stop cribbing.

1510
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,208
Your interview will
be at 2 o'clock only.

1511
01:42:41,667 --> 01:42:42,250
I'll take care of that.

1512
01:42:43,208 --> 01:42:44,208
You start immediately.

1513
01:42:44,417 --> 01:42:45,417
Message me the office address.

1514
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:48,458
You don't understand.
It'll be a big issue.

1515
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,500
Get lost!

1516
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:02,292
What now?

1517
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:03,250
I've started.

1518
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:05,375
Come fast.

1519
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:09,875
Drive home.

1520
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:11,333
Ok.

1521
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:50,958
- Where are you girls going?
- Go go. Go fast.

1522
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:52,292
Tell me where you are going.

1523
01:43:58,042 --> 01:43:59,375
- All the best. Bye.
- Bye.

1524
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:09,042
Dad.

1525
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:12,292
I am going for an interview at Chennai.
I came to inform you.

1526
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,833
- Yazhini..
- Give me this chance. Don't stop me.

1527
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:25,167
I'll come back tomorrow.
Trust me.

1528
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,375
- Yazhini..
- Please don't say anything.

1529
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:32,042
It's getting late. Start now.
We'll discuss when you are back.

1530
01:44:35,917 --> 01:44:36,417
Bye dad.

1531
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:53,750
What will you tell
if Sampath asks?

1532
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:55,917
I don't know.

1533
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:58,917
Say that you didn't
find me at my house.

1534
01:45:00,167 --> 01:45:00,708
Fine.

1535
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:32,208
Hi. Good morning.

1536
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,250
- Yes.
- Interview? Where?

1537
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
What interview?

1538
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:40,000
This.

1539
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,417
This is on the third floor.

1540
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:48,125
Thank you.

1541
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:01,042
Where is the
interview happening?

1542
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:02,292
It's inside. You are?

1543
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:05,958
My brother has left his mark sheet and
I need to hand it over. Moreover...

1544
01:46:06,375 --> 01:46:08,333
He doesn't have cash
to travel back.

1545
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:11,333
Go straight and
take the last left.

1546
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:13,375
- This way?
- Yes.

1547
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:16,125
Thank you.

1548
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:31,375
- Interview?
- Yes sir.

1549
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:40,000
Arun. You can go in.

1550
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:45,333
- Sir.
- Yes

1551
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:46,833
Where should I get down
if I have to reach Avadi?

1552
01:46:46,917 --> 01:46:49,208
Get down at Tambaram and
take the bypass road.

1553
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:56,750
He is cutting the call.

1554
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:05,042
Is he playing with me?

1555
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:06,125
I don’t know.

1556
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,375
Brother.

1557
01:47:12,208 --> 01:47:13,208
Come to the station.
We need to discuss.

1558
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:36,583
Where are you?

1559
01:47:37,167 --> 01:47:37,833
I've reached Tambaram.

1560
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:39,000
I'll be there in an hour.

1561
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,125
Come fast.

1562
01:47:48,417 --> 01:47:49,833
Yazhini, you can get in.

1563
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:56,875
Another 4 or 5 should be..

1564
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:00,417
No body seems to be
impressive enough.

1565
01:48:00,833 --> 01:48:04,208
Though they have good grades,
they don't have the knowledge.

1566
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:22,375
- Water
- Sure

1567
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,500
Thanks.

1568
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,500
What is this?

1569
01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:56,458
Who are you?

1570
01:48:57,958 --> 01:48:58,958
That you have to tell me.

1571
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:00,625
See

1572
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,375
Interview is going on.

1573
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,500
Are you a candidate?

1574
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:07,708
That you have to tell me.

1575
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:10,792
Do you understand?

1576
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:12,458
Interview is going on.

1577
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:13,917
You cannot come inside.

1578
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:15,500
You may please leave.

1579
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:19,167
Why?

1580
01:49:21,917 --> 01:49:23,500
I think there is something wrong here.

1581
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,208
Chandru.

1582
01:49:25,542 --> 01:49:26,667
Sit down.

1583
01:49:28,667 --> 01:49:29,292
Sit down.

1584
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:32,083
Cool Chandru.

1585
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:43,500
What is your name?

1586
01:49:44,792 --> 01:49:45,792
Kothandaraman.

1587
01:49:48,083 --> 01:49:49,083
Your name?

1588
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:51,083
Chandrakumar.

1589
01:49:51,417 --> 01:49:52,417
Nice name, isn't it?

1590
01:49:54,917 --> 01:49:56,458
Isn't this place very
near to Chennai?

1591
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:58,125
How much is the land rates here?

1592
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:02,792
If you don't like what I am
asking, you can ask me something.

1593
01:50:04,417 --> 01:50:05,417
Let's have some fun and
while away the time.

1594
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:14,458
Can you please stop the music?

1595
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,250
Why? Isn't it good?

1596
01:50:19,208 --> 01:50:20,208
You look tensed.

1597
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:23,083
Yeah. Job interview.

1598
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:24,542
Interview.

1599
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,208
I don't believe in all that.

1600
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,250
If you see..

1601
01:50:28,792 --> 01:50:30,708
Life is a time pass.

1602
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Your breath rate is wrong.

1603
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:50,583
I have wheezing trouble
when am stressed.

1604
01:50:50,708 --> 01:50:51,417
Tension?

1605
01:50:51,875 --> 01:50:52,875
Yes.

1606
01:50:57,208 --> 01:50:58,792
You know spinach.

1607
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:00,875
Take a handful of it.

1608
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:02,500
4 Thulasi leaves.

1609
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:03,667
Chandru

1610
01:51:04,125 --> 01:51:05,125
Can you hand me over your phone?

1611
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:07,875
Our Chandru...

1612
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:09,333
Thinks he is a James Bond.

1613
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:13,083
Why Chandru?

1614
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:15,708
Where did I stop?

1615
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,500
4 Thulasi leaves.

1616
01:51:20,042 --> 01:51:21,208
Can you go faster?

1617
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:22,875
I understand.

1618
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,458
The car will not go beyond 70.

1619
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:25,500
It's locked.

1620
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:28,875
These employers!!

1621
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:31,583
Forget it.

1622
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:35,333
Join the thumb and
the index finger...

1623
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,500
Place it near your ears.

1624
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,833
If you close the eyes and meditate.

1625
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:44,250
All the...

1626
01:51:49,167 --> 01:51:50,167
All problems.

1627
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,500
Will get clear solutions.

1628
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:56,625
You try now.

1629
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:02,375
Help! Help!

1630
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:04,333
- How dare you!
- Oh shit!

1631
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,500
Security.

1632
01:52:05,833 --> 01:52:08,208
- Come here.
- Sit down. Sit down.

1633
01:52:09,292 --> 01:52:10,292
I'll thrash you.

1634
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:13,917
If you make any noise... Kothandaraman.

1635
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:15,125
You continue.

1636
01:52:15,333 --> 01:52:16,333
I'll thrash you.

1637
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,208
- All the best.
- Thanks.

1638
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:36,708
Come. Get hold of him.

1639
01:52:50,417 --> 01:52:51,583
Just a thing.

1640
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:52,875
Just one thing.

1641
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:54,208
Easy. Leave him.

1642
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:55,042
Leave him.

1643
01:52:55,458 --> 01:52:56,208
He wants to say something.

1644
01:52:56,708 --> 01:52:57,292
Tell me.

1645
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:02,542
Interview?

1646
01:53:05,417 --> 01:53:06,542
Sorry sir!

1647
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:08,750
Why did you do this?

1648
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:10,667
Sir.

1649
01:53:12,583 --> 01:53:14,125
Some opportunities come
only once in life.

1650
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
If we miss that...

1651
01:53:21,042 --> 01:53:22,958
The rest of the life will be ruined
thinking of the missed opportunity.

1652
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:24,958
Fine.

1653
01:53:25,875 --> 01:53:26,875
For whom did you do this?

1654
01:53:28,708 --> 01:53:30,125
That you have to tell me.

1655
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,250
Take him away.

1656
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:50,667
Okay. Okay.

1657
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:51,875
Okay.

1658
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:53,292
Okay.

1659
01:53:53,875 --> 01:53:54,875
I said, I'll find my way.

1660
01:53:58,833 --> 01:53:59,292
Sorry.

1661
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,042
Sorry.

1662
01:54:11,125 --> 01:54:11,583
Sit down.

1663
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:21,000
Sit down.

1664
01:54:21,792 --> 01:54:22,792
Sit down!

1665
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:26,792
Who is Yazhini?

1666
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:27,958
Yes.

1667
01:54:28,042 --> 01:54:29,208
Please go inside.

1668
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:33,750
Where are you from?

1669
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:35,708
I am from Villupuram

1670
01:54:38,292 --> 01:54:41,333
Yazhini, Why should we hire you?

1671
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:44,250
I am honest and hardworking.

1672
01:54:45,042 --> 01:54:46,042
Hardworking is fine.

1673
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:48,333
Are you really talented enough?

1674
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:50,250
That you have to tell me.

1675
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:55,875
What I meant was, I believe
that I am eligible but it..

1676
01:54:55,958 --> 01:54:59,250
No. Don't mistake us.
It is something else.

1677
01:55:00,667 --> 01:55:01,083
Okay.

1678
01:55:01,792 --> 01:55:04,583
Can you tell us what is the
next big thing in networking?

1679
01:55:07,042 --> 01:55:08,208
It should be SDN.

1680
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,708
Software Defined Networking.

1681
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:44,208
And finally the application.

1682
01:55:45,667 --> 01:55:46,417
Well

1683
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,750
You have attended many interviews.

1684
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:51,083
You have developed your networking skills.

1685
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:52,875
Why were you not placed yet?

1686
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:55,125
Any particular reason?

1687
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,167
Nobody asked me these questions.

1688
01:55:59,542 --> 01:56:01,542
Ms. Yazhini.

1689
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:04,083
We are very impressed.

1690
01:56:05,417 --> 01:56:08,708
I think you are the one
we are looking for.

1691
01:56:11,167 --> 01:56:12,542
- Thank you sir.
- You are welcome.

1692
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:51,083
Kathir. The car is here.

1693
01:56:52,542 --> 01:56:53,333
Boss is here.

1694
01:56:56,125 --> 01:56:57,125
Why didn't you call?

1695
01:56:57,292 --> 01:56:58,667
I tried but your number
was not reachable.

1696
01:56:58,917 --> 01:56:59,542
Is Durai here?

1697
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,542
Everything is solved
and fine now.

1698
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,333
It's 'Moda' Kumar's work. He takes
his share and creates trouble.

1699
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:05,625
No. Our Sampath has
had some lose talks.

1700
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:08,625
Sampath is not like that. You
know what trouble they gave him?

1701
01:57:08,917 --> 01:57:10,458
They called him to discuss.

1702
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,917
Why have they not
let him out yet?

1703
01:57:13,958 --> 01:57:14,750
Who did this?

1704
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,917
Tell me who did this?

1705
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:19,208
- It's alright. Not here boss.
- It's all 'Moda' Kumar's work.

1706
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:20,958
Leave me. Let me handle this.

1707
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,583
I should be furious.

1708
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:24,375
We'll discuss at home.

1709
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,375
Come now.

1710
01:57:27,042 --> 01:57:28,208
Didn't I ask you to
fall at his feet?

1711
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:29,875
Why are you so egoistic?

1712
01:57:30,208 --> 01:57:31,292
If you can't tell me,
I'll fall at his feet.

1713
01:57:34,792 --> 01:57:36,250
It's not about falling at his feet.

1714
01:57:37,875 --> 01:57:40,792
'Moda' Kumar is planning to open a
bar in his brother-in-law's name.

1715
01:57:42,083 --> 01:57:44,417
He takes bribes from us
and conspires against us.

1716
01:57:44,542 --> 01:57:45,542
What are you saying?

1717
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:47,708
Hey. Move out.

1718
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:49,708
Move out.

1719
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:51,083
We need to talk in private.

1720
01:57:55,333 --> 01:57:56,833
He has grown.

1721
01:57:58,208 --> 01:57:59,208
Moda Kumar is unstoppable.

1722
01:58:00,417 --> 01:58:02,500
He has been holding the grudge against
us ever since he was the inspector.

1723
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:03,583
So?

1724
01:58:05,667 --> 01:58:07,583
Let's finish him off.
That's the only solution.

1725
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:10,125
Don't be stupid.

1726
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:11,208
No.

1727
01:58:12,125 --> 01:58:13,125
If we don't finish him.

1728
01:58:13,708 --> 01:58:14,708
He will destroy us.

1729
01:58:15,917 --> 01:58:17,417
Look at what he is talking.

1730
01:58:17,708 --> 01:58:19,083
We have crossed all that long back.

1731
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:21,708
Moda Kumar should not be alive.

1732
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:23,000
Let's face it.

1733
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:25,542
Don't blabber out of rage.

1734
01:58:25,958 --> 01:58:26,667
It's not that.

1735
01:58:27,417 --> 01:58:29,250
It is being talked that
we have softened up.

1736
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:30,958
Let's finish him.

1737
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:33,792
Hey Kathir.

1738
01:58:34,917 --> 01:58:35,750
You must do it.

1739
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:37,167
No!

1740
01:58:37,458 --> 01:58:39,458
- We can't trust anyone.
- No dude!

1741
01:58:40,333 --> 01:58:42,958
I cannot get landed in prison again.
Look for someone else.

1742
01:58:43,792 --> 01:58:44,958
Are you scared?

1743
01:58:48,125 --> 01:58:49,708
If I was scared, I
wouldn't be talking here.

1744
01:58:49,958 --> 01:58:51,542
That's why I said,
you must do it.

1745
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,333
Why do you surrender?

1746
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:54,958
We'll ask someone
else to surrender.

1747
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,083
Don't think.

1748
01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:04,208
Let's finish it.

1749
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:14,458
Hey girl.

1750
01:59:15,333 --> 01:59:16,917
It's misty. Get inside.

1751
01:59:17,917 --> 01:59:18,917
Ok grandpa!

1752
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,500
Did you blabber anywhere?

1753
01:59:42,792 --> 01:59:43,792
No. I didn't tell anyone.

1754
01:59:45,917 --> 01:59:47,250
The families will not understand.

1755
01:59:48,708 --> 01:59:49,708
Let the time come. I'll inform.

1756
01:59:53,208 --> 01:59:54,708
What you are about to
do is something great.

1757
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:56,875
We will never forget you.

1758
01:59:57,750 --> 01:59:58,833
Five or six years.

1759
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,667
When you are out of prison, you
will be taken care of like a king.

1760
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:03,958
You are one of us. Understand?

1761
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:07,417
Don't think too much.
Understand?

1762
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
- Hey Murali
- Brother

1763
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:28,333
Are you scared?

1764
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:29,208
No.

1765
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:31,208
You should be scared.

1766
02:00:31,917 --> 02:00:32,667
Understood?

1767
02:00:38,583 --> 02:00:39,292
What are you going to do?

1768
02:00:40,292 --> 02:00:42,458
When you kill him, I'll
confirm if he is dead.

1769
02:00:42,708 --> 02:00:44,458
I'll take the knife and
surrender at K4 station.

1770
02:00:48,167 --> 02:00:49,250
Isn't it very easy to say?

1771
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:53,792
'Moda' Kumar was once a cop.

1772
02:00:55,875 --> 02:00:57,250
The cops will have a
soft corner on him.

1773
02:00:57,958 --> 02:00:58,958
They will gruel you
for the truth.

1774
02:00:59,625 --> 02:01:01,375
If you blurt out, the whole
gang will be imprisoned.

1775
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:03,708
Do you understand?

1776
02:01:10,458 --> 02:01:11,458
You idiot.

1777
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:15,375
Wait. Let me pee.

1778
02:01:28,292 --> 02:01:29,458
Looks like its going to rain.

1779
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:31,083
What?

1780
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:34,667
There was a radio announcement
that it would rain.

1781
02:01:34,875 --> 02:01:36,042
Looks like it will rain.

1782
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:39,958
Sorry.

1783
02:01:54,167 --> 02:01:55,167
Murali.

1784
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:56,875
You don't need this.

1785
02:01:57,875 --> 02:01:58,708
You leave.

1786
02:01:58,958 --> 02:01:59,500
Why?

1787
02:02:00,375 --> 02:02:00,875
No.

1788
02:02:01,375 --> 02:02:02,375
You don't need this.

1789
02:02:03,417 --> 02:02:05,208
Find a job in a petrol
station or something.

1790
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:06,750
I'll take care of this.

1791
02:02:07,292 --> 02:02:07,792
You leave now.

1792
02:02:08,458 --> 02:02:09,458
No. I'll do it.

1793
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:10,875
You fool.

1794
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,042
What do you think?

1795
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,500
Do you know what's
happening here?

1796
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:15,625
I know.

1797
02:02:16,083 --> 02:02:16,958
Like hell you know!

1798
02:02:18,708 --> 02:02:20,292
Do you think they'll celebrate you
when you are back from prison?

1799
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
No one will be there for you.

1800
02:02:24,958 --> 02:02:27,208
Look at me. What am I doing?

1801
02:02:29,042 --> 02:02:30,458
It will be the same
for you as well.

1802
02:02:34,083 --> 02:02:35,083
I asked you to leave.

1803
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:37,750
Why do you do this?

1804
02:02:37,958 --> 02:02:39,167
What did I do?

1805
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:41,458
I am telling you.

1806
02:02:43,958 --> 02:02:45,375
I'll not falter. I'll do it.

1807
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,375
What will you not falter?

1808
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:50,167
Didn't I tell you to leave?

1809
02:02:52,917 --> 02:02:53,917
Why do you argue?

1810
02:02:57,542 --> 02:02:58,292
Listen up.

1811
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:00,583
That is all.

1812
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:04,625
If I see you roaming around here.

1813
02:03:05,917 --> 02:03:06,500
I will thrash you.

1814
02:03:08,833 --> 02:03:09,833
I will kill you.

1815
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:12,750
Go now. Go.

1816
02:03:14,167 --> 02:03:14,625
Go.

1817
02:03:16,958 --> 02:03:17,958
Go.

1818
02:03:46,208 --> 02:03:47,625
You guys pay only when we coax.

1819
02:03:47,875 --> 02:03:48,875
How much is it?

1820
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,500
They have given 6 lakhs.

1821
02:03:56,667 --> 02:03:57,667
You will get it.

1822
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:10,167
Why is it not arranged?

1823
02:04:10,875 --> 02:04:11,875
Why haven't the work started?

1824
02:04:13,583 --> 02:04:14,833
Will you start only if we pay?

1825
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,250
Why does everyone ask for money?

1826
02:04:21,208 --> 02:04:22,208
Respect the people.

1827
02:04:25,542 --> 02:04:27,000
I'll take care of
you guys one day.

1828
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:47,292
Trying to stab my back?

1829
02:09:07,208 --> 02:09:08,667
This is the floor you
will be working.

1830
02:09:09,667 --> 02:09:10,667

1840
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:36,333
And now..

And she will tell you all
about this in detail.

1843
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
How to go about it.

1844
02:09:43,292 --> 02:09:44,375
And how to achieve the targets

1845
02:09:44,792 --> 02:09:45,250
All these things.

1846
02:09:46,833 --> 02:09:49,083
It's a very good opportunity
for all of you to learn.

1847

It's great that you made it here.

1852

Thank you mam.

1853
02:10:08,125 --> 02:10:09,958
When I was struggling in my life...

1854
02:10:10,333 --> 02:10:11,333
There was one who stood by me.

1855
02:10:12,417 --> 02:10:13,583
I have never seen him after that.

1856
02:10:14,833 --> 02:10:15,833
I did see him once.

1857
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:17,542
In my dream

1858
02:10:24,875 --> 02:10:26,417
Is this your office?

1859
02:10:27,917 --> 02:10:28,917
Oh my god!

1860
02:10:30,667 --> 02:10:31,875
So you finally got a job?

1861
02:10:33,167 --> 02:10:34,167
I must thank you.

02:10:35,667 --> 02:10:36,792
You cleared the interview.

1863
02:10:37,417 --> 02:10:39,250
You have got what you deserved.

1864
02:10:43,792 --> 02:10:44,792
Did you print the cards?

1865
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:46,750
Visiting card?

1866
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:48,667
You said you would give
me a box full of it.

1867
02:10:50,708 --> 02:10:51,958
A card with your name on it.

1868
02:10:52,167 --> 02:10:53,167
A handsome salary.

1869
02:10:54,875 --> 02:10:55,958
Isn't this a little
too much for you?

1870
02:10:57,375 --> 02:10:58,375
You have not changed a bit.

1871
02:10:58,792 --> 02:10:59,792
But you have changed.

1872
02:11:00,833 --> 02:11:02,333
Too much of make up.

1873
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:05,250
You have become more classy.

1874
02:11:05,958 --> 02:11:07,000
I've grown up!

1875
02:11:09,167 --> 02:11:11,042
You were beautiful earlier.

1876
02:11:11,625 --> 02:11:12,333
What about now?

1877
02:11:12,542 --> 02:11:13,250
Don't fight!

1878
02:11:13,542 --> 02:11:14,542
You are beautiful even now!

1879
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:20,625
All what I wish for
is just one thing.

1880
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:23,458
I want to show you how my life
has changed for the better.

1881
02:11:24,708 --> 02:11:27,208
I know that you will be the most
happiest person to know it.

1882
02:12:22,833 --> 02:12:24,292

Please check the zero reading.

1886
02:12:47,125 --> 02:12:48,125
