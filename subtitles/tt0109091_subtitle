1
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,935
Baba! Listen..

2
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,195
Brother's here.

3
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,101
Bijli, listen.. brother has come.

4
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:43,045
You! He might be your brother,
but he's my would-be husband.

5
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,682
Aunt, listen.. my brother has come.
- Ok.

6
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,214
My brother has come.

7
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,951
Some girls are crazy about
their lovers, their husbands..

8
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,617
..but she's crazy for her brother.

9
00:01:55,682 --> 00:02:02,691
Her brother is everything for her.

10
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,563
True. People worship God..

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,701
..but this girl
worships only her brother.

12
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,411
He's an angel!

13
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,482
True. He works as a driver and
gets our goods from the city.

14
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,995
Got our stuff?
- Yes.

15
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,999
Pumpkin for Shehnaz,
cucumber for As
am..

16
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,336
His watch.. here you are.

17
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,110
Comb for lyengar..
here's uncle's cloth..

18
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,078
..potatoes for the priest,
sweet potatoes for you..

19
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,613
Cigarettes for Mohan..
- Give it to me.

20
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,653
And here are Bij
i's bangles.
- You only get bangles for me.

21
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,023
When will you put them in my hand?

22
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:10,200
That's not my cup of tea.
Search for someone else.

23
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,767
Did you get spinach for me?
- Wait, aunt.

24
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,145
I'm running out of breath.
- Careful..

25
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,046
First it's Mr. Rajeshwar's turn.

26
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,150
Lord Hanuman's photo.
You had asked for it.

27
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,790
Good! It's an auspicious day too.

28
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,192
Aunt here's your
spinach and meat for you.

29
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,162
Oh God! This is sin!
- What happened?

30
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,796
You gave me meat.
- Oh God!

31
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,269
And veggies for me?
- Oh God!

32
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,276
One minute. Just exchange it.
Everything will be alright.

33
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,310
Someday you will get beaten
for the pranks you play on them.

34
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,175
You've grown up but you
still behave like a kid.

35
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,181
Keep all the stuff out.
They will take what they need.

36
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,518
Alright.
- Make it fast.

37
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,621
Hey Vijay, the bangles are lovely!
When will you.. - You!

38
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,824
When will you..

39
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,208
Ms. Vandana, the medicine which
you had asked for your child..

40
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,416
You didn't tell me about it.
What happened to him?

41
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,114
The water in the well
has become polluted.

42
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,589
He drank that water
and has fallen sick.

43
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,721
Munna, take the
medicine and you will be fine.

44
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,333
God, let the rains shower!

45
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,641
God, let the rains shower!

46
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:11,588
God, let the rains shower!

47
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:19,893
Quench their thirst and
grant them a new life.

48
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,727
God, let the rains shower!

49
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:32,837
God, let the rains shower!

50
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:39,342
God, let the rains shower!

51
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:45,185
God, let the rains shower!

52
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:51,720
God, let the rains shower!

53
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:59,694
Quench their thirst and
grant them a new life.

54
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:07,674
Grant them a new life.

55
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:15,685
Grant them a new life.

56
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:32,461
Brother, you dig the pot out as
soon as you come from the city.

57
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,338
It already has money and
you add more money to it.

58
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,600
What's all this?
- This is a bank.

59
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,506
It has an account in your name.

60
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,974
I'm saving money for your marriage.

61
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,289
After all, it's a brother's duty.

62
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,896
What's this?
- Our father's memento.

63
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,796
He used to wear it.

64
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,901
Don't keep it. Our
father used to wear it..

65
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,838
But now onwards my
brother will wear it.

66
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,784
Hurry up, serve the food.
I'm famished.

67
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,305
You care for me like a daughter..

68
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,313
..not even my daughter would do so.

69
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,008
Really? Uncle..

70
00:07:53,739 --> 00:08:00,987
When brother is out of the city,
it's you who looks after me!

71
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:10,060
Since my daughter is dead, I
look upon you as my daughter.

72
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,870
One shouldn't lament
over the dead one's.

73
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,067
You should enjoy life with
the one's who are with you.

74
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,437
You are a kid and you
preach like a grandma.

75
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,539
Have your food, I'll leave.

76
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,612
Listen..
- What's it?

77
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,654
Ask your brother to meet me
before leaving for the city. - Ok.

78
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,853
We've to solve the water
problem which we are facing.

79
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,362
Okay, I will tell him!

80
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,899
Folks, there was no
rainfall this year.

81
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,098
All the wells have dried up.

82
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,105
There's only one well
which has a little water in it.

83
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,410
The water is polluted.
There's more of dirt in it.

84
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,777
You will find only greenery
in Mr. Lankeshwar's region.

85
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,008
His wells are full of water.

86
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,678
And the canal too
flows through his region.

87
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,389
Rajeshwar, Lankeshwar is
your brother, isn't it?

88
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,889
Speak no more about him.

89
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,386
You think he will keep my word
and give you people the water?

90
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:17,966
Even if everyone dies of thirst,
he'll not give a drop of water.

91
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,130
He is cruel and inhuman.
That's why I hate him.

92
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,572
Rajeshwar.. cool down.

93
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,978
Forget your anger for the
benefit of this village.

94
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,576
And seek Lankeshwar's help.
- It's of no use.

95
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,590
It's no harm if we seek a
little water for the villagers.

96
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,422
We aren't going to fight.
We will request him.

97
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,694
Alright. As you people wish.

98
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,979
Why have you come here?
- To meet Thakur (landlord).

99
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,984
He doesn't meet
poor people like you.

100
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:15,685
Shut up! Else you will
face dire consequences.

101
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,520
Tell him his brother
Rajeshwar wants to see him.

102
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,459
Whoever you might be, my
duty is to guard the water here.

103
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:27,095
Bravo! The politicians keep a
stronghold over their power.

104
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,464
The goons over the property
but keeping a stronghold..

105
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,475
..over the water.. this
is something new to me.

106
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:37,480
Better get lost or you'll be
killed. - We want to meet Thakur.

107
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,814
He will not listen to your nonsense!

108
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,187
He can at least hear our pleas!

109
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,487
My child has fallen sick
clue to the polluted water.

110
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:57,000
Look over there.. we
are dying of thirst..

111
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,496
..and you people are
bathing an animal in the water!

112
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,639
She's not merely an animal
but Thakur's favorite one.

113
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,734
Thakur has only her milk.
What if we bathe her in water..

114
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,521
What are you doing? He'll die.

115
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,114
Leave him.

116
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,021
I'm Thakur Lankeshwar.

117
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:34,133
This is my Lanka (region).
And I'm the Lord here.

118
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,171
Bravo, young man! That was fun!

119
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,014
Look at his zeal! Look
at his youthfulness!

120
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,545
And here he is, to fight for water.

121
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,558
Sir, people usually fight
for wealth and property..

122
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,923
..not over water.

123
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,193
Brother, we aren't here to
fight but to request you for water.

124
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:12,572
Rajeshwar, God has gifted
us with the same looks..

125
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:17,842
..but our fates are different.
You are indeed unfortunate!

126
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:23,581
Alright, I might be
poor and unfortunate.

127
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,987
I beg of you to
please give us some water.

128
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,995
I will give away all the
wells to the villagers.

129
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:39,895
I won't mind at all.
Take as much water you need.

130
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,907
Thank you, sir!

131
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,846
Sir, you are great! Thank you!

132
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,781
Brother, you've done a good deed!

133
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,148
Sir, what's this?

134
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:33,380
Young man, you started
off before listening to me.

135
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,226
What more?
- Take as much water you need.

136
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:44,659
But I too should benefit. In
exchange, I need your lands.

137
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,805
Give and take!

138
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,669
No, dear.

139
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,674
100 buckets of water
for one acre of land.

140
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,275
10 million buckets of
water for a thousand acre.

141
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,882
You want our lands for free!

142
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,691
Indeed I'm a businessman!

143
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,425
What a barter system!
Land in lieu for water.

144
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,964
Everything else is worthless.

145
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,693
Only one's need has a price!

146
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:27,866
No one dares to take a
drop of water from here!

147
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,319
No, brother.
- Don't heed him.

148
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,355
No, brother.
- Stop him.

149
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,323
Don't, he'll kill you.
- Listen to me.

150
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:46,157
Thakur, fear the God.

151
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,456
You won't know when He could strike.

152
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,996
Too much of pride will destroy you!

153
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,737
Remember, they are dying
of thirst. Their curse..

154
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,300
...will destroy your happiness.

155
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,476
I curse you!

156
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,420
You will beg for death, I curse you!

157
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,482
Let's go. Let's go.

158
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,153
Come, Munna.

159
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,372
I'll possess.. their lands one day!

160
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:39,311
I hide a volcano within me!
I'm known as Lankeshwar!

161
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,776
This is my region
and I'm the Lord here.

162
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,853
Lankeshwar!

163
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,392
Vijay, didn't I tell you,
he's a fool, an idiot!

164
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,263
He'll not part with a drop of water.

165
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,125
He has not done a good deed.
Why will he benefit us?

166
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,838
I agree, all our
hopes are shattered.

167
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,099
But there's still a hope.
The Collector.

168
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,810
If the government installs a
tube well in our village..

169
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,540
..it will solve our water problem.

170
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,805
They are big shots. It
will take us some time.

171
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,813
Even fortune doesn't have
time to look upon this village!

172
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,826
We've to fight the bad times
and somehow meet the Collector.

173
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,175
It's five p.m.
now. Meet me tomorrow.

174
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,144
Sir, please listen to me.
- Not at any cost.

175
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:49,579
It's months now, please
show some mercy on us.

176
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,517
I can't do anything.
- Assume you're still on duty.

177
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,890
Strange person! Can't
you see? My duty's over.

178
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,590
What are you doing?

179
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,512
I'll not let you move till
the clock doesn't strike five.

180
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,482
What do you want?
- A tube well for our village.

181
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:26,550
Sir, there has been no rainfall
in our village since three years.

182
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,353
The woman have to get
water from far off places.

183
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:35,462
Even those wells have dried up.
The whole village is in a fix.

184
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,893
Can't your government
install a tube well in our village?

185
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:46,503
It's not so easy. Do
you know it's cost?

186
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,069
Thirty thousand.

187
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,246
One lakh tube wells
have to be installed.

188
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:59,284
That amounts to 30 crores.
The government lacks the funds

189
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,256
As soon as we have the funds,
we'll install the tube well.

190
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,054
I promise.
- I have understood.

191
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,930
Your duty is really over.
You can leave.

192
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,401
Tell me, pal. How was your exam?

193
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,638
Look..

194
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,418
What's wrong with Vijay? Let's see.

195
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,158
Vijay, what happened?
- Why are you sad?

196
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:41,489
Speak up! - Why are you
sitting here quietly? - Speak up.

197
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:09,424
Hitler attacked Mussolini".

198
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:14,530
And Bush fired a
missile on Saddam.

199
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,610
What does the world wish?
Only money.

200
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,737
All the relations are
merely based on money.

201
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,074
You need love, spend money.

202
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,348
You need a lover,
spend some money.

203
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:49,022
Everyone here is a cheat.
From an officer to a top one.

204
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,625
Black marketers are now in
the open. And the thieves too.

205
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,766
Politics is in a great mess.

206
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,607
Shame on this system.
There's no democracy.

207
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,545
Get rid of these politicians.

208
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,080
The gong has struck..

209
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,310
Our hearts are
swaying to it's beats.

210
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,619
Let me have a betel leaf.
The one from Benaras.

211
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,786
I'll have the betel nut
and let them have the lime.

212
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,054
Hell with them!

213
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,338
We die here working hard.
Whereas the rich enjoy life.

214
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:14,850
He gets all the goodies,
whereas we get nothing.

215
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,483
What does the world wish?
Only money.

216
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,753
All the relations are
merely based on money.

217
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,120
You need love, spend money.

218
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,463
You need a lover,
spend some money.

219
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,572
Whatever you do, but
please do think before.

220
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,738
Why do you
differentiate between yourselves?

221
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,878
Everything else is useless.
Only the powerful dominate here.

222
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,184
Goons are found in every
nook and corner of this city.

223
00:21:54,813 --> 00:22:01,731
Nothing works here. Bribe
them and your work is done.

224
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,328
Everyone has become corrupt.

225
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,731
The yes-man here have benefited.

226
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:13,400
You enjoy the delicacy and
ask us to have simple meals.

227
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,903
Enjoy life, Let everyone know.

228
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,911
Love has no value for them.
They just laze around.

229
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,675
Hell with them.

230
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,773
First they rob the people.

231
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,845
Commit sins and then
wash off their hands.

232
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,848
Don't get scared of them.

233
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,284
They should be beaten to pulp.

234
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,920
What does the world wish?
Only money.

235
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,258
All the relations are
merely based on money.

236
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,525
You need love, spend money.

237
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,864
You need a lover,
spend some money.

238
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:59,407
No rains, the well's are dried.
The taps are running dry.

239
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,275
He lies in the pool,
whereas we die of thirst.

240
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:07,448
Tears flow in our eyes,
the children are in tears.

241
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:11,016
The old are dying for water.
People only desire for water.

242
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,797
Oh water.. what a
tragic story you have.

243
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,358
There's so much of water here,
still our fields lay barren.

244
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:23,429
The woman are depressed,
there's no sign of water.

245
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:29,036
Let the rains shower and
fill our well's with water.

246
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,314
Their tears have dried up.
Whereas we die of shame.

247
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,309
We starve. Whereas the bugs
have their fill with our blood.

248
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,521
What difference does it make?
You enjoy yourself.

249
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,859
Hell with him!

250
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,495
What does the world wish?
Only money.

251
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,764
All the relations are
merely based on money.

252
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,068
You need love, spend money.

253
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,677
You need a lover,
spend some money.

254
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:32,007
Lankeshwar, here's the
money for the land deal.

255
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,809
When will you transfer
the lands in my name?

256
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,605
As soon as I possess them,
I'll hand them over to you.

257
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:45,644
With so much of land, what business
are you going to start here?

258
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,829
I'll open the world's
largest gambling den on this land

259
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,864
Only the millionaires
will come to this den

260
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,396
Liquor worth lakhs
will be sold here.

261
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,465
There will be
entertainment round the clock.

262
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,974
Deals worth millions will
be struck at every hour.

263
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,806
And I'll be a billionaire!

264
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:17,820
Good! I'll be a millionaire,
whereas you, a billionaire?!

265
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,919
I'm a selfish man!

266
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,430
If you get the land
transferred in my name..

267
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,437
...I'll give you half
partnership in my business.

268
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:41,975
That's a clever move! 50%
partnership in your business!

269
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,441
Why only this village?

270
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:48,109
All the villages
will be in your name.

271
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,882
Hey..
- Yes, sir.

272
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,454
Kill the buffalo and
throw it in the well..

273
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,960
..from which the
villagers draw water.

274
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:03,124
But that buffalo..
- Yes, it's my favorite one.

275
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,500
But I desire the land
owned by the villagers.

276
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:14,070
On finding the carcass, the
villagers won't touch that water.

277
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,046
They will come
begging to me for water.

278
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,472
I'll give them water.

279
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,975
But in exchange I'll
have their land in my name.

280
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,122
I got it.
- Get going. - Yes, sir.

281
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,823
You're responsible
for all this, Vijay?

282
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:37,491
We went there with a
request and not to fight.

283
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,935
You messed up everything.
- What did he do?

284
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,666
You all were with him.
- But we didn't pick up a fight.

285
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,508
Great! He was talking of
disgracing the women folks.

286
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,572
Would he listen to
everything quietly?

287
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,046
He's not a coward like you.
Vijay has got the guts.

288
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,180
Now Lankeshwar is our enemy.
- Was he a friend before?

289
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,185
He was eying this village.

290
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,622
He has polluted the water by
throwing carcass in this well.

291
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,597
Till now we survived only
on this water. But what now?

292
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:17,936
I knew, that fool is heartless.

293
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,532
Now the entire village
is having enmity with you.

294
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,275
All this would've not
happened had you not gone there..

295
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,176
..and now we've
landed in a new trouble.

296
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,242
You wanted to be our leader.
Now arrange for the water.

297
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,616
Now, we'll have to give
our lands to him for water.

298
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,126
Water in lieu of land!

299
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,557
If we transfer the
land in his name..

300
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,693
...he'll kick us out of this village.

301
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,237
Vijay, there is only one way out.

302
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,574
Either give him our
lands or die of thirst.

303
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,656
Mother, I'm thirsty.
Please give me water.

304
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,616
Yes dear, I'll get water.

305
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,723
Just a minute.

306
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,780
She was stealing
water from the well.

307
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:36,818
No, sir, I'm not a thief.
But a helpless mother.

308
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:43,091
Have mercy on me.
Just give me some water.

309
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:49,190
Not for me, but for my child.
Just a bucket of water.

310
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,094
Hey, get a bucket of water.
- Okay.

311
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:26,394
I'll give you water but
you've no land in exchange.

312
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,673
But you still have..

313
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,804
Help!

314
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:49,686
Lankeshwar!
- Brother, help me!

315
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,228
How dare you disgrace our women?!

316
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,925
You disgrace our women?!

317
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,427
What do you think of yourself?!

318
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:08,275
You think it's easy to strip her?

319
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:14,912
You will tear her clothes!
You will dishonor her?!

320
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,313
And I.. will I
watch all this quietly?

321
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:25,420
No.. I too will have the fun.

322
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,788
I too..

323
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,194
Brother..
- Don't call me brother..

324
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,805
Call me lover instead.

325
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,277
Beast! I won't spare you.

326
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:52,115
Remember, their curse
will ruin your happiness.

327
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,824
You cursed my brother?!

328
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,453
God, give us rain and shade.

329
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,778
No!

330
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,818
Mother..
- My dear..

331
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:34,125
What happened to you, mother?
- My dear.

332
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:40,133
Rajeshwar, fix them both!

333
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,830
Great! You entered my house,
that too alone!

334
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,333
A man is born alone and
when he dies, he's alone.

335
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,836
Then why fear loneliness?

336
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,578
What brought you here?
- I want to sell my land.

337
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,585
You had said, land in lieu of water.

338
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,858
I've come to arrange for
water for the villagers.

339
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,869
In exchange for your land,
I can provide one month..

340
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,878
..of water supply to the villagers.

341
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,146
Exactly 30 days.
- Not a good deal!

342
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,449
But still I accept it.

343
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,619
A need always has a price!

344
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:16,264
Right! Now, I'm the one in need.
So you will put up the price,

345
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:22,628
Then go on, sign it.
- You too will have to sign.

346
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,902
On this paper. It states
that for 30 days the villagers".

347
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,104
..can have water from your well.

348
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,108
No law nor any goon can stop them.

349
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:41,914
Great! You have come
here fully prepared.

350
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,955
You've fixed the problem.

351
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,521
In exchange for the land, I
can sign as many times you say.

352
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,681
Brother, what have you done?

353
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,157
You've given your well for
a month to the villagers?!

354
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:25,332
So what? I'll be the owner
of the land after a month.

355
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:34,204
Didn't you save the money
for your sister's marriage?

356
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,509
You will buy a tube well for
the villagers with this money!

357
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,710
What does marriage mean?
Getting settled in life.

358
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,983
Without water, many families
in this village will be ruined.

359
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:51,259
How can I make my sister happy
by ruining all these families?

360
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:56,221
I pray that God gives a
brother like you in every family.

361
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:02,400
When you are there, how
can this village be ruined?

362
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,271
Vijay, you are indeed an angel!

363
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:16,344
So he's become the saviour!
The saviour of the village!

364
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,450
We want to extricate the
village from your clutches.

365
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,046
That's why he's off to the
city to buy a tube well.

366
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,018
He will not head for the city..

367
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,087
..but to the cremation ground.

368
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:35,503
My men will fix him on the way.

369
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:42,339
Villagers, you abused him.
Thought him to be your enemy.

370
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,770
But he's our real friend.

371
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:51,686
Not only a friend, a human
but a Saviour of this village.

372
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,052
You know, he had saved money
for his sister's marriage..

373
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,493
..and now with that money he's
going to buy a tube well for us.

374
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,793
When he returns, every house
in the village will have water.

375
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,102
Then no one will have to
leave the village like Vandana.

376
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:15,803
What! Did Ms. Vandana leave?
- Yes.

377
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:22,312
The problem about water took
her away. God knows where she is.

378
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:31,089
Folks, I beg of you..

379
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,528
..please don't leave this village.

380
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:41,463
I'll get a tube well from the
city at the earliest. I promise.

381
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,098
Brother, come back soon.

382
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,270
Take care of yourself.

383
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,105
Son, take care.

384
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,180
Take care. We will miss you a lot.

385
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:04,852
Vijay, take care.

386
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:32,149
Folks, Vijay has not only
gone to buy a tube well..

387
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:37,158
..he has also arranged
water for all of us.

388
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:43,322
Look at this. Rajeshwar,
have a look.. sister Shanti.

389
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,168
He has sold off his
land to Thakur Lankeshwar.

390
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:52,163
In exchange Thakur
will provide water..

391
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,438
..to us for a month.

392
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:02,183
Bravo, my son! I'm proud of you!

393
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,221
Go on, son! Our good
wishes are with you.

394
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:17,189
Sir, fresh fruits!

395
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,927
Rupees two for a kilo!

396
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:31,945
Tea! Hot tea!

397
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:40,516
Hot tea!
- Brother, one tea! - Here you are.

398
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:40,576
Thank you! I would've
died had you not warned me.

399
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,514
You know them?

400
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,017
Who are these fools? Why
did they mess with me?

401
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,288
So you didn't get Vijay's corpse?

402
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,034
But I need a corpse today.

403
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:09,475
Discuss amongst
yourself and give me a corpse.

404
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,451
Look over here.. this is a gun!

405
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,750
It can save life and
it can also take life!

406
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:28,523
Whoever comes over and
takes it, will save his life.

407
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:36,562
Come.. show your powers, take
this gun and save your life.

408
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,598
Come on..

409
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,366
Fix them.

410
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,604
It's not loaded.

411
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,048
He's dead!

412
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,728
He was of no use. But
Vijay is still alive!

413
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:56,984
Listen.. once again,
thank you. Bye! - Bye!

414
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,824
Sir, give me a helping hand.

415
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,929
Did you see my bag?

416
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,601
I haven't seen a mirror since morning,
forget about your bag. Get lost!

417
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,444
Did you see my bag?
- No.

418
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,174
Sir, my bag was here.
- No.

419
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,919
Constable..
- Go in.

420
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,662
Sir.
- Over there.

421
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,927
The party was wonderful!
How did you feel?

422
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,765
Sir..
- I'm busy over the phone.

423
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:52,766
Can't you see? Sit there. Go on..
I am talking over phone.

424
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:59,511
The party was exotic! And the girl..

425
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,777
She was beautiful!
- Sir, in Mumbai Central..

426
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,146
I said, sit there.
- Listen to me first..

427
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,815
I'm busy talking. Sit there.

428
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:18,225
The whisky didn't suit me.
I'm on lime juice today!

429
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:24,497
What! Not at all. I'm not
used to the English ones.

430
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,539
I'm used to the local stuff.

431
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,814
Sir.. I lost my bag
at Mumbai Central.

432
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,618
It had 32,222 rupees in it.

433
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,747
Instead of filing my complaint,
you are busy over the phone.

434
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,519
It's your duty to
serve the citizens..

435
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,724
..and not to speak nonsense
over the phone. Do you get it?

436
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,797
One minute, hang on.
I'll file your complaint.

437
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,838
Constable..
- Yes, sir.

438
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:04,545
Arrest this fellow.
Two days in the lock-up..

439
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,741
..and he'll learn how to
speak with an Inspector.

440
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:12,918
Lock him up.
- Sir, listen..

441
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,551
He teaches me duty!

442
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,761
Hello, Not at all! The routine one..

443
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,052
Leave.

444
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,101
Money!

445
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,801
Run..

446
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,673
Wait! I'll not spare you.

447
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,680
Look at your condition. Let them go.

448
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,683
How can I? They have robbed me.

449
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,913
What! It means, your
condition is similar to mine.

450
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:31,086
What happened with you?
- What do I tell you?

451
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,699
I had got Rs.
32,222 from the village.

452
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,936
As soon as I reached here,
someone flicked my bag.

453
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,155
Sir, give me a helping hand.

454
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:16,736
Oh! That money was yours.
- Which money?

455
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,334
The one you got from the village.

456
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:25,746
My dear, this is Mumbai.
You've to be smart.

457
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,976
Thanks, you saved my life!

458
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,822
- What's your name? - 32,200..

459
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,492
Vijay.
- I'm Amar.

460
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,323
Where do you stay?
- Why rub salts on my wound?!

461
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,864
I don't have a dime in my pocket.

462
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:56,777
Friend, I've a room.
It's quite small.

463
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,214
If you wish, you can
stay there. We'll share it.

464
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,444
No! Why do you take the trouble?
- Trouble! Not at all.

465
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,914
After all you saved my life!

466
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,782
As soon as you came to the city,
your money got stolen.

467
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,893
Now I'll have to repay you.
The amount is quite big!

468
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,261
Why will you repay? You
didn't take the money.

469
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,197
Of course, I didn't take it.

470
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:27,134
But you saved my life,
so it's my duty.

471
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,311
We both are alone in this city.
So we are like brothers.

472
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:37,819
Great! This city not
only has thieves..

473
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:42,983
..but also noble people like you.
- Hell with it. Let's eat. Come.

474
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:01,105
Nothing happened to me. - Tell us,
who hit you? You are bleeding.

475
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,974
Tell me, who hit you?
- Nothing much, pal.

476
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:08,507
Khan!

477
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:15,855
What happened? Who hit you?
Tell me. - Nothing happened.

478
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,120
Ghanshyam! Pinto! Jahnvi! Yasmin!

479
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,389
Come here..

480
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,865
..someone has hit him. Tell me.
- Nothing..

481
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,272
Uncle John, I agree, a
savior is greater than the killer!

482
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:36,243
Hadn't he been there, it'd
have been my last day today.

483
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:40,975
Who has the guts to kill you?
Our blessings are with you.

484
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,111
Brother, you did us a
favour by saving his life.

485
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:49,555
He provides food to many.
- And money to so many families.

486
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,026
He helps everyone who is
in need in our locality.

487
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:58,055
He's like a son to everyone.
- Uncle, now he'll stay with me.

488
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:05,532
Wonderful. You mean.. from now on,
we will have two sons. Who is he?

489
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,208
He's Vijay. You
people can see my wounds..

490
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,046
..but he's wounded from within.
His story is quite sad.

491
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,931
How can anyone enjoy by
stealing a poor man's money?

492
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,959
I swear, if I get him,
I'll break his bones.

493
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:43,511
If I get my hands on that thief,
I'll take him to my par
our..

494
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,945
..and along with his nails,
I'll cut off his fingers too!

495
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:51,949
I'll shave off half his head,
blacken his face..

496
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,113
..and parade him through the city.

497
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,123
I swear, I'll slit his
neck like a piece of cloth.

498
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,558
I'll take him to the hotel
and tell the chef to have..

499
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,570
..him roasted in an oven.

500
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,671
If I get my hands on him..

501
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,977
...I'll put him in a coffin
and throw him in the sea.

502
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,987
Looking at your love,
your sympathy towards me..

503
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:32,048
...I remember my village.

504
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,326
People say, there's no
other relation than your kin.

505
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,633
Believe and love all. Or else,
all are strangers.

506
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,996
Till people like us live,
humanity will continue to exist.

507
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,466
It's my 19th birthday.

508
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,708
You had celebrated it last year!
This year too! Are we fools?

509
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:57,008
I'm stuck at 19. What
difference does age make?

510
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,111
Let's have a party.
- Congratulations!

511
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,185
Cheers!

512
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:18,494
Whatever happens here,
let it happen,

513
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,600
This is a happy moment.

514
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,475
Don't let it go,

515
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:36,114
Meet the loved ones.

516
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,118
Don't lament over what is lost.

517
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:46,249
Let it go.

518
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:57,297
Whatever happens here,
let it happen.

519
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,470
This is a happy moment.

520
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:09,215
Don't let it go.

521
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,666
Don't ever break a heart.

522
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,205
Didn't break it.

523
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,204
Don't ever leave a friend.

524
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,743
Didn't leave.

525
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,676
Don't ever break a heart.

526
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,308
Don't ever leave a friend.

527
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,217
God, I don't mind if
I don't get happiness.

528
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,881
But please don't give me sorrow.

529
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:27,418
Don't give me less
than what I need.

530
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:32,966
People wait for me there.
How can I go there?

531
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:38,404
They trust me,
how can I face them?

532
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:44,236
I'll have to get
back their happiness.

533
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:53,846
Whatever happens here,
let it happen.

534
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,983
This is a happy moment.

535
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:06,263
Don't let it go.

536
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,910
I have promised..

537
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,378
I have promised.

538
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,310
I have decided.

539
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,908
I have decided.

540
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,983
I have promised.

541
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,582
I have decided.

542
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,355
No one will understand me.

543
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,330
The promise is dearer
to me than my life.

544
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,923
Don't question me. I'm what I am.

545
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,765
Different from others.

546
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:21,332
Let me give
everyone a befitting reply.

547
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:31,045
Whatever happens here,
let it happen.

548
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:36,354
This is a happy moment.

549
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:43,596
Don't let it go.

550
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,398
Listen to a couplet.

551
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,735
Think of what you think.

552
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,411
Understanding what you think,
itself is what you think.

553
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,641
When one doesn't
understand what he is thinking..

554
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,412
..then he is a fool
Did you understand?

555
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,479
Listen to it once again.

556
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,148
Think of what you think.

557
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,415
Understanding what you think,
itself is what you think.

558
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,425
When one doesn't
understand what he is thinking..

559
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,430
..then he is a fool.
- Hey.

560
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:55,429
When you are not bathing
at least shut the tap.

561
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,436
The government supplies the water.
Whether I use it or waste it..

562
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,101
..why do you interfere?
- One minute.

563
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,672
The water is being wasted.

564
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,181
Let it be wasted. Why interfere?
Get going.

565
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,512
Why are you wasting water?

566
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:19,452
Let it get wasted. How
does it affect you? Get going.

567
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:25,591
Acting smart! Sit down..
- Yes.

568
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:29,026
Else I'll bury you.
- Vijay, what are you doing?

569
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:35,939
Fatso, if I see you again,
wasting the water..

570
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,545
...I'll skin you, is that clear?

571
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,745
Vijay, why get angry over such
a trivial matter like water?

572
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,480
It's not trivial. If you
want to know the depth..

573
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,887
..of the matter, come to my village.

574
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,824
I'll show you the
importance of every drop of water.

575
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,962
One needs water to survive, to live.

576
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,497
I had come to the city
to arrange for water.

577
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:07,236
Had I not been poor, I
wouldn't have seen this day.

578
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:13,504
What do you mean?
- Only if I could help you.

579
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:18,109
But I'm helpless. I
live on my daily earnings.

580
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:25,515
You have given me shelter.
Don't worry about my money.

581
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:31,763
I'll earn, work hard
and collect the money.

582
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:35,535
It's hard to find a job in the city.

583
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,672
When one desires, he even
seeks God. So why not a mere job?

584
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,805
Vijay-

585
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:19,571
Vijay, after all you
didn't land a job!

586
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:25,577
So what? He will surely get a job.

587
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:28,679
How will he work if
he's not in good health?

588
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,954
What's wrong with him?
- He doesn't have his breakfast.

589
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:36,861
Nor does he have his dinner.
- Son, it's bad to starve.

590
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,258
I've got food for you.
And also a dessert.

591
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:53,246
Brother.. only poor
people dwell here.

592
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:57,617
We are poor in terms of money,
but rich at heart.

593
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:03,046
Vijay, where have you been?
You're not to be seen.

594
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:08,152
Great! It's you who are not to
be seen. Where had you been?

595
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:15,126
You know it. My work demands
me to be in and out for days.

596
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,303
You too are starving.
Come, let's eat.

597
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,001
Come on.. hurry up.

598
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:31,646
The money which he
has lost is too much.

599
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:35,154
We can't even think of
collecting that amount. Impossible.

600
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,663
Brother Rajeshwar, you?!

601
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:51,899
Yes.. Radha, any news of your
brother? Did he write to you?

602
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:56,668
It's only a few clays since he left.
How will I get his letter?

603
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:03,681
True. Only a few days since
he left but I feel it's ages!

604
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,214
I'm worried about him.

605
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:11,014
Let me have his address if you have.

606
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,388
I'll write to him.

607
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:18,030
Not only you, we all are
going through the same thing.

608
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,931
Had I known his address, I
would've written to him.

609
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,697
We'll know of him only
when he writes to us.

610
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:31,234
Yes.. as soon as you get
his letter, inform me first.

611
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,210
It will ease my tension.

612
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,344
Okay, I shall leave now.
- Goodbye.

613
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,746
He loves Vijay a lot.

614
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,318
I have no idea of
Vijay's whereabouts.

615
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:49,722
But there's news.
- What's that?

616
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,726
Vijay's sister has grown up..

617
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,965
"I've gone crazy over her.

618
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,734
Rajeshwar, control yourself.

619
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,746
Keep an eye on the land.

620
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:15,483
Once we have the land, the
new bud which has blossomed..

621
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,488
I can have her.
- Yes, you can.

622
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:34,199
Suzy, you've made
me happy. Go enjoy.

623
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,949
Hello.
- Lankeshwar.

624
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,447
Yes. What's it?

625
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:55,053
You did strike a deal with me
for the land. What about money?

626
01:05:55,451 --> 01:06:00,799
I'm a millionaire's son. I
can take as much money".

627
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,132
...I need from my father's safe.

628
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:08,307
Then open his safe
and send me my money.

629
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,474
Don't worry. You will
get your installment. Okay?

630
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:23,515
Niranjan..

631
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:29,988
Yes, dad?
- Where were you last night?

632
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:36,493
At our bungalow. It
was Vicky's birthday..

633
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,838
You threw a party. You
guzzled liquor and you slept there.

634
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,568
Right?

635
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:48,848
The path which you
tread upon misleads you.

636
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,515
You are a millionaire, but
why spend money unnecessarily?

637
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,254
As far as your
friends are concerned..

638
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:06,229
...fireflies are always
found where there is light.

639
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,994
Once the light is out,
the fireflies disappear.

640
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:18,301
Once your wealth is over,
these friends will leave you.

641
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,041
No one will even show
sympathy towards you.

642
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:26,013
Alright. Henceforth I will
not contact my friends. Ok?

643
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:32,957
Daddy, I need some money.
- Again?

644
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:39,225
I gave you 50,000 last week. -
Times are hard now, do you know that?

645
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,894
It's difficult to manage
a week with only 50,000.

646
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:48,639
The judge's son spends 20,000 daily.

647
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:53,037
The minister's son spends
50,000 daily without hesitation.

648
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,241
I don't want to know what others do.

649
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:59,445
But what you're doing is wrong.

650
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:09,153
Work hard to earn money,
then you'll know it's value.

651
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:14,361
Sometimes I feel you
love wealth more than me.

652
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:19,463
You are wrong. The parents'
only asset are their children.

653
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,936
But my son treads on the
path which will ruin him.

654
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,945
Control yourself..

655
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:35,122
..else you will
regret very badly one clay.

656
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,253
It's not too late. Control yourself.

657
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,394
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

658
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:48,527
It's pay day. Here's 10 lakhs
- Oh, yes.

659
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:53,333
Count it.
- No need. I trust you.

660
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,166
Let's go.

661
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,173
Come on, out!

662
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,000
Hand over the bag, else
you will lose your man.

663
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,680
Your bag.

664
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:54,454
Can I know your name, brave man?
- I'm Vijay.

665
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,260
You know, this bag had 10 lakhs.

666
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:05,099
Whatever the amount, you own it.
Only you have the right over it.

667
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,298
It's my principle.

668
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:12,102
I was looking out for
an honest man like you.

669
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,106
Resign from your present job.

670
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:22,614
I'll pay you double the salary.
You will work for me.

671
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:27,185
Actually I was
looking out for a job.

672
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,589
Here's my card. Come
over at 10 tomorrow.

673
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,230
Should I assume that
I have got the job?

674
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,137
You couldn't even do
such a small thing.

675
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:55,852
You just had to snatch a bag.
- Great, my son!

676
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:02,160
I'm ashamed to call you my son.

677
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:08,633
The thieves too spare
their house but you!

678
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:14,641
You robbed your own house.
You want to rob your father?

679
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:18,174
When a father doesn't care
for his son, then the son..

680
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,270
..is helpless to take such a step.

681
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:26,378
Shut up! I don't have wealth
to squander over your friends.

682
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:33,183
What didn't I give you?
A car, luxurious house..

683
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:37,719
"Servants and an identity
of being a millionaire's son.

684
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:43,862
And you.. instead of apologizing..

685
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,202
..you dare argue with me!

686
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:51,437
Gone are the times when a
son used to fear his father.

687
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:55,746
This is the modern generation.
A man is free to live his life.

688
01:12:56,205 --> 01:13:02,554
You want to live like you wish?!
Alright, go ahead.

689
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:10,221
Work hard and earn money..
- I don't need to work.

690
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,368
I have a share in your wealth.
A right over your money!

691
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,642
Legally I also have the
right over your wealth.

692
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,245
A son who forgets humanity,
his blood relations and..

693
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:30,249
...assaults his father
for the sake of 10 lakhs..

694
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:36,256
..has no right over his
father's wealth. Never!

695
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:44,258
Before I take a step
which can ruin your life..

696
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,499
"Control yourself.

697
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,263
This is my last warning.

698
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,866
Henceforth if you
repeat such a mistake..

699
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,369
...I'll disown you.

700
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,908
It's not too late, reform yourself.

701
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,284
Go, I'll tell you later. Oh God!

702
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:22,298
Uncle, I got the job.
- Really?! - Yes.

703
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:27,302
God is great! Did you hear?
He has got a job.

704
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:41,454
Hey baby! What are you doing?

705
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:47,324
Don't jump! What are you doing?
- Stay back. - Don't step forward.

706
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,953
Don't step forward, please!

707
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:54,399
Baby, I beg of you, stay back.
- Bet, she'll jump now. - Get lost!

708
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:56,894
Please, move back!

709
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,470
Very good, dear.

710
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:12,407
You saved my life, now
why do you want to die?

711
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:15,512
I don't want to live. Let
me die. Why did you save me?

712
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:18,456
Committing suicide is cowardice

713
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,358
Alright. I'm a coward.
I don't want to live.

714
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:24,590
Let me go.
- Why do you want to die?

715
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,826
You want to know? Then listen.

716
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:32,738
What nonsense is this?
- It's true. Believe me.

717
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,908
Our parents had us
engaged when we were children

718
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,579
What? Engagement, with you?!
Have you seen yourself?

719
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:49,387
Look at yourself. You
are a village bumpkin.

720
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:54,393
You aren't fit to be a servant
and you talk of being my wife!

721
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:59,395
Had I been engaged to you, I
would've never accepted you.

722
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,866
Get out!

723
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:08,902
Sir, don't do this.
- Get lost. Or I'll throw you out.

724
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:15,504
Please don't do this.
Where will I go?

725
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:21,878
I had hopes on you. I
have no one besides you.

726
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:28,521
Great! You made up a nice
story to possess my wealth.

727
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:34,130
It's not a story. You
can ask your father.

728
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:38,433
I'm Kedarnath's daughter
from the village Sonpur.

729
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:47,841
I see! So you are Mr.
Kedarnath's daughter Geeta.

730
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,886
Yes. But he's no more.

731
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,013
Even my mother is dead.

732
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,451
I have no one besides you now.

733
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:07,798
It was my father's last wish
that I get married to you.

734
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:12,468
I don't know any Kedarnath,
nor his daughter.

735
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,736
Poverty stricken worms! God
knows from where they come.

736
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,634
Get lost!
- Sir, please don't do this to me.

737
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,873
I know how to deal
with girls like you.

738
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:24,679
I've no one besides you.
- God is there for you.

739
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,686
Go seek his help. Get lost

740
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,480
Leave me. Go and die.
Throw her away.

741
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:41,901
Niranjan is a devil!
You want to die for him?

742
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,730
Instead you should
avenge for your insult.

743
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:48,172
Teach him a lesson!
- He deserves a good trashing.

744
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,801
She's a simpleton, he's a crook.

745
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:54,740
There's so much of
difference between them.

746
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,574
How can it happen?

747
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,749
How can this girl
face that devil alone?

748
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:06,149
Just like he refused
to recognise her..

749
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,920
..we should do something that
he too doesn't recognise her.

750
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,630
He should crave for her.

751
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:18,767
She should teach him a lesson
which he'll remember all his life.

752
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:24,007
It is said that only a
weapon kills the mighty..

753
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,535
..and beauty kills the opulent.

754
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:31,649
But how is it possible?
- Let me make it clear. Come.

755
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:19,062
Let there be applaud

756
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:25,128
Let there be applause.

757
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:31,605
Hey girl, change your style.

758
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:37,248
Then get ready to fight.
Put everyone in a fix.

759
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:44,615
Change your looks, style.
Let there be a miracle.

760
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:50,855
Let there be applause.

761
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,962
Let there be applause.

762
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:49,054
Apply powder, lipstick,
change your hairstyle.

763
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:54,854
Wear high heels,
and walk with a style.

764
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:06,031
Apply powder, lipstick,
change your hairstyle.

765
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:11,702
Wear high heels,
and walk with a style.

766
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:18,877
Put on some airs
and play hard to get.

767
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:25,180
Let there be applause.

768
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:32,324
Let there be applause.

769
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,772
The world is crazy.
People do as they wish.

770
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,506
Even the good ones
fall into trouble.

771
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,249
Only looks are. important, a
human's heart has no value.

772
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,343
Just kick off such people.

773
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,792
The world is crazy.
People do as they wish.

774
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,796
Even the good ones
fall into trouble.

775
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,196
Only looks are important, a
human's heart has no value.

776
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,861
So, they break your heart.

777
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:50,540
Show him your cruelty,
teach him a lesson.

778
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:55,942
Let there be applause.

779
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:02,278
Let there be applause.

780
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:08,352
Hey girl, change your style.

781
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:14,028
Then get ready to fight.
Put everyone in a fix.

782
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:21,468
Change your looks, style,
let there be a miracle.

783
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:27,845
Let there be applause.

784
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:34,543
Let there be applause.

785
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,865
Even a single grey hair..

786
01:23:56,931 --> 01:24:01,209
..is visible to my eyes.

787
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:09,481
But Vijay's out of our vision.
How do we find him?

788
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:16,625
We have lost touch of Vijay.

789
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,593
Now he is in the city.

790
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:23,134
What if we ask Niranjan
to search for him there?

791
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,567
Not at all.

792
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:33,910
If Niranjan is aware
of the happenings here..

793
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:38,576
..then the entire
deal will be ruined.

794
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,919
We'll fall in grave trouble.
- What do we do?

795
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:46,925
Right now, dye your hair.

796
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:55,365
Later we'll plan a move
which will ruin the villagers.

797
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,778
Thief! Thief!

798
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,841
Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!

799
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,378
Thief! Thief! Thief!

800
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,959
You creep! How dare
you steal a girl's purse?

801
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:36,466
Excuse me.

802
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:43,373
I've fallen in love with you.

803
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:48,184
I've lost my heart.

804
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,324
I've fallen in love with you.

805
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,556
Your purse.
- Thank you.

806
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,026
Excuse me.

807
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,568
If you don't mind,
should I say something?

808
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:10,903
Yes. - God has created
you with utmost care.

809
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,912
God has gifted you with such vigor!

810
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:17,844
I would've lost my credit card,
passport had you not been there.

811
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,443
Thanks Mr..
- Niranjan.

812
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,452
What's your name?
- She's Meghna.

813
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,458
Princess of Meghalaya.
- ls it?

814
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,259
Princess. Princess of Meghalaya.

815
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,227
I'm pleased to meet you.

816
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,059
Thank you very much.

817
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,597
Excuse me, if you don't mind..

01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:40,599

Tomorrow? - You've a dinner appointment
with Shah Rukh Khan. - Yes.

820
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,535
He has taken the
appointment six months ago.

821
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,139
What about day after tomorrow?

822
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,616

No chance. Impossible.

01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:56,947
To the governor's house.
- But madam.

841
01:27:57,005 --> 01:28:00,350
..you've to meet the
ambassador of Japan.

842
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:02,445
I forgot. Take me there.
- Okay.

843
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:16,557
I've fallen in love.

844
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:22,700
God you are indeed great!
What a girl!

845
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:34,046
What happened son?
- We've hit the bull's eye.

846
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:37,055
Niranjan is floored in
the first round itself.

847
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:44,992
He just got crazy over her beauty!

848
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,065
I didn't deserve all this.
I was going to die.

849
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,666
But you people gave me
the courage to live.

850
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,370
I'll never forget your favour.

851
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,307
Vijay has done me a great favour.

852
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,072
Had Vijay not saved my life, I
wouldn't have done all this.

853
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:11,757
He has given me a new life.
He gave me the courage.

854
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:16,423
You give him all the credit.
What about my efforts?

855
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,095
At least you could
praise me falsely.

856
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:26,104
Amar, I've thanked everybody,
even you are included.

857
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,767
True. But you have
thanked him specially.

858
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,035
Save a girl from
committing suicide..

859
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,105
..you too will be
thanked in a special way.

860
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:56,796
I've fallen in love.

861
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,464
I've lost my heart in your love.

862
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,773
You look terrific!

863
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,806
Why do you always
remember God when you see me?

864
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:12,608
Your beauty strikes
me like a thunderbolt!

865
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:17,144
Meghna, You've wounded my heart.

866
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:21,752
I can't stay without you.

867
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,496
Meghna, my butterfly.

868
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:29,501
Madam, shall I have the food
served? - No. I'm not hungry

869
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:35,704
Meghna, I feel like I
have seen you somewhere

870
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:41,338
I just can't recall.
Might be in my dreams

871
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:46,480
Meghna.. I'll fulfill your desires.

872
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,122
Just accept my love.

873
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:55,525
I can't stay without you, Meghna.

874
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,492
What are you up to?

875
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,392
Niranjan, I can't
promise you right now.

876
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:07,469
My father has given me the
right to choose my partner.

877
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:10,199
But I don't want to marry in haste.

878
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,168
What if I land up
having a wrong partner?

879
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,817
Vijay-

880
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:34,224
Look at your state. Don't
strain yourself so much.

881
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:39,797
I don't have the time
and the amount is too much.

882
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:46,176
I'll have to work hard,
toil day and night for it.

883
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:57,746
I don't want any
guests on my birthday party.

884
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:01,385
Tell them I'm sick. I'm
off to the doctor. Okay.

885
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:06,924
Darling.. darling.

886
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:11,393
Just as you said, I
canceled everything.

887
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,262
Only we two will be there.

888
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:19,937
Niranjan, why this haste?
It's your birthday.

889
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:26,582
I'll give you a gift. Your
life's most precious gift. - What?

890
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:33,290
What! You asked him
not to invite anyone?!

891
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:39,355
That means you and Niranjan.
This is not right.

892
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,559
Why? What happened?

893
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:43,961
She has to do
something to avenge her insult.

894
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:47,967
Right.
- You people are aware.

895
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,703
It's dangerous for her
to meet him all alone

896
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,246
He's right.
- One has to face danger..

897
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,407
..to defeat the enemy.
- He's right.

898
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:59,974
You said only a weapon
can kill the mighty..

899
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,243
..and beauty can
kill the opulent. Right?

900
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:06,850
I did. But there are other
ways too, what say? - Yes!

901
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,918
It's her style. What
difference does it make?

902
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:13,864
Make clever moves
and defeat the enemy.

903
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,666
Right?
- Yes

904
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:17,999
I have an idea.

905
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,530
Come. Come.

906
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:39,519
I've fallen in love with you.

907
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:44,023
I've lost my heart to you.

908
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:52,503
I've fallen in love with you.

909
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,038
I've lost my heart to you.

910
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:01,438
Did you ever fall in
love with anyone else?

911
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:06,815
ls this your first love?

912
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:11,713
You are mine, I'm yours

913
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:15,989
You are mine, I'm yours.

914
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:44,053
I don't trust the love
which happens before marriage.

915
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:52,757
If you accept this
then you can go ahead.

916
01:34:56,957 --> 01:35:05,672
I don't trust the love
which happens before marriage.

917
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:14,114
If you accept this
then you can go ahead.

918
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:18,788
I accept. Tell me, when
will you be my bride?

919
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:23,386
At least my dream has come true.

920
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:28,666
You are mine, I'm yours.

921
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:33,404
You are mine, I'm yours.

922
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:37,608
I've fallen in love with you.

923
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:42,472
It's only you whom I love.

924
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:55,154
Madam!
- Oh no! What's it?

925
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,964
You've to leave for
England right away.

926
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:04,430
But why?
- The Queen of England..

927
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:08,167
..wants to shop with you.
- There's no flight now.

928
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,941
Madam owns a chartered plane.

929
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,769
Meghna.. - I am sorry,
Niranjan. I'll have to leave.

930
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:19,179
You can enjoy the
candlelight dinner alone, okay? Bye.

931
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:20,977
Bye. Miss you!

932
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,154
She has escaped again!

933
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:30,053
Enough of your revenge.
Henceforth you won't meet him.

934
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:35,123
But why? Let her go ahead.
- You don't understand.

935
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:39,001
Niranjan is a crook.
- So what?

936
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,540
She will take care of herself.
Why do you worry?

937
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:46,034
Who will worry about her if not us?

938
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,139
I see. Everyone is
worried about her.

939
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,945
But you seem to be more worried
- You don't seem to understand.

940
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:59,819
I do. I've understood it well.
- What did you understand?

941
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,486
When you saved her life,
it was mere humanity..

942
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:06,828
..then there were emotions.
And you started liking her.

943
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:10,694
But this is something different.
Now the matter..

944
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:16,842
Nothing of that sort.
- I know the ways of the city.

945
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:22,580
I know who eyes which girl.

946
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:28,510
You are my friend. Won't I
know what's in your heart?

947
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:34,684
Geeta, he's a fool. Don't trust him.

948
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:41,597
What! Am I lying?
- He's a liar. Don't trust him.

949
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:46,934
It's true. He's a fool.
He's crazy. He loves you.

950
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:52,876
He can't stay without you. He dreams
of you. He loves you very much.

951
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:58,616
Did you believe what Amar said?
- No.

952
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:02,277
Why not? He was right.
- Yes.

953
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:10,288
What? Marriage! You mean marriage?
- Yes, darling.

954
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,290
Yes, darling. Honest, darling.

955
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,834
Let's hurry up and
get married in a temple

956
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:22,307
Darling. We'll get married later.
But there's a problem.

957
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:26,977
What?
- My family members.

958
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:32,241
They want to meet you.
- Really?

959
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:39,316
Alright. I'll meet them.
Where's your palace?

960
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:59,940
I don't understand. Why did
she call me in this rotten place?

961
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,347
You?
- Yes, it's me.

962
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,354
Geeta, who had
pleaded at your doorstep.

963
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:22,834
I begged for mercy.
But you kicked me out.

964
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:25,261
Did you remember?

965
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:34,640
Forget what had happened? I
love you, Geeta. I love you.

966
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:35,874
I hate you!

967
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:42,381
I had never loved you.
It was a mere relation..

968
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,389
..which was imposed
on me by my parents.

969
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,388
I had come here to
fulfill the relationship.

970
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:54,655
Today I will teach you a lesson..

971
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:59,671
so that you will never
behave with a woman..

972
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:02,674
..the way you behaved with me.

973
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:17,851
Hey mister, I am warning you people.

974
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,957
Hit him! Hit him harder!

975
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:27,230
Hit him! Hit him!

976
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:33,431
Hit him harder! Yes, harder!

977
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:50,050
Our friendship should
not sever due to a girl.

978
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:55,059
Yes.
- Tell me, do you like that girl?

979
01:40:55,115 --> 01:40:57,721
Which girl?
- Geeta.

980
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:02,096
Not at all. I don't love her.

981
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:05,735
I was in a quandary.

982
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:13,410
If you love Geeta tell me,
I'll not venture forth.

983
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:17,249
I've told you.
- Are you serious?

984
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,813
If you indeed love her, let me know.

985
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,087
I won't be able to tell
anything in my senses.

986
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:28,186
I think I better drink
before I speak anything.

987
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:30,888
What do you say? Should I?

988
01:41:30,951 --> 01:41:33,830
Why do you ask me?
- Why do you get angry?

989
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:37,826
As a friend, I seek your advice.
Should I tell her?

990
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,935
Go on.
- Thank you.

991
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,170
You are indeed a
friend and I'm a true lover.

992
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:47,506
We are travelers of love.
Don't tell us anything.

993
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:54,848
Sit.
- I'm already sitting.

994
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:56,251
Sit down!

995
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,251
One whiskey!

996
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:35,821
Amar.
- Geeta, I love you.

997
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:38,523
Really?
- I can't stay without you.

998
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,560
I too can't.
- I love you.

999
01:42:40,888 --> 01:42:43,892
Amar.. Oh, Amar.

1000
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:47,964
Amar, I..

1001
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:55,504
What happened? You
don't love her, eh?

1002
01:42:56,336 --> 01:43:01,217
Geeta, didn't I tell you?
He can't stay without you.

1003
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:05,584
He's always dreaming about you.
- What rubbish!

1004
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:07,853
What happened? - Think
of what you think.

1005
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:10,862
Try to understand what you think..

1006
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:17,460
...If you still don't understand.
Then, you are a fool.

1007
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:21,204
Let's go. Leave them alone.
Come on all of you.

1008
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:33,312
He doesn't even know how to love!

1009
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:22,662
I'll get it for you with love.

1010
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:35,607
I'll get the necklace for you.

1011
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:45,946
I'm your lover, you are my love.

1012
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:54,626
You're my lover, I'm your love.

1013
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:59,971
O beloved, I'll lovingly..

1014
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:04,442
..embrace you.

1015
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:51,750
If you wish, I'll get
the stars from the sky.

1016
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:56,658
I'll even get the moon
and adorn your beauty.

1017
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:05,102
I'll not fall for your words.

1018
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,364
I'll embrace you only when..

1019
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:18,679
My dear beloved,
gets me a necklace.

1020
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:28,718
I'm your lover, you are my love.

1021
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:33,063
O beloved, I'll lovingly..

1022
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:38,798
..embrace you.

1023
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:23,773
You are the one whom I
love and you love me too.

1024
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:28,711
This exchange of hearts
has put us in trouble.

1025
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:34,753
I spend sleepless nights.
My heart palpitates.

1026
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:39,358
I keep changing sides
and sigh the entire night.

1027
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:43,697
I'll get it for you with love.

1028
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:48,263
I'll get the necklace for you.

1029
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:58,440
I'm your lover, you are my love.

1030
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,544
I'll get it for you with love.

1031
01:48:01,608 --> 01:48:05,146
O beloved, I'll lovingly..

1032
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:08,523
..embrace you.

1033
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:24,637
Why worry? Vijay
will surely succeed.

1034
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:27,234
Greetings, chief.
- Greetings, brother.

1035
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,180
Radha, where's your brother?
Our saviour, wasn't he?

1036
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:34,481
He said, don't leave
this village. Should we die?

1037
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:40,589
Days have passed by.
He gave us false hopes.

1038
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:43,693
Only a few days for
the month to get over.

1039
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,525
What after that? How
will we get the water?

1040
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:48,191
Shameless people! He
sold off his land..

1041
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:52,362
..and arranged water for you.
And you abuse him instead.

1042
01:48:52,425 --> 01:48:55,702
She's right. We ought to be ashamed.

1043
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:03,277
Will anyone amongst us give
his savings for a tube well?

1044
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:08,948
ls he only responsible for
getting water for you people?

1045
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:13,224
Go on, speak.
- We wait here for him..

1046
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:17,353
..and God forbid he
meets with some accident.

1047
01:49:17,417 --> 01:49:20,557
No! Please don't say such things!

1048
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:22,961
For God's sake,
don't think like this.

1049
01:49:23,823 --> 01:49:27,862
No harm will come to my brother.

1050
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:35,803
You all watch. He'll
surely come. He will come.

1051
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:01,864
Look over there.

1052
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:05,468
Where will we search for
brother in this huge city?

1053
01:50:05,532 --> 01:50:08,638
Keep faith in God. We
will surely find him.

1054
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:10,010
Don't worry.

1055
01:50:14,808 --> 01:50:15,878
Father!

1056
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:28,623
Please help me.

1057
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:17,939
Vijay, are you
writing to your sister?

1058
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:21,383
Yes. Today I remember her a lot.

1059
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:25,817
True. You remember her.
You write to her..

1060
01:51:25,879 --> 01:51:27,688
But you forget to write the address.

1061
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:34,093
Who will write the address?
- How did you get this letter?

1062
01:51:35,555 --> 01:51:37,557
Not only this. Look over here..

1063
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:41,962
Sir, come in. He's here.

1064
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:45,768
Go and meet them.

1065
01:51:49,769 --> 01:51:50,839
Brother..

1066
01:51:56,843 --> 01:51:58,982
How did you come here?

1067
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:03,721
We wouldn't have reached here.
It's only due to him.

1068
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:09,060
He has done us a favor.
As soon as we got down..

1069
01:52:14,461 --> 01:52:15,872
Father!

1070
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:24,139
Friend, you've done
a great favor to me!

1071
01:52:25,472 --> 01:52:29,477
But this favor I can never repay.

1072
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:35,489
My sister is
everything for me. My life!

1073
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:38,659
I would have died had
anything happened to her.

1074
01:52:39,018 --> 01:52:41,897
Vijay, the villagers are in trouble.

1075
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:46,928
Lankeshwar has
stopped the water supply.

1076
01:52:46,993 --> 01:52:53,171
What? They hope that you will get
the tube well and solve this problem.

1077
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:57,507
But why did you take so long?
- How could he return?

1078
01:52:58,037 --> 01:53:03,453
Someone stole his money.
- True. Some selfish person..

1079
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:09,688
..for his own merriment,
has put us in trouble.

1080
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:18,161
If we don't take the tube well,
everyone will die of thirst.

1081
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:21,866
Everyone will sell off
their lands to Lankeshwar.

1082
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,070
They will become homeless.

1083
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:13,983
What! You want me to
have that thief released?

1084
01:55:14,641 --> 01:55:16,643
It's impossible.
- At least listen to me.

1085
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:21,956
I'm responsible for everything.
- What!

1086
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:25,929
Yes. I'm a resident
of village Gangavati.

1087
01:55:27,053 --> 01:55:30,330
There's scanty rainfall there.

1088
01:55:34,193 --> 01:55:37,606
To solve the water problem,
I took all my savings..

1089
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:40,338
..and came to the
city to buy a tube well.

1090
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:45,115
As soon as I reached here,
someone stole my money.

1091
01:55:46,205 --> 01:55:49,675
I worked hard in order
to collect the money.

1092
01:55:50,176 --> 01:55:51,348
But I couldn't.

1093
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:55,616
Sir, if I don't reach there
with the tube well in 10 days..

1094
01:55:55,682 --> 01:55:59,789
..then the entire
village will be ruined.

1095
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:04,624
When my friend heard this,
in order to save the village".

1096
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:09,140
..from ruination, he
tried to steal in your house.

1097
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:15,169
I know he was wrong. But
he was doing a good deed.

1098
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:21,712
Please have my friend released.
I beg of you.

1099
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:30,220
Brother, I've hit a
jackpot worth 10 lakhs.

1100
01:56:30,283 --> 01:56:33,264
ls it? Congratulations!

1101
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:39,895
This is all clue to the
amulet which you wear.

1102
01:56:39,959 --> 01:56:45,932
This locket?
- My father's memento.

1103
01:56:46,265 --> 01:56:49,041
What's your father's name?
- Shankar Narayan.

1104
01:56:57,243 --> 01:57:02,818
Go clear; your friend will be
released. I'll take back the case.

1105
01:57:03,216 --> 01:57:04,422
Thank you, sir.

1106
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:32,723
I know, you tried to steal
just to relieve my tension.

1107
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:37,922
Didn't you think,
you would get defamed?

1108
01:57:37,984 --> 01:57:40,328
People will call you
a thief. This world..

1109
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:45,028
Enough! I'm already
ashamed of myself.

1110
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:46,862
Please don't make me feel guilty.

1111
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:49,472
What are you saying?

1112
01:57:49,929 --> 01:57:52,808
I'm a sinner.

1113
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:57,241
A criminal.
- What?

1114
01:57:57,303 --> 01:58:04,812
Yes. I'm a criminal. I'm
hiding a secret within me.

1115
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:10,352
You know who that selfish,
merciless thief is? It's me.

1116
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:18,366
I had stolen your bag.
- What?! You stole.

1117
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:23,498
Yes, I stole your bag.
Stealing is my profession.

1118
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,903
This is how I earn.

1119
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:32,509
You cheat! Fraud!
- Vijay, leave him.

1120
01:58:32,839 --> 01:58:39,518
You let my villagers die of
thirst for your merriment!

1121
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:43,390
It's due to you that
everyone is dying thirsty.

1122
01:58:43,516 --> 01:58:45,518
Vijay, let go off him!

1123
01:58:45,918 --> 01:58:46,988
You are the root cause.

1124
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,823
Vijay, forgive him.

1125
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:51,195
vij§ly-
. Vnjay-

1126
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:53,531
Vijay, let go off him!

1127
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:59,137
I'll teach you a lesson
which you will remember forever.

1128
01:58:59,265 --> 01:59:00,869
vij§ly-
. Vnjay-

1129
01:59:02,268 --> 01:59:04,544
Leave him.
- Move aside Radha.

1130
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:09,549
Let him go.
- You know what he has done?

1131
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:10,879
I'll not spare him.

1132
01:59:10,943 --> 01:59:15,414
Forgive him. - Get lost! - Forgive
him dear. - Who am I to forgive him..

1133
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:17,552
Even God won't forgive him.

1134
01:59:17,884 --> 01:59:19,830
You can at least forgive a friend.

1135
01:59:19,952 --> 01:59:22,091
I don't care for such friendship!

1136
01:59:22,555 --> 01:59:26,560
I've no relation with him.
Now I won't stay here.

1137
01:59:27,894 --> 01:59:30,101
Viiav, Wait!

1138
01:59:30,296 --> 01:59:32,572
Vijay..
- Where are you going?

1139
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:34,105
Vijay-

1140
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:37,107
Don't punish me in this way.
Please forgive me.

1141
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:38,506
Move aside.

1142
01:59:39,438 --> 01:59:42,578
Only a friend can guide
a friend who is misled.

1143
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:47,120
A person doesn't become a
criminal out of his will.

1144
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:49,992
His helplessness turns
him into a criminal.

1145
01:59:50,316 --> 01:59:55,129
Vijay, what you heard was
the past. Just forget it.

1146
01:59:55,454 --> 01:59:59,994
Forgive him.
- You have changed his life!

1147
02:00:00,927 --> 02:00:02,133
Don't leave him.

1148
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:06,867
When parents can't
reform their child..

1149
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:08,606
..it's the friend
who can reform him.

1150
02:00:10,136 --> 02:00:12,616
Brother, please forgive him.

1151
02:00:14,473 --> 02:00:17,886
Vijay, I promise..

1152
02:00:17,944 --> 02:00:22,484
...I'll do as you say.

1153
02:00:23,883 --> 02:00:25,294
Yes, I promise.

1154
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:32,627
Vijay-

1155
02:00:42,168 --> 02:00:44,648
I've stolen one more thing.

1156
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:49,652
That too from your house.
- What?

1157
02:00:50,643 --> 02:00:57,527
Radha and I..
- Speak up!

1158
02:00:57,984 --> 02:01:00,658
l..
-What?!

1159
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:07,129
I mean, I would like to
be your brother-in-law.

1160
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:10,664
Nab him!
- Move aside! Vijay!

1161
02:01:10,997 --> 02:01:12,977
Vijay!
- Hey, wait there.

1162
02:01:13,132 --> 02:01:14,668
on, vijay!

1163
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:19,677
Hey, don't do that.

1164
02:01:20,273 --> 02:01:24,221
Listen to me.
Uncle, what did you say?

1165
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:29,357
Tell him.
- Think of what you think.

1166
02:01:29,548 --> 02:01:34,497
Understand of what you think.
If you still don't understand.

1167
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:39,569
Then you are a fool.
- I got it.

1168
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:44,705
Did you understand?
- Of course.

1169
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:27,014
Walking along hand
in hand with you..

1170
02:02:27,073 --> 02:02:29,747
I really feel good.

1171
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:33,049
I really feel good.

1172
02:02:37,216 --> 02:02:43,292
Walking along hand
in hand with you..

1173
02:02:43,756 --> 02:02:46,293
I really feel good.

1174
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:56,778
This world is full of cheats.
Only you I feel is true.

1175
02:02:57,503 --> 02:03:00,245
Only you I feel is true.

1176
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:30,814
My heart wishes to see
you and love you forever.

1177
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:37,812
It's my promise, your
wish will be fulfilled.

1178
02:03:44,683 --> 02:03:51,293
My heart wishes to see
you and love you forever.

1179
02:03:51,557 --> 02:03:58,497
It's my promise; your
wish will be fulfilled.

1180
02:03:58,631 --> 02:04:04,843
Walking along hand
in hand with you..

1181
02:04:05,371 --> 02:04:07,851
I really feel good.

1182
02:04:11,777 --> 02:04:18,387
This world is full of cheats.
Only you I feel is true.

1183
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:21,457
Only you I feel is true.

1184
02:05:06,298 --> 02:05:12,908
Wherever you go, I'll
always walk with you.

1185
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:20,214
I feel like taking
you in my arms forever.

1186
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:32,933
Wherever you go, I'll
always walk with you.

1187
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:40,470
I feel like taking
you in my arms forever.

1188
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:46,742
Walking along hand
in hand with you..

1189
02:05:47,273 --> 02:05:49,753
I really feel good.

1190
02:05:53,812 --> 02:06:00,627
This world is full of cheats.
Only you I feel is true.

1191
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:02,958
Only you I feel is true.

1192
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:41,871
Sir? How come you are here?

1193
02:06:42,394 --> 02:06:45,466
I've bought a tube
well for your village.

1194
02:06:46,398 --> 02:06:47,741
For my village?
- Yes.

1195
02:06:49,001 --> 02:06:51,880
I was in tears when I
heard about your village.

1196
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:58,551
And as humanity..
- I admit I'm in need.

1197
02:06:59,345 --> 02:07:02,292
But I'm not so helpless as
to burden someone else..

1198
02:07:02,348 --> 02:07:03,554
..with my problems.

1199
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:11,359
This is a very big favor. I
won't be able to repay it.

1200
02:07:12,358 --> 02:07:17,330
Great! That day I saw you crying
over the ruination of your village.

1201
02:07:18,564 --> 02:07:22,774
You portrayed the helplessness
of people dying for water.

1202
02:07:23,902 --> 02:07:26,712
You said, the entire
village had drowned in tears.

1203
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,578
And now when I've got the
tube well for your village".

1204
02:07:32,378 --> 02:07:33,584
..your conscience pricks you.

1205
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:37,723
You speak of pride now?

1206
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:44,330
I'm not donating
this tube well to you..

1207
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:49,339
It's like a loan. When
you are capable to repay..

1208
02:07:49,395 --> 02:07:51,932
..you can come over.

1209
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:57,542
He's right. We too take
things on credit from each other.

1210
02:07:57,803 --> 02:07:59,339
When we have the money, we repay it.

1211
02:08:00,072 --> 02:08:03,485
Nowadays one country
takes loan from another one.

1212
02:08:03,609 --> 02:08:07,079
It's a crime to steal, to
deceive someone is a sin.

1213
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:08,416
But to take a loan is no crime.

1214
02:08:09,348 --> 02:08:11,760
Brother, uncle is right.

1215
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:19,098
Sir, you have done me a great favor.

1216
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:22,764
I'll never be able to
forget it in my life.

1217
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:25,636
My first priority now
is to repay your loan.

1218
02:08:25,898 --> 02:08:28,572
You alone will not repay it.

1219
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:31,109
We will repay the loan together.

1220
02:08:42,848 --> 02:08:45,124
Welcome, daddy. Welcome.

1221
02:08:48,454 --> 02:08:51,128
Bravo, my son!

1222
02:08:51,924 --> 02:08:54,404
Now you even have the guts
to sit with your shoes..

1223
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:57,134
..on the table in
front of your father!

1224
02:08:58,464 --> 02:09:02,412
And you too gave a
tube well to Vijay..

1225
02:09:02,468 --> 02:09:04,004
..and ruined my destiny!

1226
02:09:05,137 --> 02:09:09,142
Being a father you've
destroyed your own son!

1227
02:09:10,409 --> 02:09:13,618
How come you're
connected with all this matter?

1228
02:09:14,146 --> 02:09:16,148
I had struck a deal
of the land there.

1229
02:09:16,815 --> 02:09:18,817
I was supposed to open
a gambling den there.

1230
02:09:19,084 --> 02:09:21,155
I would've gained in crores.

1231
02:09:21,687 --> 02:09:24,429
But by giving him the
tube well you have..

1232
02:09:25,624 --> 02:09:30,039
If the tube well reaches there,
the villagers will get water.

1233
02:09:30,496 --> 02:09:33,500
If the land yields water..

1234
02:09:34,833 --> 02:09:37,439
..then we are
bound to lose the land.

1235
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:41,179
You?! You are with my son?

1236
02:09:41,573 --> 02:09:48,855
Yes. And also a partner in
this deal with your son.

1237
02:09:49,114 --> 02:09:52,186
This is not possible.

1238
02:09:52,918 --> 02:09:57,196
A son always learns
from what his father does.

1239
02:09:58,524 --> 02:10:04,065
You forgot so soon?
Those tears, the blood..

1240
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:07,672
..the story which
is written in blood.

1241
02:10:30,088 --> 02:10:34,503
Daddy, I thought you to
be very noble, pious..

1242
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:39,509
..a gentleman who always
trod on the right path.

1243
02:10:40,632 --> 02:10:42,578
But you are a murderer.

1244
02:10:43,635 --> 02:10:46,241
You past is stained
with someone's murder.

1245
02:10:46,638 --> 02:10:50,176
I feel ashamed to
call you my father.

1246
02:10:50,843 --> 02:10:53,255
I haven't murdered anyone.

1247
02:10:54,046 --> 02:10:58,256
This is a plot hatched by
him and his brother Lankeshwar.

1248
02:10:59,585 --> 02:11:01,929
They had trapped me.

1249
02:11:02,788 --> 02:11:04,790
I'm innocent, my son.

1250
02:11:05,591 --> 02:11:11,064
ls it? If you were innocent,
then why hide this matter?

1251
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:14,667
It's only for you.

1252
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:18,680
I didn't want the society to
address you as a killer's son.

1253
02:11:19,538 --> 02:11:23,008
I didn't want you
to become an orphan.

1254
02:11:24,676 --> 02:11:28,681
But now even you are
trapped in their ploy!

1255
02:11:30,148 --> 02:11:35,029
These serpents will not
spare any human being.

1256
02:11:36,822 --> 02:11:40,964
Leave their company, else
they'll turn your life into hell.

1257
02:11:41,627 --> 02:11:47,305
Tell me, will you take
back the tube well from him?

1258
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:51,775
Son, recognize who is
friend and who is a foe!

1259
02:11:52,104 --> 02:11:54,983
Will you take back the
tube well from Vijay?

1260
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,179
They'll spoil your life!

1261
02:11:57,309 --> 02:12:00,188
Will you take back the
tube well from Vijay?

1262
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:06,593
You have time till evening.
If you don't take back..

1263
02:12:06,652 --> 02:12:11,601
..the tube well, the photographs
you see lying in your house..

1264
02:12:11,657 --> 02:12:15,332
...will be given to the police.
- The decision is yours.

1265
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:18,604
Whether you will take the
tube well back from Vijay..

1266
02:12:18,664 --> 02:12:21,645
..or will you like
to be hanged to death!

1267
02:12:21,867 --> 02:12:23,210
Let's go, partner.
- Come on.

1268
02:12:46,224 --> 02:12:50,229
Here it is. Now our
village has got a tube well.

1269
02:12:50,362 --> 02:12:53,172
Henceforth there will be
no water problem here.

1270
02:12:53,231 --> 02:12:55,905
True.
- Now you people are rejoicing.

1271
02:12:56,034 --> 02:12:59,174
The other day you abused him.
Go on, abuse him now.

1272
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:01,373
Isn't he a brave men? He
has got the tube well.

1273
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:06,186
Very true. You've come as a
light of hope in our lives.

1274
02:13:06,712 --> 02:13:10,922
People will bless you
when they get water.

1275
02:13:11,249 --> 02:13:14,924
You've bought a new life
to everyone in this village.

1276
02:13:15,187 --> 02:13:19,863
Enough! You've praised me too much.

1277
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:23,067
Come.. meet him.

1278
02:13:24,863 --> 02:13:26,672
He's my sister's
would be husband, Amar.

1279
02:13:26,798 --> 02:13:28,709
Greetings, Mr.
Amar. Congratulations!

1280
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:31,072
Now you too have become
a part of our village.

1281
02:13:31,403 --> 02:13:35,283
Not only him, she too has
become a part of this village.

1282
02:13:35,674 --> 02:13:38,416
She's my sister-in-law to be.

1283
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:49,423
Geeta, I had kept these
bangles for Vijay's beloved.

1284
02:13:50,355 --> 02:13:55,429
I thought, these bangles
will change her destiny.

1285
02:13:56,361 --> 02:13:57,897
You are indeed fortunate!

1286
02:14:03,301 --> 02:14:05,907
Trouble! Brother, trouble!

1287
02:14:06,438 --> 02:14:08,440
Vijay has got the tube well.

1288
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:11,844
I'll destroy the tube well itself.

1289
02:14:12,044 --> 02:14:13,921
The tree and the root
both will be destroyed.

1290
02:14:14,379 --> 02:14:16,188
Peace!

1291
02:14:17,716 --> 02:14:21,323
I need both the tree and the root.

1292
02:14:22,454 --> 02:14:26,869
I will not destroy any of them.

1293
02:14:28,193 --> 02:14:33,199
I'll play such a move that
everyone will leave this village.

1294
02:14:34,332 --> 02:14:38,474
There will be corpses all over.

1295
02:15:32,524 --> 02:15:37,997
This is what she says,
day and night..

1296
02:15:38,263 --> 02:15:42,541
This is what she says,
day and night.

1297
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:47,079
This is what she says
every morning and evening.

1298
02:15:47,139 --> 02:15:51,554
This is what she says,
day and night.

1299
02:15:51,877 --> 02:15:56,292
This is what she says,
every morning and evening.

1300
02:15:56,481 --> 02:16:01,430
It's not bad at all.

1301
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:06,225
She calls him her life.

1302
02:16:06,958 --> 02:16:08,904
But who is it?

1303
02:16:09,027 --> 02:16:17,310
Her beloved" her lover.

1304
02:16:49,467 --> 02:16:53,472
Yesterday my beloved
had come on the roof top.

1305
02:16:53,605 --> 02:16:58,350
He took my arms in his and said..

1306
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:00,150
What?

1307
02:17:02,614 --> 02:17:06,619
Come into my arms, my dear.

1308
02:17:06,952 --> 02:17:11,367
I said, don't force me.

1309
02:17:11,489 --> 02:17:14,095
Then, what happened?
- How do I tell you?

1310
02:17:14,492 --> 02:17:18,634
He must have kissed the
flowers in your hair.

1311
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:21,977
You must have swayed in his arms.

1312
02:17:23,368 --> 02:17:28,647
He must have hugged you
tightly and loved you.

1313
02:17:28,974 --> 02:17:30,385
Oh God!

1314
02:17:30,976 --> 02:17:35,049
It's not bad at all.

1315
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:38,259
She calls him her life.

1316
02:17:38,316 --> 02:17:39,454
But who is it?

1317
02:17:39,651 --> 02:17:48,002
Her beloved" her lover".

1318
02:17:53,465 --> 02:17:57,675
This is what she says,
day and night.

1319
02:17:57,936 --> 02:18:02,078
This is what she says,
every morning and evening.

1320
02:18:33,571 --> 02:18:37,713
This youth is killing me.

1321
02:18:38,176 --> 02:18:42,249
I'll go crazy.

1322
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:51,064
I spend sleepless nights.

1323
02:18:51,256 --> 02:18:55,398
My heart craves for love.

1324
02:18:56,995 --> 02:19:00,408
You are in a bad state.

1325
02:19:01,333 --> 02:19:04,746
You are bitten by a love bug.

1326
02:19:05,737 --> 02:19:10,083
Go, meet your beloved on the sly.

1327
02:19:10,475 --> 02:19:11,749
Oh God!

1328
02:19:13,611 --> 02:19:18,026
She says it in the bus
and also in the train..

1329
02:19:18,149 --> 02:19:22,620
She says it in the
theater and also in the hotel.

1330
02:19:22,754 --> 02:19:27,635
She says it on the
streets and also on the avenues.

1331
02:19:28,293 --> 02:19:30,773
It is not bad at all.

1332
02:19:32,697 --> 02:19:35,644
She calls him his life.

1333
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:36,770
But who is it?

1334
02:19:37,168 --> 02:19:45,644
Her beloved" her lover".

1335
02:19:51,182 --> 02:19:55,460
This is what she says,
day and night.

1336
02:19:55,653 --> 02:19:59,533
This is what she says,
every morning and evening.

1337
02:20:00,058 --> 02:20:04,131
This is what she says,
day and night.

1338
02:20:04,529 --> 02:20:08,671
This is what she says,
every morning and evening.

1339
02:20:17,809 --> 02:20:21,814
This is what she says,
day and night.

1340
02:20:22,147 --> 02:20:26,357
This is what she says,
every morning and evening.

1341
02:21:08,526 --> 02:21:13,134
Villagers, until I'm alive
only blood can flow here..

1342
02:21:13,198 --> 02:21:15,542
..and not water.

1343
02:21:16,601 --> 02:21:22,552
Hey, savior! Dare you make a move!

1344
02:21:24,409 --> 02:21:29,757
The villagers will all
be shattered to pieces.

1345
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:33,693
Rajeshwar, you? You
are hands with him?

1346
02:21:34,152 --> 02:21:37,895
Shut up, oldie!
Venom mixes with venom..

1347
02:21:38,356 --> 02:21:40,700
Fire rages with fire!

1348
02:21:41,226 --> 02:21:44,366
Then how can a
brother leave his brother?

1349
02:21:47,432 --> 02:21:48,570
Attack!

1350
02:22:06,718 --> 02:22:07,788
Vijay-

1351
02:22:12,257 --> 02:22:13,327
Stop!

1352
02:22:15,326 --> 02:22:20,935
Sit back and enjoy yourself.

1353
02:22:21,666 --> 02:22:25,478
Hell with him.

1354
02:22:26,404 --> 02:22:29,749
Now I will surely enjoy myself.

1355
02:22:32,544 --> 02:22:33,614
Brother!

1356
02:22:37,882 --> 02:22:38,952
No!

1357
02:22:45,223 --> 02:22:46,293
Amar.

1358
02:22:46,491 --> 02:22:47,561
Amar.

1359
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:00,779
Take this! Take this!

1360
02:23:02,507 --> 02:23:03,645
You are done for!

1361
02:23:10,248 --> 02:23:11,852
What did I say?

1362
02:23:13,251 --> 02:23:15,527
I'm Lankeshwar.

1363
02:23:16,854 --> 02:23:21,325
This is my region.
I'm the Lord here.

1364
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:27,809
Did you enjoy?

1365
02:23:30,935 --> 02:23:33,415
Now there's something more.

1366
02:23:34,606 --> 02:23:38,019
Your father's name
was Shankar Narayan.

1367
02:23:39,677 --> 02:23:42,556
You know the cause of his death.

1368
02:23:44,415 --> 02:23:45,553
You don't?

1369
02:23:46,551 --> 02:23:47,621
I'll tell you.

1370
02:23:48,753 --> 02:23:53,759
15 years back..

1371
02:23:53,891 --> 02:23:55,029
Hey brother..

1372
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:57,039
Listen.. It's a wonder..

1373
02:23:57,762 --> 02:24:01,039
Look at this..
- What happened?

1374
02:24:02,567 --> 02:24:04,774
Look, I've hit a
jackpot worth 10 lakhs.

1375
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:08,041
Really? Congratulations!

1376
02:24:08,439 --> 02:24:15,049
The jackpot you've won
is all clue to this amulet.

1377
02:24:15,446 --> 02:24:20,725
Congratulations, Shankar!
You've turned a millionaire.

1378
02:24:20,918 --> 02:24:23,592
Won't you hug me?

1379
02:24:23,855 --> 02:24:24,925
Yes, brother.

1380
02:24:33,064 --> 02:24:34,543
Lankeshwar, what have you done?

1381
02:24:39,737 --> 02:24:44,083
Shankar is dead and
Agarwal is trapped.

1382
02:24:51,082 --> 02:24:56,623
After that, three things
took place in our life.

1383
02:24:57,755 --> 02:25:00,099
Your mother died of the shock!

1384
02:25:03,094 --> 02:25:05,096
You became an orphan!

1385
02:25:06,631 --> 02:25:11,102
I grabbed the jackpot
and made all this property.

1386
02:25:16,441 --> 02:25:21,117
Great! He's of no use.

1387
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:26,391
Throw him in the valley. Leave us.

1388
02:25:37,862 --> 02:25:38,932
No.

1389
02:25:50,408 --> 02:25:53,150
Vijay!
- Let go off me!

1390
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:54,481
Leave me.

1391
02:25:57,882 --> 02:26:04,561
Villagers.. you have 24 hours left.

1392
02:26:06,023 --> 02:26:11,029
Give me your lands and
vacate this village.

1393
02:26:11,095 --> 02:26:16,568
Else.. you know, I'm Lankeshwar..

1394
02:26:18,503 --> 02:26:22,474
This is my region.
And I'm the lord here.

1395
02:26:22,707 --> 02:26:25,187
My Lord..
- Take them away.

1396
02:26:25,843 --> 02:26:26,913
Lankeshwar.

1397
02:26:27,178 --> 02:26:32,457
Don't worry. I've
made arrangements for..

1398
02:26:32,517 --> 02:26:35,726
..you also. I'll
teach you a lesson too.

1399
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:38,600
Take him away.

1400
02:29:17,081 --> 02:29:19,083
Hey! GO!

1401
02:29:19,283 --> 02:29:20,353
Hey! GO!

1402
02:29:41,639 --> 02:29:47,385
Chief, save me!

1403
02:29:47,645 --> 02:29:48,715
Save me.

1404
02:29:48,779 --> 02:29:50,190
Don't..

1405
02:29:50,314 --> 02:29:55,263
No, Vijay.. don't..

1406
02:29:56,253 --> 02:29:57,926
No, Vijay.. don't..

1407
02:29:58,189 --> 02:30:01,193
<i>L</i> beg Of you!

1408
02:30:01,659 --> 02:30:03,138
<i>L</i> beg Of you!

1409
02:30:04,729 --> 02:30:05,799
No.

1410
02:30:06,130 --> 02:30:10,078
Take your papers back. Take it.

1411
02:30:10,267 --> 02:30:11,337
Take it. I don't want them.

1412
02:30:11,802 --> 02:30:16,148
No, Vijay. Save me, chief.

1413
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,217
Villagers, save me.

1414
02:30:19,276 --> 02:30:23,884
No.. wait! I'm coming to you.

1415
02:30:26,283 --> 02:30:30,732
Forgive me. Save me.

1416
02:30:33,357 --> 02:30:35,837
Please.. I'm not your culprit.

1417
02:30:36,961 --> 02:30:39,168
It's Lankeshwar who
killed your father.

1418
02:30:39,764 --> 02:30:42,108
It was he who
stopped the water supply.

1419
02:30:42,767 --> 02:30:44,906
He is responsible for
the state you are in.

1420
02:30:45,302 --> 02:30:48,772
I haven't done anything.

1421
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:54,786
I too stay in this village.
Vijay, please save me.

1422
02:30:54,979 --> 02:30:58,984
Where's Lankeshwar?
- I'll tell you.

1423
02:30:59,717 --> 02:31:03,859
That son of a bitch,
is in the sugar factory.

1424
02:31:04,321 --> 02:31:08,064
And he has taken your sister,
your friend..

1425
02:31:08,392 --> 02:31:10,804
..Geeta and Bijli along with him.

1426
02:31:12,396 --> 02:31:16,344
Vijay, kill him! Kill him.

1427
02:31:17,001 --> 02:31:20,881
But please spare me. Forgive me.

1428
02:31:26,343 --> 02:31:27,754
I'm dead!

1429
02:31:29,346 --> 02:31:32,884
Brother Vijay, forgive me.

1430
02:31:33,884 --> 02:31:40,165
Only the villagers will
decide about your fate.

1431
02:31:44,095 --> 02:31:46,166
No!

1432
02:31:47,231 --> 02:31:48,301
Hey, chief..

1433
02:31:53,838 --> 02:31:56,512
No. No.

1434
02:31:56,841 --> 02:32:02,257
Hit him. Kill this idiot!

1435
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:05,189
Kill this idiot!

1436
02:32:15,993 --> 02:32:20,203
Please don't hit him.
Let him go. For god's sake.

1437
02:32:23,868 --> 02:32:25,848
No!

1438
02:32:26,403 --> 02:32:27,882
Let go off me!

1439
02:32:28,472 --> 02:32:30,543
Let go off me!

1440
02:32:33,277 --> 02:32:38,852
Niranjan, you are
still sitting here?

1441
02:32:40,885 --> 02:32:43,559
Take that girl away.

1442
02:32:43,954 --> 02:32:45,228
Dare you touch her!

1443
02:32:47,091 --> 02:32:50,834
Bijli, cool down.

1444
02:32:53,497 --> 02:32:57,445
Vijay, your he-man
is in the heaven now.

1445
02:32:57,501 --> 02:33:00,573
No! You're lying. It's impossible.

1446
02:33:00,971 --> 02:33:04,851
It's true. And you know,
your lover..

1447
02:33:04,909 --> 02:33:07,856
..too will soon give
company to your brother.

1448
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:13,587
Don't worry, I will
not do anything with you.

1449
02:33:14,852 --> 02:33:17,594
You are Rajeshwar's guest.

1450
02:33:18,923 --> 02:33:23,065
You are my sister-in-law!
He'll soon be here.

1451
02:33:40,277 --> 02:33:43,622
Where's Rajeshwar? The
address of this place?

1452
02:33:44,481 --> 02:33:47,621
Hey! Why is he still alive?

1453
02:33:48,485 --> 02:33:50,624
Kill him. GO!

1454
02:33:53,958 --> 02:33:55,028
Come on!

1455
02:34:46,543 --> 02:34:47,613
No.

1456
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:57,490
No.

1457
02:35:00,624 --> 02:35:02,160
Bijili.

1458
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:10,706
Come on, go and kill him!

1459
02:35:19,243 --> 02:35:20,313
Bijili.

1460
02:35:22,313 --> 02:35:23,986
Bijili.

1461
02:35:24,315 --> 02:35:25,453
What have you done?

1462
02:35:25,983 --> 02:35:27,053
Bijili.

1463
02:37:42,186 --> 02:37:43,256
Brother..

1464
02:37:47,858 --> 02:37:49,531
Where's uncle John
and rest of the people?

1465
02:37:49,726 --> 02:37:52,605
They are busy..
- Busy?

1466
02:37:53,664 --> 02:37:55,143
Busy preparing for your marriage.

1467
02:37:55,799 --> 02:37:56,869
Mine?
- Yes.

1468
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:01,747
This is your gift.

1469
02:38:03,607 --> 02:38:09,751
Legally you are the sole
owner of Lankeshwar's property.

1470
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:14,626
You've done us a favor by
returning what belongs to Vijay.

1471
02:38:14,818 --> 02:38:17,890
Now there will no
water problem again.

1472
02:38:18,489 --> 02:38:23,905
Vijay, now your water and
marriage problem are solved.

1473
02:38:24,228 --> 02:38:27,766
But what about my problem?
- Why do you worry?

1474
02:38:28,432 --> 02:38:29,570
You too will get married.

1475
02:38:30,634 --> 02:38:32,910
Sir will give away
my sister in marriage.

1476
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:39,444
Yes. Of course!
