1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,229
Oh God!

2
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:00,221
Someone murdered him
in such a classy apartment

3
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,914
l don't know what to say...

4
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,641
He was such a nice man
They killed him...

5
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:09,906
Nothing's been stolen
l don't know the motive

6
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:14,671
No one is safe these days
They were so happy...!

7
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,858
What will l do
without you, my son?

8
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:27,704
My dear...

9
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:34,928
Oh God!

10
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,524
l had such wonderful
dreams for you!

11
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,650
Ram?

12
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:12,838
Ram!

13
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,745
Janani...Janani?

14
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:05,064
Madam, don't do it
Listen to me, please

15
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:24,684
ls curd rice enough
for this afternoon?

16
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,249
Anything's fine, mom

17
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,496
Aren't you late for school?

18
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,305
There's still time, dad
The last bell's only at 8.45

19
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,096
Do you have to
wait for the last bell?

20
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,107
And get yourfeet off the table!

21
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:44,660
Son, l've packed chicken curry
and fish fry for lunch

22
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,769
ls this enough or do you want
something crunchy with it?

23
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:47,887
No thanks, mom
This is enough

24
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:50,411
Okay, make sure you eat...
don't give it all away to yourfriends

25
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,770
She's asking you not to share
What are you looking at?

26
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:57,000
Will anyone believe
that he's my son?

27
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,345
Mom, drop Sumi in school

28
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,070
Just for today,
l have special class

29
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,785
- lt's only 5 minutes, take her!
- She's not even ready yet, mom

30
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,527
Here!

31
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,928
Ram! lt looks like it will rain
Go and get dropped in the car

32
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,880
lf l go in the car,
l'll get no respect, mom

33
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:15,697
At least put on a raincoat

34
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,602
A raincoat!? What happens
to my 'image' then?

35
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,497
l'll reach school
before it rains

36
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:41,882
Excuse me!

37
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,299
Excuse me, may l help?

38
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:47,784
Thanks, l've been trying for so long
l haven't been able to fix it

39
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,777
These cycle chains are like that!
But all girls sit and ride them

40
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,910
- Done
- Thanks!

41
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,476
- Which school?!
- Thank you

42
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,333
Hey! Which school's uniform
is maroon with white checks?

43
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,496
- l think it's AVM, dude
- Dumbo, AVM's green and white

44
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,492
Right?

45
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,751
Do you know, da?
Maroon with white checks?

46
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,187
Why do you want to know?

47
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,673
- Shut up
- l think it's Bala Laka Lok

48
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,154
No, no...

49
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,095
lt's Vidyaniketan
My sister studies there

50
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,563
Does she at least look good?

51
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,034
Why did you even
talk to that monkey?

52
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,550
Like you are some
'great looker'! Get lost!!

53
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,041
Do we have to pick up
this old man?

54
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,495
Where are you taking me?

55
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,771
lt's a big deal that
l even brought you along

56
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:53,852
Shut up and wait

57
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,732
Yuck! l can only see
boys coming out

58
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,956
- Maybe she left
- Who, dude?

59
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,056
ln the morning, in the rain,
on the road, l saw her

60
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,166
Oh! Magic moment
first sight...love

61
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,172
Nice figure, checking out
Maybe tomorrow love

62
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,167
- Nice
- Thanks

63
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,775
Dude, that's her
Look! That's the girl

64
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:21,725
- She's not that great, dude
- Not the shortie, the tall one!

65
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:22,970
Look to your left

66
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,504
l was talking
about the tall one only

67
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,549
The shortie actually
looks good, dude

68
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:30,677
Did you listen to the songs
from 'Kushi' movie?

69
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:34,037
All the boys are singing
that ''Hug me, hug me'' song

70
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:35,115
What is it?

71
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,524
What?

72
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,863
Turn around and bend
Turn around!

73
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:43,873
Girls looking at you
is something great, bro

74
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,190
They are not looking
They are glaring

75
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,010
She's laughing

76
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,539
She's leaving!

77
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,051
Bro, climb on! Quick!

78
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,345
Let's follow her
and find out where she lives

79
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,171
- Come!
- l have project work, l'm going

80
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,308
What a loser!
Come, we'll go

81
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:01,110
Bye, Sumi!
Go carefully!

82
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,751
- Did you study about electronics?
- l haven't even started as yet!

83
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,791
We have a test on Friday
l'm scared

84
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,000
ls there a revision test on Thursday?

85
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:14,693
Oh God!
Oh!

86
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,723
Do these 2 not ride
their cycles at all?

87
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:21,238
We might as well walk for this

88
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:22,586
Shut up and come!

89
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:29,676
Dude, let me give you an idea

90
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,570
From tomorrow,
we'll follow them from here

91
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,420
I have asked for a Scooter
so many times

92
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:34,349
Started your lament?

93
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,660
''You have to go to the U.S,
We must save money for that''

94
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,448
Same lecture, daily!

95
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:41,446
- l don't even want to go to the U.S
- l'd go happily if l were you

96
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:54,066
- Yuck! She attends extra classes!
- l know, right?

97
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:55,981
We made a mistake!

98
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,320
We should have
followed her sister instead!

99
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,359
We'd know where she stays then!

100
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,288
No, dude
This is better than that

101
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:11,396
Dude, listen to me!

102
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,848
Don't do what
you intend doing

103
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,565
Now l'll be reading the revision
results forthe week

104
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,555
l'll call you all one by one
Come and take it

105
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,175
lt's a big deal that
l even come to school

106
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:38,052
And you made me
come and sit here!

107
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:42,368
You should be...
get lost!

108
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:46,202
- This boy's actually studying, man!
- Don't feel bad, bro

109
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,152
l deserve it all!

110
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,986
Who'd cry if she didn't
come to tuition class?

111
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,148
- This is the right class, isn't it?
- Yeah

112
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,913
- We've come to the right place?
- Yeah

113
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:03,109
- We didn'tjoin a wrong class?
- No, no dude, please!

114
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:07,966
Look, you can come
sit next to this girl

115
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,613
l don't want any girl, let me go

116
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:12,981
What will you do
at home anyway?

117
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,384
Shut it!

118
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:23,753
Brilliant!

119
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,706
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, sir!

120
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,303
Why are you stopping here?

121
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:26,978
Do your relatives
live here or something?

122
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,832
l don't know
where she's taking me next!

123
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,430
What are you doing?
Come here!

124
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,767
You are in 12th grade

125
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,177
And you still don't know
how to wear a tie

126
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,052
When will you learn
all these basic things, Ram?

127
00:11:58,851 --> 00:11:59,581
Thank you, sir
Thank you, sir

128
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,565
Why are you late?
The VP's going to yell!

129
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,612
lt was dad's fault!

130
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,440
He kept going on all sentimentally
about ties and everything

131
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,715
At least your dad
knows what a tie is

132
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:09,013
My dad thinks it's a hand-kerchief
and puts it in his pocket!

133
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,319
Brilliant, dude!

134
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,470
The 2 fields are at
right angles to each

135
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,556
Electric field
and Magnetic field!

136
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:23,259
So...hey! You!
Yes, you! Get up!

137
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:24,706
Get up, get up, l say!

138
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,391
Not you, son,
you sit down

139
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:30,387
Next to him! You!
Get up!

140
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:33,240
Buffalo! l'm talking to you!
You don't know how to get up?

141
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,172
- Me, sir?
- Why the doubt? Get up

142
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,834
Define electric dipole

143
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,449
Tell me! You are
wriggling around like noodles...

144
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,952
We don't have time for this

145
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,885
Tell me...Look at his face!
Like an old 5 paise coin

146
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,245
Tell me, now!
Don't you know?

147
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:54,046
l don't know, sir

148
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,606
You shake your head so quickly
when it comes to not knowing

149
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,147
Buffalo! Why did you come here?

150
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,284
Your mind has to be here
when l take class

151
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,774
You came to study, didn't you?
Or did you come to look at girls?

152
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,724
- Damage!
- Sit down, sit down!

153
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,850
These people come here for fun
And l'm wasting chalk pieces for this

154
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,366
Next time you pay for
the chalk piece yourself

155
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:12,674
Janani!

156
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,149
l'm coming, mom!
Why are you doing this?

157
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:20,034
- l can plait my own hair
- l'm sure...come, sit down

158
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,268
Sit down, l'm late
l have to go to the US Embassy

159
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,341
Who's going to cry
if we don't go?

160
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,059
Just 'cos your sister has settled
down there doesn't mean we should

161
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:32,277
You do your job and
get 90% in your exams

162
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:36,165
You focus on doing just that
l know what's best for you

163
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,953
- Good evening!
- Good evening, sir

164
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,211
All of you have come
earlier than me for once

165
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,081
lt's very surprising

166
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,076
- Sit down
- Sir, you are late!

167
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,284
Who was that? Buffalo!

168
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:51,417
Today we'll talk about
energy released in fission

169
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:53,653
Let us calculate the amount of

170
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,000
-We could have come
10 minutes later, dude

171
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,375
Buffalo! Don't you know
how to say 'excuse me'?

172
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,422
Excuse me, sir

173
00:13:57,495 --> 00:14:00,755
Yes, say it after coming into class!
How will these boys ever learn?

174
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,474
Talk to me!
Bro! Look at me!

175
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,230
Get lost!

176
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:30,445
Look they've come
Don't know where they'll turn

177
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:36,639
Don't come this way again!
Aiya! What kind of look is that?

178
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:47,322
Hey! Get up!
What are you looking at?

179
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,198
l've been noticing you
for a few days now

180
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:56,552
Not you, buffalo, you sit
You! Get up

181
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,011
- State Gauss law! Answer me
- Gauss law, sir?

182
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,390
Then what?
Your mother-in-law?

183
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:06,877
- Yes, Gauss law!
- He doesn't know

184
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:09,181
Gauss's law, also known as
Gauss's flux theorem is a law...

185
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:12,281
... relating to the distribution of electric
charge to the resulting electric field

186
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,414
lt also states that the electric flux
through any closed surface...

187
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,872
...is proportional to
the enclosed electric charge

188
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:21,171
-Anything else, sir?
- Very good! Sit down

189
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:23,532
Don't sit next to him!
He'll spoil you

190
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,869
Make him sit next to her
lt'll be easier

191
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,528
- Did you pay the fees, son?
- Yes, sir

192
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:31,009
Wonderful! And this buffalo
hasn't paid for 3 months!

193
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,292
Where's the money
for my chalk piece?

194
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:33,700
lt's a big deal that
l'm even coming here, sir!

195
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,835
Who's asking you to come?
l'm asking you not to come!

196
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:37,945
l'll pay your tuition fees!
Take it and leave!

197
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:40,318
l'm standing here and screaming
And he's not even paying attention to me!

198
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,780
All of this happens
when you try to get a girl, dude

199
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,088
Take down notes

200
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,081
These teachers pick
on boys for time pass

201
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:52,615
Senthil, tell him not to drag me along
with him and ruin my studies also

202
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,638
Don't joke!
You and studies?!

203
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,565
She looks beautiful
in a uniform, doesn't she?

204
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,636
That day you said she looked
better in casual wear

205
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,426
- Uh oh, Did She hear us?
- What happened?

206
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,117
- Wait for 2 minutes, l'll come
- Why?

207
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,838
- Just Wait
- Bro, it worked! Let's leave now

208
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,947
Janani, Janani!

209
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,583
Let's stand 5 steps
away from here

210
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,759
- Hi
- Your name is Ram, isn't it?

211
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,186
Why do you follow me
wherever l go?

212
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:26,663
Listen Ram, this kind of
coming wherever l go

213
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,615
...and waiting for me
to leave is bad, don't do it

214
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,205
lf someone sees it
and tells people at home

215
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,979
...it'll become a big issue
So...l hope you understand

216
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,791
- Okay?
- One minute...

217
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:41,615
l won't wait for you
or follow you or anything

218
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,363
Just give me your phone number

219
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:49,609
l'm talking to you so
decently about this

220
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,238
And you are behaving
so indecently

221
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,129
Understand...okay?

222
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,107
You are making fun of me!

223
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,345
lndia's #1 cement

224
00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:00,824
lndia's premium cement
Ram cements!

225
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,437
- Good evening, sir
- Good evening students

226
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:14,568
Go to page 133

227
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,473
Why is that bench empty?
Which 'pain' hasn't come?

228
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:18,853
- New guys, sir
- Oh okay

229
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:22,754
Bridge rectifier
is shown in fig. 9.16

230
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,427
D1 ...D2...D3 and D4

231
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:54,773
Wow...wowwwww...wow!

232
00:18:54,878 --> 00:19:02,670
Wow...wowwwww...wow!

233
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:10,693
On your lips, l see
a half-smile, honey

234
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,140
That's enough...really!

235
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:23,476
Your smile, my dearie
made my pulse race rapidly

236
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,731
You made my darkness glow

237
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:33,422
You humbled my ego
and made it bend and bow

238
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:10,012
Profess your love to me
My kurinji flower...a rarity

239
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,969
My love for you is true

240
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,649
l will make sure
you will never feel blue!

241
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:26,990
Till the ends of the earth
l'll follow you

242
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,176
lf you just say yes
l'll give you the moon too

243
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,330
l'll walk behind you
at the distance of your shadow

244
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,777
That moment of idolatry
l captured as poetry

245
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:43,320
Oh girl...my sweetie
honey bunch, come to me

246
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:51,346
You etched your name in my soul
You made my pulse lose control

247
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:55,433
You made my darkness glow

248
00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:01,160
You humbled my ego
and made it bend and bow

249
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:20,907
Oh girl...my sweetie
sugar cube, come to me

250
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:24,935
You etched your name
into my soul

251
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,311
Oh girl...my sweetie
my nectarine, come to me

252
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:33,602
You etched your name
into my heart

253
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,639
Tell me that you love me

254
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:37,884
You are my kurinji...a specialty!

255
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,868
My love for you is always true

256
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,490
l will make sure
you will never feel blue!

257
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:50,856
Oh girl...my sweetie

258
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:14,799
481-20-23
Not writing it down?

259
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,175
Such things will get
imprinted naturally

260
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:50,248
l think that's her dad
Let's get out of here

261
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,311
What happened?
Why are you walking?

262
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,659
Where's your cycle?

263
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:56,483
There was a puncture
l left it at the sho-

264
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,464
Okay, you go home, dear
l'll come

265
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:02,710
- Go
- Dude, get out of here!

266
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,721
Son, why are you
following that girl?

267
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:12,040
No uncle, l was at tuition class

268
00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:16,361
-Are you with him?
- No sir, l came-

269
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:18,181
Your parents struggled
send you to school

270
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,103
And you follow girls
around like this

271
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,947
Aren't you ashamed of
yourselves? Street rats...

272
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,919
If I see you here again,
l won't let you go in 1 piece

273
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:26,270
Get out of here!

274
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:43,109
What is it, Sumi?

275
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,341
We are late! Let me go!
l need to put my books in

276
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:29,716
Why did you come here?
Go!

277
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,819
l needed to say
something important

278
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,873
lsn't the slap you got
yesterday enough?

279
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,296
lf they see you here
you are dead...go!

280
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,675
Just one little thing

281
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:45,246
Pch! Okay wait outside
in that road next to class

282
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,256
l'll come and talk to you
Okay?

283
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,510
Okay!

284
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:51,446

285
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,769
l love you

286
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,280
Okay go, l'll see you
in the evening

287
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,995
Okay
1 minute, 1 minute...1 minute

288
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:14,850
-AiyO! What is it now?
- lf you could tell me you reciprocate...

289
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:17,308
l'll tell you in the evening
GO!

290
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,933
No no no, please
please tell me now

291
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:21,785
ls this some new technique
to cornerthe girl outside her house

292
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:23,126
And force her to say yes or no?

293
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,604
lt's not that...in case you don't

294
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:28,561
l don't have to wait
like an idiot in the evening?!

295
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:29,417
That's why...

296
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:43,223
l do love you

297
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:48,663
- Now, go!
- Okay

298
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,386
Dude...she said
okay to YOU?!

299
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:15,766
l don't believe it!
lt's a medical miracle!

300
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,574
l'm talking to you, dude
He usually never listens to me

301
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,742
Today, he won't even
remember l'm here

302
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,754
At least give me some money
for an auto! l'll go home!

303
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,346
Please!

304
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:39,359
- Hi
- Hi!

305
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,056
That's what l thought

306
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,086
We are like idiots
waiting around for them

307
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:51,597
Listen, l haven't stood like this
and spoken to anyone before

308
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:55,404
Yeah and l stand under trees
everyday and talk to different girls!

309
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:05,566
- Why didn't you come for tuition?
- We are in love now? There's no point

310
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,394
See, don't come near
my house again like that

311
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,325
- lf my dad saw you...
- l already got slapped, remember?.

312
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:19,469
Ram, l feel like all of this is a dream

313
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:21,796
My dad is very strict, Ram

314
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,452
And my mom's been trying
for 5 years for an U.S visa

315
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:26,757
l will definitely go there
for higher studies

316
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:31,134
Then you can't say
'she tricked me, ditched me'

317
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,383
You can't scream at me, write
poetry and curse me and all that

318
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:40,401
You'll come back, won't you?
l'll wait for you

319
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:53,606
- Okay, l'm going now
- That's all?

320
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:57,500
What else?

321
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,527
There's not even
an ''l love you'' or anything

322
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:03,449
l'll tell you when
l feel like saying it

323
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:07,349
Then you don't
feel it now? Okay

324
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,480
Will you take me
for a round on your bike?

325
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:24,414
l like bike rides a lot

326
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:31,033
Kumara!

327
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:33,465
My man won't leave
without me

328
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:34,999
Shall we go-

329
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,407
- Go straight and then come back
- Go straight and don't come back please!

330
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,575
That's my seat!

331
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:03,704
Why are you braking at
speed breakers like that?

332
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:07,243
You yell at us when we brake
and when we don't!

333
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,165
How is a man to go
over a speed breaker then?

334
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:11,718
Okay okay
Take an U-turn

335
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,721
- ls that okay?
- Yes

336
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,583
Let go of my cycle, you pig!

337
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:45,573
Like it's some amazing cycle!
Get out of here!

338
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,163
- Look at his face!
- What's wrong with my face?

339
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:48,196

342
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:26,862
- Come up to your terrace
- What? No way!

343
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,659
Come to the terrace
Okay? Bye!

344
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:30,926
Ram, Ram! Wait!

345
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,177
Crazy girl
l'm going up-

346
00:31:35,975 --> 00:31:37,119
Janani

347
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:40,127
You freaked me out
Ram! What are you doing here?

348
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:41,621
l came to see
how your terrace looks!

349
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,896
lf someone sees you
it'll turn into a big problem

350
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:45,687
l couldn't be
without seeing you, Janani

351
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,604
Please Ram
Please get out of here

352
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:51,441
lf someone comes, l'll die
Sumi's standing guard downstairs

353
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:54,288
Super! lf someone comes
ask her to warn us

354
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:59,268
Oh! Sorry...sorry...sorry
She can't speak, can she?

355
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:02,177
She hasn't been able to
hear since she was a baby

356
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:03,522
That's why
she doesn't talk

357
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,434
But she lip reads and
understands what we say

358
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:09,465
Oh! Like Ajith the actor
From the movie 'Vaali'

359
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,187
No, l meant she can
understand easily...

360
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:18,292
Yes, like Ajith from 'Vaali'

361
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,039
Okay go Ram!
lt's very risky!

362
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:29,667
Okay, l'll hold your hand
for 2 minutes and go

363
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:41,398
Your '2 minutes' is up
Ram, now go

364
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,797
1 minute...1 minute...1 minute

365
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,689
- 1 minute's also over, Ram
- 30 seconds! Please!

366
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,670
Ram, go Ram

367
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:03,449
Janani, l feel like staying
with you forever

368
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,938
Don't you feel that way?

369
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,892
l do, Ram, l feel
like always being with you

370
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,753
- But understand-
- That's enough

371
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,172
Go

372
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,805
1 more minute

373
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:51,362
l'll see you at tuition tomorrow
Don't stand here, go!

374
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:56,857
- Janani! l love you
- l love you too

375
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:03,888
Sandhya...?

376
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,328
And then?

377
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,654
She kissed me on the cheek
and ran away

378
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:11,531
With whom?
l mean, where did she go?

379
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:13,448
- She went back home
- Why?

380
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,721
- Bec-
- Ram!

381
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,172

- Chemistry...12!
- Okay, sir

383
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:26,719
You said you didn't study
and got 12 marks!

384
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:27,644
Betrayer!

385
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:36,203
- l feel strange, dude
- Why? Bad stomach?

386
00:34:37,236 --> 00:34:41,986
That's not it, da
Someone like me is in love

387
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:46,048
I have seen it in the movies
I have seen it at the beach

388
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,544
l've even seen it in our class
But now, l'm in love with a girl!

389
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:54,393
- You know what the beauty is?
- What?

390
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,567
She loves me too!

391
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:59,669
- Kumaran!
- Go bro, you said you did well

392
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:02,067
Sir!

00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,748
Why have you written
all the questions in the answer sheet?

394
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:08,392
What the-! Why did you write
all the questions in your answer sheet?

395
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:10,985
Sorry sir, his mistake!
He'll correct it next time, sir

396
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:15,717
lt's all my bad luck!
You could've at least put some mark

397
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:17,952
ls this what you meant
when you said you did well?

398
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:20,798
Shut up! lt's all because of you
Don't provoke me

399
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:24,056

Where are you calling from?

You can't call here

Janani!

446
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:44,329
Come silently

447
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:47,437
You can't even get to T Nagar
without a license

448
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:49,035
How can you
go to Tirupati?

449
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,413
- Dad?
- What is it, da?

450

453
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:09,072
- That's why l thought l'd also go
- Why all of a sudden?

454
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,236
l wanted to pray to God to
make me pass my 12th grade, dad

455
00:39:12,913 --> 00:39:15,878
You don't need all that
You can study well and pass, now go

456
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:18,091
Hello?

457
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:22,686

His dad keeps picking up the phone

458

ldiot...l wonder
where he's roaming around

459
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,226
We circumambulated the temple

l saw that
Wasn't he with you?

461
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:36,721
He'll never listen
when l say 'let's stick together'!

462
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:39,721
Unless we leave now
how can we reach home by 8:00 P.M?

463
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,336
lsn't this the place we agreed
to meet after the pooja?

464
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:45,826
We'll leave
as soon as he comes

465
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:57,335
Hello?

466
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,608
Ram! Where did
you go, you pig?

467
00:39:59,707 --> 00:40:01,233

- Will you come to my house?
- Huh?

473
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,507
My dad, mom and Sumi are staying
at my aunt's house in Thiruvallur

474
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:16,769
They'll be back

475
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,692
l came home saying
l needed to do record work

476
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:22,169

she'll tell mom and l'll die

479
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,431
Okay...okay

l asked at the cottage
where you stayed

487
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:01,385
They said you had

488
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:03,620
l should have
just waited by the phone

489
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:04,670
Sorry!

490
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:12,122
-Are you crazy?
- Yes, about you!

491
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,358
Don't give me this film dialog!

492

00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:46,798
They are that beautiful

Beauty...so divine

Love of my life...you are beyond
everything in my life, my beloved!

00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:49,389
My beauty, you give a complex
to the word beauty in all respects!

501
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:36,438
You and your roving eyes

502
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:40,624
You w(e)ave magic on me
crossing every boundary

00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:58,139
Let our lips get pampered
primal and unhampered

506
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:05,335
Close your eyes, come close
This is the ultimate lethal dose

507
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:10,023
Within you shall l explore?
Can l share you hardcore?

508
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:15,273
To merge into my heart
shall l show you the art?

509
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:39,976
Your beauty lS from within...
eyes, limbs and glow of your skin!

510
00:45:48,452 --> 00:45:57,334
Love of my life...you are beyond
everything in my life, my beloved!

511
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:02,379
Come in, ma'am

512
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,338
- Where's Janani?
- She's in the balcony

513
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:13,159
She hasn't eaten anything

514
00:46:13,224 --> 00:46:16,037
She keeps crying
l feel terrible

515
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:35,364
You are staying here all alone
Come stay in our house, dear!

516
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:39,047
Or go stay with
Ram's parents

517
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,324
Ram's right here, mom

518
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:50,198
He's here...l won't
leave him and come

519
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:59,527
But he has left you and gone!

520
00:47:10,788 --> 00:47:14,647
l've given Easwari some food
Please eat something

521
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,761
l'll call you

522
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:50,767
Madam, please don't!
Listen to me...

523
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:22,128
Careful!
Come with me...

524
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,406
Why did you
ask me to come here?

525
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,360
l feel like everyone
is staring at me here!

526
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:07,611
My mom got
the U.S visa, Ram

527
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:12,913
They are getting ready to leave

528
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:20,490
l have to go

529
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:25,823
What will you do?

530
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:30,902
Ram...l told you
when we were in school...

531
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,216
l have to go, Ram
Ram! Please say something

532
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:48,771
lt's my parents' lives too, Ram
My mom has struggled a lot forthis

533
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:49,290
Go

534
00:49:52,202 --> 00:49:52,932
Go!

535
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:57,630
Ram! Don't do this!
You said you'd wait...

536
00:49:58,786 --> 00:50:02,774
l'm not saying anything
Go...go, Janani!

537
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:06,868
- Ram
- Go! Just Go

538
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:45,186
Ram! Wake up!
Janani has come!

539
00:50:45,451 --> 00:50:48,164
- Get lost, she's gone to the U.S
- Get up! She's here

540
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:06,187
Kumaran, get up, da

541
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,659
What are you doing here?
Didn't you go to the U.S?

542
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,101
What happened?

543
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,109
l asked you to
call your sister and-

544
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:27,864
What are you doing there?

545
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:35,118
AiyO!
Oh no!!

546
00:51:55,481 --> 00:52:03,404
Why did you do this?
Why did you?! Tell me!

547
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:08,067
Tell me!

548
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:17,853
- l only burned my passport
- How many years did l...

549
00:52:18,143 --> 00:52:24,430
Why did you burn it!?
Why? Why? Are you insane?

550
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:29,903
Mom, l'm in love
with a boy called Ram

551
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:33,475
lf l told you l'm not coming...

552
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,580
...you'd have emotionally
blackmailed me

553
00:52:38,216 --> 00:52:42,140
3 of you go
l'm not coming

554
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:56,492
- Janani...for me
- Do all this later

555
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:57,389
Okay

556
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:00,364
My mom hit me,
l'm not going back there

557
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:04,799
- Marry me right now
-Are you kidding?

558
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,261
Your mom hitting you is not
reason enough to get married!

559
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,431
Plus you shouldn't have
burnt your passport

560
00:53:10,498 --> 00:53:12,916
- You should have explained calmly
- You are right, dude

561
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,836
No, you are not right!

562
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:17,720
Kumara! Keep your
mouth shut! Come!

563
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,983
lf people got married every time
their mother slapped them...

564
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:21,037
...l'd get married everyday

565
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:24,233
Hey, come! We'll go smoke!
What a good idea?!

566
00:53:24,306 --> 00:53:31,073
- Ram? What is it, da?
- l don't know what to do at all

567
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:32,421
Slipper you!

568
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:34,720
l've thrown away
my whole life for you

569
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:36,671
And you don't know what to do?

570
00:53:38,337 --> 00:53:44,527
- You better marry me right now
- You might as well have gone to USA!

571
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,474
Don't l have to talk
to my dad about it?

572
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:48,556
Did l talk to mine?

573
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:49,643
Try talking to him!

574
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:54,182
Didn't he say anything
about you burning the passport?

575
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:55,561
He didn't even talk to me

576
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:57,739
He locked himself inside his room

577
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:06,582
Janani, give me 1 day's time
l need to talk to my dad about it

578
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,606
- Ram?
- Janani! l won't hurt my dad

579
00:54:14,616 --> 00:54:18,353
l understand that you've hurt
everyone in your family just for me

580
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,350
But you have to understand too

581
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:25,890
My dad's never even
raised his voice at me

582
00:54:28,454 --> 00:54:31,930
Janani! Please give me
just 1 day

583
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:35,737
l'll talk to my dad about it
And he'll talk to your parents

584
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:37,592
That's the right thing to do

585
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:44,879
- lf your dad doesn't agree?
- Then we'll do what's wrong

586
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,724
- Mom, mom, please
- You go talk to him

587
00:54:47,824 --> 00:54:51,529
- Please come with me, mom
- Just go talk!

588
00:54:54,952 --> 00:54:55,683
Dad?

589
00:54:58,276 --> 00:55:00,892
l need to talk to you
about something important

590
00:55:01,984 --> 00:55:02,583
Tell me

591
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:10,034
- lt's a 'life matter', dad
- Come, sit

592
00:55:11,573 --> 00:55:12,783
Go, da!

593
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:22,078
Finally...!

594
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:26,011
Your mom was worried about
you roaming around after college

595
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,093
You've become responsible now

596
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:31,992
- See, now the company has 12-
- Don't 'saw' me to death, dad

597
00:55:32,925 --> 00:55:37,011
l'm 'saw'ing you?!
What kind of language is this?

598
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:40,910
When you went and played cricket
in the ground next to your school

599
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:44,683
You picked up
such stupid language!

600
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:46,565
Dad, l want to marry this girl

601
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:52,924
Straightaway?
No love or anything?

602
00:55:52,997 --> 00:55:55,513
l loved herfor 5 years
And now we want to get married

603
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:58,712
l didn't know this

604
00:55:59,452 --> 00:56:01,971
- That girl's parents?
- They didn't agree...please talk to them

605
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,636
We can't do all that, son

606
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:06,736
lf they don't agree,
l can't force them

607
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:09,578
Dad, l'm in love with this girl

608
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:11,207
Do you understand
what l'm saying?

609
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:12,738
l need to marry her

610
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:15,654
lf you need to marry her
that badly, do it

611
00:56:16,648 --> 00:56:19,013
lt's your wish
But you can't stay here after that

612
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:21,182
- You have to get out
- But...

613
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:30,678
Okay, l'll go
You keep what you earned

614
00:56:30,745 --> 00:56:31,922
But give me all of
grandpa's inheritance!

615
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:33,931
How can you
talk like that, da?!

616
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:41,096
This is real life
Not reel life!

617
00:56:41,676 --> 00:56:43,201
What's the point
in struggling all our lives

618
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:44,513
What will Janani and l do?

619
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:46,084
l want to be happy
with her, dad

620
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:47,583
All ways...always!

621
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:53,948
Who is this girl?

622
00:56:57,274 --> 00:56:58,100
She's this girl...

623
00:56:58,296 --> 00:57:00,204
l know she's a girl
l don't doubt that!

624
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:04,529
- What's her name?
- Janani, dad

625
00:57:05,935 --> 00:57:08,300
She's a very nice girl, dad
She'll be good for our house

626
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:09,920
She cooks very well also

627
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,595
Listen, if her parents
agree, l am fine with it

628
00:57:18,465 --> 00:57:23,641
l'll come for the wedding
But if they don't, it's up to you

629
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:28,594
l'll get you both a flat but
l won't come to the wedding

630
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,483
lt's okay! You can
see her in the album!!

631
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,323
Who is this girl?

632
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,990
l'm sorry, dad...
l didn't know what to do

633
00:57:41,063 --> 00:57:42,588
Aren't you ashamed, Janani?

634
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:50,583
For 15 years your mom waited
outside the U.S embassy

635
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,455
And for whom?
For herself?.

636
00:57:56,436 --> 00:58:01,515
You buried all 3 of our lives
and found 1 for yourself

637
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:04,129
l'll stay inside, Janani

638
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:08,996
Sorry, dad!
l'm sorry, dad!

639
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:16,409
l didn't know what to do
What l did was wrong!

640
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,466
l'll just die, dad
l'll die!

641
00:58:27,472 --> 00:58:30,087
l want Ram, dad

642
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:41,056
Leave it, dad!
Let it go!

643
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:55,115
l don't like America...
Life's good only here

644
00:58:57,998 --> 00:58:59,075
Sumi!

645
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:27,017
You get married to that Ram
We won't stop it

646
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:30,716
But l'm not able to forgive you
l don't know how to

647
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:35,004
Go...go stay there

648
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,870
We won't come there
And you don't come here

649
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:42,040
You can leave
whenever you want

650
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:06,932
A wife walks into your life
you got to toe the line!

651
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:12,148
Even if you see a glam-doll
you must show no design

652
01:00:12,247 --> 01:00:17,195
When friends land up at home
play the host, that's enough

653
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:22,178
Even if you are not wrong
zip your lips, though it's tough!

654
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:32,542
Come on, girls

655
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:42,510
Where is it?

656
01:01:18,186 --> 01:01:23,266
1+1 2
Love so true

657
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:28,213
Before...a buddy
now going steady!

658
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:33,334
Girl + boy couple

659
01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:38,128
Titanic that created a ripple

660
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:43,273
My precious impulse
My life's only pulse

661
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,353
Without being a drag
waltz through life zig-zag!

662
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,479
Come on, girls!

663
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:15,102
Come on, girls!!

664
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:16,437
- Okay?
- lt's crooked, sir

665
01:03:18,686 --> 01:03:19,633
That's my dad

666
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:23,249
- ls it okay?
- lt's too big, sir

667
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,181
Get lost!

668
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:43,166
Are you Janani?
l heard you cook well?!

669
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,225
Do you cook better than me?

670
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:53,139
We'll see!

671
01:03:57,425 --> 01:04:01,315
Youngsters these days
like posh apartments like this

672
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:24,232
Sir, l really love Janani

673
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:29,413
She's not eating
or sleeping properly

674
01:04:32,263 --> 01:04:34,302
l can't stand it, sir

675
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,159
l respect your age
and wisdom

676
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:43,600
lf you could just forgive us
and come and see her once...

677
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:49,323
- Please, sir
- Leave

678
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:59,650
Sir, even when l was a child
l've never fallen at anyone's feet

679
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,661
My father never used to allow it

680
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,026
He believes
all human beings are equal

681
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,918
l haven't even fallen
at my parents' feet

682
01:05:08,957 --> 01:05:12,270
Please, sir, l beg you
l'll fall at your feet

683
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:15,533
Please come and see Janani
for my sake, just once

684
01:05:15,638 --> 01:05:17,457
l know we've hurt you

685
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,942
But l also know
you want her to be happy

686
01:05:20,336 --> 01:05:22,666
l'll keep her happierthan
even you ever would, sir

687
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:26,813
Don't get me wrong
l don't know what else to say, sir

688
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:29,314
Please come see Janani, sir

689
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,808
That's all l ask
Please

690
01:05:32,322 --> 01:05:32,889
Son...

691
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:39,026
We'll come

692
01:06:46,698 --> 01:06:48,007
Thank you, da!

693
01:06:57,982 --> 01:07:00,533
You don't have to, son
lt is okay

694
01:07:05,684 --> 01:07:07,471
- We'll see you later
- Yes, please do

695
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:11,882
Okay, dad

696
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:15,430
Hey Sumi,
come home often

697
01:08:15,588 --> 01:08:18,268
- Leave some for me too
- Oh yea...

698
01:08:20,348 --> 01:08:22,234
Why aren't you wearing
sari orjewelry or anything?

699
01:08:22,395 --> 01:08:23,736
l can't do all that

700
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,838
Are you wearing
traditional clothes?

701
01:08:33,038 --> 01:08:34,728
What happened to you?

702
01:08:35,437 --> 01:08:37,670
We made it!

703
01:08:38,216 --> 01:08:40,962
lt's our house!
Our bedroom!

704
01:08:41,061 --> 01:08:42,172
Our first night together!

705
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:45,151
Right?

706
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:48,022
Somehow we made
our dream come true

707
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:58,606
5 years ago you were in the middle
of a road in the rain with a cycle chain

708
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,421
l should have
just driven right past you

709
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:02,923
l'd have been a happy man

710
01:09:05,066 --> 01:09:07,451
- Why are you slapping me?
- Just wait and see...

711
01:09:12,258 --> 01:09:13,849
Memorable first night this is...

712
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:31,903
- No
- Shut up and come

713
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:33,312
Yeah okay

714
01:10:19,059 --> 01:10:23,080
- l love you, Janani
- l love you, Ram

715
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,310
l won't ever hurt you

716
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:29,341
l'll never let
anyone else hurt you

717
01:10:31,238 --> 01:10:32,317
l know, da

718
01:11:05,726 --> 01:11:13,419
Love that your eyes declared
Precious moments shared

719
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:21,796
Can the clock's hands turn back
a boon that can't backtrack?

720
01:11:21,898 --> 01:11:26,050
Are you appeased?
Why this urgent need?

721
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:30,039
Do you want more...
Fulfilled to the core?

722
01:11:30,146 --> 01:11:34,396
Can we regain our time
spent so sublime?

723
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:39,157
Can l bear this awful pain
First time emotional drain

724
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:47,331
l found you in the moon faraway
it is true, girl, to gallivant everyday

725
01:11:47,438 --> 01:11:55,741
You torment me without protocol
Killing me softly, girl, you enthrall

726
01:11:55,844 --> 01:12:03,417
Love that your eyes declared
Cherished moments shared

727
01:12:03,514 --> 01:12:12,298
Can the clock's hands turn back
a boon that can't backtrack?

728
01:12:49,509 --> 01:12:51,041
l need her glance, a tranquilizer
like shade to a worn-out traveler

729
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:58,040
l need her glance, a tranquilizer
like shade to a worn-out traveler

730
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:02,127
My soul-mate!

731
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:14,653
lf you are my soul so steadfast
you'll come before l breathe my last

732
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:23,158
A balm that doesn't scald
l want this captivity unrivalled

733
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:32,109
l want only you,
girl, my sugar cube!

734
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:40,233
l found you in the moon faraway
it's true, girl, to roam with everyday

735
01:13:40,423 --> 01:13:48,826
You torment me without protocol
Killing me softly, girl, you enthrall

736
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:56,502
Love-light in your eyes declared
Treasured moments shared

737
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:05,067
Can the clock's hands turn back
a boon that can't backtrack?

738
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:09,120
Are you appeased
in this urgent need?

739
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:13,344
Do you want more...
satiated to the core?

740
01:14:13,443 --> 01:14:17,562
Can we regain our time
spent so sublime?

741
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:22,000
Can my soul bear...
woh...oh...oh...!

742
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:44,924
Ma'am, you have visitors

743
01:14:56,144 --> 01:14:58,564
Madam, we've got
the postmortem report

744
01:15:58,184 --> 01:16:01,825
Sir?
1 second...

745
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,398
Why can't you
talk about it later?

746
01:16:12,504 --> 01:16:13,332
Now is a bad time...

747
01:16:13,432 --> 01:16:15,119
Ask her to call me
in a few days

748
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,007
lf it's possible
bring her to the station

749
01:16:17,107 --> 01:16:21,357
Or we'll come back
Give her our condolences

750
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:41,072
Don't, madam! Don't!

751
01:17:26,273 --> 01:17:27,864
There was never
anything unusual, madam

752
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:30,802
He'd come at 8:00 A.M
And leave at 6:00 P.M

753
01:17:30,908 --> 01:17:32,216
Perfect gentleman

754
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:38,504
Forthe past 15-20 days or so,
he's been coming with Senthil

755
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,551
But they are best friends, right?

756
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:44,743
He's gone out of town
He said he'd be back in 10 days

757
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,430
Do you know
where he's gone, aunty?

758
01:17:49,128 --> 01:17:52,058
He knows
more about Ram than l do

759
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:56,093
He was staying at our house
For the past 10 days

760
01:17:57,054 --> 01:18:00,116
l haven't seen him since the day
before my husband died

761
01:18:00,826 --> 01:18:02,483
He didn't even turn up
for the funeral

762
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:03,956
Do you doubt my son?

763
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:07,142
No uncle,
l don't mean it that way

764
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:10,095
l'll let you know
if he comes, leave now

765
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:12,805
Open the door

766
01:18:16,742 --> 01:18:19,804
Don't tell my wife
She won't be able to take it

767
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:31,345
Uncle...
Did you talk to Ram...

768
01:18:40,906 --> 01:18:46,529
Janani, last time Ram came home
he said he wanted to change

769
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:50,237
...his shares and properties
to your name instead of his

770
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:56,981
l don't understand anything, dear

771
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:15,636
Janani, when l think about how
this is my last letter to you...

772
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:19,509
...l think about the years, months,
days and seconds that l have wasted

773
01:20:19,576 --> 01:20:21,939
l don't have much time
l have to go

774
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:25,164
Otherwise it will go wrong
l have lots to say...but...

775
01:20:25,584 --> 01:20:28,167
Most people don't get
everything to work out the way

776
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:30,024
...they want in their life
But for me, it did

777
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:33,283
Almost!
Now it's all gone

778
01:20:33,384 --> 01:20:36,991
l love you, Janani
lf l hurt you, l'm sorry

779
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:39,838
l didn't mean to
l love you...l love you

780
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:45,743
Okay, don't stay alone
Go stay in your parents'house

781
01:20:45,816 --> 01:20:50,121
Senthil...Senthil
Take care of him

782
01:20:50,195 --> 01:20:53,160
l love you
Will you give me 1 last kiss?

783
01:21:48,592 --> 01:21:50,445
- Hello?
- Hello, uncle

784
01:21:50,799 --> 01:21:51,810
Tell me, dear

785
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:54,598
You told me
Ram came home that day?

786
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:57,986
- Yes
- Was Senthil with him?

787
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,474
Yes, he was

788
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:02,429
Why?
What happened?

789
01:22:02,527 --> 01:22:04,411
Hello?
Janani?

790
01:22:27,236 --> 01:22:28,893
What happened, Senthil?

791
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,987
What happened that
made you run and hide?

792
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:35,057
You know
something that l don't

793
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:36,595
Tell me, Senthil

794
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:43,535
Please, Senthil
l beg you to tell me

795
01:22:45,103 --> 01:22:47,433
Don't you think
l deserve to know?

796
01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:56,824
You only knew
1 side of Ram, Janani

797
01:22:58,589 --> 01:23:00,791
There's another side
that you don't know

798
01:23:02,873 --> 01:23:04,333
l've seen it

799
01:23:06,103 --> 01:23:08,783
Remember when you told him
you were leaving?

800
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:10,256
When you got your US visa?

801
01:23:10,354 --> 01:23:12,074
That's when Kumaran said
he was leaving too

802
01:23:12,143 --> 01:23:13,189
To Singapore
because he had got a job

803
01:23:13,294 --> 01:23:16,966
Ram couldn't take it
Kumaran was his childhood friend

804
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,493
You were his whole life

805
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,662
When both of you suddenly left
he couldn't digest it

806
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:24,473
You are already drunk
And you are still drinking

807
01:23:24,575 --> 01:23:27,604
She's also gone
He's also going

808
01:23:28,348 --> 01:23:31,313
Dude, you've been
complaining for an hour

809
01:23:31,831 --> 01:23:33,008
Battery must be dead

810
01:23:33,813 --> 01:23:34,827
Look at her

811
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:37,264
Doesn't it seem like she's saying
'l'm going to leave you'

812
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:38,991
At lease she told me

813
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:42,727
He's going without even a word!
That's why l really can't take it

814
01:23:42,827 --> 01:23:46,684
- He didn't even come to drink
- Bro, come here!

815
01:23:46,823 --> 01:23:48,064
Coming, sir!

816
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:57,842
- Give us 1 packet
- Why just 1?

817
01:23:57,913 --> 01:23:59,057
Doesn't he want 1?

818
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:03,656
She gave me soup and
you are giving me chickpea salad?

819
01:24:03,763 --> 01:24:07,555
- Soup case, are you?
- l loved her for 5 years!

820
01:24:09,195 --> 01:24:14,208
l treated her like 'Her Highness'
And she left me high and dry!!

821
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:16,191
What a royal dialog!!

822
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,183
lt'sjust another soup case
All girls do this

823
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:22,226
Shut up!

824
01:24:22,715 --> 01:24:23,925
What do you know
about his love?

825
01:24:24,026 --> 01:24:25,845
l know all about it, brother!

826
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:28,723
Fritter stall Padma
ditched me too!

827
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:29,932
But if l sat here
feeling bad about it

828
01:24:30,259 --> 01:24:31,752
...will my 'sundal' sell itself?

829
01:24:32,465 --> 01:24:35,331
Take your money and go

830
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:39,553
Yo boys!
l am sing song

831
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:43,906
Soup song

832
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:46,808
Flop song

833
01:24:52,314 --> 01:24:56,716
Why this murderous mutiny, dear?

834
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:03,240
Why this killer instinct so severe?

835
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:05,029
Rhythm correct

836
01:25:05,322 --> 01:25:09,660
Why this fervent fervor, dearie?

837
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,515
Maintain please

838
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:16,373
Why this lethal game, di?

839
01:25:18,811 --> 01:25:24,815
ln the distance, moon's light
Shining bright, so white!

840
01:25:25,394 --> 01:25:31,204
Moon's backdrop is the night
Night is black with an exclusive right

841
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:35,778
Why this deadly anger, dear?

842
01:25:38,308 --> 01:25:42,581
Why this hellish fury on a spear?

843
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:51,053
Girl with a white skin
But heart black within!

844
01:25:51,861 --> 01:25:57,766
Our eyes meet and clash
My future...a backlash!

845
01:25:57,837 --> 01:26:02,534
Why this red hot pepper rage, dearie?

846
01:26:04,678 --> 01:26:09,015
Why this plunder and pillage, di?

847
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,417
Dude, take down notes
also snacks with my quotes!

848
01:26:14,681 --> 01:26:19,858
pa pa paan pa pa paan pa pa paa pa pa paan

849
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:21,034
Don't ruin my tune!

850
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:34,209
Soooper, buddy...ready
Ready...1 - 2 - 3 - 4...!

851
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:37,972
Bingo!

852
01:26:57,863 --> 01:27:00,096
Wow! What a change-over, dude

853
01:27:00,835 --> 01:27:03,798
Okay, tune change

854
01:27:07,518 --> 01:27:10,579
Kai-la glass
Only English...!

855
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:17,130
Glass in my hand
Scotch as planned

856
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,881
Eyes filled with tear

857
01:27:20,524 --> 01:27:23,685
Life is empty
Girl's entry

858
01:27:23,786 --> 01:27:26,204
Life shifts to reverse gear!

859
01:27:26,822 --> 01:27:32,631
Love...love, oh my love!
You dumped me and how!!

860
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:39,281
Holy cow!
l want you here now

861
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:45,932
God! l'm dying now
And she is happy...how?

862
01:27:46,831 --> 01:27:53,021
Heart-break song for boys
We don't have a choice

863
01:27:53,128 --> 01:27:58,171
Why this temper tantrum, dear?.

864
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:03,603
Why this vehement violent sphere?

865
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:10,663
Why this ranting rampage, dearie?

866
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:16,804
Why this kolaveri, kolaveri, kolaveri di?!!

867
01:28:34,104 --> 01:28:43,850
Flop song!

868
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:47,590
Ram
Come here, Ram

869
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:52,474
lf you cross this sea
you can come to me

870
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:59,156
Come, Ram
Won't you come to me?

871
01:29:00,823 --> 01:29:05,390
Come!

872
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:32,362
Ram, what's wrong with you?!
Why did you do this?

873
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:34,537
l don't know
l was intoxicated...

874
01:29:34,608 --> 01:29:37,986
So? This is how you behave?
You'd do anything forJanani?

875
01:29:38,092 --> 01:29:40,130
- She will be happy only there!
- Hey...!

876
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:43,519
l thought he was behaving like that
only because he was drunk

877
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:47,000
So l took him to Kumaran's house
And we made him sleep

878
01:29:47,107 --> 01:29:48,894
Everything was normal

879
01:29:49,281 --> 01:29:52,146
And then you both got married
And Kumaran went to Singapore

880
01:29:52,669 --> 01:29:55,086
And then l didn't see
Ram being Ram at all

881
01:29:55,193 --> 01:29:57,580
l spent a lot of time with him

882
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:00,109
One day Ram's office
faced a big loss

883
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:03,555
Ram's dad was very upset
He came home all tensed

884
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,800
- Tom! Hey, Tom!
- Poorthing!

885
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,873
Why are you taking it out on him?
Come, Tom...good boy, good boy

886
01:30:07,978 --> 01:30:11,269
l'm already in a bad mood
3.2 crores loss!

887
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:20,408
Pch...Tom!
Tom, behave yourself!

888
01:30:21,594 --> 01:30:24,938
- Tom, no!
- Tom, come here, Tom!

889
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:25,872
Tom!

890
01:30:26,006 --> 01:30:29,100
ldiot! Do you have any sense?

891
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,575
He keeps irritating me

892
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,859
Dude, l don't like how
you are behaving

893
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:40,540
That's all l can say

894
01:31:35,012 --> 01:31:40,571
Ram! Ram!

895
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,631
He's dead!

896
01:31:47,414 --> 01:31:49,104
What happened to you?

897
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,769
What will you tell Janani?

898
01:32:29,988 --> 01:32:31,296
AiyaiyO!

899
01:32:33,056 --> 01:32:35,705
Dude, let's take it
to the hospital

900
01:32:37,883 --> 01:32:38,929
Hospital...

901
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:48,614
He's like a child to her
She won't be able to take it!

902
01:32:52,299 --> 01:32:55,197
Please don't tell Janani, dude

903
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:56,611
What do you mean
'don't tell her'?

904
01:32:58,019 --> 01:32:59,327
What if she asks you where he is?

905
01:32:59,426 --> 01:33:00,799
l don't know!

906
01:33:02,398 --> 01:33:07,280
l don't know
what l do when l'm angry!

907
01:33:14,959 --> 01:33:16,485
Help me, dude

908
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,554
We have to
do something...please

909
01:33:40,082 --> 01:33:44,387
Hey! You are back?
Mom asked a lot about you

910
01:33:44,653 --> 01:33:46,212
Oh! Hey, Senthil!

911
01:33:49,161 --> 01:33:53,695
How was work today?
You look tired

912
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,258
Are you okay?

913
01:34:01,881 --> 01:34:05,356
l'll go change and
get dinner ready

914
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:24,182
- Janani, where's Tom?
- What do you mean 'where's Tom'?

915
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,574
You came here before me
Didn't you see him?

916
01:34:28,188 --> 01:34:30,039
No, l didn't notice

917
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:33,361
You didn't notice?
What is this, Ram?

918
01:34:33,523 --> 01:34:37,577
- l was tensed about work
- Tom! Tom!

919
01:34:39,181 --> 01:34:41,796
Where are you? Tom!

920
01:34:49,443 --> 01:34:50,368
Ram?

921
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:55,765
Why are you just sitting there?
Get up and search, Ram

922
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:04,746
Tom...Tom...!

923
01:35:05,712 --> 01:35:07,651
Senthil?
Can you please help us?

924
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,188
Tom!

925
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:26,800
Are you really searching?

926
01:35:33,455 --> 01:35:36,963
Ram? l looked all over the flat

927
01:35:38,314 --> 01:35:41,059
l asked the driver
to look for him outside

928
01:35:42,532 --> 01:35:46,750
He's not there, Ram!
Where could he have gone?

929
01:35:47,871 --> 01:35:52,271
No...l left the door open
for a while when l came in

930
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:56,491
How can you say that
so calmly, Ram?

931
01:35:56,883 --> 01:36:03,303
Do you have any sense?
Tom's like my baby

932
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:09,819
Where could he be?
What will he be doing?

933
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:18,675
- No, Janani...l Was stressed
- Go! l want Tom!

934
01:36:37,317 --> 01:36:41,404
Sorry, Janani
lt's all my fault

935
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:45,045
lt's all my fault, lt's my fault!

936
01:36:46,011 --> 01:36:49,520
Ram! Don't cry!

937
01:36:49,751 --> 01:36:55,459
lt's okay...l'm here!
Don't cry!

938
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:58,978
Please relax

939
01:36:59,498 --> 01:37:01,601
That's when l knew
something was wrong with Ram...

940
01:37:01,672 --> 01:37:07,065
His anger, his sorrow...
his sudden unexplained happiness

941
01:37:07,137 --> 01:37:09,917
l thought l'd help him
before you noticed

942
01:37:09,983 --> 01:37:13,775
lt sounds to me
like Bipolar disorder

943
01:37:14,009 --> 01:37:16,907
But l can't be sure
without seeing the patient

944
01:37:18,197 --> 01:37:22,600
What does Bipolar disorder mean?

945
01:37:23,503 --> 01:37:27,775
Bipolar...as in 2 poles...2 extremes

946
01:37:28,073 --> 01:37:30,275
But this doesn't mean
it's split personality

947
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:33,338
One extreme is depression
the other is mania

948
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:35,872
ln the case of depression
patients will be sad

949
01:37:35,968 --> 01:37:38,037
Loss of appetite and sleep

950
01:37:38,109 --> 01:37:40,279
They'll feel really guilty
for small things

951
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:44,048
ln fact, it might even
lead to suicide

952
01:37:44,886 --> 01:37:47,404
ln the case of mania, they get
angry for the tiniest of things

953
01:37:47,508 --> 01:37:49,806
Sometimes they feel happy
for no reason

954
01:37:49,872 --> 01:37:51,659
lt's called grandiose thinking

955
01:37:51,726 --> 01:37:55,463
For example, the patient might
even think that he l she can lift a car

956
01:37:55,657 --> 01:37:59,743
And they might suddenly get
violent and try and beat people up

957
01:37:59,812 --> 01:38:01,216
They could even
beat themselves up

958
01:38:01,281 --> 01:38:04,062
You can't really say
there's a reason forthis

959
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,563
Anybody can get
this disease at any time

960
01:38:05,661 --> 01:38:09,911
Doctor, it can be cured, can't it?

961
01:38:10,039 --> 01:38:11,729
You can't say it that simply

962
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:15,113
Sometimes the disease
comes once and then leaves

963
01:38:15,218 --> 01:38:17,006
But in some patients
it may repeat

964
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,850
They need to be medicated for long

965
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:22,335
Bring the patient to me
and l'll check it out

966
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:24,828
But don't say anything about this

967
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:26,210
Say something else
and bring him

968
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:27,454
And l'll check it out

969
01:38:27,588 --> 01:38:30,454
My blood ran cold
when l heard what the doctor said

970
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,136
l thought l'd somehow tell Ram
to go see the doctor

971
01:38:34,205 --> 01:38:35,860
l called him over
to stay the night

972
01:38:36,185 --> 01:38:38,996
That's when l realized
how dangerous he was

973
01:38:47,373 --> 01:38:49,793
What did you want to talk about
that was so important?

974
01:38:51,527 --> 01:38:53,598
l haven't stayed even
one night without Janani

975
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:55,265
She felt so bad

976
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:56,790
But she let me come
because it's you

977
01:38:57,185 --> 01:38:58,078
Cheers!

978
01:39:06,103 --> 01:39:11,943
Why are you so silent?
We are hanging out after so long

979
01:39:12,048 --> 01:39:13,988
And you look like
you are haunted by a ghost

980
01:39:14,445 --> 01:39:18,718
lt's not that...You are
a bit different these days

981
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:20,895
Do you realize that?

982
01:39:22,852 --> 01:39:28,247
Your emotions oscillate
between joy and anger

983
01:39:36,532 --> 01:39:40,585
You are only human
if you get happy and angry, right?

984
01:39:41,932 --> 01:39:42,913
Right, Senthil?

985
01:39:46,248 --> 01:39:54,356
No, dude, you over-do it
lt's a bit...

986
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:00,501
What? Are you calling me crazy?

987
01:40:00,567 --> 01:40:03,694
That's not what l meant!
You are a bit abnormal...

988
01:40:06,449 --> 01:40:10,338
- Abnormal?
- Dude! Don't get angry...

989
01:40:12,361 --> 01:40:16,066
Then? lf you talk like this?
What do you expect me to do?

990
01:40:16,868 --> 01:40:20,159
No dude...that day also,
you were so violent

991
01:40:21,055 --> 01:40:22,961
l went and saw a doctor that day...

992
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:33,355
Enough
Don't say anything more

993
01:40:36,493 --> 01:40:42,237
- Dude, please listen to me
- Stop it...

994
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:46,113
No, he said something about
some bipolar disorder or something

995
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:49,237
- lf you come with me 1 time...
- Stop it

996
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:52,273
- Listen to me!
- Stop!

997
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:55,192
Calm down, Ram!
Calm down

998
01:40:55,288 --> 01:40:58,251
Ram! Ram!

999
01:41:49,178 --> 01:41:51,508
-A man with A grey t-shirt
- We didn't see anything

1000
01:42:15,865 --> 01:42:21,739
- How long have l been like this?
- For a few days...l'm not sure

1001
01:42:25,711 --> 01:42:29,001
- Does Janani know?
- No, l don't think so

1002
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:37,879
When she's around, you are-
Dude, let's tell her about this

1003
01:42:37,984 --> 01:42:38,877
No!

1004
01:42:50,385 --> 01:42:52,173
What do l do now?

1005
01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:55,300
l told you before
There's a doctor l know

1006
01:42:55,404 --> 01:42:58,215
- Let's go see him!
- We will...

1007
01:43:09,435 --> 01:43:11,059
Am l insane?

1008
01:43:11,129 --> 01:43:15,085
Don't talk like that!
lt'll be okay...

1009
01:43:15,253 --> 01:43:16,397
Don't worry

1010
01:43:22,187 --> 01:43:23,561
l'm scared, da

1011
01:43:34,717 --> 01:43:37,563
l need to conduct some tests

1012
01:43:37,659 --> 01:43:39,543
After we do that
we can take the next step

1013
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:42,034
By tests you mean...
Blood tests? Scan?

1014
01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:43,625
No, no...nothing like that

1015
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:46,955
You need to answer
a questionnaire truthfully

1016
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:49,322
And then we'll proceed

1017
01:44:08,918 --> 01:44:12,525
When l saw the doctor's face,
l realized something was wrong

1018
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:15,556
Bipolar people
were usually violent

1019
01:44:15,693 --> 01:44:17,634
And manic or sad and silent

1020
01:44:17,739 --> 01:44:20,605
But he said he'd never seen
anyone who showed symptoms

1021
01:44:20,679 --> 01:44:26,140
...of both at the same time
Ram's condition was severe

1022
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:29,555
He asked me to somehow
ask Ram to get admitted

1023
01:44:35,415 --> 01:44:37,583
Dude, he said you need
some more check-ups

1024
01:44:38,387 --> 01:44:40,393
But he said it was best
to get admitted

1025
01:44:40,497 --> 01:44:43,428
- We should tell Janani-
- No, no! Please!

1026
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:49,151
How will she love me
if she sees me like this?

1027
01:44:49,734 --> 01:44:53,951
She'll only be scared of me
Please let's not tell her

1028
01:44:54,496 --> 01:45:00,884
l understand...but if what happened
to me happens to her next time?

1029
01:45:02,359 --> 01:45:03,732
Can you take that?

1030
01:45:11,788 --> 01:45:14,752
l'm sorry
But l have to tell her

1031
01:45:16,711 --> 01:45:19,522
She can't even take it
when l get an ordinary fever

1032
01:45:21,474 --> 01:45:26,106
She won't eat
and she'll keep crying

1033
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,313
How will she handle this?

1034
01:45:35,056 --> 01:45:37,705
And if l get admitted?
What happens to her then?

1035
01:45:40,203 --> 01:45:41,925
She has to look after
a patient like me

1036
01:45:42,025 --> 01:45:43,364
And go to and fro
from hospital to home...

1037
01:45:43,463 --> 01:45:47,516
Don't talk like this
She'd give her life for you

1038
01:45:50,784 --> 01:45:54,096
l know...that's what
l don't want herto do

1039
01:45:55,290 --> 01:46:00,912
Knowing that he wasn't
able to control himself

1040
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:03,209
He was scared
to be alone with you

1041
01:46:08,299 --> 01:46:09,574
What is this, da?

1042
01:46:19,454 --> 01:46:23,127
Ram?
What is this?

1043
01:46:23,257 --> 01:46:28,945
l took a vow to go
to Sabarimalai

1044
01:46:29,042 --> 01:46:31,462
l can see that
But why didn't you tell me?

1045
01:46:33,677 --> 01:46:35,203
lt suddenly struck me

1046
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:49,466
Janani, Senthil will stay
with us for a week

1047
01:46:49,754 --> 01:46:52,621
His house owner
suddenly kicked him out

1048
01:46:55,923 --> 01:46:58,407
Sorry, Janani
l said l'd stay at a hotel

1049
01:46:58,512 --> 01:47:02,402
- But he wouldn't listen
- No, no... feel right at home

1050
01:47:02,507 --> 01:47:06,626
- How's your hand?
- Better

1051
01:47:06,726 --> 01:47:08,994
lt doesn't look like you
fell down from the stairs

1052
01:47:09,093 --> 01:47:11,838
lt looks like you got beaten up
by a bunch of men

1053
01:47:20,375 --> 01:47:23,218
Senthil, l've kept pillows
and sheets on the sofa for you

1054
01:47:24,307 --> 01:47:27,783
Ram, aren't you coming in?

1055
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:30,570
No, Janani, l'm going
on a pilgrimage, right?

1056
01:47:30,668 --> 01:47:32,039
l have to sleep alone

1057
01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:35,584
Janani!

1058
01:47:59,018 --> 01:48:04,097
Leave me alone
Go away...go

1059
01:48:04,165 --> 01:48:09,209
Love, l can suffer in silence
Go...l don't need your presence

1060
01:48:09,278 --> 01:48:14,193
l'm a zombie, the living dead
Let miles distance us instead

1061
01:48:14,296 --> 01:48:19,243
All the places you touched...
go, love, l've been scorched!

1062
01:48:19,506 --> 01:48:24,421
Love, the minutes l stayed away
were meant to keep you at bay

1063
01:48:24,525 --> 01:48:29,505
Just leave me and go, sweetie
Go in search of your 'bodhi tree'!

1064
01:48:29,606 --> 01:48:35,993
Distorting my destiny you chose
You gave me grief, love adios!

1065
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:00,155
l suffer here on my own,
Go, my love, l need to be alone

1066
01:49:00,258 --> 01:49:06,361
l'm a zombie, the living dead
Let miles distance us instead

1067
01:49:47,052 --> 01:49:57,209
l am alive for your sake
Girl, my life is at stake!

1068
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:05,834
lf you show me love's gift
l'll never forget the benefit

1069
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,962
The times we spent
without dissent...

1070
01:50:10,033 --> 01:50:12,519
...isn't there a way
for that life to replay?

1071
01:50:12,591 --> 01:50:15,008
Together we took delight
in exploring many a night

1072
01:50:15,115 --> 01:50:18,493
Aren't we destined to see
first ray of sunlight joyously?

1073
01:50:27,197 --> 01:50:32,178
My dear, leave no trace
Go away from this place

1074
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:37,391
lf my love you don't perceive
then it is your loss, love, leave

1075
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:42,470
Though my dreams did shatter
you stood by me, now disappear

1076
01:50:42,572 --> 01:50:47,583
All the places you touched...
go, love, l've been scorched!

1077
01:50:47,685 --> 01:50:52,895
Love, the minutes l stayed away
were meant to keep you at bay

1078
01:50:53,822 --> 01:50:55,131
Because Ram didn't get admitted
the doctorwas worried...

1079
01:50:55,227 --> 01:50:57,048
...that he wouldn't
get proper treatment

1080
01:50:57,114 --> 01:51:00,045
However much he forced Ram,
he was unable to convince him

1081
01:51:00,438 --> 01:51:02,924
One day, he called
and gave me an injection

1082
01:51:02,995 --> 01:51:06,090
He said l should use it
if l couldn't control him

1083
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:09,090
My parents have come back
from out of town

1084
01:51:10,092 --> 01:51:13,219
l'll be back in an hour maximum
You take care of yourself

1085
01:51:27,384 --> 01:51:31,470
- What is happening, Ram?
- What...Janani?

1086
01:51:31,635 --> 01:51:36,201
All of it!
Why is Senthil staying with us?

1087
01:51:39,274 --> 01:51:41,343
Whatever it is, you can tell me
lt's okay

1088
01:51:44,548 --> 01:51:47,294
- lt's nothing, Janani
- Don't tell me it's nothing, Ram

1089
01:51:49,309 --> 01:51:51,347
Don't you think
l'm noticing things?

1090
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:54,101
You are not sleeping
in the same room as me

1091
01:51:54,615 --> 01:51:56,337
You are not talking to me

1092
01:51:57,237 --> 01:51:59,884
You don't even smile
at me anymore, Ram

1093
01:52:01,487 --> 01:52:06,717
You don't think l know you?
l've known you for 10 years!

1094
01:52:07,177 --> 01:52:11,678
You've never been like this
Say something, Ram!

1095
01:52:14,367 --> 01:52:17,594
-Are you having an affair, Ram?
- How can you talk like this, Janani?

1096
01:52:17,693 --> 01:52:24,176
You don't even
make love to me anymore

1097
01:52:27,057 --> 01:52:30,851
Can you treat me
any worse than this, Ram?

1098
01:52:34,282 --> 01:52:35,653
l love you, Ram

1099
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:42,649
l can't scold you
l don't know how to!

1100
01:52:46,268 --> 01:52:47,791
Come inside and sleep, Ram

1101
01:52:51,795 --> 01:52:54,695
l knew you didn't like it
but l continued staying at your house

1102
01:52:54,802 --> 01:52:56,554
l had no other choice

1103
01:52:56,654 --> 01:52:59,335
l knew you'd noticed
Ram's odd behavior

1104
01:52:59,436 --> 01:53:00,807
But only l knew
how upset he was

1105
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:02,945
That he couldn't do
anything about it

1106
01:53:03,752 --> 01:53:05,887
He wanted to work things out
between the two of you

1107
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:10,110
Despite Ram's protests
you forced him and took him out

1108
01:54:19,725 --> 01:54:21,251
Ram had his treatment that day

1109
01:54:21,325 --> 01:54:24,037
That's why he lied to you

1110
01:54:24,105 --> 01:54:26,820
...and sent you away
with some silly excuse

1111
01:54:35,037 --> 01:54:38,415
Hello? Excuse me?
l'm talking to you!

1112
01:54:39,863 --> 01:54:43,121
What's your problem?

1113
01:54:43,188 --> 01:54:45,901
lt's nothing, it's trivial
Please leave it

1114
01:54:45,968 --> 01:54:47,014
No, but he's very tensed about it

1115
01:54:47,087 --> 01:54:49,287
Yourfriend only started it
But it's okay...leave it

1116
01:54:49,355 --> 01:54:50,303
What's your problem?

1117
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:53,123
No, it's his fault!
Okay, l'll apologize

1118
01:54:53,191 --> 01:54:56,090
- Please just go
- You can'tjust indecently hit anybody

1119
01:54:56,228 --> 01:54:58,614
Sir, your man only
created the problem

1120
01:54:58,721 --> 01:54:59,549
What did he do?

1121
01:54:59,648 --> 01:55:01,881
He was the one
behaving indecently

1122
01:55:01,949 --> 01:55:03,736
l can't just stand there
while he misbehaves with my wife-

1123
01:55:03,836 --> 01:55:04,435
Hey!

1124
01:55:04,699 --> 01:55:10,735
- What's wrong with you? Hey!
- Lift him up!

1125
01:55:20,168 --> 01:55:27,284
ls this a cinema fight?!
Hold his head up

1126
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:30,138
Hit him there
Hit him right here

1127
01:55:31,771 --> 01:55:35,443
Hit him properly
There's no blood

1128
01:55:36,948 --> 01:55:39,149
What an idiot!

1129
01:56:00,472 --> 01:56:02,478
What are you doing?

1130
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:06,670
Leave him!
What's wrong with you?

1131
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:10,090
Hit him 4 times
and leave him

1132
01:56:13,642 --> 01:56:15,678
- ls that enough?
- No, it isn't

1133
01:56:15,941 --> 01:56:16,868
Why?

1134
01:56:16,997 --> 01:56:19,712
He hit me in front of a girl
lt was humiliating

1135
01:56:19,779 --> 01:56:22,709
- Then scar him for life!
- Okay, bro

1136
01:56:48,162 --> 01:56:51,322
Leave it!

1137
01:56:51,614 --> 01:56:53,498
Let me go!
Leave me

1138
01:58:45,752 --> 01:58:50,929
Go
Listen to me

1139
01:58:58,824 --> 01:58:59,871
Ram...!

1140
01:59:35,328 --> 01:59:37,942
Ram realized that if you couldn't
handle him getting hurt...

1141
01:59:38,043 --> 01:59:41,999
...you wouldn't be able
to take this in your stride

1142
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:55,587
Even if you got teary eyed
Ram would feel choked

1143
01:59:56,135 --> 01:59:59,927
When l saw how affected
he was by your tears that day

1144
02:00:00,034 --> 02:00:03,706
...l knew he'd never tell you
Nor ever get admitted

1145
02:00:53,732 --> 02:00:55,005
What are you looking at?

1146
02:01:01,945 --> 02:01:02,870
What?

1147
02:01:04,599 --> 02:01:07,824
- Can you see anything there?
- What?

1148
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:15,934
- What are you saying?
- l can see something

1149
02:01:24,958 --> 02:01:31,954
Dude, there's nothing there
l'm getting freaked out

1150
02:01:32,406 --> 02:01:33,931
Maybe we should
go to the hospital

1151
02:01:34,004 --> 02:01:39,748
No! No hospital!
No need-

1152
02:01:40,363 --> 02:01:44,482
l was kidding,
There's no one there

1153
02:01:45,063 --> 02:01:49,084
Ram, don't play with me
Don't lie

1154
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,908
- No l wasn't-
- Listen to me

1155
02:01:50,977 --> 02:01:54,649
- Let's go to the hospital
- No hospital, buddy

1156
02:01:54,748 --> 02:01:58,736
l was simply saying
There's really no one there

1157
02:01:58,839 --> 02:02:04,583
- l'm not mad
- Okay, okay, calm down

1158
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:06,508
No need to go to the hospital

1159
02:02:13,096 --> 02:02:21,683
Water...water for the medicine

1160
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:26,229
l knew Ram was lying

1161
02:02:27,606 --> 02:02:32,488
The doctor had said
he'd have hallucinations

1162
02:02:32,592 --> 02:02:35,970
And he did
l told the doctor about it

1163
02:02:36,075 --> 02:02:38,657
He said that we'd have
to start shock treatment

1164
02:03:17,723 --> 02:03:18,584
Ram

1165
02:03:23,062 --> 02:03:24,433
Why are you so late?

1166
02:03:26,002 --> 02:03:29,925
- l had work at the office
- ls that true, Senthil?

1167
02:03:35,015 --> 02:03:37,531
He doesn't know
He just came

1168
02:03:37,731 --> 02:03:39,388
When did you
leave from the office?

1169
02:03:41,087 --> 02:03:42,580
Just now...about
15 minutes ago

1170
02:03:46,842 --> 02:03:50,132
You are lying, Ram!
You are lying to ME

1171
02:03:50,933 --> 02:03:51,914
- l'll leav-
- Wait here!

1172
02:03:52,052 --> 02:03:53,903
Where are you going? Wait!

1173
02:03:56,335 --> 02:04:01,151
l called your office
They said you left at 7:00P.M!

1174
02:04:01,738 --> 02:04:06,203
lt's 11 :00P.M now
Are you going to blame it on traffic?

1175
02:04:07,777 --> 02:04:09,947
Open your mouth
and say something, Ram!

1176
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:14,870
- Say something, say something, Ram!
- Janani, Janani don't! Don't do this

1177
02:04:16,854 --> 02:04:19,501
This is between us
Who are you exactly?

1178
02:04:20,626 --> 02:04:23,143
You keep your place
and stay where you should be

1179
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:31,233
- Hey!
- What? Then What?

1180
02:04:32,739 --> 02:04:37,556
You'll hit me?
Hit me, hit me!

1181
02:04:45,398 --> 02:04:48,296
Come, da
Let's leave them alone

1182
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:53,921
Why are behaving like this?

1183
02:04:54,923 --> 02:04:57,886
l know you won't
do anything wrong

1184
02:04:58,182 --> 02:05:03,675
But something's happening
Tell me what it is, Ram!

1185
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:11,733
Why aren't you letting me in?
l just want to be there for you

1186
02:05:14,291 --> 02:05:17,483
Ram!
Look at me, Ram

1187
02:05:21,962 --> 02:05:24,677
l just want to be there for you

1188
02:05:30,432 --> 02:05:32,797
l just want to be there for you

1189
02:05:38,518 --> 02:05:41,615
l'm sorry, Senthil
l didn't mean that

1190
02:05:50,824 --> 02:05:57,920
Ram! Dai, Ram...!
What happened?

1191
02:05:58,017 --> 02:05:59,508
Why are you
standing like this?

1192
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:03,668
Hey, Ram!

1193
02:07:00,345 --> 02:07:01,748
Let's get admitted

1194
02:07:07,248 --> 02:07:09,895
l don't remember anything
since the hospital visit

1195
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:14,301
The doctor said this might happen
due to the shock treatment

1196
02:07:17,826 --> 02:07:25,653
Ram, it's getting worse
Let's get admitted

1197
02:07:32,787 --> 02:07:38,245
l'd rather die
than have her look at me differently

1198
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:39,747
Yes, die

1199
02:07:39,849 --> 02:07:44,797
- Dude...
- No, think about it

1200
02:07:45,828 --> 02:07:49,086
- That's what is right
- Don't talk like this

1201
02:07:49,759 --> 02:07:53,529
l'm there for you
You are talking like a mad man

1202
02:07:54,871 --> 02:07:56,299
l am, aren't l?

1203
02:07:57,174 --> 02:08:01,130
- l didn't mean it like that
- lt's okay...it's okay

1204
02:08:06,987 --> 02:08:10,114
Dude, don't cry

1205
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:12,090
Everything will be alright

1206
02:08:28,051 --> 02:08:31,821
Will you do something for me?

1207
02:08:41,153 --> 02:08:44,890
- Dad...?
- Ram?

1208
02:08:45,661 --> 02:08:48,790
What are you doing here so late?
All okay at home?

1209
02:08:51,446 --> 02:08:54,758
Dad, l have something
important to tell you

1210
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:59,556
lt's a 'life matter', dad

1211
02:09:00,716 --> 02:09:02,818
lf you say it's a 'life matter'...

1212
02:09:04,008 --> 02:09:05,793
ls Janani pregnant?

1213
02:09:09,728 --> 02:09:11,134
Come, sit

1214
02:09:21,012 --> 02:09:22,350
What is it?
Tell me

1215
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:26,854
- Dad
- Hmmm?

1216
02:09:26,957 --> 02:09:32,995
l want all my shares and
properties transferred to Janani...

1217
02:09:33,542 --> 02:09:34,815
...can we do that?

1218
02:09:35,618 --> 02:09:38,996
Why? Everything
okay at home?

1219
02:09:39,326 --> 02:09:42,226
Don't misunderstand Janani

1220
02:09:42,364 --> 02:09:45,175
l know about my girl
You don't need to tell me

1221
02:09:50,834 --> 02:09:53,798
- Can you change it, dad?
- No, it doesn't seem right

1222
02:09:54,797 --> 02:09:58,338
Dad, l feel like
she's lucky for me-

1223
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:01,345
Don't talk about luck and all

1224
02:10:01,797 --> 02:10:03,225
lt seems wrong

1225
02:10:08,476 --> 02:10:14,318
Whose name are
half your shares under?

1226
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:19,754
Tell me...whose name?

1227
02:10:20,973 --> 02:10:22,564
Your mom

1228
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:30,171
l can't win with you

1229
02:10:31,299 --> 02:10:34,491
l'll do it 1st thing
in the morning

1230
02:10:34,782 --> 02:10:35,796
You go now

1231
02:10:36,701 --> 02:10:39,185
Okay, bye

1232
02:10:39,352 --> 02:10:44,780
Ram, please don't talk about
'life matter' anymore

1233
02:10:46,959 --> 02:10:48,387
No, dad
l won't

1234
02:10:59,488 --> 02:11:07,084
Dude, l'll be fine
You go home

1235
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:11,692
l can't leave you alone right now

1236
02:11:12,754 --> 02:11:17,865
No, it's okay
l'll lock myself in the study

1237
02:11:18,347 --> 02:11:24,002
- You go home
- No, l won't

1238
02:11:24,996 --> 02:11:26,937
lf you think about suicide or-

1239
02:11:50,118 --> 02:11:55,709
l'm sorry, my friend
l'm sorry for everything

1240
02:11:58,524 --> 02:12:03,025
You've done a lot for me
But l have to go now

1241
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:04,883
That's the right thing to do

1242
02:12:07,955 --> 02:12:10,024
Even if l had a brother...

1243
02:12:25,692 --> 02:12:31,599
That's when l last saw him
After that...

1244
02:13:35,916 --> 02:13:38,879
Thank you
Thank you...

1245
02:13:40,357 --> 02:13:43,006
l'm going now

1246
02:14:41,568 --> 02:14:44,247
You either kill her
or kill yourself

1247
02:14:54,992 --> 02:14:58,599
Quickly! Decide
You die or she dies

1248
02:19:27,697 --> 02:19:28,776
l love you, Janani!
